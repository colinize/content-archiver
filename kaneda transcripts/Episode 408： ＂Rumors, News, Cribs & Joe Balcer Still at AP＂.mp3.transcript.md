[00:00] Outro

[00:01] Out of the jail, California dreaming

[00:03] Soon as I step on a scene, I'm hearing who she's screaming

[00:05] Fiending for money and I'm all over the light

[00:07] But for Westfile, play it with childs out

[00:10] And it's long

[00:11] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

[00:15] Welcome kids, strap in its episode

[00:18] 408 of Canadian Pimball Podcast, the only Pimball Podcast

[00:22] That flies below the hard deck

[00:24] And gets you the Pimball News right away

[00:27] Well, let's start with American Pimball

[00:29] So I'm hearing that Joe Balser is out at American Pimball

[00:33] That's right, you heard it here first

[00:35] He is no longer

[00:36] Actually, we have to do a little bit of a news break to this podcast

[00:41] That went up this morning

[00:42] I just heard that Joe Balser was at American Pimball today

[00:49] And is still there

[00:50] So when you run the rumor mill

[00:52] You're gonna get people who tell you stuff that is not accurate

[00:55] So let's just do a little editing of the show here

[00:59] And confirm for the listener that Joe Balser is still at American Pimball

[01:03] Now that being said

[01:05] He is making game number three as we speak

[01:08] And let me air the rest of what I said about American Pimball

[01:11] Because I think it's still relevant

[01:13] Even if Joe Balser is in the design seat of that game

[01:17] So let's go right back to what we said on this edition of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[01:21] Like this company now has had two chances at bat

[01:25] And both times, I don't care what other people say in terms of the games are fun

[01:29] Both games have failed to be commercially successful

[01:33] And Joe had two shots

[01:35] You can't just blame American Pimball

[01:37] I mean Joe himself was the designer on the first two games with American Pimball

[01:42] And both of them failed to be commercial successes

[01:46] And it's interesting when you think about this hobby

[01:49] Because a lot of the games that we now celebrate

[01:53] The circus full tears, right?

[01:55] Some of the, you know, all the John Papadu titles from the 90s

[01:59] A lot of the games from back in the day that we currently considered to be great games

[02:05] Where commercial failures back then

[02:07] And so it begs the question

[02:09] Are we seeing games that will not be appreciated today

[02:15] But maybe five years from now

[02:17] Maybe ten years from now

[02:19] When the Pimball hobby starts to like go back into the dark ages

[02:23] Are we going to look back at games like dialed in

[02:27] And Houdini and October Fest

[02:29] And will those be the games that people say were the ones that were really the best

[02:33] We just couldn't see it at the time

[02:35] Because we were blinded by all these license themed games

[02:39] So here's the thing

[02:41] I don't know what the future holds for American Pimball

[02:43] But I do know this

[02:45] If their third title is not a hit

[02:49] I think this company is done

[02:51] And I don't know if Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes

[02:55] Or any of those teased themes they were putting out there

[02:59] I don't know if any of those are good enough to withstand

[03:03] The titles that are about to come out from other manufacturers

[03:07] And I think American Pimball has just

[03:09] They've failed to get the right kind of lift in this company

[03:13] And under this company

[03:15] And they've failed to capture the imagination of the Pimball buying public

[03:19] And so I think they're at a point now where it's like hit or dead

[03:23] They need a hit or this company will be dead

[03:25] Now we all know that if they are personally financed by someone else

[03:29] Then maybe I'm wrong

[03:31] Maybe, you know, dobbles

[03:33] You know, daddy and all the money they have surrounding that company

[03:37] Can keep them going for longer

[03:39] But I just think at this point

[03:41] They can't have, you know, three strikes in your out

[03:43] I think is fair to say when it comes to American Pimball

[03:45] What I don't get is this

[03:47] Here's the thing I never will understand about these companies

[03:49] That start with pretty decent investment capital

[03:51] Why would you launch a Pimball company

[03:53] With investment capital

[03:55] And why would you launch a company

[03:57] And not launched with a license IP game

[03:59] Like why would you launch a company

[04:01] And not launch a company

[04:03] And not launched with a license IP game

[04:05] Like why would you launch a company

[04:07] And not launch this IP game

[04:09] Like why would you launch with Houdini

[04:11] Why would you follow that up

[04:13] With Octoberfest

[04:15] Like either you have the money necessary

[04:17] To make a game people really want

[04:19] Or you don't

[04:21] But they have the money

[04:23] That's what I don't get

[04:25] The amount of money they must have lost

[04:27] In making games people didn't really want

[04:29] They should have re-evaluated their approach

[04:31] And they should have went and got a license theme game as game number one

[04:35] need to come out of the gates with a license theme game. It's just that simple. You are

[04:41] not going to be successful in the Pimbal World launching a title that doesn't have a theme

[04:47] that is appealing to people. And when I say this, I'm thinking about deep root. And if

[04:52] they think Raza is going to be the game that just lifts everyone up and becomes a smash

[04:57] hit, I'd be nervous if I were them. I would be nervous because, yeah, it might be amazing,

[05:04] but who has more of a following? Raza or Batman or Star Wars or Ghostbusters, right? Or

[05:13] Willy Wonka or Guns and Roses or Toy Story or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, right? So,

[05:20] look at Andrew Highway. Imagine if Andrew Highway launched his company with Alien Pimbal

[05:25] instead of wasting all that money and resources and time making full throttle. Do you know

[05:32] Andrew Highway when he would show people his plans? He thought he was going to sell

[05:36] three to five thousand full throttles. What is wrong with these people? The same thing

[05:41] with American Pimbal. They would tell people they're going to sell a few thousand

[05:45] October fest. It's mind boggling to me. I don't understand it. So, I would go get a license

[05:53] theme and give it one more swing. All right. So, speaking of that, let's go to Spooky Pimbal.

[05:59] So here's what I'm hearing. Spooky Pimbal we know is about to wrap up Alice Cooper's

[06:04] Nightmare Castle production. All right. It's been a very successful year for them. Here

[06:09] is what I'm hearing about Spooky Pimbal's next game. It's Scott Denise's game. We all

[06:15] know that. It is a license game that is 80s retro. All right. You can stop right there.

[06:24] It's a license game that's 80s retro. Hallelujah. They've listened. They know the sweet

[06:31] spot in the Pimbal marketplace. The 80s nostalgia is the most amazing period to go back

[06:40] to for Pimbal. It is the period in which you will attract the most amount of people to

[06:47] your product way more than 60s stuff and 70s stuff like monsters. Come on guys. Let's

[06:53] be honest here. How many of you before Stern announced the monsters? How many of you willingly

[07:00] were waking up and watching the monsters still on TV? You weren't. How many of you were

[07:06] watching Batman 66? Not really. Be honest. How many of you are watching Elvira B Campy

[07:12] movies? The 80s are hotter than ever and the 80s films are the most iconic movies ever.

[07:20] I don't know if it's a movie or a TV show. It could be a variety of things. It could be

[07:25] some horror movie that none of us liked from the 80s. I don't know. But I think this is

[07:29] the right direction to go in. If I'm spooky Pimbal, I'm also hearing this about the title.

[07:35] They have full assets and custom voice work and the art package is the best art package

[07:43] to be on a spooky game yet, which is saying a lot because we've seen incredible art packages

[07:49] on Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle. I would even say the art was great on the cabinets,

[07:53] not on the playfield for Rob Zombie. Maybe this is why. Maybe this is why Chuck is starting

[08:00] at the Fang Club because he knows he has a dynamite hit on his hands. He knows that

[08:06] way more people are going to come through the door to get his next title. He's implementing

[08:12] a way in which he can give access to this hit to his loyal customers first. And so now

[08:20] it's maybe starting to make sense why Chuck is doing this. Am I building hype for this

[08:25] game too early? I don't know. But when I hear stuff like this, it's Scott and Eacy Throwback

[08:31] 80s with full assets and custom call outs. All of a sudden, that's everything I know

[08:38] all of us want in pinball plus some great artwork. So I look forward to seeing what the

[08:44] Scott and Eacy game is over at spooky. So that's exciting. Now speaking of, you know, a

[08:50] great art packages, but not much else. Suncoast pinball in total, they made 25 games before

[08:58] Suncoast pinball declared bankruptcy and has stopped making pinball machines. Now look,

[09:05] here's the deal. How can you go through all the effort to make a pinball machine? How

[09:11] can you spend months, if not years? How can you set up a production facility? How can

[09:17] you hire employees? Why even bother making a pinball machine in 2018, 2019 in which you

[09:25] can only sell 25 units or make 25 units? Where did this go wrong? And I'll say it. And

[09:35] I've said it before on this show, if you start a pinball company that fails this horribly

[09:41] to get off the ground, it's simply because you did one thing wrong. You did no market

[09:47] research to understand what the market wants. And I think they might have listened to like

[09:52] half of what I've said on this show. I used to say like, if you just make a game sexy,

[09:55] it'll sell. But you know what's happened in this hobby is almost every game looks really

[10:00] good now. You need more than just an art package on a game. You need a good game. And

[10:05] if we were to look at cosmic carnival, a lot of things going against it right off the

[10:10] bat. First of all, what the heck is a cosmic carnival? It's a theme that it's not just

[10:16] a theme that nobody wants. It's a theme that nobody can even understand, right? A cosmic

[10:22] carnival. That is that is the mashing together of two things that people can't comprehend.

[10:28] So right off the bat, you're confused about what the game is about. Okay, so don't even

[10:32] know what the experience is. You don't even know if you want it, right? At least October

[10:36] Fest was like, it's something you know. At least Houdini is something you know. And

[10:42] then you look at the game and it's probably one of the most simple basic layouts ever.

[10:48] So it's not going to appeal to people who love unique layouts or want something new in

[10:53] pinball. It's beyond basic. Like it's taking five steps back from what you can get with

[10:58] the Stern Pro. So there's nothing in it that would appeal to like a pinball fanatic who

[11:02] loves to shoot. It's just an art package with some neat sculpts and a dirty donny sort

[11:09] of art, art, art, art package and a weird name. So it failed. And so that is it, right?

[11:16] It do really think some coast pinball is going to come back. And here's my point. And I know

[11:20] sometimes people are like, can you need to be more supportive of all these pinball ventures

[11:25] and help them like support them? I'm sorry, but I don't think that's my job. I think if

[11:31] you want to start a pinball company, you need to do the homework first. You need to do

[11:36] the research first on what will be successful. And I'm here to tell you all of you listeners

[11:42] out there designing a pinball game is not easy. It's not. It's clear that it takes a unique

[11:50] talent to make a pinball game that people will love. And it also takes a combination of

[11:57] different skill sets coming together in harmony to make a pinball machine that people will

[12:03] actually want to buy. And we've seen it before. If you get, imagine an orchestra in which

[12:09] there are five members or a band, five members. Let's take guns and roses. Imagine if everybody

[12:15] on guns and roses was hitting the right notes. But then slash gets up there and just starts

[12:20] hitting all the wrong notes on an off key guitar. It would ruin every song. Even if he

[12:24] was still playing sweet child of mine, if the guitar was out of tune, it would be unbearable.

[12:30] And to me, that's what happens when you look at a game like October Fest in which you've

[12:34] got all these amazing mechanisms. You've got all these fun shots. You've got all these

[12:39] toys and whatnot in the game. But then the art package makes, you know, looks like vomit

[12:43] on it. And you're like, what the hell? And then the LCD is not, you know, the animations

[12:48] are not up to par. You have to have every member of the pinball band playing the instrument

[12:55] properly now in 2019 to make a game commercially successful, to make it awesome, to make it

[13:03] fun, to make people want it. And there's no other way around it. You either succeed in

[13:08] doing that or don't even bother. It's the same thing in anything in life. And I think we're

[13:13] starting to understand that more now than ever that you need a solid team to make great

[13:19] games. And look, if there's one company that has so many solid team members, we know

[13:24] it's Stern pinball. We know Jersey Jack's got a lot of solid team members. I would like

[13:28] to see better artwork over at Jersey Jack. I think that's the, their weakest element

[13:32] right now. We know there's a solid team over at Chicago Gaming Company. We know there's

[13:36] a solid team over at spooky. And that's my point is if you're new to the game and your

[13:41] team is not solid, don't even bother making pinball because you're not going to be successful.

[13:45] All right. So Dutch pinball, my god, Dutch pinball, we can't stop talking about the fact

[13:51] that the, I'll just call it this. This is the, the blind optimism is back. And it's back

[13:58] in a big way. For some reason, once Barry talks or shares a few images and communicates

[14:06] with some of these like EA's like Barry's got his little circle of EA's that, that believe

[14:11] in him, that have believed in him all these years. And he is able to manipulate the optimism

[14:19] and the hope within the pinball community using this little inner circle of EA's. And I

[14:24] understand why these guys are fan bullies. They want their games. So right now, where

[14:29] is Dutch pinball at? We know that two games have been made out of the parts that he got

[14:34] from ARA. We saw the photograph of them. But does this mean that everything is going to,

[14:39] is going to be great now? Does it mean that they're going to be successful? I think we're

[14:43] back at another wait and see period. Now wait and see has been the, the 90% of Dutch pinball's

[14:51] history has been a wait and see period. Like, will they figure it out? Will they not? I don't know.

[14:56] I can't tell you from sitting in my one bedroom apartment in New York City, what Barry has

[15:03] set up over there. I can't tell you if he's going to make this work or not. Do I hope he makes

[15:09] it work? Of course, I hope he does. I hope that every early achiever gets their machine. I'm not

[15:15] rooting against him. But I'm a realist. The guy has also proven to be nothing more than a manipulator

[15:23] at times and a liar at times. And so I saw that just the other day in the midst of trying to get

[15:30] big Lebowski's made again in the midst of trying to get the early achievers what they paid for.

[15:36] Barry is also now telling people that he's starting to work on game number two and he wants to get

[15:43] game number two going in March of 2020. And when I hear stuff like that, I once again,

[15:50] and remind it that we're not dealing with a good businessman. We're not dealing with a smart

[15:55] communicator. We are once again dealing with the delusional optimism of Barry. Does he really

[16:03] think he can move on to game number two? I mean, he hasn't even satiated all the people that got

[16:09] burned on game number one. And the pathway to getting all of those big Lebowski's made is going

[16:16] to take a very long time. It will consume all of their 2020. There's not game number two being

[16:24] worked on. He did he forget what he needs to do. He needs to make so much money. So much money

[16:32] off of selling 500 big Lebowski's at $12,500 that he can then give the people who got burned a free

[16:40] one that they already paid for. It's not free. You know what I'm saying? He has to do all of that.

[16:46] And he hasn't even come close. He's made two extra games. Two out of the five hundred. He's got

[16:53] 498 to go. And he's talking about game number two. This reminds me so much of Andrew Highway.

[17:02] It reminds me so much of the delusional pinball people out there that before they even finish game

[17:09] one, they're talking about two, three, four, and five. And we know how this story ends. And

[17:17] what I think Barry needs to do is shut up about game two. Shut up about anything else. Don't

[17:23] even talk. Put games in boxes. Now, what do we think about the early achievers are talking in private?

[17:31] Right? They're not they're apparently these guys have information that if we all knew we would

[17:35] be much more confident in Barry's efforts. Okay, I love it. I love the Stockholm syndrome that

[17:40] the people that he has kidnapped for all these years are his biggest supporters. Now here's the

[17:45] problem. If you keep this information secret, the only person you're helping out are the

[17:51] Lebowski flippers who are now getting like 18 to 20,000 dollars because if information is valid

[17:59] and credible that things are actually progressing nicely, then the ability to flip these games

[18:05] will soften if not dissipate completely. And why not release that information? Now here's probably

[18:12] why they don't want that information out there. I'll tell you why because if you're an early

[18:16] achiever and you get to cut the line and buy one of these games, you're you're now in on a big Lebowski

[18:23] for 21,000 dollars. So it's kind of in your best interest to keep the second hand value of these

[18:31] games pretty high because we all know there is a slim slim to none chance that an early achiever

[18:40] who buys a new game at at at 12,000 five who's 21 in on Lebowski. There's a slim to none chance

[18:48] of that person to ever going to see that second game. We know that. They know that. So maybe that's

[18:53] why they're doing it. But once again, Dutch Pimbalt is in a wait and see period and you know what,

[19:01] I think again, I do. I think in the next four months, no one's going to give a crap about Dutch

[19:05] Pimbalt and their game number two because people are going to see the exciting stuff they can have

[19:10] from Stern, Jersey Jack, Chicago gaming, you know, Dutch maybe deep root. All the people who are

[19:16] really making real game spooky Pimbal, all the real manufacturers that that haven't like yanked you

[19:21] around and jerked your leg for all these years, that's where you should apply your money people.

[19:26] All right, Stern Pimbalt. Elvira owners are opening up their Elvira's and they're giving feedback

[19:33] on the game. Now I am laughing in this thread. I'll tell you why. 450 of you committed to buying

[19:41] Elvira for either $10,000 or $15,000 and none of you, none of you, 100% of you never played the game.

[19:51] Okay, so think about that for a minute. Never played it. Never flipped it. Have no idea what you got.

[19:56] So now early people who have the game or Ellie owners are starting to give their feedback.

[20:02] Now here's the feedback I'm reading that the game is kind of really easy. Some people are calling

[20:09] it boring. It is super simple to shoot is what I'm hearing. Now look, boring, fun, it's all subjective.

[20:17] The code is also very early on. So you just spent a total money on a game that's really easy to shoot

[20:25] that might get boring, that has code that is very that needs to go a very long way before it's done.

[20:30] Okay, so it's pretty much another, you know, Lyman Sheets Batman sort of experience. I would also

[20:35] argue that you could look at Batman and say it's pretty boring as well to shoot on day one without

[20:40] the code fully where it needs to be. I'm no Batman apologist. The game has its shot issues for sure.

[20:48] Okay, so great. You know, look, you guys bought it. You guys are you went all in on it. We'll see.

[20:56] You know, I still don't understand. Unless it's like a theme you absolutely can't live without,

[21:01] I just don't understand running into this situation because here's what I think is going to happen

[21:06] right now. These Ellie's, I think people who went headfirst in on the Ellie are going, some of

[21:14] them are going to bail. Some of them are going to bail. Some of them are going to bail maybe with

[21:18] their distributor who will give them a refund. Some of them are going to bail where they're going to

[21:21] want to sell it on the second hand market. I think you're going to see people start to jump ship

[21:28] if the game doesn't shoot the way they want it to because who's going to want to wait two years

[21:32] for the game to, you know, to mature. Now, I think some people are tired of that. Now, some of you

[21:37] will just, you know, stay the long course because you know, Lyman Sheets will make something magical

[21:42] happen. So that's where we're at with Elvira. Now, I'm also hearing that the signature edition,

[21:47] the $15,000 edition of Elvira is going to come with a topper. People, this is amazing. Stern Pimbal

[21:56] is going to give you a topper for buying a game that costs them $3,000 to make. They're going to

[22:02] give you a topper on a game that they sold you for $15,000. Hallelujah. It's like people forgot

[22:08] that when we bought Batman SLE and Batman Ellie, both of those games came with the topper standard.

[22:15] Now, the question is, what will the topper be like? Will be as awesome as the Batman topper?

[22:21] And also, will they offer the topper to the Ellie people for sale? Here's what I think Stern's

[22:27] going to do. I think they're going to, they're going to make a topper for this signature people.

[22:31] I think they will offer that for sale exclusively to the Ellie people, but they're going to have to buy

[22:35] it separately. It's not going to come with the Ellie because we know it's not because they've

[22:40] already shipped Ellie's without it. But Stern's not stupid. They're not going to leave money on the

[22:45] table and you premium guys, they're not going to allow you to buy it. There's no way because if

[22:49] you bought a signature for $15,000, there's no way you want that, you want that topper to be

[22:57] exclusively to your signature edition. And I know this sounds crazy, but every little thing that's

[23:03] different on a signature series of viral is necessary to justify the value and makes the

[23:10] rarity even more valuable to those people. Because right now, signature buyers are grasping at straws

[23:17] trying to justify why they spent that much. I mean, maybe they could say, oh, I have one of only

[23:23] 50 toppers. Okay, they would happily, happily take that differentiator because they don't have enough

[23:29] to justify that game and not look like a sucker for spending that much money on the signature

[23:34] edition of the game. All right. Let's see. I'm also hearing there is new Ghostbusters code, which

[23:39] is not a rumor. It's actually happened. I think it came out this week. So they're continuing to

[23:44] polish the Ghostbusters code and the new code works, implements the topper more on the game.

[23:52] You know, look, Dwight just put out a complete overhaul of this game. And so the community has done

[23:56] a great job in sort of identifying some of the bugs and needed fixes in that new code. And Dwight

[24:04] is working hard on implementing all of those into the game. I'm hearing that monsters is going

[24:10] to receive a similar humongous code overhaul sometime in the future. I'm not sure when that's

[24:19] going to happen. But after Dwight is done with this, he's going to go overhaul the monsters,

[24:24] which is great. It's a little bit of a, you know, a day late in a dollar short. Is it a dollar

[24:30] short in a day late? I don't know. What is it? Which one is it? But you know what I mean? It's like

[24:35] the monster ship has sailed. I almost feel like it doesn't matter anymore what they do. Because the

[24:41] problem now for Stern is if you do it this way, if you launch a game that isn't complete or isn't

[24:48] the best version of itself, it's so silly to go back years later and try to revisit it because

[24:54] you're not going to sell new ones. I know why you're doing it. You want to make the people who own

[24:59] it happy. But maybe you should have just made them happy from the beginning. Maybe you should have

[25:03] just made the game the way it should have been made from the beginning. And I have a problem with

[25:08] that. I do. I have a problem with the way they rush these games out in ways that aren't fully

[25:13] thought through. They get all these people to buy before playing. And then people are sitting

[25:19] with a game that isn't the best example of what the game can be. And they have the weight and

[25:24] weight and weight while new games come out while more exciting games come out. And then years later,

[25:30] maybe the game will be revisited and made better. Maybe it won't. And it just sucks that you buy

[25:37] these expensive toys and you're just like you're just a guinea pig for the toy itself. And that these

[25:43] toys are being sold to us like in beta form that can just constantly be improved upon. But there's

[25:51] no guarantee of that. There's absolutely no guarantee that these manufacturers will do this. But look,

[25:56] if Munsters has an overhaul, I think it's great. I don't think it's going to matter though. I think

[26:01] people are going to have moved on. All right. So let's talk a little bit about Stern rumors. All right.

[26:07] So here's what's funny to me. And I put up my little poll on whether or not I should reveal to you

[26:13] the next Stern title. And on my Facebook page, I think right now I had like almost like 300 votes

[26:20] somewhere around the vicinity of like 80 like 5% of people said I should reveal to you the next

[26:26] Stern title. So that's that's that's overwhelming support from you guys that I should leak to you

[26:34] what Stern's next title is. I'm still thinking about it. And here's my quagmire. Here's my quagmire.

[26:39] It's like, all right, Kaneda guy with like a $200 mic in New York City who hasn't lifted a finger

[26:46] to work on this game can actually spoil the release of a game that they've been working on hard

[26:52] over there. Now that's that's like the the morality side of the fence. The other side of the

[26:58] fence is this for me. Stern Pimble as a company has blacklisted me. They've given me nothing.

[27:04] They don't let anyone talk to me. They don't give me any information. They they're not even they

[27:09] don't even communicate with me. You know, George Gomez does like, oh, you know, but I initiated. I

[27:14] talked and I think George is a great guy. You know, I'm nothing but respect for George Gomez.

[27:19] Zach Sharp gives me absolutely nothing. I understand why I understand why, but you know, I've extended

[27:26] the olive branch for over a year now to just try and get Stern to participate or give me something

[27:34] on this show. And they won't and they won't give me anything. They won't let anyone come on. They

[27:39] won't let anyone talk. And so why is it if I have a show that's about news and rumors and speculation

[27:46] and if you think about the news that people want the most, right? This the the information that

[27:52] everyone is craving the most is what are the next titles? That is the the gold. Those those are

[27:59] the diamonds of information in this in this industry. It's like if you're going to do a show like

[28:04] this, like that's what I look for. I live for those rumors and I love to speculate on what's next.

[28:11] And then if I get a rumor that sounds really solid about what Stern's next game is,

[28:17] why would I hold it back? Like what you know what I'm saying? What you listen to hear that news.

[28:24] So what I want you to do because I look, I know you vote it. You want it.

[28:29] Email me if you think I should do. I mean, I just I'm I'm torn. So here's what I'm thinking of

[28:33] doing on my way to Japan right before expo. I think I might just like let you know what I've heard

[28:40] the rumor is, right? I don't have a hundred percent confirmation. I'm going to be honest. I don't

[28:44] have a hundred percent confirmation. I haven't seen it. But maybe I'll just do what I always do. I'll

[28:49] just hear the rumor of what I'm hearing Stern's next game is. Okay. And here's why I should just do

[28:54] it because the game after this game, which I think is like the worst kept secret in Pimball is I'm

[29:01] hearing the rumor is John Borg is making teenage mutant Ninja Turtles with zombie Yeti as the artist.

[29:10] And then I hear that it has I think it has like ramps under the play field makes kind of sense.

[29:15] Like a sewer system turtles. I heard you're going to see stuff happening above and below the

[29:20] play field that's going to blow people away. I also heard it's going to have internet connection

[29:25] in it. So we'll see if that's true. Now again, these are rumors. This is what I'm hearing. I haven't

[29:31] seen it. You know, unless you see something with your own eyes, it's not like when people are

[29:34] passing around the Ghostbusters translate and everyone knew it was a thing and people are passing

[29:39] around the Ghostbusters CAD drawings. No, I haven't seen anything. So you do what you do. You take

[29:44] Canadian's rumors with a grain of salt, but that we but see we know that's next. Like that's the first

[29:50] game or first cornerstone game in 2020 is going to be the Borg Ninja Turtles. Now, I think that the

[29:58] next game will be revealed before the year is up. I don't know if it's going to ship before

[30:04] the year is up. So I could see Stern doing it in sometime November, December, and then shipping

[30:09] sometime in January. So look, I mean, maybe I know Stern listens to this show. So maybe like

[30:14] Zach has like a few days to reach out to me and say, Hey, Chris, like it'd be kind of cool. Like

[30:19] if you didn't share it, let's work together. All right. Maybe I could do Stern's insider

[30:24] pinball podcast that I bet nobody's listening to. Poor Nate, man, went from like having the number one

[30:29] show to being behind a firewall and just like doing podcasts now that, you know, who's finding

[30:36] that interesting where you're just like, it just doesn't make any sense to me because the world

[30:41] of podcasting, it's not even about like, you know, the guest or Nate or anything is just like the whole

[30:46] the whole notion that you have a podcast that's behind a login firewall is so stupid. And you know,

[30:52] the way the world works now is like you should be able to find your podcasts on iTunes,

[30:57] on SoundCloud, on Spotify to make people log in to listen to a podcast isn't how podcasting works.

[31:05] So for the biggest pinball company in the world to launch a podcast that is like hidden like that

[31:11] is is is so ignorant to the way in which people want to get their podcasts. So you know,

[31:17] that's another thing too. It's like Stern is always trying to just do it their way. And I love

[31:20] that Canadian pinball podcast is outside of their way. Like I can do it my way and there's nothing

[31:25] they can do to stop me. I love it. I think you love it too. All right. So what else is going on?

[31:30] The Star Wars art package. It's it's cool. I'll say this. I'll say this. When I hear people say

[31:37] this is how Star Wars art package always should have been. No, no, no, no, no, no, people. And maybe

[31:44] even I said that, but the more I think about it is this. This isn't Star Wars. This isn't the

[31:49] Star Wars stylized art that we grew up with. I don't know. Yes. Is this art package better

[31:56] than the Photoshop stuff we originally got? Absolutely. It's better. Absolutely.

[32:01] But this isn't like the kinds of Star Wars art that we crave. There is so much amazing

[32:07] Star Wars art. If you go on Deviant Art and just just search for Star Wars, they could have done

[32:13] such a better job with the Star Wars art package. I know they were given stuff by Lucas and this

[32:18] is like a Lucas cartoon artist. But when I think of Star Wars, I don't think of cartoon animated

[32:24] artwork. I don't. Do you know? So like it is neat, but it's not it's not what it always should have

[32:32] been. And even though it is neat, I don't think anything's going to help make this game become

[32:36] more desirable. Just the game itself. It's just it's still in my mind. Star Wars is the number one.

[32:44] Biggest mistake and biggest like flop in the history of Stern. And I'll tell you why because

[32:50] it's Star Wars. It's the most popular entertainment franchise of all time. And it's it was just so

[32:56] poorly thought out on every level from the design to the coding. I just think the game was a complete

[33:03] miss. And he was what I don't get. Here's what I don't get. How if you're Stern Pimble and you have

[33:08] the biggest property of all time. Okay. How do you like I get that Steve Richie probably had 10

[33:17] year there. So he probably had first dibs at it. All right. But then when you code the game,

[33:24] how do you give Star Wars the biggest franchise in the history of franchises? How do you give that

[33:30] to Dwight and not to Lyman Sheets? Like how do you not say why isn't our greatest coder of all time?

[33:38] Coding the greatest theme of all time because if you think about Lyman, it's almost like

[33:45] regardless of layout, regardless of toys, he's going to make the game amazing. And Lyman knows

[33:50] how to work with clips. He knows that it take you through a journey and and they had people

[33:56] forget this. They had Star Wars. All of the assets you needed. They had all the movie clips.

[34:03] They had synced up video with actors. They had call outs. They had the theme song. Everything

[34:08] you could want from an asset standpoint on the screen they had. And the way they coded it

[34:14] was a jumbled mess. It just was stacking scenes. Like what's going on here? I want to be Luke Skywalker

[34:21] going through the three movies to defeat the Emperor. The game is like nothing about that.

[34:27] It's all about scoring. How do you take the greatest sci-fi journey and hero story of all time

[34:34] and make it a stupid game about pinball scoring? What the f people? Lyman would have made it magical.

[34:43] But that's you know it's it's crazy to me because Lyman's not even doing cornerstones. He's

[34:47] like doing a viral which is like probably which will be a low volume game for Stern. When you hear

[34:54] what's next and when you hear Ninja Turtles, what wouldn't you rather have Lyman do Ninja Turtles

[34:58] or another like iconic theme that you've been waiting for? I don't get it. I don't get how they

[35:03] make these decisions over there. All right. Oh, Kaneda 35 minutes. You know let's go on to the

[35:08] next topic on Kaneda's pinball podcast. So the clear code issue. Is it gone? I just saw someone

[35:14] share photos of their Batman catwoman edition and it looks horrible. I mean horrible. And so this

[35:21] is a topic that I kind of feel like you know obviously we we carried the torch on the play field

[35:28] clear code issues. We were banging on the doors of manufacturers to get people in answer. We got

[35:34] Jersey Jack to respond. Stern never really fully responded. I think Stern's strategy is to be

[35:40] silent on this and to take care of customers as they have problems. I just saw that Stern is

[35:45] actually sending a Jurassic Park owner who had bad clear code issues. A fully populated play field

[35:54] that their distributor will be installing for them and doing the swap for the customer. So we

[35:59] know Stern is going to take care of people that have serious issues with this. My question is just

[36:05] this like is the problem solved? Like it will removing artwork from under the post solve this problem.

[36:12] When I see how sort of soft and easy that clear code is pulling and chipping on that cat woman,

[36:20] man it's something is wrong. Something is wrong and like I hope it's just about removing art from

[36:26] the post. But I still think the proper testing has not been done. And I think if you just bought

[36:32] an Elvira like I want to know from Elvira owners what the play field clear code is like. Because

[36:38] we almost have to wait and see with each new game what what the fix has been and if the fix is

[36:44] working. All right. Okay. What else is going on in Pimball? Jersey Jack Pimball. Let's talk a little

[36:50] bit about Jersey Jack Pimball. So Jersey Jack has new Willy Wonka code. I think it's like 1.26 is out.

[36:59] So that is good. I'm hearing from people that there's a lot of new call outs. There's a lot of new

[37:05] clips from the movie. No none of the clips with the call outs are synced up. We've let that. We're

[37:10] going to let that go. I'm not going to slam them for that. I think people are having a lot of fun

[37:15] with the game. I hear that from the owners. Okay. I want to spend more time on a Willy Wonka. I've told

[37:20] you I'm going to stop looking at it through the lens of like synced up video and music. It should be

[37:26] the musical that we all love. It is what it is. It is what it is. I'm not going to beat a dead horse.

[37:31] Here's a question I have though. And this is just this just popped into my head as I thought about

[37:36] what I've been reading in the Willy Wonka thread. And I think it's an interesting topic to discuss.

[37:41] So let me ask you a question. When you buy something, let's say you buy a car. You buy the first

[37:46] model year of a car. I'll give you an example. I bought a Honda Civic Type R. And you know one of

[37:54] the annoying things about the Honda Civic Type R first model year is that there's no knob for

[38:01] the stereo volume. There's no knob at all. The knobs are for the climate control. And you have to

[38:06] hit this screen to turn the volume up and down. So in model year two, they listen to all the feedback

[38:13] of people who bought the first model year. And they made changes and put a volume knob in the game.

[38:18] Now let me ask you a question about Pimball. Why is it that a Pimball machine that is made for

[38:25] multiple years that after being out in the marketplace, consumers can give the manufacturers feedback

[38:34] on things that are working and things that are not working. What if some of that feedback is based

[38:41] on how the game is physically designed? Okay. So I'll give you an example with Willy Wonka.

[38:47] We are hearing from people that the way the ball exits the pop bumper area in Willy Wonka

[38:54] leads to the ball almost 100% of the time draining straight down the middle. So people are very

[39:02] frustrated. It's not fun. It seems like a cheap poor design in the game. And so with all that

[39:10] feedback, if you're a company, why is it that when we have feedback when something might be ill

[39:16] designed that there is never any attempt to make any changes to a design flaw in a game that it

[39:25] just remains that way because that. Okay. Right. So just let's just stop there. We know this is an

[39:33] issue. So I get what people would say is well, if you design, change it moving forward, then what do

[39:38] you do for all the people who bought the first model year? And so that's an interesting dilemma,

[39:45] right? Because it happens to people in so many other areas of life. Like when you buy a car,

[39:52] and then they make the car a little bit better than next model year, like it's kind of like,

[39:55] well, that's just that's just how it is. But in Pimball, if there is a design flaw or something

[40:02] that just sucks, it will never be revisited because of fear that then you can't you know, you

[40:09] screw over the early adopters. And I get it. Like I get it. Like they sell tens of thousands of cars.

[40:15] So it's different. But this is just something I'm curious to see like what your thoughts are on

[40:21] this. Like should Jersey Jack go back and try to find a way, right? And maybe they can maybe they

[40:27] can even like find a way to put a post somewhere or bend something somehow or design something that

[40:34] will fix that cheap drain in the game. And I've said it before. I mean, I've always felt that Pimball

[40:41] is hard enough. And when you design a Pimball machine to drain cheaply just for operators to make

[40:48] more money, I think that's really, really bad design. I think there's no place for that in Pimball.

[40:54] I think you should make a game harder by giving people the ability to remove posts like in the

[40:59] out lanes. You can make games harder in many different ways. But to design it to be extremely cheap,

[41:06] sucks. And I think everyone feels that way. Even though my boy Derek's like, oh no, me and the white

[41:11] have phone just keeps slapping the machine. It's like so Derek, what are you doing? Be like trying

[41:16] to watch a movie and your seat keeps moving. You have to keep fighting it to sit still. It's stupid.

[41:21] It's stupid. It's a bad design. Can we just call it what it is? All right. All right. I want to end

[41:28] this podcast talking about my friends news show Pimball Cribs. All right. Now some of you out there

[41:37] might not realize this, but Zach, many and I are friends and we talk all the time and we jab back

[41:43] and forth at each other. You might have heard my last podcast in which I fictionally interviewed

[41:49] Mr. Zach, many. Look, he's invited to come on the show. He said he'd come on and debate me. He

[41:54] just won't. So we do what we do to sort of make fun of each other. He does it passive aggressively.

[42:00] I just do it directly. So all that, all that being said on this Monday night's edition of the

[42:06] Flippin' Outstream, it was the world premiere of Pimball Cribs and they built this thing up. I

[42:12] mean, there was like, there was a movie marquee. They made the whole show about it. There was no

[42:17] streaming of another game. It was all about Pimball Cribs. And so those like, I mean, it was hype.

[42:22] It was great. I mean, Zach is a hype man. I mean, they built everything up. They got everybody in.

[42:26] I mean, when I say everybody, it's like, there's like a hundred people watching live. It's not like,

[42:30] you know, thousands of people. And then they aired it. And I want to give my feedback on it because

[42:35] I said I would. I let you guys give your feedback on my Facebook page. But here's here's my thing.

[42:40] Here's my thing. So for 15 minutes, we get walk through. His name was Chris. I believe we walk

[42:46] through his house. We're in his kitchen. We're seeing his cheesets. We're seeing his booze. We're

[42:52] seeing his like wine rack holder. We're seeing his poker table. We're seeing what's in his refrigerator.

[42:59] It's this like slow motion sort of, you know, walk through his home to get to the

[43:06] game room and the basement and all this stuff. All right. Here's my thing. Do I think Pimball

[43:12] Cribs is an interesting concept? Absolutely. I do. I think it's really cool to see people's

[43:16] game rooms. One of my favorite threads on Pinside is the game room thread. I think that's one of

[43:22] my favorite threads. I think it's one of the most exciting things to look at. I love seeing how

[43:28] people around America and around the world design their homes to incorporate these games we love.

[43:34] I think it's awesome. Some people have million dollar budgets to do it. Some people just have like

[43:40] a hundred bucks. You know, that's why I love this hobby. It covers the spectrum. You know,

[43:45] not you can be richer poor. It doesn't matter. You can have a really fun thing in your house.

[43:50] And I love that. I mean, you know me. I mean, I turn my bedroom into an arcade. I love it.

[43:55] When adult men still have items that make them feel young again, I praise that. And I also think

[44:03] it's so much fun when someone's house and home reflects that side of their personality, right?

[44:08] I've always found like boring homes boring. I love it when you walk into someone's house and you see

[44:13] a collection or some unique items. All right. So the concept is great. You know, Zach is like

[44:17] making a video version of that thread, which I'm like, this is an awesome concept. Okay. The execution

[44:24] of that concept, I thought was a bit cringe worthy. And I told this is Zach. I'm like, I don't

[44:29] understand. Like they're trying to do that like sarcastic like MTV crib. He's kind of like trying

[44:34] to be boastful, but it just didn't work. And not only that, it's like, you know, that whole thing

[44:41] could have been like three to five minutes. Like why did it have to be 14, 15 minutes long? Like it

[44:48] was just drawn out. And you're like kind of, you're like, you're like in this long prolonged sort

[44:54] of joke that's just not working. And it never like starts to and like the only time I like felt

[45:01] like it started to work a little bit is when you actually show people the game room. And then here's

[45:05] the thing that happened. You know, the music was like so cringe worthy. I'm like, what is going on?

[45:10] Like anyway. And look, it's the pilot episode. I get it. Like this is this is his first attempt.

[45:17] But here's the thing. And then what happens on the flipping out stream is everyone comes on

[45:24] and says how amazing it is, how incredible it is, how this is going to expand the pinball market,

[45:30] how everyone should go on their social media channels right now and share, share, share it.

[45:34] Like let's get it out there. We need to expand pinball. This is going to expand pinball. And I

[45:39] really just wanted to be like, what the f are people? Like are you what's wrong with people?

[45:44] How is this going to expand pinball? You know, and I'm not saying this to be like a jerk and

[45:53] I'm not saying this. But this is what I do for a living. I help brands expand their product into

[46:00] new new homes, into new customers, reach new targets. And how is this going to expand pinball?

[46:08] So if I were to sit in a room and say, well, who's our target for this video?

[46:12] And I don't know. What what guys, what what like middle age white guys who have homes who don't

[46:18] know they can put a pinball machine in it are going to watch this video and be like, oh, I can

[46:21] have that too. Do those people really exist? Like people are not sure that they can actually put

[46:26] games in their homes. I don't know. And like if the content's not good, like if it's just not

[46:32] good, how is that going to do anything for you? Right? How is that going to expand pinball?

[46:39] And and and instead of giving like constructive feedback to Zach, everyone's just like blowing

[46:44] smoke up his ass initially. And I know like it's hard because Zach is on there watching it live

[46:50] with everybody. And nobody wants to speak poorly in in you know, to the creator. Right? It's like,

[46:59] like I get it. We I create content. Zach creates content. All of us who make pinball content.

[47:06] Once you make pinball content, you are open to criticism and critique. And it's out there.

[47:12] I mean, I'm confident in what I make. If people don't like it, cool. They don't have to listen.

[47:16] If people want to give me feedback, cool, you know, I'll think about it. And I told Zach, like,

[47:21] I'm going to give you feedback, bro. I'm going to give you feedback because not only do I work with

[47:26] some really talented video producers all the time. I mean, I'm in an industry of content creation.

[47:31] So I look, I said to him, here's the here's the thing that you need to make this thing shorter.

[47:36] It doesn't need to be this long. You need to lose like the like the attempt at sort of sarcasm or like

[47:42] trying to make the guy seem like he's like a like a celebrity like like he's bragging about what he has.

[47:48] Like I just didn't work. Like it just felt like he was trying to like why not just be himself?

[47:52] Like I you don't need to pretend to be someone you're not. I also thought that, you know, the music

[47:59] got to you got to find new music. I also felt that like no one you got to you got to you got to you

[48:04] got to like give people what they want. Like no one gives a sh I'm not going to curse. No one cares

[48:09] about what's in a guy's refrigerator. Like I get it like in crib. They would do that. They would

[48:13] open up the refrigerator and show all the crystal and they would show the garage and the whips and

[48:17] then this it's you can't like are you trying to parody cribs and then shoehorn in pinball for 10

[48:24] minutes. It just felt like it was trying to do so much. And if you're a target you're if you're

[48:30] target are people who love pinball. They're going to be frustrated because it's like a slow motion

[48:35] like train wreck to get there. And then and even when you're there those people I don't know like

[48:41] just seeing the games and slow mode like what there's just so much better content out there

[48:46] that shows people pinball machines in homes right. And so I don't know and I also said this is

[48:53] Zach like the most important thing was this if I if I already give him one piece of feedback on it

[48:57] he needs to be on camera like Zach's whole thing is he's the personality. Zach many is the

[49:04] personality. Canada is the personality. Jack danger is the personality. Okay you can't remove

[49:12] that from your content. If you do it's not working you're not a see Zach is in he's like an

[49:17] actor. He's the entertainer on the entertainer. He's not the director. Are you trying to direct

[49:23] entertainment. It's not working. And and I told him that. And I think he can make it work.

[49:30] If he steps in front of the camera. If he loses the don't just lose the stick like when him and

[49:35] Greg talk on their show they're funny enough. They don't need they don't need clowns behind them

[49:40] dancing in the background. He is entertaining enough to interview people about their home arcades

[49:46] and their crib. He's entertaining enough to do it in an authentic way. The whole thing just

[49:52] felt like a cheap trick that wasn't working. And that's my feedback. And I hope he listens to it

[49:57] and I do I look forward to seeing more episodes of it because I do I think the concept is great.

[50:04] And I think people will watch it and I think going into people's homes will work. And I also want

[50:10] you out there who just blows smoke up everybody's ass who makes any bit of pinball content. I want

[50:16] you guys to understand something. Expanding this hobby always seems to be the fallback people use

[50:22] whenever they do anything in pinball. Well we're just expanding the hobby like people need to be

[50:26] aware. I want everyone just to shut up with that phrase like we need to expand pinball shut up.

[50:32] You know who's expanding pinball stern pinball by making like 10,000 plus games a year

[50:37] putting them out there and you know how much they do in terms of content creation zero for the most

[50:42] part the content they make is the goddamn machine. Okay. Pinside Robin is expanding the hobby.

[50:49] Oh yeah everyone likes to slam pinside pinside sucks. If it weren't for pinside pinball

[50:55] fanatics would have nowhere to go nowhere to go to talk to people to feel part of a community to

[51:01] get tips on how to fix games to get mods nowhere. If you look I'm going to say this Robin has done more

[51:09] to expand pinball and build a pinball community than almost all of us combined in the pinball

[51:15] media world without him I wouldn't be here without that site I wouldn't have found you guys the

[51:21] listeners. So that expands pinball companies making games expands pinball maybe some of these

[51:27] podcasts do I do not think pinball podcasts really expand pinball I think people who are not into it

[51:32] would get would find this cringe worthy okay. But you know it also expands pinball the supreme

[51:38] partnership expanded pinball's exposure more than anything the supreme the American girl pinball

[51:45] machine that I just saw and Jeremy star in influencer with millions of followers has pinball in

[51:52] his own those three things will expand the exposure of pinball more than all of this sort of like

[51:59] pinball content that the pinball media is creating. But here's my last point on this topic and then

[52:04] I'll let you go pinball is doing just fine pinball is is experiencing a golden age right now it

[52:14] is expanding there are more manufacturers now there are more games there's more people excited about

[52:18] this hobby it's doing just fine okay I think what some people are trying to do is get people who

[52:26] don't give two craps about pinball to be into pinball and I think there's also an ignorance there's

[52:33] an ignorance that this will survive for decades it's not it's not I get it if you're a pinball

[52:39] distributor and you want to keep pinball district you want a pinball distribute for the next 20 years

[52:45] I'm telling you you've got to come up with a plan B in life you might have another five to ten

[52:50] years of it but there is no way there's no way this market is going to stay healthy and growing

[52:57] for for decades and decades to come you have to see the writing on the wall it doesn't matter how many

[53:04] at these price points at what kids care about at where culture is going there is no way

[53:12] this market will survive at this level for much longer and you know it and yet bye bye bye you want

[53:18] you know and the thing is this the only way can ever expand is you need to get the prices lower

[53:24] there's no way it's going to keep expanding at these prices but when you tell people zack that like a

[53:29] fifteen thousand dollar machine or ten thousand dollar machine is like it is worth it you're just going

[53:34] to keep you know like you're going to keep pushing more and more people away from the hobby if we

[53:40] keep endorsing these games that don't have the value and are just unobtainable for for 99% of the

[53:46] country I mean how many people except for the wealthy wake up and can just go drop 15 grand on a

[53:51] pinball machine I get there are plenty that we know about but wake up people the majority of kids

[53:58] coming out of college are buried in debt they're not they're not they're not you tell them a pinball

[54:03] machine is fifteen thousand dollars and they will start crying in front of you how how stupid that is

[54:10] all right I heard everyone I want to just end by saying you know I'm sorry we want to give our

[54:17] condolences to Steve at pinball refinery I know he just lost a really good friend and a father

[54:22] to cancer we want Steve want to say our condolences it sucks hate hate hate cancer have had lost too
