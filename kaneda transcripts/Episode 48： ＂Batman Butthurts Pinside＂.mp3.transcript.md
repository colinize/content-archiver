[00:00] Great news. I don't need surgery for my hemorrhoids, but Dr. said they're not that serious.

[00:05] He said use preparation age. Preparation age help shrink swelling of tissues as it often relieves pain and ditching for hours.

[00:11] Aren't you glad you didn't need surgery? Preparation age.

[00:14] Oh my god, get out the preparation age because there are so many pinciders right now whose butts are hurt.

[00:31] They're just like they're inflamed. They can't understand why Gary Stern just strapped on a ginormous one and rammed it up their collective buttholes.

[00:43] But that is what is happening right now. It is amazing. It is amazing. I love reading PINSIDE whenever Stern announces a new PINBALL machine because in that moment it does one thing and one thing only.

[00:56] It simply exposes the hypocrisy and the predictable nature of the PINBALL collector.

[01:05] That's what we're going to talk about on episode 48 of Canadian PINBALL podcast which I'm going to title Batman Butthurts PINSIDE and let's get right to it.

[01:18] So we talked a little bit yesterday about the details of Batman 66.

[01:24] Now I want to start out this episode by saying I have an update on the machine. There's going to be 240 LE's for Batman 66.

[01:34] They are sold out. Sold out. If you contact your distributor I guarantee you will have a hard time finding one. There may be a few out there but I have contacted some of the biggest distributors and they have none left for sale.

[01:49] I'll tell you why. These things sold out from what I'm being told months ago.

[01:54] People knew that this title was going to happen. Same way people knew Ghostbusters was coming and people put money down on the LE.

[02:03] Now the fact that there's only 240 we're going to talk about that and what that means and why I think it sold out so fast is pretty freaking obvious.

[02:10] Stern has become a master at understanding the collecting community and the supply and demand issues that will impact collecting communities.

[02:18] So sold out. Now the 30 super duper LE's that they're going to make to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Stern Pimball.

[02:29] Those are going to be selected. Hand selected I'm being told by Gary Stern himself.

[02:35] And that I think is super freaking cool. I mean this is Gary's company 30 years. This is a dream theme for a lot of people.

[02:44] A lot is going into this game and it's a thank you from him to the people that have stood by him.

[02:50] And I love what effect that is having on the community and what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast is something I can never really do on Pinside is we're going to respond to what people are saying on the forum.

[03:05] You can't really do this on the site. We all know why because once you call people out or say what the truth is you get the right ejected or you're not being nice.

[03:13] But I just want to read for you guys what some of the people's reactions are to the Batman 66 announcement that came out yesterday and just to reiterate for those of you who haven't listened to the previous podcast.

[03:28] They're going to make a Batman 66 theme Pimball machine. There's going to be a premium. There's going to be 240 LE's and then there's going to be 30 super LE's.

[03:39] The game is going to come with two LCDs and it's going to be we're not it says all new design with new toys but we know it's going to be Gomez and Lyme and working on it.

[03:48] And it comes out in November and we're going to see it at expo. Okay so what was the reaction why did so many Pinsiders get but heard.

[03:57] You know what's interesting is when Stern put up the the flyer or not Stern but when someone posted it was a distributor it got a lot of upvotes like 20 like eight upvotes no downvotes.

[04:07] Okay and some people you know are just really really still upset and we we saw this we knew this would happen because of Ghostbusters issues and I think everyone was speculating how much of an impact would Ghostbusters issues have on the next Stern title and a lot of people out there who moaned and grown and complained being like you're not going to get my sales Stern I'm freezing my new inbox order.

[04:32] Those people I think actually believed that they they were going to be able to make an impact on Stern and that Stern would like listen to them and Stern would be affected by their moaning and groaning on Pinside and the fact that Batman has sold out already just shows that Stern doesn't really need your one or two or three or ten pissed off people are not going to change the fact that as long as they keep offering new titles and they offer these great themes and they make certain.

[05:02] In versions of them limited they're going to sell them they're going to sell every single one okay so let's read some of the feedback from Pinside so this one's interesting because this is I believe Jeff from the pinball podcast and he wrote sort of feels like Stern is just pissing on fans at this point they have highly questionable QA going on and they want you to start putting deposits down on games going forward oh and they are going to invite some people to buy a game.

[05:30] So they'll reach out to you when they want you to buy something but when they can't bother to talk to you like a human if you have an issue with their products total joke of a company right now that's what Jeff wrote wow I mean he's slamming Stern right here calling them a joke of a company look and I get it Jeff like you bought Ghostbusters Ellie new inbox you spend a lot of money and their communication and their quality control around that pinball machine has been questionable and I think the guys like this have every right to be pinballing.

[06:00] They're not going to stop but Stern's not a joke of a company and I think that's the part that we covered this on the Pinside babies episode these people who just want to blanket insult Stern are really just acting like fucking children and at what point will they just relax Stern is working on a fix for Ghostbusters they haven't they're not shipping anymore Ghostbusters right now I'm waiting on mine those who are waiting on their Ellie's we've waited the entire month of August and I heard it could be another comment on this.

[06:30] I'm not going to talk about it in a couple weeks but that's because they're fixing the problem and they're going to deal with the issue you know when they have everything figured out and they're ready to roll out the program now for people like Jeff and people like KPG we're going to read what he wrote in this thread he uh they're just impatient they expect like an immediate solve or something that happened right away and I get Stern's communication could be better but the call to the total joke of a company I think is ridiculous and when he wrote that he got 22 up votes and he got

[07:00] no down votes and I think that's another thing that's indicative of Pinside is you've got these like anti-stern people who are just hating on the company now more than ever and I think that most of the people that are on the anti-stern bandwagon right now they're not like Stern fans who are just upset about Ghostbusters quality I think there's just a lot of fucking jealousy that's going to be developing on the community right now because what Batman 66 is going to do it's going to divide

[07:29] the pinball world between the haves and the have nots now I look I think that the vision has already started to take place regardless um we're going to talk a little bit about that on this podcast but this is becoming if it is not already it's a hobby for rich white dudes for the most part and I have yet to see anything to the contrary of that that if you are going to collect

[07:53] new in box at these prices you should be clearing a lot of money every year and have a lot of extra money to then put into pinball this should not be something that you buy

[08:04] you know and live paycheck to paycheck on so all right another upset

[08:09] pin cider another person who's a little but heard here is Robo Tron and he wrote gonna take my 10k elsewhere a big F you Stern after kiss and Ghostbusters lemon

[08:22] addition shame on me shame shame shame you ain't gonna get a single cent more a special L.E. Wow what makes it special you're gonna play

[08:31] tested for an hour and add a couple of fifteen dollar toys fix your Ghostbusters problems and get some new code out for the suckers please

[08:40] like again Stern doesn't give a shit they're sold out they are sold out of the L.E.s of Batman and the super L.E.s every single person who gets invited to buy one is gonna buy one you be an

[08:55] idiot not to buy one and and if you buy one I guarantee you'll be able to flip it for more than you paid so I mean

[09:03] stir basically what Gary's doing is he's saying to the people who stuck with me I'm gonna give you something that's gonna be

[09:09] worth more the instant you get it then then what you even paid for he's basically paying people back for being a fan of

[09:17] Stern Pimball I think it's a genius move I think Stern can corner the collecting market if they do it right and I think we've seen them

[09:27] sort of do it right I think they learned from Tron L.E. that when you make a L.E.s special and unique to an L.E. you're gonna get way more

[09:36] demand I mean Stern's not dumb there wasn't that much different in Tron L.E. than Tron Pro from a cost perspective right but when you see

[09:45] Tron Pro selling used for 5,000 and Tron L.E.s selling for 15,000 dollars Stern is like what the fuck we just left like 9,000 dollars on the table because we created a

[09:58] limited supply and we're seeing that now we're seeing it more and more now there's certain games where like the L.E.s like kind of

[10:04] questionable like do you really get what what what it can be considered in L.E. I don't know I don't know I mean I think ghost

[10:13] busters L.E. even though there's not much different there's nothing different on the play field the different art package is

[10:17] totally worth it ghost busters L.E. looks 10 times better than ghost busters premium ghost busters premium I don't even think looks

[10:24] better than ghost busters pro in terms of the cabinet art and I think when you see that L.E. in in people's collections it pops like

[10:31] Noah there's Stern so I think it's totally worth it I think anyone who has a ghost busters premium really wishes they had a

[10:37] ghost busters L.E. and I think the ones who go on there and cry and moan and get you about the

[10:43] green armor I just fucking jealous I gotta be honest I think Batman is a great theme I think I'm really excited by this new

[10:49] pin with the LCDs and the old theme and if I was gonna want one I want I want the super L.E. I want it and I

[10:56] simply want it because I can't have it I simply want it because I know I won't be invited to get it so what

[11:03] does that mean if I want to collect something that only a few people have of course I want to have the one

[11:09] that's very limited and for those of you out there who think that Stern has to do a million different

[11:15] alterations to these limited additions to warrant the price you're you're freaking wrong guys that's not

[11:21] how it works anyone collect baseball cards ever see the baseball card community

[11:25] um like tops they would make special edition cards it was just like a different card it would be like a

[11:33] gold version of a card and maybe they're gonna make five gold versions of a berry bonds card right and

[11:40] they're gonna put that into distribution and there's only five in the world now immediately just to have

[11:46] one of those five makes the prices super super high so for Stern if Stern knows that there's what a

[11:52] few thousand pinball collectors in the world and there are definitely more than 30 collectors out

[11:59] there who buy a lot of new and box Stern pinball machines for for them to make only 30 of a super

[12:04] Ellie version of Batman it's it's gonna make the prices of that game skyrocket and and for people

[12:13] the bitch and mone why who's gonna be unhappy just the people that probably would never be invited in

[12:20] the first place you can't even like really afford it you know and then the Ellie's are gonna sell

[12:24] out and and be you know special too because there's only 240 of them and imagine if half of those

[12:30] go overseas and half go to America you're talking just 120 and I think what upsets people too and this

[12:36] is something that people really don't want to say but someone did actually say it um it's that all

[12:41] of a sudden now we're on to the next we're on to the next so that special feeling you had when you

[12:47] bought ghost busters is it still around right is is I mean Stern doesn't really he doesn't let new

[12:54] in box buyers have the spotlight for very long it's part of the reasons why I think people love

[13:01] Stern it's part of the reason why people are frustrated with Stern you got these guys in the corner

[13:05] being like what about my kiss Ellie remember when that was the darling uh and then you know they

[13:11] didn't you got game of thrones which people just still hate the artwork and no one really gives a

[13:16] shit about that tight anymore and you know then you got like ghost busters just took over the world

[13:21] but now it's like well holy crap right right now everyone's focus is on Batman and and and that's

[13:27] an it's an interesting thing because if you buy a Jersey Jack pinball machine you've got like two

[13:33] to three years to to have the latest Jack machine before you're gonna see the next one same thing

[13:38] with Dutch same thing with even like highway like nobody else is shipping pins and volume where

[13:44] you're only gonna have the hot new one for just a few months and I think that's that's that's

[13:50] that's like I think hard on the collector who always wants to have the hot new thing now the

[13:56] the what person's post who I just laughed out loud was frolic because the first person that came to

[14:02] mind when I'm like oh my god like who's gonna be excited because they're probably gonna get invited

[14:07] by Gary Stern to get a super Ellie and it's like it's gotta be fro like like if anyone deserves

[14:13] it it's this guy because he buys one he buys all the new inboxes as soon as they come out and he

[14:17] just writes we that's it his first comment in the Batman thread was w e e e e e we I mean he's super

[14:25] fucking excited this is like this is a feeling fro like every new inbox purchase you've been doing

[14:31] it's been leading you to this moment you will now be invited into the secret secret exclusive club

[14:37] of a super Ellie I mean that kind of news makes a guy like this bust a nut because it all

[14:45] the sudden like rationalizes and justifies everything everything he's been building up for has led to

[14:52] this moment and I bet I hope he gets the call I mean I think if Gary doesn't invite a frolic

[14:59] into the super Ellie club fro like might burn down Stern's factory because this guy is like the

[15:06] most obsessed new inbox collector by Stern but but that's look fro like is the future of like

[15:12] what or the target for Gary if you guys you guys like honestly you you bitch out of both sides

[15:19] your mouth Pinside people for a lot of people are like well first of all the people moaning about

[15:23] that there's no pro here this is a collectors edition only like if you can't figure that out then

[15:30] you're just like you need some help I mean this is not Stern is making this pinball machine

[15:36] primarily for the collectors which is why the focus is there there's gonna be premiums that if

[15:42] you want to throw premium on location fine but there's no pro so you got these guys all but hurt

[15:46] who are like oh well Stern doesn't even make a game for me now I'm a pro buyer like if you're a

[15:51] pro buyer they're not gonna stop making pro versions of games but Stern realizes and they've

[15:59] smartly that they've got to sell so many more pros to make money on then then these like Ellie

[16:07] versions which they the profit margins have to be better for them and there's there's so many more

[16:13] collectors out there I don't even understand why anyone would ever buy a ghost buster's pro I mean

[16:17] honestly there's the the Magnus things the features that everyone really wants are in the premium

[16:24] and it's what like fifteen hundred dollars more two thousand dollars more if you can't afford two

[16:29] thousand dollars more to get the machine with all the goodies in it that I'm sorry but like you

[16:34] shouldn't be buying fucking pinball machines you shouldn't I mean it just reminds me of people who

[16:40] like who buy like expensive cars but go for the cheap interior it's like no like they're I just

[16:46] think there's a point when you're buying like a five thousand dollar toy like you should be able to

[16:51] go for the sixty five hundred dollar one because all of it all of it isn't is an inconsequential

[16:57] purchase it's this is not a necessity it's a luxury um but you know frolic is super freaking happy

[17:06] but you know there's more but heard people and these but heard people are usually the ones that

[17:11] that talk so much on pen slides so Dave age I mean Dave age is he's really but heard he writes nope

[17:17] and nope what an awesome theme I used to love the Batman TV show it's some campy fun however this

[17:24] just feels wrong I never cared for the crane on TDK it feels the same as Mick on a stick to me

[17:32] but it is the outright gouge of getting rid of the pro version and replacing it with a super

[17:38] elite that just it just feels wrong to me and yes I get that certain wants to cut down volume

[17:43] on increasing profit and getting rid of the pro versions is a great way to fix their supply issues

[17:48] increase profit per machine means the same money from less work good luck with that

[17:54] like I don't get it like how does this feel wrong I mean these people and it gets seven

[18:00] upvotes for that comment with no downvotes who does this feel wrong do other than the freaking person

[18:06] you can't afford it I mean it's just it's just stupid like you you know Stern's a business you

[18:12] know Stern has to do certain things to stay in business and then to keep new machines coming out

[18:17] it feels wrong to you it feels wrong okay Gary's gonna laugh all the way to the fucking bank that's

[18:23] how wrong it's gonna feel Dave age what would you have done Dave age I think with all these

[18:28] bitters and moaners on pen side it's like what the fuck would you do if you ran Stern and you knew

[18:34] there were people out there who would be super excited to spend more money on limited edition games

[18:39] and special super your duper elies you wouldn't do it I'm so you know it's just so annoying and it's

[18:45] so hypocritical because these guys are all just a bunch of fucking babies because they all have this

[18:50] sort of notion that you know these companies should do it for the love of pinball they shouldn't

[18:54] do this they shouldn't make a profit they shouldn't gouge the collecting community Stern's not dumb

[19:00] they realize that the target for a collectible pinball machines is rich white men who are frequently

[19:11] bored they're frequently bored with their lives and they need something new every few months

[19:17] to to satiate their fix it's like a drug opening up a new inbox pinball machine for these guys

[19:24] and Stern knows that these guys will spend far more than $8,000 $9,000 you guys want to talk about a

[19:33] bubble bursting for collectors it's not gonna fucking burst for collectors the only people that are

[19:37] gonna be squeezed out of the market are the pro buyers who are gonna see the price of pros increase

[19:45] and also like the people who are just gonna realize like it's it's you're not gonna get your money

[19:50] back unused pros and used you know regular additions or premiums anymore with a vine of new pins

[19:55] coming out you know so but are those the people that should be even buying pinball machines in the

[20:01] first place so look I think people are in for rude awakening and Gary Stern also is not an idiot

[20:10] Gary Stern could do what John Papa Duke wanted to do tomorrow if he wanted to do it without even

[20:17] having to spend any real money on R&D without having to change a shitload of stuff Gary Stern tomorrow

[20:24] could announce that we're going to make Star Wars pinball and we are going to make listen to this

[20:32] and tell me if you disagree we are going to make a special super limited edition version of Star Wars

[20:41] pinball and it's gonna be called the Knights of Ren edition okay and Kylo Ren's Posse has like

[20:49] 20 members in it and we are going to make 20 special Kylo Ren Knights of Ren edition machines

[20:57] that are gonna have some special feature could have a couple extra modes imagine that imagine how

[21:04] easy it would be for Gary to put a few modes in to have linemen whoever code some modes that

[21:11] aren't available in any other machine except for this super Knights of Ren edition put it in the

[21:17] game have maybe one toy in there let's say he puts two thousand dollars extra into each Knights

[21:24] of Ren edition we're only going to make 20 they're going to be by invitation only and they're

[21:31] going to cost 20 thousand dollars imagine that what would happen what would happen

[21:40] he would sell every single one there's only 20 it's got exclusive modes exclusive artworks some

[21:48] exclusive toys every single one it would become the most sought after version of that pinball now

[21:55] some of you guys out there might say this is wrong this is wrong then all the people who buy

[22:01] LEDs won't feel like they have a special game because there's one nicer this is wrong because

[22:05] these people who have this one it's not wrong it's what the collector community will buy that will

[22:14] determine whether it's right or wrong and in every other industry I follow there's always these

[22:18] very limited limited limited variations that command the highest price and that does not impact the

[22:24] sale of the regular ones it does not impact the sale of the other limited versions but they but

[22:29] Gary could sell 20 at 20 thousand dollars of the Knights of Ren edition Star Wars and that's

[22:36] some free advice for you Gary you should do it now look what John Papadick was trying to do right

[22:41] sells 16 games at 16 thousand dollars and what happened people gave him money without seeing a

[22:48] thing people already paid for it so this whole notion two of like I'm not going to pre-order a

[22:53] machine until I see it bullshit Batman is sold out sold out no one seen a playfield no one

[22:59] seen anything and and and and and Pinside user Flato said it he said asking for deposits and not

[23:05] even a picture of the playfield yeah they asked for deposits and yeah they already sold out and

[23:08] yeah no one seen a god damn thing that's another reality of the pinball collector it doesn't matter

[23:15] they don't care these people are addicted to just having something new even if there's issues

[23:23] even if it's like site unseen that's that's the reality that's the reality and you look everyone

[23:31] who's not a pinball collector in this world all 99.9% of the population on planet earth thinks

[23:38] pinball collectors are fucking idiots do you guys ever talk to your normal friends about what you

[23:43] do with pinball about how you buy a machine without even seeing it about why you're like chasing after

[23:50] something I mean especially these guys who have like train machines in their homes like frocks

[23:55] a good example of this like this frolic go down to his game room and say to himself I need another

[24:00] one like why why like and is even getting enjoyment out of the pins he has probably not and for the

[24:10] few nights you know a year that he has like people come over they play the pins and they leave

[24:16] yeah he's frocks the guy with the cool game room I know that's like I mean I'm an arcade in my

[24:20] apartment I know it's like when people are impressed but it looked rarely do people come over and

[24:24] rarely do I I probably play the games less than people who visit because I don't really care

[24:28] they're there every day they just become like background artwork and I think that's what it's more

[24:32] about it's it's not like these people have been waiting for themes or or certain titles it's just

[24:39] the addiction to opening up a new thing so I look I think this guy said it the best pork chop express

[24:48] good old jack burnin right he said some of you guys are acting like little kids you don't need to

[24:54] tell people what to do with their money that shit needs to stop think about what your non pinball

[24:59] friends say when you tell them you spend thousands on a 30 year old pinball machine right when you

[25:04] try and explain and say but it's now gone up in value they look at me like sure buddy

[25:08] he's true it's so true like I put $7,000 into a lure of the rings Ellie and I sold it for

[25:14] $7,500 and I tried to justify it but if I put $7,000 at the same time and into the market

[25:20] into any of the stocks I was in I would have made twice my money so they're not good investments

[25:25] let's all stop with that all right all right so has anyone else like noticed that

[25:30] pinside moderator force flow just always has a tendency to say some really dumb stuff lately it's

[25:37] just I don't even think he thinks before he writes he wrote at the rate new inbox prices are skyrocketing

[25:43] it's almost more economical to build your own custom game and even higher out for some of the

[25:48] stuff you can't do on your own really it no like I think history's shown that to make your own game

[25:57] would cost tens of thousands if not hundreds the thousands of dollars this that is not a solution

[26:05] pinball geek wrote I hope this super early is just one off thing and not a reoccurring thing

[26:11] on upcoming games now like I as I said with the Star Wars example I don't know I think Stern is

[26:17] going to test the market out but I don't think it's going to go away because I think they're going

[26:24] to see how quickly people people want this stuff and I think there's a lesson here for Jersey

[26:30] Jack and Andrew highway and even Dutch pinball I mean these guys have to be looking at Stern and being

[26:37] like fuck like Stern is learning from us and we've all sort of been working hard to up the quality

[26:48] up the standard of materials and now Stern is going to reap the benefits of the market that these

[26:56] guys expose especially Jack like Jack came in and showed Stern your target can can afford to buy

[27:04] more expensive pins and what you're selling now at that time Stern's machines were total shit

[27:09] and Stern definitely has made the games much much nicer than the games that were shipping

[27:16] back then and I'm talking about like the the error with like CSI you know in games like along

[27:22] that line like even you know even like Avengers even tron like I you know I the artwork during that

[27:27] error not the best not the best but they know now like artists cheap it is crazy how cheap it is

[27:33] to make amazing artwork the fact that it had been such shit was just Stern Stern stuck in its

[27:39] ways with old designers like laying out the playfields using Photoshop but look these guys all

[27:45] showed Stern that people spend more and now what's happening Stern is going to keep just selling

[27:51] selling selling and the other guys I think the other guys just they can't they can't do it with

[27:58] with the amount of volume they ship it's just it's so hard for them to do what Stern's doing

[28:03] because what Stern can do is they can ship in one machine one title let's say Batman for example

[28:10] they could ship a mass version of the game they could ship a premium version of the game and they

[28:16] can ship an Ellie version of the game and they can ship a super Ellie version of the game right how

[28:21] many versions is that four versions of a game and they can as they go up that scale they can make

[28:29] more and more profit by shrinking the volume that's available on each model so if you have

[28:36] 20 nights of rent super Ellie Star Wars machines then you have 500 Ellie's 500 you know and then maybe

[28:46] maybe they do 500 lightsides 500 dark side and then you do the rest are just premiums and pros

[28:56] that's what you could do I mean and let's not kid ourselves here what is the what is the limit

[29:04] that Stern could charge let's say Stern just made one Luke Skywalker edition 50 grand would someone buy

[29:13] and I think all of you can't have a hard time being honest with yourself said yes if Stern made

[29:19] one version of Star Wars that was a Luke Skywalker like special premium edition with you know carbon

[29:25] fiber whatever cabinet and all this stuff whatever they did to make it like the crem de la crem

[29:30] it would sell like that it would sell immediately and that's exactly what Lamar guinea does now

[29:36] they know that their buyers a collector and they'll make like 20 20 versions of a certain model they'll

[29:42] make one with only five versions of this but it'll be four million dollars each and they sell

[29:46] everyone just think about that too one guy who buys just like the bottom of the line Lamar guinea

[29:53] was like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars it's not even a special version it's not even like

[29:59] you know real doesn't even stand out when you go to car shows it's just a just a typical

[30:03] Lamborghini like hurricane wherever the fuck it's called two hundred thousand dollars plus right

[30:10] what if that guy was in the pinball imagine that and I always said this you know the guy who wants

[30:17] the best pinball machine the world who wants the rarest imagine you're that multi-millionaire and

[30:24] this is where you want to put your money I mean I guys like Bill Brandnis were like this we got the

[30:27] guy was a fat train is that his name over he's looking for like a kingpin in a king Kong the

[30:32] guys who want to have the one of five the one of four like you know the super limited games out

[30:38] there only ten wherever made in the world and they want that to be the holy ground their collection

[30:43] and they're willing to spend thirty forty thousand dollars on a kingpin fifty thousand on a

[30:48] kingpin they came and fucking fine one now what if Stern made a brand new game with all modern

[30:54] technology but limited to those numbers and had special features and most fifty thousand dollars

[30:59] all of a sudden doesn't seem so unreasonable and and that's where we're at with this hobby and I

[31:05] know batman's got people but hurt because of this notion that maybe collectible pinball machines

[31:13] or the future of the collecting community is going to be reserved for people who have money

[31:19] and it it look again I look at it like I I feel like I could collect pinball machines I can't collect

[31:25] cars I can't collect rare movie posters in the scheme of things it's not the most expensive toy

[31:34] to collect but when I go to like the expose and and I know the people that are into the hobby and a

[31:39] lot of them you know come from the arcade collecting hobby you have a definite you have a mixture of

[31:46] the have and have nots you have people have tons of money to burn and people who have hardly any

[31:50] money at all I mean we were it you know on the same site we have a guy Rocky Balboa or Balboa rules

[31:57] like basically has no money in the world can't even pay his medical bills and he's selling baseball

[32:02] cards to get a pinball machine back and within a few inches of that thread you have guys who are

[32:07] who are searching for fifty thousand dollar kingpins and and that's the hobby and that's the way

[32:13] the hobby is going to be and I think Stern has awoken to the reality of the new collecting community

[32:19] I don't think this is the end of it I think you're going to see limited editions sell out before

[32:26] they're ever revealed moving forward and I think companies and I was saying this and I want to

[32:31] loop back to it I think Jersey Jack and Andrew highway would be smart to go in on the proper way

[32:38] to do the Ellie model I think they're both doing it wrong I think Jack Jack is just too many versions

[32:43] of the Hobbit and if you're going to make it limited make it limited imagine if Jack made a

[32:47] version that there was only fifty of them and then you charge like 15 grand he could have done it

[32:53] it just creates a halo effect for the whole thing I also think that Andrew highways Ellie model

[33:00] for alien is like almost idiotic we're almost everything that you put on the Ellie you're going to

[33:06] make available for sale separately to the to the other buyers no make the limit it's truly limited

[33:13] make it in a way that can't be replicated there's only one reason why you know ghost busters

[33:18] limited really sings and sores it's the cabinet art and the armor you you can't replace that you can't

[33:26] there there is and they made the pros and the premiums look so similar I think that hurts the

[33:30] premium for me and ghost busters like I wish the premium like had stay puffed on it I think the

[33:34] fact that they look exactly the same as the pro really makes the premium I don't know seem a

[33:39] little mundane in my mind in my mind but anyway that's the future of pinball it's going to be this

[33:45] world where there's going to be limited edition examples pin sides a bunch of hypocrites and babies

[33:51] everyone thought that after ghost busters debacle stern with loose sales stern just sold out a

[33:58] batman it's not going to happen they're going to fix issues but they're going to keep going

[34:04] and stern is the only real player in town as as much as we keep waiting around for dutch pinball

[34:09] to be able to send 50 machines out in six months or highway to you know two year delay on alien

[34:15] omos and it's like is it going to ship when it ships and and by the time it ships what what will

[34:21] the climate be like how's it going to compare so that's the thing I mean stern is they've got games

[34:29] probably up into 2018 2019 like being designed being worked on I don't think that's happening at any

[34:36] other manufacturer in fact I think stern is in a position right now where if they get their

[34:41] shit together they're going to start putting other pinball machines out of business just wait for

[34:46] everyone who thinks like all these other companies are going to survive with games trickling out

[34:52] are dead wrong stern is going to capitalize on it stern is going to stern stern has the ability to

[34:58] get the best themes the ability to get the best talent and and they have the ability to ship games

[35:05] quickly and you know anyone who thinks otherwise that these other companies can really hurt them

[35:11] I don't know they seemed vulnerable a couple months ago now they seem like they're on top of the

[35:15] world again in my book I think the the stern train is going to keep going and the future looks really

[35:21] bright I look I hope everyone else can can get games out faster and can create titles that excite

[35:28] as much as stern is doing but right now they're the only real player in town

[35:33] gerry's laugh into the bank all the and all these pinside babies who insult stern and say they're

[35:38] going to take their money elsewhere stern is like where are you going to take your money

[35:43] where are you going to take your money you're going to go buy like an old 20 year old game that

[35:46] knowing is going to give a shit about think about it hey guys I just bought a monster bash

[35:51] cricket nobody gives a shit hey guys I got my medieval madness remake cricket nobody gives a

[35:56] shit let's be honest we're all excited about new pinball machines not old ones old games have been

[36:03] around forever talked about forever I have a tells of the Arabian nights I love it it's gorgeous

[36:07] it's a work of art I'm still more excited to play ghostbusters than toad and I'm still more

[36:12] excited to see what comes out than my tells the Arabian nights do I think it will hold its value

[36:18] yes I do because it's it's definitely like a very unique pin and was built during an error when

[36:23] pinball you know put everything into these games like the companies back then they'd spare no

[36:29] expense they made games incredible but but new technology it's it's it's gonna make me want the

[36:35] new stuff same way with like another car you mean coming my next car is going to be an automatic

[36:40] as much as I love driving manual have you seen what the new 10 speed automatic transmissions can do

[36:45] they're like almost a second faster in the quarter mile than a manual so fuck like no brainer

[36:52] so look everyone who's got their butt hurt who said you're not going to buy another stern

[36:57] you're lying you're gonna end up going in on a new one star wars nights of rent Ellie super Ellie

[37:05] super duper Jedi fucking Ellie Gary Sterns is gonna like take your money and Gary take my money

[37:12] because if you make a super duper fucking Jedi version I'm gonna hand you over every dime I have
