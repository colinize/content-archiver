[00:00] Let me ask you a question.

[00:14] Your Stern Pimbal and you've been selling thousands of Pimbal machines every year.

[00:20] You've built an army of buyers.

[00:22] They want to buy your games.

[00:23] They want to accessorize your games.

[00:27] My won't Stern Pimbal make more toppers for these games.

[00:30] I really don't understand it.

[00:33] And even now, as I see people like hyping the stranger things topper, it's like already

[00:38] sold out before it's even out there in the world.

[00:41] And I went on Stern's website and every topper, Ninja Turtles, Iron Maiden, Jurassic Park,

[00:48] Avengers Infinity Equest, every single topper is at a stock.

[00:52] And then you go on the second hand market and you see these damn things trading for well

[00:57] above what they're worth.

[00:59] And we know that Stern has priced these things well above what it costs to make them.

[01:03] So why is it?

[01:05] Why is it that brand new things?

[01:07] Things that you want to accessorize your games with.

[01:11] Why can't the number one Pimbal company in the world, which so many of the apologists

[01:16] keep telling us like Stern needs to turn a profit, we need to support Stern and here's

[01:21] the thing.

[01:22] Everybody is supporting Stern, but why can't they make more of these simple trinkets that

[01:28] go on top of your game so that you the Stern buyer can be happy and actually pay a fair

[01:35] price for something that you just want to make your game look beautiful.

[01:40] They're witnessing all of this.

[01:41] They're witnessing people sell these kiss toppers, these ghost busters toppers for thousands

[01:46] more than they're worth.

[01:47] And they're doing nothing to help you out.

[01:51] And I just want to say the first thing that popped into my mind because I saw a dude selling

[01:55] three Stern toppers together like a lot of Stern toppers, no games, three Stern toppers

[02:02] together and the gentleman would like $5,000 for it.

[02:06] We're in this period right now in April in which there is nothing really significant

[02:11] to talk about other than this ridiculous price increase.

[02:15] All you rich boomers out there have to flex your money with stuff you don't need.

[02:19] We're witnessing it all over the place.

[02:21] It's not just pinball.

[02:23] There's no new games out.

[02:24] There's no new games that came out at pinbrew this week in in Ohio.

[02:28] No manufacturers are showing us anything really to chew on right now.

[02:32] So it's a period in which I think a lot of people are bored, a lot of people have money.

[02:37] And the COVID mental thing that has happened to everybody.

[02:41] I mean, COVID has beat everybody down to the point where there's a lot of cabin fever.

[02:46] There's a lot of money that was not spent on vacations.

[02:50] There's a lot of money that wasn't spent on this and that, on weddings and everything

[02:55] that you normally would spend money on when it came to out of the house experiences has

[03:01] now been kept in the bank.

[03:03] And for many of you out there, you've seen crazy returns on the stock market investments

[03:08] you've made, maybe some crypto investments.

[03:11] And so the money gets to go somewhere now because you made money for nothing.

[03:15] And we've witnessed an explosion in the pinball industry in terms of what some people are

[03:21] willing to pay for this stuff.

[03:23] But here is what I'm here to tell you on Canadian pinball podcast.

[03:27] I think that there is going to be a level set, a resetting, if you will.

[03:33] And I've said it and I've said on my Facebook live, so I'm going to say it here today,

[03:38] you don't need to get on this hype train at all.

[03:42] It's not a real thing.

[03:43] It's a manufactured economy of scarcity and phoma working together and you don't need

[03:49] to get on it.

[03:50] And it's so much more fun not being on this train like it's more fun watching it.

[03:56] It's spent $3,000 on a kiss top and not doing that.

[04:00] It's more fun watching it.

[04:01] It's spend $20,000 on a pirate to the Caribbean Ellie and not even going anywhere near that.

[04:07] My friend, I have a new friend in the pinball world.

[04:09] He just started collecting, guess what?

[04:11] He bought a pirate to the Caribbean in Ellie for $13,000 this week.

[04:18] So for those morons out there thinking it's $20,000, here is the most recent purchase

[04:24] at $13,000.

[04:25] Now yes, someone did spend $38,000 on a new inbox one and that buyer will never reveal

[04:34] themselves to the world.

[04:35] And so for that gentleman out there who has that much money, congratulations.

[04:40] We will all make fun of you if you reveal yourself to the world.

[04:44] But I'm watching this.

[04:45] I'm watching what's happening in pinball lately and there is just this impatience.

[04:50] There's this anxiety and I'm here to tell you I think we're going to have to be a little

[04:54] bit more patient because I don't think we're going to see Stern's next game until the end

[04:59] of May.

[05:00] That is when they revealed teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[05:03] I think it was May 27th.

[05:05] So here we are mid April and I think that maybe COVID push back Ninja Turtles revealed

[05:10] to you a little bit later than initially scheduled because you know a lot of these companies would

[05:14] like to release their products around T.P.F. around Midwest gaming, festival, whatever it's

[05:19] called.

[05:20] But the thing is there is none of that this year.

[05:22] Pimbru is not a big enough event.

[05:23] We knew people were not going to come there with stuff but there was a new game at Pimbru

[05:27] this year in Ohio.

[05:29] We saw the pinball brother is version of alien and they put it out on location for people

[05:34] to play in the coin taker booth and I will say it is nice to see that this game is finally

[05:39] shipping but I will once again sort of scratch my head as I think about the pinball brothers

[05:45] and what it is they're doing over there and how they're getting this game out the door

[05:50] and I don't quite understand it.

[05:52] They go on a podcast in December and reveal everything about this whole thing.

[05:58] So December January, February, March, April.

[06:03] Okay so four months go by.

[06:05] Four months go by.

[06:06] Let me ask you a question.

[06:07] Have you seen a gameplay video of this game from the pinball brothers yet?

[06:13] You have not.

[06:14] We haven't seen anybody play it yet.

[06:16] It's out on location in Ohio.

[06:19] Think about that for a minute.

[06:20] These guys spent years getting this game back and in working order and they couldn't

[06:26] find one person in Europe to stream the game or play it and show people all the changes

[06:31] and walk through all the things they've done in the game and now it's just sitting on

[06:35] a floor in an Ohio pinball show in America and that to me makes me scratch my head like

[06:42] what?

[06:43] You couldn't get anybody to stream this game and show off all the features in the right

[06:47] way.

[06:48] So if you really cared about this game and you cared about your company and you cared

[06:53] about your brand like what is this just like extreme laziness or you just couldn't do

[06:58] it or you just didn't know anyone who owns something called a video camera and a rig.

[07:03] And we know that there are a lot of people in Europe that know how to stream pinball machines

[07:07] very well.

[07:08] They then released an image of this game going to France and there were initially supposed

[07:13] to be three versions of the alien game.

[07:17] There's an SV and LV and an XV version of the game.

[07:22] Now we know after their interview that there are no longer going to be three versions of

[07:28] the game.

[07:29] It's only going to be two versions of the game but this made me laugh because this company

[07:33] ordered the cardboard boxes before they even knew what they were going to do.

[07:39] They already had in mind they were going to make three versions of the game and yet now

[07:42] we're only getting two versions of the game and I have said it before and I'll say it

[07:47] again.

[07:48] If you go on pinside which is back finally pinside's back.

[07:50] While you guys out there who had a live in the normal world for an entire week, pinside

[07:55] is back.

[07:56] And going back on it was like, oh man, it really did.

[08:00] It made me feel like this is a great resource but it also is a colossal waste of time and

[08:08] it is mentally healthier for so many of you out there not to spend too much time on

[08:13] pinside because all the negativity, all the moaning and groaning, once you turn it off

[08:18] it's amazing.

[08:19] You turn off pinside and you realize nobody cares.

[08:23] Nobody cares about most of these issues.

[08:24] Nobody cares about deeproot anywhere else but pinside.

[08:28] Nobody is talking about the deeproot calamity anywhere else in the world except on pinside.

[08:34] Nobody on Facebook cares.

[08:36] Nobody on Twitter cares.

[08:38] Nobody at the local bar cares.

[08:40] Nobody at your barbershop cares.

[08:41] Nobody is talking about it but the same 20 dudes in this thread that keep bumping it up

[08:48] every single day.

[08:49] We'll talk a little bit about deeproot but you know what?

[08:51] It's like I don't even care.

[08:52] I really don't care.

[08:54] So pinside is back and if you go to pinside and you look at the photos of the alien machine

[08:59] at pinbrew at the coin takeer 10, I will once again say that this game looks so underwhelming.

[09:09] The cabinet, the entire package with the silver armor, everything about it, the back box,

[09:15] nothing looks better than it did before.

[09:18] They had it next to a hot wheels.

[09:20] It doesn't even look better than hot wheels.

[09:22] There's something about this package.

[09:24] It need it like radcals.

[09:26] It needed to have some love and attention given to this game.

[09:30] It looks basic.

[09:32] It looks standard and this is not what alien deserves.

[09:36] Why is it?

[09:37] Let me just ask you guys this question.

[09:39] Why is it in 2021?

[09:41] With all the technology that's out there with all the printing services available you're

[09:45] going to print your alien cabinet artwork on what looks like really dull and flat decal.

[09:53] There's no glossiness.

[09:55] There's no shine.

[09:56] There's no depth to it.

[09:57] Why would you make it look like that?

[10:00] You had two years to do it right.

[10:03] And so that's what my issue is with this game.

[10:05] It looks so basic.

[10:08] An alien pinball after all this time should have came back with a roar.

[10:13] They marketed this thing like the beast is back.

[10:16] If you want an alien, this is the other part.

[10:19] If you want an alien and you want to go in and get this game from Coin Takeer and the

[10:24] pinball brothers, a few things that I would be wanting to see right now.

[10:28] This is another thing that after four months after they came out and said they were going

[10:32] to partner with this Italian manufacturer to make these games.

[10:36] Here's the biggest question we all should be asking because sending a few games to shows

[10:41] and a few games out is not proof that you're going to get your game anytime soon.

[10:47] So why have they not shown us any video of the production line over in Italy?

[10:54] If they want to get people confident that if you order this game, you're going to get

[10:59] it sometime in the next few months.

[11:01] Wouldn't the best thing be to show you that they have manufacturing going and a video

[11:07] and a tour of that factory?

[11:09] And I think they owe it to us because everyone else who ordered this game before was on

[11:15] a year, multi year journey and a lot of people never got their game.

[11:20] So isn't that how you win over people's confidence?

[11:23] You show them the line.

[11:25] Now speaking of winning over confidence and showing people the line, I know there was

[11:30] a Kerry Hardy appearance on another podcast in which he talked about his visit to Deeproot

[11:35] and you should go listen to this.

[11:37] And I guess at the 90 minute mark, there's a link on the pin side to it.

[11:40] Kerry talks all about how they didn't see anything and there was no manufacturing whatsoever.

[11:46] And a lot of the stuff they were shown, they were very skeptical about and because they

[11:50] signed NDAs, they couldn't come out of Deeproot and be completely honest about what they

[11:55] saw.

[11:56] Now I think they did a good job.

[11:57] The deep six who went over there simply trying with all of their silence spoke volumes

[12:03] that they didn't see anything that there was no line, that there was no progress, that

[12:08] there was nothing going on.

[12:09] And here we are many, many, many months later.

[12:12] Remember, that was September.

[12:14] So here we are six or eight months later.

[12:16] We'll know games going out and I just want to say the cons.

[12:20] Really?

[12:21] I'm so sick of all these sirens and waking up like this.

[12:25] I'm so over in New York City people.

[12:27] I just want to like, let me go find a little rant about this city.

[12:31] Yeah, I'm walking the dog last night and this dude is like, hey man, I got the same jacket

[12:37] and the guy lives in my building and he stops and he says to me like, hey man, how long

[12:42] you been here?

[12:43] And the guy actually expects me to say something like like two months and like on brand new

[12:48] and hey, like it's nice to meet you.

[12:49] I look at him and I say, I've been here for 20 years, man, 20 years.

[12:53] And he's been here too for like over a decade.

[12:56] Lives literally above me on the fourth floor.

[12:59] 20 years go by and there's no community sense.

[13:03] There's no neighbors.

[13:04] There's no like looking out for each other.

[13:07] And I've loved New York City as a kid and I love like going out late at night and I'll

[13:10] tell you right now with a kid and with a bulldog and with a family.

[13:15] There is nothing, nothing more unattractive to me right now than city living in New York

[13:21] City right now.

[13:22] And I don't find it appealing and I'm so tired of living without community, without connection,

[13:28] without belonging.

[13:30] And that's what it feels like in this city.

[13:31] We all spend all this money and we get in these little tiny boxes and these tiny boxes

[13:35] are worth more than major homes everywhere else in the country.

[13:40] And there's no peace of mind.

[13:41] There's no quiet here.

[13:42] It is at eight o'clock in the morning and his sirens are going.

[13:46] Garbage trucks are slamming dumpsters all over the place.

[13:49] You hear people screaming every Thursday, Friday, Saturday night, drunk on the block and

[13:54] I'm telling you at 44 years of age, this is a little Canadian rant.

[13:58] I'm so sick of New York City.

[13:59] All right, let's get back to deep root.

[14:01] Okay.

[14:02] But aren't we at the point where deep root pinball is seriously just a problem for a 130

[14:08] people to worry about and the constant piling on the constant complaining.

[14:14] It was the point like what is going to happen?

[14:16] I went into the thread and in the thread it was Jerry over at P3 multi morphic basically

[14:22] getting in an argument with Aaron over at fast pinball about RGBs and Daisy chaining

[14:28] the lights on games.

[14:29] Now one of the funniest things in that thread is Jerry said something like you don't need

[14:33] to reinvent the wheel.

[14:35] My God, if there's anybody who should never say the phrase reinvent the wheel with regards

[14:41] to pinball, it's Jerry over at multi morphic.

[14:44] Jerry, you would you try to reinvent the entire pinball wheel and you didn't need to do it

[14:50] that way.

[14:51] But you know, you go on this thread and it's all these people pulling at this thing and

[14:55] here's the thing.

[14:56] We all know what's happening.

[14:59] Nothing.

[15:00] Nothing is happening.

[15:01] If something was happening.

[15:03] If there was some progress, Robert would just share photos.

[15:06] He would share a video.

[15:08] He would share something that would keep these people's like faith in place but nothing.

[15:13] So until they show something, there's no point in talking about it.

[15:17] Over at Dutch pinball, we got some news.

[15:19] There is a code update for the big Lebowski.

[15:21] Yay, after all these years and after all these people ripped off, we finally have some

[15:27] code updates in the big Lebowski.

[15:29] What's crazy about this code update is it's 0.55.

[15:33] Really?

[15:34] Like 0.55?

[15:35] Now they know that when you get to like 1.0 as an industry standard, is usually when a game

[15:41] is considered done, games can go past 1.0 where there's more polish and more stuff at

[15:46] it.

[15:47] But 1.0 is like indicative of everything that we wanted in the game is currently in the

[15:52] game.

[15:53] Now 0.55 of the big Lebowski.

[15:57] What are we supposed to take away from that?

[15:59] That there's still so much to come?

[16:00] Are there more clips from the movie that are going to make it in?

[16:03] Are there more modes that are going to make it in?

[16:05] I think they've added some extra balls and some multi balls and who knows what.

[16:10] But if you have a big Lebowski, make sure you update your code because there is finally

[16:16] a code update.

[16:17] Now, is the same coder who did the game originally working on it?

[16:21] We shall see.

[16:22] I'm going to try and find out.

[16:23] But I'm not hearing like there's a ton more in this game.

[16:26] All right.

[16:27] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[16:28] So let's talk about American pinball.

[16:30] I want to officially right now.

[16:32] It's 8.14 a.m. on a Monday morning.

[16:35] I would like to officially invite Mr. David Fix or Mr. Michael Grant, the two gentlemen

[16:42] over at American pinball.

[16:45] I would like to officially invite them to come on Canadian pinball podcast and talk to

[16:50] us about AP about where AP is going and about the future of the company and what games they

[16:56] have in the mix.

[16:57] And I would love to just have them feel like they can come on here and we can have a good

[17:02] discussion about American pinball because as I've said in the past and I think they agree

[17:06] with me, American pinball makes a great product.

[17:10] American pinball has missed the mark with themes that people want.

[17:14] I don't think they would disagree with any of that.

[17:16] And I think David Fix and the team over there now has a mission to bring out themes people

[17:22] want and make a quality product.

[17:25] And I'm rooting for them to do that and I would love to have David Fix join the show.

[17:30] I'm going to send him a Facebook message.

[17:32] But I think Canadian pinball podcast is the place where they should come to convince all

[17:37] of us why we should believe in the new American pinball.

[17:42] And I think there is a great window right now for this company to release a product or

[17:47] get some momentum going because as I've said, I'm so shocked that none of these other

[17:52] companies are taking advantage of this window in which there is no new Stern game.

[17:58] There is no new Jersey Jack game.

[18:00] There is no new spooky game.

[18:02] There is no new Chicago gaming company game like right now is the window for everybody else.

[18:07] So we'll see if David will come on the show and David, I forgive you for making fun of

[18:11] Canada.

[18:12] We don't have to talk about that.

[18:14] All is forgiven.

[18:15] Let's talk about the future of your company on the number one pinball podcast.

[18:20] Let's do that.

[18:21] It offers out there and for those of you who know him, maybe give him a little tap on

[18:24] the shoulder and say, hey, Canada put out a really nice offer to have you guys come on

[18:29] the show.

[18:30] Let's talk about Jersey Jack pinball.

[18:32] Okay.

[18:33] Let's talk about good old J.J.P. the company with the greatest momentum right now in pinball.

[18:39] Like everything they touch turns to gold right now.

[18:42] I saw someone is trying to sell a Wizard of Oz, the yellow brick road edition which

[18:47] none of us want it, which everybody laughed at because it was 11.5 and they took stuff

[18:53] out of it.

[18:54] Now someone's trying to sell one for 18,500 and this is the world of pinball.

[19:00] This is the world of pinball right now.

[19:01] Things that people didn't really want, things that the community did not value are now being

[19:07] overvalued simply because they're no longer available.

[19:11] And I want to say this before I go more into J.J.P.

[19:13] The reason why a lot of this stuff and I want all of you to listen to this.

[19:17] The reason why a lot of this stuff is not valuable.

[19:22] The reason why a lot of this stuff is no longer in production is because people didn't want

[19:29] it.

[19:30] Is because people saw that it wasn't worth it.

[19:32] And just because there is now something that says like add a production or sold out doesn't

[19:39] make it now good.

[19:41] But unfortunately modern pinball is going the way of some of like the old arcade classic

[19:47] cabinet world where major havoc which is the crappiest arcade game you could ever play.

[19:53] Like major havoc is terrible.

[19:55] There's a reason why they barely made any major havocs because they suck.

[19:59] And yet because they only made a few major havocs are worth a lot of money because someone

[20:05] would walk in you an arcade and say oh my god you have a major havoc in your collection.

[20:10] And guess what?

[20:11] Yeah, that person does and maybe it's worth $8,000.

[20:14] But here's the thing, when you own a major havoc and you jump on it, it sucks.

[20:20] The experience sucks.

[20:21] Now I'm not here to say like was sucks or pirate sucks.

[20:23] But what's happening is this.

[20:25] A lot of this stuff is not worth what any of these prices indicate.

[20:31] The reason why a lot of these things are no longer being made is because us the pinball

[20:36] buyers didn't want them.

[20:39] And I really do urge all of you out there.

[20:42] And I mean this, the key to happiness in this hobby is simply buy a game because you

[20:47] love it, buy a game because you enjoy it.

[20:51] Do not buy a game because you're afraid you won't be able to get it.

[20:56] Do not buy a game because you think it's going to go up in value.

[21:00] Do not buy a game because you're worried.

[21:03] You're worried if you don't get that willy-wank as CE right now, someone else is going to

[21:07] get it.

[21:08] Like you will feel regret or envy that someone else in the community got it and you didn't.

[21:13] If you buy pinball for these reasons, I'm telling you if you go down this road, you will

[21:19] never be satisfied with pinball.

[21:22] Look at the honking of the horns.

[21:23] I swear to God people.

[21:25] I'm not even going to edit all this out.

[21:26] You could see why I'm so done with New York City.

[21:30] I'm so done with it.

[21:31] I'm so done.

[21:33] But do not buy these things for any other reason than you love them.

[21:38] You know what I was talking to this new kid who just bought pirates for $13,000 and he's

[21:43] like, well, what about Rick and Morty?

[21:44] What about this?

[21:45] What about that?

[21:46] Well, first of all, have you played these games?

[21:48] The first answer on some of it is yes on some no on others.

[21:52] So don't buy a Rick and Morty unless you've played it.

[21:55] Start there.

[21:56] Do you love these themes?

[21:58] That's the other thing.

[21:59] Do you love these themes?

[22:00] It is so weird to me that you would have a collection of pinball machines unless you

[22:04] loved the themes themselves.

[22:07] Do you love the game?

[22:09] Do you love the gameplay?

[22:10] Do you love the pinball moments?

[22:11] Do you love what's under the glass?

[22:13] Okay?

[22:14] That's the way to go.

[22:15] All right, let's go back to Jersey Jack pinball.

[22:17] So why is it that we are still slowly, slowly, slowly seeing guns and roses on boxings?

[22:25] There are new LEDs being unboxed.

[22:27] But here's the interesting thing.

[22:29] Last week, Jersey Jack pinball listed some jobs.

[22:33] Jersey Jack pinball listed some available jobs with the company.

[22:37] Now I want to read for you the jobs that they are looking to fulfill.

[22:41] I wanted to ask yourselves as I read these positions.

[22:45] Are these not pretty critical positions to have filled right now and are these vacant

[22:50] positions or are these positions for a second line?

[22:54] I'm not sure.

[22:56] Here's the jobs and here's how much it pays.

[22:58] And it's really weird that they give this like price range with the jobs because it's

[23:02] also close to each other.

[23:03] Prototype model maker for 60 to 70,000 a year.

[23:07] Director of production.

[23:08] That sounds like a big job.

[23:10] 80 to 90,000 a year.

[23:12] The bill of material specialists, 45 to 50,000 a year.

[23:17] The mechanical design engineer, 70 to 80,000 a year.

[23:22] 40 control specialists, that sounds like a really important job.

[23:26] You're the quality control specialist and you're going to make a whopping 14 to 15 dollars

[23:31] an hour.

[23:32] Wow, let's click on that one for a second.

[23:34] 14 to 15 dollars an hour.

[23:37] Warehouse associate makes 13, 50 to 14 dollars an hour.

[23:42] Production support associate, 16 to 17 an hour.

[23:46] And warehouse associate.

[23:47] Okay, so these are like pretty much like entry level, like low level jobs.

[23:51] So Jersey Jack Pimbal is looking to fill these positions.

[23:54] What's strange is these seem like very specialized jobs in the world of Pimbal manufacturing.

[24:00] And so how is it that we're still seeing Jersey Jack sort of just like Eric's looking

[24:05] for people like his brother posted this on Facebook.

[24:09] Surely there's a human resource department that knows where to go or a recruiter who knows

[24:15] where to go to find people who are suitable for these skill sets.

[24:19] Now it begs the question.

[24:21] Did Jersey Jack expect to lower over more people from Stern Pimbal's factory because

[24:27] remember Stern is just down the block.

[24:30] And if there's anywhere where people know how to do exactly what JJP needs, it's over at

[24:37] Stern Pimbal.

[24:39] Now I have to imagine that Stern Pimbal treats its people well, that they've been making

[24:44] games like clockwork and the work is consistent.

[24:48] And I think that's the other part.

[24:50] Whenever I see the images over at JJP, there are always beautiful cabinets lined up, beautiful

[24:56] play fields lined up.

[24:57] But you just don't see the movement and the daily sort of like grind going on.

[25:04] And I mean like grind in a good way like the gears are grinding in this factory and stuff

[25:09] is happening.

[25:10] I don't mean it like in a bad way.

[25:12] But Stern feels like it's very very productive.

[25:15] And every day Stern Pimbal is making over 40 or 50 games which is incredible right?

[25:20] It's incredible to think about.

[25:22] Stern making 400 games a week.

[25:24] Now over at Jersey Jack Pimbal, I still think they're struggling to get like 50 games

[25:30] out a week.

[25:31] And they must be staring at the orders for guns and roses.

[25:35] And even raising the price on the game probably didn't help them out at all.

[25:40] Because they need to make X amount a week and until they make this many games, they're

[25:45] not going to be even with their orders.

[25:48] And then it does beg the question is when will we see the next game?

[25:52] And I don't think we're going to see Toy Story now until maybe the very end of the year.

[25:57] But I think we're going to see Toy Story in March of 2022, which is sort of super deflating

[26:04] if you're a fan of Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[26:07] And you really just want to see this company get to the point where they can make two games

[26:12] a year, where they can have two lines making one game on each line and they can get enough

[26:17] of them out the door so people are not waiting forever.

[26:20] Now we've beaten this like a dead horse.

[26:23] You know how I feel about it.

[26:25] Jersey Jack Pimbal is a bespoke high end Pimbal manufacturer.

[26:29] They are trying to win the volume game against Stern with the way they sell you their product.

[26:34] It's not working.

[26:35] It's never worked and they need to figure something out.

[26:38] They can't have it both ways.

[26:40] They can't make the Bugatti of Pimbal and then open up the order banks like they're selling

[26:44] Honda Civics the way Stern does.

[26:46] It's just not working.

[26:47] It's putting more pressure on them than they need.

[26:50] They're selling their product for less money than it's worth.

[26:53] Everybody knows this and they simply need to figure out a way to make it work better for

[26:57] them.

[26:58] Again, I just think they need to say like we're only going to make 2000 in each title.

[27:02] They're this much money and have a go at it.

[27:05] 1500 L.E.'s and 500 C.E.'s and that's it.

[27:08] Stop trying to make S.E.'s.

[27:09] Stop trying to expand Pimbal.

[27:11] That's never going to be where they win.

[27:14] Stern Pimbal has that market locked.

[27:15] They have it.

[27:16] They're expanding Pimbal left and right.

[27:18] They don't need Jersey Jack Pimbal to expand Pimbal.

[27:21] What Jersey Jack Pimbal needs to do is just finally admit to itself that its customer base

[27:27] is wealthier.

[27:28] That it's not trying to make location pin.

[27:31] That it's trying to make games for the home collector who have money.

[27:34] I don't know why there's so much guilt and so much aversion in this industry to someone

[27:40] just embracing that high end Pimbal manufacturing status.

[27:44] They're putting so much more into their games and yet they're trying to compete with Stern

[27:49] on volume and they can't do it and Stern's clobbering them when it comes to efficiencies

[27:53] and we all know it.

[27:54] We all know it.

[27:55] You know, someone was talking to Jack and they said Jack's vision for this company was

[27:59] to be more like spooky.

[28:02] He wanted it to be a small family run Pimbal company out of New Jersey that elevated Pimbal

[28:09] and he achieved that dream.

[28:10] Now they ran out of money a bunch of times.

[28:12] They made a bunch of mistakes.

[28:14] There was a lot of delays but ultimately I don't think Jack wanted to get like 5,000

[28:19] orders for a game because he knew there was no way he could fulfill that in a timely manner

[28:25] and keep the train moving and get multiple titles out because it's boring.

[28:30] I'm telling you, it must be boring to be over at spooky Pimbal and just make the same game

[28:36] every day for 18 months.

[28:38] There's just boring.

[28:39] On some level you want to have more diversity.

[28:42] I think two games a year is the sweet spot for any Pimbal company.

[28:46] Only Stern can do more but for everybody else figure out what is the volume you can do

[28:54] if you want to make two games a year and have a development cycle that can absorb that.

[29:00] That means you have to be honest about your productivity and about your workforce, about

[29:06] your bomb, about your vendors, about everything.

[29:09] You have to really be honest if we're going to do this and we're going to give our fans

[29:14] two options a year which is not a ton.

[29:16] We need to make this many, price it at this and make the themes this.

[29:21] It's that simple.

[29:22] Alright, I was going to read some user emails but I'm going to do that on the next show

[29:25] because babykilling starting to wake up.

[29:28] I'm going to go sue them.

[29:30] Hopefully this episode 570 of Canadian Pimbal podcast has sued you a little bit.

[29:37] It's really a weird time.

[29:38] There's not a lot going on.

[29:40] I don't care about all these jacked up prices.

[29:43] I'm kind of really starting to sort of settle down and realize that Pimbal, it's not

[29:50] this thing that's like this hyper collectible item.

[29:54] It's stupid to go down this road.

[29:56] People are pushing it in that direction but for the rest of us out there who have common

[30:00] sense, I think just avoided it at all costs and enjoy Pimbal and I can't wait to get

[30:06] back to shows with you guys and have fun.

[30:08] You can hear the baby crying.

[30:10] We're going to talk to you soon.

[30:11] We're going to get some interviews going.

[30:13] It's the hardest thing for me to do is interview people with a baby.

[30:15] It's just hard to do.

[30:16] Let everybody have a good Monday episode 570 out.
