[03:41] Actually can't stop laughing at it because I'm like

[03:44] Cuz like all right, so

[03:48] Like

[03:50] Oh my god, where is it?

[03:54] Like all right like let's let's look at this photo for a meeting so so Billy. Oh my god Frankie

[04:02] Frank the angel oh with a hundred dollars. I

[04:06] Think this is the most anybody's ever super chat at me a hundred bucks

[04:12] Brenda

[04:13] Call up the sushi place. We're getting some uni tonight, baby

[04:18] You see how my energy levels when we're busking

[04:21] I

[04:22] Frank Frank the angel oh one of my best friends Frank. Thank you so much brother

[04:27] All right, so like why I love this photo

[04:30] What makes this photo so damn funny is like bills like I haven't gotten to bed

[04:35] I've been thank you. I've been playing I've been playing Potter all night long

[04:41] I can't sleep. You know why he's playing all night long because look at what's behind bill

[04:47] Look to the right of his buttocks

[04:50] You look at look at the hairy Potter rule sheet sitting on the glass of the pirates of the care of course

[04:56] He can't go to sleep. He has no idea what he's doing

[05:01] He has no idea what he's doing this tabby isn't the answer to improve for us

[05:11] I mean no idea what he's doing here and

[05:15] Talk about pins in front of windows. Can we talk about that glass doors or those windows?

[05:20] But no, it's like I'm glad bills having a good time the

[05:28] the

[05:30] The over the overarching consensus

[05:35] 1995 I can't go to bed mode 95 can't go to bed Billy B

[05:43] The overall consensus and and this is just like

[05:49] I'm reading everybody's feedback the the overarching consensus on Harry Potter is very positive

[05:55] It the reception has been positive people are really enjoying the gameplay

[06:00] I really do think like as a overall the reason why it's fun

[06:07] Thank you for guys. Thank you for all these by the way the the generosity really is means a lot

[06:13] Bill bought two Harry Potter's one for each of his homes

[06:17] But the reason why people are having such a good time is like finally a beautiful Jersey Jack game. That's amazing to shoot

[06:24] I mean it's just that simple. I still think the code is a is a slot machine casino mess

[06:29] I do everything's on at the same time. I still don't like the code of Harry Potter

[06:34] But like the code issues are not enough of an issue

[06:40] If you follow what I'm saying like because like there's a lot in there and it's all on at once and but but it has so much

[06:49] So you don't you don't play Harry Potter and feel like your

[06:55] Playing a game that's not complete you don't play it and feel like you're playing a game

[06:59] That's got a lot of work to be done. No like you're actually it's the opposite like you're there's so much in it that you're kind of excited

[07:07] Because you're like oh my god. There's so much to explore. There's so much to do and yes that is probably the case

[07:12] It's just baby. What is going on down there?

[07:15] Like I like time baby that you know I do my show at 10 a.m

[07:22] It's like kids

[07:24] Daddy's trying to pay for college up here

[07:29] I

[07:32] Hear it. I'm literally trying to have a in the middle of a train of thought and

[07:38] It sounds like War of War 3 down there

[07:45] There's a lot in there and I think you know that's why like I

[07:51] Here's a thing is like when when you buy a Harry Potter

[07:55] You feel like you're getting your money's worth because it's Harry Potter

[07:59] It's like all the assets like everything's there and like there is a sense of

[08:04] They're gonna balance it out better and it's easier to balance it out and work with what they've got

[08:12] Then to like you know not have

[08:17] That you know then to not have like the assets. It's just that simple

[08:22] All right, let me go here Dexter Pimball is coming you think so I don't think so

[08:27] They want to be live streamers

[08:30] My kids walk a walk of right here

[08:33] Sorry, it's just in live chat here. I was in I was in a

[08:37] Super chat mode for something I'm figuring this whole thing out. I do need a tutorial from Carrie Hardy

[08:41] I know how to do these super chats

[08:45] You know look so I think Potter oh that's why people are like yeah, man like it's like they went and got a theme nobody thought they could get

[08:53] They they've got everything in it now they need to just like you know what I'm saying like this feels like

[08:58] You know when you ever watch a hell's kitchen

[09:02] No, I actually mean kitchen nightmare you ever see kitchen nightmare

[09:05] When Gordon Ramsay goes over to a restaurant and he looks at their menu and like

[09:11] He's like why are there 85 things on this menu like what are you doing?

[09:16] You're an Italian restaurant just serve them the 20 classics and you'll be much better

[09:21] Your kitchen will be less stressed and everyone who dines here will have a better experience that's Jersey Jack right now

[09:29] They need their Gordon Ramsay to go over there and be like you're serving 96 dishes

[09:37] You're got too much going on you got eight things going on at the screen at once. That's like bringing a

[09:43] Customer eight dishes at once even though they might all be fun

[09:48] Eating eight things all at once isn't enjoyable

[09:51] So what is it and I I still don't understand why they don't understand this after all these years

[09:59] Stop bringing so much out at once in a game

[10:04] It's just not fun

[10:07] It's not like I want to focus on quidditch. I want to feel like I'm in a game of quidditch you don't ever

[10:15] I want to feel like you know, I'm in this moment with the bus or

[10:21] Harry running at the train station going through the wall to get to Hogwarts flying car like you don't

[10:28] like stuff's just happening

[10:30] And bills playing for 48 hours straight

[10:35] You can't stop bill brand is from playing 48 hours straight

[10:41] So look but in the end

[10:45] You know you you want to get what you pay for and Harry Potter is giving you more than most pins will ever give you

[10:53] And I think that's why the response has been so positive

[10:56] I think that's why people have ordered this game and I think it's gonna raise the bar for Jersey Jack

[11:03] I think what really gets exciting to me is like Steve Richie's next game

[11:10] It's gonna get exciting. I definitely think

[11:16] Mark Sidon has probably

[11:19] Heard the feedback needs to do a little bit more magic in his game next game. I

[11:25] Look forward to seeing you know the future of Jersey Jack. I think Jersey Jack's gonna be

[11:30] You know the portfolio of games will be really divided. They'll have their early games that were loaded mechanically a lot more mechanical issues

[11:39] Overbaked games overly complex games

[11:42] I think I still don't think they've like nailed it yet

[11:48] I think this game when it comes to theme integration and

[11:54] Like like this game to me nails it the best

[11:59] Then I think Elton John does and then I think I

[12:04] Don't even think Harry Potter like like again just so much going on. I think I

[12:09] You know, I just

[12:12] I really wish I could sit in on the creative meetings at Jersey Jack when

[12:19] Keith and and and Joe Katz start mapping out what their what their thoughts are and I just don't know like who's pushing back on any of their ideas

[12:29] I don't think anybody is

[12:32] So I think that's an issue

[12:39] So retro Aussie said that Wizard of Oz is still the best pinball ever made

[12:45] The problem with Wizard of Oz is is the way it here's my issue with Wizard of Oz

[12:53] It's stunning

[12:55] It's loaded it's theme integrated perfectly

[12:59] The biggest mistake in Wizard of Oz is

[13:03] Even though it's a wide body

[13:06] There's no flow at all in the game

[13:09] like none and so all the shots are up the center and

[13:14] It's like a brick fest when you go left and right on the game

[13:19] It's also a game correct me if I'm wrong. There's only two flippers, right?

[13:23] I mean on the lower playfield. I believe there's only two on the lower playfield

[13:27] Then there's the upper upper playfield flippers

[13:30] The other issue with was that I just I almost feel like this is the main reason I would never own a Wizard of Oz

[13:38] There's a third flipper down there in the lower. Okay. Um

[13:43] I

[13:44] Just hate the left

[13:47] Outlane drain. There's no way to make it more narrow

[13:51] that pin

[13:53] brutally

[13:54] brutally

[13:56] drains on the left out lane worth the state fair and

[14:00] And it's like it's like they designed it to drain to get to that save

[14:05] Savior ball modes

[14:08] Just brutal

[14:11] Yeah, I mean I could put a rubber band over the left out lane and that would fix it

[14:16] But was you know, like was was 6500 bucks

[14:21] The wood and apron so beautiful

[14:25] You know when Jack said this is gonna be our worst game he lied because it's still one of their best

[14:31] All right, so should we talk about King Kong?

[14:40] Enzo and 904 pinball design King Kong needs more love and

[14:47] Let's talk about why I think Kong is

[14:52] The wrong game at the wrong time for the wrong company

[14:57] The problem with King Kong is

[15:00] Stern went cheap on it

[15:03] Keith, Ellen did his job

[15:07] But Stern went cheap on the game the response to King Kong is not an indictment of

[15:14] Ellen's game as a as a pinball gameplay experience the indictment on King Kong and the resistance

[15:21] To celebrate the game

[15:24] A few things it is the community pushing back against Stern being so cheap and not getting the King Kong license properly

[15:32] Not licensing any of the Kong movies not licensing the Empire State Building not even licensing the iconic imagery of Kong

[15:39] That is that has appeared through culture over the years

[15:44] Then the next cheap move to slap on the same art package onto all three models

[15:51] So cheap why is it rushed? Why did they rush the art package on King Kong?

[15:56] That so what you're seeing now

[15:59] Is a pushback against the company that cut corners and the community saying

[16:06] Even though this might be a great game

[16:08] We're tired of you cutting corners and we're not buying into your

[16:13] Expensive game when you're gonna cut corners like this

[16:17] I don't care that it's an Ellen pin. I don't care that it shoots great. You cut corners

[16:22] You know, and there's also mechanical issues with the game and I'm sorry

[16:26] But we remember what you gave us in Godzilla for $10,500. I'm not gonna go run at a $13,000 unlicensed King Kong game

[16:35] Or assetless King Kong game. It is licensed, but it's assetless

[16:39] So I think that is why you are seeing the community pretty universally

[16:46] Like I don't care like I'll play one on location. I'll play one on a show, but you know

[16:52] It doesn't matter how good the game is I think people are over it

[16:58] Kong's flailing right arm sent this

[17:02] Look I think

[17:05] The

[17:08] I just think it's

[17:11] It's a poor man's Godzilla

[17:14] It's a poor man's jaws even I would much rather have jaws 50th than any version of King Kong I

[17:21] Just would

[17:25] All right, so Conti Dinda

[17:29] Said the biggest problem with King Kong is Harry Potter

[17:32] You're right

[17:34] You absolutely right

[17:36] You're gonna release an assetless King Kong for $13,000 with no topper

[17:43] Right with the same art package and I can go for 15 I can get this Harry Potter CE with this really unique art package

[17:52] There's you know, I mean even though the top are sucks at least they give you a topper

[17:56] I'm just not seeing the value and when you see Harry Potter next to King Kong

[18:02] Frank is here Frank can just Frank Frank and I remember Frank when we looked at

[18:07] Harry Potter CE next to a King Kong premium

[18:11] Which is basically the same as a King Kong Ellie

[18:14] It makes that King Kong look like a $6,000 game like it it it the Kong is dull

[18:20] It is boring. It isn't like claw it just it it looks cheap everything about it looks dated

[18:27] Stern's inability to increase its platform to bring out spike three

[18:33] Say what you will about Jersey Jack gameplay. This is a beauty look at this cabinet. It's beautiful

[18:39] Stern's

[18:41] Are you know a stern alley cause more than this you can go get a guns or no is a CE now for like 10

[18:48] Like maybe nine even right? I think they're like going for like nine now

[18:52] Maybe eight. I don't even know. I don't care. I'm never getting rid of this. I think I think there's gonna be a you know as more newbies

[18:58] Coming to the hobby. You want to collect JJPs these things are gonna, you know, they're not gonna keep moving forever

[19:03] Um

[19:07] Let's see what do we got here anniversary Kong now. They're not gonna make an anniversary of King Kong

[19:13] So the EU tariff is now 30% sinking predator predator was never gonna sell with with or without tariffs doesn't matter

[19:25] I don't know where spike three is I think I think Stern's stalling. I think they're stalling

[19:30] I think they're stalling. I think they're gonna like I'm I'm assuming it's gonna be Star Wars

[19:37] And more and more people are telling me it's Star Wars episode four five and six more and more people are telling me that in

[19:45] conjunction with it

[19:46] There's also going to be another Star Wars home pin for with a Costco deal associated with it

[19:53] And if that's the case like I'm buying if John Borg

[19:58] makes

[20:00] Star Wars four five and six and

[20:03] It's got actual fun stuff to shoot at and

[20:07] uses magnets with force grabbing and letting him falcon and hyper drives and I mean I'm buying it. I'm buying it

[20:16] I um, I I love Star Wars. It's it's a bigger theme than Harry Potter

[20:24] John Borg already made Star Wars four five and four five six well he's gonna make it again

[20:30] He made the daddy east one. I wasn't even aware of that. I'm pretty good on my pinball history

[20:35] He made the daddy east four five six Star Wars

[20:39] Because I thought Steve Richie made it

[20:43] Did John Borg make the original one back in the day?

[20:52] Space balls two

[20:55] Okay, he did make the original

[21:00] All right, let's talk a little bit about barrels of fun because I was just reading naps arcade and and he was wrote a story about a rumor that

[21:10] These guys had my dream theme as a license, but they didn't lost it

[21:16] That that barrels of fun had big trouble in little China

[21:20] I mean, I don't know these rumors and you know, you know me I signed an NDA to hear about a few titles. I can't talk about the titles

[21:26] They told me

[21:28] Obviously, I love the big trouble theme. I've been I've been advocating for a big trouble a little China game forever

[21:35] Um

[21:37] So they're not gonna make it so I you know like

[21:40] Losing a theme happens. I mean it it's happened to other companies. I just I think um I

[21:48] Think dune is um

[21:50] Is um

[21:53] I you know, I keep saying on my shows. I think it's a it's a race for them

[21:59] They're the problem they're gonna have is

[22:04] Is distribution and exposure? So the more people get exposed to this game physically

[22:10] the more

[22:12] likely they are to get more orders the problem is is

[22:16] It's it's it's hard for them to get in front of a large volume of people with this game

[22:23] Uh, I know I know the electric bat arcade had some issues with their dune. They sent it back like they had that many mechanical issues with the game

[22:33] uh, kale had to send it back

[22:35] um

[22:37] I'm not hearing nearly as many I know I mean locations are are are putting a lot of plays on

[22:43] uh, I just I just worry still like we i just worried that that theme will always be a big Achilles heel and

[22:56] And and and it's another one of these examples where I just wish I was in the boardroom

[23:03] When they were deciding where to invest their money and time and effort

[23:08] And I just would have been a vote against this theme

[23:14] I don't think it's a great theme for the pinball buying demographic

[23:19] I think they've done a great job with it

[23:22] But as I say it's like it's like making a really delicious eggplant dish

[23:28] It you some people like it, but most prefer other things

[23:32] Some people are gonna like dune, but most of the pinball buying demo at these prices is not

[23:39] um

[23:41] You know is not attracted to this there's more nostalgia and attraction to evil dead one and two than even this for the for the demo that's buying these games

[23:49] So I think david vines and the team over there

[23:53] You know, they they took a big risk. They they went and made a really beautiful pin and they went and got all the assets

[24:01] um

[24:03] But the market will do what the market does and the fact that this game didn't sell out still not sold out

[24:12] I don't know how many they've sold

[24:14] Uh, you know, they're just trickling out they they're not going out in large. It's it's it's a race. They're in a race against their own

[24:24] monthly fixed cost

[24:26] versus

[24:28] You know because remember like if you're not getting a consistent good number of games out of week

[24:33] It's expensive to to have these manufacturing pinball companies

[24:37] Keeping the lights on paying all those employees

[24:41] It's it's not cheap. So I wish them the best

[24:46] I just think um

[24:49] You know, I think they they just need to make better decisions and and I mean that and I've said that to david

[24:55] I'll say to you guys I don't say maliciously. I say it

[25:00] Because there is not any room anymore for for error when it comes to

[25:06] Getting the theme wrong. I don't think anyone should be getting themes wrong

[25:11] Now it's not just theme selection right we've seen we're seeing this

[25:16] With predator. I know I saw Brenda behind me too

[25:20] We saw this with predator um, she get Brenda to come say hi. She looks so nice in her

[25:24] in her

[25:26] Summer dress

[25:30] Babe, I don't um, Brenda. I'm a little confused why no one's like everyone's still downstairs banging on the bongos like is it was is part of the plan

[25:42] Really, okay, can you come say hi to everybody?

[25:46] They would love to they would love to they would love to congratulate you on Katie Taylor's

[25:52] Victoria's third match with Amanda Serrano

[25:57] Katie Taylor won that fight. I don't think she won the last one, but this one come say hi

[26:02] Come yeah, come a blow a kiss to them and they're giving money. They're like you look at this Brenda

[26:07] I mean, I don't want to say it, but I tell my I tell Brenda all the time only fans and this house is paid for

[26:13] Don't you know, you have to take your clothes off you could just say something sexy and Irish and people will pay

[26:17] Um, I know I know trying to get try to get it. You know work for the cause

[26:28] Um, yeah, but like you make predator and

[26:32] You got predator with no Arnold and it's dead on arrival like so you got a theme that was perfect

[26:40] Oh retro Aussie

[26:42] We're glad you're here. We're glad you're here

[26:45] I

[26:48] I saw Superman yesterday. I haven't talked about it yet and I walked out of the theater

[26:52] I want to go see it again. I kind of maybe was not in the right mindset to see it

[26:57] the um

[26:58] The 3d was terrible on the screen. I saw it on like there was something weird going on with the 3d

[27:05] Where because there's so much white and the way they shot the movie so bright that I just kept seeing this like

[27:12] Almost like foggy-ness over this over like the screen

[27:18] That was just so distracting, but here is my overall take. I think

[27:24] Superman

[27:26] was like

[27:28] Trying to be guardians of the galaxy. I do like there's too many characters

[27:31] paper thin character development

[27:34] paper thin storyline

[27:36] I it just felt like a stupid movie like it was like just like a dumb down version

[27:41] Of Superman and it just didn't have like heart and soul and I don't know

[27:46] I just miss like manist deal. I missed the Christopher Reeves Superman

[27:51] I just the way the way

[27:53] He told the story even just from the very geckos like what why are we just getting dropped in in some

[28:00] overly rushed overly complex

[28:03] Like no like I want to see that baby

[28:07] wrapped up in krypton, you know and

[28:11] Parents

[28:13] Struggling to get him out before the planet is destroyed. You know, I want to see

[28:18] I just felt like it with the whole thing was just

[28:22] I don't know like like it's like it's like it's it's what made me sad

[28:25] It's like the whole movie just felt like all right, so he's just making this movie assuming that everybody watching it has seen the other Superman movies

[28:32] And it doesn't want to retread the same territory which I felt back because I'm like

[28:36] I just felt like this is what sucks is like kids now like if this if you're a kid and this is your Superman movie I feel bad

[28:47] Yeah, the whole thing felt rushed. I just felt the whole thing was just rushed

[28:50] I

[29:05] I mean for those guys that loved it like wait like wait did you love about it?

[29:10] I mean again, I will I walked out with maybe an hour left to go in it, so like

[29:15] It was it the last hour where it all comes together

[29:21] I

[29:24] Don't know I'll go see it again

[29:27] I I don't know I just really was expecting it to

[29:32] To hit with more impact than it did and and it just all it also just felt like

[29:41] It felt like

[29:43] The costumes were so cheap it felt like I saw

[29:46] Like these people were just cosplay characters at Comic Con like that's how cheap the costumes all looked like everything from the leather jackets to the masks

[29:56] They had on I was like this. I've seen better superhero costumes at Comic Con than I am in this like movie

[30:08] I don't I don't think the uh the the whole woke go woke go broke is accurate on this movie at all

[30:14] I think the issue was

[30:17] Is that the director did interviews and and made it about that but you know like it is funny that

[30:24] Superman you know they made this movie like a year ago

[30:27] Superman gets arrested for being an illegal immigrant and

[30:31] Get you know sent to jail without due process as like wow could it could in a picked a worst time

[30:38] To then go around you know parading him as as that

[30:41] Oh

[30:43] There hasn't been a good Jurassic Park movie since like Jurassic Park

[30:53] I

[30:57] Don't know what you hear I kill you and try it now. I don't know. I thought I thought I'd have the house up here

[31:03] I I normally do this in the garage. I thought I thought the area I don't

[31:08] I'm sorry again. I appreciate you put it up with it

[31:14] I just thought the whole thing like with like these interdimensional

[31:19] portals and like you know Lex Luthor like watching a fight with Superman up in his tower like it was a

[31:26] Like an ESPN booth like the whole thing was just stupid like what is this is so dumb like it's so dumb

[31:33] I

[31:35] I don't know I think you know, it's like it's like when the last few transformer movies came out and they were horrible

[31:41] And then I go and run tomatoes the audience scores like 95 and I'm like okay. I guess I guess what people accept as good movies now is just beyond me

[31:52] Jurassic Park 3 was that Jurassic World the first one

[31:57] I

[32:02] Look some of you guys

[32:05] Some of you guys like every pinball machine. So I'm not surprised. You know, you just want to have fun

[32:19] Superman dies no

[32:22] All right, so let's get back to pinball. So we've got King Kong sort of

[32:28] Not really making much waves

[32:30] Kong people love it Harry Potter

[32:33] People love it

[32:35] Predators dead on arrival. Let's just really quickly go through the hobby cuphead supposedly coming out this month with full code known's gonna buy it

[32:43] Christopher franchise Beetlejuice or Gremlins will come out in December and sell out on in one

[32:49] One minute

[32:51] He knows it. I know it. We all know it. I already already ordered it. I don't even know what the theme is

[32:55] I already ordered it bug and Luke already got me hooked up

[32:58] It's nice when you know the mayor, you know when you know the mayor. You don't need to know the cops

[33:03] So I give up like Luke I want one

[33:07] All right

[33:08] Evil dead is

[33:10] Evil dead evil dead thread doesn't pop up much on pin sight because everyone's loving it

[33:14] I mean, that's really what pin sight is. It's like where you go to hear complaints

[33:19] You know when people are loving their games the pin sight thread is inactive

[33:26] Um, what else is going on? So we got

[33:32] Where where is

[33:34] Where is the

[33:35] Merlin version of medieval madness does anyone like did any of you guys order that game?

[33:41] Didn't they sell like a thousand or twelve hundred of them something crazy like that?

[33:49] Evil dead

[33:52] Yeah

[33:54] If the game plays well get it. I don't care about the theme

[33:58] See that's just like weird to me

[34:01] I mean, I guess what's weird to me is like

[34:04] so audio

[34:06] audio enslaved

[34:09] To say you don't care about the theme

[34:11] Like for for me that's like

[34:14] That would be how I would play a game on location

[34:16] I'll play everything on location regardless of theme but to buy a pin to own it

[34:23] You don't care about the theme when you when you buy something

[34:29] That's the part I don't get

[34:34] You were told end of April and medieval madness

[34:39] Um, I you know

[34:43] I think um

[34:46] Chicago gaming company is is is terrible

[34:50] I don't like what they do. I don't like how they they don't communicate

[34:58] Let's talk about touch pinball right now

[35:02] I'll make you a bet

[35:04] I'll make you a bet that

[35:07] Raza will be out next instead of back to the future

[35:11] I

[35:13] I 100% think

[35:16] Raza

[35:18] Gums out first

[35:22] I don't think we're going to see back to the future until October of 2026

[35:29] There won't be as many razas made as Alice's that is 100% confirmed

[35:36] Alice's adventures in Wonderland is

[35:39] um

[35:41] Is beautiful

[35:44] It is what it is and I think people are enjoying this implicitly of the pin. I mean it I I've been very honest about

[35:53] Oh my god Brenda like seriously Brenda seriously

[35:57] This has been the longest exit is it like almost 11 running

[36:02] You're late. It's 1052. Oh my god. Put a put a dodo in that baby's mouth

[36:10] The garage who calls it a garage

[36:13] It's a garage

[36:16] No, no, no, no, no

[36:18] Now she's gonna be mad at me all day you ever do you ever like piss off your wife at like 11 a.m. And like

[36:28] And then all day like you just get like the cold shoulder all day all day

[36:35] Because I didn't do my show in the garage

[36:43] Um all right

[36:46] So the

[36:49] The thing is this

[36:51] for some weird reason

[36:55] There's been a obsession with J-pop

[36:59] I I got bit by the J-pop lore

[37:03] It's easy it's easy to get bit by it

[37:06] when you see the

[37:08] Zambietti artwork and the Mad Andrews artwork and all the you know the loadiness of the magic girl game like it really is like

[37:14] Wow, and then you like then you realize man

[37:18] This is garbage

[37:21] But what's weird to me is that certain individuals

[37:25] Melvin is one of them

[37:27] Chris Turner is another

[37:29] Robert Mueller was another

[37:32] The only one who's coming out of this in a successful fashion will be Melvin

[37:37] Because Melvin did the smart thing

[37:40] Chris Turner tried to follow in his pathway. Why do you think Chris Turner offered

[37:45] 500

[37:46] Merlin's arcades

[37:48] Because he saw Melvin sell 500 Alice's

[37:52] But you know Melvin

[37:54] Melvin had the art he had the you know he had a better overall looking game

[38:01] The

[38:04] Thing about all these J-pop games

[38:07] From just a pure pinball standpoint

[38:10] They're all terrible

[38:13] Everybody knows it like everybody knows it J-pop

[38:17] Was a hack

[38:20] He

[38:22] Is an art director

[38:24] He has wacky ideas

[38:26] But he needed the team at Bally Williams

[38:30] To create

[38:33] What made people love about him?

[38:35] Do you think John Papaduke invented the theater of magic trunk

[38:40] Or the shooting stars or the disappearing magnet genie? Do you think he actually he himself

[38:46] Did any of that work

[38:49] No nothing

[38:51] When he went to go make his magic happen

[38:56] He couldn't execute anything

[38:59] Okay

[39:00] So

[39:01] He is a little bit of a hack and I've said this before

[39:05] I think that Bally Williams engineers made a lot of those Bally Williams designers

[39:10] Into rock stars that they you know they they they got a lot more credit than they really deserved because of how good the Bally Williams team was

[39:19] You know and look and John but he's a great art director

[39:22] The one thing John does so well is he makes a game beautiful

[39:26] He understands how to stand over a game and make it look stunning

[39:29] The biggest bone hit at mistake ever was I always say this was American pinball

[39:36] When they had a J-pop mad Andrews art directed Houdini

[39:40] They let Joe Balser and Josh Kugler

[39:45] Just like like redo Houdini and make it ten times uglier

[39:51] Like like literally

[39:53] Joe Balser could have just made Houdini work on top of the art direction

[39:59] That J-pop and mad Andrews created and they would have sold five times as many Houdinis

[40:04] And it would have been stunning and it would have been way more fun to own it

[40:08] Instead they made this dark ugly steam punk version of Houdini that sucks

[40:14] Compared to what J-pop art directed so and I like I believe this about people everyone's good at something

[40:21] J-pop's really good at art direction and they shelved his art direction and they owned they own the rights to all that art

[40:29] stupid

[40:31] um

[40:32] But for some reason for some reason

[40:36] Melvin all these they they bought all the johns

[40:41] Decade long meandering like that's what they bought

[40:45] Now the reason why Melvin was smart

[40:47] Few things

[40:49] He made Alice a working game in a year

[40:53] And he made it a commercially viable product and it is now out in the market

[40:59] Say what you will about the gameplay or the code it doesn't matter game exists

[41:03] He saved Dutch pinball with that game, okay

[41:07] He also now is putting raza into the Dutch pinball platform

[41:13] Raza

[41:14] Think about it all the money Robert Mueller spend and Steve Bout and all all this all the money that went into raza

[41:20] He has it all doesn't have to code the games fully coded. He's not gonna use the pin bar

[41:25] It's not gonna have that stupid pin bar on the apron

[41:27] You know the lockdown bar screen remember that stupid thing. It's not gonna have that

[41:32] But raza is coming out and it's gonna be it's gonna he's gonna sell them all

[41:38] He's not gonna make 500 he never wanted to make 500. Allis is okay

[41:44] Melvin's awesome dude by the way

[41:46] Like I've met a lot of people in this hobby and I and I can say this

[41:52] I think I've met one of my best friends in pinball in Melvin and he's just a cool dude. He gets it

[41:58] He gets it. He's a guy who gets stuff done. You know

[42:01] Yeah, the guy who doesn't get stuff done is good as Melvin is very very takes longer to get stuff done

[42:06] Like it's taken a while to get these games out

[42:09] um

[42:11] So like raza will most likely follow Alice if Alice doesn't end up making all 500 it's it's no skin off his back

[42:20] um and so like

[42:23] I think we're gonna see Alice raza and then back to the future

[42:28] In that order

[42:31] I think we're gonna see some pinball companies

[42:33] fold over the next two years and

[42:38] and

[42:40] And these are companies are there I think they're just gonna fold because

[42:44] It's just not gonna make much sense like I think the pinball brothers are in trouble

[42:49] Obviously American pinball if they're not if they haven't folded already. I think cup heads of the last game. They're ever gonna make

[42:57] I think home pin gone. I think um

[43:03] Turner pinball is in big trouble. I do. I I Chris. I mean, you know, you know me. I mean personally like nothing but respect for you man

[43:09] But it's just this I don't again

[43:13] The reason why like if these companies had to survive based on their pinball decisions

[43:19] They wouldn't survive. I don't know what people's

[43:23] Ancillary incomes are or if they have other annuities that are fronting these operate

[43:29] You know, I don't know like I tell people this all the time. I'm like Chris Turner's

[43:32] Great granddad could have been an oil of tycoon. I don't know

[43:36] Right. I don't know. I don't know anything about anybody like financially what can float them?

[43:41] Amtron could float American pinball forever if they wanted to I just don't think Mukesh cares anymore. I think he's out of it

[43:48] um

[43:51] You know bread abyss and the abyss family can float jjp forever is there's no jeopardy of closing the doors here

[43:59] so

[44:01] But as I've said to

[44:04] As I say all the time

[44:05] It's not about money for a lot of these companies like you need to be chasing legacy. You need to be chasing great games

[44:12] My christler vanderbill

[44:14] I don't know. I mean, I thought christler's company was like a snack delivery company like he delivered the snacks to deeproot

[44:20] And that's how he connected with robert mule

[44:26] I'm sure robert was his best customer because he was using stolen money to fund all of deeproot pinballs

[44:31] operations

[44:37] Did you follow up about marty robins appearing on the podcast last week? Well

[44:42] Um, we talked about it. I don't know what what what what what what follow up

[44:48] Should I be doing? I don't know what follow up means

[44:54] um, I think marty robins

[44:56] Can do what he wants

[44:58] I don't think he's going to be

[45:01] embraced or accepted by most of the pinball community

[45:05] um, and I think

[45:07] He's lost all credibility

[45:11] And I also just think jefft y'all this has also lost a lot of credibility because jeff has always allowed his platform

[45:19] To be a place where some of these people can come on and and and again hook people and then take no

[45:26] Accountability when these companies go belly up like none

[45:29] Steve bowed and did it with deeproot marty robins did it with haggis

[45:34] And I get it, but now like there's the it's almost like there's no consequences

[45:41] And again with marty I always felt like he was always like

[45:46] Like it was slimy of him

[45:49] To do shows in the middle of like

[45:52] So many people wondering what's going on with haggis

[45:55] And he would like refuse to talk about the company

[45:58] It's like marty you're like the number two guy over there

[46:03] And you're gonna go on and just pretend like

[46:06] Your house is not on fire

[46:08] And you should just be and it's not just it's that I'll take this and then again. I don't know the guy personally

[46:15] But the thing I never liked is how

[46:18] Smug and how much he was always laughing hysterically all every week

[46:24] While his own customers were suffering

[46:27] And I and I think he's smug and I think he just doesn't you know he only cares about marty really like I mean that like and

[46:35] I get some of you might know him and you might know a different marty

[46:38] I'm allowed to have my opinions about marty and it is what it is

[46:43] Sent you something you can use on your live shows. Thank you, mr. Franchi. I'm glad you're hanging out here brother

[46:49] um

[46:51] Well, you know look

[46:54] I don't even think like that podcast is is final round is that even still a thing like

[47:01] TPN's not even around anymore. So like I again like I think the people that have

[47:07] stayed in it and have committed and have put in the hard work. They still have the audiences

[47:14] And I'm you know, I'm happy to see franchi where he's landed

[47:18] He knows he

[47:20] And you know franchi knows I have always felt this way he he created the best

[47:25] produced pinball podcasts ever

[47:29] um

[47:30] Ever I know exactly what went into making that show and it it is uh

[47:36] It is incredible amount of work for very little

[47:40] return

[47:42] um

[47:43] But I think in the end

[47:47] I

[47:49] I think um marty should really be asking for

[47:54] In apology and I think he should be working with

[47:58] Some of those customers to get their money back somehow

[48:03] Unfortunately Damien set up an LLC and he'll just walk away

[48:08] He'll walk away without any consequences

[48:13] I mean do I still think Damien was the number one culprit yet

[48:16] I think for some of you out there you have to remember when I was going hard at haggis pinball

[48:20] You know, there's another example where like canators the bad guy he's not he's not

[48:24] I nobody else was going hard at them like I was

[48:28] He was lying to his customers lying lying lying

[48:32] And it was another example and this is why canators pinball podcasts will always have a following

[48:37] I think I'll always have a lot of respect from the community

[48:39] Even if people won't publicly say it on like Facebook pages because

[48:44] Nobody else was looking out for the community

[48:47] Nobody go show me where the shows were where there was outrage

[48:51] When they were faking their production video with marty's shoes in the corner

[48:56] Like it was so clear they were like manipulating and lying about

[49:01] how

[49:03] Far along they were with production how things were going they were robbing Peter to pay Paul and the biggest gang again

[49:09] You have to remember there's like a lot of revisionist history in his hobby

[49:13] Look at everybody who helped shill sentar when they knew the fathom house was on fire

[49:21] Carry already carry. I love you, but man. Come on man. Like you know you remember what carry did

[49:27] Zach was the

[49:29] exclusive dealer

[49:30] again

[49:32] These these were like very they these people knew

[49:36] All too well

[49:37] What the they've seen this rob Peter to pay Paul before they've seen it multiple times

[49:42] And still there was a lot of support

[49:45] For that sentar launch and you got to go back and watch it

[49:48] There was a lot of money on the line and when and again

[49:51] I'm just I hate to go back to this stuff because I think everybody's moved on like I've moved on with Zach and care like no one's

[49:57] There's no bad blood, but but but Damien turned people into like his

[50:04] um, you know, they people I don't think they willingly knew knowingly but they should have known a little bit better

[50:12] Is my point

[50:13] Right he was a crook and some people got in bed. I don't again. I don't think people maliciously got in bed with Damien

[50:22] but when I was

[50:24] when I was like

[50:27] Like raising the alarm bells or ringing the alarm bells

[50:30] That's when I started to get like threats like legal threats

[50:34] And people threatening me like

[50:37] Because people were writing checks to Damien and they and they were coming at me

[50:41] Like I was the one that was trying to hurt their investment

[50:45] And all of it's gone now. It's all of it is is is is what her what are

[50:52] Under the bridge

[50:53] I haven't had any any issues or drama or bad bad vibes with anybody not you know other than Don like he's and then retro route

[51:04] There's only two guys right now in the entire content space right now that refused to talk to me

[51:11] Well, maybe Rob and suit but it's right now. It's just Don and it's retro Ralph for some reason Ralph

[51:20] Has taken his ball and gone home. I don't get it. I don't get it like we had a fun chain going with Jamie and Cal

[51:26] I don't get it

[51:27] But again, I love it. I love it when people like just want to like

[51:32] You know pretend like canada don't exist. It's cool

[51:35] But yeah, I've had nothing but good correspondence with Zach with Greg with

[51:39] Orbiter Albert is back as a club member

[51:42] He cancelled and he said he would rejoin and he did and Albert I want to thank you for coming back to the show

[51:52] Um

[51:53] Let's see

[51:57] The thing is gang is

[52:00] There they're when you look at some of the like the it's a really you know when people ask me like what do you talk about on a pinball podcast and can you when you think about it

[52:10] We like pinball right we love pinball

[52:13] All right, that's the foundation

[52:15] What makes pinball podcasting and this show interesting is

[52:20] Simply this

[52:21] We also are part of a hobby where there's there's liars

[52:25] There's crooks there's thieves right there's there's artistic geniuses

[52:32] There's creative like there's creativity

[52:35] There's mechanical magic

[52:38] There's baron like mailed in corner cutting happy like it's this hobby

[52:44] It is a is a microcosm

[52:47] Of like all of these really interesting

[52:52] Human like behaviors that are fascinating to us like crimes have been committed crimes

[52:59] There are literally like crimes

[53:02] Like that that are worthy of a TV show

[53:06] Robert Mueller stole 61 million dollars to fund a pinball venture

[53:11] And couldn't get a single game out

[53:14] Robert Mueller went up on stage

[53:18] There's another seawater I'm gonna use he went up on stage at tpf with his funky bunch

[53:24] And insulted stern pinball and said he was gonna make more games in one year than sternus like you know

[53:30] Has ever made or something crazy like that then all the other pinball manufacturers combined

[53:34] He was gonna make more games in one year than all of them and you know what the crowd did

[53:39] Nothing

[53:40] So not only do we have crooks we have another thing in this hobby cowards

[53:45] cowards

[53:49] I had to be the first one at tpf when Mirko got up there

[53:55] And wanted to sell us a toad in 2.0 kit

[53:59] While his playfields on guns and roses were falling apart

[54:02] There were other content creators in the room

[54:04] There were other people in the room there were there was some of the pin-side loud mouse cow words

[54:09] They said nothing go watch the video

[54:13] Who stood up and said how dare you come here

[54:18] And and and refuse to answer questions about your playfields falling apart

[54:25] Cowards

[54:27] Now if there's something I'm not I'm not a coward. I will say stuff. I should have been a lawyer. I should not have been in PR should have been a lawyer

[54:35] So like you know it every way a lot of tough talk on pin-side

[54:39] You know a lot of those tough guys on pin-side when you see them at shows you that you'll realize why they they don't say anything in a seminar room

[54:47] And he realized real quick like who's the keyboard commando

[54:51] They wouldn't they could never do this like they can most of them could never do what I do or carry does or zack does or pranj

[54:57] Like they can never they can never like or like bug or look they can never grab a mic

[55:03] Let you see them and be transparent about who they are and then say this stuff they want to say

[55:09] Now I in doing this for 12 years. I know the lion gang like you know, and I'm not trying to go to war against pinball companies

[55:16] But when there was clearly like criminal behavior happening and lying

[55:22] line

[55:24] It was it was crazy how nobody was saying anything

[55:28] Walt would look what's funny man. He's entertaining. He is

[55:32] I mean he always feels like you know, I know he's he looks like he's doing it. I don't know if that's like his apartment or just any he he he

[55:41] I don't curse

[55:43] It's it's easy to like even more entertaining just flying off the handle

[55:49] I've said two things. I don't do I don't curse and I don't use the Lord's name in vain because because people's

[55:54] Kids listen to the show

[55:58] Like I don't think Ralph is a Johnny cumleyly I think I think he's like

[56:09] I think he respects his relationships with the manufacturers any any values that

[56:17] And it's fine like that absolutely

[56:20] That comes with the price it comes with the price like when you when you if you're trying to create content

[56:28] But he look he he's he's also benefiting from that relationship

[56:33] You know you he's benefiting

[56:36] They paid him in a pinball machine. That's a lot of money like

[56:41] But he you know, he did a service for them as well

[56:43] I I think I don't think he should not have been paid and I think he's been transparent about it

[56:48] Which is good?

[56:51] I I absolutely applaud when when content creators who are paid by a manufacturer like you just got to be transparent

[56:59] There were content creators. I won't name names who were getting kickbacks from distros for games sold

[57:05] So they're like reviewing games

[57:08] Like seemingly objectively

[57:11] Knowing that if if they sent leads to distros they were getting money

[57:16] That yeah

[57:19] The is that not an unethical move you could argue that

[57:25] Ultimately, I think the over overwhelming feeling is there is no real journalism in pinball

[57:33] There's not nobody can be like a like a true pinball like you know investigative journalist

[57:39] It doesn't make any sense like it's not that kind of space

[57:42] um

[57:43] I think Jason naps page

[57:46] Is is the best pinball website and I think he um he's on top of it

[57:51] Every week. It's great. It's awesome

[57:55] um

[57:58] I let you guys like

[58:00] um and I think that

[58:03] Our boxing company tried killing the spooky korea yesterday golf outing with open bar

[58:09] Wow

[58:12] Open bar man, you know bug

[58:15] I

[58:16] You know, it's crazy

[58:18] Sometimes people get upset when I talk about life and not just pinball, but I want I want to explain the difference I've known in um

[58:26] When I was like in my 20s in my career and I have been working in marketing and PR and we always had events

[58:32] And you know whenever you go to like an event it was like open bar like you're you know you're not gonna invite media and they pay for drinks

[58:39] We would run

[58:41] like run

[58:43] To open bar moments and just get wasted like like we're in our 20 at you know at client events

[58:50] Yeah, we were like low level employees like

[58:52] But we'd also like you know we'd be respectful

[58:54] But we'd also when it was like last call we'd all everyone would go to the bar and load up on the bud lights and put them all on the table

[59:01] And and just like have like

[59:03] 28 bud lights sitting on a table because the open bar was about to close at like 10 o'clock in night

[59:09] And you know the whole thing was like enjoy it

[59:14] Now it's like nobody young like they don't even like

[59:18] They don't even want to go to the happy hour

[59:21] They don't even want to go to the happy hour

[59:24] You invite people to happy hour now they look at you like what why do you want me to go to that you creepy old man

[59:30] It's funny to me when I was young in my career

[59:33] It was like if your boss or someone senior in your organization like thought highly of you enough to invite you out socially to build a stronger relationship with you

[59:49] You said yes

[59:51] Even if you had like other plans you know, oh no, I got I got to go out with like

[59:56] Now it is it's the opposite

[59:59] And I can't tell you how many times

[01:00:03] I'm trying to build relationships with new team members new employees

[01:00:08] You know and I'm taking to my Japanese jazz bar and they say no and and I'll tell you what I've what I've stopped doing

[01:00:15] I stopped inviting them again like

[01:00:21] If if if I'm gonna extend the olive branch like I've been in this company, you know, I'm trying hard if if

[01:00:27] Relationships work both ways, but they don't want to go they don't want to go some do some do and believe me and the ones that do

[01:00:36] The relationships make the work better

[01:00:39] So it should be

[01:00:49] Look ultimately, I just wanted to go do a good job

[01:00:52] You don't have to come drink with me and I like I don't even think everyone should drink

[01:00:55] I mean, it's it's not the best thing man. I mean, I'll tell you what I struggle with gang

[01:01:00] Living in the suburbs

[01:01:03] Uh, I feel like there's more alcohol consumption happening in suburban life than even in city life

[01:01:10] Because you have more you have more environments to drink

[01:01:14] You know what I'm saying like like I didn't have a backyard a barbecue and a you know a chill lawn chair to sit back in and just

[01:01:22] Pound, you know drinks all day long

[01:01:25] Now I do and I can walk to like beautiful restaurants and like everyone's just you know and you're in these towns where people are successful and everyone's

[01:01:34] Everyone's like

[01:01:35] enjoying life

[01:01:37] And a lot of that and I was saying this to Brenda last night I was like I was like we got to just like

[01:01:42] We got to ratchet it back and for a couple reasons like a just physically. It's not good like I don't like feeling

[01:01:50] bad the next day

[01:01:52] I like having drinks when it's a kid like in this occasion worth having you know a moment that matters

[01:01:57] That's different, you know

[01:01:59] Like it's a Friday happy hour or a Saturday date night. We also have like really young kids

[01:02:04] And you know, it's not lost on me that I didn't have kids in my 20s. I think kids in my 40s. So

[01:02:09] while I might be

[01:02:11] amongst

[01:02:13] similarly aged people

[01:02:16] Their kids might be in college or getting out of college and I have a one year old and a four year old

[01:02:23] So it's like I I want to be present with them and you need to you like it's not even a question of like if I want to be present

[01:02:32] you have to be

[01:02:34] Last night was a rough night with the kids like Cassie was up

[01:02:38] He's had some fluid in his ears

[01:02:40] So they had to do a little procedure where they had to put some tubes in both of his ears

[01:02:44] Just to drain the fluid, but you know, it's a baby. So he's feeling that sensation and it's keeping him up and the healing process has him

[01:02:52] You know has him like waking up throughout the night

[01:02:56] So it's it's hard

[01:02:59] I'm reading some of your like

[01:03:02] All right

[01:03:08] Ah

[01:03:10] I'm giving away the main box panels as a raffle

[01:03:14] You know the whole notion of like men are soft now

[01:03:20] I don't know. I mean, I don't think all men are soft now. I think um you know in the end

[01:03:27] the um

[01:03:29] The

[01:03:31] I know this is off pinball, but

[01:03:34] The movement to remove like masculinity from culture failed like it they tried like it

[01:03:42] It was pushed down from the top down by social elites

[01:03:47] To remove masculinity to remove masculine men from culture and from like being able to be a bro if you will

[01:03:56] The it failed horribly if you look at the woke movement

[01:04:00] um only I I like looking at data only eight percent of Americans were in favor of like the woke movement that really was like

[01:04:09] 2020 at all began

[01:04:11] 8% 8% so like 92% of people just didn't agree that culture should be

[01:04:18] pushing this way and it and it's failed and now we're going you know, we're overcorrecting

[01:04:25] And we're going back to a more authoritarian

[01:04:29] Sort of vibe which again, I don't think is the answer either

[01:04:34] But man, I was just thinking

[01:04:37] I

[01:04:39] Like like people just weren't so offended like they are now and I don't even think people are offended

[01:04:44] That's the thing is like it's like it's people telling you to be offended

[01:04:47] The number one thing and I know I go off on this sometimes the number one thing protect your kids against protect them

[01:04:53] If you have young kids, Gen Z kids if they have friends

[01:04:56] They're not victims

[01:04:59] They're not

[01:05:01] This notion that like everybody's a victim and should feel bad

[01:05:06] And should feel guilty and should feel empowered to fight the system

[01:05:12] Because you've been victimized by the system. Let me tell you no

[01:05:17] You're not a victim nobody cares and you're going to ruin your own happiness in life

[01:05:24] And it's just the way it is and you're not going to topple systems you're not okay. It's just the way it is

[01:05:30] So like learn how to win at the game of life. You got to be strong. You got to have some grit

[01:05:34] You got to take rejection not everybody should get an award

[01:05:39] You know, I'm saying you're gonna maybe you're gonna get fired a few times. I've been fired three times

[01:05:43] I might be fired more. It's like it life hits you like curve balls happen like you're not special

[01:05:48] Nobody cares like figure out a way to make value

[01:05:52] If AI comes out in the world don't complain about it

[01:05:56] Find a way to have a job where like you can use AI to your advantage

[01:05:59] I'll tell you a quick story. I have a nice co-worker

[01:06:02] She was working in our tech practice very low-level job mid-level job

[01:06:07] She then realized like well with AI I could help college students for potential college students

[01:06:14] create their resumes using AI

[01:06:17] She quits her job where I'm at starts a company that helps tailor people's resumes to the schools they're applying for

[01:06:25] Using AI

[01:06:27] Creates a subscription based company where they charge like five to ten thousand ten bucks a subscription like yeah

[01:06:33] Tiny little amount like can it gets a hundred thousand subscribers

[01:06:37] hundred thousand

[01:06:39] I've got six hundred and sixty on can a dispimble podcast

[01:06:44] So like I

[01:06:47] Now I should just have AI make my podcast be like

[01:06:52] AI make me a podcast

[01:06:55] Where it's canada don and retro Ralph

[01:06:59] Sitting around a table agreeing with each other

[01:07:03] I guess

[01:07:04] Maybe you could do that we could charge for that right

[01:07:10] Have you picked a favorite canadacan pizza place that I love ricos man the ricos hot oil

[01:07:14] I mean it's local domain, but it's I love it

[01:07:25] Um

[01:07:26] Yeah, no, it's the sun starting to come out

[01:07:29] I'm gonna go join the family right now and if in five minutes

[01:07:32] I just want to say this gang like I really do appreciate you guys coming here every Saturday

[01:07:36] I know we do things a little bit differently. I know I don't play as much pinball as other people

[01:07:40] I think we talk about the hobby though in a much more balanced sense because it's you remember saying like this thing is just

[01:07:49] 10% of our lives

[01:07:51] I'm more fascinated and I'm I'm more excited when I see there were two guys

[01:07:58] Fighting on my patreon last night two two dudes right two bros

[01:08:03] Like frank my one my one of my best friends frank d'Angelo fighting with bond and if you've ever been on the canada patreon chat

[01:08:10] You know bond is like one of the most prolific

[01:08:15] Members of my community. He he's got a grind to pick with jjp over some bad experiences. He had with the company

[01:08:22] And they were like they were going at it like I didn't even see everything

[01:08:25] They and it got to the point where it was like go at yourself like I'm like I know like frank the most even killed dude

[01:08:32] I know

[01:08:33] Is like cursing out bond

[01:08:36] And then you know what happened next

[01:08:39] They decided to have a phone call with each other

[01:08:42] And they had an amazing phone call and Frank's like bonds are really awesome guy

[01:08:49] And you know he's like he's real like of course he's real

[01:08:53] You know what my show does and my platform does it just I always says it allows people to vent

[01:09:00] And you get to vent

[01:09:02] about pimbal

[01:09:03] And because there's so many other areas of your life that you're not able to vent

[01:09:10] Around right you can't go vent to your boss or your wife or your kids

[01:09:15] Or your community the way you can on can eat his pinball podcast. So what happens is is all that pent up

[01:09:21] aggression

[01:09:23] Gets channel through the pinball conversation then all the sudden

[01:09:27] We're talking about pinball as if we're talking about the Gaza strip right like we are like

[01:09:32] Wait like like like Jersey Jack is like net and Yahoo

[01:09:36] Right, I mean, it's like literally like people like come at it with like that amount of intensity

[01:09:42] and it's like

[01:09:44] The name that that happens, but it happens

[01:09:48] And I'm happy that these guys just had a good conversation because I I 100% believe this I think

[01:09:56] Almost everybody in this hobby is a good guy and I mean that don't Ralph like

[01:10:02] Zach

[01:10:03] Franchi

[01:10:05] Albert like I've been to so many pinball shows

[01:10:09] there aren't really

[01:10:12] A holes they're aren't you know Neil McCray McCray bill brand is like I know all these guys like

[01:10:19] Doug Moe Jr. Iceman. I know you like everyone Greg Colton

[01:10:23] I get that there's different strokes different beliefs, but in the end

[01:10:28] all these dudes over a beer or I don't know some vegan tacos if they don't you know it's like

[01:10:36] they're all gonna

[01:10:38] find common ground

[01:10:40] And I think it's great. I think it's great and I think it's even but it's entertaining

[01:10:46] watching these grown men

[01:10:49] lose it

[01:10:51] over pinball

[01:10:52] Fall in love over something that's a pinball machine

[01:10:56] Be disappointed about a product that's a pinball machine

[01:10:59] So it's fun. It's fun

[01:11:01] And look I know it's a summertime

[01:11:03] So I do implore each and every one of you get out there take care of your bodies too

[01:11:08] I got a really nice message. Oh his name escapes me right now. Let me let me pull up

[01:11:14] And he just said like

[01:11:16] You know Chris. I want to thank you for always encouraging us

[01:11:20] To take care of our of our bodies and not just pinball

[01:11:25] And I've started working out. I've started doing Taikwondo

[01:11:29] Um, and it really you know is changing my life for the better

[01:11:34] And I think that's great and I think people

[01:11:39] Um, it's Gary Gary

[01:11:41] Gary thank you for sending that note and I mean that like I mean I was at the gym for 40 minutes before doing this show

[01:11:49] I've been riding my bike more I just think

[01:11:53] Take care of yourselves. I mean that take care of yourselves. Don't drink as much as you as you get older like don't like

[01:11:58] Don't what what you put in your body. It does matter

[01:12:04] Don't buy every pinball machine that comes out. Yeah, I know you're not. I know you're not

[01:12:24] Um and every way every way everybody

[01:12:27] Thank you for all the super chats. I really do appreciate it. I want to give a big shout out to all of my

[01:12:34] My people here um, I'm trying to think I think I can see who's

[01:13:13] I mean, it's like we're gonna keep it here on YouTube

[01:13:17] We figured out how to do

[01:13:20] We figured out how to do the um the super chats the monetization

[01:13:24] It's always fun. You know me. I've been shamelessly busking for pinball dollars since day one

[01:13:31] Should have gotten into finance. I should have been a solicitor. I should have been a lobbyist

[01:13:35] Instead of him on the pinball podcaster

[01:13:38] But I love this and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for

[01:13:42] Continuing to give me an outlet and an audience

[01:13:45] For me to do this. I I spend 95% of my day

[01:13:50] asking people permission to do what I want to do creatively the 5% of my day

[01:13:57] Where you allow me to create whatever I want whenever I want and say whatever I want it actually heals me in a way

[01:14:04] And makes me content

[01:14:06] That makes the other 95% bearable and I mean that and I think everybody needs a creative outlet

[01:14:13] I think everybody needs a hobby. I think everybody needs random friends around the world like we are

[01:14:19] That are that are connected over a common theme, all right

[01:14:24] Don and Ralph come on. It's time to bury the hatchet if you guys know them be a come on. We should just all do a round table

[01:14:31] We've all made all the jokes about each other. I wear pearls. He has an above ground pool

[01:14:36] You know, I guess some pros on right now

[01:14:39] Who cares? We're all weirdos. You know Ralph loves every game. You could put

[01:14:44] Home pins blues brothers in front of them be like this game ever this is best game ever. Can anyone doesn't play the best game ever

[01:14:51] Come on. We're all just taking the piss out of each other. Life's too short. We're all gonna die

[01:14:55] All right, everybody

[01:14:57] Be good

[01:14:59] Be good. I'm ending the stream
