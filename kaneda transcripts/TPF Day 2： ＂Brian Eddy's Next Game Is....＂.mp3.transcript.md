[00:00] I'm your host, canada. This is canada's pinball podcast coming at you from Texas pinball festival. We're gonna do a day one recap of all the stuff at the show. Um, my impressions of what I saw at the show.

[00:28] And some really, really interesting rumors about what's to happen in the pinball world. I'm gonna start with the rumors, but before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about why these shows are so awesome. They should not call it the Texas pinball festival. They should call it the Texas people festival because these shows, they're all about the people. You go to the show to hang out with your pinball friends that you haven't seen in a long time. People that you only converse with on the internet. Uh, and in other areas of

[00:58] pinball and it's so great for everyone to come together and have a shared interest that is pinball. And I love it. I love it. I thank you to everyone who came up to me and said, I love the show. Canada, uh, a super appreciate all the fans who reach out. If you're at the show, please hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com and I will do my best to find time so we can just hang out and talk pinball. Alright. Because I love it. I love, love, love talking to the fans about pinball. So here's what I want to do. You probably heard about the

[01:28] disaster. It's Jersey Jack pinball yellow brick road edition. We're going to talk a little bit about that on this edition of Canada pinball podcast. But here are the rumors. Here are the rumors that I'm hearing that I want to just throw out right now for you early in the morning in Texas. So here's the thing. The biggest rumor is that we are not going to have to wait until Midwest gaming classic to see the reveal of Steve Richie's next game black night. Now Steve Richie was here last night doing a seminar in which he revealed absolutely nothing. And I think I

[01:58] think this the show, the show organizers need to start having a little bit of a policy. We are not going to give you the mic and we are not going to let you ran out the room. If you are going to do absolutely nothing of interest of no of no news value whatsoever. I'm so tired of these tightens of pinball of these manufacturers getting up there and just spitting the same stuff over and over and they're not revealing anything new. So here's what's kind of strange. So the rumor is this that Stern is going to reveal.

[02:28] Steve Richie's next game black night 3000 guess what they're going to do it. They're going to do it this Tuesday. Okay. Yes. That's not today. Not Sunday. Not Monday. But Tuesday. So like three days from now they are going to reveal to the world black night 3000. And if you think about it. It sort of makes sense. This is what Stern likes to do. They don't like to reveal games at the show anymore. They like to reveal them via the internet and through media. And then they like to get

[02:58] them themselves like a month or so to get the game ready for a show. And so if this now all of a sudden seems like their strategy. Why reveal it at T. P. F. in which people are going to want to have the game here to play if the game is not ready. Reveal it on Tuesday. And then you have about a month to get the game ready. It will physically be at Midwest gaming classic. All right. So M. G. C. It seems to be like the show now that's getting more of the big reveals maybe J. J. has got a lot more

[03:28] cloud in the industry with his cowboy hat. But he so at M. G. C. not only will black night 3000 be there to play the other game that I'm hearing again rumor. But very strong rumor.

[03:42] The other game that I'm hearing is going to be there is going to be Willie Wonka that Jersey Jack Pimball is really aiming and working hard to bring Willie Wonka to that show.

[03:54] Which is so strange when you think about the timing of all of this who is actually buying the yellow brick road edition of Wizard of Oz. All right. But let's stop there in those two rumors. So M. G. C. we're going to see Steve Richie's new game and Jersey Jack's new game.

[04:11] Supposedly battling it out for your Pimball dollar super exciting. I love the fact that we don't have to wait very long. Which crazy to is when you think about it.

[04:21] It's stern is about to reveal a new game on Tuesday. And they didn't even start shipping. Monster's premium yet. The ability for this company to always be on to the next blows me away. It's it's it's it's like nothing I've ever seen before.

[04:38] Stern games get old so fast because they're already on to the next and on to the next. And I think it's it's really marvelous to watch them just not stop. They just keep going while every other company is either stalled or failing or trying to like figure it out.

[04:56] Stern is just on to the next on to the next now talking about being on to the next. Let's talk a little bit about now that I've slept on it at the yellow brick road edition.

[05:07] And I think it the whole thing just was a bit it was bound to fail. How do you go up there and talk for an hour when you have nothing to say other than the game is yellow. They just think about that for a minute. The game is yellow and it has sparkles. That that's pretty much the only new news they had.

[05:26] And they had to fill an hours worth of time and they had to break the bad news that they were going to charge you more money for the game now here is a hunch of mine and a listener the show also has this hunch here's a hunch that I have I think that Jersey Jack Pimball is testing the waters at 11,500 dollars because I think they're going to charge 11,500 dollars for the Willy Wonka Ellie.

[05:55] Now stop don't get mad don't scream but think about it for a minute. How can Jack stay in business and price his Ellie machines that have a ton in it. How can he stay in business if he's at the same price point as a Stern Ellie right.

[06:11] I just played pirates a few minutes ago a game has got so much in it it's embarrassing that monsters Ellie is nine thousand dollars and Jack is charging just five hundred dollars more for that game.

[06:23] So I think jack's about to take his entire business up market and he needs to and I don't know like what the realities are of people's budgets and finances.

[06:35] But if you have ninety five hundred dollars to spend on an unnecessary toy like a Pimball machine you probably have eleven thousand dollars eleven thousand five hundred dollars and so I think we're going to see that soon.

[06:47] I think Jersey Jack needs to go up market now none of that none of that excuses the complete disaster that was the yellow brick road edition and here's the thing I stood over the game this morning again.

[06:59] I wanted to just get a closer look at all of this sparkle that is supposedly worth this much more money. I don't like the game at all. I here's why I think the yellow is kind of ugly.

[07:11] It's tacky putting all that yellow and all the wire forms it just doesn't work. There's something beautiful about the Emerald City edition and the Ruby red edition and then when you see this bright

[07:23] gaudy yellow just in terms of like a color like yellow is a very aggressive and hard to take your eye away from color and I just don't like it.

[07:34] And the yellows don't even really match up with the yellow brick road. It's kind of too much and it's on all the flippers.

[07:42] It's everywhere there's yellow sparkle everywhere. It's not for me. It's not my cup of tea. I also think you just have to be out of your mind to buy this game when you can go get an Emerald City edition wizard.

[07:53] I don't think there are going to be more than 200 people who go in on this game. I feel bad for Jack and crew a little bit because I think they they literally didn't have anything to say they shouldn't have done it this way.

[08:07] And what Jack needed to do is he needed to look in a dictionary at the word limited and he needs to really understand how important it is to if you're going to say something's limited. He needs to start limiting the games.

[08:21] And it's even kind of funny because on the game itself it just says limited edition it doesn't even say like one of 200 or one of 500. So now he's just how he has this completely arbitrary and ambiguous way of of like identifying his games and I think it's I think it's kind of pathetic and I think they need to really stop acting this way they've been in the industry now way too long to be acting in such a soft morric approach.

[08:50] All right, I got to give a shout out to my friend Derek in the middle of the calamity that was yesterday's presentation, you know Derek who came on the show who loves Pirates of the Caribbean in the middle of Jack trying to explain to us how the monkey still in the game because he's on the LCD.

[09:03] You know everyone was asking questions about the the yellow brick road edition and for Derek stands up there. It is like, hey, which 1.0 code on pirates coming and I feel for the guy because

[09:15] pirates is an amazing machine compared to Wizard of Oz being news, right?

[09:20] Does that even make sense? I would just rather see them talk about pirates and what they're doing to polish the code than I would

[09:28] You know, then I would want to hear them talk about how they made Wizard of Oz seven years ago. All right, so here's my my assessment of the show so far.

[09:35] Unlike past TPS, there just aren't a lot of reveals. I mean, you can't you can't escape the absence of deep root at this show. I think we all were expecting something more at this year's TPS from a reveal standpoint, but like I said, it's not even about the games.

[09:50] The guys who hang out, everyone's here to just drink, socialize, have a good time. No one's really even here to play much pinball. And also when you're at the show, this is a thing.

[09:59] You can't really get a sense of what a game is like when you play it at a show. I'll use this as a metaphor. It's it's like walking into a room in which

[10:10] 150 movie trailers are all playing at the same time and they've all got volume on. There's video going of each one and you're walking around a room like that.

[10:20] And then you leave the room and someone says, so Chris, which one was your favorite movie? Which one are you most excited to see? And you just can't.

[10:27] You can't. It's sensory overload. The only time you can sort of get a sense of these games if you play it late at night or if you do what I just did, which is you wear your vendor your vendor wristband, the blue wristband, and you go into the

[10:42] game room at 730 in the morning and no one is in there, but a police officer making sure only vendors get in and I went in early and I turned on some games to play them a bunch.

[10:54] Because I wanted to give you my feedback on some games without any of the distractions or the noise or the crowd from the show. And here I took away a few things from some of the new games and want to talk about that now.

[11:07] Now the game that surprised me the most. And this is just because a year has gone by and I think they did a really good job improving the code of the game.

[11:15] And that game is Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. Now I just played it for maybe five or six games without any interruption. And I have to say this.

[11:23] I'm really, really impressed at where the code is in this game. The shots are still tight. They don't bother me as much as they used to. I'll talk a little bit about the shots.

[11:32] But what I love about Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is when you turn it on and you hit start. What I love about it is this. It immediately puts me into this like eerie sort of nightmare castle kind of vibe.

[11:44] There's almost like no sound in the game at all except for the crackling of fire. And it's got I love that. I love that in a world in which so many Pimball machines are just hitting you with lights and sounds and you're just confused immediately.

[11:59] It has this. It sets the stage perfectly for the theme. And even throughout the game as I was playing it a few times. I was just so impressed with how the sound and the music.

[12:11] And even the Alice Cooper callouts which a year ago, you know, I think a lot of people were criticizing it for being really mundane and boring. I now see how it kind of connects perfectly with the way the game is set up and the atmospheric sort of approach to the game.

[12:27] And I really wish more people thought about Pimball this way. I really do. I think sometimes you turn on a Pimball game and it's just like you're just you're just you're just dropped into this universe. And there's absolutely no like

[12:39] slowly introducing you to the world and putting you into the atmosphere of the theme. And I think Alice Cooper does it really well. And the music goes together so well.

[12:49] I have to say to the shots are tight. There is no way around it. If you are frustrated by tight shots, this game is not going to be your favorite. Okay. So it is not the easiest game to shoot.

[13:01] What I do wish they would have had a little bit is an easier shot up the middle. And what I mean by that is it's the middle's got a lot of shots and and while there's like the three target area that's easier to hit.

[13:13] The other stuff is not as easy to hit and the right orbit. I mean the right orbit is like way way way to the right. And it's a super super tight shot. And it's makeable. I mean you really have to hit it way off of the tip of your left flipper.

[13:27] But it's I think people really enjoy a smooth orbit shot. And if I was designing a pinball game, I would make sure that the orbits were not super super frustrating or difficult to hit. But again, I think these companies have a hard time because they have a lot of experienced players helping them with the sign.

[13:45] And I think they get nervous like we don't want to make our game too easy. But sometimes you can make it too frustrating if the shots are too tight.

[13:52] But here's the best part about Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. The animations in this game are just killer. Like they're killer. I think they're the best animations on an LCD screen. I've seen and I'm being I'm not just saying this so that no one you know when I walk by the spooky booth takes a swing at me.

[14:11] Those animations are awesome. They are awesome. I have not seen animations from Stern that look that good. I think they're also the right amount of animations so you can pick up what's going on in the game. And when I look at like a Jersey Jack screen while it's prettier with its HD, you know, 1080K or 1080p.

[14:31] It's too much. I'm always confused but Alice Cooper screen. It's just it all just comes together really nicely. So my takeaway from Alice Cooper is nightmare castle is this.

[14:41] If you're in on a game and you're in on one was like $6,500 I think you can up it with a little butter cabinets. I think you're going to be happy with it. I mean, my big gripe has always been the $1,000 lock in the year wait.

[14:54] I think I'm here to tell you after waiting a long time for this game. I do think you're going to be really satisfied with your Alice Cooper nightmare castle. I think it's really really I think they got the theme right and they integrated it right and it shows you that if you get the code right and you really nail it all coming together because the light show is really cool on it. The music sounds great. The speaker system is phenomenal in it.

[15:18] I also like I love the ball save the magnetic ball save in Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is just so much cooler to me than really anything even happening like in monsters or anything happening in a lot of these new games it's the simple thing like that.

[15:32] Like all the lights go red and the ball gets grabbed and then it throws it all the way up the middle. That's what I want to see more of in pinball and I'm really happy that the game has like a feature like that that if even if you aren't good think about it even if you aren't good at pinball.

[15:47] You will play Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and that will most likely happen for you during your game and it'll make you smile and I think pinball needs more of that right where you're not just utterly confused about what to do.

[15:59] All right moving on the other game that really needed to make a big splash at this show was October fest and believe me American pinball is here in full force they have about five or six October fest on the floor coin takers got one.

[16:14] I think there's another one in another booth this game is in a lot of places I have flip flipping out pinball Zach's Zach has won in his booth.

[16:22] So October fest like this is it like this is the moment in which they are going to get a lot of word of mouth and a lot of people on the game and they need to get games on the line.

[16:32] Now I played a lot of October fest I played it with Blake I played it with other people I played it when I first got here I played it this morning again without anyone distracting me.

[16:41] And I have to say this after playing it for a while I think October fest to me it's it's a good game it's a good game it's a unique layout I like that about it it's not your typical fan layout they're trying to do new stuff.

[16:54] There's a lot of different things to shoot for in the game I'm not going to list all of them on the game is unique right and I think that is the biggest thing October fest has going for it if you want a non fan layout game that is trying to give you a different pinball experience.

[17:09] You know you have October fest as an option the thing is this and after playing it for a while I just couldn't help but come away with a little bit of a feeling is the game is good but it's it's not great and then it's $7500 and when I play it you know I'm just again this is the problem with theme I'm just not pulled into the game emotionally it doesn't really grab me and maybe it's just because I just don't really want to play it.

[17:38] I just don't care about October fest as a thing I've never been to an October fest festival I don't find the humor to be that funny because I'm not it's not my thing it's you know it's just not my stick and for some of you out there you might love the festival and you might love the game because of that but I just feel like just being a fun flipping game just isn't enough anymore you have to make the game somewhat special and unique and feel like I need to own this game because remember I would happily play an October fest.

[18:07] I'm going to happily play an October fest on location with my friends and enjoy it and play with one hand and a beer that's the other thing I didn't even realize like where is the one handed play with a beer in your hand mode if you have something like that in a game like October fest and you have a festival like Texas Pimball Festival where everyone is drinking and enjoying and playing games why would you not have it so that one handed mode is being experienced by everyone who steps up to the game.

[18:37] I'm not a musician about how to launch that that's you know what I'm saying that's what these companies need to start doing they need to start saying to themselves if we have a wow thing that really differentiates our game we can't make it really difficult or challenging for people to understand how to start that mode especially we're going to have all these drunk guys with beers in hand at Texas why don't we have like a Texas Pimball Festival mode in which the game is just on that to give people a feel of how cool it is all right.

[19:07] Okay, there's no getting over the artwork on the game it still just feels like a mish mash of stuff that I can't warm up to it's not bad it's colorful there's just a lot there but none of it feels cohesive and it just again it just feels like they just dropped a ton of stuff on the game the cabinet now doesn't even have any character on it it just has the logo so I I don't know I just it just doesn't feel as like exciting and as polished I mean look at the cabinet artwork on Alice Cooper's not just like the

[19:37] nightmare castle and look at the cabinet artwork on October fest look at the play field artwork on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle that beautiful hand drawn artwork look at the artwork on October fest and then think about this for a minute October fest is more expensive than Alice Cooper's nightmare castle Alice Cooper's nightmare castle gives you better animations better artwork has more you know easy easily Mac you know like magical things to experience immediately you know I think what they do is you know I think it's like a great thing to do is really good.

[20:07] I think they need to do with October fest I think they need to have like the ramp down a little bit more the left ramp you probably should start with the down I don't know there's just there's just something about it that makes it hard to immediately get into and then you know I heard guys around me saying when they saw the like the juggling woman on the animation so like it just again looks cheap like Houdini animations and you know I don't know what to say I mean I really don't know what to say if I gave you $7,500 tomorrow and said go buy a pinball machine I just

[20:37] don't know how you stop and say this is the one I'm gonna get and this leads me to my final point about the realities of the pinball market right now I think companies like American pinball you know they're making a game to be better than their previous game so they're making October fest to raise the bar over Houdini the problem is this when you are charging $7,500 for a pinball machine you need to be at the bar or raise the bar again

[21:07] and then you can get $7,500 and that's the challenge because once you look at it like that then this game needs to be better than every Stern pro I can also I'm sorry Stern premium I can also go out and get a dialed in in a hobbit and a wizard of Oz I can get all of those limited edition games in beautiful trim with all the deep code and all the amazing stuff in it I can go get all those games now with low plays

[21:37] for $7,500 and so is October fest better than those games and that's the problem it's not just American pinball problem this is everyone's problem moving forward there are so many games out there there are so many games in beautiful condition out there that if you are bringing your pinball game to market you really have to think like am I giving people enough that they're not going to spend their money else we're not just on new inbox games but on games that are available on the use of the game

[22:07] and so I just think this game is going to struggle to sell and I think they didn't do market research to land on the title and it's not just me and I'm sorry I'm sorry I know you ordered one but this is just like we've got too many other beautiful options now speaking of beautiful options well before I do that here's another big rumor for you guys so I'm hearing this is a rumor I gotta keep saying that I gotta reiterate that don't tattoo my ass on this one I'm not gonna do that

[22:37] this one this is a rumor that American pinball is going to be the company that makes kingpin and kingpin was at the show and kingpin shoots great I love kingpin if they remake it they're gonna have buyers so I hear that American pinball is gonna be the company that produces kingpin but we'll see on that one but you heard it here on canadus pinball podcasts

[22:57] what else is going on speaking of gorgeous I just have to say that you know Marco is at the booth with so many monsters premiums and for you guys in on a monster's premium I'm here to tell you you are buying one of the sexiest pinball machines I've ever seen the black and white monsters is my favorite I love it I love it more than the elite I think it's awesome it is awesome it is hard not to look at that game and smile and be like they nailed it and everyone's memory of the monsters is in black and white so it makes

[23:27] perfect sense it is so cool it is so cool I won't go into the whole like it's still the monsters game I shoots you know shoots well if you're a fan of the monsters you'll enjoy the game I have to be honest

[23:39] Stern just keeps doing Stern's thing a Stern is a Stern is a Stern they I'm never that excited about the next turn because it's always the same thing it just never

[23:48] feels like they're coming at this with a radical innovation I do have a Stern rumor to report and I'm hearing I'm going to close the show on this one well you know what I have one more company to

[23:57] discuss then I'll talk about this Stern rumor that I know that I'll leave you guys off with all right so sun coast pinball they've got a game at the show that is cosmic carnival it looks beautiful dirty donny did the artwork it looks it almost looks like

[24:13] Erasmith gave birth to a sexier son you know it looks it looks a lot like the same color palette of Erasmith game looks awesome game looks awesome from an artistic

[24:24] standpoint the actual game itself is very simple there's two ramps there's a left and a right like sort of like squiggly that go clear ramps that that are in the

[24:32] game look a little J pop Esk there's a there's a scoop in the middle of the game there's pop bumpers there's orbits that's about it there's not much in the game

[24:40] there's not there's not nothing really moves in the game nothing really mechanical and I haven't really even had a chance to play it yet but I have to just say standing over the game I'm just

[24:50] curious like how much is this game going to cost and if this game cost as much as a Stern pro how is it going to be successful we're beyond the point I hope I think we're

[25:00] beyond the point where you just can't throw artwork on something that doesn't do anything interesting from a mechanical standpoint especially the same artist it's just it's just

[25:10] starting to feel like pinball is that a crossroads right now and you either move forward and innovate and you bring something different to the table or you go down the other road into

[25:21] parody and we've seen that before and it's nothing new and we don't need this and we have just another company trying to do it I haven't even like brought up all the other

[25:30] companies Blake what's the name of that company with the self the self game the Scottish game haggis freaking pinball people like who who is

[25:37] haggis pinball and the artwork they have is not even like up to par and I have to go see that game today and I'm just the thing is this these new boutiques I just don't

[25:47] understand why they think they're going to make it if they're not again raising the bar over what Stern is giving you with a pro okay they need to think about

[25:56] this big time and I don't think they are I think there's a little bit of if we build it they will come mentality and I think it's more like if we build it

[26:05] and it's not great we will go out of business and I think that is the reality of pinball all right what else is going on I got the

[26:12] Stern rumor anything else I missed in terms of stuff I've been hearing all right here's the Stern rumor that I am being told is is

[26:20] pretty much confirmed and this this comes from someone you know who who wouldn't make this up and I do I have any

[26:27] credibility left by the way someone said to me you've lost all credibility and I was like well that's cool

[26:32] because that means I once had credibility so thank you for that compliment but here's what here's what I'm going to tell you right now on

[26:38] can you just pinball podcasts on Saturday morning I'm here to finally get it right finally finally finally I know the game that

[26:46] Brian Eddie is working on and I know you're probably like Chris you're the podcast that cried wolf you've been you've been telling us he's

[26:54] working on jaws then Elvira you don't know what he's working on I'm here to tell you I know what he's working on are you ready

[27:02] he is where and this makes sense now I find it's like it's like you put Chris in you know you give him a table full of things to connect the dots and this is it

[27:10] Brian Eddie is working on Jurassic world that is Brian Eddie's next game that is the strong rumor that is what he is working on it is coming out this summer it is going to go

[27:25] Steve Richie black night 3000 then it's going to go Brian Eddie and Jurassic world and then it's going to go most likely Elvira 3 in the fall so that seems to be what

[27:37] Stern has in store all right so Brian Eddie take it to Pinside Jurassic world any other rumors I heard a weird rumor and this is strange I someone someone came up to

[27:48] me and said hey do you realize that like Steve Richie was working on Jurassic world and they had problems with the license and that star wars was originally

[27:56] supposed to be Jurassic world and the hyper loop was a mechanism in which the velociraptors chased you around Jurassic Park I know you know I

[28:06] people tell me shit like that and I'm like yeah cool you know the problem is is nobody if they're never tells me the truth I went up to

[28:13] John Borgon asked him hey Borg I heard that you were designing iron made and originally and that they switched over and made it into

[28:21] guardians and that you know Eddie turned into Groot and he was like no I had the option to do iron made and I decided not to and then did

[28:29] took guardians you think it's going to tell me Chris you're right Chris you're right they just re-skinned my game and I had to just do that

[28:37] because that's what they wanted me to do you know they're never going to be honest about that now will the will there be a

[28:42] stern vault edition I don't know I don't know I just don't even I don't probably they do it but there's no news of that so that's

[28:49] what it's been like after day one of tpf I think I gave you guys some good feedback on the games there's a big

[28:54] Lebowski here it broke down nothing new hoping to play it today kind of crazy that it's out on the floor there are just so

[29:03] many amazing games I really do want to take more time today to play more pinball it's hard because it is more fun

[29:09] just talking to the people than it is playing the pinball machines I said to someone I'm going to set up a pinball

[29:14] festival where there actually aren't any games it's just pinball people come together and and just chat and and have

[29:22] steak and have beer and have whiskey sounds a lot more fun than trying to figure out what the hell is going on

[29:29] and pie are to the Caribbean alright everyone have a great day tonight is the twippy so make sure you tune in to see if we

[29:37] win favorite pinball podcast but also to see who wins the other categories it's going to be fun here's what I'm

[29:43] curious to see is how this show actually happens it's live streamed from Texas pinball festival I I know these guys have

[29:52] been working really hard to figure out the logistics of a live stream show it is not easy the other part I'm looking forward to is

[30:00] people are doing speeches and the number one fear people have is the fear of public speaking so I can't wait just I can't

[30:07] see like all the people talk and accept their awards and see who wins what it's going to be it's going to be fun so make sure

[30:14] you tune in the twippies tonight are at eight o'clock Texas time which is nine o'clock eastern standard time they're going to be live streamed

[30:23] so look out for that and yeah root for your favorite pinball podcaster and if he doesn't win then maybe you can root for me
