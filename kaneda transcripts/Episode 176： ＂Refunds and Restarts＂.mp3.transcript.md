[00:00] What is pinball still doing alive in 2017?

[00:11] It's an archaic entertainment form, a steel ball bouncing around a wooden play field with

[00:17] plastic.

[00:19] The world is playing video games, virtual reality, putting headsets on, staring at cell phones,

[00:26] but because of all of you.

[00:29] There is still pinball, alive and well in 2017.

[00:36] I mean that's kind of awesome isn't it?

[00:42] Just think about all the amazing new games coming out next year.

[00:46] Pirates, Deadpool, a new capow game from Stern, Monster Bash, Remade.

[00:58] Pinball is alive and well in 2017.

[01:04] Are you guys ready for episode 176?

[01:07] Just for one day, let's roll it right now.

[01:15] Alright, welcome to episode 176 of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:20] We're just trying a little bit something different there with the intro.

[01:23] You know it's my show, I can kind of mix it up every once in a while.

[01:27] Here's what we're going to do, it's Sunday afternoon.

[01:29] I'm going to go down a list of all the different news items that are happening in the pinball

[01:33] hobby and we're going to just go down by manufacturer and I'm going to talk about what's occurring

[01:38] with each of them, some of the updates and we're going to go down a list.

[01:42] And this is sort of like your weekly recap by Canada.

[01:46] And I think you're going to enjoy it, I think you're going to like my point of view.

[01:50] And I'm trying to be a lot more positive and look at this hobby a lot differently.

[01:56] Some things are going on in my personal life and even with my own relationship to pinball

[02:00] that are exciting and I think it's going to change the way I look at this hobby.

[02:04] I think it's going to change the way I approach this podcast and I think it's going to all be for the better.

[02:10] And I think this podcast has a tendency to go up and down, up and down, you know my mood swings back and forth.

[02:16] But I think I'm starting to realize the key to happiness in this hobby and it's not really hard.

[02:23] Once you let go of wanting to own stuff, of wanting to just possess these rare items and all this like limited edition stuff.

[02:33] You can start to be happier.

[02:36] It doesn't mean I won't own Ellie machines because I do like nicer versions of things.

[02:41] But it's about not caring anymore as much about having or chasing after those rare things.

[02:48] Okay, so that's what I'm starting to do and I think it's working well for me.

[02:53] I think you guys enjoy the last podcast tremendously and let's start there.

[02:57] Let's start with Stern pinball because we are going to see this week for the first time ever.

[03:03] We are going to see gameplay footage of Guardians of the Galaxy pinball and it is going to happen at IAPA.

[03:10] That is in Florida and I believe the date that's going to occur is November 14th.

[03:16] Now I have people on the ground that will be at that show who will report back to me what the game is like.

[03:23] And I think what's interesting for all of us who are excited about Guardians of the Galaxy,

[03:29] we're going to finally see gameplay.

[03:31] We're finally going to see what is up on that LCD screen.

[03:35] How is it integrated with the movie?

[03:36] Are there going to be movie clips?

[03:38] Is it going to be more animation like Aerosmith?

[03:41] Just what is that interface going to be?

[03:43] Nobody knows so that's going to be answered once and for all.

[03:46] We are going to see if there are some of the songs, the pop music that Stern is putting into the game will that be present at the show.

[03:55] And then we will see how the game just flips.

[03:57] I think a lot of people have been saying well it's Iron Man meets Metallica.

[04:01] We already know how it's going to shoot.

[04:03] As other people have said yes there are similarities but it will be a whole new experience.

[04:09] You can't look at a pinball machine statically and understand what the experience of flipping it will be.

[04:15] So that is exciting.

[04:16] A little strange that this is happening before the Jack Danger dead flip stream on the 20th.

[04:23] Will that be a redundancy?

[04:25] Will there be a pro machine or a premium machine at IAPA or world Jack Danger get one or the other?

[04:33] We don't know that's still to be determined.

[04:35] As I said to we are at a stage now with Guardians and I think you guys heard this loud and clear on my last podcast.

[04:42] We sort of just have to wait and see what's going to be in the game.

[04:45] I don't know what the music songs are going to be.

[04:47] I don't know what the gameplay is going to be like.

[04:49] I do wish and I think most of you do wish that there would be more songs in this machine than just two.

[04:56] And there is a reason why.

[04:59] And I saw the debate going back and forth on pinside.

[05:02] I saw people don't understand Guardians when they say stuff like this.

[05:07] I think Orrick said something like is this a music pin?

[05:10] No, this isn't a game like Aero Smith or Metallica or ACDC where you want to select your song and then go play the game.

[05:18] I think he probably hasn't seen Guardians of the Galaxy.

[05:22] The movie is because if there is any movie where the soundtrack means so much and is pivotal to recreating what goes on in the film,

[05:30] it's Guardians of the Galaxy.

[05:32] I would say that it is almost like a film that is based on music.

[05:37] The volume mix that his mom makes for him is such a pivotal part of the narrative of the film.

[05:46] And it's also just a part of the movie.

[05:48] You can't separate those songs from an experience of Guardians.

[05:53] And nobody wants to hear original pinball music over the original soundtrack from the film.

[06:01] People want the soundtrack from the movie.

[06:03] They don't want original pinball music.

[06:05] I think 99.9% of people would prefer what's in the film and not original pinball music.

[06:13] But we're going to have to wait and see.

[06:15] I don't think these songs are super expensive.

[06:18] I do think that Stern will not invest the money to get us many, many tracks.

[06:22] And you know, it's unfortunate.

[06:25] I don't think most of those songs are super expensive.

[06:27] But again, I think Stern is looking for ways to save money all the time.

[06:32] I do.

[06:34] I don't think they're like, let's just give them everything they want.

[06:37] They're not like that.

[06:38] They also need to stay in business.

[06:39] That's the other side of the argument is if they gave us everything we wanted and they went bankrupt, is that really what we want?

[06:48] In terms of the armor, I don't know if you guys have seen this on Pinside, but someone has been making a really nice purple clear coated armor that would look stellar on a Guardians of the Galaxy pinball machine.

[07:00] But the purple is really not the coolest.

[07:02] There is this other color out there that's called Neo Chrome.

[07:05] And you have to see this.

[07:06] If you haven't seen it, just Google Neo Chrome color.

[07:09] And what Neo Chrome does, it almost creates like this rainbow like hue effect with the metal.

[07:16] It's like a shiny metal chrome that sort of blends between purple and green and blue and would just perfectly suit two games.

[07:26] There's two games that Neo Chrome would be the best trim ever on.

[07:30] Guardians of the Galaxy and total nuclear annihilation.

[07:34] So for those of you out there who mod and do powder coating, you should look at Neo Chrome because I think if you made a Neo Chrome armor package, you would sell to every single one who owns those two games.

[07:45] So a lot of exciting stuff. We just got a few days to wait with three days to wait and we're going to start to get some Guardians gameplay.

[07:52] The LEDs have not sold out.

[07:54] And I think this is testament to the fact that Stern has probably guessed wrong on the amount of LEDs that they should have made available for this game.

[08:03] 600 was too many.

[08:04] I think Stern should make 250 maximum of all LEDs at all time.

[08:10] I think 600 is dumb. They're going to sit. They're not going to sell all of them.

[08:16] It's just, it's, it's unfortunate because I think the LEDs as I said before should feel limited.

[08:22] And I think we need to get back to a place where 250 or less needs to be the only amount of LEDs that's ever made for any game ever.

[08:29] Okay. These guys need to get with the proper marketing approach.

[08:33] Alright. So Batman. Let's move on to Batman. So Batman is at code 0.81.

[08:40] And it's, it's really hard. I think it's really hard for people to explain to you via a forum what it's like to update the code and what the new experience is like with the new code.

[08:53] So I've heard from many Batman 66 owners that this is a good move forward for the game.

[09:00] I know that's not saying much because the game was in such beta mode.

[09:04] But I think people are starting to realize where alignment is going with the code.

[09:08] And it's really hard.

[09:11] So here's the thing about Batman 66 is when I read people's comments on it.

[09:16] There are expectations of where they want the game to be.

[09:20] And their predictions for where it will be are so high that it's almost like you can never get an honest answer from someone who owns a Batman 66.

[09:30] And the two people I'm really looking at who really pushed the hype.

[09:33] It's, you know, my friend Iceman's always pushing the hype.

[09:36] This is going to be Lyman's greatest game ever. It's going to be better than the walking dead.

[09:41] I don't think there's anything to indicate that Batman will be better than the walking dead.

[09:46] I don't think the shots are there.

[09:48] I don't think the layout is as interesting as the walking dead.

[09:51] And then you have Fralex.

[09:53] So Fralex wrote something that was really funny.

[09:56] It made me laugh because Fralex, you know, he's a man who buys like every LE.

[09:59] He said, Lyman is, what did he say?

[10:04] I mean, I want to get the exact words because it was amazing.

[10:08] Okay, he said this. He said, Lyman is putting on a clinic on how to code a game.

[10:18] Okay. Okay. Let me, let me stop right there.

[10:21] So Lyman is not putting on a clinic on how to code a game with Batman 66.

[10:25] When you put on a clinic, right, we use that term a lot in sports.

[10:29] Like Michael Jordan put on a clinic tonight and like show them how to like take over a game and like dominate.

[10:35] When you put on the clinic, it's usually something that happens pretty quickly in the span of a few hours

[10:40] where you just show the whole world that you're better than everybody else.

[10:43] Putting on a clinic, taking over 300 days to get to code to point eight one, that's not a clinic.

[10:50] This is a laborious, arduous, slowest molasses moving process to get this game to be enjoyable.

[10:59] Let alone a clinic.

[11:01] This is, this game is not anywhere close to being considered one of the greatest games of all time, right?

[11:07] I hope it gets better. I do.

[11:10] But I've yet to jump on a Batman and have this like, wow.

[11:14] And when people say they think this is going to be Stern's best game ever

[11:19] and the best theme integration of any Stern ever, I can't help but say, you know what, there's no way.

[11:25] Here's why Batman 66, in my opinion, will never be Stern's greatest theme integration of all time.

[11:31] Because how can you have a crane in a Batman 66 game?

[11:35] There is nothing about that crane that is integrating the theme of that show.

[11:38] Okay, it's completely a rehash.

[11:40] Okay, how can you have a Batman 66 game where there's no lower play field? That's the bad cave.

[11:46] The bad cave should be a lower play field.

[11:51] Or how can you have a Batman 66 theme integration where one of the things you do is not bash that, you know, that entrance to the bad cave.

[12:01] You know, like, you see that thing and then it drops down and then they go into the bad cave.

[12:05] Like, how can you not integrate that into the game?

[12:07] How can you have a Batman 66 machine that doesn't have theme integration where Batman and Robin are climbing, physically climbing up the side of the building?

[12:15] Right, so I just, I really think people need to stop thinking this is the greatest theme integration pin of all time.

[12:23] I think the game is very colorful. I think Christopher Franchi did a great job getting it to where it is at.

[12:29] But I also don't think that turntable or that rotisserie.

[12:33] I don't really think that is the most creative. Like, wow, like this really brings the Batman 66 world to life.

[12:40] So many other things I would have done if I were given the creative brief to put that universe under that glass.

[12:48] But look, it is what it is.

[12:51] A lot of people think the code can make this make up for a lot of that and can make the game one of the greatest games ever.

[12:58] It still is the most expensive, expensive stern pin on machine of all time.

[13:02] So I understand why people's expectations are really high.

[13:05] I hope the game becomes what you expect it to be.

[13:09] The walking dead is a very high bar.

[13:12] And will this game ever make you feel the way that game does?

[13:16] Only time will tell. The question is, how much time will it happen?

[13:22] I hope the game isn't complete the day after you die.

[13:25] All right.

[13:26] What else is going on in this stern world?

[13:28] So that's pretty much like the big thing.

[13:30] There's another, there will be, this is another rumor I'm hearing that stern will reveal the next Kapow title.

[13:38] At Expo 2018.

[13:42] So Kapow at Expo 2018.

[13:45] That's a long time away.

[13:47] That is like almost a year from now.

[13:49] But hey, we're breaking the exclusive here today on this podcast.

[13:53] What else is so Elvira will be another game?

[13:56] What's Stern's next title?

[13:58] That's another interesting question.

[14:00] Is Stern's next title going to be Deadpool?

[14:03] Which seems to make sense that Deadpool would come out around Valentine's Day in February because isn't the new Deadpool movie coming out shortly?

[14:11] And then there's always Iron Maiden.

[14:14] Now did Iron Maiden though?

[14:16] Did Iron Maiden hit a roadblock because John Trudeau was making that game with a zombie yuddy?

[14:21] And now that they have to redesign it, is that game going to be delayed until much later into the year?

[14:26] It seems like that would be the case.

[14:28] But also knowing Stern.

[14:30] I kind of think they would Frankenstein Trudeau's design and not fully redesign the game.

[14:35] I think they would yank out the elements that were quintessential Trudeau elements.

[14:39] And I think they would adjust it.

[14:41] But I don't think it's going to have a full redesign.

[14:43] I can't see them doing that.

[14:45] All right.

[14:46] So that's Stern Pimble.

[14:48] Garden's the galaxy.

[14:49] Look out for it this week.

[14:51] All right.

[14:52] Who's next on our list of what's going on?

[14:54] So Jersey Jack Pimble.

[14:55] Have a news update for Jersey Jack Pimble.

[14:58] Got an email from Joe Newhart at Pimble Star.

[15:02] And it basically went something like this.

[15:05] Want to congratulate you on your pre-order of Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition.

[15:11] This is the $12,500 Devi Jones edition of the game.

[15:15] He wanted to say that the hype and the demand for the game was tremendous.

[15:21] That all 200 machines have been sold out.

[15:24] They've been spoken for.

[15:26] And that there was pressure on Jersey Jack to make more Collector's Edition machines.

[15:32] But Jersey Jack will not.

[15:35] They said 200 is 200 is 200.

[15:38] We're not making any more.

[15:40] Now, do I think all 200 machines are sold out?

[15:43] No.

[15:44] I think they're all sold through to distributors.

[15:46] And there's a big difference there.

[15:48] Between distributors saying it's sold out.

[15:52] And actual 200 people have given $1,000 to distributors.

[15:58] Because what will happen is distributors will go and ask Jack,

[16:01] Hey, I want four, I want five, I want ten, whatever the number is.

[16:05] And then Jack runs out.

[16:07] Now, I don't think 200 people have given $1,000 yet.

[16:11] So the other part though, and this is the one that I'm happy they're doing this.

[16:17] Because I think this is what you need to do when you want to justify the price for $12,500.

[16:23] You have to create elements of the game that are amazing, that other people wish they had on cheaper versions of the game,

[16:31] that just make the overall package nicer.

[16:33] So that topper that we saw at Expo with the ship inside the bottle that rocks back and forth,

[16:39] probably one of the coolest pinball toppers I've seen in a long time.

[16:42] That topper will be a collector's edition exclusive,

[16:47] which means you cannot buy that topper from Jersey Jack for your Ellie machine.

[16:53] And so that is news.

[16:57] That is chew on that people who are who want to get that topper who are not in on a collector's edition.

[17:03] And look, and I think it's the right move.

[17:05] I think Jack knows he could sell probably a few more hundred of those.

[17:10] But he also is trying to build a community of people who will go in on the expensive versions of his games.

[17:17] And if they sold those things to other people, it would sort of chip away at what makes those things special.

[17:24] It reminds me of what's going on right now.

[17:26] And I know for you car guys, I'm just going to say this quickly, on Friday, Dodge the Now and set the demons are shipping.

[17:32] I'm super excited. I'm getting my car soon.

[17:34] But what Dodge is doing is they set up something called the Dodge Demon Concierge service.

[17:40] And basically they have items and they have upgrades and they have certain elements that only people who buy a Dodge Demon can order from Dodge.

[17:49] You need your Venn number, you need to verify your, they will only ship it to the person who bought the car.

[17:56] It is really like making the people who buy demons feel like they have exclusive access to certain things.

[18:01] And I think that's what's going on here and a little bit in Pimbal.

[18:04] Is if you're going to go in at 12,500, there's going to be things that only you get and no one else can have.

[18:09] And I think that's the way it needs to happen.

[18:12] If you want to sell these super high end things, now you could argue if this whole dressing game is up with trim is worth it.

[18:19] Again, it's not about the build of materials on getting to 12,500.

[18:24] It's more about I have something that is very limited in nature and certain people like that and want that.

[18:30] And I'm not going to crucify those people.

[18:33] Another interesting thread about Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[18:36] Before I do that, I want to just ask one question out there for you guys.

[18:39] Have you guys noticed how the hype has died down so much on Pirates of the Caribbean?

[18:46] And it happens, right? It's the reason why I don't know why anyone shows the games early.

[18:51] Because you saw the game, you got excited for like a few weeks and now nobody really cares.

[18:57] Like you've moved on. You'll move on. We're like fish.

[19:01] You're going to swim towards the next thing that's producing food.

[19:04] So now everyone's excited probably about seeing Guardians gameplay, right?

[19:08] But even the Guardians thread, right? It just dies down.

[19:11] Like it's like this hype monster for like a few days and then it's just like zilch.

[19:15] And that is why you really want to capture people when they can buy something

[19:22] in the moment they're the most excited to give you their money.

[19:25] And you know right now Pirates is not going to ship for maybe five months

[19:30] and they've already sort of spoiled a little bit everything there is about the game.

[19:35] I mean what else are they going to show you? Like the play field's been shown?

[19:39] The toys have been shown? Everything has been shown in just one pull off the curtain moment.

[19:46] And that is why I don't think it was marketed properly.

[19:51] And I don't know why pinball marketers can't figure this part out.

[19:56] Why would you show your entire game at once?

[20:00] Here's what I would do. All these people. They need to get it together.

[20:05] Think about it like this. You could deconstruct all of the amazing things Eric put into that game.

[20:11] And you could simply release one element a month over five months to cover

[20:18] all the five different mechanisms and toys that pay homage to the five films.

[20:24] So imagine one month you tease people and show them the concentric rings.

[20:29] Another month you show them the upper play field.

[20:33] Another month you show them the treasure chest.

[20:37] Another month you show them the whirlpool.

[20:39] It just gives you an opportunity to create sustainable buzz.

[20:45] But when you just yank the sheet off of the whole thing, you've then just said,

[20:52] here it is. You can't have it for six months. Now your hype is gone.

[20:57] Your hype is gone. I don't know why for the life of me.

[21:01] Pinball marketing is so piss poor. I really don't.

[21:04] It's like the easiest thing to market because you have a built-in fan base.

[21:08] Stern does it the best in terms of timing because they say, here it is.

[21:13] You can order today. You'll have it within two months.

[21:16] That's smart. It's smart because your money goes directly to the distributor.

[21:20] Once guardians is revealed, I'm getting hit up by like JJ being like, you want to,

[21:25] Ellie? Money has to come in. You're going to get it like in a couple months.

[21:30] There's not this long period of time. You know, Houdini showed Houdini so far in advance.

[21:36] You know, all these games that have been, you know, like we've seen Alien for years.

[21:39] We've seen Lebowski for years and the games are not available to go buy tomorrow.

[21:44] So it's just, it's something I wish would improve.

[21:48] And you know what's funny is no one's ever hit me up.

[21:51] Nobody, you, I have this podcast. I work in marketing. I launch major products all the time.

[21:57] My bill rate would scare you. Not once have I received an email from anybody in the pinball world that says,

[22:04] Hey, Chris, can you help me launch this game? Can you give me marketing advice and how to launch this?

[22:11] I'll tell you what I would do. I would do it for free. Pro Bono.

[22:14] And I tell you right now I charge my clients get billed hundreds an hour for my counsel.

[22:21] And I guarantee you this. If I marketed a pinball machine launch, it would be the best freaking launch ever.

[22:29] It wouldn't be just like, oh, let's just go to expel and be on the floor.

[22:32] Oh, let's just put up a shitty PowerPoint presentation and have a seminar and pour the hell out of everybody and serve pizza.

[22:38] So boring, such a lack of creativity.

[22:42] You know, look, I'm happy that like, you know, Stern does the dead flip with Jack Danger,

[22:47] but it's also like, it's the same rodeo every single game with Stern too.

[22:51] It's like, can they not think of an original thing to do to launch a pinball machine?

[22:57] Why is it always the same like, here's the game, here's the press release, here's the low res images,

[23:03] here's like the feature matrix. And in two weeks from now, Jack Danger is going to play it.

[23:09] And then it's out. Like, it's like, that's all they can think of.

[23:14] Like with these amazing themes, they can't do something more fun, more creative, more innovative than that.

[23:20] It doesn't even cost money to be creative. You just have to want to be creative.

[23:25] Alright, let's go down the list. There was a question about which Jersey Jack pinball machine should I get.

[23:32] So there was a gentleman who basically said, I've narrowed it down.

[23:36] I want to get a Jersey Jack pinball machine, but I don't know which one to get. His name was Swim Law.

[23:41] And if it's, what is it? November 12th today.

[23:46] If in the middle of November 2017, you realize I want to buy a Jersey Jack game.

[23:52] Which one should I buy? And you know, you want, there's a lot of different factors, right?

[23:57] Like, how much does the theme matter? How much does gameplay matter? Do you have kids in your family?

[24:03] Is this a game where you want long ball times? Is it a game where you want, you know, better flow?

[24:08] You could ask all those questions, you know, and I think when you buy a Stern pinball machine,

[24:12] there's such a variety of games to choose from that you can narrow it down.

[24:18] But Jersey Jack's really only got three machines right now that are available,

[24:23] pirates being the fourth. Now, if I were to give this guy advice, I would just wait.

[24:29] But that's not what won the poll on Pinside. 52% of people said you should go get a dial then.

[24:36] Now, look, I agree. The dial then is by far, like by far,

[24:41] the best pinball machine Jersey Jack has made to date easily.

[24:46] It's Pat Lawler, it's Jam Packed, it's Standard Body, it is the machine I would own if I was going to buy a Jersey Jack machine today.

[24:54] My second choice, my second choice would be the Wizard of Oz.

[24:59] Just because I still, I just can't get over the hobbit. I just can't.

[25:04] Like, I get it, it's probably got better code. It's probably got even like a better flow than the Wizard of Oz.

[25:10] Wizard of Oz is very stop and go game. But I just think Waz is more Jam Packed and definitely brings the Wizard of Oz world to life better than the hobbit brings the hobbit world to life.

[25:20] But I think dialed in is like above and beyond both of those games, like significantly better than the hobbit and Wizard of Oz.

[25:27] I wouldn't even consider those two. I would just get a dial then.

[25:30] But again, dialed in if you don't like that theme and if you want something your kids are going to recognize and gravitate towards.

[25:37] Not that I think any kids even know what the Wizard of Oz is or if they even enjoy the hobbit because the films are so bad.

[25:44] But dialed in is by far the best. But the reason I would wait is how can you not wait now having seen Pirates of the Caribbean, how freaking cool that game is.

[25:53] And I think again, it's the reason why I never would have shown it so early because it would make me wait.

[25:58] Why would you go buy a dial then now because if you think about it, if you wait until Pirates comes out and you see the full package of Pirates, if on that day when Pirates ships or is available all over the place, you could on that day either just go buy a Pirates new in box or buy a dial then Ellie new in box or standard new in box.

[26:20] And by that time the dial then code will probably be beyond complete, nicely polished and Pirate will be pretty far along and you'll know which one you want.

[26:30] Because on that day you won't even have any clue what JJP number five is toy story. But you know, we're not going to see that game toy story until expo 2018 maybe TPS.

[26:43] So you're going to have a window there where you're going to have like the only new game for a while you're not going to have your mind on a new JJP game.

[26:52] All right, let's go down the list. I'm starting to drag here. I want to make sure you guys have a fun podcast. American pinball. There is no update who Dini should be shipping by the end of this month early December.

[27:04] I think all of you enjoyed the interview with Josh Cougler. If you didn't go listen to it, it was great. I think Josh did a well, a well, a well, swell job articulating how much is in that game.

[27:16] I think who Dini is jam packed. You know, if I could change only one thing on the game, I probably wouldn't have gone steampunk. Because what does steampunk have to do with who Dini?

[27:26] But I still think it looks okay. I think it looks good. I think the game right now has added a bunch of cool stuff. And look, it's for your money. I don't know how you get a game with more stuff in it than who Dini. I really don't.

[27:41] People might gripe about the what's on the LCDs.

[27:44] The game is below the glass. I always talk about LCD integration. It means nothing. You will never look up and enjoy whatever on that screen on any jersey jack on any stern when you're immersed in the game. You're looking down.

[28:02] All right. What else is going on? So let's talk about highway pinball. Now highway pinball is in this weird place right now. And by that, I mean they're getting games out. The games are having some issues that is to be expected.

[28:19] They're not getting games out that quickly. They still have yet to tell Ellie buyers what they're getting. I don't even know if they have that figured out. I think Andrew put these guys in a really precarious situation because he didn't even have it figured out.

[28:33] He got stuck in like he basically made the Ellie. He announced it just to get quick money in the door and get the positives. But now with the LCD screen on the back box, it makes the Ellie pretty irrelevant. Right.

[28:47] So here's the thing though. The big issue, the dark cloud hanging over highway pinball continues to be this for people to go buy this machine. And I'm not doubting that people don't like the machine. I'm not doubting that people don't want the machine.

[29:04] But for people to want to go buy it, they need to have confidence in highway pinball. They need to feel good that if they give them money, that they're egging to get a machine and that the company is going to be around to support them.

[29:21] There's only one thing right now keeping people from investing in highway pinball. And that is the fact that highway pinball will not refund people's money who want refunds.

[29:36] Because not refunding people's money basically just says one thing we don't have money. And some pin cider who's been championing and cheerleading highway pinball from the very beginning has been MK6 pin. Right. This guy's avatar is the alien head. He's been super excited to get his alien for years.

[29:59] He was the one he used to tell me to shut up when I was sharing information about highway pinball, you know, all these guys told me I was wrong. I forgive them because they believed Andrew in his lies and it's okay. We've moved on.

[30:12] And I understand what his goal here is. He started a thread that is basically trying to tally how much refund money does highway pinball O people.

[30:22] And he's asking people to write in the comments section and PM him when they ask for their refund and how much refund money they're owed.

[30:31] And right now as of today, the total amount of money that is owed to people by these new investors is $24,900.

[30:42] I want to just like double check that but I think that is the latest of where we are we are at. Okay. Now why can't these investors pay that money back. What is it?

[30:54] And when you read people's stories, they all sort of have a similar story. It's that they email someone over there. I think it's the person's name is Morgan. They get an email back and then the emails stop.

[31:06] They call the telephone and the phone they don't know and picks up or they call a phone number and it doesn't even work because you know they didn't pay their phone bill.

[31:16] And so there's just a lack of communication and all that's doing it's just perpetuating anxiety around buying this game.

[31:25] And I told people yes, I told people to ask for their money back. Why wouldn't anybody get their money back if they could and just wait to see if they could pay their money back.

[31:35] And I said I want to see if these guys could turn things around because I still believe and this is not me rooting against them or rooting against pinball.

[31:43] But a company should use its own money and investor money to build the product that they sell to consumers.

[31:51] Consumers should not be the investors in the company to get the product made. A pinball company should not operate like a Kickstarter. It's just not the way it should go.

[32:01] And that's exactly how Andrew highway was doing it. And so these individuals they need to go refund the $25,000 that is owed to people.

[32:12] If they just did that tomorrow, they would be fine. Here's the part I don't get. All of these people they were celebrated as being super successful businessmen, $25,000 to give your company a clean slate would be the best PR move for highway pinball.

[32:30] If these gentlemen can't afford $25,000 refunds, they need to just go close up highway pinball. That is peanuts. There are people in this hobby who could easily cut a check for that tomorrow for just a gamer tube.

[32:46] And if they're trying to run a company and they're letting this hang over them in such a horrible PR way, I don't get it. Do they not have $25,000?

[32:56] And we all know this. It should not take 60 days to get a refund. They took your money immediately. They took the money out of your checking account, your banking account, your PayPal account immediately.

[33:11] You can also refund people's money immediately. So the fact that they're saying 60 days. Remember that was an Andrew highway thing.

[33:19] First it was 30 days and it was 60 days. The fact that they're doing this shows one thing they just don't have any money or they don't want to invest anymore in what's going on. So I hope they clear their name.

[33:32] I hope this week we hear that all refunds went out. I would happily have these gentlemen come on the show and say look, everyone's paid off. We hope that money comes back.

[33:42] And that's the ironic thing is if they gave people a refund and they turn the company around that money would flow right back to them in the form of newly ordered games at a higher price.

[33:53] Isn't that their whole business model that if you get a refund and you go back in and you have to come back in at the higher price and people are like fine, I just don't want to be anxious that I might lose my money.

[34:03] Alright, let's move on. I mean, they know what they need to do. Let's see if they do it.

[34:09] The last point I'll make is Barry Oslar. I don't know how to say his name. Barry is making game number three. I had Barry up there with like Steve Richie. He just needs to retire. He just needs to hang it up.

[34:22] We all know game number three is supposed to be like Playboy or Queen. I think both those themes would be terrible themes for Pimball and they wouldn't turn the corner for highway.

[34:32] I think they're very like I mean Playboy really in 2017. We're really thinking Playboy is the way to go. It should be Wonder Woman not Playboy.

[34:40] I also think that Queen is not going to sell that well. I don't even know what would the objective be. I don't know. I just don't think Queen is a great idea for a Pimball machine.

[34:57] Alright, let's talk about Dutch Pimball. So Dutch brought their prototype game to I think it's called the Dutch Pimball Open or the Dutch Pimball Expo. If you guys didn't see the game was there all weekend, this show is really cool.

[35:10] The facility that it's in is amazing. It's like this circular building and there's Pimball machines that go up multiple stories in this sort of circular pattern. Very, very cool. One of the cool looking shows I've seen in terms of Pimball shows.

[35:23] The game is there. This is one of their prototypes that was sort of built in China. It's a little bit of a Frankenstein machine. I think the back box was one of their older back boxes put on to the game. Here's the good news.

[35:35] They're making a game. The game is being made and the parts and the new sort of system and the boards and everything. It's there. Like when they showed the game, here is the big Lebowski made with Chinese parts.

[35:48] So they've shown us that they can make the game in China. They can do it. And I think that's sort of like a quantum of solace, right? For people who are waiting for their big Lebowski's. Yes, they are able to find a new contract manufacturer who can do it.

[36:04] So the news though is that they are now saying that there will be no games shipping by the end of the year. So they said that originally they were hoping to have that be a reality. No games by the end of the year.

[36:17] But they're hoping for production to start by the end of the year. I just ran. It's another. It's another one of these like we're ramping up for production. We're ramping up for production.

[36:29] And that's. It's unfortunate because I think this whole ramping up for production is just it's just it's just worn out everybody in pinball. All of you out there who have listened to this podcast, who have friends that are invested in these companies who are constantly ramping up for production.

[36:46] You're just tired of it all. I know I am. I don't even like want to talk so much about it. I think I think we're we've moved past that as a hobby. I think people are done.

[36:56] I still think the big Lebowski is one of the greatest pinball machines we've seen in a really long time. I do. I mean some people think it's not that special. That's my own personal opinion. I would happily own a big Lebowski if they would make it. And so bury any up. I've made fun of you guys on this show multiple times. I've called you burdenerney. I've said your business plan wouldn't work. I'm still going to say this.

[37:19] I still think you guys designed and develop and created one of the best pinball machines ever. I think when you talk about theme integration and you look at the big Lebowski and you put a big Lebowski next the Batman 66.

[37:34] It is a joke which one is better which one has better theme integration which one has more innovation which one has more creativity. People paid $15,000 for Batman super LEDs. I much rather would have bought a big Lebowski if I had 15 grand.

[37:53] And guess what if you weigh $15,000 around someone will sell you their big Lebowski and I much rather have it. It's just a cooler game. But there's so many question marks. There's so many like what's going to happen. The biggest problem still moving forward.

[38:13] They have not explained how many new orders they need to get the original buyers their machine. So if I was an old early achiever I'd still be really nervous that I may never get my game. I'd even be nervous that some newer buyers will get their games far ahead of me which still doesn't guarantee me one.

[38:38] I also would be super frustrated if I was an early achiever and knew money got their game before me. I mean how would that make you feel? I've been waiting for three years with these guys and all these Johnny come lately can come in now swoop in and buy the game in front of me.

[38:58] But I'm supposed to feel good about that because they're telling me they need that to happen to happen for me to get my game. It's really really weird situation. I don't think it makes people feel good. I don't think it makes people feel confident.

[39:15] But I hope I do hope these guys work it out. I do because I think Lebowski's a special machine. But I'm nervous. I'm really nervous. I don't know. I really don't know. See here's why I'm nervous. And this is like I said this as I look at a my magic girl machine because at the end of the day these like lower volume games these games that come from these companies that were really not sure how long they're going to be around were really not sure if they're going to support these games for very long.

[39:45] The problem is this for the existing Lebowski owners those people now are really nervous that the games they have will not get support moving forward that if the game changes how much of the new changes will be compatible with the game they own which one will be built better which one will people want.

[40:05] And I was reading Pinside and I read this post and I want to read it to you because I think this is indicative of why speculating on these new companies and speculating on these new machines while it seems like you're supporting Pimple and it seems like a fun thing to do it can oftentimes leave people extremely frustrated and can end in disaster.

[40:29] So let me read this post from Pinsider just like me. He wrote last week I dropped my Lebowski off with a pinball technician due to my ongoing issues with the bowling alley with some help from Barry he was able to get everything working and I collected it and brought it home yesterday.

[40:48] I got it home and for one game everything was working perfectly unfortunately during the second game all the solenoids died simultaneously during gameplay and none worked during test I raised the playfield and the red fuse LEDs for F1 F2 F3 and F8 weren't lit.

[41:10] Despite none of the fuses appearing to be gone I tried removing and resetting all the connectors thinking that something could have come loose and transport but this only made things worse.

[41:22] Now when I start the machine I get the P3 rock not found please check connection and power message on the LCD.

[41:30] When I power on the machine the blue LEDs on the P-Rock light up so I assume that the power is okay and all other connections seem solid.

[41:40] Has anyone had similar issue it's frustrating everything was finally working correctly for a brief moment and now the machine won't even boot.

[41:49] When I read that I just felt this guy's pain you know when you have this thing that is supposed to bring you joy and now it's sitting in this guy's home and it's broken and it won't boot he now has to go do what right.

[42:05] It's not cheap to bring games to people to fix things like even moving a pinball machine around is not fun you want these things to work and you want them to work as much as possible.

[42:17] And if things don't work you want the fixes to be simple and you know I think this is just unfortunate but it's the reality of where we are today.

[42:28] I think all of us have become wiser to the fact that maybe we should just go with what's trusted and ultimately once you start to realize that you want to go with what works and what you know has parts available and what you know like can take thousands of plays and still keep going.

[42:46] Ultimately then the best games to buy are like the valley Williams games from the 90s that were built by the best company ever that were built to last or at least take it you know take a pounding in our Cades when machines were selling 10,000 15,000 20,000 admins family pinball machines you know these things were built like tanks to put up with that kind of repetitive abuse.

[43:12] They might not have been built to collect or to last forever but now there's so many parts available for all these games that if you own a machine in I own a tells of the Ruby and nights and it's being worked on by Eddie Kramer who's doing the most amazing job my game I'm surprised it didn't blow my freaking apartment sky high it was like a hack job.

[43:32] But everything he needs to make that game new again is available and he's doing it and he's incredible if you don't know Eddie Kramer if you want your machine and I this guy's work it is unbelievable you know Eddie is like a really he's probably the nicest guy I've ever met he's so nice he's so sweet and he doesn't brag he doesn't boast he's got the most humble docile personality ever but when he starts making a machine new again it is like no other work I've seen.

[44:02] And he's not like out there being like oh I'm you know I'm going to say I'm hept this and that he doesn't do that same like it doesn't restore everything like he won't redo cabinet artwork and all that jazz but in terms of like the mechanics and making a game brand new again there's nobody as good as Eddie or at you know he is as good as anybody in the hobby and I can't say enough about how excited I am to see what he's doing with the tails machine because it's it's coming back from the dead and it wasn't even dead it just look like it was about to die.

[44:32] So I think people are learning that lesson and you know what people should do just buy games from people that actually have a true a proven track record speaking of proven track record spooky pinball let's move on to them so total nuclear annihilations are shipping people are unboxing them and people are having a great time I'm not seeing any issues with the game I'm seeing nothing but smiles and thumbs up and this games grade and everyone is jumping on it and it's never leaving my game room and I'm having a great time.

[45:02] Happy man Scott must be like a pig and shit he went from designing his game in his basement to now it's a real game now it's out there for the rest of his life he can tell people you know I made a pinball machine and it sold and people are enjoying it and loving it and that's that's a good feeling in life you just feel good when you produce something you're proud of and that other people are proud of and are enjoying and that's that's all the only good feeling as an adult I I is that is that feeling that I produce something.

[45:32] And I think Scott should be very proud and I think it's great that people are unboxing them and I just I love the fact that spooky just gets the games out when they say they're going to get the games out.

[45:41] I you know I do think spooky is on the something in terms of being a contract manufacturer I think if they were smart they would also find the next TNA like who is it the night member for Christmas like what game out there has someone been making for a long time that they could like put into production because I think it's it's a proven track record that this stuff comes out.

[46:01] And I think it's a track record that this stuff can work and that there are buyers out there.

[46:06] Speaking of old you know spooky making games how wrong were we all on Rob Zombie and the future value of Rob Zombies and there's a Rob Zombie Ellie up for sale right now in Pinside for $5,800.

[46:20] Now remember the game knew originally was $6,500 at a $5,800 this game's like mint it's got it's got all these upgrades in it.

[46:28] There's no buyers and so if you think about it that person paid $6,500 they modded it so let's say they put in like a few hundred bucks in mods then you've got you you know you're losing over $1,000 on this machine after a year you could argue like if you played it a bunch you know you got your entertainment out of it and move on.

[46:49] I would argue like it's a lot of money to lose a thousand dollars plus on a machine is a lot to lose there's no there's no way around that.

[46:57] You know I think we're going to see Rob Zombies and America's most honoured I think they're all going to just sort of net out around this like $4,000 to $5,000 price range I think that's just where they're going to end up.

[47:10] They're never going to be like that sought after and they're never going to become like something that like collectors are going to clamor to have.

[47:17] And then you know over time the prices will just keep going down and down and down because it's like this it's like this would you rather have an America's most honoured or let's say a judge dread would you rather have an America's most honoured or you know let's say a I'm trying to think like other games that are from back in the day that don't sell for that much money.

[47:40] Got them trying like a total blank this is where I should like take better show notes and like figure these things out but you know talking about like a Johnny new monic or the shadow right these games they sell for like anywhere from like two to 3,000 maybe 4,000 and they're good games are like they're enjoyable games like what is a roadhouse sell for now what you know what is.

[48:02] Yeah I mean so you know what I'm talking about right there's just a lot of games that are available.

[48:08] And then speaking of that same point with this machine so I saw a dominoes for sale and I have to say like I am I'm trying I'm going to be nicer I'm going to be nicer I'm going to be nicer dominoes pinball machine was never meant to be a game that was for pinball collectors it was never meant to be a game that was for the hard core person it was never meant to be a game that would be in an arcade.

[48:30] It was just commissioned by dominoes to to be given to to dominoes franchise the owners who are millionaires right it's just something cool to have out in the wild right we could put some pinball machines in dominoes locations and that's that right.

[48:45] Okay that being said if you play dominoes pinball as a pinball enthusiasts I don't know how you can come away from that game being like that's a good pinball machine I mean it's and it's not meant to be it's so basic.

[49:00] And so someone is selling a dominoes pinball machine for $4,600 and that's my point is like nobody who loves pinball would go spend $4,600 on a dominoes because it's such a mediocre to bad game when they could go get like a real great game from the 90s or you know 80s that is just much better for much cheaper right but I love this about pinside this is what I love.

[49:27] I love like the comments in threads like this you know whenever someone's trying to sell something then the next comment is great guy and a great game looks in plays flawlessly all right then the next is like wow nice price nice price on a dominoes and then the next post is bump lower price bump the guy keeps lowering the price I love this comment this is a really good shooting game way more depth than I expected great.

[49:57] So I think that's a good price for a very rare game I mean are these people the friends of the seller that they're fluffing up a dominoes I think if you fluff up a dominoes sale like your your balls should just like explode like that that that's a criminal thing to do is fluff up the sale of the dominoes then this guy right wow that's a cheap price for a game that was 5500 just a few months ago okay so almost there like who paid who would pay the money for the money.

[50:27] So I think that's a 5500 for a dominoes ever ever if you love pinball 5500 like that's the price of an aero smith pro of a star wars pro pretty much of any stern pro any stern pro is a thousand times better than dominoes and my point is this is that some games like dominoes will be worth almost nothing because nobody who collects pinballs will wanted so it'll just be this machine.

[50:57] That will just keep sinking in value if you bought dominoes for $4,600 I bet you in a year that game is going to be worth $3,600 because it's just never going to be in demand and I think people in pinball like to feel like games can't plummet that much in value like a game always has to be worth at least a couple thousand dollars and I'm here to tell you I don't know when you put out some of these new games and they're like they're horrendous.

[51:25] They might be worth shit in a few years because there's so many new games coming out so many and not only are they are every game is competing for every dollar every game is and so if you you know if you want to if you want to sell a game and you want people to hand you $4,600 for a dominoes you know that person can go get like maybe like a regular lord the rings that that's got a little where.

[51:54] What's a better experience a brand new dominoes or lord the rings it's been routed but still works right person you don't get a lot of stuff that's from like an error where like games were much better than dominoes is right so that that's that's interest I don't think that game is going to sell all right let's we're coming towards the end here I tell you coming towards the end all right so one thing I want to do is I want to wish Joe at laserific I want to wish Joe good health and I want to wish Joe as well as I want to do that.

[52:24] So, this is the best speedy recovery for those of you don't know this has happened a couple weeks ago Joe had a health scare looks like he got to the hospital before he maybe was going to suffer a heart attack and you know Joe's a great guy I've seen Joe at a lot of shows he makes some amazing toppers and you know we hear this a lot in this hobby it's people you know run into medical scares and we're all older dudes for the most part and this isn't like pinballs filled with a bunch of 18-year-olds.

[52:54] running around like at the you know in the youth of their life and we're you know as you get older

[53:01] and this is something that just comes with age you know the news never is better like things happen

[53:08] like we I'm always nervous about friends I have who are getting older my parents like people I

[53:13] love that are older like you know I wish Joe the best of health because without your health you

[53:19] can enjoy any of this it's it makes it really hard and we want all of you to be around for a really

[53:24] long time I mean even you Hilton even you or even you all you guys I I wish nothing but good

[53:29] health on everyone in this hobby and because when you're not feeling good you're you're incapable

[53:35] of enjoying things like this and so Joe we wish you the best and and get better soon my friend

[53:42] all right someone who's not a friend of Pinside is Pinsider Teyamo so this story was interesting

[53:49] so Teyamo is a a Pinsiders his real name is Patrick and I apparently he was selling a bunch of

[53:55] parts he's been selling parts for a while and a Pinsider came on and said look I gave this guy

[54:01] 28 bucks and never got my item and that was 72 days ago and then other people started coming

[54:07] forward and saying yeah I've been waiting to and I even spent more money and like I don't know

[54:12] where my money is and it's like avoid this guy his username is Teyamo and so what happens this guy

[54:18] comes out and he posts in apology and he basically says you know I'm sorry for the harm I've caused

[54:25] people I I've been battling a drug addiction and I my life some mess and you know I I'm sorry that

[54:33] I haven't given you the products you paid for and I suggest you take it up with PayPal and then

[54:40] you know I'm sorry but but he didn't say he was gonna give people a refund and this started like

[54:45] the whole like well what like what is he even like apologizing and he got a whole bunch of

[54:50] downvotes and the bottom line is this when you buy something from somebody you know you just be

[54:57] careful who you give your money to and if you ever send money to anybody anybody unless you know

[55:03] them unless they are a good friend of yours or a family member that you trust never ever send

[55:09] PayPal money using the friends or family like ability which doesn't charge you anything right

[55:17] because if that person just walks away with your money you have no power to get your money back

[55:23] and PayPal won't help you because you've kind of robbed PayPal PayPal is set up to protect you

[55:30] and that's what you pay the fee for it's like an insurance policy and I read time and time again

[55:36] people always send money friends and family and then when they get burned they're like they're

[55:39] they're kicking screen that they want their money back so look it sucks this guy's obviously got

[55:45] real issues with his life and I don't think people are gonna get their money back I think for you

[55:49] guys who gave him money you can have to chalk it up as a loss all right our last item of the day is

[55:54] a ridiculous item of the day and that is that there that there is a cactus canyon continued

[56:00] for sale on ebay no it's on pincide sorry a home use only cactus canyon cactus canyon continued

[56:09] which is obviously there was no continued it's just the software has been updated for the cheap

[56:14] affordable price of eighteen thousand dollars now here's the funny part this guy's got it listed

[56:20] for sale and he's he listed as home use only new for eighteen thousand dollars and it's got all

[56:25] these mods and it's got everything you can you can think of in the game but then he says he's been

[56:29] playing it and it plays great plays great it's new and people are like what the f dude if it's new

[56:37] you shouldn't be playing it then it's not new if you pulled it out of the box and played it and

[56:41] that is the issue when you want to list stuff as being new in box or home use only new no plays the

[56:48] second you take it out of the box the less it is worth if this guy had a cactus canyon new in

[56:54] box unopened it would be worth more than probably eighteen thousand dollars but the fact that he

[57:01] took it out even put all those stuff into it decreases the price now look I also think cactus canyon

[57:07] is going to be remade I think it's a very good shot at a remake I think it'll be after monster

[57:12] bash they're going to remake cactus canyon I think the prices on cactus canyons are going to

[57:18] plummet when they get remade and it's going to happen you know we don't speak that much about

[57:24] Chicago gaming anymore in attack from our remake but they're not going away they've been successful

[57:28] they've sold a lot of games people are happy with them the qualities there they are not going away

[57:34] so the remake threat of these older titles will continue to decrease the value of the games that

[57:40] have skyrocketed I they're not going to lose like all their value right they're not going to these

[57:45] games will still be worth like around like you know ten nine thousand dollars the originals but

[57:51] they're never going to be like twice the price of the remakes never ever ever will that happen

[57:56] all right I think that is it for the Sunday edition of canators pinball podcast that's episode 176

[58:04] I'm about to hit end and I'm going to go to pioneer bar where I'm going to play Batman 66

[58:12] which is on location I'm going to take twenty bucks and go have a fun hour playing a fifteen

[58:19] thousand dollar machine and when I leave there I will still have fifteen thousand dollars in the bank

[58:26] and I will have enjoyed the machine as much as everyone else in America and I will have my money

[58:32] isn't that just a better way to play pinball have a great day everyone and we'll talk to you real soon

[58:49] so
