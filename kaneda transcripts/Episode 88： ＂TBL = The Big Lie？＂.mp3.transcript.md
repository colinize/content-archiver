[00:00] the whole world got crazy!

[00:02] The only one around here gives a shit about the rules!

[00:12] I hate to say I told you so but I told you so.

[00:16] And I've been saying this for months now in this podcast

[00:20] that there is going to be a contraction of companies

[00:24] in the pinball industry happening in 2017 and there's no way around it.

[00:28] There's no way around it. There's no way around it.

[00:30] It is simple mathematics that these companies cannot survive.

[00:36] They cannot survive going years without shipping games.

[00:40] Who is paying for all that time?

[00:42] Who is paying for the expenses, for the wages, for the manufacturing, for the bills?

[00:48] And that is something that we're going to talk about

[00:52] because today lots of people are frustrated.

[00:56] We heard from a Dutch pinball has finally broken the silence about why it's taking so long

[01:06] for the big Lebowski's to ship.

[01:08] And we've been told for months by is it JAP YAP over there in the Netherlands?

[01:14] We've been told by the Dutch pinball executives that it was a board issue.

[01:20] It was a board issue and that's the reason why they weren't shipping.

[01:24] And we found out today that that was 100% a flat out lie.

[01:30] Now what is going on?

[01:34] Let's go back and just recap what's happened today.

[01:38] For some reason people have been impatient about the Lebowski delays.

[01:42] It's been going on for months now.

[01:46] When people saw that Dutch pinball was coming to Texas pinball festival

[01:50] I think a lot of people assumed that that meant good news.

[01:53] Like why would he come to Texas in March if he did not have good news to share?

[01:57] But then the dam just breaks today.

[02:00] And we see all this about the reason the games are not shipping is that

[02:06] ARA who has been contract manufacturing or sort of contracted to manufacture the games for Dutch pinball

[02:14] has stopped manufacturing them.

[02:17] And where the story gets really sort of dubious and nefarious is that what Dutch pinball is telling its customers is inaccurate.

[02:28] It's not a board issue.

[02:30] We know A&R makes the boards for Dutch pinball games.

[02:33] So A&R came out and said, you know what?

[02:36] They're not being honest.

[02:38] They owe us money and that's why we've stopped making the games.

[02:42] The reason why you don't have your big Lebowski is because Dutch pinball hasn't paid us.

[02:47] In fact, I want to read the note or the email that ARA sent out to its customers.

[02:54] It basically says, we hear by inform you that ARA in October 2016 has put to a stop the production and delivery of the pinball machine in favor of Dutch pinball BV until further order.

[03:10] The reason for this step is the fact that Dutch pinball is not willing and able to meet its payment obligations to ARA.

[03:18] Contrary to what has been published in December 2016, there never has been a problem in parts for the production of pinball machines at ARA.

[03:28] Already produced and complete pinball machines can be shipped immediately by ARA once Dutch pinball has met all of its payment obligations.

[03:37] Okay, so we've heard that there are, I think something like 30 or 50 machines that are built and completed and they are now being held by ARA and they won't go out until Dutch makes their payments.

[03:51] So what does this mean? What are the possible outcomes that can happen here?

[03:57] So what we've heard from Dutch is that ARA is sort of, I don't know, for lack of a better word is extorting them for more money and saying that they want a thousand euros more per machine and Dutch is saying that that's not possible.

[04:15] Now, I don't know what to believe, right? This is one of those sort of stories where it's a he said she said and it looks like it's headed towards litigation.

[04:26] And I feel really bad today because this has just like been a shitty time for so many different people in the pinball hobby who have been burned because we've got the Zidware thread and John Papaduke thread popping.

[04:42] We've got Kevin Kool-Aid thread going all over the place and now we have the Big Lebowski and Dutch pinball in question.

[04:50] And I want to read something, let's see, that because I know, like I've been saying this, like rare heroes, we all know he's in on it.

[04:58] He basically said he's concluded the following things after reading everything today.

[05:04] One, Dutch lied about the PCB issue, that's indisputable now. Two, ARA says Dutch won't pay them. They both admit this fact.

[05:14] However, is Dutch telling the truth about the reason? They're now known liars so I'm not giving them the benefit of the doubt.

[05:22] And three, they claim they'll announce a solution within the next few weeks. We know how that goes.

[05:27] They will be at the Texas show and they will not be able to get away with bullshitting any further.

[05:32] So, the good news is this, I know that CoinTaker, most people who have Big Lebowski's on order, have them through a few distributors and CoinTaker has your money, it doesn't get sent to Dutch.

[05:46] And I think Nitro is the same way. So if you want to refund, go get one. Go get one.

[05:52] I think this is really troublesome news. It is not good news at all when you hear something like this.

[06:01] I did find it so funny when someone listed their Big Lebowski for sale after hearing this news on Pinside for $9,000.

[06:10] When I saw something like that, I'm like, you gotta be kidding me man. You're really gonna go sell your pain to someone else.

[06:17] You know that today, you got horrible news and this whole thing might collapse or might be in a stall period now for months, even a year.

[06:27] So, I think this is how long it's gonna take to solve this issue. And you're gonna try and sell your spot. Good luck.

[06:33] If anyone who buys that spot today is pretty much a sucker. So, I think this is, I've predicted this.

[06:42] And for those of you who say, Canadian, you've been negative, you're not rooting for these new companies to succeed.

[06:49] This is why I get nervous when I see so many people running to hand their money to Andrew Highway,

[06:57] running to hand their money to Dutch Pimball, running to hand their money to Zidware when they did.

[07:03] These building a Pimball machine and building a Pimball machine company is such an arduous process. It's such an almost impossible task.

[07:15] Why people think these companies overnight can accomplish what Stern has learned over 30, 40 years is beyond me.

[07:23] There is an institutional knowledge required to really run a Pimball company. And I still go back to what I said on this podcast months ago.

[07:32] In fact, a year ago, when I rode back in a taxi with Mr. George Gomez from Stern, and we were just talking about companies, he said,

[07:42] Dutch Pimball will not succeed because they are using a contract manufacturer to make their games.

[07:49] That is going to be their downfall. And I said that and I've said this on this podcast. And I think when I saw the news today,

[07:57] I'm like, well, here's what he warned of coming true. And the problem with contract manufacturing is you're simply not in control.

[08:06] Who knows what the real issue is, right? Is it Dutch Pimball underestimate how much work would go into completing a game or how much it would cost to make the boards on the Bowsky.

[08:20] So that ARA is now saying like, hey guys, like what we originally quoted you can't be a price we can still do because of how expensive it is and how complicated it is to put these things together.

[08:33] So we need a thousand euro more per game. So let's say that is the case. Let's say that is the scenario that all these games are sitting there.

[08:40] The question that mean comes how much total money does Dutch Pimball owe and should Dutch Pimball just tell their customers, hey look, we owe, let's say it's a thousand per game.

[08:52] And there's 50 games sitting there and we owe them 50,000 euro more per game or sorry per unit or volume all these games.

[09:02] We need more money, right? So do they go to everyone who bought a La Bowsky and say we need 1500 US dollars more right now to get your machine.

[09:10] I don't think those 50 people would have a problem poning that up just to get it because I know that the months and months of waiting are the most painful thing for these guys and some of these guys.

[09:23] I mean I've been talking to some of them today. They're in on this machine. They're in on Magic Girl. They're in on Raza.

[09:32] A lot of these guys who support new companies, they're in on Alien. They've been feeling nothing but the burn and nothing but frustration and nothing but anxiety.

[09:43] And I said it. I said it. These companies are not all going to survive and I'm not rooting for them to fail. But when I look at the antics and I see that they lie.

[09:53] So the problem with Dutch right now is they've lied. And once you lie about something, it's hard to go back. And someone said that Dutch admitted to them that they were lying about the boards to buy themselves time.

[10:07] And we've seen this before. We've seen lies and we've seen other myths, truths and other sort of stall tactics occur across the board by other manufacturers as well.

[10:21] When they don't want to tell you the customer the reality of your game, the state of production, where your money's at, the likelihood of when you'll get your game, the likelihood of you getting a refund.

[10:36] They don't tell you the truth. And I, you know, I sat here today at work and I'm still at work right now and I'm getting this up quickly for you guys because, you know, this is Canadian's pinball podcast. We cover stuff as it breaks.

[10:48] And I've been reading the thread. You know, I, and I just came out of it and I just felt like deflated. I'm like, here we go again.

[10:56] Another bullshit company is lying to people is not telling the truth. And now it sucks the life out of the hobby. It completely sucks the life out of the hobby.

[11:09] And this type of stuff, I think boutique pinball has almost ruined pinball for so many people out there. A few years ago, when Dutch rolled into Expo like a bunch of rock stars, look at them now.

[11:25] And it's, is it worth it? Did we really reach a phase where we need all these new pinball companies to come take our money? You know, they're all backed by consumers.

[11:37] These companies are not, they're not finance independently. Your money is what keeps these companies afloat. And you deserve better than what you're getting. You know, I just cannot for the life of me understand why they lied and thought they'd get away with it.

[11:54] And the fact that the company, ARA is battling them now with emails to customers to dispute what they've said is really worrisome, really worrisome. But nobody learns their lesson. It doesn't matter.

[12:09] If you, you guys still probably won't give up your spots. You still probably won't ask for a refund because there's just this FOMO approach to all these new titles. And you buy the hype and you have this fear of missing out.

[12:23] And so these guys continue this bad behavior. It's a cycle of contempt that just doesn't seem to have an end in sight.

[12:30] Speaking of cycle of contempt and how can we just keep repeating ourselves? How many times have I made fun of Andrew Highway for saying two weeks that everything's going to be within two weeks?

[12:43] And I just saw three hours ago someone asked, what's the plan, time table process for alien kids and full throttle CPU upgrades? And Andrew writes, the kit box is designed and just needs to be prototype.

[12:57] This should be complete within two weeks. I mean, just shoot me now. Everything, you know, Andrew, just you can't use two weeks anymore. Just say, just say 14 days.

[13:10] But every, you know, it's just all we ever hear is that stuff is going to be, you know, it's just going to be a matter of weeks before we get solutions. And we want to hear Dutch pinball say they're going to have an update within a few weeks.

[13:23] Why would we believe these guys? They've lied for months. And they clearly, they clearly don't have a solution worked out. And, you know, I think the whole thing is blowing up in their face right now. And if they were smart, they'd come clean and explain them.

[13:39] And explain themselves, but my point, my point is this, I'm just tired of all these companies. I'm tired of watching so many of you just be in pain. And I, you know, I've been bummed out today.

[13:55] I got some correspondence from some people about John and Jay Poppin and Magic Girl and the anger and that thread and people are pissed off. And I've seen people pissed off in a Kevin thread and this thread.

[14:11] And you know, somewhere out there, Eros Smith probably shipped today and no one even paid any attention to it. Somewhere out there, pinball is being played and enjoyed. But man, it's been nothing but bad news by these boutique companies.

[14:27] And what do we do now? That's the question each and every one of you needs to ask yourselves. Do you continue to support these, these new institutions who have done nothing but misdeadlines?

[14:43] And I've said it before and everyone just yells at me and tells me I need to shut up and I'm wrong and you got guys like wise snow and these other shills misleading you guys.

[14:53] But the same delays that Dutch went through or the same delays that Andrew went through with highway pinball and alien. And how can you go two years, create an entire company, pay for all the parts, buy all that expensive having machinery, pay your employees.

[15:11] And not ship many games and ship no aliens for two years. And then how can you succeed? How can the bomb per game still be what you thought it was when you started envisioning the game?

[15:27] And I think all these companies do it as backwards and I've said it before, you need to finish the game, finish the bomb, design it, have it ready for production and then reveal it and announce it. But they've all done the complete opposite.

[15:43] You know, they've all sort of teased it, they announced it first, they announced the price but none of them have like production down. None of them know it's really going to cost to do.

[15:53] You know, the basket is even the most frustrating simply because they show what look like a final game and they got everyone to go in on it and then they went and decided to reengineer the whole thing over a two year period.

[16:04] I've heard from some owners that their Lebowski machines are rock solid. I've heard from other owners that it's a piece of crap that breaks down every day.

[16:12] The answer is probably somewhere in the middle. But if you think that because one alien Pimmel machine went on a truck and made its way to the US that all is fine in highway land, you're crazy.

[16:26] There is no way that Andrew is in a great financial position right now and I'm not rooting for them to fail. But something that doesn't lie is money.

[16:38] You either have money, you've either planned for your company to be successful financially or you haven't.

[16:47] And when you run out of money, you run out of money. The only thing you have left are excuses and lies and stall tactics.

[16:55] And when I see these stall tactics, when I see misdeadlines, misdates, all this stuff, I've seen it by Dutch, I've seen it by highway.

[17:03] I've said it, I think both these companies are in extreme jeopardy of collapsing at any day guys, any day.

[17:12] For some reason, Pimball fanboys think that there's like this manifest destiny around these machines and there's a higher power at play here.

[17:22] And the world needs new inbox Pimball machines. I hate to break it to you, but it doesn't.

[17:28] Pimball is an archaic form of entertainment. It is having a resurgence. Yes, it is in barcades. And the company that is caching in on that resurgence is Stern Pimball and nobody else.

[17:42] Stern Pimball is making money. Stern Pimball probably made millions on Ghostbusters, millions on Batman, 66.

[17:51] Everyone else is struggling to stay above water. If you think Jersey Jack Pimball is in the green and doing great and making a lot of money, I highly doubt it.

[18:03] But I bet Jack and his investors have a plan for down the road. But I don't see that level of investment occurring over at highway or over at Dutch.

[18:12] And when these two companies, they're extremely volatile. And the more you let the shills convince you that everything is all right, then you're in big trouble.

[18:22] And I get tired. I get tired of being labeled as the bad guy because all I'm doing is using using the words of these manufacturers against them.

[18:37] If you go back and listen to Andrew's old interviews and you listen to how many full throttles he thought he was going to sell, he thought it was going to be in the thousands. And these are things he's said he's gone on the record for saying this.

[18:51] He said he was going to be making three to four titles a year. He said that.

[18:56] All these things are words coming from these people. Are those not lies? What are they then? What is it if you say you're going to do something and then you don't do it?

[19:08] Did you lie or were you confused or did unforeseen things occur? Whatever it is. I know it's really got to be the most stressful and difficult thing in the world to create a Pimball company.

[19:24] And you know what I do? I mean look at pictures of Andrew from when he started Highway Pimball to pictures now. I mean it looks like he's had tons of sleepless nights. He's endlessly stressed out. And it's got to just be eating away at him.

[19:37] And look, now is the point where like I hope they get the game out and things occur. But now you guys, you customers out there, you Pimball, hobbyists, you collectors, no matter what the theme is, no matter how much you emotionally want these things out.

[19:53] You have to understand that there is a good chance that you may lose your money. There's a good chance that your money might be frozen within an organization for very long periods of time.

[20:08] And you should also just remind yourself that no game, no matter how rare or limited or difficult to find, ever becomes impossible to acquire.

[20:20] All these games, alien elite, big Lebowski, all these games, you're going to be able to get them. You're going to be able to get them as new games come out as the years go on.

[20:32] These games will be up for sale. And by the chance, by the time you actually get a chance to buy them, there's a really good chance the game will actually be finished like the code will be done. And any mechanical issues will be figured out.

[20:46] So it's just been like a really, really deflating day for so many of you guys out there. And it sucks. It sucks. You know, as I said, like it just sucks the life out of the hobby that this is what's happening.

[20:59] Look, you know, I went into the magic girl thread too. And it's just so much like misinformation that everybody has. Someone wrote this about me getting a magical they wrote.

[21:11] Hearing that guy owning one is like extra Hershey squirts on this poop pie. Wonder if he opens it up and takes it out of the box. Right? So yeah, like I don't know why people are so pissed off.

[21:24] I didn't do anything that was inappropriate. You know, I remember, remember my reputation.

[21:31] Canada's the guy who ripped off Colton for his Fixit Felix Jr. And canada's the guy who, you know, can't be trusted. And canada's such a liar and he's all this. All the negative things I heard you guys say about me.

[21:44] And then ask the guy who I bought my tails of the rebubing nights from. Ask him how bad I was to deal with when he got his money within an hour fully paid.

[21:53] Ask that, you know, when I when I paid for magic girl money was sent over immediately the next day full full wire transfer of the whole thing. Right? So talk to me about how stupid I am. Talk to me about how how I've ripped people off.

[22:09] You know, you guys got it all wrong. You got it all wrong. And I'm an idiot. I you know, I heard so much from Iceman about how much I was an idiot for getting a magic girl spot in this and that and this and that.

[22:20] And no Iceman, I didn't spend $20,000. I'm not disclosing what I spent on the machine, but it doesn't really matter. Why does it matter to people? Why does it matter? And no, I didn't get magic girl for a discount. Why do you guys think magic girl would sell for like a discount? I don't understand.

[22:36] You know, everyone just thinks what they want to think and everyone believes what they want to believe know this know this. You know, I I'm happy with the deal I made for magic girl. And so is the person who who who I did the deal with you guys don't understand like me in this gentleman we everyone has lives like we have other things going on like this is a pinball machine and and it's going to be a pinball machine. It's not going to cure cancer. It's not going to make my life better or worse. It's not going to make me a more important.

[23:05] A more important individual and I love to have people were just like I bet this guy writes I bet it just chaps his ass that he can't be on here bragging about it to isn't that right special K because we all know damn well he reads it on here. Yeah, of course that's from user.

[23:22] VDOJQVDajak I don't know how to tell that stands for yeah, of course I read Pinside you fool I do a podcast that primarily focuses on Pinside and I'm not bragging about getting a magic girl I am not at all in fact I've said it time and time again like I want to collect rare pinball machines and I always love magic girl for the piece of artwork that it is.

[23:49] But I do understand that it is a a tainted game with lots of people angry and lots of people feeling unsettled by the whole thing and I you know I don't feel great about that at all and it's it's just the way it is so.

[24:06] You know and then let's see like iceman road he paid 20k not sure if I believe money actually change hands at the time because unbelievably stupid then but he claims he actually did it maybe he can flip that box of lights for whatever guarantee you he's already trying to find a sucker to take it off his hands.

[24:24] You know and iceman like I talked to you bro like personally I don't know why you're saying I'm a sucker for buying a magic girl if I have a magic girl I guarantee you it's worth way more than you're all your stones combined and it will be and you will kick yourself that you didn't get in on one and you led the you led the the the Zidware you wave the Zidware flag for so long then you were like against it where for so long and and look I'm going to say I'm going to get a little bit more of a magic girl.

[24:54] I just don't like I know you're just being funny like all the like these guys are great guys like Rob T is a great guy like iceman's a great guy it's just the way you know it's just what these posts do to people.

[25:07] You know levees on there saying he's going to come by and play it.

[25:11] You know so this is like what it is this is what pinballs become these days it is a dramatic cesspool this week.

[25:20] I hope that we get better news moving into Texas pinball festival because I just don't want I just don't want people to go to Texas I don't want this hobby to turn into.

[25:33] I'm like what did I do like I can't believe like I lost my money I don't know how to get my money back this sucks that sucks this sucks that sucks.

[25:40] You know how how in all of this in all of this in all fairness how thankful are you right now for stern pinball how thankful are you now I know some of you are still like pissed off about quality issues and this and that and yes we saw that stern mailed that Ghostbusters guy a piece of sandpaper and some clear coat and yes like what the F is that but for every stupid thing stern does that.

[26:10] They do a thousand good things they get thousands of games out to people and to satisfy customers for every KPG out there who's upset there's hundreds and hundreds of people who are not upset who love Ghostbusters who consider Ghostbusters to be one of the greatest pinball machines ever.

[26:29] Those people don't always go on pinside and say that it's a lot easier to go on and scream about how much you hate something or hate stern or hate the game and the quality and all that stuff but if it wasn't for stern these guys wouldn't nobody would be enjoying pinball mostly you know year and a year out they are the only ones that consistently deliver.

[26:53] I've changed tune I've changed my outlook on this hobby completely I honestly don't think there needs to be so many new inbox offerings for this archaic hobby it is a toy of yester years arcades are dead these are collectible items now there are a few barcades out there but hardly any I think it's come to the point now right rather have less manufacturers less who actually have their shit together

[27:22] then this current shit show we're in where we've got all these freaking like bullshit companies lying to us pretending to have pinball companies set up asking for our money when they all know damn well they are so close to going under I'm so sick of that shit like I'm tired my my my support is for stern and it's for spooky and it's for anyone else anyone else out there who can prove that I'm not going to be a good guy.

[27:52] I'm so happy to prove that when people give them their money they get a game and you know what I'll add to that Jersey Jack I mean people got their machines I know they weighed it a long time but I will only support pinball companies that ship machines in a reasonable period of time and and everyone else everyone else needs to earn the trust and the credibility and the respect of this hobby of this community of these buyers and the shows out there.

[28:22] The wise knows the people that keep bleeding the blind you know it in those people need to stop they need to stop what they're doing and we need to be more critical and ask the hard questions when I when I talk about asking the hard questions I'm not doing this guys because I want to slander and go on a smear campaign for these companies I'm doing it to entice you guys to put your big boy pants on the table.

[28:52] And be adults ask questions would you go into a car dealership and just hand them your money or would you ask questions would you go on forums and read blue book reviews would you try and get a better sense of like the quality of the brand not in pinball you guys pay first and then you just cross your fingers and dream that everything is going to work out and it keeps on not working out.

[29:18] So I'm sick of it I'm sick of it I'm tired of it I think twenty seventeen is going to be the year where a lot of it just collapses where a lot of it falls apart and people are going to be left burned people are going to and people are going to exit the hobby in large numbers because they're going to be burned they're not going to be satisfied with what stern has to offer and they're just going to get out you got to be you got to say if you send a friend of yours today send him a pin side and say look

[29:47] Hey man you should join the pinball world you should become a pinball collector you should become part of this community and your friend who's never been a part of it before clicks down the top like ten threads today they be like what the fuck are you talking about man why would I get into this hobby where all it is is people bitching about getting ripped off about having their money frozen about being lied to why the fuck would I enter this you know when I go on to the all my car foreign

[30:17] and other forms I'm on nobody nobody is suffering the way pinball people are suffering right now and I have to say this though you guys got to go buy a mirror because there's nobody as much as these liars and these companies stole like you're they stole your dreams guys they stole your dreams but you have nobody to blame but yourself you really don't I I'm you know and I'm not blaming victims here

[30:45] but everyone it was so quick to give money over and I'm saying this now if you have chances to get refunds and hold on to your money for go go don't delay why would you wait why you gonna wait it out oh my god because you know again it's the stars in your eyes you're all so hopeful

[31:06] and like I won't believe magic girls real until it's actually in my apartment I don't believe nothing seems real in this hobby lately it all seems so like like just an illusion like an abhorition so you know that I think there's a lot of soul searching that's going to be going on and this isn't this isn't the kind of podcast I want to put up this isn't very entertaining this isn't very fun
