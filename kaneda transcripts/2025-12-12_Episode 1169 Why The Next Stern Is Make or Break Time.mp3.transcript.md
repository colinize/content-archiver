[00:00] Can't nobody tell me nothing?

[00:03] Can't tell me nothing.

[00:30] New Cornerstone Game.

[00:32] A lot is riding on this game.

[00:36] If this game is not a hit, Stern is in trouble.

[00:40] I think Stern is in trouble either way.

[00:42] As I think about what we've been talking about with Stern this week and I saw someone post

[00:48] on Pinside, everyone's favorite, Stern's Shill, Neil McRae, zero cabinet failures on the new

[00:56] Bracket It way to make cabinets over at Stern and here's the thing that these Stern Apologists

[01:03] don't get.

[01:05] When I go to Ikea and I buy furniture and it's got those little pegs like the Stern

[01:11] cabinet and it's got brackets, I don't expect my dresser to fail or my cabinetry to fall

[01:20] apart but it's still cheap because I bought it at Ikea and it came flat in a box and I

[01:28] assembled it.

[01:30] This isn't like true craftsmanship happening now over at Stern with these cabinets and I

[01:37] think what people don't get is simply this.

[01:40] It can not fail and be cheaper.

[01:45] So that's what they've done.

[01:46] They've made it so it's just a cheaper product but here's the problem.

[01:50] They're charging the most they've ever charged for pinball machines and so when you open

[01:56] up your new Stern Spike 3 and it's got a $30 Raspberry Pi and a new cheaper cabinet, are

[02:05] you really going to be excited to spend more than you've ever spent on these games and

[02:10] it becomes so crystal clear the dilemma this company has.

[02:16] I don't care that they have to find new efficiencies and ways to make more margin to stay more

[02:22] profitable.

[02:23] They've got a big ship.

[02:25] They've got hundreds of people that have to go through that door every day and Georgian

[02:30] company have to pay for their salaries, their health care, their benefits.

[02:34] It's not easy and I just don't understand though because the moves they make as a company

[02:39] continue to feel like they're moving in the wrong direction.

[02:43] You've got an industry now and this is the thing I don't think they anticipated because

[02:47] I think Stern was sort of operating in a little bit of a bubble.

[02:51] If we do this they will come.

[02:53] If we just keep putting things in boxes they'll buy it regardless of the loss of value.

[02:58] I don't think what they anticipated though is not about their product per se because

[03:02] I think in their minds they're making the best versions of their games ever.

[03:08] They can't understand why the Walking Dead remastered is not selling.

[03:13] A little bit later on in the show I'm going to pull up the pin side marketplace and you're

[03:17] going to be shocked what these games Nuandbox are selling for on pin side.

[03:22] Matt pricing out the window.

[03:24] You can now go get this game for thousands less.

[03:27] So the Stern apologist out there, they really don't have any foundation to stand on.

[03:32] These games are losing instantly losing thousands of dollars in value.

[03:36] But they did not anticipate because they do think they're making the best games they've

[03:39] ever made.

[03:40] They did not anticipate that the competition would get to where it's at today.

[03:45] They did not anticipate Spooky Pinball would be putting Beetlejuices in boxes in just a

[03:51] month that look that good, that have all the assets, that have mechanisms like that.

[03:56] You got to remember like a few years ago Spooky Pinball was making stuff that made Stern look

[04:02] two to three times better.

[04:03] Now the reverse has happened.

[04:05] Beetlejuice looks two to three times nicer than what Stern is putting in a box.

[04:09] They did not anticipate barrels of fun.

[04:12] Putting games like Dune and Winchester out into the marketplace.

[04:16] I get the volume is small, but it doesn't matter.

[04:18] Like I said on the last show, same price.

[04:22] You know, if you're a customer of pinball and you're a part of the pinball community,

[04:25] you're really excited that the boutique companies are now offering products at this level with

[04:31] this much like theme integration with these many mechs with beautiful artwork.

[04:36] I mean, go look at a new Stern machine.

[04:38] Look at the decals on the side.

[04:40] It's like they stopped even doing the foil decals.

[04:43] They keep cutting back more and more.

[04:46] You know, when George Gomez opened up the back box and he's like, hey, let me show you something

[04:50] special that these LE buyers are getting.

[04:53] I don't think you know this.

[04:55] This is an exclusive and he shows a speaker, lighted speaker housing case as something

[05:02] that they should be proud of.

[05:03] They've lost the narrative.

[05:05] This company thought like HDMI out was something to boast about on the new Raspberry Pi spike

[05:11] three operating system.

[05:13] It's almost like they don't even know what to say anymore.

[05:16] And you can see it in George.

[05:17] He seems exhausted.

[05:18] And I want to ask each and every one of you, when was the last time we heard from anybody

[05:23] over at Stern where they sounded excited?

[05:27] Just think about that.

[05:28] What was the last thing you ever heard them be excited about?

[05:31] I'm excited about Beetlejuice.

[05:33] Look at the spooky family.

[05:35] Look at the Emory family.

[05:36] They're doing backflips all the way to the bank and they deserve it.

[05:40] And they're having the best damn holidays of their lives.

[05:43] You know, happy Luke and Bug are right now.

[05:46] They're probably the only two guys happier than Canada.

[05:49] You know, they are having so much fun over there.

[05:51] In fact, I just got a great email from Morgan Emery.

[05:55] She's like, Chris, I just wanted to let you know that we have the numbers for your five

[06:01] Beetlejuice games for your club members.

[06:03] Are you ready people?

[06:05] We are going to get for each and every one of you the opportunity to get game number

[06:09] 501, 502, 503, 504 and wait for it.

[06:15] Are you sitting down Joe Newhart?

[06:17] Are you even listening?

[06:19] 505.

[06:20] You know, we are right smack dab in the middle.

[06:23] I love it.

[06:24] Canada will be game number 999 and they are so happy and these games are going to be fully

[06:31] loaded.

[06:32] So if you get one of these games, it's going to be Butter Cabinet, Topper, everything,

[06:36] the Ghost Class, everything, everything will be on these games.

[06:39] You are not allowed to take any options off these games.

[06:43] You are getting a fully loaded Beetlejuice.

[06:45] Now I still don't know how exactly I'm going to handle this.

[06:49] I will say this.

[06:50] I am going to do it most likely after the holiday.

[06:54] So don't worry.

[06:55] A lot of people are traveling.

[06:57] A lot of people are focused on their families.

[07:00] I want you to be present with your families.

[07:02] I don't want you to worry about missing out at all.

[07:06] So don't worry.

[07:07] These games will not be allocated to buyers before January.

[07:12] So I just want to let everybody know and they're going to go for MSRP.

[07:16] I'm not scalping these games.

[07:18] Even though these games are going for well over $10,000 right now.

[07:23] So super excited.

[07:24] It's going to be a really fun beginning of 2026.

[07:27] We're going to get these Beetlejuice games out the door.

[07:30] We're going to get Stern Pinball's next game.

[07:32] Let's talk about it, man.

[07:34] Is it going to be Pokemon?

[07:35] I'm in the thread, the next Stern Machine, right?

[07:38] And these people are posting Pokemon stuff.

[07:40] I'm really, really worried that they don't get how small the percentage of people in

[07:48] this demographic are into Pokemon.

[07:52] We're not adverse to it.

[07:53] So maybe Pokemon might do for a lot of us what Godzilla did.

[07:58] Now look, we all grew up with Godzilla.

[08:00] Godzilla is just universally lovable.

[08:02] Right.

[08:03] He's been around for 70 freaking years.

[08:05] Like you never meet anyone that's like, you know what, man?

[08:07] I really hate Godzilla.

[08:08] He's stupid, man.

[08:09] There's a guy in this.

[08:10] You know, he's adorable.

[08:12] We loved his cameo and Pee Wee's big adventure.

[08:15] He's always been this adorable thing that comes out of the ocean.

[08:19] Post atomic Tokyo.

[08:21] He stomps on tanks.

[08:22] And even though humans know that tanks are not effective, we keep sending tanks at Godzilla.

[08:28] Godzilla, baby.

[08:30] There was a moment in a recent Godzilla movie that got really heartfelt at the end where

[08:35] someone said like, maybe there's a little bit of Godzilla in each and every one of us.

[08:40] I love stuff like that.

[08:42] Pokemon doesn't really have that campiness.

[08:44] It doesn't have that like 70 years of generational cross-generational love.

[08:49] Now look, it is the biggest IP in the world.

[08:52] It just is.

[08:53] It's the biggest IP in the world by far.

[08:57] So you'll never see me argue that there's not a lot of Pokemon fans.

[09:00] It's just does it cross over with the pinball buying demographic people?

[09:06] 40 to 60 who have disposable income.

[09:09] I can't wait to hear like, you know, some of the old curmudgens on pin side that are

[09:13] the stern apologists be like, yeah, man, I'm really into jigglypuff and Pikachu these days.

[09:18] You know, you're not, you know, you're not.

[09:20] And it's kind of strange to me that transformers is sort of being disregarded.

[09:26] Yet transformers is perfect for this demographic.

[09:30] Because remember, this isn't like the Shia Labouf transformer, the Michael Bay

[09:35] transformers. This is the transformers that we all grew up with.

[09:40] So I'm sort of surprised that transformers is being like,

[09:44] it's just another transformer game. Are you kidding me?

[09:47] Like this is the transformers we always wanted.

[09:50] This is G1. Now look, I've been saying it.

[09:52] I don't think Stern knows this franchise well enough. I don't.

[09:55] I think if Elliot Isman's making it, he did not grow up when transformers was big

[10:01] in the 80s. He was like born when transformers was like popular.

[10:05] The problem stern is going to face is this.

[10:07] They're going to make it on the TV show and they're not going to make it on the

[10:10] movie. And anyone who really knows transformers,

[10:13] that wants to make the most amazing transformers pinball machine knows that

[10:18] the transformer movie is where it's at with the soundtrack, with Unicron,

[10:23] because you've got everybody. You've got all the original guys you love.

[10:27] Hot Rod, Rodimus Prime, you've got Optimus Prime,

[10:31] you've got Galvatron, Megatron, everyone's in it.

[10:34] And look, if they make a transformers pinball machine and in the back of it,

[10:39] it isn't like Omega Supreme as a base or Fortress Maximus, right?

[10:44] And they don't have a huge Unicron head.

[10:47] See, they don't know this.

[10:48] I feel like Stern is sort of just like giving their designers assignments.

[10:53] So if you hand Elliot Isman transformers,

[10:56] that dude has to go watch all the episodes as a grown adult.

[11:01] And that's the issue. True passion, right?

[11:05] True passion comes from designers who grew up with these IPs.

[11:11] You know what I'm saying?

[11:12] It's like it forged an indelible love affair between the person and the property.

[11:18] You're never going to get that giving Elliot Isman the transformers assignment.

[11:23] You're never going to get that asking George Gomez to finish Pokemon.

[11:28] The dude has never seen a Pokemon episode in his life.

[11:31] So if he's working on Pokemon, we're in trouble.

[11:33] But I still have some Iota of faith that if Keith Elwyn is a Pokemon fan.

[11:41] All right, cool.

[11:42] Like I didn't realize he was.

[11:43] But if he is, that's awesome news.

[11:46] If he gets to do it, if his talents are applied to fall out and they give Pokemon

[11:53] to George Gomez to finish, I don't even have to like see the game to tell you right now.

[11:58] It's not going to hit.

[12:00] It's not going to have the one word.

[12:03] The one word that I think Stern is lacking.

[12:06] The one emotive thing that is the most important word in all of Pimbal.

[12:13] You will never get a great Pimbal machine unless the people making it have genuine passion.

[12:24] Passion is the most important thing in Pimbal.

[12:28] When I look over at spooky Pimbal, they are losing passion.

[12:32] Like passion is coming out of every pore of the spooky family.

[12:38] When I look over at Jersey Jack, they've got the passion, man.

[12:42] They do.

[12:43] I think Jack has just handed them some terrible themes, but that's going to change.

[12:48] And it changed with Harry Potter, but they've got the passion.

[12:52] Damn it.

[12:52] I know barrels of fun as passion, because if I said they didn't, David Van S would

[12:57] call me every single day to remind me how passionate they are.

[13:01] And I kind of appreciate that about David.

[13:04] It's like he's trying to convince me they have the passion.

[13:07] And David, you do.

[13:08] They have the passion.

[13:10] You know, I know they have passion because they get upset.

[13:14] Right.

[13:14] People that are passionate about what they're working on, they respond when people

[13:19] say things that are negative.

[13:21] I want to see a reaction.

[13:22] Imagine pouring years of your life into something and some internet blow hard.

[13:27] Who hasn't been in the gym in 15 years?

[13:30] Say you're lazy and you suck.

[13:32] You know what I'm saying?

[13:33] Of course I would jump in and be like, who the hell are you, man?

[13:37] I'd be like Stevie and he's bounding down.

[13:40] Who the F are you, man?

[13:41] Who the F am I?

[13:42] Right. I'm Keith freaking out when baby shut up.

[13:45] Canada, you couldn't design a paper airplane.

[13:49] So you know what I'm saying?

[13:50] I just don't think Stern has the passion.

[13:53] And I think the reason they don't have the passion anymore is because I think they

[13:56] brought in people from outside of pinball who don't have the pinball passion.

[14:01] They took a job.

[14:02] Doesn't it feel like we're getting games from people now that are just answering

[14:07] the assignment and where's the passion?

[14:10] Where's the wow?

[14:12] Damn brackets.

[14:13] Look at those corners, man.

[14:14] Look at the corners in those cabinets.

[14:16] That is the cheapest thing I've ever seen in pinball manufacturing.

[14:21] And then the apologizes are like, well, it's still stable.

[14:24] You know, it's not going to.

[14:25] The moisture is not going to affect it.

[14:27] It's cheap. It's cheap.

[14:29] I don't care if it falls apart or not.

[14:30] It's cheap.

[14:32] So we are going to see a reckoning in 2026.

[14:35] The companies with the passion will have the profit.

[14:40] See, this is the thing that George and Seth don't get.

[14:43] Guys, you know, all your cost cutting measures like we wouldn't notice.

[14:47] It's not good to be in Costco.

[14:50] It's not like, you know what I'm saying?

[14:51] It's like Costco is where you go for budget items.

[14:54] Like if I bought a Ferrari and then all of a sudden there was one at Costco,

[14:58] what brand did I just buy?

[15:01] Branding matters.

[15:03] Just because you could do something to get a few more sales doesn't mean you should.

[15:09] I think you'd be a lot better off.

[15:10] Think about how much more money they would make if they actually made a good

[15:14] Star Wars game versus throwing a bunch of crap in Costco.

[15:17] You're not allowed to say this,

[15:19] Canada's Friday, it's the holidays, the kids are healthy, the kids are happy.

[15:23] Why are you so upset?

[15:24] I'm not upset.

[15:25] I love this.

[15:25] I love that you guys are here.

[15:27] No one else talks like this, man.

[15:29] I, you know, look, I see some of these other content creators and they're like on

[15:33] the side of Stern, they're like defending their use of cheap cabinetry.

[15:38] Why? Why are you doing it?

[15:41] Why are you doing it?

[15:42] Why are you on the side of them?

[15:44] It's cheap.

[15:45] Anyone who's worked in the woodworking industry will look at that cabinet and say

[15:50] they went cheap.

[15:51] There is nothing about that that is an improvement.

[15:55] Spike three is turning out to be nothing but a cost cutting measure.

[16:02] That's all it is.

[16:04] Right. Look at the lighting in Star Wars.

[16:05] Is it any better than the lighting three, four years ago?

[16:08] No, nothing.

[16:10] It's just cheaper.

[16:11] Yeah, I get they say they have more computing power, but what is the computing

[16:14] power doing? What are you actually powering?

[16:17] What was the last wow mechanism Stern made?

[16:20] Let's think about it.

[16:21] Like I could just ask that question and just we could just have silence for the

[16:25] next five minutes, the last wow mechanism that Stern has made.

[16:29] Thirteen thousand dollar games.

[16:31] Well, not anymore.

[16:32] Let's pull up the pin side marketplace right now.

[16:34] You ready for this?

[16:35] If you pull up the pin side marketplace and I'm looking at games that are around

[16:39] like ten thousand dollars, this is brand new.

[16:41] This game just came out.

[16:43] The walking dead remastered for sale in Suffolk, New York for eleven thousand

[16:50] five hundred dollars, brand new, new in a box.

[16:52] This is a brand new game.

[16:54] It's a brand new game.

[16:55] This game just came out.

[16:57] So instantly you've lost fifteen hundred dollars on your game.

[17:02] So anyone out there, if you just bought a walking dead remastered

[17:06] LE for thirteen, how do you feel?

[17:08] Stupid. And like I've been saying, it's stupid.

[17:11] Another one, new in box for sale, twelve thousand dollars.

[17:15] I don't get it.

[17:16] I don't get it.

[17:17] Like literally.

[17:17] And this guy's like, look, I'm selling my remastered LE.

[17:21] I put down a thousand dollar deposit and I owe twelve thousand dollar balance.

[17:25] Machine will ship from distributor.

[17:27] Like, why would you put down a deposit on a game and now you don't want it?

[17:30] I don't even understand these people.

[17:32] You know, it's just left and right.

[17:34] D&D, LE, eleven thousand dollars.

[17:37] OK, another two thousand dollar loss.

[17:39] All right, here's the best buy on this marketplace.

[17:42] Big Bang Bar number sixty nine, baby.

[17:45] Sixty nine for forty thousand dollars.

[17:48] Or best offer makes no sense.

[17:51] A teenage mutant Ninja Turtles LE in a box.

[17:54] Ten grand. Wow.

[17:56] Here's a funny one.

[17:58] D&D in a box.

[17:59] LE thirteen thousand.

[18:01] Why?

[18:02] Why would anyone buy a D&D LE for thirteen when right above it is a game with hardly

[18:08] any plays for eleven so that box is worth two thousand dollars.

[18:13] Stranger Things LE with the topper.

[18:15] OK, this is interesting.

[18:16] This game was going for like nineteen at the height of covid.

[18:19] Remember when Stranger Things LE, nineteen.

[18:22] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[18:22] OK, here we go.

[18:23] Eleven thousand five hundred.

[18:26] The market is course correcting.

[18:28] Now, if people remember, Stranger Things LE was originally like ninety five hundred.

[18:33] So this person is still making a little bit of money, but the crazy days are over.

[18:37] Here's an X-Men.

[18:38] LE Uncanny X-Men.

[18:39] How much do you think?

[18:40] Ninety nine hundred.

[18:41] But it's sitting because these games have been selling for around eight thousand

[18:45] dollars recently. Here's another Uncanny X-Men.

[18:47] LE ten thousand dollars.

[18:49] Not going to sell a Tron.

[18:51] LE is one.

[18:53] I don't know.

[18:53] This Australian price.

[18:54] I don't know what the US would be.

[18:55] Twenty two thousand Australian.

[18:57] So I heard the Australian market is really, really tanking.

[19:01] Rush LE.

[19:03] How much do you think?

[19:04] Rush LE.

[19:05] I think Rush was was Rush the first game that was like eleven thousand five hundred.

[19:11] Wasn't Rush like right after Godzilla?

[19:13] Didn't it go like Rush was I think eleven five and then Foo Fighters I think was the

[19:18] first thirteen thousand dollar game.

[19:21] This Rush LE.

[19:22] Here we go. Ready?

[19:23] Nine thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars unsold.

[19:27] Another D&D, Tyrant's I, LE eleven nine unsold.

[19:32] Metallica remastered premium ten five unsold.

[19:36] I keep saying I don't know if I have to say I'd sold it everything.

[19:39] It just it sounds more dramatic.

[19:40] Right. Here's a game Elton John CE sale pending at twelve five.

[19:45] So, you know, Elton John CE was fifteen.

[19:48] It didn't really tank.

[19:50] That's kind of normal.

[19:51] Right. After two years, you expect a fifteen thousand dollar CE to sort of lose a couple

[19:57] grand like that's normal depreciation.

[20:00] Right. What you don't expect is Godfather CE to go from fifteen all the way down to

[20:05] eight gang eight is what they're going for.

[20:07] That's a seven thousand dollar loss.

[20:11] Harry Potter Collector's Edition, Newenbox, fourteen nine.

[20:15] All right. That is the asking price.

[20:16] John Wick, LE, baby.

[20:18] How much you think less than a hundred plays with the topper?

[20:22] OK, so how much was the John Wick topper?

[20:25] I want to say it was like a thousand dollars.

[20:27] So this is fourteen thousand dollars.

[20:29] You can now get it with less than a hundred plays.

[20:33] Nine thousand nine hundred dollars.

[20:35] OK, not sold.

[20:36] Right. I bet if you offered nine on the table,

[20:39] he'd take it, which is another four thousand dollar loss.

[20:44] Actually, it's a five thousand dollar loss because of the topper.

[20:48] Here's a Godzilla, Ellie.

[20:50] See, the prices are coming down, man.

[20:52] It's crazy.

[20:53] Godzilla, Ellie, twelve five.

[20:56] See, I remember when Godzilla's were

[20:58] consistently holding around like fifteen thousand, sixteen thousand.

[21:02] And the reason it came down is obviously

[21:04] because of the anniversary edition.

[21:06] Here's an anniversary edition for eleven five.

[21:08] You're not going to get that for the anniversary edition.

[21:11] You know, here's another Godzilla, Ellie.

[21:12] So this is what's funny about the Pinside Marketplace.

[21:15] This guy wants fourteen.

[21:16] So you've got the same exact game selling for twelve five and someone wants fifteen

[21:22] hundred dollars more.

[21:24] Ladies and gentlemen, here's my conclusion on all of this.

[21:28] Everything's starting to come down significantly.

[21:31] It's good. It's going to be a buyer's market.

[21:33] I think the FOMO rests with the boutique companies that have been making magic

[21:38] lately, Stern's next game in January.

[21:40] To me, it's everything.

[21:42] Like if this game is another flop, I think they're in big, big trouble.

[21:45] I really do.

[21:46] I don't think this company is used to this.

[21:49] Like they thought Walking Dead Remastered.

[21:50] Think about it.

[21:51] If George Gomez is true and says that it is seventy percent effort of making a full

[21:57] game went into making the Walking Dead Remastered.

[22:00] So let's just believe him on that.

[22:01] That's a lot of work to release a game that's a flop.

[22:05] And the game is a flop.

[22:07] The fact that it's brand new and in a box, you can now get it for eleven five

[22:12] instantly in absolute flop.

[22:15] And I'm not sure if anyone's calling meetings over at Stern, but someone should

[22:20] be accountable for the decision to bring this game back to market because it was a

[22:24] bad decision if it was another game like Batman, Tron, Lord of the Rings.

[22:30] It's not a flop.

[22:31] There was no demand for this.

[22:33] And the fact that the biggest pinball company in the world with a marketing team,

[22:38] with a CMO, with an outside PR agency, they have all this stuff with hundreds

[22:45] of employees who should know this industry in and out.

[22:48] The fact that they made that decision makes me feel like they're done.

[22:54] Like they just don't get it.

[22:57] They didn't hire the right people, aka Canada.

[23:00] They don't listen to the community ever.

[23:03] Seth did one sort of survey and that was it.

[23:06] And they really have spent all this money, all this effort,

[23:10] zombie yeti getting this new artist, you know, texting Canadian in the morning

[23:15] because I think it looks like a Skittles bag exploded over half of their games.

[23:19] You know, they don't get it.

[23:21] They really don't get it.

[23:23] And what's sad is it's really easy to get it.

[23:28] If they just slow down, hit pause.

[23:32] If I were them, I would just bring in like 10 people, a couple of content creators,

[23:38] a couple of tournament guys, a couple of collectors, bring in a 10 person focus group

[23:43] and do a reset, like a 2026 reset.

[23:46] The problem is all of their decisions for next year have already been made.

[23:52] They're going to bring back ACDC.

[23:55] We don't need more ACDCs.

[23:56] They just don't get it.

[23:58] Like what is the value in burning 6,000 people that already have an ACDC?

[24:04] You're not going to attract enough newbies.

[24:07] The sales are not great.

[24:10] Their remastered like strategy is not working.

[24:14] And all of their games are looking cheaper than they ever have before.

[24:18] The speaker grills don't look better.

[24:20] Again, like who are they using to focus group any of this stuff?

[24:25] And we're here to help you, Stern.

[24:27] Right? We're here like for five dollars a month.

[24:30] If they had just followed my advice all year, they wouldn't be in this predicament.

[24:34] Instead, they keep hiring from outside pinball and no wonder they're

[24:38] bringing in people who really don't have a passion for pinball.

[24:43] They just took a job and they're answering an assignment.

[24:46] And companies with real passion, their products are running circles around

[24:51] Stern's latest product offerings.

[24:54] Everybody, happy Friday.

[24:56] I'll talk to you soon.

[24:57] Thank you for being a club member.

[24:58] Give your friends out there that are not

[25:00] Canadian club members the gift of Canada this holiday season, because it really is

[25:05] the gift that keeps on giving the whole year that it is, Edward, that it is later.
