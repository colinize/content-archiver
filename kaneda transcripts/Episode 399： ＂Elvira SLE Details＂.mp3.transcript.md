[00:00] Everybody!

[00:01] Don't forget it, say I don't wanna be a love, I don't wanna be a love,

[00:07] Let's say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it,

[00:11] I-

[00:12] Welcome to episode 399 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:16] On this episode we are gonna talk all about El Vira and the top of the line version of

[00:23] the machine.

[00:24] I know the details of what will be in the game and I wanna talk to you, the listener.

[00:29] About one very simple topic and that is how much is the most you would ever spend on

[00:37] a pinball machine and how can you justify the cost of a pinball machine when you're about

[00:44] to spend a lot of money on one.

[00:47] Some people you know they might be priced out at $5,000 that's as much as they'll ever

[00:51] spend, right?

[00:52] A Stern Probe Price.

[00:54] Oh there's GO 75, 9,000, people buy 12,500R collectors editions.

[01:01] John Papaduke was able to sell $16,000 magic girls before anyone even saw a single thing.

[01:10] Big Lebowski's have sold somewhere between 20 and $25,000 when they were still new in

[01:18] box.

[01:19] It doesn't even stop there, right?

[01:21] Kingpins and King Kongs have both had record sales around $50,000.

[01:30] But when you think about why a game would ever get up to being that expensive, it's because

[01:35] of the rarity but it was never manufactured rarity, right?

[01:39] These were just prototype games that never even went in to production.

[01:45] Nobody got burned.

[01:46] There's no negative story.

[01:48] It's just really cool to own a piece of pinball history that organically became valuable

[01:55] without any agenda whatsoever, right?

[02:00] But nowadays the game has changed.

[02:03] Nowadays as I've said on this show, there are many, many wealthy pinball collectors out

[02:08] there.

[02:09] And there's one very simple fact about all the pinball games that are out in the world

[02:13] currently new in box.

[02:15] And that is nobody really caters to the wealthy new in box collector.

[02:21] And those, those waters are being tested more now than ever and a virus about to test

[02:28] those waters all over again.

[02:30] And you're going to get those details in just a little bit.

[02:33] But how much, how much is a stern worth?

[02:36] Could a stern ever be worth as much as a Jersey Jack pinball machine to you?

[02:41] Do you see the value in it?

[02:43] Do you see the effort that goes into it?

[02:46] It's hard to tell, right?

[02:47] When you start to break a machine down, a brand new machine, and you start to ask yourself,

[02:53] do I see the monetary value in this game?

[02:57] It's always been a question that we know these manufacturers do not want you to really think

[03:03] too long and hard about.

[03:05] They want you to go in on the game based on the beautiful artwork, based on the theme,

[03:10] based on the lights and the sounds, but they don't really want you to ask, are the materials

[03:15] there that justify the cost?

[03:18] And you know what they would rather as focus on?

[03:20] Always, is it fun or not?

[03:22] Because it's really convenient to only focus on fun.

[03:26] And I've said it before, almost all games are fun.

[03:29] But beyond that, if you want to start asking people for $10,000, $12,000, $15,000, $16,000,

[03:38] surely they should be able to see where that extra money went beyond the fact that a $5,000

[03:46] Stern Pro is a hell of a lot of fun, okay?

[03:50] So here's the deal.

[03:51] Here's the deal.

[03:52] And we saw this beginning with Beatles and their strategy with manufactured rarity.

[03:57] So I'm here to tell you the news because on Canadian Spinball Podcasts, you don't have

[04:00] to wait for 15 minutes where we talk about our weekends.

[04:04] Here's the deal with Elvira.

[04:07] Elvira is going to come in three trim levels.

[04:11] You're going to have a premium, you're going to have a limited edition, and you're going

[04:15] to have the top of the line version of the game, which is not going to be called a super

[04:20] limited edition.

[04:21] No, it's going to be called a signature limited edition, okay?

[04:28] Now what do you get?

[04:29] What do you get in each model?

[04:30] So I believe the pricing is going to go somewhere like this.

[04:34] I think you're going to have the premium be somewhere around $7,500.

[04:41] I think you're going to have the LE be somewhere around $9,000 to $9,500, okay?

[04:49] And then you're going to have the signature limited edition for the bargain basement price

[04:56] of $15,000, okay?

[05:00] So it's the same price as Batman super limited edition.

[05:04] Now look, I think when you hear that, can you really blame the pricing mechanism on this?

[05:10] They sold every single Batman SLE for $15,000.

[05:16] Now what are the differences?

[05:17] Okay, with Elvira, there are going to be 50 signature limited edition games, so not 80

[05:24] like Batman.

[05:25] So already right off the bat, right?

[05:27] Elvira will have less available.

[05:30] Now remember, if you remember Stern's strategy, there was always supposed to, I believe, I

[05:36] think it was originally Stern said only 30 Batman SLEs.

[05:41] Remember that?

[05:43] It was like for the 30 years of Stern or was it, I get confused.

[05:47] Maybe it was 50 and then they added 30 more.

[05:50] But anyway, I think it was like 50 years for the show, then they added 30 years for Stern

[05:54] being in business or maybe it had to be that way because Batman was around since 1966.

[05:59] All right, so we have 50 Elvira's.

[06:02] I'm not sure if that number 50 correlates to anything in the Elvira narrative or in the

[06:07] Elvira show.

[06:09] But here's the thing, here's where it gets really interesting.

[06:11] So with Batman SLE, remember what you got.

[06:15] You got a completely different cabinet art package from Christopher Franchi.

[06:21] You had that big image of Batman and Robin in the Batmobile and it was like that really

[06:25] nice metallic foil decal that just looks so damn good.

[06:30] And it's almost like embossed on it.

[06:33] It really pops.

[06:34] You got different, you got all three translate art packages that had an exclusive translate

[06:39] art package.

[06:41] You got different images on the back box of the game on the sides.

[06:45] You got that beautiful Batman topper, right, Batman and Robin in the Batmobile.

[06:51] You got the exclusive, I call this exclusive even though you can add it for like,

[06:55] five bucks, you got the bat signal in the topper.

[06:58] But ultimately the coolest thing that everyone who got a Batman SLE got, you know, got the

[07:03] sign Adam West card on the apron, but the coolest thing you got was Adam West did personal

[07:10] lives callouts for every single person who bought a Batman super Ellie.

[07:16] Albeit, it took two years to get those callouts into the game.

[07:20] I think everyone would say those two years were worth the weight where the game is right

[07:24] now.

[07:25] So what do you get in Elvira signature limited edition game?

[07:30] So here's what you get.

[07:31] I'm doing the best to recall what I heard.

[07:35] So you are going to get a signed like card of Elvira sort of like the Batman 66 card.

[07:42] So she will sign a card that will go on the apron.

[07:45] You are also going to get a piece of the Elvira couch that will be signed and authenticated.

[07:55] And I think that piece of the couch will also appear on the apron of the game.

[07:59] All right, not sure like how cool that is, but for you Elvira fans, she wants laid across

[08:05] that couch that's now on your play field apron or your your pinball apron.

[08:11] We're also going to get metallic sort of foil artwork that you see on Batman 66 like

[08:18] that that nicer sort of metallic embossed, you know, decal.

[08:24] But here's the here's the thing.

[08:25] I'm not sure and this hasn't been confirmed yet.

[08:29] I don't know if the art package on the signature series is any different than the art

[08:35] package we're seeing on the LE.

[08:38] And by that, I mean the image of Elvira lying across the cabinet, I believe it's going

[08:44] to be the exact same art, but it will have that foil like appearance.

[08:51] The other thing I forgot to mention on Batman 66 super early, you got the the special armor

[08:57] with the pinstriping, albeit it was very cheap pinstriping that would rub off the machine

[09:04] from the sweat on your hands, but they should have pinstriped it with real paint, but it

[09:08] was still different than the LE with Elvira, you're also going to get like the the sparkly

[09:14] red sort of like blood dripping armor that's going to be on the signature series of the

[09:20] game.

[09:21] Okay, so those are the so that's the main thing.

[09:25] So here's the things you don't get right now.

[09:28] I'm hearing there's no topper associated with the game.

[09:32] So $15,000 and you don't get a topper.

[09:36] $15,000 and the artwork on the cabinet might be the same exact artwork on the game that

[09:44] cost $5,000 less.

[09:48] There will not be different artwork on the play field art itself.

[09:53] I don't think any I don't know anyone even wants to talk about getting an extra layer

[09:58] of clear code anymore either like that's like a non factor.

[10:03] So what do I think about this?

[10:05] Is this a cash grab?

[10:07] Is this the ultimate cash grab?

[10:08] Are we back once again to what Stern pulled with you know the beetles, the diamond addition

[10:15] and the platinum addition and where there's like really nothing different about the game,

[10:20] whatsoever.

[10:21] Even the armor almost looked exactly the same.

[10:25] All that was really different, there was some different artwork at least they gave you

[10:29] that but all that was really different is just a little plaque.

[10:33] And yet we know that they tried to sell diamond additions for $12,500 more than the $12,500

[10:43] you know platinum additions and that's crazy.

[10:47] So that's the question I have on this podcast is just how much would you spend on a game

[10:53] and what do you want to see in that game to justify the cost.

[11:00] And if you're me I don't think that just being 50 of something is enough.

[11:05] I do think there needs to be much more in a game if the additional price of that game

[11:12] you know I think about it like this.

[11:14] If I could buy an Alvira Ellie and a Jurassic Park pro for the price of an Alvira signature

[11:24] addition, why would I do that?

[11:27] Like what is in the signature addition that actually cost money to do?

[11:33] That's the price of an entire Jurassic Pro Pimball machine.

[11:38] There's no different mechanisms.

[11:41] There's no unique code in the game.

[11:43] There's nothing about the gameplay experience that's any different.

[11:47] It gets even scarier when you think about the difference between the signature addition

[11:51] for 15,000 and the premium version of the game right.

[11:56] And the same was true with Batman.

[11:58] It's the same exact gameplay experience for $7,500 less money.

[12:05] I mean that is ludicrous.

[12:08] So I guess the question I have is this.

[12:11] I know this is coming.

[12:13] We're going to hear it this week.

[12:14] And I think the plan was this.

[12:15] I think I stated on an earlier show.

[12:18] The plan was to have Alvira sell these games on her fan page and charge that kind of

[12:26] money for it.

[12:27] It reminds me very eerily of how...

[12:32] Remember Jean Simmons, there was that special kiss edition of Kissle Lee that the bands sold

[12:37] through their site for some exorbitant amounts of money more than the normal Kissle Lee.

[12:43] And it barely had anything on it.

[12:45] I think it just had all the kiss members signed a piece of paper on the apron and they

[12:51] wanted thousands more for the game.

[12:55] That kind of feels like what we're getting here.

[12:57] And I kind of understand why Stern probably wanted Cassandra to sell this through Alvira's

[13:03] shop on her page.

[13:06] But I heard that she didn't want to have to deal with selling an item like this.

[13:12] So I believe they were punted back to distributors to be the ones who are handling the sale of

[13:17] the game.

[13:18] And so from what I'm hearing is that each distributor at Stern is going to get a few of these.

[13:23] So like two to three per distributor, maybe some of the big ones get more.

[13:28] But that's what I'm hearing.

[13:29] Now knowing what you know, do you think this game is going to sell out immediately?

[13:36] And I talk to some people and they're like absolutely yes.

[13:39] And even me, man, even me.

[13:40] You know me, I would love to put a super Ellie next to my Batman super Ellie kind of

[13:46] interesting that it's not a super Ellie.

[13:48] It's a signature Ellie just because it's got signatures on it.

[13:52] I don't know.

[13:53] I would rather Stern continue and be consistent on these $15,000 pins.

[13:59] Like they should be super limited editions because they are super and they're limited

[14:04] and their editions.

[14:05] I don't know why they're changing the naming of this like super high end game to signature

[14:10] series, but it is what it is.

[14:12] Okay.

[14:13] Now look, I would love to have one.

[14:15] But here's what I wasn't going to do.

[14:18] And to get one, you know, you could give it a deposit.

[14:21] They're non-refundable deposits and that's I get that.

[14:24] You know distributors can't have people flipping them.

[14:27] They need to make sure they lock in orders.

[14:29] But I just for the life of me, if it looks just like an Ellie, right?

[14:35] If the artwork is the same and it looks just like an Ellie, I don't consider foil decals

[14:44] versus flat decals to be a big enough a difference, a big enough a difference to justify that

[14:51] much more.

[14:52] And so I guess the only target for this kind of game is someone who is just such a diehard

[15:00] Elvira fan that they're willing to overlook the lack of value in this edition and just

[15:08] want the most expensive version of the game.

[15:11] Now look, it's unclear if Cassandra is going to do personalized callouts for all 50 buyers.

[15:17] So I'm looking to see if Stern does something like that this time around because they already

[15:22] set the precedents for that with Adam West doing the personalized callouts in Batman.

[15:28] But I was not told that that is on the features matrix right now, but here's the thing.

[15:33] They are still figuring out the features matrix.

[15:36] The good news is we're going to get this revealed this week.

[15:40] It's happening this week.

[15:41] So we will know everything you can get for your $15,000.

[15:45] But I just couldn't see the value.

[15:48] And you know, I just I don't know how anyone could, right?

[15:54] And I'm not saying this to sort of make fun of Stern or their marketing approach because

[16:00] here's a good news is like nobody has to buy this game.

[16:03] And I do think that here's the reality.

[16:06] Here's how I look at it.

[16:07] Like if I'm just talking to you off the record, I don't think anyone who buys the most high

[16:12] end version of a game should ever be laughed at.

[16:16] Right?

[16:17] And I think remember when those those kiss special editions were shown like everyone was

[16:20] like you'd be an idiot to buy this.

[16:23] But I think if you're going to spend $15,000 on a pinball machine, nobody should point

[16:29] their finger at you and laugh at you.

[16:31] You know, when you buy a Dodge demon, nobody who owns a hellcat is like, well, why do you

[16:36] pay more?

[16:37] I don't see why.

[16:38] It's so crystal clear the value you get when you go up market within the auto world.

[16:45] And in the pinball world, it's not the same.

[16:48] I do feel like a lot of these cosmetic differences are so cheap to do for stern.

[16:55] And yet the cost to the customer is so expensive.

[17:00] And so I for those reasons, I think when this thing is revealed and if those are the things

[17:06] you get for the money, I think people are going to stay away from it.

[17:10] I do.

[17:11] I think people are just going to go get an Ellie.

[17:13] There's going to be 400 Ellie's.

[17:15] I would go grab an Ellie and I would just enjoy the game.

[17:20] I would enjoy the game knowing that I'm playing the exact same game as someone who's paying

[17:25] a lot more money for it.

[17:27] And because we know you can go get like personalized like metallic flake armor from people like pinball

[17:33] refinery for hardly anything.

[17:36] And it doesn't cost much money to make these games look special.

[17:41] And if stern doesn't give you different, here's the things I want you guys to look at

[17:45] when they reveal this game.

[17:47] If they don't give you different artwork on each version of this game, they're just

[17:52] getting lazy now because almost every single stern release I've seen recently, almost

[17:59] all of them, right?

[18:00] They all come with different art packages.

[18:02] It's all different.

[18:04] Like what's on the cabinet, what's on the translate, what's on the side of the back box.

[18:09] You can't tell me if I'm going to spend $15,000 on Elvira signatures limited edition that

[18:17] it doesn't have an exclusive art package.

[18:22] Like I don't, I don't even care.

[18:23] You know what they're going to do?

[18:24] They'll be like, well, it's glass.

[18:25] Well, so what?

[18:26] So what?

[18:27] It doesn't cost much to do different art packages.

[18:31] It's just lazy.

[18:33] And so that's what I'm hearing is about to happen this week.

[18:36] It's always funny when these super high end versions get revealed because they really

[18:41] are just targeting the super wealthy collector.

[18:44] And that wealthy collector, it's like they want it.

[18:47] They want it so bad.

[18:50] But nobody again, nobody wants to buy the most expensive thing and then and be laughed at

[18:54] by the community because people are just going to be like, you're a sucker.

[18:57] If you spend this much money and that's all you get.

[19:01] So curious to see how it all pans out.

[19:03] Now here's the other thing.

[19:04] Here's the other thing.

[19:06] This game looks really fun.

[19:08] This game looks awesome to shoot.

[19:10] I'm keep hearing that the way Lyman is working on this game, it's going to be like an integration

[19:18] between what's on the play field and what's on the screen in a way that's never really

[19:22] been done before.

[19:23] But it's just going to be so seamless.

[19:24] Now, the other part is this.

[19:27] Do not think that Lyman Sheets has been working on this game for two, three years simply

[19:32] because Dennis Norman designed this game two, three years ago and it's been sitting at

[19:37] Stern.

[19:38] This game will launch with code that is nowhere near complete.

[19:44] It will not be Batman 66 laughably, Baron.

[19:48] But it also will be a game that Lyman Sheets will be working on over the next year to finish

[19:55] the same way he did with Batman 66, which again leads me to just say that.

[20:02] To spend $15,000 on an incomplete game in 2019, I just wouldn't do it.

[20:12] Because here's the other thing.

[20:14] Here's the other thing is like Stern's got so much coming.

[20:16] Remember, this is not even a cornerstone title.

[20:20] We are going to see a new Stern cornerstone title in November.

[20:25] If you just wait, there's going to be a new game in November and gives what?

[20:29] There's going to be even a new game next year and on and on and on.

[20:33] Why not wait until this game is done before you plunk down that kind of money?

[20:39] Look, I just think it's interesting that we're going to get another high, high end game.

[20:45] What will this do for the market?

[20:47] We'll really make an impact.

[20:49] I don't think so.

[20:50] I think people are going to laugh at the $15,000 version.

[20:52] For me, the real version that's going to have an impact is the limited edition version

[20:57] at around like $9,500 bucks.

[20:59] I think those are going to sell and I think they're going to sell well.

[21:02] Especially if they look close enough to the SLEs, I think people are going to be in on them.

[21:07] I think those 400 are going to move quickly.

[21:10] I do.

[21:12] What do I think the impact that will have on Jersey Jack?

[21:16] I think that Jersey Jack pinball needs to get those collectors additions out.

[21:21] I mean this.

[21:22] It's not just Jurassic Park.

[21:25] It's now Elvira.

[21:26] It's now a new cornerstone from them is coming in November.

[21:31] Stern is doing something right now that I think everyone needs to wake up and realize.

[21:35] They're just clobbering.

[21:37] Clobbering.

[21:38] The competition with cadence.

[21:41] It's not going to stop.

[21:43] I do feel like Stern has a two to three to five year plan to just put out as much as they

[21:48] can because then it's all going to go away.

[21:51] It's all going to die.

[21:52] And again, it's not like in a year or maybe two, maybe three.

[21:56] But this new model of theirs, how does another company, how do you stop the barrage that

[22:04] is coming at you that is Stern pinball?

[22:07] How do you plan for this?

[22:09] How do you, you know, you got to make better games, but how do you then compete with them

[22:14] on manufacturing?

[22:16] How do you compete with them on price?

[22:18] How do you compete with them on theme?

[22:20] How do you beat them at their game?

[22:23] Right?

[22:24] They've got manufacturing down pat.

[22:26] They've got the best relationships probably in the industry to secure licenses.

[22:30] You know, people, you know, you think it's, if you've been, if Stern's been securing licenses

[22:35] with, with a lot of these license holders, you think they're going to go and like,

[22:38] ink a deal with like deep route or ink a deal with American pinball, probably not.

[22:43] Their, their next phone call is probably going to be to Stern.

[22:46] Hey, you've been doing this with us for this many years.

[22:49] Another pinball company came to us and like, would you like to put in a bid?

[22:53] You know, I don't know.

[22:54] I think a lot of that stuff goes on.

[22:56] So it's, it's really exciting because I, I, I, I mean, this when I say this, the things

[23:03] I hear from people who know what's coming down the pipeline and I know this is, it's always

[23:10] fun to speculate.

[23:12] It, it just sounds like it's going to be an awesome next year and, and the end of this

[23:16] year for Stern pinball.

[23:18] Now what does that mean for everybody else?

[23:20] Just means like they're raising the bar.

[23:22] They are raising the bar and I do think you're going to see stuff come from Stern that,

[23:27] uh, is stuff that we've been wanting to see.

[23:30] And that's a good thing because here's the thing.

[23:31] The games are going to be available.

[23:33] What I do think they still can't understand is how to really give you value for the, for

[23:39] the price.

[23:40] I, I still think they're, they're sort of cash grab in us.

[23:43] I think their hood winking us.

[23:45] I think they're creating manufactured scarcity with these like signature, serious addition.

[23:49] So, Vier is like broad, it's signed and we threw it in the coin box and that's another

[23:53] five grand and here's a piece of the couch.

[23:55] I mean, come on, like what is this crap?

[23:58] Like, put a new mechanism in it.

[24:00] You know, have the haunted house that's in the game be painted differently.

[24:03] Like do a different sculpt for those 50 people.

[24:05] Something that just feels radically different than what everyone else is getting.

[24:10] That's what you deserve for that much money.

[24:13] But they're not doing that.

[24:14] I mean, again, I feel like it's going to be another cash grab, cut corner kind of like

[24:18] super version of a game.

[24:20] And I think you guys are, are wise enough now to see right through it.

[24:24] I do.

[24:25] I don't think they're going to sell out if that's what we get now.

[24:27] If they surprise us and add a ton of different stuff to the feature matrix, then cool.

[24:32] But the stuff needs to be in the game.

[24:35] The stuff needs to change the gameplay experience.

[24:38] Like you want to have a game in which only if you're playing one of those 50 machines,

[24:44] can you, you know, experience X, Y or Z.

[24:48] That's the only reason that would justify the cost.

[24:51] Like at least on Batman, you can hear Batman say Chris get to the bat phone.

[24:57] Only in front of my machine can you hear that.

[25:00] That's super cool.

[25:01] I mean, is that worth it?

[25:02] No, but it's something, at least something I can point at and say, this is why I've got

[25:07] this version.

[25:09] I think they aren't, doesn't do it.

[25:12] You know, they don't even have a topper.

[25:14] How can you not give people a freaking topper for $15,000?

[25:17] Oh, there's at least Jersey Jack gives you awesome toppers or used to with the pirates

[25:22] one.

[25:23] So Stern will see.

[25:24] I think it's going to be a funny week, man.

[25:26] It's going to be a funny week as this drops and we hear everyone talking about it.

[25:31] But you heard it here first on Canadian Spinball podcast.

[25:34] That's what you can expect from Elvira's signature series.

[25:39] I think it's going to make a lot of people respond and react.

[25:43] And please take this information now to Pinside.

[25:45] Don't give Canadian credit and all you people on Facebook and whatnot who say, you know,

[25:53] I'm not looking out for you.

[25:54] I am looking out for you.

[25:55] I'm not a show for Stern.

[25:57] I mean, come on.

[25:58] Nobody from Stern will come on this show.

[26:00] I've told it like it is.

[26:01] I still think the art package on Elvira leaves a lot to be desired.

[26:06] I mean, where is Elvira on that play field?

[26:09] Come on.

[26:10] I'm sure Lyman's going to do a great job.

[26:12] She's going to be all over the LCD.

[26:15] And that's probably why she's not on the play field.

[26:17] But come on.

[26:18] I want to see more Elvira.

[26:20] But everyone, have a great night.

[26:21] We'll be back with more shows.

[26:23] We might be back tomorrow whenever the news breaks and we get the official details.

[26:28] We will of course be back to discuss it.

[26:30] But there you go.

[26:31] $15,000 for some decals and a piece of a couch.

[26:36] Now, how great does getting 390, like, 9 episodes of Canadian Spinball Podcast for free

[26:45] sound right about now?

[26:47] Good night, everybody.
