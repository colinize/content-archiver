[00:00] Welcome to episode 155 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:18] We're back in the saddle again to talk about Pimball News, what's going on in the hobby,

[00:23] what's going on with these manufacturers.

[00:26] And I believe every Pimball podcast out there had a deviate from their normal programming

[00:32] to cover the unfortunate incident of Mr. John Trudeau.

[00:37] We're not going to go into that again.

[00:39] We're going to, of course, wait for more details to surface before we cover this.

[00:43] I want to say this.

[00:44] I got a lot of emails from people out there saying that they felt this podcast handle the

[00:49] topic responsibly, intelligently and maturedly.

[00:55] And I think most of us all fall on the same page.

[00:59] We are all disgusted by the news.

[01:01] We did not expect to see this coming.

[01:03] It is bad for the hobby, but it's also something that shouldn't be swept under the carpet.

[01:08] It's something that you should allow people to discuss, and it's not just going to go

[01:12] away.

[01:13] I think we all felt that Steve Richie's comments were ill, conceived.

[01:18] I'm not quite sure what he meant by his comments, but he definitely didn't say something that

[01:25] made much sense considering all that went down.

[01:28] I think every day that goes by that stern remains silent on the topic is a little bit concerning

[01:34] to me because I work in PR.

[01:37] And whenever a company has a crisis like this, it doesn't matter where you are.

[01:41] It doesn't matter if the CEO is on vacation in Australia.

[01:45] It doesn't matter if people are scattered.

[01:47] This is the kind of crisis that people need to huddle together, come up with a response,

[01:53] and make that response immediately or as fast as possible.

[01:57] Now I think the two big questions I have are, is John Tirtos suspended by Stern Pimball?

[02:04] And what is the status of John's game with Stern Pimball?

[02:08] And I really think Stern needs to comment sooner than later on that status.

[02:13] And I know they care a lot.

[02:16] And I've talked to people over at Stern, and this is really rocking their world.

[02:21] I know it's rocking people like Zambi Yeti's world.

[02:24] Guy can't catch a break.

[02:26] I mean, he works with J-Pop and that turns Sour.

[02:29] And now he's working with John Tirtos and look at this.

[02:32] I know it's really rocking a lot of these people to the core.

[02:35] And I really keep reminding people that the majority of people in this hobby,

[02:41] the majority of what happens in Pimball is really good.

[02:45] And we shouldn't let this singular, bad, super bad incident spoil people's

[02:51] enjoyment in the hobby.

[02:53] That being said, there's going to be a period where a lot of us are going to be bummed out.

[02:57] There's going to be a period where a lot of us might question whether or not we want to stay in the Pimball hobby.

[03:02] I'm not going to quit the podcast over John Tirtos actions.

[03:05] It's not going to happen.

[03:06] And I'm not going to quit the podcast because I'm disgusted by some of the Pimball hobbyists

[03:11] who are trying to act like there's a gray area here with child pornography, because there's just not.

[03:17] All right.

[03:18] OK, let's move on and talk about some other Pimball news on this episode of Pimball Podcast.

[03:23] We really want to start.

[03:24] I want to start with Dutch Pimball because there is a new Dutch Pimball update.

[03:30] And I said I'd read their updates as they gave them.

[03:34] And I know these guys have been on vacation.

[03:37] And I was able to actually go find where they were vacationing.

[03:41] And you know, burying you off their close friends,

[03:44] they're really going to turn this around, right?

[03:46] We feel really confident.

[03:47] And I have to say after finding them on vacation and putting my ear to the door where they were,

[03:53] I'm so much more confident they're going to get this ship on the right course.

[03:59] And I want to just play for you what I heard as I listen through the door of

[04:03] burying Yop on their vacation.

[04:05] I think this will give a lot of you confidence that you're going to get your big

[04:09] Lebowski sometime soon.

[04:10] So here's what I heard.

[04:12] Ernie.

[04:14] Hey, what are you doing with those cookies in bed?

[04:21] Well, cookies, well, I was just hungry, Bert, so I thought I'd have a few cookies before I went to sleep.

[04:25] Ernie, don't eat those cookies while you're in your bed, huh?

[04:29] Why not, Bert?

[04:30] Because you get crumbs in the sheets.

[04:33] That's why.

[04:34] She, Bert, I get crumbs in the sheets?

[04:36] Yeah, Ernie, and if there are crumbs in the sheets, they'll get in your pajamas.

[04:40] Oh, crumbs in my pajamas, Bert?

[04:42] Yeah, Ernie, and if you get crumbs in your pajamas, they'll make you itch, you know?

[04:46] I don't like the itch, Bert.

[04:47] No, and if you itch, you won't be able to sleep, Ernie, so don't do it, okay?

[04:51] Well, there you have it.

[04:52] I mean, maybe the whole reason why the big Lebowski's taken so long to come out,

[04:57] and these guys to figure their stuff out, is they just have crumbs in their pajamas?

[05:01] They've got crumbs in their pajamas.

[05:03] And, you know, look, these guys continue to make me laugh.

[05:06] Now, let me read their update, though.

[05:07] They actually had an update this week, and it says, here we go.

[05:12] It goes, holiday season is over, so here you have another update of the big Lebowski Pimball

[05:18] production.

[05:19] Sorry that we are late.

[05:20] We were supposed to send it to you last Friday.

[05:23] We are collecting parts to produce the engineering samples, and we're busy developing the new PCBs.

[05:30] Instead of a big middle main board, we will now have smaller boards with their own functions.

[05:36] An Iow board, an LED Iow board with separate LED boards, separate driver boards, and some

[05:42] other small boards with their own specific tasks.

[05:46] This new system will make the new games even more reliable, and will be even easier to

[05:52] service and to replace a board that has a defect.

[05:55] We also booked our flights to Chicago.

[05:57] We really will visit Expo from Friday till Sunday.

[06:01] We'll be spending a lot of time at the booth of CoinTaker, where you can play the big Lebowski.

[06:06] We will also do a seminar.

[06:10] Of course, we will be available to meet you and answer your questions during the show.

[06:15] The Dutch Pimball Seminar is scheduled on Friday at 6 p.m.

[06:18] Chicago Expo is from Wednesday, October 11th until Sunday, October 15th.

[06:24] For more info, please click on the Pimball Expo website.

[06:28] All right, so all you have to know is this.

[06:31] These guys rocked into Pimball Expo in 2014, like rock stars, making fun of Gary Stern,

[06:39] having all these booth babes, running out the penthouse.

[06:43] Three years later, they're going to come back to Expo with the same exact game that they

[06:48] hopefully have re-engineered to make it more reliable and easier to service.

[06:52] I mean, what a joke.

[06:54] Can we just finally call these guys a joke?

[06:58] Look, I've asked them on the podcast.

[07:00] I've asked them to talk.

[07:01] But it's a joke.

[07:03] It's a joke.

[07:03] I can't even accurately talk about them anymore because they're always putting the cart

[07:13] in the head of the horse.

[07:14] So do we really believe that these guys are going to have a fully working re-engineered

[07:18] redesign Big Lebowski in the next six weeks?

[07:20] Is that going to happen?

[07:22] Is that even feasible?

[07:24] Where's the money coming from to re-engineer this whole game and build all these new boards?

[07:28] And build all these new parts.

[07:29] They're doing all this while they're not refunding anyone their money.

[07:32] And I know every single person that I've spoken to who's in on the Big Lebowski is just fed up

[07:37] and tired of these guys.

[07:39] I don't think they should come to Chicago Expo.

[07:42] I'll tell you why.

[07:43] Because it costs money.

[07:45] It costs money to come all the way from where they are in the Netherlands to load up machines,

[07:51] to ship them to America, to ship them to Chicago, to ship themselves to Chicago on airplane ticket.

[07:58] All that costs money.

[07:59] And I don't just mean like $1,000 or $2 to do all of that, to book hotel rooms, to book flights.

[08:06] Maybe costs like $5,000, $8,000, maybe more.

[08:10] That's the price of someone's game who wants their money back.

[08:13] And there's no point.

[08:15] There's absolutely no point in these guys going to Expo again, having another seminar again

[08:23] where they make more excuses again about the status of the Big Lebowski production.

[08:29] These clowns need to stop.

[08:31] They need to stop thinking that we want to see their faces at seminars,

[08:35] that we want to hear from them again.

[08:37] There's only one thing they need to do.

[08:38] They need to finish the production of the Big Lebowski,

[08:41] and they need to put it in a box, and they need to get it to customers who paid for their machines.

[08:47] And they need to say, look, we've got a new contract manufacturer,

[08:51] things are working out, the games are now on the line,

[08:54] and this is round two, or round three, whatever you want to call it.

[08:57] I don't need to hear another seminar from these guys.

[08:59] I don't want to see their faces.

[09:01] If I was Pimball Expo, I wouldn't invite them to the show.

[09:04] If I was CoinTaker, I wouldn't want them in your booth.

[09:07] Why would you want these clowns in your booth, CoinTaker?

[09:10] And I'm good friends with Chris and his wife,

[09:13] and I don't think they should allow these clowns in their booth.

[09:16] Because at the end of the day,

[09:18] the last time these guys went to a show,

[09:20] they talked all about their bride of Pimbot for $12,500,

[09:24] and they blamed ARA for all this stuff.

[09:27] And they look, it's been over a year,

[09:31] since they lied to everybody about the board issues,

[09:34] and they've yet to accomplish a remake of the game

[09:37] in a full fiscal year.

[09:40] And that's an entire year of no income coming in,

[09:43] people's refunds being held.

[09:45] So look, I don't know about how you feel,

[09:47] but I'm just tired of these guys, and they're shenanigans,

[09:50] and they're constant desire to talk,

[09:53] but actually produce very little action.

[09:55] So, burying up, I've invited you on the show.

[09:57] You've said no multiple times.

[10:00] So this is what you get.

[10:01] You're gonna get the thing you don't want to hear.

[10:04] And this is what you need to do.

[10:06] Stay home. Stay home from Expo.

[10:09] Nobody wants to see you anymore.

[10:11] And everyone can play the Big Lebowski.

[10:12] They've played it for years.

[10:13] It's not new.

[10:15] We don't want to hear your updates.

[10:17] We want the only update to be that the games are shipping.

[10:21] Until that point, stop spending people's money

[10:25] that's not yours.

[10:26] Stop going on vacation, and stop traveling to Chicago,

[10:30] all the way from the Netherlands to talk.

[10:32] All right?

[10:33] I already know what's gonna go down.

[10:35] Like Yop's gonna grab the mic,

[10:37] and give all these excuses why they didn't work it out with ARA,

[10:41] and talk all about the new contract manufacturer,

[10:44] and BS.

[10:47] He should not be allowed, which is not allowed in the room.

[10:50] So that's my take on Dutch Pimball,

[10:53] and the ridiculous thing they're doing,

[10:56] which is coming back to Expo three years later

[10:58] while they're not refunding people's money,

[11:01] and what are we doing?

[11:02] A drum up new excitement for this game?

[11:03] No one's excited.

[11:05] No one's excited.

[11:06] People just either want you to go away or ship games.

[11:08] They don't want anything else from you.

[11:10] Those are the only two things you should be doing.

[11:12] All right, while we're talking about Pimball's

[11:14] best manufacturers, let's talk about Skip B for a minute.

[11:17] So the Skip B thread has been blowing up a little bit,

[11:19] and I have to be honest.

[11:21] It's always hard to follow this thread,

[11:23] because there's audio files from the court,

[11:26] people listening to them, people transcribing them.

[11:28] But here's what I could take from this whole thing.

[11:30] So right now, it sounds like virtual PIN

[11:33] is in court as well, saying that,

[11:37] you know, PIN side and Keith,

[11:40] and this whole thing has hurt their business.

[11:42] And for those of you who don't remember,

[11:44] Kevin gave virtual PIN, I believe $100,000

[11:47] to make cabinets for Predator.

[11:49] That money, where is it?

[11:51] Nobody knows.

[11:51] The cabinets were never delivered,

[11:54] and they seemingly kept the money,

[11:56] and that money should have gone back to customers.

[11:58] So, but here's the part that's kind of getting messed up,

[12:01] and people are starting to notice this,

[12:04] is that the judge seems to be really lenient

[12:07] with the Coolix.

[12:08] At first, it felt like the judge was gonna be hard on them,

[12:12] bring the hammer down, take no excuses,

[12:15] but it's almost like there's this weird flirtatious,

[12:19] is that the right word between Coolix mom and the judge?

[12:23] And it's just like he's being more and more lenient on them.

[12:26] So the tide seems to be shifting in this case,

[12:29] and I think people are starting to sense that,

[12:32] this judge is not gonna throw the book at them,

[12:35] and I think one of the big issues is this,

[12:37] and this is something that I was always curious about,

[12:40] as this case was going on,

[12:42] because when you're a lawyer,

[12:43] and you're involved in a case,

[12:45] you're not supposed to discuss this case with anybody,

[12:48] but Keith has been going on Pinside frequently,

[12:53] and discussing the case with the community,

[12:57] and that has led the defendants,

[13:02] it's given them ammunition to point at that,

[13:04] and say, look what this guy's doing,

[13:06] he's hurting our reputation, he's slandering us,

[13:09] he's going on this website, Pinside,

[13:11] and he's disclosing information about the case,

[13:14] and it's actually hurt the case.

[13:16] And I don't know, maybe the judge is looking at Keith's behavior,

[13:20] and kind of siding with the Coolix now,

[13:22] and thinking he's just got this hot shot lawyer

[13:25] that cares more about riling up the mob on Pinside,

[13:30] versus doing the proper protocol,

[13:32] which is to not talk about the case.

[13:34] So, look, this whole thing is never going to end well.

[13:40] There's not going to be any money

[13:41] that's going to move to other people

[13:43] who got burned by Kevin.

[13:45] And all around, I think this story

[13:49] is just going to fizzle out one day,

[13:52] but the fact that the judge seems to be more and more lenient

[13:57] is not good, it's not good, and it's dragging on,

[14:00] and maybe Keith didn't act very professionally,

[14:03] and that's something that a lot of you just have to maybe accept now,

[14:06] because you wanted answers, he gave you answers,

[14:09] and that might now have just hurt your ability

[14:11] to sort of prosecute Kevin to the fall,

[14:14] to the extent of the law.

[14:16] All right, here's an interesting question.

[14:19] If I give you money right now,

[14:21] and I say, buy the best pinball machine

[14:25] that features aliens in it, or on it,

[14:29] or is alien themed,

[14:31] which is the game to get?

[14:34] Okay, now it's not a trick question.

[14:35] There's two machines right now that feature aliens predominantly in the game,

[14:41] and that is alien, the highway pinball game,

[14:44] and attack from Mars remake.

[14:48] But are those Martians or aliens?

[14:49] Does it matter?

[14:50] Can we just say they're the same thing?

[14:51] Okay, let's just agree that they're the same exact creatures.

[14:56] I want you guys to do one thing.

[14:58] If you go into the alien thread,

[15:00] and you read what's going on with those buyers and those pre-order people,

[15:05] and then go into the attack from Mars remake thread,

[15:09] and read what's going on in that thread, it is really amazing.

[15:13] It is really amazing.

[15:13] It is a tale of two aliens, a tale of two experiences.

[15:19] One of them is filled with nothing but joy and elation,

[15:24] and one of them is filled with nothing but frustration and anger.

[15:29] Okay?

[15:29] And pinball.

[15:31] Pinball should always bring you joy.

[15:34] It should bring you elation.

[15:35] It's a toy.

[15:36] It should be fun.

[15:37] And I have to say, Chicago Gaming and PPS,

[15:40] they've absolutely knocked it out of the park with attack from Mars remake.

[15:45] I love going into that thread and seeing people open up their games,

[15:48] putting their games out amongst their collections,

[15:51] and basically saying, these guys built a tank.

[15:55] The game is awesome.

[15:56] The game looks great.

[15:58] They give you that incredible topper, all of it for $8,000.

[16:02] And the game itself was always a classic.

[16:04] It was always a fun game.

[16:05] I mean, it was difficult to find one in perfect condition,

[16:08] and now you can go get a perfect condition, upgraded version

[16:14] of one of the greatest pinball machines of all time with no hassle.

[16:17] And they're going to make 1,000 LEDs.

[16:19] So if you want an LED, I believe they're still available.

[16:22] You can go get one.

[16:24] And I have nothing but good things to say about the experience.

[16:27] People are having with attack from Mars remake.

[16:30] So that's how it should be.

[16:32] That's how pinball buying should be,

[16:35] and that's how a pinball game should be.

[16:37] Now on the other side of the coin is the never-ending debacle

[16:42] known as highway pinball.

[16:44] And I can't believe it when I read this thread,

[16:46] and I saw something that happened recently,

[16:48] and I really, really, really want these new investors

[16:52] to have a chance.

[16:53] But every time I read what they're doing,

[16:56] it reminds me that they don't really have a plan

[17:00] and their new strategy.

[17:01] It just makes no sense to me.

[17:03] So here's the reality.

[17:05] If you went in on an alien Ellie,

[17:08] if you were one of the early adopters

[17:10] who put money down with Andrew Highway

[17:12] to buy the Ellie game, as he described it, you're fucked.

[17:17] OK, just stand in front of a mirror and say, I'm fucked.

[17:21] And here's why you're fucked.

[17:22] We don't normally curse as much,

[17:23] because there is no alien Ellie.

[17:25] I've been saying it for years now.

[17:29] Andrew Highway had no real plan on how

[17:32] to make something limited edition.

[17:34] And I think because he really doesn't understand business,

[17:38] because how hard is it to understand how to sell

[17:41] and generate hype for an Ellie?

[17:44] I mean, that's all Stern Pinball does.

[17:45] You just make a version called an Ellie,

[17:48] and there's one version of it, and you make a few things

[17:51] different, and people will buy it.

[17:52] The fact that alien Ellie never even sold out

[17:55] is indicative of how bad his approach

[17:58] to making an Ellie game was.

[18:00] But here's the thing.

[18:02] If you look at the elements that went into the Ellie,

[18:05] it's all gone.

[18:05] So I want to read something from Pennside user, Hoki Poke.

[18:08] He says, so they dumped the fiber optic ramps

[18:11] and gloss cabinets for Ellie pre-orders,

[18:14] and give you exclusive hand-drawn backlash artwork that

[18:18] is useless if you install the 27-inch monitor.

[18:21] Those aren't great selling points for the Ellie.

[18:24] The Beacons and inner side blades

[18:26] can be added to a standard.

[18:28] You really want to pay all that extra money for drawn cab art,

[18:31] colored trim, doesn't add up, especially

[18:34] at the higher prices for new orders.

[18:37] They should do what's fair and give pre-ordering Ellie

[18:40] customers a free 27-inch back box LCD in exchange

[18:44] for the lost features.

[18:46] But I think it's more likely that you'll

[18:47] be given a discount on a future highway title instead.

[18:52] The lack of specifics at this point

[18:53] is just another red flag.

[18:55] The fact that all refunds have not been issued is maddening.

[19:00] Well, I think Hoki Poke hit the nail on the head there.

[19:04] I love this hobby.

[19:04] I'm like, I'm like giving credit to some guy named Hoki Poke.

[19:08] But the reality is this.

[19:09] Yeah.

[19:10] So the last part of his statement,

[19:12] they haven't refunded everyone's money.

[19:15] Think about that.

[19:16] These guys have been in business now for months.

[19:19] Was it in four months now?

[19:20] Since they took over the reins of highway pinball,

[19:23] promising everyone would get their refunds.

[19:25] And still, not everyone has been made whole.

[19:27] I think right there, you could stop and say, that's total BS.

[19:31] That is total BS.

[19:34] What's taking so long?

[19:36] And so here's the other thing that they're doing.

[19:38] And this is the other like, egregious thing.

[19:41] That just shows that these guys clearly,

[19:43] they're trying to create that balance between giving people

[19:47] their money back, raising the prices

[19:50] on the game now, trying to honor the price

[19:53] that Andrew highway established,

[19:56] and then running the numbers.

[19:57] And so here's the problem.

[20:01] I want to walk you guys through a scenario.

[20:03] If I went in on an Ellie, early on with Andrew,

[20:06] and I got the price of the Ellie,

[20:09] and it was supposed to have the fiber optic.

[20:11] It was supposed to have this.

[20:12] It was supposed to have that.

[20:13] And then you remove those items.

[20:15] So then really, I would just have got

[20:18] a standard edition alien.

[20:20] So if I was in originally on an Ellie,

[20:23] and I see now they've removed all the things I want it,

[20:26] they won't sell you the standard

[20:29] at the original standard price.

[20:31] You now have to buy the standard

[20:33] at the increased price of the standard.

[20:36] So you're screwed there.

[20:39] So the whole thing sucks.

[20:41] It sucks for the Ellie buyers.

[20:43] It sucks for people that, you know,

[20:45] I want to just get a standard now,

[20:47] but not pay the new standard price.

[20:49] It sucks for people who are realized

[20:51] that the Ellie artwork isn't anything.

[20:53] It sucks for people that really want

[20:54] at the fiber optic ramps.

[20:57] Everything kind of sucks.

[20:58] Everything kind of sucks.

[20:59] And these guys, I think, are realizing that,

[21:02] you know what we'll do is we'll do whatever we want here,

[21:04] because people are just going to be happy

[21:06] to get something over nothing.

[21:08] And so I think alien people are being rigged over the coals.

[21:12] And as I said from the very get-go,

[21:14] get your money back.

[21:15] Everybody, get your money back.

[21:17] There is no Ellie.

[21:19] The only thing you should get is an alien standard

[21:22] when these guys are shipping games.

[21:24] And you shouldn't have to deal with these dang bats

[21:26] over there in the UK.

[21:27] Just go to CoinTaker when he has like 50 games in boxes

[21:31] and you can go get one.

[21:33] I wouldn't eat, why would anyone lock their money up

[21:36] or keep their money with these guys?

[21:38] This whole thing is a joke.

[21:41] The hype around alien is a joke.

[21:43] It's over.

[21:44] They're going to sell a few hundred games

[21:46] because the theme is so powerful.

[21:48] If Stern made Alien, they would sell a few thousand.

[21:50] We all know this.

[21:52] This isn't the alien game people really want it.

[21:55] I don't know, every time I see Hilton put up that image

[21:58] with there's so many shots and alien

[22:00] and with stupid lines going everywhere.

[22:02] It's a joke.

[22:03] This isn't the greatest pinball machine.

[22:05] This isn't the alien pinball machine people want it.

[22:08] I think it's a pinball machine with a great light show,

[22:10] great music and call outs by David Teo.

[22:15] But at the end of the day, this thing,

[22:17] it's just like this never ending product

[22:21] where these guys can't get their act together.

[22:23] And look, now they're telling Ellie owners,

[22:26] it's going to be 30 to 60 days

[22:28] to they get their games and it's almost September 1.

[22:30] So it could take two more months to get people's games.

[22:33] So September, October, all right.

[22:36] So we're going to be at Expo 2017.

[22:38] When was the 50th, was the 40th anniversary of Alien?

[22:42] When was it?

[22:43] Was it the 35th anniversary?

[22:44] I don't even know.

[22:45] We're almost like five, six years past

[22:48] the actual anniversary of the game itself.

[22:51] So look, that's that.

[22:53] All right, a couple more things

[22:55] and we got to wrap this up

[22:56] because Brendan's got to take the computer

[22:58] and this is the only computer I podcast on.

[23:00] So this seems there was some controversy

[23:02] at the Northwest Championship.

[23:06] I think it was this past weekend.

[23:08] There is an allegation of sexism

[23:10] that occurred at the championship

[23:13] and I didn't really see much of this discussed on Pinside

[23:15] but this was discussed on the tilt forms.

[23:17] And here's what I could ascertain happened.

[23:22] There was a finals happening

[23:24] and there was two male commentators

[23:26] that were commenting on the female championship

[23:30] and they were playing Johnny Numanik

[23:32] and apparently there was a controversy over

[23:35] hitting the second flipper button for our video mode

[23:39] and one woman was claiming the button didn't work

[23:43] and I guess the commentator said some remarks

[23:45] that weren't very kind and were taken as sexist.

[23:51] I think that's what happened

[23:52] and then apparently there was some other issues of

[23:56] some sexist comments that were made during this whole tournament.

[24:01] Look, this is a very, very serious accusation.

[24:06] I would say that I've witnessed sexism a lot in this hobby.

[24:12] It's a, for people who think that this isn't like a boys club,

[24:17] you're fooling yourselves.

[24:19] You know, every time I go to like a cigar bar

[24:22] with a bunch of dudes,

[24:23] if you were to record the conversation they're having,

[24:27] yeah, it would file itself under sexism for sure

[24:32] and I think the struggle with pinball is,

[24:35] equality in the pinball world,

[24:37] like everyone treating each other with respect.

[24:39] I don't condone it.

[24:42] I think it just is what it is.

[24:45] It's unfortunate, but if I was a woman in the pinball hobby

[24:51] and I frequent in pinball shows and hung out,

[24:55] I think it's hard for them

[24:58] because a lot of these guys just speak freely

[25:01] and they don't understand the sensitivity is around it

[25:03] and people are even more sensitive when you're entering

[25:05] into a hobby that is predominantly run by older white men

[25:12] for the most part.

[25:14] And we've seen sexist posts on pinside and whatnot

[25:18] and it's the darker side of this hobby.

[25:23] I'm not sure what happened at the Northwest show for sure.

[25:27] If anyone was there and wants to talk about it,

[25:29] hit me up at canadapinballagemail.com.

[25:32] If anyone was involved in the incident,

[25:34] I'd love to talk to you about it.

[25:35] I'll say this though, the commenter on tilt forms,

[25:39] he posted an apology that some of his remarks

[25:42] might have been taken incorrectly.

[25:46] And I think we just let it end there.

[25:48] I mean, at some point, if someone says something

[25:51] and it was taken the wrong way, let it end there.

[25:55] So again, I just wanted to call it out

[25:57] because I saw some conversation happening around that.

[26:01] I'll leave you guys with one final silly, ridiculous thing

[26:06] and that is that there is a Jetson's pinball machine

[26:11] on eBay.

[26:12] You know, it's where it's,

[26:13] eBay is the best place to go buy pinball machines, right?

[26:16] They always have the best deals.

[26:17] There's a Jetson's pinball machine

[26:19] that is listed on eBay, okay?

[26:22] For get this, the bargain price of $12,500.

[26:27] And it is, the item is used,

[26:31] but it is also described in quotes as priceless.

[26:35] And the headline is Jetson's pinball machine,

[26:38] number 16 of only 100 ever to be made.

[26:41] And here's the description, it made me laugh my ass up.

[26:44] Jetson's pinball machine,

[26:46] number 16 of only 100 priceless.

[26:48] Be the only one on your block to have one.

[26:50] Your kids will love you.

[26:52] This game has only a handful of plays on it.

[26:56] 100% super bright LED, real fun fast game,

[27:00] grab it while you can for $12,500.

[27:06] I think everyone who listens to this podcast

[27:08] should hit up eBay user MalloryOne Whitefish

[27:14] and just make her an offer of $1 on this machine.

[27:18] Just inundate her with $1 offers.

[27:21] These people, I've seen them before,

[27:23] they've got like that hardwood floor

[27:25] in this like white studio apartment

[27:27] where they put machines up

[27:29] and they charge so much money for it.

[27:31] So look, Jetson's for $12,500.

[27:35] And all of a sudden it's making my dialed in

[27:38] collectors edition seem like a bargain.

[27:41] But here's my final point.

[27:42] And Brenna's looking at me like I gotta go.

[27:44] I'll say this, I got asked to pay in full

[27:47] for dialed in collectors edition.

[27:49] I got an email saying, all right, here's your number.

[27:53] It's like it's going into production in September,

[27:54] pay in full.

[27:56] And I sent an email back to Joe at Pimbalstar saying,

[28:00] all right, Joe, can I see it?

[28:02] Can I see what it is?

[28:04] And the answer is currently no.

[28:08] Like I heard they're doing some sort of surprise reveal.

[28:12] And I have an issue with that.

[28:14] Why are we asking people to pay in full

[28:17] for dialed in collectors edition before seeing it?

[28:21] And I don't agree with that.

[28:23] I mean, I love the game.

[28:24] I love Jersey Jack.

[28:25] I love what they're doing.

[28:26] I love Joe.

[28:26] I think he's a great distributor.

[28:28] But I'm going to send Jack an email today saying,

[28:30] hey, you've got to let people who are paying the most

[28:34] they've ever paid for a Jersey Jack product.

[28:37] See the machine.

[28:38] I mean, this is, I just have a, it's not the money.

[28:43] The money's not the issue.

[28:45] I just want to see the final version of the game with the ride

[28:49] cows, with the topper, with the purple trim.

[28:52] And I want to make up my mind when I see it.

[28:54] If this is what I want.

[28:56] And I think we're past the point of people going in

[28:59] and being asked to pay large amounts of money

[29:02] with just their imagination.

[29:04] Yeah, I've seen the art.

[29:05] Yeah, I can envision what purple looks like.

[29:07] Yeah, but I want to see it.

[29:08] I want to see what it really looks like.

[29:09] I want to know they've built one and have it somewhere

[29:13] to photograph.

[29:14] I don't think you should make people spend the money

[29:17] with their imagination.

[29:18] And I think most of you would agree.

[29:21] And I'm also like, Joseph, good guys.

[29:24] Like, OK, let me know by Wednesday because I have to find

[29:26] a new buyer.

[29:27] But look, it was $1,000 refundable.

[29:31] And I think you have to let people see the product before you

[29:34] say their money's non-refundable.

[29:36] That's only fair.

[29:38] It's only fair.

[29:39] So we'll see what they say.

[29:40] I'm going to send Jack a note today and say, hey, can we see it?

[29:43] And we'll take it from there.

[29:44] So that's it.

[29:45] Episode 155 of Canadian Pimple Podcast.

[29:48] Brenda's got to go.

[29:49] We're going to wrap it up.

[29:50] I'm not going to put any exit music.

[29:52] I know you love the exit music, but that's a wrap, kids.
