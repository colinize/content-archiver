[00:00] Shaken would beat, and defeat mostly, apes for experiments.

[00:09] SWAN Rachel and Her~~~

[00:13] No coronavirus could keep me and Brenda from risking life and limb to go to Jack Barr this

[00:20] morning, to play Rick and Morty Pimball for almost 2 hours straight!

[00:25] And we're going, by where I mean me, I'm going to give you my review of Rick and Morty

[00:31] Pimball after all this time.

[00:33] All the hype of this game sold out in 4 hours, Scott and E.C., people's favorite Pimball

[00:39] designer, Rick and Morty, a show that most of you have never seen before until this game

[00:43] was revealed that you're now enjoying, does this game, does this game live up to the hype?

[00:49] Now it doesn't matter, right?

[00:51] They sold out all 750 in 4 hours, but that's not what you care about.

[00:57] What you care about is this game as great as the hype and the expectations surrounding

[01:03] it.

[01:04] We're going to talk about it right now.

[01:05] Now what's hard for me to do reviews on Canadian Pimball podcast, I want to set the

[01:10] stage for this review because I know, and it's hard for me to escape this fact, I know

[01:15] that when I give you my feelings on a game, it sometimes sets the tone of a game for

[01:22] many, many months to come.

[01:24] And I know some people are out there like, who cares what Canadian says?

[01:27] It's just one man's opinion.

[01:29] But it just so happens that this one man has two to three thousand people that listen

[01:35] to every single podcast we put up.

[01:37] So I think my reviews carry some weight because I think I am a lot like you.

[01:43] And I think most of you out there who play Pimball are probably in a similar skill set as

[01:49] myself.

[01:50] I'm not the best Pimball player, but I'm not the worst.

[01:52] But I do represent probably the majority of people who walk up to a game have a skill

[01:58] set like mine.

[02:00] So there's that.

[02:01] There's also just I think a lot of us look for the same thing in a Pimball machine.

[02:05] We want a machine with a great theme.

[02:09] We want a world under glass.

[02:10] We want rewarding shots.

[02:12] We want the whole package, right?

[02:13] We all spend a lot of money on these machines.

[02:16] And so there's just certain boxes that a lot of us want to check.

[02:20] And I'm going to go through what I think this game does so very amazingly well.

[02:25] I'm going to go through what I think this game does okay at.

[02:28] And I'm going to go through what I think this game is really bad at.

[02:33] Okay.

[02:34] Does that, does that sound fair?

[02:35] Let's do it.

[02:36] All right.

[02:37] So I just got back into the apartment and I was running back into the bedroom and I put

[02:41] the mic on and here is my overall.

[02:44] I want to start with just my overall feelings on Rick and Morty Pimball having just played

[02:48] it for two hours.

[02:50] I think this game is so much fun and so incredibly frustrating at the same time.

[02:57] I don't think I've ever played a game where every time I walked away from it, I kept

[03:02] saying to Brenda and John at Jack Bar.

[03:04] I'm really enjoying it, but I'm also like extremely frustrated with what is happening

[03:11] during the gameplay experience of the game itself.

[03:13] And that's sort of like my overall summary as I sit here right now thinking about this

[03:18] game.

[03:19] There's just, there's things I absolutely love.

[03:23] I love so many things about this game beyond belief.

[03:27] And then there's just some things that are such big head scratchers that I can't for

[03:32] the life of me figure out why some of this stuff that just makes me want to pull my hair

[03:38] out wasn't caught earlier on in the development of this game.

[03:43] So let's start with the good, right?

[03:45] The good stuff in this game.

[03:47] The theme integration in this game is where this game just shines beyond belief.

[03:53] You feel like you are jumping right into the Rick and Morty universe, the call outs,

[03:59] the clips from the show, the modes.

[04:02] It pulls you in.

[04:03] It pulls you in like no other theme currently in Pimball.

[04:07] There hasn't been a recent Pimball launch that gave you every single thing you want from

[04:13] a theme integration.

[04:14] It reminds me a lot of Batman in which so much of what you love about the property is

[04:20] coming at you.

[04:21] It's coming at you with the music.

[04:23] It's coming at you with the modes.

[04:24] It's coming at you with the speech.

[04:27] The custom call outs.

[04:28] There are not many games.

[04:30] It's crazy when you think about it that really have this level of theme integration.

[04:34] So if you are a fan of Rick and Morty Pimball.

[04:37] You are absolutely going to love.

[04:40] Love, love, love.

[04:41] How they integrated the theme in this game.

[04:44] It's pretty much perfect theme integration in terms of the cartoon coming to life in

[04:50] the Pimball machine.

[04:51] All right.

[04:52] So theme integration, A plus, the music in this game is incredible.

[04:58] Scott Denise knows how to make a game an audible, amazing adventure.

[05:05] The audio in this game is so good.

[05:08] The speaker system in this spooky game is so good.

[05:11] This speaker system coming from spooky Pimball combined with Scott Denise blows any sound

[05:18] system I've heard away from from Jersey Jack blows any sound system I've heard from

[05:23] Stern Pimball.

[05:24] It just rocks.

[05:26] Like it sounds so good.

[05:28] Every other Pimball manufacturer should open up a spooky Pimball machine like this.

[05:32] See what speakers they're using, what amps they're using, what bass they're using because

[05:37] this game just sounds awesome.

[05:41] Like there's no crackling.

[05:42] I think John had it at volume 20 and it just at full volume just sounds so good.

[05:48] I love the way this game sounds.

[05:50] The light show in this game.

[05:52] And I know a lot of you are super fans of TNA.

[05:57] The light show in this game is so awesome as well.

[06:01] It was next to a stranger things.

[06:03] It was next to other games.

[06:04] It lights up perfectly well.

[06:06] And Jack Bar didn't really have a lot of lighting on.

[06:09] I happily am here to report that you will not need any pin stadium lights.

[06:15] You will not need any other additional lighting.

[06:18] You might, you might.

[06:19] If there's any area that could use maybe a little bit more lighting, it's the back area

[06:24] where the house is.

[06:25] A strip of LED lights over the house to brighten up that area is the only area.

[06:30] I think you would need additional lighting and you don't want to add pin stadium and just

[06:35] brighten up the whole game because you really do want to get the effects of the full RGB

[06:40] LED.

[06:41] And that would not happen if you ran huge LED strips along the side of the game.

[06:46] Okay.

[06:47] I love the modes in this game.

[06:48] It's very simple to understand how to play this game.

[06:52] It's very approachable.

[06:53] I mean, Brenda had and played it before.

[06:55] I had not played it before.

[06:57] You walk up to the game and it's very easy to understand what to do.

[07:00] You hit the ramps, you hit the ramps to light mode start and then you shoot the center

[07:05] scoop.

[07:06] Super simple to understand.

[07:08] It's not like everything's lighting up at once.

[07:11] It's easy to really figure out what to do in this game.

[07:14] So I do love that about the approachability of this game and the modes themselves are

[07:20] awesome.

[07:21] What I love about it, I love the way the music switches with each mode.

[07:24] I love the fact that there's such a different personality in each mode in this game and it's

[07:31] so much fun to go from worldly, dearly to the Roy mode.

[07:37] The Roy mode to me is my favorite mode.

[07:40] I love it when the music gets weird and wacky and it's like this soothing mode.

[07:45] In a game that's fast paced and in a game that's frenetic, it is so much fun to slow it

[07:51] down.

[07:52] This is a good lesson to learn for all pinball designers out there.

[07:55] I think this is why Scott Denise has such a following in a fan base, a pinball machines

[08:01] personality.

[08:02] It really, really comes to life when you code it like this, when you go from the music

[08:08] being this way and all of a sudden it takes you in an unexpected direction.

[08:13] You can't really anticipate that the music is going to shift so dramatically and that's

[08:20] why I love it.

[08:21] I love it when modes take us into a completely different feeling.

[08:26] When the music slows down, you also begin to slow down the way you play.

[08:31] You're not flipping crazy.

[08:33] You appreciate the slow motion nature of the Roy mode in comparison to the fast paced,

[08:40] high energy, worldly, and I love it when you've got such a mixture of music and a mixture

[08:48] of energy levels in the game.

[08:51] That's another reason why I really love the way they thought about creating the atmosphere

[08:57] and the environment of this game.

[09:00] The artwork is really good.

[09:02] There's nothing I found wrong with the artwork in the game.

[09:05] I will say the cabinet artwork was great.

[09:08] The back box, to me, it just doesn't feel this detailed.

[09:11] The back box art package.

[09:13] I'm a little, I wish they would have had a little bit more color and a little bit more

[09:18] detail on the back box.

[09:20] It does feel like the weakest part of the art package in the game, which is a little unfortunate

[09:25] because you're staring at that the most when you walk up to the machine for the first time.

[09:31] The inner art blades on this game, I think are a huge miss.

[09:35] I'm going to have to talk about the good and the bad as I talk about artwork.

[09:39] They're just kind of like black with planets on it and you almost don't even look at them.

[09:44] I think someone needs to make a more colorful inner art blade package.

[09:49] I really wish they would have carried a lot of those bright yellows and purples and

[09:54] pinks.

[09:55] The colors of Rick and Morty, I wish those would have carried over the blues of the Mr.

[10:00] Misex, all of that color for world.

[10:03] It just sort of crashes into the side art blades and goes nowhere.

[10:07] I know that they were going for that outer space, night sky theme, but it's just not memorable

[10:15] and in otherwise much more colorful and bright art package.

[10:19] If you see my photos of the Jack Bar game that we were playing, there are black legs

[10:24] on the game.

[10:25] No, the game does not come with black legs.

[10:27] John at Jack Bar puts them on to protect the factory powder coated legs because it's a

[10:33] smart move because people at the bar probably brush up against it and mess up his games.

[10:39] He takes great care of his games and that's why I think he puts the black legs on it.

[10:44] That does not change the game play at all and John sets his games up perfectly and

[10:49] he tinkers with his game.

[10:51] This game was set up by an operator who knows what he's doing.

[10:55] Now, two hours of playing Rick and Morty, enjoying the modes, enjoying the lights, enjoying

[11:01] the music, it's a fun game to flip.

[11:05] It's a fun game to flip.

[11:07] But there is a butt.

[11:08] I need to talk about the other side of my experience with Rick and Morty Pimbal.

[11:15] This is a big butt.

[11:16] I think for those of you out there who bought this game already, 750 sold in four hours before

[11:22] anyone played the game, I do think this game has a dark cloud hanging over it and you're

[11:29] going to experience it just like I did.

[11:33] For me, the one part of this game that really continues to just baffle me even as I think

[11:39] about it now, it's the shots that are coming from that upper right flipper are just poorly

[11:45] designed.

[11:47] There's no way around it.

[11:48] I was going to sugarcoat it.

[11:49] I was going to try and say it nicer.

[11:52] There is no way that those shots ever should have made it past the white wood design of

[11:58] the game.

[11:59] I know Scott says he purposely designed it to be difficult.

[12:03] He purposely designed it to be hard.

[12:05] There are hard shots to make and then there are just terribly clunky designed shots where

[12:12] when you finally do hit it, it doesn't feel satisfying.

[12:17] It just feels like pure luck that you hit the shot.

[12:20] If you look at the right flipper, the upper right flipper, it's really trying to do two

[12:25] shots that are extremely difficult.

[12:28] One needs to be made at the very beginning of the ball touching the flipper and then one

[12:33] needs to be made at the very tip.

[12:36] If you think about a pinball machine, I always feel like a good designer, a good designer

[12:41] anticipates and knows how the ball wants to travel through the game.

[12:47] When I play this game and I think about those shots off that upper right flipper, it's

[12:52] almost as if it was designed against the natural order of pinball.

[12:58] It was designed to be in conflict to where the ball wants to go.

[13:04] You look at it and it's so strange to me that Scott designed it this way because there's

[13:09] such a nice area in which the ball could be constantly shot off that upper right flipper

[13:14] in a smooth way to do a rewarding shot or two.

[13:19] Instead, it almost needs only one shot.

[13:22] Like the shot that it wants to be would crash right into the middle of the ramp.

[13:28] Instead he made a shot.

[13:29] It goes above the ramp and a shot below the ramp.

[13:32] Those two shots are awkward.

[13:34] They're weird and it just doesn't feel like it has any, it doesn't have any natural flow

[13:41] to those areas.

[13:44] Like, I've read so many people's feedback.

[13:47] I've read Hilton, I've read other people.

[13:50] There is no way around it.

[13:52] Two important shots in the game are not good designed shots.

[13:58] They're not.

[13:59] I kept asking myself as I was watching me struggle with it, John struggle with it, Brenda

[14:05] struggle with it.

[14:06] I mean the three of us played for over an hour and a half.

[14:09] I would say out of maybe 20 games, 30 games, we saw that upper shot hit.

[14:17] The upper one with the spinner probably only hit two to three times amongst all of us

[14:23] playing.

[14:24] I probably saw the lower shot hit off the tip of the flipper that goes into the garage.

[14:31] Maybe five times, six out of an hour and a half of playing.

[14:36] And John is really good and I ask him, I'm like, you've had this game now for three weeks.

[14:41] What has it been like?

[14:43] And he says like, I keep coming back for more.

[14:45] It's really fun to play, but those shots are just extremely, extremely difficult.

[14:52] And so why?

[14:54] Like why, why make a game that is so much fun to play that has these incredible modes

[15:01] that you want to get through?

[15:03] Why design it in a way where two of these shots are shots that you're just going to want

[15:10] to avoid, but you can't really avoid them because you want to hit them.

[15:15] Now I know there's another way into the garage, which is the right orbit shot, but there's

[15:20] moments in which you increase the spinner amount.

[15:23] And then to get to the spinner, good luck.

[15:26] Good luck.

[15:27] You'll barely get around that spinner.

[15:30] There's no way you're going to be ripping loops around the upper spinner the way you

[15:34] would and maybe pie her to the Caribbean or Iron Maiden or Jurassic Park.

[15:40] There's just no consistency to it.

[15:43] So why wasn't this caught during design?

[15:46] And that, to me, has defined the gameplay experience for me today.

[15:52] It's just like that whole area I would have redesigned it.

[15:56] And I know I'm not a pinball designer, but I'm a pinball player.

[16:00] And a pinball designer should make a game in which players, the majority of people who

[16:06] step up to it, enjoy those shots.

[16:10] And why not make them enjoyable shots?

[16:15] And that might be Scott's approach.

[16:17] And Scott can say that he lives off of tears of pinball players.

[16:23] Like when he says stuff like that, I live off of the tears of pinball players.

[16:27] I know it's cute.

[16:29] I know a lot of you out there think that's funny, but I think when you play this, it detracts

[16:34] from the fun.

[16:36] And what is the point in which this game is like 85% of it makes you have so much fun.

[16:44] But dial in, the 15% of every time that ball is on that upper right flipper, it's a shoulder

[16:53] shrugging moment within the game.

[16:55] The pop bumper on the left sling is awesome.

[16:59] I love that that is there.

[17:00] I love that he put that into the design of the game.

[17:03] I think that made people the most nervous when they saw that initially in this game.

[17:08] That was the area everyone was like, I don't know.

[17:11] That's awesome.

[17:12] I love the right magnet near the right out lane.

[17:16] That thing is awesome.

[17:18] It's so much fun.

[17:19] It worked so effectively.

[17:21] The horseshoe mechanism up the middle, the Nisi lock 2.0.

[17:26] It's cool.

[17:27] It's cool.

[17:28] I love it when it's open and it loops around quickly.

[17:30] It doesn't blow me away in terms of being the major mech in the game.

[17:36] That's the whole thing about this game.

[17:38] There aren't any single toy that's going to blow you away.

[17:42] There aren't really many toys at all in the game.

[17:47] You know me, you know how I look at games.

[17:49] Does the game do something that makes you say, wow, from a physical standpoint in this

[17:54] game, the biggest wow moment for me is when the magnet grabs the ball.

[18:00] It keeps it from going into the right out lane and throws it back into play.

[18:05] That's a wow moment for me.

[18:07] Watching the ball interact with the left sling pop bumper.

[18:12] That's a wow moment for me.

[18:14] Going up the ramp is satisfying.

[18:16] That left ramp is really steep.

[18:19] Most of the times it'll go up and come back down.

[18:23] It's very makeable.

[18:24] The right ramp is also makeable.

[18:27] It's harder to make.

[18:28] I wasn't able to backhand the ramps very successfully, but I've been reading on pin

[18:33] side you can.

[18:34] So maybe the flippers were a little weak at certain points.

[18:38] The multi balls is fun, but you're holding on a little bit in this game.

[18:42] Don't get me wrong.

[18:43] This game is difficult.

[18:45] You're going to be holding on more than you're going to be feeling like you're under control

[18:50] all the time.

[18:51] That's fine.

[18:52] I don't have a problem with that.

[18:53] I know a lot of you, if you love the fast pace action of TNA, I think you're going to

[18:59] love the fast pace action of this game.

[19:01] This isn't a game in which you're going to watch someone sit there for 10 minutes and

[19:05] have a long ball time.

[19:07] This is not going to be a hobbit journey.

[19:09] This is not going to be a pie of the Caribbean journey.

[19:12] It's going to be more like a Willy Wonka journey in which ball times are going to be short.

[19:16] All right.

[19:17] So question that's just going on inside my head is, what does that mean now for my overall

[19:22] feelings on this game?

[19:25] What happens when you have a few shots in a pinball machine that are extremely frustrating

[19:31] to hit?

[19:32] What happens in a pinball machine in which there's areas of the game that you want to avoid

[19:37] because they're just not satisfying?

[19:39] I don't know how to feel.

[19:42] I don't.

[19:43] It's fun to flip.

[19:44] I enjoy so much of it, but I think what makes me sad is this.

[19:48] I think when you get a design wrong on a game or you get geometry wrong in a section

[19:54] on a pinball machine, I think what's really sad to me is that's it.

[19:59] It's never going to get better.

[20:01] Like you're never going to be able to improve upon a layout or a design that I think fundamentally

[20:08] should have been fixed before it ever got to this stage.

[20:13] This should have been caught in the whitewood stage.

[20:15] You know, we see it all the time.

[20:17] If the game has great flow and great layout, the other things can be adjusted with the code

[20:24] of the game.

[20:25] It was a little ironic that this game was sitting next to Stranger Things, a game that I think

[20:30] shoots much better than Rick and Morty.

[20:32] It does.

[20:33] I know it's a fan layout, but it's much more rewarding to shoot Stranger Things.

[20:39] But Rick and Morty is so much more enjoyable from a code standpoint, from a mode standpoint.

[20:44] All the other elements of Rick and Morty are so much cooler, but yet I would rather

[20:50] experience the shot flow of a Stranger Things, if that makes sense.

[20:55] I would much rather shoot El Vira from just from a layout standpoint.

[21:02] It's not just to say like fan layout or the way to go.

[21:04] That's not it at all, because Willy Wonka is not a fan layout.

[21:08] I much prefer the smoothness of the Willy Wonka shots over the clunkiness of the Rick

[21:15] and Morty shots, but there's nothing I can do now other than, as people would say, play

[21:22] better.

[21:23] But this is not a play better.

[21:25] This is not playing better.

[21:27] This is learning, and I'm just going to say this, this is learning how to adjust the way

[21:33] you flip to make up for what I feel is bad design choices by the designer.

[21:41] This is nothing personal against Scott, but I really think somebody should have stood

[21:47] over this game in the Whitewood stage and said, this is too clunky.

[21:53] You'll see it when you look over the machine.

[21:56] It just doesn't feel natural to put those two shots coming off of the upper right flipper.

[22:02] Someone should have said, why don't we open this up a little bit more?

[22:06] Why don't we make it much more rewarding and easier to get into the garage from this

[22:13] upper right flipper?

[22:14] Or why don't we have the upper right flipper also be able to feed the left ramp?

[22:20] Can we shoot it up the ramp that other games have done with upper right flippers?

[22:23] Again, I think it was just like designed to take everything you expect to come off

[22:27] an upper right flipper and throw it out the window.

[22:31] I don't think it works.

[22:33] I think there's just a natural way the ball wants to go, and this is trying to interfere

[22:39] with that.

[22:40] You're going to see when you play it, and that upper shot with the spinner, it's clunky,

[22:46] it rattles around, it's going to go 10% of the time, it's going to make it around there.

[22:51] What fun is that?

[22:52] 10% of the time?

[22:55] How does having a 10% success rate?

[22:57] How does that make it past a white wood design of a game?

[23:01] Take any other game you love.

[23:04] If it's 10% of the time, you can actually make a shot that you need to make.

[23:09] You need to make these shots.

[23:11] Then I get that they have two ways to make the shots, but then what's the point?

[23:17] What's the point of having to have two ways to get to stuff in the game, one in which

[23:23] is just not makeable?

[23:26] I just don't understand that.

[23:28] It makes me feel like something was wasted in this game, and here's what I mean by that.

[23:33] You could have had something else that that upper right flipper does instead of being the

[23:38] much more impossible way to light a mode or light a shot or accomplish something.

[23:44] You see what I'm saying?

[23:45] There has to be, there's two pathways to do the same thing in the game.

[23:50] Why?

[23:51] Why couldn't they just make the upper right flipper shot something that was necessary,

[23:55] that was makeable versus one of two options that's really impossible to make.

[24:03] I mean that.

[24:04] I can already hear people, like Hilton's probably getting his defense mechanisms ready that

[24:09] it's much easier to make than he's alluding to.

[24:12] It's not.

[24:13] It's just, it's not.

[24:15] Everyone was struggling with it for almost two hours.

[24:21] What is Pimball then?

[24:23] Is Pimball this game in which you need weeks to learn how to hit that shot?

[24:28] We all, it's not that hard to understand a flipper's geometry in Pimball.

[24:36] And John's been playing the game consistently for three weeks.

[24:39] The game he said has over a thousand plays.

[24:42] Now the play field looks like glass by the way.

[24:44] Super impressed by the play field quality.

[24:46] No dimples looks like glass.

[24:48] But man, man.

[24:50] I'm just, it's a tale of two feelings with this game.

[24:54] So you might be saying yourself, well here goes Kaneda again.

[24:57] He hyped a game.

[24:59] He flipped a game.

[25:01] And now he's going to flip the game and sell it.

[25:02] Now look, when I played Willy Wonka, I loved the way it shot.

[25:06] I loved the way it shot.

[25:08] Willy Wonka fell apart for me because of the code.

[25:11] I love the code in this game.

[25:13] I love the mose in this game.

[25:15] I love the code so much so that it makes me so sad that some of the design elements and

[25:21] the shot layouts make getting through the code so frustrating and annoying.

[25:28] That it's like, you know what I'm saying?

[25:29] It's like, it's like, to me, both these games are the polar opposite.

[25:34] I wish, I wish, wish, wish that Rick and Morty didn't have these kinds of design issues

[25:41] because you can't change it.

[25:43] You just have to live with it.

[25:44] And so if you're willing to live with those design issues and you love Rick and Morty,

[25:50] I think you're going to enjoy the rest the game has to offer.

[25:53] I haven't spent so much time on it that I can ultimately say these shots are always

[25:59] going to be problematic.

[26:01] But I in my five years of covering Pimball, I have never stepped up to a machine and

[26:08] had shots be so difficult like that.

[26:13] And I think it's a mistake.

[26:15] And I think Scott Dinesi is so good at designing the lights and the sound.

[26:20] I'm just going to say it.

[26:21] I think Scott needs some help now.

[26:24] And I think people around him need to help him a little bit, design it to be smoother

[26:29] and have better flow and not design these kinds of things into a game.

[26:34] Because if you, he needs to learn how to, I think he needs to learn a little bit.

[26:39] He needs to learn a little bit.

[26:40] I don't think if this is coming out of his design shop, people are going to be that satisfied.

[26:46] Because here's the thing, if you're a Pimball designer and people jump on your game,

[26:52] why would you design it to make them frustrated?

[26:56] You know, I think he means it when he says he lives off of the tiers of Pimball players.

[27:01] Why?

[27:02] Do you want to design a car that's hard to keep straight?

[27:05] Do you want to design a movie that you just can't enjoy?

[27:09] It's like you're designing things to be headache inducing.

[27:13] By choice, is that good?

[27:17] I think he needs to learn a little bit that that's not a good option.

[27:22] And I think he needs to hear that feedback.

[27:25] Because if not, I don't think Scott's going to, I don't think he's at the level of a

[27:31] Keither and Eric or a Pat Lawler.

[27:34] You know, in a lot of ways, and I'm just going to say this.

[27:38] I would have loved someone to help smooth out the shots.

[27:42] I would almost, it's almost like I want Scott to design the light shows and the music.

[27:49] I want Scott to choreography a game, but I don't want him to do shot layout.

[27:55] Is that fair?

[27:56] Or he needs help.

[27:57] He needs help with the layout.

[27:59] And I think he's sort of so good in some areas of designing the Pimball experience.

[28:04] And I just think this area is one he clearly needs to work on.

[28:09] And it's not personal.

[28:10] That's just my feedback on this game.

[28:12] Because no matter what modes you add now and no matter what additional call out you

[28:17] add, I think this is still going to be something that hangs over the game experience.

[28:25] So my overall assessment is this.

[28:28] Rick and Morty absolutely unique Pimball experience.

[28:33] I think it has the best theme integration of any game almost that I've ever played.

[28:39] And if you love Rick and Morty, you're going to love it.

[28:41] I think this game has a lot of quirkiness to it.

[28:44] It doesn't have a lot of toys, but what it doesn't have in toys it makes up for in personality,

[28:49] character and charm.

[28:50] It has some very questionable design decisions, as you've heard me say.

[28:55] And you're going to have to learn to live with them.

[28:58] I don't think you'll ever find those design decisions to become satisfying.

[29:04] I don't.

[29:05] I think you're going to just have to live with them and get past them to appreciate the

[29:11] other stuff in the game that is working really well.

[29:14] I don't think it'll go down as the greatest Pimball machine ever.

[29:18] I think it'll go down as a game that is very good, very fun, a lot of fun in fact.

[29:26] But I think it will go down as a game that the fun factor will always be chipped away

[29:33] at by some of the shots that just won't ever be that rewarding.

[29:40] And you're going to enjoy it.

[29:41] And I think the Pimball community is going to be torn on this title.

[29:47] And I think Scott's second game is a really great effort.

[29:51] I really do.

[29:52] And I think Scott will grow as a designer and learn as a designer if people give feedback

[29:58] to him that is like this.

[30:02] And I mean that because if you just cheerlead and you just say everything is awesome, nobody

[30:10] gets better, nobody learns.

[30:12] And again, I think this game to me has one of the greatest licenses in Pimball history.

[30:17] I think it's so much fun to hear it, to see it, to hear the call out, to see the lights,

[30:23] to see the clips from the show.

[30:25] And you just kind of wish that that upper left area of the machine was just completely

[30:34] rethought out and completely different.

[30:37] And that's just how I feel.

[30:38] I'm still going to take my game.

[30:41] I'm still going to put it in my apartment.

[30:44] Brenda enjoyed it.

[30:45] I mean, we all enjoyed playing it.

[30:48] And you could say, well, that's all that matters is that you enjoyed it.

[30:51] But I don't just want a game that I enjoy.

[30:53] I want a game that's also super satisfying to shoot.

[30:59] And I think this is a little bit like Ghostbusters for me is it's all there despite the fact

[31:05] that there are shots that are just not rewarding and shots that will probably always be frustrating

[31:11] and clunky.

[31:13] And that will never go away.

[31:15] It doesn't matter how you set the flippers.

[31:18] It doesn't matter.

[31:20] Spooky from here on out.

[31:22] They know they have the ability to create Pimball machines based on themes people love.

[31:28] They know they can sell a lot of games.

[31:30] And now they need to start making these games with shots that are much more approachable

[31:37] for the majority of people.

[31:38] Pimball is hard enough.

[31:40] A Pimball design should never be designed to be like this per se.

[31:46] Make it hard with the code.

[31:49] It's hard enough to keep the ball alive and in play.

[31:52] But when you're hitting the majority of the shots off these flippers and it's only scoring

[31:56] and registering 10% of the time, that's no longer on the player.

[32:02] That's on the designer.

[32:04] A shot should not be that hard to find.

[32:08] Again, it's hard enough to keep the ball alive and Pimball for most people.

[32:12] So that's my conclusion.

[32:14] I know it might have been a little bit all over the place.

[32:16] I didn't talk about every single shot in the game.

[32:19] That's it.

[32:20] I'm left with a mixed bag.

[32:24] And we'll see where I go from here on this game.

[32:27] I can't wait for more people to play it.

[32:29] I can't wait to see what more people say about it.

[32:32] Does it live up to the expectation and the hype that everyone had for it?

[32:36] That's going to be on everyone to decide for themselves.

[32:39] For me, fun game, frustrating game, it feels like a combination of those two things.

[32:46] I wish I could take everything about this game that was super frustrating and throw it out

[32:52] because then I think you would have a great game, a game that would last in people's collections

[32:57] forever.

[32:58] A game that would go down as being one of the most fun Pimball experiences of all time.

[33:02] Because it's like the theme and the integration of the theme is just dying.

[33:07] It's just dying to connect with you and it does connect with you and you don't want it

[33:11] to end.

[33:12] But in some weird way, the connection you have to it starts to erode and you start to feel

[33:18] a loss of connection to the theme because the design stuff, it's just like nagging you

[33:25] and it's eating away at the experience.

[33:28] It's sort of like imagine watching a movie that you absolutely love, right?

[33:32] You're in the scene of the movie and you're pulled into that world but like the movie

[33:36] seat is broken or someone's kicking the back of your seat.

[33:41] To me, that's the greatest analogy of spooky Pimball's Rick and Morty.

[33:46] The movie's amazing, the game is amazing, it's so much fun but someone keeps kicking

[33:52] the back of your seat and pulling you out of that feeling you're having that you don't

[33:58] want to end.

[33:59] That's what it feels like.

[34:00] I'm loving this game, I'm loving this game.

[34:03] Oh great, upper right flipper shots, so clunky, someone's kicking my seat.

[34:08] Ugh, why can't someone, that person just stop kicking me in the back of the seat.

[34:12] It's like Scott Denise, he loves that he's sitting behind the saw kicking us in the back

[34:16] of the seat with the design of that upper play field area in the left from the right

[34:21] flipper, upper right flipper.

[34:22] Ugh, there's what he wanted.

[34:24] He said he lives for the tears of Pimball players and he's definitely going to get some of

[34:29] Kaneda's tears.

[34:31] Every game is sold, nothing I say matters.

[34:35] Lots more to come from more people who get their games, I'm still going to get the game,

[34:38] but that's how I feel about Rick and Morty Pimball.

[34:41] So close to being, ugh, Scott you did it, you made me pull my hair out.

[34:48] Rick and Morty, Kaneda's Pimball podcast review, tell me how you feel.

[34:52] I'm Nate at PimballadGmail.com.

[34:54] Ugh, bye.
