[00:00] Nothing's left behind. Nothing left behind people. You can't take it with us. Happy

[00:11] Saturday morning everybody. Let's do this.

[00:17] Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum. Can't take it with me.

[00:28] Ah, how's everybody doing? We are here just Saturday morning. I'm your host,

[00:35] Canada and we are we are talking pinball. Ah, I feel really really good right now. I feel very lucky,

[00:45] very blessed, very happy to be a healthy and happy family. Have a beautiful home. That is

[00:56] two thirds paid for in one year. Not bad, right? Stupid prices for everything in the world.

[01:04] But you know, it's going to be a good time. I don't know why nobody's a nobody's joined.

[01:08] You guys see the link on YouTube? There we go.

[01:10] Well, we'll let some people get through the door first before we go on my pleasantries.

[01:22] Ah, not unlike a fresh glass of water in the morning. Let's do this.

[01:31] Let's clean this camera a little bit. Hold on, I'm going to always end up dropping everything.

[01:36] I'm going to say there we go. It's even better. The camera is nicer. It's apple device.

[01:44] How's everybody doing? Good morning, Johnny Pimball in the house. Good morning, everybody.

[01:52] Yeah, I'm just feeling I'm feeling the holiday spirit. Looking out this window, I'm seeing all of our

[01:59] inflatables. Yeah, leprechaun in the tree. Why not?

[02:06] Why not? What's up, Robert? What's up, Cos? How are we doing? Where's Sad Boy? Brian in the house.

[02:15] This is good. Is the camera not on? Is the camera off for you guys? You guys not see the camera?

[02:23] Can you guys see me? I can never hate on Gomez, but that interview was rough. I don't understand why

[02:31] they can't get their SHIT together. Sad Boy, love you brother. It's just not a show unless

[02:41] Sad Boy jumps in here with the $50. I'm telling you where I'm going to spend that tonight. You

[02:46] guys ready? I'm going to see Machine Gun Kelly tonight. In Brooklyn, baby, I'm so excited.

[02:55] Can't wait to dance. Nothing like a concert where you know you're going to be dancing.

[02:58] And I get to wear my stupid outfits and fit in for once. That's the most exciting part.

[03:05] Fizzy, what's up, brother? Thank you for the two bucks. We know you got more money. You just bought

[03:09] a beetle juice with everything on it. You know, I've heard a lot of people want to talk about,

[03:17] and we'll talk about the George Gomez interview with Carrie Harding. There's something

[03:21] happening over at Stern. It's not good. It's not good. There's, I do think we talk about this a lot.

[03:28] I think this company is at a moment of inflection, and I just don't really understand the strategy.

[03:36] And that's not good, right? I mean, you should kind of know a company's strategy when you see

[03:41] their products, when you see the changes they're making, when you see the new innovations. I don't

[03:47] really understand what the strategy is. I mean, I know what the business strategy is of like the

[03:52] financial reason why they're doing these things. It's not going to work with consumers. It's just not

[03:59] unless we are absolutely unaware of the thousands of people buying these games that aren't on

[04:08] social media. I don't know. Maybe who knows? What's up? We got, hey, Mike Jones. Mike, what's up,

[04:17] brother? Hope you're doing well. Hope you're traveling the world. Mike and Becky, right? You guys

[04:23] always feel like you're traveling willberies. It was great seeing that time in New York all those years

[04:29] ago. Cost cutting. Well, the reason why the walking dead accessories came out quickly,

[04:43] you know, why? Because they already made that topper like 12 years ago or 10 years ago, 11 years

[04:48] it's the same topper. So like it was already designed. So I don't I don't think it's

[04:56] it's not the same topper. I thought it was. It looks I mean, I know they added a little it's like

[05:02] twice the size. Well, yeah, I mean, okay, so they made it bigger by scale, but they didn't have to

[05:07] design it really. They just double the proportions of it. The other one was embarrassingly small.

[05:18] See, Robert, that's the big question. Robert said, I hope they I hope they increase the bomb if,

[05:23] you know, due to these costs cutting measures. It doesn't feel like they are. I hear the stuff gets

[05:31] yanked out of every game. More than stuff is put in. And then I hear the opposite at Jersey Jack.

[05:35] I heard Jack told Steve Richie to put everything he possibly wants into Sonic the Hedgehog.

[05:42] And that's the difference. That is the difference. I think one company is loaded up and the other

[05:49] company is yank it out. We got to get this price down. The expression lighting system with armor

[05:58] is actually cheaper than spike two. You know what I don't like. And someone said this on

[06:03] pinside. And again, Stern, what's your strategy? What are you trying to achieve with this? I don't

[06:07] like the fact that you are now giving people who bought the premium the ability to have the same

[06:12] lit up side armor as the Ellie owners. I mean, it's like Stern doesn't get it. Like the very simple

[06:18] concept here of you continue to screw over the Ellie buyers. You continue to make the Ellie

[06:23] something that doesn't feel special. And then you continue to give the non-Eli guys a game that

[06:32] looks just as good if not sometimes better than the Ellie. You know what I'm saying? You just

[06:38] don't see the value in the $3,500 increase for the price of the damn Ellie. I mean, people forget

[06:47] man, it's like you accessorize this. Think about like this. Does the walking dead Ellie

[06:55] for 13,000 come with a shooter rod that's the zombie head? I don't think it does, right?

[07:02] Does it come with a topper for 13,000 dollars? No. So instantly, if you want to make your game look

[07:10] the equivalent of what you would get at another manufacturer for much less money, this is Stern

[07:15] we're talking about. Like who was always like the cheapest option in the market? I mean, seriously,

[07:22] the mass produce, they make the cheapest game in a lot of ways. I know they put money into assets and,

[07:29] software, but let's be honest here, this company is not making the high-end product. You know

[07:37] this, right? We all know this. The playfields are not the highest and looking playfields. The cabinets

[07:42] are not the nicest. The toppers are not the, it's just for what you spend, you are not getting your

[07:49] money's worth. And you know this right now, right? Okay. So the Ellie right now, if you want to put

[07:56] the topper on it and the shooter rod, you're now looking at a 14,200 dollar game, which is already

[08:05] the game is selling for 11,500 on Pinside and it hasn't even sold. You know, you got to think about

[08:12] what that means that there are 500 of these that they made. There's no demand for them. The price

[08:19] instantly is already decreased to 11,5 overnight overnight.

[08:26] You know, and then the problem, again, the problem becomes with all of their games recently.

[08:32] It's just like you don't even feel anything towards the Ellie. You feel nothing. There's no,

[08:35] there's no compelling reason to buy the Ellie. It's the dumbest buy. Everyone who gets the premium

[08:42] can then get the inner R.D. cows like stop stop offering that stuff. Why? I don't think I think

[08:50] there shouldn't be the ability to make a premium look almost identical to an Ellie.

[08:59] Evil dead is having tons of issues now. Everyone's games 20 side to die are your evil dead.

[09:05] Sterling is a reliable. There's nothing to break. You're saying they're very reliable Pins.

[09:14] There is nothing to break. Look, I've had guns and roses for a few years now, a year and a half.

[09:20] All right. Nothing broke on it. I played it a lot. I don't really play it anymore.

[09:27] Hey, can I ask you guys a question? You'll probably know the answer to this.

[09:32] I think I did this before I powered up my G and R. My friend has a G and R CE and it won't turn on.

[09:40] And is that just the battery? Now, because he let the battery die,

[09:46] is he going to have to reboot or reinstall the game somehow?

[09:50] And the battery is in the back box, correct? It's on the board, on the behind the translate, correct?

[10:06] Or is it the battery that's in the CPU that's in the cabinet?

[10:12] Yes, reboot with a paperclip. Okay. There's a YouTube video and how to jump start it.

[10:20] All right, great. All right. Thank you, guys. See, you guys, this community is so helpful.

[10:34] All right. So, look, let's talk about the Gomez interview. Let's talk about the cabinet picture.

[10:42] I don't know if you're a Stern. I don't know if you're a Stern. How you think that we would look at that image

[10:51] of that cabinet corner that we would look at that and say this is an improvement. That this looks

[10:57] like a quality build now. Does anyone believe that? I mean, I'm asking you guys, we got 64. We got

[11:02] a hundred people here basically out of a hundred people. Does anybody look at that new Stern cabinet

[11:08] and say this looks like a better cabinet? I'm just, I'm wondering if there's someone out here that

[11:15] wants to get in a debate about that they actually improved. They actually improved something with

[11:21] the cabinet design now. You know, in George, it's like, well, this is going to help us like put the

[11:30] decals on. You know, I was, I was laughing when he was like, I don't know how much glue the guy

[11:34] uses George, what do you mean, man? What do you mean? So George, you mean, I want it to be like, George,

[11:40] so you mean to tell me Stern's been around now for 40 years, right? 40 years Stern has been making

[11:49] pinball machines and you guys have always been anxious about the glue amount on the cabinets.

[11:55] I don't know, man, don't really buy it, George. I think when you guys took cabinet tree and house

[12:04] because you stopped working with Churchill, your cabinets went to crap. People forget, man,

[12:12] the Churchill stuff was way better. The Churchill playfields were way better. A lot of newbies in

[12:17] this hobby that weren't around, especially a lot of newbie content creators that were not around

[12:21] when the Ghostbusters playfield in search were all lifting. Remember that? They had to send out

[12:27] repopulated playfields to everybody. People forget this stuff, right? Stern's been cutting corners,

[12:33] cutting corners, cutting corners. And so the problem is, is as they've cut corners, they've raised

[12:37] prices. You know what I'm saying? Like you talk about burning the candle at both ends. You've

[12:42] cut corners and you've raised the price. It's like, it's like Dodge. It's like the reason why nobody

[12:47] buys Dodge is anymore because they raised the price on all the jeeps. If you think about a Jeep,

[12:55] man, how much is a Jeep worth to you? How much is a pinball machine worth to you? You should see

[13:01] what they did to Jeep. Jeep was always an affordable product. It was reliable. It was affordable.

[13:08] Now you can get a Jeep all the way up to $100,000 for a Jeep. When you go to a Jeep dealership,

[13:16] a Dodge Ram Jeep dealership, guess what you'll see? In ocean of unsolved product.

[13:23] And anyone who bought one at those high prices, they got hoosed on the resale value and the

[13:29] trading value on the cars. You know? Hans, did you get, you didn't get that new for 48, did you?

[13:38] They get so stupid how expensive they become. So Stern makes a, you know, look, the raspberry pie is

[13:49] embarrassing. Are we supposed to believe that the raspberry pie, that's a $30 item is somehow an

[13:57] improvement. You know what I'm saying? Like, so Stern, they got a real like perception of value issue.

[14:10] They've got it on all of their products, I believe now. And it's like, it's like, who aren't they

[14:16] screwing over? Right? It's like, make it cheaper, charge more, make too many LEs to the point nobody

[14:22] wants them anymore, then reduce the number of LEs, people still don't want them. I mean, think about

[14:27] that for a minute gang, they only are making 500 walking dead Oles 500. 11 years ago, those

[14:36] would, those would have sold out instantly, right? 11 years later, you can't even move them.

[14:41] And anyone who bought one just lost $3,000. That's what they're going to be in like a month.

[14:47] In two weeks when the new Stern comes out, you know, and you could see it too, like, you know,

[14:53] I remember like when Don was new and he was unboxing LEs and Ralph is the same way now, right? It's

[14:59] like you could see it like Ralph, he kind of gets it that canators write it. You could see it. Like,

[15:06] there's like, there's absolutely no way to defend anymore what Stern's strategy is and what these

[15:14] products are costing for what you get. And you could see like over then, then you go over like

[15:20] Benton, Wisconsin and you look at the craftsmanship of a spooky butter cabinet and put it next to this.

[15:28] You look at the craftsmanship of Harry Potter, you put it next to this, you look at the craftsmanship

[15:33] of a dune and a, you know, and a Winchester's mystery house and you put it next to this and you're

[15:41] like, how is this $13,000? How is this $10,000? Right? How is this $10,000? We're premium.

[15:50] So, jaws 50th is the last spike too. I think jaws 50th is a great buy. I've said it, I think it's

[15:58] the only Stern I would even think about buying this year. I think there's nothing else of excitement

[16:02] that has come out from them. I think everything else I would just, yeah, you know what I'm saying? Yeah,

[16:10] jaws 50th is just iconic. It's an iconic franchise. They nail the theme integration. I would have

[16:18] liked there to been more of a shark that does something. It is a little bit of a dog's chute toy

[16:25] that pops up. I'm embarrassed for them that that is the mech. I'm also like, I'm embarrassed that

[16:32] they made the Orca look like anything but a ship. But, you know, other than that, other than the

[16:40] the cheapness of it, it feels, we're jaws wins, man. It's like Batman. Batman's not the greatest

[16:48] shooter. But what Batman and jaws do so well is they just pull you into the world. They pull you

[16:56] into that theme. And it's like, because it pulls you into that theme so well, I mean, the moment you

[17:03] hit start, you're in the movie. The moment you hit start in Batman, you're in Gotham. It's beautiful.

[17:09] You know, the, the, there are certain games out there that don't ever like really pull you in.

[17:15] I don't think people get pulled in the John Wick really. I don't think, you know, I don't even

[17:18] think there's a, to me, John Wick is just like, yeah, you know, people are not getting pulled into

[17:23] the uncanny X-Men the right way. Maybe it's better now. I don't know. I'll give the new code a shot.

[17:30] People just, there's a, there's a beauty in what they did. I think James Bond also pulled people

[17:36] into the Bond world nicely with all the assets. Kong is more fun than jaws. So that is something that

[17:45] I can't speak to. I don't have enough time on, on Kong. I have way more time on jaws. I, I just find

[17:57] King Kong to be, let me just, I'm just going to say this. I really can't stand over a King Kong

[18:05] machine. It just looks like, it, it does just look like, like a unicorn just like, like vomited all

[18:13] over the play field. I, I think Kong was a game that they got so close to like, what should have

[18:22] been the next Godzilla and they just, they just vomited a rainbow over the play field. And I just

[18:32] like that, I like that jaws is the ocean, you know, you stand over jaws and the art that you want

[18:39] is there. It's not the most, it's a good example of like where I think sometimes,

[18:47] you know, and, and the advice I would give like Yeti and, and some of the art direction at Stern

[18:51] is like they, they have a little bit of this like, everything louder than everything else going

[18:55] on with, with, with their gains. And there's a, I don't know, there's a beauty in the negative space.

[19:02] There's a beauty and simplicity at times. And so I think the jaws play field is simple. And it works.

[19:10] And it's like, you know, it, it, it, it's like connects you to the theme in the right way. I,

[19:16] like Batman's a simple play field as well. It works. It's not overcrowded. Right. It's kind of,

[19:22] it makes you smile. You walk up, when I walk up to King Kong, I feel like, I feel like, like,

[19:28] killing and Cassian just went crazy with the crayons. And I, I just don't like that.

[19:34] What's up, actor in the house? Hey guys, I'm going to spend any money you put in the chats on Brenda

[19:49] tonight. So how much do you love Brenda? And you say, that's the offer. Whatever sad, sad boys just

[19:57] got Brenda like a few drinks. But I think we can go higher. I think Brenda deserves, I think she

[20:04] deserves Canadian fandom at its finest. You know, when we said a little bit of a goal, we,

[20:10] we always achieve it. Remember when we raised all that money for our dearly departed, um,

[20:16] well, she's still around, obviously, but the poor Emily, maybe we'll, we'll, we'll let her back in.

[20:23] Well, in the new year, we'll let Emily Anderson back into the party. You know, it's, it's,

[20:28] when people get blocked from Canada, um, Facebook, I, I would miss it. I would miss the ability

[20:36] to hang out with the Canadian called Thank You Fizzy. Look at that. Good man. He's now the four bucks.

[20:43] Um, okay. So we got George Gomez, Transformers or Pokemon. I think they're going to mess up.

[20:50] I just don't, I don't, I, I am way more excited for Transformers and Pokemon.

[20:57] Way more excited. Is anyone like really within our demo, man, we all grew up with Transformers.

[21:05] Most of us were not, we haven't played Pokemon. We don't look at Pokemon with the same affection

[21:11] as Optimus Prime, like the Optimus Prime. And if they got Peter Cullen, he's still alive, right?

[21:17] If they got Peter Cullen to do the callouts, I'm buying it. Now, what they need to get because

[21:24] the song was also in the regular TV show, they need to get you got the touch. If they don't get

[21:30] you get the touch and there's not a matrix of leadership as the top of this company is dead to me.

[21:36] Cause thank you for the 99 cents brother. You know, I'm saying, if they don't have the matrix

[21:42] of leadership as the top or this company is dead to me and it needs to open up and light needs to

[21:47] come out of it. Because if they don't do that, it shows me they don't know this, this property at all.

[21:54] I mean, it is all about the matrix opening up in a beam of light coming out and filling your room.

[21:59] And it should be like a kind of a almost like a disco ball the way the, the, the, the,

[22:06] prism, it should be like more of a prism of light coming out that goes all over your room and just

[22:11] and imagine if it opens up and it's like, you got the touch,

[22:16] then you got the power after all is said and done. You never look like if they don't do that,

[22:25] if they don't do that, then they don't know this property.

[22:31] And no, oh, licensure. Like we had to do with the licensure. Not even bold. I'm tired of this

[22:36] excuse. It was licensure. The licensure. The licensure.

[22:40] You know what? It's all, it's all BS, man, because I hear from other companies and they're like,

[22:45] man, yeah, a licensure might have like ideas, but like if you show them the possibilities,

[22:50] they often will say yes. I don't think Stern pushes.

[22:54] So yeah, I think Stern's in big trouble and we're going to see what's up. What's up,

[23:08] canada? They need to theme it after the 86. Of course, dude, they're not going to, though, man.

[23:14] You know, Jeff, 100% Gene Gonzalez, baby, with the $10 going right to a glass of sake for Brenda.

[23:27] Thank you, Gene Gonzalez, 3167 for your contribution to canadas,

[23:34] in-bought podcasts, Saturday mornings, and you guys are, you guys on Facebook are terrible. We have

[23:38] zero stars, zero, zero stars. Unicron as a top or would be the other thing that might work. I

[23:49] think imagine when you kill them and the like the beams of light go through his eyes and his mouth.

[23:58] I used to be out like, yeah, it's amazing. Do you guys know this? That Unicron was the last

[24:03] theatrical role of someone you know as Orson Wells was the voice of Unicron. This is where

[24:11] they're going to say we can't get Orson Wells as a state to approve it. This boy touched me.

[24:19] You know, you belong to me now. I belong to nobody. You know, Starscream, I mean, I know, like

[24:25] Galvatron was Leonard Nimoy. We are allies now against a common foe. It's the end of the road,

[24:34] Galvatron. It's a pity you Autobots die so easily, or I might have a greater sense of satisfaction.

[24:43] Boom, and then you got the touch. Arise, Rodimus Prime. No, Optimus. Like that,

[24:54] that is the moment that like like I don't think I've seen a scene in a movie that's made me feel

[25:03] more giddy than that moment. And they and he realizes like, you know, till all are one, you know,

[25:11] now light our darkest hour. And you just got to think about this for a moment.

[25:16] The whole pinball machine turns pitch black. And only the matrix blows as like Galvatron is fighting

[25:23] you, right? The whole machine should be dark. And then you light our darkest hour. And the whole

[25:28] machine should just go white light all over it. With you got the touch playing. And yeah, don't hire

[25:37] me as the CMO stern. Don't even make an offer. I would have taken a fake cut. Can you imagine if

[25:44] I was in the room while they're designing Transformers, can you imagine?

[25:57] All right, you know, I think Elizabeth feels this way about Transformers. Do you think he grew

[26:02] up as a little boy and walked into toys or us and saw Portraits Maximus there for $100? And

[26:09] all I wanted was Fort Max. My mom said, no, it was too expensive. Do you think he had those

[26:14] memories? He wasn't even born yet? Or he was like one years old. Do you think he feels this way

[26:19] when he hears you got the touch and dare? Would you have relocated the family to Chicago? No, I wouldn't

[26:26] need it to go. I wouldn't need to have to live in Chicago. I would have gone there. I would have

[26:31] flown, you know, look, I think going there like a few days a week would have been the way to do it.

[26:38] I think that a lot of what the CMO could do over there doesn't need to be in person every day

[26:46] after company. I got Omega Supreme. I had crypto. Our big ones were Omega Supreme.

[26:59] Let's see, Metroplex and Trip Decon was the big one we had. The Trip Decon was insane.

[27:07] From the dinosaur to the base to the robot. These are triple changes. Remember that.

[27:13] Oh, we also had Scorpinox. He was huge. Remember Scorpinox?

[27:18] We had everybody though. We, my brother used to like throw them all on a pile. We used to pick one

[27:23] at a time and then line them up and have a battle. Before the internet, you know, we weren't watching

[27:31] kids playing with transformers. We were playing with them ourselves. I mean, this is what the sad part

[27:35] about what's happening kids today is they watch people play video games. What?

[27:46] That shirt is not banned in Florida. We're bringing this to Florida, Frank.

[27:57] What when George said, didn't, remind me, he said the flat plastics.

[28:03] What was his rationale again for the flat plastics?

[28:10] Something stupid. It was like, what did he say? It was like, was it like a, did he, did he use the design,

[28:19] the design choice? He said something that I talked about it in my show.

[28:23] We want to make a profit.

[28:32] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, thank you, Mr. Hughes. He was like, you have to

[28:39] remember, like, why do you have cheap flat plastics in your game? And you have to remember,

[28:43] like when I got here, there was only like eight people in design and you know, 20 people on the

[28:48] manufacturer, like what George, what are you talking about? Why is there flat plastics in game still?

[28:52] So it's like this weird thing where Stern is like, didn't you want us to get this big? Let me,

[28:58] let me just, I want us to feel like talking about Stern's business strategy as if I'm a

[29:04] deranged Scooby-Doo. Are you guys down for that? Can we talk? Look, look, look, look, look, look,

[29:10] I don't know why I want to do this right now, but I just want to do this right now. Are you guys okay

[29:14] with that? What, how do you need to realize what we did like three years ago? This is really bad.

[29:21] I should stop doing this. Did you want us to grow so large that we'd have nothing but flat plastics?

[29:31] Like why, why would, you know what it is when I'm in George's talks? He, um, he,

[29:39] he acts like where investors in his company that we would be happy that they found a way to make this cheaper.

[29:47] You know what I'm saying? The only people happy that they found a way to make their product even cheaper are the investors

[29:55] who are lining their wallets with our money. We are not happy by that.

[30:04] I just don't know who's making the decisions over there. I really feel like they've been making some bone-headed decisions.

[30:11] Who gave the 1200 stars here? Hold on a second. Let me see. Let me pull up my star camera. Trying to click on it.

[30:19] Identify yourself. Let's see.

[30:25] Uh, uh, uh, oh, here we got stars.

[30:27] Okay. It usually lets me.

[30:34] Oh, I just turned it around.

[30:40] Um, if you gave the stars, thank you very much. Identify yourself and I'll give you a shout out.

[30:46] But don't cheat. Make sure it was you.

[30:48] Uh, I don't know, man. I'm so happy like Beetlejuice is going to be on the line in just a few weeks.

[30:58] I think Winchester should be on the line too in January.

[31:05] I mean, the last point I'll make is putting brackets to hold the cabinets together.

[31:15] I'm going to address what Ajax just said.

[31:19] You know, the GNR fan goes to see MGK. I'll tell you why.

[31:24] I'm going to tell you this right now, gang. And I mean this and I want everybody to keep an open mind.

[31:29] MGK's new album, Lost Americana, is amazing. It's amazing.

[31:37] It is absolutely amazing. It's different than like Guns and Roses, obviously. Guns and Roses new stuff is

[31:44] trash. Like it's trash. Like nothing is so bad and Atlas is so bad, absurd is terrible.

[31:52] Like all the stuff that Axel, you know what I've realized?

[31:56] Axel's got a great voice and he used to be a decent songwriter. No more.

[32:03] He's like, God awful now at like these songs are God awful.

[32:09] And it just goes to show you that like what made Guns and Roses so great was one man.

[32:14] Who guided all them. His name was Izzy Stradlin. So if you really know the history of Guns and Roses,

[32:18] you know that Izzy is really the guy that wrote all the big hits.

[32:24] And he steered them to get to the sound they had. It wasn't Axel. Like Axel, you know what,

[32:30] you know what Axel want it to make was crap like my world. You know the story?

[32:36] Izzy was like, you're not putting my world on user illusion too. Like this is garbage, Axel.

[32:41] So we're not ending this opus double album with that. And Axel said that promise to me wouldn't put it on.

[32:48] And then what did he do? He put it on because he's just like, he just is such a weirdo like that.

[32:52] Like he thinks like songs like that and absurd and you know, they're not good.

[33:01] Well and slash slash like when look at when slash was with Izzy because Izzy drove those

[33:08] songs with duffs like punk bass work. They drove those songs and dude, I you know when you go,

[33:14] like I just listened to like switch out the mind today and I'm like, this is like I this is so good.

[33:21] The way each of them dance and compliment each other's styles and sounds. It's like perfection,

[33:27] rock and roll perfection, right? All of appetite is all of it. They wrote appetite. They recorded

[33:33] appetite in two weeks, right? And then you get to like, okay, but my point is this. And again,

[33:41] for those of you saying it's crap, just do me a favor. Listen to lost Americana. Don't judge it.

[33:50] Don't say you're not going to listen to it because it's MGK and understand it's great music.

[33:56] And he wrote that album after hitting rock bottom. Lost Megan Fox was a idiot on drugs and alcohol.

[34:07] He went to rehab and he wrote the album and recorded it in two weeks. Again, you notice this

[34:14] thing here, like real creative genius happens quickly and you capture it. He wrote it. He recorded it

[34:21] in his living room over a two week period. It's it's a I'm going to say this. It's a terrific album.

[34:31] You know, artists sometimes just capture something in a moment and they find themselves in a moment.

[34:37] It's like M&Ms recovery album, right? Like there's a reason why it's so good because he got clean

[34:47] and he he finally had clarity. Now his stuff is crap. Like his new stuff is horse. Like it's crap.

[34:55] And I know it's weird to say this, but like currently right now in the world,

[35:00] machine gun Kelly is putting out better music than M&M right now. He's not a more talented artist

[35:06] than M&M, but you know what I'm saying? Like it's I think when it comes to music,

[35:11] you always should keep an open mind. I mean, I like everything from MGK to Sarah Brightman,

[35:16] to Guns and Roses, to K-Pop Demon Hunters, to the Eagles, to like Journey, to you know,

[35:24] like I like some Led Zeppelin, I like Somazi, I like I love 50s music like Del Shannon. Give me Del Shannon.

[35:31] Give me you know, give me um Frankie Valens, you know, give me uh give me all the stuff from the 50s

[35:40] man Frank Sinatra, my way. You know, it's crazy about my way. Read the story about that song. It's

[35:45] incredible. You know, that song is the music is a French song. So Frank Sinatra went to his song

[35:52] writer, his lyricist. So he didn't even write the lyrics. He, he, he, he, he, the French, the, the

[35:59] lyricist has heard the French song and then record it probably the greatest lyrics to any song ever

[36:07] in my way for Frank the Singh as his like a song that captured his career. I mean, it's a,

[36:15] it's amazing when you go listen to the French song. It literally is exactly the same song musically.

[36:32] Yeah, it's durable.

[36:35] Yeah, Paul Anca. Anyway, we got spooky in the house. All right, everybody, what are your numbers?

[36:43] Let's share our Beetlejuice numbers. I am going to be waiting the longest.

[36:48] Canada is nine, nine, nine, spooky. You better make my game last. I don't want any show games made

[36:56] after mine. I want my game to be the last game on the line. The last. Like I want to be there. I

[37:05] want to fly to Benton. I want to have, I want to have everybody sign it. I want to have like

[37:12] pop in Benton champagne known as you know, bush light. I want to, I want to make it a moment.

[37:20] I want to dance around it. I want to do a say on. I want to be like, yeah, yeah, it's show time.

[37:27] Maybe canada is going to Benton.

[37:33] We got 102 238. What did you guys get? What numbers did you get?

[37:43] And the Canadian club members, so you guys know, we haven't figured out yet, we're 501 502 503 504 and 505.

[37:53] Right smack dab in the middle of the bill. I love it.

[37:57] I love it. I can't wait for Beetlegees to get out. I can't wait.

[38:05] I love it. I love, I love like it's coming, right? It's like it's coming. And then we're going to get

[38:12] goonies, grandmins. Yeah, all the G's, you know, the G's they're going to be taking RG's baby.

[38:20] The double G like Gucci. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be I can't like literally,

[38:28] if you're bugging Luke, you're like, man, look at those corners, baby. Look at those corners over at

[38:34] stern, man. Like, are you serious? Are you serious? Like, I'm going to make a t-shirt line with

[38:41] those corners on it, man. Like that is like the new running joke and pimple. That's why I made it my

[38:45] Facebook, my cover. It's just I can't stop looking at it. I keep looking at it. Like, you know,

[38:50] because they don't even they don't even match up. The wood layers don't even line up. This

[38:55] thing just looks wrong. It just like killing would be like, you made a mistake, George.

[39:02] Like, how did Seth like walk over that and be like, what is this? Like, what have we done?

[39:10] They're going to make fun of this. We can't screw together cabinets with brackets.

[39:15] brackets. You want to talk brackets? If I'm Seth, I'm like, who did this? The only bracket I want is

[39:24] my March Madden is bracket. Now this crap, they're going to make fun of us. They're making fun of

[39:28] me every day. That I don't know pimple that I came from Disney. I don't know what I'm talking.

[39:34] And this is what we're going to put into market for $13,000. We're really going to do this, George.

[39:41] We going with this. Yeah, man, I think I'll say some, I'll make up some shit. Like, it's easier to

[39:46] apply the decals. Yeah, man. Dude, George, are you serious? Like, we can't say that George, and

[39:51] they don't I'm so sick of seeing these dumb videos where these guys are applying decals with

[39:56] squeegees. What are we? A window washing company. We're trying to sell a $13,000 product.

[40:04] Maybe we don't show them putting on a decal with a squeegee. Even if we have to, maybe some things

[40:12] are left unseen. Like, maybe we think about building a brand. Maybe we hire that Canadian guy.

[40:18] He seems pretty good at marketing. He understands details. He's read the book on reasonable hospitality.

[40:25] He knows how 11 Madison Park became the number one restaurant in the world. It wasn't because of

[40:32] the food, George. It wasn't because of the duck, Seth. They became the number one restaurant in

[40:40] the world because of the customer service, because the details, because they created moments for

[40:50] their diners that they would never forget. And you put these corners out in the world.

[41:01] And we were going to say, well, yeah, man, Spike 3 is looking real good.

[41:06] It's looking real good, George. Those decals are going on real easy now. Get the squeegee, baby.

[41:14] Squeegee it up. Are you guys literally, do you need me to tell you this? That we're going to make

[41:21] fun of you? That we work really hard for our money. And if any product we had, if we looked at

[41:28] the build quality and it was that, we would be like, what? What is this man? Is this the IKEA version?

[41:35] Or is this the, what is this? We're not doing this. Are we? We're not, we're not really going to

[41:41] put this out there. It's a joke, man. Spike 3 is stupid. There's no other way to say it. Spike 3

[41:50] is stupid. I think Spike, you know, Spike 3 is worse than Spike 2, bro. It's like, it's not

[41:59] better. There's nothing is better. And then they, oh, man, we got a text of meant 1242 in the

[42:05] morning telling that he's ruining our lives. He's disrupting our families. Not fair. He's not

[42:10] allowed to speak his opinion about our cheaper product. We're not going to fool Canada. Comes

[42:18] from a family of very opinionated Greeks and Sicilians. And he's got a hot wife and two beautiful kids.

[42:30] I don't think he's going to be, I don't think we're going to get to him. We can't turn him into a

[42:36] Ralph. They know that. They know they can't turn me into a Ralph. And I love you Ralph. But man, like,

[42:41] Ralph's going to bat for Stern's wood. Like, why? Why Ralph? Your content is so good. Like,

[42:50] Ralph, come on, man, like your eyes work just like ours. You see, it looks cheap as F, man.

[42:55] Like, this is not an improvement. Like, we just need more people to just make fun of them for it.

[43:04] Like, it's, they'll go back and build the cabinets better if we don't buy them.

[43:11] This is why I love the power of consumerism. Like, if you just don't buy it, they'll have to go back.

[43:20] I don't, I don't, man, it just looks, it looks bad. Like, it's $13,000 product.

[43:28] Hey, spooky. Anyone over a spooky machine right now?

[43:34] Let's see, what were the spooky corners look like? I want to see everybody's corners today.

[43:40] Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, if I'm George, and if I'm Seth, I say, I like being Seth,

[43:45] because I want to be the CEO and walk in. Let me see everybody's corners right now. If I'm

[43:51] Seth, I walk into a room and I want barrels as corners, spooky corners, JJP's corners, CGC's corners,

[43:59] put up everybody's corners right now and then put up bars. You see what I'm talking about, George?

[44:04] What the, George, look at this. Look at our corners, bro.

[44:09] You did, look, looks like, look, look at this cheap, this sandwich, all this plywood, MDF,

[44:15] and what do you, what are you saying, man? It's not better. How can you say that if they're looking

[44:23] at this for 10 grand, we're going to sell them this for 13. George, George, what's happening?

[44:30] What, what, what, what have we done? We should have just hired Kaneda and told Tim Sexton,

[44:39] you're going to have to deal with him. And he left and Tim Sexton quit the company.

[44:46] So there's nobody at Stern right now that I have, as of today, I have not thrown a drink in

[44:52] anyone's face who works at Stern. So I think I'm hireable now, right?

[45:01] Oh man, I still want that drink. Tim owes me a boxota.

[45:07] Nah, Tim, that was a stupid move. I'm sorry for doing it. I've said my apologies. It was seven

[45:11] years ago, but you know, sometimes people still bring it up. Kaneda got drunk seven years ago

[45:16] and threw a drink in the face of someone. Man, if that's the worst I ever do in this community,

[45:22] we're going to be all right. The kids are going to be all right.

[45:29] Oh man, you give Luke a glue gun man. Nobody's leaving that. Nobody's leaving that factory alive.

[45:35] That guy will glue gun you to death. You know, that's how his arms got so big, man. That's how

[45:40] Luke got so jacked. The glue gun man is holding it like, you know, I, I missed the old spooky days,

[45:49] man, when they would glue gun everything was it was endearing. It was adorable. It's like,

[45:52] you know what I'm saying? It was like, we're at a high school arts and crafts class and they

[45:56] were glue and everything down. Just glue it down. You know, it's like that scene in my big fat

[46:01] Greek wedding where it just puts windex on everything. That was spooky with the glue gun. How do we,

[46:06] how do we make the monitor like, oh, just glue it? Just glue it. Glue it down. You know,

[46:10] what about the speakers or the glue down? What do you know? Glue down? What about the expression?

[46:15] Like, glue it. Glue it. Everybody glit. It's like, yeah, I bet Luke had like a holster, you know,

[46:21] kind of like an old western like gun slinger with it. See, this is the problem is like, you know,

[46:29] how do you make pinball content after listening to my my show? Like, how do you how do you listen

[46:37] to a guy like this and then approach pinball content without being like, I don't even think this

[46:44] guy is making any sense. Like, I don't even think he knows what he's going to say next. I don't

[46:49] even think he's ever done show notes and the thing is, it's like, I don't even think he's ever

[46:54] played pinball. Like, you could, you could actually make that argument. Like, have you even

[46:58] played pinball this year? I don't even know. Yeah, it's like, but

[47:05] it's entertainment. He did it again. He entertained us for free. And we just spent $13,000

[47:14] on a game that has corners that look like that. I don't know, man. I don't know, man. I love you guys.

[47:27] You know, it's funny. It's like when you when you listen to these shows, right, they're just fun.

[47:31] Like, and they're entertaining. And, you know, I guess over at Stern, sometimes they might think

[47:37] that I'm bullying them. And, you know, someone, someone put those corners, someone,

[47:41] someone engineered the bracket, right? Like, there's someone over at Stern that engineered

[47:45] that bracket that's like, you know, going home like, hey, honey, Canadian made fun of the bracket

[47:51] again. I was really proud of it the way I got the cheap cabinets to look sturdy, to be sturdy.

[47:59] You know, Neil McRae loves it. We got one guy that's a fan. Neil likes it. He's going to order

[48:04] everything still. You know, he's going to, you know, make more money on interest in a day than his

[48:10] machines cost. But, you know, he's, he's got an unbiased point of view about these cabinets.

[48:16] That's good. Canadian's making fun of us. He, he's put up the corner as his Facebook cover image.

[48:29] George made the bracket.

[48:30] Brackets from Alex Pres. You know, I am, are you guys writing anything on Facebook?

[48:46] Can someone on Facebook write something? I don't know why I do this on Facebook for you guys,

[48:51] but I do. Because I just want people to be happy. I just want them to be happy.

[48:59] They need you to do marketing for the market for them. I would be a great chief marketing officer.

[49:07] And not just at Stern, any, any pinball company. I just, I know what this hobby needs. And I'll tell you this,

[49:14] much like what I was saying earlier, this hobby needs more unreasonable hospitality. It does. These

[49:22] companies don't do enough. They don't, they don't surprise in the light enough. They just don't

[49:29] talk to the community as much as they should. Everyone, you know, for the most part,

[49:34] everyone kind of launches the games the same way. It gets a little stale. Or they spend way too

[49:40] much money trying to launch a game. Then they need, then, then need be. I also think like,

[49:45] surprise in the light is the way to go with a lot of this. Like, I mean, look how successful

[49:52] the Winchester launch was, right? I like that. I like, I like just something appearing, you know,

[50:02] like just it's just out in the world in one location. First person to get it can take it home.

[50:06] Imagine that. Just imagine that. Imagine if Stern put a pinball machine in a box and just put it

[50:13] somewhere that you actually would have to like get to that no one is near. It's kind of fun,

[50:24] right? You don't even have to like have the game inside it, to be honest, you could just put

[50:30] a box somewhere with a special, you know, a receipt, if you will, an IOU for the game. And whoever

[50:40] retrieves this box gets the first le off the line. That's never been done before. And I'll tell you

[50:49] this, if I was the chief marketing officer at Stern Pimball the way I would approach everything,

[50:53] simply this. When we launch a game, we are going to always do something creative and unique that

[51:01] hasn't been done before in our industry. And what we're going to do and how we're going to achieve

[51:07] that is simply this. We are always going to do something that is in relation and connection to

[51:13] the theme itself. So we're going to really excite the fans of this theme by doing something that

[51:19] is unreasonable and exciting. So for example, the example I gave George with John Wick. They should have

[51:27] done a Stern tournament, not at a Pimball Bar, at a gun range. And whoever was the best shot

[51:39] wins the LE. And you could, you could have done it for a couple of months, you could have done it

[51:43] in different cities. There's gun ranges everywhere. Do it safely. And all of a sudden, you know,

[51:50] all of a sudden the conversation is not about the lack of guns on the artwork. It's about

[51:55] whoever's got John Wick precision wins the LE. Because you got to remember like it's not to them,

[52:03] the at cost to them. Remember when you're just giving a game away, you're really all you're doing

[52:11] is you're giving an at cost item. You're the manufacturer. So if it costs, if it costs some $4,500

[52:18] to make an LE, that's all that would cost. But the value of the earned media and the value of the

[52:26] conversation and the value of the goodwill is worth exponentially more than that game you just gave

[52:33] away. And this is how I approach marketing with my clients. It's how it's what my industry is all

[52:39] about. Earning media and earning conversation is the way to go. And I think that these, you know,

[52:46] talking to you now more like a professional here, I can do that. 25 plus years doing this with

[52:51] major brands. The thing is it doesn't matter if the brands are big or small. What's really makes me

[52:58] sad about pinball marketing is not just how bad it is. It's how how captive the audience is. And

[53:05] when you have such enthusiastic engagement from a community and then you see how piss poor the

[53:12] marketing is, it's embarrassing. Can I give you guys an exclusive right now of a theme I heard

[53:24] Stern is going after? Should I do it? Why don't we do this? Why don't I sell you this exclusive?

[53:37] Let's see. I will look we've got 111 people. I will unlock this exclusive for just $100.

[53:54] That's just a dollar or maybe two posts by sad boy. We know we've got fizzy here.

[54:01] And here's what's funny. This $100 we raised will obviously go to Brenda. But what's funny about it

[54:10] is this when you hear it, it's going to save you thousands of dollars because if they do make this

[54:14] game, you're not going to want to buy it because it's just the climate's different. You know, this

[54:20] this this would have been a theme that would have been fine. You know, it would have been fine 15

[54:28] years ago. It's fine for like, I don't know, maybe operators. But again, like when games were like

[54:32] $3,500. I don't want to make you guys guess. I just want to sell it to you.

[54:42] You know, I'm a little drained after all the screaming. I'm a very reasonable man though. You know,

[54:49] Seth called me up and was like, Chris, look, I know, I know you're making fun of us. I know you make

[54:56] fun of our new CMO. Look at this guy. Look at this guy. This guy's ridiculous.

[55:07] Okay. All right. So here is a theme that I heard that Stern is actively pursuing. They might

[55:12] have it. They might not again. But I haven't heard this thrown out there. And it makes sense because

[55:19] they made this this theme has been made before. They also made another similar theme before.

[55:26] So I'm hearing and I wonder if it's a remastered that they might do this with and just change the name

[55:32] of the game, which would be weird though because they're competitors. I am hearing

[55:38] that Stern pinball. Jamie, what's up brother? Have you recovered from your hangover?

[55:44] And Jamie, I don't know if your wife told you, Janine, right? Janine, right? I think I might have

[55:47] been like a little buzz too and called her Janice. And I think she got a little upset at me. But

[55:51] I don't know if she told you that. It got a little awkward, but like all good, Janine, you know,

[55:56] what I mean, people for the first time and I haven't said their name back a bunch, I often make

[56:03] mistakes. That's why when I meet people now, I usually take notes and write their name down.

[56:11] Okay. Okay. Good. Good. All right. Okay. So here's the theme.

[56:21] All right. I'll give you a hint. It starts with a C.

[56:27] Any guesses? Any guesses?

[56:35] Dude, Jay Cummins, man. Drinks on me. You guys are the best, man. We are, we are,

[56:40] we are, Brenda is going to get drunk tonight. I might get lucky now. Thanks to you guys. So thank you.

[56:44] It starts with a C. Jeez, come on, Pranchie. You don't leave it to Franchie.

[56:57] Oh, Chris, I needed that light. Oh my God.

[57:03] Oh my God.

[57:13] Cloverfield, that's a good guess. It's a really good guess.

[57:20] Cloverfield, the JJ Abrams. It is not Cloverfield, but it is, that is a good guess.

[57:30] Yes. Childs play. Is that, is that Chuckie? Childs play? It is not childs play.

[57:44] Look at us doing like market research for Stern for free with a 112 plus 130 plus potential buyers

[57:53] doing a free focus group. Carrie Hardy's barbecue challenge.

[57:59] Contra now, Contra would be really interesting, right? I don't know if they could sell the volume,

[58:06] but to do a Contra game. Kind of interesting. Not sure like what the world under class would be.

[58:17] Commando Arnold. Yeah, that would be great. Okay, Commando Kujo. Yeah, the dog cobra was still

[58:26] alone, right? I love both Commando and Cobra. These are all Commando, no Arnold. Yeah, this is

[58:36] Bimba Brothers would Captain America. These guys are getting good on these guesses. Now look,

[58:44] I think, can I just be honest? Why do I always say that? I would never lie to you guys.

[58:49] Captain America in the 250th anniversary of America next year. If I was the Stern CMO,

[58:59] we got to make CapNex. Like we got to, we sync up Captain America with the 250th anniversary

[59:06] of America and it will do well. I think Captain America, if you made it like based on the movies,

[59:12] you know, got to get the, got to get the assets. You know, I think I think it'll be amazing.

[59:20] And like the shield, you can throw the she, they do something with the shield and like,

[59:25] red, white and blue, baby. I'm sad to say that it is not Captain America. I'm sad to say that it

[59:31] is not Caddyshack. It is not Charlie Chaplin. It is not, it is not Casablanca. It is not cars.

[59:38] It is not Cinderella. It is not Clue. You guys, like honestly, I have to, you guys have actually,

[59:50] all of you have put out better themes than what I'm about to tell you. It is not carry.

[59:59] And the fact that nobody's guessed it is the reason why they shouldn't make it.

[01:00:04] It is not Coraline. It is not Kujo. And this is the thing. It's like, how hard would it have been?

[01:00:15] It is not Chronicles of Riddick. It is not Caddyshack. It is not the Chronicles of Narnia.

[01:00:24] Crap in a box of lights. It is not Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It is not Charles and Charge.

[01:00:31] Right now, you know right now, do you think they watched this? Do you think anyone at Stern

[01:00:35] actually turns on the Saturday Mornings spectacular? They know I'm going live and I'm going to

[01:00:39] talk about their company. If I were them, I would watch. If someone was doing a 90-minute show talking

[01:00:46] about Canada, I would probably tune in for a little bit. Cops, nope. Curious George, nope.

[01:00:52] Charlie's Angels, nope. Castlevania, nope. All good. A lot of these are really Castlevania, man.

[01:00:58] Oh my gosh. How awesome would Castlevania be? I mean, the world in her glass, Transylvania, the castle.

[01:01:08] You have the eight-bit graphics. Wow. That would be lit.

[01:01:19] Circle. Okay. Do you guys want me to tell you? It's not Chronicles of Narnia.

[01:01:24] Christopher Franchi. Christopher Franchi, the pin. It just curses at you for not liking the art package.

[01:01:34] Oh my God. Oh my God. You know, Christopher Franchi pin about trying to like,

[01:01:41] it'd be amazing. Christopher Franchi pin where the entire game is him defeating his arch-nemis,

[01:01:48] his old employer at Stern. How amazing would that be? You play as Christopher Franchi,

[01:01:56] and you return to Stern headquarters, and you just take everybody out with your pen,

[01:02:04] your digital pen or whatever. It'd be amazing. In a world where there can only be one best pinball

[01:02:14] artist, we give you Christopher Franchi, the pin. We got some more here.

[01:02:25] Critters, nope. See tar wars. CSI they already did. Nope. Creep show, Conan, the barbarian,

[01:02:35] Cyclone, Coldplay, Creature from the Black Lagoon. All better than what I'm about to tell you.

[01:02:44] Fizzy, it starts with a C. Why do you keep saying escape from New York?

[01:02:53] I mean, some people are don't even crocodile, Dundee. You know crocodile, Dundee was like the number

[01:02:58] one movie the year came out. Like number one, I think it beat out top gun. It is not crocodile, Dundee.

[01:03:05] Closing counters of the third kind. Take my money now. World under glass.

[01:03:19] Catwoman, nope. It is not Coldplay. Do you want me to tell you are we are we at time?

[01:03:35] All right. So no one said it. You guys said a lot with C. So the theme that I hear and you guys

[01:03:44] are getting this exclusive for free. Do me a favor. If you're not a member of Canadian

[01:03:47] pinball podcast, please sign up. I mean, literally we're generating hundreds of dollars here.

[01:03:52] It's $5 a month. You're going to get your entertainment value. And it's just a nice way to even if

[01:03:57] you don't really have all the time to listen to every episode, just as a way to say thank you and

[01:04:02] continue to support the show with love it. You know, my goal is always to get to 800. I can't

[01:04:09] crack seven like 40 was the most we ever had. But anyway, it is not catty shack it is not created,

[01:04:14] it is not children of the corn is nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. You guys are saying the

[01:04:20] the stern theme that I heard they are pursuing. And this is going to make you guys like angry.

[01:04:26] I do love the actual product that I'm about to say they are pursuing Corvette as a pin. Corvette.

[01:04:42] Now makes sense that they would pursue Corvette. Didn't data easter of Sega make a Corvette game

[01:04:50] and did not start to do Mustang.

[01:04:54] Franchi said Corvette.

[01:05:01] Oh, Franchi, I didn't even see it. Okay, Franchi. Okay.

[01:05:10] But that is it.

[01:05:19] Now, you know, look, when you think about Corvette as a theme, I mean, you got to think about

[01:05:26] what they're thinking about, which is Corvette owners will buy it. They may, you know, there's

[01:05:33] millions of Corvette owners out there. I think so in total, right? I mean, maybe not millions. I mean,

[01:05:39] probably. But you know, it's a guys game, right? It's a guys game room game. It's a man-caped kind of

[01:05:47] theme. And also, if you think about putting them into Chevy dealerships, you start to get,

[01:05:53] you know, in the waiting rooms, like, right? Then they do that with Mustang.

[01:05:58] But yeah, it's not, I mean, car themes in general are probably, they're like extremely limiting

[01:06:06] in the mass appeal. You know, and that's just, that's the challenge with them.

[01:06:14] Is for those who love Corvette, you love it. But everybody else, it's like an easy pass.

[01:06:23] So that is what I'm hearing is that Stern is pursuing the Corvette license. I just told you it

[01:06:28] exclusively. Franchi said it first. I didn't confirm his guess. And we reached our goal. You got your

[01:06:37] free exclusive info from Canada. I don't know. See, like, the thing is, is like, back when Mustang came out,

[01:06:50] you know, we didn't love it. But, you know, Mustang is not a terrible game. It's just, it's just,

[01:06:54] it's like, you can sell these games when they're 5,500, you know, or the LE for Mustang was like

[01:07:00] 65 at most, right? But you can't sell a $13,000 Corvette. And this is, I keep saying this is Stern's

[01:07:08] big challenge now is like the only thing that's going to work now is like amazing banger themes.

[01:07:16] Like, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't buy a Dodge Challenger pin, you know, or I wouldn't, I wouldn't

[01:07:23] want a pin based on the car I drive. I will say this, initial D would make for a cool pin. I think

[01:07:28] someone made an initial D pin. I think that one of those cheap companies in Europe made it, right?

[01:07:35] But the, but if you based it on the initial D anime, like, that would be cool.

[01:07:41] There's an initial D game needs to have all these like orbits and like, feel like you're drifting

[01:07:46] around the street. Can you imagine if you designed it so the, the ball rail look like a guard rail

[01:07:54] that's on a road and that whole game looks like the mountain in Tokyo that you're drifting around.

[01:08:01] Like, that would be cool. Like, the opportunity for a world-rener glass is super neat for like,

[01:08:06] initial D. You wouldn't buy any pin to be fair. I just bought, I'm buying Beetlejuice,

[01:08:16] buying Goonies and buying Grandlands, buying Sankta Hedgehog. I'm buying all those pins.

[01:08:24] Where I put them, I'm buying back to the future SLE. There's, there's going to be an SLE.

[01:08:32] You know, you're all going to like, you're all going to be my best friend when a franchise SLE of

[01:08:37] back to the future drops and you're all, you're all going to be like, oh, damn it,

[01:08:41] Canada has a few. I'm thinking I might. I got to talk to Barry and Melissa, but you know,

[01:08:47] I might be able to get a few of them. Jack Danger's in the house, baby. Jack, come over to, Jack,

[01:08:55] come over to YouTube, man. It's more fun at YouTube. Get in the chat on YouTube, brother. We love you.

[01:09:03] I wonder if like George went to Jack and was like, Jack, any way to make this corner look better

[01:09:09] with your lighting or you know, it's like, I bet Jack was like, dude, I am not, I'm not

[01:09:16] doing this because George George was like, Jack's going to make a video about the improvements to

[01:09:21] the cabinet. I bet Jack was like, I'm not, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. You know what,

[01:09:27] I'm going to do. Canada's going to do this. I'm going to, I think this will be funny. I'm going

[01:09:32] to order because there's got to be a part number. I'm going to order the bracket from inside

[01:09:38] the Stern cabinet. I'm going to turn it into a piece of jewelry and I'm going to wear it as a necklace.

[01:09:45] Like this, this is how immature I am. This is like, this is how my mind works. Like, I think that

[01:09:49] would be really funny for me to turn the Stern cabinet bracket into a piece of jewelry and like

[01:09:55] bling it out and and maybe, you know, maybe I launch it as a whole like a limited run of them.

[01:10:02] And we do 50, Canada and we roll around shows like that, like just all blinged out brackets,

[01:10:08] baby. Canada's blinged out bracket and we just, we just roll hard like that through this world,

[01:10:14] you know. I think it's a good idea, right? You see the way my mind works, like you would,

[01:10:18] you would never have thought of that that you would turn their bracket into a blinged out piece of

[01:10:23] jewelry. And so now like someone's got to go back and be like, Seth, like we can't hire this guy.

[01:10:28] Like, this is what he's saying about it. He just made fun of like our brackets. He's

[01:10:31] turning them into blinged out jewelry and he's he's mocking us. He's mocking us. You know, we need

[01:10:38] to send him a text message at 1242 in the morning and tell him it's not funny.

[01:10:51] You know, I want to give a big shout out to Tux. I've been I've been talking about Tux recently.

[01:10:57] I think he's on I think he's home. I think he, you know, for those of you who know Tux, he's going

[01:11:03] through a real difficult medical thing right now and he's received his treatments and I think

[01:11:10] he's now home. He told me his story about guns and roses and why that pin is never leaving his

[01:11:15] house. Amazing story. Amazing personal story. And he's he's all excited to go see them

[01:11:22] in September and I really special concert is waiting for Tux later next year and you know,

[01:11:30] he's an he's an awesome dude man and I and I think you know, we joke around about cabinets and

[01:11:35] brackets and you know cheap spike three stuff and beetle juices made. But we all know this that

[01:11:45] all of this like this is just a way for us to come together. You know, I kind of feel like this is

[01:11:50] all of us are in some sort of pinball purgatory. You know, we're we're all just together and the

[01:11:57] togetherness is what makes us a strong family and strong friendships have forged through pinball.

[01:12:06] And I know I know I say this and I and I get sentimental about it, but I mean that and that's why

[01:12:11] like I I just don't think that the money lost on these games is worth it because I think that

[01:12:17] you could have used that money to physically connect with more of your pinball friends. You

[01:12:23] know what I'm saying? Like you're gonna lose $4,000 on a game in a month and you and a friend could

[01:12:28] have gone like to Tokyo. You know what I'm saying? And you will never forget it. And I mean that I

[01:12:35] you know, I'm planning a big big trip to Tokyo. A big trip to Tokyo next year.

[01:12:48] People like park in front, you know, it's like, I'm laying when people park in front of your

[01:12:51] house. It's like, if you don't live in the house, don't park in front of my edges.

[01:12:57] Oh, it's my neighbor. It's okay.

[01:13:03] I heard CTC's re-re- I want to know another rumor I heard. This is just this is just the day of

[01:13:10] exclusives apparently. I don't know if these are exclusives you guys know this, but I don't know,

[01:13:15] normally I'd give this on the podcast, but I just feel like in the mood. I'm a really good mood

[01:13:19] today. So, but again, much like the Corvette rumor. $100 unlocks this next rumor.

[01:13:28] See right now people are like, you know, they're like, man, can it is like making money,

[01:13:35] selling our secrets? And as long as it keeps doing this, we'll never be able to get them to sign

[01:13:43] an NDA again. I love it too. Like, you know, there's been moments where I've talked to some

[01:13:51] pinball manufacturers and they're like, we want to bring you in. And like, we want to like, you

[01:13:55] know, sign an NDA and bring you in. And I'm always like, but why? What's in it for me? I lose my ability

[01:14:02] to talk freely, to tell your rumors like the one I'm about to tell you if we get another

[01:14:06] hundred bucks dropped into the pool. And because of that, you know, I mean, my freedom's not worth

[01:14:14] just, I don't like, I wouldn't want to see the next turn game early unless I was working there,

[01:14:21] of course. But I even think like what's got to be hard for all these pinball companies is,

[01:14:25] you know, they see these games for years, like a year and a half before it even comes out.

[01:14:32] By the time the thing makes it out, they're probably not even excited. They're just like trying

[01:14:37] to get on to the next, you know what I'm saying? Like, like the journeys beating them down so much.

[01:14:42] And then they, and then also they know that like Jackass is like me and people on pins. I just

[01:14:46] going to tear down what they spent a year and a half making in seconds. You know what I'm saying?

[01:14:52] Like, it doesn't matter if we do all this for walking dead zombie Eddie. Like,

[01:14:56] can a just going to make fun of the art right away. Like we might as well just go to the bar and

[01:15:01] I don't know. Just just block them on Facebook.

[01:15:09] Don't make sad boypeg and well, someone else step up. Who's got the cash? Who's got the mula?

[01:15:16] Money talks in this world. Money talks, baby. I'll take this. I'll take this rumor to the podcast next.

[01:15:21] If we don't, if we don't unlock it here.

[01:15:26] You know, when I do stuff like this to him, I'm probably going to hear from some club member.

[01:15:29] Like he's not getting his value for $5 a month. I mean, he's getting so much more than $5.

[01:15:33] They'd be like, ah man, you know, like I signed up for it. Like, like if you're giving them away

[01:15:39] but we do they make Corvettes and rainbow colors. That's funny.

[01:15:47] I'll text the next three games I'm doing for 500 hours.

[01:15:52] The Gremlins back to the future and Goonies for each of you. We know we know.

[01:16:04] I've been $10 a month for years. Where's my t-shirt? Did I, Jack, are you supposed to get a t-shirt

[01:16:11] for 10 a month? And by the way, thank you brother.

[01:16:16] See Jack, you know, I've always said this like and Jack listens to every show.

[01:16:22] Yeah.

[01:16:26] The I'm really I feel good for the guys that have been on the ride for a long time because I think

[01:16:33] you've seen a positive evolution of my show and the content and for people that join now, Jack,

[01:16:40] it's crazy too because they're just like they're spoiled. Like they're spoiled.

[01:16:45] It's such a well-oiled machine now, the show. Like it's just you spoiled.

[01:16:50] You know, and I said I would never raise the minimum spooky Luke. What's up brother?

[01:16:54] How's the glue gun going? We should spooky Luke. You need to do a glue gun retirement ceremony.

[01:17:00] I'm so full of good marketing ideas on this show today.

[01:17:02] Jengus is going to be like, creators, I listen to the show. You it was so good. You were so funny.

[01:17:07] Like you got to the chop.

[01:17:11] You know, but but but Luke, imagine a glue gun retirement ceremony. Like do the whole thing

[01:17:16] like a funeral like you put the glue gun in a little casket you close the lid. It feels like

[01:17:20] something spooky would do. And then you can bury the glue gun casket, you know, some like I have

[01:17:26] a whole burial ceremony at spooky. It'd be beautiful. Beautiful. You know, that would be a funny

[01:17:35] like gag gift that you get if you join the fan club. You get like a glue gun in a casket.

[01:17:42] I would totally put that on my desk. The spooky Luke glue gun memorial, you know.

[01:17:56] Fredji said I gave Jack a t-shirt. He never wears it. Probably gave it to Gary. Oh my god,

[01:18:01] right? You don't love about Chris. It's like it's like it's like the morning. And he's like this.

[01:18:07] I mean, I want to catch the dude at happy hour. Bonkers.

[01:18:17] No, let me tell you, Gary is wiping his butt with $100 bills, people. Have you seen the new

[01:18:23] cabinet? He's wiping his butt with $100 bills. He's literally like, I'm at $100 bill toilet paper,

[01:18:32] George. Make me a cheaper cabinet. Damn it, Canadian. You got to stop. These guys actually think

[01:18:38] this cabinet's an improvement. The bracket bling, baby, it's coming. These guys are like,

[01:18:47] all right, you're not getting that second exclusive. Brenna's not going to get passed out. You

[01:18:51] guys are good. You don't want Brenna to pass out drunk. That's why you didn't send the money.

[01:18:56] I get you guys. You guys are looking. You guys are good. You guys are, you really care.

[01:19:03] Oh, man, all right, we got eight more minutes. I'm going to go right to 1130. Hector does not

[01:19:12] want to be short-changed on this episode. He needs his free 90 minutes worth.

[01:19:22] What is in store for spike four? I feel like spike four is just going to get rid of the

[01:19:30] cardboard box and just use bubble wrap instead. Why not? What is this box? We can do something

[01:19:38] cheaper than this bubble wrap the damn thing. I missed the pin pod, man. Robert Mueller's pin pod

[01:19:47] from deep root five days of deep root. Remember that? Marketing genius.

[01:19:52] Where is that guy? Is he like in jail? Is he still like, is he still free? Is he out there

[01:20:01] threatening people still? He wants threat in me. He wants sent me, you know what Robert Mueller

[01:20:09] once did to me? See, you guys, like, he once had someone, whether it was him or someone at his

[01:20:15] organization. It came from San Antonio. Someone from his organization. This was the fry.

[01:20:23] This was, okay, I'll tell you the timing, too. It was very, very funny how he did this.

[01:20:30] He was accepting orders for Raza on a Monday. The Thursday before that Monday, I got a threatening

[01:20:39] message from someone in San Antonio naming the president of my company. The CEO and president

[01:20:50] of my company, their address is of my company that they were going to blackmail me and send to

[01:21:00] those individuals. I don't know, like some like a whole dossier of my behavior in the pin ball space

[01:21:08] to get me fired if I didn't immediately shut down my show. This is all true story.

[01:21:19] I just had a baby. I don't know if you remember this. I shut the show down and I had a contact

[01:21:26] the lawyer and the lawyer told me that that was torturous interference if they did that.

[01:21:34] I need someone over at Deeproot did this to clear the way for me not to rag on the Raza orders or tell

[01:21:42] you not to order Raza. True story. I also was legally threatened when Hag is pinball needed to take

[01:21:53] orders. Isn't it crazy? Oh man, Edward 40 hands with the wife tonight. Oh man, thank you. Thank you,

[01:22:11] Kenobi. Obi drunk Kenobi. I appreciate that brother. Now look, Obi drunk Kenobi has just given $20,

[01:22:20] which now means in the next five minutes we are only $80 away from unlocking that next rumor.

[01:22:28] I know Hector has got the money. Hector, I'm looking at you right now brother. I know you've got the cash.

[01:22:33] Give me the cash. Bit element. You send stars. All right, how many stars did you say? I don't see

[01:22:41] many stars. 2000 stars? It's not going to cut it. We need at least 10,000 stars.

[01:22:55] Joe a body. Joe get over to YouTube. Man, all you guys just migrate over. I get it. I do both,

[01:23:04] I do both for my fans. How's Ted? I haven't seen Ted in forever man. Is he doing all right? I haven't heard,

[01:23:13] I haven't seen Ted on. I should text him man. Yeah, I love Ted. We used to go smoke cigars. Look at

[01:23:21] this. Oh my god, look at Jack Danger, baby. All right. Now I feel like if you know this Jack,

[01:23:30] maybe I give you a refund. Okay, here's the rumor that I'm hearing. I am hearing. I'm just going

[01:23:38] to get right to it. I am hearing that that one of the games that is in development at barrels of

[01:23:51] fun that they plan to bring the market. I'm hearing that it is the pinball circus game,

[01:24:00] the Python, Angelo pinball circus game that was being remade by those guys circus,

[01:24:06] Maximus or something like that. So and here's the thing. Do you think, do you think that they

[01:24:16] could sell 500 of them? Because that's what someone told me and that's what like,

[01:24:23] now look, if this is if this rumor is incorrect, David Vines will tell me, but that is what

[01:24:32] I am hearing. Well, Don might have hinted at it, but I am being told with from one of my best sources

[01:24:38] that this is like what they plan. Now I said that I don't think they can move 500 units of that.

[01:24:47] And someone said, I think they could. Let's talk about it for a couple minutes here. Do you think,

[01:24:57] do you think, well, but it's JC, I'm telling you right now, I think it's one of their games that's

[01:25:04] not everybody knew it, man, I'm getting up. Some people did everybody know this rumor?

[01:25:08] Did everybody know this but me? Damn it, Don.

[01:25:19] Well, here's the thing. It is a novelty. It is a novelty and a half. It is weird. It is strange.

[01:25:29] Well, that's the thing is I think these guys could build it for like $12,000, right?

[01:25:35] Because I feel like when those pinball circus guys tried to do it, there's no way they were going to.

[01:25:43] So, Kerry, I know it's on display during the tour, but Kerry, but that, I mean, it's an

[01:25:50] existing game. No one, I don't think that's telegraphing that they're making it, right? Don't they?

[01:25:55] Kerry, did you know that is it part of their development?

[01:26:03] Kerry, thank you for the two-hour interview with George Gomez.

[01:26:12] Watching George, man, with the tech issues was hard, right? It's like, man,

[01:26:18] like they don't have an IT guy at the world's biggest pinball company to help him.

[01:26:25] Do you want another rumor?

[01:26:32] Okay. I mean, I've been pretty good to you guys. Jack, drinks on me next time I see you,

[01:26:40] brother. Jack, you know what I need you to do, Jack? And Kerry, you too. I'm looking at all you

[01:26:44] guys. Do you come to New York? Just come to New York? Just come to New York for like a couple nights.

[01:26:51] It's fun to come to in the holidays. I put this out there at everybody here. Just come to New York.

[01:26:56] If you're coming with your family, trust me. Ask Jamie how much money I had at the Japanese

[01:27:01] Jazz Bar. Come to New York. We'll go have like an omakase, we'll go have Japanese, Jazz Bar,

[01:27:07] night, and you'll be like, I understand now. I understand this man.

[01:27:14] You will though. You'll see a level of hospitality and humbleness mixed with ego and sarcasm

[01:27:27] and prima donna behavior. All in one. It'll be great. It'll be great.

[01:27:37] My son is going to New York City next week. How old is your son? Does he want to come?

[01:27:42] I'll take anybody.

[01:27:51] Can't go hell yeah.

[01:27:55] Yeah, Hector man, we gotta talk about it. You've always invited me down there. I definitely owe you a trip.

[01:28:02] Jamie, you know, we're drinking sake with Janine and Christine.

[01:28:12] Jamie and Jamie, it was a Ben. Who was the other gentleman with us? Ben, I'm, again,

[01:28:19] one side of learning people's names three times I get it. But Jamie decided to go to bourbon

[01:28:27] while we were just drinking sake. All right, so, you know,

[01:28:34] and let me tell you what happens when you're at some place for two hours and

[01:28:39] four out of five people are drinking a 16 alcohol by volume drink

[01:28:45] when Jamie's drinking a 47 by volume alcohol drink. Let me tell you what happens.

[01:28:55] We're all going this way. He's going that way, baby. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like three

[01:29:01] after three, I think Jamie was convinced that the earth is flat. I think he became a flat

[01:29:07] author in that moment. He's like, is whiskey if the earth wasn't flat, baby,

[01:29:13] this bourbon would be curved at the rim.

[01:29:24] Yeah, I'm going to get her hammered. Don't worry, Savoy. And I will upload pictures of her

[01:29:31] to show you guys that we're using the money on Brenda. I am absolutely going to share photos

[01:29:37] of my beautiful wife tonight in the in the act of consuming alcohol. Okay. And I will share

[01:29:49] where all of your great amazing contributions went. They will be going into the consumption of alcohol

[01:29:56] most likely the form of a beautiful bottle of sake that I will share with each and every one of you.

[01:30:03] A shot of Marlowe on me. Absolutely. A shot of Malore. What is that? Jack. Should I know what that is?

[01:30:13] Sounds nice. Is it like a cognac? Is it like a port?

[01:30:18] It is a, let me look at that more and more low.

[01:30:24] It's a Chicago staple. Okay. I tell you this about sake.

[01:30:30] I find sake to be diminishing returns after like $100 on a bottle. It's like the most you'd ever

[01:30:36] have to spend in a store. My favorite sake, I love soto. The white bottle of soto. It's not expensive.

[01:30:48] In a store, it's like $35, $40. At a restaurant, it'll be $100. But the soto. The dry,

[01:30:54] June mine. Love it. There's a snow white bottle. That's just about $100 a bottle. Probably.

[01:31:03] I don't know how it could be any more delicious. And that's the thing is like,

[01:31:10] it's like sake when it's chilled, which most sake is. Hot sake is usually cheaper.

[01:31:17] It's just so delicious and dry. I'm not one of these people that's going to swoosh it around in my

[01:31:27] mouth and know the difference between $100 and $200 a bottle. To me, it's just against diminishing

[01:31:31] return. You will not be more satisfied if you spend double. But you will definitely notice

[01:31:38] the difference between a $20, $30 bottle and $100 bottle of sake. But after that, I don't think you

[01:31:44] notice much difference. I was bummed out. Then I let you guys go. My favorite cognac is

[01:31:49] Paradees. Louis Trey is fine. But you're paying for the bottle. You're paying. It's too much.

[01:31:53] Yeah. And whenever I went through my bottle of Louis Trey, now I use this as a vessel to store my

[01:31:58] pre-mixed Manhattan mix. So when you come over, that ain't Louis Trey in there. It's my Manhattan

[01:32:03] mix. But like, Paradees was my favorite because it was like $800. And like, it was like a splurge,

[01:32:10] $800. And you know, like, I don't think Louis Trey is any better than Paradees, right?

[01:32:16] Now it's $1,500 a bottle. Like, like, why I went to the liquor store. I'm like,

[01:32:20] what, what, what, what, how's this $700 more? I was like, don't make me choose between a

[01:32:26] stern topper and a bottle of cognac because I'd rather have the bottle of cognac.

[01:32:32] Making memories with friends drinking that bottle will always be more satisfying.

[01:32:38] You know, the little dirty secret about toppers is nobody looks up at them ever when you own the game.

[01:32:43] You see them in the room. Yeah. But whenever there's like an interactive topper thing happening,

[01:32:47] you're like, I don't even know. I can't even, you're looking down. It's a, it's a, it's a game where

[01:32:53] you're looking down. And they sell you expensive stuff to look up at. You want amazing content,

[01:33:03] record you and Brenda taking shots of, oh man. Do they have it at every bar, Jack? Or is it like

[01:33:11] only in Manhattan? So my Manhattan mix is amazing. It's, it's, it's one best Manhattan mix in the

[01:33:17] country one year at an amazing restaurant. It's a steakhouse in a, I think it's called

[01:33:25] it's in Detroit. It's in like the, the fancy hotel in Detroit. I think it's called like,

[01:33:31] I want to say prime is the name of the steakhouse or like, no, it's got something, it's something

[01:33:36] else like, like, let me see, like, like, like, fire or pit or something like the trait, fancy,

[01:33:44] Detroit type in, fancy, Detroit steakhouse.

[01:33:59] Yeah, prime, it's prime, yeah, prime proper is the name of it. I was right. Prime proper,

[01:34:07] maybe it was number nine, but I think it's prime proper. So it's called the MinNightman had it.

[01:34:12] It's beautiful drink. Sweet, delicious. It's like, you take wood-fred reserve and then you take like,

[01:34:24] it's like two ounces of wood-fred reserve, like an ounce of cherry liquor, an ounce of orange liquor.

[01:34:32] And then a half an ounce of Italian Amaru and then like four dashes of orange bitters.

[01:34:46] You'll be messed up and you'll be loving it and you'll drink it like,

[01:34:52] big cube in the middle in the shaker, get a nice and cold. Yeah.

[01:34:58] I think at the end of our lives, if you saw like a receipt that had all the booze, you bought,

[01:35:07] you'd be like, hmm, that guy lived a good life. You know, these kids who don't drink, man,

[01:35:15] I get it, but like, it's not about, to me, it's about like, it's the social lubricant, you know,

[01:35:23] but you gotta be careful. Alcoholism is a real problem. Drinking and driving is a real problem.

[01:35:28] And when you live in a suburb, I've noticed this like, overconsumption is a real issue.

[01:35:34] It ruins people's lives, it ruins marriages, it ruins relationships, it gotta be careful.

[01:35:39] You gotta pick your battles, pick your moments, no when to indulge, no when to retreat.

[01:35:47] And the thing about life and I mean this, it's balance, you know, I still go to the gym four days

[01:35:51] a week, I still work out, I don't use, you know, now everyone's like, like, like skinny because

[01:35:58] they're just taking shortcuts and like, I get it. Like, if you could jab a needle and all the

[01:36:02] sun and you lose 100 pounds in a year, you don't have to work out once, like, sure, but I love food

[01:36:07] too much. So I work hard to maintain a decent physique, but I do enjoy a nice cocktail.

[01:36:13] Actually kind of more of a fan of an old-fashioned lately versus them in Hatton. The Manhattan's a

[01:36:18] little bit, you know, causes cancer, it says, you know, that's not exactly like, I think what causes

[01:36:25] more cancer is processed foods and stress. So I don't know, I mean, you know, there's data that

[01:36:36] to support that Kelly, there's data to support people like George Burns living to be 100,

[01:36:40] smoking cigars and drinking every day. So like, it is what it is. Also like, we're all gonna die,

[01:36:47] and life is really short and I don't want to go through life, like, not indulging in things I

[01:36:52] enjoy. And then look, and again, each their own, each their own. But I don't think these kids are

[01:36:57] not drinking because it causes cancer, Kelly. I think the kids are not drinking because they don't

[01:37:01] like to get drunk and like, do stupid stuff. But youth is defined by doing stupid stuff. And stupid

[01:37:10] stuff is how you meet people. It's how you make out with a girl that becomes your wife. You know,

[01:37:16] I'm saying, they literally, they, and they just, they, no one comes in hung over, no one,

[01:37:19] no one's parting, no one's, it's like, they're not, I don't know, like, maybe to them enjoying life is

[01:37:23] like, just coizing up by the fire and reading a book, cool. Not gonna make babies that way.

[01:37:28] Anyway, everybody. Yeah, well, you know, it's not just about the cameras are an issue too. I mean,

[01:37:37] I sometimes I'm like, man, man, if they recorded that, I think, yeah, I hate cameras, man.

[01:37:45] I hate that way we gave everybody like, up the phone that just distracts them from everything

[01:37:52] else going on in front of their face. Not tonight, though. Tonight's going to be a moment. You

[01:37:56] guys are going to see tonight's going to be a moment in the, in the Canadian world. It's going to be

[01:38:00] a good day. I wish each and every one of you health and happiness during the holidays may all of you

[01:38:05] hopefully put down the work starting sometime maybe late next week and be present with your families

[01:38:12] and really, you know, enjoy them, especially for those of us that I'm looking at Jack here and

[01:38:15] some of us with young kids, Hector, a lot of us are in that beautiful period where we get to enjoy

[01:38:21] the holidays through the eyes of a child and there's nothing more beautiful than that. And,

[01:38:25] you know, you really only get 10 years of seeing the world through the eyes of a child that is the

[01:38:31] most beautiful thing ever. And then they become teenage assholes and they tell you how the world works

[01:38:37] and then they get pregnant. So enjoy it while last. Let's all, let's all have a fun December, okay.

[01:38:47] I need proof of the, I'm doing it where I'm sharing, I'm sharing the bill, I'm sharing

[01:38:52] how much money do we raise in total? Let's see. I think I can

[01:38:58] do, do, do, I think. I don't know if I can tell you. There's at least 200 here. Here we go.

[01:39:07] We have about, I want to say we have about, I think probably 350 bucks. I can't see it on. I don't

[01:39:27] know if you guys can. Everybody be good, Jamie be good, give Janine my best. I love that name. I

[01:39:35] love the way she spells it. All right, later.
