[00:00] Well we're living here in Nallet Town

[00:04] and they're posting all the factories down

[00:15] Welcome to episode 36 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:19] It's been a while since we've last had a podcast and I'm sorry for the delay everyone

[00:24] There has just been some crazy crap going on in my personal life that I had to deal with

[00:28] Long story short my my dear uncle has had

[00:33] Some elderly abuse happening with him where this crazy woman has tried to move into his world and disrupt everything and

[00:41] Take over his apartment and all this crazy shit that I've been dealing with I mean it's been a crazy sort of 72 hours for me

[00:47] But but I'm handling that I'm stepping in and it's just much more important than pinball

[00:51] But here we are we're back

[00:53] Let's talk some pinball. This is gonna be an interesting episode and a fun episode because we get to talk to

[00:59] Everyone's favorite guests of the show Ted and

[01:01] Canada and Ted took a trip to Allen Town this past weekend

[01:05] We went down on Saturday. We had a lot of fun

[01:08] I'm gonna give a few takeaways from the show before I air the interview for you guys to listen to and you're gonna love it

[01:15] First takeaway is this

[01:17] It's a fun pinball show, but what makes every pinball show fun are the people

[01:21] I really I go for you know

[01:23] I go for the people more than the pins and when I hear people whining on the form about a lot of the machines

[01:28] We're taking out on Saturday and yada yada yada

[01:32] It's yes some machines may have been turned off or might have been sold but

[01:36] You guys are a bunch of babies if you complain about that because there are still tons of pins to play and it's tons of fun

[01:41] And it's really the people that you're there to hang out with and see and enjoy pinball that makes it entertaining

[01:47] So if you're going there solo just wanting to play pins you're not gonna have as much fun as if you go with a bunch of friends and enjoy the show

[01:54] Ted and I did not feel they were a lot of games by the show by any means plus

[01:57] What's great about the show is the lines never that long in Allen Town

[02:00] You can jump on all the popular pins and get on them pretty quickly had a lot of fun doing that

[02:04] There's a ton of vendors there

[02:06] Across the street there's this great food market where you can just

[02:10] Sample foods from all over the world. It's like Epcot center inside this big hanger

[02:14] Pretty incredible

[02:15] So definitely worth the trip. I think you'll have a good time

[02:18] I know it was definitely worth the $17 admission. I plan on going every year

[02:23] It even makes me think twice about going to some of these other shows around the country

[02:28] But I'm still gonna travel for pinball. That's that's gonna happen

[02:32] So without further ado, Ted and I had a mission to make this a really quick interview

[02:36] Because we're getting a little tired of all these really long long long chats and podcasts

[02:41] I was even thinking I might just interview Ted from the car on the way there

[02:46] I was listening to the pinball podcast last week. I think it was Jeff

[02:50] Recorded a podcast while he was driving to go play ghost busters that he was super excited to to see

[02:56] Oh, but oh man Jeff. I gotta give you some advice brother

[02:59] It sounds like you're jumping out of an airplane when you record that podcast

[03:02] It was like an hour and a half of him just talking with this like really loud noise because he's driving. I mean come on

[03:09] You can share your thoughts when you've parked and you have a quiet environment. This is a podcast

[03:15] It doesn't add any effect because we hear the wind noise

[03:18] But anyway, here's the interview with Ted enjoy it

[03:21] He's an awesome guest

[03:23] Episode 36 of Canadian pinball podcast. Let's roll the tape ladies and gentlemen

[03:27] I want to introduce back to Canada's pinball podcast Ted for what he is saying is gonna be the shortest

[03:32] Canadian interview ever which I think he's gonna be right. What do we want to do 20 minutes 25 minutes at most?

[03:37] I think we can say goodbye right now. That's it. It's over. Congratulations. Thank you

[03:43] All right, so Ted and I went to Allentown pinfest this previous weekend

[03:48] And we wanted to talk about our thoughts on the show and then cover off on some things that have happened in the form and in the community

[03:54] so Ted

[03:55] What was it like in a car with canada for three hours in one day? I mean you? Yeah, oh

[04:01] I was just

[04:04] It was good

[04:05] It would have been probably better in the hellcat

[04:07] But it's not bad riding in that chariot that you brought. Yeah, so we

[04:12] We took the big bends my mom's car because I didn't want someone to like destroy my hellcat

[04:17] Because I know you guys know what I drive so we were protecting the kitty cat

[04:22] I don't get that show. I don't think anything to worry about now. You never know. You never know

[04:27] So anyway, Ted and I drove up to Allentown took us about a little

[04:30] About a now and a half to get there from from Ted's house and so Ted

[04:34] I wanted to know like just your thoughts on the show just overall and then I was I was gonna give my thoughts like what did you think of?

[04:39] Well, I've been going to the show now for years

[04:43] So I mean it was you know pretty pretty much the same the shame of it was I feel bad for some of the people there because of the of the weather the rain

[04:51] You know, it's always nice having that outdoor flea market thing and unfortunately the weather was was pretty bad

[04:57] Both days and we only went down on Saturday

[05:00] Also finding out that most of the deals are had on Thursday

[05:04] When they get that when people get down there to unpack evidently somebody told me that there's a big run on the trucks

[05:10] That you know the dealers make deals with each other for a lot of stuff before anything even gets put out on the floor

[05:16] But you know, I guess that happens anywhere in any flea market or any any kind of sail thing like that

[05:20] So I mean I guess it's okay, but the weather was was bad everyone was inside

[05:25] Um, so that wasn't good. I went down there. I only wanted to do three things when I was there

[05:31] I want to play Ghostbusters

[05:32] I wanted to play Game of Thrones and I wanted to play Walking Dead and I even wore my walking dead

[05:38] Hawaiian shirt

[05:40] Got to play Ghostbusters, which I thought was fantastic got to play Game of Thrones

[05:44] I thought was good. I put as much time in on that, but I thought it was a good game

[05:48] Oddly enough nobody had a walking dead nobody

[05:52] I asked everybody there nobody had a walking dead. So that was a little disappointing

[05:56] I didn't get to play that yeah two out of three ain't bad and I know

[06:00] Ted was really looking forward to walking dead and I was surprised that it wasn't there

[06:04] I mean there was a lot of new stirons there, but that one just it seemed like maybe I don't know

[06:09] Maybe one sold Thursday and got out of there, but there just wasn't any to play on the floor

[06:13] Which I know was upsetting, but we'll have to get you on one of those soon. I mean that it's it's it's been out long enough

[06:20] Yeah, and I asked a few people they said they didn't see one there the the whole time

[06:23] So I said well, you know what let me go over and play big mabowski and on Saturday

[06:28] I mean, I don't know if anybody can try him in well, it was nobody here but me and you

[06:32] But it was the machine was down the whole time. Yeah, we're gonna we're gonna talk about that because I had some thoughts on that

[06:38] And I know we discussed that

[06:41] So let's talk about in you mentioned that a lot of the deals are done Thursday and I've read on the forum

[06:47] A lot of chatter with that reality that people come Thursday to set up for the show

[06:53] And I heard people this year they almost had a wait around all day long

[06:56] Because they couldn't set up a lot of the show until 6 p.m. On Thursday

[06:59] So people got there like in the morning and had to wait all day to set up which seemed like a nightmare

[07:04] But the dealing the wheeling and the dealing can take place before the show even opens right?

[07:10] Personally, I don't have a problem with that. I think that we see on the community

[07:13] You know people are only gonna bring a pen to the show

[07:17] If it's even sold before the show it's more almost more like a drop-off point right to for the seller to meet their buyer

[07:24] And exchange money for the pen right so a lot of that

[07:27] That's not what I thought was the bad part. I mean, I know that goes on

[07:31] What I probably neglected to say was that they told me that some people they

[07:35] Will and deal and trade or buy the machines right there at the show and then sell them try to flip them for more money right there at the show

[07:42] All right, we so they'll go in make a deal real quick

[07:44] You know have that machine at the show and try to flip it for more money right there at the show which

[07:48] Eh, so we saw that there was a tails of the Arabian Knights that someone told me sold on Friday for like 5500

[07:57] And was listed for sale the next day same game for 6500 or 6800

[08:04] And yeah, and it's still and I know that like pisses people off, but

[08:08] What no one was gonna buy it the that tails the Arabian Knights look like the biggest route it pieces shit version of that game

[08:14] I'd ever seen

[08:15] But again, they're trying to get someone who doesn't know any better

[08:19] Who might have loved the game when they were younger to walk into that show and buy it right

[08:25] So I hope well and there was also like a lot

[08:27] I think the other issue right is that and we came on Saturday so there's a lot of issues of like people

[08:33] Turning games off that sold and willing them out of there and I know the the rule is if you're going to shut your game off before the show ends and and sell it

[08:42] There's a $25 fee for taking your pin off the floor. What were your thoughts walking in Saturday? Did you feel like there wasn't a lot there?

[08:51] Did you feel like there was a lot there to play? What were your thoughts? No, I thought I thought there was plenty there to play

[08:56] I mean get to play everything you know, I wanted to but I thought there were a lot of games there and

[09:01] Yeah, I thought the show was fine. It was either it was as good if not maybe a little bigger than than other shows

[09:08] Um, let's put this one. There was a lot right that happened there. I got to see

[09:12] Uh some people that I I never met before I got to see Joe from laser rific

[09:16] Which I never saw before and so we had a chance to chat

[09:20] um

[09:21] You know rob and and and Greg were there with Rockland pinball

[09:25] Uh, they by saturday by the time we got there

[09:27] They sold all but like I think three or four of their games

[09:30] So it was it was some like hotcakes

[09:33] Uh, we got to hang out of course with Mark with the barbecue. We did we did shots. We did uh, we did some hot dogs

[09:40] And then uh me you I think uh, Mike and Nelson went over to the farmers market to the mexican place which the food was was phenomenal

[09:49] uh

[09:50] You know, so that was a lot of good stuff right and well, I want to agree with Ted because I thought when I walked in their saturday

[09:58] I did not feel like there weren't a lot of pins. I felt like they're I I was actually really impressed because

[10:04] Every single major pin that I flew all the way down to Texas to play at Texas pinball festival was at

[10:12] Pinfest in allentown, right? And I was really impressed because you could hop on at ghost buzzers

[10:16] I know they're shipping already so there's more pros

[10:18] But it was easier to play ghost busters hobbit

[10:22] Rob zombie. I mean rob zombie was just sitting there the le and it was easy to hop on

[10:27] There was usually maybe a line of of a person or two, but that's it within 10 minutes

[10:32] You're on every machine you want to play so I thought I did not feel like it was difficult to to to play pins

[10:39] Or there was a shortage of pins that I wanted to play at all

[10:42] Yeah, no, I thought it was I thought it was just just right there. I mean there wasn't any real long lines on anything

[10:48] It was great. Uh, you got to play at the remake of medieval madness and they had a big bang bar there

[10:53] Which was uh, which was fantastic. So um

[10:57] You know, I got to play a little bit the medieval madness. It looked great and you know played great

[11:02] So yeah, we played uh

[11:04] Tim and I and we had a and Nelson we were playing medieval madness remake at Rockland's booth and big bang bar

[11:10] Now I'll say this medieval madness remake

[11:13] Amazing looking pin, but I will say this too the inserts look like shit for those of you have been whining about how the insert the ink is all poorly done

[11:22] You're right. I would not accept a game with such bad insert ink. So I'll leave you guys with that

[11:28] But did you see Ted that they sold the big bang bar on?

[11:31] So they did yeah, so they they put it up for sale on pin side

[11:35] Get this for 15,500 which I think is the steal of the century for that pin because that pin at the show was gorgeous

[11:42] Yes, yeah

[11:43] I I played that pin because that was up at Rockland pinball. So so yeah, now that was that was fantastic

[11:50] You know, I love that game. I'm you know, I just

[11:54] 15 16 grand is just you know for me too much to pay for a pinball machine

[11:59] But for a poster, but I wouldn't pay it for a pinball. It's very much looking forward to the Ghostbusters

[12:06] Ellie or premium

[12:07] Because I thought the Ghostbusters pro and I don't want to even play the pro on anything

[12:13] Only if I have to because I would never get a pro as opposed to a premium or an Ellie

[12:19] So I and the pro was fun on Ghostbusters. I can't wait to play the premium or the Ellie and that that may be a pin

[12:27] I might get right it was funny because when we were driving there Ted is like I only play the premium and Ali's of games

[12:32] I'm not gonna play Ghostbusters pro and I'm like you had your mind like we walk in there. It's right there

[12:37] And there's no line. Yeah, it's like

[12:40] Well, I think you know

[12:42] Your response to Ghostbusters and I've been reading

[12:45] Every thread about Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters versus Hobbit and all the different comparisons

[12:50] I have to say

[12:51] After playing it in Texas and playing it again

[12:54] I really am excited by this pin. I don't think there's another pin that I played at the show

[12:59] Within just a couple minutes the music the art the call-outs the gameplay. It's addictive

[13:05] It's hard, but it's addictive game right? I mean, I just thought it was a blast. It was good

[13:10] You know, I played you know probably about maybe 20 different games there and you know

[13:14] I almost bought a target alpha. There was one there that was in pretty nice shape

[13:18] And I love you know things I need on a pinball machine

[13:21] I like to have dropped targets. I need a kick out hole

[13:24] You know, I need a couple of those those you know old-fashioned

[13:27] I care about that stuff more than I do with ramps and I just always like the target alpha type

[13:32] You know, there wasn't a centigrade 37 there either so um and I don't think I saw a scared stiff there either now

[13:38] No scared stiff there's there was like five condos. I feel like I saw there

[13:43] And then there's just like rows of ems now. I'm not an e-man myself because they just I don't know

[13:49] I do you like ems? I just feel like they're they're different error. They all sort of seem the same to me

[13:54] I think there's some great ones. I mean centigrade 37. I love and and there's that one

[13:59] I think you forget in the name of it won't the cards where they have the cards in the back glass lined up

[14:04] And when you hit them the cards drop down

[14:06] I might be like king of hearts or king of spades or whatever. That was I don't know what it's in but it's a very cool game

[14:12] um

[14:14] You know but I just I just worry because I don't know how to fix them that yeah

[14:19] There's so much stuff in there. It's not just gonna go wrong and I'm gonna be stuck

[14:21] So speaking of fixing pins. Let's talk about let's talk about the big libous give you because

[14:26] The pen is shipping. I was excited to play it and you know

[14:30] Ted and I are walking around and and and there is like the Dutch pinball gentleman and like two other guys

[14:36] Just sort of leaning on the play field glass and looks like the boot screen was up on them on this on the

[14:42] Display but it was down and we thought we're eating dinner up right they were having a

[14:48] A price fix dinner on the machine

[14:50] But but what we were saying and we were saying to each other like it's really embarrassing though

[14:55] It sucks and we get it like pinball machines are finicky

[14:58] Devices but when you bring a pen to a show it really is unfortunate when

[15:04] The pen has problems at a show because that is only have one of them only one it's broken

[15:09] And it's like a moment because most of the people who come through the show you know

[15:14] What was it $17 to get in most of those people are not on pinside?

[15:18] They're not like fanatics. They want to see the pinball machines

[15:21] They want to enjoy them and their potential customers for all those machines

[15:25] And I always find it disappointing when I see a brand new machine is brand new

[15:29] You know these guys have had two years to engineer this thing to work and when it's broken

[15:33] It would make me nervous if I was in on that pin and I saw that I wouldn't feel great

[15:39] Yeah, you know what I

[15:41] We don't have a tree. It's broke. It doesn't matter. What could have possible?

[15:46] It's horrible. I could have happened

[15:47] I was very disappointed I couldn't play it but but I'm just saying

[15:50] If we don't know if some momo did something or just thing hit a bump and something shorted out

[15:55] We really don't know what happened

[15:57] Yeah, it's a shame it's horrible that was down

[15:59] But you know what do you mean hit a bum? It's not on a truck here. We're this thing's on solid ground

[16:04] Anyway, it was down. We didn't get to play it. Did you play hobbit?

[16:07] I didn't ask if you because we separated a lot and walked around. Did you get to yeah?

[16:11] Yeah, I like hobbit. I think hobbit is is a lot of fun

[16:14] I mean there's certainly a lot of stuff to do on hobbit

[16:18] It's a beautiful machine and it you know it plays great

[16:21] I think hobbit is fantastic

[16:23] And I'm very much looking forward to the

[16:26] Whatever the new game is this coming out which brings me to another thing

[16:30] Two things actually number one

[16:32] I guess most of the people are listening know that I started you know working with my friend that has that that plexi cutting machine

[16:37] And I really thought they'd be a lot of people a couple people have we've done some some backlasses have done some speaker panels

[16:44] Uh a done a few plastics

[16:46] But I'll tell you I thought the rare stuff that people have been looking for

[16:50] I thought that there would be so much stuff

[16:52] You know people would be asking about it's maybe like one person a week

[16:56] You know says hey look

[16:57] I really need to do this backlash or I need to do a speaker panel or I can't find it's a rare when I can't find it

[17:02] I get in the art

[17:03] But I'm very surprised that people really didn't uh

[17:06] You know use that to be able to make a really beautiful plexi class

[17:10] uh, you know backless

[17:12] It's just you know so much better than just a translate but

[17:15] But whatever we'll see you know, we'll see what happens

[17:17] Maybe if I you know a couple more things uh done

[17:20] And the other thing is is is

[17:23] Many many years ago we've had during the pinball parties

[17:26] We had conversations about about two different things because I didn't really know enough about this stuff

[17:31] But I always thought it was kind of strange and was always asking

[17:33] Why don't they just remake the popular machines and everybody said back then they had a whole litany of reasons

[17:39] Why you couldn't do it and of course now they can and the other thing was I said okay, well if not that

[17:44] Yeah, let's you take a popular machine. Let's say like um uh attack from Mars

[17:48] Well people love the the the flying saucers the Martian so just do a machine called you know invaders from Mars or

[17:54] Or something like that and just do another machine filled with you know aliens and spaceships and ray guns and stuff and

[18:00] You just just take the kind of stuff that's popular and make a machine like that why there was such this big

[18:06] Oh, what are they gonna do next? What what the theme they're gonna do about this?

[18:09] Why don't they just do they know that kind of stuff is popular?

[18:12] Just do a machine that's similar to attack from Mars. I mean or big bang bar. I don't you mean revenge from Mars?

[18:22] But right now I mean not that right no I look I

[18:25] House what the hell it is. I mean a real Pibble on machine. I'm calling you know invaders from Mars or invasion from

[18:30] Right over the hell at least but just fill it full of flying saucers and Martians and all kinds of crazy things

[18:35] How could it not be a hit that's what people want? Well, no, I agree

[18:39] I think there's a whole market for like the next version of cactus cannon or follow up to even

[18:44] I mean, I imagine a follow-up even to Adam's family or follow up to yeah, I think you know, I think pop it

[18:50] That's a licensed thing. I'm talking about an unlicensed thing

[18:52] Here's another question and and I wish that at one point we can get

[18:57] Someone on here whether that's a real pinball expert or someone like Ben Hacker one of these guys

[19:02] They really picked their brain because I'm really wondering at what point

[19:05] How popular because now there's like six or seven manufacturers making machines at what point of the Japanese or China get gonna get involved in this

[19:13] And start making machines just looking at what we do take the thing apart retro shwans it and and and pop out machines for three grand or four grand

[19:22] That are gonna you know be pretty good. I have no idea why they haven't done it yet. I'll tell you why I'll tell you why

[19:28] 30,000 anymore, but but still there's gonna be money there. I'll tell you why

[19:33] Tell me because only two pinball companies actually make money. Oh

[19:39] Shit, I'm gonna call spooky right now. Hold on there. They're the second one. Oh

[19:45] Who's the number one is Stern? Oh come on Jersey jacks make it money

[19:49] You you think they're turning a profit

[19:53] I think they had to get financially bailed out

[19:59] Okay, I don't think they'd have the investors there investing in a company that was that was losing money every month

[20:05] I think they're turning a profit. I think they got investors to bail them out to get back to a point where they could keep making it

[20:12] I think without those investors

[20:14] You never see the hobbit you know what

[20:17] Talking like this is really means nothing because we really don't know

[20:22] We have no idea what their finances were we have no idea what the situation was all we can do is guess and me

[20:29] I'd rather guess on the positive side than than negative side because we really really don't know

[20:34] So you know

[20:36] I hope they do well. That's all I can say right you're absolutely correct and we will we all we can do is speculate right

[20:43] We cannot make absolute on any of these assumptions. So did you um going back to the show?

[20:47] Did you happen to see the pinball refinery version of Ghostbusters with the white armor?

[20:54] You know I looked at it

[20:57] It looked so you did see it you looked at it

[21:01] You did okay. Yeah, I mean it was fine. I saw the thing that said pinball refinery on I looked at I said what looks fantastic

[21:08] What do you think of the package of the white with the with the machine?

[21:12] Um, it wouldn't be my choice. I mean I prefer that I would prefer some kind of model drippy green

[21:20] um

[21:21] Like I know pincrum I had done some stuff for me for scared stiff and I he could probably work crazy stuff with there

[21:27] Maybe to give it some kind of

[21:29] Slimey molten sort of green color, but I'd prefer the green color to the to the white, but that's just me right now

[21:36] No, I I would agree. I think the Ellie green looks good

[21:38] I know some people out there just like are vehemently opposed to green armor and I get it it like sticks out like

[21:45] A sore thumb it's it's like someone said to me at the show. It's like driving a green car

[21:50] You don't want to do it every day, but when you are in it, it can be fun at at times

[21:55] I thought the white armor was interesting because I saw that when

[21:59] Steve from pinball refinery had sort of asked people what they wanted to see in a refinery edition

[22:06] There was a lot of back and forth on colors and white because of the you know the ghost buster is ecto one car and stay puff

[22:13] Whites and whites the color of a ghost a lot of people wanted that

[22:17] I have to say though seeing it in person it did look like it washed out the colors a little bit because almost because like white is such a

[22:24] It's you know white's not a color it, but it's it's so bright that your eye goes to it

[22:30] um, I thought it sort of diluted from zombie yeti's color palette and his patterns and

[22:36] So we'll see I mean, I think they're gonna offer a few versions, but um, I know that stern

[22:41] Ellie sold out or read and in fact

[22:44] You know that I've got one and for you guys out there who are looking for an Ellie

[22:48] Look no further because canada has posted his on ebay

[22:53] For the buy it now bargain price of twelve thousand dollars now ten do you mister? Do you think that is not a bargain?

[23:00] I mean it is if there's only five hundred it's got different artwork

[23:05] And I'm accepting best offers. I'm accepting best offers. I've been getting offers anywhere from a lot of nine thousand dollar offers

[23:13] And then a lot of offers for twenty bucks

[23:18] You know what you should screw them you should take the order for twenty bucks and sit on the machine when it comes

[23:23] I should just to show them right

[23:26] I can't wait to play it a couple of my friends are getting them and I really really can't wait to play this game

[23:31] Again, I don't really care about the Ellie the premium is fine for me

[23:35] And I think they're probably gonna be making those for a while

[23:38] So you know, I'm not in a big hurry. I'll plenty of time to play it and see you know what I want to do by that time

[23:43] Of course, we'll know what Jersey Jax is a third game is by that time. Hopefully we'll know

[23:49] What the next remake is gonna be because I would very much like to either have you know attack from Mars or or big bang bar or

[23:57] Monster Bash

[23:58] You know, so we'll we'll know a lot of things hopefully by by that time right and I know you're still really looking forward to alien

[24:04] Now I was in the thread recently and it seemed like the whole star there's a bunch

[24:09] There's a bunch of just crazy lords pictures. I was happy. I was like these are the best updates. We've had in months

[24:13] Uh, are you still you still waiting on that you still sort of have yeah

[24:18] Hey, look if it plays fantastic. I mean, I love the theme

[24:22] um, you know, so it's just gonna be one of these things that we're just gonna have to again

[24:26] We can't speculate on it. We have to see what it looks like with a populated play field and see how the play is on it and

[24:33] It's gonna be good. That's fantastic. If not, you know

[24:36] What are you gonna do? So that's not what we're just gonna have to wait and see right now. I agree

[24:40] I agree. I'm waiting to see the populated play field. There's nothing really left to talk about until we see that um

[24:44] Do you think that with Ghostbusters sort of getting the reception? It's got and it's been overwhelmingly positive

[24:51] Uh, do you feel it's really hard to compete with Ghostbusters now for the other come

[24:57] A lot of them are you know, their pins are shipping right now right when Ghostbusters is shipping

[25:01] What are your thoughts like do you think some of them are gonna have a hard time moving volume if if there's a

[25:06] A lot of people are gonna start selling

[25:09] You know stuff. I mean it seems there's a whole bunch of people that have a lot of machines

[25:14] And they're right at that that limit because there's so much good stuff coming out

[25:19] That if they're right at the limit that if they're gonna get one they got a move one or two or if they don't want to spend the money

[25:23] They you know want to sell a couple of them to finance

[25:26] These these new games because I mean let's face it the these are really cool games. I mean Ghostbusters

[25:32] I think is is just gonna be I mean like I said I hate the pros and I had fun playing Ghostbusters pro

[25:38] So so it's uh, I can only imagine what the uh the early of the premiums gonna be like

[25:43] I think it's gonna end up being one of their best sellers ever

[25:46] It just is a real fun theme

[25:48] Yeah, I heard from from someone who knows someone that it was it's been their

[25:54] Fastest selling Ellie ever and they've been getting more orders on premiums than any other machine

[26:01] They've they've sold premiums on so it is oh wait a minute they they uh they have that guy I forget his name

[26:07] Johnny danger or Johnny

[26:10] Did the video on the Ellie?

[26:12] How to look yeah, I mean I I watched all

[26:16] Two hours of that video or an hour and a half

[26:19] It looked great, you know, it look it's it's one of those things though with the Magnuslings

[26:23] It's really hard to even even when you're watching it to understand how it's really gonna play for you

[26:29] I and I think that

[26:31] They're their responses were all really positive um the Ectogoggles, which is another thing that's on the premium

[26:38] I mean I thought they look cool the stern put up a video of of how it looks you can see it on their Facebook page for those of you who are curious

[26:46] You know, it's not gonna like blow your mind. It's it's very much of like the hologram sort of

[26:51] Shining down on glass the way pinball 2000 worked um, but it's cool like I

[26:57] Looks like there's a thing there like three days you know

[27:01] Yeah, I mean I look I

[27:03] It's not looking at the 3 day where it's hard to video record the effect of something like that

[27:07] Well, here's what I'll say though about those buttons

[27:10] Regardless of the Magnuslings and the Ectogoggles and the and the really cool subway ramp that goes underneath the playfield and the ball comes back up

[27:18] Um and in the physical ball lock

[27:21] Ghostbusters pro is just jammed packed with toys. I mean it's the thing is just already in its base form so much fun to shoot

[27:30] So I think the premium LA is just it's icing on an amazing cake so um, you know

[27:35] There should be so many mods on on this Ghostbusters game

[27:38] It's like they're just they're just starting to come out one a day on those it's it's gonna be fantastic

[27:43] Yeah

[27:44] So put the lights in the car and put the lights on the slimer in the building they still have to do in the background

[27:50] It's really gonna be uh, it's really gonna be a lot of fun

[27:53] I think someone said it best on one of the threads that just said you know when I play the game and I hear the theme song

[27:58] And I hear the call out like we got one and the bells are ringing and it just

[28:03] transports people back to why they love that franchise like within just a few minutes which is

[28:10] Really incredible and I think you know when I look at the other pins that are competing for the doll

[28:15] You know, I think it is harder to give people that immediate gratification that Ghostbusters has done

[28:21] So I think people are excited. I think the game is gonna be a success and I think it's overall

[28:28] It's just fun and I think that needs to be the primary focus of all pinball machines is like can we make it as fun as possible?

[28:36] Yeah, I'm just hoping that uh, I read somewhere that

[28:41] Dennis and his partner are gonna be doing another machine after the uh, wo nnelli

[28:47] I mean, I can always hope that it's a

[28:50] Third scared stiff would be would be fantastic. I mean a third Elvira game which would be fantastic

[28:55] But um, I wasn't I didn't know if that was for sure or not

[28:58] But I read it somewhere. Maybe it was in pinball news or something that they said they are gonna be doing another game after

[29:04] After wo nnelli

[29:06] So that's gonna be fun. Yeah, I mean it sounds like wo nnelli was

[29:11] And there's a lot of stuff um, you know, they'll definitely I think want to keep designing games

[29:17] I mean that all the designers that are out there right I mean we've got a

[29:21] plethora of people who have experience making pinball machines

[29:25] I mean they don't want to stop. I mean this has got to be a great moment for those guys too who you know

[29:30] They really went through a period of like 15 years where their craft was dying right there wasn't much demand for it and

[29:38] They had probably have a lot of ideas in their head that they had a

[29:41] You know put on the shelf and and put in the rola decks that you know waiting for a time when they could actually make those designs

[29:47] So now I think it's open season. I think if you have a pinball design and you want to get something out there

[29:52] Now's the time to do it because the market's hot

[29:55] Do they know for sure what the next machines are from stern?

[29:59] They know for sure it's gonna be arosmith or then star wars or is that or is that just a real aroma?

[30:04] Yeah, I mean if you go to pinside they know they know for sure, but it's all rumors

[30:08] It's okay, but but the most of the rumors have

[30:12] Panned out when it comes to what stern's working on so arosmith star wars

[30:16] I saw there was a thread on pinside how many star wars Ellie should they make and I'm like really we're talking about this already

[30:23] Can't we just enjoy ghost busters Ellie and wait but but that's the nature of the

[30:29] I've seemed to realize that

[30:31] And I think we talked about this a little bit in the car was was that I think 90

[30:36] Plus percent of the time that they're the rumors about the machines really seem to be to be true

[30:41] I think what would we say the other one of blindsided people was that that wrestling? Yeah, WWWWW

[30:48] Nobody saw coming and then when they saw coming they wish they never saw it coming

[30:54] That was the that was a

[30:56] Car must think

[30:58] Must think that they that was their rumor about that it was another one that slipped in there. I think people weren't really

[31:05] Talking much about or speculating with that one. I ironically those are both true-do pins that

[31:11] Sort of miss the mark for people um and what a what a comeback. He's had with ghost busters. It's yeah

[31:19] I'm just looking forward to the dominoes pin from spooky

[31:24] If I was if I was pizza had I'd buy up every one

[31:27] It's just like

[31:29] Destroyed them in the pizza oven

[31:32] Any word on when uh that pin is I'm thinking there I know they're contractually obligated to get them to dominoes by like the dominoes convention

[31:41] That's taking place. I think it's early

[31:44] I want to say 2017 or I don't know. I mean, I don't even know how many they're making

[31:49] I just thought it was a great idea. Did you play rob zombie at at Alan town? There was one there. There's an alley there

[31:54] I watched it. I watched it being played because I was running well by that time I probably had about six shots

[31:59] It'd mean to beer so I wasn't sure you know where I was but um

[32:04] I watched people playing it and I watched maybe three or four people playing and everybody seemed to really really like it

[32:09] So I played uh it looks fantastic. I mean the artwork on that is just

[32:14] It came together it came together nicely. I mean the the the I played it with Nelson

[32:19] We had a little competition

[32:21] I ended up putting up 19 million which was really good on that game

[32:24] And he was he was sort of scratching his head because he his ball times were twice as long as mine

[32:29] But I must have been hitting some stuff that was worth a lot

[32:32] uh the

[32:33] The I think the GI lighting might have been out on the machine. We were playing so it was a little dark

[32:38] But it still looked great and then the the the rob zombie music was lower than the callouts

[32:45] So here's a word of advice to everyone who's used the headset

[32:48] Used the headset or crank the shit out of it and let people just hear it like ghost busters

[32:53] What was it was it macros bet Marco specialties booth right when you walked in they had ghost busters

[32:59] Those machines were like on full volume just crank it. Are they coming? Are they coming to get you?

[33:03] What does that sound like? I hear that that's a ghost busters like I know I did

[33:08] Just the thing about recording in New York City. I'm right. I'm on 36th. So it's the entrance to the midtown tunnel

[33:14] I get all sorts of noises. Well, I think I think before we wrap this up

[33:17] I think it's time to tell people

[33:20] A very interesting thing that we might be doing one of these with some other people at the Porterhouse

[33:27] While we're sitting there smoking cigars and having some cocktails with you which should be fantastic

[33:32] So that what is Ted is referring to is our next chat will take place at the Porterhouse

[33:38] Um, we were gonna do it after Alan town, but I think both Ted and I after spending three hours in a car together plus three hours at the show

[33:48] We're kind of like the last thing we want to do now is talk about pimple at the end of the day

[33:54] uh, but we'll do it there and Ted you also have to follow up with iceman because he's supposed to come on the show for little royal rumble episode

[34:03] Uh, so make sure you hit him up and ask him like what happened?

[34:06] Okay, and I think you know what I might be mistaken

[34:08] I think I asked uh, you know Greg from Rockland pinball if you want to come on. I think he said yes

[34:13] Uh to talk about their games and everything. I think I don't remember nice

[34:17] I asked a few people and they all seem to say uh, yes um

[34:22] There's a friend of my john here has as a bunch of pinball machines, you know some some great stuff

[34:27] He also works on them as well and he'd probably come on he only lives like uh 10 minutes from here

[34:32] So uh and so is Greg

[34:34] A lot of people are really close so when we're ready we'll ask i mean again if they can't make it

[34:39] You know, we'll do it ourselves

[34:40] But if they can it would be great having you know someone there that actually actually knows something oh it's great

[34:45] Yeah, because I know that most of pinside is happy when I do interviews because it means they they get

[34:51] To hear me half as much so they uh they the more voices the merrier for some of those people

[34:57] But Ted it's always a pleasure having you on the show. It was awesome going to Alan town with you

[35:02] We'll do it every year. It's so close to both of us

[35:05] um

[35:06] And we'll we'll talk real soon from the porterhouse with uh with some whiskey and cigars in hand

[35:11] Yes, that would be great. Hopefully we'll get some people to meet us there and it'll be uh

[35:15] It'll be a free throw it'll be fantastic

[35:17] And we we went just over at 33 minutes for the interview so we're doing good here. This is a good way

[35:23] I like to keep them short. I think a half hour is fine. You know you you got to leave them wanting more

[35:28] That's it. They all want more canada. We know that all right guys. That was Ted

[35:33] That was our little Alan town recap. We will talk to you again real soon Ted. Thank you so much

[35:38] Wow

[35:39] Certainly

[35:40] All right
