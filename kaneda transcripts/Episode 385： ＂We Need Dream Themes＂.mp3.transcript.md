[00:00] I woke up this morning and I said to myself, I really would love to have one dream theme

[00:15] machine in my house.

[00:17] Just one, an iconic movie that I love more than anything that I can watch over and over

[00:26] again.

[00:28] It got me thinking about where Pimball is today and the themes that are put in front of

[00:33] us that we have to choose from.

[00:36] Are these really the Pimball machines you want or just the Pimball machines you have to

[00:43] choose from?

[00:45] Nobody wakes up and says I really want to have a luxury light speed in my house or I really

[00:50] want to have in October 5th bolted to the ground.

[00:56] Now what we want, if you're really honest I think deep down what all of us want is we

[01:03] want something like the Big Lebowski, a Pimball world under glass built inspired by related

[01:13] to completely mirroring the movie or the franchise that we love, right?

[01:19] Every element of that theme is found in the world under glass and you step up to it and

[01:25] you can't help but smile because that is the perfect representation of that theme that

[01:32] you love.

[01:33] So let's talk about that on episode 385 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[01:55] Alright kids, we'll strap in for episode 385 of Canadian Pimball Podcast, Omni or Host

[02:05] Canada and the theme of this show is how the boutique Pimball companies have just failed.

[02:12] So many of them have just failed to understand the very principle of how to be successful

[02:18] in Pimball and I'm just going to say it, the most important thing is theme and I had the

[02:24] fifth element there at the beginning of this show because to me the more I think about

[02:29] it, I think the fifth element would make the most incredible Pimball experience.

[02:34] It's one of the most incredible movies, this soundtrack is incredible, it's just one

[02:38] of the coolest films of all time and it would be perfect for Pimball, right?

[02:44] Collecting the four elements, getting the stones, you know, your Corbin Dallas, you have

[02:49] to protect Lilloo through the adventures of the movie, it would be unbelievable.

[02:54] And here's the thing, here's the thing is I don't care what it costs to get the licensing

[02:59] for this movie because you can get it.

[03:02] There's this notion that you can't, that things are cost prohibitive is BS.

[03:06] I'll tell you why, it might be really expensive but so what, go do it, figure out a way to

[03:12] make it happen.

[03:13] Alright, so here's the thing, here's why I want to talk about why I think the boutique

[03:18] Pimball companies that are out there just don't understand the market and they don't understand

[03:23] where the white space is.

[03:25] And I'm saying this because as I see the big Lebowski shipping to consumers and people

[03:30] are unboxing them this week, right?

[03:32] How quick did those games go out the door from ARA to people?

[03:35] I mean they already are arriving, which is insane.

[03:38] We'll talk a little bit about that but I don't even want to talk about the whole Lebowski

[03:42] drama.

[03:43] What I want to talk about is the simple fact that the reason why people love the big Lebowski

[03:49] so much, the Pimball game is it reflects the movie so well that it puts the Lebowski

[03:55] world under glass so well.

[03:57] And I just couldn't help but wake up this morning, have a nice coffee and think to myself

[04:02] how when you are staring at a blank piece of wood and you have a budget to make a game

[04:09] or you have a multi-million dollar company backing your Pimball venture, how do you stand

[04:15] over a blank piece of wood and say we're going to put this theme or that theme and we expect

[04:23] the game to sell.

[04:24] And the reason why I'm saying that is you know I heard that you know American Pimball,

[04:29] when they were projecting how many October fest they were going to sell.

[04:34] This is not a lie, you can ask them.

[04:36] They were projecting to sell thousands of October fest, thousands people, thousands of them.

[04:43] And so then they did all the hard work, they made the game, they put all this stuff into

[04:47] it and they won't even sell probably more than 500 when all this said and done.

[04:52] And that is the point of this podcast is how come these new Pimball companies are failing

[04:58] so horribly to understand what people want.

[05:03] Why is it so hard?

[05:04] I mean we have stern off, you know just making game after game after game, they understand

[05:10] the very principles of we're going to make games based on popular themes.

[05:15] Now I would argue that not every theme stern makes is resonating with people and is a home run

[05:22] theme.

[05:23] I don't want the monsters, it's a campy show, I don't want it.

[05:26] I don't really want another Ninja Turtles Pimball machine.

[05:30] No, like these are, here's the thing, for me it's the stuff that you can still watch over

[05:37] and over again.

[05:39] And that's why I even think like Willie Wank is a little bit of a questionable theme.

[05:42] I mean how many of you guys when Willie Wank is on TV are going to stop and watch it from

[05:47] beginning to end?

[05:48] I do, I think there's just, there's a handful of just incredible dream themes that I just

[05:55] think need to be made into Pimball machines.

[05:57] But here's why I'm going after the boutique guys right now because if you're going to

[06:00] start a Pimball company, you need your first or second game to be a home run.

[06:07] You know when I see like sun coast Pimball being like well we're only going to make 100

[06:11] cosmic carnivals, we're not going to make 250 that are signed.

[06:16] It's just another example of a company just doesn't understand.

[06:21] They don't understand what people want.

[06:23] People don't just want a different machine.

[06:26] People want something that they have to buy.

[06:29] Pimball is a impulse purchase.

[06:32] You want to have a Pimball machine in which you say I don't care what it costs.

[06:37] I need to own this Pimball machine and I just want all of you to ask yourselves are you

[06:41] getting Pimball machines over the last five six seven years that you feel have that sort

[06:48] of pull on you right?

[06:50] Are you getting your dream themes?

[06:53] Are you getting the kinds of machines that are that will be bolted to the ground and will

[06:58] never leave because it's based on something you love tremendously and the execution of

[07:04] that theme is also done so marvelously well.

[07:08] Okay.

[07:09] And the reason why I see people like climbing over each other to get big Lebowski's and

[07:13] the reason why big Lebowski was such a popular game when it was revealed a few years ago.

[07:18] It had everything that I think people have wanted in this hobby that they rarely get.

[07:24] It had their dream theme for a lot of people.

[07:26] The big Lebowski movie is a cult classic.

[07:29] I think it's voted the number one cult classic movie of all time and then you know, Dutch

[07:35] Pimball put the world under glass perfectly, perfectly.

[07:40] So when you stand over that game it just pops out at you like big Lebowski and the only

[07:45] reason we got that game and the game became so sought after was that when they made it

[07:51] they didn't really have the licensing permission to do what they did and Roger Sharp swooped

[07:55] in and helped them figure it out.

[07:57] But since then right years of gone by years of gone by I mean we've got we've got some

[08:03] big pretty big themes that have come out but look how like a lackluster they've been

[08:08] right Star Wars Star Wars the greatest entertainment property of all time probably translated

[08:15] the worst right in terms of like that movie coming to life in that pen I don't think I

[08:21] could be more disappointed in Star Wars.

[08:24] You know Batman 66 is a great game don't get me wrong I still love my Batman 66 I think

[08:29] it's one of the greatest you know code integrated games of all time but there's no denying the

[08:35] fact that physically right the physical game does not represent Batman 66 universe at all.

[08:43] I mean there's a crane in the damn game there's no crane you know there could have been

[08:47] so much more but it's still the code saves that game but where are the boutique companies

[08:54] and why can't they understand these principles okay so here's what I want to say if I'm

[08:59] American Pimble you need to make dream themes or you need to make dream themes there's no

[09:05] point in starting a Pimble company in in in 20 like anytime after 2015 without the very

[09:13] simple principle we need to make games that people like can't not buy that they they see

[09:21] it and they say you have to take my money now you know the the old CEO Ferrari he used to

[09:27] say we build cars so that when you drive them you say to yourself I only live once I need

[09:33] to own this car do these Pimble machines that are coming out these days do they make you

[09:38] feel like I only live once I need to own this Pimble machine no matter what it costs and so that

[09:44] then begs the question and look I'm not a licensing expert but why is it so hard to go make a Pimble

[09:52] machine based on some of the iconic themes like the fifth element big trouble in little China top

[09:59] gun karate kid so here's the thing you can license stuff like there is a cost associated with it

[10:06] and it might be extremely high now I'm just going to say this I don't care what it cost what I

[10:13] would do is this I would find themes that no matter the cost I know people would want would spend

[10:22] a lot of money on and I would arrange my boutique company to to factor in the cost of that license

[10:31] with all of the right mechs and assets I would need to bring that license to life and I would

[10:36] just charge as much as it would cost to make that machine see we live in this ridiculous notion

[10:44] that every single Pimble machine has to be priced between five thousand dollars or twelve thousand

[10:51] five hundred dollars it's it's it's idiocracy to me it's idiocracy to me that nobody has the guts

[10:57] to even go further up market but the only way you can go further up market it's not about

[11:03] rarity it's not about collectibility it's about dream theme if you offer someone something that

[11:11] they truly truly want you can put a higher price on it and if they know it cost you a lot of money

[11:19] right to get the rights to the fifth element to get the rights to the movie footage to get the

[11:23] rights to Bruce Willis and you know and all the actors and actresses in the movie and the soundtrack

[11:29] so okay but I'm willing to pay that right if you put it all in I'd be willing to pay more

[11:36] but we're frozen this entire hobby is just like frozen in in this notion that well everything has

[11:43] to be at the same price point and every game has to be priced competitively with stern and so what's

[11:50] happened the boutique companies have failed they're all just failing around us the only one that

[11:57] has been successful is spooky now look if you're gonna go boutique I think you have two places to go

[12:03] you go entry level which is where spooky's at and they've climbed up a little bit in price because

[12:08] they've been putting more into the game or you go at the top and the high end of the market

[12:14] and yet nobody has the guts to go there and so then what you end up with is American Pimball failing

[12:21] American Pimball trying to compete with stern at stern prices by putting more into the games but

[12:27] not realizing that theme is everything and so they're just floundering and they're gonna flounder

[12:32] again and we're gonna see the same thing over and over again with the third title it's gonna happen

[12:37] I'll tell you right now it's not gonna sell well and as much as you say oh yeah well come on give

[12:43] him a chance it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because it's gonna be a theme that probably people

[12:49] don't really want and yet if they made it based on a theme we loved we would pay more you would pay

[12:55] what would you pay for your dream theme and that's sort of like the point of this podcast is

[13:00] if you put the dream theme in front of people you know for you it might be Transformers or G.I. Joe

[13:07] it might be the goonies it might be back to the future you'd pay you you'd pay the price of two

[13:13] or three pins just to have your dream theme and yet we're stuck we're stuck with all these

[13:19] boutique options that people just don't want and then what does that leave us all right well it

[13:26] leaves us with Stern's new approach which is I think you're gonna see a lot more of popular themes

[13:32] but more like Jurassic Park I don't think you're gonna see movie clips happening on that LCD I

[13:39] don't think you're gonna see callouts from the actors and the movies or the TV shows I think you're

[13:44] gonna see very very watered down versions of these popular themes and it's just a little disappointing

[13:52] there's no way around it I still wish Stern had some sort of you know platinum series in which

[13:57] they would give us everything we want it and I know like there are simple license or restrictions

[14:03] in some of these themes and I just wish they would come out and say it though too so I can at least

[14:08] go to bed disappointed knowing that it's not the manufacturer's fault it's the movie studios that

[14:14] won't allow it to happen and I'm sure deep root is run into this as they've gone after themes you

[14:19] know Roberts told me stories about how difficult it is and almost impossible to bring some of these

[14:24] themes to life but I just wanted I just want more more dream themes in pinball and I want these

[14:31] boutique companies to wake up wake up nobody's gonna run and go buy Lexi light speed nobody's gonna

[14:38] go run and buy cosmic carnival no one's gonna go run and buy you know the mafia nobody there are

[14:45] no buyers there are just a handful of people that might buy you because they feel sorry for the

[14:53] companies or they just want to support the new guy in pinball but that's over with that's over

[14:59] with now so where are we now right after all of this economic surplus and everyone's got money to

[15:05] burn and pinball and people are chasing after all Dutch pinball machines and people are buying Stern

[15:11] Ellie's site unseen where are we now in pinball what have we learned what's next you know and this

[15:17] is going to be the big issue and I think you're going to see this and I think deep root is going

[15:22] to experience this firsthand if they don't come out with a licensed theme that people really want

[15:29] this company is not going to take off because of retro atomic zombie adventure land it's not going

[15:36] to take off because of magic girl it's not going to take off because of Alice in Wonderland I mean

[15:41] Alice in Wonderland has the best shot because it's still you know an iconic book and theme that people

[15:48] know but it's going to require more than that and sometimes I think people forget like all these

[15:55] games like theater of magic and tales of the Arabian nights and all the original games from the 90s

[16:01] you know they stay failed to be very successful you know when it came to sales and so I don't know

[16:07] I mean that I just want to see less pinball machines I want to see less I want to see fewer games

[16:17] I want to see games that are based upon things that people actually want and I want to see a

[16:22] boutique company actually wake up and understand what it's going to take to succeed because I want

[16:29] there to be more competition I want there to be something too lust after I want there to be something

[16:36] too covet you know in the automotive world not to use it as an example but I will use it as an

[16:41] example why are there why did Bugatti just announced they're going to make 10 specific examples

[16:48] of a new car for nine million dollars each I'll tell you why because they know there is a buyer

[16:54] base for that why is it in pinball in which there are so many wealthy people in which there is

[17:02] an opportunity to make you know short low you know short run low volume versions of high

[17:09] and pinball machines is nobody even attempting it and if it cost a lot of money to go get the rights

[17:17] for the assets for some of the dream themes you want why doesn't anybody go just do it just do it

[17:24] you will sell those machines they will sell and they will sell and you'll sell every single one

[17:30] and then it's not about it's not going to be about like what's the next game what's the next

[17:35] game it's going to be about man everybody wants this game right when I see like sun coast pinball

[17:41] being like we're only making a hundred cosmic carnivals because we want to focus on games two and

[17:45] three it's like really really you you come out of the gate and you fumble you come out of the

[17:51] gate and you fumble again you come it there aren't and it's just that this notion that these companies

[17:56] want us to believe that they're going to be around for a while and they're going to keep making pinball

[17:59] machines and here's where they all get stuck they're just going to keep making stuff people don't want

[18:05] because they're not going to go get the themes that you want and and I hate to say it but like

[18:10] cosmic carnivals case in point it's not art it's not art that matters it's theme that matters

[18:17] art based on a good theme will sell but the only way the only way to do like a limited run game

[18:24] with crazy art is to do a john pop it is who's trying to do and that games no magic girl cosmic carnival

[18:29] there's nothing there's no mechs in that there's nothing crazy that going on in that game

[18:35] and so they all don't get it and they all don't get it and they're all going to continue to struggle

[18:40] to survive in pinball so that's that's my plea is I just want dream themes who's going to bring

[18:46] me the dream themes done the right way you know stern it will always be the closest and jersey jack

[18:51] those two those two they have the opportunity to bring the dream themes to live I think jack has

[18:58] really struggled to understand the the themes that people want that are his buyer base I do I

[19:03] I really do I mean I I don't understand the pirates the Caribbean I don't understand the Hobbit

[19:10] selection I don't understand dialed in on any level I think guns and roses is a good one I think

[19:16] willy-wanka could have been I think it could have been you know how I feel I think it was executed

[19:21] strangely for that theme but even so like those aren't that's not like the 40 to 50 year old

[19:28] demographic for pinball it's not it's not and I think you guys would all agree would you rather

[19:34] willy-wanka or back to the future just think about that for a minute would you rather willy-wanka

[19:38] or back to the future would you rather willy-wanka or the matrix would you rather willy-wanka or

[19:46] you know force awakens I don't I don't think Stern has like a Disney exclusive on pinball I would

[19:52] rather you know it'd be amazing I bet and look I don't know I don't know the terms of the deal

[19:59] but I would assume that once the Star Wars licenses off why doesn't Jack go and try and make a

[20:05] Star Wars game you know Lord of the Rings you know make Lord of the Rings again don't make the Hobbit

[20:10] just make Lord of the Rings better make a better version of it but I just feel like there's

[20:15] there's just not there's there's not any desire for these boutiques to figure that stuff out or they

[20:21] just they could say it's cost prohibitive but then you're just gonna fail anyway you know see I

[20:25] just see it like that like you're just gonna fail anyway so you might as well go all in and try to

[20:30] make it work or go get investors to try and make it work because if you go if you knock on an

[20:35] investor's door and you say hey look I need a million dollars to make back to the future pinball

[20:40] because I know it's gonna sell okay you probably have his attention or if you say hey I need a

[20:46] million dollars to make Lexi light speed or I need a million dollars to make October fest you see

[20:50] what I'm saying people I think people would invest in it and I know that the buyers would be there

[20:57] tremendously so all right all right all right well Sunday God I the ice coffee just it does it to

[21:04] me what do you think what do you think you think that I'm being unfair to the boutiques you think

[21:09] all these companies should keep making games at the same price point and and the boutique companies

[21:13] are trying to compete with Stern and to no success to no success to no success whatsoever oh canada

[21:21] can't you just champion every single new pinball company I don't know I'm getting kind of like

[21:26] bored getting bored these other selections these other options is this the best we got is this

[21:32] all we can do is this what pinball is gonna be moving forward is it is it are we done have we

[21:38] reached the pinnacle is Jersey Jack pinball gonna start putting less into their games to make them

[21:43] more reliable are they pulling back right are we gonna see games as packed as was ever again I don't

[21:49] think so so then this becomes it right you kind of I think this is like kind of the landscape of

[21:55] what we're gonna see for the next few years and the only you know the only question mark then

[22:00] becomes deep route I mean seriously who else who else are you looking at who's gonna really

[22:05] disrupt or do it differently and so we have let's see it's almost the end of August September

[22:11] October November we got three months to go before the deep route reveal will have to occur and

[22:18] will they do it will they show us something that will blow us away I don't know I don't know I think

[22:25] you know again there's absolutely I if they don't have the kinds of themes you want I think it's

[22:32] gonna be difficult again I just don't think you know I when I see stuff like Ross I even when I

[22:37] watch the video it's like they're trying to make like a new IP like new angry birds kind of thing

[22:42] it's kind of camping it's kind of quirky but still these are men you're selling to for the most

[22:48] part grown men who want to drink beer with their friends in their basement and they don't want

[22:55] campy like angry birds like humor pinball machines they don't it won't sell as well as the matrix

[23:02] go get the matrix somebody how about somebody go make the original tron movie how about that the

[23:08] original tron movie how about we look at like you know doing you know looking at this 70s and 80s

[23:14] like sci-fi movies that people love how about somebody go make blade runner how about that how

[23:20] about we do blade runner all right there are just so many cool movies out there you know let me

[23:24] Google right now like cult classic films let me see let me see what comes up the top cult classic

[23:30] movies of all time let's see top cult I'm not gonna edit this you know like watch me as I

[23:37] movies let's see what comes up and you tell me we're gonna read them out loud you tell me if you

[23:41] think these would be good be good pinball machines I say that right the rocky horror picture show

[23:47] repo man Heather his Heather's evil dead we know Ben hek wanted to make that blade runner

[23:54] uh let's see I want to see ones that would be good army of darkness the big Lebowski big trouble

[24:02] in little China the warriors all right how about pulp fiction that's been rumored to be coming out

[24:09] pulp fiction but how are you gonna make a pulp fiction game how are you going to make a pulp

[24:14] fiction game because we heard maybe Stern has that license how are you gonna make a pulp fiction game

[24:19] without clips from the movie right it needs it it needs it but pulp fiction would be really awesome

[24:25] clockwork orange this is spinal tap clerks let's see this is uh the rolling stone did the top

[24:34] 25 of all time and let's see what they came up with here number 25 army of darkness

[24:41] number 24 with nail and eye number 23 the princess bride 22 repo uh let's see the genetic opera

[24:52] 21 the room 20 headwig and the angry itch I'm never even heard of that I don't know it's

[24:59] loading now people anyway my point being we have blade runner mony python just keep going fight

[25:07] club the blues brothers the warriors days didn't confused repo man still loading sorry but see like

[25:18] none of these none of these have been ball machines donny darko phantom of the paradise hell's that

[25:25] 1974 film essentially a rock version of the phantom of the opera the evil dead pink floyd the wall

[25:35] herald and mod a clockwork orange pulp fiction this is spinal tap the big labowski's number two and

[25:43] rocky hard number one alright so there you go there you go that's my point these dream themes

[25:49] they deserve to be made they deserve to have a higher price tag because I think people would pay

[25:54] whatever to get them into their homes and I think they're the kinds of games that you just want

[25:59] to own forever you just want to own forever you know and beyond like buying a game and just playing

[26:05] it for six months and selling it like don't you just want stuff that is bolted to the ground and

[26:11] that you never got one to get rid of all right all right I don't know I don't know what you guys

[26:16] think email me a canada pinball adgmail.com anything else going on in the pinball world so the labowski's

[26:22] have shipped they they they made their way to people very quickly I don't think anyone thought they

[26:27] would arrive so soon and I didn't notice that someone opened their's up and the subwoofer was

[26:32] just dangling inside the cabinet and a lot of scratches on his lockdown bar another guy said he

[26:39] moved something in the back box and all the sound just cut off I would be very nervous and I say

[26:46] this like I just hope you guys aren't opening ticking time bomb games and I wouldn't open the box

[26:54] until I knew about the availability of spare parts because that is going to be the key in this game

[27:01] is that you have backups for the things that are known to fail I don't know why a lockdown bar

[27:07] would be all scraped up out new ad of box that is really weird to me did that occur when Barry was

[27:15] taking the games out to to inspect them now the other big question mark is the the code in the game

[27:23] so apparently it ships with something like code 0.44 and there's code 0.48 and and but apparently there

[27:30] is a code a newer version of the code that was worked on for the Chinese games but here's the problem

[27:37] the Chinese games were using different boards in the game they weren't using the air a board and I

[27:43] know they made changes I'm not sure that that code will be compatible with those older games I would

[27:49] assume it might have to be because how could you know if he was doing you code he still had original

[27:55] buyers that at a array games he was not going to send those people all new boards was he so who knows

[28:02] I just think this notion that the future looks bright for any of this is is in name I think Jonathan

[28:09] Houston needs to stop stop telling people it's all going to work out I don't think that's the case

[28:16] I don't understand how you see any silver lining in any of this now you just have a bunch of parts

[28:23] sitting somewhere no cabinets we talked about with Ben Hack the amount of money it would take to

[28:28] kickstart this thing again so I think these games are going to get to people and I just I don't I don't

[28:33] know how you see more positive stuff coming out of this this this is not a positive story I don't

[28:40] see a positive outcome occurring anytime soon with Dutch pinball there is a Jurassic Park pinball

[28:47] machine at sunshine I've yet to play it in Brooklyn I hope to go play it this week what else is

[28:53] going on in the pinball hobby Jersey Jack still has not shown people the collectors edition of

[28:58] Willy Wonka I hope to see that soon I don't know when we're going to finally see that uh you know

[29:05] it just needs to happen it needs they need they need to show people what they're buying it just

[29:11] can't be this mystery until you know the very end I hope they get some of the wonka things figured

[29:16] out we still have no answer on the chipping playfields or the dimpling playfields that are

[29:21] happening around the post in the game all right anything else happening in pinball that's it

[29:26] this little snackable addition of canators pinball podcast sorry I just had a bunch of coffee I just

[29:30] wanted to say I wanted to close with this I just I just I just I just want better themes I have to

[29:37] be honest none of these themes most of these themes are not really what speak to me and I think

[29:43] stuff like super Mario brothers would be awesome just stuff where you just want to give them your

[29:48] money I mean can't we make a super Mario brothers game in which the ball goes down the it goes down

[29:55] the green plumber pipe you know sort of a magnet on top goes tunt tunt tunt tunt and then there's a

[30:00] lower play field how awesome would that be a lower play field where it's got the music from super

[30:05] Mario brothers and then you come back up and the ball comes up through the pipe and then falls back

[30:11] into the you know and the music gets cheery again and you've got an upper play field that's the clouds

[30:16] how hard would that be how hard would it be to go get that license you could do it but again I would

[30:22] pay like fifteen thousand dollars if it was done right and it was just so magical but no one's

[30:27] doing this is just these themes that we have to accept they're not the themes that you know you

[30:33] really want you know it search your soul people search your soul and you'll find that the greatest
