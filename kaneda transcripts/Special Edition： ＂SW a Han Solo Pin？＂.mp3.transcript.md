[00:00] Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff,

[00:04] but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.

[00:17] Oh, but there is one powerful force that I think is controlling the entire direction of Star Wars Pimball.

[00:25] Before I get into that, I just want to let you guys know how committed I am

[00:29] to getting you this podcast. I am down in the basement area of my building. It's three o'clock in the morning.

[00:36] It's the only place where I can do this podcast in a quiet space. I mean, actually, there's like dingy bathroom,

[00:43] but here's what made me wake up in the middle of the night. I feel like everyone is missing the force through the trees.

[00:49] Like, they've been just staring at this artwork blinded by their disappointment in the artwork of Star Wars Pimball

[00:57] that I think they're also missing. What I believe is the direction of the game and why we're seeing what we're seeing.

[01:04] And I think it's hard. It's hard to step back because we're just staring at something that is so,

[01:09] I believe, disappointing to so many fans out there.

[01:13] And I want to get into the main thing before I go back about the artwork again.

[01:19] But the main thing I think we're missing is that this game, this game, this is a total hunch by me.

[01:26] And we'll be either confirmed or denied on June 6th when we get more information about this game.

[01:32] But here is Canada's hunch about Star Wars Pimball and why we're looking at what we're looking at.

[01:37] I believe that this game puts the player as Han Solo.

[01:43] Once I started thinking about what's on this game, what's on the inserts, it started to make complete sense that Steve Richie wanted to make a Star Wars trilogy game

[01:54] where the player assumes the role of Han Solo.

[01:58] And all the major modes seem to indicate, if you look at them, they seem to indicate that the things you're trying to accomplish are the things that Han Solo was really trying to accomplish in the three movies.

[02:09] So the four quadrants that are on the play field, Escape from Endor, destroy the Death Star, Escape from Hoth, Escape from Tatooine.

[02:19] A lot of escaping going on, right?

[02:21] Now, escaping and getting people off of planets, that's really the role of Han Solo in the Star Wars trilogy.

[02:30] And remember the Millennium Falcon does destroy the Death Star.

[02:34] I believe, right, in the second time the Death Star has blown up.

[02:39] You know, when it's piloted, is it by Lando? I'm... God, man, I need to get my Star Wars pin.

[02:45] I need to watch it again, but anyway.

[02:48] So if you look at it through that lens, that what Steve Richie has created and designed is a game about spaceships, about speed, about escaping, about attacks, you know, really energetic elements of Star Wars,

[03:05] I think the game starts to make a whole lot more sense to me in my mind.

[03:11] Now, do I want Star Wars 40th anniversary, the movie that's supposed to bring to life, all these different elements from three films to focus primarily on the Millennium Falcon and to focus on Han Solo?

[03:25] And even when you look at the play field, right, the Millennium Falcon is the main item on the middle of the artwork, right?

[03:33] The Millennium Falcon is the main item on the cabinet artwork of the Ellie and on, I believe, the pro.

[03:39] The back glass is all about being inside the Millennium Falcon.

[03:43] I would assume the topper will also be the Millennium Falcon.

[03:46] And another thing I pointed out, and I had a friend post me, a post us for me on Pinside, is the railing on the Ellie for the Star Wars, that's the grating, the metal grating that's found on the Millennium Falcon.

[04:00] So, what do we have here? We have a consistent theme of Millennium Falcon, Millennium Falcon, Han Solo's Objectives.

[04:06] My problem is this. Here's my problem. And I woke up and I was like, you know what? That's cool and all.

[04:13] But this isn't supposed to be a Millennium Falcon, Han Solo Star Wars, Pimbal Machine.

[04:18] It's supposed to be a machine that allows you to play all three movies.

[04:24] And I think that's the big difference here. And I think Richie took a little bit of a risk in not going the more tried and true method that Lord of the Rings did, where it's more about progressing through the three films and doing the major things in those three movies.

[04:42] And really unlocking the multi-balls based on each film. You know, you don't see big inserts that say a new hope.

[04:50] You don't see big inserts that say, return of the Jedi or, you know, revenge.

[04:58] Sorry guys, it is like 3am, a new hope. Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi.

[05:04] You don't see those inserts. So, it's completely different approach to Star Wars.

[05:10] And I think that's one of the reasons why I think people are upset. And here's why.

[05:15] I think if you're a fan of Luke Skywalker, if you're a fan, if you think Star Wars is a movie about discovering the Force, and the main elements of Star Wars are about the relationship between Luke and his father and finding out that Darth Vader is actually Luke's father and then saving Darth Vader.

[05:35] Like those are the emotional elements of Star Wars. Like Luke's theme is probably the most emotional and gripping part of John William's score.

[05:45] But that whole narrative, if you were to look at who's the main protagonist throughout the Star Wars universe, it's definitely Luke.

[05:53] And I think what's missing from this game, just from looking at what we know now, what's missing from me is that whole discovery of the Force, is using the Force and Luke's progression into training to be a Jedi, becoming a Jedi, becoming powerful enough to lift his Y-wing from the...

[06:17] It's not even a Y-wing, it's X-wing. Man, it's again three. The lift is X-wing from the swamp of Dagobah to acquiring those powers, and then using those powers to ultimately be able to take on Vader and take down the Emperor.

[06:32] See, to me, all that's missing. All of that is missing. The Emperor is the ultimate goal is to defeat the Emperor and save your father.

[06:41] And I don't think that comes across in this pinball machine, and I think the focus of this pinball machine is all going to be about collecting the different Star Wars characters, getting them on board the Millennium Falcon, escaping from the planets, blowing up the Death Star, and all that stuff.

[06:59] And I get why they went that way, because the Millennium Falcon does play this pivotal role in all of what goes on in the Star Wars movies, but it's not the main protagonist.

[07:13] It's not what I would have chosen to be the focal point. I would have made Star Wars a little bit more like Lord of the Rings, which is a little bit more of a mashup of all the major modes and scenes from all three movies, and focus more on the films and progressing through the films objectives, versus taking a vehicle and one character and making those two things the catalyst for the entire art package, the catalyst for all the toys.

[07:42] Because I think what Richie, knowing that he loves flow and he loves speed, I think he really honed in on an element of Star Wars, like Hyperdrive Fast, like Space Battles, and he went all in on that.

[07:57] And I think what's completely missing from this game, if I just look at it right now, is the Force, and what the Force could do in terms of thinking about creatively laying out a play field, and I've said this a million times, man, how awesome would it be if the Force could grab the ball?

[08:15] Right, how awesome would it be if Luke Skywalker was doing training to become a Jedi, and he had a, you know, when Luke has the, he gets blindfolded and has to hit the target that Obi-Wan puts up there for him, how awesome would it be if that target moved around the play field, sort of like Bram Strucker's Dracula, and went back and forth quickly using Magnus, or maybe they were pop-up targets, you know, that Luke's training.

[08:41] But I don't think we're going to get, I don't think the modes are going to be, you know, they're not going to like focus on that stuff, because I just don't think the elements on the play field are designed to walk us through the journey of Luke, or the journey of a Jedi.

[08:57] I think it is primarily set up to be Han Solo's game. I really, I think this is Han Solo and the Millennium Falcons version of Star Wars 40th anniversary. Now that's just a complete hunch on my part. I wanted to get it out there. I didn't see many people talking about this on Pinside, I think people are still so damn focused on the artwork.

[09:24] Now this could all be wrong, and there could be modes that are everything I've talked about. Now what I don't want to happen is this, I don't want all that other fun stuff that I, you know, the Jedi stuff to be relegated to just stuff that happens on the screen, and you just have to hit drop targets, and it's all LCD, and it's all digital.

[09:43] I think for me what's missing from the play field itself right now are any elements that have to do with Luke Skywalker's story. I really do. I think they went full in on Millennium Falcon and action sequences where the Millennium Falcon is the star of the show, and I think that's why we're seeing it as the highlight of all the artwork that is on this game.

[10:07] Alright, so let me, how do I feel about the artwork just like a little over 12 hours later, and looking at it again? Look, I'm still really disappointed. I hit up people at Stern, and I'm trying to ask them for, get some higher images out, and they're like, well, higher images will come in a week, and I just don't get that.

[10:26] You know, sometimes I really, I just don't know who to believe, and I say that with all honesty, because I just, the one thing I don't believe is this, and I get that they were restricted by the license, and this and that, this and that, this and that.

[10:40] So the one question that just keeps boggling, you know, boggling my mind, and making me feel like, yeah, like, but, but, but, is it all their fault is none of it, Stern's fault, and I, and here's why, and here's the thing that I just don't get.

[10:55] What, why is it, if you Google Zen Pimbal Star Wars, okay, if you Google Zen Pimbal Star Wars, and you look at the art that is Star Wars approved, that is Disney approved, if you look at the art that is on a Zen Pimbal play field, that it, even though it's digital, if you look at how amazing that artwork is, why can't what's on the Stern machine, even come within a corner?

[11:24] And come within a country mile of looking that nice, and it doesn't, and I think the thing too is, you know, when I look at the Stern play field, the big thing that just keeps eating away at me is once again, we just, I mean, maybe we shouldn't have expected more from Richie, but again, we just have the same old, like, lazy arrow inserts, I think that's lazy, but the thing that I just, the more I look at it, the more I'm like, why is there just so much blue?

[11:51] The blue radion, that's sort of like the Millennium Falcon going into hyperspace, I just don't get the visual aesthetic that I want when I have just that big blue ocean, like, it looks like ocean, it looks like we're, the Millennium Falcon is flying over the water or the ocean, I don't get that, you know, I showed it to Brendan, the first thing she said is,

[12:19] this doesn't look anything like the galaxy, like the starry galaxy that is out there, that Star Wars takes place in, it really doesn't make any sense that so much of it is just blue, and I know like we went back and forth with this on Alien, and you make something too dark that reflects space, and it's hard to see the ball, this bunch of BS, like, you can light up a game, you can make it look like it's the galaxy, but you can light up a game, so it's not hard to see the ball,

[12:48] and everyone's like, oh, wait to the insert light up, wait till we see everything going, yeah, I get it, and I get it's going to have a good light show, I get all of that, but without the game turned on, looking down on it, I just think it looks, I don't think a lot of people have said this, it looks like a big Star Wars lunch box, it looks like a lunch box, an 8,000, 9,000 dollar light box, I just said lunch box,

[13:17] and I just still think it's missing the warmth, the intimacy, it doesn't, when I look at this, and I look at Lord the Rings art, done in 2004, 13 years ago, I see much more of the warmth of the shire and the theme coming through in Lord the Rings,

[13:40] I just don't see Star Wars as this ultra bright blue sort of sunburst in the whole middle of the play field, blue is the predominant color, the characters are just dropped on, I, again, look at this Zen pinball stuff and tell me why Stern can't we have something that's equal, or if not better, then what Zen is putting out within the Star Wars universe, and I think again, I think it just comes down to,

[14:09] I think this game was designed to just be a fast flowing game, I think Steve wanted to sort of take some of the elements of his older games that worked well, and I think he wanted to just like make it Star Wars, and people have laid down images of like ACDC versus Star Wars and how similar they look, you know, Game of Thrones, and it's like, that's the problem I have with these designers lately is I do, I think they're, I think they're out of a world of the world,

[14:38] they're out of the original ideas, they're out of it, and I think what was so refreshing for Dile then is I don't know, it doesn't really look like anything else, Pat Lawler's ever done, maybe the time away really helped them, and I think a lot of these guys at Stern, that have just been designing over and over and over again, I mean I think they're like completely out of original creative ideas, and look, that's not to say I'm poo pooing this game completely, and it's not to say that I don't think, in a week, everyone's gonna come up and down, it's just kind of like a game, and then I think that I'm just going to have a lot of good things about the game.

[15:07] Everyone's gonna come around. Stern's gonna show his assets that are much better.

[15:12] They're gonna hit the start button. The Star Wars theme song is gonna get on there.

[15:15] We're gonna see the script going down the screen in typical Star Wars fashion.

[15:20] And everyone's gonna fall in love with it. I mean, look, this is a Steve Richie launch.

[15:25] Steve Richie games launch exactly like this. Artistic disappointment.

[15:29] A lot of people criticizing saying he's all about flow.

[15:32] There's not enough magic on the play field. It looks really sparse.

[15:36] It looks really barren. And then they play his games.

[15:39] And what happens? Like they fall in love because the ball is flowing amazingly well.

[15:44] And he makes flow games. He doesn't make games with a lot of magnets, with a lot of stop in the action,

[15:50] with a ton of different like toys on the play field.

[15:54] And I think that's what we're getting here.

[15:56] We're getting Steve Richie's version of Star Wars.

[16:01] Right? It should say like Steve Richie's Star Wars on there.

[16:05] We're not getting John Turdow's version, which we know would have been much different, or Gomez's, or John Borg's.

[16:14] So this is just the way it is at Stern.

[16:18] You're really gonna get exactly like sort of...

[16:21] A lot of people say this. A lot of people say it's just another cookie cutter Stern.

[16:25] And in a look, I'm not gonna say it's cookie cutter Stern.

[16:29] I do think that Stern designers tend to give us more of the same over and over and over again.

[16:34] And I've always said this. I think the one designer that really tries as hard as he can to think it's out of the box is Turdow.

[16:41] And I do wish Turdow would have done Star Wars, because I think he would have come at it like much differently.

[16:47] And if we look at all the new recent Stern games, the one that I think, you know, not only knocks it out of the park with artwork,

[16:54] which is Ghostbusters, but also just creativity and trying different things.

[16:59] It was Ghostbusters. You know, he really created that world under glass.

[17:02] Unfortunately, the game was also designed to be so frustrating and have so many cheap drains and issues with the code layout that I think Ghostbusters, you know, again,

[17:14] it only gave us half of what people really wanted.

[17:17] And I think what people really expected with Star Wars was the complete package.

[17:22] They wanted it to be a game that they didn't see anything that they wanted to change.

[17:26] And I, look, if this is the most anticipated title in the history of Stern Pimball, it really is.

[17:32] It really is. They're never going to get a theme bigger than Star Wars.

[17:35] And I just don't buy that the license made them end up with this in terms of the art, in terms of the elements of the three movies that we're going to be on the play field.

[17:46] I just, I don't buy it.

[17:49] That's what they'll tell us. That's what they tell us.

[17:53] And looking, you'll never find the truth in these areas. But I just have to say that I think we're getting disappointed is, I think people want a game that has all the elements.

[18:02] And I think now, you know, for people, I heard from a lot of people.

[18:07] They're like, man, I'm just going to wait for maybe Gardens of the Galaxy. I'm going to wait for this and wait for that.

[18:12] Look, I don't think sales are going to, are going to be hurt though by this. I really don't.

[18:16] It's still Star Wars. I still think, you know, once people see the clips from the movie, I think once people see the, the light show, the sounds.

[18:24] And I think it's, look, I think it's going to be fun to play. And I've always said on this podcast that if a game is fun, that's the most important thing.

[18:30] So yes, I do think this game will be fun to play.

[18:33] The real question begins, it's just like, is it worth owning and are you going to jump to own immediately? Will the 799 Elys sell out immediately?

[18:44] Now here's my take on it. I think they're going to sell them. But I don't think you're going to see Star Wars Elys.

[18:52] I don't think you're going to see the hysteria to get one. The same way you did with Ghostbusters because of how beautiful Ghostbusters was.

[19:00] The same way you did with Batman because I still think Batman looks much better than Star Wars. You guys think that Star Wars looks better than Batman or Adir mines.

[19:09] I don't think so at all. I just, from an artistic standpoint, I still think the Batman package is much nicer presented.

[19:16] Even like the Batman armor that looks like the Batwings and it's metallic, black. I think it's much nicer than just this weird sort of grading that's there.

[19:28] I don't think that grading lights up. I think it's just that's just it. It's supposed to be like Ron the Millennium Falcon. Not as cool as the Batman armor.

[19:36] Batman Ghostbusters, those two Elys, Batman was really rare. They're only made 240 Elys. Those two titles, I think they were more in demand than what Star Wars Elys will be with in terms of demand.

[19:53] That's crazy because as a theme, Star Wars should demand more but the package itself is just not as nice. Look how amazing the Batman Topper was.

[20:05] I think that was like when you put all the Batman together, it's still a great looking Pimble machine and it brings the Batman universe to life in a way that I think Batman 66 fans are happy with.

[20:18] I don't think Star Wars fans are happy. I don't think this is where they want it to end up with it. I think they'll take what they can get. But I think there's going to be a lot of people.

[20:28] Even that just say, hey, the premium is good enough and I'm not going to get involved with paying over it. That's the whole thing is if you're like a flipper and you want it to sell these Elys for more than you paid, I just don't think there's going to be people knocking at the door and people who grab multiple versions of the Elys.

[20:46] I could see these Elys just sitting in boxes and not going for anything over sticker because again, I just don't think it brings anything uniquely awesome enough to the table.

[20:56] And again, I don't know the full matrix. We'll see if those side railings light up. I don't think they're going to. We'll see if there's an Ellie exclusive topper. I'm not sure if that's the case.

[21:06] But I can say it of all the three right now. Man, the Ellie with that has the worst back glass so far. But we'll have to see it in action.

[21:16] Seeing this thing just static is like it kind of is just like staring at a car and critiquing how it drives. A little stupid, right? But it's what we do. And it's also all we have to go on because it's all stern to side to give us.

[21:30] So that's canada down in his basement. That's my hunch that this pen is going to be solely the focus is going to be putting you as Han Solo you as the pilot of the Millennium Falcon. I think it's going to be the focus of the game.

[21:43] I think the Luke and the Jedi stuff like taking off Darth Vader's helmet and defeating the emperor and all those awesome scenes with like Yoda and all that stuff. I think that stuff is going to be missing.

[21:56] I do. I think it or it's going to be in it in a way that doesn't have any physical elements on the play field that reflect those iconic scenes. And I think that is a big miss for Star Wars.

[22:08] I mean, for me like Star Wars so much of it is about the appearance of Vader and those scenes where Vader appears in like Obi-Wan battles him Luke battles him.

[22:17] And I'm surprised that we don't have like a Darth Vader bash toy that like pops out with like the red lightsaber. And you know, I'm just that's I'm just surprised. I really am. I mean the whole thing seems to be it's like as if Steve Richie made a

[22:32] indie car game that or get away game that takes place in the Star Wars universe and he just latched on to the one thing he's so used to making and that's games about speed.

[22:43] But Star Wars is a movie about emotion it's a movie about battling Darth Vader it's a movie about destroying the emperor it's a movie about training with Yoda and I think again I just think those things are missing. And I think Zen Pimbal shows us that the art could could be much much better.

[23:01] But that's it again first world problems of a bunch of board guys with excess money who are like it's just us guys on Pinside and us and a thousand people who listen to this podcast.

[23:14] The rest of the world doesn't really care and it's funny if you go and look at how Star Wars fans reacted to the Star Wars video they're basically all just sitting on Pimbal in general they're like this isn't a game like you said there's going to be new Star Wars game Pimbal doesn't count.

[23:28] I think that just goes to show to when you step out of our little circle how little enthusiasm there is for Pimbal in the world.

[23:38] Okay so it's it's but that's more reason why you have to handle these properties with care and give us stuff that's absolutely amazing because the people who are into Pimbal are so passionate about it.

[23:51] And passionate people want the best they expect the best and I know Stern's passionate about making these games but but man I don't know how they step back and look at that I'm been like and have like ghost busters and an erosmith and they put Star Wars down like yeah we nailed it you guys nailed it.

[24:08] I don't get it anyway I'm going to go back to bed I got to wake up and go to Jersey Jack today and a few hours have a good one everyone more to come on Star Wars.
