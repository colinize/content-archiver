[00:00] Who said that about Utah?

[00:01] Let's out and right now in live.

[00:03] 27.

[00:04] Who?

[00:05] Randy Starries.

[00:06] Want to get you want to jump in?

[00:08] He says I'm proud.

[00:10] No, should we?

[00:11] I'm going to get you going.

[00:12] What is he going to do?

[00:13] He's going to use it.

[00:14] Yeah.

[00:15] And that's the guy over here.

[00:18] I know.

[00:19] No, no.

[00:19] He's going to use it.

[00:20] He's going to use it.

[00:21] He's going to use it.

[00:22] All right.

[00:23] He's going to use it.

[00:24] He's going to use it.

[00:25] I'm going to go.

[00:26] I'm going to go.

[00:27] Let's go find Todd Tuckie.

[00:29] Oh, there.

[00:31] The guy that knows nothing about games.

[00:34] What?

[00:35] A Twippy Award winner.

[00:37] You know you're not eligible.

[00:39] They canceled all the content categories.

[00:43] I want to be famous.

[00:46] All right.

[00:47] We're here automated.

[00:49] Automated.

[00:50] Well, there's this.

[00:51] He's so tiny and I'm so fat.

[00:54] All right.

[00:54] So let's talk.

[00:57] So Winchester, did you sell any?

[01:00] Yes.

[01:01] Well, we only had 10.

[01:04] We could only get 10.

[01:05] And I sold one.

[01:07] I could sell 50.

[01:10] My Mike sold his.

[01:11] They were all gone within an hour.

[01:12] Did anyone here get a Winchester?

[01:14] No.

[01:15] No.

[01:16] Anyone here at Beetlejuice?

[01:17] We got 10 of them.

[01:19] 10.

[01:19] OK.

[01:20] And Mike sold them.

[01:22] I got one.

[01:23] And then Mike sold all the others.

[01:24] OK.

[01:25] So I heard a rumor that Stern only sold 200 walking dead

[01:32] remastered.

[01:33] Did you hear that, Jack?

[01:34] Stern only sold 200 walking dead remastered.

[01:37] I don't know.

[01:38] I haven't sold one yet.

[01:39] I did have some people interested.

[01:41] Now it's rare.

[01:42] They want to see it.

[01:42] They want to see the game.

[01:44] It's not going to work.

[01:45] We have it on order.

[01:46] Yeah.

[01:47] It's just, you think it's too much?

[01:48] I mean, old walking dead was half the price.

[01:51] Did we need another walking dead?

[01:53] Well, I'm excited to see the TV screen.

[01:56] And then they have a few extras on the play field.

[01:59] Yeah.

[02:00] I'm waiting to see.

[02:02] And we do have, I have somebody interested in one,

[02:05] but they want to see it.

[02:06] OK.

[02:06] So we're going to wait until we get one.

[02:08] So we don't have one here, right?

[02:10] No.

[02:10] No, I was hoping there's a, there's a dune here, though, right?

[02:13] There is a dune.

[02:14] OK.

[02:15] It's just, how do you like dune?

[02:18] With all the updates on the code, it's a lot better.

[02:21] OK.

[02:21] And I enjoyed very much.

[02:23] I love the worm.

[02:24] By the way, we learned that the worm is actually called William.

[02:27] William?

[02:28] His name, the mechanism's called William.

[02:31] Check, you want to get in here?

[02:32] That's pretty good.

[02:33] We got another industry first here.

[02:37] Mr. Jack and Erie.

[02:39] How have you guys all been?

[02:40] I wouldn't have came home.

[02:42] Not long ago.

[02:43] Can we talk to Jack?

[02:44] Hold on, I'm just going to talk to him.

[02:46] Oh, right, right, right.

[02:47] OK.

[02:47] Well, we're going to go back and forth.

[02:49] I've got a really.

[02:49] Back and forth.

[02:50] Back and forth.

[02:51] All right, because he's the mask.

[02:53] I'm not the mask.

[02:53] I'm 12 to 12.

[02:55] I've been just a jack.

[02:56] Jack makes the game.

[02:57] He shoot up and jack makes the game.

[02:59] I'm sorry.

[03:00] We have much bigger name on the other line.

[03:02] Yeah, we just, we canceled Todd for Jack.

[03:04] All right, Jack, how you doing?

[03:05] Well, first here, congratulations on Erie Potter's success.

[03:08] By the way, there was just somebody here that

[03:10] was wearing exactly the same outfit.

[03:12] It's about that.

[03:13] It's about that.

[03:14] Oh, man.

[03:15] Do you get his name?

[03:17] Is he really?

[03:18] Is he eligible for a Twippy?

[03:20] They cancel.

[03:21] They cancel the eligibility.

[03:23] All right, so Erie Potter, big success.

[03:26] How many can you tell us how many CEs were ordered?

[03:30] At least a thousand.

[03:31] At least a thousand.

[03:32] OK, more than a thousand.

[03:34] What's your favorite trim to C.E.?

[03:37] I like all three.

[03:38] OK.

[03:39] I tell you what.

[03:40] I like all three.

[03:41] The perpetual salesman.

[03:42] OK, so the next game from J.J. P. I just have to ask.

[03:46] Oh, I can tell you what it is.

[03:48] We know it's Sonic the Hedgehog.

[03:50] It's a pin moment.

[03:50] We're all very excited.

[03:52] When's the time frame, you think?

[03:53] Are we going to see it sometime next year?

[03:55] Yeah.

[03:56] I don't know.

[03:57] In the middle of the year.

[04:00] OK, so around like summer, like May, June.

[04:02] Yeah, I like releasing things.

[04:04] We get the whole world.

[04:05] So ourselves.

[04:07] OK, nice.

[04:08] Show launches.

[04:10] Show launches.

[04:11] They go perfectly.

[04:12] And they go as stars.

[04:14] Right.

[04:14] And I've done both.

[04:15] And so there'll be ostensibly two lines that.

[04:19] Because the hotter you got, you're going to keep making it.

[04:22] I mean, personally, I think we can make Harry Potter for us.

[04:25] Right.

[04:26] It was the same way I felt a whiz of buzz.

[04:28] Yeah.

[04:28] I probably could have had a company if I was making 25 whiz of

[04:31] buzz games a week.

[04:32] Yeah.

[04:32] I could have probably done it for the last 14 years.

[04:35] Yeah, yeah.

[04:36] Is there ever talk of doing another was run?

[04:40] Because you could still sell them.

[04:41] I mean, people would.

[04:42] I think what I should do is go my foot.

[04:45] What I said years ago was the 100th anniversary.

[04:51] You know, I'm still around what year is that?

[04:53] 2039, 2039.

[04:55] The 100th anniversary game.

[04:57] Right.

[04:57] Right.

[04:58] Yeah, because what you did this 70th anniversary was 75.

[05:01] OK.

[05:03] But they're still demand.

[05:05] And I think you've confirmed no more pirates ever, which

[05:07] those continue to hold their value.

[05:10] Pirates of the can.

[05:11] So Mike had about four of them here once for 12 for 12, 5.

[05:16] Yeah, I couldn't move.

[05:17] And then that those same exact games were sold.

[05:19] Well, everything sold out at the factory.

[05:21] And then everything went crazy.

[05:22] 40 grand.

[05:23] They were going for it at one point.

[05:25] Yeah.

[05:26] Yeah.

[05:27] And what about the Hobbit?

[05:28] He's got a beautiful Hobbit in there.

[05:30] And I forgot how great it was.

[05:32] Yeah.

[05:32] How do you know Hobbit's a lot of great game?

[05:35] If you didn't play Wizz of Oz in a long time, go play Wizz of Oz.

[05:38] That's a great game.

[05:39] So play Wizz of Oz.

[05:41] Jack, you guys got next up, most likely, Mark Richie.

[05:45] Is Mark Sidon working on another one?

[05:46] Yeah, he's Steve Richie.

[05:47] Steve, why did I say Mark Richie?

[05:48] Mark Richie, that's his brother.

[05:50] Is Mark doing anything over at Play Mechanics?

[05:52] Did you see what you hear?

[05:54] Does he talk to his brother?

[05:55] And things make him halo.

[05:57] Halo?

[05:58] That's what the word is.

[05:59] That's the rumor.

[06:00] OK.

[06:00] So Steve is up next.

[06:01] And is Mark Sidon working on something new?

[06:04] OK.

[06:04] And Eric as well.

[06:05] So if you've got.

[06:06] I thought it was next game.

[06:07] OK.

[06:08] So Eric's already on to the next one.

[06:09] OK.

[06:10] How excited are you for the next few titles?

[06:13] I mean, I know you're not going to say you're not.

[06:15] You're going to kill it.

[06:16] Do you think the next three years of JJP

[06:20] are going to be sort of like a new benchmark

[06:21] for the organization?

[06:22] You know, I think so.

[06:24] I mean, we're trying to continuously improve everything.

[06:27] I mean, we're not perfect for making games that I don't

[06:31] want to make good games.

[06:32] I want to make great games.

[06:34] Steve's at a point right now with his game where

[06:37] you get to the end of the road.

[06:39] And there's some little tweaks.

[06:41] Something that I might not work all the time.

[06:43] And I learned most of the time.

[06:44] Somebody else would say, you know, it's good enough.

[06:47] Yeah.

[06:48] It's good enough.

[06:48] It's pinball, you know, it doesn't go up the ramp all the time.

[06:51] Right.

[06:51] It rejects you.

[06:52] Death star shot in the stern just.

[06:54] He doesn't feel that way.

[06:55] Right.

[06:56] He said there's some design on there.

[06:58] It should be reliable and should work.

[07:00] So all those little things that you do at the end,

[07:03] they take a long time.

[07:04] Right.

[07:04] I told everybody on a call two weeks ago,

[07:08] because we do weekly calls on a older game development.

[07:11] I said, you know, at this stage of the game,

[07:14] it's easy to get the idea.

[07:19] Hey, we worked on this long enough.

[07:20] It's good enough.

[07:21] Get it out of here.

[07:23] And I said, don't I said, resist that.

[07:25] Resist that.

[07:26] Don't do that.

[07:27] Make it be perfect.

[07:28] Right.

[07:28] I'm going to go out there.

[07:30] I think I'm the 15th or 16th song like that.

[07:32] I'm going to see.

[07:33] Have you played his new game?

[07:34] I did.

[07:35] And you've played all of it as a previous game.

[07:37] So how does this game compare to his?

[07:39] It's going to give out in general, right?

[07:40] For it's money.

[07:41] OK.

[07:42] All right.

[07:43] Yeah.

[07:43] Which one do you?

[07:44] Is it got a little bit more?

[07:46] Well, it's not done.

[07:47] You know, it's not.

[07:49] But the sample I took, it's a fun game.

[07:53] It's another game that you walk up to in your smile.

[07:55] Right.

[07:55] Right.

[07:56] It's a fun game.

[07:57] And Steve, you know, you're all higher.

[07:59] I said it.

[07:59] It shows.

[08:00] I said it many times.

[08:01] You know how I'm like an angel.

[08:02] I'm talking about a paint assistant.

[08:03] I'm just going to have to let him lose.

[08:05] Let him give me the time.

[08:07] We're getting the time.

[08:08] We're getting the budget.

[08:09] And you see what happened with Alan John.

[08:11] It's probably the best game he's done in a long time.

[08:15] In my opinion, I'm going to say that.

[08:16] Right.

[08:17] So we heard just a couple of weeks ago.

[08:19] So JP DeWen is, is he still working?

[08:22] He's leaving J.J.P.

[08:24] You know, JP is an interesting, you know,

[08:27] we have a great relationship with him.

[08:29] He still wants to do stuff for us.

[08:30] OK.

[08:31] So I wouldn't surprise me if you see him back

[08:33] on Eric's game.

[08:33] OK.

[08:34] On Eric's next game.

[08:35] OK.

[08:36] So he won't be on Steve's game.

[08:38] No, I think that might be some things he might have done.

[08:42] OK.

[08:43] And the rumor is he's going over to work

[08:45] on a little back to the future.

[08:46] Yeah, that was a rumor.

[08:48] I heard that.

[08:48] Yeah.

[08:49] OK.

[08:49] I didn't ask him.

[08:50] What's up to me other than?

[08:51] You mentioned earlier that you are always looking

[08:54] to continuously improve.

[08:55] What?

[08:56] Looking at your platform now.

[08:58] What kinds of things would you like to improve

[09:01] the palm that you see area for improvement?

[09:05] I think the electronic system.

[09:07] I think we can do a little bit better on that.

[09:09] You know, years ago when I did the IEL,

[09:11] Boyd, I was being an operator.

[09:14] I was very conscious of people

[09:15] who were having things in the field.

[09:17] And I did the through-hole technologies.

[09:21] So it's big.

[09:23] Now everything surface now.

[09:25] OK.

[09:26] Where it's very difficult to service.

[09:28] Right.

[09:28] I didn't want to make you be married to me

[09:31] because you blew out a node board or something like that.

[09:33] And then trucking all kinds of money for it.

[09:35] I wanted to be able to fix it.

[09:36] Right.

[09:36] So we're going forward with that in mind.

[09:40] OK.

[09:41] But we're going to bring, you know, it's 15 years.

[09:45] You know, January 1st, 1950.

[09:46] 15th anniversary.

[09:47] Right.

[09:48] Internet connection.

[09:49] I know you guys have like you had

[09:51] squarbit for a little bit.

[09:53] Is that something we might see a ability

[09:55] to connect all the Jersey Jack games out there one day?

[09:58] Yes.

[09:58] OK.

[09:59] We're more working on it for a couple of years.

[10:01] OK.

[10:02] So one day we're going to get internet connection

[10:04] into these games.

[10:06] Is there been a theme that you didn't get that you wanted

[10:11] that you can talk about?

[10:12] Yeah.

[10:13] Who I can talk about.

[10:14] Yeah.

[10:16] How about the first split of Jack?

[10:17] Oh, well, I guess that's true.

[10:19] In the beginning, I wanted to do three stages.

[10:21] Me.

[10:23] Me.

[10:24] Me.

[10:25] It was great.

[10:25] No.

[10:26] No.

[10:27] No.

[10:28] You know who loves that doctor right here.

[10:30] This Larry.

[10:30] You haven't Larry them.

[10:31] He's a character.

[10:33] Larry Ken's way up.

[10:35] And I listened to him for like 20 minutes.

[10:37] And the sun wants it to go to the booth.

[10:39] And you finally walked away.

[10:40] Well, Larry was talking.

[10:41] Larry told me to license Dan the film.

[10:46] I just don't think three stages would have been a good call.

[10:48] So there's rumors of like, OK, let me ask you a different question.

[10:54] So I can always speak specific themes.

[10:56] But do you really think, you know, seeing the success of Harry Potter, seeing the success

[11:00] of Beetlejuice recently?

[11:02] Do you think like the 80s nostalgic sort of period is really where this demographic

[11:09] gravitates towards?

[11:10] And I think Potter is what like early 2000s, maybe late 90s, wouldn't it?

[11:14] 2001 was the first Potter maybe movie.

[11:17] But the books were out prior, right?

[11:20] Where do you think the sweet spot for this demo is?

[11:23] It's changing.

[11:24] You know, everything changes every day.

[11:26] I will get older.

[11:27] New people coming into the industry.

[11:29] New people coming into collecting.

[11:31] You saw it at IAPA.

[11:34] There were people at IAPA that came looking specifically for pinball machines at the show.

[11:41] At Expo, we asked people to put the hands up.

[11:44] It was at first Expo.

[11:45] I think about 40% of the room put the hands up.

[11:48] It's really good.

[11:50] You know, we have to keep the spread in the word of Dylan.

[11:53] People most of the earth does not know that you, there's pinball machines.

[11:57] That's our lives.

[11:59] Right.

[12:00] Look at you.

[12:01] You're all decked out in pinballs though.

[12:03] It's our lives.

[12:04] But you know, you don't realize that I go somewhere and I say pinball and the guy says,

[12:10] paintball?

[12:11] Did you hear the paintball?

[12:12] No, you sell paintball guns?

[12:13] Right.

[12:14] No, pinball machine.

[12:16] We've got a question here.

[12:17] So to somebody about your email address, jackadjerzijackpinball.com.

[12:22] Somebody said to me the bank, the other thing.

[12:24] Jack, we have a question here.

[12:26] Is a rumor.

[12:27] Sad boy here who gives 50 bucks every week.

[12:30] So thank you again, Sad Boy.

[12:31] There's a rumor about Ghostbusters that might have gone from Stern to JJP.

[12:36] Is there any truth to that rumor?

[12:38] I can confirm that tonight.

[12:40] Okay.

[12:41] Would you look?

[12:42] I can confirm that.

[12:44] Would you like to make Ghostbusters?

[12:46] I don't know.

[12:48] You know, some things that were made already should just be laid to rest and done.

[12:53] You know, I'm not sure that that could be remade.

[12:56] Right.

[12:57] When you see like a big property like Star Wars.

[13:00] And you see the stuff already.

[13:01] Stop already.

[13:02] Stop.

[13:03] Stop making Star Wars again.

[13:04] Stop making Star Wars again.

[13:05] Well, the team Star Wars again.

[13:07] I guess this is a question like a property that big that never really did have like a

[13:11] masterpiece game that people love.

[13:14] Is there ever any like why don't we see if we can finally make a great Star Wars game?

[13:19] I wouldn't do it.

[13:20] I wouldn't do it.

[13:21] I wouldn't do it.

[13:22] Right.

[13:23] Right.

[13:24] I would have done if I was John Boer and I had to make him again.

[13:25] I'll tell you off camera.

[13:27] Okay.

[13:28] All right.

[13:29] All right.

[13:30] All right.

[13:31] So, well, there was a rumor he was making Indiana Jones and it was finished and then they

[13:36] that licensing shifted hands or the ownership of the property and it got shut.

[13:40] Disney is a percentage basis of self-priced is a royalty.

[13:47] Okay.

[13:48] So, back in the day when there was only one company, you could give a license company

[13:57] like $5 a hand.

[13:59] Right.

[14:00] Today is everybody.

[14:01] You're not a company.

[14:02] No, you're a company.

[14:03] No, no, no.

[14:04] Well, you're smart.

[14:05] You're going to buy a home pen.

[14:07] But really, what happens is that with competition, you have a lot of people banging on the doors

[14:13] of the same people for licenses.

[14:15] Somebody called me yesterday from the license company and said, hey, so and so was over

[14:19] here last week looking at this license.

[14:21] Maybe you want to look at it.

[14:22] Yeah.

[14:23] So, what they're trying to do is they're trying to create an auction.

[14:25] Right.

[14:26] You want me to bid against somebody and everything.

[14:27] Has that happened to you?

[14:28] Have you had to go in and either save a license you thought you had or have you outbid

[14:33] somebody?

[14:34] So, I mean, the sonic was a license that apparently AP was pursuing with Ryan McQuade's

[14:41] game.

[14:42] You probably should have the license before you develop the game.

[14:46] Right.

[14:47] Do you think some people make mistakes by publicly talking about their intent?

[14:52] No.

[14:53] I don't talk about it.

[14:54] Yes, you're right.

[14:55] Do I think that they make this sense?

[14:56] I can do this.

[14:57] That's so.

[14:58] Well, you know, it's interesting.

[14:59] You know, I should.

[15:00] You both have people what you're doing.

[15:01] I don't tell a graph.

[15:02] Spooky.

[15:03] Spooky did it on Godzilla.

[15:06] And American did it on Sonic.

[15:09] So how do you think Pokemon's going to do?

[15:12] You know, like themes and do you think that theme is going to click with the Pimbal

[15:15] buyer?

[15:16] I didn't license Pokemon.

[15:18] I know.

[15:19] But I met with the answer.

[15:20] That's the answer.

[15:21] Okay.

[15:22] I didn't license Pokemon.

[15:23] Okay.

[15:24] Let's see.

[15:26] So two lines.

[15:27] Have you guys ever had too fully operating lines?

[15:30] We did.

[15:32] And it was a small line.

[15:34] We built three was advised that one employee could build three.

[15:39] Believe it or not, even you want to be a little one.

[15:41] Yeah.

[15:42] I mean, probably not.

[15:43] I can't even saw.

[15:44] I can't even solder.

[15:46] You love this.

[15:47] Well, how many currently right now when you guys are at your maximum efficiency, how many

[15:54] games a week is coming out of JJP?

[15:56] We're doing about 25 to 30 at that.

[15:59] Okay.

[16:00] So good, a good week around 150.

[16:03] Yeah.

[16:04] And you want to have quality control.

[16:05] We could probably go higher, but maybe the quality would drop.

[16:08] I'm just saying maybe.

[16:09] Okay.

[16:10] Not saying it would.

[16:11] I'm not going to factor.

[16:12] And just because you know, I want to ask every question.

[16:14] The there.

[16:15] How was it annoying having that AI art issue on Potter at the beginning?

[16:20] That just everyone.

[16:21] Listen, I'm doing this so long.

[16:24] It's always going to be something.

[16:25] Right.

[16:26] And nobody caught it.

[16:27] And if there's not, you'll find something.

[16:28] Yeah.

[16:29] Of course.

[16:30] And look, we're super happy for all the success.

[16:32] I think everyone is, you know, really excited to see what you guys have coming down the

[16:36] pipeline.

[16:37] You know, and Mike always throws a great party every year.

[16:40] Mike throws a great party.

[16:42] And so guys, if you're thinking about getting a game, I heard Mike just found 10 extra

[16:46] beetle juices that he has unsolved.

[16:48] So call over here.

[16:50] You might have some pirate games too.

[16:53] Jack, do you think it's like wrong to just auction off games?

[16:56] Is that like just like what say you have a game?

[17:00] Like if you if you only made a thousand Harry Potter Cs, right?

[17:03] Right.

[17:04] There would have been a lot of people locked out.

[17:07] Do you have been a lot of upset people?

[17:09] And I didn't want to see anybody that wanted a Harry Potter game should be able to buy

[17:13] one.

[17:14] Right.

[17:15] Right.

[17:16] Now we have a game for $10,000.

[17:17] Yep.

[17:18] We have a game for 12.

[17:19] And you can justify way that $2,000.

[17:20] It's not like we made a game and it's 7,000 more.

[17:24] And you put a label on it or piece of somebody's furniture on.

[17:27] I don't know what the hell you did.

[17:30] You know, I can't justify that.

[17:32] And then you have the collector edition.

[17:33] And our collector customers, they're very loyal to the company.

[17:38] And we appreciate that.

[17:40] They're very loyal buyers.

[17:41] And they have room, a whole room full of all the CE games, including, look, let's face it,

[17:47] Emerald City Limited Edition was a CE before or anything.

[17:50] And the gold smog is beautiful too.

[17:53] I mean, they're all playable artwork.

[17:56] So when we did what we did with the collector game, the problem is if Mike has allocated 50

[18:03] of them, let's say, Mike has 150 customers that don't want the game.

[18:08] So the customer calls Mike, hey, Mike, can't you tell him you got a game reserved for me?

[18:11] Oh, no, I didn't know you went to him.

[18:13] Pretty mean you didn't know.

[18:14] I bought every game from you.

[18:15] You didn't know what you don't know.

[18:17] And there's this.

[18:18] Pimbles not about that.

[18:20] Pimbles about making people happy.

[18:21] Give them the game.

[18:23] It doesn't matter.

[18:24] And by the way, I'll say this.

[18:26] There's only 110.

[18:28] Let me pick a game.

[18:32] There's 112 standard edition version Wizard of Oz games.

[18:38] So that's pretty rare.

[18:39] How come then that's 50 grand?

[18:42] Yeah.

[18:43] It's interesting.

[18:44] It's about the rarity.

[18:45] It's about I want a game.

[18:47] I want a game.

[18:48] Are we going to see unlimited C's on the next title?

[18:51] I'm going to keep the same formula.

[18:53] OK.

[18:54] So what's good?

[18:55] You know, then it's the formula.

[18:57] Yes.

[18:58] Yeah.

[18:59] It's hard to limit what you're doing.

[19:02] I mean, I get that if you make 500 or 1000 something,

[19:05] you're going to sell out and you're happy.

[19:08] You're happy doing that.

[19:10] And you have a company that's spooky is different than us.

[19:14] And everybody's different than us.

[19:15] Everybody's different than you can't put too many companies

[19:19] on top of each other and say they're on the same path.

[19:21] Right.

[19:22] Is there any concern?

[19:24] No, no.

[19:25] Is there ever any concern?

[19:27] I mean, seeing, I mean, stern obviously,

[19:29] raise their prices to be in line with your company now.

[19:32] I mean, if you look at a stern for 13,

[19:35] it doesn't come with a top or you put the top around it.

[19:37] All of a sudden, you're right around your 15.

[19:41] Looking at those sterns, they're losing

[19:43] significant value now for the last few years.

[19:46] Is there ever any concern if I make an unlimited run?

[19:49] Right now, there's no second hand value loss to my customers

[19:54] that there is a little bit of a protection of the value

[19:57] of a game if it is limited to some capacity.

[19:59] Oh, it's a bad game.

[20:00] It is true.

[20:01] I said recently that I just don't think

[20:03] many Harry Potter C's will ever be up for sale.

[20:06] No.

[20:07] And how many was it last year, for sale?

[20:09] Right.

[20:10] It's like your wife, right?

[20:11] If you love her, I don't even finish this analogy

[20:16] in my head.

[20:17] But I'm like, I should stop right now.

[20:21] Happy wife, happy life.

[20:22] Yeah.

[20:22] Well, Jack, it's always a pleasure.

[20:25] Happy holidays.

[20:26] Hope you had a great time.

[20:26] I'm surprised.

[20:27] I didn't know I'd get ambushed.

[20:28] No, you're here every year.

[20:30] I don't know.

[20:31] I think we do this interview every year.

[20:33] OK, I'm going to switch back around to Todd and Todd.

[20:35] I'm going to talk about this.

[20:36] I'm going to talk about this.

[20:37] I'm going to give away all secrets.

[20:39] Yeah, we're going to sit here

[20:41] and make sure switch sides to the team.

[20:43] Give away the secrets.

[20:44] Yeah, we're going to sit here and say the three

[20:46] students was a secret.

[20:47] Nobody was aware of that.

[20:49] I mean, it's a good idea you didn't make three

[20:51] students.

[20:53] As Will, Will tell you something that Jack did on the Wizard

[20:56] of Oz, I mentioned it in a video I did.

[21:00] Did you know that Jack never advertised on this brochure?

[21:04] Never told anybody that he put a little monitor inside

[21:10] the crystal bowl.

[21:12] That was Jack's idea to give the customer a little surprise.

[21:16] He was not expecting.

[21:18] So when they unboxed the box and they

[21:20] saw that crystal bowl light up, wow.

[21:23] They were like, wow.

[21:24] When we went to the Apple that year, we had eight games

[21:29] in the booth and we had a yellow-look road

[21:32] carpet and a gentleman made.

[21:35] And nobody knew that what was in the crystal bowl.

[21:38] A kid had asked me at a show.

[21:40] And I said, well, it's an energy.

[21:43] It's going to light up.

[21:45] Now, crystal bowl only the player can see it.

[21:49] That's right.

[21:49] It's aimed at somebody about 5'8", 5'9".

[21:52] That's right.

[21:53] And that was their secret while they're

[21:55] playing that game as the city crystal bowl.

[21:57] That's right.

[21:58] Magic, Kimball Magic, under 20.

[22:00] Yeah, I missed.

[22:01] The one thing I missed is the wood apron.

[22:03] It was just gorgeous.

[22:05] Just.

[22:06] That was an homage to the wood railing.

[22:09] OK.

[22:09] That's why I put it in the deck.

[22:10] OK.

[22:11] Jack's off camera, but tariffs.

[22:13] Are they just annoying you right now?

[22:15] Talk to Albo when we come to the end.

[22:17] OK.

[22:17] My CFO.

[22:18] OK.

[22:19] Which probably not happened.

[22:20] Because of some holes in the walls.

[22:22] Yeah.

[22:23] Yeah.

[22:25] OK, so we got Jack here.

[22:27] We got Todd here.

[22:28] By the way, Jack, you got a lot of great comments.

[22:30] Yeah.

[22:31] I mean, people love you, Jack.

[22:32] They love you.

[22:33] I mean, you're the greatest pinball salesman, even

[22:36] better than Canada.

[22:39] I just want to make everybody a good experience.

[22:43] And you have what you think about.

[22:45] You like to see a seal.

[22:46] When you think about what Jack brought out to market with 13, 14

[22:50] years ago, Wizard of Oz.

[22:52] Yeah.

[22:53] And you look at the games that were available then.

[22:57] And it was $6,500.

[22:59] I mean, a lot of these newbies forget.

[23:01] Like, see, I think sometimes it's a blessing

[23:03] and a curse being in this hobby as long as all of us have.

[23:07] As you see, the price increases.

[23:10] You see the changing dynamic of the hobby.

[23:14] But in the end, we still just all want the same things

[23:17] in these games, these world under glasses.

[23:19] And in an experience, you know, if Enzo

[23:21] for our users say this, I want to make a car that when you drive it,

[23:25] you say, I only live once.

[23:26] I need to own this car.

[23:28] I mean, and that is very much the aim, hopefully,

[23:30] of all pinball manufacturers.

[23:33] And the line of subject, I mean, I still got my guns and roses.

[23:35] And I take gree from people that say the gameplay is not there.

[23:38] And every once in a while, I turn it off for a few weeks.

[23:41] And then I turn it back on.

[23:43] And I'm just like blown away.

[23:44] You have fun with the beautiful game.

[23:46] You have fun in the world.

[23:47] Yeah.

[23:48] You put the game on.

[23:49] It is something.

[23:50] Yeah.

[23:50] My guns and roses are my all-foot subs.

[23:52] Yeah.

[23:53] Yeah.

[23:54] And it's inspiring.

[23:55] And that is the top floor that Joe do.

[23:58] So this, you know, it's pretty cool.

[24:02] I put the game on and I pushed the button in two blocks more.

[24:06] Yeah.

[24:06] One, two, three.

[24:07] I'll just stick back in there.

[24:09] Yeah.

[24:10] It will probably go down as to the greatest amount of musical assets ever inserted

[24:17] into a pinball experience ever.

[24:18] I do this in collaboration with my K-dulations.

[24:20] I want to talk about it.

[24:22] Yeah.

[24:22] Have you ever asked Slash to help you with another license?

[24:26] Because he likes everyone likes him.

[24:27] Like they just do nice stuff for Slash.

[24:30] He's so good at it.

[24:31] Yeah.

[24:32] He's so good at it.

[24:33] Yeah, yeah.

[24:34] And he's filled something on it in two other games, the worst.

[24:37] OK.

[24:38] I was at his like-

[24:39] He's also watched from that.

[24:40] He's a Hector, just he gave you 200 M access.

[24:43] Oh, no.

[24:44] Anyway, it's like, I think there's a Mexican pace.

[24:47] Is there a baby?

[24:48] OK.

[24:49] I want to know, will they ever make Matrix?

[24:51] I have the Matrix license.

[24:53] You still do?

[24:54] I have it.

[24:55] Oh, you have it.

[24:56] It has nothing.

[24:57] It has a movie poster.

[24:59] It has a bunch of bots still, I'd say.

[25:01] Let's say.

[25:02] Look.

[25:03] Again, we have top gun.

[25:05] Top gun license.

[25:07] Tom Cruise, 15 million miles.

[25:09] To say hello.

[25:11] So what are you going to get?

[25:13] Well, you know, somebody said in the world, we're all thrilled.

[25:17] We have top gun video games.

[25:19] Of course, we can top them.

[25:21] Because the video game, what you need is the name, the name.

[25:25] And you make your own jets and your own scenery.

[25:28] And you're going to have movie assets and what that doesn't matter.

[25:31] You just want to sit down and drive and fly a jet.

[25:35] Yeah.

[25:36] My grandma wants to fly a jet.

[25:37] Right?

[25:38] So it's like more general.

[25:39] Grandma wants to fly a jet.

[25:41] So they can make that license work.

[25:43] Steve said to me, which he said to me, hey, my brother got the license.

[25:46] Why?

[25:47] Because you get the license.

[25:48] Yeah.

[25:49] Like, because we don't have any assets.

[25:51] That's why we can't make a game.

[25:53] OK, so no Matrix, no top gun.

[25:56] No Ghostbusters.

[25:59] What's that?

[26:00] The world is there?

[26:01] There's a lot.

[26:02] You know what I love to see just more.

[26:03] Fifth element.

[26:04] Eddie Comedy's Jack, like, I mean, the office would be great, but I.

[26:10] He didn't want to get.

[26:11] Which things did want to do?

[26:12] Really.

[26:13] Caddy Shat.

[26:14] What about Caddy Shat?

[26:15] He got.

[26:16] Chevy.

[26:17] Bill Murray.

[26:18] It's these things.

[26:19] Yeah, all the stars.

[26:20] When somebody's dead and somebody gets control of your life.

[26:23] Yeah.

[26:24] And they have a different idea.

[26:25] And an actor had, you know, somebody might have thought it was real cool.

[26:29] They'd be on a pimple.

[26:30] Yeah.

[26:31] And they're just saying, well, I need.

[26:33] I need 500 dollars to see.

[26:34] OK, yeah.

[26:35] Did, um, what about Barbie?

[26:37] I think Barbie would sell.

[26:39] I think it would.

[26:40] I do.

[26:41] I've been saying Barbie and K-pop demon on us now.

[26:44] I.

[26:45] Have you seen K-pop demon hundreds yet?

[26:47] Yeah.

[26:48] I think I'm going to be.

[26:49] I'm going to be.

[26:50] I'm going to be.

[26:51] When I'm watching K-pop demon hundreds yet, I.

[26:53] Yeah, I stumbled on it.

[26:54] My daughter was watching one of her friends.

[26:56] And it was about the quarter of the way in, and they're watching it in the house before

[27:01] it went to the theaters.

[27:02] Yeah.

[27:03] And I said, and I said this is a great movie.

[27:05] Yeah.

[27:06] I loved it.

[27:07] And I said, why is it this at the theater?

[27:09] Then they put anything in the number one movie in theaters?

[27:11] K-pop and I.

[27:13] Based on that, I mean,

[27:17] there is going to be a k-pop.

[27:20] Let's see I'm trying to seek there any questions. I can't read anyone else guys somebody gave you 10 bucks

[27:25] Ten bucks. We got here is Eddie. We got ten bucks here from the truth

[27:31] Cureth

[27:32] Correct correct

[27:34] All right

[27:36] So we are now approaching a new year and we're looking at Beto juice at the beginning of the year looks like a Jersey Jack game number

[27:45] Jack 12 or 11 is it 13 okay? So we've got spooky beetle juice which is I think spooky's around like 13 game games in the

[28:00] crap it took me 15 years yeah that's just still in game right that's just still in game number one

[28:08] Okay, so we got beetle juice we got what's the rumor is either transformers or Pokemon from Stern sometime at

[28:14] CES first week in January then we're looking at Raza the return of John Papa through juniors

[28:21] I heard he's driving a bus now have you heard this this he's apparently

[28:31] Did Robert Mueller ever go to jail?

[28:34] People follow on the car. I haven't followed the blue but we need blueberry Johnson that guy

[28:39] He's like

[28:42] Newville one game yeah, I took the money put a knuckle

[28:48] Yeah, that's what I don't get anything anything anything

[28:54] Well, did you see that new I just saw another run there's robber Mueller's everywhere in every industry

[28:58] Netflix wire this director that 47 Ronin 48 million and the dude just starts buying Ferrari's

[29:06] Rolls-Royce's and buys a

[29:09] $600,000 mattress for his bed

[29:13] And and so they blow through all 48 million and he's like I'm doing it

[29:17] I'm making the show and they give him another 11 and he just goes and blows it on more dumb shit

[29:22] It's like and not a single episode is completed. It's it's unbelievable that you know to be able to hoodwing people to that level

[29:29] But Robert was

[29:32] Yeah, I mean what we saw haggis when you see some people like right now like do you think that there should be more for both of you guys like

[29:41] More companies coming in or I think we're good now. We got

[29:47] Okay, do you um?

[29:49] Do you think like we're gonna see any more closures from some of those smaller companies next year?

[29:54] Like we got pinball brothers to dready. I think once we get over this electronic or this

[30:00] Economic hump. Yeah, it'll be okay. It's a weird economy right because I feel

[30:05] Inflations through the roof wages haven't gone up

[30:08] But we haven't really had a true recession where the markets have crashed like the markets have been very strong for some people

[30:15] Um, but the cost of living is through the roof the cost of manufacturing is going through the roof

[30:20] Everyone's just feeling in uneasiness now

[30:23] You know

[30:31] Yeah, it's we go and you know what changed they well with the food change

[30:37] Yeah, of course the pizza box change yeah, I mean all these things went up

[31:57] 333 by Dutch pinball x then we're gonna get

[32:02] Steve apparently gonna be nice. Elwin. Elwin might be working on fallout. Do we like that as a?

[32:09] I've never seen anyone fallout. So I don't even know what it is. Do you know what fallout is?

[32:14] Exactly

[32:18] 35,000 foot

[32:20] Yeah, it's you know the ominous titles of Stern recently the fall of the empire

[32:25] The walking dead and fallout

[32:28] You

[32:30] In my way, I never know something really negative right

[32:35] Yeah, yeah, no good go for us probably do a soul more. Yeah, if it wasn't for me to go for pretty pretty decent go for us

[32:43] You got a hit well, well they managed to get around licensing candy shack because everybody thought it was a candy shack then

[32:50] It was there like a vacation him or machine to that wasn't a vacation America by

[32:55] Chicago game

[32:57] Actually something interesting to note when that game came out it was very cheap the

[33:03] brand new right it was 1799

[33:06] I thought the host sale price was 15 is supposed to sell for 3000 right

[33:13] Something around it, but but it had the lockdown bar had two

[33:19] latches and everybody says oh this is so cheap with the latches and now that's what we have

[33:25] latches except for that and jack still has the

[33:29] coffin lock

[33:33] Why? Because it's not adjusted on the old games the right way the bar is loose

[33:40] And

[33:43] My G&R ones a little at times you know my shimmy shaggy

[33:49] To get it close

[33:51] All right now I have to tell jack franshee loves him so Chris he gave her 20 bucks Christopher franshee loves you

[33:59] Um, you know and Chris has worked with you on a few titles he worked on Elton John

[34:03] I still think franshee's cabinet should have been the CE, but that's just me what a soul more CE's

[34:09] And it's godfather work with you work because he sold a lot of platforms and he sold a lot of

[34:15] I look I think I can't find a new one in the box Harry Potter's phenomenal

[34:19] I still might give Elton the edge on the game plan. There's just something about that upper right flipper shot on that game

[34:27] That is just I think that's how the tenfold comes to the world it's so good

[34:32] Great it's just right. I love when people are like there's nooses just right and you can time it

[34:37] People when people say there's like no max in elton you're like there is literally a

[34:42] ginormous piano under a glass that he's banging on the keys. There's no mexonair that would have been a flat plastic

[34:52] At that point

[34:55] And they couldn't get the heads hold on the finger the hands work the right way right

[34:58] It's a meeting from the back of your closing up and says what's the need to talk to you but

[35:03] Heads not gonna move in the hands are

[35:08] You know you can talk

[35:10] So all right

[35:20] Nothing just solve it. I want to say the movement. I want to hand some move. You'll figure out how to do it

[35:25] That's great. Yeah, I love it. It was that now

[35:28] It's it adds such a nice dynamic to that world and I think one we have in the showrooms been hammered on for two years

[35:37] We've had zero trouble without

[35:39] We have another 20 bucks here

[35:44] Yeah, let's go back on tour really is it blind?

[35:48] We're going on to next year

[35:52] He's gonna have yes

[35:58] I mean, these guys are making more now than they ever

[36:03] People say home. I don't know. I know. Well, it's just

[36:09] All right, so Jack we have a question here. This is a good has there been any talk on making the mummy game

[36:16] Like some universal monster the mummy

[36:20] Based on the Brandon Fraser bread. Yeah, the Brendan Fraser mummy or old mummy

[36:25] I would think that would be a lot of licensing too. Did it time cruise make a version of the mummy that was terrible?

[36:35] What am I making that up? No, no, he did. I

[36:38] Thought it was okay. I didn't think it was that terrible

[36:44] Yeah, the mummy yeah, the mummy I don't think itself. Yeah

[36:48] Well, like

[36:51] How about an uncle buck?

[36:59] Or maybe you could select between different movies. So I would say like different versions

[37:04] Well

[37:10] What about fairs-buelers

[37:13] I mean all the all the John Hughes classics breakfast club

[37:17] Fairs-buelers uncle buck but this right now but but definitely

[37:24] Fairs-bueler would be a good one. It's like

[37:27] Somebody offered me a coffee. Yeah

[37:32] What do I do it? I'm driving an old one

[37:36] Do you go somewhere in the world and driving the new one?

[37:40] I don't know is that a game? Yeah, I would like I do think commies

[37:45] I would love a Zoolander

[37:47] I just always think like

[37:48] Something that could make its way into dude's man caves and like it would be like you want to walk up and play it

[37:55] Smoking the band and not I don't know maybe what do you think?

[37:59] I mean, but that's all yeah maybe you just combine

[38:03] Smoking the band

[40:12] See Todd no one's buying that jukebox. No, no, no

[40:18] The rumor is Todd doesn't know anything about gaming is the new rumor

[40:22] Is

[40:25] Gaming is gambling

[40:28] The Frank is the inventor of the battery for no way really

[40:33] Thousand games

[40:36] Really that one that you attached

[40:39] Yeah, yeah, I had one of those in my lower the rings

[40:42] Yeah, yeah

[40:46] I was going to

[40:52] Okay, put to the positive go to drop all the diagrams all the paperwork

[40:56] And it's like

[40:58] But my biggest kicker was you have to do it apply for it within a year releasing it to the public

[41:04] Ah, I lost that time was okay, there's a few copies. Yeah, so we know that

[41:10] Friends is the best. All right, Frank's is the best only by Frank's battery saver. He's off

[41:15] We're gonna let you go yet. Yeah, yeah, I'm off. I'm off

[41:18] All right, let's just walk around

[41:22] Like walk backwards. I can't turn it around on my laptop

[41:27] So let's do this

[41:37] Star Wars

[41:39] Star Wars

[41:43] Hold on

[41:46] I mean Potter looks amazing

[41:52] I have to like let me just do this

[42:01] I'm like both

[42:03] Incredible

[42:14] All right, are we back

[42:16] That were

[42:18] Okay

[42:21] All right

[42:23] Sorry about that. Sorry about that frozen for a little bit

[42:28] Um always always a it's always a great pleasure to

[42:34] Talk to Jack to

[42:37] You know be amongst the people. I always say this. This is like this is a hobby about being amongst the people

[42:43] And it's just a real pleasure to see all the games that I talk about a lot

[42:50] Don't always get to see them and you know Mike's got like

[42:53] I want to say at least like 50 games back there. So

[42:57] What I'm gonna do is you know, let's talk for like 15 minutes that I'm gonna go

[43:01] Um play some stuff

[43:04] And then I do need to get back home and I'll tell you why because if you're planning to come here

[43:09] The main thing is is I need to um, I don't want to miss my kids

[43:14] The same come in the tap though. She's coming to town today. I think I'm gonna miss that part of it

[43:20] But it's like a whole winter market in the village with the hot chocolate and everything so

[43:25] As much as I love my pinball family. I always

[43:28] Don't ever try to miss memorable moments with my family family like last night we watched the late late toy show on RTE

[43:37] If you're Irish, you know what I'm talking about

[43:41] So yeah

[43:45] Oh man, yeah, the community is everything

[43:48] No

[43:56] Um, no, we have to sign up to RTE online. So I um

[44:02] Look, I think when you look at what's happening in pinball right now it's

[44:07] And any I you sing Harry Potter again every time I see Harry Potter man. It's just like wow

[44:12] You know, it it it is a wow that's even a level of

[44:17] G and R I think it's a level above Elton

[44:20] So I think you know the next game from stever. She's gonna just

[44:24] It's gonna be like here how much speedle juice wow

[44:28] Just has that wow factor that pulls people in

[44:33] Doing his gorgeous, you know, I just walked by it um

[44:37] It doesn't have the same

[44:39] Wow, wow is Potter it I mean I'm getting this is just aesthetic

[44:43] The the real issue I see in all of this is like

[44:48] Whether it's dune or Potter or beetle juice

[44:52] The stern games are just looking

[44:55] Like they just don't look they don't have the wow anymore

[45:00] And it's not because like all sterns are cheap. It's just these recent stern offerings

[45:04] Just don't pop like they used to I'm sorry

[45:08] But if you were to put a Batman SLE next to all these games it would be like whoa

[45:14] Ghostbusters Ellie whoa

[45:16] Like I just think you star wars when you see it. It's just it's just underwhelming and I don't think stern

[45:23] Can keep coming out with underwhelming after underwhelming game and like I don't think there's a walking dead remastered here

[45:29] So I heard they only sold 200

[45:33] I'm sure they sold more than 200

[45:34] Frank back Frank where are you are you coming?

[45:38] Frank I can't stay all day today

[45:42] Or you at like a hockey thing are you coming to this

[45:47] But look it's if you're not wowing you're like

[45:53] You're in Sedona

[45:58] Oh man

[46:00] It's um and that's it. I think stern's got its work cut out for it

[46:03] I think JJP we got some good news today. We got news like that JJP's next game is gonna be unlimited CES

[46:09] So there's not gonna be a FOMO to get on a list anymore to get those games

[46:14] We got some information that no top gun no matrix. We got some information of

[46:23] Yeah, what else do we uncover?

[46:26] New new computing system coming maybe from Jersey jack

[46:31] That JP to win might work with them again in the future that someone new is probably working

[46:36] The JP to win might have been working on Steve Richie's game

[46:42] So here's what I want to do gang um, I hope you guys this is like

[46:46] I'm gonna I'm gonna make this a little bit of a shorter show because I do want to just go play and talk to people and hang out

[46:53] I hope hopefully you felt like this was a great show today. I felt like it was a great show today. I want to go back and thank

[47:01] Um everybody who gave

[47:05] A donation here. Thank you guys so much. I really do appreciate everything you guys do

[47:11] I will say this the um

[47:14] Let me tell you one funny story that just shows you how crazy people are for beetle juice

[47:19] I had one of my listeners reached out to me dude someone did this to this guy they like

[47:24] They found his email address and they made an email address

[47:27] So it was like one number off from his and they emailed a distributor that he had his beetle juice spot hat

[47:37] And said I want to give up my spot

[47:40] And then they swooped in and bought it oh

[47:44] Oh no, I think it was like I want to give up my spot to this person

[47:49] So this person literally made up a fake email address

[47:53] Told the dealer to transfer his spot to a like a new person at MSRP

[48:00] And then that new person took it and scouted it for like or four five thousand dollars over

[48:06] By faking someone's email address

[48:09] Like that's crazy

[48:14] Now what's so stupid about it is the games aren't made yet

[48:16] So whoever did that and made the fake email address

[48:20] See here's what I feel bad about

[48:23] Is I that guy that paid like

[48:28] 5,000 over

[48:30] Like now doesn't have a game and I hope he gets his money back. I hope we out the guy that did this

[48:38] It's absolutely fraud

[48:40] But I hope we out the guy that did this

[48:44] I also think you know like like

[48:48] It's you know, it's funny. It's like it can never happen to me if I because I'm canate a pinball at gmail.com

[48:53] They would know that Chris would never give up a spot at MSRP

[48:58] They're like canate it would never give it up for MSRP

[49:03] So Josh

[49:04] Kush

[49:06] Josh did we find out Josh is on Facebook right now Josh did we find out

[49:10] Did we find out who did it

[49:16] Did I'm so curious this is such an interesting story

[49:22] I mean I've heard I just you know just when I thought I've heard it all in this hobby. I've never heard of that happening

[49:31] Absolutely not

[49:36] You

[49:43] So that's the thing is like no Josh doesn't want to give up his spot. So I

[49:49] It would have been much different if if like the game was made and the game was shipped

[49:59] I think it was someone that reached out to me to buy it the first day of listing

[50:03] Okay

[50:04] Crazy crazy story Josh. I'll call you back today. I can get all the details

[50:09] But anyway, I want to go play some pinball. So guys. Thank you so much

[50:14] It's oh wow wow it's bright the real world is bright

[50:18] I'm gonna go play some machines

[50:20] And maybe snag a piece of pizza, but I want to have like a normal meal today. I don't want to I don't want to have like pizza for breakfast

[50:26] And we'll be good all right, so God bless everybody out there

[50:29] Say a prayer for tux and everybody else out there who's going to some tough stuff man

[50:33] It's life is very short and we need to look out for each other and take care of each other

[50:38] And get ready for some fun

[50:40] Canada news coming up sometime hopefully before the the new year all right love you guys be good and thanks for hanging out
