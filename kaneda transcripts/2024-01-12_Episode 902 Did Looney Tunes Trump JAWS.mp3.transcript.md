[00:00] Happy Friday, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast, it's crazy what I'm about to say right

[00:22] now.

[00:23] That's right, Spooky Pinballs Looney Tunes seems to have more excitement than Keith

[00:29] Elwin's Jaws.

[00:30] Did you ever think you'd see the day that a Spooky Looney Tunes machine would have more

[00:37] positive energy around it than the Keith Elwin Stern Pinball Jaws masterpiece to be that isn't

[00:47] really shaping up to be that masterpiece, but I just want to say this.

[00:52] I see Camp Spooky, everybody's cheering and claiming victory.

[00:56] I go over to the Stern Camp and everyone's complaining and there's a lot of division

[01:01] happening.

[01:02] I think one thing is happening, it's this.

[01:05] I think $10,000 is like the ceiling that anybody really wants to spend on a pinball machine.

[01:13] If you release your game for less than $10,000 you're gonna have a lot more enthusiasm, you're

[01:20] gonna be met with a lot more of an open mind and open arms and open hearts, but once you

[01:26] charge more than $10,000 for pinball you're gonna get a lot more skepticism, a lot more

[01:33] cynicism and a lot more anger because people don't want to have to earn like $26,000 or

[01:39] $30,000 before taxes to buy your pinball machines.

[01:45] Alright, so look, here's the thing.

[01:48] 99% of people who are giving their opinions about Jaws pinball and Looney Tunes have not

[01:56] played a single game.

[01:59] You cannot make up your mind on a pinball machine until you play it.

[02:06] It doesn't matter how many streams you watch.

[02:10] It doesn't matter if you're trying to read the body language of Keith Elwyn.

[02:15] Look at Keith's eyes, I don't think he's really excited.

[02:19] I think he's burnt out and he didn't really want to make this game.

[02:22] Oh, stop with that nonsense.

[02:25] Keith Elwyn doesn't make games half-assed.

[02:29] He put everything he could into this game.

[02:32] Is he a huge fan of Jaws?

[02:34] I don't know.

[02:35] But trust me, I think when we all play this Jaws game, it's going to play amazingly well.

[02:43] I think it's going to be a lot of fun to play.

[02:46] And if you look at this Jaws game and you say, hey, I think I'm going to enjoy this

[02:51] pinball experience and even if I don't need to buy one right now, guess what that will

[02:58] do?

[02:59] If you say I'm not going to buy one right now, then you'll keep an open mind and jump

[03:03] on the machine and have fun.

[03:05] And if you have fun playing the Jaws machine, guess what?

[03:09] That also doesn't mean you have to buy it.

[03:12] Do you have to sleep with every woman that smiles at you?

[03:16] Everybody needs to grow up a little bit in the pinball community and realize that you

[03:20] have the power to both enjoy something and not buy it.

[03:25] Why do we all act like if we like something, we have to own it?

[03:30] Like this is absolutely asinine behavior.

[03:34] It's an asinine way to think.

[03:37] You're allowed to enjoy something and not buy it.

[03:41] You're also allowed to say you don't like something and not buy it.

[03:45] You're also allowed to not like something and buy it.

[03:48] You can do whatever you really want.

[03:50] But what's happening right now in pinball is this.

[03:53] For those people who have ordered this game, they're going to praise these games to high

[03:59] heaven, whether it's Looney Tunes people or Jaws people.

[04:03] For those people who can't afford these machines, they're going to just rag on them regardless.

[04:09] So I really do encourage each and every one of you, just get some time on these machines.

[04:15] I'm going to talk a little bit on this podcast about the Looney Tunes gameplay we saw.

[04:20] I really liked what I saw.

[04:21] I actually really, really, really like how Looney Tunes is shaping up.

[04:27] I actually like it more than Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[04:31] It seems more campy.

[04:32] It seems more fun.

[04:33] Let's just go right there right now.

[04:35] So the Looney Tunes gameplay stream launched a few days ago.

[04:39] Did you find it kind of funny?

[04:41] The same day, Canada was ragging on spooky pinball for using licensure approval as an

[04:47] excuse not to show the game what happened.

[04:51] Oh, just all of a sudden, they got licensure approval and they got a gameplay up.

[04:56] I would like to see that email that said, hey, you're good to go.

[05:00] Nope.

[05:01] I think it was Canada saying they're hiding this game and they can show it and they showed

[05:05] it.

[05:06] And so look, I really like what I saw in Looney Tunes.

[05:10] I really like the way they're approaching the code in this game and I'll explain why.

[05:16] After seeing the Jaws gameplay footage and clips were bouncing all over the place and

[05:21] it was jumping all over the Jaws universe, you're going from making knots to saving kids

[05:26] to being in a school to talking to like the city council members.

[05:31] It was all over the place.

[05:32] You're making a dog go fetch a bone.

[05:34] I was like, look, this is too much.

[05:37] I don't feel like I'm in a moment.

[05:38] And is the default screen in Jaws pinball just always brody throwing chum into a bucket?

[05:45] And that's the thing with Jaws.

[05:47] It's like, it's something's always crashing onto the screen and I had no sense of like

[05:51] feeling like in a moment, right?

[05:53] In a mode.

[05:54] I always felt like there was too much.

[05:56] And then I look at Looney Tunes and I love the way they're doing this game where you're

[06:01] in the acne factory and you're in this like movie theater.

[06:05] It's like the mystery science theater 3000, you know, you got like the silhouettes of

[06:10] the characters and they're watching the screen.

[06:13] And then when you start a mode, you're starting an iconic Looney Tunes episode.

[06:19] It's so well done.

[06:21] And also when you start an episode, you're progressing through that episode in a linear

[06:27] fashion, the way you remember that episode and it's not being interrupted left and right

[06:34] with other clips slamming into that linear progression.

[06:39] That is how pinball should be.

[06:42] That is what people want.

[06:43] You want to feel like you are journeying through the thing you love.

[06:49] When I think about jaws, I just didn't get that.

[06:52] I just felt like it was all mashed up in a blender.

[06:55] And so spooky pinball, thank you so much.

[06:57] And the thing I love about this spooky game is there's going to be 20 or 21 iconic episodes

[07:04] in which each one is going to transform that pinball machine into a unique experience,

[07:10] unique music, unique shots and combos and ways to get through each mode.

[07:15] And I think it looks super fun.

[07:17] And I can't believe I'm saying this, but as of today, yeah, I think Looney Tunes had

[07:23] a better showing than jaws pinball.

[07:26] Now, does that mean I think Looney Tunes is going to shoot better than jaws?

[07:32] I don't know.

[07:33] I haven't shot either game, but I'd be a crazy man if I said that a spooky machine is going

[07:39] to out shoot a Keith Elwyn machine.

[07:42] I never thought I would say those words.

[07:44] I never thought I'd see the day, but maybe this is that day, ladies and gentlemen.

[07:49] And for those of you complaining that Looney Tunes ramps are too orange, what are you

[07:55] talking about?

[07:56] It looks like Looney Tunes.

[07:58] It looks great.

[08:00] I think everything in this game so far is looking really well done.

[08:04] So well done, spooky pinball.

[08:06] On Looney Tunes, there will only be 888 of them.

[08:12] And hey, Looney Tunes is a very iconic property.

[08:15] I expect Looney Tunes to outsell easily Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[08:21] I just do.

[08:22] I mean, it's so much more fun to go through those episodes.

[08:26] What's Opera Doc, you know, the Martian, the Martin, all this stuff.

[08:30] It's a lot of fun for everybody in the family.

[08:33] If you order Texas Chainsaw Massacre, guess what?

[08:37] You're gonna get divorced.

[08:38] Your kids are gonna leave you.

[08:40] It's not the kind of theme you can put into your house.

[08:43] It's not a family friendly theme at all.

[08:45] Like it's morbid.

[08:46] Like there's like people getting killed left and right.

[08:49] I'd rather sing Opera with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.

[08:54] I mean, it's just easier to have that and own that forever.

[08:57] Alright, so well done, spooky pinball.

[09:00] We've got Jaws feedback from CES.

[09:02] I wanna read you something.

[09:03] This is what's funny about pinball people.

[09:05] Like if you order to Jaws, Ali, you're gonna see what you wanna see.

[09:09] Like Neil McCrae, I guess, played the game over at CES.

[09:13] And I wanna read this.

[09:14] He goes, 100%.

[09:16] I stopped by to play it on my way home, literally had to run in, play, and run back to the airport.

[09:23] Okay, running.

[09:25] Neil McCrae's running around CES in Las Vegas.

[09:29] He goes, the game is epic.

[09:31] Huge flow monster.

[09:34] Lots of moments.

[09:35] And the upper flipper shot is ace.

[09:38] It's ace, baby.

[09:39] Stern's stand looks superb.

[09:42] The music integration is fantastic as is the video integration.

[09:47] Code looks like it has a lot more to come.

[09:49] If you think Godzilla was still getting new content almost a year after the game came

[09:53] out, we are in for an amazing ride.

[09:57] Now Stern, please put my Ali on the boat and full steam ahead with four exclamation points.

[10:03] Oh my gosh.

[10:05] Rich man buys Ali of Stern Pinball Machine and highly praises it after just a couple

[10:11] games on his way to the airport.

[10:14] News at 11 people.

[10:15] And that's just it.

[10:17] That's all it is right now.

[10:20] It's a bunch of hyperbole both ways on all of these games.

[10:24] We're gonna have to see where the dust settles.

[10:28] As of today, Jaws at least are not sold out.

[10:32] As of today, you can still get a Looney Tunes.

[10:35] And this is what I like.

[10:36] Pinball right now has settled down.

[10:40] Nothing is selling out in one day.

[10:43] Nothing is selling out in one week.

[10:45] And that's a good thing.

[10:47] Now each and every one of us can get some quality time on a machine before you spend

[10:53] this much money.

[10:55] All right, quality time.

[10:57] Play it.

[10:58] Sleep on it.

[10:59] Go back.

[11:01] Play it again.

[11:02] Sleep on it some more.

[11:04] Because the good news is these games are going to be readily available all year round.

[11:11] And we're heading to Alice in Wonderland.

[11:14] We're headed to back to the future.

[11:16] We're all going to be going into the matrix.

[11:19] There's so much coming in pinball.

[11:21] You might be getting a Keith Elwin X-Men 97 game.

[11:26] That's the new rumor.

[11:27] Do we need more Marvel pins?

[11:29] No.

[11:30] But if you're gonna make one, X-Men 97 is a really good thing to make.

[11:36] And I asked Jason Knapp, what do you think the odds are?

[11:38] That rumor is true.

[11:40] He said 60 to 70%.

[11:42] Well those are some pretty damn good odds.

[11:44] Now that was not a theme I heard was possible.

[11:47] A Keith Elwin X-Men 97.

[11:50] I thought he was doing John Wick.

[11:52] We got a lot of stern rumored games.

[11:55] We also now know stern might be bringing back some DMDs.

[11:58] And some of them might be in Ellie form.

[12:01] And so that's gonna be crazy.

[12:03] Are we gonna see Metallica?

[12:04] John Borg is next.

[12:06] After Keith Elwin is John Borg.

[12:09] Is it gonna be a Metallica anniversary edition?

[12:12] Or is it gonna be an all new journey pinball machine?

[12:15] We shall see.

[12:16] But that is who's coming next from stern pinball.

[12:19] We got the super awesome pinball show interviewed

[12:21] David Ficks and Jack Guinari.

[12:24] David Ficks says he has two games coming out in 2024.

[12:29] David Ficks has said that before.

[12:31] He's not gonna accomplish that goal.

[12:33] He once told everybody on a podcast,

[12:36] he has four lines going at American Pinball.

[12:39] Or he was gonna have four lines going at American Pinball.

[12:43] He says a lot of stuff that doesn't come true.

[12:46] Remember when he said he was gonna add loop-de-loops

[12:49] and jumps to Hot Wheels?

[12:51] That they were looking into that?

[12:52] And they were gonna let you upgrade your Hot Wheels game

[12:55] to have some real stuff in it?

[12:57] Did that ever happen?

[12:58] Did he ever get two games out a year?

[13:01] And this is the thing about all these interviews.

[13:03] He says they've got games planned all the way up

[13:06] until 2026.

[13:08] American Pinball is gonna be hard to survive 2024 people

[13:12] if they don't get a hit game out and get it out now.

[13:15] Galactic Tank Force is done.

[13:18] Sales are over.

[13:19] So now what?

[13:20] He's gonna bring out a Barrio tribute game

[13:23] that's gonna flop.

[13:25] And then he's gonna bring out Whitewater 2.

[13:28] Now, Whitewater 2 has the greatest chance of success,

[13:31] but it's also not gonna be a

[13:33] take my money now kind of game.

[13:36] I think David Ficks needs to wake up to this reality.

[13:38] Nobody cares about these legacy designers.

[13:42] Nobody.

[13:43] Their names don't matter anymore.

[13:46] They are not the Titans they used to be.

[13:49] They do not equal sales.

[13:51] The greatest legacy designer in the history of pinball

[13:55] was Pat Lawler.

[13:57] His games sold like crap for Jersey Jack Pinball, like crap.

[14:02] He did not deliver.

[14:04] Eric Minier, a brand new designer,

[14:06] sold more games than Pat Lawler.

[14:08] So don't tell me that we need these legacy guys.

[14:11] And some of them are just washed up and out of ideas.

[14:16] You know, Steve Ritchie didn't deliver either.

[14:18] Steve Ritchie came over, right?

[14:20] We've got Steve Ritchie.

[14:21] He's gonna make iconic Elton John pinball.

[14:25] His game has flopped.

[14:27] People are not buying it.

[14:29] His name does not equal sales.

[14:31] And Elton John, as iconic of a performer as he is,

[14:35] did not equal sales.

[14:37] The future of pinball are new designers.

[14:39] The future of pinball will always be with new ideas.

[14:43] Fresh thinking.

[14:44] That's what people want.

[14:47] Can you imagine if Stern pinball never got Keith Elwin?

[14:50] And we were still just getting the same games

[14:53] from the same designers over and over and over again.

[14:56] And hey, we will reach a period where even Keith Elwin

[15:00] will get a little burnt out.

[15:02] He'll be out of ideas.

[15:04] And some young designer will come into pinball

[15:07] and imagine this hobby we love in an all new way.

[15:11] And that's what we need.

[15:12] We don't need Barrios outdated designs in 2024.

[15:17] We know he's no longer with us.

[15:18] People are not gonna spend this kind of money

[15:21] in some legacy tribute to the man.

[15:23] And that's just the thing about pinball.

[15:25] These companies need to be going out there

[15:28] and recruiting creative design talent from somewhere.

[15:32] Go find people and challenge them to make a pinball machine.

[15:37] Look at the homebrew community.

[15:38] They're making a lot of exciting things.

[15:40] That's what Jersey Jack did.

[15:42] They hired Mark Sidon from the homebrew community.

[15:45] He made Metroid pinball.

[15:47] They saw it.

[15:48] They were impressed and they hired him.

[15:50] Now look, I think American pinball is in big trouble.

[15:53] And I don't believe a word David Fix says.

[15:56] I don't.

[15:57] Until I see it, then I'll give him credit.

[15:59] The same is true when I hear Jack Guinari.

[16:02] And I saw Jack said the same thing.

[16:03] He said the same thing to me.

[16:04] He wants everybody to be more positive.

[16:07] He thinks the world has become too negative

[16:10] and we're slamming things too instantly.

[16:12] Well, first and foremost, I wanna talk about

[16:14] how the fact that Jersey Jack pinball

[16:16] is now selling a driver board

[16:19] that makes the flippers more powerful.

[16:22] It is on pinball life.

[16:24] It is $400.

[16:25] And apparently it should make your flippers

[16:28] as good as Godfather and maybe as good as Elton John.

[16:33] And did you see Jersey Jack's official response

[16:36] to this $400 board?

[16:39] They said it may improve flipper performance.

[16:43] It may.

[16:44] M-A-Y.

[16:46] You're telling me Jersey Jack

[16:47] that your official communication

[16:49] around a $400 upgrade is that it may work?

[16:55] You're not even gonna stand behind this thing.

[16:57] This is the problem everybody

[16:59] with this kind of communication.

[17:02] It's like they're already backtracking.

[17:04] It's like a lawyer is writing this stuff.

[17:07] Not someone who loves pinball.

[17:09] And so I want someone to get this board and test it.

[17:13] And I mean test it on a base level machine.

[17:16] Put this thing into Guns N' Roses

[17:19] and let us know if it works.

[17:21] And I don't want you to test it

[17:22] when you've already got like precision flippers

[17:25] and all those Pinmonk fans going throughout your game.

[17:29] We need to test this on a base level game

[17:32] to see if it improves flipper performance.

[17:34] But isn't it weird that there was no official communications

[17:38] from Jersey Jack Pinball anywhere around this?

[17:41] When they know that the majority of people,

[17:44] every single person who owns a Guns N' Roses

[17:47] and there's like 6,000 people who do,

[17:50] you're not gonna officially communicate to them

[17:53] that you might have solved the weak flipper feel

[17:56] and you're just gonna let this thing go out clandestinely

[18:00] and we have to sort of wonder if it'll work.

[18:03] And then your official communication, is it may work?

[18:06] And then Jack wants to get up there

[18:08] and tell us to be more positive.

[18:10] Well Jack, do you understand why?

[18:13] Why we're somewhat cynical of JJP?

[18:16] It's because of moves like this.

[18:19] We want to buy your games.

[18:22] We want to celebrate your creations.

[18:25] But if you make themes that people really don't want

[18:29] and you don't update your code

[18:32] and you don't have good communication,

[18:34] people are not going to be positive.

[18:37] And I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen,

[18:40] but when you make a product that requires people

[18:43] to spend 12 to $15,000 of their hard earned money

[18:49] on these machines, we absolutely should be critical

[18:54] if we're not seeing 12 to $15,000 in value,

[18:59] if the themes aren't things we want

[19:01] and if it's coming from a company

[19:03] that once you buy their product,

[19:05] not only are you losing thousands of dollars

[19:09] over the last couple of years,

[19:11] but then you know they're not gonna finish the code.

[19:14] And I wish Jersey Jack Pinball at the end of the year

[19:17] could just say we've been listening to your feedback

[19:21] and we're gonna make the following changes.

[19:24] They can't continue to operate in the shadows,

[19:28] just have parts go up on Pinball Life

[19:31] and then do all these podcast interviews

[19:33] in which we're the problem.

[19:35] Like we need to be more positive.

[19:37] No, you need to make a game

[19:39] that makes us more positive.

[19:41] Jack, that's where the solution lies.

[19:44] It's not our fault.

[19:46] You guys spend years making these games

[19:49] and I know there's a lot of people making them

[19:52] and I'm sorry, but you don't get to use the excuse

[19:55] that when people are negative,

[19:57] they should think about the livelihoods

[19:59] of the people working on these products.

[20:01] No, that's your job as the leader of Jersey Jack.

[20:05] That's Brett Abbas's job.

[20:07] Jack said that everybody over there gets a bonus

[20:11] if the game sells well.

[20:13] Well, then the onus is on them to pick the right theme,

[20:17] make sure it's coded right,

[20:19] make sure the flippers feel right,

[20:20] make sure everything about it is what buyers want.

[20:24] Because if you make what buyers want,

[20:27] then you're not gonna end up with three salesflops

[20:30] in a row in Toy Story, Godfather and Elton John.

[20:34] You're not gonna end up there

[20:36] if you actually do market research

[20:38] and you actually think about those people's livelihoods

[20:42] because when you start making games

[20:43] like Elton John and Godfather,

[20:46] then you're making games for you.

[20:48] They're making games for themselves.

[20:50] It's like Jack made titles he wanted to make.

[20:53] He didn't make the titles you want,

[20:55] he made what he wanted

[20:56] because if he made what you wanted,

[20:59] then these games would be sales juggernauts

[21:01] and they're not.

[21:03] And it doesn't matter how many times they spam us on Facebook,

[21:07] we're not buying at these prices

[21:09] because everybody knows you buy the damn CE for 15,

[21:13] it's gonna be worth 12 in just a couple months.

[21:16] You buy the LE for 12,

[21:18] it's gonna be worth 9,500 in just a month or two

[21:21] and everybody knows that

[21:23] because the last three games have done that

[21:25] and this game is gonna do the exact same thing

[21:27] and it's not just JJP.

[21:29] Everything is sliding back down to pre-COVID prices.

[21:33] I mean seriously, look at these games now.

[21:36] Every LE that Stern has made

[21:38] has slid down below $10,000

[21:40] and those started at $13,000.

[21:42] It's a whole new reckoning.

[21:44] It's a whole new reckoning

[21:45] so I just won't accept this indictment of us,

[21:49] indictment of pinball content creators

[21:52] who are calling it like it is.

[21:54] We want to be positive.

[21:56] We want you to give us stuff that makes us happy.

[21:59] That's just it

[22:00] and that's why Canadian Pinball Podcast

[22:02] and that's always been my thing over the years.

[22:05] It's like these companies, they have all this time,

[22:07] they have years.

[22:09] They have years.

[22:10] Jack has years and endless resources to make these games

[22:14] so there's just no excuses.

[22:17] If you're gonna sell a game for $15,000

[22:20] and you have a little $2 tiny dancer or cake topper on it,

[22:25] who the heck thinks that's good enough?

[22:27] You know, it's just not good enough people.

[22:29] I'm sorry but they just need to go further

[22:31] and I'm also really excited

[22:33] about everyone's feedback on JAWS.

[22:36] Like nobody's immune to this now.

[22:38] If you wanna charge this much money and you look at JAWS,

[22:42] it doesn't have it.

[22:43] We all know it doesn't have it.

[22:45] You know, and if we live in a world

[22:46] where flow becomes the new toys, right?

[22:49] Shots are the new toys,

[22:50] then this whole hobby is headed in the wrong direction.

[22:52] It absolutely is.

[22:54] You need to go back and play in ACDC.

[22:56] You need to go back and play Allure of the Rings.

[22:59] Go back and play Atom's Family, Twilight Zone,

[23:01] go play Toten, go play like Ghostbusters,

[23:04] go play games that actually have stuff in it,

[23:07] go play Jurassic Park, and then go look at JAWS

[23:10] and tell me that we're headed in the right direction.

[23:13] That JAWS, a game that's 30% more money than Godzilla,

[23:18] shouldn't be met with some criticisms

[23:21] because they couldn't figure out a more interesting way

[23:23] to incorporate the damn shark into the game.

[23:27] Everybody, 2024 is gonna be, I'm telling you right now,

[23:30] it is gonna be the most interesting year in pinball

[23:33] in a really long time.

[23:35] We are gonna get more games coming out this year

[23:37] than ever before.

[23:39] The competition is gonna be brutal.

[23:41] The prices are higher than they've ever been

[23:43] in the history of this hobby,

[23:45] and everybody needs to find a home for their games.

[23:49] We're gonna see a lot of emotional reactions

[23:52] to everything that happens in this hobby.

[23:54] We're seeing it with this Alice in Wonderland announcement.

[23:57] Why are people so mad?

[23:59] Dutch pinball is gonna make a beautiful,

[24:01] working Alice in Wonderland game,

[24:04] and it's based on the J-pop game,

[24:06] but J-pop has nothing to do with it,

[24:08] and they're only making a small number of them,

[24:10] and that's it.

[24:11] Why does that upset you?

[24:13] Why are you angry?

[24:14] The game is gonna do just fine.

[24:16] I think they're gonna sell every single one

[24:18] after you see this machine,

[24:20] and you might wanna be calling CoinTaker right now

[24:23] and get your name on Melissa's list,

[24:25] and tell her Canadian has sent you,

[24:27] and I'm happy that CoinTaker and Dutch pinball,

[24:30] they're gonna have two really interesting titles.

[24:33] Obviously, the juggernaut is back to the future,

[24:36] and don't believe any other commentary around these games.

[24:39] You're getting all the legitimate sources here

[24:42] from Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[24:44] and those games are coming out down the road.

[24:46] We're gonna get a new Jersey Jack pinball machine this year.

[24:49] I think it's gonna be Matrix or Harry Potter.

[24:52] Then we're gonna get more games from Stern.

[24:54] We're gonna get Princess Bride from Multimorphic,

[24:57] which we're gonna see at TPF.

[24:59] We're also gonna get more Baldy Williams remake games.

[25:02] There's gonna be two remake games coming out this year

[25:05] from Pedretti Gaming and that European Pinball Corporation.

[25:08] Two.

[25:09] So you start to add up all these games.

[25:10] Let's just count them right now.

[25:11] Let's try to count right now

[25:14] all the games coming out in 2024.

[25:17] We've got Back to the Future.

[25:18] We've got Alice in Wonderland.

[25:20] We've got Jaws.

[25:22] We've got Looney Tunes.

[25:24] Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[25:26] We've got Pulp Fiction.

[25:28] We've got Princess Bride.

[25:30] We've got two Baldy Williams games coming out.

[25:33] We've got another game coming from Pinball Brothers,

[25:35] another music pin.

[25:36] That's 10 machines right there.

[25:39] That's 10 right there.

[25:41] And also like that's 10 there

[25:42] and I didn't count like the other two or three Stern games

[25:46] that are gonna come out.

[25:47] We're talking at least.

[25:49] I mean this.

[25:50] There's gonna be at least 15 pinball machines

[25:54] that come out in 2024.

[25:57] Think about that 15.

[25:59] And the average price now is around $10,000.

[26:03] So 10,000 times 15.

[26:06] If you bought every single game,

[26:10] you're spending $150,000 on pinball machines.

[26:14] Honey, don't send the kids to school.

[26:17] Let's not pay off the mortgage.

[26:20] Let's continue to invest in now

[26:22] what is becoming the most appreciating asset

[26:25] each and every one of us is buying

[26:27] and that is a pinball machine

[26:29] and that never used to be the case.

[26:32] It's gonna be brutal people.

[26:34] The competition will be brutal

[26:36] and that is why Canada's wait and see mentality

[26:40] is gonna be the ultimate way to embrace

[26:43] and engage this hobby.

[26:44] If you wait and see, trust me,

[26:47] you will be able to get all of these games

[26:50] when you want them for the right price

[26:53] for less money than they are brand new.

[26:56] You're gonna be able to get whatever you want

[26:58] and you're gonna be able to jump on

[27:00] every single game you wanna play

[27:02] and play it and play it and play it,

[27:04] play it with the $100

[27:06] and then make sure you wanna buy one.

[27:08] Now look, manufacturers don't want you to behave this way.

[27:11] Distributors don't even want you to behave this way.

[27:14] They want you to buy it before playing it.

[27:17] If you bought a JAWS already or a Looney Tunes already,

[27:22] you can't tell me you know enough

[27:24] to know that that game is really worth that much money.

[27:28] Even if you love the theme,

[27:30] you gotta be honest with yourselves.

[27:32] You don't have enough information.

[27:34] We're not all Neil McCrae running to the airport.

[27:37] Oh, I got just enough time to head over to the stern booth

[27:40] and play some games and claim it to be a masterpiece

[27:43] because I already bought the game.

[27:46] No, it's a whole new pinball world

[27:49] and the only consistent thing in this hobby

[27:52] that is worth the money,

[27:54] the only good bang for the buck left in all of pinball

[27:58] is right here and let's all welcome Jengiz to the show.

[28:02] He finally signed up after all these years

[28:06] because he made me sign up for his show too.

[28:09] But Jengiz, welcome to the party, pal.

[28:12] This is it.

[28:12] Even though we're not gonna win a Twippy,

[28:15] we all know this is the world's favorite pinball podcast.

[28:18] Everybody have a great Friday.

[28:20] We'll talk to you soon.

[28:21] She goes out with other guys with a moral

[28:24] and a story from that guy who knows ahead.

[28:27] I fell in love with my love still.

[28:29] I can't even fool like she ever knew.

[28:33] They are keep away from a run around to a yeah.

[28:37] Stay away from that guy.

[28:40] Don't you know what you do now.

[28:43] Whoa.

[28:47] Whoa.

[28:48] Whoa.

[28:56] Keep away from that girl.

[28:58] Don't you know.
