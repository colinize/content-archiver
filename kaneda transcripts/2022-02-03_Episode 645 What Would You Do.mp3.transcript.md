[00:00] What would you do if someone's at home, Crying all alone on the bed, going to the floor, cause he's hungry, And the only way to feed him is to sit with a man for a little bit of money and his daddy's gone, So where's my the rock now, in and out of lockdown, I got a job now, So for you, this is just a good time, but for me, this is what I call life.

[00:19] Oh, welcome to Canada's Pinball podcast everybody, I'm your host, Canada. What would you do is the theme of this show? What would you do if you were the customer service rep at JJP? Would you want the job? What would you do if you were Damien over at Haggis Pinball? Would you stick it out? What would you do if you were Zach over at Flippin' Out and you had a bunch of inventory? How would you price those games? We're going to talk about that. And maybe some other time.

[00:49] What would you do questions out in the pinball world? But first, I want to say welcome to Christopher Ward. Chris Ward is a co-worker of mine, but no more. He's going on to a new job. So Chris, congratulations on your new job and your new gig. We're going to miss you. But welcome to the Canadian club. He signed up this week. And we are at 380 club members. So let's start out the first. What would you do with Damien from Haggis Pinball? And I have to play this clip because I think that's a great idea.

[01:19] This says it all before we talk about Haggis Pinball.

[01:49] You know, I wonder if Marty is laughing right now. He's part of this whole thing. He's going to be a designer over at Haggis Pinball. So what would you do if you're Damien? What would you do if you had stars in your eyes and you wanted to make it pinball company? You've got Celts, right? The first game is out there. You've learned how to screw it together. You took all these orders on fat.

[02:19] You've missed the deadline after deadline. And here we are. And it is February. And once again, Canada is playing a clip of a manufacturer not living up to their end of the deal. Now maybe there are fathoms in boxes, but if you were him, wouldn't you have shown people production beginning in January?

[02:39] Wouldn't you have shared images of games on the line? And once again, we have another manufacturer who is now eight, nine, 10 months past the point they told people they could expect their games. And I'll just say this, I'm going to say this, and I mean this. I don't think Haggis Pinball is going to make it. I'm not rooting for them to fail. I'm not. This is all on them. And I just think they bit off more than they could chew. And I don't think there's any way to make money now.

[03:07] Now here's what I do think is going to happen. If you ordered a game, I do think you're going to eventually get your game. I do think it's now no longer about profit. It's about pride. And I think this is what happens is these people, they've lost so much money. They sink so much money into these pinball operations that it's now pride at stake. It's not profit.

[03:30] And usually when you think about the kinds of people who start these ventures, they're usually very successful in other areas of business. They're pinball hobbyists, they're collectors, and they think they can do what Stern does, what Spooky does, what Jersey Jack does, and then they realize how hard it is to actually assemble a pinball machine when you get hundreds of orders.

[03:56] And you have to find parts and vendors and make sure everything arrives in the factory. And then you have to hire employees. And all this stuff has to happen in unison or nothing can really happen. And every week and every month you go down without making money and selling new games, you're losing money.

[04:17] So how can Haggis Pinball become profitable? And we know that the next game, what's it going to be? Marty's going to design an original IP game. How's that going to make money? There's no real long term success that's going to happen here. And even though I don't want to see this company run on hard times, I've just seen this story before.

[04:37] I've seen it. It looks a lot like Andrew Highway when you see Damien in this empty factory surrounded by all these parts and this vaulted ceiling. And guess what you don't see? Anyone in there? Anyone making games? So it's not like a sign of confidence when you see these founders in their empty factories.

[04:58] That is usually what we see when things aren't going well. And it's not like he's going live. At least Andrew Highway went live and he had people pretending to make games. Remember those old videos when he had people with long screwdrivers pretending alien was on the line? We're not even getting that. We're not even getting a staged manufacturing of fathom.

[05:19] So look, it is just early February, but I think they need to owe people an update now. I think they need to come clean again. And I think they need to put out a new date, which they will miss again. And it's just the state of fimbol.

[05:34] Now, I think you guys might get your fathoms, but after that, I can't see this company finding a way to profitability. And if the question is, what would you do? And I mean this. What would I do if I were them? If I was Haggis Pimball, here's what I would do. I would stop trying to make Pimball machines. I would make Pimball playfields. That is what I would do if I was Damien.

[05:58] You've made this new Pimball playfield that will never dent. It will never pool. It will never chip. So I would stop trying to make every single component and make an entire game and make remakes and Marty's original design. And I would call up the Abbas family and say, Hey, how about we supply you Jersey Jack with all of your playfields moving forward?

[06:20] You will have our bulletproof playfields and you will never have another customer service complaint about playfields that pool and chip and aren't bulletproof. That's what I would do if I were Damien. That is the one problem they solve. They didn't solve any other problems. Kelts is not the modern pin of the year. It's not the best game of the year by any means. They're not going to crank out machines that are on par with a stern machine.

[06:50] They're going to do this. So then why do we need more manufacturers? This is not competition for stern. It will not be competition for gameplay or code or design anything. So there is no point if you ask me in turning on a Pimball company if you can't really be competitive.

[07:09] And they're showing all of us that they sure can't be competitive when it comes to manufacturing and then the games aren't there and then you're doing remakes. I mean, it's hard enough for CGC to make games and they know what they're doing. Imagine this company trying to do it all the way over in Australia and they don't really know what they're doing.

[07:28] And here's what you get. And again, I've just seen this movie before and you can call me toxic. But if I'm Damien, I say maybe we bit off more than we can chew. We don't need this huge factory. Let's make play fields and serve them up to people who want bulletproof play fields.

[07:44] And let's start there before we go to fully featured games. All right, that's what I would do. But that's just Canada. You got to walk before you run in this hobby and they ran right into a big factory. I see some trouble with that abruing. And that's why we're not seeing any unboxings 10 months after Fathom was announced.

[08:04] All right, so what would I do if I were Zach many over at flipping out pinball, right? No, look, I mean, we're both very handsome men, right? We're both Titans of the pinball content world. So what would I do? You know, Zach in the past has said that he will not charge over sticker for games. When a hot game comes out, he will give it to his list of customers at MSRP.

[08:29] And when new games have come out, Zach has done that. But now I'm seeing an inventory list over at flipping out pinball. And I want to talk about it because this is not going to be a personal attack for those guys out there who want to see blood. You're not going to get blood.

[08:44] But I want to talk about the pricing here and what I think about a distributor listing their inventory at these prices. Okay, so I want to read for you what he's got. And we're going to go down the list. And when let's ask ourselves, what would you do? Try to sort of put yourself in Zach's shoes. I'll do my best. I'm going to do my best to put myself in Zach's shoes. They might be like Brooks Brothers shoes. It's not Gucci, but I'll do my best Zach.

[09:08] He's got Jersey Jack's Guns N' Roses LE new in box for $11,000. Now that is sticker price. That is the actual price for a GNR LE. He's got a Stern Mandalorian Pro pre-owned with Insider Connected. It's not new in box for $6,600. Okay. Now that's about the price of a new in box pro.

[09:28] He's got a Stern the Mandalorian LE new in box for $15,000. Now remember, mando LE I believe was 9,800 or 9,500. So this is a ginormous jump over the MSRP of that game. He's got a Stern Batman premium for $11,900 new in box. Okay, this is where it gets crazy. A pre-owned Batman 66 LE. There are 240 LEs for $21,000.

[09:58] $21,999. A Godzilla pro pre-owned opened for $7,500. A Godzilla LE, this is my favorite, an LE new in box of Godzilla for $19,000. $19,000. This game just got released for $10,500. He is selling it at $8,500 more than it was just a few months ago.

[10:26] He's got an Aerosmith LE that is open for $13,900 for an Aerosmith LE. A Led Zeppelin pro, which nobody wants for $63,999. A Beatles gold for $7,800. A Stranger Things premium, new in box premium though, not an LE for $14,000. A Stern Star Wars comic book premium for $12,900. A Star Wars the pin, oh, for $4,200. That's looking like a deal.

[10:54] And my favorite, a Star Wars R2-D2 topper for the bargain basement price of $3,999. I believe that Star Wars topper was like $750. What are my thoughts and what would you do? Now that's the question here. It's what would you do if you were in Zach's shoes and you were a distributor and you're seeing this?

[11:16] Now the first question I have was, well, how are there new in box games here? Are those games that he held back? They might be games he traded for, but he's got them and he's got them in his inventory. And some of these are not current titles, right? Right now, the current title is going to be Rush LE. Godzilla is a few months old. We know that Mandalorian is a good half a year old. We know that some of these other games like Aerosmith, they're old titles. So he's got them. He's got them in his inventory.

[11:46] And I'll tell you what I would do if I were Zach. I would do exactly what he's doing right here. This is what you need to do if you're a distributor in 2022. You need to, if you have games and the market is this hot, you're going to have to price your games at the market value and maybe a little bit over the market value because you add more to the customer buying experience as a distributor.

[12:16] Or a dealer than some random guy on eBay or Pinside. Like I would rather buy with confidence from Zach than just some random dude who's like somewhere in California. So you add that to this as well that you're going to get some customer service and he's going to have your back if something happens with the game.

[12:36] Now, these prices are insanely high. Let's take Godzilla, for example, on Pinside right now, you can go get a Godzilla new in box for around 16 to 16 five new in box, which means Zach is pricing his well over that. So he's not trying to sell the game today because here's what he knows.

[12:57] And here's what's going to happen in 2022. Very soon, everyone's going to realize that no games are coming out anytime soon. Very soon, everyone's going to realize the supply shortage is real. Like Rush LEDs are not going to be flying out the door. Rush premiums are not going to be flying out the door.

[13:15] It is at a point now when you order a stern premium or pro, you are going to be waiting almost a year to get your game. And he knows this. So he's got what is arguably one of the greatest turns of all time. He's got it new in box. And he knows over the next six months, there's not a lot coming out.

[13:35] There's not going to be a lot of inventory. And he also knows, like I know, that Godzilla is going to be better than Venom. It's much better than Rush. And so why not keep it at $19,000 because once those Pinside games sell, and they will sell, he's going to have the only one available new in box.

[13:54] And there's not going to be many new in box to be had. And so I think this is a smart move as a dealer to do it like this. You might as well keep it up, keep it out there, and you're going to sell it. You're going to sell it. And so why sell it for $3,000 less right now at $16,000 if he could hold on and make that money. And he will make that money.

[14:14] And this is where we're at. And I predicted this. Remember when I did a show that ADMs are coming, adjusted dealer markup, and we see it in the car industry. And this is what we're going to see in pinball right now is if you have a new in box game, why are you going to sell it at MSRP MSRP just means a suggested price to sell it at.

[14:35] And there are going to be so many more people wanting these games, then there will be supply. So I don't disagree with Zach doing it. If I were a dealer, I would do the same thing. Now the one thing is this, Zach said he really wouldn't turn into this kind of dealer and it's okay that he has.

[14:54] And I think he just needs to own it. And I think he is. I don't think he's going to like backtrack and you know people might call him a hypocrite, but who cares. It's his business. He's got kids to feed. You know, this is the reality of it. You know, for the longest time, there were so many distributors and dealers giving their friends like the street price of a stern machine.

[15:13] Remember those days, the street price. Remember what would happen in the street price days you had guys like Iceman that were getting games for like almost $1,000 off MSRP. They would buy every single Ellie and then they could flip it for profit, even after they played it because they paid below market value on the games.

[15:32] Now it's the complete opposite. Now, if you're a dealer, you're not going to hook up your buddies left and right with like good deals. Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Because now that demand is so high, you don't even need your loyal customers anymore. I mean this when I say it. You don't need your loyal customers anymore because there are so many people dying to buy these machines, especially at MSRP.

[15:59] Let's say for example, when Godzilla came out and one dealer said, all of my God zillas are going to be 2000 over MSRP. Guess what would happen? They would sell everyone. And so guess what would happen to their cranky loyal customers? They wouldn't be able to go get on another Ellie list because all those lists would be full.

[16:17] So all the power right now, all of the leverage is with the dealer and the distributor and they can be the kind of dealer or distributor they want to be. Now look, I know many of them and they're great people. I know coin taker, pinball star, Zach many, they're all good people. They don't want to charge you more. But the problem is they're not getting any inventory.

[16:37] And the reason why they used to always just give everything at sticker price is because they always had a lot of games coming in every month and they were playing the volume game, but they can't play the volume game anymore. And there is no volume game to play in 2022. Now it's a price war. It's a scarcity battle. So I expect to see more of this. And again, if you ask me what would I do, I would do this. And I would become even more unpopular than Kaneda is right now in pinball.

[17:07] If I were a dealer, I'd be like an art gallery. I'd have like Batman SLD for like $150,000. Like why stop at like 50 grand? I saw an Iron Maiden. Listen to this. An Iron Maiden premium was just listed for sale on pin side for $19,000. Like 19 grand for a premium. Stern is going to keep making premiums forever, people. They're not rare.

[17:32] The problem with pin side right now is pin side marketplace is the new eBay. It's the place where you go to buy something at a stupid high price. Now there's nowhere good to buy pinball machines. The deals are done. And the marketplace on pin side is pointless. It's almost like everyone's just trolling each other to see what obnoxious price they can put on a game.

[17:55] I'm waiting for the day and it's coming soon in which we are going to see a pro machine sell for $12,000. A pro will sell for $12,000 pretty soon. And the people buying these machines, they're all newbies to the hobby. They don't care. They have more money than brains.

[18:11] Alright, what would I do if I were the customer service rep at Jersey Jack Pinball? Probably the most unpopular sort of job you could have in all of pinball to be the guy on the receiving end of all the customers upset with the crappy Mirko playfields.

[18:29] I mean, imagine that job. That's your job to take all the incoming arrows of pissed off customers who are mad that they spent money on these games and they're not holding up. So I want to read you this. So Barry sent out an email. This was an internal email. It says, farewell and thank you.

[18:46] Hello friends. I wanted to take this time and thank you for your support over these last two years. We certainly have been through some exciting times together. I have enjoyed working with all of you and I have learned so much from our interactions.

[19:01] My time here at Jersey Jack Pinball has come to an end. My last day will be Friday, February 4th with my last day in the office being the third. Management is working on a highly qualified replacement for my position and an announcement will be made at the appropriate time.

[19:21] In the interim, Ken Holland will be filling in with customer service issues that I would have handled. Please direct inquiries to Ken. Thanks, Barry. And that's it. For those of you who have bought Jersey Jack Pinball machines over the last two years, you know Barry very well.

[19:38] You've probably sent Barry an email asking to get a replacement playfield for your guns and roses. So what would you do if you were Barry? Well, if I was Barry, I would probably just stay out of pinball. I mean, there must be like some post traumatic stress syndrome going on if you were Jersey Jack's customer service rep.

[19:56] I mean, you just have angry customer after angry customer and the customer service. I will say this, the customer service over at Jersey Jack Pinball inconsistent at best at best. This is not a company that's known for its customer service.

[20:11] And Barry was the guy that was coordinating all of the playfield replacements for guns and roses owners. Now I'm nervous about that. I am nervous. I don't know why distributors aren't handling these for their customers. That makes me super nervous that they remove the distributors from this.

[20:28] That's the whole point of having a distributor that they help you with issues and fix problems. Why did they do that? I'm just nervous that somewhere in Barry's email is everybody's like inquiry to get their new playfield and we're not really getting any further communication at all.

[20:44] There's nothing. All I got was a response that he received my email and that's it. There's no timeframe. There's no follow up. There's nothing. And that does not make customers feel good.

[20:55] Now what would I do if I was this new highly qualified person to take over this role? Let me ask you a question. Pinball podcast listeners. What qualifications could you have to make you the right choice for this role? Even better question. Who would want this job?

[21:13] Would you really want this job to be the customer service rep at Jersey Jack Pinball? Part of me was laughing. I was talking to a friend. I bet what happened was this. I bet they were testing toy story and I bet Barry looked over the machine and saw the post starting to pool or starting to chip and he's like I'm done.

[21:32] I'm out of here. Everybody. Yeah. Friday is going to be my last day. Like he saw like the next playfields are not going to be any better. And he's like I'm out of here. You know why would he leave? Well we all know why he's leaving. I mean it's a terrible job. It's a thankless job. And it's not fun being a customer service representative when the company is having nothing but customer service issues.

[21:53] So I'm really curious to see who's going to take this role. Like who's going to become the new Jersey Jack Pinball highly qualified customer service rep. Let me raise my hand and say I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll receive your emails. I'll get back to people within one day. Even that's too hard for these companies. I keep seeing story after story of how people will email a pinball company and not get a response for weeks.

[22:18] So that's what I would do. I would take this job. I'll do it for free Jersey Jack. I will do it for free. You don't even have to pay me. Canada will become the new Jersey Jack Pinball customer service representative. The first thing I'm going to do is fire Miracle Playfields. I'm done. We're firing him.

[22:34] I don't want my life to be hell. He's gone. We're getting rid of them and we're going to hire Haggis Pinball to make all of our playfields and the pinball world will finally come together in harmony. How does that sound everybody. All right everybody this has been Canada's Pinball Podcast. It's always fun. I love getting on the mic and talking to you guys. We'll be back with more episodes. If you have any suggestions email me at canadapinball at gmail.com and tell your friends to join the club. You know I mean where else are you going these days.

[23:04] I'm going to be in these like hour and a half shows still. It's like come on there's nothing to talk about if you're not going to talk like this later everybody.
