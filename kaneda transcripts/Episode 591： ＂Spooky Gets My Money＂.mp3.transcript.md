[00:00] I just can't just say hello.

[00:18] Wait let me get this straight.

[00:20] So a pinball company out there is going to make a YouTube video in which they are 100%

[00:25] transparent.

[00:27] Not some of the issues their company has had.

[00:31] Not only that, they are going to share with us in a transparent way.

[00:35] All the different things they are going to do in their next game to improve upon their

[00:40] product.

[00:41] And they are going to get up there and stand behind their product and tell us that they

[00:46] are going to improve the quality.

[00:48] Yes, yes, yes.

[00:49] This is everything.

[00:50] And watching spooky pinballs recent video on YouTube makes me feel so good and so optimistic

[00:58] about this hobby.

[00:59] So much so I went over to spooky pinballs page today and I ordered a fan club membership.

[01:07] And I'm going to tell you why I ordered the fan club membership and it's not just to

[01:11] get their new title, which if you do order the fan club from them, it does put you on

[01:17] the list to get early access to buy their next game.

[01:22] But the reason why I did this is primarily very simple.

[01:26] I wanted to say thank you to spooky pinball for doing what I think matters so much right

[01:33] now in the pinball world.

[01:34] I wanted to thank them for being transparent, for being open, for being honest, for making

[01:41] positive changes to the product.

[01:44] And first and foremost, thank you so much for putting quality above everything else.

[01:51] Because as all of us know, as much as we love pinball, if you get a pinball machine and

[01:56] the quality issues are giving you headaches, you are going to have a headache with that

[02:00] product for many, many days, maybe years, if there's no solution.

[02:05] And we don't buy pinball machines and we're not in the pinball to have headaches.

[02:11] We simply want the toys that we buy from these companies.

[02:14] We want them to work and stand up to thousands of plays that we want to put on these games

[02:19] because everybody's got them on free play in their home.

[02:22] And I will say this, first and foremost, spooky pinball has solved the play field issues.

[02:27] And their game, Rick and Morty, has the best play field in all of pinball right now.

[02:31] So that makes everybody feel good.

[02:32] Now from there, they're fixing the issue they had of a loud power supply fan.

[02:38] So if you've had a spooky pinball machine, you hear that fan going over and over and

[02:42] over again.

[02:43] It's annoying.

[02:44] They've solved that problem.

[02:45] There's been issues with the flipper mechanism on a spooky pinball machine and they fix that

[02:50] switch on the flipper as well.

[02:52] So that's really awesome.

[02:54] And then they go on to do something they didn't even have to do, which is confirmed for us

[02:59] that their new title is going to have multiple upper play fields, which is awesome, awesome,

[03:05] which means that world is going to come up towards the glass.

[03:09] And I don't know about you, but I love upper play fields.

[03:11] I love it when a pinball machine rises up off that wood and actually creates a world

[03:17] that is headed towards that glass that wants to break through that glass.

[03:21] So super excited to hear that.

[03:23] And I also heard them confirm what Kaneda told you how many weeks ago that spooky pinball

[03:29] would be introducing a three tiered system this time around.

[03:34] There is a regular edition, a limited edition, and a collector's edition of spooky pinball

[03:41] machines.

[03:42] Now here is how I think they're going to do it.

[03:44] I don't think they're going to set some arbitrary number of collector's editions.

[03:48] I think they're going to simply say we are making 750 or a thousand of this game.

[03:55] You can order your game as you want to order it.

[03:59] And they will allow the orders to dictate how many they make of each.

[04:04] And if they get 800 collector's edition orders, they will make 800.

[04:09] If they get 200, they'll make 200.

[04:12] And they are going to let people decide.

[04:14] Now the ultimate music to everybody's ears is that the collector's edition will be less

[04:20] than $10,000.

[04:22] And so if you look at Rick and Morty and you look at if you optioned out Rick and Morty

[04:26] and you put the butter cabinet on your machine, it came out to right below 10K.

[04:32] So that's what I think they're doing.

[04:33] Is they're going to give you every single option and a butter cabinet for the collector's

[04:38] edition of their next title.

[04:39] I think it's super smart.

[04:41] I think it's going to help out distributors a lot.

[04:44] It's going to help out their production a lot.

[04:46] So they don't have to go down a checklist of options on every single machine they make.

[04:51] And I think that caused a little bit of a production nightmare for them.

[04:55] But even with COVID, even with that options list, even with everything the world went through

[05:00] with supply chain issues, even with having to start Rick and Morty production a little

[05:04] bit later than they planned, even with all of that said, spooky pinball just built all

[05:11] of their Rick and Morty's in less than 18 months, which is what they promised the pinball

[05:17] community.

[05:18] And I'm just here to say that spooky pinball always does this.

[05:21] Spooky pinball always does this for me as much as I rag on Rick and Morty and the layout

[05:25] of the game and I do wish it shot a little bit better.

[05:28] They wish it shot a little bit better.

[05:30] Scott Denise wishes it shot a little bit better.

[05:32] As much as I have my gripes about some of the gameplay features of Rick and Morty, I never

[05:36] had an issue with my game.

[05:38] The game looked amazing and the customer service from spooky pinball when I own that game

[05:44] was phenomenal.

[05:45] And I walked away from that experience feeling nothing, nothing but good vibes about spooky

[05:52] pinball.

[05:53] And so as I kind of go through what I'm going through this past year and you guys are going

[05:57] through it too, we are seeing a division of how pinball companies are handling quality

[06:03] issues, a division in how pinball companies are communicating to their customers when they

[06:08] have issues.

[06:09] And ultimately none of us even want to get to that point, right?

[06:12] You don't want to get to a point where you have to judge a pinball company by how they

[06:17] handle problems.

[06:19] That's not what we want to get to.

[06:21] We want to judge a pinball company by how great the machines are.

[06:25] And we want the pinball companies to figure out the issues before they sell us the games.

[06:32] So if spooky pinball is having play field issues on TNA, which they did, they stopped production,

[06:38] they fixed the issues and now they have the best play fields in all of pinball.

[06:42] And I wish I could say the same thing about our friends over there in Chicago making GNR.

[06:48] I will say it GNR, but they have not solved the issue.

[06:52] They didn't do that.

[06:53] And that is why the conversation is all about quality and what are you going to do for

[06:56] me?

[06:57] And I don't want the conversation to be there.

[06:59] They don't want it to be there.

[07:00] Nobody in the pinball industry wants it to be there.

[07:03] Not the manufacturers and not the customers.

[07:05] So the reason why I went on spooky pinball's page today and I bought the fan club membership

[07:11] for those of you out there.

[07:12] You go to spookypinball.com, you go to shop and it's the second item on the list, the

[07:17] USA spooky pinball fan club membership.

[07:21] I joined the club today.

[07:22] A fan club package includes the following super cool Belalagosi exclusive fan club 3D

[07:29] promotional plastic standup kit.

[07:31] Brenda is going to love putting that in the apartment.

[07:33] I said the only thing we need to make this more of a home for Killian is a Belalagosi

[07:39] fan club 3D promotional plastic standup kit.

[07:42] And here we have it right here from spooky pinball.

[07:44] It also gives you a two week early buy-in on their next game launch.

[07:49] Now this is the big part.

[07:50] This is the thing that most of you sign up for and the reason why you sign up for the

[07:54] fan club is you know that this game will most likely sell out within two weeks because

[07:59] they're not making that many of them.

[08:01] And if you've been living under a rock or in a tunnel for the last year, you know that

[08:06] there is way more demand for new in box pinball machines than there is supply.

[08:11] So the moment spooky announces this game, there probably will be more people coming through

[08:16] the door than spots available and they most likely will have sold more fan club memberships

[08:22] than they will be making games.

[08:24] So it's going to be like an act kind of fast sort of thing.

[08:27] You also get a fan club exclusive access to blood sucker additions of new game launches

[08:32] which will now also be collectors additions.

[08:35] You get the dismember ship card, the exclusive fan club keychain, the exclusive fan club face

[08:41] mask, spooky hand sanitizer and shipping is free and you get it between April 30th and

[08:47] August 1st.

[08:48] The reason why they put August 1st in here is pretty obvious.

[08:52] That means this game is going to be shown and revealed sometime in July and they're not

[08:56] going to allow people to jump into the fan club after the game has been revealed.

[09:00] Super smart makes total sense and then you start to think about, wait a minute.

[09:05] So August which means production will start probably August September and games will be

[09:10] shipping by Halloween.

[09:11] I like this timing by spooky pinball.

[09:14] Now what will this title be with two upper play fields?

[09:17] Is it going to be Nightmare on Elm Street?

[09:19] Is it going to be Halloween?

[09:21] We're all going to find out in just a few weeks.

[09:24] Is it going to be Army of Darkness?

[09:25] Nobody fully knows.

[09:27] I have not seen it.

[09:29] I have not seen a play field.

[09:30] I have not seen the game itself.

[09:33] But I'm excited because this is the kind of positive news we all want in pinball.

[09:38] We want to get excited about these companies and we should support companies that make

[09:42] us feel good about buying pinballs from them.

[09:45] It's that simple and it's nothing personal.

[09:49] I just got accused by someone you know I'm not going to name his name but he's like you're

[09:52] so hard on the other company about all their quality issues and I'm like I'm just acting

[09:57] the way any customer would if I buy your product and your product has issues.

[10:03] I do not want to be told that you don't have a solution for me and just giving me a

[10:08] refund is not a solution that I want.

[10:10] I want a product that's built well.

[10:12] I don't want to have to sell my demon back to Dodge if there's a transmission issue.

[10:18] I want Dodge to give me a fixed transmission because I love the product and that is how

[10:24] everybody feels who owns that collector's edition and you all know what I'm talking about.

[10:29] So I'm excited because we're near we're near July now and you can feel it building

[10:34] right?

[10:35] So I'm going to be playing pinball, Chicago gaming company and spooky pinball are all

[10:40] on the eve of new title launches.

[10:43] If I were to pick the two winners I think they're going to obviously be Chicago gaming company

[10:48] and spooky.

[10:49] Those two are in the driver seat and I'll tell you why they're in the driver seat is

[10:53] they have a history of releasing games that people are excited about and they have a

[10:58] pedigree with the pinball community.

[11:01] American pinball is the interesting company to watch because I don't think they're in

[11:06] the driver seat and I do think they have something to prove with their next title.

[11:11] I hope they're successful in whatever it is they launch.

[11:14] I do.

[11:15] I know that I make fun sometimes because David Fix made fun of me but I do hope that

[11:19] American pinball can figure it out but I do worry about one thing.

[11:23] I do think they're going to come out of the gate with a non license theme.

[11:28] Now you could argue and you would be right that cactus canyon is a non license theme

[11:33] but it's cactus canyon and we know that cactus canyon is going to have way more in it.

[11:39] A balli Williams game has so much in it and this game has a ton in it.

[11:44] This game is going to have way more in it than probably American pinball's next effort

[11:49] but what I'm really curious about with AP is this is they really stripped everything

[11:54] out with hot wheels.

[11:56] And I know the hot wheels fanboys out there all ten of you out there nobody's buying

[12:00] what you're selling.

[12:02] People didn't gravitate towards a stripped down hot wheels.

[12:06] October Fest and Houdini were packed.

[12:09] Then they stripped down hot wheels because Roger Sharp told them if they strip it down and

[12:14] make it operator friendly the game will sell better and be more successful.

[12:19] Completely failed marketing advice didn't work.

[12:21] Now what I'm curious about is what will we see from American pinball next will the game

[12:26] be packed?

[12:28] Will it be packed like October Fest?

[12:29] Will there be a bunch of fun stuff in the game?

[12:32] That is what I'm looking at.

[12:34] Will they make legends of Vahala or Wrath of Olympus?

[12:37] Is it going to be a riot pinball game?

[12:39] I don't know I can't wait to find out but I do think if that's the route they go and

[12:45] they make a riot pinball game I can't see it selling more than a few hundred units.

[12:51] And we know and you know that for American pinball to be successful they need to start

[12:57] making games where they could easily sell one thousand of them.

[13:01] And just think about it you've got this frenzied buyer base right now.

[13:05] You've got this frenzied buyer base right now people are spending way more money than

[13:09] all these pinball machines are worth.

[13:11] I mean people are spending like twelve thousand dollars on stranger things.

[13:14] Elite in this environment in which people are just saying take my money now if you can't

[13:19] drop a pinball machine new in box out into that marketplace that's going to be successful.

[13:25] You really have to call a boardroom meeting and wonder what are you doing wrong?

[13:29] What are we doing wrong?

[13:30] And maybe maybe if you're David fix instead of making fun of canada you should call canada

[13:36] up and run your plans by canada because last time I checked last time I checked I think

[13:42] I'm helping some major brands do some major marketing and my bill rate David fix you don't

[13:47] want to know what it is you don't want to know what it is hourly but I'm going to tell

[13:50] you right now David I will give you hours of my time for free to sit down with you guys

[13:55] sign an NDA and help you make good decisions now speaking of American pinball and themes

[14:01] I'm hearing a rumor that Beatles juice might be the theme that they're working on with

[14:07] Dennis Nordman now think about this for a minute Christopher france he said he's doing

[14:12] a game with American pinball we know he loves beetle juice we know Dennis Nordman

[14:17] loves Elvira and that spooky kind of world that like is beetle juice it's that can't

[14:22] be horror so do you think Dennis Nordman license game with Roger sharp helping to get all

[14:28] the assets is going to be beetle juice now I know they were thinking they might be able

[14:33] to reveal this game by the end of the year but most likely we will see this game by March

[14:38] of 2022 at tpf but also let me give you some advice David fix and let me give you some

[14:43] advice all you pinball companies you don't have to launch your games around a pinball

[14:48] show it doesn't matter anymore covid has shown us there's absolutely no need to invest

[14:53] all that time energy and money to shuffle your product to these shows or wait for those

[14:58] shows to reveal the games because you can sell out of your games just using something called

[15:04] the internet the internet is the greatest pinball show in town it's got a few billion people

[15:10] at that show every day you don't need to go to these shows I think that's old school

[15:15] marketing it's old school thinking and it's not necessary of course the pinball shows

[15:21] would love you to hold your product until their show because then they can say we're going

[15:27] to be the world reveal of the next game from American pinball and they want you to attend

[15:32] to see that stuff makes total sense but I don't think you need to do it especially if

[15:37] your company I would rather these companies put more of their money into the game than

[15:42] spending a ton of money shuffling them around all these different shows because it's not

[15:45] cheap it's not cheap all right so mandalorian stern pinball so I got to jump on it more

[15:51] mandalorians are shipping so for those of you out there I really implore you to put some

[15:55] time on this game I think it's way too early to decide whether or not this game is good

[16:01] great bad horrible mediocre it's just too early none of us have played it that much I

[16:06] will say walking away from my mandalorian experience I did feel like everyone is just

[16:12] prematurely like ejaculating their money into the pinball marketplace these days they

[16:17] just are I mean the amount of people that have reached out to me and said they have an

[16:21] Ellie or a premium of mando ordered and how excited they are for it and I just respond

[16:27] to them like but you even know you like it and they really don't know and it's crazy

[16:32] to me it's actually genius marketing that stern has been able to create an environment

[16:37] like this in which nobody will play these games and they've already sold thousands of

[16:42] them that's incredible it's kind of dangerous right when you think about it because it will

[16:48] make these companies lazier it will make them put less into the games think about it if

[16:53] you're them why would you put more into these games if you can sell them out on artwork

[16:58] and theme alone what else do you need to do and there is nothing in mandalorian that

[17:03] is mechanically that impressive at all and as I said on my last show all the cool stuff

[17:09] is up on the screen that's where all the cool stuff is and it's not even stuff they

[17:13] had a really do because they're just using clips from the show that doesn't cost anything

[17:17] to dice up the clips from the show I think man is going to be a middle of the road game

[17:22] I do I think people will enjoy it I think like all pinball it will be fun but I do think

[17:27] it's going to get pretty monotonous just because of the way the game is designed and the

[17:32] layout I don't think it's going to be like this game that makes you go back over and over

[17:36] and over again and if you have other cool fan layouts in your collection I think you're

[17:40] going to have more fun you know just playing like your attack from Mars or monster bash

[17:44] versus mandalorian that's just my take on it now you can have your take I'm already starting

[17:49] to get a little bit of the hate mail from the mando Ellie guys those are always the cultists

[17:54] right the guys who buy the Ellie's are the biggest cool a drinkers in the world because

[17:59] those guys will defend their purchase to know and because for some reason they need to

[18:05] feel like they're more special than everybody else if you really stop and think about it

[18:10] there's absolutely no reason to own an Ellie there's no reason to own an Ellie the same

[18:15] exact experience could be had for thousands of dollars less the same exact gameplay experience

[18:22] the same exact artwork that you actually see I mean what the backlight artwork means

[18:26] a lot to you the game is exactly the same you're not going to have any more fun playing

[18:31] a mando Ellie the mando premium and that's why it's also comical on some level that we've

[18:38] created this environment I've been a part of it I've helped create this environment in

[18:42] which people who have Ellie's think they're in a superior place than everybody else now

[18:48] do their games hold more value absolutely is it a better financial move to buy the Ellie

[18:53] versus the premium absolutely especially right now if you got a mando Ellie you now own something

[19:00] worth way more than 9200 bucks a premium buyer does not have a game worth anything more than he

[19:07] paid so yes if I were giving someone advice it would be to go in on all the Ellie's simply

[19:14] because you will never lose a penny unless the game is a total turd fest and even Led Zeppelin

[19:21] Ellie owners they're not really going to lose money you could probably get back what you put into

[19:25] it I do not expect Led Zeppelin to go the way of stranger things I don't think a year from now

[19:32] people are going to be like oh I really want to get a Led Zeppelin because when you look at

[19:35] stranger things and you look at the game and then you look at Led Zeppelin it is night and day

[19:41] how much more is in stranger things and the projector and the demigorgan and all the stuff in

[19:47] stranger things the magnetic ball lock on the back of the game all of that stuff is super cool

[19:53] Led Zeppelin has nothing in it nothing new nothing innovative nothing revolutionary I could argue

[20:01] that stranger things and its projector was maybe a little bit ahead of its time people weren't

[20:06] quite ready for it but I bet you in a dark game room with that UV kit going and that projector

[20:13] going that the experience of playing stranger things blows away Led Zeppelin blows it away on

[20:19] every level and that's my one thing with Mando I don't think anything you're gonna get in Mandalorian

[20:25] is a completely unique fresh or original Pimbald experience I just don't see it anywhere in the

[20:31] game it doesn't mean it's not gonna be fun but it doesn't feel like a creative leap forward

[20:36] and I feel like Brian Eddie tried to do something that was a big creative leap forward with stranger

[20:41] things it's somewhat worked it's somewhat didn't but that's why I think people have a new found

[20:47] appreciation for it because at least it's different and now the code is apparently made the game

[20:51] more exciting okay all right speaking of exciting Canadian Pimbal podcast someone called me

[20:56] cancer Brenda on on Pinside this week cancer like they called me cancer and and I love it that

[21:01] you know Robin allows that to be up there or that is such a horrible thing to call somebody

[21:06] and I think it's terrible and I think whoever said that should be ashamed of themselves but

[21:10] this can't tanker us I'll use that word this toxic adventure canator now has 84 active patrons

[21:16] on patreon 84 Brenda we we really are climbing and I think we can get this number to 100 people

[21:23] by the end of July by independent that's that's not the end by the end of July I think we can get a

[21:28] hundred people to contribute to Canadian Pimbal podcast if you're listening to this right now and

[21:33] you want to keep the world's favorite Pimbal podcast on the air don't worry it's still going to be

[21:36] on the air but if you do contribute you get special podcasts and guess what they're really good

[21:41] and guess what they've got three of them already and also we're going to be doing merchandise soon

[21:46] but we're still just gonna have this show doing it this way I've always been a network of one

[21:51] I'll always be a network of one I don't need to join a whole other group of movement to talk

[21:57] about Pimbal we've never had a schedule I've never been like every Monday you're gonna get a new

[22:01] show or every Friday this is how canated loves to do his podcast I got really inspired by that

[22:07] spooky video and so I wanted to talk about it I wanted to encourage all of you to contribute to

[22:12] spooky Pimbal to get on their fan club and just say thank you to a company that is transparent

[22:18] that is making their product better each new iteration of their product and a company that

[22:23] listens to the community they don't just keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again

[22:30] and they don't tell their customers to punch sand if they have an issue with their product

[22:35] and I love that transparency and everybody knows this this hobby is way too small to not be transparent

[22:45] not just Pimbal companies Pimbal personalities content creators you see it everywhere and that is

[22:50] why like I think a lot of you out there are realizing that Pinside really is a place where you should

[22:55] avoid if you want to enjoy Pimbal because people aren't transparent you don't know who those

[22:59] people are they would never say half of that stuff if they were actually in front of the camera

[23:04] or they actually were public figures and that is why you know I think where I love Pimbal

[23:09] is hanging out with people in person because even as I was at Jack Bar and I'm talking to like

[23:14] New York City League players and tournament players there's no like anger there's no arguing there's

[23:18] no fighting we're just dudes drinking alcohol talking about Pimbal and that's the way it should be

[23:24] and that's the way I encourage all of you to enjoy this hobby my final parting words of advice are

[23:30] this three titles are about to come out why would you order a Mando premium right now I told

[23:35] that to someone this week why would you order Mando premium right now which you could get whenever

[23:41] if you've never played Mando you might as well wait to the end of July by the end of July you will

[23:47] see spooky's new game you will know what Mandalorian is you will see American Pimbal's new game and you

[23:53] will see Chicago gaming companies new game doesn't that make total sense I never understand that the

[23:59] rush to get a premium when they will make it four years if I were a premium buyer I would always

[24:06] wait for the code to be done I would wait to play it a bunch of times before I knew I wanted it I

[24:13] would also wait for them to iron out any issues with manufacturing and then I would buy a premium the

[24:19] rush to buy a premium right away the only people that need to rush to buy new games are operators to

[24:26] put the new pro on location to get customers into their locations and Ellie buyers who if they don't

[24:32] move fast enough will miss out on all that free money I just talked about ladies and gentlemen this
