[00:00] Welcome to episode 378 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that has the potential to win.

[00:29] I'm really excited for all of you listeners out there because this show is going to be great.

[00:36] I woke up with a bunch of energy. I'm going to talk about what's happened in pinball this year and what I think is going to happen in the future of this year for all these companies.

[00:45] It's going to be good. We're going to get right to it. Before I do that, I want to give a big shout out to one of my Patreon supporters.

[00:52] His name is Lou and Lou has donated the most money out of anybody to this podcast.

[00:59] Thank you so much. If you ever make it to New York City, I'm taking you out for a nice dinner, my friend.

[01:05] For those of you, as I said, if you donate to Canada Pinball's Patreon page, I'm using those funds to take Brenda out for a dinner.

[01:13] I appreciate every single dollar that you donate every month. It goes to a very good cause, which is Brenda's tummy.

[01:19] If you want to keep a wife happy, especially an Irish wife, it's through her tummy, not her heart.

[01:25] Let's talk about pinball. What has happened so far this year? We've had the monsters. We've had beetles came out as the end of last year.

[01:34] We've had Willy Wonka come out. We've had Pirates of the Caribbean, Seas production. We've had Monster Bash remake Ellie.

[01:42] What else is we... What am I missing here? We've had Black Knight sort of rage. We've had Aldous Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[01:50] The return of 40 Big Lebowski games. Oh, you know Canada's got one. I'm going to read some of your emails that I got around my latest podcast where I reveal and I come clean about all of my new acquisitions.

[02:04] Here's what I think. This year has seen a lot of games come out and for the most part, it's been an exciting year in pinball.

[02:13] I think the biggest story for me this year has been the absence of deep root. We're going to talk about that as we think about what are they going to show us in November.

[02:23] But this was supposed to be the year in which the five days of deep roots sort of inundated us with all these games and we were supposed to have sort of this revolution take place.

[02:32] Haven't seen it yet. We've seen... Let me do company by company because I think that'll help me focus as I'm sort of going nuts here.

[02:41] Recording this episode. All right, so let's start with Stern's year. We'll start with the big dogs.

[02:47] So I think it's fair to say that Stern has had mediocre titles with the Beatles, with the monsters and with sort of rage black night.

[02:56] I think it's fair to say that those games all failed to capture the imagination of pinball buyers and players.

[03:03] And I think they're like BRC titles. I don't think any of those games are going to go down as classic games.

[03:11] The Beatles was just ridiculously overpriced. Everyone agrees. Monsters just had some of the worst code ever that Stern has put in a game.

[03:19] Everyone agrees. Nothing truly original in the game. Doesn't mean it doesn't shoot well. I just think the code compared to what Stern's done in other games just really lackluster.

[03:30] Black night sort of rage just seems barren game and animations are great. Game is brutal though.

[03:36] Brutal game. And for the most part, people want license themes. We know that.

[03:42] Okay, so now Stern has Jurassic Park. And that game came roaring out of the gates with Keith Lwynn design, T-Rex that's throwing balls around.

[03:53] We talked a lot about it. I think Jurassic Park is going to be a humongous success for Stern.

[03:58] I think most people who are playing the game, I'm reading people's reviews from Pimberg. They love it.

[04:03] They love it. I'm hearing nothing but good things about the game. So I think Jurassic Park is going to be a juggernaut title for Stern.

[04:10] That leads us to what is coming in the future for Stern. And that is Elvira. We know it's coming.

[04:17] It's coming this October, November. If you were to ask me when we're going to see it, Stern is going to do their classic move.

[04:23] They are not going to bring it to Expo. And they are going to make us wait till like a week after Expo.

[04:28] And they're going to have IGN break the news on Elvira, which is the laziest and the lamest way to reveal the game.

[04:35] If I were Stern, bring it to Expo, hopefully it's playable. I just, you know, it's going to happen though.

[04:42] And for here's what I'm hearing about Elvira. It's called Elvira. I want to say haunted mansion.

[04:48] And it's or haunted house. I think it's haunted mansion. And there's like a big castle in the back of the game that looks a lot like the medieval madness castle.

[04:59] And it's supposed to be one of the bigger mechs that Stern has ever put into a game. And I heard the art package is stunning.

[05:06] So get your cleavage dreams ready people because Elvira is coming. I also think moving into 2020 or moving towards it.

[05:15] Here's my guess. I think Stern is going to vault something. I don't think the only thing we're going to see between now and the end of the year is going to be Elvira.

[05:24] I think they're going to vault something or they're going to have another one of these like license games come out, you know, like primus and PBR and all that.

[05:35] All that all that stuff. I don't care about the license games because we know that they're always going to be one of two play fields.

[05:42] Right. It's either going to look like supreme or it's going to look like, you know, the primus game. And that's it.

[05:49] You know, Wollnelly sort of layout, which I think is completely born. But look, I think it's going to be a huge year for Stern.

[05:56] I think Jurassic Park is going to be a juggernaut. Now let's move the Jersey Jack pinball. Okay.

[06:01] Jersey Jacks had a weird year. They really have. And I'll explain why.

[06:06] You know, just at the moment in which Pirates of the Caribbean was becoming one of the most hyped games and reviews of the game were outstanding.

[06:17] I mean, go read Pirates of the Caribbean reviews on Pinside. I don't think I've seen a title in which people have gushed over it the way they gush over pirates.

[06:26] So just when people want the game, they stop making it. All right. Think about that for a minute.

[06:31] Do you think in a million years Stern pinball would ever stop making a game that people want in the middle of when people wanted the most, they take the game off the line.

[06:46] Think about that for a minute. Just let that let that business decision set in. That is why Stern is so successful.

[06:54] So they remove Pirates from the line. Then we get the Willie want. No, not the way.

[06:59] Then we get the yellow brick road edition of Wizard of Oz, which is the biggest cash grab weird version of that game ever. Right.

[07:08] They removed stuff from the game, charged you more money and then didn't even tell you how many they were making.

[07:15] So it was the weirdest launch ever. I was there when Jack announced it. It's like it's limited to 250 this year.

[07:22] Then we're going to make more when I tell you how many how's that for a limited edition. Right. It's it's it's insanely ridiculous.

[07:29] And you know, if you bought a yellow brick road edition, you see here's a thing. Here's a thing.

[07:35] And I don't know if you agree or not, but you never want to spend a lot of money on a game.

[07:40] And then you have to be defensive and make excuses when people ask you, why did you do that? You silly fool.

[07:48] Because only a fool would buy an 11,500 dollar version of Wizard of Oz that has mechanisms removed, especially when you can go get today a mint Wizard of Oz Emerald City edition or a Ruby Red.

[08:03] Both of those games, both of them are selling right now for like $7,500 from collectors because they made so many of them.

[08:11] All right. Thousands of them were made and there are better versions of the game. And you're going to spend 4,000 more on a removed feature version.

[08:20] Okay. So that that game is stupid. Let's just be honest. It's stupid. It's just it was just meant to put something on the line.

[08:26] At least Jack had the game on the line when he revealed it. Okay. Then came Willie Wonka, right?

[08:32] The game where Canada loses all credibility. Willie Wonka is revealed and Jack ships it when he promised by July 4th.

[08:40] I still think they're revealed it too early. I'm happy I got to go play it. I'm happy I got to hype because I was excited.

[08:46] They still revealed it too early when you think about it. They really should have waited to the game was on the line because hype has been syncing.

[08:55] Not climbing on this game. Hype will sync on every game as months go by because we have short attention spans with new games.

[09:05] So Willie Wonka, Jersey Jack, they're big game. We've all been waiting for it. The game that would finally put the assets into the machine that we wanted.

[09:12] It's an iconic classic theme. You know, he has a great relationship with Warner Brothers and you know the story.

[09:19] Game shoots well, Pat Lawler, design game. Nobody's arguing about how the game shoots. Probably the worst, the worst pro cabinet artwork I've ever seen.

[09:29] That standard edition cabinet artwork is horrendous. They should be ashamed of themselves. The early artwork should have been the standard or the, you know, the base level cabinet artwork.

[09:40] They don't understand why they did that. They chose to do that. It boggles my mind. You know, I've been offering my services to Jersey Jack, Pinball.

[09:49] Now Bill Brenn is my friend of the show has been telling Jack just hire Chris. Here's the thing. You don't even have to hire me Jack. I'll just do it for free.

[09:57] How about that? I won't even charge you my $300 an hour like Bill Ray that my clients have to pay. They don't do it. It's like who's calling the shots over there?

[10:05] Right. So they do that. Okay. They give you this like $7500. Jersey Jack game. But that's a great price. But here's the problem. Here's the problem. If you look at Jersey Jack history, let's, let's not look at stuff in a vacuum. Let's zoom out a little bit people.

[10:19] Every single Jersey Jack Ellie game that I'm seeing on the used market sells for like $7500. So if you just wait a little bit, you can get the better version of Willy Wonka. It'll happen.

[10:31] They're going to make so many of them. It's like black arrow edition hobbits. I'm saying the $6400 box. How much was that game knew $8,000, $9,000? I mean hobbits are going to like now like six grand in saying deals, right? These are great games for those prices.

[10:49] You know, so it's you know, they make this game to make it the operators dream. They make it so like the ball times are really fast. Like game is brutal. Like they want the average ball time on Willy Wonka to be three minutes. But here's the thing. Ding, ding, ding wake up Pat Lawler. Wake up Jersey Jack. People who buy your games for the most part are home use players.

[11:10] They don't want three minute ball times. They want to get deeper into the game and they want to have a longer experience with these expensive premium Pimball machines. And you designed it to be the complete opposite.

[11:22] And don't even get me freaking started again that you took the movie. Everybody loved and you butchered it with the code. I will never get over it. How could you do that idiotic move?

[11:35] I will say it to their faces. I will say to them and shows how did you do that? Oh, it's going to be repetitive if people keep hearing the scenes. They love. Yeah, that's a smart decision. That's why they need a canada in the goddamn conference room people when they make these decisions. So I can say, hey, cats sit down. Lawler sit down. You know what I think happened. I think like Lawler like design this game. Kind of a little bit in a vacuum. And then like he just handed it in like, okay, so you have to code this. Okay, but none of these mechs really make sense compared to the movie scene.

[12:04] Oh, so okay, okay, so it spins the gobs stopper spins and then what a ball goes in. Okay, okay, there's nothing in the movie about like the gobs stopper locking balls makes no sense. Okay, it's in there. It's in there. Okay, the walk a bit. Okay, that that's the end of the movie right where they crash out of it and they go over the city. Okay, so why is it? Why is it coming into play before the end of the game? I don't understand. Oh wait, hey, this was the funniest decision they ever made. Hey, people are going to see balls locked up there and they're going to want to play this game to unlock those balls.

[12:33] When they said that, I was like, are you fucking sorry? Sorry for Christmas. Are you freaking kidding me? Like you think that people are going to walk by a machine. See balls up there and say, hey, wouldn't it be fun to try to get those balls down? Oh, yeah, Jersey Jack marketing at its funds. Great design decision, Pat Lawler. You nailed it. You really know how to get people attracted to the games in 2019. Great job. No, look, I'm being a little bit overly strident and making fun of it. But look, you know how I feel. I wanted to love this game so much.

[13:02] And they buried the movie we love. Okay. All right. All right. What's good? What else? Am I being unfair? Should I made more fun of Stern for not giving us the Jurassic Park movie we love or George Gomez saying they can't get the Jeep and they can't get the Jeep in the game. Can't do it.

[13:16] We wanted to, but couldn't do it. Yes, you could. George, here's some money. I got a suitcase full of money. Let's go get that Jeep. Let's call up Chrysler Fiat and get that Jeep in the game. You got to be kidding me. These car companies, let me tell you, they're dying for extra exposure.

[13:30] When you see it in the game, it would probably make you want to buy a Jeep. So they wouldn't have been like, it's a fortune to put it in there. Come on. How much George come clean? I came clean. I told you how much people donate to the show. How much would it have been? I wish these, imagine if these companies, imagine if these companies would actually come clean and tell us, hey, to get this in the game, it's going to cost this much more. And we need this many orders of the game with non-refundable deposits and we'll put everything you want into the game. Wouldn't that be nice? They actually give you the chance to put the assages in.

[13:59] Never going to happen. Let's not have the final wizard mode be when Charlie breaks through the walk ofator. Let's have the final wizard mode be pure imagination, which is a scene that happens at the beginning of the movie. That makes a lot of sense. I hate it. I can't stand it. I'm going crazy this Saturday morning. Okay. So Jersey Jack, what is the future hold? So guns and roses is coming. It sucks that Jack's titles have all leaked. He really unfortunate that when that happens, when that happens, he's like, he's going to be a little bit more

[14:29] like that guy left. Everyone knows everything. It's also here's the reason why Jack tells people that shows that guns and roses is coming. I mean, I mean, I have people who like hit me up. I just talked to Jack. He said, guns and roses is next. And that slash went to Paul McCartney and got him living like, hey, like, why are you telling people this? It's not you need people to be buying Willy Wonka. They should not be thinking about the next title and don't hype the next title while the title that you have on the line needs all the hype. All right. So guns and roses. I think it's going to do great. I think the band is bigger.

[14:59] There are a lot of people realize and music pins are something that seem to do very well. I mean, music pins have done very well for Stern, ACDC Metallica. And this is an Eric game. And I can't underscore and I can't express enough how people are more excited. I think to get an Eric game than a pat Loller game. They just are. I think Eric is is like Keith. I think these new designers are where people are gravitating towards.

[15:29] Because they want new stuff in pinball. And I think here's the big question mark. We know Eric wants to put a ton into a game. We saw it with pirates. We saw with Willy Wonka a lot was taken out. Right. No longer looks like that jam packed Jersey Jack premium experience. It doesn't. It there's no way around that.

[15:47] But will Eric give us a lot in this game or is he going to fall victim to the same direction that wonka went in, which was like, let's take more out. Let's make it more operator friendly. Let's make it simpler. And and we'll it'll be easier to make it'll be less, you know, have less complications. It'll be more reliable.

[16:09] Or is he going to give us everything in the kitchen sink. And I think it's going to be I'm really interested because the original guns and roses game is a wide body.

[16:17] Had two, you know, shooter lanes had the big G and R ramps. I want to see a lot in this game. And so that's what I'm waiting to see is like what magic is Eric going to bring into this game.

[16:27] And it has to be magical. It has to be because here's my other thing. If Jersey Jack really is going to turn a corner and you know get like a game at least or two out a year.

[16:38] I really do think they need to make these games as successful as possible because I just I know how expensive it is to run Jersey Jack Pym. I mean, I don't know the exact number, but it's a big place and they need to have games be successful. They can't have these games sort of just be mediocre.

[16:56] They're not like Stern. They'll never be like Stern. Stern is just on a whole nother level of success. Stern is on a whole nother level of strategy. Stern knows how to do it perfectly. They don't they don't stray the course.

[17:09] And when I look at all these Pymball companies and I'm sorry I'm going to go up a little bit of a tangent. They don't stray the course. Stern shows everyone how to do it pro premium Ellie.

[17:17] As far as I'm concerned, any Pymball company that wants to be at scale and be successful or create demand and hype for their products at launch.

[17:26] They you would at least need like an Ellie and a premium. You need to give two options. People like options and collectors like something that's limited and any company that comes out without limited stuff is idiotic if you ask me. All right.

[17:41] So Jersey Jack, you know, I think it's going to be interesting. I don't you know, I don't think Guns and Roses is really going to start shipping until I think we're going to see it in December.

[17:51] January, February and I think it's going to ship in March. I think that's going to be Guns and Roses. I think we'll see it by the end of the year.

[17:58] And I think Jack brings playable games. The game will be on the line by TPS. He still needs to sell Wonka. Right. Wonka collectors additions. We didn't even talk about that. I become

[18:09] You know how I feel they would just sold all of these games. They're not going to sell very well at the end of the run. It's just the way it's going to go. All right.

[18:17] All right, Jersey. Who's next spooky Pymball?

[18:19] Alas Cooper's nightmare castle game is a game is just coming out without many issues like people are enjoying it. You know, when I when I go quiet on a company, it's usually one or two things. I either don't care at all, which is like my feelings on home pin, which I'll talk about.

[18:35] I either don't care at all because I know you don't care at all or things are just going great. And there's not really much to say other than people are opening up Alas Cooper's. They're enjoying it. They're playing it. The codes getting it more, you know, is going to get improved, which is awesome news.

[18:49] The game. I think the game looks awesome. I don't know. I look over that game and I get it. It has like tight shots. There are brick shots.

[18:55] But have you seen some of the mods people are doing where they're building on top of the castle? I mean, it's freaking cool looking game. I mean, it is. And that company keeps making games better and better.

[19:05] Scott the NEC game number two is I think it's going to be at expo. Not sure what it is. I think that his haunted house stuff has been a joke. I don't think it's going to be. It's going to be that.

[19:14] It's going to be a multi level game. So there will be ramps in it, which will be really fun. I don't is that multi level or just those ramps. I don't know. I don't know. I don't even know. I don't even know much about Pymball.

[19:23] I tell people all the time I've the number one Pymball podcast and I have a very cursory understanding of this hobby, which drives all the other people crazy who do Pymball podcasts who knows so much. They're so detailed with their explanations of whitewood or restorations.

[19:39] Oh, I love you Pymball podcast is you know I do you know I do. I just wish you would say my name sometimes. You know, my favorite show special one led straight down the middle this week in Pymball.

[19:49] You know, I listen to head to head. I listen to it as much as I can. I love it. I love it. I love it. All right, everyone. Let's go back. So spooky. I think Scott the Nese's game number two. No clue what it's going to be. So I think spooky is doing it right. I think we will see the game when it is on the line.

[20:05] But the real question is this that's Scott the Nese's next game. But what's Charlie's next game. So that is what I'm curious about. You know, he he he. There's no rumors of anything.

[20:16] So I'm really curious to see what spooky Pymball comes out with next. All right. Who's next in our list American Pymball. Let's go to American Pymball. Oh

[20:25] My God American Pymball. Okay. I love America. I love Pymball. Why can't it just work out right why can't they just put the two things together in a way that works.

[20:34] So American Pymball has pretty much given up on October Fest sales. They're already hyping game number three. They're they themselves are teasing game number three.

[20:43] So that tells me that they've given up that somewhere in a board room someone's like crap. We have to sell October Fest in August. It's over. It's over. Who like it is so that title is just where they're already being sold on the

[20:58] Use market for less than new. It's over. It was botched from the very beginning. Remember they showed you that game in October of

[21:08] 2018 and then they didn't ship it for six months. Think about that for a minute. Yeah. Good move guys. Not like I've been sitting on this podcast for three years. Don't show

[21:18] anything until the game is on the line and they didn't and look what happened. Another sales failure. And here's what they're doing as

[21:26] they're not getting good sales and sales are dismal. They're building a bigger factory. Yeah, that's what you do. That's that's totally the right move to do with daddy's money. I mean, that's

[21:37] What's happening here? Let's just be honest. I mean double and normal. Where's this money coming from? Oh, daddy's got a company where daddy makes tens of millions of dollars a year making

[21:46] They have an advantage. They have an advantage. They have internal capital. They have manufacturing capabilities. They can make the boy. This company should be

[21:55] crushing it. Crushing it. It makes me so mad because if my dad had that kind of company and that kind of manufacturing capabilities, they like it's it's like it's all right there. And they can't figure it out. I don't

[22:09] understand and you see their latest strategy. If you want a license game, you have to put up the money for the license and then they'll make the game. It's like a hundred

[22:18] thousand dollars plus and then they so you have to take the risk financially and then they'll make the game. Hey guys, newsflash. It's your company. Why don't you put up the money for the license and actually make a game

[22:32] People want. How's that for like a novel idea? And I know I'm being really hard on American Pimball because I love America and I love

[22:38] Pimball and I'm just sick of this. I'm so sick of these companies that like what are you why are you even bothering then? Why are you

[22:45] bothering to make Pimball games if you're going to do it like this? And I've been telling normal. Call me. Call me. Call

[22:52] Canada. Canada Pimball at gmail.com. I guarantee if they would let me come in and help them figure out a theme and a game. I would sell them two to three times more titles.

[23:03] I would even say I know I could do this because they're doing it all wrong. The other thing they're doing all wrong. And sorry, this is I'm getting really loud now.

[23:12] Is they make a game? Let's just be honest on this podcast. Right? This is why you listen to Canada. They make a game and they tell you this. We're going to have one trim level of the game and we're going to make unlimited amounts of it.

[23:23] And there's absolutely no need for you to buy it today. That's that's great marketing. You know why they do that? Because they sit in a room and they're like, you know, it's really not cool the way like these rich guys have their like expensive pins and they get to cut the line and we want to make

[23:39] Pimball for the masses and we want to go after Stern and here's what we'll do. We'll give you more in the game and we'll charge you what Stern does for premium and we'll watch Stern sell out overnight of 600 monsters or 500 Jurassic Parks or 500 Iron Maidens or 800 Star Wars. We'll watch Stern make all those millions of dollars and we won't follow that strategy.

[24:03] We'll do it differently and it's going to work. Yeah, how's it working?

[24:08] Doble and normal. You don't understand. You need to either put a limit on the number of games you're going to make so that people at least have an urgency to buy it or you need to figure out like an

[24:20] Ellie premium strategy with these games, but what you're doing now is not working and I'm going to say this. I'm going to say this.

[24:28] The art is so bad on October fest that they should be ashamed. Let me let me just for a moment tell you guys how easy it is to find a good artist.

[24:39] This notion that like franche or Yeti or any of these artists are sacred beings that can't be replaced is ridiculous.

[24:50] They're every single talented tattoo artist could make a pinball machine. It's art.

[24:56] And they're looking and they would be the first one to tell you this. They know. Look, these gentlemen are franche and Yeti.

[25:03] If you're listening, you are extremely talented, but you know that there are thousands of people with similar artistic talents in the world.

[25:12] Now you guys each have your own niche and styles and that's great.

[25:15] And look, not even all those artists are applying it in ways that they are, but here's the thing.

[25:20] What I'm saying is if you want to find a great artist, you can get a great artist and you can get a great incredible like one of the best art packages in pinball history for like 10,000 or 20,000 dollars.

[25:32] And that's one time cost that will sell you with ton of games.

[25:35] The decision to like put that art in the game, it's game over from day one.

[25:40] And those people stood over that game and said it looks good. Let's make this October fest.

[25:45] So what are we surprised that people looked at it and it looks terrible?

[25:53] And then the, because here's the thing, nobody wants to spend $7,500 on anything and the feedback is, well, it's not as bad as people think.

[26:01] It's not that bad.

[26:02] That's not a response you want from a pinball customer. It's not that bad.

[26:07] You want people to be like, oh my god, it's gorgeous.

[26:09] And you can't say that.

[26:11] But you should have been able to say much better things about it and we couldn't look.

[26:14] I'm not going to harp a thing. Their next game is make or break.

[26:17] It is. It's make or break time.

[26:20] I mean, look, maybe, maybe they can keep funding this themselves, but it's make or break time.

[26:26] The next game, the four themes that they put out there, which were apparently their market research,

[26:31] Robin Hood, Sherlock Holmes, Valkyrie and Pokerun.

[26:35] Okay. Everybody pack up the bags, seal the boxes, close for business.

[26:42] If that's what they're going in that direction against what we know is coming out in the pinball world,

[26:47] it's just, it's just going to keep being the same like, eh, you know, Sherlock Holmes, eh, how,

[26:55] you know, Robin Hood? Have you seen a Robin Hood movie lately? Have you seen how bad that franchise is?

[27:02] Hey, you know, doble normal. Let me, let me throw some of themes out there for you.

[27:05] You could go get, how about, um, how about he man, masters of the universe?

[27:09] How about you go get that? Hmm? How about GI Joe?

[27:13] How about you go get, hmm, I don't know. People might even like just go look at John Lannister's movies.

[27:18] How about Ferris Bueller's Day Off? How about, um, the Matrix, which we know is available?

[27:23] Yeah. How about you spend the money on that and I guarantee you'll sell a few thousand games.

[27:29] Or you could give me Valkyrie and just, yeah, Valkyrie. Okay. Yeah. That'll be a successful's

[27:34] wrath of Olympus. Okay. Look, I know I'm being like a bit of a jerk and this is, this is like,

[27:39] I've been more positive lately, but I just, I just, I just have to say like in 2020 with what's

[27:45] coming from other manufacturers, these guys either get it together or it's game over. I've said it

[27:50] before and I'm not wishing them the fill. You said I'm saying I, they, their destiny is in their hands.

[27:57] Wake up. Maybe they don't listen to this show. Normal. And congratulations on the wedding.

[28:01] But man, now's the time to wake up. You guys have the ability to become

[28:07] pinball famous to make great pinball machines. You're not doing it. You need to hear that feedback.

[28:12] You're not doing it. The other thing is this and I'm going to say this, their distributors are

[28:16] telling them that and here's what their distributors tell me. They're not listening to their distributors.

[28:22] It's like, they're just like pig headed. They need, I look in my business, if I had a team that

[28:27] was running stuff like this, fire them all. Get these people out of here. I want a whole new

[28:32] team with a whole new approach because whatever these people are saying is the way to go is not the

[28:36] way to go. All right. Okay. All right. God, man, canada. What the hell's wrong with you today?

[28:42] Geez. Little, I mean, maybe I just a little hungover, but this is this is not the way to win a

[28:47] third twippy. It's not going to happen. I'm going to lose. I'm going to lose. Who's going to win?

[28:54] Who's going to win? Oh my. Okay. Who's going to win? Do I still have your twippy votes people? Get

[29:01] them ready. I'm going to start campaigning so early. This is going to be like pumpkin spice latte

[29:06] comes out in like August for like Starbucks. It's going to be interesting this year to see you. Who

[29:10] actually asks you for twippy votes? It was like, last year was amazing. Nobody wanted to come out

[29:15] and say the twippy's mattered. And then, you know, I was campaigning early. I just never too early

[29:19] to campaign for a third twippy victory. All right. So let's go to the next company,

[29:26] Chicago gaming company and Monster Bash. So here's the thing about Monster Bash. You really don't

[29:31] hear much about it. And I've said this before, but when you remake a game that's already been out

[29:35] for many, many years, there's just, you know, there's a notion that it's not a new experience.

[29:40] It's just sort of an enhanced experience that you've had before. Monster Bash remake, Ellie,

[29:46] is a gorgeous game. I think out of all the new games I've stood over, it is the one that visually,

[29:53] even with its older artwork, even with it's still the ultimate world under glass game that you

[29:58] could have bought this year. I mean, way more than even Jurassic Park, let's not fool ourselves.

[30:02] If you've, if you've stood over someone's Monster Bash remake, Ellie, and haven't just smiled,

[30:09] and it really does make me sad when I stand over a game like that because it reminds me how much

[30:16] we've removed from Pimball Machines these days and how so many Pimball Machines nowadays are,

[30:22] are like, you know, they've cut corners or they've gone backwards with mech designs. And so,

[30:27] you know, that game is just completely stellar. So, but the problem with Chicago gaming company

[30:32] this year was basically how long it took them to get the games out and they're still not

[30:36] getting the games, all the games out to people. So, you know, that delay has really sort of,

[30:42] I think, made people a little frustrated, you know, it's almost, people have waited almost a year

[30:46] to get their games. And so, what does that mean for the future? So, Cactus Canyon is next.

[30:51] And here's my take on Chicago gaming. They will always sell these games. They will sell them out.

[30:57] The Ellie's in the manner, how many they make of these, you know, whether it's Big Bang Bar

[31:02] or Cactus Canyon or Theater of Magic, they will sell these games because they're making the most

[31:08] desirable version of the best Pimball Machines that have ever been out. And everyone knows that.

[31:14] And when you see these updated versions of the game, they do make the older versions look much

[31:19] more dated. And what they're doing with the screen, I think, was really smart with the sound and

[31:24] with the lights and the mirror blades. It's all the, just the right amount of improvement

[31:30] that makes these games incredible. And so, you know, look, I think we're going to have to wait

[31:34] longer than we wanted to to see these kinds of games come out. I think it would be in their best

[31:39] benefit to get the games out a little bit quicker because how long is this bull run or this bull market

[31:44] going to last with all these Pimball Machines. But, you know, Cactus Canyon is next. And, you know,

[31:50] they're going to improve the code in it I heard. So, we'll see. We'll see. All right. So, what's next?

[31:57] Who am I missing here? So, I've got Spooky, I got Stern, I got JJP. I didn't even do notes. I don't

[32:01] do any show notes. I don't even do any editing of this show. It's why you're sitting in your car,

[32:06] you're you're listening right now. You're like, can I get on with it? Okay. So, let's talk about

[32:12] Suncoast Pimball and circus Maximus. No, I just combined too. So, Suncoast Pimball has cosmic carnival.

[32:22] All right. The game in which they made 250 limited edition plaques. A lot of those plaques

[32:28] going to stay in draws, guys. Drawers draws or drawers, drawer. I am so great at

[32:37] enunciating simple words. All the private school education my parents put me through draws.

[32:43] Yeah. Basically, what I'm saying is they're not going to make 250 games. They're not going to sell

[32:48] 250 cosmic carnivals. Just not happening. I've said it before. I don't understand. I don't understand

[32:55] the person who wants to make money who says, let's make a Pimball company and let's make a

[33:00] Pimball game. Here's why I don't get it. You could go to Stern, you could go to a contract

[33:05] manufacturing Pimball company and they'll make you something if you put up the money. They will.

[33:09] We know that. Why do this? Why? Why? I mean, like, I get why. The people who are doing it,

[33:15] they're very passionate. They love Pimball. It's a passion project. They're putting their

[33:20] heart and soul into it and they're giving you a chance to buy something that's unique and

[33:23] different. I get it. We shouldn't make fun of that. I do applaud people who can get it done.

[33:29] They got it done. They got it done. They got the games in boxes and they got it to people.

[33:33] We should always applaud that on this podcast and in the Pimball world where others failed,

[33:38] they actually did it. Now, but from that point, we're allowed to just critique it. You can make

[33:43] a movie and I could say congratulations. You made the movie. Now, do I like the movie? Is the

[33:47] movie good? Am I allowed to critique the movie? Look, I think the game is a beautiful work of art.

[33:53] I think Donnie's stuff, you know, looks great. Same color palette as Erasmith was a humongous mistake.

[33:59] Looks like an Erasmith game. It just looks like Erasmith. It's like, hey, it's Erasmith. Oh,

[34:02] wait, it's got the cardable. You know what I'm saying? So that was a mistake. He should have

[34:06] gone a different color palette direction on it. Games really simple, basic. You know, it's not

[34:11] that expensive and it's for the person who wants something different. Here's the thing. Am I,

[34:16] like, now I'm like a game to now. If you don't impress with game one, I'm not really looking forward

[34:21] to game two. So we'll see what happens. So I guess just to finish quickly on these guys,

[34:25] they need to do something magical for game two. But I don't think they're going to make money on

[34:29] game one to invest in game two. And with everything coming out, it's another one of like, I'd be

[34:35] surprised if we see them still operating in 2020. I'll just say that. All right. Okay. God,

[34:41] can you are so negative on this pinball? I'm not. I've said so many positive things about so

[34:46] many companies, right? Right? Okay. Who's next? Who's next? I'm going to pull up PINSIDE because I

[34:51] think I'm a P3 multi-morphic. P3 multi-morphic. Right now, Jerry's like, please, please don't say

[34:56] something. Please don't say what I think you're going to say. Please don't say what you I think

[34:59] you're going to say. Jerry, I'm going to say what do you think I'm going to say? It's like, it's

[35:04] maker break time. Maker break, it's been maker break time for seven years on this title. Jerry,

[35:08] I want to sit you down over a steak dinner. If you eat steak, come on, man, let's just go make

[35:13] the matrix. How about we do that? Let's just go get the matrix license. Let's just do it. And let's

[35:19] make money. How's that sound? Why am I doing my Tony? But you know, I'm just like, at some point,

[35:24] you know, Jerry's like a smart guy. He just, he needs, he needs, he needs a dude like me. He needs

[35:28] a marketer. He's an engineer. He need a creative. He needs to, it's art and science. He's got all the

[35:33] science down, but the art is all missing. And I, and I mean that. And you know, he's, he keeps saying,

[35:40] he's teasing this, this game that's about to come out that he says is going to like, you know, be the

[35:46] moment in which people are going to see the potential of the platform. Um, I don't know, I don't know.

[35:52] He's got to do it. He's got to do it. You know, you only get to make love to a woman so many times

[35:56] where if she's not satisfied, you can't keep waking her up every day and say, I haven't quite hit

[36:00] my potential yet, babe, but keep giving me seven more years and eventually I'll, I'll get you

[36:05] to climax. No, that's not how it works in pinball and with the ladies I hear. All right. All right,

[36:12] man, for you kids listening to this show, just, you know, don't ask your parents about that, that

[36:17] metaphor. All right. Who am I missing here? I'm going down the list. I did JJP spooky highway pinball.

[36:24] And now some pinball brothers, pinball brothers, like the big question mark, like, are they going to

[36:28] come back? And I've been told that they are coming back that they have like four or five games ready

[36:32] to go. They've got alien coming back. They've got queen. Ah, pinball brothers. Where are they?

[36:38] You know, they're not saying anything. And someone said to me, well, they're taking your advice, Chris,

[36:43] you said don't talk until you're ready. So maybe they are. Maybe they're not. So big mystery,

[36:49] big mystery if pinball brothers is coming back with some titles. All right. What else is going on?

[36:54] Dutch pinball. We all know the story there. We all know about the big Lebowski, the ARA drama.

[37:01] Here's the thing too. I didn't mention they don't have any cabinets for those 100, they have

[37:05] 100 parts or 100 games worth of parts, but no cabinets. So here's the problem. Here's why I don't

[37:11] think the things ever going to get off the ground again because for Barry to get it off the ground

[37:16] again, games aren't made. So to make those other games, he needs pre-order money or outside investor

[37:23] dollars. Who's going to do that? Who's nobody's going to give them any money? Nobody. No way. You be

[37:31] a, the only reason these games are selling is because they're done. They're in a box and they're

[37:35] ready to go to people. All right. Let me go down the list here. I did it. Okay. I think I've covered

[37:41] everybody of worth covering. Now, I know I left out like king pin and I look if American pinball

[37:49] doesn't make king pin, like go make it dovel and normal. Just go make king pin and sell like

[37:56] a thousand to 1500. But here's the thing too. The king pin guys are also being idiotic. They're

[38:01] not saying they should make it limited and they should charge a lot. It's a rare old game that was

[38:06] worth like $50,000. Don't make 5,000 of them. Don't be stupid. Maintain some of its collectible

[38:13] integrity people. Stop being stupid. So they could sell. We're going to make make it like big,

[38:19] big bar. We're going to make 250 king pins and they're $20,000 each and then you sell out and you

[38:25] go on to the next rare title. Maybe remake King Kong again and do the same thing. We're only going

[38:30] to make 250 of iconic rarest of the rare games and they're $20,000 and that's it. And I guess what?

[38:38] Yeah. Like you'll have some people cry and moan about that and then you'll sell out of all of them.

[38:42] And it's easier to make that many. You maintain the integrity of the collectible nature of those

[38:47] games. Oh, but don't listen to canada. Let's just let's just because these people they wake up

[38:51] they let's just do what's good for the pinball community and they get everybody. Let me tell you

[38:55] Stern is eating everybody's lunch because Stern is the one who's expanding pinball. Stern is

[39:00] getting people in the themes they want. You guys are taking like the die hard enthusiast things and

[39:05] you're trying to like make them mass appeal which leads me to my next company. Deep root. Deep

[39:13] root pinball. I know they listen. Robert team turn up the volume on that expensive speaker system.

[39:18] You guys probably have over there deep root pinball. All the money's going out. Nothing's coming in.

[39:23] Let's talk deep root. We have to. These guys have gotten like they you know I want to say the first

[39:29] thing I want to say is this. I want to say Robert has been a man of his word and I'm not being

[39:34] facetious here. He gave people money back who asked for money. The zidware customers that got burned

[39:42] that had the option of getting money back or getting games. I heard from customers who asked for

[39:50] money back and they got money back from Robert. Now look say what you will about his hyperbole

[39:57] about his bold promises. We have to applaud the man for staying true to his word and doing that

[40:05] for zidware customers who got burned. Okay. So I think I think you know if you can just hear me I'm

[40:10] kind of like clapping with one hand for you Robert but that was well done. Now Robert is also done

[40:16] what I suggested they do which is say nothing and to you're ready to pull the curtain back on

[40:21] something that's going to wow people. I would not have done all of those seminars. I would not have

[40:26] gone to the shows and interviewed themselves congratulating each other and how amazing they are.

[40:30] Congratulations on being the most pinball machines shipped in a single year and we're going to do

[40:35] things that are oh wow and Steve Bowden like moved here so that means everything's incredible. I

[40:39] just wouldn't have done any of that. You know they're they have a lot of intrigue and they have a lot

[40:44] of mystery and they've got a lot of expectations to meet now that are bigger than they should be

[40:51] or needed to be or had to be. We expect a lot we expect a lot we here's what a people are

[40:58] expecting they're expecting to see the most gorgeous pinball machines ever because we've seen

[41:02] Alice in Wonderland we've seen Magic Girl we've seen Raza we've seen what John Papadouk is capable of

[41:08] when he is creatively designing a game and it blows almost everyone else away when it comes to

[41:13] creative design it does. I don't think people would doubt that stand over a Magic Girl even today.

[41:19] There's something about the way he puts creativity down beneath the glass and with how he's able to

[41:26] get the most out of artists that is just simply incredible. You know John Papadouk look at his

[41:31] use of Mad Andrews and then look at Scott Denise's art direction of Mad Andrews with TNA.

[41:37] It's just John just knows how to direct people when it comes to art. He's a crazy mad scientist.

[41:43] So Deeproot is really to me the the thing that I'm looking forward to the most at the rest of this

[41:50] year because come November I think it's the arcade expo in Houston come November deeproot pinball

[41:58] is going to pull back the curtain and finally show us what they've been working on all this time

[42:05] and I am I mean it's August September October like we have about four months to go

[42:11] and in those in that time period they must know that this is the moment. Now I'm not sure if the

[42:18] five days of Deeproot are going to happen I never understood why they did that it was really weird

[42:25] we said it was weird it was pretty much sure it's like you don't create arbitrary deadlines and

[42:30] then miss them you know there's no point in doing it you know someone said to me it was amazing

[42:35] they're like cactus canning is delayed I'm like delayed what when's the release date you can't be

[42:40] delayed if you don't have a release date you know and and that's the whole thing and so I think that

[42:46] come November are they going to show more than one game is it just going to be Raza and that's it

[42:53] I think they have to show I would just show two things here's what I would show if I were Robert

[42:59] sorry got a little congestion there not even going to edit that out you have to hear me like clear my

[43:03] clear my nose I would show magic girl and Raza the reason why we've already seen Magic Girl and in fact

[43:09] if I were going to make a statement if I were going to make a statement and I were them I would show

[43:14] Magic Girl first because we've already seen Magic Girl we've seen what a failure it was but what a

[43:20] gorgeous failure it was and so the titles already out there and so I would show that game and I

[43:28] would say look it look we did it like we figured out the puzzle that was John Papaduke's masterpiece

[43:36] and here it is in all of its beautiful glory and all of its like artistic stupendor stupendor what

[43:44] Chris what the f is wrong with you today I'm making stupendors splendor okay and and and then you

[43:52] know then show Raza with it which are the two titles so the big questions for me with with this

[43:57] company are simple like is it going to be like a swappable play field platform if it is I think

[44:02] it's a huge mistake and we we keep going back to this like does swappable platforms work and pin

[44:09] ball and I hear I hear Jerry's you know rationale for it we saw Andrew highway try to do it which

[44:15] no one ever did there's nowhere to put the stuff like it's you know it's so silly like you can't

[44:23] take out a play field for most people and and and actually you don't want to have to put it

[44:29] somewhere and people like just having a game in its entirety because it's a work of art right it's

[44:35] a work of art like you could easily do here's a good example do people swap out art within a single

[44:42] frame like you could buy a beautiful ornate frame are you gonna like every six months put a new

[44:46] painting inside it and keep the frame there and roll up the painting no people don't do that it's

[44:52] and that's very much the same as pin ball is like I have Batman I want it to be Batman I don't

[44:56] want to like take the decals off take the play field out like change the translate and then have

[45:00] to store all that stuff I don't want to have to do that all right so that's the big thing with

[45:05] deep route is it going to be swappable or not can we take a sledgehammer to the play field or not

[45:12] how much is it going to cost right he was like sort of insinuating they would be low priced

[45:18] but then he also said he'd have like a fifty thousand dollar Alice in Wonderland so somewhere

[45:23] in between five thousand and fifty thousand I expect deep route games to fall so a lot of questions

[45:29] that will be answered see I'm excited because once they finally reveal it then it's it's going to be

[45:36] a moment in which people are either going to love it or hate it I really I think there's going to be

[45:40] like very little like middle ground here and so I'm just curious to see what it is okay now the other

[45:46] question is just the very basic question is is there still room for this company to succeed like

[45:50] is there even an inability to find a new market in this marketplace with the amount of games that

[45:57] are out where is it fall and how are they going to manufacture and how are they going to get games

[46:01] to people quickly you know Robert is on the record and this is why I never would have said this

[46:06] he is on the record for saying when you order a deep route game you will have it in two weeks

[46:12] that's there's no way you can do that Robert there's just no way you can ever get people

[46:19] these you're not making t-shirts here you're making pinball machines and there's just no way

[46:23] that if he gets a thousand orders in or five hundred people everyone's going to get them in two weeks

[46:28] like it's just I just hope all those sound bites don't come back to bite them

[46:34] but other than that I look forward to seeing what these guys bring to the marketplace all right

[46:39] I think it's I think the market you know how I feel the marketplace is way too crowded there's

[46:42] not enough room for all these companies and people are going to fill half these companies are going

[46:45] to be out of business come the end of 2020 you know it you know it to be true it's not canadus

[46:50] fault it's because they made you valkyrie and poker run and Sherlock Holmes oh my god oh my god

[46:56] calm guys just call me American pinball call me let's figure this out all right let me read a

[47:00] couple emails and I'll let you guys go see you can cover a lot you can cover the whole industry in

[47:04] like 40 minutes we don't need two hours okay all right I got an email first of all I asked

[47:10] Melissa over at coin taker with the big Lebowski's would you have spare parts available for sale she

[47:15] said yes we will have spare parts for people who buy those games so I think there's a lot of

[47:20] misinformation in the Lebowski thread people don't know what they're talking about like here's

[47:25] the thing Melissa and Chris are very nice they are some of the nicest distributors on the planet

[47:30] all you got to do is call them up and ask them what's going on they know what's going on because

[47:37] they're in the middle of it you pin-side babies don't know jack about what's going on with the big

[47:42] Lebowski deal all right let's go here so Jeff S said new inbox game conundrum some game advice

[47:51] follow through with your purchase of pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition great one of a

[47:57] kind game you can always sell but I think you'll enjoy it for a while sell the big Lebowski before

[48:04] taking possession you don't have room to store it in your apartment you don't want to move it

[48:09] up and downstairs sell it for 14,000 to buy the other that nets you 1.5k profit doing nothing

[48:18] or advertise it for sale at best offer by date x the latter is kind of douchey so maybe it's

[48:25] better to move this deal to someone else and to take your small commission who wants a big Lebowski

[48:31] for 14,000 I do and I'm making the offer right now that is my max offer Jeff S I love your brother

[48:39] you're crazy if you think a big Lebowski is only worth 14k I've got to pass on your deal all right

[48:46] Doug says Doug Mayharr says Lebowski what would I do he said if I were in your shoes where I had no

[48:54] intention of keeping the game I would give first rights of refusal to anyone that can provide a

[49:00] receipt for their early achiever payment I would not make a large profit I would simply flip it for

[49:07] what I have invested and a few extra bucks for my effort that would allow EA's the opportunity

[49:13] to get the game they want it or flip it and recoup some of the funds they lost sure I could make

[49:20] a couple thousand bucks but in the large scheme of things is that really going to change my life

[49:25] with doing the right thing enrich me more than that money no question doing the right thing at least

[49:33] for me feels 100 times better than pocketing money especially on something that wronged so many people

[49:40] good opportunity to do the right thing here and set an example Doug well Doug look I agree I agree

[49:48] with you I agree with you I think that this one feels bad to sort of crazy flip it and pocket that

[49:56] money but but here's the here's the here's the thing it's like there is a point in which if you

[50:02] can make eight thousand dollars like that's these are not in consequential amounts of money I mean

[50:08] that's that's a lot of money to make for doing nothing right that's 16 because you're pocketing

[50:13] that money that's the equivalent of like 16 thousand dollar bonus at work going into your pocket

[50:20] but I hear what you're saying I hear what you're saying and that's that's the dilemma with all

[50:24] this stuff is you got to weigh the money versus the morality of it and decide on what to do I got an

[50:30] email from Shannon Shannon says hey there just listen to episode 377 but honestly nothing new here

[50:37] surprises long time listeners I think most of your audience knows you are a pinball speculator and

[50:44] you don't have to justify being one or what to do with your money but I would consider is just

[50:50] being transparent up front to your audience the same way you try to hold manufacturers accountable

[50:57] or you come across disingenuously sorry disingenuous later and people eventually may tune out

[51:04] Shannon I agree and that is why I told everyone exactly where I'm at and I will tell you

[51:09] listener of the show exactly what I do with these games I will tell you exactly the money

[51:15] that I sell stuff for and I will tell you the 100% transparent truth of the situation so thank you

[51:21] Shannon for writing it I appreciate you having enjoyed episode 377 all right I got an email from

[51:28] Ian about coming clean episode Chris keep on being you live your best life don't worry about

[51:33] haters life is too short take advantage of opportunities and make as much money as you can so you

[51:40] can live a great life it's just pinball I still love you love the show poor man Ian I love I feel like

[51:46] half my you know I've got listeners who are Democrats and I got listeners who are Republicans and

[51:50] you can tell exactly who's who by by these comments all right let's see I got an episode from let's

[51:57] see this is Tim Leonard he says hi Chris congratulations on your pyrr to see acquisition well

[52:03] not just yet Tim I haven't taken it I still have to figure that out it's a fantastic game and you

[52:08] should keep and enjoy it as far as your future the big Lebowski as early as early achiever number 59

[52:15] whose game you may be buying congrats if you decide to keep it and enjoy it if you decide to flip it

[52:21] for a profit though I hope it catches fire before you do so no offense also did you not stay too

[52:29] long ago that you no longer flip games for profit I think I did I think I did and it's not my

[52:34] intention to do that like I'm not in on Jurassic Park Ellie I'm not trying to speculate every stern

[52:39] early and I didn't buy a Lebowski to flip it I did not I I actually just didn't think I'd have

[52:45] a chance to get it this year but I just love the game and that's why I want one like it's not to

[52:50] make money off of it but if I take pirates I just don't have any room for it so that's that's my

[52:56] dilemma that's my dilemma all right I got an email from Eric Eric Stoick says canada the big Lebowski

[53:03] is a very fun game one of the best worlds in their glass as you might say as you've stated a few times

[53:07] it would be frustrating to own one and not be able to get par 20 breaks in that regard the logical

[53:13] conclusion is to sell it and get pirates CE I'll be listening to see what you do Godspeed

[53:20] well Eric I will tell you exactly what I do when I do it but nothing has been done yet and as I

[53:24] said there are spare parts for Lebowski so does does that start to make more sense all right Ryan

[53:32] says Ryan who sees are Jan Matthew okay Ryan Matthew he wrote in and said traveling for business

[53:38] went to SS Billiards and Minneapolis to play some wonka Ellie and check out the difference between

[53:44] the SE and Ellie specifically the glass elevator mech unfortunately the mech was disabled software

[53:53] locks only on location with the certified JJP tech LTG and the physical lock is disabled

[54:02] what T W what T F okay all right so I didn't know that I mean it sounds like I don't know

[54:08] that means it's broken or not or maybe they just wanted to have the code they just wanted the

[54:12] pro code in both and it disabled I don't know I don't know if it's broken or not I can't tell you

[54:17] I heard that wonka's are having you know typical brand new game out of you know brand new beta

[54:21] tester owners stuff like Jersey Jack will solve all these little issues on the game by the time

[54:27] they ship the collector's editions which maybe you know that's why they weighed it I still think it

[54:31] was a mistake okay all right Kevin Kevin Clements your Lebowski dilemma I vote for you flipping Lebowski

[54:40] as much profit as possible didn't know about the moment you lost oh didn't know about the amount

[54:46] you lost on magic girl think of it as the pinball gods smiling down on you and giving you an

[54:51] opportunity to balance the scales a bit haters gonna hate no matter what man bring that awesome

[54:56] pirates into your place and give the opportunity to wow you congrats on scoring the Lebowski and

[55:01] best of luck making your sunk cost on magic girl Kevin I hear you man it's like I'm still even if

[55:08] I flip it for eight grand I'm just breaking even then yeah I've lost a lot stupid stupid decisions

[55:15] I've made especially chasing magic girl oh the game was just like so beautiful got me got me
