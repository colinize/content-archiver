[00:00] You know when I started Pimbal Podcasting, there were maybe 4 or 5 Pimbal Podcasts in the

[00:16] world, but now there's like 20 of them.

[00:20] And all of you out there, you get all the interviews I can't get.

[00:24] You talk to all the employees at Pimbal companies that won't talk to me.

[00:30] And I thought to myself, how can I give something to the Canadian Pimbal fanbase that nobody

[00:36] else has, that nobody's given them?

[00:38] And I thought to myself, the most valuable thing in this world, way more valuable than

[00:44] Pimbal, way more valuable than these toys.

[00:48] The most precious thing we have is music.

[00:52] And what if I could give you Pimbal fans out there?

[00:55] A little bit of a journey into the musical world of the hottest Pimbal machine that is

[01:02] out there right now.

[01:04] And I could give you the ability to hear music by the band that has created the greatest

[01:12] Pimbal machine ever.

[01:14] I think that no one's ever heard.

[01:16] And I want to play for you right now, a podcast I did that no one's ever heard.

[01:23] And this is a journey into the music of guns and roses in a way that no one's ever heard

[01:28] it.

[01:29] And you're about to hear music that no one has ever heard.

[01:32] And I can't wait to play this for you.

[01:35] It's not about Pimbal.

[01:37] This is solely about music.

[01:40] Because to me, music means more than any Pimbal machine ever.

[01:44] And I hope you really enjoy this.

[01:46] I really do.

[01:47] Because this is not like any other Pimbal podcast you have ever heard.

[01:52] So ladies and gentlemen, the music that never made it onto Chinese democracy.

[01:58] And before we air it, this is the song that got me down on one knee when I proposed to

[02:03] Brenda.

[02:05] Should you feel

[02:09] in

[02:13] just you

[02:17] in

[04:36] just you

[04:40] in

[04:44] just you

[04:48] in

[04:52] just you

[04:54] in

[04:57] just you

[04:59] make me

[05:02] you make me

[05:05] you make me

[05:07] whatever is

[05:09] you

[05:12] in

[05:14] store, which was sort of reconfigured to be what it used to be, which was a club called

[05:21] CBGBs.

[05:22] And taking the stage that night was a band called Guns and Roses, playing for about 200 people,

[05:29] GNF and R, playing for 200 people.

[05:32] And after the show, I'm downstairs in the VIP area, and I walk up to a gentleman, I get

[05:38] introduced to him by his manager.

[05:41] And the first thing that W. Axleros says to me when he shakes my hand, he says, are you

[05:47] canada?

[05:48] And this is a true story.

[05:50] So for those of you who don't know, I am the biggest Guns and Roses fan ever.

[05:54] I was on that forum, my G&R forum, for over a decade trying to get Chinese democracy

[06:01] released.

[06:02] And what you may not know about me is back in the day, my client was Dr. Pepper, and I

[06:08] convinced them to do an incredible promotion.

[06:12] We offered everybody in America, except for two people, a free soda, if Axleros would

[06:19] come out with Chinese democracy anytime in 2008.

[06:24] Now keep in mind, this album had been in the works for 17 years.

[06:29] And guess what happened?

[06:31] He came out with the album.

[06:33] Now Dr. Pepper f'd up the entire giveaway because they didn't think it was going to happen.

[06:38] But I'm just saying, that was me, this little dude, this little guy who grew up in the

[06:43] suburbs of New York, who's a G&R fan, got the third largest soda company to jump into

[06:49] a story.

[06:50] That was all mine.

[06:51] All mine.

[06:53] And so what I want to play for you right now is a really special thing because if you

[06:58] don't know the history of G&R, I'll break it down real simply, big as band in the world.

[07:03] Then all of a sudden, here's what happens.

[07:05] They record a song for the interview with a vampire soundtrack.

[07:11] It was a Rolling Stones cover of sympathy for the devil.

[07:15] And what happened was this, they recorded that song and slashed it as parts and axled

[07:21] it as parts they did it separately.

[07:24] And then all of a sudden when slashed heard the final version of the song, he realized

[07:30] that Axe Rose brought in a different guitarist to play over slashes parts.

[07:37] And that was what ended Guns and Roses.

[07:40] It was basically like 1994, 1995.

[07:44] And that was it.

[07:45] He was done.

[07:46] Slash was out of Guns and Roses.

[07:49] And all of a sudden Axe Rose said, I'm going to make a new Guns and Roses album called

[07:56] Chinese Democracy.

[07:58] That was 1996.

[07:59] Now what you're going to hear right now, you're going to hear the music that Axel created

[08:05] without slash.

[08:06] The music he created to bury the old G&R.

[08:11] And I think there's some brilliant stuff here.

[08:14] And I think there's some stuff here that hits so hard and so amazing.

[08:19] But you know what, Axel didn't release any of this stuff.

[08:23] Like most of it never made its way onto Chinese Democracy.

[08:27] And Chinese Democracy for the fans out there, you can hear my voice straining.

[08:32] It was an album in which we waited 17 years for.

[08:36] And the reason why I hope you listen to this entire show is this means more than Pimball.

[08:42] You think making Pimball Machines is hard?

[08:46] Try reinventing the biggest band in the world with all new musicians.

[08:51] Like music means more than Pimball.

[08:54] Music is way more magical than Pimball.

[08:57] So I hope you enjoy this.

[08:59] I hope when you go to vote for your Twippy vote for favorite Pimball podcaster, you remember

[09:05] that it was Canada that let you hear new Guns and Roses songs that the world has never

[09:11] heard before.

[09:12] Like this is crazy.

[09:14] The story of how I have these tracks is absolutely crazy.

[09:17] Now here's the thing.

[09:19] None of these that you're going to hear with Axel's lyrics have ever been released.

[09:24] So and these songs are 20 years old.

[09:27] Let me repeat that.

[09:29] These songs you're about to hear with Axel Rose singing are 20 years old.

[09:35] And some of them are phenomenal.

[09:36] Some of them are like, yeah, what the hell are you doing Axel?

[09:38] But anyway, I hope you enjoy this show.

[09:41] Canada's Pimball podcast.

[09:43] Here you go.

[09:44] I think the best way to start out this journey on listening to all of the unreleased Guns

[09:49] and Roses material or the demo tracks and the original 1999 to 2001 Chinese democracy

[09:55] tapes, which are infamous now in the world of Guns and Roses.

[09:59] I think the best way to start this out is to understand one simple fact that Axel Rose

[10:04] wanted to make an album that buried his arch nemesis, which ironically was his lead

[10:11] guitarist slash that so much of this album was fueled by his hatred of slash and his

[10:18] desire to record music that sounded nothing like the slash material of Guns and Roses

[10:24] of Old.

[10:25] And we're going to start this with a song from 1999.

[10:29] Now you might not know this, but Axel Rose re-recorded Sweet Child of Mine and put it

[10:35] on the soundtrack to the Big Daddy movie.

[10:38] What's interesting here is one very, very simple change to the song Axel made.

[10:44] In between verses, after he says, whoa, whoa, whoa, Sweet Child of Mine, there is usually

[10:49] that iconic slash solo.

[10:51] You know, actually just removes it from the song.

[10:56] Let's listen to that right now, and this is the ultimate F you to slash in 1999.

[11:26] Did you catch it?

[11:50] Did you see how he just went on into the second verse without that guitar solo and listened

[11:54] to Axel's voice in 1999?

[11:57] What other song do you think he recorded right around this time period that has that same

[12:01] sort of throatiness and almost like there's a frog stuck in his throat kind of voice

[12:07] where he's just straining to get out the lyrics reminds me of this song from Chinese democracy.

[12:11] Or Axel always left so far out from this shore.

[12:32] So here's what we're going to do.

[12:33] We're going to play for you now songs that evolved.

[12:37] And then we're going to get to the instrumental stuff the world has never heard.

[12:41] And we're going to end then with the new tracks that have vocals on it that the world's

[12:45] never heard before.

[12:46] And I think that's a good way to do this.

[12:47] So let's talk about the evolution of tracks on Chinese democracy because he would have

[12:52] a raw album ready to go in 2001.

[12:55] Let's play for you right now.

[12:57] Let's play for you right now the original version of the song Chinese democracy that was

[13:03] ready to go in 2001 that Axel was insecure about.

[13:07] Now keep in mind that this song is recorded without bucket head.

[13:12] We are then going to listen to the part that bucket head added to this album that I think

[13:16] makes it even better.

[13:18] But here's how he originally wanted the song Chinese democracy to sound.

[13:23] Actually let's listen to the album version first so you can hear the difference of the

[13:26] original to the one the world finally got and you let's talk about which one we think

[13:31] has more pop.

[14:07] And don't let that out.

[14:14] Don't find out for yourself.

[14:17] No, don't let that out.

[14:21] You're going to leave this thing to somebody else.

[14:26] If they will miss your narrows real time is your narrows.

[14:33] What I love about hearing that first is you're going to realize when you hear the original

[15:01] version of the song how much more work Axel put into the final version of the song the

[15:07] world got.

[15:08] Now what I want you to hear now is the original version of Chinese democracy and a few things

[15:13] I want you to listen to how there's much less going on musically.

[15:17] You hear a lot more of the bass line when Axel singing just the bass in his voice which

[15:21] is really cool and much raw than the final version which has a lot of slide guitar work

[15:26] by Bumblefoot.

[15:28] We're also going to hear the guitar solo at the end of the song.

[15:31] I believe it's Josh freezes guitar solo.

[15:34] Now on the final studio version bucket head he lets Josh freezes part play and then he

[15:40] adds to the solo which I think makes it even better and you're going to see that as we

[15:44] show some examples of how bucket heads additions made stuff so much better but it's all copy

[15:51] and paste it right it's cut and paste material it's not like he wrote the entire solo.

[15:56] So let's listen to the entire raw version of the original song Chinese democracy.

[16:03] Listen to the guitar solo and then we're going to play bucket heads addition after.

[16:07] So here we go.

[16:08] Here's the original 1999 2001 version of Chinese democracy.

[17:26] Here's the original 1999 version of the original song.

[17:33] I believe it's Josh freezes guitar solo and then we're going to play bucket heads addition

[17:40] to the solo which I think makes it even better and you're going to see that as we show

[17:46] some examples of how bucket heads additions made stuff so much better and you're going to see

[17:51] that as we show some examples of how bucket heads additions made stuff so much better

[17:58] and then we're going to play bucket heads addition after.

[18:03] So let's listen to the entire raw version of the original song.

[18:10] Alright let's stop it there because you hear how the guitar solo goes and then it goes into

[18:37] the original guitar solo.

[18:44] Now listen to the same solo and then listen to how bucket head takes this solo and this song to a whole

[18:51] different level.

[19:21] So you can hear it now from somebody else.

[19:28] You think you got it all right nothing's saying.

[19:35] You think you got it all right nothing's saying.

[19:42] So I think it's another day to make sure that one is a bond from the sale.

[19:49] Now you're keeping around turning out.

[19:56] I think that shows the world why bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[20:10] when he was working on this material.

[20:11] I'm going to do another example of what bucket head brought to this band and why when he left it was

[20:17] pretty much over for this band being exciting when bucket head exited the band.

[20:21] So this another song Axaro was working on called There was a Time.

[20:25] Now I want to play for you there was a time before bucket head and then after bucket head.

[20:31] So let's play for you there was a time and bucket head added about a minute and a half of amazing guitar work

[20:38] that just again brought that song to another level of greatness.

[20:42] So here's the original version of There was a Time.

[20:45] But now I want to die.

[21:15] There was a time before bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[21:29] when he was working on this material.

[21:37] There was a time before bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[21:50] when he was working on this material.

[22:07] There was a time before bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[22:20] when he was working on this material.

[22:28] There was a time before bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[22:41] when he was working on this material.

[22:49] There was a time before bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[23:02] when he was working on this material.

[23:09] Let's listen to the same exact song with bucket head in the band and you tell me this

[23:29] man didn't make this band so much better and was actually more talented than Axel.

[23:34] Here we go, same exact section.

[23:36] Can you find bucket head?

[23:37] But there was a time.

[24:04] There was a time before bucket head was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got

[24:27] When he was working on this material, he was working on this material.

[24:58] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[25:07] It wasn't there.

[25:16] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[25:25] There was a time.

[25:45] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[26:16] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[26:25] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[26:33] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[26:52] There was a time.

[27:01] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[27:10] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[27:19] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[27:28] Oh, I was looking at me by the way.

[27:45] So amazing right now.

[27:47] Here's the real issue with Chinese democracy and even though Axel had a replace bucket head with Bumblefoot.

[27:54] Now let's listen to the outro of Ketcher and the Rye.

[27:57] Now remember, Ketcher and the Rye was recorded with another very well-known guitarist.

[28:01] This is the guitar work of Queen's very own Brian May.

[28:06] And the end of Ketcher and the Rye, I think, is one of the most beautiful outro in the history of guns and roses.

[28:12] And when you listen to how Brian May approached the song, it's very subtle at the end with the guitar.

[28:18] And it allows Axel's beautiful lyrics to take the spotlight.

[28:21] And then you listen to Ron Bumblefoot's Bals version of the outro and he absolutely destroys what I believe is Axel's beautiful poetry with this shredding guitar that just doesn't fit the song.

[28:35] So let's listen to the outro of Ketcher and the Rye the way it was supposed to be with Brian May first.

[28:47] Now let's listen to the outro of Ketcher and the Rye.

[29:17] To be me and life cheek

[29:24] In the woods to wave

[29:28] Far me

[29:31] Suck it and share it

[29:33] When we close in our interact

[29:35] our memories to and speak

[29:42] I will follow it to the end

[29:46] Alright, are you ready to hear that same exact song butchered by Bumblefoot and it starts

[30:12] off right away. Right when Axel starts in with his beautiful lyric on an ordinary day,

[30:18] back in an ordinary way. Just listen to how Bumblefoot's guitar just is doing all this

[30:23] random weird stuff and it's just like takes away from the beauty of the song and I'll

[30:28] let you be the judge.

[31:28] I'm not a judge, I'm not a judge, I'm not a judge.

[32:08] I mean what the fuck right? It's like Axel just didn't know where to stop with this album

[32:15] and that's just the story of Chinese democracy and now let's get to the new stuff and before

[32:21] we do that let's just play I think this is a good example of how so many different types

[32:27] of sounds are in all of these songs and I tell people that Chinese democracy is like a

[32:32] fine cognac. You have to sort of listen to hear all these unique notes that are pieced together

[32:39] and it's kind of amazing that Axel was able to assemble all of these competing sounds into songs

[32:46] that ultimately some of them are actually really good and let's take for example let's start with

[32:50] this song. This song was called three dollar pyramid when they started working on it that was

[32:57] like the track name. I you're going to recognize it once I played for you but let's look at a musical

[33:02] composition by this band and you'll get a sense of like all of the different sounds they were going for

[33:08] and it actually is kind of beautiful when you strip away the lyrics and you just listen to

[33:12] how it's all assembled so let's let's hear three dollar pyramid.

[37:33] Now better was written by Mr. Robin think of nine inch nails now here's what we're going to do we're

[37:38] going to play a mixture of songs that have vocals from this period of time and songs that are

[37:45] just instrumental and you could see you could see how Axel could take an instrumental piece and

[37:52] absolutely change it into a different song by what I'm going to share first so let's do this

[37:57] let's play for you the demo of a song that then became the same name song on Chinese

[38:05] democracy but I want you to try and guess what song this is as I play it here we go.

[38:27] all right so this is a good time to stop it because what you're going to see now is Axel Rose took

[38:48] that demo and made a song out of it now you're going to see what I mean when I say Axel had all these

[38:55] guys just make music and then he adjusted it so that what you just heard he clearly slowed it down

[39:02] and turned it into this song.

[39:25] isn't it incredible how much it changed from the demo that was written by bucket head to what

[39:32] ended up on the album let's listen to Ron Bumblefoot's solo in Shaqler's Revenge and then I'm

[39:39] going to play for you something the world's never heard which is the solo that bucket head had

[39:44] originally put into Shaqler's Revenge and what's interesting is Bumblefoot trying to emulate the sound

[39:51] that bucket head created I don't think is good but here's the album version of the solo

[40:21] all right well that's not actually too bad I think Bumblefoot when he has to recreate bucket head

[40:31] he actually is in his element of shredding right doesn't work when he's recreating Brian May solos

[40:37] now let's listen to bucket heads original solo in the original version of Shaqler's Revenge

[40:44] really cool no one's ever heard this here we go

[41:14] all right right so you can get this industrial metal sound to this album right so here's here's

[41:26] the deal let's start out let's start out with the first of our instrumental tracks that we're

[41:30] going to listen to this is a song that was rumored to be one of the tracks that would be on Chinese

[41:36] this is the instrumental version of a song called zodiac let's take it away

[46:06] now that sounds like a final version of a song that's just waiting for axle lyrics now he

[46:27] also was really fascinated with nine inch nails now this song has axle lyrics I'm not sure if

[46:33] this was going to be the complete song but this definitely shows that axle rose was really also

[46:40] trying to experiment with a nine inch nails robin fink kind of sound and this song is called and

[46:47] this has vocals this is called silk worms

[49:17] okay

[50:17] I mean imagine that on an album by a band that released Sweet Child of Mine in Paradise

[50:26] City, right?

[50:27] It just starts to feel like this stuff doesn't fit in the world of guns and roses.

[50:32] Now speaking of stuff that doesn't fit in the world of guns and roses, let's do another

[50:35] song that has Axel's vocals on it that basically is another 9 inch nails inspired track.

[50:43] This one is called Eye on You.

[51:43] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[51:50] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[51:57] All this time I thought I'd ever hide.

[52:03] I know the best you did I want it to.

[52:07] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[52:10] And say, oh, no, that was all I ever thought I'd ever do.

[52:21] Oh.

[52:33] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[52:40] Oh.

[52:41] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[52:48] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[52:57] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[53:04] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[53:12] Oh.

[53:14] All this time I thought I'd ever hide.

[53:19] I know the best you did I want it to.

[53:25] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[53:32] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[53:40] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[53:48] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[53:55] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[54:19] Again, you can definitely hear the 9-inch nails influence on that song and the Robin Fink influence.

[54:27] Now, let's play another instrumental track that doesn't have Axel Lerigz,

[54:32] but also gives you another interesting insight into the kind of musical sound he was going for on Chinese democracy.

[54:39] And just ask yourself, could you see a song with this kind of musical direction?

[54:44] Could you see it on Chinese democracy?

[54:47] Does it have a home there?

[54:48] This is called Me and My Elvis.

[55:14] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[55:21] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[55:28] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[56:07] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[56:13] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[56:20] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[56:27] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[56:57] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[57:27] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[57:57] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[58:57] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[59:27] I'm the only one who can make it back.

[59:57] What do you think?

[01:00:26] Do you think Axel had a hit there?

[01:00:28] I don't know.

[01:00:29] I don't know.

[01:00:30] A lot of interesting stuff going on.

[01:00:31] But again, you see this like these songs just don't have normal sort of composition.

[01:00:36] There's no defining guitar solos in them.

[01:00:40] It's a lot of stuff going on.

[01:00:42] Speaking of a lot of stuff going on, this next track, Atlas Shrugged.

[01:00:46] Whenever people were talking about the big guns that were going to be on Chinese democracy,

[01:00:51] this is before the album was out.

[01:00:53] We always heard about this song Atlas Shrugged.

[01:00:56] Now, it turns out this song is a little bit like a sweet home Alabama kind of like country guitar funk going on with it.

[01:01:03] And on guitar on this song is Mr. Brian May from Queen.

[01:01:07] And see if you can sort of get a sense of the difference from that industrial rock sound to a song like this.

[01:01:13] And you can get a sense that Axel didn't quite know what kind of sound he was going for.

[01:01:18] Because this song sounds a lot like the same vibe as Ketchur and the Rye.

[01:01:22] So let's play Atlas Shrugged right now.

[01:01:48] Oh, I'm a sound of a band.

[01:01:52] Stove your man still begun, but still enough to show me how to keep it together.

[01:02:04] When I try to make no matter what's the point, your skill always to go.

[01:02:14] Oh, so if you ask me to believe you, I won't mind when you always get a mind of it's own.

[01:02:24] When it says one, I'm the one who's fun and you're the one who's told us just we got it now.

[01:02:36] I'll be the last to say don't follow your heart, but for all you want to take, be man.

[01:02:50] And what you know, what you've done, and what we know you are the best.

[01:03:05] And if you ask me to believe you, I won't mind when you always get a mind of it's own.

[01:03:12] I'll still be the one who's told us just we got it now.

[01:03:16] And if you ask me to believe you, I won't mind when you always get a mind of it's own.

[01:03:24] When it says one, I'm the one who's fun and you're the one who's told us just we got it now.

[01:03:35] But still we're trying to let it go.

[01:03:41] I'll be the last to say don't follow your heart, but for all you want to take, be man.

[01:03:51] And what you know, what you've done, and what we know you understand.

[01:03:59] And I'll never say no, follow your heart, but for all my twenty days, make a man.

[01:04:08] From what you know, all you've been told, be man, I hope you understand.

[01:04:20] And if you ask me to believe you, I won't mind when you always get a mind of it's own.

[01:04:43] And if you ask me to believe you, I won't mind when you always get a mind of it's own.

[01:04:53] And if you ask me to believe you, I won't mind when you always get a mind of it's own.

[01:05:04] When it says one, I'm the one who's told us just we got it now.

[01:05:14] And if you ask me to believe you, I hope you understand.

[01:05:34] Now that's a great example of a song in which I do think there's a little too much going on.

[01:05:39] It's kind of hard to hear acts of through all of this stuff happening.

[01:05:43] It would have been much better just an acoustic guitar and those beautiful lyrics.

[01:05:47] Now again, these are not final album versions of the music, but you see how they're doing that effect on his voice.

[01:05:54] It's just it's like too much tinkering of a good thing.

[01:05:57] So let's jump back into an instrumental track that no one's really heard before.

[01:06:02] And this again will show you sort of that hard sort of metal sound he was going for on half of the material.

[01:06:10] This is a song. Let's see. It's called it's called dummy.

[01:06:15] And this is I think the hardest of all the instrumental leaks.

[01:06:18] Let's listen to dummy right now.

[01:06:20] Now.
