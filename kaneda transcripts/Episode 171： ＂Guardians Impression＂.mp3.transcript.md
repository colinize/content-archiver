[00:00] I can't stop this feeling.

[00:06] Be beside me.

[00:09] Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me.

[00:17] Welcome to Episode 170, something of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:29] We're going to talk all about Guardians of the Galaxy on this Halloween evening.

[00:35] Before we jump in, I just want to say our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of today's horrific terror incident in New York City.

[00:45] I consider this city my home.

[00:47] I've lived here most of my adult life.

[00:51] It is always terrible to see something like this happen and to see just normal people going about their everyday life, not expecting something like this to occur.

[01:02] I just want to say our thoughts and prayers are out there with those people.

[01:07] It was an exciting day at the beginning of the day.

[01:10] I woke up like the rest of you.

[01:12] We knew that we were going to see Guardians of the Galaxy.

[01:16] We didn't know when.

[01:18] I kind of love that we never do know exactly when it's going to hit.

[01:22] I want to talk all about it.

[01:24] I want to talk about the 20 pages on the pin side of people giving their reactions.

[01:29] I can tell this game is working on a level because you're reacting to it.

[01:36] You have opinions about it.

[01:38] We're going to go down a list of all the different types of questions and observations.

[01:43] People I've been articulating and people have been commenting on.

[01:47] I want to read a list of my questions because normally I do this podcast and I just kind of wing it.

[01:53] I'm usually okay with winging it but when there's a new game like this, I want to do its proper respect and sort of answer or give you the listener all of the different things that I've been reading about.

[02:08] There's a lot.

[02:10] My brain's almost numb reading about this game on pin side because when you read a pin side thread throughout the day and 20 pages of the same, it's like the same 25 people screaming back and forth about a new game.

[02:25] Part of me walks away and I'm like do people even like pinball?

[02:29] Are they even excited to get a new pinball machine?

[02:33] Because sometimes I can't even tell.

[02:36] There's like half of the community just feels like these joyless old men who are cranky about everything and the other half are just like take my money now.

[02:45] And somewhere in between is probably the truth.

[02:48] But here are the questions and the things I want to cover on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[02:54] I want to give my initial impressions to the game.

[02:58] Seeing it for the first time, here's what I thought.

[03:01] I want to answer the following questions.

[03:04] Does this pinball machine, is it too similar to Metallica?

[03:08] It's the combination of Iron Man and Metallica.

[03:11] Our Metallica owner is going to pass.

[03:13] Is this one of Stern's best art packages?

[03:16] Is this game stealing anything from total nuclear annihilation?

[03:21] Is this one of Stern's best theme integrations?

[03:26] Is no music from the film a deal breaker for people?

[03:30] Why is the second movie not in here?

[03:34] What about the callouts and the code?

[03:37] Is there any new innovation in this game that we can see?

[03:41] Is there too much grute?

[03:43] Our grutes hands are problem.

[03:45] Do we like the plastic ramps?

[03:48] What do we think of the toys?

[03:50] Which art package do we like the most?

[03:52] Is the L.D. worth it?

[03:54] Where is the topper?

[03:56] What does this mean for other manufacturers that have games coming out in the next few months?

[04:02] Let's just go down the list.

[04:04] First impressions.

[04:06] Whenever a new pinball machine comes out, we all just have a reaction to it.

[04:12] Whenever Stern releases a game for the life of me, I cannot understand why.

[04:19] Stern can't just release the high res images to the fans first.

[04:26] We always get these low res images.

[04:28] Everyone asks to squint and try and figure out what they're looking at.

[04:32] The first impression is usually not always the best because we're either trying to copy images from a YouTube video or look at lower images.

[04:45] My first impressions, because if you're like me and you're a Canadian and you have a podcast, people actually send you more stuff than the rest of the community gets.

[04:59] I saw some better images first and I had to say, the first time I saw this game, I was like, wow, it looks freaking cool.

[05:09] Just take away all of my knowledge of pinball, take away everything that I bring to the table, take away the natural cynicism people have.

[05:19] I think the game just pops.

[05:21] I think Christopher Franchise art package just blew this out of the water.

[05:26] I think it looks great.

[05:27] I mean, he's been telling me for months, he did a great job.

[05:30] He left no stone unturned.

[05:32] He filled it with tons of detail.

[05:34] I think the game looks phenomenal.

[05:37] I think it's not just the artwork which I think is great.

[05:40] I think it's, I was like, wow, we all were like, wow, there's going to be a big grute head.

[05:45] I think it looks great.

[05:47] I think when you look at this game and you stare down at it, it looks like the guardians of the galaxy world coming to life under class.

[05:58] What you know is like one of the things that I care so much about.

[06:02] So that was my first impression.

[06:04] See, I don't look at a game and say, oh, that looks like Iron Man. That looks like Metallica.

[06:08] That's our next question is, does this game, is it like the bastard birth child of Iron Man in Metallica?

[06:17] I can see the resemblance.

[06:19] It's impossible not to see the resemblance of Metallica to this game.

[06:25] I mean, it looks very, very much like a similar layout to Metallica.

[06:30] John Borg made Metallica.

[06:32] So do people really expect John Borg games to drastically go in a new layout direction?

[06:41] And he also is criticized time and time again for reusing mechanisms and features in his games.

[06:50] And look, I have to say, I think everyone out there pretty much holds Metallica up as one of the best-stern pimples.

[06:59] If you were to take this game and you were to put it next to Metallica, yes, you will see layout similarities.

[07:09] From there, will the experience of playing those two machines feel the same?

[07:16] And that's the question I have because I've seen some people say like, I own a Metallica.

[07:21] I'm not going to go in on the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[07:25] And look, I don't know to tell you.

[07:28] I like Metallica, the pimple machine.

[07:31] I'm not the biggest Metallica fan.

[07:35] So I would never own a Metallica, pimple machine because I just don't want to hear Metallica music all day long.

[07:40] I would much rather own Guardians of the Galaxy because I like that theme much more than Metallica.

[07:47] So it's too early to tell what the experiences will be between the two games.

[07:53] But of course, yes, these shots are going to be pretty similar to Metallica.

[07:59] I can't change that.

[08:01] On this podcast, you're going to hear, you're going to hear me give some critiques, you're going to hear me give some observations.

[08:08] Would I have liked this to have been a different layout?

[08:10] That's a fair thing to ask.

[08:12] I really personally don't have a problem with the layout.

[08:16] I'm not someone who looks for every new machine to have a completely sort of new approach to layouts.

[08:24] Because here's why.

[08:26] Like when you do that and you move away from the fan layout, it's really hard to make an experience great.

[08:33] I mean, it takes a lot of talent to break away from building a game where the shots are in places you know people love to shoot

[08:43] and to make something completely original because there's only so much you can do with the real estate you have on a pinball machine.

[08:49] But I'll say this, my first impression looking down at the game, I think this is one of Stern's nicest looking pinball machines ever.

[08:59] I think just on a very sort of superficial looking at the game.

[09:04] And I showed this game to a lot of people out there that are gamers.

[09:09] Like I show a lot of people at work new pinball machines.

[09:12] The reaction to this game upon first glance, far more positive, far more exciting to look at this pinball machine than Star Wars.

[09:21] Then Batman 66.

[09:24] I think this game really has that pop.

[09:28] I would say the art package, not as detailed or crazy as Aerosmith, which is probably the craziest detail of the art package.

[09:37] But I think there's a lot more to get excited about when you look at Guardians as an overall package than Aerosmith.

[09:44] Alright, so do I think this is one of Stern's best art packages?

[09:48] I just answer that. I think it is.

[09:51] Do I think it's the best?

[09:53] That's a hard question.

[09:54] Art is very subjective.

[09:56] And the artists that they have, Franchie, Dirty Donny and Zombie Eddie, all amazingly talented artists.

[10:03] They create beautiful looking things.

[10:06] They have different styles.

[10:08] And I think it's kind of unfair to say like one is better than the other.

[10:11] I am happy to take a game from any of those three gentlemen.

[10:16] Okay.

[10:17] I think when they're not working on a project, I'm not excited.

[10:21] When I look at the art on Star Wars compared to the art here, I'm not excited.

[10:26] I won't even go into art packages on games like Game of Thrones, right?

[10:32] On The Walking Dead.

[10:34] Art packages on, you know, I'm trying to think, what if I missed?

[10:38] Aerosmith looks great.

[10:39] Ghostbusters looks great.

[10:41] Batman looks great.

[10:42] Guardians looks great.

[10:44] You know, I really think Stern has turned to corner and their games now have great art packages.

[10:49] Something people have been talking about.

[10:51] Is this game stealing anything from Total Nuclear Annihilation?

[10:57] And when I saw this, I just wanted to like rip my hair out.

[11:00] First of all, let's just set the record straight.

[11:03] Scott, Denisey and Mad Andrews, they're, they're package of Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[11:10] They didn't invent 80s style artwork.

[11:14] Okay.

[11:15] Can we just like stop with this nonsense that like neon colors and a grid, you know,

[11:20] sort of system and, you know, these bright pinks and, and neon's and lines and grids.

[11:27] Like, it's like, they're totally ripping off of Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[11:32] You're out of your minds.

[11:34] It's just the art style from that error.

[11:37] And the Guardians of the Galaxy art style comes from that error in the films themselves.

[11:44] Isn't like, Frenchy taking it in that direction.

[11:48] It's very, very colorful.

[11:51] Okay. And that's where the similarities end.

[11:54] Look at the amount of detail on this play field versus the amount of detail on Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[12:01] I've always said it.

[12:02] I thought like TNAs got like really cool, you know, back glass.

[12:07] But just none of like the detail like, like, like a lot of detail made its way onto the play field.

[12:12] Apples to oranges, some may say.

[12:14] I don't know. A TNA is the same price as a Guardians Pro.

[12:19] So we'll see, right?

[12:21] But I think there's nothing stolen there.

[12:24] And then the other part is Scott Denise's lock is very cool.

[12:28] Scott Denise did not invent locking a ball using a drop target.

[12:34] He didn't invent that.

[12:35] We saw it in Star Trek. We've seen it before.

[12:38] It's not the Denise lock.

[12:40] And he locks more than one ball, which I think is his thing, right?

[12:43] So I just want to say for the record, I don't think there's anything going on with like Stern hijacking anything from Scott's project.

[12:52] And I think he would agree with that.

[12:54] Okay. All right.

[12:55] Now next question.

[12:56] Is this one of Stern's best theme integrated pins?

[13:01] And by theme integration, it's more than just artwork and features and world on their glass.

[13:08] So I would say that visually, yes, this is one of Stern's greatest theme integrated pins.

[13:16] Image in which I mean if I stand over this, I unmistakingly and transported to the world of Guardians of the Galaxy.

[13:25] There is no mistakenous for Guardians of the Galaxy.

[13:28] And I think it has a lot of elements that are very fun from the film.

[13:32] And I think the artist's great.

[13:33] And I think, you know, I think it, it's theme integrates on a visual level.

[13:37] Okay. But that is only half, maybe not even half of what a game needs to have to have great theme integration.

[13:46] And I'm going to talk about the rest of it.

[13:48] And I'm really worried about the rest of it.

[13:50] I mean this, again, this is going to be like a really fair and balanced critique of what we know so far and what we think is coming.

[13:58] And I want to be fair.

[13:59] All right.

[14:00] All right.

[14:01] Because my next question is no music from the film, a deal breaker for people.

[14:06] And this continues to be to me the biggest head scratcher.

[14:12] Like what are they doing over there that currently as it stands on October 31st on a game they just revealed.

[14:21] They are not including as of today any of the license music from Guardians of the Galaxy.

[14:31] It's an original score.

[14:33] Stern is making for this game.

[14:35] And here's my problem with that.

[14:37] And I think all of you share my concerns.

[14:40] The music, you know, the awesome mix volume one that Star Lord's mom makes for him.

[14:47] The music in this franchise is what this franchise is all about.

[14:54] You cannot bring the life of these films.

[14:58] You cannot make a classic game, right?

[15:03] You can make a good game based on Guardians of the Galaxy without it.

[15:07] But to make a great game, a game that will never leave people's game rooms, a game that like captures the game.

[15:16] There's the awesomeness of the films.

[15:19] You can't make it without the music.

[15:21] You can't. There's no way you can do it.

[15:24] And the music can be licensed.

[15:27] It can be.

[15:29] And Stern needs to get this music into the game.

[15:33] There's no way around it.

[15:35] And the fact that that wasn't already inked and the contracts haven't been signed.

[15:41] They didn't promote the fact that they had even it was just like three to five licensed tracks in the game.

[15:47] I mean, doesn't everybody want this game to start with that ukushaka ukushaka?

[15:53] Like that's how this game should start when you hit the start button.

[15:58] I'm sorry.

[16:00] And like it's so frustrating to me because it's like once again, we have a game that looks the part.

[16:07] Again, that's got like all this fun stuff going on.

[16:10] Again, that I think a lot of people want to own.

[16:13] But this could be the Achilles heel of theme integration with gardens of the galaxy.

[16:20] And again, like there's let's take like the walking dead, for example, another Stern game where they didn't didn't have any of the actors on the play field.

[16:29] They didn't have any of the actors and the callouts.

[16:32] They didn't have, you know, it was like devoid of all that.

[16:35] But the walking dead as a show, you can get away with it because the walking dead as a show doesn't rely so heavily on iconic songs that are playing during specific scenes in the show.

[16:49] The way guardians of the galaxy is all about the mode with the music.

[16:54] And I think, you know, you can't have the modes without the music.

[16:57] This is a huge, huge issue that I know is being worked on.

[17:02] Now here's the thing. I know that it's not a done deal that it's, they're not going to be able to get stuff in.

[17:08] But for the prices that Stern is charging for these games, they need to get some of this music into the game.

[17:13] That's it. I think everyone should email them and be like, I will pay extra.

[17:19] No, you shouldn't have to. You're already paying extra. You deserve to have these in the game.

[17:25] I mean, we are just coming off of the shock from, you know, from Pirates of the Caribbean with Jersey Jack.

[17:31] It's like, what do you really have? You can't even show the faces of actors on the LCD screen.

[17:40] You can't even use the original main theme song in the game.

[17:45] Really? And did you hear like David Teel's like, excuse for that. He goes, oh, you know, movie theme songs.

[17:51] They're not really designed to work well with pinball. I make music that works well with pinball.

[17:57] David, I think you're super talented. I love your work. But that's a crack of BS, man.

[18:03] Are you telling me the Star Wars theme song written for the Star Wars movies in the 1970s?

[18:09] Doesn't translate perfectly well over to the pinball machine? It does.

[18:14] And the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song is awesome in the films. It would work awesomely well if that's what played in the pinball machine.

[18:24] Don't tell me that music needs to be like specially optimized for pinball. Get out of here. Get out of here.

[18:33] Music is music. If you play the opening guitar chords to switch out the mind or paradise city, that's not going to sound good.

[18:40] We need to alter that for pinball. Get out of here. All right. So let's see. What's next on my list of questions?

[18:50] Why is there no second movie in the game? So this is confirmed. For those of you who saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2 recently, who loved it, I am one of them.

[19:01] I was so excited when I knew there was going to be a Guardians of the Galaxy pinball machine after I saw the movie because I felt like, oh cool.

[19:10] There's going to be all these cool modes from this film. Imagine Father and Son mode during the funeral.

[19:17] And then I saw the game today. I was like, is the second movie in here? It was like really hard to figure that out at first.

[19:25] But I'm here to tell you that there's 100% there's no second movie material in the game. Now this is just kind of weird, right?

[19:37] Because the movie, the second movie just came out. And if you're Marvel and you give Stern the license to make Guardians of the Galaxy pinball machine.

[19:49] And they say we only want to make the first movie. It's so strange to me that Marvel didn't say, wait a minute.

[19:56] Like we have another movie coming out. If your game is going to be coming out in sort of fall or winter of 2017, let's make it both.

[20:08] And let's give you the script under ND. Let's show you some scenes. Like I just am so confused as to why it's not in there.

[20:17] When every other movie that has, or movie sort of pinball machine that has come out has usually incorporated all of the films up to that date.

[20:28] So prior to the Caribbean, it's going to be all five. Lord the Rings was all three. The Hobbit was all three. It just kind of makes me laugh.

[20:36] It's like Jack puts all three Hobbit movies into his pinball machine, but he can't get the pinball machine out in time for the third movie to come out.

[20:45] Stern releases their machine after the movies come out and they can't even get the second film in.

[20:52] So it's just really weird because clearly Hobbit was being worked on wall, even before the third movie was out in theaters.

[21:00] Stern decided not to include the second film. Now if you're like me and you make assumptions and you make guesses,

[21:08] I would say the reason they did that was because of licensing and they didn't want to pay more to have both movies factored into the game.

[21:18] I don't know. I'm making that up. I could be wrong. But I think it's a bummer. I think there are those of you out there who do like the second movie and to not see it in there.

[21:29] I actually think the second movie's soundtrack is much better than the first. I really do. I think like songs like Fox on the Run, Father and Son.

[21:41] When Yandu is breaking out of that ship and he's whistling with the arrow, he's like, just a little bit closer. So good. So good. We're not going to get any of it.

[21:53] Oh, this keeps like knocking down my theme integration points. But let's go to my next question, which is what about the callouts and the code?

[22:04] So that's a question that there are no answers. And when I say callouts and code, it's pretty, it's got people nervous that we didn't see anything on the LCD. They didn't show any LCD clips, which leads people to believe that the code is really early on.

[22:22] Remember when we first got the teaser video for Erasmith, we saw stuff on the screen. I think we also saw stuff with Star Wars. The fact that they didn't show anything on the LCD has people worried.

[22:35] We didn't hear any callouts in the game either. All right. So what I'm hearing now is they probably got, I think they got access to Marvel's sound alike people.

[22:47] But we probably won't get callouts from actors who were actually in the movie. And again, that is 100% a decision by Stern not to invest the money in doing that.

[23:01] And again, at the current price point of these machines, Stern should pursue voice talent from the films. You don't have to go get Chris Pratt, but there are a lot of characters.

[23:18] You can't tell me the guy who voices, you know, Yondu's as expensive as Chris Pratt or the guy who voices, Dracks is that expensive, right? They could do it. They haven't though.

[23:30] If there were callouts from an actor in the movie, that would have been in the press release and in the feature sheet today. And it's not.

[23:42] So I'm really worried that again, the theme integration is going to suffer because of that. All right. The other question I have, is there any new innovation here in this game?

[23:53] And I've just, you know, a lot of people have been complaining that, you know, this is John Borg, like recycling and this and that. And it's not like the most innovative look.

[24:04] I don't think the game like lacks innovation. Right. I think the Groot head and we're going to talk about that in a little bit.

[24:14] It looks really cool. I think the fact that it has three magnets under the play field that disrupt the ball is really cool.

[24:23] Let's see what else in terms of innovations. You know, if we, if we look at the word innovation, like something that has been innovative, right.

[24:35] So it's been designed new. We haven't seen it before. Yes. I think this machine completely lacks like innovation in its normal sense.

[24:46] Okay. And in its literal sense, there is not like innovation. But there is a real sort of sort of curation or malgamation of things that will work well together. And I think, and here's what I mean by that.

[25:03] If you ask me, what are elements that every game should have? It should have a bash toy. There should be magnets. Okay. There should be like two ramps.

[25:12] There should be like, you know, stuff the ball does that makes you go, wow. And I think this pinball machine has all that. Okay.

[25:20] So it has all the necessary elements to make for a really, really fun game. It looks really, really fun.

[25:28] And I think the things that will happen in the game, combine with the personality of this franchise, will equal a fun experience. Again, too early to tell. I know, it's played it. I haven't played it.

[25:41] But it looks like it will be fun to shoot. All right. Now the main, the main bitching I've seen today, and it's all about Groot and Groot's hands.

[25:52] And is there too much Groot in this game? Is there too much Groot on the artwork? Groot, Groot, Groot, Groot. He's not a main character. How come he's all over the place?

[26:01] Someone said it'd be like making Star Wars where Chubaka is like the main focus of the pinball machine, right? A big Chubaka head that you bash.

[26:10] I think the people who are saying this probably haven't seen the movies. It's not, look, Groot is one of the main characters. Okay. He's not, he's not, he's not, he's, he is the comic relief sidekick character.

[26:25] But if you're going to put a character from Guardians of the Galaxy that you bash, and that can add comic relief and talk and their mouth moves, and they eat pinballs, which character would you choose to do that?

[26:41] Right. Would it make sense to have a big star lord mask up there or Drax's face there or Yandus? It makes perfect sense that this machine has chosen to use Groot as like one of the main features. Okay. I, I, I think it works completely fine.

[27:00] I think bashing him up the middle of the playfield, I just love that there is a toy on this machine that sits there in the middle that casual players can walk up to and say, hey, I know what to shoot for. I'm going to shoot for Groot's face.

[27:18] Like most pinball machines that I think fail to, to be designed well, don't have that one singular thing I know I need to shoot.

[27:28] Look at Star Wars next to this. Does it have like that one area where we're like, this is where I need to shoot, this is where I need to hit? No.

[27:36] This, this Groot head, it's awesome. I love the fact that it eats balls. I love the fact that it spits balls out in multi ball.

[27:44] I love the detail of it. Come on guys, look, the steering looks like they finally made like a nicely detailed, modeled, you know, sort of toy on the playfield.

[27:57] And then the hand, let's talk about the hands because the hands are the other part that everyone's complaining about the hands and the hands are going to block the player and you can't see the ball over the hands and look.

[28:10] When I showed this game to people today, the thing everyone pointed out was like, it looks so cool with like Groot's hands.

[28:17] And then when I talked to my pinball friends, my, you know, the die hard players, all they were doing is whining about the hands.

[28:24] The hands are going to block the view, the hands with this, the hands with that. And we've seen the hands from a few different angles.

[28:29] And it looks like when you're not just looking directly down, they don't block the view that much.

[28:36] I think the hands are freaking awesome. I love the fact that they are scaled properly with Groot.

[28:44] It almost looks like he popped his head in his hands out from underneath the cabinet and broke through the game.

[28:50] It looks freaking awesome. I mean, show me another game that has a character that like sort of like his arms in his head like pop out like this.

[29:04] You know, go look at Magic Girl, the big expense of giving my bedroom. Look how John did the middle mechanism with the arms of the automaton.

[29:12] Look, look how silly that looks. Look how awesome this looks and how nicely sculpted they are.

[29:17] Do I think airballs are going to break the fingers on Groot's hands? No. Do I care that Groot's hands block a little bit of the shots?

[29:24] Absolutely not. I think when you're standing over it, we have to see it's not going to be as bad as people think.

[29:30] If you look at the spaces between his fingers, I really don't think it's going to be this challenging thing to see the ball when you're playing this game.

[29:41] I don't know. That is my guess. But I love the hands. When I keep hearing people say, well like pros the way to go.

[29:48] Because I don't want to have the hands on there. I get out of here. Get out of here. Who wouldn't want it to look like this? Come on. Come on people. Be real now.

[29:59] Alright. What else I want to talk about with this game? I don't want to go too much into the difference between the pro, the premium and the LE.

[30:09] It's funny how stern. They yank out the weirdest thing between the pro and the premium.

[30:17] Because the premium and the LE are in terms of gameplay, it was the same. But from the pro to the premium, they yanked out spinners.

[30:24] Like two spinners. I think some fashers. And it doesn't have like the full RGB LED spots in the game.

[30:31] But taking out like spinners. People are like really stern. Like you're going to take out like a $5 item.

[30:38] And I think stern like does this stuff because they just need to find some way to differentiate the gameplay.

[30:45] Now the good thing with Borg is you don't lose anything. Like you don't lose any of the main mechanisms. They didn't take the magnets out.

[30:53] Isn't it funny? Star Wars has no magnets and guardians has three. It's almost like they put the magnets that should have been in the middle of Star Wars.

[31:03] If you look at that empty space in the middle of Star Wars, that kind of magnet mechanism, I feel like should have gone into Star Wars is found in guardians.

[31:12] So yeah, so look, I like the hands. Get off of Groot's hands. You know, get just just stop.

[31:23] All right, do we like the plastic ramps? I know people have said they want the metal ramps. Again, I don't really have a problem.

[31:29] Whenever I play Walking Dead, I have no problems with those ramps. People are saying Stern uses really thin plastic now. They need to attach the ramps.

[31:37] If you look at the area where it goes around the back area of the game and the cabinet, it's like two pieces have to be like bolted together with a piece of metal, which makes it more flimsy.

[31:51] Look, I think it looks great. Would I have liked wire form ramps? I don't really carry their way. I like plastic ramps. I like wire form ramps. I like both of them.

[32:05] I think sometimes I like the clear plastic ones because it doesn't distract me at all. It makes my eye go towards the other stuff on the play field.

[32:15] But the wire form ramp probably higher quality feels like a more of a substantial higher quality thing.

[32:23] We just saw Houdini switch over from plastic to metal and how that improved the look of the game. Is this a cost-cutting measure on Stern's part? Probably.

[32:34] But what am I going to do? I'm going to bitch about that. I'm not going to not buy a game because of ramps.

[32:41] What do I think of the toys? Look, I'm trying to see what are the toys on the game. We've got the magnets. You've got rocket. He's not a toy per se, but he's not like a little structure that moves back and forth.

[32:56] It's not as bad as the tie fighter on the spring, but it's still not like the most epic thing ever.

[33:03] Obviously Groot is the big toy in the game. You've got the orb that opens up the infinity stone, that sort of Jurassic Park egg opens up.

[33:13] It is funny that it's exactly like the Death Star. It seems to function a little bit. It doesn't seem as clunky as the Death Star, just in terms of the way it fits together. It's just two pieces.

[33:24] But that's it. You don't really have many other toys in this game. I'm looking at it. You've got the infinity stone, you've got Groot. That's it.

[33:37] You've got the magnets underneath. There's not that much here. It kind of looks like there's more here because of the complexity of the artwork.

[33:49] In terms of the modes, I'm not going to go into all the modes of the game. Other podcasts will do this. They'll go into antiquity shop and sibling robbery.

[34:00] It's got that sort of in the middle of the game. There's almost looks like Star Trek with all the modes laid out. I'll say this though. What I really was happy to see is the game is not hard to figure out.

[34:13] If you look at the objectives of the game, I think this is going to be a game that's not going to require a manual to know what to do.

[34:22] And I'm really happy about that. A lot of people out there have got tired of white sort of coding and how he codes his games that are so complex.

[34:33] You can't really figure out what's going on. It's all these stacking of this and that and combining of this and that and multipliers going everywhere.

[34:42] Star Wars code is a goddamn complex nightmare. Same thing with like Game of Thrones. I want to go back to understanding what I'm doing in a pinball machine.

[34:53] It shouldn't require hours and hours of learning what to do. This game is going to give people just immediate satisfaction.

[35:04] Which is what pinball should have. You're going to be able to walk up to it and immediately figure out how to get a multi ball by just shooting Groot.

[35:12] Very sparky like. Shoot up the middle, hit it enough times and you'll get multi ball. How hard is that? That's how it should be.

[35:19] Keep hitting the genie and toad in. Hit him enough. Start multi ball. I think.

[35:28] What else do I want to talk about? Let's talk about the art packages because again, it's so silly to try to review more of this game.

[35:37] Well, one thing before I move on to art, it's like who's coding the game and I just want to say something. I want to make a point and I want to just say what I wish would have happened.

[35:49] I really wish Stern would have put lineman on guardians of the galaxy because lineman did Metallica. Metallica has a similar layout.

[36:01] How easy would it have been for him to bring the same sort of greatness to this title pretty quickly because he's familiar with the shots and the combos and everything this layout provides.

[36:14] Instead, he's been wasting away for a year on Batman 66. It's still not great. I don't think Batman will ever sell as well or be as popular as guardians and I really wish guardians would have had Stern's best coder on it.

[36:33] But again, just an observation. What do I think of the art packages? So here's a thing and we're going to talk in the same vein about the Ellie and which one do we like the best?

[36:48] Now, I'm just looking at the cabinet artwork between the pro, between the premium and the Ellie. I have to say, without a doubt, without a doubt, I like the pros cabinet artwork the best.

[37:06] I think the characters are laid out the best. I like the circular laser beam framing of those characters and I just like the way the colors work on it the best.

[37:23] The premium, yeah, groups in their middle. But again, it loses some of that symmetry of having that nice like haloed framing of the pro. And then the Ellie in terms of the cabinet artwork, it's like all Groot and Rocket.

[37:38] I don't know, I just don't think it's got the same amount of colors. I don't think it's as interesting to look at. I think the characters don't, I like them better when they're huddled together the way they are on the pro.

[37:54] I think the pro should have been the Ellie cabinet. I really do. Okay, this is objective. They all look good though. They all look good. Let's start there.

[38:06] And then the big sort of question of the day is, is the Ellie worth it and the, you know, that gold trim that mustard colored trim seems to be rubbing people the wrong way.

[38:21] Okay, and I haven't seen in person. I'm not sure what it looks like. It looks like they're, they're trying to match the gold with the gold that's in the gardens, the galaxy sort of logo.

[38:35] And, and if that's the case, you know, I don't know, it kind of goes with, you know, that 80 sort of purple and red and violet sort of hue.

[38:47] But I've been hearing people complain about it and people shouldn't ever have to complain about in Ellie.

[38:55] But people have complained about almost every Ellie story that I've ever seen. I mean, they complained about the armor and star wars. They complained about the green and ghost busters.

[39:03] There hasn't really been an Ellie where people are like, yeah, that is like by far like the best package. I mean, when I say that, I mean recently. Of course, you know,

[39:14] you know, Tron Ellie people love people love Star Trek Ellie, you know, those I think stern like you looked at the Ellie and you saw like I wouldn't have changed the way they dressed this game up.

[39:26] But with this one, I think people are on the fence about it. I know people will go in on the Ellie's because simply it is an Ellie.

[39:35] Which leads me to my question, do I think the Ellie's worth it now? Let's talk about what you get with the Ellie that's different.

[39:42] You get a shaker motor. You get a mirrored back glass that has mirrored artwork, which is nice.

[39:48] You get the inner art decals that are in the game. So you know, you know, they're not mirror blades. They're decals. We saw those with Batman.

[39:57] What else do you get? You get different artwork. You get the mustard colored armor.

[40:05] And for the most part, that's pretty much it. You get obviously you get the signature of Gary and John Borg.

[40:13] But you don't get a topper. You don't get the sterns in Visi Glass that they make.

[40:22] I was bummed out that you didn't get the topper. They're going to sell it separately. But is the Ellie worth it? Now here's the thing. They're making 600 Ellie's.

[40:32] Now when I heard that, I did feel that was too many. I think 400 should always be the number that they make of Ellie's.

[40:39] I don't like that stern has a moving target on Ellie's. I don't like that Ghostbusters was 400. Batman was 240. Guardians is 6. Star Wars is 8.

[40:55] You know, because it's just like enough already enough already. It's such an arbitrary decision at this point.

[41:03] And it I just don't think anything over. I have to be honest. I don't think anything over 250 games to me feels limited. I just don't.

[41:12] I don't think 400 feels limited. I don't think 500 feels limited. I think 250 to me is the sweet spot for a limited edition game.

[41:22] Anything less is even better. But once you start getting these high numbers, they just don't feel rare.

[41:29] I don't want a limited edition game to come up often for sale because I don't want people to let them go.

[41:35] And that's why when I say that number 250, if you look at Batman Ellie, how many of them have you seen come up for sale?

[41:43] And the reason why people don't want to sell their Batman Ellie's is it's really hard to replace it.

[41:49] The topper was exclusive to it. And that's the other part that started to frustrate me with stern with these Ellie's.

[41:56] If you're going to charge $9,000 and you don't give it anything exclusively like a topper, the other stuff.

[42:05] But toppers man toppers are things that really do complete the package and people want one that's not found on other machines or won't be sold separately.

[42:16] And for the love of God and crazy levy, he said it best. People need to stop trying to figure out the bill of materials difference between the premium and the Ellie to decide if the Ellie is worth it.

[42:31] The Ellie is designed for the collector who wants to have the rare version, the most expensive version, he's willing to pay for it.

[42:40] And that is why they make them. There's no different features, there's no different gameplay, it's all about window dressing.

[42:51] That's all it's about. That's all it's about. Those guys, they point at the signature on the apron and they think that it makes them excited.

[43:01] I don't have an idea where the topper is, I was one of my questions. I wish stern would have these toppers ready when the games are ready.

[43:09] Where's the Star Wars topper? Where is it? I mean, Star Wars came out in July and it's August, September, October, November,

[43:20] like four months later we have no topper. How long can it take to make a topper?

[43:27] All right, so I'm out of questions. I'm kind of tired today. It's been a long stressful day. Lots been going on. It's been fun to see this game reveal.

[43:38] I want to sort of close with a few thoughts about just pinball reveals in general and how we all get.

[43:46] We all love pinball. If you listen to this podcast, like you're a fan of pinball, all pinball on some level is fundamentally fun.

[43:56] It's hard for a pinball machine not to be fun. It's hard to look at a pinball machine which is a toy and say, you know what?

[44:04] It doesn't look like it's going to be fun playing this. I think when a new game comes out, it is a great moment where we all want to give our opinions and our observations.

[44:15] And I think everybody's opinion is valid at this point. You know, you could say you love the art. You could say you hate the art.

[44:23] You could say this is one of Stern's best. You could say Stern is mailing it in. And God knows we get all of that variety on pinside.

[44:31] And I'd be a hypocrite if I said like, well, you know what? I'm not going to nitpick because I do nitpick. I've just spent 45 minutes talking about the game, nitpicking on some things.

[44:44] You know, beating my chest saying what I think is going to be a deal breaker if they don't do this or that. Because deep down inside, we all are chasing after just like sort of like the perfect pinball machine.

[44:56] The thing is the perfect pinball machine does not exist. We all want a machine where we love the theme.

[45:04] We don't want to feel like there's anything missing that we would love to have in there. And I think that's what's been a struggle for me as I've seen games come out over the last few years.

[45:14] It always feels like there's just something missing, something we wish was different. There's just hasn't been that pin that's checked all the boxes.

[45:22] And you know, for Stern, this is moving them in a good direction. I think we have to say for a Stern pinball machine, this thing looks really nice.

[45:33] Will it have the quality issues and some of the other things that have impacted Sterns in the past. We don't know.

[45:41] Is Stern cheaping out on some of the things they should have put in this game like licensed music and an actor doing the call out? Absolutely. I think they're cheapening out on that. And I think they should go get that stuff tomorrow.

[45:54] Does this machine make me feel like people are not going to buy pirates of the Caribbean or Houdini or alien.

[46:04] Look, I think Stern getting guardians of the galaxy out in fourth quarter right before the holiday is a genius move.

[46:14] And I've said this before, it doesn't really matter about like code. It doesn't matter about quality. Stern will win on theme and they will win on theme alone.

[46:29] Every time people say that's not the case, they're still going to sell a few thousand of all these hot themes. There's a few thousand.

[46:38] And who wouldn't, what's more popular now? Pirates of the Caribbean or Guardians of the Galaxy? And yes, of course I wish that Jersey Jack made Guardians of the Galaxy.

[46:51] But Jack's biggest issue to date is he just can't get the right theme at the right time. They're putting all this innovation into the games and the theme is pirates.

[47:02] You know, just because in the rationale is like, well, pirates sold really well when we were at Stern. You know, it's like, well, yeah, but why would you really pursue a pirate's theme if it was so limited?

[47:14] And that's my big concern for all these hot themes coming out because seeing how little of the actual theme is being integrated into stuff like the LCD and into the callouts and into the music makes me really concerned because then I feel like I'm playing half of what the game could be.

[47:37] And it makes me want to go by Lord of the Rings again because I feel like that was like the last like just greatest integration of a theme into a pinball machine.

[47:47] And I don't know why they can't do it that good anymore. For the price of these machines, I don't want to turn on, you know, star wars and not hear any of the actors from the movie.

[48:01] I don't want to turn on guardians and not have any of the music or the callouts from the film I love.

[48:07] And it's just these games are too expensive to have the excuse, well, it's pinball, we can't afford all that stuff. Bullshit, you can afford it because remember, you're spreading that cost against like 2000 machines.

[48:20] You can afford to go get an actor from the movie to do your callouts. Bullshit, if there's none of that in there. Absolute Bullshit.

[48:29] You know, I think this is a bad time for Houdini to be coming out because you know, you've now trying to sell a game that's at the same price as a theme as popular as this.

[48:46] I still think Houdini looks great. I think it's got more innovation in it. It's got more innovative toys in it for sure.

[48:57] But again, it's like, it's so hard not to say the machine I want in my home is going to be an original theme versus a theme that's based on a movie I love.

[49:11] Whether or not the pinball community, you know, the older male demographic loves guardians or not is up for debate. I think they do.

[49:20] I do think it's a little bit of a polarizing film for some people because some people are just sick of Marvel movies.

[49:27] But I think the reason why people love guardians, it's so much better than all the Marvel shit that was coming out and it like reminded us how good a comic book movie could be.

[49:40] So look, exciting day. We got to see what it looks like finally. Now comes the painful part. Now comes the two to three weeks where people on the pin side will just tear this game apart.

[49:55] They'll find every little thing to complain about. The tournament guys will complain that they don't want to play this game because Groot's finger tips screwed them over because they couldn't see the exact millimeter at which the ball was exiting the world.

[50:09] I can already hear it now. I can hear people complaining about the fact that it's too close to Iron Man and Metallica and all this shit.

[50:21] I don't know. Part of me is like you might be right. You might be wrong. I would just give this advice. If you like the game and you like the theme and you see it flip and it's something you want to own, go buy it.

[50:35] If you see all that stuff and you don't want to own it, then don't go buy it. And those are the only two decisions we ever have to make in this silly hobby.

[50:47] Nobody's got to gunder ahead to make it by any of this stuff. But I do congratulate Stern and Christopher Franchi. I think they delivered a really nice game today.

[50:59] And I'd be happy to have one of those in my home. If the rest of what I see is as good as what I saw today, I will be buying this game because I love this theme. I love this movie.

[51:13] I know I say I'm always going in on everything. But I would be proud to own this game. If the rest of the game lives up to what we saw today.

[51:23] Without further ado, I'm going to let you guys go. I think I'm talking to Josh Kugler tomorrow night about American pinball and Houdini. We're excited to talk to him there.

[51:33] Everything is all settled with coin taker. All that stuff is wood or under the bridge. I had amazing conversations with Chris and Melissa.

[51:41] For those of you who emailed me and said I was a hypocrite and you're such a loser, canada. How could you put up that podcast and then retract it?

[51:49] Look, and I said to people, have you never experienced a fight with a friend of yours where you had a dispute and then you worked it out?

[51:57] And yeah, I'm sorry that happened across my podcast. But it's over with. And we forgive each other and we've moved on.

[52:06] And it's as far as I'm concerned, it's a non-issue anymore. And look, we've got guardians to complain about. We don't have to complain about my podcast.

[52:14] I mean, I don't even get paid for this thing. You don't have to listen to this. I don't make anybody listen to this podcast. I'm glad you do, but I don't.

[52:21] All right, have a great evening, everyone, and we'll talk to you real soon. And send me your feedback. I'll read your feedback on guardians out loud at canada pinballadjimmo.com. Peace.

[52:34] I'm hooked on a feeling and I'm high on the leaving. But you're in love with me. I said I'm hooked on a feeling and I'm high on the leaving.

[52:53] I said I'm hooked on a feeling and I'm high on the leaving.
