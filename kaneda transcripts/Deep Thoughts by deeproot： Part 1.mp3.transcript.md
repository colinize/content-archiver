[00:00] Chorea, Macau, Chorea, Macau.

[00:16] Just by doing things just simply and using my noggin, I could out, you know, market, out business, out manufacturer, out design, anyone else that's been in the industry ever.

[00:28] So this has been a great opportunity for me and everyone else who shares my vision is working hard every day behind the scenes here to go out there and prove that and shine.

[00:38] I'm not really interested in competing against any of the other pinball companies. I mean, they're pretty much irrelevant to what we plan on doing.

[00:48] I think it's going to be really hard for them to try to compete against someone who actually came into it, built from the ground up the right way, at the right time, and the right marketing message and the right design.

[00:58] And we're going to show all that here pretty, pretty shortly. And I think you're going to see a lot of this money that's burning hole in pockets, start to float a deeper.

[01:08] It's just because I think we've really focused on what people really want on pinball for so long behind the scenes that we've really gotten, you know, to the core nut of what makes pinball an amazing opportunity even a pinball spy for some people.

[01:27] People make pinball out to be a lot harder than it really is. Many people on my staff have extensive manufacturing experience. I'm a jack-of-all-trades.

[01:37] So I, you know, within a 10-minute period, can be talking about gold mining in Africa and then head on mechanical engineering issues and then go to electrical and programming.

[01:47] I mean, this is just, you know, how we deal with our day-to-day affairs here at Deeper. But we've had a lot of opportunity since we started to really think about how we wanted to do it.

[01:58] Like, you know, we're done with quite assembly. That's just too old for us. We're now going to opt to assembly.

[02:04] What we're trying to do is get to a point where we can share our story in a very open public way, and that's the five days at Deeper.

[02:15] You know, at the other day, people are going to have their opinions. And, but we know this is that they're going to be the first ones in line to buy a Deeper machine and we're very excited to sell it to them.

[02:25] I'm not going to be able to go back and change anything that J-pop did when neither is he.

[02:32] These have now become my games in many way. They're my personal passion to see these games through to fruition and to do what no other person or pinball company could ever do.

[02:43] And that is to get J-pop focused on what J-pop does best.

[02:48] I mean, even today, Dennis was in town and he was telling me how amazing, you know, it is here at Deeper compared to the Williams Valley days.

[02:58] Almost everything we're doing has never been done in the history of pinball.

[03:01] So that's why the five days at Deeper and I think people are going to either check themselves into it and say in the silent because they just can't take it.

[03:10] Or they're going to see the next century of pinball change and never look back.

[03:16] You know, I've always approached pinball very differently than the other companies.

[03:22] And I think this is going to be a very interesting period to see after we launch how the other companies react.

[03:30] Whether they follow suit or whether they're just trying to compete and lose essentially to, you know, our concept of design and sourcing and marketing.

[03:42] And the types of titles we have, the price variations and the feature variations.

[03:48] So it's really hard to kind of talk about that without, you know, going through the five days at Deeper and what we're going to do because there's definitely a competitive advantage there.

[03:59] Right? Why buy a machine from another company that doesn't have all those innovations that you can't? It's not a Deeper machine, right?

[04:06] I think that is probably going to be one of the biggest upfront marketing challenges that a lot of other companies are going to have to face.

[04:14] I have no intention of releasing something before it's ready to ship.

[04:19] I fully believe that pinball machines, a large amount of the sales are impulse buys.

[04:25] And I would love to fulfill that need to take pocket out of a, you know, take the money out of a pocket and give them a great product and return.

[04:35] And so our intent is when we launch a game and someone comes to buy it that they're going to have that game shipped in two weeks or less.

[04:44] And I've stood by that from the beginning and I'm going to continue to stand by that.

[04:49] And if they don't get it in two weeks, we're going to start giving them money for us not fulfilling the promise that we made.

[04:56] So two weeks is a reasonable amount of time for us to make a pinball machine for someone and to get it shipped out to them.

[05:03] And so I think it's a very doable thing on our end.
