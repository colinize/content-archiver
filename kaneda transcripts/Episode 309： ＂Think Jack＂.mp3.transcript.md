[00:00] Welcome to episode 309 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:16] It is Monday morning and it is the day after what is easily and was easily the worst Super

[00:24] Ball in NFL history. It is hard to even describe how bad that game was. We are going to talk

[00:30] a little bit about that because there was a Super Bowl commercial in the Super Bowl

[00:35] which we will talk about. We are going to talk a little bit about the pinball news going

[00:38] on in the world and just my overall assessment of some of the things I have been hearing

[00:42] because we are in that period now between now and TPS where it is a little bit of a downtime

[00:46] so we are going to have to be extra entertaining to keep your interest in this pinball podcast.

[00:52] So let us just talk about the game for a minute. In general this defensive battle if you

[00:59] will on one of the worst Super Bowl performances I have seen on both sides of the ball. The whole

[01:05] game just sucked from beginning to end. I was laughing because at halftime the score

[01:11] of the Super Bowl was maroon 5 Patriots 3 Rams 0. I mean just like sitting there waiting

[01:18] for some action to happen but you do not want to hear me talk about the whole game. I will

[01:21] say this though and then I will talk about the Super Pinball that. It was cool seeing the

[01:27] still I, our twa idea there on the big stage but I will say this about in general right.

[01:33] I think we live in an error now. Error where it is just like stuff is not entertaining anymore.

[01:40] It is so much stuff is being forced into this realm of political correctness and social

[01:49] good. Every spot has to be about like female empowerment or like Google spots where how

[01:56] blatantly clear is it where Google is trying to pander to both sides right the far left

[02:01] and the far right. So the far left spot was all about like translating languages all over

[02:07] the world where people are getting along everywhere and every language and every culture.

[02:12] So that is like your far left spot and then your far right spot is appealing towards

[02:18] military veterans. I do not know working in marketing I sort of see through it all that

[02:23] all this stuff is just created. It is all manufactured. It is all arbitrary. Like do you really

[02:31] believe that Amazon Alexa is like a good thing. It is spying on all of us. It is terrifying.

[02:37] I actually talked to a lawyer who deals in AI law and they have permission to listen in

[02:43] on everything going on if you have one of those in your home. I was like well I did not

[02:47] know that. Yep. Anyway but let us talk about not the boring game. Let us not talk about

[02:52] the boring maroon 5 performance. Let us talk about the super ad which I think I said on

[02:59] a previous podcast that you would never see Pimball in marketing because it is so niche.

[03:04] And there we have it. The new Toyota Supra firing out of a shooter lane into a Pimball

[03:12] machine where the car is drifting around pop bumpers and targets and it is like drifting

[03:19] over the letters to spell the word Supra. There was no wizard mode. There were no ramps.

[03:27] I think I did see a little bit of a chipping on the play field and there was definitely

[03:32] a mechanism in that game that looked like they had someone with some good Pimball skill

[03:38] designing it. No. So what do I think of that spot? First and foremost I am a car enthusiast.

[03:45] So if you are a car enthusiast you have already realized that this new Toyota Supra is just

[03:53] a BMW wearing a different clothes. This car was designed by BMW. The BMW engine you are

[04:00] not happy about it. This is not the iconic return of the Toyota Supra. This is just a

[04:05] BMW Z4 that was given to Toyota to make a little adjustments to. So there is that which

[04:12] you don't care about if you don't like cars. The spot itself was alright. You know all

[04:16] things considered. I thought that a spot like that that is just trying to show me an exciting

[04:22] car doing what it is supposed to do without any greater good happening. I thought it was

[04:27] really neat. The Pimball wizard song from the Who plan really cool. It was definitely

[04:33] one of the neatest spots. I mean people in the room seem to enjoy it. My favorite spot

[04:37] of the night was the planter spot with Charlie Sheen. I thought that was really funny.

[04:41] I think Super Bowl you know it should be about like 30 seconds of making you laugh out

[04:45] loud. I didn't see like much of any of that. I even thought like the Bud Light Game of Thrones

[04:50] ad that I knew was happening. But then when I saw it I kind of felt like it felt flat.

[04:54] I didn't realize if it was a Bud Light spot or a spot for the new Game of Thrones series

[05:00] or which one was it supposed to be. It was kind of confusing that the Bud Night you know

[05:04] he is dead now. I think they're moving on from that. But overall overall I have to say

[05:09] it was about like three and a half hours of my life that I wish I could get back. The

[05:14] only thing I regret is I was going to bet on the Patriots. I was going to bet like a decent

[05:19] amount of money. But can you imagine having money riding on that game last night and having

[05:24] to suffer through it and have money on the line. It would have been even worse. It wouldn't

[05:28] have been worth it. I don't think. So anyway let's let's move on from the Super Bowl

[05:33] Super Bowl conversation because again it was just so bad. I want to talk about Jersey

[05:39] Jack. And I want to talk about Jersey Jack is now going around and whenever he's interviewed

[05:46] he keeps on saying the same thing. And I want to discuss this. He keeps on saying that

[05:51] two games are going to be revealed in 2019. Now notice he says the words revealed. He

[05:57] doesn't say two games will ship. And if you don't think that's a huge difference you

[06:03] haven't been following the Jersey Jack saga over the years. I call it a saga because

[06:10] Jersey Jack has always been a sort of a strange company for me to figure out. I think they're

[06:15] always trying to make a great pinball machine. And I think they are always almost right on

[06:21] it in terms of creating a hit. But we know that if there's one thing that most people have

[06:26] experienced with Jersey Jack it's that he reveals a game and then he ships it. God knows

[06:32] when sometimes the game that was actually revealed and shipped the quickest was dialed in.

[06:39] And I think even then I want to say there was about a six month pause between reveal at

[06:45] T. P. F. and games actually making it out the door later in the summer. But that was that's

[06:51] the best they've done. So if you think about it the best Jersey Jack pinball has ever done

[06:57] in terms of revealing a machine and then getting it on the line, getting it built and getting

[07:02] it to customers has been about six months time. We all know that pirates of the Caribbean

[07:09] the last penny release one year later. Okay. So if we follow history if we follow what

[07:17] they've done in the past, if he's going to reveal two games this year that most likely

[07:23] means that only one will ship. Okay. So what is so then why would you reveal to and I guess

[07:33] the question we always have on this show and this is the one thing I don't understand

[07:37] with Jersey Jack. Why can't you look at how stern does it you reveal a machine and you

[07:45] ship it to customers within a couple months of the reveal because we all know that people's

[07:53] interest wanes over time and you're not going to create the same sort of hype and must buy

[08:00] as you do with stern. Okay. Gotta get that money locked in and we talk a lot about how

[08:05] pirates of the Caribbean. If it had shipped closer to expo in 2017, the sales probably

[08:11] would have been twice as good. I think there's no denying that if you look at the excitement.

[08:15] All right. But here's the other thing that I don't get about Jack and and I look I've met

[08:19] Jack. I think Jack is a good guy and I think Jack has a role within that company. But the

[08:26] role within that company is not marketing. The role within that company is not communications.

[08:31] And here's why I think it's completely a name that Jack is going around and saying we're

[08:37] going to reveal two new games this year. Now that's explain why they need to sell pirates

[08:42] of the Caribbean right now and Jack always does this. He cuts the legs off of the game that's

[08:48] available now and he gets you waiting for the next game or he reveals the next game and so

[08:54] then you just wait for it and you don't buy the one that's currently available on the line.

[08:59] The only game Jack can make money on the only game he can really make your money on is the

[09:05] game that is on the line today and I don't understand. I want to just drive over there today or

[09:12] tomorrow it's going to be a nice nice day weather wise. I could get the demon there pretty quickly.

[09:16] Why would you start going around instead of hyping pirates of the Caribbean. That is the only

[09:23] thing he should be talking about right now. Jersey Jack's communication strategy in February of 2019

[09:32] should be pirates pirates pirates. He should have a list of key messages when he talks about like

[09:39] here's why I'm here. We delayed this game. We took longer than we wanted to but I'm going to

[09:45] tell you why and if you read people who open up the game and play it they're telling they're

[09:49] telling you why as well. We have made this game so much better than when we revealed it at

[09:55] Expo 2017. We know it took a year but you are never going to see a game out of box with code

[10:02] this deep with the play experience this good and we're just asking you one thing give it a try.

[10:07] If you give this game a try and you think it's not for you you know we'll give you you know your

[10:12] money back or something I don't know whatever. It doesn't have to do some sort of like Honda

[10:16] assurance on it but you know what I'm saying he should be touring this game and really promoting it

[10:22] instead he's saying we're going to reveal two new games and what does that do what does that do

[10:28] if you're a pinball enthusiast a pinball fan it makes you stop and say well if that's the case

[10:34] then I might as well just wait because there's no reason to rush and get a pirate to the Caribbean

[10:38] because they're going to make a thousand L.E.s and we all know Jack is going to make another L.E.

[10:43] version so I'll just wait and then he's telling me well the next game is from Pat Lawler this is

[10:47] what he's telling people right now the next game is from Pat Lawler well fuck then I'm definitely

[10:52] going to wait because I think a Pat has learned his lesson with dialed in so he's going to come out

[10:56] of the gates with a licensed theme game which we I think is know his toy story and so why would I go

[11:03] buy pirates the Caribbean I know that the rumored pins are guns and roses wonka and toy story three

[11:09] titles of which people would rather own and pirates he jacks problem now is he's once again creating

[11:16] an environment in which he's destroying his sales he's destroying his ability to be profitable

[11:22] because here is what is we all know is going to happen he's going to probably if he reveals something

[11:27] at tpf do you really think that games going to ship anytime before like august so then what happens is

[11:33] this the game's not ready to ship the games not on the line they have not tooled up for the new game

[11:39] they reveal it to get excitement back into the company but then where there's no excitement

[11:44] is for pirates of the Caribbean it is now the red headed stepchild of his lineup it once he once

[11:50] again destroys the sales of the game that's available he did the same thing to a game called dialed

[11:56] in do you remember what happened dialed in became the most award winning game at the twippies last

[12:04] time around there's a reason why dialed in got so much accolades but here's the problem is

[12:11] right when dialed in i think was starting to sort of gain some momentum jack drops pirates of

[12:17] the Caribbean on everybody and all the momentum shifts towards that game and then he could never

[12:22] shift it back to dialed in and say what you will yeah there probably are some just glaring problems

[12:28] with dialed in mainly the theme mainly the call out and that's stupid sim card shot that nobody

[12:34] can hit that's like the dirty little Achilles heel of that game if you listen to people talk about

[12:40] dialed in the most frustrating thing is there's a shot in the game that you have to hit that you

[12:46] can hit with with skill that 90% of the time it takes a random like ricochet get into that sim card

[12:53] shot and and I think that was a huge mistake and then you had all the issues with like the cliffies

[12:59] and whatnot and whatever and the theme and the artwork and the guy wearing like mom jeans they

[13:04] you could go down a laundry list of I think everything that went wrong with dialed in still

[13:10] of a really great pinball experience but the desire to own it is not there and I think a lot of

[13:16] you feel the same way so are we going to see jack in 2019 completely fumbled this again and how

[13:23] many chances does he get to understand how very easy it is to market launch and sell and make profit

[13:30] in pinball he should be at the point now where he's got this shit no pun intended dialed in as a

[13:36] company as a leader he needs to figure out how to get this thing together it's not hard I've never

[13:42] seen an industry where it really is pretty simple to follow the leader how hard is it to follow what

[13:48] stern does jack's got everything he needs to be successful the only thing he doesn't have is

[13:56] common sense when it comes to how he markets and reveals these games it's common sensical it's

[14:02] common sensical see what what we don't know and this is the part that always makes it difficult

[14:08] to understand what's really going on behind the scenes at at Jersey check pinball the reason I heard

[14:15] he showed pirates so early on wasn't because he wanted to do that it's because his billionaire

[14:21] investor was getting tired and jack had to show him that there was going to be interest in the next

[14:27] title because he was getting ready to pull the plug now I don't know this for sure someone should

[14:33] interview that billionaire investor get him on the show this guy really is the one who's calling

[14:38] the shots over there you really think jack is calling the shot I mean I don't even think jack

[14:42] is calling the shots he seems to be more like a salesman like a car salesman versus like someone

[14:48] who's really making the business decisions over there at Jersey jack but if I could implore jack

[14:53] to do one thing it would be to not go down this road in 2019 it's it's not you know the selfish

[15:01] pinball fan who just wants to see everything new yeah that's exciting but do you want to see

[15:05] Jersey jack succeed or fail they will fail if they do another round of this crap where they make

[15:13] you wait six months a year to get the game out it there's there's just no there's just no way

[15:18] you can survive in this pinball over saturated marketplace with that kind of strategy all right all

[15:24] right well let's see what happens we know that they're fucking up if they come to tpf and reveal a

[15:31] game and then when you ask what when is it going to ship if he doesn't say there it's on the line now

[15:37] right it's on the line now then we know then we know that we're in we're in for another fucking ride

[15:46] when does Stern reveal the monsters when when it's already on a boat heading to Europe already on the

[15:53] line they they they literally do not like I said it they do not pull this shit and I think jack's

[16:00] going to pull this shit again and I don't tell you people I just think he's he's killing his own

[16:06] company nobody is killing Jersey jack pinball but the decisions that that company makes itself and

[16:12] so he's telling people that it's a pat law their game and then an error game next so that sounds

[16:16] like toy story and then wonka I don't know I also think I don't I don't know I don't know who's

[16:22] who's lead design I these it flips flops back and forth I heard Eric was on wonka so and we know Pat

[16:29] was working on toy story for sure all right so what else is going on in pinball there's a dead pool

[16:34] topper that's out cool awesome thank you why does it take so long to get these toppers out what

[16:40] I said it before Stern needs a topper division you why why when did Deadpool come out can someone

[16:46] remind me Deadpool July August right okay isn't that right came out before like yeah so let's see

[16:54] so Deadpool comes out in the summer and the topper comes out six months later tell me how that

[17:00] makes sense a little piece of plastic that just gets thrown on top you think they would want these

[17:06] accessories available during the game launches so that people could buy them when they're the most

[17:13] excited to own the games but nope that's not the case all right anything else going on in the pinball

[17:19] world so another thing that I've been reading a lot about is Chicago gaming company and we don't

[17:26] hear too much about Chicago gaming company because they're making remakes and we all got excited when

[17:33] we saw monster bash remake but there's one thing that keeps following this company around a little

[17:39] bit like a dark cloud and if you go into the thread you can read the story and I'm gonna try and

[17:45] paraphrase the best I can on this show but the one thing that keeps becoming the big question mark

[17:50] with this company is quality so what is the quality of these games how good are these remakes

[17:59] and we know they're sexy looking we know they've got that beautiful display which I think is the

[18:04] perfect all you need display for pinball by the way if you listen to my last master episode don't

[18:11] worry don't don't not listen to it because you think it's gonna be a slow voice like Snoke from

[18:16] Star Wars it's not it's just me talking and reading what my master said and I think he was 100%

[18:22] spot on and I think the displays in pinball have sort of destroyed with a magic on the play field

[18:30] and if you look at Chicago gaming I think what they've done is the absolute all you need to ever do

[18:37] to have an awesome display make pinball look more new in modern but still maintain like the reality

[18:44] of what this is it's it's a game where you're looking down 95% of the time and there's too much

[18:51] going on on these modern screens where you never even have a chance to look up so anyway so at

[18:57] Chicago gaming we know they've got that we know they've you know improve some things here and there

[19:02] but there's also just quality issues that are that are head scratching whether it's play field

[19:07] wear issues where they have to put decals over areas of the play field that people are concerned about

[19:13] whether it's not having the right kind of protectors for certain areas of the of the play field

[19:18] and now the new thing I'm seeing is that the cabinets are actually splitting on some of the games

[19:24] and there's like a a seam or a crease that starts to develop on the game on on sort of like the

[19:31] right and left side of the cabinets and you can kind of see it through the decal and and people

[19:37] are sharing that as well now some people's games are opening up like that new in box others are

[19:41] developing after they own the game but that seems to be the latest sort of a little bit of a headache

[19:47] for Chicago gaming company is whenever something that happens with the cabinet it's never an easy fix

[19:55] maybe they'll send out new decals so we're just sort of monitoring this to see how it goes

[20:00] for the most part I think people are enjoying their monster bash remakes the LEDs have been

[20:06] really slow in getting out the door I think they're another company that you know manufacturing

[20:13] just seems to always be the problem and you know they wanted to reveal that game at tpf 2018

[20:21] and look how long it took them to actually get people their games I mean for the most part

[20:26] their their plans are almost a year off from what they intended them to be okay so another example

[20:34] of how making pinball is not easy and speaking of making pinball is not easy

[20:39] deep root when when will it happen there is a there is growing expectation for this company that

[20:50] does the do the expectations of deep root increase or decrease with each month it's almost like

[20:56] we're moving towards a target we don't quite know what it is we don't quite know what the destination

[21:02] we've heard a lot of promises well we know for a fact something's not going to happen

[21:06] when robert said we're going to ship more games than any manufacturers ever shipped in 2019 we

[21:11] can almost guarantee that that will not be the case there there's just no way they will ship more

[21:18] games than stern does in a year and so I think they're going to sort of start dialing down a lot

[21:25] of that rhetoric and hyperbole it just makes no sense we know that the there's only one date

[21:32] that they for sure supposedly have to hit from a legal standpoint and that is the the June date in

[21:40] which I don't know the exact date in June in which they must deliver a product to the zidware

[21:47] customers that agreed to not sue and become part of the new sort of jump op a dogue zidware sort

[21:57] of deep root product that was I don't even know if I just made sense there okay let me go back

[22:02] and try to say that in english you signed a contract that said we will deliver you a game you got

[22:08] like 50 cents to the dollar so if you got if you had a magic girl they were going to give you

[22:12] you know 50 cents to the dollar on on a new deep root game or you would be delivered a deep

[22:17] root version of magic girl and you get like deep root credits so that's what that deal was now

[22:24] and I think like half the magic girls did where people didn't even take the deal but those who did

[22:29] are contractually obligated to get those games now I don't know what happens if they don't

[22:35] live up to their end of the bargain like so then what do those people do I mean think about it they

[22:39] they really have no power and no leverage it's not like if deeper doesn't deliver by that June

[22:44] date these guys are going to get together and what class action lawsuit spend more money no I

[22:50] I I think what that date was meant to do was give these gentlemen confidence and that they should

[22:59] feel credible about deep roots plans and it's not just a joke because they put a date in writing

[23:04] but we all know in the world of pinball the greatest way to sort of miss a deadline is to create a

[23:11] deadline and that happens all the time with with all the other manufacturers out there we're going to

[23:16] this is going to ship in two weeks in two weeks you know speaking of deadlines I think I'm back on

[23:22] on Facebook and Christopher Franchie's podcast he's going to kill me for saying this his podcast I

[23:28] think they announced it would be out in two weeks I think some time I want to say like June or July

[23:34] of of 2018 so it's like they've missed it by just you know just about like half a year but we'll

[23:40] get there it I know it's coming out soon and speaking of mr. Franchie our our are

[23:46] sincerest like condolences to the shittiest thing that happened the water pipe above his office

[23:52] broke open and just flooded his office I mean I don't know if you saw the photos but it's sucked it

[23:57] was like devastating and it took out his Beatles machine just it sucks and we always hate to see

[24:06] anyone who goes through some sort of like disaster within their home or their other game room

[24:11] where game is like destroyed so Chris we are really sorry that that happened that that completely

[24:16] sucks so hopefully you know Stern and we'll get you a new one I think I think I saw you and George

[24:22] going back and forth so it looks like everything's replaceable I mean that's the other thing too

[24:25] is whenever anything happens whether you know your your warehouse burns down or you this or that or

[24:31] as long as you're you're okay that's that's the most important thing all right what else is going

[24:36] on in Pimball anything Alice Cooper nightmare castles I don't know where they are I've been seeing

[24:41] them I'm actually going down this week in Pimball have you guys donated yet to this week in Pimball

[24:46] the Twippies are up but you still should support Jeff great Lakes Pimball who great Lakes Pimball

[24:53] this is a new Pimball startup company that is creating their first title called X-Po-Ze

[24:59] and they hired artists Tom Dijia as they announced this on Facebook all right I don't really know

[25:07] who great Lakes Pimball is and I again they so here's here's a thing I don't know who these guys

[25:14] are they're making a Pimball game they've released a teaser image they've even already told you the

[25:19] name of the game X-Po-Ze and I here's here's my take why why are we getting another Pimball company

[25:31] that clearly just doesn't know how to do this and and by that I mean and this is why I'm sorry

[25:38] but I'm just out of patience I'm out of patience with all these boutique startup Pimball companies

[25:43] and their inability to remain secret until they actually have something that's worth showing

[25:49] there's absolutely no point in saying hey we're here we're a new Pimball company and we have

[25:55] nothing to show you and we're working hard behind the scenes and why it's like it's like it's like

[26:01] these people need some sort of early attention what does that get you so is so when you walk around

[26:09] shows people all those are the guys from Suncoast Pimball and those are the guys working on X-Po-Ze

[26:14] and do you want your company to be successful or you're just doing it for shits and giggles

[26:20] and when you do stuff like this I kind of feel like they're just doing it for the fun of doing it

[26:25] and that and that may be fine that may be fine but if you want to actually make a Pimball company

[26:31] that makes money that is successful in getting a product to market we've we've all seen that this

[26:38] is the approach you don't take which is you just reveal yourself to the world before you're ready

[26:42] there's there's just no point I there there you know the saturation of this market

[26:50] and how much more difficult it is to get a game off the ground now is harder than ever before

[26:56] and I think that error of where you know we're just a bunch of good guys making a Pimball machine

[27:00] and we're just doing it for fun I would assume that most people who have the time to actually

[27:06] started Pimball company this will then become your full-time job and I want you to succeed

[27:12] do not get me wrong I am not here tearing down suncoast Pimball but you've made mistake number one

[27:19] which is you've revealed yourself to the world why there there's just no need to do it you got

[27:24] to wait until you have something to show at least don't give the game title what does that do what

[27:30] what you're it's like why start teasing something that's not finished you start teasing something

[27:36] that's done then you go into your tea strategy because then you work back from a launch date

[27:42] it's just so simple but yet it's so hard for some people to figure out all right all right

[27:48] anything else going on in Pimball that we should talk about um let me see I'm I'm on Pinside

[27:56] right now and I'm not saying anything completely new or like out of the ordinary anything new at

[28:01] Stern we're getting the same rumors over and over again about Tron vault edition it's the same

[28:08] rumor every year if I guess the question is if they do vault Tron what do you want to see I would

[28:15] love to see Christopher French you do the original Tron art package on it I think that would look

[28:19] really cool I would like to see it come with a color DMD it isn't color DMD a thing now for Tron

[28:28] yes I think someone made one so what can Stern like work with the color DMD company and just install

[28:33] it in every game from day one that would be cool I don't think it needs like a full new LCD I think

[28:39] new artwork on that game would go a huge way also the other thing would be really cool other than

[28:46] the you know the fiber optic ramps which I think will be on it but imagine if Stern actually went

[28:51] to all the people who made great mods for that game and imagine if they just installed those mods

[28:57] into the vault edition and and then released it to us they they probably won't do that that's not

[29:04] Stern's style they don't need to do that because if they reveal you know Tron vault edition they

[29:10] know they've got probably a sales killer because people have been waiting for this title for a long

[29:14] time so we'll see I I've sort of I don't really you know the Stern vault approach it's anyone's

[29:22] guess you know I'll say this though too it's sometimes when it happens it's a blessing and occur

[29:28] sometimes it completely ruins an excitement around a title that existed before but no longer

[29:35] exists because it was vaulted I look at ACDC Lucy like that me Lucy used to be this rare version

[29:43] of ACDC because it was a premium they didn't make that many of them and owning a Lucy was something

[29:48] very special and you have this special little community of Lucy owners who pride at themselves

[29:53] on having one and then once they vaulted it overnight it was like now now that game has no

[29:59] prominence then no one really cares you you just have the owner if you want to have fun with it

[30:05] yeah you know sometimes there's there's when when Stern completely destroys the collectibility

[30:12] of one of their collectibles is it fun like Tron Ellie right now for a lot of people is that game

[30:19] but if they release Tron vault with nicer art and some improvements and the fiber optic ramps and

[30:24] put the daft punk multi-ball in it your Tron Ellie is are gonna be worse shit and and that's just

[30:31] and you know I think we see from history I don't think Stern cares they're all about you know

[30:37] they're not about giving you the collectible they're giving about giving you the best pinball

[30:41] experience on the planet and they don't they could care less about the collectibility side of the

[30:46] hobby even though they like continue to take money from the collectors because they know no

[30:51] one else is satiating them I can see Ed Robertson being like you finally understand canator you

[30:55] finally get it I'm actually saying that in a way that like I don't know I think the collectors

[31:02] have sort of been hoodwinked by a lot of of what's been going on over at Stern because I don't

[31:07] think these L.E.s are are really collectible I they would like us to believe that but I don't think

[31:13] that's the case so I want to play the monsters really badly I think that's one game that is

[31:19] shipping right now and I need to go find who has it in New York City and jump on one because

[31:26] it's going to be it's going to be just fun to flip it I've heard so much back and forth on this game

[31:32] and I think here's where I think the monsters is going to net out and and I think the monsters is

[31:37] going to net out as being one of the visually most beautiful games Stern has released I do think

[31:43] the monsters theme I've always said this is a little niche and I think that nicheness will wear thin

[31:48] on people quickly who are not really fans of the show I think if you're a big fan of the show

[31:53] I think this game is going to be one that you enjoy and I think if you're not the best pinball player

[31:59] if you're not you know super skilled if you're not the kind of guy that puts up a billion points

[32:04] every time you flip you know I see these guys being like well if I don't when they play Batman

[32:09] and they're like well if I don't get freeze and then bookworm on ball one then I restart the

[32:14] game and I'm thinking to myself what I like never if I do that it's like once a month or you know

[32:22] I'd that and I feel a sense of accomplishment because I can do that but these guys who who can

[32:27] who can like jail eight minor villains in one game I feel like pinball must not be as you don't

[32:34] you don't get such an ascent of accomplishment when you play pinball like that and you're just so

[32:40] so you're so fixated on a high score my whole point is like so what when you're playing in your home

[32:46] I don't care at all about high scores I just want to get to fun modes and I think what people have

[32:50] been saying in monsters is people have been slamming Dwight and saying he doesn't care he only

[32:55] works nine to five and this all bullshit like you don't know what Dwight does when he comes to

[33:01] working on a pinball machine I heard these guys were working around the clock to get this code to

[33:05] where it was the fact that's during release monsters with point nine oh code is is is good would you

[33:11] want to go back to like Batman point six five and for those of you thinking it's going to be a

[33:15] lineman sheets game it's not it never will be if you compare them to lineman sheets you're going to

[33:20] be disappointed but I also am hearing there is a lot of depth in the game that people don't quite

[33:25] know about yet and haven't been to yet and there's different levels of different multi balls and

[33:30] wizard modes and all that shit and maybe maybe you should just play it and maybe yeah maybe if

[33:36] you're an expert player the game is too easy for you doesn't have enough depth but if you're like

[33:41] one of these pinball wizards and you are like I put up four five billion points then yeah you're

[33:46] relegate it to only buying a pinball machine from Keith or lineman sheets like that's you're sorry

[33:53] but maybe the other games are just never going to have the level of depth for you but also if I'm

[33:58] stirring and I'm coding games I don't give a shit if the one percent of guys that are pinball wizards

[34:04] are unhappy I'm here to make a game that's satisfying to the majority of my buyer base and the

[34:10] majority of Stern's buyer base can't get to the deep wizard modes and can't you know put up a

[34:18] billion points they made this game a little bit easier guess why they made it a little bit easier

[34:23] so people could have fucking fun with it and maybe once in a while we could get a machine where

[34:29] people who buy Stern games actually feel like they're accomplishing something in the game and if you

[34:35] if that's too easy for you so what but I'll say this I bet 90% of people who buy Stern pinball

[34:40] machines are like me are like frolic are like ice man like we enjoy our games in every once in a

[34:47] blue moon we put up a billion score game we don't do it every time and for you freaks of nature

[34:53] who put up like 200 billion points on Batman or whatever like 80 billion you you're you're just

[35:00] nothing will ever satisfy you and a company should never make a game for you because if they did

[35:07] nobody else would be happy and so I think monsters has been unfairly sort of slammed by people

[35:15] who haven't even played it yet and and go play it and if it is easier if it is easier okay like

[35:24] I'm fine with that because here's what's here's the thing about Stern and here's the thing

[35:29] if you want a game that's got more depth that's got better theme you could go buy a Batman premium

[35:34] tomorrow and have one alive and cheats is great this game and you can buy a brand new and new

[35:38] in box well why wouldn't you just go do that if that's if that's what you're looking for

[35:43] sometimes we forget and we judge Stern as if they're only making one game go to sternpimball.com

[35:50] and look at games for sale it's fucking embarrassing to everybody else how little they offer

[35:56] when Stern will get you a new game in box based upon all these themes at once so you don't

[36:02] like that what about this you don't like this what about that that I mean it literally you got to

[36:08] stop looking at Stern games in a vacuum this company does not not exist in a vacuum they don't

[36:13] create a portfolio of products in a vacuum it's it's like going to a restaurant and and and thinking

[36:20] the only thing on the menu is going to be steak but they're like we have seafood we have this we

[36:24] have vegetables oh but but this steak this steak just doesn't give me the same flavor as the lobster

[36:30] I was looking for well but we also offer lobster over here no no no I'm gonna focus on this steak

[36:37] and that's how it is with the monsters I'm only gonna look at this game and I'm gonna completely

[36:41] criticize this game 100% in a vacuum and I think Stern released monsters to be a little bit more

[36:49] of a simple fun game to go alongside another game that is also simple and easy to understand and

[36:54] is a lot of fun to play and that is monster bash and if you don't think this is like a response

[36:59] to monster bash it is a little bit and that's okay because monster bash is also considered to be

[37:04] one of the most fun and best games ever by a lot more people than the than the naysayers so that's

[37:11] and that's always going to be that is always going to be the great divide in this hobby

[37:16] that is the tournament player versus the collector home buyer then they're not always the same

[37:24] the majority of people who buy these games are not tournament players do not let the 10 to 20 like

[37:32] tournament freaks of pinball nature people on pin side destroy your ability to walk up to a game

[37:41] and make your own opinion about it okay that's all I'm gonna say because I've been to the tournaments

[37:46] man I'll tell you what's not fun I'll tell you I'm like look it's it's not fun when I go to see

[37:51] these guys on league night and tournaments slapping the machines throwing them around cursing throwing

[37:57] hissy fits like they're so they're so like invested in and they get so mad and like and then it doesn't

[38:03] look like fun to me and then at the end of it all after all these hours of doing all this they like

[38:09] hold up 40 bucks and are like look at what I want I mean part of me was tempted I'm not going to do it

[38:16] the first place winner at the New York City pinball tournament gets $1,500

[38:19] canada was gonna offer $1,500 the last place finisher I thought that would have been funny

[38:25] but I'm not doing it I hope they have a great tournament I will not be there don't worry

[38:29] but anyway this is episode 309 of canada's pinball podcast we will be back soon there's not

[38:37] going to be as much news who will get some interesting people to talk to I've got a guest that I want

[38:42] to come on who has nothing to do with pinball but she would be great it my financial advisor I want

[38:48] to talk to her about when you should think about buying pinball machines and how it should fall

[38:52] into your financial portfolio right no one's ever had that conversation but I know for you out there

[38:57] don't you have that conversation with your financial advisors if if you don't have a financial advisor

[39:02] everybody should but if you do don't they want to know because you list it's funny when when I look

[39:07] at my financial assets on there our pinball machine assets and arcade games kind of funny to see

[39:13] that on on the spreadsheet next to a dodge demon and like 401k and stock and all that shit

[39:19] anyway everyone have a great Monday hopefully you're getting over the food coma from the super

[39:23] ball and we'll be back real soon
