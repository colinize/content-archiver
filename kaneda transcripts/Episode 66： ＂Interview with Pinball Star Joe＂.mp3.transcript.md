[00:05] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪

[00:11] It's episode 66 of the world's most popular pinball podcast

[00:17] as measured by Canadian's measurement team of analysts.

[00:22] This is a great episode. I've been wanting to have a distributor

[00:25] on the podcast for a really long time.

[00:28] And I was able to get Joe from pinball star to talk about what it's like to be a distributor,

[00:33] about dial-in, about an amazing thing he does with children's hospitals.

[00:38] This is our longest interview, but it's also one of our best.

[00:41] I know you're going to enjoy it. I know you're probably sick of hearing

[00:44] Canadian talk to himself for the past week and a half.

[00:47] So without further ado, I want to air this great interview with Joe from pinball star.

[00:52] Enjoy it, everyone.

[00:53] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian's pinball podcast.

[00:57] Our first legitimate distributor to the show Joe Newhart

[01:04] from pinball star amusements. Joe, welcome to the podcast.

[01:08] Hey, thanks for having us. Glad to be on and looking forward to talking pinball with you tonight.

[01:15] Yeah, and Joe, you know, I just got back from Expo and coming out of this year's Expo,

[01:21] I said to myself, you know, it'd be so great to finally get a distributor on to talk about

[01:27] the hobby, where it's going, some of the titles we saw at Expo.

[01:31] Let me first just start out by asking Joe, were you at Expo this year?

[01:35] Yes, yeah, I was there.

[01:37] And what were your thoughts?

[01:38] I mean, there's a lot of buildup for the Expo 2016.

[01:41] I know you were really excited to be standing next to dial-in.

[01:45] We're going to talk a lot about that pin on this podcast, but what were your overall thoughts

[01:49] of the show coming out of it with the expectations we all had going into it?

[01:54] Well, you know, Expo for me is two things.

[01:57] Obviously, as a distributor, I do and attend a lot of shows.

[02:01] You know, not just on the East Coast where I'm located, but you know, I do tend to travel

[02:05] even as an attendee and go to other shows.

[02:08] And the neat thing about Expo and what sets it apart from other shows is really the people

[02:15] because you're in Chicago, you're in the hub, you know, you could be in the elevator

[02:20] with Steve Richie and chat up with them a little bit about the next game he's doing.

[02:24] Obviously, it was exciting with the reveal of dialed in to have Pat Lawler there and be

[02:31] able to chat with Pat a little bit.

[02:34] And then obviously, you get to see people, you know, whether you know them from Pinside

[02:38] or whether for me, they're a customer that are across the country.

[02:43] You know, let's face it, if I do the Allentown show, the York show and the replay effects

[02:48] show in Pittsburgh and, you know, we're going to get people from, you know, Iowa, West

[02:53] Virginia, Virginia, New Jersey and the surrounding states, you know, as far as people are going

[02:58] to travel for a local show.

[03:00] But when you do go to Expo, you know, you're going to get people from California, Texas,

[03:04] and all over the place that, you know, you associate with during the course of the year.

[03:09] So for me, that's the exciting part of Expo, but I'm sure what you're asking about are

[03:14] the games.

[03:15] And yes, you know, this year was obviously a blockbuster for that with everybody getting

[03:20] to see, you know, the reveal dialed in game from Jersey Jack, getting a chance to see the

[03:25] Batman 66 game.

[03:28] Aliens was, you know, revealed and released as well.

[03:33] At neat little surprise for me, I'm a distributor for Charlie at Spooky Pinball.

[03:38] And I got to play and enjoy the Domino's game, which, you know, isn't necessarily, you

[03:45] know, a spooky game per se, but more of a contract job that they're doing, you know, they are

[03:50] for sale to the public.

[03:52] And I really enjoyed that.

[03:54] So there were even some surprises.

[03:55] And then you get the guys that are there doing their p-rock thing.

[03:59] You know, Eric was there with his Iron Man and you get to see, you know, some of the

[04:04] other new games that are just starting to ship Coin Takeer was there with the Bigelbowski

[04:09] and they had Don's Friday Pinball 2.0 there.

[04:14] So there's just always so much great stuff to see.

[04:16] And you're going to see things that you don't see at other shows at Expo.

[04:19] So yeah, I was excited.

[04:21] And, you know, the show went very well for me.

[04:24] I had a great time and probably one of the most memorable expos, you know, for me in

[04:28] a while just because of just how much that was going on.

[04:31] Your head had to be on a swivel the whole time.

[04:33] Right.

[04:34] And I want to talk a lot about a dialed in, right?

[04:37] And we're going to get to that in a little bit.

[04:38] But first, just for our listeners of the show, you're a distributor full time, right, Joe?

[04:44] Yes.

[04:45] I mean, I do have another job, but yet this is a hobby business and, you know, I do this

[04:53] along with, you know, my regular job, which I want an insurance agency.

[04:58] Okay.

[04:59] But the nice thing with that is I basically sit at a desk all day in front of a computer.

[05:04] And I concurrently perform both jobs, but, you know, it's funny.

[05:09] Jack's joke to me, Jack Winariat Jersey Jack is joke to me over the years that, you know,

[05:16] the pinball, the stuff that you're passionate about tends to end up, you know, taking more

[05:21] of your time.

[05:22] And I'd be lying if I haven't said that I obviously enjoy, you know, the pinball business that

[05:27] I have, you know, much more than selling and insurance customers.

[05:34] And it has taken over a good amount of my time.

[05:38] So and I do it nights and weekends.

[05:40] I'm always available for customers and, you know, in pinball people are emailing and I'm

[05:45] getting phone calls on Saturdays and Sunday.

[05:47] So, you know, to me, that's more of a, you know, seven day a week thing.

[05:52] And I don't mind it a bit, you know, I have about a 20 minute commute to my office.

[05:57] And typically I always use that time back and forth to return, you know, phone calls.

[06:03] And then obviously handle phone calls and emails turned the course of the day and I tend

[06:07] to be pretty responsive just because again, I'm sitting in front, you know, fortunately

[06:12] in front of a computer all day and a phone.

[06:14] So I can, and you're not the only one.

[06:18] If you look at Pinside, how active it is during the work day, I'm always like, does anyone

[06:24] even work with the amount of conversation that goes on during the work day?

[06:30] So what, what, and we're going to get to all the new stuff.

[06:33] But when did you decide to get into pinball distribution?

[06:37] What year, just so we can get a sense of like how long you've been doing this and sort

[06:41] of like your, how wide your lens goes on this hobby?

[06:46] Well, I, you know, I'll back up just a slight bit.

[06:49] I've been a hobby for about 15 years and my collection in terms of the circles in which

[06:59] I run from a hobbyist standpoint and a collector standpoint.

[07:04] I have both pinball machines and what you would call vintage arcade machines, which would

[07:12] encompass pitch and bat baseballs, pre-war pinballs from the 1930s, wedge heads, wood

[07:18] rails, really goofy arcade games like the mannequin arcade games from the 50s where, you

[07:24] know, like 10 strike and, and jinkle to player basketball.

[07:28] Basically, you put a coin in it.

[07:30] I love it.

[07:31] So, you know, I've got vending machines.

[07:33] I've got, you know, candy machine, soda machine.

[07:37] I've got three jukeboxes in my house.

[07:39] So any of that's coin operated stuff.

[07:42] I love it.

[07:43] I'm addicted to it.

[07:44] Obviously pinball, you know, is, is the more of the thing that I put my hand on and I play

[07:51] myself as a collector, whereas the other things are more, maybe a collectible aspect, you

[07:57] know, but as far as the business side.

[07:59] So I've, I've been in the hobby primarily with pinball, but again, I run in different circles

[08:04] and, you know, I can tell you that as big as there is a pinball community, you know,

[08:09] there's a community of people that collect slot machines and they have their clubs and

[08:14] their groups and their shows no different than the pinball people do.

[08:17] It may not be as big.

[08:19] There's people that do jukeboxes and there's a whole community there and they have their

[08:23] own newsletters and magazines and websites like that.

[08:26] I got to ask Joe, do the jukebox people fight as much as the pinball people about jukeboxes?

[08:33] Nobody fights as much as the people.

[08:36] It just doesn't happen.

[08:37] All right.

[08:38] I need to declare five.

[08:40] Yeah.

[08:41] No, no, they're, they're, they're all pretty, pretty sedate and they don't really have the

[08:46] forum like, you know, pin side or, or P, the predecessor, predecessor, so to speak,

[08:52] right, of pin side.

[08:53] But as far as the distributing, I've been a customer and good friend of Jack Winneries.

[08:59] Gosh, probably for the whole time that I've been in the hobby I used to buy on my stern

[09:04] games from Jack and other arcade related things for years.

[09:09] And then when Jack started the company, obviously, I, you know, signed up to buy a Wizard of

[09:13] Oz to support him.

[09:15] And then just over time, I mean, I think there was a point in time, maybe in 2012 prior

[09:20] to the Wizard of Oz starting the ship, but shortly after that, he started the company

[09:27] that I had an opportunity to visit the factory and just wanted to see what he was doing.

[09:31] And, and it just kind of sprang from there, you know, we, we started talking and, you

[09:36] know, Jack was always known.

[09:38] He grew pinball sales, which was his, his, he was a distributor and he grew that to the

[09:44] point of, you know, probably obviously being, you know, one of the largest distributors

[09:48] in the country.

[09:50] And Jack's reputation was based on, you know, customer service and, and making sure the

[09:56] customer was always happy.

[09:58] I can remember there were a couple games and he teases me about it that I wasn't totally

[10:02] thrilled with, you know, the quality of the product that came in, I got, you know, one,

[10:06] one game from Stern that the cabinet was, was damaged and, and they repainted it.

[10:11] And it was a little disappointing to me that, you know, they would send a collector a game

[10:15] that had touch ups on it after it was damaged.

[10:18] And, you know, about, about two weeks later, I got a call from the trucking company and

[10:23] they said, we have a delivery for you.

[10:26] And they said, I don't have anything coming to me.

[10:28] And they said, well, we've got a delivery for you from Stern pinball.

[10:32] And we'd like to bring it tomorrow.

[10:33] So I'm thinking, okay, we'll bring it.

[10:35] I had no idea what was coming.

[10:37] And, you know, I, I allow the trucking guys to bring the box into my house and I opened

[10:43] it up and it's a cabinet for the NASCAR game that I bought that I just recently complained

[10:48] about it.

[10:49] And I asked for that.

[10:50] I didn't ask for any money back or anything, but Jack took it upon himself, you know, to

[10:55] make sure that I was happy.

[10:57] And that's kind of the way that he's been.

[11:00] And when our conversation started about being a distributor, it always stuck to me, you

[11:06] know, one thing that he mentioned to me was that, you know, I want to have distributors

[11:11] representing me.

[11:12] I don't want the 800 pound gorillas and I won't mention any names, but more corporate type,

[11:18] you know, entities.

[11:19] I really want people that are in the hobby, that are active, that know the collectors

[11:24] and are respected and are going to treat customers that they, you know, end up getting by selling

[11:30] my game the same way that I would treat them.

[11:33] So, you know, that was really impressive to me that, you know, and if you look at a lot

[11:37] of my peers in, you know, with Jersey Jack and the lot with the stern guys to a lot of

[11:43] them overlap and some don't, but, you know, you look at any of them.

[11:47] I'm friends with many of them.

[11:49] Gary had able to electron.

[11:50] Thanks, Jesse from Pincage in Indiana, buddy down at Mountain Entertainment in Virginia,

[11:57] Larry Kitchen out in Kentucky.

[12:00] They're all just really good pinball people, you know, they love the hobby.

[12:03] They've got collections themselves and they get it.

[12:06] They know what it's like to, you know, get a new inbox game and be happy to get it and

[12:12] everybody, you know, tries to make the experience really good.

[12:15] So, Jack did a good job and, you know, for the most part with the people that he selected

[12:19] and making sure that, you know, we're in the community, we're at the shows and stuff

[12:24] like that.

[12:25] So, I've been doing it, you know, since the Wizard of Oz and, you know, we've had

[12:28] our ups and downs and fortunately, you know, everybody came through it.

[12:34] And everyone got, yeah, they got down the yellow, big road eventually.

[12:37] Well, we're going to talk about sort of like the ups and downs of the whole journey to

[12:42] get through where we are today.

[12:44] So, Joe, just so, again, we're going to get just a little background stuff.

[12:47] Talk to me about what is a distributor do, right?

[12:51] In terms of like, so you're going out there and helping Jersey Jack, you're helping the

[12:57] spooky, fine customers, customers place orders with you.

[13:02] And then the games go from those manufacturers to a location that you hold and then the

[13:08] games go out to customers.

[13:09] Or how does, like, what's exactly, like, what is it, what goes on in the world of a

[13:13] distributor for pinball?

[13:14] Well, basically what happens, I could use, you know, any of the games as an example, but

[13:21] to answer your question where the games go, they go both places.

[13:25] We will drop ship directly to the customer, you know, if they place an order, for example,

[13:31] let's say the Hobbit, you know, maybe we had 75 pre-orders before the game went into

[13:36] production.

[13:38] And then we facilitate, you know, once the games are getting made and we would get an

[13:44] allotment, you know, we get in line even if I, you know, buy 100 games on day one, I obviously

[13:50] don't get 100 games on day one.

[13:52] And what they do is on a very fair nature, you know, they would say, okay, you know, we

[13:58] sold whatever, you know, pick a number out of the yard.

[14:00] We sold 1500 Hobbits, you know, you ordered 10% of them or 8% of them, whatever, you're

[14:06] going to get 8% of the games we make every month.

[14:09] So I might get an allotment, let's say of the Hobbit each month of, you know, 10, some

[14:14] months I got 15 games and then I would allocate them, you know, fairly in the order in which

[14:21] the orders were placed to my customers.

[14:23] And in those instances they were drop ship, you know, there's no sense in, you know, having

[14:28] the games even though I'm very close, I'm here in Pennsylvania, I'm very close to the

[14:32] factory in Jersey, I can shoot down there and be home the same day and we do go pick inventory

[14:38] up there.

[14:39] But for the most part, a lot of the pre-order games are drop ship to the customer.

[14:43] We facilitate the shipping, we handle, you know, the payment of the cost of the chain,

[14:49] we make sure that the tracking information is delivered to the customer that they're

[14:53] excited, you know, that there's games going to be coming next week and a big part of it.

[14:57] And fortunately, this whole pre-order model is done, but, you know, trust me, the biggest

[15:00] part of the job, you know, on the earlier games and even with other companies that I represent,

[15:06] you know, with Spooky and Chicago gaming, with the medieval madness remake, you know, all

[15:13] these games are basically pay me now and wait to get your game.

[15:17] And the biggest part of the job is just communication and keep it in touch with people and, you know,

[15:23] sometimes we felt like we had to sell the same guy, the same game, you know, make the same

[15:27] sale three or four times because we were touching the customer so often to reassure them

[15:33] that, you know, the game was getting made, where they are in production.

[15:37] And one thing that I learned to try to do to, you know, make that process a little bit

[15:42] more palatable for everybody is to do regular updates, whether it be by email and basically

[15:48] say, hey, and I take trips to the factory.

[15:52] For no reason other than, you know, I'd go down to the factory, I'd snap about 100 pictures

[15:57] and then I would either put them on Facebook or, you know, do an email blast to my customers

[16:03] and if they've been waiting for their hobbit for a year, it was nice for them to see that

[16:07] I actually walked into factory.

[16:09] I would take picture of all the smog heads on a table and it meant something.

[16:13] It was real and tangible then that the game was getting close to being made.

[16:18] So a lot of it was, you know, lack of a better term.

[16:21] It was handholding during that period where everybody was getting anxious to let them

[16:25] know that I had confidence that, you know, the game was going to be made and the game

[16:29] was going to be great and, you know, that it was coming and I was in touch with the factory

[16:36] I knew what was going on and a lot of it was just, you know, communication was a big part

[16:40] of it.

[16:41] So from there, you know, we shipped the game and obviously then we're available after

[16:46] the sale.

[16:48] That's a big part, you know, and sometimes what sets some distributors, you know, from

[16:54] others is whether they're going to be there after the sale.

[16:58] You know, it frustrates me sometimes when I get calls from, you know, customers that

[17:02] bought a game from another distributor and they call me because they have an issue because

[17:07] they can't get a return phone call.

[17:09] And, you know, frankly, that sucks.

[17:11] That's not what the hobby should be about and, you know, let's face it, these games aren't

[17:15] $3,000 anymore.

[17:17] They're, you know, $8,000, $9,000.

[17:19] You have to be there to answer the phone call.

[17:21] So it varies, Canada.

[17:23] It could be, you know, we sell a lot of games to new customers who own no games.

[17:29] The Wizard of Oz brought a lot of new people to the hobby.

[17:33] Women drove a lot of sales of the Wizard of Oz.

[17:36] It was amazing.

[17:37] It shows, you know, we'd have the wives come up and typically the husbands have to go,

[17:42] you know, find the wife and the show and come back and try to convince her to buy a

[17:45] game and the Wizard of Oz was kind of the opposite.

[17:48] I would kind of, because I'd sit back and I'd see the wife, you know, controlling the

[17:52] decision and saying, well, you know, I don't want that.

[17:56] What other, you know, other game that you're looking at, I want the Wizard of Oz.

[17:59] And, you know, if they have kids, it was an easy sale from that, from that respect.

[18:04] And a lot of times, you know, it's a simple is, I've done phone calls where we, you know,

[18:10] I asked the customer if they have an iPhone and we'll do FaceTime.

[18:15] And if it's, how do you open the box and I'll tell them, you know, how to cut the box

[18:19] and where to cut it that you're not going to hit your game and then how to put the legs on.

[18:23] So, you know, not everybody that buys a pinball machine, you know, has 20 of them in their

[18:28] basement.

[18:29] This may be their first purchase.

[18:30] And then of course, you know, for the season guys, you know, we're there to help with tweaking

[18:35] issues, usually if there's something off with a game out of the box, you know, we might

[18:40] have seen that issue before.

[18:43] So we can assist them with, you know, any switch adjustments or any tweaks that may have

[18:48] to come.

[18:49] I know what the Wizard of Oz, there was an issue with, and it was a minor thing and it didn't

[18:55] happen a lot, but it was, you know, a lot of times, maybe not a lot, like five times

[19:00] out of all the games I sold, maybe a customer would have, they turned their game on and the

[19:04] LCD screen would want to come on.

[19:06] And I knew that the cable leading up the input cable leading up to the LCD screen during

[19:12] transit and shipping had a tendency to kind of work its way loose.

[19:15] So, you know, something as simple as that that, you know, they get their game on a Friday

[19:19] night, they don't want to wait till Monday morning to be able to play it, you know, they

[19:23] would call us on a Saturday morning or Sunday or whatever.

[19:27] And it was nice to kind of have some experience to know, you know, hey, just take your back

[19:32] glass off and look at some of this stuff.

[19:34] And then obviously if it's more difficult and it becomes a parts issue, you know, then

[19:40] we get tech support involved, you know, whether it's, you know, Charlie at Spooky or the guys

[19:46] at Jersey Jack and, you know, we get that involved and they'll help to bug the issue and get

[19:52] parts out that are needed.

[19:53] But it's always good, you know, a distributor, a lot of times, not that any of these companies

[19:58] aren't going to take care of their people.

[20:01] But it's nice that, you know, a distributor or a customer emails me and says, hey, I

[20:05] still never got my whatever.

[20:07] You know, I'm going to get their ticket to the top of the list and I'll get that part

[20:11] out today because I'm going to be part of the, you know, the process now and get involved

[20:18] and make a phone call or shoot an email.

[20:20] So, we get that question sometimes.

[20:22] Right.

[20:23] What value do we bring to the equation and then I get it.

[20:25] It makes sense.

[20:26] So you've probably had probably one of the most arduous journeys as a, you know, to start

[20:32] off as a distributor with two titles that did see fairly sizable delays, right.

[20:38] So what was it like taking money on Wizard of Oz's right and then there was that long

[20:43] period of waiting for the games to ship?

[20:47] And I know the same thing happened with the Hobbit and we don't, we don't have to belabor

[20:51] this.

[20:52] I want to move on to the future because I think a lot of those things are in the past.

[20:55] But as a distributor, how do you keep people calm who have thousands of dollars invested

[21:01] on something that turned into waiting for years to get?

[21:05] It's, it was hard.

[21:07] I mean, it was hell.

[21:09] It was hell for all the manufacturers.

[21:11] And again, it's not just the Jersey Jack problem.

[21:15] You know, the people would, you know, buyers with ghost busters have been going through

[21:19] it this year.

[21:20] Right.

[21:21] Huge delay from the anticipated date for the medieval madness remake and obviously

[21:29] both titles with Jersey Jack and it's difficult.

[21:33] It's hard.

[21:35] You know, if we tried it, we tried to balance, you know, even financially paying our

[21:41] invoices to the company where, you know, it got to a point where customers didn't want

[21:45] to pay anymore money because they weren't seeing the product coming out.

[21:48] So that was a bunch, you know, financially just to run a business and, you know, have

[21:54] to manage that.

[21:55] And that wasn't everybody.

[21:56] I mean, but there were percentage of people that were going to say, hey, I'm going to

[21:59] stay in, but, you know, I'm not paying anymore payments and you have to accept that and

[22:05] appreciate it and, you know, understand that that's just the nature of the beast at that

[22:10] point.

[22:11] You know, it's hard.

[22:12] I mean, really the, you know, the best thing that, you know, you can do or we can do is

[22:18] just say, if you want to get out, then here's your money and then it happened.

[22:23] It happened to a lot of people.

[22:25] I can't tell you how many people were in, let's say, on the Hobbit and then got tired

[22:29] of the weight and got out and, you know, we always call it, you know, they saw another

[22:34] butterfly.

[22:35] You know, you'd get the walking dead game coming out or I was going to say WrestleMania,

[22:41] but that probably wasn't a good example.

[22:43] Those people learned the lesson for sure.

[22:46] Yeah.

[22:47] You know, you get a lot of those, you know, issues coming up where people just don't want

[22:52] to have their money tied up and they want to buy something that they paid for.

[22:56] And it made total sense.

[22:57] And there were a lot of people that dropped out of the Hobbit and then ended up coming

[23:02] back, you know, majority of them, you know, later on in the process when the game was

[23:05] ready to ship.

[23:07] And I think during those years that all these companies were doing that and I say we're

[23:12] doing that because I really strongly believe that that, you know, it is a thing of the

[23:17] past now, which is Jack, you know, with Dyle Dinn, we're only taking a $250, which is

[23:22] basically nothing, you know, refundable deposit, no more money.

[23:27] We don't want any of your money until your game is starting to ship.

[23:33] So, you know, that's fantastic from my perspective.

[23:38] Yeah.

[23:39] We're going to talk about Dyle then in a second because that is on everyone's mind.

[23:42] And we're going to get there.

[23:44] So I mean, I always wonder like with Hobbit, like I know Jack secured another round of financing

[23:52] through the whole process to get Hobbit out.

[23:54] Was there ever a time where you were nervous like, you know, financially starting a new

[23:59] pinball company and trying to do what Jack's doing is a difficult venture that things were

[24:04] kind of dicey and even you were anxious that I'm sitting on all this money that customers

[24:09] have given to make this game and it may not happen.

[24:13] And how do I communicate if things do go financially uncertain, right?

[24:18] And luckily that didn't happen, right?

[24:20] We didn't have to cross that bridge.

[24:23] But are you glad now that like no more games are being fully pre-sold and that it's more,

[24:29] they're not going to take money until games are ready to go.

[24:33] Absolutely.

[24:34] I don't want, that's not my money.

[24:36] Like when a customer pays on a game, they're paying for a product that I don't produce.

[24:42] I'm the middle man providing a service.

[24:44] You know, we go to the shows and get the games out there to the public.

[24:47] But it's not my money.

[24:49] I never want it.

[24:51] And I never did, to be honest with you, I know other distributors had a different way

[24:56] of handling things.

[24:58] But if a customer paid me that money, typically the next day, or when I made another large payment

[25:07] within the next two weeks or whatever, that money went into, not just Erzy Jack, but every

[25:12] company that's out there.

[25:15] And yeah, I don't want to say it's not scary.

[25:17] It's scary because I have a fiduciary responsibility then to that customer that paid me.

[25:24] And I now then dump that money in another entity's hands, entrusting it that they're

[25:30] going to deliver the product.

[25:31] And again, you know, you asked me somewhere in there whether I ever had any doubts and

[25:36] the answers no.

[25:38] I never did with any of these companies because for the reasons I said before, I was always,

[25:47] you know, every day I'm talking to people every day.

[25:50] I know vendors that work with these companies.

[25:52] I know what they're making.

[25:54] I know, you know, I knew where these companies were and if there were slowdowns, we had reasons.

[26:01] You know, a lot of people can prophesize on, on Pinside or wherever that, you know,

[26:08] XYZ company was in financial trouble.

[26:10] But a lot of times they didn't really know the story.

[26:12] They didn't know if there were delays in production because of vendors.

[26:16] They didn't know if there were delays in production because the company was being extremely quality

[26:23] conscious and maybe vendors were sending parts that were not acceptable.

[26:28] And that's happened with a couple of the different companies that I represent.

[26:34] And that's a good thing.

[26:35] You know, I'd rather, and they took it on the chin, you know, they would have to sit there

[26:39] and listen to people say, well, you know, there's something seriously wrong or there's financial

[26:44] problems when in fact, maybe the people that they hired, you know, to make products weren't

[26:50] delivering to products either per spec or they weren't delivering to products of the quality

[26:55] that they expected and wanted to build a game with.

[26:58] So, you know, they throw the vendor under the bus just to appease the mom on the phone.

[27:04] And a lot of that went on and to me that was kind of a frustrating thing, even on a personal

[27:09] level that I'd see, you know, all these companies that I represent taken it on the chin.

[27:15] And sometimes there were real legitimate reasons why, you know, they stopped production on a

[27:21] particular game for two months, you know, to get parts in that were the quality that they

[27:26] wanted.

[27:27] And they were doing a good thing.

[27:28] You know, they could have said, you know, the hell would it?

[27:30] You know, we want to ship games.

[27:32] That's how we make money and people are busing our chops.

[27:35] So we're just going to give them a game and we'll give them what parts we get in.

[27:38] That didn't happen.

[27:40] And that's a good thing.

[27:42] And I think you see a lot of that now with, you know, the quality of the products that

[27:47] all these companies are making now.

[27:49] You know, is it perfect?

[27:51] You know, are the prices perfect for everybody?

[27:53] No, are the games perfect?

[27:56] No, you know, were there hiccups with the Wizard of Oz with the LED boards?

[28:00] Absolutely.

[28:02] But, you know what, they fixed it.

[28:03] And they fixed everybody's game that had a problem.

[28:06] And they totally redesigned those LED boards and came up with an entire new configuration

[28:12] and it cost them a lot of money to do that to fix the problem.

[28:16] So yeah, it was a difficult process, but you know, I never didn't have confidence that

[28:22] games weren't going to be delivered.

[28:23] Now, with that said, I should tell you that I did lose money on both Predator and J-Pop,

[28:28] so what the hell do I know?

[28:30] Which J-Pop game did you go in on?

[28:33] I was in on Raza and Alice in Wonderland.

[28:38] So being in on those two, and this is a quick tangent discussion, are you, do you want

[28:44] Magic Girl to be made?

[28:46] Are you in the camp of, let's bankrupt Zidware and everyone get a check for 100 bucks all

[28:52] today?

[28:53] Man, that's such a difficult question.

[28:54] It's really a difficult question.

[28:56] I don't even know that I know the answer.

[28:59] I mean, I was friends with John.

[29:01] So it was very disappointing to me.

[29:03] You know, John and I would chat about what he was doing.

[29:06] I had a lot of respect for him.

[29:09] I don't want to say he was my favorite designer ever, but he absolutely was somebody that

[29:17] I respected his ingenuity, his inventiveness.

[29:22] Trust me, there were probably several phone calls along the line where, you know, I would

[29:26] try to twist Jack's arm to have a conversation with John about bringing him on board and

[29:32] things like that.

[29:33] Obviously, you know, Jack knew what he was doing and had his game plan already lined up.

[29:36] But, yeah, it was a really strange thing.

[29:41] I had the utmost confidence in John, but, you know, who knew that, you know, it was such

[29:49] a, I don't know.

[29:51] Nobody knew.

[29:52] So it's just such a disaster financially and product and, you know, just building the

[30:00] game that he was just tinkering the whole time.

[30:03] I mean, that's along and short of it.

[30:04] And I still think he's tinkering too.

[30:07] I don't think Magic Girls done.

[30:08] So I don't think, you know, as much as I love to see what, what, what becomes of the fruits

[30:13] of that labor, I am very skeptical that we will see it anytime soon, which is unfortunate.

[30:19] I don't know.

[30:20] You know, like they were supposed to deliver games at Expo and that didn't happen.

[30:26] And then, and again, I don't want to begrudge American pinball from what I understand, people

[30:32] that have talked to the owners that, you know, they really, they really have their shit

[30:36] together and their good people and they're trying to, let's face it, they don't have any

[30:41] responsibility to any of us goofballs that lost money with with J-pop.

[30:47] And obviously they hired him.

[30:49] They have an association with that and, and they are trying to, to make, you know, make

[30:55] it right.

[30:56] You know, the difficult part of the equation for me that I really can't answer your question.

[31:01] What I like to see everybody that paid for Magic Girl because they paid more money than

[31:06] the, you know, we did.

[31:08] And they also waited longer.

[31:10] What I like to see those guys get games absolutely.

[31:13] Do I think that that's ever going to morph into them completing two other games, one

[31:18] of which was just artwork on paper in Ellison Wonderland?

[31:22] No, I don't think Raza or Ellison Wonderland will ever see the light of day.

[31:27] And I think these guys have kind of alluded to the fact that if they can get Magic Girl

[31:31] out, then they would make some sort of concession, right, whether it be, you know, a, you know,

[31:37] money off of Houdini or some kind of credit.

[31:40] And you know what?

[31:41] It's better than what we had a month ago.

[31:42] If he was a month ago, we had nothing but, you know, a pit in our stomach and discussed

[31:48] the whole situation.

[31:49] Right.

[31:50] Well, we'll see what happens.

[31:51] We're going to be following this.

[31:52] You know, like, I hope they can stay true to the word and get it out this year.

[31:54] So talking about staying true to the word, like, I have to ask you, Joe.

[31:59] So Jack himself said, you are not going to see the Lullard game until it's radyship,

[32:06] right?

[32:08] We are not going to take any money on it until it's ready to ship.

[32:12] So obviously we saw it at Expo and we saw it in a very, I love that they brought five

[32:17] games.

[32:18] I thought, we're going to talk all about the game.

[32:20] But what, so what happened there?

[32:23] Like the game is not shipping yet and it's revealed.

[32:26] So Jack has a tendency sort of, you know, to go a little bit back and forth on his statements.

[32:31] When, when that happened, are you like, they're going to call us out, dude, for not having

[32:35] it ready to ship when we reveal or do you think like people didn't mind because they

[32:39] saw the game and are excited by the state of it in terms of how far long it looks?

[32:46] Well, I don't know.

[32:47] And again, it's pure honesty here.

[32:50] I don't know that he ever said, obviously the discourse was going to be that, you know,

[32:58] this isn't going to be any kind of pre-order model.

[33:00] And when we show this game, it's going to be a complete game and not, you know, Jack always

[33:04] uses, you know, busting himself.

[33:06] A lot we say that the first Wizard of Oz is that he showed for quite a while.

[33:10] We're nothing more than a box of lights.

[33:12] And that term came from him.

[33:15] And I think we absolutely saw something different with Dial-Din.

[33:19] They had five and I don't even think you can call these game prototype games the way

[33:24] they were built.

[33:25] I mean, they got beat up on for four days at that show and everybody I've talked to,

[33:30] I don't know that they had to remove the glass on these games.

[33:33] They had five of them that they had there once.

[33:36] These were, you know, obviously they were prototype games individually built, but, you

[33:40] know, they were commercial grade, you know, they weren't, you know, fake parts put in as

[33:46] stopgaps until they finished all the engine for certain parts.

[33:50] These are, you know, as close to a production game that you're going to get, they played

[33:55] like a game.

[33:56] You know, the most impressive thing to me is that, you know, everybody says in Keith Johnson

[34:01] would say we're, you know, the code on the game Dial-Din right now is about 20%.

[34:06] And I don't think you'd have anybody walk away from that game saying that it wasn't a

[34:09] playable game or they didn't, you know, they didn't, they felt that they saw everything,

[34:14] you know, after they played a three ball game or anything of the sword.

[34:19] So that to me was, was very impressive, you know, that when they did show the game, it

[34:25] was, you know, the game played great.

[34:27] I mean, I was at Expo, the game looked like I could take it home with me.

[34:31] I mean, it nothing about it felt prototype, nothing about it felt pre-production.

[34:38] And even like the code at 20% still felt further along than some stern games after two years,

[34:44] Kisely anyone.

[34:45] But anyway, let's talk Dial-Din.

[34:49] And I guess the first question I wanted to ask you as a distributor, as I wanted to

[34:53] like, almost challenge you Joe, like, sell me Dial-Din.

[35:00] Sell Dial-Din to a non pinball fan, right?

[35:05] How would you sell it to them?

[35:07] Well, I think the biggest thing with this game, and I'll even say over, over Wizard of

[35:14] Oz and the Hobbit, and you know, I'm not going to bring in other company's games, you

[35:20] know, but pretty much pinball for the last 20 years.

[35:25] And you know what?

[35:26] And I'm going to steal another phrase from Jack.

[35:28] I had a conversation with Jack the week before Expo, and he made a comment to me, and he

[35:34] said, you know, I really think we have a big hit here.

[35:39] Everybody that owns one pinball machine is probably would like to own this game.

[35:46] I think we have something that's going to appeal to everybody.

[35:50] And the one thing that you feel really good to hear him say, because I've seen him in

[35:56] the good times, and when the times weren't so good, and the toll that it took on Jack personally,

[36:04] is, you know, he said, I finally have the game that when I started this company, I set

[36:10] out to do.

[36:11] As great as the Wizard of Oz is, as far as the Hobbit, you know, surpassed the Wizard

[36:16] of Oz in many aspects, he goes, this is actually the game that when I started the company,

[36:22] and I wanted to build a full feature, technologically advanced pinball machine that wasn't being done,

[36:30] you know, for the last 20 years, this game is as close as I'm going to get to succeeding

[36:36] there.

[36:37] The biggest thing about this game that sets it out, and everybody that played it, you

[36:41] know, and we can talk about the misconceptions of, well, it's a cell phone game, or I don't

[36:46] like the name, or I don't like the guy holding the cell phone in the air.

[36:50] And again, you know, there's time for some of those things to be adjusted, and Jack did

[36:54] a lude, you know, that maybe, you know, Saturday when he did his Switch broadcast, a week

[36:59] after Expo, you know, he is coming out with a lower priced standard model, you know,

[37:06] he did mention about the name that there's possibility that, you know, maybe it would

[37:11] be called Quantum City, something or other dialed in, you know, is still going to be there.

[37:16] But the biggest selling part of this game, and when people play this game, either at a

[37:22] show, or at a launch party, or, you know, when it does start shipping, what's going to win

[37:28] people over is what everybody's been clamoring for in this hobby for years and years is

[37:33] original theme.

[37:35] The neatest thing about the seminar is before the seminar started, they passed out

[37:41] comic books.

[37:42] And before they showed the game, or started discussing the game, they went up and down

[37:46] the aisles and passed out comic books.

[37:47] And that was a precursor right there, what was going to be special about this game is

[37:51] that it's Pat Lawler, and there's a story behind the gameplay.

[37:55] You're not just going to step up to the game, and it's, you know, it's the latest hot,

[38:02] you know, superhero movie, and, or it's the hobbit, and basically you just have to

[38:08] shoot this ramp five times and earn this character from the movie or the TV show or what

[38:13] have you.

[38:14] You know, what we have with dialed in is a whole brand new, you know, world, so to speak.

[38:20] You know, we've got the city, you know, Quantum City, we've got characters in there.

[38:27] So the guy on the play field that moves back and forth, his name is, I think it's QED

[38:33] and he's the mascot for the company.

[38:39] And what the whole story behind the game and part of what they tried to allude to, which

[38:44] I thought was really clever to make a comic book to kind of show the backstory, is that

[38:50] this company called Dialed in Electronics, which spells die, which was kind of, you

[38:57] know, neat.

[38:59] They've created the cell phone.

[39:01] They're a corporate energy company that I guess is extremely powerful in Quantum City,

[39:08] and they've created the cell phone, and it's extremely powerful and actually can control

[39:13] disasters.

[39:14] And during the game, you know, there's multiple disasters that can happen, be it a meteor

[39:18] shower, sinkholes, alien invasions, things like that.

[39:23] And the cell phone actually can create the disasters to start attacking Quantum City.

[39:31] So during the game play, you're actually making shots and hitting things to charge the

[39:37] cell phone.

[39:38] And then once the cell phone becomes charged, then a lot of these disasters can start and

[39:43] you see the animations on the screen with the meteor shower coming down.

[39:47] So when I was asked to drain, and I'm sure that was banned on all that sort of stuff,

[39:53] so are you, are you, so this is interesting, because when I was asking people at Expo,

[39:58] I got different responses about the objective of the game.

[40:02] Are you destroying Quantum City or saving it?

[40:06] Well, that, you know, there's kind of two parts to that.

[40:09] And I'm not going to say that I know the answer, because obviously the game and the code

[40:14] isn't mature, and I'll be honest with you.

[40:17] Personally, I've only played three games on it.

[40:20] I, you know, I wasn't going to stand in line as a distributor and, you know, and take

[40:24] people's time when, you know, I'm going to be having a launch event in two weeks in

[40:30] Philly, and I can go visit the factory.

[40:32] So I wasn't going to be a pig and just play the game three hours straight.

[40:36] So, you know, I learned a lot on Saturday, as I'm sure a lot of people did from the Twitch

[40:41] broadcast.

[40:42] And there was some discussion on that as to whether, you know, the guy with the cell phone

[40:48] is a hero.

[40:49] Now, supposedly, he got a hold of the cell, these powerful cell phones that the power company

[40:56] didn't want out in public.

[40:58] They want to control them.

[41:00] And this guy has the cell phone, and you as the player, possess the cell phone and the

[41:05] ability to charge it and use it.

[41:08] And the power company or the corporation is fighting against you in the game.

[41:14] So my opinion at this point is that you are playing as the person that has the cell phone,

[41:21] and you're either creating these natural disasters, which maybe makes you the villain, but you're

[41:27] also fighting the corporation that is trying to get the cell phone back to you.

[41:33] You know, there's need features in the game where there's lightning bolts, I don't

[41:38] want to say lightning bolts, but there's lights that will come down in a lightning bolt

[41:41] fashion.

[41:42] And when they zap your flippers, your flippers will actually shake and you'll lose control

[41:46] of them.

[41:47] So if you're cradling the ball or holding the ball, you see during a multi-ball, you know,

[41:52] those lights coming down to your flipper, you have a little time to react, but you have

[41:55] to know that whatever you're doing, you got to get that ball over to the other flipper

[41:59] or you got to just get it up into play field.

[42:02] So I think there's a lot of creativity.

[42:04] I think the thing that sets this game out, you ask me to sell this game to somebody, is

[42:10] we haven't seen a storyline in a game that you can get involved with and follow and solve

[42:15] problems and reach objectives following a storyline and understand what's behind it.

[42:24] You know, since Pat Lauer was designing back in the Valley Williams days and all the

[42:28] other guys were, they were, they would create a theme like Worldwend, you know, a part

[42:32] of that.

[42:33] Well, I guess, hey, there's a disaster and you have to escape it and you make shots to

[42:37] do that.

[42:38] I guess my, I guess the question I had is, if I call you up and I say, I'm looking for

[42:44] a pinball machine, right?

[42:45] And say like I'm a new customer, right?

[42:47] Because I think what a lot of people can easily grasp, if someone's a fan of the hobbit,

[42:53] you've got a machine for them, right?

[42:54] If I have a family and we like Wizard of Oz, I got a machine for you.

[42:59] Well, like the original IP from a distributor, right?

[43:02] Does it, is it tricky to try and explain to someone who doesn't know who Pat Lauer is,

[43:06] who doesn't know anything about, you know, his pedigree?

[43:10] How do you explain that this is the game that that new to pinball person would want to

[43:17] get into, right?

[43:18] If you feel like that's going to be a challenge knowing that it is a little bit difficult

[43:21] to articulate what the actual game is compared to being like, oh, like it's the hobbit.

[43:27] You've seen the movies and you just, you know, this is the pinball version.

[43:31] I think that's a great question.

[43:33] And I'm going to be honest with you.

[43:34] I think it's a very valid question.

[43:39] And I honestly haven't thought of that up to this point because most of the sales, or

[43:45] all of the sales that we've done just in the short weeks since the game was revealed,

[43:49] had been to pin people.

[43:50] But obviously when I start hitting shows with this game, or we start fielding calls from

[43:55] people that are maybe new to the hobby or don't really understand, I think, you know,

[44:01] these people are going to need a little bit more of an explanation in terms of what's

[44:06] there and how it affects the gameplay.

[44:09] Because it is easy to make a sale.

[44:12] I had a customer two months ago.

[44:15] He called me up.

[44:16] He's never owned a pinball machine.

[44:18] And his family loves fantasy type of themes.

[44:23] He saw the hobbit game.

[44:25] He called me up.

[44:26] He was a nice guy.

[44:27] We probably spent a good hour and a half on the phone just talking about pinball, talking

[44:31] about the hobbit.

[44:32] At the end of the conversation, he says, yeah, I'm going to buy this hobbit machine.

[44:35] And then he kind of shocked me because you don't really get this from people when they

[44:38] buy their first machine.

[44:40] He said, if I wanted to have two pinball machines, what else would you recommend?

[44:45] And just from listening to him, typically, you know, he said he had two young daughters.

[44:50] Instinctively, I would always then gravitate towards, you know, the Wizard of Oz is being

[44:56] something, especially with daughters, that it's going to be a theme that they're going

[45:00] to enjoy.

[45:01] But because of how intunous this guy was with, you know, fantasy aspect and not necessarily

[45:08] science fiction, but, you know, just characters.

[45:11] He loved the Tolkien books and things.

[45:14] And I started explaining medieval manist to him.

[45:16] I, you know, I told him, I said, you know, you're going to have somewhat of a serious intense

[45:22] game to play with the hobbit.

[45:26] And I told him, I pointed him to some YouTube videos to go check out medieval manness.

[45:31] And I said, what are you going to get with medieval manness?

[45:33] And I said, it's a 20 year old game, yes.

[45:36] But it's also the number one rated pinball machine of all time for a reason because it scores

[45:41] a 10 on all cylinders.

[45:43] It's an original theme.

[45:44] It's got humor.

[45:45] It's got cool artwork.

[45:46] It's got tongue in cheek, you know, humor that the adults are going to get.

[45:50] It's got great mechanics with the castle and the drawbridge and catapult and all that good

[45:54] stuff.

[45:55] And I said, you know what, if you like that kind of theme, that may be your good second

[46:02] game.

[46:03] I mean, I didn't expect them.

[46:04] He ended up buying both games at the same time, you know, a couple days later.

[46:08] I didn't expect them to do that.

[46:10] But, you know, to answer your question, yes, a lot of times we get people coming to us.

[46:15] With preconceived ideas of what they like, you know, we made a ton of sales to people just

[46:20] because it was the Wizard of Oz.

[46:22] And you know, they didn't, they could care less whether, you know, the witch went up and

[46:27] down or we, whether we had magnets and whether we had too many play fields in an LCD screen,

[46:32] they just knew that everybody and their family knew the Wizard of Oz and it was going to

[46:36] be a great thing that they can do with their kids.

[46:39] So yeah, with dialed in, absolutely, we're going to have, I don't want to say it's going

[46:43] to be a challenge, but we're going to have to take a little bit more effort, maybe

[46:47] for people outside of the hobby to what I just did, that there's actually a story here

[46:53] that your kids, you know, and you as an adult can kind of learn once you get the game.

[46:59] And again, a good thing is why this game is different than just, you know, maybe every

[47:04] other game that's come out in the last 20 years that hasn't been an unlicensed theme

[47:10] and why it's a little special.

[47:11] So yeah, I mean, very well could be a challenge.

[47:14] I don't know that it'll be a challenge sales-wise.

[47:17] I think in person, it's going to be easy for people to get it, but maybe over the phone,

[47:23] like you said, versus saying, hey, it's the pinball version of the Hobbit movies, you know,

[47:27] Boom, Sail Made.

[47:29] Well, and you know, like, it's a purposely tough question, right?

[47:33] Because people are not even inherently in tune with the pinball hobby or probably not

[47:38] going to be running out to buy 9,000-on machine.

[47:41] That is, is engineered to be more for the collector, right?

[47:44] So let's-

[47:45] It would be surprise.

[47:46] Well, yeah, there's a lot of people out there.

[47:49] There's me.

[47:50] I know.

[47:51] Let's talk about the mood when this was revealed, right?

[47:54] Because in my Expo recap, I called it a Tale of Two Expos.

[47:58] And there was being at Expo, and there was reading about Expo on Pinside and seeing

[48:04] stuff through Periscope.

[48:06] And what was it like when they revealed this game?

[48:09] And the initial response was basically people just judging a book by its cover and judging

[48:15] a book by its name.

[48:17] When people were freaking out about the title dialed in and saying, like, no one wants a

[48:22] cell phone based game, was there a little bit of panic, you know, within the jack camp

[48:28] and the Pat camp, like, what are people going to give this a chance?

[48:32] Or what was the mood like within the inner circle there?

[48:36] No, there was no panic whatsoever.

[48:40] And the reason is, is because we were selling games, like, left and right.

[48:47] I'll be honest with you, I sold a couple dozen, dozen within two days, Thursday through

[48:54] Saturday at Expo.

[48:56] When you say, Joe, do you mean like people put 250 down and people bought the whole game?

[49:01] Well, 250.

[49:02] I mean, an order.

[49:03] And again, that obviously can change over time.

[49:06] But, you know, we had interest in the game after it was revealed.

[49:11] We had interest prior to it being revealed.

[49:13] I didn't really want to start taking anyone's money or anything like that.

[49:18] We, you know, we did maybe about the day before the reveal because I was getting customers

[49:24] asking that they wanted to be in line and they wanted to be towards the front of the line.

[49:30] So we did start taking orders.

[49:31] But did we have cancellations after the reveal or did we have people put money down Friday

[49:38] morning and then ask for the refund on Saturday?

[49:42] Absolutely.

[49:43] You know, but, you know, if we had, you know, if I sold 40 games and we had five cancellations,

[49:52] Sunday and Monday, we made five more sales once people read a little bit further.

[49:58] And I'll be honest with you, we had multiple customers that bought the game, got out on

[50:06] Friday and then would got back in, you know, earlier this week, Monday and Tuesday.

[50:12] And basically said, hey, I think they jumped the gun a little bit.

[50:15] And this is even before the Twitch broadcast, which really I think did a great job for,

[50:20] you know, bridging the gap between people that were and weren't at Expo because you had

[50:25] all those posts on Pinside, for example, of people said, hey, I was at Expo.

[50:31] I played the game.

[50:32] It's great.

[50:33] You don't get it.

[50:34] Stop calling it a cell phone game.

[50:36] It's not the cell phone's a toy.

[50:37] And yeah, the name is related to a cell phone.

[50:40] And I think the Twitch broadcast kind of maybe hopefully put a lot of those people, you know,

[50:46] in Chicago last week that even though they weren't playing a name, they were able to see

[50:50] it and hear it and listen to Steve Bowden, you know, explain it and, you know, Kevin

[50:57] and Nick did a great job, you know, playing the game and explaining it as they went.

[51:04] So yeah, I mean, you know, did we have people drop out?

[51:06] We had people drop out because of the price.

[51:08] Absolutely.

[51:09] We had people drop out, you know, because they didn't, maybe they didn't like the name.

[51:13] I think that, you know, was very minimal.

[51:16] But, you know, some people didn't like the theme.

[51:18] And I'll tell you what, I think those people that say,

[51:20] well, I don't like the theme.

[51:23] I don't think they would have liked any theme if it didn't, you know, if it wasn't, you

[51:26] know, a superhero or, you know, movies of Hobbits and stuff like that.

[51:32] Like anything new is going to take a little bit to understand and appreciate.

[51:36] I agree.

[51:37] And this is a great example of the hypocrisy that takes place in every hobby where everyone

[51:46] says, give me original IP, give me this, give me, and you give them it.

[51:50] Oh, and they are not happy.

[51:52] But let's talk price because price was probably the biggest conversation next to the actual

[52:00] games themselves.

[52:01] And we've, we've just, for the listeners, we've got three editions of dialed in that are

[52:07] available to purchase.

[52:09] Joe, can you walk us through what each model is and what it is currently priced at?

[52:14] Sure.

[52:15] Absolutely.

[52:17] We'll start with the, the collectors edition, which is over price at 12,500.

[52:28] Those are only going to be for sale until December 31st.

[52:34] The differences, I'll compare that to the limited edition game.

[52:39] And again, are you going to get $3,500 worth of tangible add-ons to your game?

[52:46] No, because the, the M.O. for Jersey Jock is to, you know, make one version of a game better

[52:52] or worse.

[52:53] That's why the standard versions of all of our games always have all the same features

[52:57] and toys for the most part as, you know, the so-called limited edition or the higher price

[53:02] model.

[53:03] The collectors edition, let's face it, whether it's Batman 66 at $15,000 or whether it's

[53:09] styled in at 12 and a half, you know, neither of these companies are, you know, running

[53:16] to the bank even though the price is up there, trust me, I get it, I understand it.

[53:21] But they, neither of them are expecting or going to be selling a huge percentage of all

[53:29] the games across all the models of that game that it's going to carry at the product.

[53:37] You know, that game and Jack has admitted as such is for a discerning, you know, it's

[53:42] a pinball machine, but you get the same thing with, you know, other hobbies and whether

[53:47] it's cars or whatnot.

[53:49] Get this special edition.

[53:51] There's a market of people that want, you know, more bling, they want more recognition,

[53:56] they want, you know, more extras on the game, they want the personal touch to the game,

[54:02] whether it's signatures and things like that.

[54:05] And you know, that's been going on for quite a while since, you know, Stern Dart started

[54:10] doing, you know, the limited edition games and, you know, obviously it's blown up and

[54:16] morphed now.

[54:17] And I'll reserve judgment as to whether it's a good thing or bad thing.

[54:20] You know, it's morphed into being, you know, the collectors edition, super-LE edition

[54:26] games that are available.

[54:27] But you know what, we don't expect to sell them to everybody, you know, we don't expect

[54:34] everybody to be interested in those games, but we've sold them.

[54:37] I mean, I sold them.

[54:38] I've said this with Batman, it's like the only people that are really upset by the price

[54:42] are the people who would never even consider getting it and the people who get it are happy.

[54:46] So, and these are companies, right?

[54:49] There's money left on the table if they don't offer that super premium to the collector,

[54:54] and for the Pat Lawler fanatic, right?

[54:56] The guy out there who's like, I want to have the best of the best.

[55:01] I've been waiting for Pat Lawler pin for a long, long time.

[55:05] And he wants, you know, the collector's edition.

[55:08] Now, yes, you're not going to see the value in it.

[55:11] My one question about the collector's edition, and we'll go down the other two editions.

[55:14] I understand Jack saying we're not going to take any more orders after December 31.

[55:20] But I believe Jack should at that point announce the number that were ordered, so people don't

[55:27] feel like he's going to make them into 2017.

[55:31] What are your thoughts on that?

[55:32] Because when it comes to Jack and his editions, it is shaky ground for people on him making

[55:39] another edition and another edition and another edition.

[55:41] So, what are your thoughts, Joe?

[55:43] I get the whole edition situation with both the Ruby Red on the 75th anniversary with

[55:54] Zervaz and the new Black Arrow edition of The Hobbit.

[56:02] With the collector's edition, I could tell you that, you know, when December 31 comes,

[56:08] they will sell no more games because that's exactly what they did with Smog that was for

[56:13] sale for the same situation.

[56:15] It was announced at Expo and it was only for sale up until December 31 of that year.

[56:21] Even myself as a distributor, and again, when we talked about the painful weight, I had

[56:28] to put just like everybody else.

[56:29] I had to put $4,000 down per game that I wanted of a Smog edition.

[56:36] The deposit you pay is for the most part the same deposit that we as distributors had to

[56:41] pay.

[56:42] I wanted to reserve a number of those games because I knew people would want them.

[56:47] And I couldn't get anymore.

[56:48] I mean, if I wanted another Smog today, I mean, I have them.

[56:51] I have them in stock.

[56:53] It's not that they're not for sale for the public because a distributor like myself that

[56:58] put my money up to have the variety of games of the editions.

[57:04] I wanted to have them for my customers and I wanted to be able to take to a show and

[57:09] have a standard, a limited and Smog edition of Hobbit.

[57:14] And I do it every show.

[57:17] But they made no more.

[57:18] So I can tell you that December 31, that's it.

[57:21] So what was not with the Smog edition?

[57:25] Did they announce how many they made in total or is it just anyone's guess?

[57:33] I don't think they did.

[57:35] I've never specifically asked to be honest with you.

[57:39] I think it's been alluded that it's been somewhere between the 500 and 700 range.

[57:45] I think Jack might have mentioned that in some seminars here or there.

[57:50] That number has been given to me by customers just in conversation.

[57:54] But you know, and again, I don't understand the reasoning whether it is, I don't know

[57:58] that it is a secret number one.

[58:01] But I know Stern doesn't release production numbers for their games.

[58:06] And even as a distributor, I don't get it.

[58:09] I don't understand.

[58:10] I don't know if it shows what's the financial information of the company or why I don't know.

[58:15] I did not releasing the total numbers of the volume products, right?

[58:21] Because it helps your competition out and whatnot.

[58:24] But here's, but with these super expensive versions, right?

[58:28] Like the collector's edition, right?

[58:30] The all, you know, $12,500.

[58:33] There's got it.

[58:34] I know where you're going.

[58:35] There's got to be a value in terms of limiting it.

[58:38] I want to know.

[58:39] I want to know.

[58:40] The Batman guys know that there's only 80 of these damn things in the world that you want

[58:45] one.

[58:46] You've got a pry one of 80 from someone's hands, right?

[58:49] And I think if I'm going to shell out $12,500, I would like Jack at the end of being

[58:53] like, look, we got, you know, 100 orders or 150 orders.

[58:57] Great.

[58:58] All of a sudden, you're part of that elite group.

[59:00] So look, we don't know what he's going to do yet with releasing it.

[59:03] But I think because this is a really special and super expensive variation, I do think it

[59:08] would, you know, benefit them to make everyone who enters into that exclusive club.

[59:14] Just know where they are in that club and how many they're out there.

[59:18] I don't disagree with you one bit.

[59:20] It just hasn't been a topic of conversation yet, but it will be.

[59:24] And again, I don't really see a reason to withhold, you know, the number.

[59:29] Maybe there is a reason.

[59:30] He is obviously both of the companies tend to do that.

[59:34] I think the reason why I bring it up and the reason why, you know, I work in marketing

[59:39] and this is, I think the reason why people would like to see a number and the reason why,

[59:44] if I could see the reason why not doing a number is that you could make more.

[59:47] You could just stockpile them and then send them out and say they were, these were distributor

[59:53] games.

[59:54] They were ordered before the 31st and you're not locked in, right?

[59:58] If demand is greater than supply up into the 31st, you could always just make more.

[01:00:03] But if you put a number at it, like if all of a sudden there were like 90 people posting

[01:00:08] photos of super early Batman, people would be like, what the fuck, Stern?

[01:00:11] What just happened?

[01:00:13] So I don't know.

[01:00:15] We'll see what happens.

[01:00:16] But let's get to the more volume play because this is the Ellie and the standard of the

[01:00:21] ones that I think most people are curious about.

[01:00:23] So the Ellie is $9,000, right?

[01:00:26] Correct.

[01:00:28] And then the Ellie, you're going to get everything that you typically expect from a Jersey

[01:00:33] Jack game.

[01:00:34] It's going to have the clear coated armor, which is blue.

[01:00:37] It is purple on the collector's edition.

[01:00:40] You're going to get a sheet of Invisiglass, which is a $300 item.

[01:00:43] You're going to get a shaker motor.

[01:00:46] They do have both the limited collector's edition, have light at ramps.

[01:00:50] And then you're going to get some of the, I don't want to say silly stuff, but just

[01:00:54] what has become typical with limited edition games, both with Stern and Jersey Jack.

[01:00:59] And you're going to get to sign certificate with the limited edition.

[01:01:03] You're going to get a copy of the comic book with the collector's edition.

[01:01:05] You're going to get a sign comic book.

[01:01:07] You know, you're going to get Pat Lawler and maybe John Yowell, see the artist and Jack

[01:01:11] signing the comic book.

[01:01:13] And you know what?

[01:01:14] I mean, is that a $3,500 item?

[01:01:16] Of course not.

[01:01:17] But you know what?

[01:01:18] There's people that are going to just enjoy having that and framing it and putting up

[01:01:22] on their wall.

[01:01:23] And there's going to be other things that the collectors are going to get that are going

[01:01:26] to make it a little bit more exclusive.

[01:01:29] You know, financially, they're going to get rad cows for free on the collector's edition.

[01:01:33] That's a $400 item.

[01:01:34] They're going to get a print manual.

[01:01:36] That's signed.

[01:01:37] You know, those are a hundred bucks.

[01:01:39] And again, you know, it adds up.

[01:01:41] It's not, you know, again, we're not talking $3,500 worth of your pain, the premium for

[01:01:45] the exclusivity.

[01:01:46] Wow.

[01:01:47] With that.

[01:01:48] I think that's the best thing to happen to people trying to justify the $3,500.

[01:01:53] If you look at Batman Super-Eli, even next to the Eli of Dildan, and I've said this

[01:02:00] to people, when you put the machines in your head next to each other, you know, Stern's

[01:02:06] got matchbox cars.

[01:02:07] And I'm beginning, I've been giving them shit for this.

[01:02:10] They got matchbox cars in a $5,000 increase in price for the Super-Eli.

[01:02:16] The value I think is there with Dildan.

[01:02:19] Now let's talk about the standard is what?

[01:02:23] $8,000?

[01:02:24] And my name is...

[01:02:25] Right.

[01:02:26] The standard is $8,000.

[01:02:27] So you're going to have $1,000 drop from the limited edition down to the standard.

[01:02:33] And what you're going to lose with the standard.

[01:02:36] And I hate to even use that term because it's all cosmetic.

[01:02:40] You're not losing gameplay features.

[01:02:42] You're not getting, and again, not knocking Stern in any capacity.

[01:02:46] You're not buying a pro model that's missing a field like on Game of Thrones.

[01:02:51] You're not missing a ramp that moves left and right like on what was that Avengers, I

[01:02:59] think, or X-Men.

[01:03:01] Yeah, magnetously.

[01:03:02] Yeah, Stern definitely has the stripped down model.

[01:03:04] This thing is getting played just as good.

[01:03:06] But it's a price as much less for, too.

[01:03:08] I mean, they're not $8,000 either in all fairness.

[01:03:10] But you're getting the same game.

[01:03:12] You're getting the same rules.

[01:03:13] You're getting the same multi-balls.

[01:03:15] You're getting the same mechanisms on the game.

[01:03:18] What you are getting instead of the powder-coated armor, you're getting stainless-steer armor.

[01:03:24] You're not getting a free sheet of Invisiglass.

[01:03:27] Obviously, you can add that on.

[01:03:29] You are getting standard ramps.

[01:03:32] You're not getting the special light at ramps that are on the LE.

[01:03:35] You're not getting a free printed manual.

[01:03:38] That can be purchased extra.

[01:03:40] You're not getting rad cows.

[01:03:42] You're not getting on the limited either.

[01:03:44] That's an upgrade.

[01:03:45] It's really just those few things.

[01:03:48] You're not getting lights on the ramps.

[01:03:50] You're getting the Invisiglass and you're getting stainless steel.

[01:03:54] Maybe missing a couple of extras.

[01:03:56] You're not getting a comic book and a printed manual and some of that sort of stuff.

[01:04:00] The one impressive thing.

[01:04:01] I know it's not a huge ticket item.

[01:04:04] It really just goes to show the mindset of what Jack and obviously Pat Lawler is

[01:04:11] well, are trying to do and why Jack said that these games are the embodiment of what he

[01:04:18] tried to do when he started the company.

[01:04:21] Everybody assumed, including myself, that we're going to have a standard model that was

[01:04:25] rumored last week.

[01:04:27] It's probably going to be 8 grand and we're going to end up losing the Invisiglass to

[01:04:31] Shaker motor, the body armor, and maybe a couple of the little things that are going

[01:04:36] equal $1,000.

[01:04:37] Pretty much, they're going to be in the same exact boat financially with the bill and

[01:04:41] materials, possibly as they were with the limited edition.

[01:04:45] They kept the Shaker motor on the game.

[01:04:48] It's typically a 250-thriathom.

[01:04:50] Obviously, wholesale or whatever they buy them for, it's less than that.

[01:04:55] They chose not to take that off the game and charge people more money if they wanted

[01:05:01] it.

[01:05:02] Jack specifically told me that that was a conversation that him and Pat Lawler had to have and they

[01:05:08] both felt very strongly that the Shaker motor should remain.

[01:05:12] I really think the reason is because I think the rules of the game are going to lend itself

[01:05:18] being the disaster theme and being that there's going to be attacks coming from the disasters

[01:05:24] that are the natural disasters that are happening and also from the corporation behind the storyline

[01:05:30] that the Shaker motor is going to be incorporated.

[01:05:33] Maybe more frequently than we typically would see with a pinball machine where all of a sudden,

[01:05:37] oh boy, I got a multi-ball.

[01:05:38] That's Shaker the game.

[01:05:39] Oh boy, I got a multi-ball.

[01:05:41] That's Shaker the game.

[01:05:42] I think with dialed in, it's going to lend itself to be much more of a part of the game

[01:05:49] when things are happening on the game than in the past.

[01:05:54] Again, I commend them.

[01:05:56] People will push back and say, I'll probably cost them a hundred bucks.

[01:06:02] Maybe you're right, but they still made a decision that they don't want to bastardize

[01:06:08] the game and take things off that make it play differently.

[01:06:10] They want the person buying a standard game having the same playing experience as the

[01:06:16] person buying the limit it is.

[01:06:18] That's held through for all three titles.

[01:06:21] Personally I think that's kind of cool.

[01:06:23] What we saw at Expo this year is the whole market in terms of pricing has shifted up.

[01:06:31] It makes no one's happy happy.

[01:06:34] No one wakes up and says, man, I'm excited.

[01:06:38] The hobby that I like is just everything's 30% more expensive this year.

[01:06:45] That's just the reality.

[01:06:47] We could complain about pricing all day long, but I think what's going to be interesting

[01:06:51] when consumers go to buy their games in 2017 is they're going to have a lot of choices.

[01:06:59] I think for people out there, when they see what they're getting for 9,000 for dialed

[01:07:04] in, I know people are saying, Walsh was 65 and Hobbit was 75.

[01:07:08] This is too expensive.

[01:07:10] Alien, another PIM that was revealed at Expo.

[01:07:13] If you start adding up the features, the LCD, this and that, that PIM's $9,000.

[01:07:19] We're shipping in everything with all the goodies put in it.

[01:07:23] I think it's going to be really interesting.

[01:07:25] Batman 66 is $10,000.

[01:07:26] What's the big Lebowski?

[01:07:28] $10,000.

[01:07:29] The big Lebowski is $10,000.

[01:07:30] It's all shifted there.

[01:07:33] I think a lot of people are just going to be upset because new in box for them is just

[01:07:40] not going to be in the cards moving forward.

[01:07:43] There's still going to be a large amount of people that can afford this game.

[01:07:49] I think the game is going to keep getting more and more popular as people play it.

[01:07:54] I played it.

[01:07:56] I would say the one criticism I think that's going to come from people is that the ball

[01:07:59] times can be long if you're good.

[01:08:02] That's okay.

[01:08:03] I think for these games that end up in people's homes, we saw the flip side of that, which

[01:08:07] is like Ghostbusters and your balls over in five seconds.

[01:08:13] Do you have any, are you just guys 100% optimistic?

[01:08:16] Do you still have some concerns, Joe, about this game's ability to do well in the marketplace?

[01:08:24] Walk us through your mindset between now and when the game ships.

[01:08:28] Also, when does the game in your mind come out?

[01:08:31] They keep saying second quarter of 2017, which obviously is April through June.

[01:08:40] The one positive thing I can tell you is that I have absolutely no doubt that that will

[01:08:46] happen.

[01:08:47] When they started shipping, let me put it this way, with the investor team and management

[01:08:56] team now that's Ed Jersey Jack.

[01:09:00] You have people there now.

[01:09:03] Jack doesn't have to do everything and he'll be the first to admit it.

[01:09:06] Jack doesn't have to handle sales.

[01:09:09] Jack doesn't have to handle every vendor.

[01:09:11] Jack doesn't have to handle production.

[01:09:13] There's different people now that are doing different aspects.

[01:09:17] I believe there's a full-time person that just handles vendors and making sure that parts

[01:09:21] are ordered three months in advance so that when December comes and they're planning on

[01:09:27] making 150 or however many hobbits that month that the parts are there for that.

[01:09:35] They've matured to the point that they have people there doing specific jobs and not

[01:09:43] having one individual in Jack and admiring for everything he's done, having every single

[01:09:50] hat and do every single thing.

[01:09:52] What I can tell you is that they started shipping the hobbit in April and they really have

[01:09:59] not stopped since.

[01:10:01] I know there was a short period of time where they were waiting on some extra smog heads

[01:10:06] and they were still making playfields and if people were at the facility in September

[01:10:15] when they had the open house, there were playfields made covered up in plastic that were finished

[01:10:24] waiting to go on the line.

[01:10:26] Pretty much continuing to roll games off consistently.

[01:10:31] All of my pre-orders, which to me was remarkable, given the experience that we had with Wiz

[01:10:37] of the Baws, were even when production started, we would get games in very small numbers.

[01:10:45] I was getting allotments of 10, 15 games a time with the hobbit and satisfying a lot of

[01:10:52] our pre-order customers.

[01:10:53] I had most of my pre-order customers taken care of in July and we now have games in stock

[01:11:00] and that's because they really have been full steam ahead when they started production.

[01:11:06] Jack has told me that parts for dialed in have already been ordered, possibly some parts

[01:11:12] are already coming in.

[01:11:15] This is six months ahead of time.

[01:11:18] You saw how polished the game was and production ready looking and not just a prototype or a white

[01:11:25] wood and all the final artwork is there, all the final mechanisms were there.

[01:11:31] They had five games, not just one.

[01:11:34] I have no doubt that when April comes, you're going to start seeing dialed in coming off

[01:11:40] the production line in April or May or during those course of a couple months window that

[01:11:46] they've given us.

[01:11:47] The other reason is that the license for the hobbit expires at the end of this year and

[01:11:54] there is a window of maybe more months into 2017 that the hobbit will continue to be in production.

[01:12:08] They probably will continue to make the Wizard of Oz.

[01:12:10] The second line is up now and they are making the Wizard of Oz quote unquote for the Christmas

[01:12:15] season.

[01:12:16] But come end of first quarter, second quarter next year, they're going to need to make a pinball

[01:12:23] machine and that pinball machine that they're going to make is dialed in.

[01:12:25] So trust me, it's going to be full steam ahead.

[01:12:29] All hands on deck that may put in dialed in production.

[01:12:33] This isn't going to be any nine month, 12 month pre-order wait until the game starts getting

[01:12:39] made.

[01:12:41] Again, not seeing it from a sales perspective, but total confidence in what I know and how

[01:12:49] I've seen the company breed of late, that's going to happen.

[01:12:54] We all hope so.

[01:12:55] Nobody I think is rooting against them getting the games out in a timely manner.

[01:13:01] I think it's going to be a really interesting 2017 for sure.

[01:13:06] As I've been recommending to everybody on the podcast, personally when people email

[01:13:12] me, I tell people, hold on to your money and wait to the middle of 2017.

[01:13:18] There are going to be so many great options, I think for consumers in this hobby to figure

[01:13:24] out which machine excites them the most.

[01:13:29] Let's talk about, and I've been given this word some grief Joe, but these launch parties

[01:13:35] that happened months before the game is launched.

[01:13:38] The marketer me cringes a little bit that we use language that is a little bit presumptuous

[01:13:44] shall we say.

[01:13:46] When can people get a chance to jump on a dialed in soon who didn't get to go to Expo?

[01:13:51] I'm sure that Jack is going to be bringing this game around the country to all the shows.

[01:14:01] I know I've gotten a lot of emails from people.

[01:14:03] I know the Houston show is coming up in a couple of weeks.

[01:14:06] I have a number of customers in Texas and they're asking if the show would be there.

[01:14:10] I had some customers in California ask if it was going to be at the PPE show coming up

[01:14:17] in a few weeks.

[01:14:19] That I don't know.

[01:14:20] I know those five games were split, two of them went to Jersey, three of them are still

[01:14:27] in Chicago and obviously they're going to be utilized by the design team.

[01:14:31] These games at some point are going to have to go to UL for approval.

[01:14:36] It happens where the games aren't always going to be available for every single show.

[01:14:42] I think Jack is going to do his best to travel and get to as many shows and get the games.

[01:14:50] It really depends on distributors as well as far as how active and aggressive they want

[01:14:57] to be.

[01:14:58] I had a date reserved of November 5th just about two weeks that I'm going to have Jack

[01:15:05] in attendance and we're going to have the dialed in game at Bill Disney's pinball gallery

[01:15:11] which is a suburb.

[01:15:13] It's in Malvern, Pennsylvania which is a suburb of Philadelphia.

[01:15:16] It's going to be a great location.

[01:15:17] We're going to be able to get people all over the big state of Pennsylvania, Delaware,

[01:15:22] Jersey, Maryland.

[01:15:23] I'm sure we'll get some people from Virginia, New York driving distances to come play

[01:15:27] at.

[01:15:28] It's a big facility, at least my event.

[01:15:33] It's a big facility and I always try to find locations like that.

[01:15:37] I've had them at some other locations and I even had launch parties at my own home and

[01:15:42] opened up my collection to customers and friends when it was the Wizard of Oz.

[01:15:49] Obviously, I'm limited.

[01:15:51] Pinball galleries got 60, 70 pinball machines there.

[01:15:55] Some people are playing dialed in.

[01:15:56] They can walk away for 15 minutes and still be entertained and have some fun or go get

[01:16:00] some food and come back and watch or play the game.

[01:16:05] The term launch party, I'm guilty of it.

[01:16:08] We had a Hobbit launch party in March of 2015 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

[01:16:17] Then I had another one in June of 2016.

[01:16:23] We didn't launch anything in 2015.

[01:16:26] But I didn't know that.

[01:16:27] We were all hoping the game was going to come out in a couple months at that point.

[01:16:30] Call them preview parties and everyone is honest.

[01:16:35] I'll just give whatever.

[01:16:36] You give me a name.

[01:16:37] I'll give you an email if you want to come.

[01:16:41] My email addresses sales at pinballstar.com and we're going to call it whatever canada

[01:16:46] tells us to call it.

[01:16:47] It's going to be a preview party.

[01:16:49] We're going to hold it to that.

[01:16:51] It's going to be called the canada's epic.

[01:16:52] It's an epic pinball party.

[01:16:55] Let me answer your question.

[01:16:56] As a distributor, you don't carry any stern pinballs.

[01:17:03] Is that just because of your friendship with Jack or have you ever considered carrying

[01:17:07] stern machines?

[01:17:10] You seem to have half of the available companies out there that you're distributing.

[01:17:17] Is it just capacity?

[01:17:18] What's the reason for the companies you've selected to distribute for?

[01:17:21] That's a good question.

[01:17:23] I started out with Jack and maybe at that point, I really just had no, I don't want to say

[01:17:30] I didn't have any interesting stern, but we just had such a great product with the Wizard

[01:17:36] of Oz in terms of sales that frankly, I did this because of Jack and because of the Wizard

[01:17:46] of Oz.

[01:17:47] I wasn't just trying to choose my words carefully here.

[01:17:52] It wasn't just the same old pinball machine.

[01:17:55] You believed in it.

[01:17:57] I believed in it.

[01:17:58] I did.

[01:17:59] That's a good word.

[01:18:00] My mind didn't go there, which stern, and then since then, we're spooky pinballs only

[01:18:08] distributor, which I'm proud of.

[01:18:13] That kind of came out of really, it was just a friendship.

[01:18:20] I did some advertising on Charlie's podcast and for probably about two years, we had a segment

[01:18:27] on his podcast where I would bring people.

[01:18:31] We called it a quirkening.

[01:18:34] We called it the pinball star of the month and what I would do is bring somebody in the

[01:18:38] hobby on as a guest.

[01:18:40] You just said it was interesting for your podcast to have a distributor on.

[01:18:45] I would do the same thing.

[01:18:46] I would have a repair check on and we would vote what a repair tech does.

[01:18:53] I'd have, Jim Schelberg from Pinggame Journal and he would talk about what it's like to make

[01:19:01] a magazine related to the hobby and stuff like that.

[01:19:05] I told Charlie, obviously it's a small company starting out with America's most honoured.

[01:19:10] I said, Charlie, let me sell them.

[01:19:14] It's not even about the money.

[01:19:15] I said, but let me help you sell them.

[01:19:18] You're in the Midwest.

[01:19:19] You're not going to come to Allentown.

[01:19:21] You're not going to go to Pittsburgh.

[01:19:23] You're not going to go to New York show.

[01:19:24] You're not going to do parties and have people, somebody wants to play America's most honoured

[01:19:31] and there's not a show for six months to come to my house.

[01:19:34] I don't play my game.

[01:19:35] Hang out for a couple hours and stuff like that.

[01:19:38] We did that and it wasn't even a financial relationship.

[01:19:44] Even though obviously I made a little bit of a commission on the games that we helped

[01:19:48] sell for him, but it was more me admiring, similar to Jack, me admiring that this guy decided

[01:19:56] to start a pinball company.

[01:19:57] He's a sounds and he did it and he's a great individual.

[01:20:01] I have a lot of respect for him.

[01:20:03] I love his family and how much passion he has for the hobby and he was adamant about

[01:20:09] making a low price game in the $5,000, $6,000 range and being able to make a game that

[01:20:16] people can afford and he still holds true to that.

[01:20:21] As a result of that, obviously when he got popular and America's most honoured sold

[01:20:26] out and then Rob Zombie sold out, then every Johnny come lately now wanting to be part

[01:20:32] of the Spooky team.

[01:20:35] Charlie said, we don't need anybody else.

[01:20:38] We got Joe and he's done a really good job for us and that was kind of cool.

[01:20:43] What Spooky was relationship driven, we represent Chicago gaming and do their products which are

[01:20:48] arcade legends and Pac-Man video game stuff.

[01:20:52] We represent planetary pinball.

[01:20:55] Obviously Chicago gaming is their production arm of making the remakes, the medieval madness

[01:21:01] remake and the soon to be announced second remake.

[01:21:05] Then this past year we developed a relationship with Brad Baker at VP camps, the maker of the

[01:21:13] virtual pinball machines, the wizard full size model.

[01:21:17] They do the mini and then the very popular Vertigo which is the upright machine that

[01:21:24] plays both video games and pinball machines.

[01:21:29] We got a little bit of everybody, when you come see a booth that pinball star does,

[01:21:35] I'm not one of these distributors that's going to have one wizard of Oz and one hobbit

[01:21:40] and wait in line for 30 minutes.

[01:21:43] All the shows that I did this year, I had four hobbits opened up and every game that

[01:21:49] I opened, boom, I lose 500 bucks on them probably because I have to sell them even though

[01:21:54] they're brain when they're getting played for a couple days.

[01:21:57] I typically have 30 to 45 games opened and makes me feel good to do that for the community.

[01:22:06] I'm supporting the shows and I think it builds some good will.

[01:22:10] I know I make sales because of it.

[01:22:12] People come up to me and say, I see how you work your ass off and you're bringing so

[01:22:18] much stuff and having such a huge booth and stuff like that.

[01:22:21] I got away from your question.

[01:22:23] Your question was about Stern and Tanshure question very simply.

[01:22:26] I'm very good friends with in the state of Pennsylvania, I'm very good friends with Michael

[01:22:32] Pupo from Flipper Fidelity, very good friends with Chris and Melissa at CoinTaker and even

[01:22:40] outside of that realm.

[01:22:42] I'm good friends with other Stern distributors around the country and they've got a lot

[01:22:48] of them.

[01:22:49] Right, right.

[01:22:50] I wasn't going to approach, I know everybody doesn't do this but there's two really good

[01:23:02] Stern distributors within an hour driving distance of me and it doesn't mean squat because

[01:23:07] everybody sells nationwide but my friendship with these folks meant a little bit more than

[01:23:13] I said.

[01:23:14] I think it's admirable too, Joe, that just based upon your friendship in loyalty with Jack

[01:23:19] and your relationship with spooky too.

[01:23:23] That's all the answer you need to give around.

[01:23:25] I think it's great.

[01:23:26] I think that you're focusing your dedication to those brands is phenomenal.

[01:23:32] Let's talk a little bit about community because we're reaching the hour and a half point

[01:23:38] where people get ants in my podcast.

[01:23:43] I did want to talk about and let you talk about the great work you do with the community

[01:23:49] and the charitable work to get pinball machines into children's hospitals.

[01:23:56] Can you give us just a sort of like a background on how you got into that and what you guys

[01:24:03] have done to date and just so people who, if they want to get involved, what they can

[01:24:09] look for in supporting that great cause?

[01:24:12] Sure.

[01:24:13] I mean, long story short, I have a disabled son who is now 22 years old and when my son

[01:24:23] was both born and after throughout his whole life, honestly, he's been spent time in children's

[01:24:30] hospitals, be it for surgeries, doctors appointments, typically we would visit hospital down

[01:24:41] in Philadelphia, St. Christopher's and to our drive.

[01:24:47] It's a hardship.

[01:24:48] It's a hardship when you have a child and there's a disability involved and a lot of work

[01:24:55] involved and struggles emotionally and personally just dealing with that.

[01:25:03] I was in the hobby a few years when he was born and a little neat little side light.

[01:25:11] I'm in the hobby because of my son.

[01:25:15] I've always loved, I was probably more of a video game guy growing up.

[01:25:20] I'm 49 now so I grew up, I was a teenager in the 80s in the video game craze.

[01:25:26] Sure I played pinball and I liked pinball but space invaders was my game and then Miss

[01:25:32] Pac-Man was my game.

[01:25:34] I didn't have a pinball game per se.

[01:25:39] I got into the hobby because of my son because my son had to have some surgery on his legs

[01:25:47] for some muscular issues he had and we had a physical therapist that worked with him that

[01:25:51] said he needs to be standing more, he needs to strengthen and lengthen the muscles in his

[01:25:58] legs and you need to find an activity for him to do that he's going to want to stand

[01:26:04] and stand.

[01:26:05] The therapist came up with, hey how about a pinball machine or a video game.

[01:26:11] Back Christmas, keep in mind prices back then in 2004 were, one Christmas I bought three

[01:26:20] pinball machines and that was for my son.

[01:26:24] I bought a twilight zone, a rocky and bowl week on Indiana Jones and I probably paid

[01:26:30] four grand for all three of them.

[01:26:35] So I'm in the hobby because of my son because of that instance and then from there it became

[01:26:43] obviously a hobby for me.

[01:26:46] I enjoyed working on the machines and cleaning them up and trying to fix them and similar

[01:26:52] story and trajectory of everybody in this hobby would go to the shows and then my younger

[01:26:57] son him and I would travel around the country and we would go to tournaments, my younger

[01:27:06] son Patrick actually ended up placing forth in the finals in the junior division at

[01:27:12] Papa two years in a row.

[01:27:16] My kids grew up with pinball and with the charity stuff we'd be at these hospitals and

[01:27:22] I kind of always felt, my son was always able to go home with us.

[01:27:27] Yeah, he's always going to have struggles in life because of his disabilities and stuff

[01:27:30] like that.

[01:27:31] But when you're there you see kids that have cancer and they may not live.

[01:27:39] You see kids that are burn victims and they're always going to be affected by that the

[01:27:43] rest of their life and my son is as well but I always felt like I was cheating to an

[01:27:49] extent that he's got to take my kid out of there and put him in the car at the end of

[01:27:53] the day and drive home again.

[01:27:55] And I always thought man wouldn't it be cool if these kids that were stuck there and not

[01:27:59] only the kids but their siblings.

[01:28:02] When you have a child in a hospital and he's eight years old you can rest assured that

[01:28:08] when the parents are there which is probably all the time that if there's a sibling in

[01:28:13] the family you know that kid is also there spending his time in a hospital and not doing

[01:28:20] what he should be doing.

[01:28:22] A lot of the hospitals have play rooms where they have puzzles and games and Xboxes and

[01:28:29] DVRs or DVD players and stuff that the kids can wheel into their rooms and stuff.

[01:28:34] And I just always stop man you know it kind of I feel a little guilty that you know I've

[01:28:40] got these games in my basement and you know I don't play them every day and they could

[01:28:45] be here in these hospitals and stuff like that.

[01:28:47] So I always had that idea in my head I never shook it and you know fast forward 10 12

[01:28:53] years later when I became a distributor with Jack and you know coupled with the fact that

[01:28:58] the theme was to Wizard of Oz it was a slam dunk like there was no way that I wasn't

[01:29:03] not going to fulfill the idea that I had you know that many years earlier because now

[01:29:09] I had a custom made theme to put in a hospital and I now had the mechanism to raise money

[01:29:16] and you know put these games you know into the hospital.

[01:29:21] So long and short of it when we first started I would put away a couple hundred bucks out

[01:29:26] of every sale out of our profits and and I would you know we created a fund and we would

[01:29:32] put that money from each sale into a fund and I will come in Jack from Jersey Jack as

[01:29:38] well.

[01:29:39] Jack obviously knew my history and knew why I was doing what I did you know the first three

[01:29:44] games that we donated he sold to me well below even my distributor to help me you know

[01:29:52] get those serves my goal faster and then we started doing raffles and that ended up being

[01:29:59] an easier way versus just socking a couple hundred dollars away with every every sale

[01:30:04] or running a tournament you know and you know making maybe two hundred dollars working

[01:30:11] five hours running a tournament you know it was a slow go.

[01:30:14] It took us one full year to raise enough money to buy our first Wizard of Oz new in box

[01:30:19] game and we donated that game to St. Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia where you know my

[01:30:25] son had been a patient for many years and then once we started doing the raffles and

[01:30:31] again the raffle thing dovetailed out of America's most honoured the fact that the game sold

[01:30:38] out and everybody wanted one and here I as a distributor had purchased an allotment you

[01:30:44] know from spooky they were my games that I bought and I decided that I was you know

[01:30:50] well he's blessing that I was going to use these to raise money being that it was a popular

[01:30:56] game and I thought it would be interesting people winning them you know we used America's

[01:31:02] most honoured for a few raffles and from that we were able to raise more money quickly

[01:31:08] and fast forward to today we've actually donated five eight thousand dollar valued pinball

[01:31:16] machines to five different children's hospitals we've got one in St. Christopher's in Philly

[01:31:22] we've got one at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia we've got one in Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh

[01:31:29] which I did as a thank you to the fine friends of mine at the Papa facility you know those guys

[01:31:37] would let me you know they don't and when they run their tournaments they don't typically have

[01:31:42] vendors there but they would let me go and run tournaments side tournaments for five bucks

[01:31:49] a play and we'd raise money that way so I decided my second game I wanted to donate we would

[01:31:55] do in their community and then I actually developed a relationship and friendship with Dan Spolar

[01:32:00] with Project Pinball who pretty much does the same thing that I do on an individual basis

[01:32:06] and you know it just so happened last summer I had raised enough money to donate another game

[01:32:14] but I didn't have a hospital lined up or one that I had and if you know a relationship with

[01:32:20] and I was talking to Dan and there's a lot of work involved you know getting through the red tape

[01:32:25] and administration to give a game to a hospital is crazy it sounds it takes about you know three to

[01:32:32] six months legwork sometimes to to just get to the point of you know getting all the ducks lined up

[01:32:38] to to be able to you know do a donation ceremony and place the game Dan had a few hospitals with

[01:32:45] Project Pinball lined up waiting for games and you know hit you know my advantage is that I had

[01:32:52] access to the games and Dan's advantage you see it access to more hospitals and I had a game

[01:32:58] rated a donate and I told Dan I said Dan I said why am I going to go work for six months to put

[01:33:03] this in a hospital and create a need somewhere when you've already got five hospitals waiting on

[01:33:08] the game so you know I donate it one to Project Pinball and then the last raffle we just did

[01:33:16] at the York show where we raffled off both in America's most haunted and the Rob Zombie

[01:33:22] as a result of that raffle we're donating our fifth Wizard of Oz machine this December

[01:33:28] to a hospital in Long Island so we've got you know two and Philly one in Pittsburgh the first

[01:33:34] Project Pinball machine went to UNC in Chapel Hill North Carolina and our fifth one is going to go

[01:33:40] in December to Long Island New York City so we've got we actually did three machines this year

[01:33:46] which is great fantastic so that's a little bit about what we I mean pretty much as far as

[01:33:52] supporting that obviously we take donations but for the most part you know around the time that

[01:33:58] I do shows I typically will will gear up and do a raffle for a desired game and you know and raise

[01:34:07] the money that way so anybody that has an interest in that we're being involved with it obviously

[01:34:12] when we do our donations you know we love having Pinball people come there and play with the kids

[01:34:20] and explain the games and stuff like that and I think people are very surprised some of you know

[01:34:27] the people in the various cities that come and go to the donations I guess I think they really walk

[01:34:33] away from the event with you know a really good feeling you know even me having done five of these

[01:34:42] so far I was kind of floored you know almost moved to tears to be honest with it the last one we

[01:34:50] did in Philadelphia there was a child there that had a prosthetic leg and he was playing with another

[01:34:58] kid and every time it was his turn he'd jump out of the wheelchair hop over to the game and play

[01:35:04] the Wizard of Oz when his turn was over he would sit back in his chair and you know we let the kids

[01:35:11] play and then you know I'm mingling around the room we're talking to some nurses and some

[01:35:14] administrators from the hospital and and I see this one you know I don't know if she was a nurse

[01:35:20] or a therapist but she she was crying and I went over to her and I said you know what's the matter

[01:35:25] I said you know this is a good day and she said you don't understand she said you know and she

[01:35:30] pointed to the boy she said do you have any idea how hard it is for us to get him out of that chair

[01:35:38] to do therapy to to learn to use his leg his prosthetic leg and she said I've never seen him

[01:35:45] so excited to get out of that chair until you brought that pinball machine in here and

[01:35:49] it really you know like the difference that these things make so you know when guys in our community

[01:35:56] and not just guys but you know people men and women in our community you know pay to buy raffle

[01:36:04] tickets whether it's from me whether it's from our project pinball whether it's from Joseph

[01:36:09] you know Sayid who does the pinball edu which is going to provide pinball machines to kids with

[01:36:16] you know autism you know down in Washington DC you know there's there's there's real you know

[01:36:25] things real effects that are happening from you guys you know taking the chance on winning a pinball

[01:36:31] machine I know you guys want to win the pinball machine but trust me I know you know 90% of the

[01:36:36] people are given the money just because they want to give the money and you know it's just really

[01:36:41] cool it kind of brings for me the hobby full circle because you know I'm in the hobby you know

[01:36:48] because of my son and and then to be able to facilitate as a distributor what we do with the

[01:36:54] children's hospital right it's just really cool it's kind of a fruition of a little idea that's

[01:37:00] stuck in my brain years and years ago and and I'm really happy that I'm able to do what we do

[01:37:05] right and and I think it's absolutely amazing and we definitely applaud all the efforts and for

[01:37:11] those of you out there when you see these raffles go on please contribute to Joe and and support

[01:37:16] the cause I think it's also just healthy to have a selfless part of the hobby right so much of it

[01:37:22] is selfish in a way where we're just always trying to chase after our own toys and have more and

[01:37:29] more of our collections grow and grow but to see the joy these machines bring on kids' faces is

[01:37:36] just amazing especially for kids who can't get out and experience games the way we we all can so

[01:37:43] I think it's great and it's not just us that run these things I mean trust me there's there's

[01:37:48] people in the hobby that come out to our donation ceremonies I've got volunteers as those

[01:37:55] Dan at Project Pinball in each of the communities that we donate a game for the most part that

[01:38:02] pro bono they will go out and service the games and fix them every so many months and change

[01:38:08] rubbers and and just make sure the game is clean so you know there's a lot of good people in this

[01:38:14] hobby even the manufacturers both Jack and and Charlie at spooky and and Stern as well assist

[01:38:21] greatly with Dan at Project Pinball in terms of providing these games to us at at a lower cost

[01:38:28] you know then then we can buy them off the street and also donating prices for raffles and

[01:38:34] and tournaments and all that good stuff so you know and then the people in the community I mean

[01:38:39] you know Kenny I've had you know people that have bought an America's most honoured for me they're

[01:38:46] my customer that I know they have an America's most honoured I've bought like two or three raffle

[01:38:52] tickets and I'll email them I'm like dude what are you doing you you have a game and I know why

[01:38:58] they're doing it they're doing it because they want to give the money you know and that's really

[01:39:03] cool so we got a lot of good people in this hobby I know Pinside and you know gets crazy and

[01:39:09] you know people pissing on about the manufacturers and people argue with each other and sometimes

[01:39:14] it gets a little out of control you lose perspective people lose perspective the most part you know

[01:39:19] you go to a show like Expo and you know there could be a guy there that you were arguing with

[01:39:24] on Pinside and and you know you're gonna you're gonna go play pinball have a beer with them so

[01:39:29] right exactly it's it's it's a good hobby and you know I think we things like this maybe give

[01:39:35] it a little perspective as well that right it's well my last my last my last question Jonah and

[01:39:42] hopefully we'll do this again one day soon um do you have any idea what number four is for Jersey

[01:39:49] Jack I'm and you're not I'm not asking you to reveal it but you know what it's gonna be well how

[01:39:55] about I how about I won up the NLTN what number four and number five are gonna be see now you have

[01:40:01] to do that um I had a plan with that didn't I you're excited so what like and not revealing names but

[01:40:08] do you expect the cadence of these games to increase so we're gonna see games like maybe a new

[01:40:13] whenever he's you know year and a half and we're not we're gonna sort of get shorter windows of

[01:40:18] getting a new Jersey Jack games out yeah absolutely the plan is I could tell you for sure with Jack is

[01:40:26] you know I know he's talked to games a year um you know I he made a mention at Expo during a seminar

[01:40:34] I believe that you know they're obviously is going to be you know a one game a year um you know

[01:40:47] production so 27 we might see another game revealed next um October I I've never I haven't been

[01:40:57] given any dates so I'll preface that that's exciting just if you just look at the production

[01:41:02] schedule I mean they're gonna start making uh you know it's no different than the Hobbit the Hobbit

[01:41:08] started shipping in the spring of this year and the cycle just by virtue of how many games you know

[01:41:13] they pump out and how many games will sell um you know they're gonna run out of uh customers for

[01:41:20] that particular title at some point and and then the next game has to pick up so from a business

[01:41:26] perspective yeah they they have to have the next thing in the lineup ready to go and I could tell you

[01:41:30] that you know the number four and number five uh have been chosen uh you know probably yeah I just

[01:41:40] I just I just hope it's toy story because if it is I will go all in on the collector's edition
