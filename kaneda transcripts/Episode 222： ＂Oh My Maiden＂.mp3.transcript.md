[00:00] Welcome to episode 2, I think 22 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:21] I'm coming at you from Galway, Ireland.

[00:26] It's about 4.30 in the afternoon here, which means I don't have any idea what time it is

[00:32] where you are, but unless you've been living under a rock, there's been a lot of pinball

[00:38] news in the last 48 hours.

[00:40] Everything from the order banks for Alice Cooper's nightmare castle going live on Monday to

[00:48] turn dropping, probably one of their most successful pinball reveals of all time with Iron Maiden.

[00:59] We have to talk about that, and then I'm going to do a little bit about some user mail.

[01:05] I want to talk about the context of these two games coming out back to back like this, and

[01:10] what I think it means for the pinball hobby and for you guys out there who are infactuated

[01:16] with every new pinball game that comes out.

[01:19] Now let's talk first about Iron Maiden, because this thing was like the worst kept secret

[01:25] in pinball history.

[01:27] It was titanium man a couple weeks ago at TPS, and now we finally got to see Iron Maiden,

[01:35] Zombielli, Keith L. Wins, Masterpiece.

[01:39] I'm calling it a Masterpiece, revealed to the world on Tuesday.

[01:44] It was a little bit funny the way the reveal happened.

[01:46] A lot of people were expecting it to be on Rolling Stone, but here's what happened.

[01:51] I don't know if you guys know this.

[01:53] Stern had it set up as a Rolling Stone exclusive, and then Rolling Stone stopped getting back

[01:59] to them.

[02:00] It was like they didn't know whether or not they were going to go live, and they had to

[02:04] go live, because that's what they were supposed to do.

[02:08] They went to Plan B, which was give the assets to IGN, IGN put up the stuff immediately,

[02:14] and then Rolling Stone immediately followed after.

[02:17] That happens in the world of public relations, where sometimes you get ghosted by the journalist

[02:22] who's supposed to be setting up the exclusive for you, and you have to quickly call an audible.

[02:28] But it doesn't matter.

[02:29] No one really cares where they get this information from.

[02:32] All they care about is that they get the information.

[02:34] Stern didn't just give us what the game looks like in the pro model.

[02:38] They also surprised everybody with a special Jack Danger Twitch stream of him and Keith

[02:47] playing the game at 330 in the afternoon, right in the middle of the work week, which was

[02:54] kind of incredible too, because usually we have to wait days to get footage of what the

[02:59] game play is like.

[03:00] So where do I start?

[03:02] Where do I start with this game?

[03:04] You guys know probably all there is to know about the game.

[03:07] So I'm not going to rehash all the different features and what's in the game and this and

[03:11] that.

[03:12] What I want to do is tackle it for more of the macro things that I think you guys are

[03:15] feeling with this launch.

[03:17] First and foremost, let's start out with the artwork, because Zambiyeti, once again,

[03:23] from Zidware fame to actually Ghostbusters acclaim to now creating what I believe to be Stern's

[03:32] greatest art package on a pinball machine to date.

[03:35] And that's not to take anything away, but I think he dethroned Dirty Donny's Aerospace

[03:40] Art Package, which up until this day, I think, had the most detail in any game.

[03:46] And again, nothing against Christopher Franchi.

[03:49] These guys are all amazing and they all have different styles.

[03:52] But I really, really liked what Zambiyeti did with this game.

[03:56] And I love the fact that it's a music pin that doesn't feature the band members all over

[04:02] the game.

[04:03] In fact, they're not even on the play field anywhere.

[04:06] So it really is more about the universe of Iron Maiden versus the band Iron Maiden.

[04:12] And I think that allowed Yeti to have a lot more fun.

[04:15] Now we'll know for sure because he's supposed to be a guest on this show, hopefully, sometime

[04:19] next week when I come back from Ireland.

[04:22] And you've heard him on this show before.

[04:24] We always have a good conversation.

[04:26] I do know that making this game wasn't the easiest thing for him.

[04:31] And there was probably a lot of back and forth because Iron Maiden is such a protected

[04:35] license.

[04:36] And he probably can't go into too much detail on what some of those struggles were.

[04:41] But I think when we look at the final package, does this look like a game where they had

[04:45] to make any compromises in the artwork in this game?

[04:49] Right?

[04:50] I mean, we used to hear all the excuses about all the alien artwork has to be this because

[04:54] of the license, sir.

[04:55] All right.

[04:56] It looks like a compromise game, alien.

[04:59] Does this look compromise?

[05:00] Absolutely not.

[05:01] Absolutely incredible.

[05:02] And the best is yet to come because we've only seen the pro version of the game.

[05:08] Now we know that the L.E. version and the premiums have yet to be shown.

[05:13] And again, I think that's just because of the license, sir.

[05:16] I think they're just waiting to get final approval on all the images and assets and whatnot.

[05:20] Believe me, I tried.

[05:21] I tried all my sources that I have within Stern to get any, any indication of what those

[05:27] might look like.

[05:29] But here's the thing.

[05:30] Here's the crazy part.

[05:31] I think we're back to the error where Stern doesn't even need to show you the L.E. to

[05:37] sell out of the limited edition.

[05:40] Now there's only going to be 500.

[05:42] I know.

[05:43] I use the word only loosely.

[05:46] I do think 4 to 500 should always be the maximum number of L.E. machines.

[05:52] But here's what I'm hearing.

[05:53] I'm hearing, and we always hear this, like 250 are going to go overseas or maybe even

[05:57] more going to go overseas, which means much less for the US market.

[06:02] I'm pretty much hearing that they're sold out.

[06:04] I think most distributors have their allocations spoken for.

[06:10] So if you want an L.E. iron made in, I think you might be at a lock.

[06:14] I never quite believe the numbers of how many are going overseas.

[06:19] I think Stern probably does use that as a little bit of a marketing tactic to be like,

[06:24] for making 500 and 499 are going to Europe.

[06:28] So good luck.

[06:29] And then there's like this rush to try and get one in the US.

[06:33] But what does that mean that we are back to Stern selling out of a machine before people

[06:39] even see it?

[06:40] The only other times we saw this happen was with Batman, was with Ghostbusters.

[06:47] Remember those two games they were all spoken for?

[06:50] It didn't happen with Star Wars because of the amount of L.E.s they made.

[06:55] I mean Star Wars L.E. was easy to get even after it was launched.

[06:58] But I don't think you're going to have quite the same luck with this game.

[07:02] What does it mean to that we are buying something without even seeing it?

[07:07] I think it goes to show that the hobby is alive and well, that people who collect pinball

[07:13] machines are crazy mofos who don't really need much more than a game that looks great

[07:20] and a game that shoots great and a game that has a decent theme at least that they're

[07:25] into.

[07:26] So I think what's interesting to me about this game.

[07:28] And if I step back and look at it objectively, I think the art package is out of this world.

[07:34] I think L.W.N.'s Archer game, which has been retrofitted to become Iron Maiden, is also

[07:39] incredible.

[07:40] We've seen the game shoot before.

[07:41] We've seen the game shoot on the Twitch stream and it shoots great.

[07:45] I'm not going to go into all the shots and all the jazz and all the bells and whistles.

[07:49] But Iron Maiden for me is the interesting part because as much as I love the art, as

[07:54] much as I love the pinball aspects of the game, I still can't tell you a single Iron Maiden

[08:02] song.

[08:03] I'm just not a fan.

[08:04] Now, I'm not going to be one of these idiots who says, well, that means it's not going

[08:08] to do well because any Google search or Wikipedia search on Iron Maiden will show you that this

[08:15] band has sold something like 100 million albums worldwide.

[08:20] So this is not a little wrinky dink sort of new artist here.

[08:26] These guys are juggernauts.

[08:29] They're just not my juggernauts.

[08:30] They're not as mainstream as Metallica or Guns and Roses or ACDC or even Aerosmith in

[08:38] America, but they have a huge fanbase.

[08:41] And again, remember 100 million albums sold, 500 LE's.

[08:49] Do the math.

[08:50] Do the math, all right?

[08:52] Imagine if even just a fraction of those people were into arcade and pinball machines, there's

[08:57] not enough to satiate the fanbase of a band like Iron Maiden, all right?

[09:03] So look, I think I was joking with a friend.

[09:06] I think, you know, this is like how it goes for three days.

[09:09] Day number one, when a new game is revealed, the hype train leaves the station and everyone

[09:14] goes bonkers, ape shit and just praises it.

[09:16] They praise Stern, all the negative stuff they say about Stern gets forgotten immediately

[09:21] and everyone's padding everyone on the back, right?

[09:23] You see it on social media.

[09:25] You know, everyone's like, hey, great job.

[09:26] Hey, thank you.

[09:27] Hey, great job.

[09:28] Hey, great job.

[09:29] Day two, I think everyone wakes up and realizes, you know what?

[09:34] I don't even know an Iron Maiden song.

[09:36] Day three, everyone's like, well, what's the next pin from Stern?

[09:39] Right, there's like this window of hype.

[09:42] But look, I mean, we all know this.

[09:44] And I think Stern did a great job of sort of unleashing a lot in one day for people to

[09:51] make up their mind on.

[09:52] I mean, in one day, they gave you, I think, enough to go.

[09:55] And now here's the problem, though.

[09:57] The Twitch stream was great.

[09:59] I mean, it was really, really good.

[10:01] They did what I've been asking them to do for a while, which is take the glass off and

[10:06] walk people through the game and show them some of the features.

[10:08] Now I was a little worried when I was watching the stream because I do think Keith showed

[10:14] a little bit too much.

[10:15] And what I mean by that is, I want to buy a pinball machine for $8,000,000.

[10:21] And I want to be surprised and delighted with what happens as you go through the modes.

[10:27] And when you enter a wizard mode for the first time and when you complete things for the

[10:31] first time, I don't want to experience what happens in the game for the first time because

[10:37] the designer is hitting switches with their finger.

[10:40] I think he showed a little bit too much.

[10:42] Now I know there's more to come.

[10:44] It's a little small gripe, but that was just something that I noticed on the stream.

[10:47] I was like, stop, stop.

[10:49] No more.

[10:50] Let us figure it out when we play the game.

[10:53] But here's the thing.

[10:54] After they did the stream, it wasn't available online afterwards.

[10:59] So it wasn't archived anywhere.

[11:02] So the only other place you could probably go get more information is probably coast to

[11:07] coast pinball and nature's interviewed Keith L. Win.

[11:10] So you should check that out.

[11:11] It's about a half hour interview.

[11:12] Lots of good stuff there.

[11:15] But right now, there's hardly anything.

[11:18] I think someone uploaded an Instagram of gameplay footage.

[11:21] But we know the game shoots great.

[11:23] We know the game shoots great.

[11:25] The isn't the pro packed with stuff.

[11:28] I think once again, Stern is proving that for the money, for the money, you cannot get

[11:35] more value than what you get with a Stern pro.

[11:38] It's just that simple.

[11:40] I think this game is going to send some shockwaves through the industry.

[11:45] Now explain what I mean by that.

[11:47] I think the pro is going to hurt other manufacturers' abilities to sell their games for more when

[11:52] those games come with less.

[11:54] That's just a reality.

[11:55] The other thing that I hope indicates that we've turned to corner here is the amount of

[12:01] stuff Stern is now putting in the limited edition game.

[12:06] You are basically getting the kinds of stuff Stern reserved for Batman Super Ellie.

[12:13] You are now getting that stuff for the price of a regular limited edition machine.

[12:18] You are getting stuff like the upgraded JBL speakers.

[12:22] You're getting the shaker.

[12:23] You're getting the anti-reflective glass.

[12:26] You are getting real translate back glass.

[12:31] You are getting the metallic decals that are like the Batman SLE decals on the side of

[12:38] the cabinet.

[12:39] You're getting a lot for your money.

[12:43] I think that's a great thing.

[12:44] I think when people look at all you're getting in this machine next to Star Wars Ellie,

[12:50] it's almost embarrassingly bad to compare the two how little Star Wars Ellie gave you.

[12:56] I've been saying it from the very get go.

[12:58] I thought Star Wars Ellie clearly all the money went to the license and everything else

[13:02] was like a bomb cutting corner to get you something because they spent so much on Star Wars.

[13:09] This is just me speculating.

[13:12] Here's a thing.

[13:13] I think this game is jam packed.

[13:17] I don't know if we're going to see games come this jam packed moving forward for the

[13:21] same amount of money.

[13:23] Here's why.

[13:24] Archer was already developed.

[13:27] Stern usually spends a few hundred thousand dollars developing their pinball machines to

[13:34] get them ready for market.

[13:36] Because the majority of the design and development had happened already on this game with Archer,

[13:42] I just think it was probably a little bit more affordable for Stern to put more in the

[13:50] game.

[13:51] That's me speculating.

[13:52] I'm probably going to get an email from some people over there saying I'm wrong, but

[13:56] I think that's what happened.

[13:58] That's a good thing.

[13:59] You as the buyer will get a product with more in it.

[14:05] I also saw Keith uploaded a photo where the rails underneath the plate field are going

[14:10] back to the normal rails, not the cheap peg rail system that we've been getting in the

[14:16] Stern machines recently.

[14:18] Does this mean that Stern is now going to jam pack their L.E.'s sort of the way Jersey

[14:22] Jack Pinball does?

[14:24] I hope so.

[14:25] I hope this is a new, I hope they've heard the cries of people that if I'm going to buy

[14:31] a limited edition, you need to put everything in it.

[14:34] I don't have to then go buy the anti-reflective glass.

[14:39] It's just also in this L.E.

[14:41] You get a lot for the money.

[14:43] You get a lot for the money.

[14:44] You guys are also a bunch of crazy bastards.

[14:47] It's already sold out and you've never seen it.

[14:49] You don't even know if the artwork could be like, it could be a hand drawn artwork of

[14:55] Jared holding the British flag for all we know.

[14:58] I don't know.

[14:59] It's going to be amazing.

[15:00] I think Yeti knows better than anyone.

[15:04] You make the L.E. special.

[15:06] How special he made Ghostbusters.

[15:08] I'm fully anticipating that to be the case for Iron Maiden.

[15:12] It's a good day.

[15:13] It was a good day.

[15:14] I think it was a very positive day.

[15:16] These days when we see something that exceeds our expectations, it reminds everyone.

[15:23] Deep down inside, that part of your body where your soul lives, your pinball soul lives,

[15:29] it reminds you why you love this hobby.

[15:31] For the excitement you get, you feel like a little kid on Christmas morning.

[15:36] Seeing a toy for the first time.

[15:39] That's good news.

[15:41] Speaking about how does this impact the rest of the market?

[15:45] This has to have somewhat of an impact on Charlie's ability to sell Alice Cooper's

[15:51] Nightmare Castle.

[15:53] From what I can tell, Charlie had a good day Monday.

[15:57] Sales were great.

[15:58] I think he got a lot of orders of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[16:02] I saw people sharing their order number.

[16:05] For some reason, they're like years.

[16:06] I've got 1987 and I've got 2010.

[16:09] So interesting that they're doing it that way.

[16:11] They're making 500 and I don't know how many he has sold in total.

[16:16] I don't think he'll reveal that number.

[16:18] I don't think it's to any advantage of his to reveal his sales numbers.

[16:22] I don't think anybody really does.

[16:24] I think he would tell us if they were sold out.

[16:27] I don't think they sold all 500 on Monday.

[16:31] It's interesting to me.

[16:33] If you're a pinball buyer and you knew that Alice Cooper order banks were opening up

[16:39] on Monday and you also knew that Stern was going to reveal Iron Maiden on Tuesday.

[16:46] We knew both of this stuff by Sunday night that you wouldn't just wait until Tuesday to

[16:54] make up your mind on where to spend your money.

[16:57] If you're like a lot of guys out there, money is no object in the world of pinball, you

[17:02] could go in and bowl no problem.

[17:05] But the spooky having the non-refundable ordering system in place, it makes it a little bit

[17:12] dicey here because you either have to commit or find someone to buy your spot.

[17:18] These two are going to battle it out.

[17:20] They're apples to oranges and games.

[17:23] I did find it.

[17:26] I saw Charlie uploaded a Facebook post congratulating Stern and Keith and everyone on Iron Maiden.

[17:34] I think that's indicative of this hobby.

[17:37] I work for some major companies.

[17:40] I work for some major companies who would never ever in a million years congratulate a

[17:45] competitor on a product.

[17:48] Coca-Cola would never say, hey, congrats Pepsi on Pepsi perfect.

[17:52] My Chevy clients would never be like, hey, Dodge, the demons are great car.

[17:57] Verizon would never congratulate T-Mobile on a wonderful promotion.

[18:01] I think it's indicative of how small this hobby is that no matter who's in it from a company

[18:09] standpoint, they all sort of are championing each other and applauding each other's work.

[18:16] Now I'll say this though.

[18:17] I'll say this when I read that from Charlie.

[18:20] My company was like, I don't know, man, I kind of think Stern still sees every dollar

[18:28] as competition that doesn't go to them.

[18:32] Does it help Stern to have other companies in business in Pimbal?

[18:36] I feel to see how it really does.

[18:39] It makes their products better.

[18:41] Of course, competition will make them raise the bar.

[18:45] But I doubt you'll ever see Stern's people.

[18:50] George Gomez, Gary Stern, I doubt you'll ever see them congratulating a competitor on

[18:56] a new product.

[18:57] I just don't ever think you'll see them do that.

[19:00] In fact, when I asked George what his favorite game was, it was total nuclear annihilation

[19:04] before it was a production game.

[19:06] I'd be curious to see if anyone over there would ever say anything nice about the competitors.

[19:12] But that's spooky's M.O. and I think it's a breath of fresh air.

[19:19] But I also, as a businessman, sometimes think they're a little bit, how do I say this?

[19:27] I don't think these companies are competing.

[19:30] I really don't.

[19:31] I don't think they're all in it to celebrate each other's work.

[19:35] I think they'd be foolish because we all know how hard it is to make money and survive

[19:40] in Pimbal.

[19:42] Let me zoom out a little bit now.

[19:45] It's been a great week for Pimbal.

[19:47] It's been a great week for you Pimbal buyers and collectors out there.

[19:50] You now have two very, very cool new options of where to spend your money.

[19:58] What does this mean for the rest of the manufacturers out there?

[20:01] Does Iron Maiden's Reveal, does that hurt anyone else out in the marketplace?

[20:06] Does Alice Cooper's Reveal hurt anyone else out in the marketplace?

[20:11] I do think these two new titles are not the best news for American Pimbal.

[20:19] I think selling Houdini with these games coming out is going to be harder, not easier.

[20:27] I think that's just the way it's going to be.

[20:29] I think there's only a finite amount of money that people can spend.

[20:34] When you put games next to each other, they each have their pros and cons.

[20:38] It's really, really hard to put an Iron Maiden pro next to Houdini.

[20:46] You still get a lot in the pro now.

[20:49] Houdini is jam-packed, but it's more expensive.

[20:52] I forgot to mention one thing about Iron Maiden.

[20:55] I usually am better at staying focused on a topic at a time.

[21:00] The one criticism I keep seeing with Iron Maiden, and I want to bring this up.

[21:04] The one criticism I keep seeing is the LCD integration of the game.

[21:10] The LCD integration, the criticism seems to be that it's kind of disjointed, that you've

[21:15] got all different sorts of visuals going on with different fonts, and it doesn't seem

[21:20] to be cohesive at all.

[21:22] Clearly, the art and the animations that are in that game were not done by Zombielli or

[21:28] Stern programmers.

[21:29] In fact, I think all those animations come from an Iron Maiden app game that is out there.

[21:37] They lifted those from that.

[21:40] That is why we're seeing what we're seeing.

[21:41] When I first saw it, I was like, wow, these are really cool.

[21:44] Stern did a really amazing job with the animations.

[21:47] I had no idea these came from another source.

[21:50] Again, I think Stern is still learning what to do with the LCD.

[21:55] I do think every game seems to be an LCD guessing game for them.

[22:01] They just can't seem to get it right.

[22:03] How much is enough animation to be up there?

[22:06] How much is too much?

[22:09] How do we present the score in a way that's not too confusing?

[22:13] How do we make it cohesive so it also feels like an extension of the artwork that's on

[22:17] the play field and on the cabinet?

[22:19] I will still say this.

[22:21] I still think the best LCD integration to date on any of the new Stern LCD machines without

[22:27] a doubt is Batman.

[22:29] Go play a Batman and look at how they did it.

[22:32] Even the way they framed the video clips in the old school TV, even the way all the fonts

[22:37] are like the Batman fonts, the power, the wham, the bam, when the scoring goes up there.

[22:43] When they write the text, it's in that comic book style, Batman font.

[22:48] It all feels very cohesive.

[22:50] It all feels very Batman 66.

[22:53] I think in the other game, like Star Wars, the whole thing is just like a confusing mess

[22:58] up on the screen.

[22:59] I can't even talk about that game.

[23:01] The second best one is Erasmith, where they did their own animations.

[23:05] Again, the style looked just like the game you were playing and it was very cohesive.

[23:11] I think Stern has a ways to go.

[23:13] I think they need to hire more LCD programmers to figure out how to make the LCD feel like

[23:20] it's part of the game.

[23:22] People have said this and I'll say it.

[23:24] Jersey Jack's integration between the LCD and the game itself is phenomenal and they

[23:29] spend a lot of time making it that way.

[23:32] There's a lot of cost and development time involved in making it that way.

[23:36] Kudos to Jack for probably delivering the best LCD integration.

[23:42] I think it might be a little too big.

[23:44] I think it's too big up there to really see it all happening in front of you.

[23:50] I think it's not great news for American Pimble.

[23:53] I also think, again, this is just my speculation from a marketing standpoint.

[24:00] I think Pirates of the Caribbean, shifting all the way to August, is really, really bad

[24:09] news for Jersey Jack and the timing of late summer now being when Pirates is going to

[24:17] come out.

[24:19] I think you're going to see people, A, start to feel like Pirates is feeling like another

[24:25] one of these games we've just seen for a really, really long time and you're not going to

[24:30] get that hype back.

[24:33] In fact, every month where there's no games shipping, I think you lose hype and by the

[24:42] time summer comes, how are they going to drum up that hype again because we all know

[24:48] what's about to happen.

[24:50] Here is what's going to happen.

[24:53] By the time Pirates ships, we are going to get Monster Bash remake is going to be shown.

[24:59] We are also going to get another Stern Pimble machine before Pirates even ships.

[25:07] That's going to be Deadpool, which is another phenomenal probably looking game from Stern

[25:13] and a theme people love.

[25:14] We're also going to get, we know we're going to get into the Expo holiday season for Stern,

[25:21] which is going to be two more titles probably with Beatles and probably Monsters.

[25:26] We have a lot of games coming out and Jack is still waiting to get this game on the line.

[25:35] I'm sorry, but they just launched it too early.

[25:41] Remember when Jack said before dialed and came out, I'm not going to reveal another game

[25:47] until it's ready to ship.

[25:49] I've learned my lesson and here we are.

[25:53] Now we're looking at a game that's been shown for almost a year before it will go on the

[25:58] production line.

[26:00] I just don't think these delays will do anything, but hurt their ability to drum up hype and

[26:06] sales.

[26:07] If you agree, cool.

[26:09] If you disagree, cool.

[26:11] Time will tell.

[26:12] Time will tell, but I just feel like something's off.

[26:17] Something's off with Jack's schedule and Jack's planning.

[26:20] I don't know why he had such a desire to show at Expo.

[26:24] I think Stern's realizing, especially with the sales of Iron Maiden happening so quickly,

[26:31] maybe they don't need the shows.

[26:32] Maybe they don't need the shows to drum up the hype.

[26:35] I did do a little investigating because I was criticizing Stern for baneling on TPS.

[26:42] I even criticized them for being like, well, how much more could the game be a long 10

[26:46] days later?

[26:48] I know and I found out that it really wasn't their decision.

[26:52] When you're working with these major licenses and these licenseers, people forget and I always

[26:58] forget this and I need to remind myself that Stern doesn't call all these shots.

[27:03] That Stern is at the mercy of the license holder, the IP holder, on when they can do stuff,

[27:09] how they can do stuff, and what the schedule is for stuff.

[27:13] Like those license holders don't approve stuff or don't want to show stuff or not ready

[27:19] to show stuff or want to show it for the first time with the media exclusive because remember

[27:24] this.

[27:25] Remember, let's say you're the license holder for Iron Maiden and you're like, well, do

[27:30] we want to reveal at a Texas pinball show where on a weekend or do we want to reveal

[27:37] on a major media outlet like Rolling Stone and do it that way and get in front of

[27:43] like everybody knowing you'll also get the pinball people as well because everyone

[27:47] who goes to these shows for the most part is also, you know, we'll be on pinside, we'll

[27:54] read it in the mass media.

[27:55] So who knows, I'll never, you will never know 100% how these things happen but what I did

[28:01] say back to my Stern friends was this, then why don't you just tell us, just tell us

[28:07] that.

[28:08] Like you don't have to burn your license, sorry, but you could just say, look, we wanted

[28:12] to show Iron Maiden, we wanted, you can't say Iron Maiden, we wanted to show an X

[28:16] game of TPS unfortunately, we don't ever prove it yet to reveal to the world the reveal

[28:21] will be coming shortly and that's all you got to say and people will understand and

[28:26] they're not going to, you know, they're not going to be banging on the door like Iron Maiden

[28:30] is like marketing team to and be like, what the hell, you just ruined my TPS, you know,

[28:34] it's not going to happen.

[28:35] All right.

[28:36] All right.

[28:37] So who else is this not good news for?

[28:40] Well, pretty much any pinball machine that gets revealed is not good news for Thunderbirds

[28:44] because Thunderbirds biggest problem is being Thunderbirds and the more I see that game,

[28:51] the more I'm just like, man, how I mean seriously, it's the same, it's basically the same price

[28:56] is Iron Maiden pro.

[28:59] So put Thunderbirds next to Iron Maiden pro and then ask yourself, how many times would

[29:06] someone have to be dropped on their head to choose Thunderbirds over Iron Maiden?

[29:12] Everything about Iron Maiden is much, much better.

[29:14] I mean, you just have to be like the world's most obsessed Thunderbirds fan to pick Thunder

[29:19] Birds.

[29:20] And then also more info is coming to light of the computer system that is driving Thunder

[29:25] Birds that it, you have to send in your board to do a code update.

[29:29] It's not, you can't just plug in something.

[29:32] You can't download a new code from the internet and the system they're using is like really,

[29:36] really old.

[29:38] And you know, I mean, again, look at the LCD screen on Iron Maiden versus orange dots.

[29:44] And so home pins going to have a difficult time.

[29:48] Lastly, the two companies that I just think, you know, this has been a fun podcast, right?

[29:55] We've been upbeat.

[29:56] We've been positive.

[29:57] We've been celebrating all this fun new pinball.

[30:00] So I'm going to be brutally honest.

[30:02] I love this hobby.

[30:04] When the companies that actually have their shit together, excited us like they did this

[30:09] week, that is what keeps all of us in this hobby.

[30:13] It's what we all love to see.

[30:15] I'll tell you right now, I just really, I just really have, can't imagine who still has

[30:23] patience to wait for Alan and the big Lebowski to figure their shit out.

[30:31] I mean, it's a joke.

[30:33] Can we just say it?

[30:34] It's a joke.

[30:36] Look how many pins spooky, stern and Jersey Jack have shipped since the big Lebowski announced.

[30:45] Okay?

[30:46] We're talking probably collectively amongst all of them.

[30:50] Those companies collectively have probably shipped close to 20 pinball machines.

[30:57] Probably more when those guys in four years couldn't even get their pre-orders filled.

[31:03] And we're not even, we're not anywhere closer to having that come-do fruition.

[31:08] And I just think 2018 will be the year.

[31:13] It's the year where like the cream will rise to the top.

[31:18] And these companies that are just burning on fumes and on their last lifeline, you know,

[31:25] sending out shady emails about how, oh, you can cut the line and get an L.E. now.

[31:31] And this and that, I can't wait for when Dutch starts doing the same thing because there

[31:35] is no way for these companies to make up that lost revenue.

[31:39] There's just no way.

[31:42] The only way out is if they find a billionaire or a hundred millionaire angel investor, the

[31:50] way Jack did.

[31:51] And even then it's difficult.

[31:53] Look, it's difficult.

[31:54] Jack's got deep, deep pockets.

[31:56] And clearly, clearly there's a financial reason why pirates is not coming out when it

[32:03] was supposed to.

[32:04] All right.

[32:05] What else is there?

[32:06] Am I missing any other companies?

[32:08] Chicago gaming, Monster Bash Remake?

[32:10] Does this hurt them?

[32:11] You know, I'm going to say yes.

[32:13] And here's why.

[32:14] Here's why.

[32:15] I just think there's so much exciting new pinball that you can go get a Monster Bash.

[32:21] You can go get a Monster Bash right now for $7,000, $8,000.

[32:24] The prices have come down to earth.

[32:26] There's so much exciting new pinball experiences to be had that I don't think we need.

[32:31] I really, I just don't think we need this whole like remake approach to pinball.

[32:38] I think it would be welcomed if there weren't all these new companies making all these

[32:43] new exciting pinball experiences.

[32:45] But there are.

[32:47] And so why do we have to look to the past when companies like Stern and Spooky and Jack

[32:51] and everyone else, you know, they're looking to the future.

[32:54] They're looking to the future.

[32:56] And you know, those old games, they were great in their time.

[32:59] And some of them are still great.

[33:01] But they feel dated to me.

[33:03] And I do agree that Chicago gaming does a good job in like modernizing the game enough

[33:07] with the new display and this and that.

[33:09] And you still get the great game experience.

[33:12] But again, these are still games that you've been playing now for 20 to 25 years, 20 to

[33:19] 25 years.

[33:20] For some of you guys, it's like half of your life you've been playing these games.

[33:24] You know, you've never, you're never going to get this sort of thrill you're going to

[33:28] get when you play a new game for the first time.

[33:31] You're just not going to, it's just not going to happen.

[33:34] It's not going to happen.

[33:35] The friend who went back and bought his 1990 like six Toyota Super Turbo, you know, he's

[33:41] like, oh yeah, I'm going to go get like the badass sports car from the 90s compared,

[33:47] even like a Honda Civic from 2018, a Type R will like, will handle much better than

[33:53] that car.

[33:54] Like, advancements happen in the experience of playing Pimbal.

[33:58] All right.

[33:59] Am I missing anyone else?

[34:00] I think that's, I think that's pretty much it.

[34:03] Let me do this because then I want to hit the gym after I like get off a plane.

[34:07] I don't know about you guys, but I need to like get some blood flowing.

[34:09] Let me read some, some user email here and then we will call it a day on this Galweijin

[34:15] version of Canadian Spinball Pockets.

[34:19] Bren is sitting on the bed.

[34:20] Bren, any, any Irish phrase I should use like, go on now, so you will.

[34:25] Is that it?

[34:26] Don't even try it now.

[34:28] Okay.

[34:29] I'm going to, I'm, I'm doing my worst Irish accent.

[34:31] All right.

[34:32] Some user mail from you guys.

[34:34] I'm going to start out with, let's see, Keith Murphy, I think.

[34:40] Let's see your Daniel.

[34:41] All right.

[34:42] Let's start with Daniel.

[34:43] He wrote, the subject was alien, Ellie's in Australia.

[34:49] In case you haven't seen, fuel to the alien, Ellie fire.

[34:53] More machines not going to pre-order homes.

[34:56] Okay.

[34:57] So, so basically he sent me a link to Ossier Kate Forum that basically is showing that

[35:02] the new games shipping are not going to people who pre-order their games.

[35:06] So it's not news.

[35:08] It just validates that if you pre-order your game with Andrew Highway, you're kind of

[35:14] screwed.

[35:15] You really are at the back of the line.

[35:17] You're always going to be at the back of the line.

[35:20] And the lesson learned is always order your game from a distributor, not a manufacturer.

[35:26] All right.

[35:27] I got an email from Keith Humphrey.

[35:30] He said, hey, Chris.

[35:31] This time emailer, but long time listener.

[35:34] I was listening to your recent show on T-P-F and how manufacturers reveal and agree with

[35:40] what you were saying.

[35:42] I didn't go to T-P-F, but had similar thoughts over the weekend about how they could do it

[35:47] better.

[35:48] As we've all seen the talks where the projection screen appears flat and washed out.

[35:54] Followed by the bum rush to the machine, cameras hanging over the glass and difficulty

[35:59] hearing the machine.

[36:01] Some for online videos of the machine at the seminar were on the floor.

[36:06] Could it be possible for those going to the shows to offer some type of manufacturer VIP

[36:12] pass to those willing to pay a little extra for it, where they can set up the machine in

[36:17] a room since it is there some two days before showing anyway and allows some five or ten

[36:23] people at a time to go in with no cameras or cell phones and experience the game with

[36:29] lights and sounds how it is meant to be.

[36:32] This would be a great experience for those who are there to see the game away from the

[36:36] crowds and get all the fields of the game.

[36:39] Put a little extra money to the show runners and create some buzz that the rest of the show

[36:43] couldn't marinate on until full reveal.

[36:46] Anyway, love the show.

[36:47] Keep it respectable.

[36:48] All right.

[36:49] Well, look, Keith, thank you for the note.

[36:53] What's an interesting sort of strategy is to invite people in with no technology to

[37:00] get that intimate experience I was talking about.

[37:02] Now, look, you could charge a VIP sort of pass.

[37:08] We see it at every major theme park, right?

[37:10] You can get the VIP pass.

[37:12] You can get the cup of lines and get on the ride sooner.

[37:17] There are always those people that complain that that's sort of favoring people with money,

[37:21] but you know what?

[37:22] Welcome to the real world, suckers.

[37:23] If you've got cash, you get in front of the line.

[37:27] No.

[37:28] I think a lot of the manufacturers could figure out a way to do it without even asking for money.

[37:32] I think they know who their VIP customers are.

[37:36] I think a smart way to do it with these big shows is actually have the major distributors

[37:41] sort of invite their VIPs to an exclusive look at the next title from Spooky or Stern or

[37:48] Jersey Jack.

[37:50] I think that's how they should do it.

[37:52] I think people would be very respectful and put their cell phones away.

[37:56] I think it would be easy to police that room when people do that so no one does snap

[38:03] anything or take something they shouldn't.

[38:05] I think people would be very respectful because they understand what's at stake.

[38:10] That's how I would do it.

[38:11] I also think the pinball media that is out there, consider myself to be one of those, should

[38:17] also get a similar experience.

[38:18] So we can give you guys feedback without feeling like we're just another part of the mob.

[38:24] And I think that's a good idea, Keith.

[38:25] So let's see if that happens moving forward at these shows.

[38:28] All right, I got an email from Jay Fowler.

[38:31] Jason is his name, says, hey, Chris, just letting you know Spooky did this with TNA as well.

[38:37] I know as I ordered one.

[38:40] The way that they present it is, is you are locked in with the ability to find someone

[38:46] else to fill your spot.

[38:47] I know people have actually sold their spot in line at a small profit.

[38:51] So he's referring to the non-refundable deposit.

[38:55] And he's right.

[38:56] So Spooky did that with TNA and people who went in on a TNA had a given non-refundable deposit.

[39:02] I'm not surprised people have sold their spot in line for a profit because people want

[39:06] that game now and they don't want to wait.

[39:08] And so they're willing to, you know, I'll give you $500 extra if I can cut the line a

[39:13] little bit.

[39:14] It's like nothing to these people.

[39:16] It's freaking peanuts, $500 to $1,000 of some of these dudes.

[39:19] I mean, that's so much dinner cost that like Perry's for just a few of us.

[39:23] And you need to get your pinball machine earlier.

[39:26] You know, no questions asked.

[39:28] All right, let's see.

[39:29] I got 16 minutes left on the battery here, which is good because I don't have that many

[39:33] more emails.

[39:34] I got an email from Michael.

[39:37] Shalice, he says, now I get it.

[39:40] It's a story about how he went to play Houdini.

[39:44] He said almost everything that I've read about the game on Pinside has been positive

[39:48] and those who have posted negative comments have received all kinds of encouragement.

[39:55] That once you learn how to make this shot or back in that shot, everything will be great.

[40:00] Today I am left wondering are the big cheerleaders for this game, the ones who own it and are

[40:06] not worrying about how many quarters they are feeding the machine because they're on

[40:11] free play.

[40:12] They can't be average players.

[40:15] They can't be the average player who is playing at the local arcade where he is pouring

[40:19] quarters into the game at roughly the same rate that he is breaking shots in an almost

[40:25] few-tile attempt to hit the interloop.

[40:28] Sure, it happened sometimes and I did make the ball fly into the trunk on four occasions,

[40:33] but it seemed more luck than any mastery of the shot when it happened.

[40:38] To start a scene shot on the shot seems easy and comparison.

[40:43] You are right, Canada.

[40:44] The shots are too tight and for this player who encountered the game for the first time,

[40:49] it was not fun since I never felt like I was making any progress in the game.

[40:53] I am sure that if I owned it, eventually I would start making these shots and perhaps

[40:58] be grateful to have a game that is so challenging while it is a good looking machine for now.

[41:03] I am passing on this one both as a game in my home collection and as a game to seek out

[41:08] on location.

[41:09] Thanks for continuing to be the not always reasonable voice of reason in the Pimble community.

[41:17] As always, my best debaba, Mike.

[41:19] Well, Mike, thank you.

[41:20] Look, I have said it before and I will say it again.

[41:24] Everyone has a different experience on every machine and I found who Dini shots to be

[41:28] tight when I played it.

[41:29] I found it to be a pretty difficult game when I played it again.

[41:34] Some people hop on games like Pirates of the Caribbean and I am reading people are starting

[41:40] to complain because of long ball times.

[41:44] Which one is it?

[41:45] Do you want 30 minute ball times or do you want a game to be over in 3 minutes?

[41:49] I think the good balance in Pimble is a game that is not super, super long ball time

[41:57] but even in just a few minutes, you feel like you are progressing through the game.

[42:02] I think a lot of that can be helped with who Dini if they make it easier to get into

[42:08] the game or some of the code.

[42:10] I think some of the shots are challenging or too challenging to get going in the game.

[42:16] Let's see what they do with it.

[42:18] But I think, Mike, you are learning what we all learn is that play a game if you like

[42:23] it and you enjoy it, buy it if you don't.

[42:27] It's okay.

[42:28] We don't have to buy and support every single Pimble machine that comes out.

[42:32] We'd all go broke.

[42:33] I got an email from a D Bulldoze.

[42:37] I don't think that's his name.

[42:40] Theme integration nailed.

[42:41] Canada, just watch the stream from Maiden and that world under glass has been nailed.

[42:47] Battling Eddie and all his song forms is really cool.

[42:50] It appears that Power Slave Eddie is the predominant villain in the back where the

[43:00] center shot is A la Lord of the Rings.

[43:03] The world of Iron Maiden nailed to a fine point.

[43:06] It's all the iconic artwork coming to life.

[43:09] Can't wait to play it.

[43:10] This is my dream theme for me but swore never to be in debt again.

[43:15] So I will just have to seek one out.

[43:17] Keep on the awesome podcast bro.

[43:19] I look forward to them.

[43:20] Thanks Dan.

[43:21] Well Dan Bulldoze, I agree man.

[43:25] This pin is the freaking Iron Maiden world under glass like times 10.

[43:30] It is F in awesome.

[43:33] I also highly respect you on so many levels man because you're not going to go into debt

[43:39] to get this game.

[43:40] I know how hard it is to pass up on something that is like your dream theme.

[43:45] But here's the thing man.

[43:47] Just save your money over time and every single pinball becomes available.

[43:52] Heck even a Batman SLE just sold yesterday for $16,100 and that was a machine that the

[44:00] seller wouldn't ship and was local pick up only and he ended the auction at 1am on a

[44:06] Wednesday.

[44:08] That was New York time.

[44:09] So imagine if he would have shipped it anywhere.

[44:11] He would probably left $3,000 to $4,000 on the table with that being the only shipping

[44:16] method.

[44:17] So look I think that you're right.

[44:21] This game it just has people giddy because of how awesome the world of Iron Maiden is coming

[44:27] to life.

[44:28] Now for me I just don't know that world.

[44:30] I love the look of it.

[44:31] It's kind of like a stargate.

[44:32] I don't know what's going on.

[44:33] There's like there's Egyptian stuff.

[44:35] He's a mummy right.

[44:37] There's the Iron Maiden's sarcophagus.

[44:39] It's like all this cool shit.

[44:40] It is really really really cool world that they brought to life and it's got the Union

[44:44] Jack flag.

[44:45] It's got it.

[44:46] I mean it's got everything.

[44:47] Brenna is looking at me.

[44:48] I said that because the Irish women when they see the British flag, they are mad.

[44:54] They are really mad.

[44:55] I got an email from my last one from Dave Falgren.

[45:00] Dave who's been on the show.

[45:01] He said before this email begins I have a message for Stern Pimbal.

[45:06] Thank you for not putting an action button on the lockdown bar.

[45:11] Nothing like a reveal to remind you how crazy Pimbal people are.

[45:15] First the Saturday reveal wasn't a reveal.

[45:18] It was an announcement.

[45:19] People were mad.

[45:20] Second Jack Janger does a live stream of 330 Central time from Stern.

[45:24] Camp posted on YouTube.

[45:26] People are mad.

[45:27] I'd like to remind everyone that by July there will be hundreds of Iron Maiden pins

[45:32] in the world and nobody will give a shit anymore because they will be looking for the next

[45:37] new pin to be mad about.

[45:39] The game looked great and I'm looking forward to playing it five times so I can give a

[45:43] valid opinion.

[45:44] Bravo to Stern for having a pretty fine looking pro machine that seems playable.

[45:50] I watched about 45 minutes of the stream.

[45:53] Ball times seems long but they usually do when there are four pro players.

[45:58] And sure why anyone would order a premium or a le without seeing the art package but

[46:03] apparently they are getting orders.

[46:05] Gotta love it.

[46:07] Great meeting you in Texas.

[46:08] Keep up the good work Dave.

[46:09] Oh Dave, thank you for the email.

[46:11] First of all, amen brother.

[46:14] That lockdown bar is that it's annoying on most games.

[46:18] I hate it.

[46:19] I literally hate the lockdown bar button.

[46:21] I'm gonna go on record for saying it is the it could be the single reason why I think

[46:27] someone would like not want to buy prior to the Caribbean.

[46:31] You have to use it too much.

[46:33] You literally need like a gold spot or to sit like stand next to you and keep tapping it.

[46:38] It's too much.

[46:40] The way lineman uses it in Batman is perfect because it's barely used.

[46:45] It doesn't even need to be on that bar.

[46:47] Like lineman could have just had it be been a second button next to like one of the flippers

[46:52] and that would have been fine.

[46:53] It's not like you're constantly slapping it like Star Wars.

[46:56] I hate it.

[46:57] And the reason why this is not on there because Keith designed this game before joining

[47:02] Stern.

[47:03] Who knows if that's a mandate from Stern because maybe operators like it because it distracts

[47:08] the player making them drain more and then thus earning them more money.

[47:12] But I don't like heavy use of a lockdown bar button.

[47:16] I don't.

[47:17] I think it's the dumbest thing to make people do and I don't think it makes pinball more

[47:22] fun.

[47:23] In fact, I think it's pretty stupid.

[47:24] I think people look stupid slapping at it too.

[47:27] So that's my two cents on the lockdown bar.

[47:29] All right, guys, I have to go work out.

[47:32] I am a little bit in my jet lag.

[47:35] I don't even know if I am.

[47:36] I played a bunch of Nintendo Switch on the plane.

[47:41] Good week for pinball.

[47:42] Exciting times.

[47:43] You guys now have to say, where am I going to spend my money?

[47:47] How am I going to hide all these purchases for my wife?

[47:49] How am I going to tell my kids I can't go to college to get all these exciting new pinball

[47:53] machines?

[47:54] It's a lot.

[47:55] There's a lot of choices out there.

[47:57] I wish I had a million dollars and I wish I had a 10,000 square foot game room and I would

[48:01] just put everything in it and enjoy them all.

[48:05] But you know what made me laugh?

[48:07] What made me laugh was I was reading Rodo Dave and I'll end with this complaining about

[48:11] the prices of Jersey Jack pinball machines, complaining about them.

[48:15] Like he's like, I'm a pro guy.

[48:17] I'm in on the pros.

[48:18] Dude, you have 125 machines.

[48:22] You're in only on the pros.

[48:24] You own a hundred and 25 machines.

[48:28] Even if I were just to value each of those, let's say the average cost of Rodo Dave's

[48:33] machines are $2,000.

[48:37] Where is he at?

[48:38] He's got almost $300,000 in pinball machines and you're only in on the pro.

[48:44] Can we stop the hypocrisy?

[48:46] Can someone call that guy out for being such a hypocrite about pinball prices?

[48:51] You are addicted.

[48:53] You fly all over the world.

[48:54] How much money, Dave?

[48:56] Does it cost to fly all over the world to do nothing other than play pinball and eat fatty

[49:01] food in America?

[49:02] How much money does that cost?

[49:04] You can't afford Jersey Jack machines.

[49:07] Come on, bro.

[49:08] Get at me.

[49:09] Get at me.

[49:10] Alright guys, have a great day.

[49:11] We'll be back maybe on this trip again.

[49:13] Maybe not.

[49:14] I don't think much more is going to happen.

[49:17] But who knows?

[49:18] I have a bunch of whiskey and I start pay piling you guys money.

[49:24] Let's do it on RGB.

[49:25] Rex game pinball.

[49:26] You should look out for that.

[49:27] Brenna is telling me, Brenna, it's like $5 or $10.

[49:30] No?

[49:31] No?

[49:32] Just no?

[49:33] Alright, we save him for a wedding.

[49:35] Brenna.

[49:36] Okay.

[49:37] She said I'm an Egypt.

[49:39] That's what they say in Ireland.

[49:40] Not idiot.

[49:41] Egypt.

[49:42] If you like a lockdown bar, you're an Egypt.

[49:44] Good night everyone.
