[00:29] I can't believe we've made it to 250 episodes.

[00:32] It's taken a while to get there.

[00:34] It's taken a while to get there.

[00:35] We have now officially put up more episodes

[00:39] than coast to coast pinball.

[00:41] We have put up a lot, a lot of pinball content,

[00:44] but I'm so happy that we are at this milestone

[00:48] in that all of you out there who listen to this show

[00:51] appreciate what we're trying to do,

[00:52] which is just give you an unfiltered,

[00:56] I think on this dialogue about this pinball hobby.

[01:00] And I appreciate, I really mean it,

[01:02] because as much as I take time out of my week

[01:06] and my day to make this pinball podcast,

[01:09] all of you out there also take time out of your day

[01:14] when you could be doing something else

[01:15] to listen to this pinball podcast.

[01:17] So I really appreciate it.

[01:18] So what I have for you on this special 250th edition

[01:23] is I have an interview.

[01:24] I have an interview with a man who is part of a pinball company.

[01:29] And no, it's not Gary Stern, no, it's not Jersey Jack.

[01:32] It is Robert Mueller at Deeproot Pinball.

[01:35] And there is a lot of curiosity,

[01:38] a lot of speculation about what is actually happening

[01:43] over at Deeproot.

[01:44] So we're gonna have a really good hour long conversation

[01:48] about Deeproot Pinball.

[01:50] And I think you're gonna enjoy it.

[01:51] I think you're gonna hear some stuff that is new.

[01:54] I think you're going to hear some tough questions that I ask.

[01:58] But I think you're also gonna come away

[02:01] after you listen to the whole thing with a couple thoughts.

[02:04] I think you're gonna be like,

[02:05] these guys are kind of crazy.

[02:07] Their ambitions are kind of larger than life.

[02:10] But they really seem dedicated to proving people wrong.

[02:14] And let's face it, the number one person

[02:17] they're gonna prove wrong is me,

[02:19] because my very first assessment of this whole thing

[02:22] is it would never work out.

[02:24] And as I began to talk to Robert over the months,

[02:28] I started to just turn a page and turn a corner

[02:33] on how I felt about this company

[02:36] and what they're trying to do.

[02:37] Now I haven't seen anything.

[02:39] The proof is always in the pudding in the pinball world.

[02:41] You have to deliver.

[02:43] It doesn't matter what you say,

[02:44] it doesn't matter what your intentions are.

[02:47] And we all know that it's always more difficult

[02:49] to get machines in boxes and into consumer homes.

[02:52] And it is to say you're gonna do it.

[02:54] But that being said, they're not taking pre-order money.

[02:58] They're not asking you for anything other than

[03:01] to sit back, hold on and enjoy the ride

[03:05] as they try to bring new innovation into the pinball world.

[03:09] And what I do like about the company

[03:11] is they aren't satisfied with the current state of pinball.

[03:15] And this is something that I sort of dance around a little bit.

[03:20] But I think pinball really is in need of a little shake up.

[03:25] And I don't think the current pinball companies

[03:28] that are out there are really pushing

[03:31] the hobby forward in the right way.

[03:33] I mean, heck, we have just off the presses,

[03:37] Monster Bash remake is now confirmed by Chicago Gaming Company.

[03:40] One of the worst kept secrets in all of pinball.

[03:43] I am excited to see what they do at the package,

[03:45] but it's a remake.

[03:47] We're looking backwards to look forwards.

[03:50] I think the remakes are great.

[03:52] I think it's gonna be an amazing game,

[03:54] but it's nothing new.

[03:56] There will be new parts to an old game,

[03:58] but it's still, we're not looking that forward.

[04:02] And I do believe that if you're complacent in any hobby

[04:07] or any industry and you just start to accept what you get,

[04:11] you start to accept what you get.

[04:13] And that is, I can't tell you.

[04:16] When I see people just paying $9,000 for Star Wars

[04:21] and paying all this money, $9,000 for Guardians of the Galaxy

[04:25] L.E.'s, and we just have to accept what we get

[04:29] from the big boy in the hobby stern.

[04:32] We have wait forever for Jersey Jack to deliver.

[04:35] And it's just the hobby needs new players

[04:40] that try to do new things.

[04:41] Now look, will they succeed?

[04:43] I hope so.

[04:45] I don't know, but I'll tell you this.

[04:47] I'm curious as to what they deliver in Pimbal.

[04:50] And my ultimate belief in life is always the same

[04:53] that only people who are angry change the world.

[04:57] You have to be someone unhappy

[05:00] about what the current Pimbal landscape is giving us

[05:03] in order to make something different and better.

[05:06] And I just don't think we're getting our money's worth

[05:10] in the current Pimbal landscape, all right?

[05:12] I'll leave it at that, all right?

[05:14] Now speaking of getting your money's worth,

[05:16] a little bit of news before I air the interview with Robert.

[05:20] I couldn't help, but once again,

[05:22] get dragged into the big Lebowski thread.

[05:26] And I kind of look at this whole thing like this.

[05:30] How many different ways does Dutch Pimbal need to die

[05:34] before people will finally accept the fact

[05:37] that they're probably not gonna get their games?

[05:40] And I get that some of you out there

[05:41] are so emotionally attached to this

[05:43] and really want your product.

[05:45] But here's the thing that to me has me starting

[05:49] to just pull my hair out to when are we gonna learn?

[05:54] When are we gonna finally learn that all of these failures,

[06:00] they end the same, the companies run out of money.

[06:05] There is no money.

[06:07] Now here's what's happening at Dutch.

[06:10] And it's very similar to what happened in highway

[06:12] is that they're asking you politely to please,

[06:18] here it's the same three things.

[06:20] We're out of money, so please don't ask for refunds.

[06:24] Please don't thread into Sue us

[06:26] because if you sue us, the money we're gonna need

[06:30] to dish out refunds and engage in lawsuits

[06:34] will most definitely bankrupt the company

[06:37] and you will get nothing.

[06:39] And please just be patient

[06:41] even though you've waited years for your product.

[06:43] Now the problem is this,

[06:44] is that certain people are still getting refunds.

[06:46] And I saw on there, I think Rare Heroes said

[06:50] one of his friends just got a refund today.

[06:52] And let me tell you, it's no mystery

[06:54] as to how these people are getting their refunds.

[06:57] They are threatening to sue them.

[07:01] They are threatening to go to Universal

[07:04] if they don't get their refund and open up

[07:06] a lawsuit against Dutch Pimball.

[07:09] So Dutch Pimball is giving money back

[07:12] to people who do that.

[07:14] And you're in the same situation

[07:15] that you were in with highway

[07:17] that if all these people start to make threats

[07:20] and they make a run at the bank, it's over.

[07:23] But here's the problem.

[07:25] Here's what sucks for everybody involved.

[07:28] Is the same thing happened with highway.

[07:29] Is that people who wanna refund

[07:32] who are promised they could get their money back

[07:34] on a product that they invested in.

[07:37] You can't blame people for wanting their money back.

[07:42] And then you can't point to the 10 guys

[07:43] who got their refunds as you're the reason why

[07:46] they never made the game.

[07:47] And without your request for a refund,

[07:49] we would have got our big lab house.

[07:50] That is total BS.

[07:53] Total BS.

[07:54] And the thing that everyone just needs to stop speculating

[07:59] they're out of money.

[08:01] Okay, so here's the question

[08:03] that everyone who's in on this game needs to realize.

[08:07] Where does the money come from to pay ARA

[08:12] for the games that were already shipped

[08:16] and the games that ARA built?

[08:19] Right, there's no money.

[08:20] There's no money to buy the parts for Zitek

[08:24] to start making the new versions of the game.

[08:27] There's no money.

[08:28] All that Dutch and their new correspondence have said is this

[08:32] that their lawyer was successful

[08:35] in getting ARA's legal people to back down a little bit.

[08:39] Okay, so let's say they decide ARA decides

[08:42] not to sue Dutch Pimbal or not to get into litigation.

[08:46] Okay, but there's still no money to pay the bill.

[08:52] When you think ARA is just gonna like send those games out,

[08:55] gonna start making big labouskies again

[08:57] when they weren't even paid for the machines that they had made.

[09:00] There's just no money.

[09:01] So you can't make money.

[09:04] There's no way to materialize new money.

[09:08] You know, they're trying to sell play fields and aprons

[09:11] and artwork to maybe get enough money to refund these people,

[09:14] but there's no money.

[09:15] And the other part of the Dutch correspondence

[09:18] that is a real head scratcher is they say,

[09:21] we haven't paid ourselves a salary since January of 2018.

[09:28] 2018 was this past January.

[09:31] They didn't ship last time I checked any big labouskies

[09:35] to anybody in 2017.

[09:38] So let that sink in people that they pay themselves a salary

[09:44] for an entire year when you didn't get anything.

[09:49] So the question then is how much salary

[09:54] did they pay themselves that all the money is gone?

[09:58] That there's hardly any money to make the games.

[10:01] How do you pay yourself a salary?

[10:03] I don't get it.

[10:04] I don't get it.

[10:05] And this is not me rooting against you early achievers.

[10:09] I want it you to get your games.

[10:11] I think you deserve your games.

[10:13] But are we not seeing the same exact pattern

[10:17] of highway pinball, of Dutch pinball?

[10:19] And while the situations are different,

[10:23] the overarching story is the same.

[10:25] When you're at a money, it's game over.

[10:28] It's game over.

[10:29] I saw someone suggest that the most ass-in-line solution ever,

[10:34] which is they should start selling machines for $20,000

[10:38] just to make profit on those machines

[10:42] and use that extra money to make up the lost revenue.

[10:47] So let me ask you a question.

[10:48] You think someone's gonna buy a $20,000 big labouskie.

[10:52] And then when they get back to even,

[10:56] what they're gonna start charging $10,000 for the game?

[11:00] So someone's gonna pay twice the price

[11:04] just so the game has a chance of survival.

[11:06] And then that person loses $10,000 on the value

[11:10] of their machine if they spend $20,000 on it.

[11:13] I just, you can tell them a little bit like just perturbed

[11:16] because this is episode 250.

[11:19] And you think by now, you think by now,

[11:22] after all of what we've discussed,

[11:26] that pinball people would stop just having all these

[11:31] irrational hopes and dreams and desires

[11:35] to salvage companies that clearly mismanaged the funds.

[11:41] And they took your money and your money did not go

[11:45] to making a machine.

[11:46] I don't understand for the life of me

[11:49] how barrianyop could take all of your money.

[11:53] When they already had the machine design,

[11:55] they already had the manufacturing going

[11:58] and then they can't figure out how to just get you the game.

[12:01] And now we're on this two year journey

[12:03] that's ended up with nothing but bullshit.

[12:07] They missed managed your money.

[12:10] They want you to believe it's all ARA's fault.

[12:12] It's all their fault.

[12:15] Okay, I don't buy it.

[12:17] I bet both sides of somewhat to blame,

[12:20] but how did they fuck it up this bad?

[12:22] How did they get to the point

[12:24] where people are starting go-fun needs

[12:26] to pay their legal bills and early achievers think

[12:30] $20,000 games will bail them out.

[12:33] They're pouring more money into a failed venture at this point.

[12:39] So that's it.

[12:40] How many different ways can Dutch die?

[12:43] How many different ways can early achievers

[12:46] try to conjure up new hope

[12:48] and how many times can people make excuses

[12:52] for people who took your money and didn't get you a machine

[12:57] but yet they paid themselves.

[12:59] You understand that?

[13:00] They paid themselves a salary during an entire year

[13:04] where they didn't deliver you what you were promised.

[13:08] How does that sit well with people?

[13:11] Anyway, let's turn a page.

[13:14] Let's turn a page and get to this interview.

[13:18] And like I was saying, I think there is going to be,

[13:23] at least, there's gonna be disruption happening

[13:27] and deep root is going to disrupt the Pimble marketplace.

[13:32] I think it's a good thing that companies are trying

[13:36] to disrupt.

[13:37] You're gonna hear a lot of their goals are very, very ambitious.

[13:41] I, in our experiences of watching new companies

[13:44] get into Pimble, nobody has quite succeeded

[13:47] in quickly ramping up to a large scale manufacturing

[13:51] Pimble company.

[13:53] But there's a team working on it.

[13:54] This isn't J-Pop in his own room,

[13:57] like tinkering on stuff.

[13:58] They've got people.

[13:59] They've got experienced people that are part of this company.

[14:03] And I can't imagine all those people would be sticking around

[14:05] if there was no progress being made.

[14:08] And I haven't heard anyone bailing or jumping out

[14:12] of the company and saying, I was that deep root

[14:14] for eight months and it's full of shit and I'm out.

[14:16] I haven't heard anyone do that.

[14:18] So there must be a reason why.

[14:20] You know how many times do we hear people at highway say,

[14:23] you know what?

[14:24] Andrew doesn't know what he's talking about.

[14:25] And I left the company and then people made excuses for him.

[14:29] So we're not hearing that.

[14:31] So let's air this interview.

[14:34] Let's, we talk all about.

[14:36] We even go into like Stern stealing the Godzilla license

[14:39] from spooky.

[14:40] We go into a lot of stuff.

[14:42] And I really do think you're going to enjoy it.

[14:44] I think you're, I'm going to get some feedback on this one.

[14:47] I hope you guys don't feel I went too easy.

[14:50] I mean, I have nothing personal against Robert.

[14:53] I always do my interviews in a respectful manner.

[14:56] He isn't somebody that is, again, taking anyone's money

[15:00] and not delivered and he's trying to make what John did right.

[15:04] And look, I mean, this is as good as a chance

[15:09] it's going to get because John has a team of people

[15:11] surrounding him that know how to do stuff.

[15:14] So let's see what happens.

[15:17] Thank you.

[15:18] From the bottom of my heart for listening to 250 episodes

[15:23] of me rambling on about Pimbal.

[15:26] I could not have done it without each and every one of you

[15:29] supporting me.

[15:30] And I definitely could not have done it.

[15:33] If all of those people on Pinside you hate me,

[15:36] didn't tune into every single episode.

[15:39] I appreciate it, everyone.

[15:41] Enjoy the interview with Robert Mueller.

[15:44] If you have any feedback, you know where to send it.

[15:47] Canada Pimbal at gmail.com.

[15:50] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome

[15:52] to our episode 250 of Canada's Pimbal Podcast,

[15:56] a very special guest, Robert Mueller of Deep Re Pimbal.

[16:00] Robert, welcome to the show.

[16:02] Wonderful.

[16:03] Thank you, Chris.

[16:04] It's nice to be here.

[16:05] You feel very honored.

[16:06] I don't know what I deserve it.

[16:08] Well, thank you.

[16:09] Yeah, I was looking for guests for 250.

[16:13] Part of it is no one else in the industry will probably

[16:15] talk to me after I've been so vitriolic again,

[16:19] some of the boutique companies.

[16:20] But I'm glad we're talking because I think over the past few

[16:24] months, when I've looked at the Pimbal landscape,

[16:27] I think your company continues to be one of the companies

[16:30] out there that people are the most curious about.

[16:33] I look forward to having this conversation.

[16:37] Beautiful.

[16:39] There's no answers that are off topic.

[16:41] I know that you have some great thoughts.

[16:43] And I know you probably want to ask a lot of questions.

[16:47] And so I'm ready to be under the gun.

[16:50] So let's get right to it.

[16:53] So how did you ultimately decide that you know what?

[16:58] I want to start a Pimbal company.

[17:00] You're well aware of the challenges

[17:02] that lie in front of starting a Pimbal company.

[17:06] So at what moment were you like, you know what?

[17:09] I'm just going to do it.

[17:12] Well, you know, it's interesting.

[17:14] I started, it all goes back to 3D Space Cadet back

[17:19] from Windows 95.

[17:20] And I was always a video game guy.

[17:22] And as, or boy, as I was growing up,

[17:25] and there was really into Pimbal.

[17:28] But I just love 3D Space Cadet, you know,

[17:30] that virtual table that came with Windows 95.

[17:32] And it was just something about it that just caught my eye.

[17:35] But I kind of, you know, once you start upgrading,

[17:37] you can't get it back, et cetera.

[17:39] And then they take it out of the new OS.

[17:42] So I would say, end of 2014, I was looking for a new game

[17:46] for my phone, and I came across Pimbal Arcade

[17:49] and just got so hooked.

[17:51] And so I said, well, what are how much one costs?

[17:54] And so I called up Nick Parks at the Pimbal company

[17:57] and asked him and I ended up being at the right place

[18:00] the right time.

[18:01] I bought a huge collection of about 18 games off of a guy

[18:06] that Nick put me together with.

[18:08] They were an amazing condition.

[18:09] And so I had the bug.

[18:10] And so I basically, from Nick, I got introduced to Jack

[18:14] at JGP and I got introduced to Charlie.

[18:18] Got introduced to J-Pop, Ben Heck and, you know,

[18:22] Terry at Pimbal Life, Dennis Nordman, Greg Ferris.

[18:26] And so I think things went very quickly there

[18:29] because I was looking for a new avenue tech venture

[18:33] that would make sense for the deep-family companies.

[18:37] And, you know, I tried to make it all work.

[18:40] It didn't work out with any of the people at the time.

[18:44] So I shelved it.

[18:45] And, but always wanting to come back

[18:48] as I was quietly watching the industry.

[18:50] And I just saw so many weaknesses.

[18:53] And so many people getting away

[18:54] with doing really stupid things.

[18:58] And so I decided to make the plunge in October of 2016,

[19:03] my right-hand man, Craig, I pulled in.

[19:06] And we spent a couple months just going back and forth

[19:09] about all the innovations that I had on my mind.

[19:11] And we wrote them all down and we created source documents

[19:14] and looked at marketing and look at the competitors.

[19:16] And we did some market research

[19:18] and kind of decided what kind of company we really wanted

[19:21] when we built this Pimbal project up.

[19:23] And a little bit later, here we are.

[19:27] So you don't mess around.

[19:28] I mean, you went from zero to 18 games right away.

[19:31] So you became a collector immediately.

[19:35] Robert, talk to me about, and we talk a lot about marketing

[19:37] on the show.

[19:38] And I think it's interesting that you were looking

[19:41] at the Pimbal landscape and you notice certain things

[19:43] that could be done better.

[19:44] What kinds of things did you see other companies doing

[19:48] that sort of gave you the drive to try

[19:52] and do it a different way?

[19:54] I want to think you've alluded to this

[19:56] in some of your previous podcasts.

[19:58] And that Pimbal is one of those unique impulse

[20:01] by industries where people cannot leave a dollar

[20:05] in their wallet or the pocket.

[20:07] They just have to spend it.

[20:08] And what it's really created is a feeding frenzy

[20:14] for manufacturers who can put out inferior products

[20:19] in my personal opinion, restrict innovation.

[20:24] And they can still make a decent profit

[20:26] by making bad marketing or otherwise unwise business

[20:31] decisions.

[20:33] And so this is a perfect opportunity for me

[20:36] in trying to get into tech and my family companies here

[20:40] in building up something in a small industry, something

[20:43] that was within the budget, and that I could do it really well.

[20:48] Just by doing things just simply and using my noggin,

[20:51] I could out, you know, market out business, out manufacture,

[20:55] out design, anyone else that's been in the industry ever.

[20:59] So this has been a great opportunity for me

[21:04] and everyone else who shares my vision

[21:06] who's working hard every day behind the scenes here

[21:08] to go out there and prove that in shine.

[21:10] Right.

[21:11] Now, Robert, you know, I mean, there's people out there

[21:13] that are going to hear a phrase

[21:16] like the ability to out manufacture a juggernaut like Stern

[21:20] who's pumping out 50 games a day, 35 years of pinball experience

[21:24] plus, you know, 60,000 square foot facility.

[21:28] I think it's that big.

[21:29] How do you go from, I'm not in a pinball in 2014,

[21:34] you know, now I've got 18 games.

[21:36] Now I'm going to like say I can out manufacture someone

[21:40] who's been doing it for decades.

[21:41] So like, walk me through that mindset of we can do that.

[21:44] Like what knowledge, you know, do you guys feel like confident

[21:50] that you can then produce at that level?

[21:52] Or are you interested in being as big as Stern?

[21:54] I mean, where do you start the company?

[21:58] Well, I'll answer your second question first in that.

[22:00] I'm not really interested in competing against any

[22:03] of the other pinball companies.

[22:04] I mean, they're pretty much irrelevant

[22:06] to what we plan on doing.

[22:09] And I think, you know, Stern has what,

[22:11] 90, 95% of the market.

[22:13] They're going to have a tough time even if, you know,

[22:15] we were to take some of that away from them.

[22:18] And I think that we'll compete on some levels.

[22:21] And so I think that, you know, the more pinball,

[22:24] the merrier, so I don't want to take down any company.

[22:27] I want all these companies to succeed

[22:31] and do the best they can do.

[22:34] But up till now, they really haven't had a lot of competition.

[22:38] And they've gotten away with a lot of mistakes.

[22:41] And so while I don't wish them, you know, the worst,

[22:47] I think it's going to be really hard for them

[22:48] to try to compete against someone who actually came into it,

[22:51] built from the ground up the right way,

[22:53] at the right time, and the right marketing message

[22:56] and the right design.

[22:57] And we're going to show all that here pretty shortly.

[23:00] And I think we're going to,

[23:02] you're going to see a lot of this, you know, money

[23:03] that's burning hole in pockets start to flow to deeper.

[23:06] Which is because I think we've really focused on

[23:11] what people really want on pinball for so long behind the scenes

[23:15] that we've really gotten, you know, to the core nut

[23:19] of what makes pinball an amazing opportunity,

[23:22] even impulse buy for some people in the industry.

[23:26] As far as the manufacturing is concerned,

[23:28] I think that, I think Dennis on the eclectic gamers podcast

[23:33] kind of put this the best is that I,

[23:35] he kind of stated it, and I firmly believe in that's,

[23:37] that's how we've operated here at DeepRoot,

[23:39] is that people make pinball out to be a lot harder

[23:41] than it really is.

[23:43] Of course, there's a lot of components,

[23:45] and there's a lot of very difficult,

[23:46] complex components that go into both designing

[23:48] and manufacturing machine.

[23:50] But the only day many people on my staff

[23:53] have extensive manufacturing experience.

[23:57] I'm a jack of all trades.

[23:58] So I, you know, within a 10 minute period,

[24:00] can be talking about gold mining in Africa,

[24:03] and then hit on mechanical engineering issues,

[24:05] and then go to electrical and programming.

[24:08] I mean, this is just, you know,

[24:10] how we deal with our day to day affairs here at DeepRoot.

[24:13] As we're always collaborative,

[24:15] we're always on our toes,

[24:17] and we're always dealing with a lot of different subject matter.

[24:21] We've had a lot of opportunity since we started

[24:25] to really think about how we wanted to do it.

[24:26] Like, you know, we're done with quite assembly.

[24:28] That's just too old for us.

[24:30] We're now going to Octo assembly, for instance.

[24:32] And so these are the types of things that,

[24:35] in starting from the ground up,

[24:36] we don't have all of the old traditional kind of ways

[24:40] that are impediments to us having a lean agile,

[24:45] manufacturing opportunity in a much smaller space

[24:48] than something like, you know, someone like Sternhaus.

[24:50] Right, so we've seen the videos of Sternhaus,

[24:53] the sort of like the humongous assembly line

[24:55] where each person is doing one function

[24:57] as the game moves down the line.

[24:58] Now, am I right in assuming that

[25:01] going from Quad to Octo is that people have rumored that,

[25:06] I don't know if you share what that actually is,

[25:08] is it that many people are working on the game

[25:11] at one station, or is it a trade secret

[25:14] that we can't hear about?

[25:16] I think it's pretty obvious that it is a collaborative effort,

[25:22] an agile form of an assembly line versus, you know,

[25:25] the old kind of traditional where it goes down a line

[25:28] and everyone has, you know, their individual components,

[25:30] et cetera.

[25:31] And, you know, through the tests that we've been doing

[25:34] and all of the other experience that we have in manufacturing

[25:37] and the consultants that we have

[25:39] and other areas of the business that we brought into

[25:41] to look at this, you know, this for our space

[25:44] or what we're going to do with all of our innovations

[25:46] and standardization we're gonna do on all the components

[25:49] amongst all the different titles.

[25:52] This is what's going to work best for us.

[25:54] And I'm really excited to get that going.

[25:58] And, you know, if some of the other manufacturers

[26:01] want to copy us, then, you know,

[26:02] the sincerest form of flattery in many ways.

[26:05] Have you guys built a game from, you know, A to Z

[26:10] using this new form just to sort of see like,

[26:13] you know, how feasible it is and then, you know,

[26:15] we can do this and we can crank out this many games

[26:17] and we can start to see or set expectations

[26:21] for our manufacturing capabilities.

[26:25] I guess to know our R&D and our development process

[26:30] is very different than, you know,

[26:32] probably any other company would kind of attempt this.

[26:35] And the reason is is that it's sort of like a horse race.

[26:38] You got, you know, 25 different areas that are moving forward

[26:41] at different sort of speeds and they have different goals

[26:45] and sprints and while we do have focal points

[26:49] where a lot of those come together from time to time,

[26:53] the way that we've done development,

[26:55] most of this manufacturing and getting set up

[26:58] will happen a little later this year.

[27:00] But it will be very natural

[27:03] because we're already doing a lot of those right now

[27:05] in the separate development processes.

[27:07] It's bringing it together.

[27:08] Of course, there's going to be some,

[27:10] as with any manufacturing, new manufacturing setup.

[27:12] There's going to be some, some eggs and panes.

[27:15] And, but I think that we've already done a lot of development

[27:21] to, and planning to try to avoid at least the big ones

[27:24] that are usually on the radar.

[27:26] So, without going into more trade secrets

[27:31] and sort of exactly where we are

[27:32] and how we're going to set this up,

[27:34] that's probably the best I can give you.

[27:37] Sure.

[27:38] Robert, I'm curious because, you know,

[27:40] you've been in this hobby for a few years

[27:42] and you've stated that you guys have done market research

[27:46] and that you believe.

[27:47] And I've made the same accusation on my show

[27:50] that people are paying a lot for products

[27:54] and they're not necessarily getting what they pay for.

[27:58] And part of me is like, torn, I'm curious to your opinion

[28:01] on how can a company, you know,

[28:03] start selling $9,000 machines without putting

[28:07] that much value into the game.

[28:09] But people buy them, right?

[28:11] We see, we see games when the theme is right,

[28:14] sell out before people even see it.

[28:17] And is the buyer of Pimball just doesn't really care

[28:21] or is the company just taking advantage

[28:25] of people's fear or missing out on a limited edition?

[28:28] What do you think causes this feeding frenzy

[28:31] to get something that's really expensive?

[28:33] But you'd be hard pressed to see the value in it.

[28:38] Because the game hasn't changed much in so long.

[28:41] Yeah, so, I mean, that's very insightful

[28:43] and I'll all say really is it,

[28:45] I don't see why I can't be both.

[28:47] I think the hobby is dysfunctional

[28:50] from the point of view of the clientele,

[28:53] the customers and just as functional

[28:56] and still how we deal with our competitors,

[29:02] the different manufacturers

[29:03] and how they do things internally.

[29:05] And I think you put all the dysfunction together

[29:06] and I think consider a pin-side part of that dysfunction

[29:10] as well and not having a mainstream form of communication

[29:16] in the hobby between the customers and the manufacturers.

[29:19] So you have all this dysfunction

[29:20] and this is what you get.

[29:22] And so as I stated when we first started this project,

[29:26] is that I fully intend to rub people the wrong way

[29:31] and come in and create some order out of the chaos.

[29:34] And that's not gonna be easy.

[29:37] And as you can see,

[29:39] there's been a lot of inexplicable decisions

[29:41] that we've made or done that have come along the way.

[29:45] And at the end of the day,

[29:47] what we're trying to do is get to a point

[29:50] where we can share our story in a very open public way.

[29:54] And that's the five days of deep route.

[29:56] And but getting there is not something

[29:59] in this hobby that you can do without,

[30:01] saying a few things here or there,

[30:02] trying to explain in the limited way that you can

[30:06] why you're doing certain things

[30:07] or where you're coming from

[30:09] or that you actually have a passion for pinball

[30:10] and you're not just here to make a buck

[30:12] or to write off something on your taxes.

[30:15] And at the end of the day,

[30:17] people are gonna have their opinions.

[30:19] And but we know this is that they're gonna be the first ones

[30:21] in line to buy a deep route machine

[30:23] and we're very excited to sell it to them.

[30:26] Right.

[30:27] Well, let's speaking of inexplicable decisions.

[30:30] I mean, we have to talk a little bit about John and J. Pop.

[30:33] So a lot of the actually internally we call him

[30:37] J. Poplicious, but.

[30:38] J. Poplicious.

[30:39] Okay. So I'm curious.

[30:41] I got a few questions around this

[30:42] because I don't want to beat a dead horse.

[30:44] We all know that when the company sort of surface,

[30:49] John was included as one of the team members.

[30:53] And I've always said,

[30:54] I mean, as someone who's always thought

[30:55] that John has a very unique skill set within the hobby

[31:00] that needs to be controlled

[31:01] and he needs the right team around him to succeed.

[31:03] He did not have that at Zidware on his own.

[31:05] He bit up more than he could chew.

[31:07] But explain to me, you know, the strategy,

[31:10] knowing that there is a lot of Zidware baggage.

[31:13] And I know you guys have done your best to sort of explain

[31:15] how you guys will help mitigate some of that.

[31:18] There's also been a lawsuit that has gone to court

[31:22] that is still in play.

[31:25] Do you talk to me through how you weighed working with him

[31:30] and the bad PR that would come with that versus the value

[31:34] you believe John can bring to Pimble

[31:37] and to Deeproot's venture?

[31:41] Yeah. So one important thing about Deeproot

[31:44] and something that I had instituted

[31:47] into the corporate culture before,

[31:49] we even did this tech project,

[31:51] is that employees are not expenses.

[31:55] They're not necessary evils.

[31:57] They're people that I fully intend to bring into an environment

[32:01] where they can grow.

[32:04] They can, you know, be forgiven.

[32:07] They can be remade again and they can be built up

[32:10] and be allowed to unleash themselves and their talents

[32:13] in the best way possible.

[32:15] I have, I had and still have a lot of issues with J-Pop.

[32:20] What happened through a, just a series of bad decisions,

[32:28] it is what it is at this point.

[32:30] I'm not going to be able to go back and change anything that J-Pop did

[32:34] and neither is he.

[32:36] I think what we did is when he first came in,

[32:38] we just decided, what can we do with the current situation?

[32:42] And for me, I had every opportunity like Dutch

[32:47] and like Pimble brothers do now,

[32:49] is just to say, hey, look, I'm succce, you lost your money

[32:53] or you're not going to get your game,

[32:54] but that's just how it is and we're moving on.

[32:57] I could have done that, but I decided to take money out

[32:59] of my pocket and take on the J-Pop issue

[33:04] and to try to provide an opportunity for the people

[33:09] that did not get the better end of the bargain with him,

[33:12] try to make them, give them something rather than nothing.

[33:15] And while, you know, the plaintiff's case still goes on,

[33:18] so I can't talk about that for legal reasons,

[33:22] we have had an enormous amount of the people

[33:27] who were not a part of that case,

[33:30] provide positive feedback, file claims

[33:33] and are going to get something rather than nothing

[33:35] at the end of the day.

[33:36] And while they're not very public about their support

[33:42] and their desire to finally be made somewhat whole,

[33:47] I think at the end of the day that we've done our best

[33:49] to try to balance a very difficult situation

[33:52] and to try to make amends.

[33:56] And at the end of the day, John internally is a designer.

[34:00] He gets along well with everyone.

[34:02] There are some days that are a little bit more difficult

[34:04] than others, but I think he's a creative genius

[34:10] who has a certain style.

[34:12] We want that style as a part of our platform.

[34:14] And I have a personal commitment that Magic Girl and Raza

[34:17] and AIW will be amazing machines that a lot of people

[34:22] want to grace their houses with.

[34:25] After we have our final touches on them

[34:28] to bring the back down to Earth,

[34:30] but still amazing works of art in their own right.

[34:35] So a couple of questions I have, Robert,

[34:38] is so the first part when you talk about,

[34:40] you saw the J-pop's, the way sort of quagmire

[34:44] that he got himself in and you saw the angry buyers

[34:48] who weren't getting games.

[34:49] And you've decided to take money out of your pocket

[34:51] to give some sort of restitution to those

[34:54] who have been impacted.

[34:56] Now I guess the question I have is like,

[34:57] what was the why, right?

[34:59] When you're starting your company

[35:00] and you have to ask, like, why do that

[35:04] when you could start with a clean slate?

[35:05] Like what did you see in those games in particular, right?

[35:09] Because you could even have John come on board

[35:11] and just design a new game

[35:13] and not have to even worry about the old baggage.

[35:17] But what was it you saw in Magic Girl or Raza or Alice?

[35:21] And Wonderland that said, you know what?

[35:23] This is gonna be worth it.

[35:26] Yeah, that's a hard one to answer

[35:28] because I have some bias feelings about that.

[35:31] I mean, these have now become my games in many way.

[35:34] They're my personal passion to see these games

[35:38] through to fruition and to do what no other person

[35:41] or pinball company could ever do.

[35:43] And that is to get J-pop focused on what J-pop does best

[35:48] and to bring these games to customers

[35:51] who, many of them, who want to see them,

[35:54] who want to play them and experience those

[35:56] very, very unique, diverse worlds.

[36:00] I think there was a lot of discussion back

[36:03] when we first started wondering

[36:05] whether J-pop was the right designer to start with.

[36:08] But you have to roll with the punches.

[36:10] I mean, at that time, there weren't any designers available

[36:13] or willing to come on board.

[36:16] I think over time, as we've continued to prove ourselves

[36:19] and bring people in and show them what we're doing

[36:21] and they get all excited.

[36:22] I think it's been a lot easier to get more and more designers

[36:25] who want a very loving collaborative home here at DeepRoot

[36:29] and just want to have fun making great pinball machines.

[36:33] And I think that we've made that very honest

[36:36] and open pitch to all of the designers.

[36:38] And I think even if we hadn't started with John or J-pop,

[36:43] I think that we would have ended up taking him on anyway.

[36:47] I mean, I still think that John has a lot to give

[36:52] to the industry.

[36:53] I don't think that some people will ever forgive him

[36:57] and that's their right.

[36:59] They have the absolute right to do that.

[37:01] But for us, J-pop has a place here.

[37:04] That his style and his creativity really has been

[37:08] an energy behind the scenes to try to create some amazing

[37:13] designs.

[37:13] Right.

[37:14] Have you ever had moments?

[37:15] So if you look at John's career, I mean,

[37:19] he hasn't had a ton of games, but the games he has put out

[37:23] into the world have always been very celebrated

[37:25] and his time at Valley Williams was a moment where he brought

[37:30] a lot of magic into the pinball world.

[37:32] Have you ever asked him, Robert, like John,

[37:33] like what was it like?

[37:34] Like, your designer, he's a great art director.

[37:38] You know, whether or not he's good at doing the mechanisms

[37:41] or the engineering of some of the things in a game

[37:43] has, do you find it hard for him to be honest about where

[37:47] his abilities stop and where he needs a team of people

[37:51] to help him and almost remove him at some point

[37:54] from the process to get the game done?

[37:56] Because we heard a lot of that occur to Valley Williams.

[37:58] We're like, you know, there was a point where people just

[38:01] need to take it from him and finish it.

[38:03] Do you feel like you're there with the Zidware games

[38:07] or like, what's it been like?

[38:09] So I'll answer two separate issues that you brought up.

[38:13] First about Williams Valley was a very

[38:15] caustic, nasty, competitive, destructive, corporate culture

[38:22] when it came to designs.

[38:24] So that is not a place that I would see, you know,

[38:27] a personality like J-pop who is, you know,

[38:31] more eccentric in shining.

[38:33] And I think that a lot of the stories you hear were just

[38:36] because he just was so different and didn't fit into

[38:39] the, to that corporate culture.

[38:41] And, you know, from Barry and Dennis and, you know,

[38:45] other people who, you know, were in that machine,

[38:48] they, I mean, even today Dennis was in town

[38:50] and he was telling me how amazing, you know,

[38:52] it is here at Deeper compared to the Williams Valley days

[38:57] and how open a collaborative and fun it is now

[39:00] instead of being secretive and, you know, and nasty.

[39:04] And so as we fast forward to the current environment

[39:07] with which John, John, like everyone else

[39:10] is going to fight for his passion.

[39:11] I mean, he really thinks that, you know,

[39:14] certain things should go a certain way.

[39:16] And if you push back, I mean, he's, he's going to fight

[39:19] for his passion.

[39:20] I would expect that from everyone.

[39:21] I mean, I do the same.

[39:23] I mean, many times people have come up and told me

[39:26] parts of my, you know, vision is just not going to work.

[39:29] And I'm going to push back because it's my passion.

[39:33] And so I don't begrudge him, the ability to do that,

[39:38] what I'm not going to allow is for him to take down morale

[39:45] or to override an engineer when it's the engineers purview

[39:50] or to, you know, torpedo the company itself

[39:55] when it comes to whether or not this game

[39:57] is going to be a successful game or not.

[39:59] But I think overall, those are small little side arguments

[40:04] that we quickly resolve and we move on.

[40:06] I mean, otherwise, you know, John, when he's here,

[40:09] is just like anyone else.

[40:11] He's here early, he leaves late.

[40:14] He's passionate about deep root pinball.

[40:16] He's passionate about his designs.

[40:19] And he's focused on getting back to business

[40:24] and the role that I think he even realizes he needs to be in.

[40:27] Right.

[40:28] How often is he there?

[40:31] I'm not going to talk about that because of the litigation,

[40:33] but he typically,

[40:36] does not work when he's in Illinois.

[40:38] So he does try to come for sprints as much as he can

[40:43] because all of the work he does is basically here in Texas.

[40:45] Okay.

[40:46] When he's not here, he's not a part of the process.

[40:49] And for John, that's, you know, that's almost like,

[40:51] you know, slow, painful death.

[40:53] Right.

[40:53] He's just so passionate about pinball.

[40:55] So, right.

[40:57] But anyway, that's, that's the answer I'm going to give out.

[40:59] Okay.

[41:00] And, you know, I mean, you, deep root is his,

[41:04] I want to say his third chance to get these games into the homes.

[41:09] And look, people want these games.

[41:10] I mean, I've said it from day one.

[41:11] I mean, either there's not a pinball person out there

[41:14] that doesn't look at these games and say,

[41:16] I don't want it.

[41:17] I mean, they just want it to work.

[41:18] And so I'm curious as one of the,

[41:20] I feel like I'm one of the very few people

[41:22] that's actually stood over a magic girl for hours.

[41:25] What it's been like unraveling that game, Robert.

[41:29] And you said like to bring the games back down to earth.

[41:32] So there's clearly things that might have been over ambitious

[41:35] by John that might not just physically work, right?

[41:38] So where's the current state of,

[41:42] let's just think, talk magic girl.

[41:44] Like where's the current state of getting the game back down

[41:48] to a place where it's still going to be a beautiful sexy

[41:50] J-pop game, but it's going to function.

[41:55] Right.

[41:56] So the, the great thing about the way that we develop here is

[41:59] we take largely the role that was left to the designer

[42:03] and in other companies and in prior companies.

[42:07] And we give it to other people.

[42:08] So it's more of a collaborative team effort.

[42:11] So Quinn is, is basically our storyboarder and scripter.

[42:16] And so he's come up with a very alternate, diverse

[42:20] use of the magic girl universe.

[42:23] And then we have our artists and our animators

[42:25] that then come into the process and understand the scope

[42:28] and the direction that we want to take for something like that.

[42:31] Then we bring in our mechanical engineers in our texts

[42:34] and we basically, you know, strip magic girl to its core

[42:39] and rebuild it again.

[42:40] And a lot of the things that John didn't get right

[42:44] or things on the list that we tackle

[42:47] as we rebuild it from the ground up.

[42:49] We want to try to keep the magic girl experience

[42:54] with, with generally in the direction that John wanted to go.

[42:58] But we fully realize that the only way the magic girl

[43:01] is going to be an amazing machine and be graced

[43:04] in customer's houses is if we create the best magic girl

[43:08] out there possible.

[43:10] And so as we've looked at some of these mech issues,

[43:12] we've come up with some unique design,

[43:16] unique designs to kind of solve some of them.

[43:17] And others we've just taken out just because it's not worth it

[43:20] to distract from an amazing pinball experience

[43:24] with things that just don't feel right and don't work

[43:26] and don't click with that theme and in the layout.

[43:30] Right.

[43:31] Any of the, can you speak to any of that

[43:33] or am I spoiling the reveal when it's, you know,

[43:37] when you do it?

[43:38] And any mech set we know that, I'm always

[43:41] curious about that big middle levitation chamber

[43:44] where the ball shoots up the middle between the ramp

[43:47] and is supposed to be held by the automaton.

[43:50] Is that, have you guys been able to figure out any of John's

[43:54] use of magnets in the game?

[43:55] Or was it just too hard to get some of that stuff work in?

[43:59] Yeah, I mean, I think JJPs,

[44:02] Concentric Circles is a good example of something

[44:07] that probably should have been left on the, you know,

[44:09] the cutting room floor before it was shown to the public.

[44:14] I think this is another example of something

[44:16] the way it was engineered just didn't work.

[44:19] I think we have probably four or five different ways now

[44:21] that we've kind of figured out how we're going to get a ball

[44:23] to levitate in mid-air without it shooting out of the glass

[44:27] like a cannon or we're dainting the play field under it.

[44:31] So we're moving forward.

[44:33] If we can't get it to work at the end of the day,

[44:35] we can't get it to work, but it's never been done

[44:37] ever in the history of pinball.

[44:40] And so we're almost everything we're doing

[44:43] has never been done in the history of pinball.

[44:44] So that's why the five days of deep regret,

[44:47] I think people are going to either check themselves

[44:50] into an insane asylum because they just can't take it.

[44:53] Or they're going to see the next century pinball change

[44:57] and never look back.

[44:58] So I think this mech is a good example

[45:01] of how people might react to the innovation

[45:05] that we're putting into these machines

[45:07] to do a lot of things that have never been done before

[45:09] in unique engineering ways.

[45:11] Right.

[45:12] It's very exciting to hear because I've always believed

[45:14] to that, you know, John's games are visually stunning

[45:19] and you don't need too much magic to make them magical.

[45:22] And I think we've seen that with a lot of his older titles.

[45:26] There's not a ton going on,

[45:27] but even just like the disappearing magnet gene,

[45:30] you know, in front of the genie on on Toden,

[45:32] just that stuff I feel like is missing

[45:35] from a lot of modern pinball and just thinking about

[45:38] the different things a ball can do under the glass

[45:40] that make people go wow.

[45:42] And that to me is what I think is missing

[45:44] from a lot of modern pinball.

[45:46] So I'm excited to hear you guys are tackling it

[45:49] and also incorporating a lot of that magic.

[45:51] So let's talk about the five days of deeper

[45:55] because then what we can expect.

[45:56] Because I know, you know, I obviously don't expect you

[45:58] to give away a lot, but when this is gonna happen

[46:02] around TPS 2019, how many games are you guys planning

[46:06] to show?

[46:07] Are we gonna see any magic girls or rosas?

[46:10] Like what do you do know?

[46:12] We know that the ziwhere games exist.

[46:13] So we could ask like if we're gonna see those.

[46:15] That's not spoiling whether it's, you know,

[46:17] we don't know the other titles.

[46:18] So, so magic girl and Rosas will be in the initial launch.

[46:25] Alice and Wonderland will not.

[46:27] Okay.

[46:27] And how are you guys, and Robert, you've looked

[46:30] at the marketplace and you see that, you know,

[46:32] collectors and limited editions and collectors editions,

[46:36] there is disability to make different versions of games

[46:39] and you've been on the record for saying

[46:41] there might even be a $50,000 Alice and Wonderland.

[46:45] So how are you guys gonna handle knowing what you know

[46:47] about the market, collectors desires

[46:50] to have like limited edition games?

[46:54] You know, I've always approached pinball very differently

[46:57] than the other companies.

[46:59] And I think this is gonna be a very interesting

[47:04] period to see after we launch,

[47:07] how the other companies react, whether they follow suit

[47:10] or whether they just try to compete and lose essentially

[47:13] to, you know, our concept of design and sourcing

[47:21] and marketing, the types titles we have,

[47:25] the price variations and the future variations.

[47:29] So it's really hard to kind of talk about that

[47:33] without, you know, going through the five days of deep route

[47:37] and what we're gonna do because there's definitely

[47:39] a competitive advantage there.

[47:41] How many games do you have for our market?

[47:43] If TPS five days or four, I'm always curious.

[47:47] Are there five?

[47:48] I mean, the fifth day of deep route,

[47:50] which is what we promised will be TPS.

[47:52] Oh, okay.

[47:53] I do not know if we're leading up to it.

[47:55] Four days that preceded it will be at the beginning

[47:57] of the year or it will be right before TPS.

[48:00] It really depends on, we have a very ambitious launch

[48:06] that we have planned while it would be nice to get everything

[48:11] that we want at launch.

[48:12] Sometimes, you know, reality sets in.

[48:14] And so we have some contingency plans to maybe do a little less

[48:18] here or there.

[48:18] And so it really depends how we get through the rest

[48:21] of the year, get the manufacturing ability up,

[48:24] manufacture a bunch of games, make sure everything,

[48:26] all the, you know, bells or whistles are there

[48:28] and all the kinks are out of the system.

[48:31] Before we decide to move forward with the beginning,

[48:34] four days of deeper, but the fifth day of deeper

[48:36] will be TPS 2019.

[48:38] Okay.

[48:39] So they're not consecutive days.

[48:40] They're going to be five sort of milestone moments

[48:43] that culminate with a reveal of product at TPS.

[48:48] Sort of, I mean, I guess that's really a good idea

[48:51] if I could steal it from you, but you know, in my mind,

[48:55] more of the five days of deeper is more of revealing

[48:59] to the world, both in person and in, you know,

[49:03] social media and audiovisual.

[49:07] All the innovations we've done behind the scenes

[49:09] and why we're passionate about Pemball

[49:11] and what we've done about it and what we're releasing

[49:14] to the world for their enjoyment.

[49:16] So how we do those four days, whether they're consecutive

[49:20] and we do maybe a 30 minute vignette each day

[49:23] or whether they're spread out over a couple months,

[49:26] I really haven't made a decision yet.

[49:27] I just know that the five days of deep root

[49:30] really culminate in the five different areas

[49:33] that I really want to focus on in making all of the guys

[49:37] that bought into this vision of mine

[49:40] and making them shine.

[49:41] And letting people know that there's a lot of great people

[49:44] talented people behind the scenes here

[49:46] who are working night and day to make my vision come to market

[49:52] and to create some great Pemball machines.

[49:55] You know, and Robert, we've talked a lot about John,

[49:57] but I do want to talk about the larger company

[50:00] because you've got a lot of people over there, as you said.

[50:02] You have other designers.

[50:04] Walk me through the other things that are being worked on.

[50:08] So we have got Barry, you've got Dennis Norman.

[50:12] You have another designer as well.

[50:14] Is it John?

[50:14] Am I making this up?

[50:15] John Norse?

[50:16] John Norse, right?

[50:17] So are they each working on their own projects?

[50:20] And if so, you've seen firsthand the power

[50:24] that a theme has to create demand in this hobby.

[50:27] It's something I harp on all the time on this show.

[50:29] How would, so are they each working on their own things?

[50:33] How did you guys come to the conclusion

[50:34] of what the first titles would be that they would work on?

[50:39] I think that was a very collaborative effort.

[50:41] I think that I kind of had a vision of different themes

[50:45] that I wanted to see.

[50:47] And at the end of the day, the designers have

[50:53] been more industrious than I probably would have liked

[50:57] because they're constantly asking for something new to do.

[51:00] So at times, I've even had to start inventing things

[51:03] for the designers to do, just because they're working

[51:05] so fast and so well and efficiently.

[51:09] I think that Pennball is a step to many other tech projects

[51:14] that we want to do.

[51:16] But it's the best first one in many ways

[51:20] from a business and development side

[51:22] to also just a fun side.

[51:25] And...

[51:26] Are there any license themes alongside the original Zidware titles

[51:30] or is it all going to be original IP to kick things off?

[51:35] Nope, it will be a mix of license and unlicense.

[51:38] And we've talked behind the scenes about the process

[51:42] of getting a license.

[51:43] And I may be wrong at times when I assume

[51:47] that it's easy to get a license.

[51:48] And we just saw a story this week

[51:50] that stern out bid spooky for the Godzilla license.

[51:54] What do you think, who do you think leaked that story?

[52:01] Was it you?

[52:02] Absolutely, I was very upset.

[52:09] I reached out to Charlie because I wanted to help him.

[52:13] We have an amazing licensing person

[52:15] who goes back almost as far as Roger does,

[52:19] but more in the toy world.

[52:21] Our licensing agent is very good at what she does.

[52:24] She's been able to pull a lot of strings

[52:25] for a lot of big licenses for us,

[52:28] for a company that isn't even manufacturing

[52:30] pinball machines yet.

[52:31] So we definitely, I could write a whole book

[52:34] on getting into pinball licensing as a side note.

[52:39] Probably make even more money

[52:40] than selling pinball machines.

[52:41] But anyway, I was very disappointed by that.

[52:46] So I basically reached out to Charlie

[52:51] and asked him if he wanted me to go to bat forum.

[52:54] And I'm going to let him comment whether he wants to

[53:01] or not on his response.

[53:02] But I reached out to, because Jeff this week

[53:07] and pinball had reached out to me and asked me

[53:09] if I knew anything.

[53:10] And I basically just see how it's confirmed.

[53:13] And because we were actually interested in the Godzilla

[53:17] as well for the new movie coming out

[53:19] and doing a deal with legendary.

[53:21] So unfortunately, everything is shut down.

[53:24] And it was confirmed to us.

[53:25] So at this point, it's a dead issue.

[53:29] But we've been very lucky to get some other very big,

[53:32] very big licenses under our belts.

[53:36] And we're in a bidding war of our own

[53:38] on another really big one.

[53:40] So we're really excited about doing some licensing,

[53:44] some good licenses, and then also bringing some unlicensed titles

[53:47] back into it.

[53:48] So how does the bidding war work?

[53:49] Is it a silent bid auction where you don't know

[53:54] what the other guy is?

[53:55] You get a second right of a second attempt

[53:59] to go over what they say the other bid is?

[54:02] What's it like?

[54:03] Licensing should be criminal or an ethical at best.

[54:08] It is absolutely just a wild west of IP

[54:16] because the licenseors have all of the power.

[54:21] There's no confidentiality whatsoever.

[54:25] So if someone really wanted to figure out what licenses we have,

[54:28] they wouldn't take very long for them to call around.

[54:30] And I mean, most of these licenseors will just tell you straight

[54:33] out.

[54:35] And there's no rhyme or reason to anything a license or want.

[54:38] So I mean, it could be that it could be a silent auction.

[54:42] It could be that they tell the other person

[54:44] and try to get the biggest bid just

[54:46] because that's what the licenseer is there to do.

[54:49] It could be where, hey, do you screw you?

[54:52] You don't have any machines.

[54:53] And we're just going to go with someone else who does.

[54:55] It was already manufacturing.

[54:57] We've heard it all.

[54:58] We've seen it all.

[54:58] And so unfortunately, it could be any of the above.

[55:04] Sounds like a very corrupt process that lends itself

[55:09] to a lot of bribery and shenanigans.

[55:12] So yeah, it sucks.

[55:14] I mean, I don't mean wrong.

[55:14] I just want to say we've worked with some great companies

[55:17] and great members behind the scenes with licensing.

[55:20] And they're plugged into the same unfair system

[55:24] as everyone else is.

[55:25] And so I don't want to leave with a sour taste

[55:29] that we're ungrateful because we're very grateful.

[55:31] We've had a lot of companies, big brands,

[55:35] put a lot of trust in us.

[55:36] And we're very appreciative.

[55:37] And we want to make them a lot of money

[55:39] and make the best product that they're very proud of.

[55:42] And hey, look, Stern's so different.

[55:46] But I think that there's ways to use the system.

[55:50] And there's ways to be more ethical with it.

[55:53] So at the end of the day, I know what we're going to do here

[55:57] at Deep Root.

[55:57] So.

[55:58] Right.

[55:59] Is there, I just have to ask, a big trouble in the old China.

[56:01] Is that on any list of potential themes

[56:04] that you guys would consider?

[56:05] Because I keep saying it would sell.

[56:07] But unless someone makes it, we'll never know.

[56:12] Yeah, I mean, I think that you've brought up

[56:13] a lot of mainly 80 themes that would be good.

[56:18] I think that a lot of these things,

[56:21] and the problem with licensing is there are all kind

[56:25] of hiccups you could have, right?

[56:27] So you could get something like a big trouble a little China.

[56:29] But if you can't get Kurt Russell to sign off on it,

[56:32] if there's not already, you know,

[56:33] it's a vault edition, for instance.

[56:35] And what's the point of making a big trouble

[56:37] with China without Kurt Russell or Kim Katroule, et cetera?

[56:41] So one of the big problems in licensing

[56:43] is trying to go in to find something that you can afford.

[56:46] That you think that you're going to be able to sell enough

[56:48] to make some money off of.

[56:50] And then you got to start worried about whether the company

[56:51] really wants the license that are not

[56:53] is going to be more of an impediment,

[56:55] or they're going to be your champion.

[56:57] And then lastly, when it comes to actually getting the rights,

[57:01] are the rights available?

[57:03] And are they available to the extent

[57:05] where it makes sense to move forward

[57:06] if you can't get some of the rights that are critical

[57:09] to that license?

[57:11] I mean, it's a very difficult quagmire

[57:14] to try to go through in pinball,

[57:17] because not all licenses for instance Harry Potter

[57:21] are available to pinball.

[57:22] And then you start getting to these other issues.

[57:24] So eventually we're going to get to a point

[57:26] where all the big licenses are done with.

[57:29] And it's going to get a lot more competitive

[57:32] to really secure high dollar licenses

[57:35] for future pinball games.

[57:37] Absolutely.

[57:37] I mean, I think we're already starting to see that.

[57:41] So let me show you a question, Robert,

[57:42] because this is on this topic.

[57:44] Do you think Jersey Jack should have pursued

[57:47] pirates of the Caribbean once they

[57:49] learned of the significant restrictions

[57:52] to that license of can't use the main character,

[57:54] can't use a theme song, can't use any clips

[57:56] from all the movies with, you know, it seems like

[57:59] they didn't get much and they still decided to make it.

[58:04] Yeah, so I mean, Jack and I kind of had

[58:09] brief conversations back in 2015.

[58:11] And he kind of told me what he thought about my kind of vision

[58:13] for a JGP back then.

[58:15] And he's done well since.

[58:16] And so I don't want to comment just because I don't want

[58:19] to rehash that.

[58:21] I wouldn't have done pirates of the Caribbean.

[58:24] But I hope he at least makes some money off of it.

[58:28] And it's not a loss.

[58:29] I mean, at this point, I just don't know

[58:31] what's going on behind the scenes.

[58:33] I wish them the best.

[58:34] I've played it.

[58:35] I think it's a very, very detailed game.

[58:38] It would have been nice had they've

[58:39] been able to keep the concentric circles,

[58:41] because I really like that feature.

[58:44] But at the end of the day, Jack is going

[58:47] to do the best he can with that license.

[58:48] Maybe that was the best license he had at the time.

[58:52] I don't know if it was a passion license for Eric.

[58:56] But sometimes you're given a tough hand,

[59:01] and you've got to make the best of the hand you have.

[59:04] And it's not an easy thing to do.

[59:07] So I know behind the scenes not only just

[59:10] from the licensing point of view, but I also know

[59:14] what goes into making a design and eventually

[59:16] a manufacturer as well, because we've

[59:18] been going through that process as well.

[59:20] How difficult it is.

[59:21] And all the pitfalls you have at every step

[59:22] throughout the process, where things could go really wrong.

[59:26] I guess what always perplexes me, Robert,

[59:28] is it's not like you're given a theme you have to make.

[59:33] A company goes out and actively seeks a license,

[59:37] and then they decide if they can get enough to make it.

[59:41] And sometimes I feel like that's what perplexes me

[59:43] about some of these pinball licenses.

[59:44] If you don't get enough, I always

[59:46] feel like there needs to be a checklist of if we don't

[59:49] get enough of this stuff.

[59:52] Let's move on to something where we can get a little bit more.

[59:53] But we won't.

[59:54] Another question I have to you, Robert,

[59:55] because you guys have the advantage of in 2018.

[59:59] You probably have a good five years of market research

[01:00:04] at your disposal around the right way

[01:00:07] to reveal a game, launch a game, and put a game out there

[01:00:11] to maximize sales, especially the sales window early on.

[01:00:16] And we've seen everything from the Stern approach, which

[01:00:19] seems to be the most successful.

[01:00:20] You don't show your cards until the game will ship within two

[01:00:26] months to Jersey Jack, where it's almost going to be a year

[01:00:29] now since we've seen pirates.

[01:00:30] And the excitement starts to wane big time

[01:00:34] the more you make people wait.

[01:00:36] What can we expect from Deeproot in terms of reveal

[01:00:40] to shipment, and how long that window will be?

[01:00:42] The very first part of our project that will be some of which

[01:00:55] will be disclosed of five days of Deeproot is tens of pages

[01:00:59] long and very intricate detail.

[01:01:03] And one of the very first sections that I came up with was

[01:01:06] the marketing section.

[01:01:07] So yes, it has perplexed me that, again,

[01:01:11] so many of the manufacturers, including the big boy

[01:01:14] in the block, Stern, continued to make so many mistakes

[01:01:19] and are successful despite themselves.

[01:01:22] I think it's going to be a little different when you have

[01:01:23] someone who has really put a lot of thought

[01:01:25] into marketing pinball, expanding pinball,

[01:01:29] redefining pinball.

[01:01:30] I think it's going to be kind of hard to catch up

[01:01:33] at that point and from a marketing standpoint

[01:01:36] to try to match.

[01:01:38] I mean, some of that, I mean, like you said,

[01:01:40] for five years of market advantage

[01:01:43] in looking what other people have done in their mistakes.

[01:01:45] I mean, imagine if someone really gets their marketing

[01:01:47] right, you could be four to five years

[01:01:49] where you have to kind of tread water to try to get your marketing

[01:01:53] back up to a level that will remain in the minds of customers

[01:01:59] who you desperately want to buy your games.

[01:02:03] And so marketing has been one of the things that I started

[01:02:06] with, and it's going to be one of the things that I think

[01:02:09] people are going to see is going to be varied.

[01:02:11] It's going to be a marketing in that we're doing a lot of gimmicks

[01:02:15] and we're trying to pull the wool over our customers' eyes

[01:02:18] and we're just pushing pinball left and right.

[01:02:20] I think it's going to be more of a bargain proposition.

[01:02:24] Why buy a machine from another company

[01:02:26] that doesn't have all these innovations

[01:02:28] and you can't, it's not a deeper machine, right?

[01:02:31] I think that is probably going to be one of the biggest

[01:02:33] upfront marketing challenges that a lot of other companies

[01:02:37] are going to have to face.

[01:02:39] But you can't deny the success within selling pinball machines.

[01:02:45] The shorter the window from reveal to shipment

[01:02:49] has always been beneficial.

[01:02:51] There's never been a case where like waiting

[01:02:54] a really long time helped us.

[01:02:56] So I'm just curious, like within your marketing,

[01:03:01] are you, is there any concern that you might show too much

[01:03:04] that's not quite, that's not ready to manufacture

[01:03:07] in the short term?

[01:03:08] Or because part of your desire must be to show like,

[01:03:12] like a lot of impact of what we're planning,

[01:03:15] but you must be weighing, how much do we show now

[01:03:20] and how much do we hold back because that game

[01:03:23] might not ship for a year?

[01:03:25] So we're planning to do a little reveal at Expo,

[01:03:27] but since I don't think Rob has put up

[01:03:31] the seminar description, I don't want to steal his thunder.

[01:03:35] But it's just a small glimpse into what to expect

[01:03:39] and it'll be our last formal communication

[01:03:41] before the five days of deep root.

[01:03:44] I'm gonna answer your question the best way I can

[01:03:46] and that is to be very succinct in that.

[01:03:49] I have no intention of being in trap

[01:03:52] in the pit of releasing something before it's ready to ship.

[01:04:00] I fully believe that pinball machines,

[01:04:03] a large amount of the sales are impulse buys

[01:04:06] and I would love to fulfill that need to take pocket

[01:04:10] out of a, take the money out of a pocket

[01:04:13] and give them a great product and return.

[01:04:16] And so our intent is when we launch a game

[01:04:20] and someone comes to buy it,

[01:04:21] that they're gonna have that game shipped in two weeks or less.

[01:04:25] And I've stood by that from the beginning

[01:04:28] and I'm gonna continue to stand by that.

[01:04:30] And if they don't get it in two weeks,

[01:04:32] we're gonna start giving them money for us

[01:04:36] not fulfilling the promise that we made.

[01:04:38] So, well, I mean, but you've gotta,

[01:04:41] is that realistic?

[01:04:44] Let's say you get 500 orders for match or curl, right on day one.

[01:04:50] Two weeks to the first customer gets it,

[01:04:52] but there's gonna have to be a little bit of weight.

[01:04:53] And I think people don't mind that.

[01:04:55] But I've noticed in the industry is,

[01:04:57] people know that they might have to get online

[01:05:00] just because of the realistic nature of manufacturing, right?

[01:05:02] So the first people will get it in two weeks,

[01:05:06] but there might still be a weight, right?

[01:05:07] I mean, how many games,

[01:05:10] you can't get everyone a game in two weeks.

[01:05:12] Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that we'll have, you know,

[01:05:15] I really don't know how I wanna approach something like that.

[01:05:18] I mean, there's a lot of different ways.

[01:05:19] I mean, the easiest way would be just to,

[01:05:21] just only have the games that are available to ship

[01:05:23] in two weeks and then, you know, wait list.

[01:05:27] I fully intend before we release a game

[01:05:29] that we will already have had manufactured

[01:05:32] behind the scenes what we think would be a good lead

[01:05:37] into sales without going overboard.

[01:05:40] So there's lots of ways you can deal with that issue.

[01:05:42] But yes, you're right.

[01:05:43] I mean, it takes time to build a pinball machine.

[01:05:45] And if you get a lot of orders and interest in a machine

[01:05:51] that, you know, you might, in a worst-case scenario,

[01:05:54] have some lead time.

[01:05:57] I want that lead time to be as short as possible

[01:05:59] and we've tried to balance that with giving the customer

[01:06:03] the better end of the bargain

[01:06:04] if there's gonna be a long lead time.

[01:06:06] Sure.

[01:06:07] And I think Andrew Highway is run two weeks forever

[01:06:10] within the time ball marking world.

[01:06:12] So you might wanna just say three weeks to be saved.

[01:06:15] So, so real quick about that is I actually heard that

[01:06:19] after I had actually made that statement, then realized,

[01:06:21] oh, so who was stealing from who, I guess, but anyway.

[01:06:25] No, I didn't even know that Andrew had said that

[01:06:28] when I first said it.

[01:06:29] But two weeks is a reasonable amount of time

[01:06:31] for us to make a pinball machine for someone

[01:06:34] and to get it shipped out to them.

[01:06:36] And so I think it's a very doable thing on our ends.

[01:06:39] Robert, let me ask you a question about

[01:06:41] some of the themes that have been out there in the world

[01:06:44] because I know you've provided some commentary

[01:06:46] on trying to help Baron Yop get the big LaVao ski

[01:06:50] out into the world because we know there's demand there.

[01:06:52] We know there's demand for the alien theme.

[01:06:54] We know there was even demand for predator.

[01:06:57] Seeing some of these themes and seeing them be associated

[01:07:01] with failed attempts to actually get them

[01:07:04] into market properly.

[01:07:07] And you commented on this about meeting with Baron Yop

[01:07:10] about potentially helping them out.

[01:07:13] Are you, would you consider because we know people love

[01:07:16] these themes a chance to kind of get them made properly

[01:07:19] at deep root within your platform and in your approach?

[01:07:25] So I'm not going to talk about the specifics

[01:07:29] that I spoke with them about.

[01:07:32] But I would say that if we were to approach this

[01:07:36] just from a logistical point of view,

[01:07:38] it would be very difficult to make the games

[01:07:41] as they currently exist using our platform.

[01:07:45] There would have to be some changes,

[01:07:48] probably some substantial changes.

[01:07:52] Versus something that was meant to be designed

[01:07:55] using our platform and format.

[01:07:59] So I think there's some problems there.

[01:08:00] I also think that, you know,

[01:08:02] licensors are not living in a vacuum

[01:08:04] that licensors very much dislike when their brand is subject

[01:08:13] to these issues.

[01:08:15] And I'm just going to admit it is huge

[01:08:17] because I mean, these are pretty serious

[01:08:20] transgressions that have been committed

[01:08:23] and the brand's didn't ask for it and they don't deserve it.

[01:08:27] So it might even be that some of these brands

[01:08:29] might not even be available anymore.

[01:08:31] Right.

[01:08:32] They might just be putting them out.

[01:08:33] I want to do pinball again because of the experience

[01:08:35] the first time around.

[01:08:36] And to be honest, you know, look, every licensor we've gone to

[01:08:39] we've had to really sell why they should, you know,

[01:08:42] choose deeper.

[01:08:44] And we've even had, you know, sterns like,

[01:08:46] like, we've been asked over and over again.

[01:08:47] It's not a secret.

[01:08:49] Why shouldn't we just go with stern?

[01:08:50] Well, you know, I have some really good answers

[01:08:52] that have really turned some heads

[01:08:53] and won some deals.

[01:08:57] But at the end of the day, when you have, you know,

[01:09:00] a licensor whose experiences in pinball,

[01:09:02] it doesn't matter who you are,

[01:09:05] it might be a mile too far at that point.

[01:09:09] So, and I don't know about alien

[01:09:11] and I don't know about the big Lebowski.

[01:09:13] I don't think either, I think alien speaks more to me

[01:09:16] than the big Lebowski does,

[01:09:17] even though I do like the movie.

[01:09:20] As far as a pinball, but I think it's already been done.

[01:09:22] I mean, I think there's so many other opportunities

[01:09:24] for deep root to, and stories and visions

[01:09:28] for us to go down past four

[01:09:30] that we really don't even need to rehash that.

[01:09:32] Right.

[01:09:33] There's so many images.

[01:09:34] Fred and there's another example of a movie I really liked

[01:09:37] and it's unfortunate how it turned out,

[01:09:39] but at this point, what's done is done.

[01:09:42] Right.

[01:09:43] Yeah, no, I sort of agree.

[01:09:45] I mean, it's, there's so many other,

[01:09:48] even good Schwarzenegger movies out there,

[01:09:50] sci-fi films out there that you could start a new

[01:09:52] without having to erase people's memories

[01:09:56] of the bad launches.

[01:09:58] So, Robert, what's curious to me too

[01:10:00] about the current pinball marketplace,

[01:10:01] because there's a lot of competition, right?

[01:10:03] And I'm always, I'm always like perplexed as to like,

[01:10:07] how long it actually does take a pinball company to die

[01:10:10] when they clearly have run the business into the ground

[01:10:13] where the money's gone.

[01:10:14] I just saw a note from Barry and Yop today

[01:10:18] where it's a pinball company.

[01:10:20] You wanna make a game, you wanna put a product

[01:10:22] in people's homes when the money evaporates

[01:10:25] because of mismanagement and legal problems.

[01:10:29] It sucks the life out of the hobby.

[01:10:31] And I think, you know, why do you think

[01:10:34] that happens in this hobby in particular?

[01:10:37] Cause I follow a lot of stuff like cars

[01:10:39] and other interesting areas.

[01:10:41] I've never seen the ability for companies to hang on

[01:10:44] as long as they do without just saying it's done.

[01:10:49] You know, like our attempt to do this

[01:10:51] is not gonna work out the money's gone.

[01:10:53] But people are still holding on to a lot of these companies.

[01:10:58] That's a tough one.

[01:10:59] I think there's some functional reasons

[01:11:02] as in legal that a lot of people let them get away

[01:11:05] from it, away with it.

[01:11:08] There's also probably a side where government authorities

[01:11:13] who usually step in in a situation like this

[01:11:16] and many industries isn't of course present

[01:11:18] in a pinball in only the US but other countries.

[01:11:22] I think that a lot of businesses limp on in other industries.

[01:11:27] So I think that this is kind of normal

[01:11:31] in some ways even if it's in the pinball industry.

[01:11:34] But I think that a lot of people in the pinball industry

[01:11:37] also allow it to happen.

[01:11:39] And I think that even though a lot of people would probably

[01:11:45] argue that we've turned a corner and known will ever throw money

[01:11:48] down on a project like the several that have come and gone,

[01:11:53] I think it's right for people to forget.

[01:11:57] And there's likely to be a time

[01:11:59] where this is gonna happen again.

[01:12:01] I think it's just this human nature

[01:12:04] and it's how these things kind of go about.

[01:12:06] I mean, it's perplexing to us.

[01:12:08] And we at Deep Rude have tried to do things

[01:12:12] the right way from the beginning

[01:12:14] and not using other people's money

[01:12:16] and trying to keep things behind the scenes

[01:12:20] until we're ready to show.

[01:12:21] But at the end of the day,

[01:12:24] we're still subject to the same negative

[01:12:27] and destructive players in the industry as anyone else is.

[01:12:30] Right.

[01:12:32] Question, Robert, on the collector side,

[01:12:35] you're still a pinball fan and player and collector.

[01:12:38] If over the last two questions,

[01:12:41] do you still buy new inbox pinball machines

[01:12:43] and if you were to pick your favorite game

[01:12:45] that came out over the last two years,

[01:12:47] which one would it be?

[01:12:50] So I haven't, I wanted to buy a TNA from Charlie

[01:12:54] but that was kind of a funny back and forth on that one.

[01:12:57] That would be a game I would love to have.

[01:13:01] I've been too busy building our own designs recently

[01:13:03] and focusing on them to kind of want to buy anything.

[01:13:07] Not a big Iron Maiden fan or Guardians of the Galaxy

[01:13:10] or Star Wars or some of the others

[01:13:11] that have come out recently from Stern.

[01:13:13] In fact, the only Stern I own other than Ghostbusters

[01:13:16] which we have here for a specific reason

[01:13:18] at the office is the Ripley's,

[01:13:20] believe it or not, which I have at the house in.

[01:13:22] And it's actually one of my favorite games.

[01:13:26] But I'm not a big fan of a lot of their other kind of new

[01:13:29] inbox.

[01:13:30] I do have two Americas most haunted, not just one.

[01:13:33] That's another interesting story.

[01:13:35] I would love, yeah, I don't like the Hobbit.

[01:13:37] I know a lot of people love the Hobbit

[01:13:39] and I know that Jack is continuing to try to make

[01:13:43] it better and better and I give him props for that.

[01:13:46] But I'm just not a personal fan of a lot of things

[01:13:50] about the Hobbit, even though I love the theme.

[01:13:54] I would love to have a dialed in maybe one day.

[01:13:56] I played it on location once or twice.

[01:13:59] Both of them, there were broken components

[01:14:01] and balls that got stuck, which was kind of a bummer.

[01:14:05] But I think it was really inventive.

[01:14:08] I like some of Pat Lawler's stuff,

[01:14:10] so definitely a good one.

[01:14:13] As far as some of the other new boxes just not impressed.

[01:14:19] And I just can't wait to, most of my collection at home

[01:14:23] is 90s Williams Valley.

[01:14:25] So I can't wait to just start moving some of those.

[01:14:27] Maybe to the office to let some other people play,

[01:14:30] employees play with them while I wait to fill up

[01:14:33] the spaces at the house with some deeper games.

[01:14:36] Right.

[01:14:37] And see, let's talk about the Ghostbusters you have hanging up.

[01:14:43] What's the reason for it?

[01:14:44] I think you said it, but I still think it was...

[01:14:47] We were just doing a little trolling.

[01:14:50] Right.

[01:14:51] So anyway.

[01:14:53] Yeah, so the design of Ghostbusters.

[01:14:54] I still think Ghostbusters is one of the greatest themes

[01:14:57] ever for Pimball.

[01:14:57] And I think universally, the feedback on the game

[01:15:01] is it's one of the most beautiful machines.

[01:15:02] I mean, zombie Eddie Artwork on that brings it to life.

[01:15:05] It does have one of the most world on your glass

[01:15:07] looks to any stern, but then you go to shoot it

[01:15:10] and you're like, oh, why am I frustrated more

[01:15:13] than having fun?

[01:15:14] And I think that I am assuming is what you guys are looking at

[01:15:18] is what's wrong here from a design standpoint

[01:15:21] that could have made this game more fun.

[01:15:23] Yeah, so one quick thing.

[01:15:26] I do like Batman 66.

[01:15:27] I have played that quite a few times.

[01:15:30] I haven't played the...

[01:15:32] Was the SLE...

[01:15:34] They all play the same.

[01:15:35] They all play the same.

[01:15:36] Yeah.

[01:15:37] I mean, so anyway, it's a fun game.

[01:15:40] They did a good job with that game.

[01:15:41] So I'm gonna give props where props are warranted.

[01:15:44] But as far as Ghostbusters,

[01:15:46] just gonna sort of, that's just...

[01:15:47] I love the theme.

[01:15:49] I personally don't like the artwork.

[01:15:51] I know a lot of people like it,

[01:15:53] but I'm not real big on the artwork.

[01:15:56] So that's sort of a turn off for me.

[01:15:58] I would have preferred something a little bit more realistic.

[01:16:01] But anyway, as far as the play is concerned,

[01:16:03] I don't know, it's just not a layout

[01:16:05] that kind of speaks to me, you know?

[01:16:09] We have it right next to no good gofers,

[01:16:11] which is a real fun kind of quirky layout,

[01:16:14] though I know a lot of people are not real happy about it.

[01:16:16] But for me, I'm more of a quirky kind of layout kind of guy.

[01:16:20] So like my Fire and Brimstone design

[01:16:24] is a lot of flow and orbits.

[01:16:26] And that's something else that I really like.

[01:16:29] Like T2 from Steve Richie is a fun game

[01:16:34] that I like to play a lot.

[01:16:35] Just because I like fast action and flow.

[01:16:38] So Ghostbusters doesn't really have that for me.

[01:16:40] And so it's just one of those

[01:16:42] that a lot of my other guys like to play it.

[01:16:44] But I'm just not a big fan.

[01:16:45] Right.

[01:16:46] Well Robert, I really appreciate you coming on the show.

[01:16:49] We were at the hour point, which is usually where

[01:16:52] I keep this show where else I fall into the dead pinball

[01:16:56] two hour.

[01:16:56] I can do the Marty Laptrack for another hour and extended.

[01:16:59] But we'll keep it at an hour.

[01:17:01] I really appreciate you being the 250th guest.

[01:17:04] I appreciate that you listen to the show.

[01:17:06] I'm very curious and excited and anxious

[01:17:11] and looking forward to where things net out with Deeproot.

[01:17:15] I do think competition within this hobby is important.

[01:17:20] I do think people looking at pinball

[01:17:21] a little bit differently is important.

[01:17:24] We're playing a game that doesn't even have internet

[01:17:26] connectivity in 2018.

[01:17:28] There are areas of this game that could definitely

[01:17:34] use innovation.

[01:17:35] But you also can't innovate too much

[01:17:37] because people still want pinball.

[01:17:39] So I'm very curious to see how you balance those two things.

[01:17:43] And Robert, when's the next time we're

[01:17:46] going to get the official thing?

[01:17:47] Is it Expo?

[01:17:48] You said a little something will happen there?

[01:17:50] Yeah.

[01:17:52] I'll be at Expo with the other four designers.

[01:17:55] And we'll do a little Q&A and we'll

[01:18:00] give little teas here there to some things.

[01:18:05] And but that'll be our last formal communication

[01:18:08] before the five days in Deeproot.

[01:18:12] Later this year, early next year.

[01:18:14] And by the way, I kind of planned,

[01:18:17] I hope you get a laugh out of this because I made it in a Jovey

[01:18:20] away.

[01:18:21] But I was preparing for the interview today

[01:18:24] by listening to the very first FU Deeproot episode

[01:18:28] that you took down.

[01:18:29] And I will say this, I'm glad that you've grown

[01:18:33] and you've warmed up to us a little bit.

[01:18:35] And we'd love to invite you down when we have our five days

[01:18:40] in Deeproot event.

[01:18:42] And so you can see for yourself.

[01:18:45] I mean, I will take you up on that invitation.

[01:18:49] And I think this show, at times, I think all pinball people,

[01:18:55] we sometimes become a product or a victim of our own

[01:18:59] emotions around these things.

[01:19:00] And as I've studied your company over the past X amount

[01:19:05] of months, I don't think you can take any other approach.

[01:19:09] But to wait and see what you guys do.

[01:19:11] I mean, you haven't asked for my money.

[01:19:12] You haven't asked for anyone else's money.

[01:19:14] You're not taking pre-orders.

[01:19:16] You're not doing anything other than trying

[01:19:19] to correct the wrongs that happen at Zidware.

[01:19:21] So I'd rather live in a world to your point

[01:19:24] where we try to fix problems and bring new solutions out

[01:19:28] into the world.

[01:19:30] And I also, for that reason alone,

[01:19:33] I don't want to have podcasts up there that are slamming

[01:19:36] your company.

[01:19:38] But that doesn't mean because I'm about to do another podcast

[01:19:41] where I'm really just asking for Dutch pinball to go away

[01:19:44] because I won't stop when people,

[01:19:47] their latest correspondence today basically

[01:19:49] said three things.

[01:19:50] It said, we're out of money.

[01:19:52] Don't sue us.

[01:19:53] Good night.

[01:19:54] It's like, go away.

[01:19:56] I just want companies that will bring us products.

[01:19:59] Is that at the end of the day, their toys,

[01:20:01] that people love, their things that we're very passionate about.

[01:20:06] And you should just get what you pay for in life,

[01:20:08] whether it's a big Mac or a pinball machine.

[01:20:10] You should get what you pay for.

[01:20:12] So I'm excited to see what you guys develop.

[01:20:15] And we look forward to the future.

[01:20:17] I mean, there's, I think you have converted me into someone

[01:20:20] who is more curious than condemning.

[01:20:23] So you have that.

[01:20:26] Well, it was great motivation.

[01:20:28] And I think that everyone has a place in this hobby.

[01:20:35] And while I haven't been happy or agree with everything

[01:20:39] that you've said, I think that you do a great job

[01:20:43] of putting it out there.

[01:20:45] I'm not afraid to come on and answer your questions.

[01:20:49] And I like to think that we had a good time today.

[01:20:51] And we can have many more and laugh about all of this

[01:20:55] in the future.

[01:20:56] Yeah, I appreciate it.

[01:20:57] I mean, this is just a dialogue about pinball.

[01:21:01] And there's a lot of other manufacturers out there

[01:21:04] that refuse to come on this show.

[01:21:05] And it always perplexes me because I think,

[01:21:08] if you look at every interview we've done,

[01:21:10] I mean, we treat everybody with respect.

[01:21:12] And we just try to have an unfiltered dialogue

[01:21:14] about what's going on in the hobby.

[01:21:16] And I think that's why people listen.

[01:21:18] Well, you know what's going to happen next, Chris?

[01:21:20] They're going to say that you are too easy on me today.

[01:21:22] Right.

[01:21:23] I don't know.

[01:21:24] You just can't win, can you?

[01:21:25] But it's hard because there's nobody can win.

[01:21:27] You're not to blame for anything.

[01:21:29] I mean, I think I asked the right questions about John.

[01:21:33] I think people are going to win.

[01:21:34] See, I think, but again, as I said on this show,

[01:21:37] if you unravel the mystery of Zid,

[01:21:39] where people will buy the games, and they all know that,

[01:21:42] that no one will say I won't go in on one.

[01:21:44] And they all want the stuff.

[01:21:46] So I actually, and I said this,

[01:21:48] I think you made the right move just from a marketing

[01:21:49] standpoint to get access to probably some of the best

[01:21:53] artwork ever done before by Zombie Yeti.

[01:21:55] And I just think if you just put that on anything

[01:21:58] remotely working, it's going to sell.

[01:22:00] I know this hobby.

[01:22:01] It will sell.

[01:22:03] And can that's who I have a teaser for you.

[01:22:06] If you don't mind.

[01:22:08] Hit me up.

[01:22:09] So Magic Girl, the problem with Magic Girl,

[01:22:12] in that it's beautiful, it's very 2D.

[01:22:15] It's very line art, so vector, kind of washed colors.

[01:22:19] So the problem we've had in getting it more into a 3D

[01:22:22] animation realm is trying to bridge that gap.

[01:22:25] And I can tell you that it took a couple tries,

[01:22:27] but Matt Armstrong up in Utah, who is our director,

[01:22:31] is such a phenomenal talent.

[01:22:33] And I told him that I thought Magic Girl was sexy before,

[01:22:39] and he brought her to a 3D kind of very next door kind

[01:22:44] of gal kind of look, but still keeping that mysterious part

[01:22:49] and cute and everything.

[01:22:51] And so I'm so excited to show the world some of this transition.

[01:22:56] We took from some of the art that Jeremy did,

[01:22:59] and really taking it now into the modern kind of video game

[01:23:03] world and using 3D animations and bridging

[01:23:07] those two very different illustration gaps.

[01:23:09] So a little tidbit there.

[01:23:12] I hope y'all enjoy your two.

[01:23:14] Can you just hold off on revealing that

[01:23:16] until I sell my Magic Girl playfield in Translate?

[01:23:20] So well, Robert, again, I appreciate this.

[01:23:23] I appreciate our conversations off the record.

[01:23:27] So we'll stay in touch.

[01:23:28] And as anytime you want to come on the show

[01:23:31] and share some new stuff, just let me know.

[01:23:35] A pleasure.

[01:23:36] Absolutely.

[01:23:36] It has been a pleasure.

[01:23:37] Take care, Chris.

[01:23:38] And hopefully we'll talk to you soon.

[01:23:39] All right.

[01:23:40] Have a good night.

[01:23:41] All right.

[01:23:41] You too.

[01:23:42] Bye-bye.
