[00:00] There's a way that you look me straight in the eyes.

[00:09] Only last for a moment.

[00:13] It lasts through the night.

[00:20] Well, I called it.

[00:22] I said it.

[00:23] I said if you order AP3 by Multimorphic,

[00:27] you're going to wait many, many months before you get your game.

[00:31] And now we have confirmation from people who bought Weird Owl

[00:34] that they are going to get their games all throughout sometime in 2022 and even into 2023.

[00:42] I want to talk about this.

[00:43] And I know I was a little bit strident on my Facebook lives about how annoyed I am with these pinball boutique companies doing this.

[00:51] And I'm going to explain the thing that really does bug me because they know what they're doing.

[00:57] They know what they're doing.

[00:58] They know what their challenges are.

[01:00] And they are withholding information from buyers.

[01:05] They are.

[01:05] They really are doing it.

[01:06] Now, I know that Jerry will offer a refund, but I want to explain what I think he did and why I think he did it and why I think it's kind of a crummy move.

[01:17] And it's not just Jerry doing it.

[01:20] I think it's crummy what Damien did over at Haggis.

[01:23] And I think these boutique companies.

[01:26] If you ask me, they're just kind of annoying the way they launched their games.

[01:31] Here's why I think Jerry took money when he knew deep down inside that he couldn't even get anyone a full game.

[01:40] And I mean like the platform and the kit.

[01:42] The earliest you're going to get that is sometime in September or October.

[01:48] So he's six months delayed if you need a full P3 platform to play Weird Owl.

[01:54] Now, it begs the question.

[01:56] If you know that this game can't go on the line in six months, right?

[02:01] You're six months away from getting game number one.

[02:04] That's a full kit out the door, right?

[02:06] A full game out the door.

[02:08] Why would you take money in March of 2022 when you know that's your delay?

[02:15] Why would you do it?

[02:16] Would Stern ever release a game that it can't make for six months?

[02:20] Would Jersey Jack?

[02:21] See, this is this new practice in Pinball where a lot of companies and it's not just Jerry.

[02:26] They're revealing their games way too early to lock up the money.

[02:31] And I don't like it.

[02:33] I wouldn't go in on it.

[02:34] And here's why I think he did it.

[02:36] This is why I think he did it.

[02:37] I think he was terrified that Toy Story was going to be revealed.

[02:41] And Jersey Jack would say they're going to have the game on the line in April.

[02:46] And I think he was terrified that Toy Story was going to come to TPF and just take over the Pinball world.

[02:53] And so he got in front of that by announcing Weird Out.

[02:57] Now, it was a smart marketing move.

[02:59] If you ask me, it was like he got the stage.

[03:01] Like he put his game on stage.

[03:04] It's been the only new pinball machine announced and revealed in March before TPF.

[03:10] And now that it looks like Toy Story will not be at TPF,

[03:13] Jerry's got the hot game at TPF.

[03:16] But here's the bigger problem for him.

[03:18] And I keep saying this.

[03:19] So he marches into TPF with Weird Out.

[03:23] It will be the newest game at the show.

[03:25] And he's going to get a lot of attention.

[03:27] And let's say you jump on his game and you play it at TPF and you love it.

[03:33] And you say, man, I want to order one.

[03:34] Great.

[03:35] You know when you're going to get your game?

[03:36] It's going to be over a year from the moment you play that game at TPF.

[03:42] Over a year.

[03:44] And I think we need to stop saying, well, Stern's got the same problem as Jerry.

[03:48] No, they don't.

[03:49] The reason why Stern is delayed is not because they can't make games.

[03:54] The reason why Stern is delayed is because they have so many orders and there's a difference there.

[04:00] And that is why Stern Pinball has stopped revealing new games.

[04:04] Because if they reveal a new game, they're going to get 3,000 to 5,000 more orders.

[04:10] Stern is still cranking out machines.

[04:12] They just can't release a new game and make up the backlog so they hit pause on the new games.

[04:18] But Jerry knew he had a backlog when he revealed this new game.

[04:23] And that's my issue with this, is that when he revealed this game and he took money,

[04:30] he knew he was six months backlogged.

[04:33] And you know who was saying that?

[04:34] Canada was saying it, Zach Menne was saying it, and all the P3 fanboys out there didn't want to hear it.

[04:41] So if you ordered one, you're going to wait a while.

[04:43] Now, I will give Jerry credit.

[04:45] He is sending out every single person who ordered one in ETA on when they can expect their game.

[04:53] And they have 24 hours to bail on their spot.

[04:57] So I do commend him for that.

[04:59] These spots are refundable, but only for 24 hours.

[05:04] Now, the part where it gets really silly is this.

[05:07] If you stay in on it, and let's say he says your game is going to be ready in October.

[05:12] All right, October comes and goes, you don't get your game.

[05:15] You can't get a refund until six months from then.

[05:19] He has put into the clause that he has a six month window to get you your game on top of the promise ship date.

[05:29] So let's count that out.

[05:30] October, he's got November, December, January, February, March, April of 2023 is what he's given himself as a buffer to keep your $2,000 locked up with Multimorphic.

[05:48] How does anybody like this system?

[05:51] And here's the thing that just kills me.

[05:53] I do believe there is a level of being disingenuous with your buyers.

[05:59] When you know you've got a six month delay, you know the earliest you can get a full game on the line is September, Jerry.

[06:07] You didn't tell anybody that.

[06:08] See, what he did was this.

[06:10] He created the FOMO.

[06:12] He created the excitement.

[06:14] He didn't give you all of the information.

[06:17] He didn't.

[06:18] He strategically knew he would not give you all of the information until after you ordered the game because he knew you would be excited that you got your order in.

[06:30] Like he hooked you with the FOMO, your order is in, and now you really don't want to give it up because you feel like you got one of those to 27.

[06:38] And hey, look, if you're a weird Al fan and you're willing to wait this long, more power to you.

[06:45] I'm not here to say you should get a refund.

[06:47] I'm not here to say like bail on the game.

[06:49] Like if it's your dream theme, you have no choice but to wait.

[06:54] But what I don't like is this sort of like applauding of these boutique companies who go around saying they're transparent because they're really not.

[07:03] They're transparent when it's convenient and when it works to their benefit.

[07:08] But when it doesn't work to their benefit, they're not transparent at all.

[07:13] And he wasn't transparent on the day he took orders because he knew what the delay was.

[07:19] The same thing is true with Damien over in Australia.

[07:22] He wasn't transparent.

[07:24] He said games would be on the line in July.

[07:27] He knew he didn't have parts.

[07:29] He knew those games were not going on the line in July.

[07:32] And here we are in March and he still hasn't given an update.

[07:35] And he knew it and he took your money and and the sad part for everyone who gave money to Damien, they can't get their money back.

[07:42] I have friends who have been emailing him trying to get a refund and they can't get a refund.

[07:47] And we like this.

[07:49] And this is how we show support for the boutique pinball companies.

[07:52] I just want to get to a point, ladies and gentlemen, when the following happens.

[07:57] Do not reveal your game until it's ready for production.

[08:01] Can we just start there?

[08:02] And I don't care if you're big like Stern or small like Spooky or you're like tiny like Multimorphic.

[08:09] Do not open your order banks until production is ready until you can get that game on the line within the next couple of months.

[08:18] I think that's a fair window.

[08:20] We will reveal it.

[08:22] The game will be on the line in a couple of months.

[08:25] Only some companies can wait until the game is on the line when they make the reveal because those companies have money in the bank.

[08:33] I'm talking about Stern and Jersey Jack pinball.

[08:36] I'm also talking about Chicago Gaming Company and American pinball.

[08:40] But lately we are seeing more and more of this like early, early reveal.

[08:46] Like look when they revealed Legends of Vahala.

[08:49] It was October.

[08:50] Look when they revealed Cactus Canyon.

[08:52] October.

[08:53] There are barely any of those games even on the line in March of 2022.

[09:00] October, November, December, January, February, March.

[09:03] Six months, six months from announce reveal.

[09:08] Take your money and then games start to trickle out.

[09:12] Why?

[09:13] Why do these companies need that six month window to freeze your capital before they put the games on the line?

[09:20] Why don't they just wait?

[09:21] I just don't like it.

[09:22] I don't like it.

[09:23] And the thing about Jerry's thing is like I think some of you out there are getting a little delusional by the time

[09:29] September, October rolls around.

[09:31] We're going to see Toy Story.

[09:33] I think we might even see a second game from Jersey Jack pinball.

[09:36] I'm going to talk about that at the end of this podcast.

[09:38] We're also going to see Stern's new game.

[09:41] We're probably going to get James Bond.

[09:43] By August we're going to get the Dennis Nordman game from American Pinball.

[09:47] So all this stuff is going to be happening and your money is locked in.

[09:52] Now look, the only way you would lock your money in and not care again is if you're a diehard weird owl fan.

[09:57] But it's just weird to me, right?

[09:58] It's like Jerry's going to go to TPF.

[10:00] He's going to do his victory lap and he can't get people a game now for over 12 months.

[10:05] It's a waste of time.

[10:07] It's a waste of money.

[10:08] There's no point in him going to the show.

[10:10] All he's going to do is hook people that want the game now.

[10:14] Like pinball is a toy you want now.

[10:16] I don't want to play a pinball game and wait a year.

[10:19] I don't want to play a pinball game and wait six months.

[10:22] I know a lot of you with Stern orders, you're in that boat.

[10:25] You're waiting for your Mandalorians, for your Elvira's, for your Godzilla's.

[10:29] I get it and we don't like it.

[10:31] And that's why Stern is stopping all new releases.

[10:34] But these boutique companies, man, it's just, it's getting really, really strange to me that they still don't get it.

[10:42] And even though they're getting the sales, I still would not want to be on these roller coaster rides.

[10:47] I wouldn't.

[10:48] I wouldn't want to be on any of these boutique company rides right now.

[10:51] I wouldn't want to be on the spooky ride.

[10:54] I wouldn't want to be on the haggis ride.

[10:56] I wouldn't want to be on the multi-morphic ride.

[10:58] I wouldn't.

[10:59] If I had money right now, burning a hole in my pocket, I would not freeze it with any of these companies.

[11:04] I would go get a used game.

[11:07] That's what I would do.

[11:08] You know, and I just hear like a lot of people saying like, oh, just support everybody.

[11:12] I just won't support this tactic.

[11:14] I just don't think you should take money for anything unless it's being built.

[11:19] That's how it should be.

[11:21] These companies have been in pinball for so many years now.

[11:24] They know that's the right way to do it.

[11:26] Because I mean it when I say it.

[11:28] When you give your money this early, you are not buying your game.

[11:32] You are not buying the parts for your game.

[11:34] You are paying them to ramp up to build your game.

[11:38] And there's always a risk in that.

[11:40] All your money is being used to scale the company up so it can produce all the orders.

[11:45] But there's a danger in that.

[11:47] And we've seen this approach like collapse some of the boutique companies before.

[11:52] And we act like it's never going to happen again.

[11:55] And I'm going to tell you right now, it's going to happen again.

[11:58] There is going to be another boutique pinball company that fails.

[12:01] I don't know which one it's going to be.

[12:03] But these boutique companies, the margins in pinball are so small.

[12:08] You know, the more I talk to people behind the scenes about the reality of making pinball,

[12:13] how small the margins really are.

[12:16] The more I walk away and feel like it is honestly a fool's venture to go into pinball manufacturing.

[12:25] It just is.

[12:26] And I get it.

[12:27] There's a lot of passion.

[12:29] There's men with money.

[12:30] But the truth is, if you have a few million dollars, the easiest way to lose it is to go into pinball manufacturing.

[12:38] If I had five million dollars, I would never in a million years say I need to start a pinball company.

[12:45] Even if there are millions to be made, the laborious effort to make that money back is not worth it.

[12:52] You could go buy five million dollars in apartments and Airbnb them and have passive income and no stress at all.

[13:01] We get these men who made money in other areas trying to create manufacturing facilities.

[13:06] It seems like a nightmare.

[13:08] Like, I don't envy any of them.

[13:10] Not Jerry, not Damien, not Charlie, any of them.

[13:14] It just feels like a headache.

[13:16] Oh, Chris, you got to be championing all new pinball.

[13:19] No, we've got enough good big pinball companies out there.

[13:22] We do.

[13:23] We've got Stern.

[13:24] We've got Jersey Jack pinball.

[13:26] I just feel like boutique pinball has never really lived up to the hype.

[13:29] I do.

[13:30] I feel like boutique pinball had so much promise like five, six years ago.

[13:35] And if you look at the boutique games that have come out, like none of them, none of them have been better than anything from CGC,

[13:41] than anything from Stern and anything from JJP.

[13:44] They just haven't.

[13:45] There is no boutique pinball game that is ranked above any of those companies.

[13:50] It's all been this like real big promise of all these passionate people making boutique games and just none of it's better than the big stuff.

[13:57] So like, I don't know.

[13:59] I mean, I'm just getting to this point now.

[14:00] We're like, all right, like if you're going to go boutique, make it magical, make it special, do something that's different that no one else is doing.

[14:08] And I just don't see it now.

[14:09] I know Jerry's like, Chris, what are you talking about?

[14:11] My platform is so much different.

[14:13] And he's right.

[14:14] And I get it, Jerry.

[14:15] And I'm happy you got your sales.

[14:17] But I knew this would happen.

[14:18] You just can't make the games fast enough and you're going to end up frustrating more people than you're satisfying with that timeline.

[14:25] You just are.

[14:26] All right, let's speak about timelines.

[14:29] So Christopher Franci has come out and posted something on Facebook that basically said, in October, I'm working on something that's going to like blow us away.

[14:38] It was like, I don't think he said blow away, but I think he said something along those lines.

[14:42] And I first and foremost, I was just laughing because Franci always does this.

[14:47] He always has to talk when he shouldn't talk.

[14:50] And I don't think he should be talking at all if he's working on a pinball project.

[14:55] Do you hear a zombie Eddie talk about what he's working on?

[14:58] Do you hear Pat Lawler?

[15:00] Do you hear George Gomez?

[15:01] Do you hear Keith Elwyn?

[15:03] Nobody in pinball who's in pinball really talks about anything.

[15:08] They don't put dates out there.

[15:10] They don't try to get your expectations high.

[15:12] They just do the work and let the work do the talking.

[15:16] So when I saw Franci post this, I was like, awesome.

[15:19] He's once again, teeing up that he's working on something.

[15:22] Now, if you remember an earlier comment by Mr. Franci, he said the following.

[15:27] He's working on games for CGC, for American Pinball, and for a major pinball company.

[15:34] Now, I happen to know from a very good source that the major pinball company he's working on a game for is Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:44] I also heard through the Jersey Jack Grapevine that the game he's working on is Eric Minier's next game,

[15:51] which all signs are pointing to the Godfather.

[15:55] So my bet is this.

[15:57] I think JJP gets out.

[16:00] I think they get out Toy Story sometime in March, April.

[16:04] And I also think they're going to release Godfather in October, November.

[16:10] I do. Here's why.

[16:11] October 5th is the two-year anniversary of Eric's G&R.

[16:15] It's also the 50th anniversary year of the Godfather.

[16:20] And so I know that it sounds crazy that Jersey Jack Pinball could actually get out two new games a year.

[16:26] But I think this is the year they're going to do it.

[16:30] I think it's going to be Eric's Godfather with Franci and Art in October, and I think they're going to reveal it then.

[16:36] It doesn't mean it'll be on the line then.

[16:39] I expect it to be revealed in October on the line by November, December.

[16:44] I think JJP is finally going to cross that barrier and have two new reveals in a year.

[16:49] Now, they never said two games to ship in a year.

[16:52] Two new reveals in a year.

[16:54] So that's exciting.

[16:56] I'm also hearing that Back to the Future is coming.

[16:59] It's coming. Back to the Future is coming.

[17:01] I don't know when and I don't know who's designing it.

[17:05] I'm also hearing that Jaws might not be Keith Elwin now.

[17:09] See, these rumors, people, they swirl all over the place.

[17:13] And I am almost 1,000% positive that Stern puts out fake rumors.

[17:19] I mean, if I were them, that's all I would do.

[17:21] Stern can so easily have all of us just chasing our tails because the easiest way to do it is you give a guy like Joe Abadi.

[17:29] I love Joe Abadi, but you give a guy like Joe Abadi some information that's false.

[17:33] Like if Stern gave it to him and, you know, and these guys are good, they know what they're doing.

[17:37] You'll go out drinking with Stern employees and they could easily be like, you know what, man?

[17:42] Thanks for that beer, Joe.

[17:44] Like I'm going to tell you right now it's Keith Elwin Jaws.

[17:47] Okay, now Stern could easily have a meeting and say, look, here's what we're going to do.

[17:51] We're going to go out and at each show, I want all of you to interact and party with like the pinball community.

[17:57] And here's what we're going to do.

[17:58] I want each and every one of you to say the following and they're going to think they're getting a piece of information and that information is going to be false.

[18:05] I would totally orchestrate a campaign of fake news if I were Stern Pinball.

[18:10] I would work so well.

[18:12] There is no way it would not work.

[18:14] It's probably working right now and they probably are laughing that Canada is once again reporting something incorrectly.

[18:22] So we shall see.

[18:23] All right.

[18:24] So Rush Elyse are getting out the door.

[18:26] Stern's taking a break.

[18:28] Jersey Jack is nowhere to be found with Toy Story.

[18:31] I guess Cactus Canyons are trickling out.

[18:34] Legends of Ahalas are shipping.

[18:36] That's good to see AP is making games.

[18:38] Still not excited about that game.

[18:40] But you know, it's fun going into the thread because the owners claim it's the greatest game of all time.

[18:44] But hey, look, they're making a game and I wouldn't spend 8700 on it, but it is what it is.

[18:50] Still no word on Spinal Tap.

[18:52] I would love to just see Spinal Tap so we can all point at it and laugh, but no Spinal Tap yet from Home Pin.

[18:58] What else is going on?

[19:00] Alien LVs have not arrived yet.

[19:02] I think they should be arriving any day now.

[19:04] Maybe they have started arriving.

[19:06] Dutch Pinball and nothing new. People still playing around with the aprons.

[19:09] It's been a little bit of a lull period. I won't lie.

[19:12] There's not that much going on.

[19:14] When I sit down to do a show, it's hard to get to 30 minutes.

[19:18] Man, I'm watching other shows that are like at an hour and a half.

[19:21] Like there's nothing.

[19:22] There's legitimately hardly any news in Pinball.

[19:26] I implore everybody in the Pinball content world.

[19:30] Let's get to the point and let's stop just trying to fill 60 minutes or 90 minutes.

[19:35] There's nothing to talk about.

[19:37] Pinflation is still going on.

[19:39] The prices are stupid.

[19:40] They're going to come down when Stern gets its production going.

[19:43] But everybody, happy Friday.

[19:45] I hope you hang out with me in the Saturday morning spectacular.

[19:48] We're still doing great on Patreon.

[19:51] We got a 405 club members.

[19:53] That's awesome.

[19:54] And I hope you guys are enjoying the show.

[19:56] If you have any suggestions about some show topics you'd like me to do, hit me up.

[20:00] I do know that you love the positive, Canada.

[20:03] You love the show I did, my favorite toys.

[20:06] My next one's going to be my favorite art packages from the last five years of Pinball.

[20:13] My favorite art packages in Pinball.

[20:16] I just need to do a little more research on that.

[20:19] I need to actually look at all the art packages and decide what my favorites are.

[20:23] I'm also probably going to do my five favorite and my five least favorite art packages.

[20:28] I think it'll be a fun show.

[20:30] I can't wait to do it.

[20:31] It's hard people.

[20:32] You know I'm up at 5 a.m. with Killian.

[20:35] Trying to keep everything together.

[20:37] Trying to do my job.

[20:38] Trying to keep the lights on.

[20:40] But I'm so happy to see each and every one of you hanging out in the club.

[20:44] And also, I will be at TPF.

[20:46] It is confirmed.

[20:47] I am booking my ticket right now.

[20:49] I will be there Friday and Saturday.

[20:52] I will fly out Sunday.

[20:54] So if you are going to TPF, we will absolutely hang out.

[20:58] And I'm telling you right now, my club members, they get the priority.

[21:01] So just say I'm part of the Canadian club and let's go grab a beer and chat pinball everybody.

[21:06] Have a great day.

[21:07] And let me know in the comments section of this podcast if you think I'm being too harsh on Jerry.

[21:12] Jerry, you know what you did.

[21:14] You know, you created FOMO and then you were transparent.

[21:18] Interesting strategy.

[21:20] It worked.

[21:21] He sold the games.

[21:22] I'm not sure how many refund requests came in.

[21:24] But Jerry, you know, we're going to keep following this story.

[21:26] I mean, it's kind of boring now because no one's really going to be playing.

[21:29] The earliest people are going to get the kits is July.

[21:33] So March, April, May, June, July.

[21:36] It's just boring.

[21:37] I'm so bored.

[21:38] Like you released a game and no one can play it for six months.

[21:41] Wow.

[21:42] What a great marketing strategy.

[21:43] Later, people.

[21:59] We're going to where we're going, where we're going.
