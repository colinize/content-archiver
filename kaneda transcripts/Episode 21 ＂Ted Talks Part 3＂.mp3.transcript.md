[00:00] Good evening. As a duly designated representative of the city, County and

[00:06] State of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and

[00:10] return forth with to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel

[00:13] dimension. Now I do it thanks very much right?

[00:23] Ladies and gentlemen it's everyone's favorite pinball arbiter canada coming

[00:29] from New York City. This is episode 21 of Canada's pinball podcast and this is

[00:34] gonna be an awesome episode because we are gonna go real shortly to an

[00:37] interview with everyone's favorite guest of the show Ted but before we get

[00:42] there I just want to recap what happened last week. I mean it was it was one of

[00:46] the most amazing weeks that I've seen in the pinball world and that was the

[00:51] reveal of Ghostbusters. There's so much being said about this pin I don't

[00:55] want to rehash it. All I'm gonna say in the matter is this this is the most

[00:59] gorgeous pin that I've ever seen in the last I mean I want to say 20 years. It is

[01:07] absolutely gorgeous and it's not just the artwork that is winning people over.

[01:10] It's how much fun stuff is jam packed into this machine. I love reading the

[01:15] thread where people are just sort of speculating all the different shots how

[01:19] they're gonna work, how they're the slings gonna work, how's the subway gonna

[01:23] work. So it's just gonna be really awesome on Tuesday when we see Jack Danger

[01:28] play the machine and we get to see it in motion for the first time. And you know

[01:34] we had a little bit of an exit on Pinside. It seems with everyone's favorite

[01:40] pinball critic Mr. Orch Lawson was talking about the inserts on the game and we

[01:46] had a let him have it. I think everyone has opinions about games and artwork is

[01:51] definitely subjective but it's reached a point now where if you're working on a

[01:56] pinball machine you should stay focused on the pinball machine you're working on

[02:00] and let your work do the talk. I think it's it's time where everyone just stop

[02:04] commenting on competitors games and let your own machine do the talking and

[02:09] that will always speak the loudest. Don't don't come out and don't be critical

[02:14] and don't nitpick other people's artwork until you have proven that you can

[02:18] develop a pin that is equally as exciting that is equally as awesome. And look we

[02:23] all hope that every new pinball machine that comes out is epic and and and that's

[02:28] we're all rooting for these games to be great. No one wants to see a game fail

[02:32] nobody wants to see a game not be fun but there is a lot of talk and I think

[02:36] what's what what what Ghostbusters proved this week more than anything is that you

[02:42] need to reveal a pin and get people excited and have them be able to buy it and

[02:48] ship it in a short window of time. People are tired and they're sick of

[02:52] everyone just talking so early years before pins come out. These slow

[02:58] reveals are just over with. It doesn't work. It is so hard to maintain excitement

[03:04] and hype over a long period of time. We're seeing it now with with the

[03:09] hobbit shipping and it's it's great that that machine is finally getting out

[03:12] there but it is hard for people to still be super excited about pins when it's

[03:16] been two years since they first saw it. Ghostbusters has been revealed and it's

[03:21] going to be less than two months before people are playing it and having it in

[03:26] their homes and that that's a great thing. And look I think at the end of the day

[03:30] pinball companies do need one line of communication. You can't have all these

[03:35] separate people talking on behalf of the company. It just doesn't work. You

[03:40] don't see a great artist like Zambi Yeti chiming in on other people's work. You

[03:44] don't see John Trudeau or Richie or anyone involved with Stern pinball coming

[03:49] out and saying stuff. And I think the same should be true for the other

[03:53] competitors out there. Especially competitors that are going after Stern.

[03:56] Going after these guys it up so much muscle. And I did here I did hear that

[04:01] after Orrick decided to take a break from Pinside and post less that Andrew

[04:07] finally got in touch with him and they had a little hard to hard talk and I

[04:11] want to I want to play you guys what what that sounded like when Andrew finally

[04:16] got a hold of Orrick. It's not your fault.

[04:23] It's not your fault.

[04:41] Well so much for all that thick skin and maybe everyone will think twice

[05:00] before they critique the work of others and again let your work do the talking.

[05:04] This is not a personal attack anymore. This is just the reality. If you want to

[05:09] compete and you want to show how good your machine is just let the machine do

[05:12] the talking. Okay ladies and gentlemen let's get right to the interview with Ted.

[05:16] It's it's pretty awesome. Ted is just an awesome guy. He came on and we try to

[05:20] get it into a half hour show. It couldn't quite get there but again this is not

[05:24] going to be some of these two hour pinball podcast interviews that I keep saying

[05:28] on iTunes. But without further ado ladies and gentlemen let me air that interview for you guys.

[05:39] Ladies and gentlemen it is a glorious day in Timbal and I'm not talking for

[05:46] obvious reasons of new pinball reveals I'm talking Ted has decided to come back

[05:51] for a third time to Canadian pinball podcast without even accepting any money.

[05:55] Ted welcome back to the show. Don't worry it's only going to be a half hour

[05:59] and that's it we're done. I know I get only a four half hour this time. So

[06:03] Ted before we get into like the big news of the day which was Ghostbusters

[06:07] and I want to know what I thought it was that happily married guy was the big

[06:11] news. Right I mean he missed it by like one day like he didn't have enough

[06:16] room to breathe with all the drama but we'll get into that we'll get into

[06:19] Ghostbusters but we initially were going to talk and we're going to start with

[06:23] this really really cool printing process that you've discovered that could

[06:28] really make pinball sort of pop even more and let people customize them. I just

[06:32] tell a story real quick about what happened. A friend of mine happens to own a

[06:36] printing plant and he got a big job one day that to print these like 3D acrylic

[06:44] signs so he had to go out and buy two pieces of machinery and he spent about

[06:48] $175,000 on this thing. So the finish of job and then all of a sudden because

[06:53] I went to visit him because we do magazines together and when I went to visit him

[06:57] he said you know what can we do with this machine he told me what it could do

[07:00] and I just went whoa I say you can cut Plexi you can cut and he goes oh Plexi

[07:05] metal anything so I was like what about like pinball backlasses can you do that

[07:10] and he goes yeah anything plastic speaker panels you know custom art I mean

[07:15] what you can you print on a on wood can you make a play field because yeah and

[07:19] this is like UV inks and it's like he said you could put these panels outside

[07:23] on a sign and they last for years and years and years even in the weather that

[07:28] that's how good these inks are so when I heard that I just all of a sudden the

[07:33] flood gates open I call the couple people that I knew some pinball people

[07:37] asking what they thought maybe maybe well maybe this is all over the place and

[07:41] they said no I mean to be able to do a back glass a rare one and do it in

[07:45] Plexi acrylic or any kind of this old kinds of acrylic as long as it's no

[07:49] bigger than two inches thick you can take your super valuable back glass

[07:54] making exact copy of it in Plexi put that in there and put away here your

[07:58] back glass these things won't break you know so you don't have to worry about

[08:02] them smashing on the machine anymore so already I put a thing on

[08:06] pinside a thread asking for opinions and it was just overwhelming you know

[08:11] people are saying this is a great idea can you do this can you do that so

[08:15] we're ready just working on we're still doing testing but people are saying I

[08:18] need these plastics these are so hard to find can you do these for me well

[08:22] let me see them yeah that's no problem you know back glasses we got a light

[08:26] a speaker panel that the one guy wants some rare speaker panel he wants to

[08:30] replace so we have a bunch of stuff going on we're trying right now to find

[08:35] that exactly you know how dense we have to make the back glass so so the light

[08:39] you the first test we did the print to try to tell us you got to put a layer

[08:43] of white in the back and we said nah nah just print it because it's solid

[08:47] ink on the back glass it should be fine and it wasn't it was it was too thin

[08:51] you know it's the image when you're held against the wall was gorgeous but as

[08:55] soon as you put it on the back glass with those bright bulbs you can see the

[08:58] the glowing bulbs behind it so we put white paper behind just to try it and it

[09:02] was much better so we're doing more tests with this and and we're gonna see how it

[09:07] works out but this you know literally anybody that wants anything plastics or

[09:12] or anything we could do copper as we can do a side with a hell of side blade

[09:17] things are called I mean literally print on just about anything and the

[09:21] resolution is great we can do and here's the cool part we could do custom one

[09:26] off back glasses or anything that I was doing crazy from black and

[09:30] doom but on the side of the panel there's the guy in the girl the girls in the

[09:33] bathing suit the guys holding the spear we can put your face in there you and

[09:37] your wife you and your girlfriend we can put your kids swimming around we

[09:41] could put your company logo we could totally customize you know try and have

[09:45] your face in it T2 your face is there with Roddy and the metal showing through

[09:49] it it's just endless the number of crazy things you could do with this and

[09:53] and it's it's not gonna be that expensive we're thinking it should be like

[09:56] around you know a hundred fifty bucks or something for a custom back glass so

[10:00] it's it's very exciting and to get to get back quality good so you need a high

[10:06] res image I take it to to to make the print look nice well yeah that we can print

[10:10] on anything with a higher res of course the best and the beauty of it is is so

[10:15] many of these guys out there are digital artists or graphic artists or

[10:19] designers they can literally do their own Photoshop versions of whatever they

[10:23] want and just send me the file and we can print on anything on metal around a

[10:28] acrylic or whatever so it's just it really there's endless possibilities of

[10:33] what can happen with this thing right and I think to make it easier for people

[10:36] well will there just be like are you guys envisioning like having a template for

[10:41] back glasses so people can see like what it would look like and move the image

[10:44] around I use this website called like pick monkey where it's you can you can

[10:49] set your proportions and put your image in it and make any image possible so

[10:53] how you mentioned people like sending you like I want this on a back glass and

[10:56] you guys would help sort of convince there's my friends there's only like I

[11:01] think two or three sizes of of back glass there's one for the Valley Williams

[11:06] one for I mean I think that's what he said maybe three different sizes so

[11:09] that's it once you know the size I think it's like you know 27 and a half by

[11:13] 18 or whatever once you know that all you got to do is just make sure your

[11:16] image fits into that into that area and that's and that's you know pretty much it

[11:19] so when do you think and besides that we could do custom our work right now we

[11:24] could do custom backlit art or custom art that you can frame and put on the wall

[11:28] in 3d I'm not 3d like the 3d those other backlaces those really call those

[11:34] lenticular things this is 3d where we can put a background let's say I did

[11:39] the create I'm working on the creature we have a beautiful background all the

[11:42] coral and underwater and everything the lights coming through and then I could

[11:45] take the creature right from the the side of the creature machine or just a

[11:49] creature and stick him on a glass in front of it so it looks 3d frame it make

[11:54] it make it a light box or whatever so it's I got somebody might be interested in

[11:58] one of those for just a frame and put on his wall with this creature machine so

[12:02] it's it's really it's really exciting right and I mean we've definitely seen

[12:06] there's a huge huge demand for people to improve a lot of the backlaces that

[12:11] are on their machines and and to even you know to your point to customize it

[12:16] too because I think you know what people do love especially people who

[12:20] mod their machines is to give their machine a little bit actually something

[12:23] extra you know something different that makes it a little bit unique from all

[12:25] the other machines that are out there so so when what's the timing for you guys

[12:28] like when do you think people who are hearing this are like interested might be

[12:33] able to you know kick you guys some some artwork and and do some test runs for

[12:38] them well we're actually working on like three jobs right now that we're trying to

[12:42] do it's I think a set of plastics of back glass and a speaker panel and it just

[12:47] keeps you know I may team up with another group there's some people that you know

[12:52] if you companies out there that may want to just you know take this over and and

[12:55] be able to do it you know with me well supply some stuff to them you know

[12:58] because it's you know I don't know I'm just making this stuff as I go along I

[13:02] just would be really cool you know I never understand why when they made a

[13:05] translate it's like it's like this flimsy material that you got to stick on

[13:08] on a boat when you when you make the back glass out of the solid plexi that's

[13:12] like a whatever it is a quarter or anything so they go it just fits right in we

[13:15] put it in the creature machine the pictures around the thread it just whoop it

[13:19] just you just put that little frame on the bottom and it just slides right in

[13:22] and it's one solid piece and that's it right and you're saying this can this

[13:26] can print on to metal onto plastic so even stuff like the legs on the machine is

[13:31] I mean it's the whole thing sort of up up for custom I think it has to the

[13:37] thing can't be more than two inches thick so the legs would probably be you

[13:40] don't over that but but yes as long as it can lay down flat on this machine it

[13:44] could do that and I see cut around plastics and you know make speaker you know

[13:49] holes the speakers the speaker panels and everything so you know big guy

[13:54] come to call me says can you do how about a top or if I get a custom tie I said

[13:58] anything if it's as long as it fits within the dimensions of the machine and

[14:02] you give me the file we make something we can literally do do anything I mean

[14:05] having having people have these companies have their machines when they take

[14:09] them to show us where they and be able to integrate their their logo or their

[14:12] people right onto the back glass of the machine I mean I think that just would be

[14:16] kind of cool right no it's great I mean I think I think you know this has got a

[14:20] lot of people excited on the forum and I think people are really looking

[14:23] forward to experimenting with this and seeing what comes out this project and

[14:29] how what's the best way for people to contact you Ted for to to learn more is

[14:34] it just through Pinside is there yeah they could just send me a PM to start

[14:37] and then from there we just exchange phone numbers and Gmail and that's where

[14:40] they send me files over the you know over Gmail so it's you know it's just that

[14:44] easy and so I get this probably things going on out there I haven't thought

[14:48] about yet so I mean the all these people are on Pinside again this is not my

[14:52] major hobby it's just a side thing but these people that's this is the main

[14:54] thing they do so I'm sure they're gonna come up with a dozen more uses for

[14:59] this kind of thing or you know what could be made like Plexi you know see on the

[15:03] side of the cabinet make images of Plexi that can be put on the side of the

[15:07] cabinets with lit with LEDs I don't know it there's got to be a lot of cool stuff

[15:11] out there that we can do it definitely and what's the you know the name of the

[15:15] thread for people who might not be in it already I think it just says 10 came

[15:20] up with an idea needs some opinions as your pro bono marketer we made me want

[15:26] to change the title to be something about Ted's printing press or something so

[15:30] we'll figure it out but that's really cool I you know I think people are

[15:34] really looking forward to seeing what comes out of it and I know that you're

[15:37] gonna be sharing sort of some of these samples that you get them back right in

[15:41] the next few years if I get stuff back I'm gonna be putting them on there and

[15:45] if there's some rare plastics I already checked with the people and they said if

[15:48] other people need these plastics you know we're gonna make extra one so if someone

[15:51] needs a you know a set I mean the only thing drawback I can see is when

[15:55] when you're sending a file and you're and you're of a plastic on the machine it

[15:59] might the colors might not match a hundred percent you know I'm thinking so

[16:03] you're maybe due to them or if it's something really rare I mean you know make

[16:06] a set and put yours away you know and just use these because you won't be able

[16:11] to tell the difference when you know if the yellow is a little yellow we're on

[16:15] the original it no one knows you know no one's gonna notice that so as long as

[16:18] all the plastics are the same but so well how about that go spusters announcement

[16:23] huh yeah let's talk about that so that that sort of it it it wasn't unexpected

[16:30] her shocking but I don't think anyone really expected it to happen today I

[16:34] mean I know I did and I was at work and I actually did if somebody one of my

[16:38] contacts that is actually an actual contact said that it was gonna be either

[16:43] either today or tomorrow or the latest Monday but today was the day right so

[16:48] it so let's just what what are your thoughts like let's tell me what you

[16:52] thought when you saw this fully revealed for the first time well people could

[16:56] when when they when they had the leaked backlash people are saying I you know

[17:02] they they were complaining about a little bit I actually thought it was pretty

[17:04] damn good you know I mean everyone wants original audits you know it's

[17:07] original art I mean you know it's not gonna be you know it's if you want photo

[17:11] realistic art that's that's something else I mean this is an actual piece of

[17:14] artwork you know I think the backlash looks looks really cool the play field I

[17:19] think looks great so you know I think you know again we're looking at this thing

[17:25] as in as just the art on it we're seeing how the the art looks on the play

[17:29] field how the art looks on the plastics how the the backlash looks that's all we

[17:33] know I mean we really haven't seen it in action yet we haven't seen it be

[17:36] played yet and that's gonna be you know is important is anything else if not

[17:40] if not more so right I mean I didn't have a problem with the backlash either I

[17:44] mean we knew it was zombie Yeti and and that's sort of his style I mean I would

[17:49] I was just blown away I mean I I we all saw like a little bit of the play field

[17:54] and it just it just looks incredible I mean the game just looks so fun there's

[18:00] it's just so jam packed with stuff you know it's I mean I think my favorite

[18:06] thing I can't wait to see an action are the the magnet it's all grams these

[18:10] got holograms it's got the magnetic slings it's got the the subway the ball

[18:15] takes that deep dive on on the right side action yet one one's this thing I

[18:20] really want to see what that that hologram thing looks like you know in action

[18:24] and what the bash toy looks like and how it you know how it look I mean we're

[18:27] to see really how it plays I mean everyone is seems to love the art I mean

[18:30] obviously people are having trouble finding an elite which I'm very happy to

[18:35] report that two of my friends bought the Ellie already and and I'm talking

[18:40] about within 15 minutes of my house so this is a beautiful thing now do you

[18:43] know how early they got in on those LEDs or have they been in on it for a while

[18:47] I probably the past couple days you know I mean I they were taking deposits

[18:52] for how long now three weeks so I I don't know but I'm sure we'll hear soon

[18:57] but I have to imagine that the LEDs are going to be spoken for very if not

[19:02] today very it's only 500 of them I heard and and and I heard half of them are

[19:07] going overseas yeah which I think it's crazy they they should definitely do

[19:10] 500 for you know United States and then another 250 for overseas because that's

[19:15] 250 that's just not that's not enough not for a game like this where they see

[19:19] what kind of demand they're gonna have but again there's the premium saw you

[19:23] know I don't know but I like that like that slimer thing that's pretty cool yeah

[19:27] it looks like I mean you know some people are in the fence about the green I

[19:31] I love it but even as I look around my living room the the lower the rings like

[19:36] the brass it goes in nicely I would have a hard time putting that bright green

[19:41] aesthetically into my room but I think it would I think it would totally be worth it

[19:46] I mean I I do think the LED is definitely the nicest package but they all what you

[19:49] do is you change your room to match the match the bit more it would be the most

[19:53] expensive piece of furniture in here that's for sure but I think I think they

[19:57] did a good job and what you know something that I realized like when I saw this

[20:02] pan I was like wow like and we kind of saw it a little bit with spider-man VE

[20:06] Stern has just been like upping their game and with this one it really feels like

[20:11] this is a quantum leap forward for them in terms of DMD aside right because I

[20:18] think we all expected this to have an LCD months ago and we thought that Ghostbusters

[20:22] would be the one where we finally get color display but this pen just seems to

[20:27] be jam packed with incredible artwork incredible mechanisms beautiful

[20:32] sculpts it it it feels like a new company to me I feel like this pin is a new

[20:37] version of Stern that we are gonna tell you why they're upping their game

[20:40] because it's not just Jersey Jack I mean before when they said oh there's gonna

[20:44] be another pinball manufacturer out there Jersey Jack is doing all this higher

[20:47] level stuff it's gonna force them to up their game but Jersey Jack is still only

[20:51] just delivering their second machine now in how many years so I mean they they

[20:56] can't be considering that to be too serious but when you put all of the

[21:00] companies together now you've got the Hobbit coming out plus their next machine

[21:05] coming out you have alien you have the binlibowski rob zombie star wars

[21:12] eventually in the future I mean you you well all these other boutique games are

[21:16] coming out spooky is you know stuff once you put those all together now you've

[21:20] got like four machines and so now you have some competition so now it's gonna

[21:24] be people gonna say well am I gonna buy ale I can I can't spend 16 or 17

[21:29] thousand dollars I'm gonna get one machine this year what am I gonna get is

[21:32] it gonna be alien or is it gonna be Ghostbusters is it gonna be the big old

[21:35] bowsky or is it gonna be Ghostbusters so now they have to up their game and

[21:39] now people are saying oh wait a minute maybe I'm gonna get my deposit back on

[21:43] that the alien machine and get Ghostbusters so yeah you don't I know I I have to

[21:49] imagine that Jack isn't feeling too great today and nobody is Andrew

[21:54] highway because I I think you're right and I think there's only so much money

[21:58] to go around and what's happened and this is like a perfect storm that no one

[22:02] really saw coming because all these other pins that really need to succeed for

[22:07] some of these boutique companies to make it we're supposed to come out like a

[22:11] year ago two years ago right it is kind of crazy some some evil twist of

[22:17] faith within the pinball gods to have all these games crashing on top of each

[22:21] other right now right I mean it's hard it's hard and they know that and they're

[22:26] but they're all finally starting to get their games to ship but at the same time

[22:31] I don't think the market can handle so many pins at once so I do think there's

[22:37] gonna be a lot of nervousness on the other side of the ocean you know because

[22:42] if you look at the Ghostbusters premium which you know it's basically the

[22:47] LE except for the slimer and then the green and the you know the the the

[22:52] armor on the back yes is glass or whatever yeah like but like all these machines

[22:57] from these companies are also supposed to ship this year right yeah they're

[23:00] being Bowsky Ali that's also all the machines they're so Hobbit LaBowsky and

[23:06] Rob Zombie those games should be out in the next two to three months and I

[23:10] and yeah well I you know yeah I don't I it should but who knows but yeah within

[23:17] the next six months all these pins will be in market but the interesting thing

[23:21] is this is the premium on Ghostbusters and here's the dilemma it's two it is

[23:26] two thousand dollars less than the Hobbit and I think a year ago if you put a

[23:32] stern pin next to Jersey Jack's pin they were worlds apart you couldn't really

[23:37] see the difference now yes display wise stern is still looking a little bit in

[23:42] this you know in the stone age with a DMD versus Jack's beautiful display well

[23:47] it's timing though I mean don't forget if this happened when Hobbit was first

[23:51] said oh Jersey Jack's gonna do the Hobbit and they had this thing it's gonna be

[23:54] a drag everybody was super excited about it but now you got to remember this is

[23:59] years later and now Ghostbusters is announced and guess what it's shipping

[24:05] right shipping next month so it's like everyone's excited and they can get

[24:09] their hands on it right now it's amazing that it is gonna come out so soon I

[24:13] mean that's what I love to it's like stirring they reveal it and guys are are

[24:18] really literally like talking in how many how many days before they start

[24:23] shipping you know yeah well that's the thing it's looking at it looks great and

[24:27] you can get it so that money it's like you know something well alien okay

[24:31] when's Ellie gonna be done is it gonna be done in in three months and six

[24:36] months and when's it gonna be ready to be delivered Ghostbusters is here now

[24:39] they're getting ready to ship next month so the minutes it's tough when you

[24:45] can have a machine in your house right away and it's like you know this is not

[24:48] from a startup company this is stern so you know that has to you know carry some

[24:53] weight too it's not you're not getting a you know a big Lebowski or an

[24:56] aliens from from a startup company I mean this is this is you know stern we're

[24:59] talking about but you know hey look they did Ghostbusters it's gonna it's gonna

[25:03] do great I hope it does great for them I hope you know Star Wars comes out

[25:07] that I'm sure it's gonna be another another big machine and you know well I

[25:11] can think about is that guy happily married taking the heat off you for a

[25:15] while I mean yeah well let's let's talk about that because that that sort of

[25:20] came out of nowhere to sort of Adela field this this week on Pinside another

[25:28] podcaster emerge it's I do feel like Canadians given birth to this a whole new

[25:33] category of pinball podcasting like and I want to title it the honest podcast

[25:38] where people are just being completely transparent and in full candor telling

[25:43] us how they feel with absolutely no filter not necessarily not necessarily

[25:48] sure I agree with going full no filter as we saw this week with happily

[25:52] married podcast what do you think when you when you you saw this video you have

[25:57] to realize too he had explained on that that that was the what he did after he

[26:02] was booted off that thing so he was very angry he was he was pissed off that

[26:05] whole thing and it went on this rant so I guess you know take it as that but so

[26:11] I actually got hit up by him what's his name I think it's Michael right I

[26:17] happily married that's all I know and well I watch his YouTube video and I did

[26:22] I did find it funny because it was it was just so shocking and over the top

[26:27] and I couldn't stop laughing right I didn't watch the whole thing I have to

[26:30] admit I only watch like six minutes or so and but I was I was literally laughing so

[26:35] hard I was chewing a piece of gum and I threw my head back and I almost choked on

[26:38] the gum I was letting I shut it off I said this this is hysterical but you know

[26:42] what what makes me crazy is this is nothing new there's 80 people on that

[26:49] thread and they're all complaining about this guy bitch and about I mean if I

[26:52] didn't want to be there I just wouldn't open thread it's like they're all there if

[26:57] no one would go there he'd be there by himself and that would be the end of it

[27:00] but no it's like a car accident everybody's got to line up to see this right I

[27:05] was kind of surprised that the mod sort of let it go there's nothing

[27:11] happening they shouldn't I mean he's he's being relatively pleasant there's

[27:16] nothing there's like everybody else is just going crazy you know and it's you

[27:20] know they bitch and bitch and then they still show up it's just get the help

[27:26] off the thread do something else participate in a thread that you're

[27:29] interested in not just they're doing that with him if you don't like them don't

[27:33] bother with them it's it's very very simple I'll say this you know I do like

[27:37] people sharing their opinions and being unfiltered but I don't feel comfortable

[27:42] when the attacks do get personal like where people are physically threatening

[27:46] people you know show up at my house if you want to say that I mean it it's a

[27:50] form we're talking about pinball and everyone should just have cooler heads and

[27:55] like if you want to be critical of someone like and what they say fine but once

[27:59] it gets to a thread of physical violence I think we've crossed the line yeah I

[28:05] know just saying you know again that's his you know the way you have used your

[28:10] style and I have mine that's his style is to come off as this angry you know guy

[28:15] and and look you know what if people don't want to listen to it don't listen like I

[28:20] said I have to six minutes I shut it off you know I was done I was amusing to me it

[28:25] was funny but I didn't need to listen to I remember how long it was 20 minutes of

[28:28] that because I get it I get the point that's just you know that's his thing it

[28:32] may not be my favorite thing either but you know I if you don't want to listen to

[28:36] shut it all off right you know so I mean it's no force you get anyone to listen to

[28:39] what right I think that's a good point because in the threads here it's like it is

[28:43] fun everyone always goes into the threads that they say they don't want to go

[28:46] into it no one made them no one made them go in it how about we talk about this

[28:50] let's talk about well now the Ghostbusters is out what's coming up next what

[28:56] what do we have we have as far as I see right now we have Star Wars might be

[29:01] coming from Stern right is it for sure they got the rights now there's nothing

[29:07] confirmed the titles that have been sort of floating around is a music pen

[29:15] next I believe and that is was it Iron Maiden and Hendrix those are like

[29:21] rumored I thought an aros myth yeah right so aros myth so those three are

[29:27] are it most likely would probably be Aros myth or Iron Maiden I can't see

[29:32] Hendrix being a top runner there could be supposed to happen before Star Wars

[29:37] yeah so I don't think Star Wars is gonna happen until the next movie it would be

[29:43] kind of weird to do it I mean maybe they're just doing episode seven force

[29:51] Awakens pin I don't know or they might yeah because it's I don't know you know

[29:56] it would be smart to do it at the end of the trilogy and sort of have all

[30:02] three so I don't know what their plans are for Star Wars I mean it's like no

[30:05] both Jersey Jack and Stern were after Star Wars they both have to get the

[30:10] rights I don't know maybe somebody out there really has some you know some

[30:13] real information about that about if it was you know these guys he's lawyer

[30:16] guys they go in there and they look in these they find out who got the right

[30:20] they figure it out so maybe we can find out who has the rights on that one but

[30:25] what about Jersey Jack's next pin well you got Lawler's which everyone is

[30:30] knows it's coming from him the exact theme of it is not so sure there was

[30:36] that there was that ex-employee who sort of whistle blew do you remember that

[30:39] when he sort of revealed some of the internal yeah there was a something like

[30:42] muppets or there was like like four or five different potential titles there

[30:46] yeah and then he had a lot of details about Lawler's game that and it seemed

[30:51] like it was based around has something that used the cell phone and but it's

[30:57] not you know and knowing that Pat can come at stuff in such a unique way from a

[31:04] creative standpoint it's hard to even guess like sometimes I heard people

[31:07] are guessing it was like a natural disaster pin then we heard it

[31:11] it implements like cell phones it has to do with like technology so who I mean

[31:16] who knows I don't see I mean they can't make any nonsense now I mean Hobbit

[31:20] is just starting to ship so you probably have you know months you know before

[31:25] that's gonna happen what about what about the remakes I mean there was rumors

[31:30] that they were they were gonna have a tack from Mars ready to go is it gonna be

[31:34] monster bash big bang bar cactus Canyon you know so they they just announced

[31:40] planetary just announced that they won't be they're supposed to unveil their

[31:45] next game at Texas pinball festival next week and they announced this week

[31:49] that they won't be doing that and apparently there's some delay on parts or

[31:55] whatnot I don't know if they were planning on revealing it and actually showing it

[31:58] versus just announcing it but the rumor there is heavily heavily on a tack

[32:03] from Mars being the pin that's next yeah well somebody told me that they were

[32:09] guessing attack from Mars because they said planetary got in a gigantic

[32:13] shipment of of attack from Mars parts right so that's why I thought you know

[32:19] that was a possibility but then again someone else said well you know what they

[32:23] may be getting shipments of all kinds of parts of all you know because they

[32:26] supply parts for everything so here's here's yeah and here's what I think is

[32:30] gonna happen now I mean we were we were talking about this when you're talking

[32:33] ghost buses but I do think the future of pinball so much more exciting than

[32:37] remaking the past I I when we were talking about where's your money gonna go

[32:41] attack from Mars is not even a hard pin to get now it is not a pin that cost

[32:48] more than $7,000 and good condition eight thousand dollars maybe I see

[32:53] someone eBay for even more than that but the thing is if you want one you can go

[32:57] get one right so to remake that pin and then try and charge eight nine thousand

[33:02] for it yeah I don't think that's I don't think that's gonna fly I think maybe

[33:07] monster bash big bang bar and cactus can you can get the bigger dollars I don't

[33:12] know if attack from Mars can can it's a simpler machine I don't I mean I would

[33:16] personally like to get one but you know now I'm like everybody else I mean I

[33:21] thought you know aliens is gonna be you know pretty much it then all of a sudden

[33:26] you know we got we got Rob Zombie and now this this Ghostbusters thing is coming

[33:31] out and now maybe Star Wars and we don't know what the new journey I don't know

[33:35] I just don't I'm just I am concerned that there is there's just not enough

[33:42] there's gonna be more volume than there's gonna be demand for all of these and I

[33:47] think it's gonna be it's not everyone's gonna survive let me say that I think

[33:51] people are naive to think that all pinball is gonna survive the next two years

[33:56] you're gonna seek a company that is a boutique not make it it's just it's the

[34:01] law of averages and you these there's not gonna be a market for all of them it

[34:07] this is not that's my prediction I think you're I mean both you gotta go by

[34:12] the numbers I mean Rob Zombie sold out already so that's so we know we're

[34:16] getting another you know pin from spooky I mean he's that they're already

[34:18] doing was that the dominoes thing and they're they're gonna do another pin I

[34:21] mean they're sold out big Lebowski that that's a game I got totally fooled on I

[34:27] would have thought that there would be maybe 50 or 100 people we get a big

[34:31] Lebowski I had no idea that they would you know do decent numbers alien is like

[34:35] an obrainer if that game plays real good you know it's gonna it's gonna be a

[34:40] hit but if it's just okay but it all depends on how the toys look and everything

[34:45] because now they got Ghostbusters you know compete with another science

[34:49] fictiony fantasy type theme that is gonna be you know some kind of competition

[34:53] for them so you know they have to really beef that up and have a lot of cool

[34:57] toys on it and stuff and I'm I'm sure they will so and well you know it's

[35:03] it's gonna be interesting I think this is gonna be the most this year is gonna

[35:07] be the most exciting year in the past few years I mean everyone got burned on

[35:11] pre-orders and boutique failed promises and you know 20 not everybody just

[35:16] people are putting to J pop and the J pop predator I mean we think about it

[35:21] what what boutiques have really shipped other than America's most honnett

[35:25] well if I'm missing something I mean it's like none that didn't number I mean I

[35:29] think that that Nemo one ships but they only get like even the you know I think

[35:33] what 15 games I mean where I saw like one set up by the manufacturer somewhere

[35:39] no there's there there there isn't you just have those handful of companies I

[35:42] mean but I mean hey let's face it if you know that this company is set up to do

[35:49] pinball machines I mean if aliens is even a halfway decent hit they're gonna

[35:53] go on they've got there they're ready to go so I don't I don't have too much

[35:56] worry about them but nobody is gonna survive that that small company is not

[36:01] gonna survive two flops on a row but I think they're smart enough to know

[36:04] exactly what to do spooky as well I think they've got a pretty good handle on

[36:09] it you know they're good they're sold out so you know what there's a lot of

[36:14] people out there with a lot of money and you know some of these people you

[36:18] look at their collections they're buying pretty much everything that's out

[36:21] there like you said though how long can we sustain that if there's like five or

[36:25] ten great machines in two-year period that might be a little rough I don't know

[36:30] well there used to be people used to have natural breeders between new and box

[36:34] right if you or someone who wanted every new and box game that came out in the

[36:39] last five years you've always had a pretty well yes stern but you've also had

[36:46] like a decent amount of time between purchases because even with stern you know

[36:51] they were you know I doubt no one really goes in on every stern right I mean they've

[36:55] had like hits and misses so you go in on you know people love Metallica but you

[36:59] know a lot of people passed on WWE a lot of people passed on Mustang but stern

[37:05] is really on a roll right now you know it's interesting too I saw in the Ghostbusters

[37:09] thread someone couldn't you know they couldn't resist putting a picture of

[37:15] Game of Thrones and being like get the hell out of here like Ghostbusters you know

[37:20] it's like and I it does a little bit feel that way right that these there's the

[37:26] shelf life of being the hot new thing in pinball if is getting shorter and

[37:32] shorter and shorter and and and I think a lot of these guys want to have the

[37:38] pin that's hot and so we're it's gonna be interesting seeing them all crash

[37:42] I was thinking too I mean you know if you have two great game I mean the people I

[37:47] know that played Game of Thrones at least that's a really good game so so I

[37:52] mean there's some people out there and there's a few of them the thread they have

[37:55] no interesting Ghostbusters whatsoever those all so they just don't have an

[37:58] interest in it whereas Game of Thrones is the new thing and they want it so I

[38:02] mean the theme that's where the theme is gonna come in I mean it's gonna be if

[38:06] you get two games are equally really cool the theme is really gonna play a big

[38:10] part and it's gonna be theme and gameplay right there is no way that right I'm

[38:15] saying it both they're both even if it's a game play and the coolest factors

[38:18] both even then they're gonna go what they like right and even even gameplay style

[38:23] right because I think what I would love to have is a few pins where each pin is

[38:28] a different style gameplay like one is really great at flow one might have a

[38:31] deep rule set one might be a really fast difficult game like an Iron Man or

[38:36] Tron is it's there's no way Ghostbusters is gonna have the flow of Game of Thrones

[38:43] I mean there's so much on the Ghostbusters play field it's exciting but there's a

[38:47] lot of tight shots right and when you have tight shots and a lot of stuff packed

[38:50] in that's definitely gonna make the gameplay not be as of fast and furious and

[38:56] flow the way like a Game of Thrones way I guess we'll see yeah I mean we're

[39:00] saying that there might be a video up but the next day or two right I think it's

[39:03] Tuesday I think Jack Danger is going over there from dead flip to to reveal the

[39:08] gameplay footage next Tuesday on Twitch that's what I'll say that gameplay is

[39:13] good good luck trying to find an Ellie yeah well your factor stuff right now

[39:17] no I yeah I saw I've seen really I it's the Ellie's gonna sell out if they're

[39:22] not already sold out I think today I've never I've never seen in my I've been on

[39:27] pinside now for almost like two and a half three years you've been on it longer

[39:33] right Ted I think 15 have you ever seen a stern reveal met with so much

[39:40] enthusiasm is this and not even the kiss you know thing was it didn't seem to be as big

[39:47] now this this is huge this is this is this is if the gameplay is really good on this

[39:52] this is this is gonna be a home run all the way around and it's so funny it's like

[39:55] you're talking about they came up with all of you know this really cool stuff to

[39:59] look into Star Wars and I'm looking into what and then what what is the big hit

[40:03] that gets knocked out of the park is the old film right it's like those it's ghost

[40:07] fusters right you know so it just goes to show you this is the kind of stuff

[40:10] you know people want one and also what's you know ghostbusters is sort of like

[40:14] that iconic theme that somehow pinball missed back in the day I mean they

[40:20] they're never was a ghostbusters pin so and the timing couldn't be more perfect for stern

[40:26] with the with the new movie out I do recommend people listen to

[40:31] coast to coast pinball and eight shivers interviewed jody from stern about how they secure the

[40:37] license and how they went about making the pinball with with zombie yeti it's a really great

[40:41] interview that gives goes into a lot of detail about how this game came to life oh actually

[40:46] yeah well it's interesting too because with zombie yeti you know we've heard from other you

[40:53] know other license pinball machines coming out how hard it is to work with the license it seemed like

[40:58] the Sony pictures was really really cool and flexible with stern in terms of letting them have

[41:05] some freedoms but you know where I think we're stern what they did smart was they got zombie yeti

[41:09] so when they gave them the asset book to say here's what you need to create zombie yeti went and drew

[41:16] that stuff and showed them how cool it could look if it was all hand drawn and they were like this

[41:21] looks phenomenal like let's let's go with this sort of cartoonist turn two don't forget so I mean

[41:26] they're doing this every day I mean they've got this infrastructure already ready to go

[41:30] getting the licenses and all this stuff for them I mean this is just another day at work

[41:34] right you know so they've then got that that stuff all in place so hey look it's nice it's

[41:37] going to be nice having all the call outs be able to use all the clips from the film I guess

[41:41] that I hope I hope they hit it out of the park and and I'm looking forward to seeing what the

[41:46] gameplay looks like in a couple days what about you Tato would you I know I know you're you're

[41:51] looking at these new pins and would you consider a ghost buster is after what you saw today um

[41:57] you know again for me because it's it's it's it's not a big thing I really have to see the gameplay

[42:02] on it so I mean I really need the whole package and I need a reliable sheet because I can't do

[42:07] anything you know changing a bulb to me that's a major problem right so I mean it's uh you know

[42:13] I'm gonna probably wait a little bit to see what happens I mean they'll they'll be out there and

[42:16] if I and if I really want it and you have to pay a little bit more you know that that's okay

[42:20] so I mean I'm gonna probably in my collection I'm probably only gonna have at one point

[42:24] maybe three machines and that's really gonna be about it and scared Steph I'll probably one of them

[42:28] and it sounds like yeah well you gotta get that back yeah it sounds like you're in close proximity

[42:34] though it's a lot of pinball collectors too right so it's it's fantastic I've got on one side of me

[42:41] I go out make a left out of my driveway within 12 to 15 minutes I got two people and if I go the

[42:47] other way down to New York uh New York State literally seven minutes from me I have a whole

[42:54] fucking gaggle of machines so I mean this is anytime I really want to go play a machine I have

[43:00] someone less between seven and 15 minutes from my house that has a lot of machines so so I'm very

[43:06] I'm very lucky I'm gonna get chance to play those machines uh you know right away right so

[43:11] that I want to thank you for coming on I'm actually gonna have happily married as a guest soon I

[43:15] think the two of us together could cause the whole hobby to spontaneously combust the same you know

[43:20] at the same time oh yeah that would be fun yeah so so happily married um so how are you uh how

[43:27] you doing today fuck you well maybe we'll have a three maybe we'll do a three way I want that's

[43:33] the next time we got you mean talking yeah no I mean I mean fuck these pinball machines let's get

[43:38] along guys um we got you gotta get uh MJ Gecko on because like we gotta get him talking about his

[43:44] collection and and because I know he's got a stellar one and and that would be a great uh so we

[43:49] could we could have like the three of us talk about that that'd be fun interview well certainly ask him

[43:53] all right Ted well thank you for taking the time I'm gonna edit this down so it is like a half hour

[43:58] no more these hour two hour interviews none of us have something that's that interesting to say about

[44:03] pinball um Ted thank you for taking the time tonight no problem and I'm gonna have the good stuff

[44:08] say a little all right Ted good night

[44:38] you
