[00:00] I'm going down there and seeing what I saw.

[00:06] That's point blank.

[00:07] I'll just say that and that's it.

[00:08] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[00:10] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[00:13] Get ready. It's all the way.

[00:17] Get ready. It's all the way.

[00:20] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[00:23] People want to know this is the new toy on the market right now

[00:27] and people are excited.

[00:28] People that love pinball want to see what's out there.

[00:30] And what we've seen over the last three weeks has been very, very exciting.

[00:35] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[00:37] Get ready. It's all the way.

[00:39] We just we we willed it into existence.

[00:42] Bringing Rosas in a life when everyone said that Rosas could never come to life

[00:46] because it was just one of J-pop's projects that would never see the light of day.

[00:51] Rosas is like a little cliff note.

[00:53] Yeah.

[00:54] Storyboard compared to a quinn and Steve having store for you, especially quinn for it.

[00:58] For games to come.

[00:59] So anyway.

[01:00] I mean, I'm just looking forward to keep going on these journey.

[01:03] Yeah.

[01:04] We're seeing what else we can do because the plans we have, I just can't relay how hard it was

[01:11] to bring the pinball to life.

[01:14] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[01:16] Get ready. It's all the way.

[01:18] Pinball is well persevere and so will we.

[01:21] Yeah. Well, then that's and I hope I don't embarrass Robert by this.

[01:24] But one of the things that I just really, really respect him and admire him for

[01:28] and one of the things that makes it such a great, a great blessing to be here is

[01:32] that he will not quit.

[01:35] Get ready. It's all the way.

[01:37] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[01:39] Personally, I can't wait for the criticism.

[01:41] I'm looking forward to the criticism.

[01:43] If I put my money down on this game, when will I get it?

[01:47] What's the packing order here?

[01:49] We have four phases and the four phases basically, the first phase being four to six weeks

[01:53] to try to build up slowly.

[01:55] You know, whether we sell 100 rosers or we sell a couple of hundred rosers, right?

[02:00] We want to make sure that we get done in about a three to four month period.

[02:05] Get ready. It's all the way.

[02:07] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[02:09] We have 20 plus games, Jeff.

[02:12] You're killing it.

[02:13] We have 20 plus games that we're ready to pop out in the world.

[02:17] If we ever make rosers again, we can't wait for people to have one in their home.

[02:22] Okay, so there it is.

[02:24] You've got this three week window to purchase this game until the end of the year.

[02:28] And then that's it because more titles will be coming from DeepRoot.

[02:32] Get ready. It's all the way.

[02:34] It's the best decision I've ever made.

[02:36] Let DeepRoot do what they have to do and when they release it, that's great.

[02:39] Do you have a number of how many games are going to be made per week kind of thing

[02:43] or I guess is that part of the reason for the pre-order to kind of see how many parts you have to buy and this and that.

[02:50] Well, look, a lot of parts are already bought.

[02:52] We have some of our parts. We have for hundreds of machines or even some parts, thousands of machines.

[02:58] Get ready. It's all the way. It's the best decision I've ever made.

[03:01] We're going to pop these rosers off the line according to the very transparent store in ordering policies that we have on our website.

[03:08] I'm going to make good business decisions for my business.

[03:11] The innovations are incredible. The innovations are incredible. The innovations are incredible.

[03:17] I can hardly wait to get my hands on it.

[03:20] Two years ago, a few months ago, I said, get ready.

[03:22] That was more for me than anyone else because of how nervous I felt being on the same stage as all those ordinary areas that were there.

[03:31] All those games sold and games designed.

[03:34] Here I am with nothing out there just hopefully representing as well as I could.

[03:40] But now we're here. We're here.

[03:43] And I can't wait for you all to play, Raza.

[03:47] I'm so looking forward to it. Ready? People are possible.

[03:50] Playing, Raza, and then also playing the next game.

[03:54] I wanted to say thank you for the deeper sponsorships of several pinball things.

[03:58] A couple of years ago, at T-P-F, the Wizards Championship and the good prizes that went along with that.

[04:04] You've supported great organizations like this week in pinball.

[04:07] I'm forgetting many, but personally, the pinball profile world tour that I was able to do a year ago wouldn't have been possible without yourself.

[04:14] And you know, there were seven sponsors that came on board and I just wanted to thank you for everything that Deep Brew did for that.

[04:20] The best decision I've ever made. Get ready. It's awesome.

[04:24] It's making it a whole team.
