[00:00] Here I am in this city with all this money dollars and baby, you better believe.

[00:10] I'm back, back in the New York blue.

[00:14] I'm back, back in the New York blue.

[00:18] Cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera.

[00:23] Oh, everybody, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:26] We are back in the New York groove coming at you from New York City.

[00:29] The Giants are winning in the post season.

[00:33] It's been like 11 years or something.

[00:35] It's crazy, everybody.

[00:36] Let's talk about pinball.

[00:38] Let's talk about 2023.

[00:39] Let's talk about what we think is going to happen in Q1 of 2023, because I think this is going to be a year, people.

[00:46] I really mean it.

[00:47] This is going to be a year to remember in pinball, either for better or for worse.

[00:53] It's going to be one of those years where we say 2023 was one of those pinball years that either reinforced why we love pinball so much,

[01:04] or it could be a year where we start to get a little bit burnt out on the high prices,

[01:11] on these companies' failure to deliver more creativity for the money.

[01:17] And yes, Mr. Ed Robertson, he's listening right now.

[01:20] We can have a conversation about value.

[01:24] I love Ed so much, but he's like, you can't have a conversation about value, Canada, because it's subjective.

[01:30] Yes, to a point, Ed, you're right, but you can't charge $150 for a quarter pounder with cheese, right?

[01:39] Imagine if Burger King and McDonald's were like Stern and JJP, and they were trying to find the price ceiling on our love of cheeseburgers, okay?

[01:49] Now look, a cheeseburger is great, but there's only so much you can charge for that cheeseburger until you start putting like gold leaf and beluga caviar on top of it.

[02:00] So we're going to talk about what I think is going to happen over the next couple of months with each of these companies before I get there.

[02:06] I want to say thank you to our new club members.

[02:08] John Greatwitch has joined the show. Jeremy, Thomas K, Kai Jettel, BS, whatever that means.

[02:15] We've got Greg T, Mr. JG, Mr. Adam P, Rick B, Sarah O'Donovan.

[02:22] My wife's sister has joined the show.

[02:25] I can guarantee you Sarah O'Donovan, who's now a $10 a month club member, is probably not going to listen to a single episode.

[02:34] But if she's listening, Sarah, we love you. Thank you for joining the show.

[02:38] E&M, Mario V, Enzo V, Maddie L.

[02:43] The list goes on and on. I'm missing some of you.

[02:45] We keep climbing, man. This thing keeps going in the wrong direction for the Canadian haters, and the Canadian haters are out there.

[02:51] But the fun part is I've just stopped listening to everybody else.

[02:54] I'm just here to have fun with you guys and the Canadian Facebook Live page and this Patreon page and Jengiz.

[03:00] We're having a great time.

[03:01] I don't know why anyone would moan and groan about the world's favorite pinball podcast.

[03:05] We took it behind the paywall.

[03:07] Okay, so let's talk about what we think is going to happen in the first half of 2023.

[03:11] I'm also going to talk about the fact that I did buy another pinball machine, and I'm going to come clean about why I bought another Batman 66 Super Limited Edition.

[03:21] Yes, I spent a lot of money on it.

[03:23] Yes, you might think I'm a hypocrite for spending a lot of money on it.

[03:26] But I'm here to tell you on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I think I got it for the market value.

[03:32] And ultimately, the market's going to determine the price on these games.

[03:35] Because if you come in underneath market value on a game like a Batman 66 SLE, guess what's going to happen?

[03:42] You're not going to be able to get one.

[03:44] And so I really wanted to get the game again.

[03:46] I'm going to explain why.

[03:47] I know Bill Branis is super upset with me, but let's not start there.

[03:51] Let's end with why I bought another Batman SLE.

[03:55] So let's go around the horn.

[03:56] This is always fun.

[03:57] Like beginning of the week, what's going on with these pinball companies?

[04:00] Okay, we have now reached the point of absolute fatigue and exhaustion in the James Bond 60th thread.

[04:07] I'm not going to beat a dead horse.

[04:09] There's 108 pages of grown men moaning and groaning about this game.

[04:16] I'm going to just say this.

[04:18] This game was a failure.

[04:20] And the reason why it's a failure, Mr. Ed Robertson,

[04:23] if they priced this game properly, it would have sold out.

[04:29] It's not only not sold out.

[04:31] Distributors are sitting on a ton of this product.

[04:35] There are not enough people out there that are so rich that they don't care to have a value conversation.

[04:43] And I mean it when I say it.

[04:45] See, we were willing to accept this game somewhere around maybe 12 or $13,000.

[04:51] Okay, we were willing to go that far on a game that's hideous, a game with no effort whatsoever in the art department,

[04:59] a game that doesn't have anything really innovative on the play field whatsoever.

[05:03] I was willing, Stern, to give you 12 to 13,000 for one of these.

[05:08] Even that is an insult when you think about it.

[05:11] Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition was 12,500.

[05:15] This game is an insult to that price.

[05:18] But for $19,995, it is impossible to even look at this game without spitting your drink out, laughing out loud.

[05:29] And anyone who tells you otherwise is simply trying to sell you the game.

[05:35] Every single major distributor I know has this game in stock.

[05:40] They will have it in stock for many, many years to come.

[05:44] It's going to be just like Beatles Diamond all over again.

[05:48] Okay, so I don't care about this game.

[05:50] Of course I'll play it.

[05:51] Of course I'll have fun with it.

[05:53] And I will never in a million years have any desire to own one.

[05:58] I get it.

[05:59] It's going to be fun to shoot, but it's not a collectible.

[06:02] There's nothing about this that feels collectible.

[06:04] Okay, so that's going to come and go.

[06:06] Like this game is going to come and go like a fart in the wind.

[06:08] And then we're going to get to Stern's next game sometime in March.

[06:12] We're going to get to Stern cornerstone games in 2023.

[06:16] Now that's the big question mark.

[06:18] Is it going to be Venom, which is Brian Eddy and Zombie Eddy?

[06:21] I think Venom is going to be next.

[06:23] And then I think Jack Danger is up as a cornerstone title in 2023.

[06:29] I think many of us are somewhat bummed out.

[06:32] We're not going to get a Keith Elwin cornerstone game in 2023.

[06:37] We're going to have to wait to 2024.

[06:40] I know everybody wishes in 2024 the Keith Elwin game is going to be back to the future.

[06:46] I don't have any evidence that that's going to be the case,

[06:49] but just saying that Stern pinball and Keith Elwin give you back to the future makes everybody so excited.

[06:56] But don't get your hopes so high for that game.

[06:58] I think there's a lot of licensing issues with getting the back to the future theme.

[07:03] So Venom in March, will that be the case?

[07:06] Will Stern get this game out before Texas pinball festival?

[07:09] I think they will.

[07:11] I think we're going to see it sometime in March.

[07:13] And I think it's going to be a beautiful game.

[07:15] You know, this is Zombie Eddy's perfect art style for him.

[07:18] His comic book style artwork.

[07:20] He's going to make this game look incredible.

[07:22] But I'm going to predict this right now.

[07:24] If it is Venom and it is Brian Eddy and it is $13,000 for in LE,

[07:30] I think we're going to see another scenario where more and more people are going to wait to play the game.

[07:35] There is absolutely no need to rush in with this many games at this much money because you're never going to miss out.

[07:42] And I think it's a good thing.

[07:44] And it's really weird for me for people to label this as a toxic or negative approach to this hobby.

[07:52] It's not, it's not at all.

[07:54] You know, I was speaking to Melissa over at CoinTaker.

[07:56] We had a really good conversation about this and there's all these different sides to the coin.

[08:01] Well, there's actually just two sides to the coin.

[08:04] But we were just talking about like where did all these high prices come from?

[08:08] And it's not just the manufacturers.

[08:10] It's also the consumers who have been running towards every single launch that have shown these manufacturers they can keep increasing the price.

[08:18] It's not like the distros want the prices to go up and up and up.

[08:22] They don't get more margins if these games go up and up in value.

[08:26] It's really the pinball manufacturers that are going to benefit.

[08:29] And look, I've never seen a game like James Bond where everybody loses.

[08:33] The consumers are losing because they're not getting anywhere near 20K in the product.

[08:38] The distributors are losing because they have to order these damn things without customers already lined up, which they're not used to.

[08:45] And Stern Pinball is going to lose because people are going to see this launch as a greedy cash grab move.

[08:52] And it's going to turn people off to Stern Pinball.

[08:55] It's just going to do it.

[08:57] Now look, do I think that's going to impact their bottom line in 2023?

[09:00] Probably not.

[09:02] They're going to be backlogged still on all of these older titles, but it's not a good move when it comes to building the brand of pinball.

[09:11] So I think we're going to see Venom and then I think we're going to see Jack Danger's game.

[09:14] Now the two themes we keep hearing about possibly for Jack Danger are Foo Fighters and He-Man Masters of the Universe.

[09:23] Now you know me.

[09:24] I'll tell you when I know what I think the theme is going to be.

[09:27] I'm not sure what Jack Danger's next theme is.

[09:31] Stern does a good job of keeping things under wraps.

[09:35] The reason why we know it's Venom is because it was right around the corner before they hit pause on it.

[09:40] And the closer we get to a release date of a new Stern machine, more and more distributors and more and more people that are close to the company,

[09:48] they start to talk a little bit and that's how these rumors sort of percolate.

[09:52] You know I'm the only show where if I know something you want to know, I'm not going to hold it back.

[09:58] And yes I'm wrong sometimes, but who cares if I'm wrong sometimes.

[10:02] But no one ever gives me credit when I'm right.

[10:04] It's funny right? When I'm right, I'd rather be right 60% of the time and give you guys all the information I know

[10:11] than never tell you anything and then just make fun of Canadian because he's only right this percentage of time.

[10:17] So what? We're all having fun.

[10:19] Part of pinball fun is speculating on these rumors.

[10:22] Like the rumor that Jersey Jack number eight is coming out February 20th.

[10:26] I don't know. Like that's what I'm hearing in the rumor mill that sometime in February we should see a new Jersey Jack game.

[10:32] Now it's either going to be the new Jersey Jack game or maybe it's the new American pinball game.

[10:37] But I'll tell you this Jersey Jack needs to get a new game on the line.

[10:41] Toy Story sales have absolutely flat lined.

[10:44] I mean they're sitting in box all over the place at distributors around the world.

[10:49] Sales in Europe are done. They're flat lined.

[10:52] Nobody's going to go get the game now.

[10:54] So look, we're all looking forward to what's next from Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:58] And look, it wasn't just yesterday when Toy Story came out.

[11:02] It's been out since July. Let's count the months right now.

[11:05] July, August, September, October, November, December, January, right?

[11:11] Seven months ago this game came out.

[11:14] It wasn't just yesterday and it's seven months of a game on the line where demand has all but dried up.

[11:22] So I would expect Jersey Jack pinball to get a new game out in the next few months.

[11:27] If they were smart, I think they would do that.

[11:30] And look, if it doesn't happen, right? Let's just say hypothetically like Jersey Jack does not get out a game in February.

[11:36] Does that make Canadian pinball podcast any less entertaining?

[11:39] If I get that wrong, have I committed some crime against pinball factual reporting?

[11:45] As if in the media world that's out there, you need to factually get your pinball facts correct.

[11:51] Or else what? Or else nothing happens.

[11:55] Ed Robertson is still rich. Bill Branis has still got V12 Ferraris.

[11:59] And I'm still living in a one bedroom in New York City.

[12:02] Ain't nothing going to change if I get these facts right or wrong.

[12:06] And that's why you're here listening to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[12:09] Because at least we're speculating about these things.

[12:12] Has anyone else even given you a ballpark date by which you can expect the next Jersey Jack game?

[12:18] And what fun is that? It's not.

[12:20] That's why everybody else is listening to Canada and Canada is not listening to anybody else.

[12:25] Now look, I keep hearing something from Christopher Franci who we know is working on Godfather or Eric Minier's next game.

[12:32] I think it's Godfather.

[12:33] Every time I'm on Facebook Live and I'm like, I want a magical game.

[12:37] We need a magical game that's going to wow us.

[12:39] Franci keeps saying that he's working on five games that are going to wow us.

[12:46] Now look, his artwork is incredible.

[12:48] It's one of the reasons why I'm getting another Batman.

[12:50] I absolutely love his artwork.

[12:52] But he's saying that he is working on five pinball machines that are going to wow us.

[12:58] Now look, I would just take one, one machine to wow us.

[13:02] We didn't have any real machine to wow us in 2022.

[13:06] Two machines would be amazing, but five pinball machines are going to wow us.

[13:12] I have a hard time believing that, but look, we know his art is great and he's clearly very excited about what he's working on.

[13:19] Here's what we know he is working on.

[13:22] He's working on the next Eric Minier game.

[13:25] We think it's Godfather.

[13:27] Then we know he's working on the Galactic Space Battle game from American Pinball, the Dennis Nordman game.

[13:33] That's two of five.

[13:36] I don't know what the other stuff is.

[13:39] I heard it was Pulp Fiction, but then he said it's not Pulp Fiction.

[13:42] So I'm not sure, but at least there's some excitement and hype there because I can't wait to see what the five projects are that Christopher Franci is working on.

[13:52] The other one that I think he's working on is Mark Richie supposedly is working on another licensed property game that Chicago Gaming Company is coming out with.

[14:02] Now, what would make everybody really excited?

[14:05] Imagine if Mark Richie and CGC and Christopher Franci, imagine if they made Beetlejuice for Chicago Gaming Company.

[14:13] Now, we know Beetlejuice is a great theme for pinball.

[14:16] Tim Burton needs a pinball machine, whether it's Pee Wee's Big Adventure or Beetlejuice or Edward Scissorhands.

[14:23] His entire world.

[14:25] I can't believe we do not have a Tim Burton manufactured game.

[14:30] We've got the Nightmare Before Christmas homebrew game, which is super cool, but I really hope some of the rumors that like Beetlejuice are coming.

[14:38] I hope some of them are true.

[14:40] All right, so that's what we got.

[14:41] We got Eric's JJP game is next.

[14:44] And then the question is this, when do we think we're going to see Steve Richie's Jersey Jack Pinball machine?

[14:50] And it's not just Steve Richie.

[14:52] They've also got another designer over at JJP.

[14:55] So I'm here to predict that I don't think we see two Jersey Jack Pinball machines in 2023.

[15:02] I think Jersey Jack Pinball, all they really need to do is one great game a year.

[15:08] That's it because they get to focus on one machine a year.

[15:12] I always believe they go above and beyond on their machines.

[15:15] And if they just do one great machine every 12 months, I think that's the niche JJP should fill.

[15:22] I think their games are a little bit more high end.

[15:25] And I think the price should reflect that.

[15:28] They just raised the price on the wrong game.

[15:31] And that's unfortunate.

[15:32] You know, the other thing I keep hearing people say is like, where's the Finnish code for Jersey Jack Pinball?

[15:37] A lot of people want me to do a full like episode on this.

[15:41] Where is the Finnish Pirates of the Caribbean code?

[15:44] Where is the Finnish Guns and Roses code?

[15:47] Now they have put some code updates into beta and people are testing them.

[15:52] But why does it take Jersey Jack Pinball so long to finalize the code on some of these games that have been out now for years?

[16:00] And it really is frustrating.

[16:02] Like we should be playing the final version of G&R by now.

[16:05] And you absolutely should be playing the final version of Freakin' Pirates of the Caribbean.

[16:11] But I don't know what to tell you.

[16:13] I will tell you this.

[16:15] Maybe make more of a noise and figure out a way to complain about it.

[16:19] Because the only way you're going to get it, it seems, is if you do like bang the pots and pans.

[16:24] As a company, they're happy to make you wait years without the final code.

[16:29] So I don't know.

[16:30] Maybe find a way to get in front of them more.

[16:32] But clearly asking for the code isn't going to get you it.

[16:36] Oh, Canada, you're so negative.

[16:38] How can you tell people to complain?

[16:40] So look, Eric's game is going to have a lot of attention on it.

[16:43] I hope we see it soon.

[16:44] I always have a lot of faith in Eric Minier.

[16:47] I haven't seen the game.

[16:48] So there's nothing else to say on it right now.

[16:51] I'm still worried they price themselves too high in this hobby.

[16:54] I really am.

[16:55] People are just not going to be throwing 12 or 15k at every single launch.

[17:00] Now, speaking of not being 12 or 15k, a lot of people are really happy that Spooky Pinball didn't really significantly raise prices

[17:09] on Scooby-Doo, a machine that significantly has more in it than like Halloween and Ultraman.

[17:15] And I think people are starting to really appreciate that.

[17:19] And so Spooky did a good job of winning back a lot of its goodwill.

[17:24] Even though we haven't played the game, even though we don't know the quality or the code yet,

[17:28] the fact that they didn't like significantly increase the price on this game is a good first step.

[17:35] We know they are increasing their like manufacturing facility.

[17:40] So they're planning for a future in which they can make even more titles.

[17:45] I mean Spooky Pinball is starting to get to the point now where they're nipping at the heels, I feel like, of Jersey Jack Pinball

[17:52] when it comes to like volume of games a year.

[17:55] They're not there yet.

[17:56] They're probably half the output of JJP.

[17:59] But man, from a company that went from like 150 games to now making 1969 Scooby-Doo's

[18:07] and they're also making more TNA's and they're keeping the price right around that sort of like consideration sweet spot.

[18:15] Remember, you can order a Scooby-Doo standard for like in the $8,000 range.

[18:20] And so that like $8,000 to $10,000 sweet spot, you know, before Butter Cabinet and like taxes,

[18:27] that is where Spooky Pinball is playing.

[18:30] Now, if memory serves me correct, weren't we supposed to see a stream of this game by Jack Danger sometime in January?

[18:38] I have not seen a date floated out there.

[18:41] There's basically two more weeks left in the month and I hope we get to see the game soon.

[18:46] Because there's really nothing else to talk about right now until we see the code of this game.

[18:52] Am I nervous that it's a rookie coder? Absolutely.

[18:55] Do we need to give him a chance to show us what he's got? Absolutely.

[18:59] It would be really, really cruel for any of us to say he's not going to get it done.

[19:04] Let's see what he's capable of, this DJ guy.

[19:07] I think Spooky knows it's really important they get this game right.

[19:11] A lot of customers buying just one game.

[19:14] I think the big mistake they made was splitting up the coding duties on two titles last time around.

[19:21] They weren't able to do it very effectively.

[19:23] You know, Halloween and Ultraman, they had to code both those games in parallel.

[19:27] It didn't work.

[19:28] And now we know they're focused on one theme.

[19:31] Everyone's going to be playing the same game.

[19:34] Just make everybody happy.

[19:36] It's a theme a lot of people like.

[19:38] But we're also starting to see, you know, part of what I've been saying.

[19:41] The game is still not sold out.

[19:43] They haven't really shown enough to sell it out.

[19:46] So I'm happy it has not sold out.

[19:48] I would be really worried if Scooby-Doo sold out all nineteen hundred and sixty nine of those games.

[19:54] If they sold out already with what they've shown us, then I would be like this hobby is over.

[20:01] Like we have shown these companies we don't need anything and we'll throw money at them.

[20:06] I think Scooby not selling out.

[20:08] I think James Bond, Elise struggling to sell.

[20:11] And I think like TNA 2.0 is not selling out.

[20:15] I think it's good.

[20:16] I think it shows we're starting to sort of move in the other direction.

[20:20] And that's not a negative thing that people want to wait and play something and make up their mind before they buy the game.

[20:29] Like why would anyone say that's a negative thing?

[20:32] All right, spooky show us what you got because these games are shipping in just a month or so.

[20:37] Chicago Gaming Company, right?

[20:39] They've got Cactus Canyon, LE.

[20:41] Those are starting to come out.

[20:43] There's no real news there, so I'm not even going to spend much time on it.

[20:46] The game is great.

[20:47] I don't really talk about Cactus Canyon that much, but man, if you've played one, it's a phenomenal game.

[20:52] It's a lot of fun.

[20:53] It definitely needs more code, but it's not like unsatisfying to play.

[20:58] I've always found the game a little easy to play.

[21:00] It's a fan layout.

[21:01] The shots are really smooth.

[21:03] The toys are awesome.

[21:04] I love the way they do the dots on the CGC game.

[21:08] The topper is incredible.

[21:10] And the LE package is really, really nice.

[21:13] Now look, there's one thing I don't like on the LE package.

[21:16] It's the armor itself is a little boring.

[21:19] And you know me, I like an LE package that pops, that really just pops.

[21:23] Now look, I get they were going for like that gunmetal look and it works within the theme,

[21:28] but I still think like when you make an LE or you make a CE or you make like the 60th anniversary of James Bond,

[21:37] you should make it in a way where it feels truly special.

[21:41] When you walk up to it, it's just beaming at you how this is the top of the line version of the game.

[21:48] I don't really feel that way when I walk up to Cactus Canyon LE.

[21:51] The other thing I wish they would do, and this is just me,

[21:54] if you're going to remake a game and back in the day, I know they were really lazy

[21:58] and they just threw the logo on the side of the cabinet.

[22:01] I wish they would have made the LE cabinet artwork a lot more interesting.

[22:06] Commissioning artists to make a spectacular looking new cabinet,

[22:10] you know, drawn in the style of Cactus Canyon.

[22:13] When you just have everyone looking the same, like it's all just got the big logo.

[22:17] I get what you're doing. You're remaking an old game,

[22:20] but I don't know, have some creative freedom.

[22:23] Because back in the day, they didn't really care about this stuff as much.

[22:27] Nobody was buying a tack from Mars to put into their home.

[22:30] And that's why you just see the big logo on the side.

[22:33] The only job of a pinball machine back in the day was just to communicate to you

[22:39] what the name of the game was, especially these original IP games.

[22:44] But now that these are for home collectors and we want games that are super, super sexy,

[22:49] I don't know why nobody will just have some creative liberty and make it look even better.

[22:56] Who's going to complain about that? Like who would complain about that?

[22:59] The purists are already upset that you remade it.

[23:02] I mean, think about it. The purists are not happy that you remade the game.

[23:06] Because all the purists that own the originals, you know, the guys who were trying to study

[23:10] how the flippers like operate it, like on a millisecond different delay,

[23:14] all those purists, they don't like this for real.

[23:17] You know, you'll get some of the guys to be like,

[23:19] I'm just really happy a lot more people get to experience the fun of like Cactus Canyon.

[23:23] The truth is this is made for like the modern buyer, the modern collector,

[23:28] the modern pinball and enthusiasts.

[23:30] If you're going to modernize the dots, why not modernize the cabinet artwork?

[23:35] I just don't get it.

[23:36] All right. So CGC, we're still waiting for more weird owls to come out.

[23:41] That's happening. That's trickling out.

[23:43] What else? Anything else interesting going on?

[23:45] I'm not going to talk about Mirko again.

[23:47] I'm not going to talk about Dutch pinball.

[23:49] Hopefully they figure that whole thing out.

[23:51] All right. Let me end this podcast with why I bought a Batman super limited edition.

[23:56] And I'm going to be completely transparent about why I bought it,

[23:59] why it's coming back into my collection and what I paid for it because I'm always transparent on this show.

[24:06] And I've been saying it now for the past few months is like as these new and box games are a little underwhelming,

[24:12] we're going to start looking at games from yesteryears,

[24:15] games we really know we like, we know we enjoy.

[24:18] And that's subjective people because I can already hear Bill Branis being like,

[24:22] you own two of the worst shooting games ever.

[24:25] You own guns and roses and Batman now.

[24:28] And I want to explain that look, all of us, the games we choose,

[24:32] there's a subjective reason why we want to own those games.

[24:36] And all of our reasons are different.

[24:38] But let me give you my reasons why I bought Batman SLE again.

[24:42] I owned it. I sold it for $17,000 about, I think it was like four years ago,

[24:48] maybe three years ago.

[24:50] I think it was four years ago.

[24:52] I replaced it with the Rick and Morty Batman went out $17,000.

[24:57] And my gosh has the market change since I sold it for $17,000.

[25:01] So if you go and look on the pin side marketplace right now, I mean right now,

[25:05] if you look at what Batman, Ellie's used to sell for,

[25:08] they used to sell for around $10,000 between 2016 and 2019.

[25:15] You could easily get a Batman LLE between 10 and $12,000.

[25:19] And you could also get a Batman SLE back then between like $15,000 to $18,000.

[25:25] Right? Because the notion of spending $15,000 to $18,000 on a single machine back then

[25:31] was absolute insanity. Nobody was doing it.

[25:34] There were just a couple of games that even cost more than $10,000.

[25:39] Now every single stern premium is over $10,000 with tax.

[25:44] Like times have changed.

[25:45] So those Batman LLEs, if you go and look on the pin side marketplace,

[25:49] and this is not me making this stuff up game, go look.

[25:52] The most recent sales of Batman LLEs with the topper everybody wants are around $18,000 to $19,000.

[26:01] Okay? Now I would argue that those Batman LLEs are also one of the last true LLEs stern ever made.

[26:07] There's only 240 of the LLEs with the topper.

[26:11] 120 of those LLEs were bat gadget themed and 120 of them were themed as like the show episodes.

[26:19] And every single one of them came with that amazing topper.

[26:22] This was before stern pinball decided that exclusive means included.

[26:27] And it's before stern pinball realized they could have sold each and every one of us that topper for $1,000 or $2,000.

[26:35] Instead, they included it in the price of the game.

[26:39] It made each LLE feel really special.

[26:42] All right, but you know me, you know, Canada, I like Gucci, I like the finer things in life.

[26:46] So I had an SLE, I owned it for two years.

[26:49] I heavily enjoyed it.

[26:51] I loved modding the game.

[26:53] I never had any issues with it.

[26:55] I think I had a change one node board and that was it.

[26:58] For the most part, that hood was never open on that game.

[27:02] And I just want to tell you why.

[27:04] After I sold Batman SLE, why I regret it selling the machine.

[27:09] The number one reason I regret it selling the machine is I loved playing the machine.

[27:15] And the reason why I loved playing the machine, it's not because of the game player, right?

[27:20] I'm not the best pinball player.

[27:22] The reason I loved playing Batman 66 so much is the way it pulled you into the Batman world.

[27:28] Right when you hit the start button with the theme song, another day in Gotham City

[27:33] with the campy announcement and all the call outs and all the clips from the show,

[27:38] it really transports you right into that campy, cheesy world of Batman 66.

[27:45] So I love that part of it.

[27:47] I also loved how simple it was to play the game.

[27:50] It's a deep game that has a very simple rule set.

[27:53] I love that there's like four major villains and you just have to hit each villain shot twice

[27:59] to start the villain mode. That's it.

[28:02] I could explain to anybody how to play Batman 66.

[28:07] I could explain to any casual person that walks up to the game,

[28:11] how to start stuff, how to get to wizard modes and what the point of the game is.

[28:16] Right? Isn't that a very novel idea that a pinball machine shouldn't be too hard to figure out?

[28:21] So I missed that part of the game.

[28:22] I also feel like deep down inside, we are probably never going to get another game coded

[28:27] the way Lyman sheets coded Batman 66.

[28:30] And here's what I mean by that.

[28:32] This man went through 120 episodes of Batman 66.

[28:38] He went through thousands of clips of the show.

[28:41] He meticulously and painstakingly arranged this game over a two-year period.

[28:48] We are never going to see Stern pinball ever do that again.

[28:52] We are never going to get another genius mind like Lyman sheets Jr.

[28:57] on a code like this.

[28:59] And the passion he put into it, I would still argue to this day,

[29:03] this is probably the greatest LCD coded machine of all time.

[29:09] I think Godzilla also does a really good job.

[29:12] But the way he coded this game, where like everything's coming at you in the perfect way,

[29:17] the way the music changes, the way the clips change, you're able to enjoy the show.

[29:22] You're able to look up at that screen and enjoy everything he put into it while still playing the pinball machine.

[29:29] I never felt like when you play Batman that I had to sacrifice one for the other.

[29:34] There's other games out there where like a lot's happening on the screen,

[29:37] but there's too much going on and you're not paying attention to any of it.

[29:41] Batman's not like that.

[29:42] And like Lyman knew, and this is the genius of Lyman sheets,

[29:45] he always knew like how to create through the gameplay moments of the physical machine,

[29:51] how to create those moments of pause where you can then appreciate what he's doing on the screen.

[29:57] It is such a delicate orchestra.

[30:00] Nobody knew how to do it better than Lyman sheets.

[30:03] And so I also feel really honored to have, you know, one of his games in my collection.

[30:08] And I love what he did with Batman 66.

[30:11] Another reason why, and this is a little bit of my vanity reason,

[30:14] I don't think Stern pinball is ever really going to make an LE quite like Batman 66 SLE again.

[30:20] I don't.

[30:21] I think head to toe, they made this game the most stunning Stern machine of all time.

[30:28] I think second to this is Elvira's 40th anniversary game,

[30:33] but Batman SLE, when you stand over this game, the artwork by Mr. Christopher Franci,

[30:39] and who knows if he's ever going to work for Stern again.

[30:42] That's another thing.

[30:44] We're never going to get another Lyman sheets Stern machine again.

[30:47] And we may never get a Christopher Franci Stern machine again.

[30:50] And I just feel like there's something super special about this game.

[30:54] Not only that, this was the last creative thing Adam West ever worked on.

[31:00] I mean, there's some prominence to this game that really still to this day, I feel special about it.

[31:06] And look gang, I'm telling you all this stuff, not because I'm trying to pump and dump this game.

[31:11] Like I'm not buying this game to flip it.

[31:13] I'm not buying it to sell it again.

[31:15] I'm buying this game because I regret selling it.

[31:18] I'm buying this game because I want to keep it in my pinball collection forever.

[31:23] I will be bolting this game to my floor unless I find myself in financial dire straits one day.

[31:29] I'm keeping this game.

[31:31] I think this game next to guns and roses CE is going to be a beautiful one to punch in the pinball world.

[31:37] I just don't think Stern's going to do this again.

[31:39] And me studying this market and seeing where prices are going, let me break it down like this.

[31:44] Some people just bought Godzilla LE NUEN BOX and it's sold for these prices for 18 to $19,000.

[31:52] Okay, so think about that for a minute.

[31:54] There are 1000 Godzilla's out there in the world and someone's going to spend 19,000 on a machine

[32:01] in which there are 999 others out there in the world.

[32:06] Once you unbox it, you have just another of those 1000 machines.

[32:11] I spent $25,000 on this Batman SLE.

[32:15] I paid $8,000 over what I sold mine four years ago.

[32:20] And I actually think I got a pretty good price on the machine

[32:24] because the machine I bought also has a playfield protector on it, which means there's no dimples.

[32:29] And if you played a Batman, those playfields dimple really poorly.

[32:33] So the game's mint, right? It comes from a great collector.

[32:36] He's in the Northeast and look on just a pure like how collectible it is and do I think it's going to hold value?

[32:43] I can hear Ed Robertson being like, Chris, you don't get it.

[32:46] You're back at the value conversation.

[32:48] But from a pure value collectible standpoint, I would much rather spend $25,000 on a Batman SLE

[32:56] in which there are only 80, then 19,000 or $16,000 on a Godzilla where there are a thousand of them.

[33:06] Because it's very, very rare that a Batman SLE in this condition comes up for sale.

[33:12] It doesn't happen very often.

[33:15] There is only one other game for sale right now and it is listed for $34,000.

[33:21] And so I don't feel terrible, right?

[33:23] It's so bad if I committed to buying this game for $25,000 and then you could show me like five different examples where Batman SLEs in the last couple years

[33:32] sold for around like 20 or less than 25.

[33:35] You're not going to see it.

[33:36] And so I think I paid a fair market value for it.

[33:39] Do I think it's crazy spending $25,000 on a pinball machine?

[33:43] Yes.

[33:44] Should I have done this?

[33:46] I don't really know.

[33:47] Is it going to make me happy?

[33:49] I hope so.

[33:50] I'm not sure yet.

[33:51] Of course, I've had some nights of like buyers remorse.

[33:54] Like, did I really need it?

[33:55] Did I fall victim to the FOMO?

[33:57] And the reason why I walk away feeling good is that I've owned this machine.

[34:02] I know I love playing this machine.

[34:05] I know this machine makes me happy.

[34:07] And so I really look forward to getting another one back into my collection.

[34:12] That's absolutely it.

[34:13] Those are the reasons why I'm getting the machine.

[34:16] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.
