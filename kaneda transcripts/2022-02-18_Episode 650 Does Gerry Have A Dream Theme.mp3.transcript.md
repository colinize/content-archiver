[00:00] Oh baby, do you know that's work?

[00:03] Oh heaven is a place on earth.

[00:07] They say in heaven, love comes first.

[00:11] We'll make heaven our place on earth.

[00:19] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] Happy Friday everybody.

[00:24] I got so many nice notes from people.

[00:27] And they all said the same thing.

[00:28] Chris, it was really nice hearing you talk positively about pinball for once.

[00:36] Maybe I should do more of that, right?

[00:38] I should say all the things I love in the pinball world.

[00:41] Well, you know, look, I love pinball.

[00:43] I love these machines.

[00:45] And you can tell I have a real passion for pinball.

[00:47] And I just wish we had more moments to celebrate and more games that were worth gushing over.

[00:56] And we're going to get there.

[00:57] We're going to get there.

[00:57] And hey, hey, it wouldn't be that much fun if I loved everything in pinball, right?

[01:02] There's plenty of pinball content creators out there who will give you that kind of content.

[01:07] Here's what I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:10] I want to talk about Jerry.

[01:12] We never give Jerry much airtime over at P3 Multimorphic, but he is saying that their

[01:18] game is just around the corner and he used two words.

[01:23] And these two words are either going to get people super excited about his new game or

[01:30] he is going to be dead on arrival if he does not deliver a game that contains the very

[01:38] two words he put out there.

[01:40] You know what they are?

[01:41] Dream theme.

[01:43] He said it.

[01:44] I didn't.

[01:45] He said hashtag dream theme.

[01:47] You know, they're working on the final pieces of this new game and we're going to talk about

[01:51] that.

[01:52] I want to talk a little bit about the first Rush L. Lee landing out in the world, it seems,

[01:58] and how this moment happens like every three to four months from Stern Pinball.

[02:03] And I want to talk about how these moments do humble me and they always give me a lot

[02:10] of respect for Stern Pinball and appreciation for that company and everyone over there who

[02:15] just gets it done.

[02:17] We're going to talk about Spooky Pinball and how Ultraman is limited, but you wouldn't

[02:22] know if you're looking at your machine and I just, I can't.

[02:26] I just, I want to go like in episode without bringing up Spooky and Haggis, but it's really

[02:31] hard not to because I have to call it like I see it.

[02:35] And when I see some of these decisions, it's just like, what are you doing?

[02:39] You have one job to do.

[02:41] You're making games for collectors.

[02:43] You call it a collector's edition.

[02:45] We're going to talk about this bonehead move where none of the Ultraman games are numbered.

[02:51] Like you can't see what game you have on the game plaque and how a name that is.

[02:56] And I'm going to explain why.

[02:57] And I'll just start out this show by saying we are now midway through February.

[03:03] There is still no update from Haggis Pinball.

[03:06] Damien promised a big update in January and he's gone radio silent.

[03:11] Now if you go into the thread, you can hear people starting to get a little bit anxious,

[03:18] starting to get a little bit nervous and they have every right to feel that way.

[03:23] I've said it, I'll say it again.

[03:24] I do think they will find a way to get you your games, but I don't think they're going

[03:29] to find a way to profitability.

[03:31] I just don't think it's possible when you keep going this many months.

[03:35] I bet these games won't even be fulfilled to all the customers a year after it was announced.

[03:42] I'm looking at like, I bet all 250 fathoms don't get made till like July, August.

[03:47] And here's the one thing I just want to implore on everybody, because Damien just unfriended

[03:51] me on Facebook, right?

[03:52] I'm canada the unkind.

[03:54] I get it.

[03:55] I get it.

[03:56] I'm throwing some jokes their way.

[03:57] I'm making fun of the fact that they took money nine months ago and they told people

[04:01] a production timeline that was completely made up.

[04:03] It had to have been made up.

[04:05] It had to have been made up.

[04:06] The only way you could tell people that I can take your money today and games are going

[04:10] to be on the line in two months is if you have every single part in-house ready to make

[04:15] that game.

[04:16] They know they didn't.

[04:17] They knew it was a pandemic and they still did it.

[04:19] Look, you can call me all sorts of names.

[04:21] Damien, I'm still going to shake your hand and buy you a beer if you let me at TPF.

[04:25] It's not personal, man.

[04:26] I'm just hard on the promises.

[04:29] I'm hard on the work.

[04:31] I'm hard on the timelines because someone needs to be and everyone has every right to

[04:36] be like, hey, man, where's our update?

[04:39] I'm seeing the same behavior I saw back with the other companies that had trouble.

[04:43] He's emailing people one off.

[04:45] Don't email people one off.

[04:46] Come out and make an official statement for all of your customers and not just the Fathom

[04:52] customers.

[04:53] The rest of the community is looking at this saying, hey, we just want the update.

[04:56] Is it that hard to give an update where things are at?

[04:59] You said production would start in January.

[05:01] It's now February.

[05:03] What's the update?

[05:04] That's it, man.

[05:05] That's all we want.

[05:06] Okay, let's start with Stern pinball and the fact that RushLEs are making their way out

[05:11] the door.

[05:12] They have fixed the problem of the scoop protector that was blocking the ball from going in.

[05:18] Very quick fix, easy fix, not a big deal.

[05:20] Not a game changer.

[05:22] A bit of a headache for operators who had Rush pros on location.

[05:26] I was looking at high voltage pinball and they were unboxing their Rush machine and

[05:31] I will say, it looked pretty good.

[05:33] You know, I liked the way it looked.

[05:34] These guys were like unboxing and setting up a machine using just one leg to support

[05:39] the machine.

[05:40] God bless them.

[05:42] It takes a lot of strength to do it that way.

[05:44] Canada's too weak.

[05:45] I don't do enough leg day to be able to set up a pinball machine by resting it on my thigh.

[05:50] But here's the thing I want to say about Stern pinball.

[05:53] Stern pinball is pinball.

[05:55] There is nobody else on this planet that actually, efficiently, effectively does what Stern does.

[06:04] Every three to four months, this company puts some of the best themes on planet Earth into

[06:11] pinball form, into your home, into your bar, into your basement, into your garage and into

[06:19] your dreams.

[06:21] They know how to do this every three to four months.

[06:24] We might not love every single thing they do.

[06:27] I might not agree with the pricing of these games, knowing what goes into them.

[06:32] But when you simply think about the fact that this company, even through a pandemic, even

[06:37] through all the issues that everyone else is suffering with, they've continued to release

[06:43] new games.

[06:44] I know there's a backlog.

[06:46] They're going to catch up on that backlog, but they've never really slowed down.

[06:51] And every time I see a Stern LE announced, revealed and shipped within a two month window,

[06:58] there's no drama, there's no hassle.

[07:02] Nobody's ever lost money.

[07:04] Nobody's been lied to.

[07:06] If Stern has an issue, they fix it better than anybody.

[07:09] They do.

[07:10] I've had issues with Stern games and they've fixed everyone.

[07:14] Their customer service is the best.

[07:17] They have the best themes in pinball.

[07:19] They have the best efficiencies as a factory.

[07:22] And they by far have the best leadership team in all of pinball.

[07:27] George Gomez and the leaders over at Stern and the talent over at Stern is incredible.

[07:34] I am always in awe when I see a tour of the Stern factory.

[07:39] I know I make fun of them.

[07:40] I'm sitting in my little public relations office every day trying to cook up ideas that

[07:45] go into PowerPoint.

[07:46] They're making complex mechanical electrical machines that if not done right could burn

[07:54] down your house.

[07:55] I make PowerPoint slides.

[07:57] I am in awe of what they do.

[08:00] I'm in awe of all those women who work on the line, who have been a member of the Stern

[08:05] family, who come in every day and make pinball machines.

[08:10] And look at the volume at which Stern makes their machines.

[08:13] We don't see that many issues.

[08:15] These women and these men over at Stern, they know how to put together a pinball machine

[08:20] better than anybody.

[08:22] And I mean that because they're not just making 250 fathoms guys.

[08:27] They're making 10,000 games a year.

[08:29] Try to go make 10,000 games spooky or CGC or anyone else out there and tell me how your

[08:36] quality is.

[08:37] So the fact that they're able to do this volume at the quality level they have is absolutely

[08:43] phenomenal.

[08:44] Now am I going to buy a Rush?

[08:46] No.

[08:47] Am I going to buy a Venom?

[08:48] Probably get one and see how the market treats that game.

[08:51] But I'm happy that in a few months I and you and everybody else will have a chance to say

[08:56] do I want the next Stern machine?

[08:58] And they do it every three to four months.

[09:01] I want the next Jersey Jack machine.

[09:03] I'm waiting 18 months and there's still no, there absolutely is still no line of sight

[09:09] on when we're going to see that game.

[09:10] I would love to have more CGC games.

[09:13] I would love to have something new from Dutch pinball.

[09:15] I would love to have more games from American pinball.

[09:18] Remember when David Fix went on to podcast.

[09:20] You guys remember this?

[09:22] He went on to the super awesome pinball show and he said it was like January of last year.

[09:28] He said we are going to get two games out this year.

[09:31] Did they?

[09:32] No.

[09:33] Are they going to get two games out this year?

[09:34] Probably not.

[09:35] You know, everyone just talks and talks and talks.

[09:39] But Stern pinball, they get it done.

[09:41] So congratulations to everyone at Stern.

[09:44] This is probably the nicest love letter you're ever going to get from Canada.

[09:48] Now speaking of love letters, I want to welcome Barry over at Dutch pinball to the Canada

[09:55] Club.

[09:56] He was club member number 394.

[10:00] We are now at 395.

[10:02] Now I think it was him.

[10:04] It says Barry at Dutch pinball and it's his full name.

[10:07] So Barry, thank you so much for joining.

[10:09] Thank you for the generous contribution.

[10:11] I'm glad to have you here, brother.

[10:13] And I've said it before, man.

[10:14] I hope you guys can figure your stuff out so you can make another game because I think

[10:19] you're one of the most talented pinball designers of the modern era and I would just love to

[10:24] see more from you.

[10:26] Big Lebowski still to this day kind of puts everything else to shame when it comes to

[10:32] world under glass.

[10:34] All right.

[10:35] All right.

[10:36] Let's talk about spooky and then I want to end with P3.

[10:37] I'm going to give Jerry the finale.

[10:38] Right?

[10:39] So we have the encore of this podcast.

[10:41] So spooky pinball.

[10:42] Well, first things first, they fixed on some of the newer games moving forward.

[10:46] The hedge multi-baw issue.

[10:49] They have fixed it.

[10:50] The insert now covers the whole word.

[10:53] So when it lights up, it doesn't say hedge multi-baw.

[10:55] It's not a sheep game.

[10:57] It says hedge multi-baw, which is great.

[11:00] But here's the weird part.

[11:02] They didn't fix the other insert that was a big issue, which was the triangle nose on

[11:08] the jack-o-lantern should be a triangle.

[11:11] But the insert is a hexagon, which comes from Ultraman.

[11:15] And I just look at these moves and I'm like, huh, why did you not go over it and just fix

[11:24] both of the inserts that everybody has been calling out?

[11:27] Again, another weird move by spooky.

[11:30] I don't know what's happening.

[11:32] I'm at the point now where I am just trying to give this company advice so they can get

[11:38] in and mature and become the company they need to become at this volume and at this

[11:45] price point.

[11:46] And that leads me to my next boneheaded move over at spooky.

[11:51] And I want to explain why it's a boneheaded move.

[11:54] You are releasing a game called a collector's edition.

[11:58] You're also releasing Ultraman as a limited edition game.

[12:03] It is limited to only 500 units.

[12:06] Now let me ask you guys out there a question.

[12:08] Have you ever seen a Stern LE?

[12:10] A limited edition that does not tell you what number the game is.

[12:15] It tells you what number your game is out of the total number of games that are being

[12:20] made.

[12:21] And something that every pinball collector loves to know and see when they play their

[12:26] game is what number they have.

[12:29] I have Godzilla LE number 500 out of a thousand.

[12:34] A lot of collectors like to get the same numbers in their lineup to sort of have a

[12:38] row of games that are all number 23 or 7 or 69 right for those weird dudes who somehow

[12:45] still think that's funny.

[12:47] So spooky pinball decided on the limited edition of Ultraman because they had a chance

[12:53] to have the actor who I guess played Ultraman sign the plaques that they would have his

[12:59] signature be there instead of the game number.

[13:03] So every single Ultraman has his little scribble and it is like a little scribble and it does

[13:09] not tell you what game number you are.

[13:11] Why?

[13:12] Why Chuck?

[13:13] Why Bug?

[13:14] Why Luke?

[13:15] Why couldn't you figure out a solve?

[13:17] How did nobody sit in a room and say look I get that you guys are huge Ultraman fans

[13:22] and your geeks and the chance to have him sign those plaques was a dream come true to you.

[13:28] But what you fail to do from a marketing standpoint is understand what your customers

[13:33] want.

[13:34] They don't want the signature in place of the number.

[13:37] The number of their game means a lot.

[13:39] It's been how we do things right?

[13:41] It's just how we do things in the collectible world.

[13:45] When you remove the number from what your item is you've removed basically a lot of

[13:50] its collectibility and I mean this when I say this I don't care if there's some like

[13:55] build number like VIN number on the back of the game.

[13:59] People want an official plaque from the company on the front of that game so every time they

[14:04] play they can see it.

[14:06] So when they sell the game they can point at it and say I've got game number 73 out of

[14:11] 500.

[14:12] And look at where I'm at right?

[14:14] I was like man nobody's getting like the short end of the stick more than Canada because

[14:19] I want it game number 500 because I want it Ultraman number 500 and you would see it

[14:25] game number 500 out of 500 that's super cool would be right next to my guns and roses number

[14:32] 500 out of 500.

[14:34] That's exactly why I asked for that game number.

[14:37] Now that's not there.

[14:38] And you're telling me that they couldn't figure out a solve for this?

[14:42] I get he signs the plaques.

[14:44] So either take a sharp because if you look at the plaque there is plenty of room on

[14:48] each plaque for them to take a sharpie and just write the game number out of what on

[14:55] that plaque.

[14:56] They could have easily wrote on every one one of 500 two of 500 as games were going down

[15:03] the line.

[15:04] They could easily have done that and they didn't or here's another solution Chuck just make

[15:08] another plaque to go underneath that that just has the game number that's all you had

[15:12] to do how much would that have cost and that's the thing it's like if I was sitting in a

[15:17] room with them and saying guys like we got to do stuff the right way we're now in the

[15:22] big leagues our prices are reflecting that collectors want to know what number their

[15:26] game is we can't remove the number from a collector's edition game.

[15:30] It was almost as boneheaded when Jersey Jack did that on the yellow brick road edition

[15:34] right Jack wouldn't tell us how many he was going to make but he said they were limited

[15:39] it's only limited if you set the limit Jack that was a boneheaded move and this is a boneheaded

[15:45] move.

[15:46] The place for spooky pinball is this guys you got to slow down you got to slow down I know

[15:50] you're excited I know you're making more money than you've ever made before but you're making

[15:55] really silly mistakes and the details matter especially at these price points and it doesn't

[16:01] matter how transparent you are I don't want you to be on pin site all day long having

[16:07] to respond to all these things I want you to just make great games and figure this stuff

[16:12] out before you ship the games.

[16:14] Stern's not on pin site guys they just get the details done better I think spooky really

[16:20] needs to have a meeting that is titled getting the details down right we've got the manufacturing

[16:26] down we're in a position to get some good themes but we've got to nail the details logistics

[16:32] matter and I think they need to do that.

[16:34] Alright let's go and end this episode of Canadian pinball podcast with Jerry P3 Multimorphic

[16:41] probably the biggest leap forward in the history of pinball and did it work out for

[16:47] Jerry has the P3 Multimorphic been a resounding success have all of you been itching to buy

[16:53] one of these platforms the answer we know is no they haven't sold many this is a platform

[16:59] that Jerry believes in he's passionate about it I love his passion about it Jerry's a really

[17:06] nice guy I've hung out with Jerry personally I've interviewed him over the years and I've

[17:11] given him just as much feedback as a marketer in me it kills me watching this guy make these

[17:17] decisions because in marketing in anything in life when you want to sell a product you

[17:23] need to give the customer what he or she wants Jerry's always been trying to make a pinball

[17:30] machine that he thinks they don't know they need but they will want it when they see it

[17:35] and even though we've been seeing it for like eight nine years now the orders are not flying

[17:42] in they have sold nowhere near as many P3's as total nuclear annihilation so you could

[17:48] even argue it's not even about the theme it's just the platform but here's where it starts

[17:53] to get a little exciting for Jerry he's got Mr. TNA Scott Denise over there working on

[17:59] the music of this licensed game and we know Scott he's not just a music guy he's gonna

[18:05] work on other stuff lights and choreography it's what Scott Denise is great at I would

[18:10] argue that Scott Denise's role in pinball is to be more of a sound lights choreography

[18:16] kind of guy he knows how to do that tremendously well Scott Bowen Karen's over there working

[18:21] on this game I'm really curious how bad spooky pissed these people off to drive them over

[18:26] to P3 multi-morphic but they're over there and now he's got an image online that looks

[18:31] like an a hand like an illustration of a hand sculpting the David and we've got the Venus

[18:37] statue behind it and it says like we're putting the final touches on our new game and then

[18:43] it says dream theme now when I saw that dream theme it stopped me in my tracks I was walking

[18:49] through my apartment with my Gucci pajamas on and I stopped and I said dream theme are

[18:55] you really gonna say that like dream theme I mean you can't use those two words lightly

[19:00] you can't you just cannot start throwing around dream theme unless it really is a dream theme

[19:07] like it just can't be like Jerry's gonna be like tic-tac-toe was always a dream theme

[19:11] of mine and here you go or Candy Crush was always a dream I love that cell phone game

[19:17] no it can't be like that and Jerry knows that his audience is the pinball community look

[19:23] it is subjective like what's a dream theme and who considers what to be a dream theme

[19:28] some people consider jaws a dream theme some people hate it some people consider matrix

[19:32] a dream theme some people hate it but Jerry knows his license game needs to be a stellar

[19:39] theme dare I say a Stelenberg theme uh-oh Jerry I just did it so what do we think it

[19:45] is based on this image well first do we think this image is a clue to what the game is so

[19:53] it's got like Greco-Roman sculptures happening is it something to do with the coliseum is

[19:59] it gladiator I mean could it be gladiator I mean I would love it if we got gladiator

[20:05] movie as a pinball machine I think that's a super cool theme I just don't know right

[20:12] I always get nervous because I always think well then how are you going to make that big

[20:17] screen play field work like how are you gonna do that if it's a movie so we'll see so we'll

[20:22] see what it was a gladiator from there I'm like I don't know man I'm trying to think

[20:27] is it future Rama was one of the things people were sort of speculating because Jerry loves

[20:32] future Rama now I would say future Rama is not a dream theme for most but yes for future

[20:38] Rama fans it is a dream theme it better not be something like TNA to and he considers

[20:43] TNA to be a license and he licensed it and took it away from spooky I mean it's just

[20:48] better not be something like that I don't think it would be that I think he's used some

[20:52] powerful hyperbole to get people excited about this game but here's the thing we know this

[20:57] you know this I'm gonna be completely honest right now there are not that many people excited

[21:01] the thread is not blowing up like the next stern pin or the next pin from JJP the next

[21:08] game from P3 multi-morphic there isn't much interest Jerry has to create the interest that

[21:16] has me excited because he must know deep down inside this theme needs to be amazing to do

[21:21] that like he doesn't have a loyal like huge fan base he doesn't have this community paying

[21:27] attention to what they're doing this is gonna be the moment and I mean it this is the make

[21:32] or break moment for this platform if this dream theme comes out and it is a flop or people

[21:37] don't gravitate towards it or people don't order it there's nowhere left for him to go

[21:43] people are not gonna just have this thing sitting around for 20 years why every other

[21:49] pinball manufacturer makes tens of thousands of games and makes millions of dollars it's

[21:54] like Jerry at some point you've got to call an audible because even if you call an audible

[22:00] and just go make normal pinball for once who are you really pissing off like there's only

[22:05] been a maybe a couple hundred people who bought the original platform you know the video game

[22:10] company has a console that's not successful they go on and make the next one so I think

[22:15] Jerry needs to sort of realize that like this is it now I'm rooting for him I'm always rooting

[22:20] for the underdog and I'm also rooting for him for one simple reason I just want more games

[22:25] coming out I think last year was a real lackluster year in pinball and I want to see p3 multi

[22:32] morphic put out a theme that excites us I want to see American pinball do something that

[22:37] excites us I mean I'm more worried about American pinball than everybody else in pinball I mean

[22:42] I think American pinball is not going to be successful with these original IPs I don't

[22:47] think it's a winning strategy I think they caught lightning in a bottle when they released

[22:52] legends of a Hala but I think a lot of those guys who went in at eighty seven hundred dollars

[22:57] are going to start to see those games trade for like two thousand off I mean we're seeing

[23:00] it already with Ultraman in Halloween there's no way Ultraman and Halloween are ever going

[23:05] to hold their value and people are starting to get rid of their spots the real scary tipping

[23:09] point has happened already if you gave spooky two thousand dollars and you got a butter cabinet

[23:15] Ultraman that's what I did so you owe them basically a little over ten thousand dollars

[23:21] now there is a guy right now trying to sell his Ultraman with a butter cabinet new inbox

[23:29] the game is in his house new inbox not opened butter cabinet he paid over ten thousand dollars

[23:36] for it he will take eighty two hundred dollars for the game and it's still not sold the moment

[23:42] you lose more than your deposit this is a scary moment for spooky the moment you know

[23:47] you're going to lose more than your deposit you might as well not get the game because

[23:53] it's actually cheaper for you to just go buy someone else's used than it is for you to

[23:58] go hand spooky a check for an additional eight thousand dollars they are very very close to

[24:03] that tipping point line and it's not good I've never seen this happen to anything from

[24:09] JJ P from CGC I've never seen this happen in American pinball this has never happened

[24:14] before that a game is basically losing two thousand dollars in value before the majority

[24:20] of people even get the game never seen it happen and it's nonrefundable and that's why

[24:25] this is interesting to talk about because I've just never seen this before everybody this

[24:29] has been canada's pinball podcast episode are you waiting for it six hundred and fifty

[24:35] I've done six hundred and fifty podcasts about pinball I turned some of my old shows on on

[24:41] the sound cloud page and the reason I did it is one of my clients wanted to hear my show

[24:46] and I realize oh man like there's nothing for free like there's nothing you can go here

[24:50] so I turned on some oldies but goodies but this is where it's going to be from now on

[24:56] I'm not turning on the sound cloud page again so if you're a member don't worry if you see

[25:02] some of those pop up it's not some teaser to my return and I am so happy that we are

[25:08] almost at four hundred club members I mean I remember the days when my club members were

[25:14] like twenty three I had maybe like thirty I was making like twenty seven dollars a month

[25:20] on patreon for like a year doing this and I am so ecstatic to have each and every one

[25:25] of you here talking about you Ed Robertson talking about you Barry it's great this is

[25:31] such a fun place to talk about pinball and have weekly content about the things we love

[25:37] and I'm happy to give all these years of my life making that content for you and for the

[25:41] haters who don't get it I don't know what to tell them I don't know what to tell them

[25:45] I think I've been fair to every single pinball company I think I call it like I see it sometimes

[25:50] I change my mind I didn't see this price inflation coming this fast but it is what it is there

[25:56] was a recent pinside poll how expensive is your pinball collection the majority of people

[26:01] said they have over one hundred thousand dollars in pinball machines and that's what I've been

[26:06] saying for years there's so many rich people in this hobby these companies don't realize

[26:12] that and now they do but you know the thing about rich people that people sometimes don't

[26:16] understand they got rich because they understand hard work they got rich because they make

[26:22] sure they get the details right if you're a carpenter and you don't get the details right

[26:27] you're not going to become a rich carpenter and even though these men have money you can't get

[26:33] away with sloppy mistakes in pinball and that is why I love this hobby it pulls everyone in

[26:39] from different backgrounds we're all from diverse places we all have different incomes we're not

[26:44] all rich but we all expect the same thing you know the rich man who buys a spooky machine and

[26:50] looks down and sees hedge multi-baw it affects him the same way as the poor guy who saved up all

[26:56] year and loves Halloween more than anything and he got in early on the list and he opens up his game

[27:02] and he sees that and it distracts him and that is what my show has always been about is I just want

[27:08] to bring these issues to the surface so that everybody gets the best product possible and I

[27:14] do want to say how much I love pinball more often and I do want to gush over these companies more

[27:19] often and I will when they hire good animators when they don't have silly mistakes I'm gonna be on

[27:25] top of them and when they release great games I'm gonna applaud those games to no end I mean I

[27:31] wish more than anything we never had to talk about play field issues with guns and roses and we

[27:36] were talking about strategy and how to use the patches and how cool each song is and how all the

[27:42] light shows are amazing and the mechs are amazing and we know we're not talking about any of it

[27:46] because we all got sidetracked by the quality but that's more important these things need to be of

[27:52] good quality and good reliability for the money and I'm always gonna be on your side and I'm always

[27:58] gonna hold these companies accountable when we know most won't and so Damien get people their fathoms

[28:05] or at least get them an update by the end of this month because they paid you money and you owe

[28:10] them that you now work for them have a great day everybody
