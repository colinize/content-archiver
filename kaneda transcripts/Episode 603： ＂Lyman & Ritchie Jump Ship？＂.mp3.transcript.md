[00:00] Alright, well I'm here to confirm for you not one, but two bombshells happening in the

[00:05] pinball world, two luminaries, two of the biggest figures in all of pinball have done

[00:11] the following.

[00:31] Alright, welcome to episode 603 of Canatus Pinball Podcast. Your favorite pinball podcast

[00:36] get your Twippy Votes ready people. So I have confirmation that Lyman Sheets is no longer

[00:41] at Stern Pinball, not only that he has not been at Stern Pinball for the last eight to

[00:46] nine months people. And this has been a dirty little secret in the pinball world that other

[00:51] people knew about and nobody shared with you. So I'm here to tell you he is no longer

[00:57] at Stern Pinball. Now here's where it gets interesting and the pieces of the puzzle line

[01:02] up so nicely. So ask yourself which game is about to come out? Which game really needs

[01:09] a code update? Which game have you been waiting a really long time on? Which code or takes

[01:16] a really long time before he's finished and polished a game? So if you're wondering

[01:22] why cactus canyon remake has taken so damn long and you're waiting to see if cactus

[01:30] canyon is going to be a game you're going to want because you know it's got all the toys.

[01:35] You know it's going to have the most impressive top or you know the game is going to be loaded.

[01:40] But what if cactus canyon remake has a guy named Lyman Sheets doing the code update on

[01:46] it? Oh and that would have been a beautiful what if right? Everybody would love Lyman

[01:51] Sheets to do cactus canyon remake code update. So here's the thing I did this podcast.

[01:57] I put it up and I got hit up by my friend over at Chicago Gaming Company Ryan White and

[02:03] he said this is not accurate. I wish I had Lyman Sheets on board but can you please retract

[02:10] that statement? And so I'm here to do an updated show and to tell you that I'm hearing from

[02:17] CGC that Lyman Sheets is not on board. But here's the big but and I did this great 10 minute

[02:25] explanation about why I think Lyman Sheets is the greatest coder in the history of Bimbaugh

[02:31] and I think him joining CGC would be an incredible move for both parties involved but here is the but.

[02:39] I am hearing that Lyman has been out at Stern for eight to nine months now if he is not at CGC

[02:47] where do you think Lyman Sheets is at today? Here is my complete speculative guess. So here's my

[02:54] guess because I know for a while that planetary pinball is planning to do code updates on some of

[03:02] the classic machines that planetary pinball owns the rights to. And if you're wondering which

[03:08] machines does planetary pinball own the rights to pretty much all of the Valley Williams classics

[03:14] that you love. When Chicago Gaming Company makes a game I believe they license the rights to make

[03:20] those games from Rick over at planetary pinball. So here is my guess. My guess is that Lyman Sheets

[03:29] is joining planetary pinball to help them with code updates on all of those classic Valley Williams

[03:37] games. And if there is one coder in all of pinball that has the permission and the right and the

[03:44] credibility to touch the old classics it's Lyman Sheets. He is the only one that you would feel good

[03:52] about meddling with all of the masterpieces from the mid 90s. So that is my guess that Lyman Sheets

[03:59] has been over at planetary pinball and he will be lending his coding efforts to Rick and PPS as they

[04:06] plan to launch updated code versions of the classic games that you know and love. And here's the

[04:13] other very interesting part. They are going to update the code on these games and they are going

[04:19] to sell the updated code as an upgraded kit for these machines. And so if you start to think about

[04:25] it how cool would it be if you could upgrade the display put a new code in the game maybe there's

[04:31] some new GI lighting and whatnot a new topper but all of a sudden instead of having to remake the

[04:38] entire game what if they found a way to just contemporize some of the games that you love.

[04:45] So if you currently have a circus Voltaire or a theater of magic or a toad in you can now buy

[04:52] a new coded version of that game to install into your current machine. And I don't think there's

[04:58] a toad in owner out there or a theater of magic owner that wouldn't love to add additional

[05:05] elements to bring those games up to the modern standard where you stew of games that are very deep

[05:11] because if you own a machine you want that machine to have some depth to it and there's nobody

[05:16] better at making a game deep but not too complex right. Keith is a little too complex over a JJP

[05:23] right you need a Bible and a whole handbook to figure out how to play his games but Lyman is

[05:29] perfect he'd be the perfect guy to go after those old games and add more depth to them because

[05:35] back in the day nobody played machines 5,000 times right nobody own them in their houses and for

[05:41] homeowners who want to play these games hundreds if not thousands of times Lyman sheets would be the

[05:47] perfect person to make those games deeper so you would never want to get rid of them give you

[05:52] stuff to strive for right if you own those machines so do you think Lyman sheets is over at PPS so

[05:58] that is the thing that I am speculating as to be where he's gone if he's left stern pinball 8 to 9

[06:04] months ago the other thing I'm hearing is that some of these titles some of the licensing rights to

[06:09] some of these games has been acquired by no other than Nick Parks so Nick Parks the CEO of the

[06:16] pinball company who I interviewed on this show a few years ago and he gave us the bombshell news

[06:21] it was Nick that told everybody what the bomb is on a stern machine he's the one who let the cat

[06:27] out of the bag that it costs stern about $3,000 to make a game and he told this that because he went

[06:34] to stern about the potential of making a machine and that's what they told them it costs to make a

[06:38] game now I heard that Nick Parks also has acquired some of the licenses to these bali Williams classic

[06:45] titles I think he might have toad in I think he might have another one of John pop of Duke's games

[06:51] and I think he might have stuff like whitewater I'm not sure exactly what games he has but Nick

[06:57] Parks over at the pinball company also has acquired the right some hearing to some of these bali

[07:02] Williams classics and so maybe he's also working with Lyman sheets to get some of these updated

[07:09] and get these kits out to people in the world it makes total sense it's long overdue you don't have

[07:16] to remake the entire game to bring the game up to the modern standards were used to in the pinball

[07:23] world you know because the marketplace is shifted and collectors want games that they want to hold

[07:28] on to forever and let's face it they did not code these games back in the mid 90s to be inside

[07:34] people's homes they just didn't and a lot of these games could have some more in them that would

[07:39] create even more magical pinball moments and again I think only Lyman sheets could take these great

[07:45] classics and make them even better masterpieces right if I were to say to you who would you let

[07:52] add additional code to medieval madness or attack from Mars or toad in or circus Voltaire or Indiana

[07:59] who's the guy that you would let touch those classics now some of you out there might say don't

[08:05] touch them at all but if there's one person who knows how to do it and do it right and has never

[08:11] failed at making a game incredible it's Lyman sheets so we'll see if any of this comes true now I'm

[08:18] going to air for you what I recorded earlier today which is the other major rumor that is happening

[08:24] in the pinball world which I'm also hearing is confirmed and we're going to hear about it on Monday

[08:28] so we'll find out in a couple days so let me now air the second major bombshell happening in

[08:34] pinball all right so what's the other big bombshell happening in the world can a to in Ireland you're

[08:41] waking up to this people because it's 9 a.m. here which means it's 4 a.m. in New York City and you're

[08:47] not ready for can a to be five hours ahead of the news okay so here we go the other major bombshell

[08:53] happening in pinball and this is the crazy part because I got the last name sent to me and then I

[08:59] got the company he's starting out on Monday but I'm going to assume it is no other than the man I've

[09:07] been ragging on for not putting a lot into his games a man I've ragged on for ruining Star Wars and

[09:15] Game of Thrones and Led Zeppelin a man who can't seem to get enough money to put enough magic into

[09:23] his games the last time they gave this man some real money to work with he knocked it out of the

[09:29] park with a game you know as AC DC if you don't know the story behind AC DC it happened after Jack

[09:36] Winari showed Wizard of Oz and Steve Richie went back to Stern and said let me show what I can do

[09:43] and they let him show the world what he could do and he came back with AC DC and that's why Gary

[09:50] loosened the purse strings for just one game for him and look what happened and so I'm hearing

[09:56] that no other than Mr. Steve Richie is also jumping from Stern pinball now again I got Richie sent

[10:04] to me it didn't say Steve or Mark but I have to assume that this is Steve Richie who is leaving

[10:11] Stern pinball the king the king wants to get his throne back the king wants to show the world he's

[10:19] got one more maybe more than one but one more big thing in him and so I am hearing that Steve Richie

[10:27] I'm sorry I got I got to clarify this I'm hearing that one of the Richies is leaving and heading over

[10:33] and it will be announced on Monday that a Richie probably Steve will be starting over at Jersey

[10:43] Jack pinball let's think about this what how is anyone going over to Jersey Jack pinball right now

[10:51] like what's the schedule like right they've got toy story next they've got to build all these

[10:56] guns and roses but if there is a place you want to go to get a high bomb to be able to put as much

[11:03] as you want into your machine no one would argue that the home for you would be Jersey Jack pinball

[11:10] so I expect to hear on Monday that a Richie probably Steve will start working at Jersey Jack pinball

[11:19] on Monday now the sad news is is when Jersey Jack announces this all of the commentary is going to be

[11:26] well are you going to fix the play fields are you going to fix the play like nothing they say now

[11:30] nothing they say now is going to avoid that topic they need to get in front of that topic because

[11:35] I don't care if Steve Richie's making games over there or Pat Lawler or Eric Minier no one cares

[11:41] anymore Jersey Jack we want to know when are you going to fix the quality do you think hiring

[11:45] Steve Richie or Mark Richie is going to improve the play field quality no that's not the major

[11:51] announcement people want to hear over at Jersey Jack pinball so let's talk about this let's

[11:55] talk about this if Steve Richie the king is leaving stern pinball for Jersey Jack pinball what is

[12:02] that mean and will we see anything anytime soon you know when I look at this news and I look at Steve

[12:08] leaving clearly he was probably a little bit upset about the reaction from Led Zeppelin and he's

[12:14] probably heard all the arrows and criticisms about his recent titles so it makes sense to go over

[12:21] and obviously the abyss family has some good coin they've got some money they've got some

[12:27] opportunity to get some new people in there but my thing is this is Jersey Jack pinball problem

[12:33] right now is not a design problem right you've got Eric Minier and you've got Pat Lawler their problem

[12:40] is manufacturing they can't get games out the door they don't have two lines and so it's a really

[12:47] interesting move because if Steve Richie joins Jjp what year do you think we'll finally get

[12:53] anything he works on out the door right it's not going to be this year it's not going to be next year

[12:59] it'll probably be three years from now before anything Steve Richie touches sees the light of day

[13:06] because of manufacturing right if Jersey Jack pinball had two to three lines and they could actually

[13:10] get games out the door and we saw a lot more progress in that area then it would be different but

[13:16] my concern for Jersey Jack pinball is that the other thing is this is Eric Minier's been done with

[13:23] guns and roses for a while then Pat Lawler is working on Toy Story forever in a day and you have

[13:30] to assume that Eric Minier was next in line to get a game out the door not Mr. Steve Richie so

[13:37] then the question becomes is Eric staying put or maybe is Eric thinking about going somewhere else

[13:44] and if Eric is staying put and working on the next game then that means is his game going to have to

[13:50] go after Richie's or before right there's going to be some politics here because you've got some

[13:55] big juggernauts who are basically the old kings and cramudgins of pinball in Pat Lawler and Steve

[14:02] Richie or maybe Mark Richie I'm just putting it out there because I only got the last name

[14:06] but you see what I'm saying I think there's going to be a lot of politics because three major

[14:11] designers over at Jersey Jack pinball there's no way to skin it it's way too many cooks in the

[14:17] kitchen see what I think would happen was this I think he was just fed up being at Stern and he

[14:22] just wants to go somewhere else and he's going somewhere else but I just think there's going to be

[14:26] such a backlog in games to be made and I think Jersey Jack pinball just doesn't have efficiencies

[14:32] so dropping a new designer into the Jersey Jack system is not a solution because I look at this like

[14:39] both Pat Lawler and Steve Richie should probably retire that's my point of view on both of them

[14:45] I think they both should probably retire and I think if there was anyone Jersey Jack pinball should

[14:50] go grab from Stern pinball it's Keith L. Wing now if you had Eric and L. Wing in the same company

[14:56] then we're talking one two knockout punches every single time Jersey Jack pinball should have two

[15:03] lines those two guys in house and they would be crushing it but they're never going to get

[15:09] there they're never going to get there and that's my thing is like it seems like a huge move when

[15:13] you think about it right but then you got to realize that a designer is at the mercy of the

[15:19] manufacturing wing of the company I mean look at deep root pinball look no further than deep

[15:24] root right all they did was design stuff for years they had no manufacturing lined up so it

[15:29] doesn't matter how many games Jersey Jack pinball can design the question is how many games can they

[15:35] make how many lines can they put out there in the world every year and they've shown us in the entire

[15:42] history of the company they have been enabled to be efficient with manufacturing and they've also

[15:48] struggled they've absolutely struggled to get the quality to where it needs to be again this news

[15:54] is going to hit Jersey Jack's going to be mad that can a dispoiled the news and Jersey Jack's going

[15:59] to be upset that can a dis putting this in the context of where their real problems lie hiring a

[16:06] new designer is not a solution Jersey Jack needs Jersey Jack needs production to ramp up and they

[16:12] need their quality to ramp up and they need their customer service to be improved upon and they're

[16:17] going to learn a lesson when they reveal this news right they're going to learn a lesson in marketing

[16:22] and communications which is what I do for a living if you don't put out the fire that is happening

[16:28] nobody cares about your other big news major billion dollar companies deal with this all the time

[16:35] you have to solve the real problem of today before you announce your solutions for tomorrow Jersey Jack

[16:44] yet don't get it yet you're still not talking about quality issues you're still not talking about

[16:50] the playfields unless mr. richie has figured out a miracle clear code system that will never chip

[16:56] pull or crack then this news while exciting is not going to make everybody be like Jersey Jack

[17:03] pinball has turned a corner because again it's like they're looking back they're looking back but

[17:07] look Steve richie is a great designer don't get me wrong and I think the king has been hamstrung

[17:14] over at stern for a very long time they've been handing him their best IP but they've handed him the

[17:20] best IP with a very low bomb the more expensive the IP the less money he got to put into the games

[17:28] and it showed and the feedback on his games has been pretty brutal it's been pretty critical he

[17:34] hasn't had the sales success that people thought right he hasn't had the love and adoration for

[17:40] his titles and it hurts it hurts when you design star wars or game of thrones right when game of

[17:46] thrones came out remember everyone was like this is the most hideous looking game ever and all of

[17:51] that criticism game after game after game and ultimately the most celebrated thing that's happened

[17:57] on a Steve richie game over the last four games the most celebrated thing has been the black night

[18:04] topper right and that has to be so crushing to a man who wants to make a world under glass

[18:11] that the most celebrated thing is the damn thing that's sitting on top of the cabinet which is the

[18:15] topper and so now he will have his chance to have his high bomb now will jersey jack be able to get

[18:21] him on the line and scheduled with a game anytime soon I don't know right all these guys are designing

[18:26] games and their basements but I hope the next game he designs is from the ground up and it's not a

[18:32] re-skin it's not what they did with Willie Wonka where they turned toy story into Willie Wonka uh

[18:37] oh nobody wants to tell that story nobody wants to share how toy story was supposed to come out with

[18:43] the movie and it wasn't ready so they quickly had to make Wonka to put it on the line nobody wants

[18:50] to tell the truth of how Willie Wonka came about but canada just told you whoops all right so those

[18:55] are the two big bombshells take it run with it go to pin side get your twippy votes ready and this

[19:02] is why it pays to have absolutely zero friends in the pinball industry because I can say stuff like

[19:07] this so ladies and gentlemen canada pinball podcast happy to bring it to you episode 603

[19:13] thank you everybody for your contributions we are up to like 127 people are contributing

[19:19] which is more people than razas sold I love that we are over that amount I love that more people

[19:24] have invested in canada than deep root pinball that is like the greatest accomplishment of my tiny

[19:31] little pinball career have a great day everybody
