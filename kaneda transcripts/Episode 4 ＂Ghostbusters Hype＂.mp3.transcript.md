[00:00] Well, thanks anyway, I gotta go. Thanks a lot, um...

[00:03] Uh...

[00:03] Canada.

[00:04] Yeah, well thanks, Canada.

[00:06] Huh?

[00:07] Wait, do you have to go so soon?

[00:08] Hey, hey, that's not fair!

[00:10] Whoa!

[00:11] Wait a sec!

[00:25] Of course not.

[00:26] And that is the whole problem with aliens.

[00:28] Is you just can't trust him.

[00:30] Occasionally you mean a nice one.

[00:32] Star with ET.

[00:34] But usually they turn out to be some kind of big list!

[00:40] Eat him up.

[00:43] Go!

[00:46] Raaaaaay!

[00:49] Y'all!

[00:52] Back by unpopular demand,

[00:55] the only pinball podcast officially not sponsored by Nifty LEDs.

[01:01] It's Canada's pinball podcast coming at you live from New York City

[01:05] inside the world infamous bedroom arcade.

[01:09] Alright guys, I am super excited tonight.

[01:12] We haven't spoken in a few days.

[01:14] A lot's happened since then.

[01:16] A lot of chatter on the forum.

[01:18] A lot's gone on in my own thread.

[01:20] You guys might have noticed that I'm frozen.

[01:22] We will talk about that.

[01:25] We want to talk about...

[01:28] Sorry, attack from Mars.

[01:30] I want to talk about Ghostbusters pinball.

[01:33] Before we get to that,

[01:35] I want to talk about something that's much more important than any pinball news.

[01:40] It's going to happen in 2016.

[01:42] Something that I feel like I'm going to be spending as much money on this as a new pinball machine

[01:47] when all is said and done.

[01:50] It's been 23 years since these two guys took the stage together.

[01:55] And when they do, on opening night,

[01:58] I just have to be there.

[02:00] And I'm talking about...

[02:02] I got a smile that it seems to me

[02:05] Reminds me of childhood memories

[02:09] Where everything won't surprise us

[02:12] And bright blue sky.

[02:15] Guns and fucking roses are back and reuniting.

[02:19] To say this ban is my favorite ban

[02:23] is the biggest understatement ever.

[02:26] They have been the biggest musical influence in my life

[02:31] since the late 80s, early 90s

[02:34] And really have even defined my professional career.

[02:38] My biggest work campaign that I ever did in the marketing world

[02:42] revolved around guns and roses

[02:44] Just to give you guys who may not know

[02:48] One of my clients was Dr. Pepper.

[02:51] And in 2008,

[02:53] We did a campaign that got Axel Rose

[02:56] to finally release Chinese democracy.

[02:59] And the album he had been working on for 17 years

[03:02] And what we did was very gorilla.

[03:05] I mean this was without any legal approval

[03:08] I convinced Dr. Pepper to go out

[03:11] and offer everybody in America except for two people

[03:14] A free Dr. Pepper if Axel Rose

[03:17] would release Chinese democracy any time in 2008.

[03:20] And the two people we excluded from that offer

[03:23] were guitarist slash and buckethead.

[03:26] And I remember the days still.

[03:28] Like it was yesterday, I get a call from Axel Rose's lawyer

[03:32] saying she's seeing all this news about the offer

[03:35] and she wants to talk to someone.

[03:37] Now when we talk about it

[03:39] and we talk about this a lot on pinball, IP infringement

[03:41] and things you can and cannot do

[03:43] what we did was absolutely something that

[03:46] you cannot do.

[03:48] That any lawyer will tell you that you're not allowed to

[03:51] use an IP or someone's likeness or name

[03:55] or associate them with a brand without their legal permission.

[03:58] But we did it.

[04:00] And I get a call from Axel's lawyer

[04:03] and she says I'm going to take this to Axel.

[04:06] And I just said shit, I'm going to get fired today.

[04:09] This is exactly why brands never do something like this.

[04:13] And two hours later my friend calls me

[04:16] because I just went for a walk.

[04:18] I'm like this is going to be the last day of my job.

[04:20] He's like you got to go on Guns and Rosas.com right now.

[04:23] And I do.

[04:25] And it says Axel responds to Dr. Pepper

[04:27] and says we want to thank you for the support.

[04:29] We weren't aware of this promotion

[04:31] because his parts are on the album.

[04:33] I'm going to show my Dr. Pepper with Buckethead.

[04:36] And about eight months later,

[04:38] the album finally comes out on November 23rd, 2008.

[04:43] But for Guns and Rosas fans

[04:46] and for the millions out there,

[04:48] the Chinese democracy iteration of Guns and Rosas

[04:51] was never really the band that they grew up in love.

[04:55] It didn't feel real to most people.

[04:57] And I understand why.

[04:59] It was so hard going to concerts and people were wearing shirts saying

[05:04] we're a slash and you had to accept all these new guys.

[05:08] And not only that, like there was no new music either.

[05:11] The Axel Rose came out with the new band in 2002

[05:16] and never released Chinese democracy until 2008.

[05:20] But here we are.

[05:22] It's 2016 and Guns and Rosas

[05:25] have announced that they're going to play Coachella.

[05:28] But what's more exciting because you couldn't pay me all the money

[05:31] in the world that go to Coachella.

[05:33] They're going to play in Las Vegas

[05:35] at the new team mobile arena, April 8th and 9th.

[05:39] And I will be there.

[05:41] I need to find tickets.

[05:43] I still haven't bought them yet.

[05:45] They just went on sale for the pre-sale.

[05:47] They go on sale Saturday for you guys who are fans.

[05:50] And they're going to be expensive.

[05:52] That's all I know.

[05:54] Just so you guys put some things in perspective,

[05:56] these bands have wise-duped.

[05:57] I think the ultimate VIP package that they sell

[06:01] for one ticket to this concert is over $2,000.

[06:06] So that means for four people to go VIP to see Guns and Rosas

[06:10] is as much as a Hobbit pinball machine.

[06:12] All of a sudden our Hobbit doesn't seem so expensive.

[06:17] One quote that I always love to think about

[06:19] and then we'll get right into the pinball stuff guys.

[06:22] Is this quote I think summarizes what it was like

[06:25] being a Guns and Rosas fan who loves slash and axle

[06:29] and would go see the Chinese democracy version of the ban.

[06:33] And you had to deal with stuff like this.

[06:35] This is from Leeds in the UK.

[06:38] This is Doring Axe-Rose singing patience.

[06:42] And a fan is in the audience wearing a shirt that says,

[06:45] wears slash and this is how axle responds to him.

[06:50] He's in my ass, that's where slash is.

[06:53] Fuckhead, go home.

[06:59] I always wonder if that fan actually went home after

[07:02] axle told him to.

[07:03] So they're back together.

[07:06] I think you guys who are fans of Guns and Rosas

[07:09] who have sort of skipped out or didn't really catch them

[07:11] during the Chinese democracy era will

[07:14] really want to catch them because this is it.

[07:16] This is the sort of farewell run of this ban.

[07:19] And it's going to be epic.

[07:20] It's going to be awesome.

[07:21] The crowds are going to go bonkers.

[07:23] So let's switch gears to pinball tonight.

[07:25] There's been a lot of activity on the forum as there always is.

[07:28] But there's a few topics we want to cover tonight.

[07:32] And as I've said before, the point of this podcast is

[07:35] we're going to pick a few topics that are sort of

[07:37] blowing up on the forum.

[07:38] And my goal is to talk about this a couple times a week

[07:43] and also to get guests on the show.

[07:45] And that's going to happen soon.

[07:47] Just give me some time figuring some of those logistics out.

[07:49] This is only episode number four or three and a half.

[07:52] So the two things that I want to discuss tonight are

[07:55] Ghostbusters, which this thread just continues to

[07:59] just keep on going without any real information.

[08:04] And I also want to talk about another thread

[08:07] where people are discussing

[08:10] attack from Mars remake.

[08:12] And what that pin could possibly be priced at.

[08:17] And let's discuss that.

[08:19] And then I want to close the show with just a follow-up

[08:25] or sort of the close the loop on some of the alien pinball

[08:29] discussion we've been having.

[08:31] There was some comments said regarding my podcast and my

[08:36] coverage on that pin that I wanted to talk about with you guys.

[08:39] And sort of set the record a little bit straight on where I was coming from.

[08:43] And read you guys what some of the feedback have been.

[08:46] So without further ado, let's talk about Ghostbusters.

[08:50] So this thread right now is 46 pages long.

[08:57] 46 pages long speculating on Ghostbusters.

[09:02] That's insane.

[09:05] And I think that shows how completely obsessed with this theme people are.

[09:10] And that without even showing anything,

[09:14] Stern must realize they just have a humongous hit on their hands with this pin.

[09:21] It just goes to show that theme is almost everything.

[09:27] I know oftentimes people are saying,

[09:30] so much you do more original themes.

[09:32] And there used to be a lot more original IPs that came out.

[09:35] And where's another theater of magic or circus full tear?

[09:40] Not to bring up two J-pop games, but you know what I'm saying?

[09:44] There's this debate all the time.

[09:47] But the reality is this.

[09:49] The theme matters more than anything.

[09:52] Anything.

[09:53] It is the number one reason we get excited.

[09:56] We want to be transported via the game into some universe

[10:01] where some storyline or narrative that we are familiar with,

[10:05] that we are emotionally attached to.

[10:07] And Ghostbusters just does that for people, right?

[10:10] Those movies are incredible.

[10:12] Another example of just theme just changes everything.

[10:16] Look at Rob Zombie.

[10:20] Rob Zombie is the exact same pin as Pimbal Zombies from Beyond the Grave.

[10:28] Exact same pin.

[10:30] Pimbal Zombies was PANED people.

[10:34] Talk so much smack about the shot layout and how they basically called the game Terrible.

[10:40] Re-Theme it, Rob Zombie.

[10:43] All of a sudden people love it.

[10:45] All of a sudden Terrible gameplay becomes brutal gameplay.

[10:49] And now it's enjoyable because the theme is there, the music is there, and people love it.

[10:54] So Ghostbusters.

[10:55] So here's the thing.

[10:57] I don't think I've seen a pin that people have predicted to be as amazing, as incredible,

[11:06] as Ghostbusters without seeing really anything.

[11:12] But what's curious about this thread, if you read it, it seems like people have seen stuff.

[11:21] And there are...

[11:23] There's a pretty decent amount of people that are saying things as if they've seen the playfield, seen the mechs, seen the toys,

[11:36] seen what's going to be in the game for the most part.

[11:39] And I don't know, it's like this small little colluminati that's all sharing the information amongst each other.

[11:46] And I don't know, I think myself like a lot of other people have asked for PMs of anything just to sort of validate what people are saying is so great about the pin.

[11:57] I didn't get anything, but again, the chances of someone sharing something with Canada are slim to none.

[12:02] But it's kind of crazy that the cat is out of the bag so much on Ghostbusters that people are pretty much saying,

[12:11] but the clock just shows the freaking thing. This is not even a secret anymore. What are you even waiting for?

[12:16] There's so much hype and discussion, might as well just reveal it.

[12:22] I think they're not revealing it yet, because why bother?

[12:26] They can still get sales on Spider-Man VE.

[12:30] They're still in the middle of selling a lot of game of thrones, game of thrones premiums, are shipping.

[12:36] That's what I hear. I think they're all going out. It's not all of them, but they're starting to go out.

[12:42] I believe this week to distributors, people should have them probably next week.

[12:47] So Stern does it right. They have those windows where they let a game breathe. They give it its chance to be the top dog and get its orders.

[12:56] They move on to the next. That window of two months, three months between big reveals is pretty amazing how they sustain it and keep it going.

[13:08] But Ghostbusters, there is some I think bold statements happening that I don't know if this pin or any pin could literally live up to what people are saying.

[13:23] I want to say something that I've seen a few times.

[13:28] People are saying this machine has 10 times the innovation of what's out there. 10 times. I mean, come on. That's not true.

[13:40] For a machine to have 10 times the innovation, there would have to be a stay puff marshmallow man that blew up and inflated like a big hero, a six character and started to actually walk down the play field towards the ball.

[14:00] There is nothing in this pin will be a 10 times forward leap in innovation.

[14:06] And then you see stuff like that and everyone goes nuts. One statement like that coming from a guy who's claiming to have seen the machine makes everyone want a pre-loader.

[14:17] It gets them in a frenzy. I've heard rumors that the L.E.s are sold out.

[14:23] The L.E.s are not sold out. And how many L.E.s are they going to make? I have a feeling this L.E. on this machine is going to be like a thousand L.E.s.

[14:35] And then what's the point even when they're just going to make tons of premiums until they sell the last one they can sell?

[14:45] And 10 times the innovation, let's be honest here, there's no LCD in this. And we all thought that that was a guarantee that, oh my god, there's no LCD in Game of Thrones.

[14:59] But we have been told that there's going to be an LCD in Ghostbusters. This is the one that they've been waiting for. This is the full realization of spike and we're going to get it.

[15:10] We're not getting it. And I don't, it's strange because I think people are still like, well that's cool. Like it sucks, but we're working at Color Dots.

[15:19] Are we? Are we really getting at Color Dots with Ghostbusters? I don't think so.

[15:25] There is no pressure on Stern to put in this level of innovation at all right now.

[15:34] Again, they're still the only ones shipping. They're still the only ones with these incredible themes. They have no real competition.

[15:41] I think it's a huge, huge disappointment that Ghostbusters doesn't have an LCD. I would love it to have Color Dots.

[15:48] But I think what's kind of sad about the lack of LCD and the realization is this, they're not going to have clips from the movie in it that look great.

[15:59] The way they could, if Jersey Jack Pimball made Ghostbusters and was pulling clips from the movie the way he did with Hobbit.

[16:06] And I think that's unfortunate. I think there's so many iconic scenes in there that are just unfortunate that they're not going to have it.

[16:13] They might not have been able to. There might have just been a, it's probably a licensing issue with the actors in that film.

[16:20] But it looks like we're going to see the actors on the translate.

[16:25] And let's talk about that because the translate actually created a whole nother discussion that people were having around Ghostbusters.

[16:33] And again, this just goes to show, in the absence of any real reveal or assets or things to discuss, the way we nitpick on Pinside, something that it hasn't even been shown yet,

[16:47] I think speaks to people's incredible passion around Pimball, but also how kind of crazy we are about Pimball.

[16:56] So people began to really dissect the logo. And apparently there's two ways Ghostbusters appears.

[17:05] One is Ghostbusters spelled out with the small B and it's all one word.

[17:12] Or the alternate is Ghost on top and Busters on the bottom.

[17:17] And they've used that sometimes in, I believe in video games. They've used it in cartoons. They've split it up.

[17:25] In the movie poster, it looks like the single word.

[17:30] And this sort of got people going like it's got to be the full word, it can't be two words.

[17:35] But the translate has the two words, it has them stacked.

[17:40] And that translate that leaked, I think that's it.

[17:45] That is Zombie Yeti's style. And he still got a lot of the purple hue tones carried over from his J-pop days.

[17:55] And it looks good, I like it a lot. I think that if people are disappointed by that, I think they're going to be disappointed in the art style of this pen when it's revealed.

[18:07] But I think it's going to be a beautiful pen and I hope they let him go crazy.

[18:13] What I like about what's happening to is Ghost Busters, I think, is going to come out with completely hand drawing art, hand drawing of the characters versus aliens, which is more of the clip art dropping of the assets.

[18:30] And it's not really like a drawn feel, it's more of a laid out version of different assets and clip arts from the studio.

[18:39] So we're going to see those two go, they're going to battle it out.

[18:43] And Stern is going to reveal and ship Ghost Busters before Alien is possibly even fully revealed.

[18:51] Actually, it looks like we're going to get a Ghost Busters reveal in February, which definitely will be before we see any full reveal on Alien.

[18:59] So Ghost Busters is going to raise the bar in terms of what people expect from a movie based pen in 2016.

[19:09] And the competition is stiff. Too bad Lebowski is not out because I think Lebowski really, really raised the bar and broad.

[19:20] I think Lebowski could be seen as a pen that's bringing not 10 times innovation, but maybe two or three times the innovation that we've seen in some of the recent Sterns.

[19:30] So let's see what happens.

[19:34] And a lot of people are rushing to pre-order Ghost Busters and I'll say this, who are you pre-ordering with?

[19:41] I actually have a, I think a pre-order down with Ghost Busters and I won't lie, I got, I got suckered into all the hype with Trent at Tilt of Musements.

[19:53] And it's $100. And I think it's just a spot online for the next LE.

[20:00] It's funny because I emailed him like this is for Ghost Busters and you've read you have an LE spot, the next LE spot that comes out and he won't say Ghost Busters.

[20:08] So I don't know what I have, it doesn't feel like much, but I'm not paying much.

[20:12] But there's absolutely no gamble when you pre-order a Stern. There is, you know, there's not really like a pre-ordering thing, they'll reveal it and then it goes up for sale and then you pay in fall.

[20:22] This isn't something where people are going to have their money frozen for a long period of time.

[20:27] So here's a thing.

[20:31] Here's what I think is going to happen next. And this seems to be the typical thing we do with all new Stern reveals.

[20:39] When we finally see it, will this be the Stern that people don't on day one find something to bitch about?

[20:50] Will this be the one that looks great, that has great toys and shots and features? Will this be the one that has good code out of the gate?

[21:05] Will this be the one that has callouts and has the immersion that people are looking for in a theme, especially with a theme as popular?

[21:18] So I think people are going to do what we always do and look for something to bitch about.

[21:25] But from the hype we've been hearing, this sounds like it's going to be the one that is just, we just accept, we accept it.

[21:33] We know the price model for Stern, so I don't think we're going to bitch about price, so then that leaves it down to those other elements I just described.

[21:41] And look, Game of Thrones, almost there. If Game of Thrones art knocked out of the park, nobody would have bitched about anything because everything else was pretty awesome.

[21:51] But here's, if you look at the fact that this is a John Trudeau pen, and this is supposed to be, you know this supposed to be the breakout hit,

[22:04] where he's not really known for knocking it out of the park in WrestleMania, anyone? Mustang?

[22:19] Yeah, Mustang shoots well, but I guess the theme has that pen sort of dead on arrival. He's done Congo, Flintstones, Judge Dread, Creature from the Black Lagoon.

[22:35] You know, so we'll see, we'll see. I also think that my prediction is this, I think people are going to love Ghostbusters.

[22:47] I think it's going to be great. And I think people are going to do something that's going to be annoying to others, and I think this is what they're going to do.

[22:55] Ghostbusters is going to come out, and there's going to be a ha ha, like this is what Game of Thrones should have been.

[23:02] If for some reason, when people get the hot new pen, they always have to look down at the previous releases and sort of point of finger and being like, you know, you're no longer like King of the road when it comes to pinball.

[23:17] And I think people, I've already seen it, people are starting to bash Game of Thrones, even Game of Thrones owners are starting to get like a little defensive times.

[23:26] I think Kiss People are just, you know, Kiss has sort of gone into a little bit of an oblivion space and doesn't seem to get any love anymore.

[23:36] But let's not do that, because I think Game of Thrones, from what I'm hearing from people, I'm not the biggest fan, simply because of the light show and the artwork.

[23:45] But I'm going to play a lot of it in New Orleans. I think Tiger Law is going to get his Ellie, and I'm going to be able to play it for a while.

[23:55] So I'm really hoping to spend some time and then see what the Game of Thrones Ellie is all about.

[24:00] So we'll see what happens. 46 pages, nobody's seen anything. Some people claim they have. I really hope we get a reveal within a month so we can actually sit down and talk about this pin.

[24:12] But go asbestos is blowing up, everybody wants it, and you know, I hope it's good.

[24:17] Never before have so few made so much fun for so many. Watch it, play it, buy it. It's Attack from Mars.

[24:29] I love that clip. It's from one of the original marketing materials for Attack from Mars from 1985.

[24:37] I love how it tells you just to go buy it. So it seems that planetary pinball who sort of shocked the pinball world when they said they were going to remake medieval madness.

[24:49] And it seems that their second title is going to be Attack from Mars. And that seems to be the big rumor. Some people think it might be Monster Bash.

[25:00] But let's talk about what we want to talk about what we think this game is going to be priced at because I think there's been a lot of discussion about what should Attack from Mars cost if it's remade.

[25:15] I don't want to get too much into the whole who the hell would pre-order this, but I think it goes without saying that if you pre-order Attack from Mars from planetary pinball, there's something wrong with you.

[25:27] The fact that after two years, people have still not gotten their medieval manises that they've paid in fall for is crazy.

[25:37] It shows that it is hard to make pinball machines even when it's already been made.

[25:44] But it sucks for those people who are still waiting and the MMR unboxing thread moves very slowly and they trickle out.

[25:59] I've heard it's because there's just part supply issues with the game. And if they did attack from Mars, it wouldn't be so bad because there wouldn't be as many parts needed to make it or as intricate of part supply required.

[26:16] But I think planetary pinball knows that if they ask for pre-order on this next machine that they're done, that there's no way that anyone will go in on it and wait.

[26:28] That being said, let's look at Attack from Mars. So the game originally came out in 1995.

[26:35] It is currently ranked number three on pincides top 100.

[26:42] The concept in design was by Brian Eddy. The software was by Lyman Sheets.

[26:49] And when the game came out, a lot of people speculated that it was sort of based on the movie Mars attacks.

[26:56] But according to George Gomez, the game was not inspired at all by the movie.

[27:03] And the concept for the game was in development long before the movie came out. It just was coincidence that they sort of came to the market at the same exact time.

[27:14] The marketing slogans for the game were funny. I'm just getting some of these facts off pincides.

[27:19] The attack is on, get it or get left behind. In unstoppable earnings invasion. I love that. I love how these games were marketed. They really just towards operators.

[27:31] There was no home collecting going on that.

[27:34] So I did a little search on an eBay for, and I know that's, this is again just to show some context of what people are listing these for.

[27:46] If you go to eBay, there's one listed for 12,995 dollars. That person's an idiot. They will never get that.

[27:54] There's another listed for 8,600. There's one for 700. There's one for 6,950 dollars. On pin side, there's an incomplete one for sale.

[28:08] The most recent one was for 5,500. There was a very nice example on pin side 11 months ago that was listed for 7,900.

[28:17] And within the thread of that for sale, there was a lot of support of that price.

[28:24] Great game, great price. We were allowed to responses. The price police were not coming down in that person.

[28:29] Crazy Levi sold one for 5K that needed tons of work a year ago. Currently 700 pinciders have this.

[28:37] So this is a game that even though they made 3,450 of them back in the day, a lot of pinciders have this game.

[28:47] So it's out there. It's not really a hard-to-find pin.

[28:54] But there's still demand for one. It's still one of the greatest pins ever made.

[29:03] Here's what's interesting. From reading the thread and hearing what people are saying about price, it sounds like a lot of people expect this pin to be cheaper than medieval madness.

[29:20] And I'm not sure why people expect that.

[29:23] Pinsturor 68 said $5,495. It's got about as much tech in it as Iron Man VE. So it should be priced accordingly.

[29:36] And that post got 14 people to give it a thumbs up with no down votes.

[29:43] Okay, if you think that a brand new inbox attack from Mars remake is going to sell for the price of Iron Man VE, you are crazy.

[29:58] That is never going to happen. It's what everyone would love to happen.

[30:04] But there is just no way. Guys, think about the delays on getting MMOR out. Think about them knowing the difficulties in remaking these pins.

[30:14] And there's clearly much more that has to be done to get these things shipping.

[30:22] And Time Ecos money with these guys. Every day that there's delays, they're losing potential sales.

[30:32] And also, if they redo the dots in attack from Mars, the way they're doing it on medieval madness, who knows when that's coming out, right?

[30:41] There's just, there's cost involved in all that.

[30:45] And lastly, Iron Man VE is going to do nothing but continually disappoint people who consider Iron Man VV to be the bar for where remakes should be priced.

[31:00] We saw that all the time in the Spider-Man VE thread. People just kept saying, well, Iron Man VE, Iron Man VE, you guys know, Iron Man was just more of like another run of Iron Man parts that they had lying around.

[31:14] They didn't really do much. So don't ever expect another remake to come even close to that Iron Man price.

[31:23] Wise Snow says they can't even get MMR produced and out the door. So even if attack from Mars is the next title, it appears it will be years before you can get one.

[31:33] For price, MMR was unique since that was where originals were selling for 11 to 12K. Attack from Mars can still be found in players' condition for half that.

[31:44] They need to be below stern premium pricing if they want to compete sell.

[31:50] And then he says, 5500 to 6000 at max. There's almost no tech in attack from Mars and no reason for it to be more than that.

[31:59] Aside from that, it seems that tech from Mars are readily found currently.

[32:04] Okay.

[32:07] I just, you're never going to see an attack from Mars for 5500 to 6000.

[32:13] There's just no way.

[32:16] I understand there's no tech in it or almost no tech in it.

[32:22] It's still the number 3 Pimball Machine ever in terms of ranking.

[32:29] And also, guys, players' condition pricing versus new inbox is a humongous difference.

[32:41] So if you find a player's condition pin, how much is a player's condition attack from Mars going? If crazy leave I sold one for 5K.

[32:52] And why snow is saying that a new inbox should go for 5500 to 6000?

[32:58] Guys, that's just...

[33:01] ...lunacy there.

[33:03] If you think that there's only a 500 to a thousand dollar hike in price for a brand new one.

[33:08] Brand new. Never been touched. Never been touched.

[33:14] How many home use only 1995 attack from Mars are there? Probably next to none.

[33:21] So I think people who are thinking this way are just going to be severely disappointed.

[33:27] Concrete HardT says, rumor I heard is that attack from Mars will be cheaper than MMR.

[33:34] It really needs to be in the 6-6500 range or they won't sell.

[33:40] Okay, here's what I don't get, guys.

[33:44] They need to be in the 6-6500 range or they won't sell.

[33:48] And yet a year ago, a year ago, a very nice example of attack from Mars was on Pinside for $7,900 and it was praise for being a great price.

[33:58] Okay, $14,000 more than what Concrete HardT says is the price range it should be at.

[34:06] A new inbox pin is nicer than any use example that has ever been listed for sale unless it was a heft restored or professionally restored nicer than new version, guys.

[34:18] I'm just wondering where people are coming with these prices.

[34:21] It's like we're setting ourselves up for disappointment. It's not going to happen.

[34:24] You're not going to see attack from Mars between 6 and 6500.

[34:30] If it happens, I literally will donate $100 to Pinside when that happens if we see attack from Mars for $6,500.

[34:40] And you have my word.

[34:43] RcB Brown, $316,000, they know what the market will bear for the original and price accordingly in my opinion.

[34:51] I see most attack from Mars going for $6,500.

[34:55] That means $7,995 for the new one I'm guessing.

[34:59] Okay, so I agree.

[35:02] I think it's going to be priced around $8,000.

[35:06] Exactly around where MMR is at.

[35:09] And that's it. I really don't see when you're remaking these all-star titles and you've seen the demand for them and how beautiful they are when you pull these things out of a box.

[35:21] It's not every day you get to pull an unmolested attack from Mars that just looks incredible.

[35:28] Oh, SPFX Ted says, I'm in at $6,500.

[35:33] Oh god, all you guys who are in at $6,000.

[35:36] If you really think you're going to get the pin for that price, I suggest you call Planetary Pimble right now and say, hey guys, I think attack from Mars is going to be $6,500.

[35:49] And I pretty much guarantee you this is going to be their response.

[35:53] Yeah, it's not going to happen, guys. $8,000 is what attack from Mars is going to go for.

[36:15] And if they built them and there's no pre-order, they're going to sell them.

[36:19] They're going to sell my cupcakes at that price. New inbox. It's going to be beautiful.

[36:24] Let it go, let it go, turn away and slam a door.

[36:31] Buy your hair, what they're going to say. Let the store rage on.

[36:42] Canada has been frozen on Pinside.

[36:49] For those of you that have been following my podcast thread, you will have seen that I've been frozen.

[36:57] I saw a lot of people ecstatic by that news.

[37:02] I saw some people celebrating as if I was banned permanently.

[37:08] But no, that is not the case. I am not gone forever.

[37:15] I have been frozen for two weeks for doing something silly and stupid and pretty innocuous, but still I broke a roll.

[37:26] I created a dupe account under the name Kylo Ren and made a few silly posts.

[37:34] If you go look at them, they're all pretty ridiculous.

[37:39] People pointed out that it was me right away to which I just stopped even using it.

[37:44] But it is a violation and I know that people use duplicate accounts to do nefarious things with them.

[37:54] That is not my intent with that. It has been dismantled.

[37:59] I actually spent a good hour and 15 minutes talking to Robin via Skype about it and just about form behavior and what it's been like being on the forum and people's perception of me and how people respond.

[38:21] We had a really good conversation.

[38:24] A lot of what we talked about was what I'm doing with some of the threads I put up is it just to get people to react and stir the pot.

[38:37] Is it trolling as someone call it?

[38:41] I agree that some of the things I post are designed to get people to react and start a dialogue about something that may not always be things people want to talk about.

[38:53] Like my thread about what would be the street price if magic girl or predator prototypes were sold.

[39:01] I still think it's an interesting thing. I'm still pissed at those two for ripping people off for their money.

[39:08] We had a good talk and what we sort of like to take away was that I'm going to keep a lot of my conversation and dialogue.

[39:22] I'm going to take it to my podcast and talk about it here and use this as a medium to say more of what I want to say instead of sort of being constantly in all the threads.

[39:35] I'm not going to hold punches on here and that's an important thing.

[39:41] I think that there are a lot of great podcasts out there and everyone plays nice in the sandbox and that's great.

[39:49] But the same can't be said about pin-side and the way we talk about pinball.

[39:54] I want to capture that and I want this to be a place where people can come on and say whatever they want to say and how they really feel and not feel like everything is just always going to be sugar-coded.

[40:04] But I want to keep it here and I hope you keep listening because you're going to hear things on here that make it you ban from a thread on pin-side.

[40:12] I did say that to Rob and I said I've been prematurely banned from a lot of thread for saying things that everyone else can get away with but me.

[40:23] I also take a lot of personal attacks from people and they don't even get a warning.

[40:29] And I'm fine with it. I'm totally cool. I have thick skin.

[40:33] So let me conclude this podcast with a topic that I was debating whether or not I would respond to it.

[40:43] But I just want to and I want to close the loop and really just clarify what I've been talking about the last couple podcasts with Alien Pinball.

[40:55] And the way the art was revealed and what we've heard about the characters in the game.

[41:01] So I've been critical. I've been critical of the way they've handled the reveal.

[41:06] I've been critical of the two headed spokesperson that they have in Oregon, Andrew.

[41:13] And I've been critical of the fact that they've revealed a machine while they're still figuring out the contracting issues with the characters from Alien.

[41:24] And I want to read something that or just sort of quote or ex-response to some of the stuff I've been saying and how he says it.

[41:37] So he says no one said there are no actors in the game.

[41:44] Apparently some more on his podcasting this now like it's a fact.

[41:48] But he's an idiot who doesn't know shit from gold and he has zero inside information.

[41:53] So please just put him on ignore like the rest of the sensible world.

[41:57] Okay.

[42:00] Are there actors in the game right now?

[42:03] What we've been told is no. And that is simply what I reported.

[42:07] If there are actors in the game, I will happily announce who they are and I applaud that because like everyone else who is in on the game,

[42:17] I'm just in on an alien and I am on an alien, Ellie.

[42:22] I am number 95 and my money is down.

[42:26] It's nice to know that I'm a customer of highway and I'm being called an idiot.

[42:32] Okay. But I know just like or when I decide to have this commentary and have this podcast, I am more than a customer.

[42:40] I am someone who's open to critique and I happily accept that.

[42:43] But nothing that I reported on with alien E was in factual.

[42:48] There I said in my podcast if you go listen that they are in talks and negotiating with the actors from the film.

[42:57] And then I hope that they get everybody in the film.

[43:00] What I said was why would you start working on art and the game and the programming until you've had those negotiations finalized?

[43:12] Because I do think and I think all of you out there, whether you're in on alien or not agree that adding characters and call outs from the actors makes a game better.

[43:28] It just does. It makes us feel more immersed and I think that it is a mistake to get too far down the development and production road until you know what all of your assets are.

[43:41] So I don't think I'm being an idiot when I make that statement.

[43:46] Or it then goes on to say this is the real world. We're all big boys and if someone is being a moron and spreading false rumors, then I'm going to say so.

[43:56] Okay. Nothing I said was a false rumor. I simply reported what we know to be the case currently with highway.

[44:04] He goes on to say I don't care about his ego or anything else. Apparently he said I'm some kind of partner at highway or something.

[44:12] No, I never said that. I've constantly reported that you are freelance creative director who works for highway.

[44:20] You are not a highway employee, although you sure do speak as if you are the main spokesperson for the company.

[44:28] So he says I'm a contractor for this game and that's that I have zero say in the company.

[44:40] After alien I'm backed my own personal projects. This is just a hobby for me. I have a job that I love not quitting for pinball bats for sure.

[44:49] Okay, that's fine.

[44:54] But man, we sure hear a lot of talk as if he has some say in the company and he's speaking for the company.

[45:05] So look, I will reiterate what I have said.

[45:10] I hope that the characters make it in the game.

[45:14] I think that alien has great potential and we're going to have to wait and see how it all pans out.

[45:23] But I think there's just stuff that makes you scratch your head and it's kind of crazy how defensive this individual gets every time people bring it up.

[45:40] Let's take for example, and this is the last point I'll make. You're making an alien pin.

[45:46] Right?

[45:49] What's the end scene in alien that is the iconic scene?

[45:53] So Gourney Weaver in the power loader defeating the alien.

[46:02] The power loader as of now is not in the game or not a mode.

[46:10] I don't get stuff like that guys. I don't get why when we hear stuff like that people are just like, oh well you get to find the cat, you get to find Jonesy.

[46:19] I mean, come on.

[46:22] Not having that scene or that mode.

[46:27] It's like not having destroy the ring and the end moment.

[46:34] It's not battling the stay puff monster.

[46:37] But again, because people personally like someone, they're willing to forgive a lot of the things that should upset the fans or make them want to change it.

[46:48] And here's the thing.

[46:51] If we've learned anything, feedback like that will hopefully get it in the game.

[46:55] And I saw a lot of people saying, come on, you got to put that in and they have to put that in.

[47:00] And the last thing I'll say about all this back and forth with alien and oric is this.

[47:07] All they ever hear from oric all the time is how thick his skin is and he can take it.

[47:14] And yet he's the first person to keep saying to put canada on ignore.

[47:22] If you've got such thick skin, my friend, why are you ignoring conversation that's taking place?

[47:30] Okay? Your skin's not that thick.

[47:34] And we're on here and we're discussing your pinball machine and I'm getting feedback on your pinball machine.

[47:41] So I wish you'd keep an open mind and actually listen to all of the conversation that's taking place about what you're working on.

[47:49] And I do feel bad.

[47:51] I feel bad that he won't go into the thread, that he won't contribute to the dialogue that's happening around alien.

[48:01] And I just want to end this podcast with something I felt like I should have done probably a couple weeks ago when I first started critiquing the alien pin.

[48:17] I made a mistake. I should have politely invited him to join the pinball podcast thread and I did it and I just started saying all this stuff and now he doesn't want to join.

[48:31] So I'm going to end this podcast with the message that I sent to oric the other day encouraging him to join the thread and participate in the conversation.

[48:43] And I really hope he hears this and he takes it to heart and that he joins the thread and he engages in the great dialogue that's taking place there.

[48:52] So here's the message I left him. Have a good night ladies and gentlemen and we'll be back in a few days.

[48:59] Go in there and try. I know you can win. But even if you don't, so what? So you lose. As long as you lose. Like a winner, it doesn't matter.

[49:08] Because you did it with dignity. I'm telling you if you don't go in there, you're going to be sorry. You're going to regret it your whole life. You know what I mean?

[49:15] Come on. I know you can do it. Will you do it for me? Come on. Let's get it.

[49:25] The world meets nobody halfway. Remember that.

[49:34] You got to do what's best for you. Always do that.
