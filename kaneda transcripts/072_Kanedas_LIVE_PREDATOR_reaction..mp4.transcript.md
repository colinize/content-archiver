[00:00] Now we've got the live chat.

[00:03] All right, we're going live here.

[00:06] We're one minute late.

[00:09] We're always late to room party.

[00:11] Let's get people in here.

[00:12] Share.

[00:15] Boom.

[00:18] Boom.

[00:20] To watch Predator Live together, together forever.

[00:31] It's supposed to be 9 a.m.

[00:37] Boom.

[00:38] Boom.

[00:41] Who we got in the house here?

[00:42] We got Charles.

[00:44] We've got Dave Sanders, our mean Billy.

[00:49] What's up?

[00:56] A couple of Joe went to tell me jazz last night.

[00:59] We're all off tomorrow for June 10th.

[01:03] Sound and chat are fine now.

[01:05] We got it going, baby.

[01:07] We got it going.

[01:09] You know, Connecticut is going to always, always,

[01:12] always hang out when the party's starting around pinball.

[01:15] And this is a game that I think everyone's just relieved

[01:19] that it's over the wait.

[01:22] We've got 13 minutes.

[01:23] No more janghis teasers.

[01:26] God help us.

[01:27] God help us.

[01:27] No janghis.

[01:28] I love you.

[01:29] We're just tired of the teasers, bro.

[01:31] It's not, he always takes it personal when I make fun

[01:34] of the slow rollout.

[01:35] And I'm just like, I just like, I just show me the game.

[01:39] Show me the game.

[01:40] Show me the money.

[01:41] Show me if you're going to get my money.

[01:44] Is what the whole thing's about.

[01:47] We're all tired of teasers.

[01:49] The Facebook says 3 p.m.

[01:50] Eastern Center time.

[01:51] The janghis give me the wrong time.

[01:53] Are you serious?

[01:55] He told me 9 a.m.

[01:59] Oh, great.

[02:02] All right, so what?

[02:03] God, so we have to wait even longer?

[02:07] So we have to wait even longer.

[02:09] I'm going to show you where he said in the chat.

[02:13] He told me 3 p.m. 9 a.m.

[02:18] You know what?

[02:19] I don't even, I'm at the point now.

[02:21] I don't even care anymore.

[02:22] This whole thing is just stupid.

[02:26] Wait.

[02:29] 21 century, what?

[02:34] I don't even understand.

[02:35] Is it 9 p.m. his time?

[02:40] Oh, man.

[02:45] It's 9 o'clock at night.

[02:46] Oh, I thought he meant the morning.

[02:49] Why would they do it at night?

[02:52] I, I, so I got the time wrong.

[02:54] Obviously.

[02:55] Ah.

[02:59] I mean, let me even check my calendar if I can even

[03:02] redo this at 3.

[03:05] I don't even want it.

[03:06] I don't even want to wait.

[03:18] All right.

[03:23] I guess I could do it at 3.

[03:25] So come back at 3.

[03:29] It's like, let's just hang for a little bit.

[03:32] I'll do my podcast now.

[03:36] Let me just let people know it's at 3 o'clock.

[03:44] I just assumed it was the morning.

[03:45] It was my bad.

[03:51] Let me just change his photo.

[03:55] I'm going to do it.

[03:57] I just want to see the game.

[04:01] Oh, God.

[04:02] You know what's going to happen now is like it's just going to leak.

[04:07] It's going to leak because someone's just going to let something we all have the assets.

[04:13] And now what's going to happen is it's going to leak early and then we'll just do it.

[04:19] I mean, what's going to happen now.

[04:21] the assets and now what's going to happen is it's going to leak early and then that's it.

[04:28] I'm going to have to like, it's going to spoil.

[04:32] Let's do this.

[04:40] 250 PM.

[04:46] I'm just updating my cover photo.

[04:50] Hold on, I'm getting right back with you.

[04:56] So, so annoying.

[05:04] So annoying.

[05:08] So annoying.

[05:10] Let's get rid of that.

[05:17] All right, hold on.

[05:28] I'm just updating.

[05:30] Oh, I hate, I hate having to do stuff like this because you know, I like to be on time.

[05:38] I like to be accurate with my stuff.

[05:41] I'm never accurate.

[05:42] You know that.

[05:43] I'm just joking.

[05:44] Here we go.

[05:45] There we go.

[05:46] Let's go to Patreon.

[05:50] How's everybody doing?

[05:57] How's everybody doing?

[06:01] I know.

[06:05] Oh God.

[06:12] God.

[06:17] Hold on.

[06:22] Hold on.

[06:23] I'm just uploading both the Patreon.

[06:24] Okay.

[06:25] We're good now.

[06:26] All right.

[06:27] Let's just talk for a little bit.

[06:28] Then I'm going to do my show.

[06:29] Good morning.

[06:30] Vietnam.

[06:31] I blame James for all of this.

[06:38] Yeah.

[06:39] No.

[06:40] I look, I'm not gunning for Carrie Hardy's Facebook.

[06:44] I'm sorry, his YouTube domination.

[06:52] The AI art on Potter is going to be one of the topics I talk about today.

[06:56] It's, I feel bad for them.

[06:58] I don't think they've realized it.

[07:01] I think it's, it's subtle until it's not subtle.

[07:06] And it's embarrassing to get caught with it like that.

[07:10] And I'm worried about, I'm worried about like Warner Brothers like finding out and being

[07:15] like, what is this?

[07:17] Like, I don't know what happened.

[07:22] Yeah.

[07:23] Like it's bad.

[07:24] Like, I don't know if it's like AI or it's just more like an art filter they put it through.

[07:34] Canadian you like switch to sucks Mario Kart has no soul.

[07:37] What do you mean?

[07:38] I love Mario Kart too.

[07:40] The strategy of it is like, I love the knockout rounds.

[07:53] Was the last Mario Kart better?

[07:56] See to me Mario Kart was always Mario Kart 64.

[08:03] Mario Kart World plays like Mario Kart arcade.

[08:06] Ah, okay.

[08:08] What what what don't you like about it?

[08:10] See I haven't been.

[08:12] I haven't like been through the Mario Kart iterations.

[08:20] Took skill.

[08:21] Yeah, I think that's the one thing I didn't notice is like is you like is like you don't

[08:27] even want to be in the lead and it doesn't matter like you just end up losing because

[08:34] of the power of like in the last second.

[08:40] Photoshop has an AI assisted blend thing.

[08:49] I think that there is a you know who reached out to me was I reached out to him to talk.

[08:58] And let's see I reached I reached out to a bread abyss to talk about potter he got

[09:11] back to me they know they're working on it gang and they know the issues and let me tell

[09:16] you they they understand what the feedback's been and I think they're going to I think

[09:23] they're going to fix it all.

[09:25] And I don't understand I don't I to me the more annoying people are the the potter fanatics

[09:32] that are saying the game is great as it is and it's just like it's not because of the

[09:38] code.

[09:40] But again, I think they'll get it there.

[09:42] I also do think Stern will get X men there now.

[09:45] I think these companies now are realizing what these things are to us.

[09:50] They're very expensive things that we want to have them in our homes permanently.

[09:58] And I don't think people should we do something I haven't done before.

[10:04] I'll do a little bit of editing but cannot do you guys want to hang out here while I do

[10:10] my podcast and just hit record and you can see how with no notes I do an episode of

[10:16] Canadian pinball podcast there might be some moments I like resay something because I might

[10:22] fumble it again because I don't do any notes.

[10:25] I don't have any editing but if you guys want to hang out here and hear an episode of

[10:30] Canadian pinball podcast live and see that that's where the talent is baby ain't no guest

[10:36] to require.

[10:37] I hear people are doing interviews but do you want to just hear it?

[10:40] Get a little free episode on YouTube.

[10:43] Let's do it.

[10:44] Alright, let's do it.

[10:45] Alright, you can see how my mind works in shaping together a show because it's kind of

[10:52] all over the place but that what that means is I'm not going to be reading your things.

[10:58] This is not going to be like interactive.

[11:00] It's going to be we go live baby.

[11:02] Let's do it live, damn it.

[11:05] Alright, welcome to Canadian pinball podcast live on YouTube because we all thought that

[11:11] Jenga's meant 9am was going to be when the pinball brothers finally revealed predator pinball

[11:18] to the world.

[11:19] We're all tired of the teasers.

[11:21] No, Jenga's we're not tired of you.

[11:23] We are tired of the slow rollout of this game and today is finally going to be the day

[11:29] where all the questions are answered is predator pinball going to be worth it?

[11:34] Are we finally going to see a game that has interactive mix?

[11:38] We know Arnold is not in the game but that Gatlin gun is pretty cool.

[11:42] I don't think it fires any pinballs but it's got some cool Gatlin gun action.

[11:48] We've got a lot of drama brewing over in the Harry Potter thread because of artificial

[11:53] intelligence was AI used to generate the artwork on Harry Potter.

[12:00] Something's going on there, right?

[12:02] You see it, I see it.

[12:03] There's a dragon with like two eyes on one side.

[12:07] The crest is a little weird.

[12:09] The locomotive is all over the place.

[12:12] The castle's got all weird stuff going on.

[12:15] There's like windows coming through trees.

[12:18] What happened with the filtering of the artwork on this game, we're going to talk about

[12:24] that.

[12:25] We're going to talk a little bit about King Kong.

[12:28] Is that game going to have some sort of second life because I think sales have pretty

[12:34] much flatlined on that machine?

[12:37] Dune pinball has a new mode out there, rescue mode.

[12:40] I want to talk about if barrels of fun can actually get people excited again about this

[12:46] game.

[12:47] If pinball streams are the way to go because I just have to be candid.

[12:52] You ever see a pinball stream and it's like a dude.

[12:56] He's in a dark room and one camera's on him, one's on the play field, one's on the screen

[13:01] of the game and it's all happening at once.

[13:05] It is the worst way, I believe, to experience a pinball machine.

[13:10] What you really just want is someone to shoot it in a way that gets you excited and you

[13:15] to be focused on the thing.
