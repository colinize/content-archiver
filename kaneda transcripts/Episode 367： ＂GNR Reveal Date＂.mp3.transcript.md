[00:00] Turn around, look at what you see

[00:10] In her face, the mirror of your tree

[00:20] We believe on that freeware

[00:23] Gidding in the light

[00:26] We're in on the pages

[00:29] It's the answer to

[00:31] I never had an enjoying heart

[00:37] The Sidler, Sidler, Sidler, Sidler, Sidler, Sidler, Sidler, Sidler

[00:42] Welcome to episode 367 of

[00:45] Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:46] The only pinball podcast

[00:48] with powder coated armor

[00:49] Hey, did you hear the news?

[00:51] Mr. Moberg, he's leaving pin-side

[00:53] Oh my God!

[00:57] I mean, this is the new trend now

[00:59] Where you can start threads in which people have to announce to the entire world that they're leaving pin-side

[01:04] He writes, I doubt many will care

[01:07] I mean, he could have just stopped right there

[01:09] We don't care

[01:10] We don't care

[01:12] We don't care

[01:14] We don't care

[01:16] I mean, he could have just stopped right there

[01:18] We don't care

[01:19] Just some random user is going to get off of pin-side

[01:22] Who cares?

[01:23] There's like 50,000 people that are registered on pin-side

[01:27] And he says like, instead of just ghosting like vid 1900

[01:31] I'm going to explain why I'm leaving

[01:33] First of all, vid 1900 is still on pin-side

[01:37] under different alias names

[01:39] So I love it when they went on a witch hunt

[01:41] to get all of Canada's like alias is off of pin-side

[01:45] I'm not on there, I haven't been on in a while

[01:47] But I just, I saw this and I couldn't help but laugh

[01:50] That some random nobody is basically making a threat about leaving pin-side

[01:55] And now it is spawned new threads in which people are saying, hey, I'm staying on pin-side

[02:01] It's just funny, couldn't help but chuckle that that

[02:03] Alright, so here's what we're going to do

[02:05] Is it going to be a great episode?

[02:06] We're going to go down the list of manufacturers

[02:09] And we're going to do what we do best

[02:11] Now I actually do have some news for you guys that I think you're going to find interesting

[02:14] in the world of Jersey Jack Pinball

[02:16] I'm going to read some of the commentary that was happening on my last podcast around

[02:23] Derek's assessment of his Willy Wonka game

[02:26] There are some back and forth there I want to read

[02:28] But let's just go down the list of manufacturers and do what Canada Pinball podcast does best

[02:33] And just jump right into it

[02:35] Alright, so American Pinball

[02:37] What is the status of American Pinball

[02:39] And how well is October fest selling?

[02:42] Now look, it is all speculation

[02:45] We don't know how well these games sell but I'll tell you this

[02:49] There is a good place to go that isn't good indicator of how popular or not popular a game is doing

[02:58] And I think Pin-side actually provides data and insight into a game's popularity

[03:04] And by that I mean how popular is the club thread on the game?

[03:10] Compared to another game and how much conversation and how many unboxings are we seeing of a particular title

[03:17] So I want to show you some information that I think is really a telltale sign of how well October fest is selling

[03:25] The October fest club thread which was started a few months ago has 43 total posts in it

[03:32] Okay, so 43 just posts

[03:34] The Willy Wonka Club thread which was started at a similar time has 743 posts in it

[03:43] Okay, 7 hundred more comments have been put into the Willy Wonka Club thread

[03:49] I love the October fest thread because Iceman chimes in and he's like, guys come on post picks of your unboxings

[03:56] And that was like a week ago and there's maybe one or two unboxings that have taken place

[04:01] Where Willy Wonka there will be hundreds of unboxings of Willy Wonka if not a few thousand a year from now

[04:09] So it pretty much shows that there's very little very little activity happening in the American Pinball thread

[04:17] And I think it's safe to say that this is not an assessment of whether or not October fest is a fun game or not

[04:24] But it's like we've said from the from the very beginning

[04:27] I just don't think people are gonna buy this game I think it's a game people are gonna play on location

[04:32] People will have fun with but the desire to own it is not gonna be there

[04:37] It is just not gonna happen and I have said this and I again I offer an olive branch

[04:43] Normal, Davel, hit me up, canada pinball at gmail.com

[04:48] You know, normal hit me up about six months ago maybe a year ago

[04:53] And so I love to talk to you canada about marketing and what we do and what our strategy is

[04:58] And then I followed up with him and then I never heard from him again

[05:02] And so I think what happened was he heard some of my disparaging remarks and my criticisms or critiques of October fest and decided

[05:10] You know what? We'll just we'll just do it ourselves and this is the problem

[05:15] They're gonna spend all this money they're gonna move into this big factory

[05:19] If they don't nail the themes it's gonna be the same thing all over again crickets

[05:24] Crickets I mean imagine this just imagine this scenario our next game is Sherlock Holmes

[05:31] Versus like Jurassic World L.V.A.R.A.3 versus maybe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

[05:39] Versus guns and roses versus something that deeproot has out there versus cactus Canyon

[05:44] Right? It's just gonna be crickets again

[05:47] I think they're gonna I really hope they understand that they're gonna need to get the better themes if they want to get the sales going

[05:55] And it doesn't matter if you throw everything in the kitchen sink in terms of mechs into the game

[05:59] Something's not clicking and making people say I need to buy these games. So we'll see what happens

[06:05] Their next title is going to be interesting because if it's the same exact team that made October fest

[06:10] What differences will we see moving forward? I just really hope they get the overall presentation better

[06:16] Alright Chicago gaming company

[06:18] People are still waiting on their monster bash Ellie's but they're arriving I think I saw like game number like 1127

[06:26] Right sounds really limited. Hey, I got number 1127 of the limited edition of monster bash but they're arriving

[06:34] People are enjoying the game. I think the overall package if you've stood over a monster bash remake Ellie

[06:40] It is beautiful. I mean there's no denying that this game is a phenomenal phenomenal looking game

[06:48] And look their next game is cactus Canyon. It's happening. It's cactus Canyon

[06:53] It's not gonna be anything other than cactus Canyon

[06:56] Which is why if you go on eBay there's a cactus Canyon for sale and very nice condition for 21,000

[07:04] Dollars right if you buy that cactus Canyon for 21,000 dollars you need to have your head examined

[07:12] Here's why you will be able to buy a better version of the game with improved dots

[07:18] They probably will have better sculpts in the game they will make improvements to the game and it will cost you

[07:24] What roughly like eight thousand dollars nine thousand dollars at most versus twenty one thousand dollars

[07:32] See I'm glad I'm glad that we are no longer stuck in a period in which the only way to experience some of these cool games from yesterday years

[07:42] Won't cost you in arm and a leg

[07:46] Twenty one thousand dollars for a pinball machine that we all know is about to be remade

[07:52] So that person is just hoping some ignorant fool comes on to eBay and buys it

[07:57] The other thing if you go on eBay and you just search for high price of pinball what game are you seeing so many of that's kind of embarrassing

[08:05] Beatles diamond edition Beatles left and right they're not selling these clowns need to stop asking 25, 24, 28, 29,000 dollars for it

[08:15] I just played a Beatles yesterday and I have to tell you it's a fun pin it's a fun pin it's the world's greatest five thousand dollar pinball experience you can play

[08:23] At 25,000 at twelve thousand at eight or nine thousand dollars it's a joke it's a total joke there's nothing in it

[08:31] There's nothing in the game it's a hell of a fun experience but don't tell me that that fun equals the value you get for like 25 grand

[08:39] They're just sitting there they're sitting there it's like the supreme games there's one for like eighty thousand dollars

[08:45] My god eighty thousand dollars for a supreme pinball machine you could go buy a brand new Shelby GT500 Mustang for $74,000 and my god

[08:59] I'll tell you which one's more fun all right okay what else is happening in the pinball world stern pinball all right so here's the deal

[09:07] I have pretty much all but confirmation that the next stern pinball machine will be a Keith L. Win game okay

[09:17] Keith L. Win's next game his follow up to iron maiden which you know for all intensive purposes was a successful game for stern

[09:25] I played an iron maiden yesterday unique layout fun game I think a lot of us are wondering what will Keith L. Win's soft moroc game B

[09:35] and what will the design be like what will the mechs be like but it's exciting because I think Keith does approach pinball differently

[09:43] then the cookie cutter design approach with with a lot of stern games now we all know that iron maiden was not originally designed to be iron maiden

[09:53] It was archer and so we know that Keith built that game in his in his basement basically and it was a labor of love

[10:01] Will working within the stern system now allow him the same freedom that he had when he made iron maiden now my criticism of iron maiden's always been the same thing

[10:11] Well first I just don't like the music so it's very subjective I've also felt like that game just lacks toys like it just does you play an iron maiden and you're like all right like you know the zombie

[10:21] Yeti art is cool the layout is really unique the shots are really fun but then when you look at the toys in the game is just very like

[10:31] A lackluster mediocre I think that center ramp to me is the biggest like fail it's like the ball goes up the ramp it hits the target

[10:39] But it just needed something more need it like a magnet to grab the ball when it hits that target and hold the ball frozen in mid air

[10:46] And then you know you get another ball and you have to knock the ball off something interesting it looks like it looks like that shot is going to be something magical

[10:54] And it's just like it's just like throwing a tennis ball against the wall and watching it fall down and being like oh okay I guess that's it and that is it

[11:02] Okay so the question then becomes is Keith L1's game going to be Jurassic World is it going to be something else is it maybe Godzilla I don't know

[11:10] Stern has done a great job a great job at preventing any leaks from happening I have no one has shared anything no I don't think people are passing photos around

[11:20] I think they've done a good job keeping this under wraps the game will be revealed end of July early August so will it be revealed that Comic Con that is my guess is that there will be you know the typical Stern launch

[11:34] I mean it is the most obvious way they launch every single game it's like let's have IGN do a story on the game and then let's take it to a place where most people there don't care at all about pinball and that's how we reveal our games to the world I mean it doesn't really matter because they know that all of you who follow pinball

[11:52] We'll talk about it that's the easiest place for them to launch it you know they're trying to expand the audience I get it but if you're going to launch a game at Comic Con you would think that the game would have some relevance to the Comic Con audience like it would make sense

[12:02] to launch Star Wars there or Guardians of the Galaxy or Deadpool but does it make sense to launch Jurassic World at Comic Con? See I think Jurassic World is a pretty bad theme I don't think the movies were that great I think the first one was okay but I don't think they're going to get the voice actors and Chris Pratt and it's going to be more of like Guardians again with like voice actors like pretending to be the actors from the movie

[12:30] I also just don't know why we're going back to a theme that's old like the movies are old now I mean Jurassic World 1 and 2 have come out the second one was so bad and I don't I don't see a third one coming out anytime soon and I just think there's so many better properties to make a pinball machine on but you know that Jurassic Park theme song kicks in in an arcade setting and all of a sudden it's going to pull people in it will now who's who's coding this game

[12:58] is it going to be Rick Nigel is that I says last name who he did the code for iron maiden is he going to partner up again with Keith Owen or is it going to be like Mike and is it Tanya or Tantanya I sorry guys if I'm butchering these names but the guys who did Deadpool are they going to help code the game it's not going to be Dwight because he just did monsters it's not going to be lime and she's because he's doing L.V.R.3 so I think it's going to be one of the newer stars.

[13:27] We're a stern coders or software engineers working on this game it probably won't be Tim sexting because he just did black night so it seems to be it'd be Rick Mike or Tanya I hope I'm saying that right people are email me and say you know you got it all wrong okay so we'll see we've got about a month to go before stern enters the fold and and gives us something new to talk about exciting times because I do think you know I played months ago yesterday and I will say like you know I'm not seeing it I'm not seeing it in that game

[13:57] I just don't understand the game seems very very shallow to me but maybe maybe people are seeing more than I see in the game all right you know I was playing yesterday with surge he's a friend of mine local guy and we were playing we went to modern pinball to play for a day and I have to say this you know modern pinball it's interesting now they're model their business model is just to start playing and getting in the door now it's it's you get a it's a one time fee and you can play all day long

[14:27] but it's like twenty seven dollars to pay to get in just to play pinball and it used to be more like an hourly basis but man it's expensive to people to play pinball is fifty four dollars and that doesn't come with any drinks there's no music going the pin volumes are not even that loud

[14:45] it hurt it hurt it hurt the wallet I don't know I don't know if that's going to be a sustainable business model all right let's talk about the top or troubles at stern pinball now there's not really troubles

[14:56] but it is hard for people to find toppers that they want if you want to ghost busters or kiss top or good luck you're going to be putting up wanted ads on pin side and end up paying way more than those things were when they were new I think

[15:12] stern has stopped making either one of those so what does that mean does that mean Stern should start vault

[15:18] additioning the toppers to the games maybe they should make a probably make a limited rerun of those toppers and charge even more

[15:27] where is the Star Wars top right I don't think why don't they just come out and say it's never happening can they just do that it's never happening

[15:34] all right what's happening in the world of spooky spooky pinball Alice Cooper nightmare castle continues to be streamed and people are having fun with the game there is one issue that I wanted to talk about I haven't

[15:48] experienced this but I was just reading in the thread that there's a monster issue in which the ball this is crazy the ball will fall below the play field and into the cabinet

[16:01] now I think that's happening in an area the play field where like there's the monster mech that's crazy I've never seen that before where ball can actually fall into the cabinet of the game requiring the player to lift the play field to retrieve the ball

[16:17] so I think people are wondering can that be fixed with software or is that a physical problem with the design of the game that they will have to address but that's really the only issue I've seen on this game

[16:30] there was an interesting question posed in the Alice Cooper nightmare castle thread and that was does Alice Cooper's nightmare castle have the best upper play field of all time what do you think the best upper play field of all time now now look I think a lot of games that have upper play fields the upper play field experience is pretty bad usually upper play fields slow down the play of the game

[16:58] usually what's up there is not very you know exciting it it it sort of you know again like it it just takes away from the flow of the game but when an upper play field is done well I do think it adds another dynamic level to the game play

[17:15] and there are some amazing upper play field experiences let's let's not fool ourselves and I also think that when you have an upper play field it visually is very attractive to walk up to a game where you see an upper play field because you know on a very simple level you just you want to get up there you want to get up and see what it's like to flip the game on a different level so does Alice Cooper have the best upper play field of all time I would say probably not but let's list some upper play fields and then give our assesses

[17:44] and give our assessment of what we think the best is the one I see time and time again is the Simpsons pinball party I think people love that upper play field I think locking the ball up there is awesome the couch shot is awesome so you know getting up there through the garage door is awesome lots of lots of love for the Simpsons pinball party upper play field you know the world poker tournament upper play field you know that has three standups one lock you know one

[18:14] for exit hurry up one for the skillshot and there's two ways to get up there so a lot of people think that is an awesome upper play field

[18:21] a twilight zone obviously twilight and we have to talk about that upper play field you've got the magnetic you know sort of ball control flipping power with the magnets is really cool the shadow upper play field is awesome this one is just like another level of upper play field bonsai run right that's an upper play field the entire back box is an upper play field

[18:43] white waters upper play field is really really cool I mean it's small but it's fast and it feeds for different ramps right how cool is that I mean I love white water as in general white water is one of the greatest world under glass games ever I would love for someone like lime and sheets to get his hands

[19:03] and do a code for a game like that and give that kind of game even more depth because it's so awesome right what about the big Lebowski is it is a two painful to talk about that upper play field in which you bash the wall or in the car comes out and you bash the car is that is it is a two painful it might be family guy what about the stewies like pinball mini pinball game pretty cool right

[19:28] but I will have to say you know there's a lot of cool ones people mentioned wizard of us if you were to ask me you know in 2019 the coolest upper play field though just just and again I it's one of the newer ones but I do think that the coolest upper play field I I've seen is the pirate the Caribbean rocking ship in Jersey Jack pinballs pirate the Caribbean I mean that upper play field is just kind of incredible it's it's just so visually awesome to look at it's got a cannon shot

[19:57] which is awesome it rocks back and forth it's just super cool I haven't seen an upper play field that amazing in any other game I mean the other ones are neat but that one is just something very special when it rocks back and forth like a ship really cool all right let's talk about Jersey Jack pinball

[20:18] because there is some news in the Jersey Jack world I want to break for you guys and so this this news again where does this news come from I'll tell you where this news comes from this comes from people talk to Jack at shows and Jack tells people stuff and so then those people tell me now I don't have the source for you but I have the information you're going to want to know about so here's the news when Jack said on the flipping out stream last week that they are going to reveal another game

[20:48] before the year is over I don't think he's lying I think that is going to be the case but here are the details on that and you can take this to pinside other pinball podcasters you are free to use this information guns and roses is coming out it will be revealed in December

[21:06] and it will ship to customers starting in January so there you have it there will not be guns and roses at expo there will not be guns and roses in October November but December we will see guns and roses revealed I think that's a smart move to wait until then I think that gives them many many months in which to sell Willy Wonka's and keep the spotlight on Willy Wonka all right so that that's that's what's going to happen

[21:36] guns and roses in December now Jersey Jack is still made a mistake we should not know about guns and roses we shouldn't know about it we should not know about toy story knowing this information does significantly hurt them it doesn't help them sell more Willy Wonka's it hurts them sell more more Willy Wonka's even Jack saying we we might remake pirates right what's the letter after Q are like even him saying that it just makes no sense

[22:06] like keep the focus on the game that's available only hype and get people excited about the stuff they can buy now I wouldn't even talk about guns and roses that shows but Jack does and here's the other thing he said and this is again this is coming right from Jack's mouth into a customer's ears onto the air waves now and now it's out there so Jack really wanted a song in guns and roses pinball machine and that song is living let that

[22:36] okay now to get live and let die Jack was working with Paul McCartney and trying to figure out how you know how much it would be to work with the Paul McCartney estate to get live and let die and he wasn't having any success at all getting the song okay because it's expensive but the good news for Jack is this and this is the good news for all of us

[22:58] that someone who goes by the name of slash is working with Jersey Jack pinball on this game and slash is a big pinball fan we know this and so slash calls up Paul McCartney and then all of a sudden live and let dies going to be in the game and they got the rights to it and that's amazing and I think this game is going to have a level of integration and support from guns and roses that is going to make it truly special you know even having personalized call out from slash

[23:28] is going to be awesome I don't think Axel will contribute anything to this pin now I doubt they won't get Axel to do anything that's okay we get slash you know the other huge member of guns and roses maybe

[23:40] double do something with it with the game as well okay so there you have it now speaking of pirates of the Caribbean there are some amazing mods out there if you have this game if you're one of the lucky 1000 I am surprised at the sheer volume of mods that are being

[23:58] made for a game in which there are very few owners right if you make a mod and you spend hours making a mod for this game you've only got a thousand people that are potential buyers but I'll say this the mod that are being made everyone's going to buy everyone so and there's this guy out there I need to give

[24:16] him a shout out is he goes by Harry Houdini on Pinside and he's making some of the coolest mods I mean he's making this star map mod that creates the starry night that goes

[24:27] across the entire back of the game it looks incredible he's working on the opening and closing of the treasure chest which now has two different versions of that mod that work super awesome he has apron decals that are highly

[24:42] improved over the ones that Jack shipped with the game he's now working on a whirlpool you know the maelstrom on a lighting effect for that that makes it the lights go up and down as if it's like

[24:52] flowing water I mean it's it's kind of incredible the the the mod communities support for pirates of the Caribbean super super cool game if you're into modding I mean the world keeps popping more and more with what these guys are doing in the game

[25:07] all right speaking of Jersey Jack to and then want to move on to Wonka is there is a hobbit for sale a hobbit standard for fifty seven hundred dollars right that's insane like go somebody go buy this game if you search for

[25:21] games for sale hobbit standard fifty seven ninety nine is the price wow cheaper than see that's a thing it's like there's more I see so many dialed in

[25:31] L.E.s now for seventy five hundred bucks like that's incredible you know we talk about how will he walk a standard edition is seven

[25:39] five hundred dollars but let's be honest you can go get every single L.E. of Wizard of Oz and dialed in now for seventy five hundred

[25:45] bucks it's a buyer's market and that's a good time to be in pinball all right so will you want to they're going to stream this game a lot

[25:54] let me go let me go first and read this commentary that I that I saw my on my soundcloud page so someone wrote a comment in response to

[26:04] Derek's streaming of willy wonka and Derek's conversation on the show about willy wonka I want to read what he wrote he said sorry Chris this is from

[26:12] Stetson sorry Chris but this guy Derek he's both his name Derek Derek sounds like a complete

[26:20] shill for Jersey Jack pinball he's a fan boy if there ever was one it's hard to take what he says because he slurps anything

[26:28] J.J.P. he did the same thing for pirates of the Caribbean it's like an interview with Ronald McDonald about how good is a big

[26:36] Mac his review is not one that gives us real perspective since it obviously willy wonka does no wrong review does he work for J.J.P.

[26:46] incredible he would buy anything J.J.P. and will report it's the greatest even with all the real world problems and issues

[26:54] okay so here's here's here's Derek's response to that he says hey Stetson thanks for your thoughts I'm going to have to go ahead

[27:01] and disagree with you here first I don't work for J.J.P. you know so absolutely seven months later my wife and I still play

[27:10] pirates of the Caribbean daily and that's not an exaggeration ask any other pirates of the Caribbean owner how they feel about the

[27:16] machine it's just a great game full stop as for wonka this game you have this is the game you have got to spend time on to appreciate

[27:25] there is a learning curve and it takes time to overcome all right they go back and forth on it so okay and then Stetson says willy wonka is missing so much from the movie

[27:36] as it was it is a deal breaker if it had the feeling of playing the beloved movie with the actual music and not the redone music album mess that there is now I'd

[27:46] feel differently past geometry is stellar for sure but not enough to make up for all the other misgivings of willy wonka willy wonka is no pirate to the Caribbean and not even close in fact

[27:59] it would rank at the bottom of all five offerings from Jersey deck pinball Chris said it was reported to him that willy wonka is doneish so there appears no hope for this title

[28:11] all right so here's a thing here's a thing and and I said in my last podcast that there is a glimmer of hope in which joke hats will listen to what we're saying and Jersey Jack pinball will listen to what we're saying

[28:26] why can we have willy wonka give us the kind of clip we want in the in the wonka Vader scene but not in any other clips in the game why is there no audio with video sync

[28:38] of I and again I know I beat on this drum I know I harp on this issue and I'll tell you why because I want them to fix this and if we see it in one scene of the game

[28:48] why can't we see it in other scenes of the game and I do agree I will always agree that fans of willy wonka will walk away from the way this game has been integrated

[29:00] theme wise they will walk away disappointed I there is no way that I can look at this game and say that was the best way to approach the code of willy wonka there's no way there's no way this this this was not the best way to approach it

[29:14] and you know the thing that when Derek talks about the game and this this this is just how I feel when he talks about it there should not be and let me let me say this slowly there should not be a significant learning curve in how to

[29:29] appreciate a willy wonka pinball machine that to me that is just ridiculous when he talked about there's like you know you it's learned it's like learned to the game like you have to like spend time with it to understand the intuitive nature of the game that that's the complete opposite of what

[29:49] an intuitive experience is right a pinball machine that's intuitive doesn't require a steep learning curve you walk up to a tails of the Arabian nights and I just shoot the genie and something happens right I shoot sparking metallic as something happens you know I shoot slimer something happens there should not be

[30:08] a learned intuitive curve to a game it makes no sense and again it what makes no sense to me on this game in that in that approach is the whole point of this game

[30:19] was to make a game for location play in which people would have immediate fun and and know what to do without knowing what to do because it was just intuitive and now we're hearing like actually it's a lot more complex to that than that if you want to understand how to play the game

[30:34] and then I'm like oh my god like once again as Jersey Jack like really made it difficult to figure out like how to jump in and enjoying a game you know I do I compare lots of Batman it's a magical game it's so easy to understand and explain people what to do in the game and is willy walk a going to be that easy I don't know I don't know

[30:54] but I just hope they listen and I hope they fixed the code because it needs fixing I when they say it's done it if this is done done then I don't think people are going to be that happy with with the way the code is I don't and I think joke at and Jack and company need to need to address some things and I think they can right

[31:12] so speaking of that here's where you should go here's where you should go tomorrow night if you want to talk to the very man who coded this game there is a stream happening tomorrow night

[31:23] on flipping out Twitch stream and now this is the greatest I think night you can have with pinball fans and and the fact that Zach and Ken and Bill and you know the special one like guys they are going to have here's where they're going to have Joe Katz who is the willy walk a lead programmer

[31:43] and they were going to have Keith Johnson and Eric as well they're going to have Jersey Jack's like Triome Veren streaming willy walk a tomorrow night on their Twitch channel

[31:54] now if you're trying to find out how to get to this just go to twitch.tv backslash flip the letter N and then out pinball flip and out pinball

[32:06] it's taking place tomorrow at eight o'clock central top no sorry I think it's eight o'clock eastern standard time seven central time okay now look they're also going to have that you know they do the stream and then they have the channel of chatting going on so you can ask them questions and believe me I've been I was there last week it's so much fun and and they do they get to every question that people are asking in the chat there's nowhere to hide because then after they do the stream there's a call in the stream

[32:35] there's a call in segment so you can call in live and these gentlemen will be there and they have to address your question so I would join that if you can and ask them like what's the status of the game now now that we've seen the walk a Vater clip I want to know that's my one question for Joe Katz and I will ask it on month tomorrow night Joe can you do more this in the game can you add all of those scenes that we've seen

[33:04] see that are in the game without voice can you add the voice that like why can't they just answer that simple question we still don't get a direct answer when we ask that and I don't

[33:16] I told Ken at special one lit I'm like Ken like ask the question and he asks it up Jack but you can't ask it in a round about what you can't because if you just ask like are we going to see more

[33:27] asset integration you know you just get this broad answer like you know we have we ever shipped a game that's fully done when it ships like more is to come I don't want that kind of like broadness I want very specific question

[33:41] will we get more scenes like the walk a Vater coded into the game yes or no yes or no these muted scenes will they have voice I know I'm getting repeated here because I'm trying to drill it into

[33:52] everyone's heads that's what we need to ask Jersey Jack we need to pressure them to put this in the game they're listening to us this game needs that I'm telling you it needs it I'm not buying it that it's all that the way the game is now is like the way it should be no it needs to be

[34:10] no it needs that in the game all right okay gosh I'm getting heated here getting heated there there was a question that was will Jersey Jack pinball survived 2020 did you see this question these questions are stupid

[34:24] I see these go up on the inside will they survive 2020 look Jack's got three juggernaut themes will you want a toy story and guns or roses and I've always said it if they if they just don't mess up the games

[34:38] these themes are hugely popular themes I see a lot of back and forth with the guns and roses popularity it's popular they are popular they're going to sell a lot of guns and roses I will say there is criticism that Jersey Jack is not making original titles with games like the

[34:57] Hobbit which is Jack trying to make a better version of Lord of the Rings and guns and roses a game that's already been out because if you think about it we've never seen I don't think we've seen two other than kids right we haven't really seen anyone go back

[35:13] and make another band you know a game another band game that's already been done before so this is like the second guns and roses pin I think it's an honor to be guns and roses to have that but you know is

[35:25] Jack going back to a well that's already been satiated and that there already is a great guns and roses pinball machine and we don't need another one so I you know I understand that criticism like do something original but it is what it is like if they have a relationship with slash and they can do this game the right way

[35:41] and Eric's going to you know put a lot of awesome stuff into it the challenge I think for Eric is simply the the G and R ramps from the original game are so awesome that how do you like top that I'm curious to see what they do

[35:54] all right all right so what else is going on in the pinball world I think that's kind of it for episode 360 seven of Canadian pinball podcasts I hope you guys all had a great fourth of July weekend and look look we are waiting to see what comes from Stern

[36:12] deep route you know again the deep route thread it just won't stop it if you're on pin side the back and forth on the deep route thread is just it's really interesting to me because you know to get back to the beginning joke I had on this show and that was that this guy that is really know you know just some nobody random dude you know mister moberg is leaving pin side you know he gives his reasons why is leaving and it's it's a kind of a

[36:42] combination of you know someone in the family's not feeling well he got into a dramatic back and forth with someone on pin side that upset him and you know I think people need to realize this and this is just the reality of all internet forums they are what you make them okay

[37:02] inside is what you make it you can go looking for the drama you can go and create drama or you could go there and you know use it for good reasons and you could go there for the good stuff

[37:18] if you could also control the amount of time you spend on it because only the people that spend too much time on pin side have to create threads in which they dramatically announce they're leaving you know you get addicted to it

[37:32] and we all know too though he'll be back because the whole reason of creating a thread like that is to go back on and read what people's comments are about your exit

[37:41] I think he'll read that people don't give a damn that he's leaving who cares?

[37:45] You know, and I think

[37:47] The best way to do it is if people upset you on there just drain them

[37:51] You don't have to listen to them if threads are annoying you just drain them

[37:56] Pinside has provided all the tools necessary to sort of block out the people that you can't stand

[38:03] So just do that, but it never ceases to amaze me that people fall victim and

[38:08] Have to engage the people they can't stand and you know, it so takes two to tango on there

[38:13] So you know, Pinside is a great resource. Let's not fool ourselves. It creates a great

[38:19] Depository where all the information and troubleshooting and mods and all these great things are being discussed and the club threads are all awesome and the unboxing threads are awesome

[38:29] I do wish they would moderate a little bit more and condense some of the threads

[38:33] So there's not so many like we you shouldn't allow like if if some clown puts up a thread

[38:39] It's like I'm leaving Pinside and he's a nobody just they should just delete that

[38:43] Why does some nobody get to put up this explanation of why he's leaving? All right, stupid. It's stupid

[38:51] You know, it's come you know because you want the threads to be somewhat like newsworthy and interesting and and have some reason for being

[38:58] All right, but anyway look to free world can do what you want

[39:02] No one really cares. That's the ultimate thing nobody cares like nobody cares if vid's gone if I'm gone if you're gone

[39:09] It's all the bunch of nonsense online forums are dumpster fires for the most part nobody cares

[39:16] We're all just there to get a good laugh to get some entertainment if anyone takes this too seriously if you burn out on pinball

[39:24] Well, you you did something wrong like whether you're a pinball podcast or whether you're a form user or whether you're a player

[39:30] If you get to the point where you can't stand it anymore where you got to like completely extracted from your life you went overboard

[39:37] Create balance people balance

[39:41] All right work and again, I said this work out eat healthy so much more important than any of this pinball garbage

[39:49] It is and I'm gonna call it garbage help is so much more important than all this stuff

[39:53] You know, we should have a thread on Pinside

[39:56] Or the foreign after thread 90 days you do P90 X for 90 days and you eat healthy

[40:02] There should be a thread that's like you know

[40:04] I worked out and I transformed my life and then you'll be a better pinball player

[40:09] I'm sure your reaction time will improve anyway. I'm not gonna get too preachy everyone have a great day

[40:14] We'll talk to you soon. This has been episode 367 of Canate's pinball podcast. I'm out

[40:25] You

[40:44] You just saved the world

[40:46] Gosh, I miss you Dusty bun. Yeah, I miss you more. She's the poop. I miss you more multiplied by all the stars in our galaxy

[40:52] No, I need you no

[40:56] so
