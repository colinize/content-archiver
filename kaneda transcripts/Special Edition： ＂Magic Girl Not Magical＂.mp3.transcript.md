[00:00] NO!

[00:04] What you just heard is going to be the sound from 25 Magigirl owners soon to be.

[00:22] I'm whispering because it's 6 o'clock in the morning here and Brenda's sleeping and Bubba's sleeping

[00:28] and we had an amazing night at the Red Hat Chili Peppers Concert. I'm about to go to cars and coffee

[00:34] in a little bit but I can't not report this to you guys out there.

[00:40] Here's the deal. Magigirl doesn't work. I'm just going to come out and say it.

[00:48] The early reports about the game are that nothing on the machine actually works.

[00:54] That it is pretty much the same exact machine that Bill and the Pintage accrue showed us over a year ago.

[01:04] Which really is frustrating. I don't have mine yet. I don't have it. I can't play it.

[01:12] But what I know is that it is not this amazing Magigirl experience.

[01:20] It sounds as if there is hardly any magic going on in the game whatsoever.

[01:24] The ball gets hung up. The plunging doesn't even work properly.

[01:32] I'm laughing. I'm looking at this whole thing with the attitude of this is John's final eff you to everybody.

[01:44] All the people moaning and groaning and crying about the value of these machines and suing and forcing J-pop into bankruptcy.

[01:52] There's nothing here. I think I said to you guys multiple times that I went in on this expecting to get a piece of artwork.

[02:02] That is what I will get out of it. Am I upset that I went in and bought a Magigirl knowing that it doesn't really work?

[02:10] I tell you I'm not. I knew about this before even going to the Chili Peppers concert.

[02:16] And Brenda and I were sort of laughing in the cab or like you know it's actually kind of fitting that this is what everyone will get.

[02:24] It doesn't change the fact that it's still a conversation piece. It doesn't change the fact that it's still one of the most beautiful pinball machines ever made.

[02:36] I think it's fitting that John Papa Duke has given the world the most beautiful pinball machine ever created.

[02:44] It doesn't even function as a pinball machine. It's sort of like here it is. But do you want to play it? You can't.

[02:52] It's so weird. It's like ironic in that way that even if it's physically in front of you you still can't play it.

[03:01] You still can't experience what was in his mind and what he was thinking of.

[03:07] I do think this is very unfortunate for my friends over to American pinball because for them to be writing letters and boasting about how they did it and they finished Magigirl and it's done.

[03:22] That dream has been realized by them. I don't know. I have a really I'm kind of like really I'm upset and I'm empathetic at the same time because I think that did these guys even play Magic Girl.

[03:36] Why would you say you did it? You built it. If you screw a car together that doesn't even work that doesn't even go mile.

[03:44] Why are you really going to take credit for being a manufacturer of that car? I think they also deserve some of the blame.

[03:52] I feel sorry for them because they also got duped. They got duped like everybody else. They saw the beautiful work of art that John had created.

[04:03] That looked like a pinball machine. You got to remember this game is like John's Trojan horse because it looks like a pinball machine because it has legs on it and because it's so gorgeous.

[04:14] He's able to roll that thing in and take everyone's money and defeat them in a way. It's such a Trojan horse.

[04:24] That is what's going on right now. I don't know what the outcome is going to be. I know that people have calls into John to try and figure out what the fuck is going on here.

[04:38] It's going to be interesting to see if the coder can actually help fix what the issues are. I don't know what the outcome will be but I just want to report here on Canadian pinball podcast.

[04:53] This news because no one's talking about it. People are still talking about the lawsuits. I see a coin taker put up one for sale on Facebook and I think everyone needs to know.

[05:04] I think this is not a time to sort of hide behind John's art and zombie at his beautiful mish creation anymore. I think people should be told the truth.

[05:14] This is coming from a guy who's in on one. I mean, I was telling Brenda to. I'm like, oh, it's going to be so funny now because everyone's going to be like, haha, told you so.

[05:27] I'm really not like disappointed. I really do. I just I'm happy to be getting anything over the last six months. I've been so frustrated that I would get nothing.

[05:42] I know the rest of the owners are just happy to have anything physical in their possession. In terms of possible at possible outcomes, I'm not sure what the future holds.

[05:53] But it would be cool if someone actually redesigns the game and is able to slot in and you play field using John's parts.

[06:03] Will someone go through all that time and effort? Is it a simple coding issue? Or will this just be the most beautiful box of lights ever? It is as a zombie Eddie has said to me many times. Did John just sell you a coffee table?

[06:19] I think he did. Maybe I'd take the legs off it and eat dinner on it with Brenda. But that's it. I'm about to go fire up the hellcat and drive to cars and coffee in a few minutes. But I just want to let you guys know.

[06:33] This whole thing has been a terrible journey for everyone involved. I think ultimately we can all walk away and say to ourselves, nobody's going to win here. No one's winning.

[06:47] People getting physical machines, people not getting razzas, people not getting Alice in Wonderland. Everyone I think is about to get F by J. Pop. Like we're all going to lose. Like nobody comes out of this situation.

[07:02] Nobody feels good. Nobody. And it's the ultimate fitting end, I think, to this whole fiasco. And we have nobody to blame. But John, I hope people, I don't blame the person who sold me their machine. I don't blame anybody. I don't blame American pinball. I don't blame anybody.

[07:25] It is the man standing next to that machine who's to blame. If he designed a game that didn't function properly, he had an entire year with American pinball to sit down and say, let me just make it simple. Let me just make it work. Let me take away all this stuff.

[07:45] You know, it's like you got to just blame John. There's just nobody else to blame. And I feel bad for Chris Acointick. I feel bad for Bill Brandt. I feel bad for everybody who put their faith in this man multiple times and thought that it would actually end on a positive note.

[08:02] But I do think there's a silver lining here and I do walk away from this feeling like the silver lining is that John Papadoug will go down in history as the reason why nobody should really pre-order something before they play it.

[08:20] The magic roll will always be the symbol of what can happen if you go in and you buy a machine before you flip it.

[08:29] So I think that's an important lesson. And look, I've said it. I still think it's a crazy work of art and I'm happy to have it and the story. It contains as part of my pinball collection.

[08:44] Now I also told Brandt I'm like, this machine is like the coolest thing to have for your collection. But it's not really cool to have if your collection consists of just one pinball machine in your apartment because you can't play it.

[08:59] So it's not good for me on that front. You know, I'm not one of these guys who has like 15 or 20 pins and then magic girls there and people like, oh my god, you actually have a magic girl.

[09:09] I don't even want to discuss pricing or value or whatnot. I think it's still uncertain like what this thing is worth.

[09:17] I honestly don't think it hurts to value that much that it doesn't flip. I still think they're now going to become even more rare pieces of artwork.

[09:26] You know, now it's like it's not even a pinball machine. It's like we're sort of bidding on the rarest piece of pinball artwork. It's sort of interesting. Like nothing like this has ever happened before.

[09:40] I say it in a, I might sound a little jovial because I just think it's funny. I think it's just so ironic that people are going to have nothing but a blinking box of lights.

[09:51] And you know, that's it. That's it. One man is to blame. One man is responsible for all this. And it's really a shame.

[10:03] The other part that I just can't get over over. I was just thinking about this too this morning is who put together that feature list.

[10:11] Like if that feature list exists, like if you guys read the magic girl, these are the features. And none of those features work.

[10:19] Then I really have to ask like I think John might be certifiably crazy. I think he might be certifiably insane if he wrote that feature list knowing that none of those features functioned.

[10:31] And maybe all this is, you know, I don't know. Maybe this was a joke. He locked the code in in a way that didn't work because he wasn't happy. He had to send it out. Maybe the code or kind of lock it. I don't know. I don't know.

[10:45] I do know this. This story is not over. I do know that there's going to be a lot of questions today. I know this news is going to hit.

[10:53] It's like a ton of bricks. And I have to put this up. I mean you guys deserve it. I told a coin taker I'd wait for him to hear from John.

[11:04] And like what's the point? Like what's John going to say to coin taker today that's going to make any difference?

[11:09] I pick up my machine on Monday from Chris. And that's that. That's that.

[11:15] Magic girl. As is right now. Doesn't function. It's like it's like I feel like mega try to I still function.

[11:24] I don't know. That doesn't make sense. I don't know. I'm going to go fire up the hell cat. And I'm going to just laugh my ass off as I burn down the highway in it.

[11:33] Remembering that like you know what? This is where true fun is for me like automotive like pinball. It's been nothing but a rocky road.

[11:42] And I just want to say something to for a lot of you guys calling me special K and a lot of you guys you know saying I shouldn't be back on pin sight.

[11:52] I don't really I don't really care guys. I mean look I always told Robin from the very get go when he banned me. I was like look I know I it's more beneficial if I'm on there and I won't do the count again.

[12:06] I won't do what I did before and he you know he doesn't want to accept that and like I've had some drunk in moments.

[12:13] And I've had some idiotic things I've done and I've you know a lot of a lot of this hobby can bring out the best enough in us and a lot of this hobby can bring up the worst in us.

[12:24] I think we all can relate to that. You know actually when I was talking to iceman on Friday we got in the heated Texas exchange about magic girl.

[12:34] But we ended up being like look bro like we'll just share some beers at a T.P.F. like it's all cool you know and I think all this man I think this fucking game is brought out the worst in everybody.

[12:46] And I'm and I'm I'm really leave like I'm just relieved to know like what I'm getting like you're getting it.

[12:53] You know your baby is going to be given to you and it's it's got a lot of problems but it's fine it's fine.

[13:01] I look at this thing again like a work of art that never was going to end up being what we thought it would be you know there wasn't some hail Mary attempt by American pinball they got due to.

[13:15] And I guess I just want to say like I'm tired at six in the morning I want to say just everybody everybody take a step back from this experience and no matter if you got burned by John or if you didn't everyone should learn from this experience everyone should be nicer to everybody else like seriously let's make this be the moment where we all turn a corner and we all come together collectively and raise our.

[13:43] Two middle fingers to John Papa Duke Jr. and say fuck you for putting us through all of this for all these years and then put those middle fingers down turn to the guy to the left turn to the guy to the right and give them a big fucking hug for actually being into pinball like wise snow here's a big fucking hug from canada to you everybody stop fighting each other stop arguing on pinside stop having short fuses and getting impatient like you.

[14:12] Like you guys are like the only people left in the world that actually care about pinball you know when when the word gets out that magic girl doesn't work let me tell you something 99.9% of the world doesn't give a fuck they don't care you guys care so much and and because you guys care so much about pinball you should also care about each other more and and and I say that because I get so much hate and so much victory all.

[14:42] I know people want to dance around a bonfire because canada's magic girl isn't going to be anything more than a blinking box the lights but I'm here to tell you I don't care I don't care I'm happy that it's over it's more satisfying me I'm happy I'm getting something out of it I don't care about the resell value I was never going to sell it I'm still not going to sell it I'm not going to try and pull the fast one and sell it to someone knowing that it doesn't work.

[15:07] It'll be a story it'll be a story the next the next pinball machine I'll buy will be Star Wars from Stern because I know it'll actually work and that's it everybody it's 622 in the morning in New York City on a holiday weekend and can it is pinball podcasts is here to tell you to be nice remember that everyone you're telling the fuck off and argue it they love the same thing you love and no one else knows what you're doing.

[15:37] I don't care about the world out there appreciates it so it's time to come together a little bit right in our darkest moment we need to become allies now against the common foe John Papaduke are you guys catching the transformers that's it I'm going for a ride I love you guys I love that you guys tune into this show every week and you're always going to hear it from me straight you're not going to get spin in Canada's world you know I'm a man who who got burned by j pop too

[16:06] and I'm going to I'm here to tell you that I care more about telling you guys the truth than I do about flipping and making a profit on it and I hope you like respect that because I respect you guys have a great day I love you can it out
