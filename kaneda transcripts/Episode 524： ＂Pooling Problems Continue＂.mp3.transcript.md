[00:00] Don't fall in love with a dreamer

[00:05] Cause you break you at three times

[00:20] Welcome to episode 524 of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:24] And this is my second take on this podcast

[00:27] I already did a show earlier Saturday morning

[00:30] Where I was a little bit like ranting and raving about the play field issues

[00:34] With Jersey Jack's guns and roses

[00:36] And you know I listened to it

[00:38] And I was like you know what Chris like

[00:40] Putting this up is actually not the best way to communicate

[00:43] What you really want to say

[00:45] And what I want you as the listener to take away from this podcast

[00:49] And I want to start off by saying the same thing I did on that show

[00:53] Which is I don't want to do shows like this

[00:56] I don't want to do shows in which we're highlighting a problem in the pinball world that is going to frustrate a lot of pinball buyers

[01:04] I've been so excited with the launch of guns and roses

[01:07] I'm so excited to get my collector's edition of guns and roses

[01:11] And really the only thing that I think could deteriorate my excitement

[01:16] Or start to sort of make me anxious and nervous is quality issues

[01:20] And what I'm seeing right now with this game has me really worried

[01:25] Because I really don't know why we're still here

[01:28] Why we are still seeing photos of people who are showing games in which every single post in the game is pooling

[01:37] And on some of them it's really bad around the slingshot area where the pooling is also chipping away at the artwork

[01:44] And I'm looking at pictures from Helicon Brewery

[01:47] Now they were one of the first people to unbox a guns and roses machine

[01:51] And the first games that go out in the wild it's really important that the quality of those machines is top notch

[01:57] Because Jersey Jack knows that people are going to be looking at these machines

[02:01] And looking at how they're holding up especially games that go on location as an indication of how good the quality is

[02:08] Because if you're Jersey Jack pinball you do have a track record of shipping games that have had playfield issues

[02:16] Right?

[02:17] This isn't like they've never had this before so people are scrutinizing these games early on to make sure the problems were solved

[02:24] Now everyone out there thought the problems were solved when they made Willy Wonka Collector's Edition

[02:30] Willy Wonka initially had clear coat pooling and chipping issues

[02:34] They hit pause and apparently they solved the problem on the Collector's editions

[02:39] So it's really confusing to me why we're still seeing some of these issues pop up again

[02:44] I mean these games are looking as bad as the pirates of the Caribbean games that were pooling really badly

[02:49] So that's the first thing that just goes through my head is how are we back to this situation again?

[02:55] And how did a company that apparently solved the problem with Mirko how are they now seeing customers share games that look like this?

[03:03] So after I did my ranting and raving show I was talking to some member of the pinball medium not gonna name names

[03:09] And he was set up to interview Mirko, okay? He was about to talk to Mirko about pinball

[03:16] You want to know what Mirko said to him?

[03:18] Mirko said that he won't talk about playfield issues

[03:22] He won't address any questions that have to do with playfield quality

[03:27] Let me repeat that

[03:28] The guy that's making the playfields for Jersey Jack Pinball is refusing to talk to people who have questions about the issues of the products he's making

[03:38] And when I heard that I kind of just like shrugged my shoulders and I sort of mentally just felt really defeated

[03:45] And kind of gave up a little bit on this hobby that we have a vendor who's not even comfortable talking about his products and won't stand behind his products

[03:54] And when I heard that I just felt defeated I feel like we're spending so much money on these games

[03:59] And if that's his attitude and if that's his positioning around all of this

[04:04] It really makes me feel like I don't want to support a company that has that point of view

[04:09] That thinks they can just go radio silent when their products are experiencing issues and he refuses to address it

[04:17] And so you know it's like whose fault is it right?

[04:19] Is it Mirko's? Is it Jersey Jack?

[04:21] How many chances is it Jersey Jack Pinball going to give Mirko playfields?

[04:25] We've seen issues now on dialed in

[04:28] We've seen issues on pirates of the Caribbean

[04:30] We've seen issues on Willy Wonka and now we're seeing issues on guns and roses

[04:35] So how many strikes before Mirko is out?

[04:38] And are they to blame?

[04:40] What's the solution?

[04:41] Why is it that spooky pinball has solved the problem?

[04:44] Why is it that Chicago gaming company doesn't have this problem?

[04:47] Why is it that American pinball doesn't have this problem?

[04:50] We're really just seeing bad playfields from Stern and Jersey Jack Pinball

[04:55] But Jersey Jack's issues are worse than Stern's issues they are

[04:59] And get that Stern's crater and Stern's playfields are not good quality

[05:03] Don't get me wrong

[05:04] But they obviously figured out how to get rid of the pooling around the post

[05:08] The fact that we're still seeing pooling around the post on a Jersey Jack machine in 2020

[05:13] Really concerning

[05:14] Really concerning

[05:15] And so you know what makes me want to ask even more questions like where do we go now?

[05:19] Like what's the solution from this?

[05:21] These people who have these LEDs that have these problems

[05:24] Like what do you do for them now?

[05:26] Do you send them out new playfields?

[05:28] Are you going to send them fully populated playfields?

[05:31] We know they're not going to do that

[05:33] And then the questions of non-refundable deposits

[05:36] This is the part that really stings right?

[05:38] They're taking non-refundable deposits

[05:40] So if you gave a deposit on a game, it's not refundable

[05:44] And you're seeing the games have quality issues

[05:47] Is it fair that you're locked in now and you can't get your money back?

[05:50] If you're not happy with the quality of the game?

[05:53] And this is the only chance we get to see the quality

[05:55] Are the first machines that Jersey Jack is sending out into the wild

[05:59] I feel bad, I really do feel bad for everyone over at Jersey Jack Pimball right now

[06:03] Because Eric designed a masterpiece

[06:06] Slash and him made the most amazing masterpiece I've ever seen in Pimball

[06:10] I really, I mean it

[06:11] It's a Pimball experience like no other

[06:13] And I don't want that experience to be jeopardized because of Miracles playfield qualities

[06:18] I feel really bad for Ken and all the people that put together the most amazing launch in the history of Pimball

[06:24] Only to have this now become the focal point and the conversation

[06:28] Right? I really feel bad for all the men and women who are working on that assembly line

[06:33] Who are screwing these games together, who are working really hard to make these games as good as possible

[06:38] Because if the defect is in the playfield and the defect is on Miracles in

[06:44] Then he's handing these ladies and gentlemen a product that is defective

[06:48] And there's nothing they can do on the assembly line to fix the problems that are happening over in Germany

[06:53] And I don't know how you don't draw the conclusion that Miracle is the problem

[06:58] That it's his problem to solve and he continues to mess this up

[07:03] And his spectrum process of making playfields, it's just not working, it's not good enough

[07:08] If it was working, we wouldn't be seeing these issues

[07:11] Right? And then there's even more questions around when were these games made?

[07:15] I'm seeing people share images of games that were made in July of 2019

[07:20] I'm not sure if that's the playfield was made then, the game certainly was not made in July

[07:26] These were not made back in New Jersey, was it just the cabinets that were put together back in New Jersey that they sent over to Chicago?

[07:34] You know, so if you've got people locked in and then the question becomes, what do you do about the collector's editions?

[07:40] Right? The premium versions of the game, the $12,500 versions, all of which are bought by collectors

[07:47] And collectors are OCD and they don't want their games to fall apart

[07:51] They don't want their games to have pooling and chipping

[07:53] They don't want washers as a solve because it's not a solve

[07:58] We've seen when the washers have been put on before

[08:01] It's not just washers you need, you need the thicker starpost

[08:04] But it's not really a solve

[08:06] Like what that's trying to do, it's trying to prevent what the game itself is trying to do

[08:12] Right? A bad, clear game wants to pool

[08:15] Like it wants to start to separate from the artwork, it wants to start to bubble up and crack

[08:20] Like that's what happens when you apply pressure to a game that doesn't have the right clear code on it, right?

[08:26] And so you're just trying to prevent the inevitable

[08:29] But the inevitable will happen

[08:31] It will happen, I mean I'm seeing pictures of people who are sharing older games from Jersey Jack

[08:37] Where they have the washers underneath and you still see it pooling

[08:40] So I just think that this is a really sad thing to talk about, it's a deflating thing to cover

[08:46] And the more and more we're seeing of these photos

[08:49] Leads me to believe that it's a problem that is going to appear on many machines, not just a few

[08:55] But if it was just a few and if it was just a small batch of them and they fixed the problem

[09:00] Well that's when Jersey Jack needs to communicate that

[09:03] That hey, pinball community, we found a bunch of games that were early on in production

[09:08] That have a clear code problem, we are fixing the problem on all future games

[09:13] And for those of you who are impacted by this, we are going to work with you one-on-one to figure out a solution for you

[09:19] And something like that would just add a lot of confidence for those of us who are still waiting on our games

[09:25] And here's the thing, they've only made maybe 200 games at most

[09:28] So they've got less than 10% of potential owners have product

[09:34] So now would be a good time to communicate to us and just let us know like what's going on

[09:39] And I don't think they're going to do that, I think they're still going to be using their social media channels to sell more product

[09:45] Part of me gets nervous when I see that, it's like you've got this masterpiece and you want to sell it

[09:50] And people are going to buy it, but the more money keeps coming in, you need to fix the problem though

[09:56] You know, it's like leaking water, these clear code issues, it's like leaking water in a house

[10:00] And if water keeps leaking, it could destroy your entire foundation

[10:04] And I don't mean to be over dramatic, but if Jersey Jack Pimbal continues to have these quality issues

[10:10] It is like leaking water and it can destroy the company

[10:14] If they lose consumer confidence, you know, it's not a good thing

[10:18] And Eric works so hard and can work hard on the launch and slash and Eric made a masterpiece and Leonard has pumped a lot of money into this company

[10:26] And it just feels like there shouldn't be any more excuses like we shouldn't see this anymore

[10:32] I'm just tired of seeing it and I don't think there's any more excuses and I get really annoyed when Mirko refuses to comment

[10:40] And I just think that that's a cop out and I think he needs to be held accountable for the products that he's shipping to Chicago

[10:47] That are then going to make their way into our homes

[10:49] And I don't need to rant and rave, I don't need to scream about that

[10:53] That's the most level headed way for me to say it and I think it's more impactful for me to say it in a way that's a little bit more mature

[10:59] Then flying off the handle

[11:01] Now as a consumer, what would I do?

[11:03] I think as a consumer, you've got nothing else you can do other than wait and see

[11:08] I would not feel confident unboxing a game right now

[11:11] I mean if it had washers on it and I opened up my GNR this week and there were washers under all the posts

[11:18] I don't know how I would feel, I would feel a little bit nervous like I'm waiting for the problem to develop

[11:24] And I don't think people want that because again like it's just a bandaid

[11:28] Because without those washers it leads me to believe that these games would all start to pull up

[11:34] And that that is a cheap solution to a much bigger problem

[11:38] So I wouldn't feel good about unboxing a game right now

[11:41] I want to see them figure it out

[11:43] Like they figured it out with Willy Wonka, this is the part that just keeps confusing me

[11:48] How was there a change in process between Wonka's CE and this?

[11:52] I don't understand how that happened

[11:54] We're all in a wait and see period right now with Jersey Jack Pimbal

[11:57] For those of us out there who follow this hobby, the reality is this

[12:01] This company has always had issues

[12:03] They've always had quality issues with their launches, this is nothing new

[12:07] So we probably should have expected this

[12:09] I know we always expect things to keep getting better in Pimbal

[12:13] But the reality has always been the opposite of that

[12:16] The same companies always make the same mistakes

[12:18] They do

[12:19] Typically because they're still using all the same people

[12:22] Like nobody's new, it's the same Pimbal Playfield manufacturer

[12:25] They've got the same Playfield manufacturer that made all those other mistakes

[12:29] So why do we now expect Mirko to solve it?

[12:32] You know Spooky Pimbal, the reason why I admire them

[12:35] Is when Charlie saw the issues he was having with TNA

[12:38] Charlie went and found his solution

[12:41] He went and found a new vendor

[12:43] He went and found a new, I don't know if it was a new vendor

[12:45] But they definitely worked on a new process by which they made the Rick and Morty Playfields

[12:50] That is why Charlie has so much consumer confidence

[12:53] That is why people who are buying Rick and Morty's feel so confident

[12:57] And that's what I admire in Spooky Pimbal is they keep getting better

[13:02] And with Jersey Jack, that's why I'm so frustrated with them

[13:05] Is how have they not solved this problem

[13:08] And how have they not improved and made their Playfields even better?

[13:12] Especially when a small little company inventing Wisconsin without billions of dollars figured it out

[13:17] And that's all I think we want

[13:19] We just want Jersey Jack games to be at the same level and standard as like a Spooky Pimbal game

[13:24] And it should be because it costs much more

[13:27] And that's where we're all at

[13:29] And I don't need to scream about it, I don't need to rant and rave about it

[13:33] I just want to tell you that's how I feel

[13:35] So I thank all of you for listening to Kineas Pimbal Podcast

[13:38] I'm still excited about Guns and Roses

[13:40] But now I'm equally, equally somewhat deflated seeing all of these pictures

[13:45] I'm disappointed in Mirko for avoiding the Pimbal Media and acting as if he doesn't have to comment on this when it's his product

[13:52] Whenever a company will not stand behind their product and talk about it, good or bad

[13:57] When they will not stand behind their product and they try to hide, that is always a warning sign

[14:03] And it also makes us not want to support those kinds of companies

[14:06] And I do think Jersey Jack should say something

[14:08] Even if they want to tell us that they think the washer will be an adequate solution

[14:12] At least get in front of it and tell us that

[14:14] If you think this will solve the problem, then tell us that

[14:18] Don't just make it magically appear in all these games without standing behind it

[14:22] Do you believe this is a solve? I want to hear them say it

[14:25] There's something about saying it and hearing it from these companies that gives us confidence

[14:31] Because I want to know that they're confidently standing behind these solutions

[14:35] And it's like Chuck told me I'll never forget when I asked Chuck, Chuck

[14:39] Do I need to get the cruiseman play field? And he said Chris, I don't think you need to get the cruiseman play field

[14:43] Our play fields are the best in the business and I think you're going to be happy with it

[14:48] And he was right

[14:49] He was right, he saved me $700 and Spooky Pimbal really stands behind their play field

[14:54] And they're play field quality

[14:56] And that's all we want and that's all we're asking of Jersey Jack Pimbal

[15:00] The game is a masterpiece, you're going to love it

[15:03] It is the greatest Pimbal experience I've ever had playing Pimbal

[15:06] Of course I'm a little bit biased because I love guns and roses

[15:09] I can't wait to get my collector's edition

[15:11] This is really early on in a run of a game that's going to have production go on for years

[15:16] And I really think they're at a pivotal point right now

[15:19] Where they need to come up with a solution or at least talk to us about what their solution is

[15:23] And also what went wrong right because we saw what went wrong

[15:26] It's like to not even address that that was problematic

[15:29] Point at that bad play field Jersey Jack, point at that bad play field miracle

[15:34] And just take responsibility and accountability for it

[15:37] Say look, that is not how a play field should hold up after two weeks of ownership

[15:42] That is a problem, that is defective, we're going to fix this

[15:45] That's all we want to hear, it's not too much to ask

[15:48] Okay, automakers do it all the time, other companies do it all the time

[15:52] They come clean when they have an issue and they tell us they're working on a fix

[15:55] And that's all we want to hear

[15:57] Unfortunately, they probably should have done this well before production began

[16:01] They know that we know that but it is what it is

[16:04] We're once again at a Jersey Jack launch in which there's quality issues

[16:08] So I hope they figure it out, can't wait to get my game

[16:11] But this is not the kind of podcasts that I want to do

[16:14] So all we can do is wait and see what they're going to do

[16:17] And if they're going to communicate and tell us what the real solve is

[16:20] Thank you everybody, episode 524

[16:50] Thank you everybody
