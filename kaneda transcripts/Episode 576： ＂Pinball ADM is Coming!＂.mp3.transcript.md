[00:00] Well that fun little affordable hobby known as pinball is it over.

[00:18] Are we seeing sales of games reach a point that is seemingly crazy.

[00:24] Now this is not canada, hyping and pumping and dumping games.

[00:28] These are actual sales of pinball machines.

[00:31] Now I think those of us that just want to ignore these sales are ignoring what's going

[00:37] to come to this industry next and it's happened in other industries.

[00:42] It's happened in other collectible markets that have similar target audiences to pinball

[00:48] and it's what nobody wants to talk about right.

[00:51] Everybody just wants to get on shows and interview designers and artists or podcasters.

[00:57] Everybody wants to do shows and talk about tournaments.

[01:00] Everyone saying the same thing and I'm here to tell you this is to me the biggest thing

[01:06] that's going to sweep over the pinball hobby over the next few years and I think this

[01:11] is going to happen and what I'm talking about are ADMs.

[01:17] I'm going to tell you what an ADM is in a minute but it's happened in the automotive world.

[01:22] It happens in the jewelry world.

[01:25] It happens everywhere.

[01:28] There is more demand than supply for something.

[01:31] But before I do that I'm going to sneak in a little news item and that's the fact that

[01:35] Carl Weathers is doing the callouts for the Mandalorian.

[01:40] Some people are nervous about this because if you think about it does that mean it's going

[01:44] to be only season one and does it mean it's going to be like strange or things in which

[01:49] the sheriff does all the callouts and it's kind of lame.

[01:52] I don't know.

[01:53] I think Carl Weathers is an animated actor and I think him doing the callouts in the Mandalorian.

[01:59] Here's the thing.

[02:00] It's better than him not doing the callouts in the Mandalorian and Stern has to get some

[02:03] like internal person or hire someone to pretend to be Carl Weathers.

[02:07] So Carl Weathers will be doing the callouts in this game.

[02:10] More to come on the Mandalorian in a couple weeks.

[02:12] We've been giving you all the news.

[02:14] Isn't it amazing?

[02:15] Canators pinball podcasts is giving you all the news.

[02:18] You know the other shows said they're the go to source for news.

[02:21] Where are they?

[02:22] Off the air.

[02:23] Tombstone themselves.

[02:24] Okay.

[02:25] So let's talk about ADMs and pinball sales.

[02:27] So I want to talk about the fact that when you have a Pirates of the Caribbean collector's

[02:32] edition sell from a distributor who held it in box.

[02:37] They held it in box.

[02:38] It was their personal game.

[02:40] A distributor sold the Pirates of the Caribbean CE for $38,500.

[02:46] Just the other day Justin Kelly sold his Tron Ellie on eBay for $25,000.

[02:54] His eBay fees were about $1,400.

[02:57] So do the math.

[02:58] He took on a huge chunk of change.

[03:01] Mr. Bill Brandis just sold his Tron Ellie and his Rick and Morty.

[03:06] It wasn't even a butter edition.

[03:08] He sold those two games for $32,000 US dollars to a buyer.

[03:14] So you can't ignore what's happening in pinball right now.

[03:18] A fathom by Haggis pinball.

[03:21] Even though I love what they're doing is $9,000 for a fathom top of the line.

[03:26] A spooky pinball with all the bells and whistles cost me with tax around $9800.

[03:34] Now when I sold my spooky pinball game I got $11,000 for it.

[03:38] I heard an Elvira signature edition sold in Australia for $35,000.

[03:45] I don't even know what that adds.

[03:46] I think it's like $25K or something.

[03:48] If I had waited and sold my Batman SLE this year I bet we're looking at $25K to $30,000

[03:55] for it.

[03:56] Is this an anomaly or why does this keep happening over and over and over again?

[04:00] Now we could sit in the corner and say those people who buy those machines are idiots

[04:05] and they're not indicative of where this hobby is going but I don't think you can do

[04:11] that anymore.

[04:12] Now personally, again this is just my personal opinion and I've always said in the past as

[04:17] long as the seller and the buyer are happy who cares.

[04:21] I heard that the person who bought Justin Kelly's Tron Ali made millions of dollars on Bitcoin.

[04:27] So if you made millions of dollars all of a sudden that extra zero means nothing.

[04:32] So you buying a $25,000 Tron is equivalent to that man buying like a $2500 thing or maybe

[04:40] even like a $250 thing if he made tons and tons of money.

[04:45] He doesn't care but it can't be everybody in that boat.

[04:49] But the world's in a weird place.

[04:51] If you bought Dogecoin on Saturday when it dipped to 14 cents it's now at 32 cents.

[04:57] So you could have doubled up your millions and millions of dollars in less than a week

[05:02] and that's where we're at.

[05:04] People are making so much money so quickly and those who are willing to take the risk

[05:09] are getting rewards 10 times over like never before.

[05:13] But is that going to change pinball?

[05:16] So here's what I think is going to happen.

[05:17] I look at some of this stuff as a little bit of an outlier but here's the problem that's

[05:22] going to happen in pinball and we're there.

[05:24] We're at the shores of it.

[05:25] There are more collectors than new games that people want to collect.

[05:30] The games that people want to collect are the collectors additions from Jersey Jack pinball

[05:35] are the limited additions from Stern for those people out there that can't understand

[05:40] why an Ellie has value you'll never get it.

[05:45] It is simply because there is only that number of machines and there will never be any

[05:51] more than that.

[05:53] That is the only reason there's value there.

[05:56] The only reason that Elvira signature edition it will always be worth way more is that there

[06:02] are only 50.

[06:04] It doesn't even matter what the difference is between the Ellie and the SLE as long as

[06:10] that's the scaricest number of machines that will hold value.

[06:16] Some of you pinball guys can't get your head around that you're like but the gameplay

[06:19] is the same.

[06:20] The features are the same.

[06:21] It's not worth anymore.

[06:23] It's not worth any more to you.

[06:25] If you're a premium buyer and you don't care about limited addition stuff, congratulations.

[06:31] You probably have the healthiest mindset.

[06:34] You will have the most fun in this hobby and you don't care but you're not representative

[06:41] of where all the prices are going on these collectible versions of these machines.

[06:46] Here's what's going to happen.

[06:47] Here's what's going to happen.

[06:49] This is the problem.

[06:50] When you have a distributor who holds on to a game like a pirate CE and a year later sells

[06:57] it for close to $40,000, that distributor made on that sale.

[07:03] What would have taken them?

[07:05] What 15 or 20 other games to sell?

[07:08] Right now, if you're a distributor and you're watching these people sell these games at

[07:14] these prices and imagine if all these distributors just held one back.

[07:19] If every single distributor held one game back, one LE, one CE and just waited a year,

[07:26] they would now be sitting on a game that is worth twice what they paid.

[07:31] Tron LE was $5,700.

[07:35] This is where it gets stupid in people's minds.

[07:38] If you walk across a Tron LE, you are not going to see a $25,000 Pimball machine in terms

[07:46] of anything other than the scarcity.

[07:48] It still looks somewhat like a cheaper, stern game.

[07:52] The artwork is not great.

[07:53] The DMD is just blue.

[07:55] I mean, what about that game?

[07:57] It wasn't even blue to begin with.

[07:58] You have to switch into blue DMD.

[08:00] I don't even think Tron as a color DMD sort of option.

[08:03] Tron LE.

[08:04] It's a great game.

[08:06] It's a fun game.

[08:07] It was an amazing game at $5,700.

[08:09] At $25,000, it's no longer a great game.

[08:14] It's a great collectible.

[08:15] It's not a $25,000 experience.

[08:18] It's now a $25,000 work of art.

[08:21] And I'm not going to argue against that side of it.

[08:24] Because I think people who spend $25,000 on a Tron or $30,000 on a Pirates of the Caribbean,

[08:30] they're not really going to play these games.

[08:32] They now have something that they are going to keep saying is a high, high end Pimball

[08:38] work of art that is in their room and they're just going to drool over it.

[08:42] The other part I don't understand about some of these recent sales though, especially

[08:46] the Tron one, is now that we've seen this game sell both for 20 and 25,000.

[08:53] Why did the price jump so quickly?

[08:56] That's the part I can't understand.

[08:58] Tron LE was maybe like $12 or $13,000, $9,000, $10,000.

[09:04] People were selling them for around $9,000 to $10,000 a couple of years ago.

[09:08] How did it go from being a $10,000 to $15,000 game to a $25,000 game?

[09:14] A year ago, Pirates of the Caribbean was selling.

[09:19] The collectors' additions were selling for around $15,000 to $18,000.

[09:24] How did they jump to $30,000 in one year?

[09:28] The answer is simple.

[09:30] There are now way more collectors in Pimball than there are machines.

[09:36] More and more people are making money.

[09:39] More and more people are looking to put this kind of toy into their home and this is the

[09:43] new reality.

[09:44] It's not an operator's industry, people.

[09:48] Yes, operators, if you're an operator, I would just be loading up my operation with Stern

[09:53] Pros.

[09:54] There is no reason why an operator would put LE's or a CE or anything collectible out

[10:00] on location.

[10:02] Someone was telling me like their Deadpool Pro made them like $20,000 over the last few

[10:06] years.

[10:07] That's what you do if you're an operator you want to make money.

[10:10] They're not there to say my location has all these LE's and a road that's stupid to

[10:15] have your LE's taking abuse.

[10:18] You might as well just put Pros there.

[10:20] But my point is this, there are now so many more people who want these games than there

[10:26] are available.

[10:28] And to get one at MSRP, here's my point of this episode.

[10:32] This is the big change we're going to see.

[10:34] I don't think distributors everywhere are going to continue to sell these things at MSRP.

[10:40] We've seen them not really do what I'm about to explain.

[10:44] And it's what's been happening in the auto industry for many, many years.

[10:49] If there are more people who want a car and the dealership is only a lot of a certain

[10:54] number of cars.

[10:55] We heard Zach many talk about this.

[10:57] Thank you, Zach for talking about it.

[10:59] Every distributor is only a lot of a certain amount of games.

[11:04] So let's say a distributor is a lot of five Mandalorian LE's.

[11:09] And 50 people want it.

[11:11] Why should a distributor simply sell that game at MSRP?

[11:17] That's the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

[11:21] There is way more demand for that game than a $9,200 price tag.

[11:27] Why would a distributor sell it at MSRP and watch people buy it?

[11:32] And immediately those buyers are holding on to something that might be worth way more

[11:37] than $9,200.

[11:39] And this is what ADMs are.

[11:41] Let me read you what an ADM is.

[11:43] It means additional dealer markup.

[11:47] And in the pinball world, we could call it an additional distributor markup.

[11:51] It's an additional dealer profit.

[11:53] And it appears on the sticker next to the manufacturer's MSRP.

[11:58] Now this is something that car people hate.

[12:01] It's also something that pinball people will hate.

[12:04] And it's not something I'm happy to see come to pinball, but it is like Thanos inevitable.

[12:11] It is going to happen.

[12:12] There is no way to avoid this.

[12:14] Now here's where I think it's going to happen.

[12:16] It's not going to happen with your big, big distributors.

[12:19] Because even in the auto world, the big, big dealers that get the most corvettes and this

[12:23] and that, they get the most because they sell the most and they sell the most because they

[12:27] sell the most at MSRP.

[12:29] So I think the huge distributors, the trends of the world, the coin takers, the automates,

[12:35] they're not going to do this.

[12:37] But you can't tell me smaller distributors who might only get one or two LEs.

[12:44] How can they look at what these games are going for and not want to say, look, the market

[12:51] is saying that this Mandalorian is now worth $13,000.

[12:56] If you want to get a Mandalorian at $13,000, you could either have to go to eBay or

[13:01] Pinside, but we're going to be a dealer that does apply an adjusted distributor market

[13:07] price.

[13:08] And if you want to spend a little bit more, we're going to have one available.

[13:12] We are not going to pre-sell these games.

[13:13] We're not going to have a waiting list.

[13:15] We are simply going to set the price.

[13:17] We think it's worth.

[13:19] And if you want it, you can buy it.

[13:20] And I think everyone is ashamed to do this right now.

[13:24] I think they're ashamed to do this because they know that they're going to get yelled

[13:28] at and chastised by the community.

[13:30] But here's the thing.

[13:31] They will still sell every single game if they price it at the right market value.

[13:36] They will.

[13:37] Can you imagine right now?

[13:38] Let's talk, let's, let's walk this through.

[13:40] Can you imagine right now if a distributor had guns and roses collect those additions

[13:45] in a box?

[13:46] If they kept 10 back.

[13:48] And right now they said, look, we have 10.

[13:50] We know they sold out in one hour.

[13:53] We're going to sell these 10 for 16.5.

[13:55] Immediately what would happen is this.

[13:57] They would sell every single one because the market is now selling them at 20 or 19,000.

[14:04] So is that wrong for that distributor to sell $4,000 over MSRP, make $40,000 on the 10

[14:13] CES they held back?

[14:15] Is that so wrong for them to make some of that money for a distributor?

[14:20] This is their living.

[14:21] This is what they do for a living.

[14:23] And so why is it that just the average Joe, flipper or speculator should be able to make

[14:29] all this money?

[14:30] And I see some of you speculators and I'm a speculator at times too.

[14:33] And I'm not ashamed to speculate.

[14:35] I don't care.

[14:36] The reason why I don't care is this.

[14:37] And people could say I'm part of the problem.

[14:39] The reason I don't care is this.

[14:41] The amount of money in this hobby is staggering.

[14:44] I feel broke.

[14:46] Even when I have a dual income and I have good money growing and I have good investments,

[14:50] I feel broke when I see the amount of money in this hobby.

[14:53] And I think there is a huge division in this hobby between a lot of the casual players

[14:58] and tournament players and the collectors.

[15:00] The collectors in Pimball, those of you out there, if you're sitting on $100,000 worth

[15:06] of Pimball machines, you're rich.

[15:09] If you're sitting on $200,000 in Pimball machines, you're extremely rich.

[15:14] Because if you have $200,000 in Pimball, it would probably make my eyes to hear how

[15:19] much money you have in other areas of life.

[15:21] And you should.

[15:22] And I'm not begrudging anybody.

[15:24] But my point is this, the guy who made $5 million this year, he can afford a $38,000

[15:31] prior to the care being without thinking twice.

[15:33] So we're going to see this.

[15:35] Because the other part that's going to happen is this, every single collector's edition

[15:40] and every single LE will be spoken for before they are even revealed.

[15:46] Let me repeat that.

[15:47] You are not going to be able to get on a list to get these machines very soon.

[15:52] Because every distributor's allotment will be spoken for.

[15:55] And then what do you do?

[15:58] What do you do if there's going to be 600 Mandalorians and 3,000 people want one?

[16:03] And when I'm talking only about the LE's, what do you do then?

[16:08] Do you sell to all 600 people at MSRP?

[16:11] What do you do then if you're a distributor?

[16:13] How do you figure out who's on your list?

[16:15] Now normally, it's your repeat customers.

[16:18] It might be some friends.

[16:20] But man, we're at the point now and you know this, that a distributor, like why can't a

[16:25] distributor do what spooky pinball is doing?

[16:29] No one wants to talk about this.

[16:31] Why can't a distributor sell a membership to that distributor?

[16:36] Like why isn't there a coin taker club the way there's a spooky fan club?

[16:40] I mean, spooky pinball is basically saying you get to buy our game first if you give us

[16:46] $40.

[16:48] That's what they're doing with the fan club.

[16:51] So let's say spooky pinball is going to make a thousand LE's next and everybody wants

[16:56] one.

[16:57] The only way you can get one if you are on the fan club list.

[17:01] So that's an additional $40,000.

[17:05] Spooky pinball will make just to give you the right to buy their game.

[17:10] And I'm happy they're doing it.

[17:11] It's very smart marketing.

[17:13] They understand where the market's at.

[17:15] But why won't distributors do that next?

[17:17] Why doesn't a distributor say, hey, if you want to be on my stern LE list, you're going

[17:21] to have to like cough up some dough.

[17:24] And all of a sudden, doesn't it start to feel like being on the LE list with a big distributor

[17:29] or a good distributor who's going to get in a lot, man?

[17:32] Doesn't that now start to feel like season tickets to the NFL?

[17:36] That people are going to grandfather their LE list spot to the next person.

[17:40] See, I think this is going to happen.

[17:42] I think people are going to be like, your number eight on my list for every stern LE.

[17:46] Do you want that?

[17:47] Yes.

[17:48] OK, but you have to like confirm or agree that you're going to buy every single one.

[17:53] And I think you're going to see people say, OK, because I already know that's happening.

[17:57] It's a dirty little thing that happens in pinball where there are people who are on the

[18:02] list for every single distributor, Ellie, and they get it.

[18:05] They don't even care what the theme is.

[18:06] They're just like send it to me, ship it to me or store it for me because if you bought

[18:11] every single LE, it still is a speculators market.

[18:14] I mean, if you bought every LE and kept it new in box, you did not win on every one.

[18:20] You might have got a Led Zeppelin.

[18:21] That's not going up in value.

[18:22] You might have got a monster's.

[18:23] That's not going anywhere in value.

[18:25] You might have got some of the duds like black knight, Ellie, not up in value.

[18:29] If you have the topper, then we're up in value.

[18:31] But this is going to come.

[18:33] There are more people trying to get through the door than there is product.

[18:38] Now the other thing I'm surprised hasn't popped up in this world.

[18:41] And for those of you out there who want to make some money in pinball, I'm surprised

[18:45] there's nobody out there as a business stockpiling these games right now who in the future

[18:53] is going to just start selling you any game you want, but at a price, right?

[18:58] It's like buying bottles of wine and holding on to it until the value goes through the

[19:03] roof.

[19:04] Can you imagine if a distributor popped up tomorrow or just some sort of business entity

[19:10] within pinball and said, hey, we own 10 pirates of the Caribbean collectors editions,

[19:16] new in box.

[19:17] What could they price them at?

[19:19] How much profit would there have been?

[19:21] I don't think this is going to stop in the short term.

[19:24] I think we're going to see people next year watch.

[19:26] They're going to start spending stupid amounts of money on probably Willy Wonka's CEs because

[19:31] new people come in.

[19:33] They want every Jersey Jack machine.

[19:35] They want to have the row lined up and there's none to be had.

[19:38] And that's what's going to happen.

[19:39] We're going to see that game go up next, not to the levels of pirates, not to the levels

[19:44] of guns and roses.

[19:45] Willy Wonka's not the best machine.

[19:48] It didn't have the demand and it's sat and it's sat and it's sat.

[19:51] But sitting for a year unsolved as we see with pirates doesn't mean it can't skyrocket

[19:58] eventually.

[19:59] Now, the only issue with Willy Wonka, they still made a ton of CEs and LEs.

[20:03] Well, they made 500 CEs and they made, I don't know how many LEs, but once here's

[20:08] what's going to happen, the moment Jersey Jack says we're no longer putting Willy Wonka

[20:13] on the line, Jersey Jack has the power to cause all of their old titles to skyrocket.

[20:19] Maybe right now everyone thinks remakes and vaults are always a possibility.

[20:24] The moment these companies come out and say we are never making this again, that immediately

[20:30] almost creates like a 25% on that day price increase of whatever the title is.

[20:36] The moment no more will be made because these collectors want stuff new in box.

[20:42] Let me play devil's advocate on all of this and I want to speak really from my feelings

[20:47] on this because I for one think there should be high end pinball.

[20:52] I for one am surprised that no company understands that I'm surprised that nobody is making pinball

[20:58] machines for rich people because so many rich people are in this hobby.

[21:03] It's sort of sad to me that rich people need to think of $5,700 or tron Ali is now like

[21:09] the rich person's game that game has hardly anything really in it.

[21:14] It wasn't built with a high bomb.

[21:17] It wasn't built with a beautiful sound system.

[21:19] I know you can hook up a sub and stuff.

[21:21] It wasn't built with materials that were anywhere close to the $25,000 price range.

[21:27] And still here we are today in 2021 and no one's making games for rich people.

[21:33] The only thing they're doing to entice rich people is they're making a limited number

[21:38] of something slapping different artwork or armor on it.

[21:42] And then voila you have this sought after thing right it's now it's the one that everybody

[21:47] clamors for even if the experience is exactly the same.

[21:51] I've always said I'm surprised nobody makes a limited game for rich people where there's

[21:57] not like tons of premiums out there of the same exact game but nobody's done it.

[22:02] So because of that right now these rich people and these collectors they want to feel special

[22:07] so they're applying I think specialness and they're applying like a value to these

[22:13] games right now this year that's just not really there.

[22:17] It all is arbitrary and manufactured at a thin air.

[22:21] It's just to make them feel like they have something so many people want and they have

[22:25] one.

[22:26] It doesn't make the game any better.

[22:27] It doesn't make the game any more special when you stand over a tronle how can you

[22:31] feel like you're standing over a $25,000 item.

[22:34] It doesn't matter right.

[22:35] But if I'm going to play devil's advocate here's what I think is going to happen.

[22:39] I personally think all of these prices skyrocketing in one year is stupid.

[22:44] I think it has to do with a few things.

[22:47] I think it has to do with a lot of people making a lot of money in a very short period of

[22:51] time and they don't care what they do with it because they didn't work hard for this

[22:56] money.

[22:57] Everyone won the lottery with crypto if you got in a year ago.

[23:02] Everybody's been winning the lottery with the market in the past year with any of these

[23:06] blue chip stocks.

[23:07] So a lot of people have made six seven figures pretty quickly and now they don't care.

[23:13] They're just going to buy whatever they want.

[23:15] They don't know if's given on what they're purchasing.

[23:18] So you have that happening.

[23:19] You have COVID.

[23:20] People are bored.

[23:21] They haven't got anywhere.

[23:22] They haven't traveled.

[23:23] They're not spending as much on other things.

[23:25] So they're almost acting like the world is over a little bit with this pandemic and I'm

[23:29] going to live once with these kinds of frivolous purchases.

[23:32] So a lot of that is happening.

[23:34] You've also had delays by the pinball companies, right?

[23:37] There hasn't been a ton of new games.

[23:39] Here we are.

[23:40] Five months into the new year and there hasn't been a single new release.

[23:44] People are looking backwards and want to buy something.

[23:46] There's just like there's not enough consistent supply of new games.

[23:51] Here's where things are going to happen.

[23:52] I still think the ADM stuff is going to happen.

[23:54] I think we're going to see markups by certain institutions to allow people to get L.E.'s

[23:58] after they're sold out and C.E.'s after they're sold out.

[24:01] But here's what I think is going to happen with some of these crazy prices we're seeing.

[24:05] They're going to bottom out and they're going to slide back down to reality.

[24:09] The major factor in that is simply this.

[24:13] More amazing games are coming.

[24:16] This is not the end.

[24:18] You could jump in now and say that Pirates of the Caribbean is the end all.

[24:24] It's not.

[24:25] It's not going to make better games with a better theme with better assets.

[24:29] It's going to happen.

[24:31] Stern is just getting started.

[24:32] Stern is the craziest.

[24:34] Stern is just getting started.

[24:36] Stern is going to make so many phenomenal games into the future.

[24:41] They're not over.

[24:42] This is like a whole new golden error for them and it's just beginning.

[24:46] It's not coming to an end anytime soon because so many of us out there are still really

[24:51] young.

[24:52] We're making a lot of money and we're going to keep making money over the next 20 years.

[24:56] Stern is going to be happy to supply us Pimball machines over that time period.

[25:00] As more and more games come out, more and more impressive games will come out.

[25:04] That will make those older games really look dated, really look stale in comparison.

[25:12] Some people think like, oh, Tron Ali because it's a great game.

[25:14] It'll always be a great game.

[25:16] Sure, but it will start to look dated.

[25:18] When you put a Tron Ali next to a Guns and Roses collector's edition, yeah, I think you

[25:25] absolutely cannot.

[25:27] Cannot pay $25,000 for either machine, but there is no way that Tron looks like it's worth

[25:34] anything more than $9,000 when you look at what you can get and I get it.

[25:38] It's all about the scarcity.

[25:40] But when they vault edition, Tron, what happens then?

[25:45] That's the other part.

[25:46] I also believe that everything is a remake potential and everything will be remade that

[25:52] people really want.

[25:53] But here's the part.

[25:54] Here's the part.

[25:55] Yes, they will never remake those 400 Tron Ali's the way they made those games.

[26:00] But I'll tell you the solution to all of this.

[26:03] If what I've said on this podcast annoys you and you're like, canada, you're a jerk,

[26:08] you're basically giving people ideas on how to raise the prices and how to charge over

[26:12] sticker, here's the good news for everybody out there.

[26:15] And I mean this, if you simply don't give a crap about a limited edition pinball machine,

[26:21] you will never have to fall into this shit show.

[26:25] And I'm going to call it a shit show.

[26:27] If you don't care about looking better than your neighbor's collection, you will never

[26:32] fall into this shit show.

[26:34] It doesn't really have value.

[26:37] It doesn't really make your life any better.

[26:41] You won't be a bigger man.

[26:43] You won't be a better man if you have a collector's edition over an Ellie of Guns and Roses.

[26:50] It's not the person playing a collector's edition is having no more fun than someone

[26:56] playing an Ellie of GNR.

[26:58] The person playing Tron Ali, which what, the only difference is a daft punk multi ball,

[27:05] which is not the easiest to get to.

[27:08] That person is having no more fun than someone who plays a fully tricked out Tron Pro.

[27:14] And they know this, the sellers know this, the buyers probably know this.

[27:19] And if you don't care about this stuff, if you don't care about valuing the rarity and

[27:25] just want to enjoy these games and just want to play pinball, you my friend will have a

[27:33] happier life.

[27:34] You'll have a happier wife because you won't be dropping this kind of money on this stuff.

[27:39] You will be much more satisfied with this hobby.

[27:44] If you stare at these big prices and you look at it and you say, I'm out on pinball, this

[27:49] hobby's jumped this shark.

[27:50] I hate pinball now.

[27:51] That makes no sense to me because you simply can sidestep it.

[27:56] Absolutely sidestep it.

[27:57] You don't need to fall into the world of FOMO and Ellie's and I got one.

[28:02] Okay, you got one.

[28:03] Now, how about you show us who you are?

[28:05] I love all these pinball collectors and buyers, right?

[28:08] It's like step out from behind the curtain.

[28:10] And ultimately we go to pinball shows, we see who's in this hobby, we see who people

[28:15] are.

[28:16] It doesn't make you any more interesting if you own any of these machines.

[28:20] What makes people interesting and what makes life fulfilling is found nowhere near a super

[28:28] expensive limited pinball machine.

[28:30] Absolutely not.

[28:32] And you know and I know that the majority of people who buy these super expensive games,

[28:37] they never play them.

[28:38] They simply put dust covers on top of them and they're waxing their play fields after

[28:44] each play and they like to go into the game room.

[28:47] When there's nobody there, they turn the lights on and they think they're reliving some

[28:50] sort of nostalgic past of their childhood and they just feel good.

[28:55] But that's it.

[28:56] That's it.

[28:57] I would much rather.

[28:58] I say this.

[28:59] I say this and I'll say it again.

[29:00] I would much rather take $38,000 and spend a month in Tokyo flying first class eating

[29:07] at Michelin Star restaurants having the most amazing trip through Japan.

[29:10] I'd go to Kyoto, I'd go all over Japan for $40,000.

[29:14] The kind of vacation you could have that you would never forget.

[29:17] I would much rather do that than buy a pie herds of the Caribbean collector's edition.

[29:22] Now I get the old argument, well the person you can spend 40 KN Pires can also do that probably,

[29:27] probably.

[29:28] But I just don't think you guys should get too hung up on what we're seeing because

[29:34] the exit is so easy to take.

[29:37] Just don't value that stuff like that.

[29:40] Don't care when people flex with showing you that stuff and you will be so much happier.

[29:45] And I want people to enjoy Pimball.

[29:47] The thing I really want and I'm for expensive Pimball machines.

[29:52] I just want to see someone make a $25,000 Pimball machine.

[29:55] Here's my dream.

[29:56] I want to see someone make a $25,000 Pimball machine where the bomb on that machine was

[30:02] 20 grand.

[30:03] I want to see someone actually put the shit into the game.

[30:07] I'm sorry to curse on this episode.

[30:09] I want to see someone loaded up so it actually has stuff in it that's worth that.

[30:16] That the value isn't just because of some arbitrary scarcity and nobody's done that.

[30:22] I challenge someone out there.

[30:24] These make a $25,000 game or make a $20,000 game in which the bomb is 10 to 15,000 dollars

[30:33] like actually engineer Mexican like can nobody engineer a mech when I look at a tron Ali

[30:40] those mechs are pathetic when I look at most turns the mechs are pathetic when I look

[30:46] at G and R there's really no mechs in that game.

[30:49] It's like really complex can nobody actually engineer any more in Pimball can we get a mechanism

[30:56] that moves like the doctor who levels up can we get something that's impressive and imagine

[31:01] if you had a bomb of 10 to 15,000 dollars what could be in a game and that's why I think

[31:09] this industry is so strange to me.

[31:12] I'm all for higher prices but give us what we pay for and then the people who are like

[31:16] well it's just fun like Led Zeppelin's fun.

[31:18] Yeah Led Zeppelin's a barren, uncreative, unimaginative game.

[31:23] Travis I can't believe you said like it's more fun than G and R I can't believe it.

[31:27] I can't believe it.

[31:28] Anyway guys have a good day this has just been a random rambling about 80ms and prices

[31:33] and just sidestep it all have fun.

[31:36] Love your family and don't care about Pimball so much bye.

[31:46] Oh, I'm so happy you do.

[31:53] You did it to my heart.

[31:58] You did it to my heart.

[32:03] Oh, I'm happy you do.
