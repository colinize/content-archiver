[00:00] What becomes of a broken hearted?

[00:04] Who I love is now be parted?

[00:09] I know I've got to find some kind of piece of my ass.

[00:20] Welcome to episode 113 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[00:26] This is a really special podcast.

[00:29] This one is one of those that just means so much to me because I get to talk to someone who I believe,

[00:36] and I know you believe, is probably one of the most important figures in the history of all Pimbal.

[00:42] And for me to talk to this gentleman, it means a lot to me.

[00:46] It means a lot to what I do with this podcast because I think for those of you who have listened,

[00:52] who have listened to Canadian Pimbal Podcasts from day one, and seeing this podcast move in different directions,

[00:59] I think people are really satisfied with where we've ended up.

[01:03] We have a podcast that covers the news, that asks the tough questions, that doesn't hold back in seeking the truth about Pimbal,

[01:15] but also a podcast that interviews individuals that are really interesting, that have great stories to tell,

[01:22] and we deliver that to you on a very frequent basis.

[01:27] And I've had the pleasure this year, and over the past few months, of talking to some incredible individuals,

[01:33] everyone from Zambi Yeti to JJ at Game Exchange, to the Black Knight, to George Gomez.

[01:41] And there's many other individuals out there that I've spoken to as well that just really are passionate about Pimbal

[01:49] and share that passion on this podcast, so I thank them.

[01:53] So when I was reading a lot of the news recently, what's going on in Pimbal,

[01:59] and the main issue that I see a lot is licensing issues and themes of Pimbal machines.

[02:07] And I always think of one man when I think about licensing and themes, and where Pimbal is going,

[02:14] and that's Mr. Roger Sharp.

[02:16] And when I reached out to Roger, it was great, because I asked him, I said, Roger,

[02:21] now's a really great time for us to talk about what's going on in Pimbal,

[02:25] what goes on when it comes to licensing of Pimbal machine, and he was all about coming on the show,

[02:32] and was super excited to do it.

[02:34] And so I can't tell you how excited I am to air this interview with Roger Sharp.

[02:40] His insights into the hobby are phenomenal.

[02:43] You know, he's a man who, his goal is quite clear, and it'll come through quite clear when you listen to this interview.

[02:49] He wants more people to play Pimbal.

[02:52] He wants Pimbal to be out there for the masses.

[02:56] He's not about these super expensive machines.

[03:00] He's not about the complexity of machines with nobody to fix them.

[03:05] He sees the world as, I feel like he sees everyone as a potential Pimbal player.

[03:12] If only we can make Pimbal accessible enough to those people.

[03:16] If only we can make Pimbal easy enough for operators to put on location, everyone would enjoy Pimbal.

[03:24] And I sort of agree that Pimbal is this thing that when people walk past it,

[03:29] they'll want to play it.

[03:31] It's just got that magnetic quality.

[03:34] And so, without further ado, I want to thank Roger for coming on the show.

[03:39] I want to thank all of you for listening.

[03:42] I know you love these interviews.

[03:44] They always get the most listens out of all my podcasts.

[03:48] So, I give to you on Canadian Pimbal Podcast, a very special guest.

[03:54] Mr. Roger Sharp, let's roll the tape.

[03:58] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[04:03] Roger Sharp, I don't even know if Roger needs an introduction.

[04:06] He is an author of Pimbal Historian, a designer, the man who pretty much saved Pimbal for all of us in 1976 when he hit that shot on Bank Shot with the New York City Council.

[04:20] Roger, welcome to the show.

[04:23] Thank you. I love the introduction.

[04:26] I think that for most people, they probably just know me better as being the father of Josh and Zach, I think that's a legacy.

[04:34] Yeah, all the other stuff that preceded them.

[04:37] Well, and Roger, I mean, we wouldn't have Pimbal today the way we have it if it wasn't for you.

[04:44] And I think everyone owes you a great debt of gratitude for hitting that shot in front of the lawmakers.

[04:50] And Pimbal is back. What are your thoughts on where you think it's looking at Pimbal in 2017?

[04:56] How happy are you that 40 years later after you hit that shot?

[05:01] There's sort of like this resurgence happening with Pimbal.

[05:05] Yeah, I'm obviously, I'm incredibly gratified by all that has ensued over these past decades.

[05:11] And let's face it, some of the ups and some of the downs.

[05:16] You know, I used to get asked years ago, you know, where did I think Pimbal was going to be in the 21st century?

[05:22] Was it still going to be around?

[05:24] And I always made the answer that if and when anybody ever was able to create something that gave me the same type of tactile experience,

[05:35] the sensory experience and immersion that Pimbal gives me, then sure.

[05:42] Maybe, but that device, that invention has yet to emerge.

[05:48] And again, it's really a great thing, I think, for not only the existing players that are out there,

[05:59] many of the collectors and enthusiasts and hobbyists and so on.

[06:03] Obviously for the factories that are employing designers and programmers and graphic artists and all the rest of it that are creating Pimbal.

[06:11] But I think as well and maybe with Escher having won the pop tournament a couple of weeks ago,

[06:18] it's really, very pleasing to see that there is yet another generation that's ready to step up and enjoy Pimbal,

[06:27] whether they play competitively or not, at least that it hasn't fallen by the wayside and become something that is totally and completely nostalgic.

[06:37] Instead, it's really a contemporary form of leisure time entertainment.

[06:41] So from that standpoint, it's kind of neat to see, although there are still very daunting obstacles to have Pimbal be as pervasive as it was back in the late 70s.

[06:59] What do you think those obstacles are?

[07:02] Obviously the arcades have dwindled to tiny numbers replaced now by barcades.

[07:08] And we used to find Pimbal everywhere, right, in the 70s and 80s.

[07:12] You'd walk in Du Bo Degas, you'd walk into Chinese restaurants and there is Pimbal all over the place.

[07:19] It's probably never going to get back to that level, obviously, with the advent of home video games and other forms of entertainment and now everyone gaming on their mobile devices.

[07:33] So that level is probably not going to happen.

[07:37] But do you think we're going to see more and more sort of barcades and other sort of family centers pop up where Pimbal is a part of it in the future?

[07:46] Well, it's interesting when you say, you know, with video games and all the rest of it, I would counter that by saying that in the mid to late 70s when there was this great surge and admittedly the change over from solid state to, or from molecular mechanics to solid state.

[08:01] And prior really to video kind of coming on the scene, you had something called, you know, cable TV that started in VHS players and VCRs and all the rest of it.

[08:12] You know, everybody thought that that was going to be the death of coin operated amusement games because who was going to want to leave their home, now that they could watch movies and tape various shows and, you know, store number.

[08:23] It's like it's 14 days and you can tape up to seven different things and you know, have these tapes readily at hand. Nobody's going to go to movies anymore.

[08:33] And I think that, you know, the transitioning of what our options are for entertainment, I think the critical part goes back to, you know, the question, G.S.

[08:45] and I guess the part that I kind of laid out to ask that question of, you know, what are the obstacles?

[08:50] It's not a question of there not being a desire potentially on the part of bars taverns and again, much was made, you know, many years ago in terms of DUI and happy hours and people moving away from it.

[09:07] And now we see this emergence of barcades, which I think is great. I think it's a step in the right direction.

[09:14] I think the biggest obstacle, if you will, is the need by location owners and equipment operators to maintain their equipment.

[09:24] And I think that that is a challenge for pinball to kind of become more mainstream.

[09:31] You know, there was a point in time, as you had said, where you had, you know, operators that were out there and they may have had a route with, you know, multiple hundreds of games.

[09:41] And, you know, they had folks on staff who would go around not only as collectors, but also to take care of the games, fix them, change a light bulb, you know, wipe down a control panel on a video game.

[09:57] And those people that become far and few between. And I think that, you know, colleges today, and I'm not suggesting this be the case, offer courses in designing and creating video games.

[10:10] You know, whether vocational schools are out there, training people to be, you know, technicians, if you will, versus having them be, you know, engineers of some sort.

[10:20] That is really, you know, where the greatest need is.

[10:25] If I'm a manufacturer, and I want to have a broader distribution of my equipment other than people's basements, how do we get it out there?

[10:39] How do I encourage, and I'll use a classic example, how do I encourage a Dave and Buster's or Chuck E. Cheese to take pinball machines and operate them?

[10:52] That's really difficult, you know, who's going to train them?

[10:56] Somebody on staff who is going to be dedicated to looking after the proper operation and maintenance of all of the games.

[11:06] And all of the games today tend to be, you know, somewhat mechanical when you look at novelty redemption equipment and family entertainment centers.

[11:14] But, you know, it's not necessarily a daunting a task to keep a ski ball operational or a stop the light type of game operational as it is to maintain a pinball machine.

[11:27] And I think that that's the hurdle.

[11:29] Right. And Roger, do you think that when it comes to pinball innovation, because we hear a lot about innovation in modern pinball, the movement to LCD and stuff that's more visually attractive.

[11:41] But if you still lift up a stern pinball machine in 2017, you still got to take out the soldering gun if you want to, you know, quickly make a fix.

[11:51] And would you like to see more innovation that allows these things to be worked on in real time without the same making it easier for operators to make quick changes on the fly to these things versus more highly skilled persons requirement for maintenance on these games?

[12:10] That would be ideal for a possible look. You know, we've tried to come really close. We being Williams Valley midway way back when we pinball 2000.

[12:19] And the idea that you could, you know, take out an entire play field and replace it with another play field, you know, Larry DeMar and the other guys George Gomez and so on.

[12:29] We're very adept at being able to do that kind of a switch, you know, and the intention was really for the operator to say, look, you know, keep one of these in the back of the truck or whatever else.

[12:41] And if you have a problem with, you know, revenge from Mars, switch it over to episode one for switch it over to wizard blocks or playboying the other games that were, you know, going to be coming down the pipeline.

[12:55] And I think that that was a great approach. It also allowed in terms of design and functionality, the ability for the location owner to go in and take care of the game without going into the cash box, which has always been a major hurdle.

[13:13] Right. So if you leave a set of keys for that operator, well, you know, if I'm going to go out or at that location owner, if I'm going to go out and collect, maybe all the coinage is not going to be in there that should be.

[13:25] So we tried to come up with some things that on the surface might have seemed to be somewhat nominal.

[13:31] But in some ways, we're really absolutely addressing the concerns within, you know, the operating industry having said that.

[13:39] Yes, if there was a way to make the machines function better, be easier to fix, it would be great. But, you know, I'll use the analogy car manufacturers still, you know, develop and build with new technologies, automobiles.

[13:58] And we still have issues where, you know, we find ourselves going into a might as so we find ourselves going into a pet boys or any other place or our local service station or going back to the dealership for routine maintenance.

[14:12] Because the majority of people who buy cars aren't able to go in and fix all of the stuff. I'm come on.

[14:19] They got a battery and replace it. Even if I was, you know, 90 years younger, I'm not going to do that.

[14:26] I don't want to change that hose or fix that electrical thing that's going on because there's a light on the dashboard telling me that something is off.

[14:34] Right. So I think that, you know, we've never been able as an industry to acknowledge the fact that some of the things in our daily lives, TV sets, washer dryers.

[14:48] Onmobiles are maybe outside the scope of what our ability to fix might be and Pimbal kind of falls in the same trap, if you will.

[15:00] And, you know, if somebody were to be able to really take care of everything, the chances of things malfunctioning or going wrong are lessened.

[15:14] I'll go back to a great example, which was, you know, my dear friend Steve Epstein in the Broadway arcade in New York, when Steve had, you know, 60, 70 Pimbal machines at the corner store of the Broadway arcade before it shifted down the street to a smaller space.

[15:30] You know, the daily event, if you will, for he and his workforce sweep the floors clean dust, wipe down video games and go through each and every Pimbal machine. If there's a problem, let's check it out. That was every day.

[15:47] I mean, I don't know where the barcades are by and large in terms of going through their games. I had the good fortune. I guess a little over a week or so ago for Ellen, my wife and I, we were invited up to North Star and Montreal and Adam and Justin and the troops have an incredible barcade.

[16:06] They just overturn the law there, which allowed them to actually operate their business legally. And their games are in Christine shape.

[16:14] Because they actually care for them each and every day. So, you know, the difficulty is number one absentee ownership just by the basis of the business owner.

[16:26] Absolutely.

[16:28] The maintenance, if you will, the part of the operator and, you know, we're left as a consumer to deal with whatever we wind up encountering.

[16:41] And if that experience is not a good one, we're doubtful to go back to it again. So it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy where the notion that a Pimbal machine can't earn money to the same extent that a video game can.

[16:55] Is actually fulfilled because guess what? It can. Because flipping, working. Or, you know, these features are off.

[17:04] Well, in these modern redemption games are really designed to just get you to keep pumping dollars in, you know. And they require very little maintenance. So, if you're an operator, you know, you're literally looking at the bottom line.

[17:20] Do you think Roger? So, in terms of pricing two of these new machines, because we hear a lot too when a new game gets announced and it's $8,000, $9,000, that it's solely geared towards the home collector, right? That an operator is not going to put a $9,000 wizard of Oz on location.

[17:39] Because the chances of getting that back before you start making profit on it, the gap becomes so much bigger because of how much more expensive these games have become.

[17:50] Do you think price is also a deterrent with where some of the Pimbal pricing is going nowadays?

[17:55] Absolutely. I mean, think about it. Let's go to an average kind of bar, if you will. And maybe the Pimbal machine is going to do, I don't know, $120 a week.

[18:08] And they're working on a split the operating location owner. So both of them get the pocket 60 bucks to $6,000 machine and you do the math. That's 100 weeks.

[18:17] And that means that the game was up and functioning for all 100 weeks. So you have two years to make back your investment, not to make a profit, to make back your investment.

[18:29] So yeah, I mean, the idea of populating and so many of the barcades are actually doing it, populating their space with vintage video games so that somebody can play a lunar lander again if that's what their designer is because they're able to salvage it from somewhere, but you're finding older Pimbal machines that are being brought back to life because the price point is a deterrent now with new equipment.

[18:56] And I understand that I get it. I mean, I'm dismayed shocked, overwhelmed when I hear some of the price points.

[19:04] All right.

[19:05] Because, you know, back in the day, a game from distribution was probably, I don't know, it depends on the customer, but probably in a low 4,000s.

[19:14] I mean, it's somewhat more reasonable.

[19:16] Do you think when you hear these new prices, there's another aspect to it, and I didn't mean to cut you off.

[19:22] Go on, go on, Roger.

[19:23] And I want to belabor at least this part of the discussion.

[19:28] The other problem when it comes to Pimbal being operated commercially is that there's still a notion and what I'm going to say is probably sacrosanct to a lot of people, but when I started really getting into Pimbal, I was playing in Wisconsin at the when I was at the University of Wisconsin.

[19:46] And obviously, or admittedly, it was an out of ball area.

[19:50] I believe very strongly in out of ball games, no specials, no free games.

[19:56] If you're going to give away 10 or 20% on your replay, it's $100 a week. That's $10 to $20. You've kind of cut into that.

[20:05] If you're doing a match feature, even if you lessen it to 2 to 5%, and God willing, that's the highest that you'd ever do.

[20:13] Potentially, you're giving away a quarter of your revenue, and the fear has always been that the only reason, and whether or not you agree with this or the listeners agree to this, I tend not to, but that's just me.

[20:27] If the belief is that the only reason people play Pimbal is because they can win a free game.

[20:35] Well, then that is totally contrary to what the real allure should be for playing a game.

[20:42] Look, I can sit down and play multiplayer driver. And yes, if I win my race, I get to stay on to play another 90 seconds with a new game with either the same people or different people.

[20:55] So in effect, yes, you are winning in quotes a free game. But by and large, most video games are just giving you an extension of play. You get a new life.

[21:03] You get extra time. I've passed the threshold, and I now have extended time on my driving game. Whatever the case might be, why that mentality hasn't happened for Pimbal is beyond me.

[21:18] I would think that most people I know, it's not the free game. It's really, especially in New York City, everyone who plays a lot, it's all about getting the high score on the machine.

[21:28] Having those three initials up there is everything to the guys who play frequently. And then the casual people who play, I don't even think they know what mode is or codes are or free games even at stake.

[21:41] So I don't think free games are like the incentive for the most part. But pricing is something we talk about on this show a lot, Roger.

[21:52] I saw you at TPS, and the prices keep climbing up. We've got $15,000 super-elies. We've got games that are clearly targeting the wealthy home collector.

[22:03] But even your full-featured game now is creeping up into that $78,000 range. Do you think the cost of manufacturing has really increased that much that we've almost doubled the price of Pimbal over the last decade?

[22:20] Or are the manufacturers just wise to the fact that their clientele has deeper pockets, has shown us sort of inability to hold onto their money.

[22:34] I think Pimbal people get really into it and very emotional with their purchases where they just keep buying every new inbox game.

[22:41] And the manufacturers notice that and just keep seeing where the ceiling's at and they haven't hit it yet. And we're at $89,000 now for these elies.

[22:50] Let me comment on that. So a new iPhone comes out, oh my god, I've got to be first in line and I'm going to spend $800 for it or whatever the number is.

[23:00] There's a no 4D TV or a new VR headset that's coming out at some exorbitant price point. You're always going to have the early adopters who could care less about what the price is versus the other people who are going to say, well, if I wait six months, if I wait a year, the price is going to come down.

[23:21] Everything that comes out in our life that touches us comes out at premium prices just does. You know, the cost of going to a first run movie as escalated technology, obviously, you know, whether it is computers, iPhones, iPads, tablets, the latest and greatest TVs, now VR is the hot thing.

[23:45] Everything comes out at a premium price point and that's going after the early adopters. Well, in Pimball, you have these encroach early adopters. So everybody knows that, again, it depends on theme. It depends on, I guess the manufacturer depends on all of these things as to whether or not.

[24:04] They believe that they can sell automatically 200 machines, 500, 600, everything else above that is gravy. Now, the bigger challenge is, and it's a terrible thing to say because I don't want to see the industry get really hurt or cut off at the knees is that if everybody, everybody being whatever proportion of the audience that we want to think of, if everybody were to hold back saying, no, sorry, I'm sorry.

[24:34] I ain't going to do it. Do you really think that the manufacturers would continue to charge the numbers that they're charging because I'll, I got to tell you and I'm not in a factory anymore.

[24:46] But I have to believe that the escalation of price to manufacture, to employ and all the rest of it is not by a quotient of 100% difference. I mean, you're just mentioning $8,000 games. Well, you know, I mentioned before that the games at Williams Valley Midway didn't like granted. It's almost 20 years ago.

[25:16] And there is inflation and all these other factors that come into play. But I can't believe that, you know, it's that big of difference from a $4,000 game to an $8,000 game. Now limited runs, meaning that you're buying less parts. So your, your bill of materials becomes different. I get that. And I understand it.

[25:41] And, you know, if all of the various companies that are out there, you know, the major companies, however you want to describe and define them, the boutiques of the world and whatever their profit margins are, we're feeding that beast as collectors who are willing to pay the price.

[26:03] Right. You know, I think that that's all well and good. But I think going back to, you know, how we got on to this, if we're looking at trying to have something that is commercially viable.

[26:16] And it's interesting because being commercially viable, meaning that more games are populated out in the real world, potentially also means that you are

[26:25] hopefully reaching people who may not have thought about buying their own game. You know, how do you reinforce the idea of another generation of people buying games? I mean, it becomes somewhat self fulfilling in its own way to say, all right, if I'm out there and I'm playing and I'm enjoying.

[26:50] And now I'm at a point in my life where I have, you know, the wherewithal, the space and whatever else to buy a game, you know, you want to buy it. Look, the current number of collectors and enthusiasts are only getting older. Where's the next generation other than the ones who are going to inherit whatever it is that's going to be left behind. I'm sure that Josh and Zach have already carved out my games as to who's getting what versus whatever stuff that they're going to probably say cannot believe he held that for that long.

[27:19] Let's get rid of this one. We'll sell it. Right. So, so your passion Roger is getting as much pinball out in the public, right? You don't want to see pinball be relegated solely to the collectors, right? People's homes, not because that doesn't introduce it to the youth of America, unless it's those people's children, which is not enough of an exposure to create a user base that will make it viable for these companies to survive.

[27:49] The next 20 years. Right. I mean, I'm all for the fact that being able to find a family entertainment center, walk in and among their array of different attractions. There is a somewhat well functioning pinball machine of whatever era. Right.

[28:07] Right. That to me is the ideal. But let's let's talk. There's still pockets. Yeah, a place is, but you know, to work with that you said before, they're far less than they used to be. They used to be around every corner. And you know, I think that one of the enduring parts of my pinball book.

[28:23] Are absolutely the photographs of James Hamilton, where we went out of our way because I tended to want it to be this way. We wanted to show the diversity of where you could find pinball machines.

[28:36] And it's really a celebration of that as well as the diversity of the various people who are playing. Right. And that doesn't exist anymore.

[28:46] Roger, let's talk about when we talk about the next generation, we talk about enticing younger individuals to explore pinball. Let's talk about how the themes today seem to be solely targeting the older sort of 40 to 60 year old demographic.

[29:04] And why do you think there aren't more themes that would appeal to a younger demographic, even a family, right. It's really rare that we see a licensed theme go after that more youthful and sort of younger demo.

[29:21] No, no, I agree with you. And I think again, the reason for it, and we've just been talking about it, who is the primary audience? Primary audience is an older person. The primary audience, not even a secondary audience, is the location, the bowling alley, you know, where children can be exposed to a pinball machine. That's not a primary driver for any of the companies currently in business.

[29:48] But they did market research and I always, I always harp on market research on my podcast because I work in marketing. But I would assume that most of these collectors, though, most of these home buyers have children and have children who don't really love the themes that dad is bringing home every time he gets a new pinball machine.

[30:10] And I'm just shocked, though, that there is in a frozen pinball or more Disney themes that come out that the parent would buy simply for the kid, right.

[30:21] I mean, right now I just saw a spooky release the Jetsons as sort of a family theme. But to me, the Jetsons is even too old. Like that's what the older demo was into when they were a kid. No, no young kid knows what the Jetsons is these days.

[30:34] So it's, yeah, but but but take it a step further for any about Disney for the moment in terms of, you know, whatever they have that might be more contemporarily timed a la frozen.

[30:46] The problem that you have is that for any of the license of ours out there, studios or rights holders.

[30:53] If you're going in and what you're talking about is I have an old demographic and as has been stated on numerous occasions over the years by one of the principles of a major pinball company, we're a bar and tavern kind of place.

[31:07] Well, you know, do you really want to frozen in a bar? No. And even in a barcade.

[31:14] All right, because it's not appealing to them. If you were to say, look, we're going to be going into family entertainment centers only.

[31:22] Then it becomes more age appropriate and to your point for those people who actually care or have a curiosity or even have some familiarity.

[31:31] Take a look at the themes that exist for redemption games.

[31:37] I mean, those are all over the lot. And I'm just thinking of one in particular that just came out or is coming out from one of the companies based on Paw Patrol.

[31:49] I mean, that's a five to nine year old demographic. Right.

[31:52] So in that arena, if you will, it is geared more to a youthful audience because their primary market is not a home market.

[32:02] Their primary market or family entertainment centers. Right.

[32:06] So, you know, it's somewhat of a dichotomy, if you will, or a paradox of sorts in terms of where video games go in terms of their subject matter and things as well as pinball.

[32:19] And then on the other side of the spectrum, you have these, you know, younger types of themes and game.

[32:30] When I was walking around T.P.F. and I was thinking a lot about this and sort of the entry point into pinball for younger people.

[32:39] The system that's really interesting, and again, I don't know how well it's going to do when it goes into the marketplace, but it is P3 and multi-morphic.

[32:47] And have you had a chance to sort of jump on that and see what Jerry's doing with his sort of modular system.

[32:54] And what it was interesting about it, he has a game that actually teaches you just the basics of how to play pinball.

[32:59] And then he also has this fun game called Heads Up, where it's two machines connected to each other. That's almost like Tetris meeting pinball, meeting puzzle bobble.

[33:08] But he's got games that really are targeting young kids at sort of like an entry level into pinball.

[33:15] Are you excited when you see someone at least making an attempt to make like my first pinball game?

[33:22] I'm intrigued by it. I'm enthusiastic about whether or not they can follow through and find an audience.

[33:32] So I give them all the credit in the world. I may not necessarily agree sometimes it's some of the creative execution and just the interface, if you will.

[33:43] But by and large, it's like go for it.

[33:46] I've always had the feeling that whatever can be imagined can actually happen.

[33:57] If somebody can imagine something, I mean go back to Jules Verne who determined the century and at this last century, the one before was thinking about stories where people were going to the moon.

[34:11] And I think that whatever Jury is doing or anybody else that's out there, go for it and see if it resonates with the audience.

[34:22] In a world where there is so little original thinking when it comes to pinball.

[34:29] And I say that because it seems like everyone's relying on a licensed theme now.

[34:35] Do you wish there was more sort of creativity and just pure dreamers out there coming up with original IPs for pinball?

[34:43] Well, I mean, I've joked with with Jack saying that your third game is actually a licensed game.

[34:50] He said, no, it's not. It's Pat Lawler doing his game.

[34:53] And I said, no, no, no, for the community, it's a licensed Pat Lawler game.

[34:58] And that's why people are going to gravitate to it because they love what Pat Lawler has been able to create.

[35:04] And they're going to be receptive to whatever.

[35:08] And I think the dialed in is proven that there is a world and a marketplace for original themes.

[35:15] Look, you know, I know that most people think that I've carved my teeth on just to in brand licensing over the years and might.

[35:22] My professional career, at least with the coin up was was far broader in scope than just that.

[35:30] And I always felt that the mix and the match between what we did with Williams Valley from 88 until 2000 or at least 1999 was to weave in licensed games, not as a necessity, not as a next in line, but because there was really an arden passion and desire.

[35:51] On the part internally by a design team to say, God, we want that.

[35:57] We think that we can do really a great job. Let's see if we can get it.

[36:00] But nobody was wedded to it. They could still go off and create, you know, their own original themes.

[36:06] And I think that the reliance on only licensing falls back to and maybe as an analogy.

[36:16] In some ways, I never thought of it this way before. So I'll say it now because it just occurred to me.

[36:21] I said before that there are a number of people out there who believe that the only reason that people play pinball is because you have a chance to win a free game.

[36:31] I think by the same token, there are any number of people out there who believe that the only type of pinball machine that will be acceptable is if it has a license that.

[36:43] God forbid anybody should just think of it as being just the purity of it being a pinball machine.

[36:49] And I think that that is really distressing to me because it takes away what should be the in a appeal of pinball, which is just.

[37:03] It exists. It is what it is. And, you know, if it's a medieval madness for getting about the rebuild and the remake or whatever else.

[37:12] I mean, if it's an attack from Mars, if it is a whirlwind or shaker, get away, black night, cyclone, you know, think of all the games over the years that people really think very highly of that are not licensed games.

[37:29] I think that working on a license can sometimes be a crutch.

[37:37] And I take nothing away from any of the designers out there, any of the creators that are doing, you know, what they're doing.

[37:45] But I think that, you know, it's easy to take a license because there's already an adhered storyline.

[37:52] So how do we apply that storyline into features and to play field components of some sort or another?

[38:01] Right. Because the pinball tends to define itself, if you will, as opposed to, and I guess most recently, as opposed to something like a dialed in, where, you know,

[38:15] Pat and Ted and the rest of the team had this notion, this idea of God, wouldn't it be great if we could have put a phone in a game?

[38:24] Wouldn't it be great if we could create our own little universe, our own world and do it with, you know, animations and things in the tap box?

[38:33] But that's the level of originality.

[38:36] And that is what really helped define pinball to take it from where it was back in the 50s on through the the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and now.

[38:46] So I know that George Gomez on some occasions in the past, at least I think so, if I'm misquoting him or my apologies in advance.

[38:54] But I think that George was the one who at one point in time said, don't be surprised if, you know, Stern doesn't come out with an original game sometime.

[39:02] And it's like, okay, cool, great. Hopefully that does happen.

[39:07] And hopefully that game is successful so that there is motivation on the part of that particular company to do it again.

[39:16] When I started at Williams back in 1988, one of the things that I really felt so passionate about was licensed games.

[39:28] And I remember telling the powers of B that forgetting about what Balli had accomplished back in the mid to late 70s, which really put that company on the map or before they haven't been.

[39:41] I said, you know, it'd be nice to do like a licensed game like do one in the spring, one in the summer, one in the fall, one in the winter.

[39:48] And you know, the reaction that I got was because we had just purchased Balli Midway.

[39:53] Look what it did for them. That's like I understand, but I still believe that there's, you know, there's some way to kind of do this.

[40:01] I think that it could be fun. You know, in the first game that we did was El Byrue, and that was obviously a massive success.

[40:08] And it led to us being able to again embrace the notion of doing licensed content not only for pinball, but also for video games.

[40:16] You know, we took something like a high impact football and suddenly it became, you know, NFL Blitz.

[40:22] Right. And took something like an archival and it became NBA Jam.

[40:26] Not the same design teams, but again, it was the idea of being able to enrich the experience thematically.

[40:35] And I think that, you know, if you go down a path and look at the movie industry, if you go down a path where everything has to be a superhero movie.

[40:45] At some point in time, there's going to be this level of excess and there's going to be a drop off.

[40:52] It's the fact of what you end up saying because it's always a surprise when maybe a sequel or a proposed trilogy doesn't become the trilogy because the sequel didn't do as well.

[41:03] I think of the matrix as being a classic example.

[41:06] Oh, the first movie, yes. The second and the third. Oh, no way in heck.

[41:10] Right.

[41:11] And then I'm not trying to point a finger at one of the brothers for that particular franchise, but you know, it left people wanting something more better and different.

[41:21] And sometimes, you know, what's best is to kind of let it stand on its own merits and not necessarily plan on the repetitiveness of it.

[41:32] Yeah. I would agree. And it's interesting, Roger, when you look at the reception dialed in God, because I think people are starving for originality and creativity.

[41:44] But people are also their own worst enemies because I think when you saw the reception of dialed in, there was also this aversion to being open-minded to something new.

[41:55] Right. How could you have a comic book explain the story? How could you have a cell phone flipping and pinball people are pretty stubborn, right?

[42:02] And because I think they've been, they've been sort of engineered to expect the same thing over and over again that when you change the format a little bit, they're resistant.

[42:11] But when people play dialed in, right, when you hear people's feedback, it's always super positive.

[42:18] It's almost impossible not to have fun on that machine. And it's going to be interesting to see how it sells though.

[42:25] Will this game with its amazing gameplay, with its great flow, with its pat-law or game? Will it win people over knowing that it's going to go up against the competition, which is going to be juggernauts in terms of themes that are coming out this year?

[42:42] Do you think dialed in is going to be a success for Jersey Jack Roger? I think it's going to struggle even though it is a great game.

[42:49] Well, I think that on its own merits, it's a question of how you define success for the company. But I think that it is.

[42:56] Probably financial, right, if you're a Jersey Jack.

[42:59] Well, don't be saying in terms of either quantities or whatever their build rate is and so on. I think that yes, I think that it can break through.

[43:09] But again, I go back to the fact that you're looking at a diminished market for pinball in general. I go back to what we were talking about before.

[43:18] The only way to really break through is to be able to get machines out in operation and not necessarily only in people's personal game rooms.

[43:30] Well, dialed in is so expensive. So I think we heard that immediately when Jack announced the price that there's no way operators are going to go near this thing.

[43:38] Even though it's got technology that brings in a young audience with the selfies and the camera and the cell phone, it's probably $3,000 too expensive to even consider.

[43:48] But even any of the other companies that are out there selling games are equally expensive.

[43:56] Sure. So, you know, I mean, the theory of relativity over many aerospace, you know, make it out into the real world as opposed to collectors.

[44:05] You're still looking at unfortunately a very finite industry, if I want to call it an industry, maybe 10,000 machines in total from everybody cumulatively will be sold this year.

[44:21] Oh, my God, we used to do that in a single game years ago.

[44:27] So you have to have some form of affordable entertainment. I know that, you know, Stern has looked at that in the past with the pinball or whatever it was called the pen that, right?

[44:37] Yeah, they get here basically for the home.

[44:40] But, you know, could that have been a solution for putting pinballs out in the location?

[44:45] And then I go back to, you know, what's that other critical aspect maintenance?

[44:51] Who's going to maintain them? You know, we had a situation in Chicago.

[44:56] I don't want to, you know, point fingers necessarily, but, you know, we had our league that we were doing at a game works and had to talk the store manager into it and have to kind of work and train some of the guys that were on the floor to maintain the games.

[45:12] And unfortunately, at some point in time, for whatever the reasons that manager was let go.

[45:19] The other decision was to get rid of the text that they had.

[45:22] The net result was that the games fell into disrepair.

[45:26] And we'll get into the details as to what the impact was on the earnings of the games and the new players that came in specifically because of them.

[45:38] But we wound up turning our attention over to a place called level 257, which isn't a neighboring part of the mall out in the Northwest suburbs.

[45:48] And there the manager was receptive. We kind of changed the pricing policy on his cards.

[45:55] The selfie league was born and the games have been maintained with staff of people, of fellows who are very cognizant of, you know,

[46:07] when things are not functioning right. So, you know, for them, the return on investment has been exceptional.

[46:14] And we've taken what we're, you know, five pinball machines kind of left off on the side to now close to a dozen games that they have an operation.

[46:25] And the plan is to expand that exponentially in the coming months because there's enough traffic to bear that makes it worthwhile.

[46:36] And it's not going to be all new games. Some of it is going to be some of the vintage classics mixed in, although they've now become somewhat of a test location for some of the Stern product as well as Jersey Jack.

[46:50] Now the plan as well is for Dutch pinball.

[46:54] And the basket is available for them to get one of those. You're looking forward to that. Looking forward to maybe if it ever happens aliens to kind of really populate their lineup because they have an insatiable audience.

[47:09] And again, they're treating the games the way that they should be treated.

[47:13] Right. Let's talk about licensing. And I know it's something that you're very well known for Roger and you broker a lot of deals between studios and pinball manufacturers.

[47:25] Let's talk about the process of how a license usually comes about. Now is it is it primarily the manufacturer going to the studio or the license holder and asking permission because they just say,

[47:40] you know, gosh, this this theme would just be perfect for pinball or do you see studios approaching manufacturers with interest of building a pinball machine for a theme that they have as it makes or as a primarily manufacturer going to the studios these days.

[47:57] It's a two way street. I mean, in the beginning probably less so because there had been more than a decade of no one doing anything in the marketplace.

[48:10] Writing quite up. You know, the days of Valley with Catherine fantastic and wizard and out in John and well, that was Catherine fantastic with rolling stones, the original and so on.

[48:23] You know, that kind of fell by the wayside as did the industry through some difficult times back in the early 80s on through.

[48:32] So there was a period of dormancy before kind of picked back up. But it becomes a two way street. It's it's a shopping market, if you will.

[48:43] You know, I've been around licensing now for over 30 years and I think that there's a desire on the part of some studios, some personalities to say, God, when to be great, if we have a pinball machine,

[49:01] who's out there by the same token, it's also the opportunity for a manufacturer to say we want to do this next. Let's see how we can locate who the rights holders are and see if they're interested in doing it.

[49:16] When you identify a theme writer, when a manufacturer identifies a theme, let's let's use an example. Let's say I want to make big trouble in little China, right? And you go to the studio.

[49:29] Do you have a list of really sort of like important initial questions you ask just to make sure that you can get enough of the rights of the theme to make it worthwhile to make a game on.

[49:43] So stuff like the music, the actors, the clips from the actual movie, you know, because that stuff becomes important to actually making a pinball machine that becomes an immersion of that theme.

[49:56] Absolutely. So ideally, and I'll go back to the Wains Valley days.

[50:06] I would kind of keep track as to what was going on out in the outside world and would always be sitting down with the designers and saying, hey, is there any interest? There's a movie coming up or there's this TV series or this personality or whatever. What do you think?

[50:24] And you know, if you have people that are interested in enthusiastic, then you kind of follow through by the same token, there were times where they'd be coming after me saying, we really want to do this. Go out and get it.

[50:36] And to your point, it really becomes not even a negotiating process. It's almost like a first date.

[50:46] You know, what assets do we need? Do we need like this rights? Do we need speech? Do I need the ADR? Meaning that I can pick up the audio from the movie or the TV show or the concert, if you will, who has the music rights?

[51:02] So you kind of go through that process to understand what it is that you are potentially going to be buying and what your needs are.

[51:09] Look, if I need to go out and buy a car, typically I don't ask if it comes to the steering wheel.

[51:17] Does it have an engine? There are some things that are kind of basic in terms of my making a purchasing decision to buy that automobile and I have some certain expectations.

[51:27] Whether it's a used car or a new one, you know, I want to make sure at least it has tires and things. It's the same process.

[51:33] I do a lot and I have recently with slot machines, which tend to have become a much more interactive visual experience for anybody who's seen any of the newer generation of slot machines.

[51:48] Pimball, it's a little bit different, although in the case of, you know, some of the newer games that are now featured in monitors, yes, you want to have footage. You want to have likeness rights.

[51:59] So there becomes a shopping list of absolutely critical components that you need and want in order to pay tribute to a particular theme.

[52:13] If those are not available, then you have a decision to make.

[52:17] And that decision is you either go forward and you take what you can and you try to piece it together as best as you can or you walk away.

[52:26] And, you know, I've had occasions where I've walked away. I've had occasions where the studio didn't have the rights and I had to go after individual talent on my own, which I wound up doing, where maybe the music was separate.

[52:42] You know, it's a question of how much are you willing to invest in your own time and effort personally, meaning me, to be able to have somebody's dream realized because this is just something that they want to do.

[52:59] Roger, you got to get this for us.

[53:02] I want to ask some specific licensing questions about some of the recent games that have come out.

[53:08] But before that, Roger, in terms of the cost, does a studio say the cost for this license is a total amount or is it price per game?

[53:19] I'm going to allow you to make this game for three years and this many units and we're going to charge you X amount of dollars per unit.

[53:26] How does the financials usually shake out when it comes to signing a licensing agreement?

[53:32] The basics are real simple. You have a term, whatever that period of time might be.

[53:39] It's a question of whether or not you want worldwide rights. So that comes into play.

[53:45] You have upfront advance guarantee that you want an obstruction and in the case of Pimble, which is different than what I do with slot machines because there's no revenue share.

[53:57] It's a price point per game that you're going to be building.

[54:02] In same cases, depending on the structure of things, you may have it for a specific quantity of machines versus open ended.

[54:14] I didn't sit down, we'll use Adam's family. I didn't sit down with that. Well, it was originally Orion Pictures, but Paramount took it over.

[54:22] I didn't go to them saying, Hi, we're going to build a little bit over 21,000 machines.

[54:28] Or the expectation being, look, I know we can deliver 10 to 15,000 and I didn't have to go back to them saying, guess what? It's incredibly successful. We're going to build more.

[54:37] That was all built into the contract and to the term. So there was no limitation on what we could or could not deliver if you will, out into the marketplace.

[54:47] There's been a lot of question for you.

[54:52] Yeah, I think it does. There's a lot of...

[54:55] Because I know that there's a misconception that the reason that the price points for Pimble machines are so high is because the licenses cost so much.

[55:04] Yeah, or they run out in three years and it's on like a pharma company to sell it or else they lose it. So we heard a lot of that with Dutch and Bail.

[55:12] Well, you can get an extension. You can get it an option for renewal. I mean, those are the things that are typically, if you're doing it the right way, that are built into the original negotiations. That's what I do. So what I've always done.

[55:24] Right. Because I know there was concern when Dutch hit a sort of quagmire with their manufacturer that they had a three year deal to build the Bowsky.

[55:35] And so if there's too much of a delay, that way their license would somehow expire. So you're saying they could extend that.

[55:41] I got them an extension.

[55:44] Okay, so you got it. It wasn't a problem.

[55:47] Right. Now, is that...

[55:49] I mean, that may be part and parcel and with all due modesty because of the relationships that I have, where maybe if it had been somebody else that might not have been as easy.

[56:01] The case as it turned out to be, but for me, it was a very simple process.

[56:07] So you and you're needing to have an extension. I was like, okay, here.

[56:13] Here you go. You're deeply connected, obviously, with a lot of studios. And you've been around the block for many decades with different contexts.

[56:22] Another game or two games that sort of have been talked about a lot because there's an actress that appears on one game and not it and other.

[56:33] It's a Gourney Weaver that appeared on Ghostbusters, but not in Alien.

[56:38] And there's just a lot of speculation about why that is. And Roger, just wanted to ask if you had any insight into her situation when it comes to Pimbal.

[56:50] Is she exclusively with Stern? Was there just money she wanted to be part of Alien? And it was just different because of the studios with the different films.

[56:59] Do you have any knowledge of how that all played out that she's on a Stern game and not in a highway game?

[57:07] I guess that would be a question better asked of Andrew Highway because I wanted negotiating the original deal for Highway Pimbal.

[57:17] And whatever they wanted to do subsequently with Fox, the owner of the IP, the intellectual property, and whatever the talent usage was, was something that could have been, I guess, circumvented.

[57:32] I wasn't involved or asked to be involved other than being able to be at the front end of it.

[57:40] So, you know, however that proceeded.

[57:44] I can't comment at because I don't know in terms of the questions the way that you structured it was or some level of exclusivity or what have you.

[57:56] Look, when anybody does a film or a TV project or whatever else, there are certain rights that they wind up giving.

[58:05] With some talent, there's an exclusion to being on any type of answer, merchandise that I want their face on a t-shirt that I want it to be part of an action figure that I want it to be in a video game.

[58:17] I mean, whatever it might be.

[58:19] There are some conditions that various actors and performers wind up stipulating.

[58:27] So, in the case of Ghostbusters, I guess the assumption would be that those rights existed where either Stern had to go to each of the actors, cast members to say, hi, we want to use your face, your voice, whatever.

[58:44] And they didn't have a problem or they paid whatever the additional cost might have been as opposed to potentially the way that Andrew Highway proceeded with aliens.

[58:55] But, you know, would it have been a situation of, and we're talking about Sigourney Weaver, Sigourney Weaver saying, God, I really love being in Ghostbusters.

[59:04] And, oh, they're going to do a pinball machine. That's great. I'll let them do it. Oh, wait, there's another company line. Do you have it? Yeah, I really didn't like my role in that. I don't want to part of it.

[59:15] So, you know, no, no, no, no, no. Again, speaking from a point of sheer ignorance because I wasn't involved in the latter stages of aliens and wasn't involved at all with Ghostbusters for Stern.

[59:33] You know, I find it somewhat interesting, if you will, because I haven't really seen the aliens pinball machine.

[59:42] It's interesting, I think, for fans to Rogers, she appeared with her full likeness and voice in the Zen pinball version of Alien, which had all of the, I believe the maybe three movies.

[59:56] There was three versions that they launched those on Alien Day last year. So, I think so. It seems like she is available. So it probably was either a money issue or some, you know, she wanted more for that role.

[01:00:09] Alien is having a real big resurgence with the Alien Day now being a moment that Fox is celebrating. There's a new Alien movie coming out.

[01:00:18] Yep, next month. Roger, let's talk about another sort of licensing deal that didn't go well. And we know you were not a part of this one.

[01:00:27] When you saw Kevin Kool-Ack announced that he had the rights to predator featuring the most expensive probably Hollywood actor of all time to license, were you immediately suspect of his claims to have secured that license?

[01:00:44] No, not at all. I mean, I took out a face value that they had the license. And I remember contacting a dear friend of mine, F Fox, to say congratulations.

[01:00:56] I see that you guys are doing predator and it's like, huh? No, no. Oh, okay. And I knew Kevin when he was much younger and you know, he was playing pinball, you know, against Josh and Zach as young little people.

[01:01:13] So I thought that he got everything squared away. And obviously he wasn't able to get it squared away. And you know, things kind of fell by the wayside.

[01:01:23] When you called Fox and they were like, well, what were we talking about? At that point, did you, did you like warn anyone you knew who was like in on it or putting money down or was it just like like, I'll just like to see how this thing plays out for people because it doesn't seem good.

[01:01:42] I remember exactly the timing.

[01:01:44] It might have been after pinball expo. I mean, I don't go to a lot of shows and events in all honesty. And this was kind of like early on in the process.

[01:01:55] Right. And the person that I was talking to, it would not have been uncommon to say, yeah, we're in the process of getting the contracts done or that came through someone else in the department.

[01:02:07] Because you know, I think if you look back at it, probably it was out there for about three or four years.

[01:02:13] Right.

[01:02:14] It's various stages. So, you know, in the early days, I think that that was my first, wow, that's kind of cool or neat.

[01:02:21] And you know, look, I worked with Arnold on T2 for both the video game as well as the pinball machine. So wasn't foreign to me in terms of, you know, being able to use his likeness or whatever else.

[01:02:34] And just thought, OK, this is kind of neat. And I think that, you know, there's there's a greater level of of detail involved in licensing over the years.

[01:02:52] Admittedly, there's been any number of people that have approached me saying, hi, and what and to you, even to your point, the question that he asked before, you know, how can I do a license?

[01:03:01] What can I do? What can I do? And I don't know. I don't want to do this. I'm just going to build it for myself.

[01:03:07] And so on. You know, I remember seeing what was the late Bill Paxton pinball machine that Ben Heckendorf had, or Heckendorf, sorry, I don't know his name, but I saw when I went up to the Midwest gaming classic years ago, and I thought, God, it's kind of neat.

[01:03:23] I know it was only for his personal use. He wasn't going to be building them and people saying, well, if I only want to build five, you know, I mean, there are conditions that you have to be aware of because people are very protective of their intellectual properties as well. They should be, you know, if somebody were to say,

[01:03:41] hi, Chris, we're going to do a pinball machine based on you. Hope you don't mind. Goodbye. So long we're just going to be selling it to our 10 friends. I'm sure that you would step up saying, hey, time out, win him it. Seriously, really? No, you can't use my likeness.

[01:03:55] You know, or you probably be the worst game ever. They wouldn't even activate the flippers if it was a Canadian.

[01:04:02] It could be a switch between where you know, you want to have some control over how you are portrayed out in the real world. And so, right.

[01:04:11] Enterprise, and it doesn't have to be a pinball machine. It can be a t-shirt. It can be anything.

[01:04:16] Well, what's interesting with, and I work a lot with, with IP lawyers on a daily basis and IP infringement.

[01:04:23] When you see games like Buffy making the rounds that shows in the Matrix, right? These are obviously home-brew games that...

[01:04:29] Well, and they're one-off.

[01:04:31] Right.

[01:04:32] And I think from that standpoint, as long as you're not trying to do anything commercially with them, then sure.

[01:04:38] You know, knock yourself out.

[01:04:40] They sold some of those Matrix games at some point.

[01:04:43] But again, that means that I don't want to be aware of, but I think the occasion, as long as you're only doing it like this,

[01:04:50] and you're not going to go any further, but you also run the risk of, look, with the internet and everything else,

[01:04:58] and things are splashed around, and, you know, and the unlikliest places somebody may see something,

[01:05:04] where it's okay, time out. What's going on? Somebody is trying to capitalize on this property, on me, on my client, on whoever.

[01:05:13] Yeah, you run a risk of somebody coming in with a cease and desist wanting to sue you,

[01:05:19] and suddenly you're kind of like caught between a rock and a hard place,

[01:05:24] because maybe you didn't make an initial inquiry to the rights holder to say hi.

[01:05:29] Are there any games out there, Roger, that people know about where a cease and desist went out after a game was out,

[01:05:36] and things had to be altered or anything had to be removed?

[01:05:39] I mean, we saw the Camillo Bible on.

[01:05:42] You mentioned Predator before, yes, I mean, there was a cease and desist, you know, Kevin and I talked,

[01:05:48] and wanted to see if I could go in and salvage things, and it was basically too late,

[01:05:54] I was able at least to not have and get totally seen, but, you know, again, I think that the,

[01:06:02] the bus, he's getting sued now.

[01:06:05] Well, from other people, but I'm just saying that, you know, the key to all of it is that if you are going to do something

[01:06:12] as your own passion project, and you're going to display it out in the real world,

[01:06:17] it's not just going to be in your basement, because you want to show it off,

[01:06:21] it's kind of, I think, what do you have to lose by contacting the rights holder and say hi.

[01:06:30] I'm going to be stripping down an old sorts of fury, and I'm going to turn it into a Buffy the Vampire Slayer game,

[01:06:37] and it's only for me, is that okay?

[01:06:41] Right.

[01:06:42] And if the answer is yes, just as long as you don't do X, Y, and Z, or if the answer is no,

[01:06:49] then do your Buffy game, have it be in your basement, and your friends come by,

[01:06:54] tell them if they can't take any pictures on their iPhone or whatever else,

[01:06:58] and have it be a private enterprise.

[01:07:00] Right.

[01:07:01] But if you're going to be out there in the public, well, then guess what?

[01:07:06] Then that means that potentially you are out there unfettered,

[01:07:12] and somewhat having some potential liability that you wouldn't necessarily have to have.

[01:07:20] And I think the area, Roger, we saw, I think we see a lot more infringement in the world of modding for games, right?

[01:07:27] I think anyone seen 10 years ago, it was like, you could take anything,

[01:07:32] you could go buy a Gandalf inside a Toys or Us, and light up his staff,

[01:07:36] and resell it for a hundred bucks, and no one said a thing.

[01:07:40] And we've seen a real crackdown over the last couple of years in terms of licensing around the mod community,

[01:07:47] because these manufacturers pay a lot of money for that permission to associate with that license,

[01:07:54] and for the private sector to be able to capitalize without paying that license,

[01:07:59] as much as it sucks losing those mods, it sucks paying a lot of money,

[01:08:06] and then watching someone else make a lot of money off of something for free.

[01:08:09] Absolutely.

[01:08:11] Again, I mean, there needs to be a level of sensibility and sensitivity.

[01:08:16] Right.

[01:08:17] Well, Roger, we're on the hour period, which I told Josh I wouldn't go too far over,

[01:08:22] but one final question, because when we...

[01:08:24] Oh, sorry.

[01:08:25] No, it's good.

[01:08:26] This is good.

[01:08:27] I always try to keep the interviews around and out, but I definitely want to have you back on,

[01:08:30] because I think we could talk all night about pinball.

[01:08:32] Were you sad?

[01:08:33] I just need a little bit of a lot of words at Soma Apologies.

[01:08:36] No, this is great.

[01:08:37] It looks great.

[01:08:38] Believe me, my listeners listen to me rant and make so many supposition

[01:08:43] that to actually hear from someone who knows what they're talking about.

[01:08:47] You're going to get a thousand listens, at least, on this podcast.

[01:08:51] It'd be great.

[01:08:52] Were you sad to see, because I think that when we talk about themes and original pinball,

[01:08:57] I do think people are starving for originality.

[01:09:00] I also think beautiful games.

[01:09:03] I think artwork.

[01:09:04] I think lights.

[01:09:05] I think music.

[01:09:06] I think what really draws people into a pinball machine sort of lost its way in the last decade.

[01:09:12] And it's coming back with hand drawn art.

[01:09:15] When you saw what happened to John Papaduc, were you really sad to see a guy who,

[01:09:20] and you've probably worked with him in the past, but someone who has that sort of creative genius,

[01:09:26] but if it's not controlled, if it's not surrounded by people who know what they're doing,

[01:09:31] it can sputter out of control as it did with Zidware.

[01:09:35] But to lose someone who was a guy who came out with original themes that were gorgeous games,

[01:09:41] are you sad to see him sort of fall sort of into really a terrible place in terms of his standing with pinball?

[01:09:49] I think that John, unfortunately, thought that he could do something

[01:09:56] which he didn't have the complete capabilities of doing.

[01:10:00] Set himself up for a failure because he wasn't practical and realistic.

[01:10:06] And instead of biting the bullet sooner, he waited until it was later.

[01:10:11] And the net result is, yeah, I mean, that's kind of like a bad word.

[01:10:18] It's like swearing. Don't say that name. Don't say that word.

[01:10:22] American pinball starts up and immediately and originally to them or instantaneously,

[01:10:27] it's like, that's John Papaduc's game, that who did anything.

[01:10:31] And oh my god, they're gonna do magic, or all of them doing this and this and this.

[01:10:34] And we don't want this. We don't want this.

[01:10:36] How do you excise yourself away from that person?

[01:10:40] So it's a tragedy. It really is.

[01:10:43] I mean, if Shakespeare were alive today and he was looking at the tragic flaws of people,

[01:10:49] a fellow Hamlet and others, and he was somewhat curious and invested in wanting to do a pinball type of play,

[01:10:59] John would have been the perfect person to kind of centered it around in regard to doing almost everything the wrong way.

[01:11:07] With the best of intentions, I'm sure.

[01:11:09] But, you know, I think John found himself in the ocean and there wasn't a lifeboat around to rescue him.

[01:11:19] And he just flailed. So it is unfortunate because truthfully,

[01:11:24] and maybe left for a better time and I don't want to get into it now,

[01:11:30] all of us are getting older.

[01:11:32] And, you know, where's the next generation of designers?

[01:11:35] I mean, everybody can only go for so long and, you know,

[01:11:38] bless his heart, Steve Kordack was still kicking it well into his 90s.

[01:11:43] But the problem that you have is there isn't a new breed.

[01:11:46] You know, Jim Patlin and Greg Khmick came out of Gordon Tech as teenagers.

[01:11:51] And that was a local high school in the Chicago land area near the Valley factory.

[01:11:57] They were trained under Ted Zail.

[01:12:02] You know, that is the biggest concern because you have a finite number of people,

[01:12:08] no matter who you think and how you think of it in terms of anybody can design a pinball machine and so on.

[01:12:15] There is a skill, there is a craft to it.

[01:12:19] And I know there is a new higher earth stern who I was surprised to hear.

[01:12:25] It may not be as young as I thought he was.

[01:12:28] It doesn't mean that he is old.

[01:12:30] But again, I mean, where are the folks in their 20s and early 30s

[01:12:35] who are going to be that next era of designers and artists and programmers and so on?

[01:12:41] So I think with John, it is unfortunate because there was a wealth of creativity

[01:12:47] and project that he wanted to bring to life that unless it is done under some veil of secrecy

[01:12:55] and in this day and age it is very difficult to accomplish.

[01:12:59] They will never see the light.

[01:13:01] So it has become persona non grata.

[01:13:04] And it is sad.

[01:13:05] I have a bunch of photos from inside the Zidware factory and it literally is like

[01:13:11] Willy Wonka's sort of laboratory.

[01:13:14] I mean he had so many things going on at once and they are all amazing and they are all interesting.

[01:13:19] But they are all like 30% of the way there.

[01:13:22] And it is just sort of the sad part about it is.

[01:13:26] I remember going out there and visiting with John a few years back and seeing the setup.

[01:13:32] And it was like, wow, this is awesome.

[01:13:35] And look how organized and look how clean.

[01:13:37] Wow, you have a 3D printer and printing stuff and creating things and so on and so forth.

[01:13:43] And yeah, I mean it was a great thought process.

[01:13:50] But again, it is a tragedy.

[01:13:55] So I feel for John and I feel for the community that got burned unnecessarily by everything that took place.

[01:14:04] So let's get back to, let's end on a high note on a scale of 1 to 10 Roadster.

[01:14:09] How excited are you for Star Wars to make its way into the pinball world?

[01:14:13] Which will bring probably more people into pinball than any theme over the last like 10 to 15 years easily?

[01:14:21] You think so?

[01:14:22] Oh yeah, Star Wars.

[01:14:25] But it has been done before.

[01:14:27] But it has never been that good.

[01:14:30] Yeah, I know.

[01:14:32] Episode 1 really kind of left a lot to be desired.

[01:14:35] But the Stern games weren't bad.

[01:14:37] They weren't bad, but those games were for their hair.

[01:14:40] They didn't really come out when those movies came.

[01:14:43] I mean, it's the 40th anniversary of Star Wars.

[01:14:46] Star Wars is bigger now than ever before in terms of just its generational.

[01:14:51] The hope is that it will be a kick-ass game that it's going to have all the ingredients that everybody wants.

[01:14:59] Whether or not it's going to be focused on a new movie, whether it's going to be something that's focused on all three.

[01:15:05] It's the original three.

[01:15:06] It's the four right I know.

[01:15:08] So then the question becomes, is it still relevant for everybody if it's based on that?

[01:15:16] No.

[01:15:17] Because I'll look for something else again.

[01:15:20] So my hope is that, look, a license unto itself

[01:15:27] cannot make a bad game good.

[01:15:30] It cannot make a good game great.

[01:15:33] But it can absolutely enhance and embellish a great game.

[01:15:37] And what you need, absolutely positively, is just a killer layout and design.

[01:15:44] Deep and yet solid rules.

[01:15:48] And once you have that all together in your little melting pot.

[01:15:54] And you add the right license to it with all the necessary ingredients.

[01:15:59] Meaning whatever the talent might be, whatever the music and sound effects and so on.

[01:16:04] Once you can put all of that stuff together and you stir it all up, then you have magic.

[01:16:10] If any component of that fails, then you're less than totally and completely magical.

[01:16:16] But yeah, I mean, I have great hopes that they are going to achieve something that will, to your point,

[01:16:22] bring people in, cause a lot of excitement and anticipation.

[01:16:26] And maybe going back to one of my original points, maybe we'll find more of those games out in commercial operation, which benefits everybody.

[01:16:35] Roger, let's end on one final question.

[01:16:38] What two games do you think achieved that?

[01:16:42] Took a theme, integrated everything you talked about in terms of shots, design, music, you know, layout.

[01:16:51] Layout and just were magical.

[01:16:54] Like at the end of the day, it just nailed it and it all clicked.

[01:16:58] And you just look at that and you're like, you know what, that's the bar that when I look at bringing a theme into a pinball game, we're aiming for.

[01:17:05] I'm going to have to answer it with not just two.

[01:17:10] All right.

[01:17:12] I'll take my head off, because I don't want people thinking that I'm just a pure homer.

[01:17:19] And that's a home person, not homer from the Simpsons.

[01:17:24] I think that Jurassic Park, the original one, accomplished it from one of our competitors.

[01:17:31] I know that everybody is a Gaga over Simpsons party.

[01:17:37] And I think that was a really strong game.

[01:17:40] But the ones that stand out for me, Adam's family.

[01:17:45] I think that the timing and the ingredients, absolutely, Twilight Zone.

[01:17:51] And again, I'm not just picking Pat Waller games, but I think Twilight Zone, even the feedback from Carol Serling, Rod Serling's wife, was incredibly encouraging.

[01:18:00] And the artwork and all the touches, the subtleties, all the things that, you know, Larry and Ted and Pat were able to weave into that.

[01:18:09] Absolutely.

[01:18:11] I think Star Trek that we did next gen that Steve Richie did.

[01:18:19] I think accomplished that.

[01:18:22] A personal favorite of mine as well is what Mark Richie did with Indiana Jones.

[01:18:27] I'm being able to take all three movies and have them just dialed in.

[01:18:33] Artwork, gameplay, you know, whether people like the games that I just mentioned or don't.

[01:18:38] I think that some of those were the quintessential.

[01:18:41] I think that the first two all-virus games, and we'll see what happens in the third.

[01:18:47] I think that those really accomplished something in terms of really capturing the essence of Cassandra Peterson in a way that was incredibly personal to her.

[01:18:58] And I think that it really kind of showcased all of the things that we would associate with.

[01:19:07] Right. The instruments of the dark.

[01:19:09] So those are the ones that kind of come off the top of my head.

[01:19:11] I'm sure that I'm missing some others.

[01:19:13] But I think that those are all great.

[01:19:16] And I think, you know, what all those games prove is they've all decades later, 20 years later, are still talked about today, are still sought after, are still collected, and are still enjoyed after all these years.

[01:19:31] Which is really a testament to the magic that they brought when they came out.

[01:19:37] I mean, there's very few video games that people still want to play and enjoy 20 years after they come out.

[01:19:42] So it's an exciting time.

[01:19:46] We're excited for 2017 in Roger.

[01:19:48] I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.

[01:19:50] I know the listeners are going to love all of this.

[01:19:53] And hopefully we can get you back on the show again this year.

[01:19:56] Because I think a lot is going to transpire in 2017.

[01:20:00] And we're going to have a lot to talk about as we look at where this hobby goes this year, especially.

[01:20:05] I look forward to it.

[01:20:07] And I thank you for having the interest of wanting to talk to me.

[01:20:11] And again, hopefully that people enjoy what we discussed.

[01:20:17] I know they will. Roger, thank you and have a great night.

[01:20:20] You too. Take care.

[01:20:22] I need to see every time I know I'm only following.

[01:20:27] Nothing gonna stop me now.
