[00:00] Cause I'm D&D

[00:02] I'm dynamite

[00:04] D&D

[00:06] And I win the fight

[00:07] SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP, SIP

[00:11] Welcome to episode 474 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts coming at you

[00:17] From New York City, quarantined heavily

[00:20] Haven't been out in a long time

[00:22] Everyone's going a little stir crazy

[00:24] I think people are finally starting to catch on

[00:27] Starting to hear other good shows do good analysis of

[00:32] How we think this is all going to impact our lives and Pimball

[00:36] On this episode we're going to hear from Todd Tuckie of TNT

[00:39] Really great guy, needs your support so listen to that podcast and let's join

[00:44] Let's join in and helping Todd with his auction next week in Pimball

[00:48] Now here's the thing, here's the thing, I never said Stern was going to go out of business

[00:52] I never said Jersey Jack was going to go out of business

[00:55] But for those of you out there who just think it's going to be Pimball is normal and Pimball is usual

[01:00] I don't understand, I still don't understand that sort of

[01:03] Delusion that everything is just going to bounce back fine

[01:07] Let me read you an email I got to from Mr. BB

[01:09] He says I'm listening to this last podcast about how the Pimball industry is going to be

[01:15] In the tank and our economy will take longer than the financial crisis to get back

[01:20] You're completely wrong

[01:22] Domingo is totally wrong Stern is going out of business stops so many things wrong with this podcast

[01:28] I don't even know where to start but ultimately this economy is bring proactively stopped and when it's proactively started

[01:36] It's returning big time companies that are smartly managed have months worth of cushion and once the restrictions are lifted

[01:44] People are spending money and they'll be fine why because it's an artificial limit right now

[01:50] I just want to stop in it and analyze that for a minute in our it's the economy has been stopped

[01:55] We're going to come back fine

[01:57] It's going to turn itself back on and be stronger than ever and he knows this let me tell you something BB

[02:03] How are you proactively going to get all the people in the service industry?

[02:09] How are you going to get them all the money back that they're losing through this period of time?

[02:14] How are you going to do that?

[02:15] This is not like 2008 at all in 2008 last time I remember every bar restaurant lost Vegas every service industry in America

[02:25] Didn't have to shut down and close its doors and those people are out of work

[02:31] Unemployment skyrocketing unemployment wasn't this bad back then

[02:35] So how are you going to restart that how are you going to give people all of the lost wages that they're experiencing?

[02:42] How are you going to do that and if you think that Stern's buyers and all these pinball company buyer bases are going to

[02:49] Spring back to normal and then some you're completely wrong because here's the part that most people don't get

[02:55] The majority of Americans don't have money invested in the stock market that is not where you look to know where people are at

[03:04] financially the majority of Americans they rely on salary they rely on paychecks and a lot of that's about to be disrupted

[03:12] And all those jobs are about to be disrupted so how do you how do you like take that into account and the other part is

[03:19] The other thing that didn't happen in 2008 and correct me from wrong there we weren't piling up body bags

[03:25] The people weren't dying left and right there's also going to be there's going to be an atmosphere and there's going to be a reaction to this thing of

[03:34] Taking care of your family's health and the things that matter the most and it's not going to be

[03:39] Return to pinball immediately it still amazes me the the absolute

[03:46] Disregard for not it's just not just the financial thing that's going to happen

[03:52] It's the it's this psychological thing that's going to happen to people of sitting in their homes

[03:57] For weeks if not months while they watch all these people pass away and die from a pandemic

[04:05] That's not going away anytime soon and it might be something that we deal with

[04:10] seasonally for the rest of our lives like the flu

[04:14] 20,000 people die from the flu every year

[04:17] You don't really hear about it and most people still don't get flu shots, which is crazy

[04:22] But I'm just saying that this is different than anything ever before than anyone has seen ever before

[04:30] So yes, why I'm not an economist and can't perfectly predict the way things are gonna happen

[04:35] I don't think pinball is going to come back and be as healthy as it was before this and I'd be willing to bet my money on the fact

[04:43] That a lot of pinball companies that weren't successful before this are gonna struggle

[04:48] I would also predict that Stern sales are going to be down you think Stern's going to return from this and

[04:53] Have as many buyers as they did before this. I think that's absolutely incorrect now the other thing is this the other thing is this

[05:00] There are companies that are in trouble before this hit and I'm going to talk about that

[05:05] In a show coming up. I'm starting to do some research

[05:07] But I'm starting to see something happening in pinball that is gonna be of no surprise to anybody and where there's smoke

[05:15] There's fire and we've seen this story before and I don't know if you saw I don't know if you saw on

[05:22] Pinside inside the deep route thread

[05:25] There was stuff that started to be posted by people and and the pinside staff was starting to delete stuff and

[05:32] It's eerily reminiscent of what we saw with highway pinball and I'm just gonna say this and I mean this

[05:40] once again

[05:41] It looks like pinside and Robin and the moderators are

[05:46] Taking the side of the manufacturer and they're they're listening to cease and to cease threats and they're yanking stuff down

[05:55] And they're keeping the pinball community. They're keeping them

[05:59] They're silencing some of the naysayers that are surrounding deep-rooted pinball right now and it's starting to grow and

[06:08] I don't know what the facts are. I don't know what the truth is but I do know this in the history of pinball in the history of me covering this hobby

[06:17] Whenever there's been smoke whenever people have started to ring the alarm bells and scream fire a little bit

[06:25] It's always turned out to be true. Do you ever hear people saying

[06:30] Stern pinball is financially in trouble. Do you ever hear people saying like American pinballs running out of money?

[06:35] No, do you ever hear people saying

[06:37] Chicago gaming company isn't paying their employees? Do you ever hear that stuff? You don't hear that stuff

[06:43] Now when that stuff starts to percolate

[06:46] Here's always what happens

[06:48] Robin and the pinside staff they take the side of the manufacturer because all they want is their new pinball machine

[06:54] And the customers the customers they're not given the information they need but it happened and I didn't I didn't expect this to happen

[07:03] We were all expecting to see Raza on March 25th

[07:06] So why are we seeing this now? Why why are people starting to to light the spark?

[07:12] About doubt on whether or not deep route can do what they're gonna do now

[07:16] There's a lot of public information on deep roots

[07:18] I'm starting to look into some of it and see where things are in terms of

[07:22] Where their facilities are and are they still in Utah and what what's going on over there?

[07:27] All right, so let's talk about a little bit of news

[07:29] There's a new code for Ironman known really cares. It's like great. Lime in

[07:33] Polishes games forever who cares about Ironman code if you have an Ironman great

[07:37] But that's not really news game is so old Jurassic Park topper is about to come out once again Stern pinball succeeds and getting a

[07:43] Topper out within five years of a game being released so congratulations on that

[07:47] Ninja Turtles will be delayed until in an indefinite date

[07:50] And there's no news come in but Todd Tucky will join the show right now

[07:55] So we're gonna give you guys some news and we're gonna figure out stuff to talk about

[07:59] But it's gonna get real thin real soon

[08:02] Don't know what the other shows are gonna analyze and talk about moving forward, but man

[08:07] It's it's dry. It's a dry landscape, but I'm telling you the real story the real story out there is

[08:14] What's happening to some of these manufacturers as they try to weather this storm and will some of them

[08:19] Who've had calamities occur well before COVID are they gonna use COVID as a way to sort of

[08:27] bail out and use it as an excuse we will see there's more coming on this

[08:31] I love it when I can start to go on a little bit of an investigative journey to see what's going on within these companies

[08:38] Ladies and gentlemen Todd Tucky. I want to welcome to Canadian's pinball podcast

[08:43] Probably the personality that is even bigger than mine in this hobby Mr. Todd Tucky from TNT amusements Todd welcome to the show

[08:50] Hey greetings

[08:52] Good evening

[08:53] Good evening we've we've been wanting to do this for a while and I must say and I don't often say this but I've been a

[09:00] Big fan of yours well before I even got into pinball really because I know you from the arcade scene

[09:06] Wow, so you've been following for years then huh?

[09:09] Well, I went from Klauve and then I got banned from Klauve

[09:13] So then I migrated over to Pinn's side and

[09:16] Became a pinhead got banned from there and now I'm doing this little this little podcast gig

[09:22] So where do we want to start?

[09:23] So for those of you who don't know Todd let's give a real quick

[09:27] Summary of of TNT amusements for listeners of the show who might and I'm there

[09:31] I don't know who could possibly not know who you are at this point

[09:34] But let the listener know TNT amusements what you guys do and and your connection to pinball and the coin op scene

[09:41] Well TNT amusements started

[09:44] The official business in 79 where I bought games to put them in locations 100% of the business was to vend them and do a split

[09:54] Which was always 50 50 in almost every case was to make money

[09:58] So we bought games we operated them there was no real love for the games just a fascination

[10:05] When especially when a new game came at you were like excited, but it was no

[10:11] collectible type of thing it was there were strictly money makers and

[10:15] The business fell on a hard times everybody was gone out of business by 83 84 the games were done

[10:22] You couldn't put a game in any corner store

[10:25] I mean you sold games everywhere they were popping up everywhere and people were addicted the home games came out and

[10:32] People finally had enough they it was the same old thing they same release

[10:37] Just another fighter and another cabinet and they stopped playing them so my partner and I were worried

[10:45] got all these games not in locations broke and

[10:48] Rolled a game into my end of my driveway and a long driveway in Northeast Philadelphia

[10:54] Lots of traffic on our road and put a big four sales sign on that in a couple others and that started the business in summer

[11:01] Four months I sold over 400 games out of my driveway

[11:05] Wow during during the week I covered it with tarp polins

[11:09] We sold a ton of games and so your business

[11:12] It has always been primarily for the home buyer. Yes my legs

[11:18] Operation my last location I closed in 2013 I had a

[11:23] Laundromat a good hundred miles away from TNT

[11:27] But it was on a Jersey route. I had a new Jersey route

[11:31] It was the last location and Kurt went there about every six weeks and collected and the collections were always loud

[11:38] We had four games there. I said you know what every time we got a break down that would cover the repair

[11:43] Whatever was in the machines

[11:45] So that was our final location though we closed forever the route in

[11:51] 2013 and a hundred percent of the money is

[11:54] Generated by the sales to homes also one day rentals we do weekend rentals and

[12:01] We do a lot of birthday party business our birthday party business is

[12:05] probably about 12 to 15 percent of our income and

[12:10] That's it. It's a pretty much all home sales and we offer the trade-ins

[12:14] So we're getting our games back all the time if you had to take a guest Todd how many

[12:20] Pinball machines do you think you've sold to people over the years? Well, I it's probably less of a guessing matter

[12:27] We have sold over 27,000 machines

[12:32] since we've been open

[12:34] And that's that's pinball

[12:36] No both video

[12:38] Fuseball tables we were selling ping pong full tables for a while and pinball but pinball numbers are

[12:46] Pretty high that we sold over a hundred pinbots for instance

[12:51] Different ones and we're not talking brand new. It's easy to sell a brand new game you open the box

[12:56] You sell it you make a couple hundred but with a

[13:00] Reconditioned or a used machine or we sell some stuff as is too

[13:04] That's a lot of pinbots a hundred of them

[13:06] One two three four five six seven nine ten lots of things if you start counting them

[13:10] You can kind of visualize the number. Yeah, why do you think that that title has been so popular for people to want it in their home

[13:17] It's simple. It's one of the greatest games ever made Todd. Do you distribute new inbox games right now?

[13:23] Oh, yeah, yeah, we get them through

[13:26] Mike automated services this wonderful man in Connecticut. He's such a great guy and

[13:33] We have Mike's machines. So

[13:36] We're not a distributor, but we're selling Mike's machines basically and but we'll deliver them set them up and service them and

[13:43] It's nice because it's another another arm of

[13:47] Of his his reach. He's pretty big on the east coast

[13:50] He I mean he's huge. He's got most of New England locked down. I hear Mike is like the guy and the best part is about Mike

[13:57] You dial his phone number and he's extension 16 you that's right to his phone

[14:03] You'll pick up the phone. He'll talk to you

[14:05] You won't set push you off when somebody else he will make the sale right to you

[14:10] You're not going through like 50 other people

[14:12] So we brought a pinbot and how the game was simple and people could jump on and enjoy it

[14:17] How do you feel about modern pins? They've obviously become more complex a little bit more confusing with the more the deeper codes in the games

[14:26] Do you feel like that?

[14:27] Turns people on or do you ever feel like that makes it hard for some of the new to pinball people to get into these games?

[14:33] Well, that that's a tough one

[14:35] It's interesting because I see it happen here when we do the parties

[14:40] I can have Gottlieb's close encounters with the third kind system one and

[14:46] Right next to it. I can have Jurassic Park the new one and the people will play both

[14:52] It's like what and they're on a free play here. So mine is not like they're putting a quotas in

[14:58] But a lot of the people they're attracted to the artwork

[15:02] There's a whole bunch of things that go on play in the artwork the theme of the game what it is and

[15:07] That's what they're into at that particular time

[15:11] So somebody can really get into an old dull game like close encounters of their kind and then once they understand the rules and how simple

[15:21] The game is to learn they like it. They actually like it and I have this people tell me the same thing when they come into buy a game

[15:28] I so

[15:30] That Jurassic Park is too complicated

[15:32] Show me something else and you hear the opposite feedback from a lot of the newer home buyers is

[15:38] Some of the games that have simple rules that are easy to understand if you were to own that game and have it in your house every day

[15:44] Might get boring quickly. Yeah, but it doesn't explain why we go out and do service

[15:50] But remember I've had games in people's houses since 1984 and I still have the records

[15:55] Curl go out to a service call on a f14 Tomcat we sold in 1988 and they love it

[16:02] It's 40 years later for goodness sakes. Oh, we love this game. So I don't get it either

[16:09] It's it but I have my favorites. I kept the same games of my house all those years

[16:14] Right, you know, what's your favorite pinball machine if you had a beyond an island with just one big bang big bang bar

[16:22] Yeah, are you do you feel like it's gonna be remade? Are you waiting Chicago gaming company is teased that that might be one of the ones they remake

[16:29] I think they'd be foolish not to but it would ruin the values

[16:34] I think of the original machine

[16:37] Because they can do a lot more with the LEDs now. I mean who would want an original monster bash when you can buy the new

[16:45] That that incredible new Chicago gaming one. Yeah, that's always been the quagmire of the collectible hobby right is

[16:53] Some of these games are collectible because they were rare and they had their time on the production line and it's hard to find a good one

[17:01] Especially game like big bang bar where they were hardly any and then they what they remade 200 of them right when they

[17:08] 200 and you have one of those remakes. Well, I did but I sold it. Okay, it's as America

[17:16] Really okay, so all over the world right people who are collecting pinball machines that game has been

[17:21] Heralded it as one of the greatest collectible pinball machines and a lot of the reasons why it's beautiful to look at it's it's got a

[17:29] Sexy grown-up theme to it which was rare for a lot of pinball machines and I think you're right because if they decide to make another

[17:35] Thousand of them or 1500 all of a sudden it's no longer that sought after

[17:41] Collectible it could be but there are still some people

[17:45] That want the original you know, let's face it everybody would love to have the real Mona Lisa in their house

[17:51] But they're gonna have to settle for a print or they'll settle for one that has oil flourishes to it

[17:58] There's all different versions of the Mona Lisa you can buy but if you want the original baby

[18:03] Yeah, it was for sale. It sure as hell wouldn't be cheap

[18:07] Do you think that matters in pinball because that that debate does pop up the the difference in value between an

[18:14] Original medieval madness and a medieval madness remake and do you think the value of the original should be a little bit higher than the remakes?

[18:22] I think they'll always be

[18:24] Someone that wants the original original because we're seeing it now with the arcade games the arcade one-ups for instance

[18:34] I mean how do you feel about those things arcade one-ups are one of the greatest things that could happen to

[18:40] The gaming business because they are introducing the greatest

[18:46] Classic games of all time to a whole brand new generation that would never be able to see or play them

[18:52] Unless they play them on those wretched main things or yeah, then they happen to be near a classics arcade

[18:59] They're wonderful because at rampage you play rampage in your arcade one-up. It's great

[19:05] But boy if you find an original that's in good condition with the original joysticks, okay?

[19:12] That's my stipulation the leaf switch joysticks is sober ball one the Monroe their Monroe joysticks just came to me

[19:20] The game is just it's like playing a Cadillac as opposed to G, you know

[19:26] Absolutely even you know there's nothing like yeah, I'm a street fighter guy

[19:29] Nothing like hopping on an original street fighter with the original capcom joysticks

[19:34] You'll never get the same feedback or feel with any modern recreations

[19:39] I think what's interesting about the one-ups is to your point

[19:42] They're introducing a whole new generation and it's affordable right these kids can learn Ninja Turtle for player game

[19:48] In a somewhat similar

[19:50] Cabinet and and feel and atmosphere that their parents learned it and then

[19:56] They might love the game so much. They want to go get the original right and they and they fall in love with the game

[20:01] I had that happen

[20:04] This winner somebody played they had an arcade one-up

[20:08] In one of the resort homes they rented for like a weekend and they wanted to buy one that they didn't want an arcade one-up

[20:15] They wanted the original game

[20:17] So uh that was a centipede they wanted a real centipede and they got it and I actually got a sale because of an arcade one-up

[20:24] Which some people say we were probably losing sales. Yes. I've been we've delivered games to homes

[20:30] Where they have three real arcade games and they have you know 12 of these little arcade one-up things

[20:36] Right you know on the risers. So yes, we're probably losing money here

[20:41] But we're gaining brand new players and you know what else is happening those same players will

[20:48] Go to the classic arcade as they get built

[20:51] Unfortunately the classic are keys are under a lot of strain right now because they're not open

[20:57] Right

[20:58] Yeah, let's talk about that and you know obviously there's no way to

[21:02] Simulate pinball the same way the one-up source simulating arcade games, but to your point of

[21:07] Arcades are closing down barcades every the whole world is closing down and I just did a show today earlier on about

[21:15] The calamity that is now at the shores of pinball manufacturers and collectors and operators and distributors

[21:22] So Todd how are you feeling Todd with the new norm that is sweeping through the hobby

[21:29] Are how are you been impacted and what do you think the outcomes gonna be for a lot of these people that will be affected by this?

[21:35] I laid all our guys off

[21:37] Right now. I'm actually I got three guys here volunteering

[21:42] We're trying to like close up blue sends. We have a lot of loose ends

[21:47] You know games that were paid for or almost paid for and we're getting them done so the trucks can pick them up

[21:54] So and we do we did we just did a

[21:57] A bargain basement where people go by stuff as is and that's done well because people have been coming and

[22:04] picking stuff up so they have some of the play we're not doing anything to them. We're basically saying I'm working, but as is

[22:11] But you know the big problem is is what do you do when all the as is going games are going and I'm telling you I am by lowest inventory

[22:21] I've ever had

[22:23] Because I can't buy anything new because we can't go out pick anything up

[22:28] I don't know what's gonna happen in two weeks, but you know

[22:31] I figured I'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but a lot of people don't

[22:36] You know where you know the especially the classic arcades that have had to close

[22:42] Steve splinter vant Steve and splinter that owns the

[22:46] Gamesium he was doing really well packed up, but he's an effort at Pennsylvania

[22:51] opened up a classics arcade a 20 years old. You open this place up and

[22:56] Over a hundred games hundreds of the games and they were doing great packed with people packed

[23:02] I couldn't believe it

[23:03] Yeah, neither could he actually

[23:05] Him and his wife were really surprised at how well it's doing, but

[23:09] He's just sitting he doesn't know what to do because the rent still do

[23:14] Right come up with a rent now they he says he made enough money that and he saved it. He's he's a big saver

[23:21] He's you know he manages his money very well and

[23:26] He's okay for now, but I think all of us were kind of thinking

[23:30] This stuff was gonna be over in a month and that's not happening

[23:35] You know and right and we were all we were all ready to a lot of people were ready to board planes to tpf

[23:41] A lot of people were well

[23:43] We might miss tpf, but midwest gaming classic will happen and stern will show us ninja turtles in a few weeks and and everything just stopped like

[23:52] Like a light switch got turned off and the world we knew it is no longer there and and the end date is nowhere near

[24:01] You actually said it you actually said it on your show

[24:06] When you said you said it

[24:08] What are we going to do

[24:11] After the twippy's are over

[24:14] You remember saying that yeah, I do and well here here we are after the twippy so and I agree I'm

[24:20] At well and on my show today. I said I think every single pinball content creator

[24:27] Has a week or two more to tie up loose ends whether it's interviews or you know

[24:32] I love talking to you Todd and it's been long overdue

[24:35] But once you turn off the new inbox

[24:39] Stream of games

[24:41] You turn off pin side

[24:43] It I mean you'll you'll have the club threads

[24:46] Every week that goes by

[24:48] People will lose interest because they don't have that much to look forward to

[24:52] Right and stuff was what kept things really really cook and the excitement of that brand new game

[24:59] Yep

[25:00] You're right you're a hundred percent right because we kept waiting

[25:04] Wow, what's new what are they coming up with it was a big secret, you know

[25:08] Somebody thinks it's this and all that's kind of disappeared

[25:12] And the cycle Todd of I can buy a game I can play it

[25:16] I can enjoy it if another game comes out in three to four months

[25:19] I can sell this game and not lose too much money and beyond to the next new new product and

[25:26] When all that comes to a screeching halt it almost reminds me like of where pinball was and arcade collecting was

[25:33] Sort of like right after the arcades closed in the late 90s right we might get back to a period in which

[25:40] If there's not new manufacturing going on at scale

[25:44] People are gonna then

[25:45] Start to look at it like well. This is what we got right now right for a long time like these are the games

[25:50] There's a stranger things might be the last stern game we get in a very long time

[25:54] And here's a really funny thing. I haven't played it yet. I've got three brand new and all three models in my warehouse

[26:00] But things kind of shut down and I never got a chance to open any of them

[26:06] Um and and they might become here's it here's it

[26:09] Here's the crazy thing and and you've seen this happen before

[26:13] God forbid things don't take a turn for the better for these manufacturing companies those stranger things in those boxes

[26:20] Might become some of the most sought after games ever

[26:25] That could be but you know this will end it really will

[26:29] Um, it has to we can't we can't live like this right we can't live in our

[26:34] In our homes as prison cells and we can't quarantine a species that is meant to connect with each other

[26:40] Yeah, and you're right and I think sooner or later this is all gonna come to an end. We'll be back to normal

[26:48] It has to when do you think I know we all have an opinion about when we think that will be right and I think from world leaders to doctors

[26:56] To pinball fanatics

[26:58] What what's your gut telling you? I know we and everyone's opinions different

[27:02] So there's no right or wrong answer because nobody really knows the answer

[27:05] But what are you thinking when you think we might start to get a little bit back to normal with this thing?

[27:09] I'm hearing about these

[27:13] possible cures. I mean Johnson and Johnson says there's a year away from the tested one

[27:20] But people are experimenting now

[27:23] With different things and I think people will try them

[27:26] uh, especially if they're like you know one death store and

[27:32] Possibly somebody will come up with the right combination

[27:36] The the other thing we never thought about is it's this is like the flu

[27:41] And there is a flu season so this season could suddenly end

[27:47] It could

[27:49] And some people say oh, well no, it's not the heat because it's hot in Florida and they still have it there and I say well

[27:54] Yes, but it's still season

[27:58] And it is like a flu, you know maybe maybe that

[28:03] Yeah, there's just so much we don't know right and and I think everyone is now

[28:08] Sitting at home hopefully or in their shop quarantine like you are right now Todd and I think we're just trying to figure out

[28:16] How do I plan for the worst but expect the best and and that's sort of like all we can do right now

[28:22] And I'm doing that with my personal life with my job with my

[28:26] Pinball podcast. I mean this is the to me this is

[28:29] This has always been a creative outlet and I don't want to give up the show

[28:33] But I also I've always said this I don't want to just

[28:36] Talk to talk I don't want to just make content

[28:39] Because I feel obligated to feel the airwaves

[28:42] I do want there to be relevant things to talk about and I do think that's going to come to an end pretty damn soon

[28:49] Yeah, cuz I don't want this show to be it's not a show about restorations. It's not a show about

[28:53] There's no more tournaments to talk about. There's no more league play going on. There's

[28:57] There's really just if you got games in your home be lucky that you have them because I ordered a Rick and Morty Todd

[29:04] And I can't even get it and it's like built but spooky can't even get into work now to ship games

[29:10] Wow, it's crazy. I have a friend Paul that said he would

[29:14] Uh be able to get it take delivery of it if you wanted to he's uh

[29:18] We call him cop Paul. He's volunteers here at tmd

[29:21] He's in Jersey because I thought that's possibly what you need to do you could get it to New York

[29:27] Interesting. Well, and and then here's the hard part with with every scenario, right

[29:32] It's like you just don't know like it's hard for me. I want I want him to be safe

[29:37] I don't want him to be at risk to go get a pinball machine, right and and that's sort of like

[29:43] This period in which we all have to be

[29:45] Selfless and not

[29:48] Try and put ourselves at harm because of something we personally want to do that we don't want to give up and also put other people in jeopardy

[29:56] Over something like a pinball machine. So I am doing my best to adhere to

[30:01] What our leaders are telling us which is don't go out unless it's necessary to walk Bubba is necessary to get groceries is necessary

[30:09] But that's about it. I am not I'm not going for joy rides in the demon

[30:13] I'm not jogging around Central Park. I'm

[30:16] Home watching a lot of Netflix and

[30:19] Imagine a pinball machine here. You could watch my channel. You know, I know

[30:24] Are so are you still making content and how frequently are you doing it? Well, uh

[30:29] Yes, I

[30:31] The games going out with my volunteers were filming brief videos on them and putting them together

[30:38] I'm working on do you know their little replicades the little tiny table

[30:44] Yep, um, I just finished

[30:46] Well, actually we filmed it probably three weeks ago on the new street fighter to champ and I never opened up the cabinet

[30:54] So one of my guys yesterday last night we filmed the rest of it the it's the middle of the is when you put a show together

[31:02] It's bits and bobs, but it could be recorded over two three four week period

[31:07] You finally get it in together. So I will be putting that video up

[31:10] And I still have incredibly great footage from one and two years ago. I never edited

[31:18] We have a complete tear down of a six million dollar man that we presented as a seminar

[31:25] in

[31:26] The pinfest two years ago

[31:28] A fantastic fantastic and stir bridge

[31:31] They did film it, but so few people saw it so with my channel I can get this thing out

[31:37] I think I'll probably have thousands of views great because it's really detailed on

[31:43] taking a part as a

[31:45] Valley

[31:46] 70s game late 70s and how to restore it

[31:50] There's a lot of detail a lot of close-ups, but I think it'll be really interesting the seminar was great

[31:55] But we had a packed room, but only 50 people saw it because that's all the room held right now Todd

[32:02] You said you had to let some of your workers go

[32:04] Is TNT amusements is it shutting down for a while? Can you stay in business through this? Oh, yeah, yeah

[32:12] We have almost a thousand things up when greed bay

[32:16] Um, I just signed up with Dean

[32:20] Wenzel to do an auction in two weeks

[32:24] We're gonna do a live auction here at TNT

[32:29] There's only a couple of us here, of course, but we'll be doing that

[32:33] Because Tim, you know Tim one of the twins

[32:37] He just left New York City. He is two-week quarantine when he gets back to his house of Maryland

[32:44] And then once that quarantine's finished

[32:47] They're gonna come here and stay in a hotel and help out him and his brother

[32:52] They were they were laid off but laid off with pay and

[32:56] So we expect to continue to operate in a very small manner

[33:02] Still operate and you'll keep our distance. That sort of thing

[33:06] As we can

[33:08] So you're you're getting creative with some new new fundraising efforts and and doing all you can

[33:13] I mean we all have to adapt to the new reality and it's gonna

[33:17] It's gonna force all of us to to think of new ways in which we can generate revenue

[33:21] especially

[33:22] People who are are making their livelihood in this business which you are Todd

[33:26] So I think have you ever thought about doing any have there been any go fun me set up for TNT that our current

[33:32] Leopold there if people wanted to donate to TNT right now

[33:35] Uh, I didn't do that because I don't think we've reached that

[33:41] level or that point I think this auction will be great

[33:45] Uh

[33:46] Because we're gonna put a ton of stuff up both Pimble and video

[33:50] I have something really need a um

[33:54] Uh, I bid on it and wanted that a Pimble Expo children's wish during the banquet

[34:00] They used to have a children's wish auction

[34:03] and this was um

[34:05] Given to the designer of bonsai run

[34:09] A in a ward that lights up

[34:11] And it's inscribed bonsai run because it was a big big hit. Was that Pat Lawler or am I making that up?

[34:17] No, it wasn't Pat. I'm trying to think of who it was now. It's off hand uh

[34:23] I have it on that door. I should have had that material ready, but I'm gonna

[34:27] Put that up. Uh, I paid I think $354 at the auction

[34:31] But I would think since it's one of a kind

[34:34] Um, it should fetch pretty good money

[34:38] Uh, I don't know. I figured that would be something who especially a bonsai run fan

[34:43] And since I bought that gosh, wouldn't it? I bid on that that would have been in the 90s

[34:48] Uh, bonsai runs of course become extremely popular and desirable

[34:52] So it's Larry DeMar and Pat Lawler. Can he does know something about him?

[34:59] Patty my pat

[35:01] Yeah, there's something I have I did an impromptu

[35:05] Interview with Pat Lawler at the pinball expo I with my cell phone of all things and uh

[35:12] It's really great, but I never got it posted that was uh in um

[35:16] October this past October

[35:18] So that's another thing I want to you've got a bunch of content that will keep your channel exciting and in your

[35:25] content always great and Todd, I think people love about your content

[35:28] Is it's always you and you bring your your larger than life personality into the videos and you don't you sort of speak your mind

[35:35] Now you've done a lot of tours of different pinball facilities and manufacturing

[35:40] Locations I saw one with American pinball. You've obviously been to stern. You've been to Jersey jack

[35:47] Which one of the manufacturers are were you most impressed by and what was it like what was your takeaway like from the big the big

[35:53] Manufactures in the pinball industry when you visited them

[35:56] Well every every factory we always had a lot of fun

[36:00] We couldn't film it starting in October, but we had a lot of fun on that tour. That was a terrific tour

[36:07] I wish we could have filmed it

[36:08] But there was a time when they let you

[36:10] But there there a lot of people are worried about secrets or the wrong thing getting photographed or whatever

[36:17] And uh which is understandable I filmed

[36:20] The data east factory when they were making the simpsons and nobody had a video camera that day

[36:28] They only had stills and I have my home

[36:31] Uh video tour the tour

[36:35] I wish I filmed more now of course, but

[36:38] I used to buy a good Sony camera that had a great zoom on it

[36:42] So I could get close up as they made the assemblies of the simpsons and I don't think anybody has any footage of any sort of

[36:51] Data east when they were operating as a factory. I mean, I'm sure they took a little bit

[36:57] But this was really neat watching the assembly process and uh, I got picture of the only two checkpoints

[37:06] Manufactured they were test and they were never released because they didn't like they didn't make a lot of money

[37:11] And then they were rushed into production as a first dot matrix game from that east

[37:16] But I have pictures and video of the two alpha

[37:20] numeric ones

[37:22] On a shelf in the back of the uh

[37:25] Their warehouse and back then they didn't really care they had a lot of fun with the uh

[37:30] The guests

[37:31] They covered up a machine and had a green flashing late under it

[37:36] Uh, and that was rumored to be the teenage mitten and jitterdals

[37:40] That east pinball at the time

[37:42] Because turtles was big right and uh, and you knew that right like they would tease hey

[37:49] That's turtles under there, but they wouldn't show you and it wasn't like it was a mystery

[37:52] What was the next game right everybody speculated and I do that in the video

[37:57] Uh, if you ever get a chance to watch the video

[38:00] Um

[38:01] On youtube. It's gotten a lot of views. We also toured the alvin g and company

[38:08] factory

[38:09] I don't have a lot of that footage unfortunately, but that was kind of neat because um

[38:14] Once again that that was only open a couple of years, I guess and then they closed

[38:19] What games came out of out of that factory virtually nothing mystery castle

[38:25] Was the mainly 175 of them I think uh

[38:29] It was a couple hundred um pistol pokers

[38:33] Which is definitely an oddball western theme dinosaur eggs was a redemption pinball

[38:39] That was it was pretty awful

[38:42] But it was supposed to be a ticket-making machine, but it was still actually a pinball machine with pinballs

[38:47] Uh, and I think I bought them brand new in the box for 600 of peace

[38:51] And I had them in the showroom and I think I was selling them for 1199 or something

[38:56] But in 2006 I actually had one at a uh

[39:00] One of the um pinball shows for sale still in the box

[39:04] And I think it was I was trying to just get my 600 out of it or something

[39:08] I don't even know if I sold it but prices have changed so much what what are your thoughts pinball machines are now

[39:15] New inbox

[39:16] $6,000 is usually your base level all the way up now to

[39:21] 12,5

[39:22] 15,000 maybe for like a

[39:24] Elvira with a piece of couch like what are your thoughts on these prices? Well, uh, I think it was brilliant

[39:32] I've got a stern if it was his idea to come up with three versions of a pinball

[39:37] I think it was a terrific idea because it lets people get in on an entry level

[39:42] I'll tell you today somebody was talking to me was gonna buy a monster's

[39:46] And he wants it to put it in a store and he said

[39:49] Should I get the one with the basement? I said no get get the regular edition

[39:53] It's less to to go wrong if you have people pounding on it all day

[39:58] And he doesn't know anything about fixing pinballs. It's just like a new location. It's a nice cream store

[40:03] I suggest to getting the basic edition the pro

[40:07] Some people call that the operators pinball machine that operators would buy

[40:11] This is a lower price and there's less to break less to go wrong

[40:17] When it's being hammered in a private home these machines should never break down that and they're they're so durable

[40:24] I was just telling somebody today. I've had a Beatles in my show room now

[40:29] For who?

[40:31] I'm gonna say at least a year and the only thing that's gone bad on it are the rubbers

[40:37] Now these games are built to last and they're and I had a Batman 66 for two years in my apartment

[40:42] And nothing went wrong

[40:43] I had one node board that needed to be replaced which was a two-minute

[40:47] Pop it in and out job and the game was perfect for that entire time

[40:51] The three-tiered system Todd has worked phenomenally well for Stern phenomenally well and and are you surprised when you see

[40:59] Other companies come out like American pinball and they they don't do the three-tier system even though it's proven to be so successful

[41:06] Well, I did ask them in that in that I published that new video of a tour of American pinball

[41:12] Which was filmed in October and I used my regular camera not the cell phone

[41:18] I asked them in that with their next pinball their third pinball which as we all know now is hot wheels

[41:24] Would that have extra versions?

[41:27] And he said they were talking about they were thinking and doing it and that would have been October

[41:32] So I don't know if the hot wheels

[41:35] Has been released with three versions now it currently is just one they have a it's $6,300

[41:41] And it's more so they're kind of just releasing it as a pro version if you look at where Stern games fall and in the price

[41:48] Yes sort of window for a company like them they're making the game more for operators than they've said that

[41:54] Knowing where we are with the world and operators are freezing operations and

[42:00] Do you feel like it's the worst time maybe in what you've seen in the pinball marketplace to launch a new game?

[42:06] Oh my god, yeah

[42:08] So sad it's such bad timing

[42:11] It's such bad timing for this to happen at this time because people aren't thinking of

[42:18] You know they can't see it at a show

[42:21] The excitement seems to be gone when the new pinball appears now

[42:25] I think all this will come back. I really do think all the excitement about new games and such will return

[42:33] When this crisis finishes it runs it's route

[42:36] Right wait if that's going to be the end of the summer, you know

[42:40] Yeah, it's kill the summer market the summer

[42:44] Sure season where you make a lot of money the boardwalks generate a ton of money with these games

[42:50] Um with the vacation in crew. I mean anybody anywhere

[42:54] That have these machines out for the summer some of them depend on the summer income to pay off the machine

[43:01] And then in the winner when it's slower, you know, they use the summer profits to pay their bills

[43:06] It's going to be interesting right because there's a there's going to be a balancing of

[43:10] Winners and losers through this period because

[43:13] The operators are not going to get the summer traffic

[43:16] But you're also going to have home buyers if they don't lose their jobs

[43:20] They're not going to be spending money on vacations this year because they can't really travel

[43:26] And so they're going to have a lot of pent up

[43:28] Money and they're going to want to get back to something that excites them after they've been cooped up inside for months

[43:34] So you might actually have an eager buyer base

[43:39] From the home people but I do think and I said this on my show earlier today

[43:43] Coming out of this crisis people are going to start to save more and realize the fragility

[43:48] Of our lifestyle choices and if we're to paycheck the paycheck

[43:52] On a monthly basis

[43:54] Maybe buying a pinball machine is something you're going to defer to a better time again

[44:00] Yeah, that could work both ways. I tell tell you what I think will happen

[44:04] I think a lot of people are going to start storing food

[44:08] That can that can keep

[44:10] They're going to buy cases of stuff

[44:12] That they can store in case

[44:15] There's a some kind of a shortage down the road

[44:18] And we're here all the stuff with the farmers are having troubles now

[44:22] Yeah

[44:23] Wasn't that what happens in the movie interstellar?

[44:26] It can't be all doom and gloom

[44:27] There has to be like Gandalf at the top of the hill on the fifth day that's going to come down

[44:32] And restore the world to its previous normalcy

[44:36] So yeah, we don't I don't think we end like this. I don't

[44:40] Todd you know the new titles rumored our guns and roses

[44:45] We've got toys story after that possibly from Jersey jack we've got ninja turtles

[44:50] We've got the mystery company of deeproot but amongst the rumored titles ninja turtles guns and roses

[44:57] Which are you excited by those themes?

[44:59] How do you think those themes will do in the pinball world when we get back to people buying?

[45:04] Well, I think Toyster would be a big hit. I see I don't know about guns and roses

[45:08] We already have a really good data east one. Do we really need another one?

[45:12] I don't know I mean Jersey jack stuff is such such beautiful stuff

[45:18] Then I'm sure it's going to be the first rate job

[45:21] But I don't know I you have to be pretty much I think you'd have to be a guns and roses fan

[45:28] To want one

[45:29] But

[45:30] Since there's already one out there couldn't they have picked out a different group?

[45:33] I don't know I mean yeah, and that's the second sort of theme that

[45:37] Jack has remade if you consider the hobbit to be Lord the Rings

[45:42] in the same vein of the same

[45:44] Narrative and and franchise

[45:47] So but I do think that there are millions of guns and roses fans

[45:51] But to your point if you're a pinball fan and a gunzer roses fan

[45:55] You've been able to get your hands on a gunzer roses pinball machine and have had one

[46:00] For years so this machine is definitely going to improve upon it right?

[46:04] It's going to have modern sound modern lights modern everything and Eric who's designing it

[46:08] We saw what he did with pirates side that people are expecting big things from this game

[46:13] Yeah, I wouldn't think that'd be a real hit. I always was wondering why

[46:17] The pirates didn't take off

[46:19] Well, that was just launched it had launch problems it sort of blew up on the launch pad

[46:24] When it when they revealed the game everybody wanted one

[46:27] I remember it was at expo and I don't know if you it was 2000

[46:31] I want to say 17

[46:33] Jack showed it and the world everyone went bonkers remember there was like it was like a dark day for stern and Jersey jacket

[46:39] Just taken over and then they removed the discs from the game and they removed the the treasure chest and all of a sudden it started just become

[46:48] We have to reengineer what we already showed and I they just never fully recovered from that

[46:54] But now that the game is out there

[46:56] It just took over and if you saw this Todd it's the number one ranked game

[47:00] On the pinside top 100 now it's like a 9.4 and he can't get one

[47:05] No, and so do you think jack if he moves into his new Chicago facility

[47:10] Do you think he reruns pirate to the Caribbean? Do you think he'd be an idiot not to knowing that it's so popular and people want it

[47:17] And why not give the people what they want

[47:19] Yeah, I think I think with the new line

[47:23] He's gonna and he's there's gonna be a lot of people in Chicago

[47:27] Better more familiar with assembly

[47:30] So the mistakes and the errors can be fixed right away

[47:34] So you don't have production problems

[47:37] I don't see why he couldn't put them back on the line like you could make more habits if he needed them make more dialed in's or wizards

[47:44] Um and stern stern is proven that works

[47:48] Yeah, it's another brilliant move by Gary is the

[47:52] um the vault the vault additions

[47:55] Um absolutely

[47:57] The gonna vault the uh lord of the rings um this

[48:01] That rumor that in tron have been the rumors forever and they're both gonna come out the day after I die

[48:08] But uh if they if they vaulted lord the rings

[48:11] Todd

[48:12] Who's not buying that game with improved artwork and

[48:16] It's still one of their best games ever and it's packed beautiful game. It's packed with stuff to do

[48:22] It's beautiful now the question is

[48:25] Because I actually got a chance to to ask this question when we were at stern in october

[48:30] You see they were put it they've had back in production

[48:34] Uh, I think it was Metallica

[48:37] And Metallica has a all it's a different board system

[48:41] They and it's wires it's not phone cables

[48:45] So

[48:47] In those light bulbs or their LEDs, but they're 555's and 44's or whatever

[48:53] So for them to put the lord of the rings back in production

[48:57] They would have to make the old harnesses again

[49:01] Why I get that everyone's like it has to be the white star boards. It has to be

[49:05] Why can't they just they've got the game designed right they've got the mechs

[49:12] Why can't they find a way to get the old game

[49:15] To where there's stuff yeah engineer the spike system to make to drive those things and put an LCD screen

[49:24] And even if you don't even if you don't like get clips from the movie just

[49:28] animate

[49:30] There's not that many animations on the DMD. I own the game for like two years

[49:35] Just make it look more beautiful polish everything right wherever there was

[49:40] Anything that could just you know, they could make a little bit more of a sculpted area the path of the dead

[49:45] In the upper left corner where the ball comes down and just sort of hits the two posts and it falls into the shire area

[49:51] That that is such a like there's a great mod for it

[49:54] But they could you know, they could mod some of the areas that could just use a little bit prettier sculpts

[49:59] But for the most part the game is perfect. I mean, I still think it's one as stern as finest games ever

[50:04] And Todd if they vaulted it

[50:06] They could make a very high price high price they can make a they could stir it could say and I mean this without even hesitation

[50:13] They could say we're gonna make 500 Lord of the Rings

[50:17] Super limited edition games

[50:19] 10,000 a piece. I think they could go 12 5 or 15

[50:24] I did it's just that kind of title

[50:26] There I think there's enough if you think about this the whole world

[50:31] And they only make a thousand of them or 500

[50:35] They would probably get sucked up pretty quick because it's the whole world

[50:39] Yep, and it's and it's and it's a home run game and you don't have to spend any money on coding it

[50:45] It's got one of the best codes ever you don't have to spend any design money

[50:49] You only have to re up the license which is not that hard

[50:53] Yeah, I'm sure they would be thrilled I

[50:56] I'm sure they would be thrilled the license the game and the callouts are amazing everything about that game

[51:02] Just I see my problem is that was my first pinball machine I ever owned

[51:06] And it's so good that when I go on to other machines

[51:10] That's like that's my standard Lord the Rings and it's a really high standard for even these new games

[51:16] I mean Lord the Rings came out Todd in 2004

[51:20] And that game has more in it than most modern games coming out today 16 years later one of my collectors dean

[51:28] Who listens to you too?

[51:31] He has a Lord of the Rings that he has

[51:33] Gone to town on he bought the machine from us, but he went nuts on it and he really did

[51:40] And it looks like it if if Stern were to see some pictures of that say you follow some of his ideas here

[51:50] You could make that I guess a reality a ten or twelve thousand dollar game especially with the spike system

[51:55] See the big advantage is spike

[51:58] And also the new Chicago gaming enters you jack all their systems

[52:04] Allow you to use the LEDs

[52:06] That are able to change to six different colors or you can really color other code the whole machine

[52:13] Unlike any other machine before the downside is of course all those LEDs are surface mount chips on a circuit board

[52:22] And at this point we can't fix them

[52:25] So the only way if you have your two times LED happens to go out

[52:30] You have to change the board you can't just the chip or you just live with that laid out

[52:35] But I can't tell you how many customers call me on the phone and see and now my

[52:40] 12 bonus bulb is out

[52:43] What you're gonna do about it?

[52:45] So the first thing I say are the other 300 bulbs lit or the other

[52:49] 299 bulbs still on you know because there's G.E.I. bulbs and computer control bulbs

[52:55] And in most cases is just 64 as everybody knows they kind of ran out of

[53:01] Lights for the older stuff, but I can't imagine you know see right now all this equipment's new

[53:07] But like Gorgor I have people call me up because there's a bowl batter a coil doesn't work right and it's Gorgor and it's 40 years old

[53:15] When they call up and say there's there's LEDs out there's lights out and the coil doesn't work

[53:21] One of the new games

[53:22] Their beetles or their star wars new star wars pin

[53:27] I say well we can fix it you got to buy a board

[53:30] You can't change just the chip one you got to buy the whole board because nobody can do that surface mount technology

[53:36] Most of us have no no way

[53:38] To solder and unsawd or that equipment right and there's not there's nobody

[53:44] Opening up pin bolsters have you noticed there's very few people in the country

[53:50] That's service pinball machine boards companies. I'm talking to companies not individuals

[53:56] Yeah

[53:57] Clive at going up called it he's terrific guy

[54:00] But it's just him and he maybe have one or two workers, but the

[54:04] A John at El Dorado games. It's just a couple guys there

[54:08] Right there's no companies that want to deal with

[54:12] The homeowner who's gonna blow the board up

[54:16] You know it feels like that's a business that's gonna pop up in like 10 years and 15 years right when when stern

[54:22] Finally stops making pins and then you've got tens of thousands of games with these spike boards

[54:28] Then it's a viable business to open up to repair them because and that's always been a question with spike in general

[54:34] Is what is the long term?

[54:36] How do I maintain this over the years because everyone wants the game the last forever and the best bet for most people now

[54:42] Would be just like buy a backup of every node board in your game and as a safety measure

[54:47] But they're not cheap and stern knows that and so

[54:51] It's expensive on top of an already expensive product

[54:55] Todd let's talk about the twippies because we you

[54:58] You had a fun video on Saturday night and you were up for favorite pinball youtube channel now

[55:05] You've been doing your youtube channel for a long time right and you have a

[55:10] So when we started the channel yeah 10 years

[55:13] Now this category was really really competitive there were some sort of blowout categories

[55:19] But you were so close and finished in third place with 26.9% pop-up pinball

[55:26] One the youtube channel twippy then 23.2% was straight down the middle and you were at 22.6%

[55:33] So really really close and then the rest of them were like

[55:36] 765%

[55:38] So how did you feel when you saw that

[55:41] percentages and and then you you uploaded a fun live video of you

[55:45] Is seeing the results and you always have a you're always a good sport with these things

[55:49] So what was it like watching Saturday night?

[55:52] Well first of all they they they called me and they said, you know

[55:56] We don't we can't we don't can't tell you who's gonna win or but this this was actually a while ago

[56:01] They approached everybody to film a

[56:04] Thank you for giving me the award video

[56:07] Apparently I was the only one that filmed a

[56:11] Thank you for not giving me the award you creeps video and

[56:17] It worked out well because I said I'm gonna give them both and perfect

[56:22] In a video later this week. I'm gonna run both videos together the two videos. I made the one

[56:27] I would play if I won and one I would play if I didn't

[56:31] and I know why I didn't win

[56:34] because

[56:36] You see my

[56:38] My channel everybody can pretty much say this my channel

[56:42] Features a variety of equipment

[56:45] Pimble arcade video game ski bowl shuffle bowling alleys

[56:49] But then other weird stuff I go on tours I go on trips

[56:54] Um my film copy my film collecting hobby is on some of the videos

[56:59] You know one of my heaviest viewed videos is when I took apart an eight track player

[57:06] To clean it for a two tigers arcade video game. It's one of my top viewed videos

[57:12] My another top viewed video is taking a part of film strip projector that we used to have at the schools

[57:19] so

[57:21] They're not even related my my player piano video got tons of views and my old radio collection

[57:27] So the reason I didn't win is

[57:30] simple

[57:31] it's because

[57:33] Most of the people voting are pin head really into pinball and I would say most of them are heavy

[57:41] Pinsiders and I have a lot of fans on pin side

[57:44] But I don't make

[57:46] I guess enough videos that are just game play because I it's just their dull and everybody else is doing it

[57:54] So I don't want to just set the camera up and point it down at the game and just play the game

[57:59] And not even talk about how to play it or anything or show people stuff

[58:04] So the original purpose you know of my videos they were never going to be live. I accidentally

[58:11] Made one of them live. I was making them for the people getting them the game before I should remember

[58:18] I just

[58:19] Just sent the people

[58:21] Barney hunter we just shipped that out today. We shipped out a cocktail miss Pac-Man

[58:26] That has that 16 in one that licensed board from two-bit score

[58:32] Showing them how to play that will appear in a later video this week or next week

[58:37] But I sent it to the people so they could see it before it shipped as soon as I finished with you

[58:43] We're filming a superchecks video. This guy wants to see it before he pays for it

[58:49] Yeah, I want to see the machine. I want to make sure it's okay. I said no problem

[58:53] I'll do a video and the videos we started making were for the customer and

[58:58] I didn't have it unlisted it went up public and I started getting all these emails

[59:04] Wow, that was great. Oh man. I wish you'd so I said you know what?

[59:08] I'll just make them all live for everybody to see even though they're produced for the buyer the guy getting them

[59:13] And then we have a lot of fun. We started out in the green screens and

[59:17] My my brother

[59:19] We lost his job. He comes over in volunteers

[59:22] He's afraid to come in. You know, he doesn't even come here now even to volunteer

[59:26] So he sent he shoots his film and sends it to me and I upload it

[59:31] So he hasn't been here in two weeks, but

[59:34] He's doing the right thing. He's doing the right thing. He's quarantining right? He's quarantined all right

[59:40] Well, well and Todd, I think you know, it is amazing because you're right

[59:43] Like you aren't only in the pinball your content isn't only pinball and you're right the

[59:49] Straight down the middle Papa. I mean these are this is pinball focus people everyone on

[59:53] I've said the other person who's not

[59:55] Pinball only on this list is chas is arcade right and chas has 1.2% of the votes because he's doing other things as well

[01:00:03] Now I think it's amazing because you didn't even really lobby for votes right? I don't I don't know I did

[01:00:10] I made a video of clips of some past videos and put it up on my channel as a regular video and ask people to vote

[01:00:18] But I only did it the one time and I have some super fans

[01:00:23] They they're wonderful people that love watching

[01:00:27] We're family-based because I have little kids watching now

[01:00:32] Little little I just showed little penny. She's seven years old and she wears her tnt shirt to school

[01:00:38] And she watches with her daddy and there's a so the shows are trying to appeal to everyone

[01:00:46] So it's a different kind of

[01:00:48] Show we a lot of goofy jokes and but we try to make them

[01:00:54] So you can learn something a little bit of something other than an eye poke but the

[01:01:01] uh

[01:01:02] Excuse me the overall

[01:01:04] Effect of the show

[01:01:06] um is to

[01:01:08] Inspire people to want to find and play a game

[01:01:12] Steve Young at Pinball resource

[01:01:14] Told someone not me but told someone else

[01:01:18] That I have single-handedly created a demand for pinball machines. No one ever wanted before

[01:01:25] I don't disagree with that and and when I saw your videos for the first time

[01:01:30] And I think when people I think a lot of it starts out Todd like this where people are

[01:01:36] curious about our kids and pinball and they do a google search and they go to youtube and they find you

[01:01:44] And you have this amazing ability to pull people into this hobby

[01:01:49] Through your storytelling and your visual medium and you make it really entertaining and interesting and it's like an intimate

[01:01:57] Exploration of all these different games

[01:02:00] It gets people excited and I do agree with that and that's why Todd

[01:02:03] I think when you

[01:02:05] Didn't win there was a

[01:02:07] An outcry

[01:02:09] From the community that loves you and the thing I'm advocating for and I've said this on a previous show is

[01:02:15] I think we need stuff like lifetime achievement in content creation within pinball and within amusement because

[01:02:23] I think you supersede

[01:02:26] A simple category like this because I think you've been doing it for over a decade and and that's what I'm

[01:02:31] lobbying for you moving forward because I just think you deserve it

[01:02:35] And I think everyone would agree and I think we need more

[01:02:38] Todd tucky and Todd tucky enthusiasm in the hobby and it's great that we have you and I love that you pushed a pinball machine off a roof too

[01:02:46] Because I think I think you bring

[01:02:48] Flack for that. Oh, but you but you but I take flack for for my video

[01:02:53] You do stuff to entertain and engage and you're always you that's what I love about

[01:03:00] Your videos and I love about the way you approach this hobby is you care you love it

[01:03:05] But you don't you don't change who you are as you're making this content and I think people appreciate that

[01:03:11] And I think that's why you have such a strong following

[01:03:13] After 10 years of making these kinds of great videos that we enjoy. Oh, thanks. That's really good

[01:03:19] Very good to hear that because uh, we always wonder I said we were discussing to get more views

[01:03:26] Because our videos generally don't get tons and tons of views

[01:03:30] Like we hoped they would but

[01:03:33] People constantly whenever I go to a show I'm always swarmed with people that love them in one pictures and it's always fun

[01:03:40] to

[01:03:41] And now as a matter of fact

[01:03:43] Timmy's one of the twins

[01:03:46] Has been a big inspiration to get me to do a lot of t-shirts. We have a full line of t-shirts now

[01:03:53] That have my sayings on the back. They're all advertised on our store

[01:03:57] But there's hats

[01:04:00] Another fellow does artwork for me. We sell them on Zazzle under tnt muslims as a tie with my face on it if any of you want it

[01:04:09] So it's kind of neat with the the stuff we can promote

[01:04:13] But now it's interesting when we go to a show

[01:04:16] That some of the people when they know I'm coming

[01:04:19] They want to they try to adjust their schedules so they can go

[01:04:23] I heard that at pimpal expo in october

[01:04:26] I originally wasn't able to come because I had a another show that weekend

[01:04:30] And then that show got canned

[01:04:32] Got moved so I was able to do the pimpal expo and

[01:04:36] The one fella a Jeff who has a really great channel arcade hollywood

[01:04:41] He said there was a spike as soon as people

[01:04:44] heard that I was coming they had a spike in sales

[01:04:47] for the show

[01:04:49] And that was great because we we saw so many collectors. I have oh god. We had so much fun see uh

[01:04:55] Todd I'm so envious because I have the reverse effect people here canate is coming and they can so they're trip

[01:05:02] They don't go no I'm joking

[01:05:04] I heard or has it that you're going to get your own personal tour gary stirns uh

[01:05:10] um

[01:05:11] Factory is that true? I what do you think the odds are that I'm on episode this will be episode I think

[01:05:18] 474 right what do you think the odds are by episode 500 if I make it there I could get gary stern to come on you think he would do it

[01:05:30] I

[01:05:30] He carries funny

[01:05:32] He what when I at in october he acted as though he never heard of me

[01:05:38] And it was so funny because I'm thinking god. How could he not know me you know, but uh if you know already

[01:05:46] When I do a video I

[01:05:48] I try to find good stuff out of bad stuff

[01:05:52] so

[01:05:54] I can find a like in my opinion now. This is my opinion the most awful most rotten most stupidest

[01:06:03] dumbest pinball ever made

[01:06:06] was balley's motor dome

[01:06:09] It's a combination of everything awful and pinball and just ugly nasty

[01:06:16] Piece of equipment, but I actually found one great feature in it that no other pinball machine had none

[01:06:22] Nobody ever came up with this idea

[01:06:24] And it was it was copied years later

[01:06:27] Where when you put your quarter and start the game you could select which level you wanted to play

[01:06:33] Easy medium or hard

[01:06:35] You could actually select it nobody ever thought of doing that before

[01:06:39] It's amazing because that is a feature in which we need now more than ever with a lot of these complex games

[01:06:45] I don't understand why people don't do that second they have the novice and then they have

[01:06:50] Yeah, regular any modern video game allows you that feature

[01:06:53] It's like I always say like pinball machines

[01:06:57] There's like one setting and it's usually really hard and that's it

[01:07:00] And it would be nice to have a feature where you could pre-select it and get your ball and keep your ball if it goes down the toilet real quick

[01:07:08] And you get your ball back. Yeah, I mean that's only fair

[01:07:12] Especially with a player that's new at it a good player that'll never happen

[01:07:17] See if you're a good pinball player. You're not gonna lose the ball in a second now you're gonna keep it on the field

[01:07:22] So a person walking up

[01:07:25] They're gonna be disgusted if they lose their ball right away right and accounts and accounts that is and

[01:07:31] That was a nice feature and

[01:07:34] When they jazzed up a

[01:07:36] Gotley the nine-wumped board for the got leave system ones which has got to be the

[01:07:41] crudest pinball machine electronic pinball machines ever made

[01:07:45] uh, they the mock two the mark two boards

[01:07:49] Allow a skill shot now they've added skill shot to the game program

[01:07:55] And then they've added a guaranteed ball time

[01:07:58] So if your ball goes right down the toilet on the system when you get it back

[01:08:03] It just makes so much sense with these modern computers running these games

[01:08:06] Let's say you have like an eight-year-old kid and why can I just put it on like all right?

[01:08:11] I'm gonna set it so like you can play for ten minutes straight and it won't you won't get a game over you can just explore the game and play for ten minutes and

[01:08:18] Let let the kid well away on the machine. I mean there's

[01:08:22] It's so easy to code that it's just strange to me that they don't understand

[01:08:26] The variety of people that jump on these machines like a Rick and Morty's a good example

[01:08:31] It's so hard for most people. They're gonna get on that machine and see none of it

[01:08:35] Yeah, you're you're probably right and if they don't get guaranteed play time now

[01:08:39] I think I'm sure they have guaranteed time

[01:08:42] Uh, they're gonna give you your ball back if it goes right down, right?

[01:08:45] Yeah, they'll do that and then you could obviously you could always make it like five ball eight ball

[01:08:49] You could people you said make it a ball like I get that but it doesn't make the game

[01:08:54] Easier like you're still gonna have to hit this many shots in a row to start a mode and maybe a kid

[01:09:01] Maybe the mochi just start every three to four minutes just because it's a kid

[01:09:06] And he's not gonna be able to hit all those shots and those sequences. I don't know well in the Williams Williams pioneered

[01:09:13] Uh, with high speed the automatic high score the replay level adjustments

[01:09:20] Uh, because I'll never forget the call the think the next game or two games after high speed was grand lizard

[01:09:26] I sold a grand lizard a Christmas time

[01:09:29] Year this is years ago and guy called me on the phone. It's just something's really wrong with this game

[01:09:34] I came home again and the replay levels way low. It's too low

[01:09:39] It's ridiculous when I left last night when I played the last night and I said is there anybody playing it during the day

[01:09:46] I said yeah my kids are playing it. I said there you go

[01:09:50] I said your kids are playing it in the game understands their children and they're not good players

[01:09:56] And the game is adjusting itself so they can win

[01:10:01] And he was like in shock

[01:10:03] He's like damn it. He says you're kidding and I said just play a couple games and the game will catch up that it'll

[01:10:10] Eliminate that feature as you you'll be back up again, but I told him you can turn the feature off

[01:10:15] But once he when I explained to him that the game was trying to

[01:10:19] Allow the children to win so they at Williams actually thought of that already

[01:10:24] Yeah, that was a great. I mean the system 11 board was just great. I think there's very little thought given to

[01:10:32] Younger inexperienced players

[01:10:34] Code it into any of these modern games and it confuses me considering if this is where I get into marketing Todd

[01:10:41] It's like if you do your market research and a lot of your buyers of kids

[01:10:45] Why not do that?

[01:10:47] Why not give the parents an ability and I know Jerry's trying to do that with p3. He's made games specifically

[01:10:54] That are sort of like entry level games for kids to to get into pimble and most modern games

[01:11:00] Really difficult for kids to jump on and understand the p3 games are just beautiful. I think they are I

[01:11:09] and

[01:11:10] You know, I would love to see the new ones incredible the highs or high. Sorry. It's just ice. I keep saying the highs

[01:11:17] High used it looks awesome. It's such a great idea and I I'm glad they're still trying

[01:11:26] You know everybody tries and some people you know fade away, you know like

[01:11:30] what happened with highway games and

[01:11:32] And the Dutch pimble it's

[01:11:36] It's really precarious because

[01:11:39] You need so much money to keep things going and I can't tell you I have a number of times here

[01:11:44] I've had the bar from my credit card to make payroll each week. Yeah, what about deeproot? Do they make it?

[01:11:50] They've been just in the shadows for years. I don't know we were we almost saw

[01:11:55] They had almost we're two weeks away

[01:11:58] I know and and they certainly don't want to reveal it one one line

[01:12:04] I think they're just gonna look like they're just wait and see if

[01:12:08] Everybody thought this thing was gonna be over in two or three weeks

[01:12:12] Nobody expected just to drag on like this and that

[01:12:16] Why did we why did we think that as a as a sigh? I'm just and then you know, I'll let you go because we're at the hour

[01:12:20] But it's weird that we all thought that right because none of the medical experts were saying it but it was just like

[01:12:26] Our political leaders were all convincing us that it was gonna be life as usual and it was said simple

[01:12:33] It's that's an easy one

[01:12:35] If they told you

[01:12:37] That look

[01:12:38] We're shutting everything down for six months

[01:12:41] Everybody would go up in arms

[01:12:44] But if they instead said look we're gonna shut everything down for just two weeks

[01:12:49] And everybody said well two weeks god that's hard but I can deal with that

[01:12:54] Then toward the end of the two is well. It's gonna be another two weeks

[01:12:58] Well two weeks. I can deal with that see it two weeks

[01:13:03] You can get your you can get your hand around that

[01:13:06] But six months baby you can't you think in six months. I'll be bankrupt. I'll be going

[01:13:12] I'll you know we'll lose everything you know something like that

[01:13:15] So and that that is why Andrew highway used to tell everybody who had waited forever that they would get their game in two weeks
