[00:00] I'm sitting at a ball rolling inside

[00:03] Waiting for my ride on the outside

[00:06] She stole my heart in the trailer park

[00:09] So I'd jack the keys to her fucking cart

[00:13] And crash that piece of shit then stepped away

[00:24] Welcome to episode 98 of

[00:28] Canada's pinball podcast we are inching closer and closer to episode 100

[00:34] Which is gonna be a very very special edition of the show

[00:39] That's all I'm gonna say you're definitely not gonna want to miss episode 100 of Canada's pinball podcast on this episode

[00:46] Blake and I

[00:48] Talk about Texas pinball festival. It is less than two weeks away

[00:53] We are super excited. There is a lot going on at the show

[00:56] And I think you're really gonna enjoy our conversation around it. Before I do that want to want to read a couple

[01:03] Emails I got from some of the listeners out there again guys if you email me

[01:07] I will read your emails on the air. I want to give a shout out to Mark Cook Mark said canada

[01:13] I literally laughed out loud at pinball tomatoes loving the podcast and Mark comes all the way from Australia

[01:20] It looks like I think so and that's awesome

[01:23] I love that this show is making it all the way around the world

[01:27] So thank you Mark for listening to kid in canada. So I can't even say my name canada's pinball podcast

[01:32] I also got a Tim Leonard Tim good good friend at the show Tim gave me like a lot of really good feedback on recent episodes and just the show overall

[01:42] And basically was like dude. I'm sick of hearing about magic girl

[01:45] I'm tired of hearing about alien and wise snow and Andrew highway drama

[01:52] And also you know who's just talking about pinball and how I should clarify that when I say I love pinball

[01:59] I mean most recent pinball right I don't really talk about old stuff

[02:03] So I I said to Tim man that is all accurate feedback and as you'll see going forward

[02:10] We're not gonna talk about magic girl that much more. I don't think there's much more news

[02:14] We have been a lot easier on

[02:16] Andrew highway and highway pinball and all that drama

[02:19] I do want to congratulate that team on what seems like getting games out

[02:24] We saw six got loaded onto a truck just yesterday

[02:27] So we're not gonna harp on the drama. There's too much negativity as I said

[02:31] I don't think things are gonna you know anything goes smoothly until

[02:36] People get their games and I hope that happens

[02:39] And in terms of my knowledge of pinball. Yeah, I've never pretended to think I am an expert on pinball machines

[02:46] Throughout pinball history. I think I'm pretty well versed on machines that have come out over the last ten years

[02:53] Prior to that, you know, I jump on those machines when I can but I don't really find it fun to talk about like whitewood or

[02:59] And fun house I'd much rather talk about dialed in and alien and one thing I you know I got another

[03:08] Email to from someone who just said I think I know why I think this is from maybe Tim too

[03:13] I love your podcast so much because you never talk about tournament talk and I will never ever ever ever in a million years

[03:19] Ever talk about tournament talk. It is the worst and most boring topic to

[03:24] Record a podcast about it's a visual thing how you played a game

[03:30] It sucks describing it with words. I also want to say thank you to the person and pinside who

[03:37] Who said that my podcast was an adequate

[03:40] Replacement for Nate's coast to coast pinball. It sucks that there is no more coast to coast

[03:45] He is the reason I do this podcast. He is the inspiration. I still talk to Nate every once in a while

[03:51] But it seems Nate has moved on the last podcast was from December

[03:56] So I am happy that this podcast is giving some of you guys

[04:01] It's filling and satiating the hunger you had for coast to coast so without further ado

[04:06] Let's talk about Texas pinball festival. I will be there. I made an ad with Brenda last night

[04:13] I made a full page ad for the Texas pinball festival brochure for canators pinball podcasts make sure you check it out

[04:19] You're gonna want to look at this one. You're really gonna want to look at it

[04:22] Without further ado, let's talk about tpf with Blake

[04:27] All right ladies and gentlemen

[04:29] Welcome back to canators pinball podcast Blake do miss snail Blake coming from Texas. How you doing?

[04:36] What's up, Chris? How's it going sir? It's good. It's good. It's been a while

[04:40] We haven't talked since I got the magic girl. We haven't talked since I booked my flight to tpf

[04:46] So I'm excited to sort of just do a little rundown of what's going on in pinball

[04:50] Definitely, there's been a lot going on it seems like yeah

[04:52] It's you know the beginning of the year was sort of like nothing happening and then now all of a sudden the last like three to four weeks

[05:00] We've got magic girl shipping. We've got like alien production. There's a new video. I saw today of that

[05:05] We got tpf on the horizon. So let's just go down the list of like the big

[05:11] Items that that have that have been occurring. So first let's start with alien. Did you see the

[05:16] Andrew posted like a 14-minute video today? Do you see that? Oh, yeah, I did actually yeah

[05:23] What are your thoughts? You think we're gonna see alien anytime soon?

[05:26] You know, I mean, I want to remain optimistic for the guys that are in on it

[05:31] I think that they're still probably tweaking some things and trying to get things straight and out a little bit

[05:37] I think you brought up a good point a an episode or two ago about why the

[05:42] Why the US team hasn't gotten a chance to really look over this thing and and have it in their hands to sort of

[05:49] flesh out a little bit more

[05:52] so

[05:53] I think that the beta units that have gone out sort of to West Virginia and to to Hilton up in Wisconsin

[05:59] I think that that's certainly a good start and

[06:02] You know, you got you got to start somewhere you got to test it see how it goes and and Jersey Jack and

[06:07] The other guys have certainly done that and so I congratulate them on that um

[06:11] I think that at this point people feel like man, they're just really really close and

[06:17] Just get it done get get the boards in from China get it done and get the game shipping

[06:22] You know, I guess it's an interesting question. So like I saw the video and I was just happy to see people in the factory for one

[06:28] Yeah, it's like finally there's people at stations doing stuff

[06:32] um, I guess what's interesting is the games that are there now

[06:37] Uh, because Andrew was saying like six are gonna go out then three then eight like so there's sort of like the sporadic release

[06:43] And I'm wondering if these first games are still those sort of hands-soldered boards or

[06:49] If they're gonna be the new boards that are coming from China. So I'm I'm not sure like what what what these first units are

[06:57] Like if they're still just sort of like betas or prototypes

[07:01] Yeah, I mean, you know, it seems like uh, maybe last weekend or or very recently within the last two weeks

[07:08] I think Andrew posted an update or maybe mentioned it in their video that they were or previous video that they were going to be getting the boards in from China like this week

[07:17] So I do wonder if they did happen to get those boards in and that maybe that's what we're starting to see now

[07:23] um

[07:25] If not then it wouldn't surprise me if there are more than two

[07:29] You know pre-production beta units that go out where they're trying to test some of these things out

[07:34] It seems like that

[07:36] Although the mechs are working in the game. Maybe they're not working up to their fullest potential

[07:41] I don't I don't mean that a negative way. I just mean that like Andrew's mentioned that um, they expect the the zino head to actually

[07:48] That the tongue that actually work much faster than it is already so um, so maybe

[07:54] You know, maybe that's that's gonna allow them to start testing some of those things to their full potential

[07:59] The one piece I keep looking at is just that piece of plastic under the flipper which is supposed to be black

[08:07] On the final production games and they're still white and I heard from like Hilton that they're gonna swap them out

[08:13] but I mean I you got to imagine when you're ready to go into full production that all the parts will be

[08:21] The parts you want

[08:23] uh, the black

[08:25] Plastic underneath the flippers everything will be tweaked perfectly so I still think these are sort of like

[08:31] Test units that are going out. I'd be surprised if these are gonna go to customer homes

[08:36] I I fully expect the next like

[08:39] The first 20 to go to operators and locations first

[08:44] I I think you're right on that. I mean I

[08:47] I don't blame them for wanting to to get them out and kind of make it look like they're shipping production units and stuff

[08:53] But at the same time I think that they're also trying to test the waters a little bit and make sure that they don't have some of the issues that

[09:00] We've even seen with some of the jersey jack and starting games where they've gotten out on location or they've gotten the people's homes

[09:05] And then all of a sudden they have these issues. So I do commend them for

[09:09] For wanting to get that right and making sure that they

[09:12] Don't have any surprise issues that they weren't expecting right

[09:16] so

[09:18] As as a person you know if if I were in on one of these games already and I put money down or even if I was

[09:24] About to put money down. Let's there gonna be a lot of people coming to tpf that are gonna want to drop money on one of these games like on site and

[09:32] I would feel like

[09:34] I would want to know that things are worked out first before you know getting one of these games

[09:38] And so I would think that they would be very happy to see

[09:41] Highway trying to do that the right way right

[09:44] I was like one of the things I was a little bit head scratching at was there's a lot of big new machinery that but he said just

[09:51] Arrive like that week and I'm like man it's March

[09:55] Like these games were supposed to ship in like November December

[10:00] So like where was the machinery then so I don't know I could ask so many questions. I'm like

[10:05] All right, but it's all there now. So it seems like

[10:08] We should be weeks away and not months away from from volume of

[10:13] Machines going out the door. So I think I think tpf is gonna be interesting to see

[10:18] um

[10:19] If consumers get the game by then and and it's gonna be interesting to see how they take money too because I know right now if you

[10:26] I think if you like pay in full you kind of cut the line

[10:29] I think that's the way they're doing it a little bit to get like full payments in

[10:34] so

[10:35] You know, I just don't know like how many LEDs have sold like what if you were to order now like where would you be in the pecking order

[10:43] But I think distributors like are always the best way to go like ask coin taker

[10:48] They're the number one alien distributor in America. So if you want to know if you guys out there are interest in alien

[10:53] I'd hit up chris from coin taker and ask him

[10:55] How many orders they have and where on the list you would be so I think that's that's a good way to go

[11:00] Blake did you see the um the dead flip

[11:03] Three-hour extravaganza lord the rings length video of them playing alien

[11:11] I uh, I did I did not sit through the entire three hours of that of that stream. I mean

[11:17] You know jacks a compelling guy and he certainly makes these games fun

[11:21] And he adds some personality to the live streams, but you know

[11:26] I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of it just to kind of

[11:31] Get a feel for what the game really is like I wanted to see them hit some certain modes and multi-ball and stuff like that

[11:36] But once once I got my fill of that I moved on. I'm like man

[11:41] This I think I think we got the idea you know until the game is flushed out a little bit more

[11:46] I think that that was what were your what were your initial first impressions with the video and sort of the gameplay

[11:53] so

[11:55] You know my initial thoughts on the game were overall pretty positive

[11:58] I thought that the game made a really good showing and and I think that it does seem like a pretty

[12:03] Complete package and if the game were to ship out right now as it currently sits like with what Hilton has

[12:10] As an owner. I don't know that I would be that upset about it. I think that it's it's pretty complete

[12:15] And I think it's got a lot more to it than even the Batman 66 is shipped out with with their code

[12:21] The

[12:23] Atmosphere the game and the immersion which is something that you know

[12:26] Highways been talking about for a long time on the game seems to be really good

[12:30] It's it's everything that they have been kind of hyping it up to be in terms of the the music being really great the lighting being really great

[12:38] um in terms of the gameplay itself

[12:41] I

[12:42] You know and I want to be

[12:45] Kind of about how to say this I feel like the game plays a little clunky right now

[12:49] um

[12:51] And I don't know if that's necessarily because some of the shots just weren't being hit cleanly

[12:55] But it did seem like when shots were hit very cleanly whether it be a ramp or an orbit or even a scoop

[13:03] It was very smooth. It had great flow to it the ball would come back around quickly

[13:07] But then there were a lot of other shots where you felt like the ball was kind of flailing around and

[13:14] that

[13:15] Kind of

[13:16] Seems a little boring to me almost all right

[13:19] maybe

[13:20] With some additional

[13:22] Sound effects and lighting effects and stuff

[13:24] Maybe that'll help pick up the pace a little bit and and sort of motivate you as a player to

[13:30] To hit some of those shots much more cleanly

[13:33] But I do feel like it's going to be one of those games that if you miss a shot you're going to be punished for it

[13:37] You know, it's not gonna it's not a very forgiving game. It doesn't seem like yeah, it seemed pretty hard

[13:42] There was I think um I think they're going to have to sort of work on the balance of the difficulty of the game in terms of how easy it is to get to

[13:51] Multi-ball I know like during the whole

[13:54] Recording they only hit multi-ball a few times and they'll probably tweak that

[13:59] I mean, I think it it makes sense when you have a target like the xenomorph in the middle

[14:03] He's sort of like the sparky in that game right where you yeah, you kind of want to be able to activate multi-ball

[14:08] Within three to five minutes and not have it be too difficult to get there

[14:13] For the casual player. So I think they're at the game is brutal right now

[14:17] I know there's a lot of out lane drains to that seems a pretty I hate out lane drains that just seem like unfair

[14:23] I think it's like the worst thing to design in a game is like brutal out lane drains

[14:27] But hopefully there's like a post you can move that sort of doesn't make it too too difficult

[14:33] Yeah, I mean, it's like I couldn't I thought the light show was great. I thought the music was great. I can't get a sense of

[14:41] The progression of how the modes connect and do I feel like I'm playing the alien films the way I do with

[14:47] the rings where you kind of feel like you're in the movie and you're you're going through the scenes in the movie

[14:52] And that'll just come with jumping on the game and spending time with it

[14:56] So I think so far I would say so good for them right?

[15:00] I mean this isn't like a two-year and it came out and it's a freaking magic girl disaster. It's a it's a playable pinball machine

[15:08] I only think I don't know why he makes some widebody though when I see these widebody games

[15:13] And I just don't like widebody in general like it doesn't look like it needed to be widebody

[15:17] And and and then I think you get some of that

[15:19] clonkiness and that floating is in the middle because there's like there's nothing in the middle

[15:23] Right. Yeah, I mean I mean

[15:26] This game

[15:27] You know alien is one of those themes that there's so much

[15:32] Material to work with that sure you would think that it would be a piece of cake to fill a widebody with with everything that you could reference from those movies

[15:40] And I think overall they have done a good job with that but at the same time

[15:44] It does still kind of suffer from what a lot of widebody's suffer from and that is a very open middle play field and

[15:51] You you have these it's like you're shooting for the corners all the time in these games. You're either shooting for

[15:57] An extreme left or right shot or you're trying to hit something way in the back of the play field down the middle and

[16:03] that kind of stuff

[16:05] Does end up leading to the ball kind of floating around and then ultimately hitting an outline or just going straight down the middle and

[16:12] You know, I think the hobbit definitely suffered from it a lot

[16:16] And and I would be curious to see what a what a standard body alien would have been like

[16:21] I think that highway's done a good job in terms of keeping the speed

[16:26] I think there are a lot of wide bodies out there that have very slow gameplay

[16:31] Full throttle and alien definitely are faster pace games which I applaud them for that

[16:37] Um, I feel like the hobbit is much more floaty than it seems like alien is

[16:42] But at the same time if man if you don't hit those shots cleanly you're you're gonna get punished for it. So right

[16:48] Um, you know the the other the other thing that I can't think about when I was watching the video was

[16:53] I was I was really waiting to hear more callouts like I know there are a lot of callouts that they've got

[16:59] For the the Marines for Bill Paxton and a lot of those guys from the movies

[17:04] And you heard a little bit of it, but I I guess I was expecting a little bit more frequency to it and

[17:10] Uh, that's probably something that'll grow with with time with the code and everything

[17:14] So I don't want to be overly critical of that. I just

[17:16] It was just something I noticed and um

[17:19] Like you mentioned in terms of the modes

[17:22] Naturally, I do feel like that the game jumps around a lot

[17:26] In fact, it even seemed like it was jumping around from film to film and I do kind of wish that

[17:31] Um, there was more of a natural linear progression to the modes

[17:35] Uh, that's how Ghostbusters is structured and while I know there were a lot of people that have complained about that

[17:41] It did feel like you you know, you had a specific

[17:46] Uh, goal in mind in terms of which ladder you wanted to climb

[17:49] I guess alien is kind of the same way it does have ladders as well, but um

[17:53] I just felt like man one minute they were trying to find Jonesy and then another another minute they were

[17:59] You know trying to battle the queen that that was something that stood out to me

[18:03] I felt like the queen probably should have been more like a

[18:06] A wizard mode almost or or something that was much harder to attain right

[18:11] Uh, stay puff mode and Ghostbusters. I mean, that's a very hard mode to get to and but you feel like you've been rewarded once you hit it

[18:17] And then an alien it's like all of a sudden they're just battling the queen. So I think the challenge right is the two movies are just so different

[18:26] and yeah and in terms of like the narrative and the goals of each film they're completely different

[18:31] It's not like Lord of the Rings where like all three of those storylines are interwoven and connected so

[18:38] While you have the mode select on the ring itself that contain modes from or scenes from all three films

[18:46] You then have that progression

[18:48] um

[18:49] Well, you can do the multi balls in different order, but they all lead up to the final destroy the ring

[18:55] So it sort of has that cohesiveness to it doesn't feel like it's it's

[18:59] Three disparate movies and that's I think why Ghostbusters 2 those really only Ghostbusters 1 right it would have been more challenging if they did Ghostbusters 2

[19:06] And had two ladders going simultaneously like VGo and one end and stay puff on the other sure

[19:12] So I think um, I think it definitely present a little bit of a challenge for them

[19:17] Um, all right. Well, we'll play alien. I mean you'll play it. I don't think the highway guys are gonna want canada by their booth

[19:23] So I might have to put like a ski mask on to to play it

[19:27] uh, but you'll have to play it at report back maybe where like a GoPro and I can just be your serigate as I look over her and

[19:35] Uh, to see what's going on. So it'll be a tp app. So we're interested to see how it flips in person um

[19:43] Aerosmith is shipping are you excited about erosmith? Are you a fan? Are you curious or is this one that you know you'll let pass

[19:53] I am I'm actually really excited about erosmith. I think that um, so I just found out that

[20:00] My local distributor just got his first erosmith yesterday and so

[20:04] We're gonna be playing in our league night on Monday night. So I'm really excited about getting to check it out with a small group of people before the crowds at tpf

[20:13] and

[20:14] You know, I think the game is beautiful. I think that dirty donny

[20:19] Not only hit the bar that he set with Metallica, but maybe even surpassed it with the artwork on this game

[20:25] um

[20:26] You know, I I can see the similarities and the layout of this game to games like kiss and

[20:32] I really am not a fan of kiss. Uh, it's it's a brutal game

[20:36] Uh, it's a beautiful game, but the gameplay just does not do a whole lot for me

[20:41] I'm really hoping that erosmith doesn't

[20:44] Fallen to some of the you know

[20:46] The traps that eros that uh, that uh, kiss kind of had in terms of some real cheap outland drains and you know

[20:53] Some straight down the middle shots and stuff

[20:55] But overall I'm very excited for it. I think that their integration of the LCD seems like it's even better on erosmith than it was on Batman

[21:03] so um

[21:05] I've gotten to play Batman now for a few weeks and I've had a lot of fun with it

[21:09] I had a lot more fun with it the second time I played it than the first um, but I but I do recognize some of the

[21:17] Issues people have in terms of just sort of the the bearness of the playfield and some of the shots, but

[21:22] erosmith looks like it was a pretty decent labor of love for stern

[21:26] I don't think that they found that game in honestly, you know, I think that

[21:29] It was a pretty well put together machine even though the layout may not have been quite as inspired as it could have been

[21:35] Yep, so you know, look, I think they they fixed kiss and they called it erosmith. I mean

[21:41] Everything in erosmith is just an improvement and it's almost like kiss was a

[21:46] Beta run to get to erosmith

[21:49] I think the art is incredible. I actually think it is better than even metallic art

[21:53] I think he's sort of learned how to to lay out a playfield and just it looks stunning. I haven't played it

[22:01] I you know erosmith is one of those bands that sort of like I like them

[22:04] I don't love them like I wouldn't go pay to see them in concert, but

[22:08] If their music comes on I enjoy driving to their songs and I think you know, they're

[22:13] hugely popular so

[22:15] I think it's gonna be you know, it's one of their cornerstone games. I was talking um

[22:21] To someone that's throwing the other day and they say they come out with three cornerstone games a year

[22:26] And so I asked is erosmith a cornerstone they said yes

[22:30] So this is one of the big ones now. I think we can assume star was would be one of the other so

[22:34] I don't know what the third cornerstone will be is it pulp fiction? Who knows people we don't know

[22:40] But that's another one that I think stern's probably gonna have a bunch of erosmiths playing at

[22:45] so

[22:47] I look forward to flipping it. I won't buy one. It's not on my

[22:50] To buy list and I don't think you can make any money flipping an erosmith le so for those reasons I'm out

[22:56] Yeah, well, I mean look at the the kiss le's man people are just sitting on those things there's screwed

[23:03] I was about to buy a kiss refinery edition le and I'm like I'm gonna flip this Brenda hand drawn artwork. It's gonna be

[23:10] 12 grand

[23:12] Yeah, yeah, I mean

[23:14] Let's face it the distributors are still sitting on new inbox kiss le's right. I mean they are I know

[23:21] at least one or two of them that are so

[23:24] um

[23:26] I'll say this I think that for the people that really really enjoy

[23:30] Kiss um, they love the game. I know people that are just die hard fans and they'll never talk bad about it

[23:35] But I think deep down you know that

[23:39] You can see that they wish that maybe there's a little bit more to it or that some of the shots were a little bit better

[23:44] um, but I do I do agree with you. I really hope that

[23:48] That erosmith is sort of a better version of the kiss honestly. Yeah, I and from all the early reports. It sounds like it is

[23:55] It sounds like it is so

[23:57] I don't like I don't think it's gonna come anywhere close to the excitement

[24:01] Stern drummed up with Batman and with Ghostbusters

[24:03] So I think people are still just like money in the wallet waiting for Star Wars announcement. We know it's coming

[24:09] We're not gonna hear anything soon. I I've been tapping all of my Stern contacts and

[24:15] I was like you gonna announce Star Wars on May 4th and I don't think that's happening. I don't think that's happening

[24:21] I think it's gonna be

[24:22] Something closer to Expo of 2017. So we've got to wait. We've got a long. Yeah, I mean, I you know

[24:30] I you and I have discussed it before and and it from a marketing standpoint

[24:34] It seems like may is just the absolute perfect time frame for them to do it because it is the 40th

[24:39] anniversary and it does hit on Star Wars day and all that stuff but

[24:44] Yeah, at the same time they've got this new film coming out in December and so it wouldn't surprise me if they just end up timing it with that although

[24:51] That would be kind of ironic considering the new games are gonna be completely based on the original trilogy. So

[24:57] it's kind of weird

[24:59] And I'm sure you're thinking this from a marketing standpoint

[25:02] How they're how they're gonna announce this thing because you would think they would want to tie it into all the original stuff in May

[25:09] But then it seems like they may just not be ready to release it to the fall closer to the new film

[25:14] Yeah, I mean at the end of the day Star Wars is like announcing

[25:18] You found the fountain of youth like it doesn't matter when you announced it. It doesn't matter where you announced it

[25:25] It's gonna sell out and it will sell for a decade

[25:32] Like I just don't see an end to it and I think they're gonna

[25:36] Sell thousands of these for the original trilogy and then they're gonna make one based on the new trilogy at the end of its run and sell thousands of those

[25:47] so

[25:48] I'm waiting to see what they do. I think the big question I have with Stern around Star Wars is whether or not they super early it or not and

[25:57] While I've heard from some people that no, they're not going to I got to imagine

[26:02] How do you not super early Star Wars?

[26:07] Yeah, I mean it seems like a it would miss opportunity if they did not do that

[26:13] Of course there are a lot of people in the hobby that would just see it as a huge cash grab at the same time but

[26:18] Take my cat there there are die hard fans out there

[26:22] I mean look at the die hard fans that clamored for Batman 66, you know

[26:26] And and I get the appeal of that game

[26:28] There are a lot of people in this hobby that that fondly grew up with that show and it had a beautiful art package on it

[26:36] And so they went after it but at the same time you're right Star Wars is just

[26:41] it is

[26:43] The biggest license that Stern will have worked with honestly up to this point and even though they they did it back in the day the East and say good days

[26:52] um

[26:53] To see them put the level of passion and effort and artistry into a new Star Wars machine like what we've seen with some of their recent releases

[27:03] You can't help but think that it's just gonna blow the doors off of all the original machines that came out before it right

[27:10] See, I don't think I'm part of me just doesn't think that goes by not go asbestos

[27:14] But Batman 66 is gonna age very well and and I think it already looks a little bit like

[27:21] A game built in two errors which it was and I just think when the new stuff comes out though

[27:27] the

[27:28] The creativeness the innovation that went into Batman. I just I just don't see it in that game, you know, I mean it's

[27:36] I there was so much hype around the mech in the upper left corner and and I get what it does

[27:41] I get what it does

[27:42] But it just doesn't feel like if they were gonna start from scratch from a blank piece of paper

[27:48] And and draw out the world of Batman 66 on a playfield. I just don't think you come up with that design at all

[27:56] No, I mean, I think that you're absolutely right this game

[28:01] Does I think it's always going to feel like a little bit of a re-skin that it was a re-themed game

[28:07] It they're just design elements in that game that you don't really see stern putting into their modern games today, you know

[28:16] so

[28:18] Yeah, I mean maybe we wouldn't feel that way if

[28:21] The Batman Dark Knight version had not come out before it

[28:25] But I think you're right. I think there would have been some more ingenuity in terms of the mechs and how they were utilized in the game

[28:31] Yeah, had it had it been a custom design game and not based on something else

[28:36] I mean like the crane while while cool

[28:40] Didn't even make sense when it was in Batman the dark night and it's like right

[28:45] Is this is like thing that just appears in the game that is the predominant

[28:51] Bash toy and mech that's going on and it thematically doesn't even fit so

[28:58] All right, well, let's let's see so if we go down tpf and that's it's in like two weeks and so ladies and gentlemen out there

[29:03] Canada will be going to tpf and the reason I'm going is because Blake was gracious enough to say hey man

[29:08] You can crash in my room and I'm like all right you've convinced me

[29:12] I looked at playing tickets. It was it was only like

[29:16] Less than it was like 300 bucks round trip, which is nothing to get down there

[29:20] um to spend a full weekend

[29:22] um and like what are you looking forward to most at tpf and we'll go down like what the different like manufacturers and what they're bringing but

[29:32] What what's the main thing you're excited to go see at the show?

[29:36] So you know honestly, uh, let's see this will be the third year. I've gone to tpf and

[29:42] Honestly, it's it's the overall show

[29:45] It's hard to say that there's any one company or one game that I'm specifically going to see at this show

[29:50] It's it's the entire atmosphere of the show. It's a lot of it has to do with the people that run the show the people that you

[29:58] That my friends that will be driving up from Houston

[30:01] People that I know from the Dallas area that will be there and then ultimately it's it's all of the people from Pennside and all over the country in the world that are at the show

[30:09] That you get to meet that really makes it I gotta I get the show's great

[30:14] Don't tell me on this show imagine you're at the front of the line, right?

[30:18] And there's a there's a ginormous crowd behind you and you're got you can be line it

[30:24] To one game first with no line. What do you be line it towards?

[30:29] Uh

[30:31] Let's go down. Let's go down. What's gonna be there right? Let's let's put on the list

[30:35] Let's know I have a I have a top container because it's purely at a curiosity and we know so little about it and

[30:43] If there is a flip who Dini there

[30:45] That's probably the game I go to first because like I said we know absolutely nothing about that game in terms of what's it going to look like now

[30:54] How's it going to play now that balsars come on board and I do feel like we've seen enough of these other games that

[31:01] We kind of know to expect you know

[31:04] I think John Papa Luke's gonna walk in with like a sledgehammer and just run over to who Dini and just like

[31:11] break it into

[31:12] Um, I I would agree that who Dini is the most

[31:17] curious

[31:19] Pinball machine that is gonna be unveiled. I mean we have we have absolutely no clue. It is a completely fresh game

[31:27] It is redesigned new artists new everything

[31:31] um here's the thing and

[31:33] I I would say that I am probably most curious to to see who Dini let's talk a little bit about that because

[31:40] My gut tells me deep down in the canada gut that this game's not coming out this year

[31:47] and and the only reason I say that is

[31:50] They literally started from scratch in November right and to go from there

[31:57] To a fully working game

[31:59] coded

[32:01] production

[32:03] ready

[32:04] in a year

[32:07] From a company that

[32:09] Is brand new that

[32:11] just basically

[32:13] slapped together you know built 25 magic girls, but again like I don't consider that to be like a

[32:18] Testament to a

[32:20] production

[32:22] Know how for pinball because we all know the issues with magic girl

[32:26] I don't know I

[32:28] Part of me is just like oh I don't I think I think they're revealing it too early and I don't think they should show it so soon

[32:35] And because think about it it's it's March

[32:39] Yeah, when do we think this game's gonna come out

[32:42] But the earliest what like expo

[32:47] I feel like that the the absolutely only reason that they are

[32:52] Potentially gonna reveal this game show this game in any capacity is because they know that tpf is becoming the big show expo

[33:01] Expo is not where it's at anymore and and I think tpf is gonna be the big show that you see a lot of these

[33:08] um

[33:09] Manufacturers reveal some of the new stuff that they're working on and I think they're they're simply

[33:14] Just trying to get some of the hype. It's they know it's the one game that's gonna be there this year

[33:21] That really hasn't been revealed yet. We've seen Jetsons. We've seen Alien

[33:25] um

[33:26] Other than attack from Mars remake

[33:29] Which we haven't seen but we kind of know to expect on it

[33:32] There's there's nothing else that's brand-spaking new

[33:36] Other than maybe Elvira if that's a real game and it's really happening

[33:40] And if they happen to have it there to reveal

[33:45] They know that Houdini could take quite a bit of hype from the show, but you're right

[33:49] If all they're doing is showing a box of lights and let's say it can't flip and it's not much further along than what they've shown before

[33:57] Then it doesn't matter

[33:58] But if they go to that show and they've got a game that functions

[34:02] It plays in some capacity even if it's a early prototype because like you said they haven't been working on it that long

[34:10] I still think that's gonna draw some attention, you know

[34:14] All right, but like what's the point of hyping in March

[34:18] If unless you want to take pre-orders, right and then we're always gonna give pre-order money

[34:25] To American pinball

[34:27] There's always a sucker born every minute. I mean, it's like if there's a sucker

[34:31] It's just like well why go in early. I mean they haven't really yeah announced like oh, we're only gonna make

[34:37] 300 or 500 and there's like 200 Ellie's whatever there's no urgency. Yeah, you're saying there's no urgency

[34:43] So what my point is anyone who goes to tpf and I get tpf is the big show

[34:49] But I feel like anyone who goes to tpf anyone who's into pinball who's a dork like us who actually follows the shows

[34:57] That person will get excited by a new pinball machine

[35:01] Wherever and whenever it's like revealed, right? It doesn't matter like it doesn't matter if I see it in front of me or if I see a video where it's like

[35:09] Amazing gameplay footage

[35:11] So my my thing is like I think American pinball is anxious to put the John pop a Duke chapter behind them and this is sort of like

[35:21] All right, we kind of embarrassed ourselves a little bit at expo by being stuck in that quagmire where we're

[35:28] We're still talking mostly about magic girl. We got Joe Balser up here saying

[35:33] Basically, we're gonna boot john, you know and move Houdini in a new direction

[35:37] And I think they want to start a new and they want people to see American

[35:40] I think they for the most part like I think they want to just show like here's a new cabinet

[35:45] That this is what American pinball games are gonna look like here's Houdini, you know, in its current state

[35:52] But there's no way that they've had time to like build mechanisms and and the engineering that needs to go into a

[36:00] Fully flipping game if they started like in November, December

[36:04] I mean, I just can't see

[36:06] the game being that

[36:08] Far enough along. I don't think people are gonna jump on and flip it as what I'm saying

[36:11] I think you're they might pull the curtain off something

[36:14] But I don't think it's gonna be on the floor to flip well that that brings up a good a good point

[36:19] You know, maybe this is even though you've got a specific title associated with this game

[36:23] You've got a Houdini machine that they're revealing

[36:26] Maybe this is more about

[36:28] revealing the fact that American pinball is a real company that they're not just

[36:33] Here to build 25 machines at John Ode people

[36:37] That they actually are a creative force that can also manufacture these games and they can be reliable

[36:44] So maybe this is about

[36:45] Proving something about the company and not necessarily about the title that they were revealing right so

[36:51] But here's the thing I think

[36:53] We're in a climate now where

[36:56] No one cares what you say right? This is like post-dutch pinballs collapse

[37:02] Post skid bees collapse

[37:05] Andrew highway making people wait two years jack making people wait two three years

[37:11] So they get up there and they say whatever they say right even if they show something

[37:18] I don't think people

[37:20] Believe that there's a path to production and that a company knows that a produce pinball machines and get them out the door

[37:28] Until there's a game in a box and I know like I know like I'm you know

[37:32] That's easier said than done right?

[37:34] I mean companies have to show how the sausages made when they're new so they can get hype and excitement and some money coming through the door

[37:43] I just think it's early. I think it's early. I think they're gonna um

[37:47] I also think there this is I think a challenge they face and this is like

[37:52] It kind of sucks because John's version of Houdini was was sexy as hell. It was gorgeous

[38:00] It didn't it didn't freaking work as Ben Heck pointed out

[38:04] It's very much another version of magic girl where shots go nowhere ball can't get over here

[38:09] But it looked beautiful and I think

[38:13] Whatever they show and I told this to the American pinball guys. I said you guys should retain

[38:19] Matt Andrews the artist and they went in a different direction

[38:22] I think that was a mistake the bar is really high on the aesthetics of Houdini

[38:28] And I'm wondering if they can raise the bar from what we've seen

[38:32] Yeah, I mean I got to be honest with you. I was very surprised to hear that they

[38:37] Decided not to go with mats or work on that game because

[38:41] That was never an issue and I think that there was certainly some appreciation people had for that game

[38:46] Because it did have some beautiful artwork and

[38:49] so

[38:50] man if if they

[38:52] I'd like to see how if at all they raised the bar higher than using his artwork

[38:57] Who did they go with to get even better artwork than what he had already produced so

[39:03] You know like you said a while back somebody needs to pick Matt up and they really need to to use his talents to the fullest

[39:09] Seems like he wants to be involved. Yeah, I'm I'm fully confident. We haven't seen that the last of Matt with

[39:16] No, I don't think so either somebody's gonna pick him up

[39:20] So all right, so Houdini we both want to go play do we do we then go next to

[39:26] for me I would go next to

[39:29] Trying to think I'd probably go play total annihilation second. Yeah, that that game

[39:36] Man, I was watching the live stream on that game the other evening and

[39:40] What a badass game, right? It is so cool and it's

[39:44] It's simple. It's obviously got a pretty complex rule set

[39:48] But the layout seems simple when you look at it

[39:51] But man, it's a it's a screaming game and I mean it it just uh

[39:57] I just want to see what the artwork's gonna look for this look like for this thing you know

[40:01] I mean it's got this killer soundtrack to it and I really want to see how they're gonna flesh the game out more

[40:08] I think through that game kind of like wrath of the Olympus if it's developed well enough

[40:13] And it's got a great enough art package on it

[40:15] I could certainly see somebody trying to pick that game up and actually manufacture it is 10 times cooler than wrath of Olympus without even any art

[40:23] I think that it actually is you know

[40:26] I use wrath of Olympus as an example because that game was a pretty well-built game. It was flushed out. It had a

[40:33] Finished feel to it and it did seem like a game that some manufacturer could pick up and actually make you know

[40:40] But total annihilation also seems that way and

[40:44] Man, I think it's I think it's a great idea

[40:46] It to me it feels like a combination like with the music and the lights kind of got that like 80s like stranger things and like that movie drive

[40:53] It's got that like like Brian Dupam a like Scarface music like I just love

[40:59] The yeah, like it's just cool like I it's hard to explain like if you can turn on a pinball machine and immediately

[41:07] It's just doing things with audio and visual that just like blow you away

[41:11] I love the way the lights are going on it like I've never seen a light show so freaking cool on any machine ever

[41:16] It's like man. It's I'm excited and Scott who's working on it. He's gonna be there

[41:22] With the game so that's where I would go to second now Blake. Where do you go to third after total annihilation?

[41:29] Uh

[41:31] I would probably go check out alien

[41:32] I I would just add a curiosity

[41:34] I want to even though I've seen the videos and we've seen a lot of the game over the years

[41:40] um

[41:41] To be able to actually flip it myself and and feel how the shots feel and

[41:46] Experience the game in person

[41:49] That's what I would want to check out and really closely behind that

[41:52] To be honest with you, I'd like to I'm excited to go check out Jetsons

[41:55] I think that even as simple as that game is going to be I think that it's probably still gonna have a pretty good fun factor to it

[42:01] So okay, so alien and jetsons. Okay, I can't go play alien. So you got you got there

[42:07] The next game I would go check out

[42:11] Uh, just because I want to see like the new code and and I still think this was by far the best game

[42:17] At expo and I also think it's gonna I think be the best game of the year is dialed in

[42:23] I yeah, I just there's something like I

[42:27] I keep it keeps like growing on me like every day

[42:31] I look at the videos. I'm like wow

[42:34] Like this is like pat lawler's magic girl like this is his labor of love for years

[42:39] And I think it got kind of like early dismissed and I think people are watching it now being like wait a minute like

[42:46] The light shows incredible the shots are incredible like the all the toys he put into it without and it like

[42:52] It still plays fast. It's not like it's like slowed down with all the stuff in it

[42:56] Uh, and then you got the screen with all the technology in it and the fun elements the emoji modes the the selfie modes

[43:05] They play with your cell phone like all that cool shit

[43:08] Uh, I don't know it just

[43:11] For me like I just think it's got the total package and I think the more people play it the more they're gonna be like

[43:16] You know what like I can get over the name. I'm now playing. I think one of like pets best games ever

[43:22] Yeah, actually

[43:24] Yeah, you know until you just mentioned it

[43:27] I'm a little embarrassed to say I'd kind of forgotten about it and it's partially because of

[43:31] Just the announcement was at expo. It's it's kind of coming gone and

[43:35] We've seen a couple that have gone out for testing on on location and stuff, but

[43:40] I have to agree with you to be honest with you. I would probably go

[43:43] Over to dialed in well before I go to alien honestly because

[43:48] That game I am a lot more curious about. I do feel like we've seen enough of alien that I kind of know what I'm getting with it

[43:53] But I heard very good things from people that have played dialed in

[43:57] not just yourself and

[43:59] I am very curious about that game. I'm a huge pat law or fan. I love a lot of his games and

[44:05] I think you're right. I think that game's gonna it's gonna grow some legs and

[44:10] I feel bad about kind of forgetting about it honestly. I you know

[44:14] All right, we all forget about dialed in I mean it's not it's not a theme that we grew up or have any emotional bond to

[44:22] But we only love is that pat's going to the games that are on location in Chicago. He's personally going

[44:29] and tweaking it

[44:31] Based upon what he's hearing from people out in the field and what he's what he's seeing in terms of like how the game is like

[44:38] Holding up

[44:39] Because I saw a lot of different photos of that right magnet

[44:43] Has just it's just like eating its way through the wood. I mean the the the art is gone

[44:49] And it's all the way down to like the bare wood. So that's that's like bad and good news. It's bad that like

[44:57] Shit like I hope they have a saw but it's good because

[45:00] Um, they definitely will make sure that that area is either cliffied up or has some mylar down

[45:06] Now but like I have to before we go on about tp. I have to make a station break and remind people of a correction

[45:12] Because I got an email. I got an email from cliffy himself

[45:15] In my last podcast when I said that cliffy did not

[45:21] Invent

[45:23] Playfield protectors

[45:26] He reminded me and I didn't know this he said that he did invent his style of playfield protector in 1998

[45:35] Prior to him creating them no pinball machine had a protector that covered the top of the playfield

[45:43] At best there were scoop liners being made but his were the only

[45:48] line the that that line the inside of the scoop

[45:51] Um and the top surface no one had done this before so cliffy

[45:55] Cliff you're out there home of the world's finest pinball protectors

[46:00] Canada has clarified that you are the man

[46:03] And I hope you make a cliffy for my scoop on magic rub because

[46:06] It fires that ball out of there like like a like a nuclear missile

[46:10] So we're gonna need some help all right so dial then we're both excited to play

[46:15] Where do we go from dial then?

[46:19] Oh

[46:21] You know i um

[46:24] I'm very curious to see what gerry and the p3 guys are gonna bring

[46:27] I think that they are going into tpf to make a very big splash quite honestly especially now that they

[46:35] have

[46:36] You know started production

[46:38] According to what they've said and um, I believe there are they they're bringing a couple new games with the pl3 p3 platform this year

[46:47] so

[46:48] I'm kind of curious to see what they're gonna do with that

[46:50] I'm curious to see what the artworks going to look like for some of that

[46:54] If there are gonna be new new artwork packages um

[46:58] I've always

[46:59] Been very impressed with their platform. I think that

[47:03] They have consistently been doing some of the most new innovative work in the industry in terms of how mechanisms are used and stuff like that

[47:11] um

[47:12] But

[47:14] I want to see them really build up the creative aspect of it from a theming standpoint

[47:19] I guess i'm sorry

[47:20] Are you so polite? You want a license theme everyone else does too

[47:23] I I you know

[47:25] I think that any original theme can be really really well done with the right

[47:31] Imagination the right creative team behind it right but you're right

[47:35] I mean we we all do want to see license themes

[47:38] I'm especially curious to see what a license thing would look like on the p3 platform

[47:42] Yeah, it's probably challenging to

[47:45] Figure out how to get that full screen with a license ip like how do you what do you put down there?

[47:50] But I I agree when when the license theme hits p3 it's gonna be really interesting now

[47:56] Like I gotta give you shit man because you haven't even stopped by spooky yet and aren't they showing spooky game number three

[48:05] Are they unveiling it? I I

[48:07] I am not so sure they're gonna show spooky number three and that's the reason I haven't brought it up

[48:12] I thought they were for sure gonna show spooky number three they they've never said that they were going to reveal number three

[48:20] I think in a show this is like

[48:22] I think that they fully intended to bring jetsons as a first opportunity to play that game for people

[48:29] um, I

[48:31] I am no longer sure that they're going to bring another game to the show

[48:36] Huh, yeah

[48:38] So

[48:39] And and and that is I have no insider information. I'm not gonna lie and Charlie and Katie and everybody there

[48:46] I love them. They're great people and

[48:49] um

[48:50] I am absolutely excited to see what they're going to do with game number three

[48:54] But I'm just not sure that they're ready to show it at tpf yet honestly

[48:59] So we also forgot to mention Blake that you designed the logo for tpf now

[49:03] We're not gonna go into that it just it looks awesome. You did a great job

[49:06] I just want to remind people that you are this is the man who um who changed the logo for tpf

[49:12] It looks really awesome actually gave them a logo

[49:16] Yeah, yeah, they didn't they didn't have one

[49:18] Thank you. I mean they actually didn't have one

[49:21] They they knew that they they had been theming the show every year off of certain games

[49:25] But they never never really had a standard corporate logo for the show. So

[49:30] Thank you. I appreciate the the feedback on it. I've I've appreciate everybody's feedback that I've gotten and it was a huge honor to get to work with ed and Kim and all the tpf folks on that

[49:41] So yeah, thanks. Thanks for mentioning that. Yeah

[49:44] Um

[49:45] All right, so let me ask you a question. So how are the Dutch pinball guys gonna get out of their alive

[49:56] Are we absolutely sure they're still coming? I

[49:59] They're they're on for I believe I think it's like

[50:03] Three o'clock on Saturday. Let me yeah. Yeah. No, I think you're right as far as I know they haven't backed out yet um

[50:10] Wow

[50:13] I hope they brought a rope ladder to get out of the hole with they've dug themselves into

[50:18] Because oh hell, I don't know. I mean, you know people are so damn polite when they're in person and they're actually face to face with people

[50:26] I don't know

[50:28] How aggressive people will be when they have access to talking to to yop in person

[50:34] um, but

[50:36] Man you you would you would hope that people are gonna ask some questions and I imagine Dutch is gonna try to sugarcane

[50:42] Everything as best as they can but

[50:45] but man

[50:47] I mean if they come with any other news other than

[50:51] We have a solve with a Ra

[50:54] Yeah, they're gonna get linched at that show by by rare hero if he's there of Greg goes that show

[51:00] He's gonna he's gonna murder them. I mean

[51:02] It is so you know, he's just reading this there's a great interview with Dutch pinball in pinball magazine

[51:08] And I have to give a plug to pinball magazine because if you guys haven't read

[51:12] A pinball magazine from cover to cover. I think you're missing out on the best source for for pinball news

[51:20] and they the way that magazine goes

[51:23] Intimately into all of the major news elements going on and all the major manufacturers is absolutely incredible

[51:30] But there was a big

[51:31] Peace on Dutch pinball about like a 10 page story and it was interesting because one of the things they they they

[51:36] Prided themselves on was transparency and credibility and honesty with their customer base. That's gone

[51:42] Like that yeah

[51:44] That is gone and they talked a lot in that article about how

[51:49] thankful they were and how reliant they were on a Ra

[51:54] for

[51:55] For everything from helping them design and manufacture key components of the game

[52:00] To their contract manufacturing capabilities knowing that they owe those guys

[52:05] The money it's

[52:08] the the train has stopped

[52:11] And I don't know what they can do other than

[52:15] Come to an agreement with a Ra. I mean a Ra makes the I believe that they manufacture the boards

[52:21] They manufacture the the bowling alley assembly

[52:24] They're putting the games together and the word is that they're holding like 50 machines hostage until they get paid

[52:32] Yeah, I think that um

[52:35] I think they're really at a Ra's mercy at this point honestly they

[52:39] I do think the resolution to this is is eventually going to be that they'll work it out

[52:44] I don't know how long or how soon that'll that'll take for it to happen

[52:47] But I think they know that I mean

[52:50] A Ra doesn't need Dutch pinball

[52:53] To stay in business probably they've probably got other projects they can be working on beyond this and

[52:59] Dutch pinball needs them a whole lot more honestly

[53:01] So otherwise are they are they really going to go try to find a whole new manufacturer that they can

[53:09] Take all these parts and all these plans and get these games started up again with all from never gonna happen

[53:15] No, I don't think so you never gonna happen

[53:17] Because they'll never get those 50 games out of a Ra

[53:21] And they can't afford that kind of loss you know, it's what the reason why I think this thing is not

[53:26] Good is is the way a Ra like

[53:29] Send out their own letter to like Dutch pinball buyers basically throwing Dutch under the bus being like you might you know

[53:36] We we read that

[53:38] Dutch is saying there were board issues. There are no board issues. They owe us money

[53:42] You know, it was like that blunt

[53:44] Uh, that's not good and whenever

[53:47] Something that is ostensibly headed for like a legal battle becomes

[53:52] public

[53:53] Bickering I'm within forums it means that both sides are

[53:59] Fed up with each other to the point where they don't even care. They'll like air out their dirty laundry out in the forums

[54:04] So let's see what they say we're gonna we're gonna hear from them. I'm looking right now they're

[54:10] Saturday yep three p.m. Dutch pinball in the seminar room. So we'll see what happens then

[54:15] So let's see we see another home run from Dennis Nordman is at seven p.m. on Friday. What is that?

[54:21] Is that his baseball game? Is it a baseball game or is he gonna new game?

[54:27] You know I have been really curious. I think

[54:31] Is that all right?

[54:32] Dennis and Greg were were two of the first attendees or guests

[54:36] That they announced to be present at the show this year like they announced that

[54:40] You know not long after last year's show I believe and

[54:44] They they've got to have something up their sleeve

[54:46] I mean it's been long enough that woe nellies on the back burner now they're they're done with that and

[54:53] I yeah, I have a feeling they're gonna be revealing something new at this show and I do

[54:58] I do find it suspicious that they're doing this whole L.v.a.a. panel and everything together and

[55:04] They've said that it's going to be something exciting. It's it's like come on just come out and say that you're doing a new game

[55:10] You know I can totally see

[55:13] Them contracting with stern like they did on woe nellie

[55:16] To build a very expensive

[55:19] high-end

[55:20] Limited run L.v.a.a.a.a.a.a. game for the diehard collectors. I mean

[55:25] The people the people have proven that they're willing to drop 10,000 to 15,000 dollars on these exclusive games

[55:33] You know what's what's 300 L.v.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a. Games for them to crank off the line

[55:37] They'll sell well over what they're they're gonna sell for new if that's all they make, you know

[55:42] And it would it would complete the trilogy right there's two L.v.a.a.a.a.a.a.a. Games right and there's scared stiff and there's L.v.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.

[55:48] The party monsters is that and is that right? Yeah. Yeah, that was it

[55:53] Well, I think I think that's gonna be interesting. I mean L.v.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a. as one of those things. I know she's gonna be at the show

[56:00] That just sort of like it's like a little like creepy like old dude kind of like you know like if you're like

[56:06] If you if you're still like into alvira, you're sort of I mean

[56:11] I'm more of like a Kate Upton kind of guy, you know, I think it's like I don't know

[56:16] I just picture these six-year-old dudes with like some Vaseline in the bathroom like about to pre-order the game

[56:24] All right, let's see what else was it called scared stiff for no reason yeah

[56:30] Oh, let's see what else is like are we missing anybody? So we got jerry's jack

[56:36] Stern we talked about aerosmith

[56:39] I don't think Stern shows anything other than that

[56:42] No, you do think it is captain Nemo gonna be there is he gonna surface from

[56:47] 60,000 leagues in the sea and then actually appear at Texas Pimbo. I don't think anyone's gonna bring one of those

[56:51] You know, I was wondering since those games are starting to trickle out

[56:55] I was curious if one of those was gonna end up with the show, but not that I'm aware of

[56:59] I haven't I'm not gonna lie. I haven't researched that at all. I don't know if there is gonna be one

[57:04] I would think that they would be kind of advertising that a little bit the game looks

[57:07] I mean, it's still looks really cool looks a little simple, but I think the R package is gorgeous and

[57:13] Yeah, you know, I just it's just feels like it's been forever

[57:17] They like shipped like one or two and then it's been like a two-year delay

[57:20] So it's hard to sort of get people re-interested. You know what game we haven't talked about and it just shows how little

[57:25] Interest I think there's gonna be in it and how little we even care is just attacked from Mars remake

[57:31] Yeah, I mean are we absolutely we're not even sure if the game is gonna be revealed to tpf

[57:37] I think it's just been a lot of speculation up to this point, but um

[57:42] Yeah

[57:44] So what I guess some of the rumors that have been going around is that supposedly the game is going to have some new aspects to it

[57:50] That were not part of the original

[57:52] Balli release and so do we assume that that may be like updated artwork or something or

[57:59] Do they you know

[58:01] Go to an LCD from a DMD or something like that. I don't know. I mean

[58:07] They would have to make I think that if it had a new art package on it that looked really cool

[58:14] That could could attract some interest in the game, but other than that we know what the game is

[58:20] You know the demand has never been as high for that game as it was for medieval madness

[58:25] so

[58:26] I still stand by what you and I have talked about before

[58:30] PPS needs to focus on

[58:33] Trying to do games that were so rare that nobody's ever played him like right

[58:38] Kingpin would be a goldmine for them and it's it's a beautiful game nobody's hardly ever seen one in person

[58:46] um

[58:48] That would be the smart way to go

[58:50] See, I think if they redo kingpin though it needs to be like all a big bang bar where

[58:56] Only make like a hundred to a hundred and fifty

[59:01] Charge 20 grand for them

[59:05] And keep it super limited. I don't know when you take the ground and you just sort of mass produce it

[59:12] It it ruins the whole

[59:15] Sort of specialty of the game itself like

[59:19] You know, I I don't know. I mean, it's like

[59:21] I

[59:22] Just would hate I love that kingpin is this like rare thing in the wild that

[59:28] Almost made it almost made it out

[59:30] But python angelo like convinced them to come out with like like a soccer game or something and in ahead of it and then they closed the division down

[59:40] um

[59:41] so

[59:43] Blake

[59:44] Do you think anyone is gonna sell any of these magic girls for 30 40 50 thousand dollars?

[59:51] um

[59:53] I think that

[59:55] Yeah, there will probably be some that change hands. I don't know if if you're really looking at the 50,000 mark for those

[01:00:03] But I think it's me really quiet. I think that

[01:00:07] You brought this up I think on your last episode that anybody who's a serious buyer on one of these games

[01:00:13] They're well aware what the story is they know what they're getting themselves into in terms of the playability of the game and stuff

[01:00:19] And I think that they would be buying it

[01:00:22] Uh kind of for similar reason similar reasons like you did in terms of

[01:00:26] Having it as a piece of artwork having it for the story and then there's always that lingering possibility that the game could actually be finished and made functional

[01:00:34] But it's sort of the long shot, you know, so

[01:00:38] You know, I I would not be surprised if some of them do change hands for a substantial amount of money like around 30,000

[01:00:46] But I think it's gonna be kept really really quiet

[01:00:50] Well, they need to put a bumper in front of the ramp because the top of my ramp the little piece of plastic

[01:00:57] flew off today

[01:01:01] Yeah, I was playing and I'm like wait, what's that first? I panic because I thought it was like

[01:01:06] Something crucial somewhere important. It's like just a barely like the corner and then I look at the ramp and I'm like yeah

[01:01:13] Like there's nothing there's nothing preventing the ball from smacking the plastic like dead on

[01:01:20] Yeah, and I'm and I'm just like and then the other funny part is I'm like let me check my computer

[01:01:26] On my magic girl to see how many plays and I know how many times I've played it and I've probably played it

[01:01:34] since I've had it

[01:01:37] 30

[01:01:37] 30 to 35 times, okay

[01:01:40] Guess what number came up Blake in terms of total number of plays that's recorded in my magic girl computer system

[01:01:50] Uh

[01:01:52] Probably at 25

[01:01:55] 859 plays

[01:02:00] Wow, and it clearly wasn't played much at American Pimbo or tested and

[01:02:07] Part of me is like did John just jack this number up to make it hard for people to resell it

[01:02:13] probably

[01:02:15] The whole week anything can you

[01:02:17] It games just the it's the whole things are freaking enigma you know, I look at it and it is gorgeous. It's right here

[01:02:23] Um, I was talking to Scott at American Pimball today just trying to figure out like replacement parts

[01:02:28] I mean I'd love to buy a few extra ramps and some extra and extra play field and maybe some plastic set

[01:02:36] Um, I don't think that's ever gonna happen

[01:02:38] But I've come to the conclusion that I'm just gonna flip it and enjoy it

[01:02:41] I'm gonna in sense of like I'm gonna play it like I don't

[01:02:44] If if it gets fixed cool if it doesn't cool

[01:02:48] It's almost weird because the way it is now it almost plays like an EM in the sense that

[01:02:53] There's not really like code progression the way modern games have it

[01:02:57] But you can still play to beat your high score and you can still play to

[01:03:03] uh

[01:03:04] You know get through certain parts of the game like you could spell potion you can spell wizard

[01:03:09] You can get magniflip to light up

[01:03:11] So I have like these weird goals or like I want to get magniflip to save magniflip now

[01:03:16] Even if I can't go magniflip

[01:03:19] so

[01:03:20] It's it's just like this weird thing. It's I'll say this to call out to the music

[01:03:25] The the our everything's gorgeous except for the parts that John was in charge of which was the mechanics and

[01:03:31] Mechanically it looks really cool, but like nothing really works. So I think everyone

[01:03:37] ran for the bank too quickly and there's too many of them for sale right away

[01:03:40] And that's why none of them are selling because

[01:03:43] I would just wait I would just wait and I know a bunch of people who have extra magic girls that are also just waiting to sell it because they're

[01:03:50] You know, it's like am I really gonna be game number five six seven and eight for sale and then where do I price it?

[01:03:57] I mean

[01:03:59] You know honestly, I think yeah, there's some people that are trying to sell these games right now because they want to get on the hype train

[01:04:04] Around it because it's brand new, but

[01:04:07] What if people really got to lose by just hanging on to it if

[01:04:11] The game isn't gonna get any worse than it currently is

[01:04:16] If it just sits

[01:04:17] But there's also a potential for the game to get better if the coding actually gets fleshed out more with with apple juice and

[01:04:26] It's possible that some people may start tweaking the max or they can make them more functional if that happens

[01:04:32] And I know that's a lot of ifs

[01:04:35] That's only gonna help increase the value of the games especially for people that keep them new in box

[01:04:39] So they've got nothing to lose to sit on the game unless they just absolutely

[01:04:46] Want their money back out of it immediately, you know, no I agree and I think most people who bought magic are or

[01:04:51] Should be pretty well off financially and there's no rush to sell it and I think in the end at the end if it never gets fixed

[01:05:00] I think this machine a few years down the road will net out anywhere between 30 and 35 just because of the low number

[01:05:09] I think if it gets fixed I think you could see numbers

[01:05:14] 40 to 50

[01:05:16] No, no, no, there's only if there's only ever 25 ever made

[01:05:20] uh

[01:05:21] but

[01:05:23] those are

[01:05:24] Big ifs and the speculation on the 30 to 35 is not me showing the game because I want to sell it helped and I know what you're thinking

[01:05:31] uh, I just think that's I mean I but I also think that's years away and it's also it's also

[01:05:37] Depended on where the hobby goes right if the hobby

[01:05:41] keeps if more and more boutique companies pop up and other boutiques pop up that are successful

[01:05:47] and take john's elements but make them work

[01:05:51] magic grow will fade away and we'll keep losing value because it'll just always be seen as a as a colossal mistake

[01:06:00] But if pinball starts to stall and a lot more companies go out of business and magic girl becomes the

[01:06:08] you know sort of like

[01:06:09] the

[01:06:11] the nucleus of

[01:06:13] of like or represents the failure of the promise of boutique pinball

[01:06:17] Then it it'll it'll keep going up in value if if it's if it's only like stern making games or stern and spooky three years from now

[01:06:27] I think it it will increase in value but if

[01:06:30] You know when I in a world where like if Dutch pinball can like get their shit together and makes back to the future

[01:06:35] You know in a world where

[01:06:37] American pinball can be successful with the Houdini in a world where

[01:06:40] Total annihilation comes out and it's got the most kick ass art package

[01:06:44] You know who wants a magic girl that doesn't flip

[01:06:46] So

[01:06:47] It's gonna be interesting. I think I've been honest. I think people expected me to like open it up and be like I've got it

[01:06:54] No 50 grand

[01:06:57] Yeah, I mean, I think that you've been very fair in your assessment of it and and you know

[01:07:01] um

[01:07:03] That that's why I wasn't ashamed to go on pinside and also kind of

[01:07:08] Call some people out and just acknowledge a fact that look

[01:07:12] You know you happen to get one of the first games you happen to sit down give a fair unbiased assessment of it

[01:07:18] You shot video and and you you were you were very very um honest about what you had there and

[01:07:26] You know if anybody else had done that then they probably would have been just

[01:07:30] Singing their praises to the high heavens and but because it was you people were very critical of it

[01:07:35] I think that that was a little chicken shit on some people's parts and

[01:07:40] You know we really needed to look at it as an opportunity to see a game that many many people had never seen before

[01:07:47] We really didn't know it was really the first look behind the curtain of what this game was

[01:07:53] Because even what even what bill and the rest of the Pentasia folks that worked on it for the show over a year ago

[01:08:01] It's still just seemed

[01:08:04] It was kind of lackwester. I know there was a lot of disappointment but

[01:08:09] It gave us an idea of of what this game

[01:08:12] Looks like once it was actually released from john's hands, you know and we still saw that it was kind of a mess like john is

[01:08:20] But there was also a lot of genius there and um I did get the I did get the magnus save working

[01:08:26] I'm gonna do a video showing that it's like the right outlaying you hit the red flipper button

[01:08:32] And it grabs the ball with the magnet a magnet works. Oh

[01:08:37] So is there okay, so is there are there two flipper buttons on each side of the machine

[01:08:42] Yep, and the only and there's only supposed to be one on the right side

[01:08:47] But by mistake they drilled holes in on both sides so the left red button has no mechanism hooked up to it

[01:08:56] Oh, I see well, okay, it was so basically the magnet save is just like black nine. Yeah

[01:09:00] Okay, but here's the thing I can't

[01:09:03] I've never really used it effectively in normal gameplay like I can with glass off I can do it and it grabs

[01:09:09] But I'm not sure it'll grab the ball if the balls moving towards the outlaying with like a lot of velocity

[01:09:15] I've got to I got to see if I can time it perfectly. I spoke to

[01:09:20] PDX monkey he's he's open his two

[01:09:23] And he said he was able to use it during normal gameplay

[01:09:27] I will say I'm a little disappointed that more people who have got in their magic girls

[01:09:32] haven't really

[01:09:34] Shared much they haven't there's been like a few guys have

[01:09:37] Gone down the list, but maybe it's because they realized there was nothing new to add to the story

[01:09:44] I wish some of the people who had the

[01:09:46] The prototypes or the special ones like one of the

[01:09:50] That has like the different play field than mine would open it up and show us like

[01:09:55] If it plays any different if there's anything else in that one that's not in mine

[01:10:01] I know there's like outlaying posts that aren't in mine. That's a little frustrating

[01:10:04] But I think they actually removed those because the game is kind of

[01:10:07] It is kind of easy to have long ball time. So I think they might have just yanked him out because of that

[01:10:13] But I don't know I think uh like two weeks from now

[01:10:17] I really don't want to be talking about magic girl unless like the coder has an update or someone's mechanically

[01:10:23] Figured out a plan of attack because it just like nothing nothing there's nothing left to say. It's just this beautiful mess

[01:10:32] Yeah, I mean

[01:10:34] You know you know what you've got you kind of had an idea what you were going to be getting whenever you

[01:10:40] It was realistic realistically turning out that the games are going to ship so um

[01:10:46] Yeah, I think that at this point you have to be very happy with what you have it is

[01:10:51] I've always told you that you've you've had the right perspective on it

[01:10:54] It's a beautiful work of art

[01:10:55] It's got some pretty interesting provenos behind it in terms of the story and the history of how it got made

[01:11:02] And while there are a lot of people out there that may not really care or appreciate that

[01:11:07] um

[01:11:07] You know as long as you're happy with it and you enjoy turning it on and looking at it and occasionally playing it

[01:11:13] To the fullest that you can play it that's all that matters who cares when anybody else thinks who cares

[01:11:19] You know if if they care about what the rules said is or the coding or any of that stuff as long as you're happy with it

[01:11:25] And as long as you appreciate the beauty of the game

[01:11:29] That is the most important thing about that game. So yeah, I'll say this

[01:11:33] It's not gonna stay in my living room the whole it's not gonna make it the year it but I'm not selling it

[01:11:38] I've already I've already made arrangements for its next destination

[01:11:43] um

[01:11:44] It will be sitting probably next to my totem when it ends up where it's gonna go

[01:11:51] It'll be in a museum

[01:11:53] Like environment inside someone's house

[01:11:57] probably with a blanket over it

[01:12:01] and

[01:12:02] And the reason why is the place it would be going

[01:12:07] The individual the caretaker the curator

[01:12:10] uh

[01:12:11] If any updates ever did happen for the game

[01:12:14] uh, this gentleman could

[01:12:16] Could implement them for me because he's highly skilled at restoring games and working on pinball machines

[01:12:23] So I think that's the best scenario for it for the show and it look and also like

[01:12:29] If I ever did want to sell it

[01:12:32] His location is also easy for it to be picked up it picking up a game from my apartment requires

[01:12:39] The door to come off my apartment

[01:12:42] It's moving furniture. It's a fucking nightmare for me to get a pin in here

[01:12:46] um

[01:12:48] Now that being said there's like two machines that

[01:12:52] Would possibly go here

[01:12:54] Uh, and the two machines that I'm going back and forth between

[01:12:59] Are dialed in in Star Wars and I need to I need to figure it out because I just like

[01:13:04] One of those two is it will will be the one that I got this year

[01:13:08] Well the good news is I think that you should

[01:13:11] Reddely be able to get either one of those. I mean by the time Star Wars gets announced and comes out dialed in should

[01:13:18] Well be it on its way to to having shipped for a few months and

[01:13:23] You'll have a chance to have played it more learn if you really really love the game

[01:13:27] I think if you're ever going to want to get in on a dialed in it doesn't sound like there's going to be any trouble getting one

[01:13:33] so

[01:13:34] You know, I think that

[01:13:36] Getting in on a Star Wars just at least getting your spot held. That's the right

[01:13:40] Start, you know, at least get your place in line and then if the game doesn't turn out to be what you expected then

[01:13:46] You shouldn't have any trouble getting a dialed in so um it's so hard because I know dialed in is just gonna be

[01:13:54] It's just gonna like be the more like

[01:13:58] I don't want to say better build, but you know Jersey jacks

[01:14:01] It's just a different level above sternant it just in terms of like the materials, right?

[01:14:05] And I hope Star Wars

[01:14:09] Has the value in terms of like the physicality of the game might the theme is

[01:14:15] Forget it like the theme is like a ten dialed in is like a three in terms of theme

[01:14:21] but

[01:14:22] I don't there's just something about like you know

[01:14:25] Imagine if like if Jersey Jack made Star Wars and it was law their designing it then I'd be like a pig and shit

[01:14:30] but

[01:14:32] There's compromises on both sides is what I'm saying and yeah, I just think that um

[01:14:37] You know knowing richies designing Star Wars

[01:14:41] You know is it gonna be like a lot of ramps and a heavy ramp flow game and I don't I

[01:14:48] I need a Star Wars game that uses magnets a lot. I need force. I need the ball to be forescraved

[01:14:56] And if it doesn't have that I swear to god I swear to god

[01:15:00] If it also doesn't have

[01:15:03] An X-wing fighter that you have to like raise up from the swamp

[01:15:08] Sort of like when you know when Lucas and Dagobah

[01:15:11] like it

[01:15:13] I just had this like

[01:15:14] Vision for like imagine this imagine like the X-wing is like in a lower playfield and like

[01:15:21] The swamp water like opens up and the actual like X-wing like comes up from like underneath

[01:15:27] When you complete the mode. I mean it's be fucking incredible. Yeah, I mean there. There's so much potential

[01:15:36] Yeah, I think that that might be

[01:15:39] They still need to do my coding thing that when you fire

[01:15:42] Against the Death Star

[01:15:45] Machine need to go off and you need to use the force

[01:15:48] I thought I've always thought that was a pretty brilliant idea actually

[01:15:52] I think that would be awesome and that would be something that's pretty easy to implement just encoding alone

[01:15:56] So

[01:15:57] But I'm I'm with you starwars is such a rich

[01:16:01] You know property to to use

[01:16:04] um, I am a little concerned because Steve does typically build these games that have a lot of flow to them

[01:16:10] They're very fast, but they don't tend to have a whole lot of

[01:16:14] Uh, really unique mechanisms that will like stop the ball and allow the ball to interact with that mechanism because it slows down

[01:16:22] He doesn't design games again like I'm not knocking

[01:16:26] Or I'll knock a little bit

[01:16:28] Like take game of Thrones for example

[01:16:30] He doesn't really design the game

[01:16:33] To bring the universe of that world to life under glass. He does it. I would agree with that like Star Trek

[01:16:41] These stick if you stick the enterprise in the middle

[01:16:43] But it's just I think he designs a game to have flow to have ramps to have like incredible like geometry

[01:16:52] But I don't think he looks at it and says

[01:16:55] How do I bring this world of Star Wars?

[01:16:57] Forget flow for a minute just what are like the magical mechs that I want to put like I I would be more excited if I found out

[01:17:05] Trudeau is making Star Wars versus Richie

[01:17:07] Yeah, well and and

[01:17:11] You know it it just it really depends because

[01:17:15] I agree with you. I think that

[01:17:17] Trudeau picks some really great ideas for Ghostbusters and

[01:17:21] Made them actually he he designed some great new ideas and mechs that also fed into the story and the the universe of that theme

[01:17:31] You know, so like the magna the magna slings for example

[01:17:36] I even consider the the ramp that goes on the play field for the river of slime

[01:17:39] I thought that was pretty well done as well and it feeds into the actual story that's being told by the property

[01:17:46] Steve on the other hand. Yeah, the games tend to be more focused just on the flow and the play of the game

[01:17:51] And not on how well it incorporates the theme of the game so

[01:17:55] I mean we're really knocking him for a game

[01:18:00] I don't and and I don't want to come across as knocking him because I actually do love Steve's games and in fact

[01:18:06] Even though it's an old game black knight is still one of my absolute favorite games of all time because I learned how to play pinball on that machine and

[01:18:14] I will always

[01:18:16] You know hold that game close to my heart

[01:18:18] But but you're right on the more recent games it does seem to be more about the coding and the the flow of the game and not so much on

[01:18:26] Does the ball really feel like it's interacting with

[01:18:29] characters and aspects of the the franchise that you're talking about you know

[01:18:34] Well, I think you know, I do want to take back being a little bit too

[01:18:40] Prejudice on the title before we see it because I think Star Wars even with you know Richie at the helm

[01:18:46] I think all of Stern

[01:18:49] Is probably

[01:18:50] Lending ideas and getting excited because they got to know that this is the biggest franchise they've ever touched ever

[01:18:57] I think I think you're absolutely right. I mean

[01:19:00] I think I also think that we're we're in an era of Stern now where

[01:19:05] They're they're not afraid to to kind of throw everything in the kitchen sink into these games

[01:19:10] I don't feel like they're cutting back as much on some things as they were

[01:19:14] You know 10 years ago

[01:19:17] I think that they're pouring a whole lot more love into these games

[01:19:22] Then what you were seeing being cranked out around 2008 or 2009 so

[01:19:28] So I'm I'm not worried about what they're gonna do with this game. I because

[01:19:34] There you know they're gonna be asking to 15 grand for this game depending on the model and

[01:19:40] I do think they'll make it worth

[01:19:42] Every penny that it that it costs right now. Well Blake

[01:19:46] Saturday night
