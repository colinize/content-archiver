[00:00] We can afford to be innocent,

[00:04] Sends up an base,

[00:06] He has made it into one nice situation.

[00:11] We will be invincible.

[00:15] Sends, Sends, Sends, Sends, Sends, Sends, Sends, Sends, Sends.

[00:19] Oh, welcome to episode 316 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:23] I'm your host, Canadian.

[00:25] I'm actually calling an audible tonight.

[00:27] I was going to air an interview I did with Dr. Frightner Larry.

[00:33] And the topic is everything that he feels should be in a pinball machine that's a limited

[00:39] edition machine for $9,000 or more.

[00:43] And we go back and forth and we debate what you should get for $9,000 or more.

[00:48] But after my last show, I just didn't feel like airing that interview right now.

[00:53] I kind of wanted to do a little bit of a show that was a response to my last podcast and

[00:59] the overwhelming.

[01:01] And I mean that, the overwhelming feedback I got from so many of you out there, I can't

[01:07] read your emails because I received so many notes on both Facebook and on Gmail.

[01:13] Just saying one thing.

[01:15] I think universally people are just like, we love the show, we don't want you to go away,

[01:20] keep doing what you're doing.

[01:21] Okay?

[01:22] I'm here to tell you that that's what's going to happen.

[01:25] And I want to just put a little bit of the last show in context for you.

[01:30] Okay?

[01:31] It was three in the morning when I did that episode.

[01:33] I've been jet lagged severely after my honeymoon in Tokyo.

[01:38] And I just, I wanted to do that show.

[01:40] I heard the story about the Elvira game and I just wanted to put up a show from the

[01:47] heart.

[01:48] Something that was just been bugging me for the last few weeks is just this notion that

[01:53] we now are just laying over and allowing these pinball companies to charge such high amounts

[02:01] of money and not giving us anything.

[02:04] And that's just the thing that bugged me the most.

[02:06] It's just, it's just what bugged me the most.

[02:08] It kind of reminds me, you know, like when I was a kid and my mom and dad would give me

[02:12] money to go pick up the Chinese food and they'd be like, is there any change?

[02:16] And I'd be like, no, there's not.

[02:18] I was robbing them of their change.

[02:20] And so when you put something in front of people and say, this is $15,000 and it's a pinball

[02:25] machine and there's nothing extra in it, you know, I want the change.

[02:30] I want some change back from Stern Pinball with a game like that.

[02:34] Okay?

[02:35] But it's not just about Elvira, right?

[02:38] It's not just about one particular game that's going to 50 rich people who don't care.

[02:44] It's not, it's never been about that game.

[02:47] It's just about where the hobby is going.

[02:50] And on a macro level, on a macro level, we've all seen prices in this hobby continue to

[02:57] increase time and time again.

[03:00] And we've seen the quality of the games, the quality of the games has not gone up exponentially

[03:06] with the price increases.

[03:08] But even far more, a gregious in my mind is that the amount of money these games are

[03:14] right now.

[03:15] We're seeing far less in them.

[03:19] And to me, that's like the main thing is that we are now accepting games that look completely

[03:26] barren compared to games that were a third as much money as these new games.

[03:32] And again, it's because everything is shifting to things that can't break, things that can't,

[03:39] you know, don't need to be replaced, right?

[03:41] The emphasis is now on the screen, not what's below the glass, right?

[03:46] Universal parts used over and over again.

[03:49] Just an ultimate, I think, lack, lack of dreaming, a lack of magic.

[03:55] And I know you feel this.

[03:56] I know you feel this.

[03:57] And it's not always the easiest thing to say because also it's not always the easiest

[04:01] thing to articulate.

[04:02] Like how do you actually define someone or define for someone?

[04:07] What a lack of magic feels like, right?

[04:09] It's like, I don't, you don't really know.

[04:11] But then you jump on a circus full tear or a theater of magic and it tells you the Arabian

[04:17] nights and just from a pure pinball design and mechanisms and magic so much in the older

[04:25] games, Adam's family, Twilight Zone.

[04:28] And then you jump on a modern game and it just feels empty.

[04:34] And almost like it's like the soul of what made pinball pinball is missing a little bit

[04:41] from these modern games.

[04:42] And look, a lot has happened with departments of artwork and sound and displays.

[04:48] Absolutely.

[04:49] Absolutely.

[04:50] And yes, are these games coded much better for home use?

[04:55] Absolutely.

[04:56] And, yes, are these games coded much better for home use?

[04:57] Absolutely.

[04:58] Remember, games were never designed in the 90s to go into people's homes.

[05:02] So they didn't make the games deep.

[05:05] But I would much rather have almost all of those games from the 90s with Lyman sheets

[05:10] coding them than almost anything new today.

[05:14] And those games were like $2,500 to $3,000 but they were like jam packed.

[05:20] And that's all that I've ever wanted on this show was to say to you that I think for

[05:27] the amount of money we spend we deserve more.

[05:29] And maybe you agree?

[05:30] Maybe you don't?

[05:32] Here's the good news.

[05:33] Here's the good news.

[05:34] Here's the, here's the opera.

[05:35] Here's the, the optimist in me.

[05:38] I think the good news is this.

[05:40] The good news is everything is in our favor.

[05:43] Because if you love pinball, you can go get those amazing machines now for a pretty good

[05:49] price.

[05:50] I don't see those prices going up and up because there's so many new games, right?

[05:54] So there is a lot of great machines that you can have because all of a sudden now,

[05:58] I remember this when I bought a Tales of the Arabian Knights, right?

[06:03] All brass, plated and whatnot.

[06:05] You can get a really, really, really amazing condition game for like $7,500 to $8,000.

[06:12] Right?

[06:13] And all of a sudden now because these new machines are becoming so expensive, it's sometimes

[06:18] to me in my eyes makes those older games even more attractive to get because, you know,

[06:24] what?

[06:25] Imagine this.

[06:27] Imagine a game like Twilight Zone, right?

[06:29] How much money would Stern or Jersey Jack charge you for a modern day Twilight Zone, right?

[06:35] If they're getting $15,000 for Elvira with a piece of couch or even $10,000, right?

[06:42] What is it?

[06:43] $20,000 paying all of a sudden?

[06:45] See, I know it's hard to do that.

[06:47] And I know we talk a lot about pricing and what's in a game and pinball magic.

[06:53] But that's what I love to cover.

[06:55] All right, that's what excites me.

[06:57] That's why I get excited with each new release, right?

[07:01] A few things, right?

[07:02] Excite me and probably you with every new release.

[07:05] We're excited to see what creative ingenuity and imagination goes into each game.

[07:11] We're excited to see what the art package is like.

[07:14] Excite to see how the game shoots.

[07:16] Excite to see what the code is like.

[07:17] You know, how emotional, emotionally stirring is the code.

[07:22] Does it click, right?

[07:24] Do I find myself getting absorbed in the pinball experience?

[07:28] And I just, you know, I think some games deliver better than others.

[07:33] But I still think we're not there.

[07:37] Like, I just don't think that most of these games are worth the money.

[07:41] Now every once in a while, there's a great game.

[07:44] I'm not going to name names right now, but, you know, because it's subjective.

[07:47] And you might have found, if you get great games over the years, and I'm glad.

[07:51] I'm glad you have found those games.

[07:54] And all I think we should do as a community is just expect more.

[07:59] Except for what we're paying, the sky should be the limit on what we expect these manufacturers

[08:04] to make.

[08:05] All right.

[08:06] So something else I've just been thinking about the last few days is look.

[08:09] I mean, this show has always been sort of like we swim against the current.

[08:16] We're not here to just cheerlead everything.

[08:20] And we're not here to say we love every single manufacturer's games.

[08:23] We're not here to say we love every pinball show or every pinball personality.

[08:28] And we tell it the way I see it.

[08:31] And that rubbed some people the wrong way.

[08:33] Now what I'm going to do from now on, and this is just me moving forward, is I really

[08:38] am done sort of listening to what other podcasts say and then using it or reacting to it in

[08:44] a way like I did in my last show.

[08:46] All right.

[08:47] There's a lot of pinball personalities out there.

[08:50] All right.

[08:51] I think people are my friends and then they're saying stuff, you know, making fun of me,

[08:55] what not.

[08:56] I'm never really sure where friendships lie in the world of pinball podcasting.

[09:01] But I think I have a really good grasp on who is truly a friend and who's not.

[09:07] And it's okay to be competitive.

[09:10] It's okay for all of us to jab at each other.

[09:13] But moving forward, I'm just going to do my show the way I want to do it.

[09:18] And it's going to never change.

[09:19] It's going to be the format that you've always had.

[09:22] You've always enjoyed.

[09:24] And maybe I'll have some new segments here and there, but that's never been my thing.

[09:27] My thing has always been just talking to you without any filters, without any care about

[09:34] what anyone at any company thinks.

[09:37] And I just give it to you raw.

[09:39] And if I hear rumors and speculation, I don't really filter them.

[09:42] I just give it to you.

[09:44] And sometimes we're right.

[09:45] Sometimes we're wrong.

[09:47] And I don't really care to hold back because I do think that there's just way too much,

[09:55] way too much holding back in this hobby about how people really feel.

[09:59] And I think you're in a better place with people when you just give it to me.

[10:03] Tell me how you feel.

[10:04] Don't dance around it.

[10:05] Don't circle around the topic.

[10:07] Just tell me.

[10:08] What's up?

[10:09] And this show has always had an open door policy.

[10:11] I will talk to anyone and everyone who wants to come on and debate with me or talk to me

[10:18] about pinball.

[10:19] Okay?

[10:20] And it's always going to be that way.

[10:21] And I love doing interviews.

[10:22] And I'll do my best to get the best interviews possible for you.

[10:26] And you know, if you listen to this show, you're not going to get probably George Gomez

[10:30] on anytime soon.

[10:31] I don't think Jersey Jack is going to be at my door wanting to come back on the show

[10:35] anytime soon.

[10:36] And I don't care.

[10:38] And I'll tell you why I don't care.

[10:39] It's not because I don't respect those men.

[10:41] I respect those men tremendously.

[10:44] But if it comes between me telling you that you should stop buying games until they give

[10:51] you a play field solution, and that's going to piss off Jack and George or anyone else

[10:57] who has to then go give people free play fields.

[11:01] I don't care.

[11:02] I'd rather get you your free play fields.

[11:05] And don't for a minute think they would have acted as quickly as they did if this show

[11:11] wasn't telling you to stop buying new inbox games.

[11:14] If you think we have no influence, I think you're wrong.

[11:17] I think we have we have a direct influence on things like that.

[11:21] And we can keep a topic like the clear code issue front and center to even to the chagrin

[11:29] of the manufacturers.

[11:31] And I don't care.

[11:32] So speaking of that, let's go into little news and rumors and speculation.

[11:35] So speaking of that, did you see the latest that Stern is no longer going to give people

[11:41] play fields that are populated as a solution to a play field issue?

[11:46] Now I don't know if this is confirmed or not.

[11:49] The problem with this whole topic is it never has any closure because we've never received

[11:55] any official language from any of the manufacturers.

[12:00] We have not been told straight up.

[12:03] Here's what the solution is.

[12:05] And here's what we're going to do for the customers who have defective play fields.

[12:09] And I don't know what the answer is because if you start sending people fully populated

[12:16] play fields, you're going to get just so many people with a plethora of what they'll

[12:24] consider to be defective things wanting a whole new game.

[12:28] And you can't afford to do that.

[12:30] Everyone would go out of business if every time there was wear and tear in a pinball play

[12:34] field, someone wanted a whole new one.

[12:37] That being said, we're not talking about like games that have been on route for years.

[12:42] We're talking about stuff that was, you know, the box was recently open and stuff's

[12:46] chipping off the play field.

[12:47] Okay.

[12:48] Now here's a thing too.

[12:50] I still think they're figuring it out.

[12:52] I've heard recently from someone who just saw a Jurassic Park that the clear code is much

[12:57] thinner.

[12:58] Here's what I was told that the clear coding process that they do has three different times

[13:06] the play field is sprayed with clear code.

[13:09] All right.

[13:10] Now the problem is to keep up with demand and to make the play fields fast enough because

[13:16] of all of the orders and games going on in the pinball world, they're not allowing

[13:21] enough time for that clear code to cure before they apply the next code.

[13:27] Now if that first code doesn't cure and you put the second code on, you got big problems

[13:33] because that bottom code is never going to cure properly.

[13:36] Now, the solution what I'm hearing is instead of three codes, they're going to start cutting

[13:42] down to two codes.

[13:44] If you only need two codes, you can let the first code cure and then you can put the

[13:48] second one on in the same amount of time.

[13:50] It would take you to do the three codes, but the three codes might be defective.

[13:56] So that's who knows though.

[13:58] I say this stuff and until I just think you're going to have to, you know, buy or be wear

[14:03] on pinball machines, but I do think you're going to see less clear but less chipping if

[14:09] they go to the two-code method.

[14:11] All right.

[14:12] All right.

[14:14] Anyway, I just want to say like I'd rather give you that news than get interviews from

[14:19] people and I'd rather, you know, stick it to the manufacturers until you get a resolution

[14:25] than be their buddies.

[14:26] Okay.

[14:27] Because I got enough friends in the real world.

[14:28] I'm not like calling up these pinball manufacturers to like make it through a day.

[14:33] All right.

[14:34] I don't need them.

[14:35] I got enough of you guys that are friends and I got enough real friends and co-workers

[14:37] and family and all that jazz and Bubba of course and my beautiful wife Brenda.

[14:42] All right.

[14:43] So deep root one week away.

[14:46] Seven days from now we are going to see what deep root has been working on.

[14:51] Now what do you feel about this whole like?

[14:53] I don't know.

[14:54] There's like terms and conditions of the game they're going to show us.

[14:57] It's not the final game.

[15:00] It will be a playable game.

[15:02] It will have some sort of art package on it but it's not the final product.

[15:08] Here is what I think is going to happen.

[15:11] Now I think Robert is smart and sandbagging us at the same time.

[15:18] What I mean by that and I mean look it was not smart for them to say they were going to

[15:22] do all this stuff in 2019.

[15:24] What I mean is he's smart enough not to put something out there that is going to under

[15:30] well but he also knows that you can lower expectations at this stage and then when you

[15:39] reveal the final product below people away and I think he's sandbagging us a little bit.

[15:44] I do.

[15:45] I think he knows what the final thing is and I think he's going to play some games with

[15:51] the community.

[15:52] I do.

[15:53] And look I don't know this for effect.

[15:55] Robert if you're listening this is not me spewing BS.

[15:57] This is just me kind of feeling like I think these guys are you know I think they know

[16:05] what they're doing.

[16:07] And I do think they're trolling a little bit.

[16:10] I know Ken Cromwell trolling.

[16:12] It's like he hates it.

[16:13] I mean come on the whole internet.

[16:14] It's full of trolls.

[16:15] You'll never you'll never you'll never beat them back.

[16:19] But then you know the question then becomes this we see it in November and then when is

[16:23] it coming out right start start to count the months on your fingers December January,

[16:30] February, March.

[16:31] So in four months we've got T.P.F.

[16:33] Even from there you got you know April, May, June.

[16:36] I mean this could be another six to eight months before a single game is on a production

[16:42] line at deep root and what is a production line even look like how many games are there

[16:46] going to be there's still a ton of questions.

[16:49] There's still a ton of mystery.

[16:51] You know mystery and curiosity is the most valuable thing they have.

[16:56] So it is interesting where some of that some of the answers will occur in a week.

[17:01] And I'm just excited to see it because I'm so tired of wondering what all of those people

[17:06] are doing down there in Texas.

[17:08] But you know I hope it's special.

[17:09] But I still think they're sandbagging us a little bit.

[17:11] All right.

[17:12] Another bit of news.

[17:14] So you might remember earlier in the year if you pull up interviews with Mr. Jersey

[17:18] Jack Pimball you know favorite fan of Canadian Pimball podcast.

[17:22] He said to us and I'm going to you know I can find the clip if you want me to that we

[17:27] will see two new Jersey Jack games on the line in 2019 or maybe not on the line but revealed.

[17:36] Okay.

[17:37] Let's give him let's let's go back and say two new titles will be revealed by Jersey

[17:42] Jack Pimball in 2019.

[17:45] And one of them was not yellow brick road and so we have Willie Wonka and the worst kept

[17:51] secret guns and roses now.

[17:53] I'm here to tell you right now official unofficial official Jersey Jack Pimball will not

[17:59] be showing guns and roses any time in 2019.

[18:02] In fact, I am hearing now that it is pushed back into 2020.

[18:08] I would expect T.P.F. to be the time period in which we see guns and roses.

[18:15] Now that makes sense because if you think about it, we saw Willie Wonka in April of

[18:22] 2018 and Jack shipped Willie Wonka's within two months.

[18:26] Now he knows that the window between reveal and shipping has to be a very short window

[18:33] anything can get it even shorter the better right Stern does it even faster than Jack does

[18:37] it Stern does it and it the game's already on the line when Stern reveals it.

[18:42] It's not even a question of you know here it is like let's let's let's take some pre-orders

[18:47] let's do some collectors edition pre-ordering.

[18:50] No, Stern's like here's the game it's on the line by today you know fear of missing

[18:55] out you know is their best marketing strategy.

[18:58] So I don't think we're going to see guns and roses until like March.

[19:01] I also think it kind of makes sense because Jack's had delays.

[19:06] Jack has had delays because of the play field issues.

[19:09] Jack has lost orders because of the play field issues.

[19:13] Collectors editions of Willie Wonka were supposed to be on the line a couple months ago.

[19:18] They are just getting on the line now and if you're Jack you want to sell all 500 of

[19:24] those collectors editions and you want to keep selling Willie Wonka at least for another

[19:29] few months at least why would you show guns and roses now when you just you know are

[19:35] you know in full steam with Willie Wonka production.

[19:39] Okay all right so that's it no guns and roses until next year and I also you know hopefully

[19:45] you know Jack can have a secret title because if it's just guns and roses and then toy

[19:49] story they've really been working on nothing in secret they must be they must be all right

[19:55] what else is going on in the pinball world.

[19:57] Oh what else is going on you know someone always said that's your trademark line what

[20:01] else is going on in the pinball world and I'm trying to think about what else is going

[20:04] on in the pinball world.

[20:05] Chicago gaming company they are going to be shipping monster bash not monster bash medieval

[20:11] madness remakes in December we still don't know the total number of those royal editions.

[20:19] Now I the more I think about this I just I just still don't like this ambiguous number

[20:25] because here's why here's why it like how do you trust that they're only making 500 or

[20:33] 550 or whatever it is if you're not numbering stuff then there's no way to measure the

[20:40] amount you make and they know better than anybody that collectors want that so I just

[20:47] have a problem with these like ambiguous collector non collector editions that just leave

[20:52] everybody scratching their head to as to how many they actually made I hope they come

[20:57] out eventually and say okay we took orders on all 500 and here's how it breaks down

[21:04] there's this many you know standard editions this many classic editions and this many

[21:09] or whatever special editions and this many royal editions just tell us like why can't

[21:15] we just hear how many of each are being made all right IAPA is this week IAPA the big

[21:21] you know out you know vending machines sort of coin op trade show down in Florida American

[21:26] pinball will be there Chicago gaming company will be there stern will be there Jersey Jack

[21:31] will be there what will American pinball bring to the show will it be a game after October

[21:37] fest no I don't I've never seen anyone use IAPA as a platform to launch a pinball machine

[21:45] has anyone ever done it there it just doesn't seem like the right show it just seems like

[21:50] it's a humongous trade show but not really the right environment if you want to target

[21:57] a pinball buyers I think American pinball might bring their redemption machine to that

[22:02] show which would be interesting to see what these guys are working on but still game three

[22:08] must be close game three must be close but you know that you know what always always interesting

[22:13] in this hobby is and I've said this before is I don't think you need a trade show to launch

[22:16] a game but the problem now is everyone sort of spaces out their reveals around these

[22:23] shows and so once expose over it's almost like well there's nothing else we can do we got

[22:29] a way to tpf but that's not true because we know stern is going to show their cornerstone

[22:35] title from Brian Eddie most likely sometime in December or January and they're not they're not

[22:41] they don't wait for shows stern never waits for the shows they actually they usually time their

[22:46] stuff around the shows but never at the shows themselves I kind of think that's smart they sort

[22:54] of can see everyone else's hand and then they can you know move accordingly sometimes it's

[23:00] better to hold back versus just do what's expected in in the world of marketing all right so yeah

[23:07] we'll see what game number three is from those guys p3 multi more thick I I don't know I don't

[23:14] know I don't know is running news anything happen in there trying to go down the list of Dutch pinball

[23:20] you know I haven't seen any unboxings any of of of the new game that Barry's been putting together

[23:27] so until I see that until we see some actual production happening I don't know how you you change

[23:36] your opinion about what's going on over there all right anything else going on the pinball world

[23:41] no we're like a week away from the big news so here's what's going to happen I'm going to air the

[23:46] interview with Larry this week where we talk about the most important things that should be in the

[23:52] limited edition games okay now look we're spending a lot of money and I think we deserve to get a

[23:57] little bit more than we're getting right now I hope you agree I think you agree I think it's a good

[24:03] time I do I mean I've always said this it's like I don't know how you all feel but I do think it's

[24:10] like such a good time to just sit back and wait and see what happens you're not going to miss out

[24:16] on a Willy Wonka collector's edition they're going to be around for a really long time I would sit

[24:21] back and wait and see what is Brian Eddie's new game from Stern I would sit back and wait and see

[24:26] how the code develops from out for Alvira I would sit back and wait to see you know what Chicago

[24:33] gaming company does after medieval madness remake because I think it's going to be cactus canyon

[24:39] I heard that package is spectacular I would sit back and see what's coming from deep route maybe you

[24:45] know I think that was a good time to do like I would do like a six month just wait and see

[24:50] because think about it what game what game would you miss out on if you just sat back and wait it

[24:57] and I know this is like the number one thing manufacturers don't want you to do it's why they don't

[25:02] like this show because I'm like stop think stop think pause a minute wait they didn't put anything

[25:08] in that for five thousand dollars more how could you buy it that's a suckers move like they don't

[25:12] want you to hear that they wanted to hear bye bye bye that's what they want they want you to stop

[25:17] thinking about this stuff they want you to not analyze these things it's a thorn in Stern's side

[25:24] in Jersey jack's side when twenty five hundred people are listening to a dude with a two hundred

[25:29] dollar headset tell them to just wait see what comes out you don't know if it's going to be something

[25:36] you'd rather have than what you're buying right now and here's the thing that is really happening

[25:42] that the sale of games now is freezing it is taking a lot longer to move games I mean it is it

[25:50] is happening everywhere and so why not just wait and see the things that I'm waiting for I really

[25:58] want to see if Brian Eddie's machine is some throwback 80s nostalgic thing I want to see if

[26:03] Scott Denise's next game is a really cool 80s throwback theme I know I'm going to see both of

[26:09] those games in the next six months okay I also want to see like what Ninja Turtles from Zambi Eddie

[26:15] and John Borg is like because I keep hearing this things got like a ramps going or you know

[26:20] habitraels going above and below the play field I mean I think there's like a sewer system in the

[26:24] game there's internet connectivity I can't wait to see what that thing is turtle power maybe

[26:29] it's internet connected maybe there's four player co-op play just like the old turtle power

[26:34] and I turned on teenage vintage turtles arcade game but I just there's like nothing like right now I

[26:40] got to own this I got to own this pinball machine I mean you can still go get a Jurassic Park

[26:44] Ellie right now you can still go get here's a crazy part you can still go get in L. Vira Ellie

[26:52] there are a few of them for sale new in box for 9500 bucks and what does that tell you right

[26:57] sold out sold out sold out well sort of right there's always that caveat you know a lot of

[27:04] distributors not all of them and I'm going to say something after this to to my friend Melissa

[27:09] over at coin taker a lot of distributors just hold on this stuff they they'll keep a few games

[27:14] in box and just wait to see what happens okay no net because because like you know you might have

[27:19] a great customer who didn't move on it initially and then you know maybe a few weeks later you can

[27:23] say hey actually I want you want one boom happy customer right all right but I want to clarify

[27:29] on my last podcast when I said that all distributors have their sales tactic of like I've got one more

[27:35] left and then they like sell it then they they go down to the next person I got one more left

[27:39] I just want to clarify that after that podcast only one distributor reached out to me and said Chris

[27:46] what are you talking about we don't do that we're completely fair with our customers we don't play

[27:51] those kinds of games and that was Melissa at coin taker and she is right Chris and Melissa are

[27:57] amazing you know I love them they know I love them they didn't play any games or shenanigans with

[28:03] a big Lebowski even though people were waving extra money in front of them to get one they didn't

[28:08] take any of it they are class acts and I want to say Melissa because you reached out to me I will

[28:15] clarify on air that you don't use that sales tactic but others do my favorite though is not even

[28:22] the ones who like are like I got one more my favorite was the distributor and if he'll let me

[28:27] say his name on air I will the distributor who spent basically 20 minutes trying to talk me out

[28:34] of buying an Elvira signature edition because he just thought it was the biggest ripoff he'll

[28:39] never reveal himself to the world because you know he's a pretty big big shot and we know within

[28:44] the stern distribution world he's like oh god damn Chris you just out at me no that's you could

[28:49] probably guess on if you guess distributors on one hand all right so you know look look it's a

[28:56] good time to be in pinball I know I sound it to flayed it I know I sound it like depressed I know

[29:01] I know it's not what you tune into here you want to hear entertaining Chris um sometimes at three

[29:08] in the morning it's not as high energy but I'm not going anywhere I don't plan on going anywhere

[29:14] what would you do if I went away where like I get it there's a lot of shows out there but come on

[29:20] nobody can just nobody's just giving it to you like this they can't they can't they have to think

[29:25] about the consequences of all the things they say and like the domino effect of of how that could like

[29:31] you know come back to haunt them or you know eliminate their interviews or this or that and I

[29:37] look I know that when I talk to so many people out there that we're hitting on something on this

[29:43] show right we're we're we're landing somewhere that a lot of people agree with because if we did

[29:49] in who would listen right and so I just want to say I think it's a great time to be in pinball I think

[29:54] if you're a buyer of pinball you should demand a lot more from these games but you're in the driver's

[30:00] seat and the greatest way to be in control while you're in that driver's seat is simply to not buy

[30:09] until you see something that is amazing but even better here's your even better advice the best

[30:16] way to be in control and be in the driver's seat is not buy a game until you actually play it

[30:24] multiple times and love it because if you simply exercise that behavior so much of the BS that

[30:35] takes place in this hobby and and the new inbox frenzied world so much of what Stern banks on

[30:42] every new release where people are buying games incomplete before they play them before they

[30:49] know what the quality is before they know if there's any mechanical issues they've already sold

[30:53] every single one of the high end versions of the game if you would simply exercise some patience

[31:01] you'd get better products you would force these companies to give you more but as long as you run

[31:07] in and show them it doesn't matter what they do you're buying then you're going to get subpar

[31:14] products you're going to get less innovation you're going to get fewer mechanisms you're going to

[31:21] get just more artwork and more LCD screen stuff but much less pinball magic under the glass

[31:29] so if I could ask a favor of everybody out there it would be to simply start to think about

[31:36] how you behave in this hobby right like how many hours do you spend on pinside how frenetic are you

[31:44] when it comes to thinking about pinball and how badly do you need a new game right now and I love

[31:51] collectors because so many of them who have so many games they barely even turn them on and you

[31:58] know who I'm talking about you know it's fun when guys come over your friends come over you crack

[32:03] open some beers but that's like that's not that often maybe it's once a week for some of you guys

[32:09] but just exercise some patience and just demand more and if companies come out with stuff

[32:14] that seems like a total colossal ripoff it's okay to say that and if you don't want to say it

[32:20] just email me a canada pinball edgmail.com and I'll happily say it for you now on the other side

[32:27] if you see something amazing if you see something incredible if you see a designer actually taking

[32:33] risks and taking pinball into new directions then by all means people let's support those people

[32:40] that are pushing pinball forward you know there's a reason why I fully want to support people like

[32:47] Eric with Pirates of the Caribbean I can't buy that game simply because of just like all the

[32:53] mechanical issues I don't want to be fixing a game all day long but that guy's trying to push

[32:57] the envelope of pinball that's the kind of person you should get behind Scott Denise's the kind of

[33:02] person you should get behind he you know he he he showed us you know out of nowhere comes with a

[33:09] game that's one level that's just a blast to play has one of the best sounds systems and like

[33:15] one of the best like music in any pinball ever and it's just like a super fast fun game and that

[33:21] pinball can be fun without a ton of stuff because he he designed it to be an experience I don't get

[33:29] the feeling like someone walked around his game like I don't get the feeling Gary stern walked

[33:33] around his game and he yanked out everything that he really wanted in the game which we know happens

[33:38] to almost every stern pinball machine okay look at Keith L. Win right why can Keith L. Win design

[33:46] stern games but make them feel fresh make them feel like there's more in them because Keith

[33:51] L. Win is like a new designer in this hobby who's not like been around for 30 years and just

[33:58] doing the same old tricks he's trying to make a name for himself and he's trying to build a library

[34:04] of games that when he's done people are going to say he's one of the best pinball designers ever

[34:09] and he's on his way to proving that I think he's going to win the Twippy for best pinball machine

[34:12] again this year two years in a row back to back Keith L. Win games hitting home runs right and I

[34:19] hope that drives like the John Borgs and the Steve Richies and everyone else out there the Joe

[34:24] Balsers to up their game because look at what's look at what's resonating with people and we should

[34:30] support the people that are pushing pinball forward and I'm going to say it I'm going to say this is

[34:34] not popular this is not going to be popular but like Pat Lawler one of the greatest pinball

[34:39] designers of all time I think his his games shoot so well but I want to see more in the mechanism

[34:45] department from Pat Lawler I think Willie Wonka shoots so well but if you ask me I don't think

[34:50] there's that much creativity in the mechanism department in that game I don't and I don't know if

[34:55] it's because he was told to simplify it but I saw way more in dialed in and it looks like he dialed

[35:00] it back for Willie Wonka and his his real his real like his real telltale sign game is going to be

[35:07] toy story like is it going to be dialed it back up because it's a theme everyone loves or is it

[35:12] going to be simpler like like Wonka right safety with Eric well pie well can he follow up pirates

[35:18] under the new Jersey Jacks sort of approach which is to make games more reliable and a little bit

[35:25] like more operator friendly is that is that going to inspire him to go above and beyond the way he

[35:30] did with pirates okay and then Chicago gaming I can't wait to see what their original game is the

[35:36] remakes are awesome but you know I always want to see what's next not not just a rehash of what's

[35:40] before all right everybody this has been episode 300 no 300 look look at me I'm like I forgot an

[35:48] entire hundred episodes episode 400 and 16 of Canada's pinball podcasts again thank all of you

[35:57] who wrote me thank you to everyone who listens to this show even if you hate me even if you can't

[36:02] stand me I hope you find me somewhat entertaining I hope I at least make your week a little bit more

[36:08] enriched with some entertaining pinball content I'm always open to you know talking to any of you

[36:16] about your thoughts on pinball just email me at canada pinball at gmail.com and again we're not going

[36:22] anywhere there's going to be highs and lows there's going to be ups and downs this show you know

[36:26] sometimes I just feel like I'm just human like there's going to be days on bummed out and I do a

[36:31] show and that comes across there's going to be days on hyper and I do a pin-side babies episode

[36:35] and I'm screaming like a lunatic but for the most part I just hope you know that I do care about

[36:41] pinball a lot I love it and I just want you to get the most magic in pinball as you possibly

[36:46] can for these prices and trust yourself trust your gut you're the only one who can actually decide

[36:55] on whether or not the game is for you don't listen to the hype don't listen to everyone else

[36:59] and just know one thing any game you really want to get it will always be available months after

[37:07] its release some and years after its released there is no such thing as you won't be able to get

[37:13] the game trust me on that can either out later
