[00:00] These two bulls are sitting on a grassy knoll overlooking a herded gurntes and the baby bulls says hey pop

[00:06] Let's run down and

[00:08] Fuck one of those cows, but the poppables says no son

[00:13] Let's walk down

[00:15] Fuck them all

[00:18] Welcome to episode 38 of Canada's pinball podcast. I'm canada your friendly host coming at you from New York City

[00:31] The only man on the planet who knows how to replicate the white water topper. It's true

[00:36] I have the information how to do it. I can make them perfect all day long

[00:41] But I've just decided to take that information with me to the grave so you guys don't get it

[00:46] On this episode of Canada's pinball podcast. I'm going to interview

[00:50] pin-side member

[00:52] Red eyes and we're just gonna talk pinball

[00:55] You know part of what I always want to do with this podcast is just talk to some of the members of the community and

[01:01] Just find out sort of a little bit about them talk about what's going on in the pinball world

[01:05] And get their opinion and share it with you

[01:08] I mean it's really just a platform for people to come on and share how they think about pinball and why they love pinball and

[01:14] And where they find themselves currently

[01:16] What I found interesting about red eyes conversation is he was someone who I

[01:21] Think a lot of collectors can relate to he was buying a lot of stuff new in box

[01:25] And he was sort of collecting right around when Tron Ellie blew up and everyone sort of was in a frenzy to collect and buy

[01:33] The next stern Ellie's because people saw the spike occurring and I think like a lot of people he seems to have

[01:40] God and in

[01:41] At the point worth it just got a little saturated and it's it's interesting because I think we find ourselves in another period of time

[01:49] Where is Ghostbusters Ellie the new Tron Ellie?

[01:53] And I know there's not unique modes, but it's definitely more than people are paying sticker for it right now

[01:59] And are people gonna see prices stay that high and increase or are we gonna see an oversaturation in the market?

[02:06] Personally, I think the market's gonna get oversaturated soon and every pinball price is gonna go down, but we're gonna talk about that

[02:14] What else I want to talk I just want to call from on one thing that's just funny

[02:19] Some of these threads are just derailing left and right of like the alien thread

[02:23] It just became a thread about a viral now. It's just everyone bickering back and forth. I do think they should maybe just

[02:30] Lock that thread until August because it was not gonna be any updates until Andrew comes back and

[02:37] Show something for people to react to that has to do with the game and that looks like it's not gonna happen until August

[02:42] So might be good for the mod team to lock that thread out. I also found another thread funny where

[02:49] We see this a lot with sellers where someone was selling in America's most honoured and

[02:55] I want to ask everyone out there who who sells a pin to just do one thing

[03:01] Just just sell it with one story did do people people always do whenever they say I'm selling this pinball machine

[03:09] Because another personal opportunity came about and so you know the the indication there is that they need to free up some capital

[03:17] And that's why they're selling the pin, but dead

[03:20] It's always it always just cracks me up when people a few posts down also indicate that they're willing to trade the pin for

[03:27] I'm willing to trade this for Metallica or Star Trek or something else

[03:32] Clearly you're lying about why you're selling it. I wish people would just be honest

[03:37] We're seeing a lot of new pins for sale lately a lot of new ones and we're seeing ones that are the higher price pins a lot of

[03:44] ACDC premiums were seeing Tron alleys go up for sale big bang bars

[03:49] My theory and it I think it's gonna hold true. You're gonna see a lot of people

[03:53] Trying to free up these high ticket items because I think people see the shift is coming

[03:58] I think they see the saturation is coming and now it's gonna be the time if you are in this hobby

[04:05] And you're in and in a way where you're investing in games to one day flip

[04:09] I think you're gonna see a lot of flipping happening soon

[04:11] But again, we'll see the market will decide that it's not gonna be canada

[04:15] So without further ado, I want to air this interview with with Ryan

[04:20] And I also I want to invite you guys who listen to the show if you have a big collection and you're a collector

[04:25] I'd just love to hear what your thoughts are on what's gonna happen in 2016

[04:30] I'd love to hear about your collection and I'd love to just talk about the stuff that's popping in the community

[04:35] So if you want to come on the show

[04:37] And don't worry. It's easy to talk to canada and I will make it I will make it so everyone sounds good with with my editing techniques

[04:46] But just hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com and let's talk pinball and we can talk about anything you want

[04:53] Other than that here's Ryan Ellis from Lancaster PA

[04:58] All right ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce the canada's pinball podcast Ryan Ellis from Lancaster PA Ryan welcome to the show

[05:07] Thanks for having me and just for the record I know Ted so if that helps get me in anywhere

[05:13] Right get past certain security that you have hyping up now lately

[05:19] for

[05:21] That's it the only people who can join this show have to somehow know Ted or else they're they're not allowed on the podcast

[05:27] but

[05:27] Ryan Ryan actually reached out to me and you know, I know a lot of you out there

[05:32] You you enjoy the interview so my goal when I first started this podcast was to talk to people

[05:37] Who are just in the hobby talk about their collections talk about what their thoughts are with what's going on in the pinball

[05:43] Community and in the world so Ryan thank you for joining this show so people don't have to just hear me

[05:48] rant and rave about pinside users

[05:51] Well, it sounds like that's that's what they love though the drama of canada

[05:57] and I don't I don't know that I can trump that tonight

[06:00] I'll try to

[06:01] Interject a little bit what I can and thanks for having me. Yeah, no worries

[06:05] So you've been in the pinball for how long like this is something you've been in your whole life

[06:09] Or is this something that you like adopted later on in life? How long have you been a fan?

[06:14] so

[06:15] I guess maybe middle school wish

[06:18] My friends dad had new in the box fun house of course

[06:24] I don't think anybody know what that meant if you're in middle school you're chasing after girls

[06:29] What you know whatever getting you know smoking your first joint and

[06:33] He got a new in a box fun house. It was great on the opposite end of the spectrum

[06:39] I was introduced to a spacing majors which is like I don't know what is it early 80s maybe late 70s

[06:47] Right 81 80 year on there. Okay, sure. So I was introduced to that too

[06:53] By one of my dad's friends who I had this big-ass basement, you know, and just had one of the pinball machines in their

[06:59] Basement I guess I guess middle school wish till the time I could save up enough

[07:04] I guess I would say after college I spent on money on booze and

[07:10] Right so maybe you know 24 25 I've got my first pinball machine

[07:18] And which one was that was that like it you get something you in box or do you get something?

[07:21] No, it was it was a cue ball wizard a local newspaper had had a

[07:28] An ad for this guy selling it for it was like 450 bucks cue ball wasn't

[07:34] Wow

[07:35] That's not about knowing nothing even to have the open the coin door, but

[07:40] sold it flipped it for like a thousand bucks and

[07:43] Right then I was hooked

[07:46] Just yeah, that's cheaper than a top or now for for a game of thrones, but

[07:52] All right, so you started there and so what's in your collection right now?

[07:57] Because I want to talk about what you have and then talk about like what what you're excited about with what's coming out in the pipeline

[08:02] This year in pinball

[08:04] When I've really started to get into pinball it's after I get into the club and just seeing what other people had

[08:10] Just made me you know enthusiastic about building my collection

[08:15] First you know my first couple pinballs were

[08:20] Games that I kind of just flipped because I really didn't theater magic Indiana Jones

[08:26] Like the old school version like I just didn't really

[08:30] Know enough about it to like because when you're investing like in your early late to 20s

[08:36] You're investing like $3,000 in something you want to see it, you know produce

[08:42] You know and in in in back then I looked at it like an investment as time

[08:48] What do you mean by produce so you buy it and then produce what fun or money or what?

[08:53] Both both right whatever it's gonna it and if it doesn't produce enough fun for you

[08:58] You're gonna want to flip it for money like you're gonna want to hope it produces something else right and not just

[09:05] You lugging something up a huge staircase and just you know and wasting your time

[09:11] Or efforts into something so I looked at it like it was all those things and it was what I could make of it after that

[09:19] I saw it more like

[09:22] Okay, I'm I'm sound in my job. I'm sound in you know

[09:26] I don't have kids in a big family. So I'm looking at it more like

[09:29] I'm I want to start to build a collection and that's what I want to coin taker and

[09:35] He's a local guy in Pennsylvania

[09:38] Him and Melissa chris and Melissa are awesome to deal with and I started to get new in the box

[09:45] First new in the box was hawk

[09:48] I'm green like what everyone's favorite color everyone's favorite color green

[09:53] Right, so that was my first new in the box now that you did you do you have you do you play your pins before you buy them or you

[10:01] Just going off of like theme no no no not then you know

[10:06] You're just buying new in the box every new in the box that comes around back then it was kind of like the speculation of that was like the

[10:13] Transformers days the

[10:15] Hawk days the Tron LED days right okay, so that those right after Tron though right like Avengers and Hulk

[10:23] That's like right after it is everyone's chasing the next LED. It's all after the like the huge spike like they saw what Tron did

[10:32] So they thought everybody thought including myself that pins would just like you know skyrocket

[10:38] You know after you bought them like every new in the box would be like a home run

[10:42] Like to me like half the fun is working on it and it is playing it but

[10:49] In at that time it was like kind of just you know you're investing as well and I think a lot of people like

[10:57] Took that into where we are now and was like

[11:01] I think the lot of their false hopes were the fact that

[11:05] They looked at it as an investment and that's wrong and that's where I went wrong too

[11:09] Right so you must you must so people took a hit on Avengers because I hear from a lot of collectors

[11:16] After Tron a lot of people went in on Avengers. It seemed like a sure thing right Gomez designed it

[11:23] The theme was popular in the movies

[11:25] Um

[11:27] Pin came out and like was underwhelming right and so people I think sort of

[11:32] Realized that you're not just gonna get like one to one or one one to two on pinball like you could actually

[11:38] lose a few thousand dollars

[11:41] You know pretty quickly the lesson is that pinball normally is not a good is not should not be looked at as an investment

[11:47] Yeah, yeah and in a couple years ago

[11:51] It's funny because it's it's funny because a couple of years ago. It kind of was like

[11:56] example I

[11:58] Was fortunate enough to get a hold of a homie so many medieval madness back when you could sell a homie so many medieval madness for like

[12:07] 15 grand right but now it might only be worth like maybe nine ten grand

[12:13] Consider you can get a new in the box for eight

[12:16] To go back to your original question and you know what I got now I have done a

[12:21] My parents placed in Virginia. I have a medieval madness the homie's only one an iron man

[12:27] I got from coin taker and up here. I have my restored black night

[12:32] 2000 so at Alan town I just sold a homie's only judge dread and a Johnny, New Monk, okay, and

[12:41] You know, I'm not and that's only because I'm living in apartment now and I can't it doesn't

[12:49] You know bold well to creating a collection when I see these guys collections like in basements and everybody expanding their collection and just like

[12:58] there's a right time for pinball to

[13:01] To get it to where you want to be I had I guess eight machines at one time

[13:07] But now I got three so there's a right time where you can I think you said it one your earlier podcasts

[13:15] You know, it's you know, it's a toy. It's it's something that it comes after everything else after you know health after

[13:23] All this other stuff that we have for granted life and when you're in the right stable position in life to be able to

[13:31] invest and

[13:33] In a pinball collection then by all means do it right right now definitely and I think you know

[13:40] I'm in a similar boat when you're in an apartment

[13:43] We obviously look at some of the people's space with a little bit of envy because we obviously can't

[13:49] put four five ten fifteen machines in which I actually am kind of thankful because I think I would buy more

[13:56] Just because there is a there is like an in a habitual addiction to just buying the latest and the greatest and the newest pinball machine

[14:04] Right you see it on the forums like I think some guys and I won't name names because I always get in trouble when I do

[14:11] But some guys just want then they just want to open up a new and box pinball machine every three to four months

[14:16] Right and they're just it doesn't matter what the theme is it doesn't matter

[14:20] If you know, I just met a guy rodeo Dave from

[14:24] Why so New Zealand he's got like he's got like 150 pinball machines in his home

[14:30] That guy's awesome. He came to your apartment and hung out. Yeah

[14:34] Wow, that's awesome right and it's but it's like a point where like you can't even enjoy

[14:40] You know for some of these collectors when they're a collection to get so big and then it becomes it becomes the point of like the

[14:46] Collection takes over your life and I that's what I never wanted to I never want that to happen in any hobby

[14:51] I get into like I I collect a transformer toys years ago and I realize like I'm never gonna have all the auto bots

[14:57] Because it'd be like a half a million dollars to complete that. It's like I don't want to be that guy

[15:04] But so let's talk about like you know, let's talk about pinball as an investment though because I actually

[15:09] I brought up this topic on on the last podcast because

[15:13] Ryan when you're talking about flipping a game right away for some money or buying a game and flipping it on

[15:19] What do you think I should do so I have a Ghostbusters?

[15:21] Ellie I

[15:23] Ordered it from tilt emusments all I had to do is give him a hundred dollars like PayPal just to get an Ellie

[15:29] This is this is when people were still sort of speculating if Ghostbusters was gonna be the next pin

[15:33] I think all in with the positive is around like eight grand

[15:38] Someone has offered me $10,000 just to buy it like I haven't even I don't even have it. It's not even made yet, but

[15:47] See that's what that's exactly what I was saying like like two years ago that was like the Tron sparked

[15:55] Like a lot of that right and Ghostbusters is the like just what everybody wanted and

[16:02] And

[16:04] Like to make it simple for you

[16:06] You you did good

[16:09] You got in on it. I would stay in on it if it sounds good to you

[16:14] You flick it to somebody that you know

[16:19] You make out on it like

[16:21] There's no way that there's always gonna be somebody that's hungry or for something and

[16:27] For you to make a profit on that or to get it on it earlier

[16:32] It's in for see that it's just like you know

[16:36] Like I'm looking at the Toronto Cleveland game tonight like the people that got in on like the spread earlier and put their bets down

[16:46] Cleveland giving up ten points right now

[16:49] They're doing good

[16:51] And there's no reason they should be because they they forked up the early money to

[16:56] Be able to make that happen and they had the fruition to make it happen

[17:00] Well, I think I the way I looked at Ghostbusters

[17:02] And we we've seen people over the last couple of years just get absolutely burned on pre-orders, right?

[17:08] I mean people people went in on all of Papa Duke's games

[17:13] Sully solely, you know, they'll say it's all because they loved his designs and his pinball machines

[17:18] But all those guys who were buying Magic Girl for sixteen thousand dollars in the back of their head

[17:23] We're like this thing's gonna be worth thirty grand the second I get it if he only makes sixteen of them right there was like this

[17:29] No lose situation if I go in on this and

[17:32] Those guys ended up with Enron stock like they just got burned and some guys winning on all three of his games

[17:39] I know a guy who lost he lost 16,000 on Magic Girl

[17:42] 10,000 in Raza and 10,000 in Alice and one and I he paid for full on all of them

[17:47] But the Ghostbusters the thing with that

[17:50] That was the easiest pin to just go in on early for the LA because

[17:54] Distributors only asked for like a hundred bucks maybe a little bit more thousand at most and here's the thing

[17:58] You know Stern's gonna make it right?

[18:00] Stern is not gonna

[18:02] You know not ship the game or make you wait two years or make you wait three years like Jersey Jack did for the Hobbit

[18:09] But I'll say this I'm tempted to flip it because I

[18:13] Think that there's also a short window now where games are gonna be the darling games that everybody wants

[18:21] But how long is that gonna last like Ghostbusters hype right now is the highest it's ever gonna be right the games actually because what I think

[18:27] What happens to is when people actually get the thing that they're excited for it never lives up to the hype

[18:34] Just because it's like all expectations are so high, but then yeah, it's just a pinball machine, you know

[18:39] It's not good. I mean if it was like big bang bar in the ball went around some, you know, so there was like a video of

[18:49] Sorry Ted I don't mean to drag you into this drag him in

[18:54] Like you know if like some little LCD screen there was like, you know, big owls, you know

[19:03] Check of the week or whatever. It's like that. Yeah, it's like something different, but like

[19:10] For the price and everything, you know, I don't know. Maybe I'm just jealous because I don't buy it in the box anymore

[19:17] I just kind of wait to see what happens, but getting you know Ghostbusters was a definite good decision for anybody that did and

[19:26] I hope it's it's great game, you know

[19:31] Well, we're gonna we're gonna find out soon because it the latest is the pros of shift and I heard there's some delays at

[19:38] Stern right now where they're actually

[19:41] Freezing the pro manufacturing and they're gonna put the LEDs on the line, but it looks like LEDs are gonna come out in

[19:47] July now, so there's a little I think Stern's

[19:51] Stern sort of got hit hard with a lot of orders so everything from spider-man Vee

[19:56] They were still making

[19:58] Metallica premiums and even like Star Trek's and they had like nine games on the line when you think about that

[20:05] It's kind of crazy how

[20:08] Prolific they are right now in making so many different titles. Is there anything Ryan that you were you were tempted to preorder or go in on with like all the new

[20:17] Pins coming out with like Lebowski and

[20:20] Hobbit and Rob Zombie

[20:22] It's funny you say that because it's the answer is absolutely not like I

[20:28] Used to kind of get obviously like I said earlier like I was every new in the box

[20:34] I was in with coin taker and

[20:37] recently

[20:38] I just kind of hold back and just just see what how it materializes like how pins co-develops or how

[20:47] What people's reaction or because like I'm gonna be honest with you like I like Mustang like I like Game of Thrones

[20:55] It's one of my like I watched it last night. It was one of like my favorite shows

[20:59] It's like I wanted to game of thrones, but I held back because

[21:05] You know, I just want to see how it developed and

[21:09] You know like hold my money for you know the no Toyota comba truck that I want like just

[21:14] You know when I talk earlier before the podcast and I just wanted to you know say that you know

[21:21] I really appreciate you bringing up

[21:23] Mike Chestnut and

[21:25] How the Pins Eye community, you know that guy was a legend, right?

[21:29] And I like I told you earlier I you know medieval madness and Iron Man in a black night

[21:35] 2000 well long story short the black night 2000 was restored by the pinball club that I'm in and

[21:43] The all the chromework even the wire forms the coin door everything was

[21:49] sent out to Mike Chestnut, right and I could have sold that at Alentown

[21:54] I had a high price tag on it, you know people always offer something

[21:57] But it's a dedication to him and people really appreciated that like just being able to play

[22:05] Even up to the new Ghostbusters and all that stuff like just being able to play an old-school machine that was so

[22:11] Like well

[22:13] respected and just especially with his

[22:16] Yeah, his touch was magical, right? So I was actually showing Ryan before we started recording

[22:22] Some video of the apartment and I was showing him my tells the Arabian Knights and I was explaining him that I

[22:29] Took off a lot of the parts and sent them to Mike Chestnut

[22:32] About a month before his accident and actually I had correspondence with him a week before his accident where he

[22:39] He let me know they he was almost finished with all my parts and I actually got word from the people who are handling his affairs

[22:46] He actually like finished all my parts

[22:48] I also do feel like a sense of a pride that you know his his work is gonna live on in so many machines, right?

[22:54] And I think people did an amazing thing in the thread recently where they were just all sharing pictures of the different machines

[23:00] He's worked on for people and his legacy will remain

[23:04] Immortalized in in the machines that he touched which is great and I heard from

[23:09] Chris at Hot Rod arcade that Mike's family is gonna be continuing the business

[23:14] So I know that's really good news for people who want to see

[23:18] Mike's family, you know benefit from the great work in legacy. He created and also just see Mike's legacy live on because I think he built a brand

[23:26] You know if you say your machine was done by you know Mike Chestnuts

[23:29] Plating company it like it means something to people so I think that's really cool

[23:35] Ryan you were so what you were saying before I want to go back to because I think it was really interesting

[23:39] your attitude of

[23:41] Wanting to wait to see a game develop. I think is a a mature approach to this hobby that not many people

[23:51] Bring because of their excitement and anxiousness to get to stuff new

[23:56] Not what I had when I first entered the hobby. I'll tell you that well

[23:59] I can I can't imagine though and and I think about other forms of entertainment in my life like

[24:04] Whether it's automobiles or video games or other things I buy for pleasure

[24:09] There's nothing else where you buy it and then you have to wait like a year or two for it actually to be finished

[24:17] You know, it's it's this like strange thing where

[24:20] You know, I imagine buying a video game and like it's just like it does the levels are incomplete

[24:26] And you you just keep waiting for patches to be released and I think what's you know

[24:31] I've been following the hobbit recently and it's I don't know part of me is just like I just think it's I just think it's annoying that all these companies

[24:39] Shipgames with such minimal code where and they know that home collectors are the only ones really buying these things for the most part

[24:48] You know some of them are put on location and but is an operator really gonna drop like a $9,000

[24:53] $1,000 hobbit into like a public setting and let someone destroy it and especially a game that requires code to get into it because it's such a

[25:02] Narrative and story-based game. I just think you know

[25:06] It's unfortunate that it takes so long for these damn companies to finish the games before they sell on me

[25:11] I wish if there's one thing that could change it's like you're it's a

[25:14] I wish it would be a legal to ship a pinball machine until the code is finished

[25:18] But I don't know people but as long as people keep buying them though, you know

[25:22] I the big Lebowski that game it's been in production now for over two years

[25:26] They ship it and the code is like 0.42 version and people shout out 10 grand for it

[25:32] I think that's crazy because people don't even know if the pins actually gonna mature and be great, right?

[25:39] So they've and it's the most expensive pinball machine ever sold new in box

[25:44] And it just goes to show that like people are willing to just put the work of art in their living room and just hope it turns good one day

[25:51] Yeah, it

[25:54] Well said

[25:56] It's definitely

[25:58] You know the the mature collectors away in on it and and talk about code and

[26:05] the mature collectors will talk about code and and

[26:10] The game and just all the features and way you know analyzing it to death

[26:16] But you know it just comes down to you know personal preference what your family is into you know

[26:25] These days people definitely like you're saying it's put way too much into the whole

[26:33] should everything be this complete package and

[26:36] I think it's true for the money you're spending but at the same time like it's a monopoly right now

[26:43] Stern is running the show. They're doing a good job. I mean, you know Ghostbusters is a prime example like

[26:52] It's the hottest thing right now, right? So

[26:56] I think I think what Ghostbusters show their Ryan is like if you go down the checklist of what people want which is like great theme

[27:04] They want great theme they want great artwork. They want great code right and they want great like just fun

[27:11] Like great shots in the pen like if Game of Thrones artwork was good

[27:15] Like imagine if like they had hand drawn zombie 80 art that that thing would have been just as hot as those busters

[27:20] Oh my gosh

[27:22] Exactly. Yes

[27:25] Yeah

[27:27] Because I would argue that Game of Thrones shoots better than Ghostbusters in terms of flow and is not like

[27:33] Doesn't drain as much doesn't have as many toys as Ghostbusters

[27:38] But it's just you know, it was hard for people who love that show so much to have to digest that artwork is the own

[27:45] That's it. That's all you can get is this like Photoshop crap now

[27:49] Stern's turned a corner now and I think they realize shit if we stop photoshopping and mailing it in on the art

[27:56] We're gonna see the the orders double

[27:59] Ungood themes and I think I think that's why people are so excited now to see what comes next because

[28:05] Zombie Yeti is gonna do another machine with them. I'm dirty Donnie is and

[28:10] Also, there's so many great artists out there like it doesn't it's not expensive hiring a really great artist to do the work

[28:17] But they were just they were just like old dudes with Photoshop like dropping clip art around the playfield for like 10 years

[28:24] It was really shit

[28:27] Up until now yep, I mean, you know, it's just like every one that's out now

[28:34] It's it's it's like you know full throttle

[28:39] One of my buddies from the Pymbo Club is in on that you know, there's aliens coming up with that you can interchange it

[28:46] I guess and a lot of the new stuff like you're saying the big Lebowski. It's just it hasn't proven itself yet

[28:56] So so that's why I'm so it's so easy to say no to it

[29:01] It hasn't proven itself yet like Stern has built that reputation that you know since the Simpson days

[29:10] The Simpson's pinball party whatever that they can survive through anything and and people want to pick on that

[29:16] But it's just like they've proven themselves right and all these other companies like until they want to charge the big box and all this other stuff

[29:24] It's like do you think right do you think all these so there's a lot of new companies that have you know come up

[29:30] They'll ask a couple years. So you've got Dutch Pymball. You got highway. You got spooky

[29:36] You got the Thunderbirds guys down in what like Australia or New Zealand

[29:42] Do you think everyone's gonna survive like Jersey Jack like two years from now? Do we see all these guys still making games?

[29:54] Ted

[29:56] Yeah, you know

[30:00] Wow, that's a lot of the question you don't have the name name specifically

[30:05] But you know, if you're I think if you're upfront honest and have a good business model

[30:11] and you you know you have the marketing background and

[30:16] Can comment a lot more than that than I can but you have a good business plot on good marketing strategy

[30:23] I think you can

[30:25] You know win win scenario with your customers versus profit for your company, but not everyone's gonna make it

[30:32] Sterns

[30:34] Pipple in the industry and

[30:37] They're going to make these smaller companies. They're gonna make them step their game up to a level that's you know

[30:46] cheaper and more desirable as far as quality and what you get in a game

[30:51] They're gonna make them drive them to that and that they have to come up and figure out the new way to do that because

[30:58] The bar set with what you're gonna go with the stern

[31:01] Right

[31:02] Yeah, no, and I think what happened is is where stern wins is you know not just their ability to manufacture

[31:08] But it's the it's the you know the decades of experience is with like

[31:13] Signing licenses like Gary Stern walks into these big studios, right and

[31:18] His portfolio of what he's developed over the years is is phenomenal when you have these new startups

[31:26] It's gonna be hard for them to secure the kinds of license that Stern could secure because I know for a fact that Stern and JJP

[31:34] We're both fighting for Star Wars

[31:37] Now if you're if you're Disney

[31:41] Who are you gonna go with you know the guy who's got 30 years of experience or the guy who's

[31:46] Just shipped one machine and if you google it

[31:49] It's all these people complaining that they didn't get their machine in time and they've been waiting two years, right?

[31:54] so I think and Gary and Stern also they

[31:57] The supply of parts. I mean if there's anything that keeps a pinball machine from being

[32:02] On the line and getting made it's a lot of it's just the getting the vendors lined up to get you the parts to actually put the machine online

[32:09] Because I will go on the record Ryan by saying that I don't think that making pinball machines is hard

[32:15] And I'm gonna have a separate podcast about this. I just think a lot of companies go in there

[32:20] And they're just they don't have a plan like to your point

[32:23] They don't have the marketing lined up properly. They don't have the manufacturing people on board that they need

[32:28] They don't have the parts lined up so what they do is they they they show something or they reveal a title and they have no idea

[32:36] Really how to make it yet like aliens a good example of that that game was supposed to come out a

[32:42] Year ago

[32:43] I don't think people the only two companies that have been successful are spooky and Stern and both of them have done the same exact thing

[32:49] They don't show you the pinball machine until it's already made and done and then you can go buy it

[32:55] That that needs to be the practice that everyone adopts because I think people if you read on Pinside too and you're on there

[33:01] You know, there's just a lot

[33:02] I think there's just a lot of fatigue by people being burned and waiting for so many years and then by the time the pin comes out

[33:08] There's like no real excitement anymore for like the hobbit or big Lebowski because people waited so long

[33:15] And it's the same machine they saw two years ago

[33:19] Yep, they get burned out and people want the new and exciting and you know

[33:26] throw cash at it now

[33:28] type of thing and

[33:30] They're it just you know, I

[33:33] Honestly, I like the habit

[33:36] To a point though. I mean, it's just it's not the new and exciting anymore

[33:42] It's like I saw it two years ago, but to each of their own, you know, you know what what some what someone

[33:51] Is into now

[33:53] If it makes sense for you know you and your family, I think it's a good investment

[33:59] Right, one of the biggest things with today's market is that

[34:06] too many people

[34:08] are

[34:09] trying to

[34:11] make an investment out of it and

[34:13] it's just

[34:15] It's not gonna work because it's the market saturated

[34:19] Right, I think everything is gonna go down in value and I you know

[34:24] It's I don't know any other entertainment in like category where

[34:29] Things just will keep keep like holding their value or going up because it just I

[34:35] I've seen a lot of pins for sale recently a lot of people are

[34:39] selling like Star Trek alleys even a lot of tron alleys are going up for sale recently and solely because

[34:45] People need to raise capital to get the newer pins

[34:48] I mean if you want to go by Ghostbusters, Ellie and hobbit

[34:53] I mean that's sixteen seventeen thousand dollars. You know, you've got to free up

[34:59] to get those two and

[35:02] But you're still seeing people asking like what they paid if not more for like an ACAC DC premium

[35:09] Now how can AC DC premiums just

[35:12] Keep holding value and going up. We'll see that the month today for like it was like 10 grand or something

[35:19] Like I told my interest

[35:24] Some guys got a Lucy I saw that and he wants like over 10 grand for it. We wouldn't take 9500 for it

[35:30] and

[35:31] You know like I think

[35:33] Ultimately you and I won't determine what the market will ultimately bear in terms of prices, but I think people will

[35:43] Ultimately

[35:44] You know all the prices are gonna go down because I think innovation is gonna go up to like once Stern starts putting LCDs on everything

[35:50] There's no way people are gonna want like the

[35:53] The dots and you know the old DMDs. There's no way. It's gonna make

[35:57] DMDs look as outdated as you know solid state games and and and EMs eventually and I think

[36:06] Innovations gonna keep pushing it forward that Star Trek was an awesome game like in what like 2012?

[36:13] You know when it's 2018 are we are we gonna be going back and playing a game that's six years old?

[36:19] Maybe I don't know maybe maybe you know who knows but

[36:23] I think you're right though. I think but then again like the devil's advocate Ryan is like

[36:28] But then you know, I just made two grand on ghost busters as if I went in purely as an investment and purely as a speculative move

[36:37] So there's gonna be winners and losers, right? It's just like any investment

[36:41] Question to you. Let's ask this question. How how was Tottenham?

[36:45] Not been lined up. Are you sick of it already?

[36:48] Do you love it? I played it for two hours and then I set my parts to Mike Jess nut

[36:53] So I

[36:55] Haven't played it like I'll say this I'll explain why I got a totem. I I am not

[37:03] Someone who's like great at pinball

[37:06] Right I suck. I don't I love playing pinball

[37:10] I I'm not chasing I have PA points. I don't enter tournaments. I

[37:16] Love pinball machines that are first and foremost are fun to shoot, right?

[37:21] So I just love a game that has like fun shots. I also just love a pinball machine

[37:25] That's just aesthetically beautiful because I only can put one in my living room

[37:29] So it becomes like a piece of furniture and I do think that totem is still one of the most like

[37:35] Amazingly beautiful machines to look at I you you just stare at it and it just it's just it's just it's

[37:43] J-pop knew I'd make magical looking games

[37:45] I know it's not gonna be as deep as my Lord of the Rings was and it's not gonna

[37:49] Probably have as much immersion as that game had but that's fine and a lot of people were like you're gonna get sick at

[37:56] Tottenham because it's easy and you're gonna beat it and I'm like man that's exactly why I wanted

[38:01] Yeah, I think I get to Valor or like spend my life trying to do that

[38:08] Because no one gives a shit like even like all my friends like if I'm like hey man

[38:12] Like I destroyed the ring in 38 minutes on my pinball machine

[38:15] They're all they'll just look at me like what the fuck is wrong with you man like

[38:19] Congratulations

[38:21] But no, it's I think totem's gonna work out, but my my dilemma is this it's I

[38:27] I've sort of

[38:29] Conceited that I think life is more fulfilling and I'll enjoy the hobby more if I rotate games in and out versus trying to build the collection

[38:39] Yeah, my my goal is to what you were saying earlier

[38:43] Is I want to buy machines? I don't care if they're new in box or not

[38:47] I want to buy them when the codes mature because I got Lord the Rings when it was like finished and I loved it

[38:53] But I wouldn't want to like buy a machine like hobbit and like wait a year for the code to develop

[38:59] I just I just I know guys try to justify it by like oh it's great

[39:04] You get to like watch your child grow up and it every you know every six months it comes alive again

[39:09] It's like yeah, well

[39:12] Yeah, like I don't I don't really I don't really want to see a pinball machine mature over over the years

[39:18] I want to just play it the way the designer intended it to be played so my go but then my dilemma is like ghost buses

[39:24] Ellie which I would love to put that in the living room maybe

[39:27] Sell my toad in the thing with this toad in is I paid 7800 but I didn't I didn't realize this when I bought it

[39:34] But it was coming from Canada and the guy had said like oh it's only 400 bucks to ship it to the states

[39:41] Like that was that was a bullshit lie that he gave me

[39:45] Because it cost me like all in to get this thing from

[39:49] Canada to New York City like

[39:51] 1200 plus bucks

[39:54] You're the like come across

[39:56] Obviously as you're very well polished you look into things. How did this pass you like let's analyze this for like well

[40:04] Yeah, the shipping like what happened was

[40:07] What what what what what happened is like the cheapest cheapest company possible

[40:12] Yeah, they would like they would ship it for like

[40:15] 455 in her bucks

[40:17] But then you yeah, I reach out to them. They're like yeah, but we're not gonna pick it up at like a resident

[40:22] Like it's got to be picked up at like one of the

[40:25] The freight centers or you know one of the docs and I'm like well

[40:29] Bad

[40:31] Yeah, after a nine o'clock in the night or something

[40:34] Yeah, but but I'll say I'll say this Ryan iby can't no matter and this is like I think everyone can relate to this

[40:41] I became like everybody else when you see something you really want

[40:44] You'd stop thinking like an intelligent human being

[40:48] You start to just think emotionally about it and I was like oh my god

[40:51] This is like a beautiful tales of the Arabian nights

[40:54] This guy like he put a new play field in he rebe it rebelled the play field

[40:59] It's gorgeous to look at but here the thing here the mistakes I made

[41:03] I didn't have them like send me the most detailed picks from underneath the play field

[41:08] And so there was definitely like some grime and dirt and things that you know if you're gonna

[41:12] If you're gonna rebuild the play field you think you would like restore some of the things that would be easy

[41:17] Restores he didn't do any that

[41:19] You think he would have put play field plastic protectors, which is the easiest thing to do

[41:23] He didn't do any of that you know, so I had to like take a part half the play field just to put the plastic protectors on

[41:29] But that's just that's how it is you know, I saw the shiny parts. I didn't I didn't want to see the dirty parts

[41:35] But I'm learning like you know everyone learns as they go but but now I'm like all I want is new in box because of that

[41:42] I'm like

[41:43] New in box doesn't have those issues

[41:45] Yep

[41:48] The first thing the first thing I would caution you on is saying hey is it a re-import

[41:56] But at the same time then you know

[42:00] You made a great decision on Lord the Rings you know, you made a great decision on Tone. I am I opinion

[42:07] Like getting into the hobby for me. I just grabbed what was

[42:11] locally available like not playing it ever not researching it at all

[42:16] Just hey, you know, what's available? What's what's a decent price at the at the end of the day

[42:22] The way this industry's going it's um, it's more of like kind of your preference and

[42:29] What kind of makes you smile at the end of the day, you know as Ted would say like like what kind of gets you go like what

[42:36] Makes you happy what what your friends crowd to it in the day

[42:40] Because that that's the the pieces you're gonna want to hold on to when your collection not the game that just sits and gets

[42:47] Unplayed, right?

[42:49] Great if you have the collection piece of that, but who's gonna want to play it?

[42:54] No, I agree and it's you know, I think that's that's a great point because so much of the whole reason why there's drama and so much bickering is the whole hobby is subjective

[43:03] Like this is the most subjective

[43:05] hobby I've ever been in like what I love cars too like if someone wants to

[43:09] Tell me their cars faster than my car

[43:12] I can go race them in my health cat and we'll see who's faster like there's an actual like weighted determined which car is better

[43:20] Right, but in pinball it's there's none of that right? It's a subjective experience and to your point

[43:27] Someone might love the hobbit someone might hate the hobbit and to each their own the good thing is there's a pin for everybody

[43:33] Because there's so much variety available now

[43:35] So Ryan I want to thank you. I know I kept you you got to go get some pizza and watch the the end of the cabs game

[43:41] Thanks for joining the podcast

[43:43] Let's do this again. It's great to just talk to people in the hobby and I'm pin-side

[43:47] What's your username so people know to look out for you and give you shit for joining canators pinball podcast?

[43:52] It's red eyes I read eyes and I want to go on the record to say that I

[43:58] I for one of the fan and

[44:01] Enjoyed just just the the the conversation the the realness and a lot of look this conversation you've been bringing up lately

[44:12] I think it's healthy. I think it's good when it's kind of you know

[44:17] Table right right right home. Yeah, so thank you for what you provided for all of us as well

[44:26] So don't don't forget the fact that we appreciate what you do every day

[44:30] You're welcome you're welcome, and we'll keep doing it. We're gonna do it on the podcast

[44:34] But I think I think canators presence on pin-side is left a lasting effect where people are no longer

[44:41] nervous about sharing opinions even if they're not popular because that's what democracy's all about in freedom of speech

[44:48] All right, Ryan. I appreciate it man. Hey, thank you from Pennsylvania to work. All right, brother. Have a good night

[44:55] All right, so that was our interview with Ryan. Sorry a little bit there at the end right when we were finishing up

[45:01] I'm dog sitting for the week and Brenda came home and the dog starts barking Brenda comes through the door

[45:08] Ryan had to go get pizza so it was like all this stuff was happening right the end

[45:12] But I hope you enjoyed that interview. I think there's a lot of lessons to take away for for people

[45:17] In in terms of how to approach collecting how to think about pinball as a

[45:22] As an investment. I think this is an answer. There is no answer. There is no

[45:27] It's this isn't like a black or white issue

[45:30] Pinball at times can be an investment that sees people get a good return

[45:34] I still think pinball is a decent investment even if you don't want to flip because I don't see machines really losing a ton of money

[45:42] I think we've all been burned in in the stock market and with other investments where we've lost all of our value

[45:48] You go out for an expensive dinner and yeah, it's great

[45:51] But then two hours later you should it out and you got nothing to show for it

[45:54] So anyway, I think it's a debate that we'll never end and it's also a debate that keeps the pinball hobby interesting for many many people

[46:02] So that's it. This is episode 38 of Canada's pinball podcast

[46:07] Again, if you want to be on the show or you want to send me a note about the show hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com
