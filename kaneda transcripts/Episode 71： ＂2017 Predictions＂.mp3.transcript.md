[00:00] Come on! Come on, Jack!

[00:03] Hey, Cod!

[00:05] Think about the future!

[00:10] I don't think I've seen a year that people have been so excited to be over with then

[00:23] 2016.

[00:24] So, as we look forward to 2017, we have a lot of expectations and hope that it will

[00:31] be a better year than what we saw in 2016.

[00:34] And when it comes to pinball, which is probably the most trivial thing that people are worried

[00:40] about in the world, it's going to be an interesting year.

[00:45] I think that 2016 failed to deliver on a lot of its promises and was mostly identifiable

[00:52] with quality issues, delays, and false promises.

[00:57] Now, I still expect to have a whole bunch of the same types of things occur in 2017.

[01:03] But if what we're predicting to happen in 2017 comes true, there's going to be a lot of new pinball out there.

[01:11] And I think that's exciting.

[01:13] On this special episode of the Canadian pinball podcast, I sit down with Blake, Do Miss Nile,

[01:18] to talk about what we think is going to happen in the pinball world in 2017.

[01:24] It's a little bit over an hour.

[01:26] You know I don't like to go too long with these podcasts, so I'm just going to air it.

[01:29] I hope you enjoy it.

[01:31] I didn't get any emails from you guys about your predictions.

[01:34] So after you listen to this podcast, if you want me to read out what your predictions are for 2017

[01:41] or if you agree or disagree with any of this, just email me at canadapinball.com

[01:47] and I will happily read your feedback.

[01:49] It's good to be back in the saddle.

[01:51] We look forward to talking with you guys a lot more frequently as we head into 2017.

[01:56] Happy New Year, everybody, and enjoy.

[01:59] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canada's pinball podcast, Blake Do Miss Nile,

[02:05] to talk about 2017 predictions.

[02:09] And for those of you who maybe haven't heard one of my Blake interviews in the past,

[02:13] Blake is a great guy.

[02:15] He's a creative director.

[02:16] He's working with NASA.

[02:18] He worked on Domino's pinball with spooky.

[02:20] And he's a big pinball fanatic.

[02:22] Blake, welcome back to the show.

[02:24] Happy New Year, Chris, how you doing, sir?

[02:26] I'm doing good.

[02:27] The break was really good for me.

[02:29] I got to take a couple months off and realize that when you turn off the forums,

[02:34] your overall health increases significantly.

[02:37] So I'm feeling good.

[02:39] You get a lot more positivity back in your life, right?

[02:42] Definitely.

[02:43] Definitely.

[02:44] I mean, it's...

[02:45] But you know what?

[02:46] We're going to...

[02:47] I'm diving back in.

[02:48] I went back on Pinsider the last few weeks and I think it's the perfect time for us.

[02:52] What is it?

[02:53] January 2nd.

[02:54] For us to look at what we think is going to happen in the pinball world come next year.

[03:01] Now, before we get there, Blake, what were your thoughts just like over on 2016?

[03:05] I mean, that year was really built up to be like one of the biggest sort of like golden errors of pinball.

[03:12] And I don't know.

[03:13] Did you think it delivered on that promise?

[03:15] No.

[03:16] I think that there was...

[03:18] 2016 felt like one of these years of a sort of in limbo where there was a whole lot that happened.

[03:23] But there was a whole lot that didn't get executed or actually come to fruition like it was supposed to.

[03:29] And it was kind of funny because I have mixed feelings because we saw, you know, some few games really come out.

[03:37] But, you know, you had a game like Ghostbusters that I think was one of Stern's best games, if not its best game.

[03:44] So, you know, I see that as a real bright light in 2016, honestly.

[03:49] Right.

[03:50] You know, overall, it was not really a great year and I think it did be a big letdown.

[03:56] But hopefully we'll see it turn around in 2017.

[03:59] Right.

[04:00] And I agree.

[04:01] I think 2017, I think, is going to either fulfill the promise of 2016 or or really start to send the hobby into...

[04:13] I think a little bit of a negative space where people are going to realize, you know what?

[04:18] Like maybe there's just never going to be a new golden era of pinball where machines consistently come out in a timely manner.

[04:26] So, but let's jump right to it and here's how we're going to do it because we want to keep it a little bit organized.

[04:32] So what Blake and I are going to do is we're going to give predictions going company by company.

[04:38] And we're going to talk about what we think 2017 holds for the different pinball manufacturers that are out there.

[04:45] And then we'll just talk sort of on some other general topics about what we think might occur in 2017.

[04:51] How does that sound, Blake?

[04:52] Sounds great to me.

[04:53] All right.

[04:54] Let's jump right in.

[04:55] So we have to start with the big dog, Stern Pinball.

[04:58] They just released Batman 66 in like the last week or two.

[05:03] They're still sort of just trickling out the SLEs and the L-E's.

[05:07] Blake, what do you think is like 2017 holds for Stern?

[05:13] I think 2017 is going to be a really big year for Stern.

[05:17] 2016, you could chalk part of it up to a successor Stern because Ghostbusters was a huge seller for them.

[05:25] And I think that it, I think they knew it was going to be a good game, but I think maybe it really caught them by surprise a little bit too in terms of just how well it sold and what the demand was.

[05:34] I think that you saw that translate into how they handled the super L-E's and the demand for Batman 66 and just how quickly both of those games sold out.

[05:44] So, you know, I think that they have a lot to be proud of, but at the same time, you know, I think there were a couple games that didn't make it out in 2016 that were probably supposed to.

[05:55] There was probably at least one game that probably was supposed to be out that didn't make it.

[06:00] So, I think that they're going to use 2017 as an opportunity to start off fresh.

[06:05] They're rolling the LCD out with Batman and probably Aros Smith very soon.

[06:11] And I think they're going to end up cranking out probably three cornerstone games like they have said that they want to each year this year.

[06:20] And if we look at so Batman, you could consider that technically a 2016 game, but it really is going to be a 2017 title.

[06:29] So, they've got that. They definitely have Aros Smith coming out because I've seen the video of Aros Smith and I said in my last podcast, I think people are going to really be excited by that title.

[06:39] It looks like Metallica on crack is what I've been saying.

[06:43] There's rumors of Pope fiction. I keep hearing that. Do you think Pope fiction is going to come out as a Stern Pimbal machine in 2017?

[06:51] You know, that's a really interesting rumor because it's definitely not a theme that I would have thought of for Pimbal machine, but at the same time, you know, I think that they are bleaching out and they're doing some really cool things with games like Metallica and likely with Aros Smith.

[07:10] That you wouldn't have necessarily thought of when you think of those themes. And so in terms of the look and the feel and sort of the attitude that they can give those games, I could see a Tarantino film actually translating pretty well into a pen. Now, man, I have no idea if that really is legitimately going to be made.

[07:30] There's nothing to really tie into that theme in terms of timing or yeah, Pope fiction has become a cult classic over the years.

[07:41] You know, is it going to be any more of a cult classic by, let's say this summer than it was five years ago, not really. I think it kind of has earned that status and.

[07:52] And I think people that like it will always love it, but it would certainly be an interesting thing to see what they could do with it with the right artists involved and the right kind of sound bites and if they were to get any actor talent involved or something like that.

[08:06] Well, it's going to be interesting with the LCD now too. Someone was saying the licensing agreements are even more challenging because they're going to have the visuals of the actors as well.

[08:19] But look, if anyone can pull it off, I think Stern can do it now. The big title that we know is coming out in 2017 for Stern is Star Wars.

[08:29] And this, I mean, I'm going to do a, a Canadian exclusive reveal here where I think people have been speculating back and forth, but I just want to confirm this is 100% accurate for you listeners out there.

[08:42] Star Wars is going to be the original trilogy. It's based on episodes three, four and five. So new hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

[08:53] That is what Stern Star Wars pinball will be based on. So it's not going to be Rogue One, Force Awakens. It is the classics. So that's going to be huge.

[09:04] I mean, these guys are going to knock it out of the park. Now, like we talked about I think in one of our previous podcasts that there was a rumor that they might make Ellie versions based upon each movie.

[09:17] So there be a Star Wars Ellie for a new hope. One for Empire and one for Return of the Jedi. Do you think knowing that Stern is selling these Ellie's out like hotcakes that Stern is really going to sort of not fleece the market, but offer more Ellie's this time around and maybe even increase the price.

[09:37] What do you think?

[09:38] Yeah, I think that that kind of follows along with the models that they've been setting up over the last couple of years or some of their, with some of their games, especially like Batman 66.

[09:50] They know that that game is going to be a massive success, especially if it really is based on the original trilogy, which you and I have been speculating for a long time that that is what it's going to be.

[10:03] And so, you know, the, it makes me wonder how they would handle the pros and the premiums if they do the Ellie's based on each film.

[10:13] I could also see them go the right route of like X men where you've got maybe a Bubba Fett themed Ellie or something that has a very defined art package based around, you know, iconic character.

[10:24] So Vader or Bubba Fett or even a stormtrooper possibly, I could see those all translating well into, you know, armor packages and stuff like that.

[10:34] So, so it does make me wonder kind of like I said, what the pro and the premiums going to be.

[10:40] So I totally think the Ellie's could be based on each of the original films.

[10:44] I think maybe the play fields in general might be sort of all encompassing of the original trilogy.

[10:52] I don't, I don't think it's separate toys from now.

[10:55] No, it's going to be like Lord of the Rings.

[10:58] I mean, yeah, if one game, the art packages could be different. That's easy to do.

[11:04] Now, it's interesting because like super Ellie's right.

[11:08] Let's talk super Ellie's for a second because if you were to think, well, what would the next game that would open the door for another super Ellie experience?

[11:17] I mean, you have to go towards Star Wars. There's not enough die hard, erosmith fans to to sell out that kind of money.

[11:25] But I heard, I heard another rumor and again that they're not going to, they're not going to do a Star Wars super Ellie that that really was sort of like a 30th birthday present one time thing.

[11:37] But I don't know if I'm Gary and I'm looking to have fast, they sold 80 of those Batman's.

[11:43] You can't tell me that, you know, 20 Vater editions couldn't go for 20 grand.

[11:49] Yeah, I mean, if they're looking at people that are willing to spend that additional, let's say, $5,000, you know, up to 15 for a super Ellie, they're going to want to tap that market, I would think.

[12:01] I mean, not to mention the fact that if they really do separate Ellie's for each of the films, and like you said, that increases the number of Ellie's well, then they're just making even more exclusive games that are going to appeal to die hard collectors.

[12:16] So, yeah, I could see them doing the super Ellie thing for Star Wars.

[12:23] I agree that they're not going to, they're not going to do it for every game.

[12:29] But look, you know, 2017 is going to be the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film.

[12:35] And I could see them using that justification just like they did with the 50th anniversary of Batman 66 to offer a limited amount of, let's say, 40 super Ellie's, you know, they'll sell everyone immediately.

[12:50] Absolutely. It's not even a question.

[12:52] I mean, they'll get people to send videos in show just how die hard of a Star Wars fan and a pinball fan that they are.

[12:59] And they'll vet people that way. So, yeah, it'll probably happen. I think that they learned a lot from the Batman 66 experience.

[13:08] And although there was a lot of feedback, both positive and negative, overall, they got what they wanted to accomplish. They sold every single one of those games at $15,000.

[13:18] Plus, they sold all the Ellie's at $10,000.

[13:21] Right. So, how much do you think, and this is going to, this will happen in 2017.

[13:26] And someone is going to put their Batman super Ellie up for sale. How much do you think that will go for it? Do you think it will increase in price? Or do you think it will decrease in price?

[13:40] You know, I feel like a part of that's going to depend on how the code starts to flesh out.

[13:45] I think if you're willing to spend that much money on a model because of how exclusive and limited it is, then the gameplay may not really matter to you because you can just go buy an Ellie or a premium from somebody else at that point.

[13:59] I'm going to say that initially, it might go up in value, but maybe only to 16 or 18,000.

[14:08] Wow. I mean, I have a hard time seeing it bring big bang bar numbers, but you never know. I think that there are a lot more die hard batman fans out there than there are big bang bar fans.

[14:22] Right. Well, here's my prediction is, I think it's headed south. And I think for one reason, one reason only, it's the same exact game as the $8,000 premium.

[14:34] And after a while, right, everyone, there's going to be like a thousand, if not more premiums that ship and they're out there.

[14:43] Once people realize everyone's having the same experience, I don't think the armor being different and the art being different is going to be enough to justify, especially if the rumors are true, that Stern is going to offer the top or for sale, the blades for sale.

[14:59] They're letting everyone make their lesser machines look close enough to the SLE. And like, I think that's a mistake. I think the top or should have been an SLE exclusive for 15 grand.

[15:14] I don't want to see my wheels on my AMG Mercedes on the base level Mercedes. I think that's a big mistake. Look, I think Stern is going to have an incredible 2017.

[15:25] I think it's going to be, they're going to be so successful next year because they're going to, they're going to keep shipping these like, as you said, these like, these cornerstone titles. And they're going to come out and they're going to be available.

[15:36] And I think everyone else out there has to be nervous about how 2017 could be the year where I think Stern really corners the market. Like it's never done it before.

[15:46] So, yeah, I think Stern is going to, I think they're going to have a lot of home runs this year. You know, one thing I was very curious to see after Ghostbusters was released. I felt like prior to Ghostbusters, Stern was still making a few hit and miss games.

[16:00] You know, you had some really great games like Metallica, ACDC was a great game. But then there were some misses in there, obviously like WWE.

[16:10] Some would even say, KISS was a little bit of a miss. It had a beautiful art package, but I personally am not fond of the gameplay. But what we've seen after Ghostbusters, I feel like we've seen this.

[16:22] And I'm going to use the word quality ironically, turning point with Ghostbusters because I feel like the overall passion that was put into that game.

[16:33] You're also seeing Kerry over in the Batman 66. And I think what we've seen so far from Aerosmith, it's going to carry on through that game. And so I think that we've seen Stern really raise the bar. And I think that they are going to take all this ghosting stuff seriously.

[16:49] They're going to make people right that have major, you know, clear, you know, clear-cut cracking and stuff issues on their games.

[16:56] And I think they're going to move on. You know, people are giving them a lot of shit and they deserve to give them shit for having those quality issues. But I think Stern is going to resolve it and they're going to move on and they're going to crank out some badass games this year.

[17:08] Well, yeah, I agree. I will say though, I still think quality wise when I look at Stern next to a JJP, I don't think they're there yet. And I don't think they have to be because I, again, I just don't think anyone else ships their pins in a timely fashion. And I think, you know, they'll iron out, yeah, like the major issues.

[17:30] But I do think now that Stern has seen that people will spend 10k for a machine, 15k for machine. It's time they start offering, you know, rad cows and busy guys. Like, you know, the stuff that really is higher quality items inside the machine. And we'll see if they do it.

[17:46] I think Gary's driven by the bookstown and by the accountants. So I don't know. And look, I don't think it matters. I think they're still going to sell out every single star wars before it's even shown.

[17:57] And then some. So let's talk about the, I think the next sort of viable Stern competitor out there. And that is Jersey Jack pinball. So Jersey Jack showed us dialed in probably the most contentious and

[18:14] but like polarizing theme I've ever seen revealed at an expo. It was Pat Lawler's much anticipated new machine. Everyone's always crying. They want original themes and then Jack goes and does it with the lawler and everyone cries because it's an original team.

[18:31] How do you think dialed in is going to do for this company Blake?

[18:35] I think that it may have a little bit of a slow start, but I think as soon as people are able to start playing this game once.

[18:44] If the collectors additions are going to go out first once those start popping up people start some more videos and pictures. And then especially I think once T. P. F. rolls around a March.

[18:54] I think it's going to end up being a pretty successful game. You know, I was, I was among the folks that I was watching the live stream during expo back in October and you could feel the air gets sucked out of the room when they announced that dialed in was indeed the name of the game and was the theme that had been speculated for I think almost a year or more.

[19:18] But at the same time I think until you have an opportunity to see the game in person and play it which you have been able to do.

[19:26] I've heard only but really positive things about that game from the people who have played them so.

[19:32] You know, I've got a really good friend here in Houston who's the largest distributor in the city really great guy and he's got a huge collection of stuff.

[19:41] And he's played dialed in now and even he said man it's it's a hell of a good game it's refreshing to see an original theme and he does think that people will get into it so I think it's going to be a big hit for them and you know I certainly wish Georgie Jack nothing but success with that game right.

[20:00] Yeah, I mean I'm torn on this title because I mean I love it I played it I enjoyed it the pinball player loves it the marketer in me is terrified.

[20:12] Yeah, how the market will respond to this game because I you know I watch people just clamor and and get in bidding wars to get my ghost busters elite a by my batman elite you know people the the power of theme of nostalgia the game.

[20:29] The nostalgia the emotional connection people have the themes is is unprecedented when it comes to pinball and this I just don't think this game is going to stir people emotionally like a star wars right like a toy story would like a you know an alien theme right so this is I think this is going to go down as being one of the greatest shooting pins that might turn out to be a commercial flop and I and I don't want it to be.

[20:58] But again the marketer in me the market resource that says a game based on cell phones and the weather and drones and selfies and emojis selling that to a 50 plus demographic good luck getting the orders to fly in yes the the admit there will be some initial surge in it when it comes out but like let's take the collective's addition how many collectives

[21:27] additions Blake do you think they're going to sell at 12,500.

[21:32] I think that you were you're writing your assessment on your last episode that they're going to round it up to to some form of a round number like 100 or 125.

[21:44] I don't think you're going to see more than 125 of those games made I just don't see enough people that have had the opportunity to play the game and see it for themselves in person that are going to want to spend that much money on it without playing it first you know so I think I think you're right I think it's going to be 100 or less but then Jack's been really notorious for releasing all sorts of variations of these games and it would not surprise me if the demand to be a game.

[22:13] The demand does go up after more people play the game will come out with some other form of a limited edition game you know right it'll be the red version with red armor and whatever you know find a find a way yeah and and in regards to your comments on the marketing aspect of it I couldn't agree with you more I was thinking the same thing when they unveiled it I'm like if you've got to pass out a comic book to explain what the storyline of this game is it might be a little convoluted you know.

[22:42] That's not to say that it won't be fun and I think that I really give Pat a lot of credit for really developing a brand new world under glass with that game and I know that's what he was going for but at the same time you're right it's it's trying to reach so many you know pop culture references within the last 10 years in terms of cell phone usage and emojis and all that stuff that it's going to be a lot of fun.

[23:12] It may feel dated after a period of time that's not going to take away from it being a fun game to play but I think that the people that really love the game are going to love it and then there may be others that just can't get past the theme or really get into it.

[23:27] Yeah and I think we were seeing that conversation taking place right now so JJ P as a company right they went through some very lean years and they got financial investors and now it's like they've got capital

[23:41] and this company is not going away and and Jack is no longer in charge of all of operations and that's good because he can focus where his strengths lie and we we've heard from him that it's no longer going to be like two and three years between reveals and titles now right because they can't survive if they only have like one game every three years.

[24:06] So there's rumors that we're going to see JJ P number four at expo. What do you what do you think that title could be?

[24:18] You know the rumors have been that it's going to be toy story and I think that that would be a really great theme that would be within JJ P's wheelhouse in terms of the type of games they like to make that are family friendly.

[24:33] The marketer me says that they're going to hold off on releasing that game until closer to the release of toy story for which is coming in 2019 I believe I don't think it'll be that long I don't think it'll be two years so that games released but I'm not sure if that's going to be the other game that comes out this year or not so.

[24:53] So toy story has been in the mill for a long time I also yeah the other one that I keep hearing is is pirates of the Caribbean which does have a new movie coming out next summer right it's actually this year is it's not what we're sorry I'm like I lost track of the year yeah so summer 2017 is the new pirates the Caribbean.

[25:16] So that would sort of make sense that if you're going to look at timing and connecting it to something going on in culture now pirates of the Caribbean as a property I'm sure it's like a billion dollar franchise I feel like the last movie wasn't like the greatest I feel like it's kind of run its course a little bit.

[25:39] And we've already had a pirate to the Caribbean machine from Stern so are we would you be excited I mean I just don't know I that theme doesn't like I really wouldn't go in and I'm tired to the Caribbean pinball machine but that's just me now and all honesty I I don't think that that would be a very smart move to go after that theme because one.

[26:00] The property like you said it's not nearly as hot as it was ten years ago in between the first film and the release of the second and third films you're right the last movie really didn't form that well I honestly don't expect the the fifth film to perform that well really this summer you know we saw we saw.

[26:20] Well a lot of blockbusters take a lot of hits this past year and it proved that only a handful of films were going to be very successful and then a lot of blockbusters that the studios were counting on did not and I think people are getting a little tired things are getting over saturated with these big superhero blockbuster type of franchises all this world building and stuff.

[26:44] And I just don't understand why they would go after that theme when it's been done before you know here's jack's got this great platform that's that is very different than what Stern's got and I would think that they would want to take that opportunity to do a theme that's never been done and mix it with a platform that is unique to itself so.

[27:06] Toy Story makes complete sense you know we've never seen a Pixar based pinball machine before and.

[27:12] Toy Story lends itself incredibly well to to pinball in my opinion there's a lot of characters a lot of scenarios and I think it could work well so.

[27:21] I don't know if I buy the pirates rumors or not but at the same time I'm not really sure what else they can be working on right now.

[27:29] Yeah I mean I will have to wait and see you know I think it's going to be interesting year for J.J.P. because if dialed in dozen do well commercially I think they're going to speed things up to get title number four on the line.

[27:44] So either you know whether it's successful or not I think dialed in will come out in April May I think we will see a new J.J.P. reveal by expo I hope it's Toy Story I haven't heard really anything else I do you know there are the you get the Hail Mary sort of rumors around Harry Potter I can't see that happening but who knows you know if jack has done a good job.

[28:13] And keeping his company's secrets secret so let's see we'll see what happens very true.

[28:21] Yeah so okay so let's go on to highway pinball now highway pinball is we really expected 2016 to be the year where alien would finally come out.

[28:34] I have beaten this dead horse a million times on the podcast let's just get right to it so do like do you think alien is going to come out in January and February what what's your prediction for highway pinball and alien in 2017.

[28:53] Well you know this is it seems like every month is a new shipping deadline they've set for themselves over the last six months you know I honestly don't think the game's going to ship in January I'm not sure it's going to ship in February I do think it'll start shipping by T.P.F. though I think they need to go into T.P.F. and be able to say we are shipping people shipping games to people's homes now.

[29:22] People be able to play the show and they they really are at a point where they need to I appreciate Andrew's efforts to get feedback from the community and to really try to incorporate what people want to see because he knows that that's his clientele and you know they're only going to buy what they really want but at the same time you know you're in marketing I'm an artist and we know what it's like to try to do things by committee and it's very difficult to try to.

[29:51] Get anything accomplished and try to and try to make everybody happy so I think that they're at the point where the game is is almost done they just need to crack down on releasing it the way they want to release it as a company tell people these are your options this is how the game's going to come out.

[30:09] And and move on from there so I think it's a I think it's a really cool game.

[30:17] I don't know how definitive of an alien game it is I'm still a little hurt by the fact that it doesn't have ripple in it and I'm not saying that that's a necessity but I think that that's a huge component of the franchise.

[30:32] I don't want to write the game off yet since I haven't seen it or played it but they know they need this game to be a huge hit right they need to get it out really soon because they've already taken a lot of people's money and I don't think they're going to be a whole lot more people that are willing to put money down until they see these games shipping right.

[30:52] Yeah I agree and then I've you know I don't want to belabor the the highway points that I seem to have been making frequently I think the future of highway pinball and I've said this before is in them shipping games and it's in them saying pencils down were done here it is you can buy it if you order it you're going to get your machine on this date once they can do that with a theme like alien I think they will not have pro.

[31:21] They will not have problems getting orders now my I also want to it's hard to predict like if I think the game will be great and will be successful in all this I it's too early for me to to tell right but what I do want to say is I do predict if they don't get alien Ellie's into customer hands by February I will predict that this company is in serious trouble there is no way that they can financially can take the game out and they can't do it.

[31:51] I will continue to spend weeks after weeks and not have aliens going out now we'll talk a little bit more at the end of this podcast like about like the viability if we think all these companies will be around but I think highway is going to trickle out some aliens through February and I don't know what the future is after that I don't think we're going to see game number three from them which makes the whole swappable play field pointless in my book pointless like yeah I think I'm going to be able to do that.

[32:21] If you do swappable play fields it'd be great.

[32:26] Sure well yeah I mean when you've got three and four different titles being released a year that gives you so many options but highway has built up the swappable play field concept a lot in their marketing approach to these games and right now they've got one game out that nobody really wants and now they're about to release a game that everybody wants

[32:50] but I'm still not sure that once people buy alien they're going to automatically start adopting full throttle I think full throttle is kind of done it's just the numbers I heard on it have been lackluster and once again talking to my buddy who's a big distributor here in Houston he had zero interest in picking that game up and he knew that it wouldn't sell to his clientele and so you're right they need they need to get alien out I think they're going to ride aliens.

[33:19] I think they're going to ride alien for the rest of the year probably I would be amazed if they reveal a new game by expo but quite honestly to keep them a minimum which they definitely need some momentum at this point they probably do need to be able to release another game by expo you know.

[33:36] Yeah I mean I guess we can just talk about it now I really I just don't know if highway pinball will survive to the end of 2017 the way things are going and I say that not because I want them to fail.

[33:48] I say it because of what I know to be the realities of manufacturing pinball from what I've heard from people within Stern from what I know from people who have worked on J.J.P.

[34:02] the company just got to be bleeding money and I just don't know how even if alien is a good game they get out of the red with alien because it's taken so many years to get there and it sucks it sucks and they they must have investors that that investment dollar has to have been dried up by now and I just look I really want them to just pencils down shift the machine and pray for the best for the company but I really want to get the best of the best of the company.

[34:31] But I really I like if we don't see a lot of aliens going out in January February it's looking bleak it's got to be looking bleak and this is just I think any financial person who would look at the situation would come to the same conclusion and I think that's what's hard in this hobby Blake is like people have a hard time separating their emotional desires the CD's company succeed with the financial realities of you know the financial reality is jack easy.

[35:00] Jack easily could have gone belly up with everyone's hobbit pre order money easily if you didn't get if you didn't get financial help and I mean I'm with you I don't want to see any company go under you know all of these companies are trying to contribute to the community to the hobby we've got more options now than we've ever had in the last 10 years and I certainly wish Andrew and oric in the highway guys nothing but success with this game.

[35:30] They're they've got a lot of goodwill with the fans there are a lot of people that want this game but you're right they they've got to get it out and they they can't mess around anymore I mean it's they I understand why they've set their platform up the way they have and I appreciate the fact that they've tried to do some different things with their stuff.

[35:54] But I think they're at a point where they just need to get the games made and worry about the innovation a little later you know and try to try to just show that they can mass produce a game basically what I'm saying so like I said yeah well they got to get their act together I think they know it I think they're aware of it but you're right alien is going to be making break for this company and I think that it's going to determine if they last beyond.

[36:24] So I think we're going to have a good game in 2017 well there you have it ladies and gentlemen we are we're rooting for this game to come out and we'll see what happens you know and I think by February 28th we will have a good indication if things are looking good or looking really bleak alright so let's move on to spooky pinball.

[36:44] Now spooky is in an interesting place with 2017 so they've sort of they're almost done I want to say manufacturing the 300 rob zombies I'm not sure if they're almost done but they should be coming to a close on that in 2017.

[37:02] Now they're they've already announced that in 2017 they're going to make spooky game number three and they're going to make 500 examples of that game no limited editions they increase the price just a little bit I think it's what like 6300 something around there.

[37:21] And what so so Blake and I know you work with these guys and Domino's what do you think and I know we have to get the numbers are little tricky right because domino's is not spooky game number three domino's is a game commission by spooky to build for domino's pizza corporation game number three like is like the spooky design game from the ground up that was the theme that they wanted to build right so what do you think spooky number three will be.

[37:51] So I actually I'm not going to lie I actually do not know what number three is actually going to be I thought I knew but but no I I'm not 100% sure what the game is going to be I do think that this is the game that they've said they're going to be bringing to TPF that will be revealed.

[38:21] And there have been a lot of rumors floating around about Jetsons and Scooby Doo and some of those types of properties.

[38:28] I do think that the rumor about Jetsons is true. I don't think that that is game number three I think Jetsons believe it or not was actually another commission game like domino's was that is going to be a very very limited game it's going to be a very basic game.

[38:47] And I think that spooky is really pulling out all the stops on what truly will be their third game and that's what I have thought was going to be Scooby Doo it might still be but I'm definitely not 100% sure that that's what it's going to be.

[39:01] I can see that fitting into the types of games they like to make if they've also done Jetsons and had success working on the Hanna Barbera properties then that would also lend itself to Scooby Doo.

[39:16] But who knows there have been other rumors like Army of Darkness and Scooby Doo and some other things.

[39:27] So I guess we'll just have to wait and see it but I think we're going to know by March who knows they may surprise everybody and bring two new games.

[39:37] You know they're also they were going to close the orders on domino's at the end of the calendar year for 2016 on December 31st.

[39:48] They have since decided to go ahead and wait until tpf they're going to bring domino's with completely fleshed out code at that point to tpf and they're going to take orders on the game.

[40:03] I believe until like April 12th or something like that. So basically through tpf and then a few weeks afterward.

[40:09] So they want everybody doesn't have the opportunity to see the game.

[40:13] You know domino's could say, oh we're not going to allow anybody to have these but our employees then everybody would be scrambling to get one just for the collectability of it.

[40:21] But David Lee said, hey we're going to make him available and if you want one you've got the opportunity to buy one.

[40:29] So I think Spooky's going to have a really good year. I think that they they really prove something big in 2016 by showing that they finished up America's most haunted and they reveal Rob Zombie and cranked out more than half of the machines in 2016 that they said they were going to and I think that's awesome.

[40:52] We also completed domino's in six months. So I think Spooky's going to keep chipping long in 2017 and I would not be the least bit surprised if you see a new game revealed at tpf and maybe even something in October possibly who knows.

[41:10] Spooky and yeah so you know I here's here's the thing whenever I talk about spooky I'm also like in a little bit of tug of war in my head because I love Charlie I love Ben I love the crew out there I think they you know they've always done this properly they've designed a game they then announce a game they then ship you your game.

[41:36] They do not get into the BS territory of pre-orders and you know constantly making changes and and towing people around for years. I love their approach it's like they it's like they know what they can do and they do it right and they make people they satisfy customers because they're honest with themselves and with customers I love the company for that.

[42:00] Yeah I think they're out of crossroads now where they need to up the quality of the games and when I say just not just like I don't say I don't think spooky games like are not good quality maybe the better word is the complexity and the skill right the craftsmanship of the game the design of the game has been a little basic and I think at this point now we have to get a spooky game.

[42:30] That feels on par with with a with a Stern pro and I think if they can get there right with they can get there with like mechanism design and engineering and then get there with play field layout that's really taking it to the next level you know I think that's what they need to do and the reason I say that is I think Rob Zombie was the greatest indication of them for you know them having people run to them and order 300

[42:59] but when you look at the second hand market of Rob Zombie games right yeah a lot of the people who ran there were run into flip because you know we grew up it over the last couple of years all believing that limited number equals more valuable that's just like big bang bar tron Ali this world of like scarcity equals value was driving boutique pinball

[43:25] and that and that looked at that pushed America's most honoured to sell all one fifty remember I mean remember people were buying America's most honoured for eight thousand dollars I think one even sold for nine thousand new in box when remember when the hype was driving this all you know it's all about the scarcity I think we're there at now saying there's going to be 500 of these machines

[43:45] but you know and their deposits are now non-refundable for thousand dollars I think the game just needs to like on its own be great it can't be driven by limited supply especially if they're making 500 yes that's not a big number but for spooky that's very big that's a lot of spooky machines under one theme.

[44:06] So that's I guess it's more of like my hope for spooky in seventeen is that I think if I could give them some advice I think they they should either hire a well known season season designer to join them or meck developer to join them and someone who really can take them to the next level I think they they need to get there I think if they stay where they're at they're going to start to see

[44:34] that the companies can start to stall a little bit in terms of demand for the product. I think that's a that's a fair assessment and one thing I I will always credit spooky for is that they are they're very aware of where they are and and where they're going the quality the work they're doing I think that they know they need to step it up a little bit more in terms of the complexity the creates activity.

[45:03] I think that they know that to quote something that you have brought up a few times which I wholeheartedly agree with I think they know that they want to add a little bit more magic into their games that games like Rob Zombie didn't really have and so I think that they are actively working towards that and that's why you've seen them come out recently and say you know we've hired a few new people they're they're working with some additional artists now on some of these games to step up the art packages.

[45:32] They are I think they're really trying to branch out and develop at their own manageable basically you know they're not they're not biting off more than they can chew they they they've always said they never they don't want to be stern they don't want to be that scale they can't crank games out like they do.

[45:51] But I think that they are trying to step it up and and I think that you will see some better quality games from them and I think that they've proven that they're just a very stable company and they they kind of keep their heads down get the work done and they don't screw around you know totally agree totally agree and I think that's why I still at the end of the day I do love spooky and I think they're going to survive because they will always they will always make decisions knowing what they're capable of.

[46:21] Achieving instead of what other people do which is make all these dumb promises like games going to be out in two weeks this and that and then nothing ever happens so we we I think it's going to be a good year for spooky and I think they will get that quality to increase and that sort of creativity to increase alright number six.

[46:39] Now this game has been on the coming out soon list for years and that is P3 multi morphic.

[46:51] You know what do we think I've talked to Jerry and he said February was when they were looking to get the bait like I think at least like ten or twelve beta systems out into customer homes.

[47:04] Do you think we're going to see it?

[47:07] You know I'm I'm a huge fan of the P3 platform I think Jerry's a great guy and you know they're they're local to Texas they're in my neck neck of the woods.

[47:20] But I we've seen nothing to show that they are ready to start producing these games yet and I think the platform has a lot of potential and I think that we see we have seen some of the most innovative stuff in the industry.

[47:36] Get incorporated into their machines in terms of how the LCDs use the flipper design and all that kind of stuff but we we don't have any knowing of of how are they going to produce these games on a mass scale you know I still have not heard an answer on how they're doing I think the last we heard Jerry said that they have been looking at some vendors looking at some facilities.

[48:03] But you've got to be well beyond that and set up to really start making these machines so I feel like that if they do get some of these beta games out there just going to be hand built prototypes just like everything else that they've been taking the shows up to this point so.

[48:16] I really would love to see P3 be successful I love to see a license theme get incorporated into their design.

[48:26] But man I kind of just feel like we may just be looking at another year of P3 being brought to all the shows they may roll out a few new games that can be incorporated into it and not really sure we're actually going to see games getting cranked out and sent to people's homes.

[48:44] Yeah I mean I have to agree I just the path of production at scale man that's a tough one in people right these things require so many parts and vendors and there's so much behind the scenes that goes on with vendors in parts that a lot of people don't realize where the big boys like Stern like they have locked down that a lot of vendors in parts that you just it's not easy to go just go.

[49:12] Go get your parts you need to make a machine because you won't be able to find the parts I think that P3 is a really cool innovation I think what they probably were expecting to happen by now is one of these big manufacturers like Stern would would come to them and say like we want to make some games on this platform yeah and help them put it together but I don't I don't think that's happened and I don't think Stern even cares to look to push the envelope further.

[49:42] Like why they're selling out they've got their factory set up to make the games that they make and in Stern in all honesty why would Stern want to sell swappable play fields when they're selling $8,000 full machines.

[49:57] It's never it's never been in their business model I think they have zero interest in doing that stuff because you know as we saw with pen 2000 it didn't work you know 17 years ago we have not yet seen it work for highway yet because they don't even have a second game out yet but yeah you know I appreciate the concept behind swapping play fields but I just don't think people are really good at it.

[50:27] They're really buying into it that much. I really don't. They never have I'll never you know the marketing market research is so crucial in any business and I just say always boggles my mind like what market research these companies do to come to these conclusions.

[50:44] There is no market research that would show that that is if you because you know what it is they create this arbitrary problem like well people don't really have space for multiple you know what no

[50:56] that's not true like when I look at people's homes and the videos people sent in for Batman like for the collector he has room right he has room right I mean you're right they they kind of have made more out of the issue than it really is an issue it's you don't hear people complaining about not having enough room really I I know people that that don't have a whole lot of room and they don't have a whole lot of games but they're not itching you know that's not the same thing.

[51:24] I mean I don't have a lot of games but they're not itching to to try to move into a new place that would allow them to buy a whole bunch of games I mean help I don't have a ton of room I could fit probably five or six games in my house

[51:39] but beyond that I don't have the desire to have an entire building behind my home you know just for my games it'd be great if I had the space and money but I'm not worried about swapping play fields at I'm just going to buy what I really really want to have in a

[51:53] traditional machine you know and so I don't know I agree I think that it's a bigger issue they're making a bigger issue out of it than it really is right all right well look let's see what happens in February planetary pinball and attack from Mars remake so this one was supposed to be announced at expo they still have an officially announced it is attacked from Mars I think T.P.F is a big issue

[52:22] I think T.P.F. is where they're going to show it for the first time like what are your thoughts on attack from Mars in 2017 do we even need it with all the new stuff coming out you know I don't know if anybody really cares at this point I mean I think that back when the market wasn't so saturated people might have cared a little bit more

[52:46] But after how long it took to get Medieval Madness out,

[52:50] I'm not really sure it matters.

[52:51] I mean, I think they've said that they may change

[52:55] a few things on the game.

[52:56] They may update a few things to make it a little bit different

[52:59] than the original game.

[53:01] Not sure what that would entail, but oh, man, I don't know.

[53:07] I just I think if people really want to attack from Mars,

[53:10] they'll be able to go get one.

[53:11] And quite honestly, the people that have those

[53:15] games, they're probably some of the same people

[53:18] that are going to be buying some of these other new,

[53:20] more expensive games.

[53:21] They may be even willing to let one of them go.

[53:23] And I think that you may start seeing some of those come up

[53:28] for sale again.

[53:29] I mean, I haven't heard of any original Medieval Madness

[53:32] is really selling that well now that the remakes out.

[53:38] And I don't even think that attack from Mars

[53:40] is selling that great, even without the remakes.

[53:45] So it's just those things doesn't really matter.

[53:49] I think that I like what Planetary's doing

[53:53] from the standpoint of giving people an opportunity

[53:56] to get some of these over games.

[53:57] But I think that what we really want

[53:58] to see is games that were so damn rare or not even finished

[54:04] that we would like to see finish.

[54:07] I think a game like Kingpin would be way, way

[54:10] more viable and would have a lot more people interested in it

[54:14] if that's what they were working on.

[54:16] But I just don't think attack from Mars is going to matter.

[54:19] Right.

[54:19] Yeah, I agree.

[54:20] It's a title that maybe five years ago

[54:24] when these titles were hard to find good examples of them

[54:28] that weren't routed.

[54:31] There was interest in this kind of stuff.

[54:33] But the past is the past.

[54:36] And the 2,000-hour games and the 90s games,

[54:41] like, why would anyone want to get excited about them now

[54:47] when there's so much new stuff?

[54:47] And I agree.

[54:48] Like, there's no one talks about medieval madness

[54:50] remakes, no one talks about getting them

[54:52] and caring much about them.

[54:53] I think it's cool that they're out there.

[54:54] I also think in the collector world, it kind of sucks.

[54:57] Because all these people who have nice examples, restored

[55:01] examples of those titles.

[55:03] And there's something they'd be said,

[55:05] I have a nice version of a game where they may be only

[55:07] made 2,000, 3,000 of them.

[55:10] But most of them were beat to shit.

[55:11] And I have a nice one.

[55:13] And then they just remake it.

[55:14] It spoils it.

[55:15] And I don't care what anyone says.

[55:16] This is not like a Shelby Cobra where matching numbers,

[55:21] original matters.

[55:22] No one gives a shit.

[55:23] It's the same exact game.

[55:26] It just, I don't know.

[55:27] It just loses its specialness.

[55:29] So I agree.

[55:30] I think they're going to show this game.

[55:32] I don't think orders are going to be that strong.

[55:34] I do recommend if they were to do something,

[55:36] they should take a page from what Stern has done.

[55:39] And when they remake these games,

[55:41] they should completely redo the art package

[55:45] and make it sing even sexier than it ever was before.

[55:48] And then it would be special.

[55:50] Because it's like attack from Mars, like, revisit it.

[55:54] Or whatever they want to call it.

[55:55] But imagine like Zombie Yeti doing the artwork

[55:57] on an attack from Mars, like with the cabinet

[56:00] and the play field, which is new art.

[56:02] Because the art's like kind of shitty.

[56:05] Yeah.

[56:06] That's what I would do.

[56:07] But they're not going to do that.

[56:08] They're just going to remake the same exact thing.

[56:09] No, they're not going to spend the time or the money

[56:13] to redo those type of aspects of the game.

[56:16] They're just going to crank it out as it was.

[56:19] And at that point, you kind of do have to scratch your head

[56:22] and wonder what is the point.

[56:23] Are there really that many people out there

[56:25] trying to get an attack from Mars?

[56:27] And then on top of that, chances are

[56:29] the price is going to be higher than what the games are selling

[56:33] for already as it is.

[56:35] Or it's going to be close to the price

[56:38] of some of these brand new Stern machines

[56:39] that we're seeing with LCDs and stuff.

[56:41] So it's like if you can go buy a brand new machine

[56:45] with newer technology for the same price,

[56:49] or even possibly cheaper, why would you go get?

[56:54] I mean, you'd have to be a really die hard fan of that game,

[56:56] you know?

[56:57] Right.

[56:58] So let's go on to American Pimball.

[57:03] American Pimball is, was probably the biggest surprise

[57:08] company of 2016.

[57:10] They came out of nowhere.

[57:12] They made a lot of promises.

[57:14] None of them came to fruition.

[57:17] Although we just got a message from them on Facebook the other day,

[57:21] saying that there were some legal issues and administrative issues

[57:24] that prevented them from getting the 25 magic girls out

[57:29] to customers before the end of the year.

[57:31] What do you think?

[57:32] What do you think 2017?

[57:33] Are we going to see Magic Girl and are we going to see Houdini?

[57:38] You know, it's, I guess I want to say yes.

[57:43] I'll be optimistic and say yes.

[57:46] But with a company that hasn't proven or shown anything

[57:50] in terms of their capability to produce a game, hell, I don't know.

[57:57] I mean, you know, I, I, I, I say this, I do think that they want

[58:02] to make it right on the Magic Girl machines.

[58:07] I think that they do want to earn that good will with people

[58:11] that were in on those games.

[58:14] And they see the potential in what the game had.

[58:17] It did have a beautiful art package and had some interesting things

[58:20] about it.

[58:21] Houdini certainly looks like a promising game as well.

[58:25] Looks very nice and complete.

[58:28] So I would love to see them be successful.

[58:31] I really, really do.

[58:32] But who knows what their logistical infrastructure is

[58:36] in terms of actually building these games and producing them?

[58:39] I mean, now, I think you've, you've got a little bit more inside

[58:44] into it than I do in terms of what's a realistic time frame

[58:48] that they would get the stuff out.

[58:49] But if they want to lay low and work on the games

[58:54] and then finally be able to come out and say, we've got them done

[58:57] and we're shipping them now, that certainly is better

[59:00] than dragging it out for two years.

[59:02] This one's also, this one's also hard for me to sort of share

[59:06] with the listeners everything I do know.

[59:09] But I also will say this, like, what I do know is this.

[59:13] They, they plan on shipping the 25 Magic Girls.

[59:16] So that plan has been public knowledge.

[59:20] When has always been the question surrounding Magic Girl,

[59:24] when will it be done and when will it ship?

[59:26] I still have not seen a finished Magic Girl.

[59:31] I have not.

[59:32] I have, I've been told that there are a few that are finished

[59:36] that are ready to go out.

[59:38] It's one of these scenarios where I'll believe it when I see it

[59:42] and I hope to see it soon.

[59:44] And I think we will.

[59:46] I just, they've worked on this over the last year,

[59:51] invested a lot of money in this project.

[59:53] And it's connected.

[59:54] It is connected to Houdini in the sense of,

[59:57] this is the first sort of proof point that American pinball

[01:00:02] is real that American pinball can manufacture,

[01:00:04] that American pinball can finish a game.

[01:00:07] What more difficult game to prove you can finish a game on

[01:00:11] then Magic Girl, which is, you know, the white whale

[01:00:14] the entire industry, the game that can never be finished.

[01:00:17] But by John.

[01:00:19] But I'll say this, the people's memories are short

[01:00:21] and their pockets are deep.

[01:00:23] And if Magic Girl does go out, that's step one.

[01:00:27] Step two of making Raza and Alice in Wonderland people whole,

[01:00:31] they'll have to cross those bridges next.

[01:00:34] They can't cross all the bridges at the same time.

[01:00:36] I think in 2017, if Magic Girl ships,

[01:00:38] you're gonna see a lot of Raza people screaming

[01:00:40] and arguing and yelling.

[01:00:42] But I urge those people to just like relax.

[01:00:44] Like, well, what would you like to have happen?

[01:00:46] Just zidware, go belly up and no one gets anything

[01:00:49] or do one step at a time.

[01:00:51] And this is step one.

[01:00:52] I think when Houdini comes out,

[01:00:55] and I think it will come out, and I think, you know,

[01:00:57] I do, I think it's gonna come out in six months.

[01:01:00] No.

[01:01:01] Just because history shows us that whenever people give a deadline

[01:01:03] before the game is fully designed,

[01:01:05] it's never, they never hit the deadline.

[01:01:08] So when the game is fully designed by Balsart

[01:01:11] and it's programmed and they know what they're making,

[01:01:15] then they should have been announced

[01:01:16] when we can expect to see it.

[01:01:18] But here's the thing, Houdini looks beautiful.

[01:01:20] I think if they can come out with a fun game

[01:01:22] with Houdini as the theme and the price point is good,

[01:01:25] like $6,7,000, they're gonna sell a ton.

[01:01:28] And people's memories of J-pop and being mad at him

[01:01:30] and saying how they'll never support American Pimple,

[01:01:33] those memories or those promises will be out the window

[01:01:37] and people will go in on the title.

[01:01:39] Yeah, I mean, I think they're in a situation

[01:01:41] where they sort of have nothing to lose.

[01:01:44] They only have a lot of good will that they can earn

[01:01:47] by doing this stuff.

[01:01:49] Here's the thing about American Pimple, too.

[01:01:50] They haven't taken anyone's new money, right?

[01:01:53] There's no deposit for Houdini.

[01:01:55] I think they understand that they have,

[01:01:57] they're starting out behind the eight ball.

[01:02:00] Like people are not rooting for them,

[01:02:03] they're rooting against them because they hit stuff with J-pop.

[01:02:06] He's still one of the most creative designers out there

[01:02:09] and he always has a shot at redemption simply because

[01:02:14] I think he designs Pimple machines unlike anyone else.

[01:02:18] And when we talk about putting magic into the machine,

[01:02:22] magic, I think he really excelled at giving people

[01:02:27] something they'd never seen before

[01:02:28] and making the ball do stuff that we hadn't seen before.

[01:02:31] And people are still, they're longing for that.

[01:02:34] Like you're not getting that on bat, man.

[01:02:36] Like the ball doesn't anything in Batman

[01:02:38] that hasn't been done before.

[01:02:40] Ghostbusters brought a little bit back with the Magnus links,

[01:02:43] but for the most part, all these new games,

[01:02:45] like Alien, like the tongue comes out and grabs the ball.

[01:02:47] Like these things are not like that original.

[01:02:51] And I think that's what people are missing.

[01:02:52] I mean, I'll even say like when I played Dialed In,

[01:02:55] the magic, I don't know, it's like in the technology,

[01:02:57] but the ball itself, the silver ball,

[01:03:00] is not really doing things or engaging

[01:03:02] with the play field mechanisms in ways that just feel,

[01:03:07] like magic, like it's hard to describe,

[01:03:09] but it's just doing something like,

[01:03:11] how did that happen or how is it doing that?

[01:03:13] Like where the ball go, you know, like all this stuff.

[01:03:15] So we'll see, we'll see, but I wish American pinball luck.

[01:03:21] I think if we're gonna see Magic Girl,

[01:03:22] we're gonna start to see them come out in the next couple months.

[01:03:25] So the next 60 days should be really interesting

[01:03:28] between that and Alien.

[01:03:29] January, February should be an interesting month.

[01:03:32] I hope the year gets off to a good start

[01:03:34] with both of those titles.

[01:03:36] Yeah, and you know, I think you're right.

[01:03:38] January and February are going to be very interesting

[01:03:40] because not only do we have both of those games

[01:03:43] that should be out, but then starts about

[01:03:46] to release Aerosmith, probably at CES in January this month.

[01:03:50] So I mean, we could be looking at three brand new games

[01:03:54] in the next two months.

[01:03:56] So.

[01:03:57] All right, am I missing, I think I'm missing home pin.

[01:03:59] You know, I'm going down the list of people.

[01:04:02] So what's going on with home pin over in China,

[01:04:05] we're getting this whole new company is being built.

[01:04:08] Every, making their own parts,

[01:04:12] all this work is going into creating home pins,

[01:04:17] first ever inaugural pin, which I still think is one

[01:04:20] of the worst themes to come out of the gates

[01:04:22] where the Nats Thunderbirds, I don't know,

[01:04:25] I don't think it's gonna ship in 2017.

[01:04:27] That's all I'm gonna say.

[01:04:27] I think it looks like the building

[01:04:29] an entire company from the ground up in China.

[01:04:32] I think you're not gonna see a game in 2017.

[01:04:35] That's all I want to say about home pin.

[01:04:38] Yeah, can we, I guess we could probably just file

[01:04:42] Thunderbirds under the not gonna care

[01:04:46] about that type of a theme category,

[01:04:47] because really, who cares?

[01:04:50] Who wants a Thunderbirds pinball machine out there?

[01:04:53] I guess some guys in Australia and New Zealand do.

[01:04:56] I honestly had no idea that that theme was

[01:04:59] as big as they say that it is.

[01:05:01] I've always been aware of it since I was a kid,

[01:05:03] but really, that's the theme that you go with

[01:05:07] to launch your company.

[01:05:08] I'm not really sure if that was such a smart idea,

[01:05:12] but hey, if they've got the fan base,

[01:05:15] then more power to them.

[01:05:16] But yeah, they, who knows what kind of quality product

[01:05:20] you're gonna get with machine built in China.

[01:05:22] So that's right.

[01:05:24] Yeah, you know, I give my credit over there.

[01:05:27] I do love his passion and enthusiasm.

[01:05:29] I also love when he goes on pinside

[01:05:31] and just like shoots people down.

[01:05:32] It's kind of funny to read those threads.

[01:05:34] As we go down that list, right?

[01:05:35] There's a lot that could potentially happen in 2017.

[01:05:39] Something that I know everybody unanimously wants

[01:05:42] to see happen in 2017.

[01:05:44] It's like, it's like the only thing everyone can agree on

[01:05:47] is everyone would love to see Kevin Coolick go to jail

[01:05:52] in 2017.

[01:05:54] I don't know.

[01:05:55] I don't know like how this story's gonna end.

[01:05:57] I don't think we're gonna see Kevin behind bars in 2017.

[01:06:02] I think it's so hard to put people away for what he did.

[01:06:06] I don't think so either.

[01:06:07] I mean, let's face it, you know,

[01:06:10] I feel for the people that lost money

[01:06:11] and I think it was a really horrible situation.

[01:06:16] And a really great example of why people shouldn't

[01:06:18] just automatically trust folks.

[01:06:21] Actually, you know, we could do a whole episode on themes

[01:06:23] and the power of a theme.

[01:06:25] And I think that predator certainly a good example

[01:06:27] of that, how many people were willing to buy in on it

[01:06:31] just because of the theme.

[01:06:32] As bad as these crimes are and he did rip a lot of people off,

[01:06:36] if it was so bad he'd be behind bars already, honestly.

[01:06:39] I mean, in the fact that this is just getting dragged out,

[01:06:43] more and more and more.

[01:06:44] And I just don't think anything's gonna happen.

[01:06:47] It just doesn't seem like it.

[01:06:48] You know, he's gonna get sued.

[01:06:51] I guess he's already been sued.

[01:06:52] But, you know, and he may have,

[01:06:54] he's gonna have a lot of financial issues

[01:06:56] probably for the rest of his life.

[01:06:57] But I really don't think he's gonna end up in prison for it.

[01:07:01] Now, I mean, it didn't a day.

[01:07:04] These are like, when you go in to a new company

[01:07:08] that hasn't proven anything,

[01:07:10] you're taking a huge risk and a huge gamble.

[01:07:12] And it's like investing in a startup that, you know,

[01:07:16] it's like, imagine investing in a pharmaceutical company

[01:07:18] and the drug doesn't get approved

[01:07:21] because of some reason.

[01:07:23] X, Y or Z, everyone loses their money.

[01:07:26] His game didn't get approved

[01:07:27] because he didn't have the license.

[01:07:29] Now, what I don't get is why this asshole never returned the money

[01:07:32] or at least some of the money he had when he had the big chunk.

[01:07:35] And he just sort of went and tried to hide it all.

[01:07:38] I mean, but again, look at the guy we're dealing with.

[01:07:40] He dresses like a pirate.

[01:07:41] He's trying to build Predator and his mom's kitchen.

[01:07:44] And this is the guy.

[01:07:45] Like all of a sudden, he went from being a broke bum

[01:07:49] to having $900,000 in his account.

[01:07:52] You think he's gonna give it back?

[01:07:54] No, of course not.

[01:07:55] I mean, I don't doubt that he tried to make the games,

[01:07:58] but he never tried to legally make the games

[01:08:01] in terms of having the right approvals.

[01:08:02] And it was a half-assed effort from the beginning.

[01:08:08] So I wouldn't file it completely under being a scam.

[01:08:12] I think he had the intention of trying to make some machines,

[01:08:15] but just got way in over his head, you know?

[01:08:17] And you're right.

[01:08:19] It was very wrong for him to not try to,

[01:08:23] at least since some of the money back to these people

[01:08:25] that put faith in him to do this stuff

[01:08:28] when he found out that he was way over his head.

[01:08:31] Right.

[01:08:32] Well, that concludes the manufacturers

[01:08:35] and the games coming out.

[01:08:36] But like, is there anything just as we look at the overall

[01:08:40] sort of the vibe that we think will happen

[01:08:43] in the Pimball community in 2017?

[01:08:45] I can kick off what I think will be.

[01:08:47] I think to me, what's gonna continue on in 2017

[01:08:51] is the moaning and groaning about Pimball prices.

[01:08:55] And the same people are gonna cry about it

[01:08:58] and Pimball prices are gonna go up.

[01:09:00] We're not gonna see prices go down.

[01:09:02] And here's why, I don't think Pimball has a long future ahead of it.

[01:09:07] It doesn't.

[01:09:09] As much as people think it does on the, on the pin side,

[01:09:12] the younger generation is growing up

[01:09:15] and they're not gonna collect these things.

[01:09:17] A lot of people who have started collecting Pimball machines

[01:09:20] over the last few years are gonna wake up one day

[01:09:22] and realize that these $10,000 toys, these $8,000 toys

[01:09:26] aren't bringing them the happiness that they once did.

[01:09:30] And they're gonna want to declutter their lives a little bit.

[01:09:32] And then they're gonna realize they're not gonna get $7,900

[01:09:37] for their Game of Thrones Ellie anymore.

[01:09:39] In fact, they might only get like $5,000

[01:09:41] and then they're gonna realize they lost thousands

[01:09:43] on all these toys.

[01:09:45] So I think in 2017, it's gonna be,

[01:09:47] I think it's gonna be the beginning of the stall period

[01:09:52] where you're gonna have so many games coming out.

[01:09:57] The prices are gonna start to get so high

[01:09:59] that I think people are just gonna start to say enough,

[01:10:02] enough is enough a little bit.

[01:10:04] I still think stuff like Star Wars and these games

[01:10:07] that have incredible themes are gonna sell out immediately.

[01:10:10] But I don't think you're gonna see the market

[01:10:15] be able to support a lot of expensive games.

[01:10:19] Like if you have pros and impremiums now

[01:10:23] that are gonna be like $7,800,

[01:10:25] they're not gonna be selling $3,400 or $2,000 anymore.

[01:10:29] So I think we're gonna see a little bit of a stall there.

[01:10:30] But I think for the most part, it's gonna be a great year.

[01:10:33] I do think it's gonna be a great year for pinball.

[01:10:35] And I think it'll be the best year for pinball

[01:10:37] if people just buy a game that they,

[01:10:40] because they love it and stop whining about the money.

[01:10:44] If you're buying a pinball machine,

[01:10:46] you should have excess money.

[01:10:48] This isn't money you use that should be going to bills

[01:10:52] and health issues and education for your kids.

[01:10:56] I talk to people who have loans and other things

[01:10:59] and they're buying pinball machines.

[01:11:00] It's like what?

[01:11:01] What?

[01:11:02] You're just always gonna be angry and cranky

[01:11:04] if you do shit like that.

[01:11:05] So I think 2017 is gonna be a great year for some people.

[01:11:09] The Crybabies will cry,

[01:11:11] but we're gonna see a lot of new titles

[01:11:13] actually come out next year.

[01:11:15] Were they shit, sorry?

[01:11:16] Yeah, I'm optimistic it's gonna be a good year.

[01:11:19] I think we are gonna see a lot of new games this year.

[01:11:21] Of course, when in 2016 thinking that too,

[01:11:24] but I think enough things are far enough along

[01:11:28] that we're gonna see a lot more new stuff this year

[01:11:31] than we did last year.

[01:11:33] I can't agree with you more

[01:11:34] that I really hope that this year brings

[01:11:37] some more positivity back into the hobby.

[01:11:40] I think that there were a lot of things

[01:11:42] that really dragged it down last year.

[01:11:44] And there are always going to be the same people

[01:11:47] that are moaning and groaning about things,

[01:11:49] but I really, really do hope that people look

[01:11:53] at all these new games and feel lucky

[01:11:55] that we have so many options

[01:11:57] and that hopefully these games turn out to be pretty good.

[01:12:00] I think the pricing has gotten absurd.

[01:12:02] You know, I think you and I talked about pricing

[01:12:05] a number of episodes back.

[01:12:06] And I think we both agreed that we knew pricing

[01:12:09] was going to continue to go up over time,

[01:12:12] but even I wasn't expecting it to just skyrocket

[01:12:16] so quickly across multiple companies like it did,

[01:12:20] especially at Expo this past year.

[01:12:22] I mean, the greed is very obvious.

[01:12:26] And at some point, people are gonna put their feet down

[01:12:30] and say, no, we're not buying into this anymore.

[01:12:33] And the companies may say, we'll find, we don't care.

[01:12:36] We're still gonna charge you this much money

[01:12:37] and we'll just make fewer games, you know?

[01:12:40] And then people will say, oh well,

[01:12:42] you're only making that many games.

[01:12:43] I've just got to get in on one of them

[01:12:44] because it's more limited.

[01:12:45] Well, you can't keep feeding the machine,

[01:12:50] no pun intended.

[01:12:53] If you don't like the pricing of things.

[01:12:55] So I really hope people are a little bit more realistic

[01:13:01] with their expectations and they do what they think is right.

[01:13:06] And I wouldn't be surprised if we do see

[01:13:08] fewer people buying new inbox games

[01:13:10] and they start going back to buying some of the great,

[01:13:13] you know, 90s A-list titles and stuff.

[01:13:15] And even those games have come up

[01:13:17] in a value quite a bit as well.

[01:13:18] So I don't see the value of those games dropping,

[01:13:22] but I could see the demand for those games increasing

[01:13:24] if people can't buy new inbox games.

[01:13:26] So at some point the bubble is going to burst

[01:13:30] and I view the prices you're gonna have to come down

[01:13:34] or the companies you're gonna start selling

[01:13:35] a whole lot fewer games.

[01:13:38] Yeah, you know, I try to explain to my friends

[01:13:41] when they ask like, well, why does the world need

[01:13:45] like five, six, seven new PIMM all machines a year?

[01:13:50] Like let's say even say like four.

[01:13:52] We don't need four new inbox options a year

[01:13:58] to satiate the demand that's out there.

[01:14:01] And I think you're right.

[01:14:02] So I think what that means, I think what that means

[01:14:05] is that there are gonna be winners and losers.

[01:14:08] And I think in 2017 we will see some companies fail.

[01:14:11] And if you have to look at the companies

[01:14:13] that are on that bubble that could burst,

[01:14:15] you have to say alien and highway.

[01:14:18] If alien doesn't become super successful, highway could fold.

[01:14:23] If Big Lebowski can't get out faster,

[01:14:26] Dutch could fold easily.

[01:14:28] Yeah.

[01:14:29] You know, I think spooky's fine.

[01:14:30] Spooky's doing everything the right way.

[01:14:32] Spooky has like a dollar rent.

[01:14:35] You know, they pay like the cheapest rent on planet earth

[01:14:37] because the town is supporting them.

[01:14:39] So I think they're gonna be fine.

[01:14:41] JJP's got the backing he needs.

[01:14:43] But if dialed in is a huge failure,

[01:14:47] you have to wonder if they can weather a flop flop.

[01:14:52] But they really haven't had a flop flop.

[01:14:54] They've had issues with getting games out.

[01:14:56] But if they really have something that tanks,

[01:14:59] who knows if, you know, how long the investors will say,

[01:15:01] like, you know what, like, you said this was viable.

[01:15:05] Now our third title is like only selling like a third

[01:15:08] of what our previous title did.

[01:15:10] Like we're going in the wrong direction.

[01:15:12] You need constant growth when you're in new business.

[01:15:14] Stern's gonna be fine.

[01:15:16] I still think Stern's greed makes me feel like they're in this

[01:15:19] for the next five years and they're just gonna cash out.

[01:15:22] I just, they don't seem to give a damn about like,

[01:15:26] I don't know.

[01:15:27] I mean, I feel like they have a momentum right now.

[01:15:32] I think that they've got a momentum

[01:15:34] that they have not had ever since maybe the 90s

[01:15:37] when they were just cranking data east games out, you know,

[01:15:40] every few months.

[01:15:41] Right now, I think that they are putting out

[01:15:45] some of the best overall themed games.

[01:15:48] Not necessarily some people would not agree

[01:15:50] that they're the themes for them,

[01:15:52] but I think that the way that the themes are being handled

[01:15:55] with their machines is the best that they've ever been done

[01:15:59] by the company.

[01:16:00] And I think that they definitely have an up momentum

[01:16:05] to keep cranking out really good games.

[01:16:08] And I think like you said before,

[01:16:11] I think they're here to kind of shut down

[01:16:15] some of these other companies basically.

[01:16:17] And they want to see them off.

[01:16:18] Some of that is good.

[01:16:19] They want it.

[01:16:20] This whole thing that's Gary Stern is not in this

[01:16:25] to like, sink whom by y'all with Andrew Highway.

[01:16:29] These guys are going after each other.

[01:16:31] And Stern can go after any license that they want to.

[01:16:35] That's the thing.

[01:16:37] Whatever these other companies go after, Hobbit, Alien,

[01:16:41] they're table scraps to Stern.

[01:16:44] Stern can get whatever they want first.

[01:16:47] So that's not to say that some of these other companies

[01:16:53] shouldn't have these themes.

[01:16:55] I'm just saying that Stern almost has earned

[01:16:57] the first right of refusal or they've made the decision.

[01:17:01] We're going to focus on these games

[01:17:03] and that leaves X, Y and Z themes open

[01:17:07] for other companies to do only because Stern's not interested

[01:17:10] in them.

[01:17:11] I still think Stern's the leader.

[01:17:12] I think they still make great products.

[01:17:14] And I'm excited for every one of their games that come out.

[01:17:17] But I do have a problem with some of the greed

[01:17:19] that they're clearly showing up.

[01:17:21] Look, I mean, Stern gets so many arrows fired

[01:17:25] into their backs and there are things they do

[01:17:27] that are annoying like the mod issue,

[01:17:31] some of the quality control response that they've done.

[01:17:34] But without Stern, there would be no real pinball

[01:17:39] that's like new in box and there'd be no conversation.

[01:17:41] There'd be nothing to really look forward to

[01:17:44] because if they went away, it would all like go away.

[01:17:49] Absolutely.

[01:17:50] All right, well, so there you have it.

[01:17:53] I mean, I think Blake and I gave a good assessment

[01:17:55] of where we think pinball is going in 2017.

[01:17:59] There are going to be some surprises.

[01:18:01] There are going to be some catastrophes

[01:18:05] and there's going to be some celebratory things

[01:18:07] that happen that we didn't even predict.

[01:18:08] So I know I look forward to it.

[01:18:11] Blake, we will cover stuff as it happens on this podcast,

[01:18:15] on a weekly basis and we will definitely have Blake on again

[01:18:19] to see if some of these predictions come true

[01:18:20] and talk about those things when they occur or don't occur.

[01:18:23] Well, as usual, Chris, thanks for having me on.

[01:18:25] It's always a blast to chat about this stuff

[01:18:28] and stay up to date on it.

[01:18:29] So, you know, like I said, I'm going to be optimistic

[01:18:32] this year and I hope that we have a really phenomenal year

[01:18:36] in pinball and I really am excited to see a lot

[01:18:39] of the new stuff that comes out.

[01:18:40] So regardless of what people think,

[01:18:43] these are still really great times for the hobby

[01:18:45] and for the industry, I think.

[01:18:46] So we can't lose sight of that because people

[01:18:50] being negative about things because they may not get their way.

[01:18:53] Right.

[01:18:54] We're getting so many new games that we haven't gotten

[01:18:57] in decades.

[01:18:59] It's still a really great time.

[01:19:01] Right.

[01:19:02] There's only like 30 people that cry every day on the forum.

[01:19:04] Everyone else really enjoys this hobby every day.

[01:19:07] Well, Blake, I want to-

[01:19:08] This is Pokemon already.

[01:19:09] Yeah, thank you.

[01:19:10] Have a happy new year.

[01:19:11] Happy new year to the listeners out there

[01:19:13] and we'll talk to you guys real soon.

[01:19:15] Canada Blake signing out.
