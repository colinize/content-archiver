[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] Happy Wednesday everybody.

[00:25] I'm super excited to do a show right now.

[00:27] We're going to talk about the Twippies.

[00:29] We're going to talk about Stern Pinball Advertising Stern Pinball, Inside Stern Pinball

[00:33] Machines.

[00:34] We're going to talk about Elton John a little bit.

[00:36] We're going to talk about Chicago Gaming Company.

[00:38] We're going to talk about what's going on in the pinball world.

[00:41] Are we going to throw this game off of the roof of TNT Amusements?

[00:45] I don't know.

[00:46] It's at $1,000.

[00:47] We got $4,000 to go everybody.

[00:50] So let's start out on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast first by saying that Twippy

[00:54] Season has begun.

[00:56] We got the email from this week in Pinball and it's changed a little bit this year.

[01:01] So finally they took some of my advice.

[01:03] I've been saying this like all year.

[01:05] They should start a category for Best New Pinball Content Creator.

[01:10] Now look, they extended it to Best New Pinball Podcast, Best New Pinball Streamer, Best New

[01:15] Pinball YouTube Channel, and maybe even like Best New Pinball website.

[01:19] It's too many.

[01:20] They should have just made it one simple thing.

[01:23] But I am glad they're doing this because think about it.

[01:26] If you're new to pinball and you want to start a media channel and you want to do something

[01:30] in the content space, it's really hard to uproot people who have been doing it for like a decade.

[01:36] So look, do I still think we're going to win favorite pinball podcast?

[01:39] I hope so.

[01:41] And I hope you have your vote.

[01:42] But when it comes to like Best New Pinball Podcast, it opens the door for people like

[01:46] Don and other people out there who have really jumped into the ring.

[01:50] They're brand new.

[01:51] And we both know, like they don't really have a chance of beating someone with a fan base

[01:54] like Canadas, but you got to start somewhere.

[01:57] You got to start somewhere.

[01:58] And I like this move because now every single year it will incentivize new people to make

[02:04] pinball content.

[02:05] And that is a good thing.

[02:07] And I also was talking to Will over at This Week in Pinball and I said, look, if you're

[02:11] going to do Best Pinball Podcast or can I not give that award to whoever wins it considering

[02:16] the fact that I've won it for six years in a row, maybe seven years in a row.

[02:21] And he did let me know.

[02:22] They are considering letting the winner of the category for favorite give the award to

[02:29] the newcomer in the category.

[02:31] Now look, it's not looking good for me because now that Colin and the Kinetis and This Week

[02:36] in Pinball have combined forces and we know how Colin feels about Canada and we also know

[02:41] how Canada feels about Colin.

[02:43] But here's what I'm going to tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:45] I sent a note to Don.

[02:46] I unblocked Colin from my Facebook page because I do believe that life is too short to hold

[02:50] on to any of these grudges and any of this anger in pinball.

[02:54] And I think you have more fun and I have more fun when everyone's just doing their thing

[02:58] and it's more fun when everyone's hanging out on each other's channels and we're just

[03:02] talking about pinball.

[03:03] All right.

[03:04] So let's talk about pinball.

[03:05] Let's talk about this stern code update, which put an advertisement for stern games

[03:10] inside every single one of these games.

[03:12] I want to ask each and every one of you a question.

[03:15] Would you rather have a code update that features an advertisement for the company you've

[03:20] supported that you can turn off in 30 seconds or would you rather have a Jersey Jack game

[03:27] and never get a code update in years?

[03:30] And that's it people.

[03:31] I mean, look, I know people are like really upset about this thing.

[03:34] And yes, should stern have made this the default setting of every single code update where

[03:38] it puts these advertisements in the attract mode of the game?

[03:42] Probably not.

[03:43] I think it was a silly thing to make a default in each code.

[03:46] I think they should have made it so you turn it on because really only operators are going

[03:50] to use this thing.

[03:51] It's also really weird.

[03:52] Like nobody walks up to a pinball machine in a bar or on location and is like, you know

[03:57] what?

[03:58] I really wasn't thinking of spending $6,000 to $13,000 until I saw this really cheesy

[04:03] advertisement for another pinball machine.

[04:05] Like I just don't understand the marketing behind it.

[04:09] And I get that the Bally Williams games used to do this.

[04:11] They would do short little like teasers for other games coming out by Bally Williams.

[04:16] But man, this like stern video is so corny, like the family, like leaning over a machine

[04:21] all cheering.

[04:22] Nobody plays pinball like that.

[04:24] And that's why I think there's somewhat of a reaction to this thing because I really

[04:28] do think when we see stuff like this, I think it telegraphs that stern pinball has lost

[04:33] the narrative a little bit.

[04:35] It almost feels like they don't even understand the category they're in.

[04:38] You know what I'm saying?

[04:39] Like why even put this into the code?

[04:41] Like who is this going to entice to buy a new game?

[04:45] And it's almost like they've got a marketing department that doesn't even know what to do.

[04:49] And they don't even know who they're talking to.

[04:50] Like I would love to sit down with Stern and say, what do you think this little advertisement

[04:56] is going to do?

[04:57] Like who is it going to incentivize?

[04:59] And who are you even trying to reach?

[05:01] You know, because it really makes no sense.

[05:03] Because if you're on location, you're not even going to be able to hear the audio on

[05:07] this advertisement.

[05:09] And then you've got these like thousands and thousands and thousands of home collectors

[05:13] who don't want you to stick an advertisement for stern pinball into their stern pinball machine.

[05:19] And they really should have just started out by giving the owners the choice to turn it on.

[05:23] And that's that.

[05:24] No one's going to talk about this thing like a day from now.

[05:26] But let's talk about the good news.

[05:28] Stern Pinball updating 22 freaking games at once.

[05:34] Holy holiday, Stern Pinball.

[05:35] What a move by this company.

[05:37] And some of these games got real significant code updates, which is awesome.

[05:42] And the other thing, you know, I was popping around the Elvira thread and stern pinball,

[05:45] what I like about them is they listened to the feedback.

[05:49] Like they made some changes on the previous Elvira code and then they went and they heard

[05:54] the feedback and they made other adjustments.

[05:57] I really do get the sense that Stern Pinball is really trying hard to make each and every

[06:02] one of these games as good as they can possibly make them.

[06:06] And Stern has invested so heavily in the software department.

[06:09] And we know this.

[06:10] Like if you can really nail the software on a game, you can give people something that

[06:15] they will hold on to forever.

[06:17] You know, some games never get the software treatment they deserve.

[06:21] And then I think about the Jersey Jack owners and they get nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing.

[06:27] Every single person who owns a guns and roses, there is a plethora of feedback on how Jersey

[06:33] Jack within the existing game could make the game so much more enjoyable for those people

[06:39] who own the machine.

[06:40] And they've done absolutely nothing in three years.

[06:44] You know, that's just it.

[06:45] As much as I still feel we're getting ripped off by Stern Pinball, I really do.

[06:48] I still think a stern bomb is like 4,500 bucks.

[06:52] And we're literally spending $13,000 on something that costs them 3,500.

[06:57] But at least they go the distance with their games.

[07:01] At least they have teams of software engineers that are trying to make these games amazing.

[07:05] And I just don't get that sense that that is happening over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:10] All right, so what else is happening over at Stern?

[07:12] So I'm hearing that stranger things premiums are not on the line yet and they might be delayed

[07:17] until January.

[07:18] I don't have full confirmation on that, but I heard they might be waiting on parts.

[07:23] And so if that is the case, do we think we're going to see Jaws Pinball in December of this

[07:29] year?

[07:30] I'm starting to think Jaws might be early 2024.

[07:34] I think it might be a January reveal.

[07:37] Reveal it in January, get it on the line in February, and then have it everywhere in March

[07:42] and April going into the spring and summer.

[07:45] Stern knows that whenever they launch this game, it's going to be a sales phenomenon.

[07:49] I really do believe it is.

[07:51] I think the last couple of years across the board, across the entire industry, there really

[07:56] hasn't been something that's really won people over the way Godzilla did.

[08:01] And look, here we go.

[08:02] The guy who did Godzilla is going to do Jaws.

[08:05] Now look, we know Jaws is not going to have the assets the way Godzilla did, and that's

[08:09] going to be the big question mark on this game.

[08:12] It actually makes me happy though to see that Jurassic Park 30th and Elvira, the blood kiss

[08:18] edition, neither of those two games have sold out.

[08:22] I get happy when I see that.

[08:23] It means that Stern's like FOMO attempts haven't really succeeded.

[08:28] If I were a betting man, I bet they sold more Elvira's than Jurassic Park.

[08:32] For two reasons.

[08:33] I think the Elvira looks better.

[08:36] And the other reason is this.

[08:37] I think Elvira's a better game.

[08:40] I really do.

[08:41] I've been in both threads and I hear nothing but good things about Elvira.

[08:45] If there's one game I'm really curious to play and get into the code and understand

[08:50] what Lyman was going for, it's Elvira.

[08:53] It is one of these games I've never really put a lot of time on an Elvira machine.

[08:59] But man, I know Lyman Sheets was the best coder in the history of Pimball.

[09:03] I saw what he did with Batman 66 and I can only imagine what a game like Elvira must

[09:08] be like because Elvira's a much better shooting game than Batman.

[09:13] It's got a, I think it's got better mechanisms than Batman.

[09:17] I don't think the theme is as strong as Batman.

[09:20] I mean, Batman is Batman people.

[09:21] It's a much stronger property than Elvira.

[09:24] But man, Elvira is not a game that's without assets.

[09:27] It's got a ton of assets and the way they arrange the assets in Elvira is super cool.

[09:32] It's really hard being an outsider looking into the Elvira fans and the owners because

[09:37] I have no idea what they're talking about when they talk about these different modes

[09:41] that are based on these cheesy movies.

[09:44] I have no idea what they're talking about.

[09:46] It's a lot easier to talk about, oh, you battle Mr. Freeze and then that freezes the

[09:51] timer when you get into future modes and then you get into Bat Tuzi mode and then all the

[09:55] villains escape.

[09:56] Like I have no idea the context of what's happening in Elvira.

[10:01] But I want to find out one day, if there's anyone in the New York City area that has

[10:04] an Elvira machine, I would love to swing by and just spend like a few hours playing the

[10:09] game and understanding the rules.

[10:11] All right, what else is happening in the world of Pimball?

[10:14] The game that nobody ordered, Spinal Tap, is now shipping to its distributors.

[10:19] For this game, it was like revealed a year ago and now Homepin's Spinal Tap is making

[10:24] its way to customers and to distributors.

[10:28] I'm curious to see who would actually buy this game, let alone unbox it.

[10:32] It's just surprising to me that Homepin is still in business.

[10:35] I don't even know who's buying these games.

[10:37] All right, what else is going on in Pimball?

[10:39] So we are now in mid-November.

[10:42] There are no pulp fictions on the line.

[10:44] I'm in the CGC thread.

[10:46] I saw they sent to a customer a Cactus Canyon LE.

[10:49] Now people who ordered this LE have waited almost two and a half years for the game.

[10:55] This guy unboxes his machine and the back box was all damaged on the inside, which means

[11:00] it did not happen during shipping.

[11:03] And he noticed that CGC used a black Sharpie marker to color where the damage occurred.

[11:10] He quickly filed a ticket and they're going to send them a new back box.

[11:13] But man, what a hassle.

[11:15] How annoyed would you be if you spent $10,000 on something and the company should have caught

[11:20] that at the factory and we know they did catch it at the factory because they used a freaking

[11:26] black Sharpie marker to try to hide the damage.

[11:29] So look, I know CGC builds a great product, but this is also indicative of they might be

[11:35] rushing things now.

[11:37] They might be under some pressure.

[11:38] I don't know, just a really sloppy mistake.

[11:41] I also think that they've been making games that are a lot more complex than Pulp Fiction.

[11:46] I think once Pulp Fiction gets on the line at CGC, these things are going to fly out

[11:50] the door.

[11:51] I think they're going to be able to make these things so easily.

[11:54] I think the line workers are going to be so excited.

[11:56] They're making a single level game.

[11:58] And I really hope we start to see Pulp Fiction's and Pulp Fiction LE's into hands of consumers

[12:03] by like March of 2024.

[12:05] I'll tell you this, the game is still red hot.

[12:07] If you go on the pin side marketplace, guess how many Pulp Fiction LE's are for sale if

[12:13] you wanted to buy one of those bad mofo editions of the game.

[12:17] Zero.

[12:18] There are zero for sale.

[12:19] There's only one guy that's willing to trade for a big Lebowski, which is easily a $14,000

[12:26] game or more.

[12:27] So this guy is trying to make a $4,000 profit.

[12:29] So he's not going to get that right now.

[12:32] But it just goes to show you the power of a theme like Pulp Fiction.

[12:35] You can't even freaking find one.

[12:37] Right now there's like what?

[12:38] Was it 1,250 people or 1,000 people are sitting on deposits for one and nobody's even willing

[12:44] to flip it right now?

[12:45] Once the game comes out, I think the prices are going to get even higher.

[12:49] And the only reason why Pulp Fiction will sell for more than it was new is that it was priced

[12:53] properly.

[12:54] We need a game where it's limited and it's the right price.

[12:57] Way more people want it than they priced it at.

[13:00] Way more people want this game than they're going to make.

[13:03] That's how it works.

[13:04] And that value should be passed on to the customer.

[13:07] Do you know who invented Ellie's and Pinball?

[13:10] This might surprise you.

[13:12] The man who invented limited edition versions of machines, and I know like there was some

[13:17] stuff back in the day like Adam's Family Gold and stuff like that.

[13:21] But the person who really introduced like Stern Pinball to the Ellie model was no other

[13:26] than Jack Guinari.

[13:28] So way back in the day, Jack Guinari introduced like making a limited version of a game that

[13:34] was different, that had a different color armor that had signatures on the game.

[13:39] He did it with Monopoly Platinum Edition.

[13:41] He was behind like Elvis Gold Edition, Austin Powers Gold Edition in which they only made

[13:47] 10 machines.

[13:48] He was behind Terminator Platinum Edition where Steve Richie signed the machine.

[13:52] So Jack Guinari himself is somewhat the father of limited edition machines, which even makes

[13:58] it sadder that he's kind of forgotten what it actually takes to make a game special and

[14:03] limited.

[14:04] It's not Elton John at 1000 units for 15 freaking thousand dollars.

[14:09] I still can't get over every time I see Elton John how beautiful the Ellie version of that

[14:14] game is.

[14:15] Franchi just killed it.

[14:17] I actually think Franchi might win for best art package in a pinball machine simply because

[14:23] of how beautiful Elton John looks.

[14:26] It's going to be tough though because zombie yeti on Foo Fighters is absolutely amazing

[14:31] and way more people own Foo Fighters and love Foo Fighters than will ever have owned and

[14:36] love Elton John.

[14:38] And it's a popular vote so we'll see what happens.

[14:40] I mean not to mention yeti's work on Venom but again Venom is kind of like a sales dud

[14:44] so there's not going to be nearly as many people that want to see Venom win anything

[14:49] when it comes to the Twippies.

[14:50] So Jack Guinari the father of the Ellie.

[14:53] All right what else is going on in pinball?

[14:56] So this is interesting news.

[14:57] This is actually really big news because David Thiel came out himself and said that Jersey

[15:03] Jack Pinball approached him recently on one of their recent titles and because they couldn't

[15:09] sync up their schedules he did not join the project but he's open to rejoining Jersey

[15:16] Jack Pinball on future projects.

[15:19] I've heard some stories that are a little bit different than that but look David's always

[15:23] going to keep the door open to working with everybody and why wouldn't he?

[15:27] He's basically like a freelance person who will go work for anybody.

[15:30] You know we never really asked how much money do you think David Thiel made at Deeproot

[15:35] Pinball?

[15:36] Who's Robert Mueller paying this guy for like three years to work on sound packages for

[15:41] games that never came out?

[15:43] It's all sad now thinking about all those people because we now know that all that money

[15:48] was basically stolen from like old women to pay the salaries of like Steve Bowden and

[15:54] David Thiel and Robert's buying like apartments in Hawaii and he's going on vacations and

[16:00] he's dipping into all that money which was supposed to be invested in something else.

[16:05] It's terrible, the whole thing is terrible and if we throw any game off the roof of TNT

[16:09] amusements it should be all those Raza machines.

[16:12] I'm sorry like get rid of them, burn them.

[16:14] I don't know what Turner Pinball is doing holding on to those things.

[16:17] I was thinking too like if David Thiel comes back to Jersey Jack I was thinking about it

[16:22] like you know how like there's code updates and you update the rules and other things

[16:26] in games wouldn't it be amazing if David went back and fixed all the crappy sound packages

[16:32] that have been on the recent Jersey Jack machines?

[16:35] To remove all the crappy slot machine music maybe even re-record the voice overs on games

[16:40] like Elton John?

[16:42] Is it too late to do that?

[16:44] I don't think so.

[16:45] Like why is it too late to do that?

[16:47] Is it too late to fix the weak flippers on all of those previous games?

[16:51] Jersey Jack needs to make a move.

[16:53] They need to make a move like Elton John is not selling well.

[16:57] I saw some distributor be like oh yeah it's selling nice and steady.

[17:00] No it's not.

[17:01] I've talked to some of JJP's biggest distributors.

[17:04] The CEs are selling alright but nobody's buying the LE again and everybody knows the

[17:10] moment you unbox this game.

[17:12] It's not that it's not going to be JJP's best shooting game.

[17:15] The moment you unbox it you're going to lose $3,000.

[17:19] I mean look I would happily buy an Elton John LE one day for like eight grand and that's

[17:24] what it's going to be.

[17:25] It's going to go lower than Guns N' Roses unless the Abbas family gets pissed off and

[17:30] says hey we're never making anymore.

[17:31] That's the only thing that's going to keep the value in these games.

[17:34] Alright what else is going on in the pinball world?

[17:36] I want to say congratulations to the Dutch Pinball Museum.

[17:40] They are expanding their operation.

[17:43] They have more square footage, more games, more opportunities to bring in newbies into

[17:48] pinball to jack up the prices of pinball machines.

[17:51] No, it's always funny when we talk about pinball.

[17:53] Like we're expanding this hobby as if it's something that is really needed.

[17:57] As if it's something that the world needs more of.

[17:59] We need to expand pinball.

[18:01] All we're going to do at this point, if we bring more people into pinball, we're just

[18:06] going to screw ourselves.

[18:09] These newbies are going to spend so much money because they don't realize what these machines

[18:14] should cost.

[18:15] So I don't know.

[18:16] I think pinball is just fine.

[18:17] I don't really feel like we need to expand pinball and there's no way the majority of

[18:21] young kids are going to get into pinball.

[18:23] This resurgence in pinball will not last forever.

[18:26] And they'll never fully go away.

[18:28] I think there's always going to be a few pinball companies making games forever because there's

[18:32] just nothing you can replace it with.

[18:34] You can't digitize pinball.

[18:36] People stop listening to the radio if they have a Walkman.

[18:39] People started streaming music and didn't need CDs, but nothing's going to put pinball

[18:44] out of business.

[18:45] The only thing that can put a pinball company out of business is the company itself making

[18:49] boneheaded moves.

[18:51] You know, I speaking of boneheaded company moves, I saw the American Pinball Tour.

[18:55] He listened to David Fix.

[18:57] He said they wanted to make 300 galactic tank forces by the end of the year.

[19:01] Do you think they sold that many?

[19:03] He also says they have 200 Houdinis that have been ordered that they are making.

[19:08] Who in their right mind would order a new in box Houdini when you can get one for like

[19:13] $2,000 off on Pinside today?

[19:16] It's so weird.

[19:17] Are there just people out there that really value cardboard boxes?

[19:20] Oh, it's going to be interesting.

[19:22] All right, everybody.

[19:23] Look, have a great hump day.

[19:24] Have a great Wednesday.

[19:26] We will be back.

[19:27] I'm going to do my Twippy episode where I predict which games I think are going to win

[19:30] and who I think is going to win in each category.

[19:33] The only thing with the Twippies every year, you know, you get excited and then you realize

[19:37] like, oh, we're going to find out who won four months from now.

[19:40] It's like well into 2024.

[19:42] And by the time we start awarding games like Foo Fighters and James Bond and Pulp Fiction,

[19:47] by the time we get around to it, like Jaws is going to be out and everyone's just going

[19:51] to be talking about the new stuff and not care about the old stuff.

[19:55] They've got to figure out a way to get this damn award show in January.

[19:59] Everybody, be good.

[20:00] We'll talk to you soon.

[20:01] Thank you for the support.

[20:02] We have reached a new milestone.

[20:04] We're at 655 subscribers who are paying money.

[20:08] And then there's like another 40 or so that are just hanging out for free.

[20:11] But just remember, everybody, they don't get to listen to any of this.

[20:14] So only if you really subscribe do you get Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[20:17] Peace out.

[20:18] Thank you.
