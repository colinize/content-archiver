[00:00] With the fuck you take me for a joke, you smoke and crack for I do that, I beg my riot, it take me back

[00:05] I get up for I get down, run myself in the ground, for I put some wax it out

[00:10] I'm trying to smack this one out the park, 5,000 more, y'all steady, run a drown this y'all

[00:15] They gonna do nothing but piss me off

[00:17] You know, for those of you who have listened to this show who don't understand the context

[00:30] of the character canada and by that I don't mean me canada, I mean the catashiro-otomo character

[00:38] of canada from the anime Akira, I want to explain you real quick like why I call myself canada

[00:44] and why I call this canada's pinball podcast and why my online persona has always been canada

[00:51] on every single form I've been on

[00:53] It's quite simply that canada is a character that is a little bit rebellious, probably very rebellious

[01:00] He's a youthful motorcycle riding badass who just doesn't give a shit what people think

[01:08] and he's trying to save his friend Tetsuo from neo-tokio experiments that have turned him into a monster

[01:18] All right, but ultimately underneath at all

[01:20] He's a good guy that's just trying to save the world

[01:24] And sometimes I feel like I have this responsibility

[01:29] to the pinball community in the pinball world to try and just speak the truth and let you guys know

[01:36] What is actually going on underneath all of the bullshit that is on the forums that people talk that other podcasts are saying

[01:46] And get to the actual core of the thing and on this episode of canada's pinball podcast

[01:52] It's going to be one of those episodes where

[01:55] I try to get to the core of some issues and I'm getting to it at 452 in the morning so you know

[02:02] You know this is going to be one of those special editions of canada's pinball podcast

[02:07] Where I don't even hold back I just I'm just going to tell you exactly how I feel

[02:13] And exactly the situation as it is in the world there's going to be no sugar coating here

[02:19] This is going to ruffle some feathers. This is going to piss some people off

[02:23] I might lose some listeners after this episode, but I don't care

[02:27] I don't care. I'll tell you why because we all only live once

[02:32] And pinball is probably the dumbest thing on the planet

[02:37] To get obsessive about it means absolutely nothing in the real world

[02:42] It doesn't this is like this is

[02:45] This is pandora. This is fantasy world. This is

[02:49] You know the oasis if you will this is not real. It's just a box

[02:56] With lights and mechanisms and toys

[03:01] For adults it's not necessary. Okay, that being said let me jump right in so today

[03:08] We got a webinar from our friends at deeproot pinball

[03:14] That explained the entire goodwill terms and conditions there offerings it wear customers now

[03:21] I'm not going to go into it in depth

[03:24] Okay, I'm not gonna it's 30 minutes. Okay, I was joking to friends that it is 30 minutes of your life

[03:32] That you will never get back. Okay, but look

[03:37] I'm gonna do something and I'm gonna

[03:39] I'm gonna say something that's not gonna be very popular

[03:43] But before I do that I want to I want you guys to hear

[03:47] The end section of Robert Mueller's discussion about what they're gonna do for a zidware customer

[03:55] Because I think they actually called this podcast out and this is probably one of the lamest

[04:04] Reasons why this company would reject your claim

[04:08] To be made whole if you were a zidware customer. I want you to listen to what Robert Mueller says

[04:14] Are the terms and conditions in which they may deny a claim and also the terms and conditions in which they need to accept a claim if you are a zidware customer

[04:24] Listen to this guy speak right here. What proof do you have to submit? Well at a minimum we need some demonstrable evidence that you actually had

[04:31] A an agreement with john to purchase a game and that you actually paid

[04:36] The specific amount of money

[04:39] And whatever form to john

[04:41] We know that might be hard for some people, but unfortunately we have to draw the line somewhere

[04:47] And be reasonable that if you

[04:50] Feel that you have a claim you need to have some evidence to back that up

[04:54] So that is not only that you enter into an agreement, but that you paid money

[04:58] Also that you have not yet received your game or if you've received it

[05:01] You haven't sold or assigned it

[05:03] And last uh, but but I think most importantly that you haven't

[05:07] Basically poo-pooed on the whole process, but still trying to get benefits

[05:12] That's just not fair to everyone else

[05:13] So if you've defamed us or the process and public communication on pinside or podcast or otherwise

[05:19] Then we will make a decision internally whether or not to approve or deny your claim

[05:25] See Robert and I know you listen to this podcast the problem with everything you just said is you're making the biggest mistake

[05:33] And I'll tell you why because you failed to understand the situation that zidware buyers are in you are looking through this

[05:43] Through the lens of john poppadook and you are simply looking at it all wrong

[05:48] I want to ask you a question Robert. You're a very successful businessman

[05:53] You made a lot of money right doing other things in the world

[05:56] If you gave your hard earned money to

[06:00] John poppadook five years ago and didn't get your product if you were lied to if you're if you're pimp on machine never arrived

[06:09] How would you feel after five years of being manipulated lied to false promises

[06:18] Would you say nice things about the process would you or would you poo poo as you put it on the process and the fact that

[06:27] You are going to deny people

[06:31] They're claim if they come on a podcast or go on to pinside and say

[06:36] Screw john screw deep root like this guy took my money five years ago and gave me nothing is absolutely ridiculous

[06:44] Okay, it is ridiculous and I think you're smarter than that

[06:48] And I think you need to start waking up to the reality of who you're in bed with and I'm not saying this because I think you're going to fail at your venture

[06:58] I think you have a lot of obstacles to overcome

[07:00] But I think you need to stop and think about what you're trying to do because what you're asking for right there is censorship

[07:08] You don't want people to say how they really feel

[07:13] Why can't somebody who got burned by john poppadook poo poo

[07:18] Him and your deep root

[07:20] Process why why should they be denied?

[07:24] They gave the man their money. It doesn't matter what they feel

[07:28] It doesn't matter what they think it doesn't matter, you know what they say they paid for a product

[07:36] Robert you don't get it they paid for something give them what they paid for

[07:43] You can't now ask them to be a cheerleader for you

[07:47] When they got burned by this dude for five years. It's it's like pull my hair out. Aren't you smarter than this?

[07:54] Okay

[07:55] The other part of this whole thing if you listen to the beginning of what Robert says in that clip

[08:00] I played you is now the onus is on the buyer

[08:06] To prove that they

[08:09] Didn't get what they received from john now if Robert wants to have revisionist history

[08:17] And and make john the victim here and all the buyers now are the defendants

[08:23] That's on him, but the reality is this Robert listen up your boy

[08:30] John poppadook

[08:32] He entered into a lot of agreements with people

[08:36] With verbal agreements with handshakes with promises of games to people

[08:42] He didn't keep records. He didn't keep books

[08:47] He basically gave people like fairy dust agreements and sent them like receipts that were this like ridiculous

[08:57] Gobbly gook and now you're asking people who he burned who he

[09:03] Like wronged it's on them to prove

[09:08] That john owes them something okay, so let me give you an example Robert and this is the most important example of them all

[09:18] John promised

[09:20] Jeremy Packer a machine

[09:24] For his work, okay, Jeremy Packer got screwed when American pinball made their magic girls

[09:30] We all know the story he never got his machine

[09:34] But Jeremy Packer

[09:36] doesn't have

[09:38] A piece of paper he doesn't have a receipt from john poppadook

[09:44] Because john poppadook was a smooth talker and he basically got a lot of people to do a lot of work for him

[09:51] Without any sort of documentation

[09:55] And so what does Jeremy Packer do now?

[09:57] What is he show you Robert to prove to you that he deserves a game

[10:03] Now I think Jeremy Packer is doing the right thing and he's not like playing ball

[10:07] He's not jumping into this new venture

[10:10] enthusiastically

[10:12] He's not going to sell out like like apple juice did for 10 grand and just call it a day

[10:18] He's not

[10:20] So look the bottom line is this

[10:23] I listen to all 30 minutes of this webinar

[10:27] 30 minutes of all the different scenarios like if you have a magic girl you get this

[10:34] You know, it's you know, it's crazy. I sold my magic girl to somebody. So I'm out. I'm out

[10:41] But people who bought a magic girl from an original zidware buyer like I bought

[10:48] Kymichel's magic girl

[10:50] What happens then is that the people who bought it second hand

[10:55] Those people are kind of fucked. They get nothing from deeproot

[11:01] It's funny right because

[11:03] Deeproot considers Kymichel made whole because I bought his game, okay?

[11:08] But then what what about me? What about me who now possesses this super expensive machine that doesn't work?

[11:14] Well, you're screwed. Sorry

[11:17] Sorry, but think about my scenario and I'm out. So it's not it I don't really carry more but think about my scenario

[11:25] I bought Kim Mitchell's machine before I knew that magic girl didn't work

[11:32] I fully expected when I paid 23,000 dollars to get a fully functioning amazing magical pinball machine from John

[11:41] Poppiduke I opened up the box and the game didn't work

[11:46] Okay, so doesn't John poppiduke owe me something

[11:51] Even though I bought it second hand doesn't he owe me a working magic girl

[11:56] Okay, and that is the problem with deep roots whole goodwill

[12:02] initiative is it's not taking into consideration the domino effect of all the people that John poppiduke has screwed over

[12:13] It goes far deeper the rabbit hole goes far deeper than anything Robert Mueller can imagine

[12:20] All right

[12:21] What about all the vendors all the people that did work for John who were promised games they don't have

[12:28] Documentation Robert so they're you're gonna get phone calls from people who say hey

[12:33] I did all the play field screening for John and he promised me like three games

[12:39] Over the phone. What are you gonna do to those people you're gonna go back to John as he's like well Robert, you know

[12:45] I don't know about that guy like it's gonna be a nightmare for them to figure out all of the people

[12:53] That John screwed over and the list goes so much deeper than people realize okay now look

[13:01] Look the other part of all of this and and and you could just like scratch your head at the conditions and the goodwill offer

[13:10] It's like if you went in on every game they're gonna give you three games

[13:17] Um, I think for the price of like 14,500 dollars is the totality of if you went in on all John poppiduke's games

[13:25] So roughly around five thousand dollars a game is what they're gonna offer you as credit now

[13:34] They haven't told us yet

[13:37] What they're going to price their versions of magic girl rosa and Alice in wonderland at

[13:45] But five thousand dollars like John was selling magic girl for sixteen thousand dollars

[13:52] And rosa was ten thousand dollars. So you know, how are these guys making these games at such a cheap cost

[14:01] I mean it's it's head scratching

[14:04] All right, but the other part too all right and I listen to it all and again like

[14:09] If you're curious, I would listen to it the other part is this if you are a plaintiff

[14:14] suing John poppiduke okay suing the man who took your money and gave you nothing

[14:20] If you are one of the plaintiffs and you don't accept the

[14:25] Deeproot terms and conditions you get nothing okay now

[14:30] When you step back and look at what Robert Mueller is doing here. It's it's very simple what he's doing

[14:36] He is trying to strong-armed people with threats to drop their lawsuit against John poppiduke

[14:43] He also goes on to say that John poppiduke has no money. There are zero assets left in zidware

[14:50] So think about that for a minute John burned through

[14:53] 1.2 million dollars of people's money and never delivered anything okay

[14:59] But he's painting John as a victim and this is my other problem with Robert and Deeproot is John is now the victim

[15:05] Who has no money? So please leave him alone do not sue him let him go let him off the hook

[15:10] Okay, he's trying that's number one like he's trying to like make plaintiffs plaintiffs give up their case

[15:18] The other thing is he's basically

[15:21] Victimizing John that's number two like John is this

[15:25] Creature that he's protecting and he needs you to let him go so he can go do his thing

[15:31] The other part that Robert Mueller did that just shows me that he has learned nothing nothing

[15:40] From the pimpball industry is he made the cardinal sin the number one mistake that all pimpball manufacturers have made

[15:49] Over the last five years that I've been following this hobby. He made the biggest mistake ever

[15:55] And that mistake is that he gave a delivery date

[15:59] He gave a delivery date of

[16:02] June 30th

[16:04] 2019 that is the date by legally they are bound to deliver your multiple games

[16:14] um

[16:15] Of zidware for zidware customers and they haven't specified which titles they will be but he has said time and time again

[16:22] It will be multiple titles that will be delivered by that date

[16:27] That is 18 months from now roughly a year and a half

[16:31] Uh that they are now going to have games shipping. Okay, so here's the thing

[16:36] Why Robert would you put a date out there?

[16:41] Have you built a machine? Do you have working magic girls and razas and Alice in wonderlands?

[16:50] That you are so confident that you'll be able to manufacture and get these things to people by that date

[16:57] Now if you do

[16:58] God bless you

[17:00] I know you're offering people to go on this like

[17:03] Torre of the facility to see the progress and I've said it and I'll say it again Robert

[17:08] If you figure this thing out if you unravel the mystery of john popadoo

[17:13] I will happily buy the games. Okay, well you're gonna stop me can wait

[17:18] I wonder if robert's like a new terming condition of deeproot pinball is if you have said anything negative about us in the past

[17:24] We will not allow you to buy our games. Sorry, but you've poo pooed the process

[17:30] Robert Mueller deeproot

[17:32] Come on robert enough with the shenanigans and like the legal speak and honestly

[17:38] I don't think there's a person out there that doesn't listen to this webinar and say

[17:44] This is the worst way to launch a pinball company. You are launching a pinball company

[17:50] With a 30-minute

[17:52] Sort of webinar of legal speak mumbo jumbo goblygook about how you're going to

[18:01] Make hole, but not really make holes did wear customers. I mean, I was right. I reported this correctly

[18:08] That you are only giving people 50 cents to the dollar on what they gave john popadoo

[18:16] So that's not making people whole it's giving them something. I agree with that

[18:21] It's better than nothing. I agree with that, but you're not making them whole

[18:27] Okay, they they're you're just not and and and it's not good will

[18:33] All of this is a little bit of a threat

[18:37] It's either our way or the highway, but we're gonna package it up

[18:43] In this way that tries to make us look like the good guys like good will like you're you're you might label it these things

[18:50] But it's not good will

[18:53] This is like a take it or leave it agreement all right

[18:58] Okay, now look this podcast is about to take a significant

[19:04] detour

[19:05] Into another thing I want to say about this whole situation because

[19:11] after listening to the webinar and after hearing all of robert's terms and conditions and after

[19:18] Thinking about it for a night

[19:21] I asked myself one question and that question is why

[19:26] Why are they doing this?

[19:28] Why is deep root pimbal so invested in john popadoo

[19:35] And so adamant

[19:37] About figuring out a way to work with john popadoo and I think all of us

[19:43] You know as much as we're angry as much as we despise the man for what he did

[19:49] I think

[19:51] Every intelligent person needs to step back and say why

[19:55] Always start with the why?

[19:58] Why are they doing this?

[20:00] And I've been racking my brain about this for weeks thinking about it

[20:05] And I I came to a conclusion that might upset some of you but the conclusion I came to is very simply this

[20:14] That john popadoo is worth it

[20:18] Okay, I'll tell you why

[20:21] John popadoo is the worst businessman on the planet

[20:25] But when it comes to pinball talent okay, just pinball talent

[20:30] John popadoo brings something to pinball that nobody else does

[20:37] And and and what he brings okay, he's he's a lunatic. He's a mad scientist

[20:43] He's out of his out of his noggin

[20:46] He you talk to the man. He'll talk to you for hours. He'll talk your head off

[20:50] He's absolutely insane

[20:52] But when it comes to pinball design okay when it comes to design designing a pinball machine

[20:59] An art directing a pinball machine

[21:01] John popadoo is a genius okay, and look

[21:06] There's no denying it

[21:08] He understands something about pinball

[21:12] He brings something to pinball that nobody else does

[21:17] That nobody since him has done that nobody during the whole zidware error has been able to replicate

[21:24] John popadoo is able to throw something onto a pinball machine

[21:30] That makes you go wow

[21:34] And that is why okay, that is why as disgusted as I am

[21:39] With deep roots approach with deep roots hole like

[21:43] signing up of all the expendable people like Dennis Nornman and Barrio and John Norse all those guys are throw away guys to me

[21:51] They're throw away

[21:53] They're all just

[21:55] cover for the real valuable

[22:00] Entity there which is John popadoo and and he is the whole reason why

[22:06] Robert Mueller

[22:07] Wanted to make deep root if you remember when zidware was collapsing

[22:12] Robert was part of the conversation years ago

[22:16] To to make things right and look i'll say this and i know this is not popular

[22:24] If i'm to be honest with myself

[22:28] John popadoo's magic girl still to this day is the most stunning pinball machine

[22:34] I have ever seen if i really could wish one pinball machine to actually work because it's such a work of art

[22:42] It's magic girl

[22:44] All right, I didn't want to sell it. I didn't want to get rid of it

[22:47] I just couldn't own it because it played like shit

[22:51] But when you look at a magic girl and you put it next to everything else that has come out in the last five years

[22:58] It's not even in the same level

[23:01] Or on the same level as anything else out there

[23:05] It makes everything else look like shit everything

[23:09] No, no, yeah, that's the irony is it like it's all looks with nothing. It's all

[23:14] It's all appearance with no substance and i get that which is why i'm like

[23:19] I'm so curious as to how these gentlemen are gonna actually make the game work

[23:26] Because it's the things are there

[23:30] But how are you gonna make that that whole center mechanism work

[23:34] Will they figure it out or will they strip out the things that made it look magical and give us a bare bones machine

[23:42] But all that is besides my point

[23:45] My point is this

[23:48] John popadook

[23:49] Is a pinball

[23:51] genius

[23:52] mad scientist lunatic

[23:55] Who like

[23:56] Lubbimer haitom

[23:57] All right lose money or like what not

[24:01] The man

[24:02] Has a way with pinball and a way with artists that nobody else does

[24:09] An example of this

[24:10] Look at John popadook

[24:12] Look at what his results were when he are directed mat andrues

[24:17] Okay, look what he got out of mat andrues with the cabinet artworks for magic girl and and raza

[24:26] Look at what he got out of mat andrues for the playfield and cabinets of the original Houdini design

[24:34] And then look at what mat andrues delivered for total nuclear annihilation same artist different art director

[24:43] Scott denisi art directed mat andrues for total nuclear annihilation

[24:49] John popadook art directed mat andrues for

[24:53] All the zidware games at mat work dawn look at the difference and that is why John popadook is valuable

[25:01] That is his greatest quality

[25:04] Is John popadook can look at a blank playfield a blank cabinet and create something

[25:13] And put something there that is absolutely

[25:16] Amazing and he can work with artists to direct them to make it so now look

[25:23] I know a lot of you are like Chris what the fuck are you doing you are like

[25:28] Supporting this guy that you have been so opposed to and I'm still opposed to John popadook the businessman

[25:35] I'm still opposed to John popadook's zidware ventures

[25:39] um

[25:40] But look there is no prettier machine in all of pinball

[25:45] There is no more

[25:46] Take my money now

[25:48] I need to put this in my apartment

[25:51] Then John popadook and Jeremy packers

[25:55] Alice in wonderland now if you go look at Alice in wonderland all right

[26:00] That is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in the history of pinball

[26:05] I know it's just foam core. I know it's just black and white artwork

[26:10] But I have never seen something so incredible in pinball from an artistic and design standpoint

[26:18] I don't even care like how intricate the game is and that was John's problem

[26:24] He didn't need the games to be that intricate

[26:28] He just needed them to shoot well

[26:31] Be fun and be covered in a world of art and lights and sound and he would have been just fine

[26:39] All right

[26:40] But that is that's the reality people all of this deep route nonsense

[26:46] All of these people in a room with a photograph the expendables as I called them

[26:51] They're all just smoke and mirrors

[26:54] To get you to feel better about one man in that picture the man in that picture

[27:00] You can't barely see his faces have covered but that one man has more

[27:07] Talent in him than all of those men in that room and then the reason why I say that the reason why I say that is

[27:16] Is that John pop a Duke if you were to give people let me ask you a question if you were to say hey

[27:22] Dennis Norton men designed me a game

[27:24] Barry O designed me a game John Norris designed me a game John pop a Duke designed me a game

[27:30] Who do you think walks into the room with the design or the concept that's really

[27:36] The craziest out of the box like oh my god. I never would have thought of this game

[27:41] It's gonna be J-pop

[27:43] It's gonna be and that's his value and look I work in a creative profession and on some weird freaking level on some weird

[27:52] freaking level

[27:54] I actually relate to John pop a Duke because I feel

[27:59] Create I'm a creative I I would never leave and start my own PR company

[28:05] It would fail immediately. I relate to J-pop because all of my big campaigns in my life

[28:13] The ones that are recognizable

[28:15] They only got off the ground because of team of people who did all of the hard work that needed to be done to make the stuff work

[28:25] Work that I'm not good at work that I could never succeed at but but those individuals also

[28:33] They would never have come up with that idea had I not come up with it and together we make magic and that's J-pop's existence

[28:43] Is with the Valley Williams people in place he would he could make magic and so the question then becomes

[28:50] With the deep-rooted people in place

[28:53] Will they make magic?

[28:54] John is working alongside engineers

[28:58] Software engineers mechanical engineers other designers. He now has a team of people to help him out

[29:06] Will it

[29:08] succeed will they succeed

[29:10] And I'm here to tell you

[29:12] This is the best shot they've had at ever succeeding all right

[29:17] Now it doesn't excuse you know robberts approach robberts marketing robberts you know webinars all the stuff that

[29:25] He's doing to launch deep route. I think they did it all wrong

[29:29] I said from the very beginning Robert what you should have done is you should have figured it all out

[29:33] The fact that you're hyping your company 18 months in advance shows me one thing

[29:38] It's the reason why they're doing this now is simple it is Robert is still in a legal battle with the IP over the zidware stuff

[29:45] He's still in a legal issue with with American pinball

[29:49] Robert can't do what he wants to do legally and so he has to come out now and

[29:57] try and apply pressure

[30:00] To get the legal issues off his back because you just can't you can't just work with J-pop

[30:07] Clean slate in 2018 the way he wants to

[30:11] So that is where we're at

[30:13] It's not going to be popular some of you might be disgusted with me for saying this

[30:18] um, but I do believe John poppadook is just

[30:22] He's he's he's he is worth it if you can figure it out now nobody's been able to figure it out

[30:30] But if I as a marketer as a marketer

[30:33] If I had to go find a designer to make my games that would sell

[30:38] Right that I didn't have to rely on on a expensive license

[30:42] If I wanted a designer who knew it and make something original that people would want

[30:48] Very short list and John poppadook is at the top of that list

[30:52] All right, well, let's see what happens

[30:54] It's going to be interesting. It's going to be an interesting 18 months

[30:59] What else is going on

[31:01] Sorry guys, it is 541 in the morning

[31:04] And I'm just like spit in some freaking pinball logic at you guys

[31:09] All right, I want to I want to close this podcast on

[31:13] Something I said on a previous podcast and that was American pinball

[31:19] And October fest as a potential

[31:22] Next title for American pinball now. I have received

[31:28] uh

[31:29] Unsuspectantly I got feedback from some of you who said to me

[31:34] Hey, Chris like don't you think that October fest would be a great theme. I mean it's it would be such fun

[31:40] You know who said that Ryan C

[31:42] Thought it could be fun over at head to head pinball

[31:45] I think Dave Sanders talked to something email about it

[31:49] You know, he was kind of equating it to animal house which I also shit on as a theme

[31:54] I'm look

[31:56] I'll say it and I'll say it again if American pinball wants to go out of business

[32:01] They should make October fest. It's plain and simple plain and simple

[32:06] You you could not

[32:09] Sell me on October fest

[32:12] Out of all the potential themes in the pinball world

[32:16] That you shouldn't make that your sophomore title if you're a new pinball company

[32:22] And and I'll say this

[32:25] Like stop all of you out there stop emailing me that

[32:30] Gary Stern said that beer plus pinball equals profit

[32:36] That is such bullshit

[32:38] Stern does not make the majority of their money

[32:42] selling

[32:43] Pinball machines to bars they don't if you believe that you're an idiot

[32:48] I'm just gonna say it and the other part is this

[32:52] I get that people like to drink beer

[32:56] While they play

[32:58] Pinball

[33:00] That does not mean that

[33:03] October fest is what people want their pinball to be about

[33:10] It's like this. I don't want my pin like I don't want my pinball machine in a bar to be about a bar

[33:19] Like yeah, you can make a tap or pinball machine

[33:23] Is with that cell?

[33:25] First of all that's a better theme than October fest

[33:29] If someone would say to me hey, we're gonna make a pinball machine based on the arcade classic tapr

[33:38] I would say that's kind of cool. Imagine that

[33:42] Imagine a pinball machine

[33:44] Where it has like basically the play field looks like bars going across and the beers pop up

[33:51] like

[33:53] Pop-up targets and you have to hit them or maybe they slide across and you have to hit it before it goes over the edge

[33:59] Holy shit

[34:00] Canada in the last 30 seconds just designed and came up with a pinball concept that's far greater than fucking October fest

[34:10] You can't tell me that more people wouldn't be into tapr the pinball machine

[34:15] That does what I just described a pop-up target moves from left to right and you have to shoot it before it goes over the edge of the bar

[34:25] Look at that

[34:26] Canada the marketer

[34:28] This is why I get paid the big bucks people because I could sit in a room and come up with better themes

[34:34] Then these dingle berries can who don't understand marketing and what people want all right. I'm not a freaking fraud

[34:42] I know I left because I have offered up my skill sets to all the pinball companies of this world for free

[34:51] for free

[34:52] My clients pay me hundreds of dollars in hour

[34:57] For my marketing advice and when I offer up my skill sets for free. Do you know many times?

[35:02] I've been hit up by the pinball people of the world zero

[35:08] Zero do you know many we're the number one pinball podcast? We are the number one pinball podcast

[35:14] Do you know how many pinball companies have hit me up to sponsor this show zero

[35:22] Zero nobody

[35:23] Nobody wants to admit it and that's the problem with this hobby

[35:29] I'm sorry

[35:30] But like if you got smart people in a room smart marketers smart this I would run circles around this hobby

[35:38] With themes and ideas of what to bring to pinball run circles now. I'm not sure all my ideas could be executed

[35:45] But the ones that would they would be much better than what you're getting and I've been having conversations with friends

[35:53] Offline about this and the ultimate thing is this I was talking to a good friend. He basically said Chris

[35:59] Here's the problem

[36:01] Is that new pinball? It's just not as good as the older games

[36:06] It's just not

[36:08] the games from the 90s still blow away

[36:12] modern pinball and and and people today and people on the forums

[36:18] They're all crazy about justifying these new games, but there's just no denying the fact that what we're getting these days is

[36:29] We have to just take what we get that these games aren't really delivering

[36:34] The magic and the specialness that we want them to with all the effort that's going into it

[36:42] It's just not delivering and it's hard to argue against that

[36:46] If I were to ask you like what's the most magical pinball machine that's come out in the last five years

[36:53] We think about it all the titles that stern has made all the titles

[36:57] That that that Jersey Jack has made spookies made American pinball

[37:03] You know highway pinball dutch pinball fast pinball

[37:08] Zedware pinball skit b pinball

[37:11] You know you go down the list you know multi-morphic p3 all the companies Chicago gaming in the last five years

[37:20] What's the game that just makes you say?

[37:23] Yep, they nailed it

[37:27] It's amazing. It's magical. You have to own it

[37:33] Right

[37:34] It'd be hard you'd be hard pressed

[37:38] To put such accolades on any machine

[37:44] But then you start to think like

[37:46] Monster Bash or attack from Mars medieval madness Indiana Jones

[37:51] You know

[37:54] Tales of the Arabian nights like all

[37:57] One of those games one of those games built today

[38:01] built today

[38:03] Would immediately be the talk of the town just one of them Adams family

[38:09] Twilight zone

[38:11] You know and it's just we're still just trying as hard as we can

[38:18] To make something today

[38:20] That's even comparable

[38:23] Or in the same conversation as the best machines from yesterday years and the other point my friend was making is Chris

[38:31] You can easily get machines that cost two to three thousand dollars that are far more fun than all these new machines

[38:37] That cost way more and he's right

[38:40] He's right you don't get the bragging rights

[38:43] Because half of the half the time people buy these games just as just as a showcase that they have money

[38:48] They're even play them

[38:50] When a guy's buying Guardians of the galaxy and selling it with 32 plays on it. What's that guy saying to us?

[38:57] You got money you don't even care about the game watch a buy it

[39:02] Why did you buy it all of these sales less than 200 plays

[39:08] Either you're an idiot or you're a liar or you just changed the code and now it reset the plays

[39:15] Who buys a pinball machine and plays it only 200 times over like a period of years

[39:22] I don't buy that I put like 30 plays on a Batman like in like two hours

[39:29] And it's like why would I not play it anyway guys

[39:34] This has been episode 202 of Canadian pinball podcasts

[39:39] Your source for the most off the rails

[39:44] Read

[39:45] Ridiculous discussion about pinball. I thank you for listening. I really do

[39:50] I don't know why you guys like tuning sometimes like to hear me put on a mic and just ramble about this hobby

[39:55] But I hope I hope you feel like

[39:59] We're getting somewhere like we're we're talking about the reality and the truth of what's under the surface of these companies

[40:06] And I and look and all I'm trying to do is try and get at what that truth is

[40:12] And my speculations might be correct. They might be wrong

[40:16] But I'm allowed to deliver them

[40:19] All right, this is a free world as long as this is a free country

[40:23] I'm allowed to give my opinions about pinball

[40:25] But I am shocked that I think canada's pinball podcast continues to be that's the bad pinball podcast

[40:32] We're not even gonna mention it you know, I love like slam tilt and bro do even talk pinball

[40:37] We're not even gonna mention his podcast on the trippy award. Come on. I love it. I the more they try to

[40:44] Ignore me. They ignore us you the listener. They're trying to ignore this entire show

[40:52] The more popular we become have a great day. We'll talk to you soon

[41:07] Man, I hate this crap the same rap. This is brains either way we act when we confuse hip hop for real life
