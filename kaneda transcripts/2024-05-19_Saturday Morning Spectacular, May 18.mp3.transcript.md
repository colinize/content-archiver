[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:06] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome.

[00:10] I'm just an ordinary, daily guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:17] Alright, welcome everybody to Canada's Saturday Morning Spectacular.

[00:22] What Saturday is it?

[00:23] I think it's the 18th of May.

[00:27] And I'm here, it is Saturday, baby Cassie in his next store, Killian is playing with

[00:33] his good friend, and we're going to talk all about what's going on in the pinball world.

[00:38] I've got my sunglasses on, I've got my bandana on, I've got people coming through the door,

[00:44] and I'm doing something I haven't done in a while.

[00:46] I haven't really done this ever before, people.

[00:49] I can't believe it's taken me this long to figure this out.

[00:52] I am going to record the audio with my mic through Audacity so that when I upload the

[00:58] audio for the Saturday Morning Spectacular, for all my club members out there, it's going

[01:04] to sound amazing.

[01:06] It is not going to sound like I'm downloading the video from Facebook and then trying to

[01:11] upload it again.

[01:12] So welcome everybody.

[01:14] Happy Saturday, we got Godino in the house, we've got Charles, we've got Adam, we've got

[01:19] everybody coming through the door.

[01:21] What I normally do, I like to edit out the pauses before I upload the audio as I read

[01:27] some of your commentary, but unlike other pinball content creators, Canada doesn't need to stop

[01:33] and read.

[01:34] I keep going.

[01:36] It's like Jack Danger when he streams pinball, he knows how to do it where he doesn't skip

[01:41] a beat.

[01:42] Javier, man, I got to tell you right now, I hope you canceled your John Wick LE order.

[01:47] What are you thinking, brother?

[01:49] Why would you order a John Wick LE?

[01:52] And Javier was like, well, there's only five coming to Spain.

[01:57] Newsflash, Javier, there's going to be five available for sale in Spain forever.

[02:03] How much did that game cost you?

[02:04] Come clean, Javier, like $19,000.

[02:08] We're going to talk all about John Wick.

[02:10] We're going to talk all about what's going on.

[02:12] He canceled it.

[02:13] Yes, yes.

[02:15] Tell Stern to eff off with this game.

[02:19] I'm just going to tell you right now, and we're going to talk a lot about Stern Pinball

[02:23] and this latest game and why the game is not selling.

[02:27] And I've never seen Stern Pinball so desperate to drum up sales for a game like they are

[02:34] right now with John Wick.

[02:36] This is the most humbling moment I've ever seen, maybe in the history of Stern.

[02:42] Just back in the day when WWE came out and nobody bought it, Stern didn't really try

[02:49] to shove it down our throats.

[02:51] But now when you look at this and you look at the marketing and you look at Timmy Sexton

[02:56] trying to explain the game, and I watched the stream another half hour of them playing

[03:01] the game, and I'm seeing the photos of all these pros going on location as if we're supposed

[03:06] to cheerlead that.

[03:08] Wow, congratulations, Stern.

[03:10] You made a bunch of games, not many people want it.

[03:13] You can put it on location all you want, and that's exactly where we're all going to play

[03:18] John Wick.

[03:19] We're not going to go into our wallets and spend this kind of money to own this game,

[03:24] and it's a glorious moment in Pinball.

[03:27] As most of us wake up and say, hey, I can enjoy a game, I can have fun on it, but I don't

[03:33] have to play it.

[03:34] Hold on, I'm hearing some baby monitor right here, and I'm like, what is going on?

[03:40] Canada's got two kids now.

[03:41] I'm going to lower this so I don't hear like Killian talking in my right ear.

[03:46] And for those of you just joining, we're going to start using the nice mic to record the

[03:50] audio for Saturday morning spectacular.

[03:52] I love it.

[03:53] Thank you guys so much for all the support this week.

[03:57] And I mean it when I say it, this week was incredible.

[04:00] We had about like 20 new people join Canada's Pinball podcast, and our numbers are phenomenal.

[04:05] We've now got, Dion, what's up, brother?

[04:08] We've now got 707 paying subscribers to Canada's Pinball podcast.

[04:14] People are starting to do the math.

[04:16] They're starting to realize that this is where all the support is at.

[04:19] Christopher Marquette over at Cointaker.

[04:22] Welcome to the party, pal.

[04:24] We're going to talk about Metallica.

[04:26] We're going to talk about WIC.

[04:27] We're going to talk about Funhouse.

[04:29] We're going to talk about everything going on in Pinball right now.

[04:32] There's a lot going on.

[04:34] And I love doing this show.

[04:35] I love this content.

[04:36] And I love that each and every one of you is showing everybody else this is where the

[04:41] party's at.

[04:42] Like we're having the most fun.

[04:43] And we have the most engaging conversation on a weekly basis.

[04:47] Albert, what's up, brother?

[04:49] Will you break last week's record of 17 F-bombs?

[04:53] Good question, man.

[04:54] And I'm thinking about like maybe, just maybe my ranch show is the reason why so many people

[05:01] joined.

[05:02] I don't know.

[05:03] Maybe.

[05:04] Maybe people liked Canada unhinged a little bit, right?

[05:07] The chains were off.

[05:08] The chains were off.

[05:09] And to summarize last week's show, if you didn't hear it, you should go hear it first

[05:13] and foremost.

[05:14] But to summarize it, it's really simple.

[05:17] F-off Stern Pinball.

[05:20] F-off Pinball companies and your greedy prices.

[05:24] F-off George Gomez.

[05:26] When you say you made Black Knight Topper three times as expensive because of the demand.

[05:33] F-off.

[05:35] F-off charging $2,000 for a Foo Fighters Topper because of the demand.

[05:42] And what George Gomez doesn't get and Crazy Levy doesn't get and all the Stern apologists

[05:47] do not get.

[05:48] The only reason why Black Knight Topper, Ghostbusters Topper, was selling for more money than it

[05:56] should because Stern decided to stop making them.

[06:00] That's it.

[06:01] F-off.

[06:02] If they just made them and supplied the demand for it when it came out, they wouldn't be

[06:07] selling for three times the price.

[06:09] But they decided not to because for some reason, Stern Pinball doesn't want to supply its own

[06:15] customers with the toppers they want when they come out.

[06:19] And they create this stupid FOMO around everything.

[06:22] And it's over.

[06:23] Like the FOMO is dead.

[06:25] The stupidity at Stern marketing these days, they killed their own FOMO.

[06:30] They killed their own FOMO.

[06:31] It is like, I'm trying to think of that scene in the movie.

[06:34] What movie is it from?

[06:35] It's like, you idiot, you killed us.

[06:38] It's Hunt for Red October.

[06:40] That's what Stern did.

[06:41] They're the other submarine and they just fired a missile at Red October and they thought

[06:48] they had it, right?

[06:49] They thought they had the victory in hand.

[06:51] They thought they were going to win this naval battle.

[06:54] And the stupid marketing team led by like Jody and Seth and all those people over there,

[07:00] they blew themselves up.

[07:02] They blew up their own FOMO.

[07:05] And FOMO is the fuel that has driven Stern Pinball for the longest time.

[07:10] And what an idiotic move it was to destroy their own FOMO.

[07:14] And now there's no FOMO.

[07:16] And the reason why they destroyed it is a series of stupid marketing moves over price

[07:22] games, lying to people.

[07:24] Do you remember when James Bond 60th came out and they're like, here's the James Bond

[07:28] topper?

[07:29] It was exclusive to James Bond 60th.

[07:32] And that was a reason why people had FOMO.

[07:34] Oh, if I get the 60th, I'm going to have one of the games with only this topper because

[07:39] nobody else gets it.

[07:40] And then what happens after that happens, they're like, oh, we're actually going to make more

[07:44] of these toppers, but your topper is exclusively signed by Keith Elwyn with the cheap Sharpie

[07:51] on the back of the topper and you're never going to see it.

[07:54] And they made moves like this, right?

[07:56] And the Apologist and the Pinball content creators, they didn't get mad.

[08:00] There was no uproar because it's Keith Elwyn.

[08:02] We can't say anything bad about a Keith Elwyn release.

[08:05] Did Keith Elwyn stop them?

[08:07] No.

[08:08] And that's the other thing is like, when Canada gets unshackled, nobody's safe because I don't

[08:13] care.

[08:14] Like I don't care.

[08:15] I don't think these people are precious.

[08:18] I love it when they make great games.

[08:19] I love it when they make a world under glass.

[08:21] But when you make these stupid moves and you blow up your own FOMO, you land where you

[08:27] are right now, Stern.

[08:28] Look how pathetic this John Wick launch has been.

[08:32] They look like a foolish company scrambling, scrambling to try to get any excitement for

[08:39] this game.

[08:40] They've turned to all their psycho fence and they've made their content and it's not working.

[08:45] They show us pictures of all of these pros about to go on location.

[08:49] Great.

[08:50] We don't care.

[08:51] We're going to play it at the local brewery and then we're going to go home.

[08:54] You think we're going to buy this thing for $7,000?

[08:56] You think we're going to buy this LE for $13,000?

[08:59] The fact that Stern pinball is making a thousand John Wick LEs when they only made 800 Star

[09:06] Wars.

[09:07] I mean, think about how stupid that is.

[09:08] Yeah, it's stupid.

[09:10] Like F-Offstern, like you don't understand what demand is.

[09:13] And I'm just going to say this right now when George Gomez gets up there and says, hey, we're

[09:17] going to make games to fulfill demand.

[09:19] What market research did you do, George Gomez?

[09:23] To say to us that you think there's demand for 1000 John Wick LEs.

[09:30] What market research did you do?

[09:32] I'll tell you what you did, George.

[09:34] You didn't do any market research.

[09:37] All you're looking at is that if we put anything in a box, these idiots will buy it.

[09:43] That is what 1000 John Wick LEs signifies to me, that we're arrogant, that we think these

[09:50] idiots will buy anything we put in a box.

[09:53] And as long as we push the designer out and Timmy Sexton and they talk about the code

[09:58] and all of our psycho-fant content creators, just keep shoving it down your throats and

[10:02] all of the dealers just keep spamming you, we've got John Wick for sale.

[10:06] No crap you've got it for sale.

[10:08] I'm so sick of seeing ads for John Wick.

[10:12] I mean it's not working, Stern.

[10:14] And you're arrogant.

[10:15] And the fact that you think 1000 people want a John Wick LE is stupid.

[10:20] It's bad marketing.

[10:21] More John Wick fans than Ghostbusters?

[10:24] More John Wick fans than Star Wars?

[10:27] More John Wick fans than James Bond?

[10:29] Not James Bond because they also made 1000 more John Wick fans than Metallica and Tron?

[10:35] You are arrogant.

[10:37] For the longest time, Stern, for like 10 years, you had it perfect.

[10:41] You had the FOMO.

[10:42] You made 500 LEs, they sold out in one day.

[10:45] You made all the distributors money.

[10:47] You made money.

[10:48] The consumers who like bought your products, they made money on the games when they were

[10:52] good and if the games weren't good, they didn't lose much money.

[10:55] You had it.

[10:56] You had the Golden Goose.

[10:57] You had the Golden Goose for all these years and then you bring in Seth Davis and he's

[11:01] like we're going to expand Pinball.

[11:03] We're going to bring Pinball to new people, to new audiences and you think you're going

[11:06] to bring Pinball to new audiences by raising the price, by taking stuff out of the game

[11:12] and by making themes that people don't really care about.

[11:15] Yeah, that's a winning formula and then you kill your FOMO by doubling the volume of the

[11:21] games that created the FOMO and then you almost double the price at the same time and we're

[11:26] supposed to sit here and take it on the chin and talk about how much you put into the code.

[11:31] Here's the thing Stern and everybody sees it.

[11:34] You used to be a company and George Gomez knows this.

[11:37] You used to say that Pinball is a game where it's a world under glass, right?

[11:42] That was the thing and now Stern Pinball is a new thing.

[11:45] It's a world on the screen and that is why John Wick is not selling because we're not

[11:50] stupid and we're looking at the game and we're not seeing a world under glass.

[11:55] We are seeing a world on the screen and I don't want to see a world on the screen.

[11:59] I want to see a world under glass and you made a theme that's not working.

[12:04] It's not resonating because you didn't do any market research and the reason why John

[12:08] Wick is boring to look at and I've watched this stream gang for like an hour or more.

[12:14] It is the most boring games to witness being played and the reason why is this is John

[12:19] Wick as a movie is fun to watch, right?

[12:21] It's fun to just sit back in your chair, get some popcorn and watch this hit man just take

[12:27] out all these bad guys and if you think about it, John Wick is like his soul's been destroyed.

[12:33] He's a man on a mission.

[12:34] He's kind of numb to the world.

[12:37] He's like, I don't care.

[12:38] I'm just going to kill everybody and I'm just going to go on this mission and it works in

[12:42] a theatrical sense.

[12:43] And then if you think about trying to translate that to Pinball, it doesn't work.

[12:48] It doesn't work.

[12:49] This game just lacks personality.

[12:51] It lacks like a soul.

[12:53] Like it's just this numb experience and you could see it in the code and you can see it

[12:58] in the gameplay.

[12:59] You could see it and even the streamers, right?

[13:02] You could see it when Joel plays it and other people are playing it.

[13:05] They want to so badly.

[13:07] They want to jump on this game and feel something and nobody's feeling anything and there's

[13:13] no way to change that.

[13:14] Like it wasn't a good theme for Pinball.

[13:17] It doesn't work.

[13:19] There's no magic under the glass.

[13:21] Everybody knows that and at these prices, it's dead on arrival.

[13:25] So it is absolutely hysterical.

[13:27] Kingston realize what happens when they screwed over all of us after all of these like last

[13:34] three to four years.

[13:35] They've screwed over everybody who used to keep them in business and kept FOMO strong

[13:39] and now they've got a dud, right?

[13:41] They've got a dud.

[13:43] They've got a dud on their hands and they don't know what to do.

[13:47] It doesn't matter how many times, right?

[13:49] How many, oh, it's fun to shoot.

[13:51] All right, guys, hey, everybody, News Flash, News Break, John Ehrlich at Jack Bar said it's

[13:55] fun to shoot.

[13:56] So sick of this being the fallback.

[13:59] What, John, did you think it wasn't going to be fun to shoot?

[14:02] Like fan layout, stern flippers, so what?

[14:06] So what?

[14:07] Every Pinball machine is basically fun to shoot.

[14:09] That's a fan layout.

[14:10] Name me a fan layout game that's not fun to shoot.

[14:14] I'm so tired of the excuses.

[14:16] You know, John, you're an operator.

[14:18] I get it.

[14:19] It's going to work for you on location, but it's not going to earn great on location.

[14:22] It's not.

[14:23] It's not going to earn as well as Toy Story.

[14:24] It's not going to earn as well as some of the new modern games.

[14:27] And so here we are.

[14:29] All right, here we are.

[14:30] All new pins are fun to shoot.

[14:32] So then what?

[14:33] Are you going to buy one?

[14:34] Are you going to buy one?

[14:35] Right?

[14:36] And that's where we're at.

[14:37] And Sturm Pinball can survive if the home buyers are not on board for each game.

[14:42] They can survive if they have to shove a thousand L.E.s of a game nobody wants down the throats

[14:49] of its dealers.

[14:50] Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen, for dealers and distros to close their doors in 2024 if

[14:57] they've invested heavily on Venom and John Wick, right?

[15:02] Because Jaws sales are going to be over soon.

[15:05] And look, here's what's going to happen.

[15:06] Stern just going to make Jaws premiums to the cows come home, and then all of those are

[15:11] going to start to tank in value and they're going to oversaturate.

[15:14] And then they're going to go back to the well of Metallica.

[15:16] So let's think about this.

[15:18] So you got to flop with John Wick.

[15:20] You've got 6,000 people that probably own Metallica and are happy with it.

[15:24] And then you're going to go make another Metallica and you're going to screw those people over.

[15:28] And you're going to, why?

[15:29] Why George Gomez?

[15:30] When George Gomez says, well, we're going to make games because there's demand.

[15:34] Is there really demand for more Metallica, George?

[15:37] Right?

[15:38] There's 6,000 of them in the world.

[15:40] And I get there's a few newbies out there like Don who has like 11 pinball machines in

[15:45] like one year, right?

[15:47] Right?

[15:48] I get it.

[15:49] There's enough Dons in the world to keep Stern's new business model going.

[15:53] For every one Don, you're losing five of us who supported you all these years and it's

[15:59] not going to work.

[16:00] And you can see it.

[16:01] They don't even know how to make the content anymore.

[16:03] Like even like the content creators that are in Stern's back pocket, they don't even

[16:09] know what to say, right?

[16:10] The whole buy, buy, buy people, they look so stupid right now.

[16:14] They look so stupid.

[16:16] And you are getting on the airwaves and saying buy this game and we look, are you ready for

[16:20] it?

[16:21] We know, like are you ready for the distro content creators to say, John Wick is great.

[16:25] You know, and then here's what's going to happen next.

[16:27] They're going to be unboxing all their LEDs be like, oh, you know, I'm going to sell below

[16:31] map.

[16:32] The only way to sell below map pricing is if they unbox it, do a stream and then they're

[16:36] going to give it to you for like 11, two or 11, five.

[16:39] That's what's going to happen.

[16:41] It's just not going to work.

[16:42] It's just not going to work.

[16:44] You know, and here's the problem with all of it.

[16:45] It's like, you got to be an idiot to buy a John Wick LE, right?

[16:49] You're going to lose $3,000 to $4,000.

[16:50] Idiot move, right?

[16:51] There's no demand for this game.

[16:52] It's never coming back.

[16:53] Then you got to be even more of an idiot to buy a John Wick premium.

[16:57] And the reason why you got to be more of an idiot to buy a John Wick premium is that you

[17:01] could get a John Wick LE for the same price as a premium if you just wait a few months.

[17:06] And then it just leaves the John Wick pros, which are going to be on location, which is

[17:10] where we're all going to go play the game.

[17:12] And here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, you're waiting for it, playing John Wick

[17:15] pro, a game in which they've got 50 minutes of movie clips and everything's happening

[17:20] on the screen, right?

[17:21] Nothing fun is happening on the play field.

[17:23] There is nothing exciting happening on the play field of this game.

[17:27] And so everything's on the screen and you got to hear it and you got to get deep into

[17:30] the code.

[17:31] Guess what that's going to be like when you play on location.

[17:33] It's going to suck.

[17:34] It's going to suck because when you go on location, you want to play a game that has

[17:38] more mechanical magic.

[17:40] You want to play a game like Toad in or Funhouse or a game like Twilight Zone, you know, or

[17:45] a game like Elton John where it's just boom, it hits you.

[17:47] It hits you and there's so much kinetic energy going on.

[17:50] There's so much light shows.

[17:52] When people are saying that John Wick light show is great, do me a favor, go play in Elton

[17:57] John and don't be an idiot.

[17:59] Don't say stupid stuff like John Wick has a great light show.

[18:03] It had a great light show 10 years ago, but how can you say John Wick light show is great

[18:08] when Elton John exists, when guns and roses exist, when games with real good light shows,

[18:14] Rick and Morty, much better light show, all the spooky games, much better light show.

[18:18] You're really giving Stern an excuse.

[18:20] And I just want to say this too.

[18:22] I saw that, I think Flinniebus took a picture of the underside of a John Wick pro.

[18:29] And ladies and gentlemen, if you don't think the Stern bomb is like three grand or 3500,

[18:35] go look at that photo.

[18:36] I don't want to look at a pinball machine.

[18:38] I mean it when I say this, I don't want to look at the underside of a pinball machine

[18:43] and feel like Jengus and I could have built that game in a few hours with the screwdriver.

[18:50] And that's what it feels like when I see the underside of a John Wick pro.

[18:55] When I look at the underside of a pirate to the Caribbean or a, you know, a hobbit, the

[19:00] underside of like an AC DC, the underside of a Metallica, I don't feel that way.

[19:06] But when I lift the hood on a freaking John Wick, these games are cheap.

[19:12] They're cheap.

[19:13] And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, you know, John Wick is good for Canadian business

[19:17] because nobody else is saying this stuff.

[19:19] They're all trying to shove this game down your throat.

[19:21] They're all trying to shove this game down your throat and they can't get it done.

[19:26] They can't get it done.

[19:27] And so now, now what's happening, Canadian pinball podcast, it's gaining momentum.

[19:32] We've got the most subscribers out of everybody combined, combined.

[19:36] And now they can't, why can't they figure this Patreon thing out?

[19:39] It's not hard.

[19:40] And you see them, like they start their shows like begging for Patreon support.

[19:47] And if you want to get Patreon support, just do what Canada did.

[19:51] Take it all behind the paywall.

[19:53] And you know why they won't do that?

[19:55] Because they know nobody will follow.

[19:57] Right.

[19:58] And so here we are with 707 paid subscribers, you know, and it's amazing.

[20:04] And it's like more money monetized than all them.

[20:07] They all hate it on Canada.

[20:09] And now look at Canada.

[20:10] I'm the only one speaking on behalf of the pinball buying community.

[20:14] Who amongst you, who amongst you wants pinball prices to be this high?

[20:19] Who amongst you wants to spend $13,000 on a pinball machine so your distro can pocket

[20:25] $2,000 and Stern can make three, like two times as much as they were a few years ago.

[20:32] Also they can put stuff on a screen.

[20:34] Also we also, the modern pinball is a world on an LCD.

[20:38] And that's where we're at people.

[20:40] It's so much fun now doing my show because I knew, I knew that if Stern did what I, I

[20:48] I totally knew they were going to do this.

[20:51] They were going to try to take all of the money that was on the table.

[20:55] And when you try to take all the money that's on the table and you go all in, the problem

[21:00] with Stern pinball going all in.

[21:02] Imagine if this is a game of poker, right?

[21:04] And we're playing with them, right?

[21:06] They go all in with their product.

[21:09] They think they got pocket aces on every game.

[21:12] That's the arrogance.

[21:14] The problem is they don't.

[21:16] And we all love Stern pinball.

[21:19] We think Stern pinball makes the greatest $5,500 pro.

[21:24] We think Stern pinball makes the greatest $7,500 premium.

[21:30] And we think Stern pinball makes the best $10,000 Ellie machine money can buy.

[21:36] That is your ceiling.

[21:38] That is where demand remains strong.

[21:43] And we think Stern should make 500 LEs of every game unless they've got a triple A

[21:51] banger like Star Wars.

[21:53] So when you shove a thousand John Wick LEs into the marketplace Stern, you look stupid.

[22:01] And now you have to do this panic tour.

[22:03] It's so funny to watch like George Gomez, Tim Sex, they're all everywhere.

[22:07] They're everywhere.

[22:08] You can't swing a dead cat on social media without hitting a Stern employee trying to

[22:14] tell you how great John Wick is.

[22:16] And we're not buying it.

[22:17] Like they could do like a loser kid pinball podcast.

[22:21] They're going to do all the podcasters, right?

[22:23] All the podcasters will interview Stern and guess who won't?

[22:27] I won't because I don't want to interview them because I only have one question for

[22:32] Stern pinball.

[22:33] I have one question.

[22:34] How do you wake up and have balls big enough to charge $2,000 for a Foo Fighters topper?

[22:42] That's the only question I have.

[22:44] And if they can give me an answer that is satisfactory to that one question, sure, then

[22:50] I'll bring you on my show.

[22:51] Sure, then I'll interview you.

[22:53] Sure, then I'll send my 3000 fans to go buy your games.

[22:57] Sure, but I'm not going to do it.

[22:59] And you know what's happening?

[23:00] It's happening in the Patreon community chat.

[23:02] And by the way, guys, if you're not a Patreon member, you are missing the greatest chat in

[23:08] all of pinball.

[23:09] We've got Bond on there making epic memes.

[23:13] We've got Dave over in the UK.

[23:15] We've got Eric Caden.

[23:16] We've got everybody over there.

[23:18] Todd Tuckie's on there.

[23:19] Everyone's over there having the greatest ongoing conversation about pinball.

[23:24] It is beautiful.

[23:25] It is so much fun.

[23:26] And if you are a Patreon member and you're not in the chat, what are you doing?

[23:30] You know, what are you doing?

[23:32] Carrie Hardy, get in there, brother.

[23:33] Jengus is in there, but Jengus, come on, bro.

[23:35] I want to see more activity.

[23:37] But this is where we're at.

[23:39] This is where we're at.

[23:40] And in a world in which everything's getting really expensive, I love it.

[23:43] I love that consumers have drawn a line.

[23:46] I love that we've put our foot down.

[23:48] And I love that this is the only place that's not going to make videos that are like, okay,

[23:54] here's how great John Wick is.

[23:55] And here's how the Bo Peep Loops work.

[23:57] And then a week from now, I'm going to sell my game.

[23:58] Right?

[23:59] I'm going to hype it, and then I'm going to pump it, and then I'm going to dump it.

[24:01] Right?

[24:02] And then those people, man, like they don't even know what to do anymore.

[24:04] They don't even know how to approach me.

[24:06] Every once in a while, they'll pop in here, but they got nothing to say.

[24:09] They got nothing to say.

[24:11] They got nothing to say.

[24:12] They're afraid to talk to me.

[24:13] They're afraid to interview me.

[24:15] I'll go on any show.

[24:16] And I'll explain why John Wick, if you buy an LE, you're an idiot.

[24:20] I mean, that's it.

[24:21] If you buy a John Wick LE, you're an idiot at $13,000.

[24:27] And you know why I would say that you're an idiot?

[24:30] It's the same way I would tell my friend, if you stick your hand in the fire, you're an

[24:33] idiot.

[24:34] If you didn't expect to get burned and then you want to cry, you're going to get burned.

[24:37] Because this is it.

[24:38] If you want a John Wick LE and you love John Wick and you can't wait to get a pinball machine,

[24:44] fine.

[24:45] You can't wait to get a John Wick LE when it is $9,000 in October, which is what it

[24:49] will be.

[24:51] And all of these distros and dealers are sitting on this game.

[24:54] And I love it.

[24:55] There's always that rogue story of a distributor somewhere in the middle of nowhere who got

[25:01] 12 John Wick LEs and sold 10 to collectors.

[25:04] I love those stories.

[25:05] People hit me up with those bulls.

[25:07] I'm not going to curse.

[25:09] They hit me up with those stories all the time.

[25:11] My distro can't keep them in stock.

[25:13] My distro can't keep them in stock.

[25:15] Sure.

[25:16] Sure.

[25:17] And so then you go over to the John Wick owners thread and it's like just barely two pages

[25:21] and nobody wants to admit they bought one because those people took $4,000.

[25:26] They put it in a bathtub.

[25:28] They poured gasoline over it and lit it on fire.

[25:32] And that's where we're at.

[25:33] And Sturm Bimmel needs to wake the F up.

[25:35] Like just wake up George, wake up Tim Sexton, wake up Jody, wake up Gary.

[25:40] You guys don't get it.

[25:42] If you think your company is good at supplying product where there is demand, then I have

[25:49] a very simple question for everyone at Sturm Bimmel.

[25:53] Who greenlit John Wick?

[25:55] Did you do any market research that showed you if you made John Wick, you could sell

[26:01] a thousand limited edition machines at 13,000.

[26:06] What did you do market research wise?

[26:09] You didn't do anything.

[26:10] What you did do was you saw people buy a game like Godzilla for 10 and flip it for 16.

[26:18] You saw that, right?

[26:19] You saw people buy Tron for 5,500 and flip it for 10.

[26:24] You saw people buy Batman SLE for 15 and flip it for 30.

[26:30] You've seen and you've witnessed that some of your games over the years, you saw people

[26:35] during COVID buy a stranger things LE for 8,500 and then get 18,000 during COVID, right?

[26:42] You saw all that behavior and you said to yourselves, well, wait a minute, if these people are selling

[26:47] our product that they love and there's that bunch of demand that someone's going to pay

[26:52] $10,000 over what we sold it for, then we're leaving a ton of money on the table.

[26:58] So here's what we're going to do.

[26:59] We're going to take that money for us and we're going to increase the volume.

[27:04] We're going to increase the price and these idiots will still buy because look at what

[27:09] they're doing.

[27:10] The problem is Stern, that was during COVID and we all thought we were going to die.

[27:16] We all thought we were going to live in our homes forever.

[27:19] We all thought the world was going to be apocalyptic and our home basements were going to be the

[27:23] only place we spent our time.

[27:25] And so grown men, let's just be honest, grown men with decent incomes got really bored,

[27:34] had no vacations going on, weren't eating out at all and they decided to do what grown

[27:40] bored mostly white middle-aged men will do.

[27:45] They will spend their money like idiots.

[27:49] All you got to do in the history of humanity to see stupid spending is take a middle-aged

[27:56] white guy with some money and watch how he spends it.

[28:00] He will spend it chasing the inner child in himself thinking he's going to make his life

[28:06] better and happier and he will end up unsatisfied, unfulfilled and his wife will look at him

[28:12] and be like, what did you just do?

[28:15] And Stern has built their modern marketing strategy on the premise that we will attract

[28:23] enough of those grown middle-aged white men who are bored, who have nothing better to

[28:29] do.

[28:30] And the thing is like your market research can't be pin-side.

[28:34] It can't be guys living in their extended game room who have like a 2,000 square foot

[28:41] garage full of pins and they're on pin-side all day long because if you're on pin-side

[28:46] all day long, you're a bored middle-aged white male who's got more money than they

[28:54] know what to do with and they have nothing but free time.

[28:57] And you see it.

[28:58] You're arguing at like 2.17 in the afternoon.

[29:01] There's like heated debates happening on pin-side.

[29:05] Shouldn't they be at work?

[29:07] Shouldn't they be doing other things?

[29:09] They're on a pinball website, like nonstop talking about pinball all throughout the day.

[29:16] That's your market research and sure, and here's the crazy part, is Stern has managed.

[29:20] They've managed to lose those guys.

[29:24] Like when you listen to Iceman, the dude's got like 30,000 posts on pin-side, right?

[29:29] 30,000 posts.

[29:30] Just imagine, and that's just, those are posts.

[29:34] Imagine how many words are in each of those posts.

[29:36] He loves pinball, right?

[29:37] He's got like all these games.

[29:39] They've lost him.

[29:41] Even he is like, whatever, the roosters are coming home, right?

[29:44] Or something's coming home to roost, whatever the phrase is.

[29:47] He's been calling us for a few years now.

[29:49] As much as he hates me, him and I feel the same way about all of this.

[29:54] They killed the golden goose.

[29:56] Guys like him aren't advocating.

[29:58] They've lost the narrative.

[30:01] And so here we are.

[30:02] It's fun, right?

[30:03] It's really fun to talk about.

[30:04] I'm happy that I'm doing this audio.

[30:06] For you 104 people watching right now who are club members, I am recording the show using

[30:11] Audacity with my good mic.

[30:13] So when I upload the audio to the Saturday morning, I don't have to like do any other

[30:17] stuff.

[30:18] It's going to sound better.

[30:19] I say thank you to the 707 club members out there.

[30:23] Out there.

[30:24] I wish I could just like lend some of my subscribers to the other content creators.

[30:28] Like, hey man, I see you struggling with just 57 paid subscribers making 300 bucks a month.

[30:36] And all you're doing is giving giveaways.

[30:38] Like, hey guys, join my Patreon for a chance to win a translate.

[30:43] You can pick any translate.

[30:44] Like what do you, like guys, stop, stop.

[30:49] I don't give away S-H-I-T.

[30:51] There's no translates.

[30:52] There's no polo shirts.

[30:54] There's nothing.

[30:55] Just do a damn good show and stop giving away everything for free.

[31:01] Like the Joker said, if you're good at something in life, don't do it for free.

[31:07] Nobody wants stupid translates.

[31:09] Like what the, like this is why I quit League night.

[31:11] I used to go to League night in New York City and it's like, you're going to play for four

[31:15] hours and either win a translate or 40 bucks.

[31:19] And I remember being at Sunshine one day and I'm there.

[31:22] It's like from like eight to almost midnight.

[31:25] And then these dudes are holding up like translates and 40 bucks being like, look how I just spent

[31:31] four hours.

[31:32] And I'm like, there's four dudes who are not getting laid tonight.

[31:36] Right?

[31:37] Those four, those four right there not getting laid.

[31:39] Hey honey, I just won a Looney Tunes translate.

[31:44] If there's any way to get your wife to close her legs, it's to come home with a pinball

[31:51] translate.

[31:52] I mean, am I the only one who has to say this stuff?

[31:55] Like seriously dudes, like don't spend four hours in one of the most amazing cities ever.

[32:01] Like throwing around a pinball machine to win a damn translate.

[32:05] And no one else talks like this.

[32:06] And why do he ask?

[32:07] How does he have 770 subscribers?

[32:10] And damn it, if he's not right, he's just, he's entertaining.

[32:14] But man, let's go listen over here for 90 minutes while we talk about, you know, if

[32:19] whether or not how to get to the wizard mode, nobody cares.

[32:24] Nobody cares guys.

[32:25] You can't touch this.

[32:27] You can't touch this.

[32:28] No notes, no nothing, no agenda.

[32:31] Just hit go and we're going and we're capturing what's in people's minds.

[32:35] And that's what's fun about Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[32:38] And once you get it, right?

[32:39] Once you get Canada's Pinball Podcast into your head, you know this.

[32:43] They can't really go anywhere else.

[32:45] And the numbers don't lie.

[32:47] So here's, let's talk about Fun House.

[32:49] So John Wick, dead on arrival.

[32:52] It's going to be so comical watching what Stern does over the next few weeks because

[32:56] Stern is not used to this.

[32:58] Well, let's, before we go to Fun House, let's talk about what's next.

[33:01] So then I think what's next is Metallica.

[33:03] I think Stern is going to realize real quickly that John Wick sales are done and they're

[33:08] never going to get them back.

[33:10] And it doesn't matter how many streams they do because every time they do another stream,

[33:14] it bores us.

[33:15] Like the John Wick stream is as boring as it gets.

[33:18] Like when I watch that stream, I literally want to fall back and play dead.

[33:23] I am so bored by it.

[33:24] I'm bored by everything happening in the game.

[33:26] I'm bored by their descriptions.

[33:28] I'm bored by it all.

[33:29] All right.

[33:30] I'm bored by it all.

[33:31] All right.

[33:32] And I'm just like, just it's next.

[33:33] It's just like, okay, cool.

[33:35] This is what we got next, next.

[33:37] And so I think what is next is going to be Metallica.

[33:42] And from what I'm hearing, it is not going to be an all new Metallica game.

[33:46] It is going to be a vault edition of Metallica.

[33:51] Raymond Davidson is working on porting over the original Lyman sheets code and like animations

[33:58] to an LCD screen.

[34:00] Okay.

[34:01] And so that is going to happen.

[34:03] Now look, this is going to be interesting because if Stern comes out, I was talking to

[34:08] a friend of the show, Ken Trox.

[34:09] I think Ken, I got to learn how to say your last name, but Kenny, Ken was telling me that

[34:14] he has a Metallica premium.

[34:15] And he said, Chris, you know, should I sell my game?

[34:17] And I said, Ken, how much did you buy your Metallica premium for?

[34:21] And he said $6,000.

[34:24] And I said to him, all right, so here's the deal.

[34:27] Do you really want to sell your Metallica for six grand when a new premium is going

[34:32] to be $9,500?

[34:33] Okay.

[34:34] And you know, it's just like, he's just like, man, I've just had the game for six years

[34:38] on board of it.

[34:39] I want to get rid of it.

[34:40] I'm like, cool, get rid of it.

[34:42] But you know, if Stern goes back to the Metallica, well, I don't know, man.

[34:46] I don't think there's, there's just too many Metallica's out there.

[34:50] I think the remake they should be doing is a remake of Tron with better artwork and you

[34:57] know, all that daft punk, Ellie, multi-ball madness.

[35:00] I think they remake Tron, make some enhancements to the light cycles and the fiber optic lighting.

[35:07] You know, imagine Tron.

[35:09] Just think about this for a minute.

[35:10] Imagine Tron.

[35:11] Close your eyes, everybody.

[35:12] Close your eyes and imagine, imagine a few things.

[35:14] Do me a favor.

[35:15] Everybody right now, let's do this together, right?

[35:18] Let's all close our eyes and imagine a world in which Canada actually plays pinball.

[35:24] You can't do it, right?

[35:26] Imagine a world in which Canada, my eyes are closed, by the way.

[35:28] Imagine a world in which Canada goes to a pinball tournament and doesn't finish last

[35:33] place.

[35:34] I mean, you can imagine that, right?

[35:36] Imagine a world, right, in which Tron pinball has the lighting of Elton John.

[35:43] Imagine a world in which Stern actually had modern lighting that could actually make you

[35:48] feel like you're going into the grid.

[35:51] Not the crappy lighting in Tron.

[35:53] Imagine that world and that's the thing, people.

[35:57] That's the thing.

[35:59] We've seen what's possible in pinball.

[36:02] Stern is going back to the well and I think they're going to continue to misread where

[36:08] the market is at.

[36:10] I've heard nobody from Stern reach out to me.

[36:12] You know, George Gomez sent me a message.

[36:14] I'm going to tell you this.

[36:16] He sent me a message and then all I saw was unsent.

[36:22] He retracted what he sent me and I don't know what he said.

[36:26] I don't know what he said.

[36:27] He could have been like, Chris, congratulations on baby Cassian.

[36:31] He could have made some statement.

[36:32] He could have told me to f off.

[36:34] I don't know what it was.

[36:35] I don't know what it was for the rest of my life.

[36:38] I will still be wondering what it is that George Gomez said to me.

[36:42] I want to say something that George Gomez right now because I respect George Gomez.

[36:47] I do.

[36:48] I think his company is being led astray by Seth Davis.

[36:51] I do.

[36:52] Every time I see Seth with that big grin, cool.

[36:55] You've made yourself money and you've destroyed the golden goose.

[36:59] I just want to say this to George Gomez.

[37:00] George, you got to lower your prices.

[37:03] You got to stop.

[37:04] A thousand John Wick L.E.s is arrogant and it's just not going to work.

[37:08] You need to start listening to what I'm saying and what my fans are saying and stop living

[37:14] in this tunnel vision.

[37:15] I know you think you're going to expand pinball in places like Asia and you're going to get

[37:19] enough new millionaires into the mix.

[37:22] But George, for every one new sucker you're going to attract with these prices, you're

[37:28] going to lose five of your loyal customers that have been supporting your company all

[37:33] these years and the writing is on the wall.

[37:36] I don't think you have the right marketing team in place to figure that out.

[37:39] I really don't because I think the problem with marketing is sometimes you only go to

[37:44] the people you want to hear from.

[37:46] Where real marketing happens is when you figure out how to convert people who are cynical

[37:53] and on the fence and I don't think Stern is doing that.

[37:56] I think they're absolutely abandoning everybody who's now become a little bit cynical and

[38:02] skeptical of their moves and I don't think Seth Davis is one of us.

[38:07] I don't think Seth Davis could ever do a Facebook live with Canada.

[38:11] I don't think Seth Davis could ever be interviewed by me and come out looking good.

[38:17] I don't.

[38:18] I don't.

[38:19] It's just they can't answer one simple question.

[38:23] How is a Foo Fighter topper $2,000?

[38:26] How?

[38:27] How is it the price of four Xbox machines?

[38:30] How?

[38:31] How?

[38:32] How is it the price of four PlayStation fives?

[38:35] You just can't answer the question.

[38:37] You just can't.

[38:38] You can't say, well, because the demand is there.

[38:40] Wouldn't there be more demand for Foo Fighter topper if it was $1,000?

[38:44] Wouldn't you sell five times as many?

[38:47] I'm going to have some coffee breaks, people, because I've been going straight for 44 minutes.

[38:52] All right.

[38:54] All right.

[38:55] So dead on arrival.

[38:57] You know, Genghis, they didn't sell out.

[38:59] Like Foo Fighter toppers, they make a few of them and they sell out and then this is

[39:04] what they do and then they don't make them for a while and then they justify that as like,

[39:08] see, look, I can't do.

[39:10] I can't go glasses for 45 minutes and take them off.

[39:13] I got too much glare.

[39:14] I'm like, I'm like squinting.

[39:15] I got it.

[39:16] I either got to start with my eyes can and just.

[39:18] All right.

[39:19] I'll come back.

[39:20] Another show without glasses.

[39:22] Let's talk about Fun House.

[39:24] Here's the thing.

[39:25] Like amongst all this John Wick, like dead on arrival game, you know, dead on arrival

[39:31] game, there's other companies out there trying to make moves.

[39:36] So let's start with barrels of fun.

[39:38] All right.

[39:39] Let's start there.

[39:40] Let's go around the horn for a little bit and talk about everybody.

[39:42] Barrels of fun.

[39:43] They did apparently a great factory tour of their facility, right?

[39:51] They get a pizza party.

[39:52] Now what they didn't do was give people like a heads up.

[39:55] It was going to happen.

[39:56] And I wish they would have because I would have loved to have joined live and talk to

[40:01] them and promoted this whole thing.

[40:04] They didn't for some reason give any heads up.

[40:07] They were doing it, which, you know, is what it is, but I'm still happy.

[40:10] They did it.

[40:11] I'm very happy that no, don't podcast by the window.

[40:14] That's funny.

[40:15] I'm very happy that they were very transparent about how many games they've made so far,

[40:21] how many games they're making on a good day, on a good week, and the total number of labyrinth

[40:27] machines they've sold.

[40:28] Now here's the thing.

[40:29] I'm going to just say this right now.

[40:31] I love all of that.

[40:33] I still think they picked a bad theme.

[40:37] I still think labyrinth, not a good theme.

[40:40] Now not a terrible theme by any means.

[40:43] It's absolutely not like they sold 700, but it goes to show you they probably should have

[40:49] said we're only making 750 labyrinths.

[40:52] If they said that they're spot on, right?

[40:55] They would have been dead bullseye in the world of marketing.

[40:59] You want to make one less of your product than there is demand.

[41:05] That's the sweet spot.

[41:06] One less.

[41:08] If we make one less than there is demand, guess what there will be?

[41:12] There will always be demand.

[41:14] Now the more than one less, even better, right?

[41:17] Because then there's even more demand.

[41:19] When you announce you're making 1100 and you sell 70 or 750, you now have 400 more supply

[41:33] than there is demand.

[41:36] That's a marketing mistake.

[41:39] They probably had to set that number of 1100 because of just cheaper, but I don't know.

[41:47] I don't think they're going to make 1100.

[41:48] I don't know how they're going to get 400 more people to bite the bullet because what's

[41:53] going to happen by the end of the year is people who went in early will sell their games

[42:00] for cheaper and they'll become available.

[42:03] I just think there is that reality.

[42:06] That being said, it's game number one.

[42:09] It's really good that they are showing people transparency.

[42:13] It's good that they're executing on a manufacturing level.

[42:18] That is the most important thing.

[42:21] When you can showcase that you are manufacturing on an efficient level, no one's getting ripped

[42:28] off, nobody's losing their deposits.

[42:30] They're not lying to everybody like Damian and Marty.

[42:34] They're actually executing.

[42:36] That is how you start to build trust.

[42:37] It's how you start to build confidence.

[42:40] It's not surprising.

[42:41] These guys, or most of them are ex-spooky guys.

[42:42] They know how it works.

[42:44] They've seen the boutique success story, which is spooky, and they've obviously left spooky

[42:50] for personal reasons.

[42:53] They're doing their thing.

[42:55] As I've said recently, the future of pinball is boutique.

[42:59] If you think the future of pinball is mass produced, expensive games, think again.

[43:05] The future of pinball will be boutique companies that can make between one and 2,000 a year,

[43:12] in which they make maybe one to two at most games a year.

[43:17] That's all the world will be able to absorb because there are hundreds of thousands of

[43:23] games already in people's homes.

[43:26] People are out of space, and most people are out of money.

[43:31] There's not room anymore.

[43:32] There's not room anymore at all.

[43:35] I just got a text from Ralph Lauren.

[43:37] I wish you could read this.

[43:39] Your linen trousers from Ralph Lauren are ready.

[43:44] I'm super excited to show you those trousers, people.

[43:47] That's it.

[43:48] The future is boutique.

[43:49] I think the future is looking good for barrels, for spooky, for dutch.

[43:54] I think it's looking good for CGC.

[43:58] CGC, I don't know.

[43:59] They just operate.

[44:00] It's looking terrible for American.

[44:02] We'll talk about American in a little bit.

[44:04] It's looking terrible for Haggis.

[44:06] It's looking terrible for pinball adventures.

[44:10] I don't know what to do with Chris Turner's company.

[44:14] I don't know how to even talk about it.

[44:17] He's not doing anything wrong, but he's really not doing anything right.

[44:21] He's just kind of there.

[44:22] It's kind of like for the guy that wants something that nobody else has.

[44:26] That's really the only angle with Ninja Eclipse.

[44:29] If we talk about them for a second, it's like, I don't know why Chris Turner didn't just

[44:35] make Raza.

[44:36] I get all the history of Raza, but man, at least you spent all that money getting the

[44:42] IP, and so much money was spent coding Raza, and at least it had some prominence, or I

[44:51] don't know, like infamous nature or identity in the pinball world, and it doesn't make

[44:56] any sense to start all over with an original IP, charge $6,994, and expect people to buy

[45:07] it.

[45:08] It's just too difficult to do that.

[45:11] That's where we're at with Ninja Eclipse.

[45:13] He's a nice guy, Chris.

[45:16] If I could give him any advice, theme matters.

[45:20] Theme matters.

[45:21] There's no market anymore for $7,000 pins because this is the mistake they all make.

[45:28] They all think, if I make a game $7,000, I'm making an attractive entry level game that

[45:38] people will buy.

[45:39] The mistake in that is that Ninja Eclipse is now competing with a used Adams family,

[45:48] like Twilight Zone, like every single great game from the 90s.

[45:53] They're now competing with every single Stern premium that came out over the last like 10,

[45:58] 15 years.

[45:59] Like it's just, there's too many good games that you can get for $7,000.

[46:02] You're competing with every single game that is $7,000.

[46:10] The only way Ninja Eclipse and Turner Pinball makes sense is if there was a government law

[46:17] that you could only buy a new and box game that's new.

[46:23] If you want to buy a pinball machine, you have to buy something this year.

[46:26] You're not allowed to buy an older game.

[46:29] That's the problem.

[46:30] They all get this tunnel vision because they see all the new companies charging all this

[46:35] money and they're like, well, I'm going to make a game that's half the price of Elton

[46:39] John.

[46:40] Cool.

[46:41] But you can go get a guns and roses for $7,000.

[46:45] That's the problem is you don't have to, you don't need to get a new Ninja Eclipse.

[46:51] You can go get a used GNR.

[46:53] I don't understand how nobody even thinks this way.

[46:58] To me, this is just common sense.

[47:00] If I walked in and like, what are we going to make?

[47:01] We're going to make this.

[47:02] It's not going to work.

[47:03] It's not going to work.

[47:04] Team Pinball, when they made that mafia game, they came to me.

[47:08] They're like, how would you sell this?

[47:09] This won't sell and there's nothing I can do.

[47:12] I think there's a lot of decisions that were made during COVID.

[47:15] Jengas, I agree man.

[47:17] I think what we're seeing right now, everything that's happening in Pinball right now was

[47:21] a decision made during COVID, like Funhouse.

[47:25] Let's talk about it.

[47:26] 750 Funhouse games.

[47:30] I'll tell you why.

[47:31] You haven't seen a video, a real video yet from Padredy of the game being played because

[47:39] when you watch Funhouse being played on 2.0 code, it's not that exciting of a game to

[47:46] watch being played.

[47:49] Funhouse was made in the 90s to be on location, to give you a little bit of Pinball fun for

[47:55] a few minutes.

[47:57] That's what it was made for.

[47:59] The 2.0 code is not that great.

[48:03] It's beautiful looking.

[48:04] Don't get me wrong.

[48:05] Funhouse is really beautiful looking, but as a home ownership game and 750 at $10,000,

[48:15] I just think it's really going to struggle to sell.

[48:20] The reason why I'm like, this launch is weird to me is the one thing they're not doing is

[48:28] showing you gameplay.

[48:30] That's the one thing that, I don't know.

[48:33] It's weird because most people's minds have already been made up on Funhouse gameplay

[48:38] and Funhouse code.

[48:40] The whole thing now is art package, modern lighting, and the 2.0 code.

[48:48] In a world in which most Funhouses can be had for $5,000 to $6,000, it's not going to be

[48:57] a quick sell out.

[48:58] It's not going to be a game that's going to fly off the shelves.

[49:02] I just think it's tough.

[49:05] It's tough.

[49:06] That is why more now than ever, there's going to be a lot of pressure on these companies

[49:12] to get it right and to do market research and to really start to pull the community on

[49:19] what they want to see.

[49:20] I don't really know if any of these companies even know how to do that.

[49:24] I think they just think if you build it, they will come.

[49:28] They are dreaming and I think they're living in a field of dreams.

[49:32] If they think they can sell $7,000 Ninja Eclipses and $10,000 Funhouses and $13,000 John Wicks

[49:41] and $15,000 Elton Johns, it's like, it's feel the dreams.

[49:46] It's feel the dreams, people.

[49:47] You might as well walk into the outfield and watch your money disappear into the corn

[49:52] stocks because it's just not going to work.

[49:56] It's just not going to work.

[49:59] What I love about what's happening right now is I love it.

[50:03] I love that we're at this crossroads.

[50:04] We're at this inflection point where our love of pinball is amazing.

[50:10] None of us are falling out of love with pinball.

[50:14] Watching what these pinball companies do to try to get our money is to me the most fun

[50:20] and entertaining thing because their assembly lines need to keep going.

[50:25] There's 15 pinball companies that need to make new games every year.

[50:29] As a consumer, I love this.

[50:31] Now there's 15 movie studios.

[50:34] I love movies.

[50:35] Now there's 15 movie studios that want me to go see a movie.

[50:39] The problem now in pinball is every movie ticket is $50.

[50:43] It's like, oh man.

[50:45] To get me to spend $50 on a movie, you're going to need to bring out total recall in

[50:52] IMAX with special guest star Jean-Claude von Damme who's going to do a flip kick and

[50:59] blow up the A-Team van as he jumps out of a G.I. Joe carrier jet.

[51:04] To get me to spend this money on the thing I love, you need a banger.

[51:11] You need a banger.

[51:12] Everyone's crying next door.

[51:13] I think they're listening to this show.

[51:15] That's the thing.

[51:16] It's so much fun to watch this.

[51:18] When you join Canadian Club and you're hanging out with the Canadian Club fan members, I

[51:22] call them Canadians.

[51:23] I mean, that's all we're doing.

[51:25] We're just making fun of all these efforts because when these efforts come up short,

[51:30] you just grab your popcorn, you start chomping away, and you watch all the shill content

[51:36] creators like fire blanks at us.

[51:38] Like, oh, I love pinball.

[51:39] But yeah, but you know what I love more than pinball?

[51:43] Money, family vacations, right?

[51:47] I love driving cars.

[51:49] This pinball, once a few pinball machines cost as much as a fun automobile.

[51:55] It's like we've lost the narrative.

[51:58] We've lost the narrative.

[52:00] When you pop the hood on these modern Stearns and these modern JJPs, they don't want you

[52:05] to do it.

[52:06] They don't want you to do it.

[52:07] They don't want you to pop the hood.

[52:08] Can you imagine?

[52:09] It's a great analogy.

[52:10] I know John Erlich's always like, the game's above the wood, and it's fun, Chris, and you're

[52:15] not allowed to pop the hood on these games.

[52:17] Can you imagine, let's use a car argument.

[52:20] Let's use a car argument.

[52:21] So imagine all these years, like Ford's putting a V8, supercharged V8s in its Shelby's, and

[52:30] you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you love it, like the feel, the sound, the

[52:34] engineering, it's beautiful.

[52:37] And what do car guys always say?

[52:38] Pop the hood.

[52:39] Let me see what's under the hood.

[52:41] Let me see what's driving this experience.

[52:45] And so the same is true for pinball.

[52:47] Look at the hood.

[52:48] Look at the hood.

[52:49] Look at all that stuff.

[52:50] Look at all those mechs.

[52:51] Look at all those coils.

[52:52] Look at all those subways.

[52:53] Look at that bowling alley in Big Lebowski.

[52:55] Pop the hood.

[52:56] What's causing all this fun?

[52:58] There it is.

[52:59] Look at all that engineering.

[53:00] Look at all that work.

[53:02] Look at all that innovation.

[53:03] And then you get to modern pinball, and you're like, yeah, it's fun to shoot.

[53:07] Pop the hood.

[53:08] Nothing under there.

[53:09] Nothing under there.

[53:10] It's the reason why electric vehicles are dying.

[53:14] Nobody wants to spend anything on electric vehicles.

[53:17] They're just as fast.

[53:20] They might be fun.

[53:21] I don't think there's as much fun.

[53:23] They do what needs to be done, but then you pop the hood and there's nothing.

[53:27] There's nothing.

[53:29] And that's what's happening with modern pinball.

[53:31] They've actually become like EVs, right?

[53:32] They've taken all the mechanics out, and now it's all just lights.

[53:37] What's up, Eric Peterson brother?

[53:38] How you doing?

[53:39] How you guys feeling, man?

[53:40] We've got only 10 stars.

[53:43] How can we only have 10 stars?

[53:45] Don't make me giveaway trans lights.

[53:48] Don't make me do it.

[53:49] Don't make me giveaway trans lights.

[53:51] I'm not going to do it.

[53:53] You guys can keep your stars today.

[53:54] I'm just too happy being a new father.

[53:57] Let me talk a little bit about that because it's been a crazy week.

[54:01] I'll give you guys the story.

[54:04] We had a scheduled induction on Tuesday, and Brenda was really nervous about that.

[54:12] And inducing a woman to give birth is a terrible experience for a woman.

[54:19] Imagine trying to force the body to do something before it's ready to do it.

[54:26] It's like trying to buy a John Wick LE at $13,000.

[54:30] Your body just doesn't want to do it.

[54:32] Imagine if there was a medical drug that forced you to spend $13,000 on a John Wick

[54:39] LE.

[54:40] Imagine how much pain you'd be in watching that $13,000 leave your wallet and going

[54:48] to a distributor.

[54:50] You'd be screaming the way a woman screams in a painful labor.

[54:54] That's the equivalent of a John Wick LE purchase.

[54:56] You like that metaphor.

[54:58] You can use it for free again.

[55:01] They were going to induce Brenda on Tuesday.

[55:03] We were really nervous about this.

[55:06] Her last Killian was born with an induction.

[55:09] It was an 18-hour labor.

[55:11] It was really painful.

[55:13] Epidurals and all the drugs they pump you with make your pregnancy and your labor really

[55:20] terrible.

[55:21] And for two weeks, it takes for all those drugs to get out of your system.

[55:26] And so a miracle happened.

[55:28] It was Monday morning.

[55:32] It was 4 AM.

[55:36] And I was up.

[55:37] I was up.

[55:38] I was making trollish pinball content, talking to dudes in Australia about pinball, making

[55:45] some stupid cover photo, making fun of these companies.

[55:48] It's 4 AM.

[55:50] And Brenda comes in and says, I think my water just broke.

[55:55] And it did.

[55:56] And luckily, right near the bathroom, so like water breaks.

[56:00] 4 AM.

[56:02] Killian is sleeping next door.

[56:04] And Brenda is just like, I don't know if you've ever witnessed this.

[56:07] But the pain, when those contractions start, it's painful.

[56:12] And so I'm like, Brenda, I couldn't go with her to the hospital right away because I had

[56:18] to stay here with Killian.

[56:19] Now we had a whole system in place.

[56:21] We have a group of friends that were ready on a moment's notice to come by and watch

[56:26] Killian so Daddy could go to the hospital.

[56:28] So Brenda was like, well, this could last like an hour or two.

[56:31] We've got time.

[56:32] And I was watching her in excruciating pain.

[56:36] And I'm like, I'm getting your Uber right now.

[56:38] I ordered her Uber.

[56:39] I put a street fighter blanket underneath her in the Uber and said, take her to the hospital.

[56:45] Good news is the hospital's two blocks away.

[56:48] And the Uber driver like helped get her into the hospital.

[56:52] Our friend got here in like 10, 15 minutes.

[56:55] It's like 4.45 in the morning, right?

[56:58] I get to the hospital like 5 AM-ish.

[57:01] Brenda, they're out of delivery rooms, right?

[57:04] They're out of delivery rooms.

[57:06] And so they have to bring Brenda into the ER and everything she wanted, the labor she

[57:12] wanted, she didn't get it.

[57:14] Like she didn't want to be in her back.

[57:15] She didn't want to be in stirrup.

[57:16] She read all this stuff about how to do different kinds of labor.

[57:20] And no, like within 30 minutes, this little baby Cassian was in her arms and I've never

[57:26] seen a woman so strong and so powerful as watching Brenda go through the pain of labor

[57:35] with no pain medication.

[57:37] They couldn't give her any pain medication.

[57:40] And that is why I am so happy that I sold Batman SLE.

[57:46] Every penny of that game is going to furniture and other items for the new home we have.

[57:54] And I'm so happy to spoil Brenda with some of the most amazing furniture and whatnot.

[57:59] And when you walk into our home, it's going to be beautiful.

[58:02] And I couldn't feel happier with where that money's going to go.

[58:08] And so we have been just home for a few days.

[58:11] I now have eight weeks off of paternity leave.

[58:15] I get 12 in total.

[58:17] I'm going to take eight right now and then four later on.

[58:21] And what that means for all of you out there.

[58:23] As you can tell, not only is there not an interruption of Canadian pinball podcast, there's actually

[58:29] been an increase in content because as baby Cassian sleeps and I'm on duty, duty, right?

[58:38] Heroes duty.

[58:39] I can do a show.

[58:41] I can do a Facebook live.

[58:43] Like I could read up on what's going on in the hobby.

[58:46] And so I'm actually going to have more time than less time because Killian's at daycare

[58:52] and I've got the most amazing wife ever.

[58:55] And I feel so blessed.

[58:56] And I want to say this, you know, like I talk a lot about this hobby and these companies

[59:02] and these games.

[59:03] And I think what I love about my show and my community is it's a mixture of pinball and

[59:09] life and what we're all going through on this journey of life.

[59:13] And I've, you know, like I've met some amazing people through pinball and I've had Vista

[59:18] Cuffs with other people and as much as we like will come to blows and, you know, throw

[59:23] jabs at each other, I think you got to have some thick skin if you're in the pinball

[59:27] content space.

[59:28] It just is the way it is.

[59:29] I think the people who are in it, who've been in it for a long time all have thick skin

[59:34] and you got to roll with the punches.

[59:36] You know, I don't like to ban people.

[59:38] I don't normally ban or block anybody.

[59:40] You know, none of the people that I talk smack about, they're not blocked.

[59:43] They can come here and say whatever they want or jump on the show whenever they want.

[59:48] I did have to ban or block Neil McCray from my Facebook page this week and I'll tell

[59:52] you why I blocked Neil McCray.

[59:55] And I like Neil.

[59:56] Neil's a good guy.

[59:57] Neil's a really good guy.

[59:58] He's a pinball aficionado.

[59:59] But the reason why I blocked him, it's not because he insulted me and said I have no money.

[01:00:04] I know Neil's a very wealthy individual.

[01:00:08] It's not because of that.

[01:00:09] The reason I blocked Neil is one simple reason, is that Neil adjusted his Facebook account

[01:00:18] so that when he comments on my page, I can't reply to his comments.

[01:00:24] So he's almost like he's put me on ignore on my own page.

[01:00:29] And I've asked him multiple times not to do that.

[01:00:32] I happily accept all of his feedback, all of his criticisms, but I don't want to have,

[01:00:38] I can't have a conversation with Neil if he won't allow me to reply to him on my own

[01:00:43] page.

[01:00:44] And so that is instant block.

[01:00:47] If you want to come into my house and have a one-way conversation with me, I'm not going

[01:00:52] to let you.

[01:00:53] It's not because he hasn't donated, even though he's got so much money.

[01:00:57] It's simply because of that.

[01:00:59] So we miss him around here.

[01:01:01] We miss him.

[01:01:02] I don't think there's any other page that is this much fun.

[01:01:05] I know all week long, you know, the Canadian content is great.

[01:01:09] And if it gets turned off, I know you're going to miss it.

[01:01:12] So look, and just tell this to Neil, just tell this to Neil.

[01:01:16] If you change that, you're back.

[01:01:20] That's it.

[01:01:21] You're back.

[01:01:22] Okay.

[01:01:23] I don't know why he did it.

[01:01:29] But I want to say, I want to say this.

[01:01:31] I know that life is getting really expensive for everybody.

[01:01:34] Doesn't matter if you're Bill Brandis or Neil McCray.

[01:01:37] The world's gotten kind of crazy, right?

[01:01:40] Everything's so expensive.

[01:01:41] And I think when you talk about pinball and you cover this hobby, I think you need to

[01:01:47] cover it, zoomed out a little bit, right?

[01:01:50] You got to, like you got to understand how much everything is costing now for people and

[01:01:55] families, right?

[01:01:56] I really do believe this.

[01:01:57] I think most of you who buy pinball machines, you might be single, you might have a family,

[01:02:02] but no matter who you are, you're not immune.

[01:02:05] You're not immune to what the market and the world is going through.

[01:02:08] And you also are not immune to what other people are going through, even if it's not

[01:02:12] you.

[01:02:13] And that's an important factor in life.

[01:02:15] Like you could go through life and just spend thrift your way on things that bring you joy.

[01:02:21] And I'm not asking you to donate your money to those in need, but I also think there's

[01:02:25] a little bit of like a pulling back, if you will, of unnecessary spending on unnecessary

[01:02:32] items, even if you have unnecessary amounts of money, right?

[01:02:37] And I don't begrudge anybody who has money and I don't care if you worked for your money.

[01:02:43] I don't care if you inherited your money.

[01:02:46] I don't care if you made a lucky bet on Dogecoin three years ago.

[01:02:50] If you have money, great, I'm happy for you.

[01:02:52] Like I want to see all my friends successful and happy.

[01:02:57] I don't care.

[01:02:58] I don't think you need money to be happy.

[01:02:59] I really don't.

[01:03:00] I think what you need to be happy are a few things in life.

[01:03:03] I think you need really, really good people around you.

[01:03:08] I think that is the key to happiness in life.

[01:03:11] Like you need good family, you need good friends.

[01:03:15] And the other thing is this, to be really happy, you don't need a lot of those people.

[01:03:19] You don't.

[01:03:20] You know, I noticed this in my pinball world.

[01:03:21] I've got 707 paid subscribers.

[01:03:26] If I were to think about how many of those people do I actively engage with on a daily,

[01:03:31] weekly basis?

[01:03:32] It maybe is like the same 30 cast of characters.

[01:03:36] And I always find that so rewarding that somewhere out there, there's like 670 people

[01:03:44] that I don't even know about that are getting weekly joy and entertainment from my show.

[01:03:51] And I love that.

[01:03:52] I love that.

[01:03:53] At one point, those people could reach out and engage me further and spark up more conversation.

[01:03:59] And I would always be all the years, you know me, everyone who knows me knows me.

[01:04:04] The moment you reach out to me, I'm getting back to you.

[01:04:06] I'm not ignoring you.

[01:04:08] I'm not leaving you hanging.

[01:04:09] I love to talk about this with everybody.

[01:04:12] You don't need that many people though, but you need people you can trust.

[01:04:15] You need people that will be loyal with you and go through the journey of life with you

[01:04:21] a little bit.

[01:04:22] And that's why having a good partner in life is everything.

[01:04:25] The other thing is, I think we're in a world and we're definitely in a country where there's

[01:04:30] just overconsumption is really the name of the game.

[01:04:35] Everything we do in excess, especially in America.

[01:04:38] There's like this whole system here set up for it.

[01:04:42] In other countries with taxes and they're more socialistic, which I don't agree with.

[01:04:46] I'd rather me have the ability to spend my hard earned money on what I want to spend

[01:04:51] it on without the government taking a cut for doing nothing.

[01:04:56] The government taking a huge cut for doing nothing is kind of like a distro making $2,000

[01:05:01] for drop shipping an Ellie game to your door.

[01:05:04] And then explain to me what hard work you're doing on that drop ship.

[01:05:07] What are you doing?

[01:05:08] What are you doing?

[01:05:09] I get it every once in a while.

[01:05:10] A game gets damaged and you got to deal with an irate customer and now you have to give

[01:05:14] your haggis consumers like I don't know the run around.

[01:05:18] But for the most part, the majority of those games, you're making money for nothing people.

[01:05:22] Okay, that's like, that's the government.

[01:05:24] That's the government.

[01:05:25] They make money for nothing.

[01:05:26] Half of my pinball podcast revenue has gone to the United States government.

[01:05:31] Thank you, Joe Biden.

[01:05:32] I don't know what you did, but you got half of my podcast earnings.

[01:05:36] Okay, so, so like, you know, I think a lot of us are starting to realize that the overconsumption

[01:05:43] and having too much of anything, whether it's pinball machines, automobiles, blazers, watches,

[01:05:51] like it's not going to make you happier.

[01:05:55] There is a point of diminishing returns on all of this, right?

[01:06:00] Even having too many kids won't make you happier, right?

[01:06:02] It's just, it's just the way it goes.

[01:06:05] And I think what's really interesting about pinball is this item is an item that really

[01:06:11] does take up a lot of physical space.

[01:06:15] It's not an out of sight, out of mind product you own, right?

[01:06:20] You could buy a bunch of watches and stick them in a drawer and not feel like, why do

[01:06:27] I have all these?

[01:06:28] Because you won't see it every day.

[01:06:30] You're going to see the cars.

[01:06:32] You're going to see the children.

[01:06:34] You're going to see the pinball machines.

[01:06:36] So I think there's just a lot of people waking up and I think there's a lot of people re-appreciating

[01:06:44] the great machines you have.

[01:06:47] And this has been a really thing that's been on my mind a lot lately is I think there's

[01:06:51] just, you know, there's a weird thing happening where like Stern doesn't want you to only

[01:06:57] want to own what you own.

[01:06:59] They want you to look at the product like a drug where you need the next hit.

[01:07:06] The content creators that are driven by their love for the manufacturers or their loyalty

[01:07:14] to their distributor friends, think about what their goal is.

[01:07:19] Their goal is to get you to want to buy something new, right?

[01:07:24] It's just like, that's the goal.

[01:07:27] It's like, yeah, like they're reviewing the game, but like you got to see how thinly veiled

[01:07:33] all of it is.

[01:07:34] And it's fine.

[01:07:35] Like I want to see content creators jump on a new machine, have fun with it, this and

[01:07:40] that, you know, but like ultimately, if you see like the source of all of it, a lot of

[01:07:47] it leads back to trying to like help these companies sell games, help these distributors

[01:07:53] sell games.

[01:07:54] And like I get it, but I don't think expanding pinball comes from any of this.

[01:08:00] I think expanding pinball comes from introducing people to how much of a great game you can

[01:08:07] get for a great cost.

[01:08:10] Like I got introduced to pinball with a Lord of the Rings, Ellie for $7,000.

[01:08:17] That is what I spent on it.

[01:08:19] And it was amazing.

[01:08:21] Like that was probably one of the most amazing games ever I've ever owned.

[01:08:27] And it didn't cost me the price of a car.

[01:08:30] And I spent $7,000 on an LE.

[01:08:32] I did a lot of research.

[01:08:34] I asked the community, what's a great game if you're going to have one game in your home?

[01:08:38] And I loved that game.

[01:08:40] Right.

[01:08:41] I loved it.

[01:08:42] Nowadays, it's a $15,000 game, probably, if you can find one.

[01:08:49] And the ability to like discover this hobby at a good amount of money with a deal, it's

[01:08:56] over.

[01:08:57] Is baby Cassie coming in?

[01:08:58] Oh my God.

[01:09:00] Can I show baby Cassie into the world, babe?

[01:09:03] All right, ladies and gentlemen, he's going down.

[01:09:09] This is it.

[01:09:10] The future of pinball podcasting.

[01:09:12] Hi, buddy.

[01:09:13] Hey, buddy.

[01:09:14] Did you cancel your job?

[01:09:16] Yeah.

[01:09:17] Okay.

[01:09:18] Sweet dreams, Cassie.

[01:09:19] He's going into the snow.

[01:09:20] It's it.

[01:09:21] It's it.

[01:09:22] You know, I think about like $13,000 on a John Wick or $13,000 in an S&P 500 fund for that

[01:09:42] kid.

[01:09:43] $13,000 of NVIDIA stock for him.

[01:09:48] $13,000 of McDonald's stock of Netflix, right?

[01:09:53] And no brainer and no brainer.

[01:09:57] You know, and I want to tell him those stories.

[01:09:59] When you were born, your dad had the world's number one pinball podcast, right?

[01:10:03] And his main message was don't buy pinball.

[01:10:05] Can you just think about that for a moment?

[01:10:08] How do you become the world's favorite pinball podcaster?

[01:10:12] You don't really play pinball.

[01:10:14] You don't play in tournaments.

[01:10:18] You get on the airwaves and you tell people not to buy the product and you are the number

[01:10:23] one pinball podcast in the world.

[01:10:27] You know, you got it like, gang, I mean it when I say it, that you got to understand what

[01:10:31] that means and why people value it.

[01:10:35] It's because people value honesty, people value that you're kind of looking out for

[01:10:42] them.

[01:10:43] They also just value what's important in life.

[01:10:46] And I've said this and I'll say it again.

[01:10:47] My show is therapy.

[01:10:49] Canadian pinball podcast is nothing more than a weekly therapy session with a lunatic guy

[01:10:55] in New York City.

[01:10:56] And some people might listen to me and, you know, make fun of me and think I'm an idiot.

[01:11:00] And that makes them feel better about being who they are.

[01:11:03] And I'm happy to be the clown, you know, the jester in the corner.

[01:11:06] That's some people.

[01:11:08] Other people.

[01:11:11] Hold on.

[01:11:12] Killian, say hi.

[01:11:13] Killian, say hi.

[01:11:15] Get in here.

[01:11:16] Can you say hi?

[01:11:18] Mommy's...

[01:11:19] Killian.

[01:11:20] No, don't, don't, don't.

[01:11:24] Stop!

[01:11:25] I don't like you!

[01:11:28] I think Killian just captured what everyone's been feeling for the last 10 years.

[01:11:33] Stop.

[01:11:34] I don't like you.

[01:11:36] I love it.

[01:11:37] I love it.

[01:11:38] I love you.

[01:11:39] I love you.

[01:11:41] So I think it is a lot of it is therapy.

[01:11:44] A lot of it is just entertainment.

[01:11:45] And look, I look gang, it's entertaining.

[01:11:47] Like this is all meant to entertain.

[01:11:49] And I think more than ever, the show has been the most entertaining it's ever been.

[01:11:55] I think whenever a bad game comes out, my subscribers go up, right?

[01:12:02] Because think about it.

[01:12:03] When it when a dud like John Wick hits the market, who do you want to hear talk about

[01:12:07] it?

[01:12:08] I mean, it's real simple.

[01:12:09] You could listen to the shill, the shills like jam it down your throat, like try to

[01:12:15] see the good in it, right?

[01:12:18] So you can make them money while they pass the loss on to you.

[01:12:22] Or you can listen to Canadian.

[01:12:23] That's like, yeah, man, like I'm seeing what you see.

[01:12:26] That game is not worth the money.

[01:12:28] Stern's on a panic tour.

[01:12:30] And this game is like dead on arrival.

[01:12:32] And they know it.

[01:12:34] They know it.

[01:12:35] So go play one on location, have your fun and go home with $13,000 in your checking account.

[01:12:43] Well I have recorded the stop.

[01:12:45] I don't like you.

[01:12:47] And you know, look, I think this year is going to be so awesome to watch because we're going

[01:12:51] to see the collapse of a broken business model.

[01:12:57] Stern is not panicking.

[01:12:58] I don't think Stern's panicking Bill overall.

[01:13:01] I think they are panicking on John Wick sales.

[01:13:04] Absolutely Bill.

[01:13:05] Bill, you got to look at the circus, the three-ring circus they've turned on, trying to get John

[01:13:12] Wick sales.

[01:13:13] See Bill, Stern's, overall, Stern's fear is that they're going to reach a point where

[01:13:22] the distros and dealers are going to say no.

[01:13:26] And when that happens, when that happens, because guys, you don't understand what Gary

[01:13:31] does.

[01:13:32] Like, and I've heard this from distros and dealers.

[01:13:34] He calls them up and basically is begging them to place orders.

[01:13:39] You know?

[01:13:40] No, Bill, when it was the last time, Bill, you saw Stern turn this much marketing on

[01:13:46] for a game.

[01:13:48] This is like, this is way more than it's ever been before.

[01:13:52] And it's also not helping them that the designer is not doing any interviews.

[01:13:57] It's also not helping them that George Gomez thinks a Foo Fighter topper is worth $2,000.

[01:14:03] The game's not selling.

[01:14:04] You know, I just talked to, I'm not going to name names, I just talked to a distributor.

[01:14:08] They haven't sold any of these.

[01:14:09] Haven't sold any.

[01:14:11] It's not selling.

[01:14:13] You know, so like, I don't know, maybe a few distributors have loyal customers who take

[01:14:18] every LE and, you know, I just really can't wait to the end of the year when we start

[01:14:24] to see Nuenbach's John Wick games for sale for like $9,000.

[01:14:27] I mean, it's just, it's like, you know, it's like John, you know, John Wick saw Venom selling

[01:14:33] for nothing and was like, hold my beer.

[01:14:34] I mean, that's what's happened with this game.

[01:14:38] It's going to locations.

[01:14:40] Yeah, guys, Stern bullies their distros.

[01:14:43] I carry.

[01:14:44] Thank you for saying it.

[01:14:45] I mean, people don't understand what Stern does to its distros.

[01:14:50] It is, they are a mafia.

[01:14:52] You know what the mafia does?

[01:14:54] They let you set up business.

[01:14:56] Right?

[01:14:57] That's what the mafia does.

[01:14:58] Like, like, literally, this is what the mafia does.

[01:15:00] They go into a town where business owners are making money and they say, if you want to

[01:15:07] continue making money, you got to pay us a cut.

[01:15:10] And this sound a lot like what Stern does.

[01:15:14] If you want to stay in business as a dealer and a distro, you got to buy this many games

[01:15:19] or we're going to put you out of business.

[01:15:21] Because what we're going to do is just stop giving you games.

[01:15:24] If you don't buy this many of every LE, you're going to lose your allotment.

[01:15:28] So if you don't buy 20 John Wick's, you're not going to get 20 Jaws LE's.

[01:15:34] And that is what happens.

[01:15:37] Every single launch gang.

[01:15:38] And the other thing that Stern has done is this gang.

[01:15:41] This is where they're really effing over people.

[01:15:45] They're signing up way more dealers than they've ever had before.

[01:15:50] Because think about it.

[01:15:51] If you're a Stern, every dealer is your customer, not you, not me, not Brenda, not Kylian, not

[01:15:57] Cassian.

[01:15:58] Every dealer is your customer.

[01:16:00] So if you can have a thousand dealers around the world and then if they just each buy one

[01:16:08] LE, you'll sell out of your LE's every single time.

[01:16:13] So that is what Stern does.

[01:16:17] And the more they introduce more dealers, think about it.

[01:16:22] That eats into the livelihood of the existing dealers and distros.

[01:16:27] But they don't care.

[01:16:28] Why would they care?

[01:16:30] Why would they care?

[01:16:31] Let's just say you're a Stern dealer and you make, I don't know, quarter million dollars

[01:16:36] a year doing this on the side, or maybe it's your full time thing.

[01:16:39] You make a quarter million dollars a year and then Stern opens up 25 new dealers, lowers

[01:16:47] your allocation and you go from making quarter million to a buck 50.

[01:16:54] They don't care.

[01:16:55] All they care about.

[01:16:56] Why would they care about you?

[01:16:58] You're not a dealership, like a normal dealership.

[01:17:01] It's not like Chevy sells its cars to Chevy dealerships.

[01:17:05] They don't sell their cars to Hyundai dealerships.

[01:17:08] And when you look at these pinball distros, think about it for a minute.

[01:17:11] They're all kind of like used car dealerships.

[01:17:14] No one's an exclusive only Stern dealership.

[01:17:18] It's weird to me, right?

[01:17:19] It's like these dealers, it's strange.

[01:17:20] They're all selling everything for the most part.

[01:17:24] Selling everything.

[01:17:25] Can you imagine trying to stay in business if, you know, that's called a used car dealership.

[01:17:31] So Stern is like basically giving product to someone who's also advocating for its competitor

[01:17:36] product.

[01:17:37] Like where does that happen?

[01:17:38] Right?

[01:17:39] I mean, it happens at like, you know, Trinot's and watch stores.

[01:17:42] And that's kind of like more like pinball than a car, right?

[01:17:44] I mean, it's kind of where the car dealership analogy doesn't work.

[01:17:48] And that's fine, right?

[01:17:49] It's like, you got a bunch of different watch manufacturers selling in one location.

[01:17:53] And that's how pinball is different than cars.

[01:17:56] But what's happened recently is dealers have a lot of money tied up with both Stern products,

[01:18:04] Jersey Jack products.

[01:18:06] This seemed to be the two where dealers have a lot stockpiled.

[01:18:13] And the prices of those products has been obliterated on the secondhand market.

[01:18:19] So these guys, I know, I know I'm popping on my mic.

[01:18:25] I know, I know I'm mic popping.

[01:18:27] I get it.

[01:18:28] I know you're going to like, there's going to be some mic popping.

[01:18:31] I will get better at it, but it is what it is.

[01:18:34] Am I blocking my face?

[01:18:37] I don't know.

[01:18:38] I'm hearing popping in my ears, but you know, it is what it is.

[01:18:39] It's not it's not a perfect show when I do the Saturday morning audio, but this will

[01:18:43] sound better.

[01:18:45] But that's where we're at.

[01:18:46] You know, there's there's a lot of behind the scenes that if you knew about it, I don't

[01:18:51] think you'd treat these companies with such kid gloves like you do.

[01:18:55] But I also don't think most people do.

[01:18:56] I don't think most people care.

[01:18:57] I mean, like I got nothing personal against any of these companies.

[01:18:59] I just want to see them put the best world under glass for the best price with the best

[01:19:05] themes.

[01:19:06] And that's what everybody wants.

[01:19:08] That's what we're looking for.

[01:19:10] And every week, every month, you know, we get to make up our minds on whether or not we

[01:19:15] see that in the current inventory or the current lineup of games that are out there.

[01:19:22] I think it's going to be a brutal year for a lot of people that made plans during COVID.

[01:19:27] I don't think 500 Alice in Wonderlands are going to sell out.

[01:19:32] I don't think 750 fun houses are going to sell out.

[01:19:36] I think if Stern brings back Metallica, you know, at 9,500, I don't know, you know, I

[01:19:43] just don't know.

[01:19:45] I don't know.

[01:19:46] I think the only surefire hit is going to be back to the future.

[01:19:51] If you were to ask me, I think Dutch pinball is sitting on what I believe to be the only

[01:19:57] true guaranteed it is happening.

[01:20:01] Take my money now game.

[01:20:03] I don't think Jersey Jack's next game is the Matrix.

[01:20:08] I think it's the Muppets.

[01:20:10] And I think it's going to be interesting to see, you know, if it has enough.

[01:20:16] What is going in Jersey Jack's favor right now is their, their package and their presentation

[01:20:23] and now with good flipper feel and good gameplay, they make a stunning machine.

[01:20:29] They make an absolutely stunning machine.

[01:20:32] Jersey Jack machines look three times the price of a Stern machine.

[01:20:37] I say this without even hesitation.

[01:20:41] I say this without doubt.

[01:20:43] If there's any machine out there that can even closely justify the cost, at least the

[01:20:49] Jersey Jack machine just looks and feels and like just, you know, now look, have they,

[01:20:57] did they get stupid with the pricing?

[01:20:58] Yes, they did.

[01:21:00] They did.

[01:21:01] Like again, because if the bomb is 4500 or 5000, they just got stupid.

[01:21:07] You know, it just, it's just, it's just, they went a little crazy with the pricing and they

[01:21:10] also went stupid with the supply, right?

[01:21:12] If they only made Elton John 500 CEs, I think it's a much different, you know, response

[01:21:19] to it.

[01:21:20] But right now, I went on pin side, there's just dealer after dealer with them available.

[01:21:26] But Muppets, eh, Matrix, yeah, Harry Potter, yeah, for the most part, right?

[01:21:31] Unless it's like Wizarding World and it gets weird.

[01:21:34] But I think it's going to be really interesting, right?

[01:21:36] Because I think we all want to see just more for the money.

[01:21:41] I mean, it's not, it's not a lot to ask for.

[01:21:44] I'll tell you this right now and then I'll stop the show.

[01:21:46] I'm going to use a car.

[01:21:47] My car, my Dodge Demon, I bought it for 86000.

[01:21:52] It's probably worth like a buck 20 now.

[01:21:55] It's got 5000 miles on it.

[01:21:57] My Demon crate got destroyed in a flood.

[01:21:59] I have to get another one one day, but I don't even care.

[01:22:01] I'm not selling it.

[01:22:02] I'm never selling the car.

[01:22:03] I'm giving it to Killian.

[01:22:04] It says on the sticker and on the, the vent that this car was personally made for, for

[01:22:10] me.

[01:22:11] It's kind of cool, right?

[01:22:13] It's like, it's like Adam West saying your name.

[01:22:16] So I'm going to keep it.

[01:22:19] But it, you know, it's probably worth $130,000.

[01:22:21] It's fun.

[01:22:22] Man, it's not, you're not really driving the Demon.

[01:22:24] It drives you.

[01:22:26] It does a lot.

[01:22:28] It's a roller coaster ride.

[01:22:30] The new car I'm getting, I'll share later what I'm getting.

[01:22:33] It's 34,000 plus 3000 for all the like, you know, the fees and processing.

[01:22:39] It's about a 37, 39,000 car.

[01:22:42] You have to add on some tax and stuff like that.

[01:22:45] Not very powerful.

[01:22:46] Not, you know, but it's going to be more fun than the Demon, but it's cheap.

[01:22:52] Right?

[01:22:53] It's like, it's going to be more fun than the Demon, but it's cheap.

[01:22:55] And I think what is, what is interesting about pinball is nothing is cheap.

[01:23:02] And so then like, not only does the game have to be fun, it has to be so much better than

[01:23:07] what you currently own, or you're not going to put it in your house.

[01:23:12] And this hobby can't survive on location play only.

[01:23:16] So really interesting time to be in pinball.

[01:23:18] Gang, we are, we are at the 90 minute mark.

[01:23:23] I know it started a few minutes late.

[01:23:25] I do want to say thank you.

[01:23:26] I want to thank each and every one of you for being a member of the Canadian club, over

[01:23:31] 20 new members in the past like week alone.

[01:23:36] And you know, it means a lot to me.

[01:23:38] I don't, I don't say this because I'm pandering or trying to, I mean this.

[01:23:44] Every, everyone who subscribes like your donation and your support, it means a lot.

[01:23:50] And now, you know, with all of the expenses, things going on in our world, it also is going

[01:23:56] to help us a lot.

[01:23:57] Yeah, it doesn't hurt.

[01:23:59] It just doesn't hurt.

[01:24:00] And when I was, when I was like filling out my application for the car, I'm just going

[01:24:06] to finance it a little bit, but pay it all off in six months.

[01:24:09] That's how I roll.

[01:24:10] Just get a little bit of debt, get your credit score higher and just knock off the note quickly.

[01:24:15] I could buy it outright, but I just don't, you know, I don't want to want to get a little,

[01:24:18] a little, little credit for this.

[01:24:21] I, I had more pride in putting down what my ancillary income was with the podcast than

[01:24:29] I did even my main job.

[01:24:32] And I think that's the biggest thing that I've ever done is out of everything I've ever done,

[01:24:37] this I've earned more than anything.

[01:24:39] I feel like I've earned my other job too, but, you know, I've, I've really taken a lot

[01:24:45] of arrows when I did this show the way I did it and I made moves the way I did it.

[01:24:51] And for two years, people insulted me, made fun of me, you know, and they did.

[01:24:55] And like, like they're not living rent free in my head.

[01:24:57] I don't think about these guys.

[01:24:58] I'll tell you why.

[01:25:00] I look at the community that is part of Canadian pinball podcast and I look at nobody

[01:25:05] else's, nobody else's content or community or Patreon attempts with any envy.

[01:25:12] In fact, I actually am happy to see everybody follow suit and I am, and I really am.

[01:25:17] That is, they still don't have the courage to fully do what I did is take it all behind

[01:25:22] because, you know, when you go all behind bill, bill, bill, here's the bill.

[01:25:30] Um, I, I love people who challenge me, bill.

[01:25:35] Um, I also love people who have dogs and cats as their profile photos.

[01:25:41] I'm sure if I went to your site, bill, it'd be a bunch of, you know, pet photos.

[01:25:45] Um, bill, until you pick up the mic, you know, do a show, try to entertain people for even just an hour.

[01:25:52] I always say this, like, whenever people, you don't understand what it's like to do the amount of hours,

[01:25:57] the amount of work.

[01:25:58] I know I make it seem easy, but it's a lot more work than you realize.

[01:26:01] So bill, as I'm giving, you know, speeches of sentiment, it would be nice not to be interrupted with a heckler,

[01:26:09] but it is what it is, bill.

[01:26:10] I'm not going to block you.

[01:26:11] Don't worry.

[01:26:12] Um, no, but the moment you go fully behind, you absolutely, you absolutely will find out what you got,

[01:26:23] who will follow?

[01:26:25] Will anybody follow?

[01:26:27] You know, and it's great.

[01:26:30] And I'm very thankful for that.

[01:26:32] And I think that what's happened with this Canadian club and with everybody here is everyone else is looking at it and, you know, they made every move they could to try to take away the legitimacy.

[01:26:45] They ruin the award shows forever.

[01:26:47] I mean, those are done.

[01:26:48] I'm not going to do any more award shows, by the way, people.

[01:26:50] I made it my mind not going to TPF, not doing more award shows.

[01:26:55] Like as far as I'm concerned, the people who killed those awards, they can live with that, but they ruined what brought a lot of people joy and happiness and pinball.

[01:27:06] And it was a, it was a, you know, it was a colluded effort to do that just so I couldn't say I'm the world's favorite pinball podcaster.

[01:27:15] And guess what?

[01:27:16] I sit on the iron throne by myself.

[01:27:18] I won it six years in a row.

[01:27:20] Nobody else.

[01:27:21] Nobody else.

[01:27:22] Right.

[01:27:23] And that's it.

[01:27:24] That's it.

[01:27:25] That's the way you, that's the way you go out.

[01:27:28] Right.

[01:27:29] I mean, it would have been nice to see just, you know, one person beat me once, but, you know, it is what it is.

[01:27:36] Everybody from the bottom of my heart, from my family, from for, for like all that you do, I know things are expensive.

[01:27:43] I will never raise the price of my show.

[01:27:46] I will never force anybody to give more.

[01:27:49] And I will always deliver the most consistent, the most entertaining, the most timely, the most relevant pinball content.

[01:27:56] And you, you best believe it's not stopping.

[01:27:59] It's only going to keep getting better.

[01:28:00] So everybody have a great Saturday from my family to yours.

[01:28:04] We love you guys.

[01:28:05] We love you for tuning in for the 15 or 18, we get about like 1800 people watch this after the fact for the 1800 of you that watch this at some point over there.

[01:28:15] Thank you.

[01:28:16] I do, I do love you hanging out here.

[01:28:19] And even if we don't agree and even if you think, you know, I flip flop or I play all the sides, it is fine.

[01:28:25] You know, it's like, it is what it is, you know, and, you know, we'll get Neil McCray back.

[01:28:29] He'll make his adjustments.

[01:28:30] He's a tech guy.

[01:28:31] He knows what he did.

[01:28:32] And everybody namaste, you know, namaste, it's Shigo Ichi.

[01:28:37] It's Shigo Ichi, you know, dwelling the present.

[01:28:40] We're never going to get today back.

[01:28:42] And because of that, you're never going to get this 90 minutes back.

[01:28:46] And you should have been doing something better than listening to Canada rant about pinball and stern.

[01:28:50] Everybody peace out, John Wick, DOA, stern marketing, flat line, flat, it's funny, flat line, George Gomez.

[01:28:56] Who can we go to?

[01:28:57] And when here's the final part, I heard stern is inviting a whole new level of pinball media to come play John Wick.

[01:29:04] They didn't invite Canada, but this they're going to try.

[01:29:07] They're going to try to get this in front of as many people as possible.

[01:29:09] It's not going to work.

[01:29:10] It doesn't matter how many people you invite to a movie that's not great.

[01:29:15] It's not going to change the word of mouth on the game.

[01:29:18] And they should they should know better.

[01:29:20] This game is not going to have a word of mouth turnaround.

[01:29:22] It's just not.

[01:29:23] And everybody knows that.

[01:29:25] Oh, it's awesome to witness.

[01:29:26] And I'm just in the corner like, I don't know.

[01:29:29] Hey, look, Chico, this guy just bought a le.

[01:29:32] He just lost $4,000.

[01:29:34] Look at this.

[01:29:35] Think about it.

[01:29:36] If everyone who buys an le at 13,000, a thousand of them, what's 4,000 times a thousand?

[01:29:43] $4 million in money will be evaporated from the pinball buying community.

[01:29:50] If you buy a John Wick le.

[01:29:51] Good job, Stern.

[01:29:52] Nice market research.

[01:29:54] You got it wrong.

[01:29:55] Canada's pinball.com.

[01:29:56] It's going to bring you down.

[01:30:01] It's making it a 14.
