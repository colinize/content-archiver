[00:00] I only need you just a little patience.

[00:05] Well, you may be wondering what we're doing back on the airwaves when I said I wasn't

[00:16] going to do another show until Friday, but then I realized that the black knight was being

[00:20] streamed on Dead Flip tonight.

[00:23] And you know me, I have to do a podcast whenever some breaking news happens in Pimball, so

[00:28] you're going to get a little mini episode of Canadian Pimball podcast, and I hope you

[00:32] enjoy it.

[00:33] But before I do that, a couple things I want to talk about.

[00:35] First and foremost, I want to talk about the music mix that hopefully you've been rocking

[00:41] out to.

[00:42] And I want to just clarify something for all of you out there that that mix was put together

[00:47] by no other than my twin brother.

[00:50] And you might be thinking, what is he talking about?

[00:53] Yes, I have an identical twin brother.

[00:56] His name is Alex.

[00:57] I know that he listens to this show because he won't stop commenting on the SoundCloud

[01:03] page that he put the mix together.

[01:06] And so I am sorry, Alex.

[01:08] I did not take credit for the mix.

[01:09] So you are the music mastermind in the family.

[01:13] So if you want to have a Canadian Pimball podcast monthly music mix that you're, if you're

[01:20] enjoying the one now, let me know.

[01:23] And I'll ask my brother, Alex, if he'll make one each month for you guys to sort of rock

[01:28] out to because I love it.

[01:30] I think music is actually a lot more fun than Pimball.

[01:33] And you know, it's a lot cheaper to listen to good music than it is to buy these Pimball

[01:38] machines.

[01:39] So I just want to clarify that.

[01:40] So he just gets off my back about it.

[01:43] I also want to talk about, let's see, I've been getting emails asking me, did you break

[01:50] the NDA with Jersey Jack?

[01:52] Like how dare you reveal what the next title was?

[01:56] You know, I'm hearing other Pimball podcasters, Chris, and they're not saying what the title

[02:00] is.

[02:01] They're saying it's JJP number five.

[02:03] And you know, how could you do that?

[02:05] And let me tell you something.

[02:06] I told Jack straight up, Jack, I'm gonna let people know it's Willy Wonka.

[02:10] And here's why because my last five podcasts before going over to Jersey Jack Pimball was

[02:15] stuff like, Wonka's coming this week.

[02:18] Wonka price revealed.

[02:20] Everything was Willy Wonka.

[02:21] I was not going to go over there and come out and say JJP number five.

[02:27] And I'm here to tell you JJP number five is Willy Wonka.

[02:31] We also have Jack promoting the entire day with yellow, you know, golden tickets and colorful

[02:39] guy, you know, never ending gop stopper like Pimball is like, everyone knows what it is.

[02:45] What I did not do is give you details, specific details on the game.

[02:50] I'm absolutely going to let the design team walk you through those and show you the game

[02:56] for the first time.

[02:57] And I think you're going to be excited.

[02:58] So there's that now, don't you love, don't you love threads like the canadas Wonka campaign?

[03:08] And I don't really understand why there are so many people who seemingly hate me, hate

[03:15] what I stand for.

[03:17] You know, think I'm the the the the scourge of the earth that I am the worst thing to ever

[03:22] happen to Pimball.

[03:23] And he's just this terrible man and we have to do everything we can to rid Pimball of this

[03:29] guy.

[03:30] And I'll never listen to his stupid podcast and yet those same people, they seem to know

[03:36] a an awful lot about the show and they clearly listen to every single episode of canadas

[03:43] Pimball podcast.

[03:45] And can we step back for a moment and just think about the ridiculousness of one simple

[03:52] thing, grown man on an internet forum talking about Pimball who are terrified that another

[04:02] grown man would join them and talk about Pimball, right?

[04:07] The banning of canada from Pinside almost as if like his presence there just destroys

[04:15] the entire Pimball hobby.

[04:18] All right, and look, we don't have to relive the past.

[04:20] We don't have to have revisionist history of anything.

[04:23] I apologize for every mistake I've ever made, but the problem with the internet these days

[04:29] and the problem with a lot of the people who live on the forums, they don't care who you

[04:35] are in real life.

[04:36] If they don't care if you apologize, you're never, you're never going to be innocent of

[04:42] previous mistakes in their eyes.

[04:44] You're always just going to be that bad person and they think in that one moment in which

[04:51] you upset them in a thread, right?

[04:53] That one moment in which you downvoted something they said, that's all it takes.

[04:59] According to them now, you're just the bad guy forever.

[05:03] And so that is the current state of how most internet forums behave these days.

[05:11] And so look, it's not like I'm trolling Pimball when I was on that forum, right?

[05:16] Someone who trolls a forum.

[05:18] And look, I am the best troller of forums in the world.

[05:23] But here's the thing, trolling a Pimball forum would be like going in there and absolutely

[05:29] shitting on Pimball, making fun of Pimball people.

[05:33] It's not like I was going in there and saying Pimballs for losers like video games is where

[05:37] it's at.

[05:38] Like what do you chumps doing here?

[05:39] No, no, that's what a troll does, okay?

[05:44] And look, attention seeking every one of you out there who's on Pinside every day, ask

[05:49] yourself, why are you posting, why are you bothering posting most of what you post?

[05:54] People post for the attention.

[05:56] They like to say something, they like to connect with people on the hobby, but they also like

[06:01] the attention that their sentiment receives.

[06:04] And that's what makes forums fun.

[06:06] And I don't think it's a bad thing.

[06:08] I don't really care.

[06:10] That's the other part too is how much of your life revolves around this stuff.

[06:14] Is it everything?

[06:15] Is it a little bit?

[06:16] Is it a lot?

[06:17] For some of you out there, it's a lot more than it probably should be.

[06:21] And for me, Pimball to me is an outlet.

[06:24] It's an outlet in which I have fun.

[06:26] I do love the hobby.

[06:27] I'm very passionate about the hobby.

[06:29] I met some incredible friends, lifelong friends in this hobby around the world, around

[06:35] the world, guys in Australia, guys in Europe, guys in Canada, guys in Florida, guys in Texas,

[06:41] guys in Chicago, it's awesome.

[06:43] It's so cool that this hobby is open the door to so many amazing people.

[06:47] But I'll say this, I'll say this, Pinside has a sort of a policy of being nice to people.

[06:54] I will say this, the amount of personal attacks I get, just personal attacks, just literally

[07:02] directed right at me in a hurtful and harmful manner, it's incredible.

[07:07] They don't moderate any of it.

[07:09] They don't care.

[07:10] It's like, and that's fine.

[07:12] It doesn't get to me.

[07:13] It really doesn't.

[07:15] But I just think it's kind of crazy that they allow all those personal attacks to take

[07:20] place.

[07:21] When I talk on this podcast, and if you listen to this show, this is not a podcast about

[07:26] personally slandering people and going after people, when I've gone after individuals,

[07:32] I've attacked them because of the work they've done in Pimball.

[07:36] I've attacked the business decisions they've made with their Pimball companies.

[07:41] It's not personal.

[07:43] I'm not calling these people egomaniac, sociopaths, manic depress, and all that stuff.

[07:50] If I was that asshole, if I was that jerk, if I was that loser, that has no fashion

[07:57] sense, all the terrible things and then some that they say about me, I have just one

[08:02] question for all you haters out there.

[08:05] Then why do so many people enjoy the show?

[08:09] Why do they enjoy our take on Pimball and why do they come back week after week?

[08:15] And why did they vote this their favorite Pimball podcast two years in a row?

[08:19] And for all of you out there who have such an issue with me, it's real simple.

[08:23] Go grab a mic, put on a headset, and record your version of a Pimball podcast and let's

[08:29] see how successful it is.

[08:31] All right.

[08:32] I'm up there on stage congratulating all the other nominees and all my fans for voting for

[08:37] me.

[08:38] And you're just in the back, booing, canada.

[08:39] Let's get over it all and just accept the fact that we have an interesting take on Pimball

[08:44] that a lot of people love.

[08:45] Now speaking of interesting take on Pimball, let's talk about the black night.

[08:49] All right.

[08:50] So what I want to do is I want to give you what I liked, what I didn't like about the

[08:57] stream, and then my overall assessment of the black night sort of rage.

[09:03] Is that is that good?

[09:04] Okay.

[09:05] Now we must start this with the ultimate caveat, which is I have not flipped the Pimball

[09:11] machine, which is more than just a caveat.

[09:14] That is a humongous issue when you are giving your first impressions of a game.

[09:20] And so by that, I mean, this is not my first impression of playing the black night.

[09:26] This is simply an observation of what I saw today and the thoughts that popped into my

[09:32] head as I watched the stream.

[09:35] Okay.

[09:36] So do not, do not take whatever I say on this show and make your decision on whether or

[09:42] not to buy this game unless you flip it first.

[09:46] Okay.

[09:47] I think it would be pretty silly and pretty stupid to determine your buying decision on what

[09:54] you hear on this show.

[09:56] And again, I'm just saying I'm not here to like slam the game by any means.

[09:59] I just want everyone to know I look forward to flipping it and I'm very jealous of you

[10:04] guys who are going to MGC because you are going to play a couple of the brand new hot titles

[10:10] back to back at the same show.

[10:12] It's going to be really awesome to see people's feedback after they hop on both Willy

[10:18] Wonka and the black night.

[10:19] All right.

[10:20] So let me go down my list.

[10:21] I'll do my observations and then I'm going to end this shorter episode of Canada's

[10:26] Pimball Podcast.

[10:27] How does that sound?

[10:28] All right.

[10:29] All right.

[10:30] Here we go.

[10:31] What I liked and what I didn't like about the black night stream.

[10:34] I did like that it started on time and the dead flip stream with Jack Danger is just

[10:41] stellar.

[10:42] It's just awesome.

[10:43] I'm glad it started when it was supposed to.

[10:45] The last thing, the last time I saw them flip a game for the first time, I think it was

[10:48] like months ago.

[10:49] There was like a delay, but it was right at 5 p.m.

[10:52] Like they were, they were live five on the dot.

[10:55] That was awesome.

[10:56] And I have to say, Jack and his team, they do a great job.

[11:00] The quality of how they set up the cameras and everything and the mic and everything, awesome

[11:04] awesome.

[11:05] All right.

[11:06] Now, you've got this game, you black night, you've got this like heavy metal like rock concert

[11:12] about the start, about to explode, right?

[11:15] You're waiting for the powder keg to go off.

[11:17] You know, you got the anthrax guitarist, you got everything ready to go and then all

[11:21] of a sudden they start.

[11:23] All you want to do is see the black night flip for the first time from the king, Steve

[11:27] Richie, who's the king of flow, right?

[11:30] That's all about how his games shoot.

[11:32] And the first thing they do is they yank the glass off and I have to say it felt like

[11:38] I was suffering through that part of the stream at the very beginning in which Tim takes

[11:43] the glass off and is explaining the game by using his, you know, hand to throw the ball

[11:49] around the play field to show us what does what.

[11:53] And this isn't the first time, this isn't, this isn't just Tim who does this.

[11:57] This is something that I see time and time again where you just want to see the game first.

[12:02] Just flip the game first, show us how it shoots.

[12:06] You almost want the first time you see it to be reflective of what a real experience would

[12:13] be like when you walk up to the game for the first time.

[12:16] You don't walk up to a game and then like a guy takes the glass off and then just start

[12:20] showing you everything.

[12:21] I don't know, I just think they need to stop this.

[12:23] I think Stern needs to learn that you can do it and you can do that on the stream.

[12:28] But maybe that's another video that they create in which Tim and Steve walk you through

[12:33] how to play the black knight.

[12:35] And I would, I would release that after they do the initial stream with Jack Danger.

[12:40] But it's just such a, it's such a like bum bummer way to like start off the stream.

[12:46] And I don't know, I was just like flip the freaking thing.

[12:49] All right, enough of this.

[12:50] I also hate it when they give away too much before you, you see the game.

[12:54] I mean, you want to leave some of it to be a mystery, right?

[12:56] All right.

[12:57] So what else did I like?

[12:58] I liked the music and there is no way around how awesome this music in the game sounds.

[13:06] I mean, it is totally, totally one of the most kick ass music packages I've ever heard

[13:12] in a pinball game.

[13:14] I mean, it is incredible.

[13:15] It is like, it just, it just, you just like, it just hits you like a freight train.

[13:20] And it's just this wall of guitars and it's like the sound and the energy, you know,

[13:25] combined with like everything else going on in the game.

[13:27] It is like being dropped into the middle of like a heavy metal sword fight.

[13:32] I felt like and it was just, it's just awesome.

[13:35] And it sounds awesome.

[13:37] And I think everyone who who was able to like secure the anthrax guitarist and everyone

[13:42] who put the music into the game should take a bow because the music is just freaking dope.

[13:48] All right.

[13:49] And it didn't like is this though.

[13:51] After 30 minutes, the repetition of that heavy theme song almost made me want to pull my

[13:57] hair out a little bit.

[13:59] And here's what I was like, the problem is this.

[14:02] It's so high energy.

[14:04] And it's just like, didn't, didn't, didn't, you know, the shredding like it's like, it's

[14:07] so high energy and it's so like in your face.

[14:10] And it's just like, it's like volume 11.

[14:12] It's like you're in the middle of like the greatest guitar solo of all time.

[14:17] And it like hits you immediately.

[14:19] And then it hits you over again and over again and over again.

[14:22] And that like that energy is already happening before you even plunge the ball.

[14:27] And I think that repetition might be a little bit of a problem.

[14:31] It's really cool in trailer videos.

[14:34] It's really cool.

[14:35] The first few times you see it and hear it in the game.

[14:38] But my that's one of my issues is it's like there's no like building up to that kind

[14:44] of energy.

[14:45] It just starts with it.

[14:47] And maybe that's what they want it, right?

[14:48] Drop you right in.

[14:49] Boom, boom, boom.

[14:50] Like you're in the, it's like, it's like you're parachuting into, you know, the middle

[14:53] of like a heavy metal warfare and I get it.

[14:57] I get it totally higher energy.

[14:59] But then I look at, I was thinking about the way like Alice Cooper music is also really

[15:03] high energy.

[15:04] But the way that game begins, the way you're introduced into the world isn't like that.

[15:11] And it's completely opposite.

[15:12] So a little bit creepy or like introduced into the world of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[15:18] You know, this one's just like, and I don't know.

[15:21] I don't know if you want to walk through a door every time and have that kind of crazy

[15:25] loud shredding going off in your ear.

[15:29] But I get it.

[15:30] That's the theme.

[15:31] I just, I'm not sure if that's going to be seen as like repetitive and grating for

[15:35] people.

[15:36] I don't know.

[15:37] We'll get old.

[15:38] We'll see.

[15:39] We'll see.

[15:40] All right.

[15:41] What I liked.

[15:42] I liked the animation in the game.

[15:44] Now, you can't, you can't look at this game and say that Stern is not really improving

[15:49] how they incorporate animations into a pinball machine.

[15:52] What I liked a lot about the animations was just the fact that I think Stern is really

[15:58] learning and getting it right in terms of how much information you can put up on a screen

[16:05] during a pinball experience that's fast and furious like the black knight.

[16:09] You can't have a lot.

[16:11] You can't communicate a lot.

[16:13] For the most part, I did like that the animations tend to focus on a primary thing, whether you're

[16:19] in a mode and you're battling like an enemy.

[16:22] It's just that enemy, right?

[16:25] You hit, you hit like the right shot and all of a sudden you see the enemy being hit

[16:28] and it cuts to that animation.

[16:31] I liked that a lot.

[16:32] I think they're getting the animations down to the point where like it's perfect for

[16:36] the integration in the LCD and Stern machines.

[16:40] The graphics are good.

[16:41] They're good.

[16:42] They're good for pinball.

[16:44] That leads me to what I didn't like.

[16:46] What I didn't like was this.

[16:48] Somehow I think pinball people, when they talk about animations and they talk about graphics

[16:54] and they talk about what can be on an HD screen.

[16:57] Somehow I think pinball people are still stuck in 1998.

[17:03] It's almost as if when they use phrases like, and I heard Tim say this, it's state of the

[17:08] art graphics that you're going to see.

[17:10] There is nothing, nothing that you are seeing in black night sort of rage animations that

[17:17] is state of the art.

[17:19] It's almost as if none of these people have played a video game over the last 20 years

[17:23] and actually seen what state of the art animations now look like.

[17:29] But you know, look, that's the thing about pinball people.

[17:32] It's like they're stuck.

[17:34] It used to be DMD.

[17:36] So to them, this is like the greatest animations there ever have been in a game ever.

[17:42] I don't feel like these animations are the best animations ever in pinball.

[17:46] They are good.

[17:48] They are really good.

[17:50] The other word I just kept hearing people say over and over and over again on the stream

[17:54] was like, oh man, it looks sick.

[17:58] I kept hearing that word sick.

[18:01] Really guys, like, have none of you played anything after a PlayStation 2?

[18:07] Sick.

[18:08] Man, this game's sick.

[18:09] It's got six sound.

[18:10] Oh, those animations are sick.

[18:12] It's annoying, right?

[18:13] It's annoying when I say it.

[18:14] Well, how annoying is it to freaking read that and then look at the animations and like,

[18:19] they're good.

[18:20] They're good.

[18:22] We are not in this state of the art.

[18:25] Sick realm of animations.

[18:27] Okay.

[18:28] I know that a lot of you need to just wake up and realize and go see what sick animations

[18:33] look like in 2019.

[18:35] All right.

[18:36] All right.

[18:37] What else did I like?

[18:38] I like the light show.

[18:39] The light show is very cool.

[18:41] When they first turn the game on, it's really cool to see the attract mode in a pinball

[18:45] machine.

[18:46] You can do so much cool stuff with attract modes and showing the way the different lighting

[18:50] system will work and how all the different inserts will light up with the different colors.

[18:55] I really, really need light showing the game.

[18:57] I love the sort of the full RGB color lights as they went up and down.

[19:02] You know, they went around the big circle wheel with the lightning bolts.

[19:06] Very, very cool light show.

[19:08] Very, very cool.

[19:09] What I didn't like, and this isn't really like a didn't like, but I just not as impressive

[19:14] as the light show was just the art on the game.

[19:17] And I think the play field art in this game is pretty spartan next to what we've seen

[19:24] recently from the likes of zombie Yeti and Christopher Fransche.

[19:29] It's not bad art.

[19:30] It's just not nearly at the same level as the art we've seen in some recent games, especially

[19:36] the monsters and iron made in and Deadpool.

[19:40] But I also think that might have been what they've been going for us because if you look

[19:44] at the older black night games, there's absolutely like not a lot of detailed art, right?

[19:50] You know, the detail is all in like the shot layout and the geometry and the upper playfield.

[19:55] Like that game is all about that.

[19:57] It's not really about like detailed artwork on the play field, all right?

[20:00] So, but the cabinet art is great.

[20:03] And there's a lot more detail in the back box and cabinet art.

[20:06] So you know, I just wish there was a little bit more detail in the play field art, but

[20:10] again, not a huge thing.

[20:11] All right, what else did I like?

[20:13] I did like the black night in the middle of the game.

[20:16] The mechanism was cool.

[20:18] He's very neat to look at.

[20:20] He's really interesting, same with the flail going back and forth.

[20:23] I think, you know, what I like is I like looking down at a pinball machine and seeing a big

[20:29] toy smack dab in the middle of the game that I can interact with, that the ball interacts

[20:35] with that actually brings the theme of the game to life in a physical 3D way.

[20:40] I really like that.

[20:41] It's really cool.

[20:42] I got really excited when I saw the video today of the game on the line and even like the

[20:47] size of that black night, he's much more imposing when you see him in real life on a video,

[20:53] then when you see some of like the images we got when the game was first revealed.

[20:58] Okay.

[20:59] Okay.

[21:00] So I like that.

[21:01] Here's what I didn't like about the black night.

[21:03] I was expecting a bit more drama from him.

[21:06] I felt like the toys looks really cool, but I didn't feel this like real like the sense

[21:12] of that you're really battling him.

[21:15] Like the I was expecting something more like the ball to come out that flail just much

[21:19] harder and the ball to come off the shield much harder.

[21:22] I didn't get the same sense that maybe maybe it speeds up more later in the game.

[21:27] That might be the case.

[21:28] Again, remember, having flipped this, I'm just going off the stream, but I didn't really

[21:33] feel like the black night became like, you know, like it was like this wow moment when

[21:39] you're watching the ball like interact with with the black night itself.

[21:42] Like it's almost like he was cool to look at then to interact with.

[21:46] And then even like I'll go through a little bit the later on like the pro and the L.E.

[21:50] The difference is, but I also felt like the black night was like taken out of the action

[21:54] a lot when it came into the upper play field, you know, being where the ball goes the most

[21:59] of the time when you get to the premium L.E. version of the game.

[22:02] All right.

[22:03] Let's see what else did I like and not like I like the callouts in the game.

[22:08] I think Ed and Steve Richie did a great job on the callouts.

[22:11] They're really cool.

[22:13] So congratulations guys.

[22:14] I didn't like the fact that there is no R rated like at all mode in this game.

[22:19] And I get it.

[22:20] Stern doesn't want to occur.

[22:21] So is in, but it came like this like heavy metal thrash or music like who's going to buy

[22:26] this game.

[22:27] This isn't like a family theme at all.

[22:29] And I just felt like they missed a little bit of an opportunity to have some more like

[22:34] prof profane or profanity in the game.

[22:38] You know, you're seeing some of the visuals where some of these monsters are getting limbs

[22:41] are getting cut off and whatnot.

[22:43] I think they really could have done some fun sort of more mature callouts for, you know,

[22:48] for the, you know, the adults out there who want to turn that on.

[22:52] You know, these are guys drinking beer.

[22:54] They're swearing like drunken sailors in their game rooms all night long.

[22:58] And yet the games are all PG.

[22:59] I mean, they're PG like you have this incredibly dark theme.

[23:04] And then it's a PG version of the movie.

[23:07] I don't know.

[23:08] I think Stern needs to, needs to realize like who their target is a little bit more and

[23:14] sort of have a little bit more flexibility there.

[23:16] All right.

[23:17] I liked, and this again, this is based on today.

[23:20] I liked reading everybody's comments on the Twitch stream.

[23:24] It's always fun to watch the video live while people are writing questions into the designers

[23:30] and to Tim and to the Stern team.

[23:33] And even just talking to each other, it's a lot of fun to read that.

[23:36] What I don't like is those comments go by it like at a million miles an hour.

[23:39] Like it almost just gets stupid at a point where they had like two to three thousand people

[23:44] watching this live, which congratulations, by the way.

[23:46] I think this is one of the most watched live streams of a game that I've ever seen,

[23:53] dead flip do's.

[23:54] So congrats.

[23:55] It was awesome having all those people.

[23:56] The downside is you can't track the conversation at all.

[24:00] And it's bad for a troll like me because I can't, my jokes weren't coming through.

[24:04] I was saying some funny stuff on there.

[24:06] Nobody was responding to me.

[24:08] And so I tuned out because all I want is attention, right?

[24:11] All right.

[24:12] I like seeing the pro versus the L.E.

[24:15] What I didn't like is I walked away feeling like the pro is the way to go on this.

[24:20] And that's weird.

[24:21] And we're going to talk about that a little bit in my overall assessment of, you know,

[24:24] the game and what I saw today.

[24:26] So let's jump right to that.

[24:28] Here's my overall feelings on this game and the stream today.

[24:34] Right?

[24:35] Again, this is all with a caveat that I did not play the game yet.

[24:38] All right.

[24:39] Okay.

[24:40] So here's the first thing I felt today.

[24:41] I felt that, you know, I'm still just trying to figure out if the monsters has it as a

[24:46] pinball game.

[24:48] And now I have to figure out if black knight is a game that has it, you know, in terms

[24:53] of being a great pinball experience.

[24:55] Sort of like eating lunch and someone asks you what you want for dinner immediately

[25:01] after.

[25:02] You know, can we get a little bit more time between the releases?

[25:06] And I did feel that today that I'm a little bit like almost like fatigued by the sheer

[25:11] number of new pinball machines.

[25:14] And it's getting harder and harder and harder.

[25:16] I don't know about you.

[25:18] It's getting harder and harder and harder for me to look at all of these games regardless

[25:21] of who they come from, whether it's October Fest or Willy Wonka or Black Knight.

[25:26] It's harder for me to approach any of them without, you know, a level of like, I've seen

[25:33] so much I've been there.

[25:35] I've done that.

[25:36] You better wow me or I'm really not going to like be that interested in your offering.

[25:42] You know, five years ago, six years ago, any new pinball machine was looked at.

[25:48] I think with a lot more excitement, a lot more enthusiasm, just because we were happy

[25:54] that there was like some options out there in the world.

[25:57] And now that there are so many options, I can't help but look at everything with a little

[26:02] bit more, not maybe cynicism, but just I'm a little bit more critical of everything I

[26:08] see and it has to wow me, right?

[26:11] All right.

[26:12] What else did I think about today?

[26:13] So if you love the Black Knight, like if you love the theme of the Black Knight and you've

[26:17] own maybe one of the previous two games or you just played them, you know, over the years,

[26:22] I don't see how you don't get this game, right?

[26:26] They literally made this game for you, right?

[26:30] You should feel blessed because Stern doesn't do this like ever.

[26:34] All right.

[26:35] This is the power of Steve Richie, the king of pinball.

[26:38] He was able to get them to make a game, which is definitely Stern's like biggest risk

[26:43] in a long, long time.

[26:45] And if you are a Black Knight fan, I mean, this

[26:47] this is it.

[26:48] This is your, this, this game is like your game on a silver platter that they made for

[26:53] you for the fans of the Black Knight series.

[26:56] And if you have one or two or like again, I just don't see how you don't go in on it,

[27:01] all right?

[27:02] Okay.

[27:03] I also felt like it had a very similar vibe to, vibe to Iron Maiden.

[27:08] It felt a lot like I was playing or you know, or witnessing of Iron Maiden being played.

[27:14] And I don't mean, you know, I know the shots are different, but, but stick with me here.

[27:18] Just like the music and the flow and the speed.

[27:21] And I just felt like it was very similar to the kind of like visceral experience that

[27:26] Iron Maiden brought to the pinball world.

[27:28] Like high energy, fast shots, unique layout.

[27:31] And I'm not that this has like the biggest unique layout.

[27:35] But I almost wish, I almost wish like I could combine the two games because it did, it

[27:39] did to me feel like both of them are like these heavy metal pinball experiences.

[27:44] But what's the one thing?

[27:46] What's the one thing missing from Iron Maiden that we've been saying the whole time?

[27:50] Iron Maiden just doesn't have like that toy, like the singular toy that you interact

[27:55] with that really makes that game sort of stand out a little bit more, right?

[27:59] It's just, it just all feels like just these shots and you're hitting targets and you're

[28:03] hitting like, you know, you're hitting switches.

[28:06] But there's not like a magical toy, like an imposing toy like the black knight.

[28:10] I wish I could just almost like combine the two games to make the ultimate heavy metal

[28:14] stern experience.

[28:15] All right.

[28:16] What else did I think?

[28:17] This game is a visceral atom bomb.

[28:20] Huge sound, huge callouts, huge animations, huge lights going on.

[28:26] But somehow the gameplay just didn't wow me as much as the other stuff happening in the

[28:33] game.

[28:34] I just didn't feel like when I saw the way it shot that any of the shots, that any of

[28:40] the things happening in it, like had the same sort of impact as everything else going

[28:45] on in the game.

[28:46] I mean, everything else was coming at me like a wall of like energy.

[28:50] But then the gameplay, I don't know.

[28:52] I need to flip it to see if that is part of the experience, right?

[28:58] I also came in way feeling like it takes an army to make these games, right?

[29:04] And I was happy that Stern and Humboldt, that all those people sort of walked us through

[29:10] the, you know, the black knight game.

[29:12] And early in the day, I saw the line going at Stern and I have to say this, like it is

[29:16] humbling to see all the people behind these projects.

[29:19] It's really easy for me to grab a mic and just be critical about a company and say this,

[29:25] say that.

[29:26] But there are a lot of people at Stern.

[29:29] It make no mistake that this isn't like some Mickey Mouse operation that's just mailing

[29:34] it in to get these games designed, developed, engineered quality control to make sure it

[29:42] all comes together.

[29:43] The game's already on the line, right?

[29:45] The game is on the line.

[29:46] I'm telling you right now, Willie Wanker is not on the line.

[29:49] I mean, you are going to see black knight this Friday and you're going to be able to go

[29:53] get one real soon, much sooner than you'll be able to get a Willie Wanker.

[29:58] And that's amazing to me.

[30:01] It is amazing to me that the line is moving.

[30:03] You know, solder joints are happening.

[30:06] Scruiser being put in, artwork is being applied to cabinets all while you're seeing it for

[30:12] the first time while.

[30:13] I can't really enunciate it night.

[30:16] Sorry guys, I'm going to get better at this.

[30:17] I need to like, speech therapist.

[30:19] Anyway, so that's amazing.

[30:21] And I'll say this.

[30:22] It's really cool.

[30:23] I do wish Stern would find a better place to show these games and like the kitchen.

[30:27] I mean, really, Stern, you're the biggest pinball company in the world.

[30:31] And the only place you can like showcase your games isn't a freaking kitchen.

[30:36] What's up with that?

[30:37] I know they try to dress it up with the banners in the back, but I think what Stern needs

[30:40] to do.

[30:41] And it's at the point now where it makes total sense.

[30:44] They need to build a showroom.

[30:46] They need to build a showroom in which stuff like this just looks better.

[30:51] I mean, my friends walked into my office and they're like, what are you doing?

[30:53] You're watching like a pinball being streamed in a kitchen somewhere.

[30:56] I'm like, I don't know guys.

[30:58] The biggest pinball company in the world.

[31:00] And we're seeing the game for the first time.

[31:01] It's kind of, it's a little bit embarrassing the backdrop in this game.

[31:04] Sorry, in these streams.

[31:05] I just have to say that.

[31:06] All right, what else do I want to say here?

[31:08] All right.

[31:09] I felt bad for the people playing the game in the stream.

[31:14] And here's why I felt bad for them because they had to play the game silently.

[31:19] Did you, did you, did you hear what was happening?

[31:21] Because they were streaming the audio directly over the stream on Twitch,

[31:27] they could not hear the game in the room.

[31:31] And you heard that a couple of times.

[31:33] Steve Richie even mentioned that.

[31:34] Like it's just not the same.

[31:36] Like I shoot better when the music's going and I totally agree.

[31:38] So I feel like that led to them maybe not playing as well.

[31:44] And also maybe not having the same level of energy and excitement.

[31:48] Like in the room.

[31:50] Because they were not hearing the game the way they should be hearing the game.

[31:55] And we got to hear it better over the internet.

[31:57] So I maybe they could figure out a way to make it so everybody can hear the way the game should be heard.

[32:03] All right.

[32:03] What else do I want to say here?

[32:05] Stern does new stuff, right?

[32:08] Stern does different stuff with this game.

[32:11] But I just can't look at the game and really see where a huge risk was taken.

[32:16] Okay.

[32:17] You know, I always want magic under the glass.

[32:20] And for the silver ball to do something interesting or interact with mex in a truly unique way.

[32:26] And I have to say like I just don't really see that happening here in the black night.

[32:32] You know, it's this is Stern's formula.

[32:35] The formula works.

[32:37] They have the sales numbers to prove it.

[32:40] But when I watch the game play and you know me, I ask very simple questions.

[32:45] You know, am I going to see something that just makes me go wow.

[32:49] Like wow.

[32:51] And I just didn't feel that way looking at any of the stuff happening in the game.

[32:58] And I, you know, for most of Steve Rich's games, you're not going to normally see like the

[33:02] mechanism that has the wow factor in it.

[33:06] But even like the hyper loop in Star Wars had much more of a like really, really, really

[33:10] cool to see that happen in the game.

[33:13] Game of Thrones didn't really have like the wow factor.

[33:16] That was more of a flow game.

[33:19] Star Trek didn't really have like the wow.

[33:21] But again, he makes his games not so much about that, but more about the shots and the geometry

[33:29] and the flow.

[33:30] I mean, it's the king of flow, right?

[33:32] We all know that.

[33:33] You know, I love the Magna say it.

[33:35] That's really cool.

[33:36] That's a carry over from older black night games.

[33:38] But that's it.

[33:39] I didn't feel like there was like this huge risk that was taken.

[33:43] And knowing that this is more of an original IP like this, this is not as expensive to make

[33:48] as a Star Wars or a Guardians of the Galaxy, you know, they didn't have to license this

[33:53] for a lot of money.

[33:55] I think I was expecting maybe just a little bit more of that wow factor in the game.

[34:01] What else did I write down?

[34:02] I know it's here.

[34:03] So I know this is sacrilege to say in the black night world.

[34:09] And I actually preferred the pro over the Ellie, okay?

[34:13] The Ellie just seemed to put the ball into the upper playfield so much more.

[34:19] And mainly because that's like the easiest shot in the game.

[34:22] It's the ramp to the left of the black night, like where the flail is, that just keeps

[34:28] kicking you up into the upper playfield.

[34:30] And then you've got this flipper and you're trying to either lock the ball or like loop

[34:34] it around.

[34:35] It really not a lot in that upper playfield or like a lot going on up there and yet the

[34:40] balls up there a lot.

[34:43] And I don't know.

[34:44] There's just something about that to me that just felt like it removed a lot more of

[34:50] the attention away from the night himself.

[34:53] And it just didn't feel like it added a ton.

[34:56] I know it adds.

[34:57] It adds the, you know, the additional three ball, multi ball lock that's up there.

[35:01] And that was really cool.

[35:02] Tim showed us how you could get both multi balls going at the same time.

[35:05] For six ball, multi ball.

[35:07] But I don't know.

[35:08] It's like upper playfields to me are like dicey things.

[35:11] They can often slow down the speed of a game.

[35:15] They can take away the flow like the upper playfield in game of thrones is a great example.

[35:20] But in black night, it's interesting because black night and in upper playfield, it's like

[35:26] they have to be together.

[35:28] I saw so many people complaining about the pro doesn't have the upper playfield and how

[35:32] can you make a black night game without an upper playfield?

[35:35] But man, I walked away from seeing both of them being like, I actually think the pro

[35:40] is the way to go.

[35:41] Don't crucify me black night fans.

[35:43] All right.

[35:44] What else?

[35:45] All right.

[35:46] So when I heard Tim sexton on Nate chivers' show and he talked about the story of the

[35:51] black night, how you are on a mission to sort of defeat the black night, right?

[35:56] To scale the mountain, to defeat the skeleton army, to sack the castle and battle him,

[36:02] to the death.

[36:03] And you want to power up your sort of rage.

[36:05] Like I get it.

[36:06] Like I'm all in.

[36:07] I love stories like that.

[36:08] When I was watching the stream, I just didn't, I don't know.

[36:13] And maybe this is just me and I'm just always confused by this with pinball.

[36:16] But I just never really get a sense of like the story coming to life when you turn the

[36:23] game on.

[36:24] And by that I mean is you're on the machine for the first time.

[36:28] Someone walks up to it.

[36:29] How are they supposed to know what to do?

[36:31] Like it doesn't really introduce you into the story or the narrative in a simple and

[36:38] easy to get when.

[36:39] And here's remember video games, remember the way like every video game story like this

[36:43] would have started.

[36:45] It would have started with like the princess getting captured by the black night and throwing

[36:50] her up in the top of this castle.

[36:52] And he's like, I dare you to follow me and win back.

[36:57] You know, you're made and again, right?

[36:59] In today's world, I guess that's like sexist now to even have that as like a storyline.

[37:03] But there used to be like something simple like that that just set the stage for why any

[37:08] of this is about to happen.

[37:10] And I'm not sure like this, I didn't get that sense watching the stream like where there's

[37:15] even like an ability to just tell the narrative and get you into the game.

[37:19] It's just immediately like, you know, heavy metal guitar like you just, I don't know.

[37:26] Am I being like unfair when I say that I think that's the challenge and it's also the

[37:32] challenge with an original IP like this.

[37:35] We're not everybody knows the story.

[37:37] See, it's different when it's Star Wars or Willy Wonka or Gardens of the Galaxy.

[37:42] I already know the narrative.

[37:44] So it might be a little bit easier to jump right in because I already have like a context

[37:49] for what I'm about to do.

[37:51] So I did notice that again, maybe I'm just nitpicking here.

[37:54] All right, I give Stern credit for breaking the mold here.

[37:59] Okay, they don't do this.

[38:01] They don't make original games.

[38:03] This is a huge gamble for them.

[38:05] And I think Black Knight fans should feel really lucky that Stern did this for you because

[38:10] I think it is a gift for all of you.

[38:13] I don't know how well though.

[38:15] This will do up against titles that have millions of fans and powerful nostalgia at play.

[38:22] Right.

[38:23] I played Willy Wonka.

[38:24] It definitely gave me goosebumps.

[38:25] It reminded me of so much of what I loved about the movie.

[38:29] I'm not sure game like Black Knight could give me goosebumps.

[38:33] Now I did here on the stream like people were writing like it gave them chills and this

[38:37] and that.

[38:38] And I'm wondering like, did it give those people chills because of like it reminded them

[38:44] of the Black Knight that they love like the previous games.

[38:47] And if so, like I definitely understand why it would do that.

[38:51] We didn't even talk about the retro mode in the game which is super cool where the game

[38:55] goes back and sounds like the old game and has the old sort of score display and the old

[39:00] music.

[39:01] Awesome.

[39:02] Awesome.

[39:03] But again, like you're really only going to be like, oh my god, that's awesome if you

[39:06] know those old games.

[39:09] And that see, you see what I'm saying?

[39:10] Like there's no nostalgic power for people who have no context for what that even is.

[39:14] They wouldn't even know what's happening right there.

[39:17] So this game again continues to feel like a gift for all of you who love the Black Knight

[39:22] franchise.

[39:23] Okay.

[39:24] Now look, I buy on theme.

[39:28] That is the most important thing to me.

[39:29] I don't have many room for many pins.

[39:32] The pins that make it into my home are all because their themes I absolutely love.

[39:37] And so, you know, the question becomes, will Stern's gamble pay off on this game?

[39:43] Will enough non-Black Knight fans find enough here to see, yes, I'm going to go in on this

[39:48] one.

[39:49] I'll take one.

[39:50] The climate is really tough right now.

[39:53] On Friday, you're going to know like really what's coming out from each manufacturer and

[40:01] they're all putting their best games forward right now.

[40:04] And it's going to be really, really interesting to see where this all nets out.

[40:08] I don't want to compare both games right now until we see them side by side.

[40:13] Some people were hitting me up like, this is good as Willy Wonka.

[40:16] What do you think?

[40:17] I don't want to do that.

[40:19] I'm not going to call a victor because I think that's stupid.

[40:22] I don't think it works like that.

[40:24] These two games are not playing a basketball game against each other.

[40:28] There's no victor here.

[40:31] These are two radically different games.

[40:33] And I think you're going to see that when you see both games on Friday.

[40:37] And I don't want to put too much in your head.

[40:38] I've already put more than enough probably around my enthusiasm for Willy Wonka in your

[40:44] head.

[40:45] But I want you to look at both these games.

[40:46] And I think you're going to see they're totally different approaches.

[40:50] One is a heavy metal concert.

[40:52] And one is a trip to Disneyland.

[40:54] And you're just going to have to figure which ones for you.

[40:56] They both shoot great.

[40:58] They both sound great.

[40:59] They both have great light shows.

[41:02] But you know, it's going to be the one that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand

[41:05] up.

[41:06] But probably get your money.

[41:09] And so like, let's see what happens, right?

[41:11] It's an amazing week to be a pinball fan.

[41:15] And we haven't seen something like this happen in a really long time.

[41:18] And so, you know, that's how I want to leave it for all you out there.

[41:22] I think this game is 100% designed to be a gift to fans of Steve Richie and to fans

[41:31] of the Black Knight.

[41:32] I don't think it will sell as well as other licensed, stern games.

[41:37] I am a little curious as to why they brought it out so close to the monsters.

[41:43] But that is the case.

[41:44] Stern doesn't do anything by mistake.

[41:46] They're clearly was a strategy behind it all.

[41:49] To me, the big question is going to be coming out of MGC.

[41:54] And we're going to talk a lot about this.

[41:57] Two games will be revealed.

[41:58] But really only one of them will be making its way into customer homes immediately.

[42:05] And the ball will be in the court of Jersey Jack and the team over there to get their

[42:10] line ready.

[42:12] Their line needs to look like the line that I saw when I saw the Stern video today.

[42:17] Right?

[42:18] There weren't people.

[42:19] Those those pirates, when I went over to Jersey Jack, there was pirates of the Caribbean

[42:22] on the line, the big line, the main line.

[42:24] Guess what it wasn't doing?

[42:25] It wasn't moving.

[42:26] They were waiting for parts.

[42:28] They can't turn into that.

[42:31] There is just going to be too much demand for Willy Wonka for people to wait months and

[42:36] months and months to get them.

[42:38] I mean, I'm in on a CE.

[42:39] You know that.

[42:40] And I'm trying to think in my head, well, when might I get it?

[42:43] I mean, I'm excited now to get it, right?

[42:45] I'm excited now to play it.

[42:47] Do I want to wait to August to September to October?

[42:52] I don't know.

[42:53] You know, I don't know.

[42:55] But if you order a Stern pro or a Stern LE, you know, you're going to get it in like

[42:59] a couple months and there that you have to take your hat off to that efficiency.

[43:05] Okay?

[43:06] The battleground is set.

[43:08] A black knight in one corner, a dandy dude in a purple tuxedo top cap in a walking

[43:14] stick in another black knight versus Willy Wonka.

[43:17] There is going to be a competitive spirit here.

[43:19] The two DNAs of these two great companies are going to show us, you know, their best

[43:24] two date.

[43:26] And maybe you might argue there.

[43:27] I don't know.

[43:28] I always think like every game.

[43:29] You know, this Steve Richie is like, this is the one he always wanted to make.

[43:32] He's the, if you think Steve Richie is Stern's best designer and he's the king and you think

[43:35] Pat Lawler is a god in the pinball world.

[43:39] It's, they are the two, you know, icons of the industry from yesterday's that are making

[43:44] games these days.

[43:45] And it's hard to avoid the showdown that's about to happen in Milwaukee.

[43:50] Enjoy it.

[43:51] Let me tell you guys what's coming up on the show.

[43:54] I believe I will be talking to Josh Kugler from American pinball.

[43:58] I'm really excited to get Josh on the show.

[44:00] I also interviewed Jack and Joe Newhart when I was at Jersey Jack pinball.

[44:05] Now that interview is embargoed until Friday.

[44:09] After the reveal, I will put that interview up and I think you'll really, really enjoy

[44:14] Canadian talking to Jack and to Joe about Willy Wonka.

[44:19] So look forward to that.

[44:20] You're also going to get blitzed this Friday and this weekend by all the other pinball

[44:26] media that Jack brought in to see Willy Wonka for the first time.

[44:30] And I think it was a really great move.

[44:32] And here is the thing.

[44:33] There's no conspiracy.

[44:34] There's no this.

[44:35] There's no that.

[44:36] It was really smart of Jack to invite the pinball media that actually matter.

[44:42] It is so stupid to reveal the game for the first time on IGN.

[44:47] Nobody on IGN cares at all about new pinball machines.

[44:53] You know who cares?

[44:54] All the 3000 people that were watching Jack Danger tonight.

[44:58] He has more power in showing people and influencing people than IGN.

[45:04] And you can even go to bigger outlets.

[45:06] Even if this pinball machine was revealed on, even if it was like USA Today or even if

[45:10] it was on like wired or pop side, it doesn't matter.

[45:15] The focus, the primary buyer of these machines are all of the people.

[45:22] You know, they listen to all of the people that Jack brought in to see Willy Wonka.

[45:27] And I think I think Stern should take a lesson from that because I think the kinds of stories

[45:32] you're going to see come out of that that go up on Friday are just going to be much better

[45:37] than the IGN story and much better than always doing the same strategy every single time.

[45:45] And I'm happy they did it.

[45:46] And I was humbled to be invited there.

[45:50] And I am not a show for any company.

[45:52] I'm just enthusiastic about a game.

[45:54] I do this podcast to land on pinball magic.

[45:57] And I think we have a lot of pinball options coming out.

[46:00] And it's up to you to say, well, what's magical to you?

[46:03] I told you what's magical to me.

[46:05] But you know, everybody's got to make up their own opinions in this hobby, right?

[46:09] Everyone have a great night.

[46:10] We'll talk to you soon.

[46:11] We've done a team for maybe the day.

[46:16] I ain't got time for the game because I need you.

[46:21] Yeah, yeah, well, I need you.

[46:25] I need you.

[46:28] I need you.

[46:32] Congratulations.
