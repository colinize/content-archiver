[00:00] What do you think we're gonna go away forever?

[00:13] We were just gonna let the correspondence over at the Pimbal Network have their own show?

[00:18] My God, the inmates are running the asylum in the Pimbal Podcasting world.

[00:23] I know there's no news out there.

[00:25] They know there's no news out there.

[00:27] All the other shows were always bank and uncannaded to give them their topics, but we went away

[00:31] for a few weeks.

[00:32] Now, we're not back for good.

[00:34] But you know what, we're gonna do a little special edition of Canadian Pimbal Podcast

[00:38] out there just to remind all of you why we're the number one Pimbal Podcast out in the world.

[00:44] You know, maybe my hopes were too high.

[00:53] Maybe I just have lofty expectations that the Pimbal content creators could create content

[00:59] that would be entertaining and exciting, even if new games weren't shipping.

[01:04] But you know what, it can't happen.

[01:05] They just can't do it.

[01:06] They can't do it.

[01:07] You can have five people on one show at one time.

[01:10] It doesn't equal one Canadian.

[01:11] So here's what we're gonna do.

[01:13] We're gonna prove to everybody out there that even when there's no Pimbal News, you can

[01:17] make Pimbal Entertainment exciting.

[01:20] And what we're gonna do on this special edition of Canadian Pimbal Podcast is I'm here to

[01:24] prove to you that even when there's no Pimbal News, that Canadian's fake Pimbal News is actually

[01:31] more interesting than the real Pimbal News that is out there.

[01:34] That is right.

[01:35] I am going to do something I've never done before.

[01:38] I'm going to admit at the beginning of the show that the news you're about to hear today

[01:44] is fake.

[01:45] Think of it as satire as imaginary headlines in the Pimbal World that if they were true

[01:52] would give you a good chuckle.

[01:54] Now, what you're gonna love is that a lot of these are sort of based upon stuff that

[01:58] is actually happening in the Pimbal World.

[02:00] Now, before we do, Canada's fake news segment, which I think you're gonna love a few things,

[02:05] a few things.

[02:06] We will cover off on some of the news stuff that's happened in the Pimbal World.

[02:09] It's not a lot.

[02:10] Definitely not a lot.

[02:11] What's the first thing?

[02:12] Chicago Gaming Company.

[02:13] The Royal editions of Medieval Madness have made it out into the world and I'm seeing

[02:18] people unbox them.

[02:19] So that's cool.

[02:20] I don't know about you, but I don't know.

[02:22] There's something about this game was shown to us in October of 2019 and by the time

[02:27] this game has finally made it out, it just doesn't really excite me as much as it did

[02:33] way back then.

[02:34] I'm sort of happy I gave up my spot on it for a Rick and Morty.

[02:39] Now, speaking of Rick and Morty, where is my game number 50 still waiting on it?

[02:44] Now I just saw yesterday that Wisconsin has thrown out like the Supreme Court or whatever

[02:49] their court is.

[02:50] They ruled it unconstitutional to have people not go back to work.

[02:56] So Spooky Pimbal can technically reopen its doors as of I think today.

[03:02] But here's the thing people are forgetting about.

[03:04] It's not just Wisconsin that has a law around staying at home and not going into work.

[03:10] It's other states in which Spooky Pimbal relies on parts, mainly Illinois and mainly the city

[03:16] of Chicago.

[03:17] So I don't think that this means that the assembly line will be moving tomorrow.

[03:22] I don't think this means the supply chain for Spooky Pimbal will be turned back on immediately.

[03:29] Okay.

[03:30] So people need to relax a little bit.

[03:33] There's a lot going on in the world and you don't want to rush back to business unless

[03:37] you're sure that the people you're working with can be safe.

[03:41] And I think we all agree on that.

[03:43] Now speaking about getting back to work, Stern Pimbal, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[03:49] So there's some speculation that Stern Pimbal is actually secretly building these games

[03:55] and we're going to see them at the end of the month.

[03:57] And I don't really feel like that is going to happen.

[04:01] I don't think Stern Pimbal would break the law to get this game on the line.

[04:07] I think they're doing the right thing.

[04:09] I do think that there might have been some Ninja Turtle pros that could have been built

[04:14] before they shut down the factory.

[04:16] We know one of them.

[04:18] We know one of them is inside Dwight Sullivan's house because he's doing the code.

[04:22] And everyone, everyone did have a collective moment of sighing and shrugging their shoulders.

[04:29] That Dwight Sullivan is going to be the coder on this game.

[04:34] And Dwight, I think I speak for the whole community when I want to tell you this.

[04:38] Now first and foremost, if you have kids listening to this episode of Canada's Pimbal

[04:42] podcast, now is the time to turn off the podcast.

[04:46] There will be some swearing on this show starting now and going into some of my fake news segments.

[04:52] Okay.

[04:53] So you've been warned your children's ears can be preserved.

[04:56] Your innocence can remain intact.

[04:59] So Dwight, I think I speak for the whole community when I say Ninja Turtles is in your hands.

[05:05] Please don't fuck it up.

[05:07] Please don't fuck it up.

[05:08] Okay.

[05:09] Don't fuck it up.

[05:10] Now speaking of like Canada's news segments, before I go to my fake news, I actually want

[05:14] to air for you a chat between Gary Stern and Dwight Sullivan.

[05:20] As Dwight was talking to Gary about why he should be the coder on Ninja Turtles, you

[05:25] know, Gary's very bullish.

[05:27] And when he talks to people like Dwight, I mean, he's a little arrogant, but I overheard

[05:31] Gary Stern and Dwight Sullivan having a conversation.

[05:35] Now, I just want to play that conversation for you right now, ladies and gentlemen, Gary

[05:39] Stern talking to Dwight Sullivan.

[05:42] But I'd like to speak to the guy who put this together.

[05:44] Mr. Sullivan, is he speaking English?

[05:46] Hey, how you doing?

[05:47] I'm, what, thank you.

[05:48] I'm really glad to be here.

[05:49] Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you're here.

[05:51] Good morning.

[05:52] Maybe you could tell me what you think is going on here.

[05:55] And please, speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever.

[06:01] It wasn't brains that got me here.

[06:03] I can show you that.

[06:04] So a lot of people give me credit where I don't, where I believe I don't deserve.

[06:08] A lot of people come up and tell me that, wow, you know, you worked on Lord of the Rings

[06:12] or you worked on, you know, Simpson's pinball party.

[06:16] And those were my favorite games and thanks.

[06:17] Thanks for doing such a great job.

[06:19] And I'm like, well, you're welcome.

[06:21] But you know, those weren't my games.

[06:22] I had, you know, like everything you think is fun about those games was probably attributed

[06:26] to Keith Johnson.

[06:27] Let me tell you something, Mr. Sullivan.

[06:31] Do you care to know why I'm in this chair with you all?

[06:36] I mean, why I earn the big bucks.

[06:38] That's a good question.

[06:40] I know nothing about what jobs and careers are.

[06:42] I have no plan.

[06:43] I'm here for one reason and one reason alone.

[06:47] I'm here to guess what the music might do a week, a month, a year from now.

[06:54] What have I told you since the first day you stepped into my office?

[06:58] There's a billion people that make pinball that make, you know, those three games.

[07:02] There are three ways to make a living in this business.

[07:05] Be first, be smarter or cheat.

[07:09] No, they'd come all right.

[07:10] And Mr. Sullivan, what does your model say that that means for us here?

[07:15] And I thought the multipliers were good and I put lots of effort into lots of different

[07:19] ways where you can build up your multipliers.

[07:20] You had shot multipliers and you had playful multipliers and they multiplied against each

[07:23] other.

[07:24] What you're telling me is that the music is about to stop and we're going to be left

[07:31] holding the biggest bag of odorous excrement ever assembled in the history of capitalism.

[07:40] Where Star Wars gets complicated is when somebody that knows the rules tries to explain

[07:44] it to somebody who doesn't.

[07:46] When you're explaining Star Wars to somebody, it gets complicated fast, you know, working

[07:51] with Dwight as nuts.

[07:52] Oh, so funny.

[07:56] Nobody wants Dwight to fuck up Ninja Turtles.

[07:59] So we're going to see what he does with the game.

[08:01] Now he's had a lot of time to make that game shine with this pause and this delay in

[08:05] manufacturing.

[08:06] So the pressure is on Dwight.

[08:08] Don't fuck it up.

[08:10] Now speaking of pressure.

[08:12] Now we broke the news and this was legitimate news when Jersey Jack Pimball was moving to

[08:17] Chicago.

[08:18] Now, you know, I heard from people who worked in the Jersey Jack Jersey factory that said

[08:23] the first time they heard about the move was on Canadian Pimball podcast.

[08:28] That is 100% the truth.

[08:30] This is not part of the fake news yet.

[08:33] Now, but what is interesting is that when we've been talking about Pat Lawler laying

[08:38] down the law, we were we were hitting on a nerve.

[08:41] Now I was able to go over to Chicago during this pandemic and actually listen in on Pat

[08:49] Lawler talking to the employees of Jersey Jack Pimball Chicago.

[08:54] And I'm here to tell you he's got a very aggressive approach to motivate these people in Chicago.

[09:00] I'm not sure it's going to work, but I think it lives up to the sort of strident way he

[09:06] likes to address people to get great products out the door.

[09:09] Just listen to Pat Lawler addressing the Chicago employees at J.J.P.

[09:14] Oh, you motherfuckers.

[09:16] Okay.

[09:17] All right.

[09:18] I'm putting cases on all you bitches.

[09:22] Huh?

[09:23] You think you can do this shit?

[09:26] You think you can do this to me?

[09:29] You motherfuckers will be playing basketball in Pelican Bay when I get finished with you.

[09:35] 23 hour lockdown.

[09:38] I'm the man up in this piece.

[09:41] You'll never see the light.

[09:42] You don't fuck you think you fucking wits.

[09:44] I run shit here.

[09:46] You just live here.

[09:48] Yeah, that's why you better walk away.

[09:51] Go on walk away because I'm a burn this motherfucker now.

[09:54] King Kong ain't got shit on me.

[09:57] Well, sounds like it's going to be a fun place to work at Jersey Jack in Chicago.

[10:09] Can't wait to they start things up there.

[10:12] So speaking of a not so fun place to work in Chicago in the Pimball world, American

[10:18] Pimball has been a place of promise of optimism and of sales flops.

[10:25] And there's no way to spin it.

[10:27] And unfortunately when I went over to American Pimball recently after they revealed hot wheels

[10:32] and the sales numbers aren't where they thought they would be, I overheard Dovel talking

[10:38] to Joe Balser.

[10:40] And these are two men who have gone in this together.

[10:44] Dovel put his company's fortune in Joe Balser's hands.

[10:49] And I think he's upset.

[10:51] I think he was upset with Joe Balser and I want you to listen to Dovel talking to Joe

[10:56] Balser when they realize that they might have a third sales flop on their hands.

[11:01] I give you facts.

[11:02] I don't give a fuck.

[11:03] What the fuck?

[11:04] They are fucking a dick.

[11:05] What the fuck you?

[11:06] Fuck you.

[11:07] Fuck you.

[11:08] Fuck you.

[11:09] Fuck you.

[11:10] Fuck you.

[11:11] Fuck you.

[11:12] Fuck you.

[11:13] Fuck you.

[11:14] Fuck you.

[11:15] Fuck you.

[11:16] Fuck you.

[11:17] Fuck you.

[11:18] Fuck you.

[11:19] Fuck you.

[11:20] I'm a gentleman.

[11:21] Hey Joe.

[11:22] You're saying all they do is I like you except for me.

[11:27] Who's I like?

[11:28] Except for me.

[11:29] Oh, you fuck you.

[11:30] Who likes you except for me?

[11:32] Except for me.

[11:33] You shut up.

[11:34] I'm the only one who likes you.

[11:36] Fuck you.

[11:37] Fuck you.

[11:38] Fuck you.

[11:39] Man, I hope that Joe and Dovel can work out their differences because they sound like

[11:44] they're about to go fist to cuffs.

[11:46] Alright, so here's what we're going to do now.

[11:48] The world said there's no pinball news.

[11:50] Canada said they're wrong.

[11:52] We are going to give you the world exclusive premiere of Canada's pinball podcast, Fake

[11:57] News.

[11:58] Now what's going to be fun about this segment is that one of the things that I say in

[12:02] this fake news segment is actually real.

[12:05] And I wonder if you can guess which one of these news segments actually happened, okay?

[12:10] Now let's kick it off.

[12:12] Let's do what other shows do.

[12:13] Let's make it a little bit of a segment with some music and an introduction.

[12:16] So here we go with Canada's Fake News segment.

[12:25] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Canada's pinball podcast breaking news in the world of

[12:29] pinball.

[12:30] Let's get started right now.

[12:32] Our first news story comes to us from American pinball.

[12:36] American pinball to rerun Jersey Jack pinball's hit title, The Wizard of Oz, without Jersey

[12:42] Jack's permission.

[12:45] After three sales flops in a row, American pinball founder, Dobble Vassini has this to say

[12:50] about the move.

[12:52] As you know, we haven't sold many games and since we invested everything in Joe Balser,

[12:57] it's only fair we get access to every game he's designed said Vassini.

[13:02] With so many versions of Waz out there, we're hopeful nobody will even notice this move.

[13:10] Deeproot pinball announced today that games 6, 7 and 8 are delayed due to COVID-19, but

[13:17] games 9, 10 and 11 are right on schedule.

[13:22] Company sets February 30 as release date for all titles moving forward.

[13:27] Robert Mueller had this to say about the announcement.

[13:31] Nobody has ever shipped games 9, 10 and 11 as their first three titles said Mueller.

[13:37] Starting at game number 1 is so easy and expected and this bold move to jump right to games

[13:43] 9, 10 and 11 will put us in a position to disrupt the market.

[13:48] When asked if games 9, 10 and 11 would be licensed themes, Mueller had this to say.

[13:54] We don't know yet, we won't start working on games 9, 10 and 11 until we finish games

[13:59] 18, 19 and 20.

[14:02] Those three were truly excited about and can't wait to show everyone.

[14:07] Steve Bowden was asked if Raza Code was complete to which he responded, what's Raza?

[14:13] Where am I and what have I done?

[14:18] Jersey Jack pinball to make the Matrix pinball with zero assets from the Matrix and no

[14:24] rights to actually say the Matrix.

[14:27] The game will feature nothing from the film but promises to be Jersey Jack's deepest and

[14:33] most confusing game today.

[14:36] When asked a comment on this, Jack said, whenever we start a new game, we ask ourselves one simple

[14:42] question, how much of what people love about this theme can we leave out.

[14:48] I was so impressed when we made Willy Wonka, it's challenging to make a musical pin and

[14:54] find a way to leave the songs out but we did it said Jack.

[14:58] With the Matrix I pushed this team to the limit and they came back with a game that doesn't

[15:03] resemble the Matrix at all and I'm sure the fans are going to love it.

[15:08] Stern Pinball announces flipper bats on all games will cost extra and ship two months after

[15:15] the game ships.

[15:16] For years we've been testing to see how little we could give customers for the money said

[15:20] Gary Stern.

[15:22] After Elvira Couch, this move seemed natural and we are confident our customers will appreciate

[15:28] the extra time we are giving the clear coats to cure as they wait for their flipper bats

[15:33] to arrive.

[15:35] Stern Pinball admitted as no idea what a lifestyle brand is.

[15:40] Just sounded cool, said Zack Sharp.

[15:42] Black Knight Topper makes history as first topper to sell more units than the game itself.

[15:49] Stern announced today that 473 black knight toppers have been sold to sit on top of the

[15:56] 329 black knight games that have been purchased by customers.

[16:02] When asked a comment on the news, the game's designer Steve Richie had this to say.

[16:07] At least Dwight Sullivan wasn't on the code.

[16:12] A smaller local news item just in distributors act many misunderstand the terms sell out, thinks

[16:18] it means a good business day.

[16:26] Joe Balser announces November fest pinball.

[16:29] Some will go on sale every month of the year, except November.

[16:33] When asked what November fest was about, Balser had this to say about the theme and design

[16:38] direction of the game.

[16:40] In November fest you play as a pinball designer that just designed October fest.

[16:45] The goal of the game is to sell as many October fest as possible.

[16:49] Your score equals games sold, said Balser.

[16:52] It's a challenging game as every switch in the game multiplies your score by zero.

[16:57] So the goal is to not hit anything.

[17:00] As far as design goes, it looks a lot like Houdini.

[17:03] In fact it is Houdini.

[17:05] We had a lot left over in the warehouse.

[17:07] Kugler and I messed around with the code.

[17:09] I brought in Doble, made him close his eyes, then look, voila!

[17:13] November fest was born.

[17:15] You can buy it any month except November exclusively at pinball star.

[17:22] When his nordman announces he's quitting stern pinball, even though he doesn't work there.

[17:27] It was time, said Norman.

[17:29] He doesn't even work here, said George Gomez.

[17:34] At Lawler comes clean and admits he watched Free Willy instead of Willy Wonka when designing

[17:39] last game.

[17:41] Reports indicate that legendary Lawler was confused when Joe Katz's code wasn't about

[17:45] a killer whale trying to escape, but instead a charismatic chocolateeer searching for a

[17:51] child to inherit a magical candy land.

[17:54] I spent months studying the underwood or movements of the Orca, said Lawler.

[18:05] Jerry Stelemberg confirms that none of P3's P's stands for profit.

[18:10] Reveals to the world they stand for platform, ponder, and platypus.

[18:19] Finally some late minute breaking news as a testament to its superior quality, Stern

[18:24] Pimball announced today it will refund buyers $1,000 for every playfield dimple.

[18:30] The fine print reads, the offer is valid as long as no games are played.

[18:41] Jeff from this week in Pimball mistakenly mails Christopher Franchise Twippy award for

[18:46] best Pimball artist to Stern Pimball.

[18:50] Gary Stern replies, we will use it as a door stopper.

[18:54] So which one was it?

[18:56] Which one was the real news story that was in fake?

[18:59] It actually was the last news story on the list.

[19:02] Jeff Patterson over at this week in Pimball mailed Christopher Franchise Twippy award for

[19:07] best Pimball artist to Stern Pimball and we know those two entities don't get along.

[19:13] So I really hope Stern Pimball gets Franchise his award back in one piece.

[19:18] I can't believe Jeff did that.

[19:19] Jeff how could you mail Franchise award to Stern Pimball?

[19:23] That would be like you mailing Canadian podcast Twippy award to American Pimball headquarters.

[19:29] That's how much they love Franchise over at Stern.

[19:32] That's how much American Pimball loves Canada.

[19:35] So I hope you enjoyed this snackable version of Canadian Pimball podcast and I just want

[19:40] to say of course I was joking when I was making fun of all the other Pimball podcasters

[19:45] out there.

[19:46] These guys are doing a great job giving you entertaining Pimball content for free during

[19:52] a moment in time in which there is no Pimball news.

[19:55] So you know who they are.

[19:57] The super duper awesome Pimball podcast, the slam tilt show, these poor man's Pimball

[20:03] podcast, the loser kid Pimball podcast, the Pimball network with the Pimball show and

[20:08] all the other shows on the Pimball network.

[20:10] It's a period of time in which there's not much to talk about.

[20:13] So I give these gentlemen credit for actually still doing their shows during this pandemic.

[20:19] The reason I took a break is it's just not a lot going on and I can't read Pinside and

[20:24] here you fools debate about whether or not they're going to make pie or to the Caribbean

[20:28] again.

[20:29] It's just over and over and over again and it just goes to show when there's no new

[20:32] inbox games.

[20:34] How stale, how stale the conversation becomes in Pimball.

[20:39] It's unbelievable.

[20:40] We need new games.

[20:42] This this community on Pinside and a lot of you collectors without new games, it's like

[20:48] you're going through withdrawal.

[20:50] It's I always said it.

[20:51] It's an addiction and new inbox games are the drug you need to stay happy.

[20:57] We don't want to just be done with new inbox and only be able to look at the games from

[21:02] the past because then we have to look at parts of the Caribbean and are they going to

[21:06] remake it?

[21:07] Who cares when you could buy that game?

[21:08] Nobody wanted it.

[21:10] Now that you can't buy it, everybody wants it.

[21:12] What a great marketing strategy, Jersey Jack Pimball.

[21:15] All right, everybody have a good day.

[21:17] Stay safe.

[21:18] This doesn't mean Canadian Pimball podcast is back.

[21:21] I just wanted to give you a little episode to laugh at to make fun of me.

[21:25] It's what everyone loves to do.

[21:27] It's what everybody loves to do.

[21:30] I want to sign off with a little message to my best friend out there in the world.

[21:35] He's the most supportive guy to Canadian Pimball podcast, Hilton.

[21:39] This is my message to you.

[21:41] On your slack, don't take it like it.

[21:43] What?
