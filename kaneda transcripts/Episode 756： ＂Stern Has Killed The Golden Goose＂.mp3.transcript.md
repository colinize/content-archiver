[00:00] Oh, everybody, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:24] Now this podcast is going to be one of the most important podcasts I ever do.

[00:28] Because I want to say something that just needs to be said.

[00:31] And I'm going to say it to everybody.

[00:33] And in a world that has become increasingly greedy, I'm going to make this show free

[00:38] for everybody.

[00:39] Now, if you don't know who I am, my name's Canadian.

[00:41] I do a little pinball podcast.

[00:42] I'm always on the side of the consumer, keeping these companies accountable.

[00:46] And if you want to listen to Canadian Spinball Podcast, you have to sign up on Patreon.

[00:50] Because I gave shows for free for five years.

[00:53] And then the trollers tried to dox me.

[00:55] Now it's all of us, Canadian fans just having a good time.

[00:58] And this shows not free because I want your Twippy vote, even though I have your Twippy

[01:02] vote.

[01:03] The reason why I want to make this show free is what I'm going to say on this episode

[01:07] of Canadian Spinball Podcast means a lot to me.

[01:11] Because Stern Pinball means a lot to me.

[01:14] Because Pinball means a lot to me.

[01:17] Because Stern Pinball is the leader in the pinball hobby.

[01:21] They are the leader in the pinball industry.

[01:24] And I don't want to see what we love about Pinball be destroyed by the greediness of a few

[01:30] executives over at Stern Pinball by a few executives or marketing decision makers over

[01:37] at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:39] This hobby has been so much fun over the last ten years.

[01:43] If you look at the games that have come out over the last ten years, they dominate the

[01:48] top 20 games of all time by Pinball fan rankings.

[01:53] Even Pinball alone has eleven out of the top 20 pinball machines of all time.

[02:01] And if you look at the games on that list, they are all phenomenal pinball machines.

[02:06] Anyone who owns any of those games has one of the greatest pinball machines ever that

[02:12] they will enjoy for many, many years to come.

[02:15] Keith L. Win himself has four out of those eleven games.

[02:20] Keith L. Win himself has the number one pinball machine of all time in Godzilla.

[02:28] That is why it pains me to see what has happened this week.

[02:32] Stern Pinball using Keith L. Win to make a move, to release a game that is the biggest

[02:39] FU to pinball collectors in the history of pinball releases.

[02:47] And we have been through a lot over the last couple of years.

[02:50] All of us have been through a lot personally.

[02:52] We have been through a lot with COVID, with our jobs.

[02:55] We have friends and family who might have had health issues, who have had job losses.

[03:00] And I feel for everybody.

[03:02] I feel for these companies that have had supply chain issues.

[03:05] I really do.

[03:07] But none of that makes up for what has happened in the pinball landscape over the last year.

[03:14] And I mean it when I say it.

[03:16] The other pinball media is so hell bent on celebrating these companies at all costs.

[03:23] At interviewing all of the personalities over at these companies because that's what matters

[03:28] most, right?

[03:29] That's where the ratings are.

[03:30] That's where the celebration in pinball lies, right?

[03:33] You have to interview everybody.

[03:34] But I'm here to tell you right now.

[03:35] I've won the favorite pinball podcast for five years in a row because I don't want to interview

[03:40] the pinball companies because I want to celebrate the best in pinball because I want these

[03:45] companies to give us magical worlds under glass.

[03:47] But I also don't want to just cheerlead these four profit companies at all costs.

[03:54] I would rather be on the side of you, the buyer.

[03:58] And I'm so tired of hearing about, oh, the livelihood of this and the livelihood of that.

[04:02] Guess what?

[04:03] Each and every one of us is sacrificing our livelihoods to buy these pinball machines.

[04:10] And for almost a decade, we had it all really, really good.

[04:14] These companies would make these magical machines.

[04:16] They would price them fairly and they would pass on the value to the customer.

[04:22] And it was a lot of fun.

[04:23] It was a lot of fun buying LEDs at $7,500.

[04:26] There was a lot of fun seeing Wizard of Oz for $6,500.

[04:29] It was a lot of fun when Jersey Jack showed his pirate to the Caribbean and anybody could

[04:34] have walked up and bought one for $12,500, right?

[04:39] It was a lot of fun.

[04:40] And it wasn't like this.

[04:41] I'm going to stab everybody in the back to get a game.

[04:44] It wasn't like these pinball companies were trying to find the price ceiling on every

[04:48] single launch.

[04:49] And now here we are today.

[04:51] They've removed so much magic from these games.

[04:53] Here we are today in a time in which pinball is the most expensive it's ever been in the

[04:58] history of pinball and the games have lessened them now than they ever did like in the last

[05:02] 10 years.

[05:04] And all of a sudden, everybody wants you to just forget what we know and why we love this

[05:08] hobby.

[05:09] I want to talk about this James Bond release and why I think what Stern has done over

[05:14] the last couple of days is one of the sleasiest marketing moves in the history of pinball.

[05:19] And I'm not going to be ranting and raving because I respect Stern pinball.

[05:22] I respect George Gomez.

[05:24] I respect Keith Elwin.

[05:26] I respect the men and women who put those machines together.

[05:29] Remember, there are hundreds of people over at Stern pinball that break their backs every

[05:34] day to put together these complex mechanical devices and my hat goes off to them.

[05:40] And I'm telling you all those hundreds of people, they were let down this week and the

[05:45] reputation of the company they worked for.

[05:48] They were all let down by the marketing decision to price this game.

[05:54] This Baron basically home pin game.

[05:57] This is like a Baron the pin home version of a Stern machine to price one of the most

[06:02] basic Stern machines ever made as the most expensive Stern pinball machine of all time.

[06:09] And not just the most expensive Stern pinball machine, the most expensive MSRP pinball machine

[06:15] in the history of pinball and you look down at this game and that is an utter joke if

[06:21] you look at it through that lens.

[06:23] And I'm not going to tell you all the inside information I have about this game and how

[06:27] maybe Keith Elwin himself isn't really happy about this pricing and he knew this would

[06:31] get raked over the calls but that's a true story.

[06:34] But what is Canadian?

[06:35] He only has the twitbees on the shelf and he doesn't care about interviewing Keith Elwin.

[06:39] He'd rather tell you how Keith Elwin really feels not what he can tell you on a podcast

[06:43] because then he get in trouble with Stern pinball.

[06:46] So here's the thing I want to walk us through the history of this launch and what is happening

[06:49] and why what happened over the last two days is so significant.

[06:52] So in September, Stern denounced there would be this collectible version of James Bond.

[06:57] And guess who broke you that new story?

[06:59] I did.

[07:00] I don't know if you know that it was crazy the game came out.

[07:02] Now we didn't see the game.

[07:03] What did Stern do to the James Bond fan base?

[07:06] Because I do believe that a pinball company has an obligation with every new launch to make

[07:12] sure they respect the fan base of that theme to make sure they price the game accordingly.

[07:18] They put as much as they can, right?

[07:20] They theme integrated to the best of their ability.

[07:23] What did Stern do?

[07:24] They showed you the George Gomez pins.

[07:26] They showed us the most expensive Stern elite to date, $13,000, right?

[07:31] $14,000 grand with tax.

[07:33] And we got to see the George Gomez pin.

[07:35] The pin was incomplete.

[07:36] They marched it out onto the show floor over in England and then they quickly took it off

[07:40] the show floor.

[07:42] And then what did they do people?

[07:43] They didn't show you much of the game.

[07:45] We knew the code was incomplete and then what happened?

[07:49] They made you buy the game before you saw much more of the game.

[07:53] But here's the real thing they did.

[07:55] If you're a James Bond collector and you know because they told you in September there

[07:59] was a Keith L.W. game coming, did they show you the Keith L.W. pin and the George Gomez

[08:05] pin so you could make up your mind as a James Bond collector which machines you wanted

[08:11] to buy?

[08:12] They didn't do that.

[08:13] They purposely held back the Keith L.W. game and we know it was ready to be shown because

[08:18] we saw the leaked image in September.

[08:21] So they purposely held it back to get all of your money, all 1,000 of you to pay up and

[08:27] fall and ship those L.E.s before they showed you the Keith L.W. in machine.

[08:34] So I would argue that that was a little bit of a sleazy marketing move.

[08:38] I understand why they did it but I also think that was a sleazy marketing move.

[08:44] But it is what it is.

[08:45] So now imagine being a James Bond collector and you wake up to January 3rd.

[08:49] You're all excited to see what this exclusive and Stern build it as a highly collectible

[08:54] James Bond 60th anniversary machine.

[08:57] And then what happens?

[08:58] They reveal the game and they sell it directly on Stern's website.

[09:02] Now this is a really important part of this story.

[09:06] Stern Pinball has only once before sold a super expensive super rare game on its website.

[09:14] It was 6 years ago and it was Batman S.L.E. and they sold it for $15,000 and they sold

[09:22] all 80 of them directly to customers.

[09:27] And you had to actually submit a proposal, like a video proposal to Stern for the right

[09:33] to buy one.

[09:35] But every single one of those games was sold directly from Stern to the customer.

[09:40] And for some of you newbies in the hobby right now you weren't around then.

[09:44] But there was an uproar.

[09:45] There was an uproar that the game was that much money.

[09:49] And there was an uproar that Stern made you sort of beg for the right to buy one.

[09:54] Now looking back now, how beautiful, how magical, how majestical, how worth the money now

[10:02] is that Batman 66 S.L.E.

[10:05] I would argue that was the last great attempt by Stern Pinball to go over a machine and make

[10:11] sure every single inch of the machine was covered with beautiful detail and you can see

[10:17] why to this day that is still probably the most beautiful pinball machine Stern has ever

[10:23] put out and might ever put out.

[10:25] I won't even get started on how ugly James Bond is with the lazy drag and drop artwork.

[10:29] I'm not even going to go there.

[10:30] But you know, so that was the only time.

[10:34] So I want to remind people of something because people keep trying to chime in to apologize

[10:38] for this James Bond game saying, well, Stern price beetles at $25,000 and no, they did

[10:44] not.

[10:45] I want to remind people, Stern never put an official price on beetles diamond, right?

[10:52] They release beetles diamond, platinum and gold.

[10:55] What Stern did was they let the distributors set the price of beetles diamond.

[11:01] But I heard behind back channels, they recommended that dealers might be able to get $25,000 for

[11:10] a beetles diamond.

[11:11] And keep in mind, beetles diamond is the same exact game as beetles platinum and beetles

[11:18] gold.

[11:19] And they all look identical.

[11:21] It was only for the armor and the plaque that was different.

[11:25] And some artwork tweaks, but that was it.

[11:27] But Stern never officially said that game was worth $25,000.

[11:32] And then when Elvira House of Horror's 40th anniversary came out, Stern also did not put

[11:38] an official MSRP on the game.

[11:41] They sold that game to distributors for $15,000.

[11:46] And what happened?

[11:47] The distributors got together.

[11:49] There was a little bit of collusion and early on, they colluded and set a $25,000 price

[11:55] tag on Elvira.

[11:57] And think about that for a minute.

[11:59] A distributor was making $10,000 over their cost of the game.

[12:04] I mean, Stern ostensibly turned the distributors and the dealers into scalpers to put more money

[12:10] in their pockets.

[12:12] Okay?

[12:13] So who is Stern looking out for?

[12:14] Are they looking out for the customer?

[12:16] Are they looking out for the thousands and thousands of us that have to go to work each

[12:21] day and work super hard to make this much money to buy these machines?

[12:24] No, they're looking out for their sales force.

[12:26] And they're looking out for themselves.

[12:28] I want to remind people of that because dealers didn't have the sale of Elvira at 25,

[12:33] but many did and many listed it at that.

[12:36] And I'm going to tell you what happened with that story because I have some friends who

[12:39] bought Elvira at 25,000.

[12:42] People who had FOMO, they ran in and they bought it.

[12:46] And then what happened?

[12:47] It was quite clear that there were not 199 people willing to spend $25,000 on the pin

[12:56] and then the price started to slide down and dealers started to sell them for around

[13:01] $18,000.

[13:03] So imagine how you feel.

[13:05] If you're a buyer, you ran in and spent 25 and just a few months later, the game is

[13:10] selling for $7,000 less.

[13:13] None of this would have happened.

[13:15] None of it.

[13:16] And I mean this, if Stern Pimball had put an MSRP of this game at $15,000 like Batman

[13:24] SLE, they should have put the 50,000.

[13:26] $15,000 MSRP and then let the market determine the price.

[13:32] That is how Pimball should be.

[13:34] The value of a game should be passed on to the consumer and the market should set the

[13:40] price.

[13:41] So then you get to this James Bond game.

[13:43] The market didn't set the price, Stern did.

[13:47] And I knew this was an interesting thing when Stern decided to sell this game directly.

[13:52] They were going to broadcast to all of us in the world what they thought this game was

[13:58] worth.

[13:59] They were going to broadcast to everybody in the world how they feel about us, the Pimball

[14:03] Collector community.

[14:05] This was their moment.

[14:07] This was their moment to really think about it strategically.

[14:10] You know Stern has the smartest people in Pimball.

[14:13] They have the smartest engineers, the smartest designers, the smartest coders.

[14:18] They have the smartest businessmen.

[14:19] George Gomez is one of the biggest geniuses I've ever met.

[14:23] I have nothing but respect for him.

[14:25] But somewhere along the line as this game was being developed, they stood over this game.

[14:30] And as a company and as an organization, someone made the decision looking down at that

[14:36] game and said we can get $20,000 for this.

[14:42] The Pimball Buying Community is a bunch of suckers and they will buy this game.

[14:47] They made that decision.

[14:49] And they put that price on their website and they sold it directly on SternPimball.com

[14:56] for $19,995.

[14:59] I have images of it.

[15:00] And when you check out with sales tax and shipping, it is over $22,000 to get the machine

[15:08] to your door.

[15:09] Now, ladies and gentlemen, that happened on Wednesday.

[15:12] It is now just Thursday.

[15:14] Within 48 hours, what has happened?

[15:18] SternPimball has now removed the price of the machine from their website.

[15:24] I want each and every one of you to ask yourselves, why do you think Stern has removed the price

[15:29] of the game from its website?

[15:33] Because they're embarrassed by it.

[15:35] They don't want to stand behind it.

[15:38] And you know what they're doing now?

[15:40] Because now they realize there aren't 500 Neoma Crays out there who are James Bond

[15:45] fanatic and don't care about the money.

[15:47] They are realizing not only did they over price it, but they've enraged the Pimball community.

[15:54] And I'm glad that the Pimball community is enraged.

[15:58] I like going on Pinside and reading that 99% of us are all united.

[16:04] That you can usher out a game like this with barely anything in it and price it at this.

[16:11] This is the biggest slap in the face to the very community that is kept SternPimball so

[16:17] profitable over the years.

[16:20] And I don't care about Twippies.

[16:21] I don't care about Patreon subscribers.

[16:24] Everybody needs to hear this because I'm tired of hearing all of the other media just

[16:28] celebrate all of these moves by all of these companies.

[16:31] We need to call it like it is.

[16:34] For all of these years, who is kept SternPimball in business?

[16:37] It's been the people that have been buying all of these alleys.

[16:41] It's been the home collectors because your FOMO and your desire to own these great Pimball

[16:47] machines is the reason why distributors have been able to sell games so quickly.

[16:52] And it's because of the special version of these games.

[16:55] That's the reason why these distributors are able to sell them so quickly.

[16:59] It's also the reason why distributors order premiums and pros because to get a certain

[17:03] amount of alleys, they're also going to order the other stuff.

[17:06] And it was a great golden decade for Pimball.

[17:10] Nobody was greedy.

[17:11] Everybody saw the value in every single version of the game they got.

[17:16] We saw the value in the alleys.

[17:18] We saw the value in the premiums.

[17:20] We saw the value in the pros.

[17:22] Everybody had a seat at the Pimball table.

[17:26] Everybody was enjoying the meal they could afford.

[17:28] And then you go and do this, Stern.

[17:31] You raise a middle finger to the collector community and then you want to try to erase

[17:36] the evidence by taking the price of the game off your website.

[17:40] How do you think the internet works?

[17:43] It doesn't work like this, Stern.

[17:45] We remember.

[17:46] We remember what you priced the game at.

[17:49] We know how little you think about us now.

[17:52] And this is what makes me sad is I don't think this was Keith Ellwyn's decision.

[17:56] I don't even think it was really George Gomez's decision.

[17:58] I think this was a marketing decision by the new executive from over at Disney and the

[18:04] other guy over at Topstrading Cards.

[18:07] I really hope that Pimball does not get hijacked by people who just want to get as much profit

[18:13] as possible out of every single launch.

[18:15] I get it.

[18:16] You're a for profit company, but you can't kill the golden goose.

[18:21] Pimball existed in this great ecosystem in which everybody was satisfied.

[18:25] The companies were making multi millions of dollars.

[18:28] The community was having fun buying games that weren't the price of a car.

[18:32] And now it's all over.

[18:34] And it's not just Stern.

[18:35] JJP is doing the same idiotic thing.

[18:38] And the unfortunate thing for Stern Pimball is that Canadian Pimball podcast exists because

[18:43] I want to do shows like this that keep these companies accountable because this is not a

[18:48] good business practice.

[18:49] See here's the dilemma now for Stern Pimball.

[18:52] Do you want to know why they've removed the price from their website?

[18:55] It's real simple people.

[18:56] You don't even have to be as smart as I am.

[18:58] You know, I was private school educated.

[19:00] Here's why they removed the price.

[19:02] Because distributors were not able to sell all 500 machines, not even close.

[19:07] And so here's the other part.

[19:09] Stern probably gave these games to distributors for $15,000.

[19:14] It was a $5,000 thank you to every single distributor.

[19:17] But here's what's happening.

[19:19] Distributors can't sell the machine at $20,000 because look at this damn machine.

[19:24] I'm not even going to go over how pathetic it is that we even have to have a conversation

[19:28] about a machine.

[19:30] This baron, this ugly, this simple, it's just a simple machine.

[19:34] I get it.

[19:35] It probably shoots great.

[19:36] It's nothing against Keith Ellwyn's design.

[19:38] But Keith Ellwyn with a straight face would never sell you this game for $20,000.

[19:43] They can't sell it.

[19:44] The distributors can't find enough people to buy this machine.

[19:47] So what's happening now is behind the scenes, distributors are offering this game for

[19:52] less than $20,000.

[19:54] And here's the other part.

[19:56] One will not allow a distributor to advertise a price for this machine to be less than $20,000.

[20:05] And that is why they are removing the price from their website.

[20:09] They're trying to act as if none of this ever happened.

[20:13] And look, here's the thing.

[20:15] I would be willing for Stern Pimball to say we're sorry and change the price of this game

[20:20] to $15,000 and do a meocopa and stop trying to treat us like a bunch of fools.

[20:28] But they're not going to do that.

[20:30] And this is the most embarrassing moment since I've been covering Pimball for Stern Pimball.

[20:34] It really is embarrassing.

[20:36] This takes the cake.

[20:37] This is more embarrassing than Jersey Jack Pimball thinking Toy Story CE is worth $15,000.

[20:45] Because if we can't put Toy Story CE next to Wizard of Oz, which once cost $6,500 and

[20:52] has three times as much in the game.

[20:55] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you right now, there is an entire army of Pimball

[21:00] personalities and media that just wants you to buy everything.

[21:05] There is this narrative spreading through the Pimball space that to celebrate Pimball,

[21:10] we have to celebrate everything.

[21:12] And that's not the case.

[21:13] I love Stern Pimball.

[21:15] I've own Stern Pimball machines.

[21:17] I absolutely loved Lord of the Rings.

[21:20] It was my first Pimball machine.

[21:22] Lord of the Rings, which came out and cost like $57,000, has five times more magic in it

[21:30] than James Bond for $13,000.

[21:33] And it was designed by George Gomez.

[21:36] And either we're going to wake up everybody and get out of this coma where just theme alone

[21:41] and flow and artwork is all we demand for this much money.

[21:45] It's a total joke where it's all going.

[21:48] And nobody else wants to say this.

[21:50] See, this is what's so disappointing.

[21:52] I know they're capable of putting more magic into the games.

[21:56] How can you design a Lord of the Rings in 2004 with all of that cool stuff in it?

[22:03] And then in 2022, we get a plastic sex toy that just bobbles back and forth.

[22:10] And that's where Pimball is at.

[22:12] And then you're going to charge almost three times as much money for the James Bond.

[22:17] I'm telling you right now, labor and material costs and inflation should not have tripled

[22:23] the cost of Pimball machine over that period of time.

[22:28] And we're either as a community going to start demanding more.

[22:31] And here's the thing.

[22:33] If people stop running at these things, at these high price pins with half as much in

[22:38] them, the moment you stop running at them, guess what's going to happen?

[22:43] They're going to put more magic into the games.

[22:46] They're going to give you more for your money.

[22:48] It's that simple.

[22:49] And I'm looking at all of you super wealthy Pimball collectors.

[22:53] You need to pause a little bit.

[22:55] I get it doesn't matter to you that it's only money.

[22:58] But if you keep running at this stuff and you keep just throwing money at barren games

[23:04] like Toy Story 4 and games like James Bond's 60th, you're going to hurt it for everybody.

[23:11] Maybe just wait a little bit.

[23:12] Take your millions of dollars, go on a Hawaii vacation, do something else.

[23:17] But stop telling these Pimball companies that they should get a passing grade on games that

[23:24] aren't giving the value.

[23:26] And I asked a very simple question on my Facebook live the other night.

[23:30] And I think this is one of the most important questions we should be asking because Pimball

[23:35] is all about a magical world under glass.

[23:38] You should look down at a $20,000 Stern Pimball machine and see some magic.

[23:45] You should see some engineering marvel.

[23:47] You should see the ball do something it's never done before.

[23:51] You should see a mech you've never seen before.

[23:53] You should see incredible stuff for $20,000.

[23:57] This Stern Pimball machine should be Twilight Zone had a baby with tails of the Arabian

[24:02] Knights and they both are crack babies.

[24:04] That's what it should look like.

[24:06] Not this with no inner art blades and just flat black on the front of the game.

[24:11] You walk up to the most expensive Pimball machine ever and it's the most boring pin to walk

[24:16] up to.

[24:17] This is the one question I want all of you to ask.

[24:20] This is a period in time in which Pimball is the most expensive it's ever been in the

[24:25] history of Pimball.

[24:26] I want to ask you one simple question.

[24:29] Over the last two years, name me one magical or truly innovative mechanism that has been

[24:35] put into a Pimball machine over the last two years by these 12 companies making Pimball

[24:42] machines other than the Godzilla building.

[24:46] There are 12 companies making Pimball machines right now and I could go back during the Valley

[24:51] Williams error and one game alone would have five more magical mechs than all of these

[24:57] new games combined.

[24:59] Everybody, I'm not demanding this stuff.

[25:01] No one's forcing us to buy Pimball but this is the most expensive Pimball has ever been

[25:07] and what this James Bond launch has done.

[25:10] For me at least, it's opened our eyes to how little they think of us and this is the

[25:16] thing and this is why Canada is unpopular with other shows and other people and other

[25:21] personalities because they're all trying to sell you games and I get it, everyone in

[25:27] the industry, their livelihood is connected to the consistent sale of Pimball.

[25:33] Everyone who works at Stern Pimball's livelihood is connected to it.

[25:36] Everyone who's a distributor is connected to it.

[25:39] Even the operators are somewhat connected to it and for the love of everybody's livelihood,

[25:45] the greatest way to preserve the livelihood of all of these people is to make quality

[25:52] games that have the value in them that make us want to buy them and not question whether

[25:59] or not we're being ripped off.

[26:02] And all you got to do is go back a few years and that's when we had the Golden Goose.

[26:08] Everybody was winning, everybody was making money, everybody was happier and you can tell

[26:13] by the vibe of the community that the vibe was so much more positive.

[26:18] We can't let the COVID feeding frenzy on prices dictate the future of Pimball.

[26:25] Everybody thank you so much for listening to Canada's Pimball podcast.

[26:28] I hope other people realize I'm doing this because I love this hobby.

[26:32] I get branded as a toxic negative person.

[26:36] It's not toxic and negative to spit the truth like this.

[26:40] If you're not a Canadian club member, we would love to have you and if you haven't voted

[26:44] yet in the Twippies for favorite Pimball podcast, here's your chance and you know, you know,

[26:49] if we win number six, I'm going to put those cargo shorts on and I'm going to march into

[26:53] TpF and I'm going to hoist that trophy up for each and every one of you who voted.

[26:58] Have a good day, everybody.

[27:10] I'm going to take it now.

[27:17] We ain't going to take it.

[27:20] We ain't going to take it anymore.

[27:24] Just try and make us.

[27:27] We ain't going to take it.

[27:29] Come on.

[27:30] We ain't going to take it.

[27:32] You're all worth the sum.

[27:33] We ain't going to take it anymore.

[27:36] Get loose, one.

[27:38] Oh, and I'm going to take it.

[27:40] I'm going to spit it now.

[27:42] We ain't going to take it.

[27:43] Oh, you will fall away.

[27:45] And I'm going to take it.

[27:47] And you are all.
