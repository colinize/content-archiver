[00:00] Don't tell me what to do, and don't tell me what to say, please, when I go out with you, don't put me on display.

[00:16] Welcome to episode 162 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. I wish you could see where I'm

[00:31] podcasting from right now. I'm in my bedroom, which is just cluttered with so much stuff. I have no bed in the apartment right now.

[00:39] Tonight, Bubba and I moved back into the apartment. We've been living it in a hotel for two weeks. I messed up. I forgot to order the air mattress to get here on the day I needed it.

[00:53] I'm too lazy to go get one. I'm going to be sleeping on a hardwood floor tonight. I'm in an empty bedroom with just a bunch of stuff. No bed.

[01:04] I feel a little bit empty inside in the world of Pinball. I want to explain why on this episode of Canadian's Pinball Podcast, what we're going to do on this episode.

[01:13] We're going to talk about some news items. I do want to go back. I want to fill in some more of my thoughts around the developments, deep root Pinball, because I've been hearing more and more today.

[01:26] If there's anything I do really appreciate about the Pinball hobby, it's that it's a small community of people and news travels, information travels.

[01:37] People really do want to help each other out. People really do want to make sure that the right thing happens to this hobby, and that people who are infiltrating the hobby to hurt it or do things that are wrong and incomprehensible.

[01:54] The hobby will bond together and stand against those sort of individuals. We'll go into that.

[02:01] Let's talk about some news items that have been happening in the world of Pinball.

[02:08] Number one, I thought it was really cool to see Spooky Pinball deliver the first total nuclear annihilation to Ed Robertson.

[02:19] I watched a little bit of the video, not too much, but when I heard they did that and I saw the video and I saw how happy Scott was and all the people there and how happy Ed was, and then playing the game for the first time, it sort of was a much needed reminder.

[02:35] For me and maybe for you guys, if you saw it, it just reminded me what this hobby should all be about.

[02:42] Getting together with your friends, playing Pinball, having good time. Right? Ed's got a nice collection, but I've talked to Ed at shows and he's a great guy.

[02:52] Ed doesn't give a shit about chasing L.E.s and chasing rarity and chasing every new and box game that comes out there.

[03:00] He buys games that he enjoys playing and then he moves on when he gets tired of them and he brings a new game in and he's got a great collection.

[03:07] But he enjoys playing Pinball. He really enjoys playing Pinball.

[03:11] This is just a class act. It was a smart move on Spooky's part. It was great PR, great marketing. I talk all the time about how bad so many of these companies are.

[03:22] When it comes to doing things that excite the community and getting people pumped and sort of just super hyped to get the game.

[03:32] I know everyone who's in on a total nuclear annihilation is really excited to get it. They were really excited to see how they gave it to Ed and see how happy Scott is.

[03:43] At the end of the day, it makes everyone who buys this machine feel really good. Feel really good about supporting Scott, about supporting Spooky, about supporting this company that over the last few years has done nothing but deliver on the promises they've made to people.

[04:02] I might give Spooky shit every once in a while because their games might not be as great as I'd like them to be.

[04:09] But in the end, on a day like today, we're on one side of the spectrum. We have Spooky Pinball and on the other side of the spectrum, we have John Papaduke resurfacing again.

[04:24] John Papaduke taking over a million dollars from people and not delivering a working game to a single person and Spooky Pinball probably has just barely taken a million dollars and they've delivered every single game to every single person that's ever ordered a single game from them.

[04:47] I'm starting to really, really think that we have to have to at this time, especially this time, really support the people that are doing it right. It doesn't mean you have to buy their games. It's just making me see this whole hobby completely differently than I have even recently.

[05:10] Congratulations to Ed and Scott and Charlie and company for doing that awesome thing. I think people need it to see some good news and read about a new game coming out that is bringing smiles to people's faces and those 200 people that are on the wait list.

[05:26] I know you guys can't wait to get your games and the good news is you'll get them soon.

[05:30] All right, ACDC premiums are ready to ship. There is finally some photography of what the game is. It's, you know what, I kept feeling like this would be some sort of like magical vault edition sort of things would be touched up and made much better the way Spider-Man was given the new treatment.

[05:52] But this is basically ACDC premium if you want to buy it again. The few things that Stern did change on this game, they removed the drummer from the band in the upper right corner. It's kind of funny. It's just a black character outline of a human where he used to be. So he no longer exists in the game, which is really funny to see.

[06:13] The other thing that they did was they allow people now to remove that middle lower playfield sort of like the plastic piece that covers the lower playfield.

[06:25] There used to be an insert. Now it's a removable piece of plastic and you can see the screws that keep it in place. Now when I saw this photo and I part of me is just always confused as to why people who are in the game are not in the game.

[06:42] People who do the final glance at a machine and say, you know what, this is as good as we could do it. Why people look at silver screws that are in front of a black area as being good enough.

[06:58] You look at the picture. There's plenty of pictures on the inside of what that area looks like and you've got this black outline where there's like that devil head. And it's the contour that's all black. And then you have these glaring silver screws.

[07:13] I know I'm nitpicking and it doesn't matter. But again, it's just it just always crushes me that the details just get sort of overlooked. It's like let's just do whatever is easiest. Let's not do it looks best.

[07:28] And I think people are trying to see if the game has lollipop rails or not as an indication of whether or not Stern is pulling more quality out of the machine.

[07:38] But I don't think there's been confirmation on whether or not it has lollipop rails. And you know, look, if you want ACDC, now you can go get a new one. Right. There's no harm to fowl. Stern wants to rerun ACDC. So so be it. I don't really think there's tons of people who want another chance at an ACDC premium because there's just so many ACDCs out in the wild.

[08:02] But I'll say this. I know some people who don't like ACDC. I know a lot more people that love ACDC and consider to be one of Stern's best machines ever. I have a friend in the city who has a Lucy edition.

[08:17] He loves it. He didn't even realize he was getting like this rare edition. Now he's got something that's worth more than he paid.

[08:23] But it's good to see that you can go get a new one now if you want one. It's not the game for me, but if it's the game for you, you can go get it.

[08:32] All right. Batman 66 owners. This thread's funny. These guys have had now almost an entire year of sitting on this game waiting for it to be done.

[08:45] So now these guys have so much time. There are all of them are just if you read the thread, it's kind of hysterical. They're just sort of all adding meaningless mods to this game because they've got nothing else to do.

[08:56] They keep dropping more toys and back girls and back copters and backboats into the play field. None of it is interactive. None of it works with the game. None of it's making the game better.

[09:09] When will Lyman Sheets finish this game? That is the big question mark. Now that we know that Guardians of the Galaxy will not be at expo, my hunch is that another Christopher French game is finally going to get the 1.0 treatment.

[09:29] And that Stern is going to release Batman code for expo in time for expo and they almost have to the reason why they have to is if you remember and it's crazy to remember this far back is that it was a year ago that Stern showed us Batman 66 for the first time at expo got everybody excited made everybody buy out the LEDs sold out of the SLEs that was a year ago.

[09:57] And the game is still not done and this has been one of those painful waits for Batman 66 owners for all Stern owners if you went in on this game you have been waiting patiently. So I think Stern is going to use expo as a chance to have Lyman there explain why it took so long, drop the code and sort of try and drop the mic.

[10:19] If you guys out there want a Batman I believe you can still go get the premiums right the LEDs are sold out and there is actually a super LED I think this is number two that is now on eBay for the bargain price of fourteen thousand dollars so now's your chance to go get it at least it's real at least it's a real pin.

[10:39] Alright what else is going on in the world so as I said no game of thrones sorry I keep saying game of thrones no guardians of the galaxy the reason why I always say that in my notes I always write GOTG right and my brain is just wired when I have pinball notes it has a GOT to say game of thrones and that's why I always mess up pronouncing guardians of the galaxy.

[11:06] Okay now the other big rumor that is going around is that JJP number four which is pirates of the Caribbean is going to be at expo like this is I've heard this now multiple times I've heard it from many people and I I kind of believe it now I mean Jack is going to show up with this game this game has been worked on for a while and what do we know about Pirates of the Galaxy?

[11:36] Caribbean we don't know much the rumors are that it is not going to include Johnny Depp which I don't get how you make pirate to the Caribbean without Johnny Depp but that being said a pirate theme is really interesting and if we are to sort of think about all the things you could do with the pirate theme there's a lot there's a lot now I'm hearing some rumors I'm hearing some rumors

[12:05] so here's what I'm hearing from the rumor mill of someone who knows someone who claims they know someone who seen a photo of pirates of the Caribbean okay now if you believe that then maybe you'll believe what I'm about to tell you what I'm hearing about Pirates of the Caribbean

[12:23] I'm hearing it has like three spinning discs okay I'm hearing that I'm hearing it has like a moving upper playfield portion sort of like the upper left corner of Indiana Jones where it tilts back and forth you know maybe you have to I don't know I don't know what's going on there I'm going to also hear to have some sort of catapult toy of some sort so you're going to fire the ball maybe to cannon that shoots it these are all just

[12:53] unconfirmed rumors that I am hearing about someone who says they know someone who knows someone who knows someone who saw it take it for what it is it's a pirate theme it's not too hard to make up what you might think is in that game right so I don't know I I can't wait to see it right I can't wait to see all new pinball machines I also think that it's going to be a theme that no one really wants

[13:20] and it's a shame because I think Jack keeps missing on the theme I think he's always got all this hard work if you could just get the theme right the other thing I'm hearing which is absolutely probably almost all but confirmed is that Pat Lawler's making toy story so knowing that I think people are just going to pass on pirates because it's it's hard now is Jack's games are worth the money but they're also like the value if the theme is not there is hard to find the theme is not there

[13:49] is hard to like go in because we're seeing Hobbit Smowg Edition sell for $6,000 now and those were $9,000 pinball machines new just a year ago so I don't know people are going to be running to buy these things if they want the next game you know at this price point it's got to be a theme that you never want to let go for a while for a while at least more than a couple years so curious

[14:18] curious to see how the community responds the pirates of the Caribbean and why is it Guardians of the Galaxy going to be at expo so this is the problem that I've been trying to figure out like why isn't

[14:31] going to show Guardians why are they going to delay that is it just because of Batman 66 code no I don't think that's the case we all know that Texas pinball festival is too far out for them to reveal Guardians of the Galaxy which means Guardians is not going to get the show reveal it deserves it's not going to be in the spotlight like it deserves to be in and and board deserves to be there

[14:59] and it should be the game that they pull the curtain off on and steal the thunder away from probably Jersey Jack and the only reason I can think of why that's not happening is it's a business decision and that Star Wars is not selling as much as Stern hoped it would or would have liked it to and so they are going to try to make expo the Star Wars show the Pro-Wrestle show

[15:28] the problem is this everyone's mind is made up on Star Wars everyone's mind is made up so you either love the theme so much that you're willing to overlook the fact that this is probably the worst theme integrated Star Wars pinball machine we've ever had it's also probably the most disappointing Stern pinball launch I've ever seen and it's just a game that is average

[15:56] and you either think that which I think most people do or you're just so enamored by the Star Wars theme that you don't care and you're willing to own it okay I think people fall on both sides defense I don't think anyone out there is really being like man Stern knocked this game out of the park it's awesome it's their best pin ever

[16:17] in fact I want to read something I want to read something because part of me was worried that I maybe was too harsh on Star Wars and and once owners got them they would realize what I what I couldn't see they would have an experience that showed that I was being too critical that the game was actually really fun and satisfying and and brought the Star Wars universe to life so there is a pinside user who got his Star Wars Ellie

[16:45] and he's so eloquently described what it was like opening it and playing it and experiencing Star Wars Ellie and this is a pinside user who has bought many new inbox Stern machines and he basically created a thread that said Star Wars is my last new inbox Stern and I want to read what pinside user was a glass air pilot glass air pilot rights okay he wrote so my Star Wars Ellie arrives for the Star Wars

[17:14] for $8,700 the art is rather dull in my opinion and I even put in the premium back glass art since everyone I asked at it was much better I actually like the gameplay the hyperspace loop is cool and the shots are challenging but the death star shot is too tough considering it is such an important shot it blows my mind that they made this one shot so tough my biggest aggravation though is the fact that this nearly 9,000

[17:44] dollar machine did not come with a shaker motor yeah I know I should have read the description better but really that is like ordering a new top of the line Lincoln and having to pay extra for air conditioning that put me over the edge

[18:00] furthermore the lack of the lack of thought of the callouts especially when you are saving the princess is annoying laya will say the same thing seven to eight times in each mode and it makes me wish I had a blast or to shoot her instead of saving her I just feel that Stern is cranking these out too fast and we don't get what we could have been a great game now whose fault is that well that is easy ours I'm done with the craze and will look to

[18:30] her remakes jjp or bison classics I just don't see 9,000 dollars as a good deal anymore considering the stripping of object option sorry the stripping of options and a rushed product okay sorry I'm like in this room too and it's like my apartment is dusty because of all the construction so I'm getting a little like dry mouth in here all right so this is kind of what I knew it happened and I think a lot of people have been feeling this

[19:00] way it's not just on Star Wars right it's overall there is a dark cloud that is starting to hover over the new inbox collectors world and it's and blue skies are not ahead we all believed that the promise of new pimble was going to deliver magic was going to deliver games that was good

[19:25] were that was creative and innovative and well thought out as the games from the nineties and I think it's fair to say that the last five years of pimble has barely barely even scratch the surface of coming up with the same type of magic that the nineteen nineties brought to pimble

[19:51] and I think a lot of people in this hobby they thought they were part of this resurgence that would make games so good and they would have Christmas morning three four times a year as these new and box pimble machines arrived and they opened them up and the games blew them away

[20:10] and I think it's been somewhat of the opposite I think over the past five years we've had a mixture of a few things we've had the dominant player in pimble stern pimble really struggle to up the any they definitely gave us amazing themes they definitely gave us a lot of pimble and we have to be thankful that stern did that because as we'll see when I continue this sort of speech

[20:40] most other manufacturers delivered us nothing so stern is the number one player they drive the market but instead of driving the products forward they stripped things out of the games they made the games cheaper maybe they had to do that to survive remember stern collapses everybody collapses there is no pimble market anymore maybe spooky survives maybe Jersey jack but for the most part stern wood

[21:09] it's like the titanic going down everyone else will get sucked into it into the wake of of like that big ship going down so that is like I think what a lot of people are feeling now because for most people the only option they've had if they want to get a new machine has been a new stern

[21:30] and more and more and more it's harder and harder to justify the fact that stern le's used to be sixty five hundred dollars maybe even cheaper with the street price and now they're near the price of Jersey jack pimble machines they're nine thousand dollars for these le's and there is no way to justify the value which leads me to my next point is stern had marketing gold when it had the le and the pro

[21:58] it really it tapped into something that people wanted the problem is they then fail to deliver anything that is worthy of the name limited edition they've absolutely ruined the what the badging of limited edition right they've ruined what it stands for they ruined what you can expect from it

[22:22] now limited edition means nothing it's not just a quantity thing right it's not just like oh they're making too many it's they're making so many and there's nothing in it to justify the price see limited edition should be special right it should be really really special if if an AMG version of an S class Mercedes is the limited edition version

[22:49] and you get in the base level Mercedes and you don't feel a difference between the two models when you're playing or driving then you've got to be kidding me that you're going to say that that's the limited like higher and premium version of the product

[23:07] and so it's all just been marketing godly gook it's all just been smoking mirrors and I think it's caught up to stern and I think you guys feel that right now you're just you're kind of tired you're kind of fed up I feel the same way you'll probably notice on my podcast I'm starting to sound fatigue and tired and bored and a little bit over the new inbox craze because it's just failed to deliver right and so in over those five year periods

[23:35] you couple that fact that like the only one is really consistently making games is making games that are below the standards you'd like for the prices you're paying you're then left with Jersey Jack who just can't get you the theme you really want

[23:51] you're then left with spooky who you feel great about as a company but the games you know just don't deliver for you and then you're left with Andrew highway who burned you Dutch pinball who burned you John Papaduke who burned you Kevin who burned you right

[24:10] you know P3 which you don't really know if you want you know it's just it's just a pinball circus where's that at you know it's just it's just it's this chain of or this this row of companies that are just done absolutely nothing right and so when start you know and I spend saying it like Star Wars is the tipping point it was going to take the game that everybody was the most excited about to be the most disappointed in that would add up to the game

[24:39] and then that would actually get the behavioral change right and as this owner says it's our fault for buying it and I had a friend I read this guy's comments to a friend of mine and my friend just wrote back and said yeah but he bought one see that's the problem is he bought one anyway

[24:55] which means he never played it he never played it he never stood in front of one he never spent a bunch of time on it before he sent in his money on one and that is what Stern has created a hobby in which people have been running after something site unseen throwing money at it before the even know they like it or they really want to keep it or really want to play it right he's frustrated with the shots he's frustrated with the game

[25:25] he's the artwork he's frustrated with the design the layout he's frustrated with the call outs and you bought one you it's like you know you can go test drive these things you know if you just wait you can go test drive it and you can play it and you can play a friend you can play one on location you can play one out of show

[25:43] keep hearing more and more people saying that's what I'm going to do from now on that's what I'm going to do I'm not going to run because what's the fear of missing out on a limited edition version of something that's not even special

[25:56] and Stern has made it that way right now and who knows it might change immediately if Christopher Frenchy and John Borg show an Ellie of Guardians that just blows you away right you take my money now before even seeing if it plays right that's how this hobby

[26:12] but you know I really think it's changed I for the first time I think people are probably are fed up enough to realize it's time to change the behavior

[26:21] it's time to start making sure you want these things it's it's it's not rewarding to unbox it and then a week later want to get rid of it I'm I've already seen a Star Wars Ellie up for sale immediately 7700 bucks for sale

[26:33] you know I expect to see so many Star Wars up for sale over the next four months we're going to see it the second other pins come out that are new everyone's going to dump their Star Wars you will be able to get a Star Wars Ellie a year from now a year from now it brand new 8700 watch 6700 or less Star Wars Ellie's will sell for it will be the exact same thing as Game of Thrones they made a lot of them it's not a great machine

[27:02] the art package I would even say the Game of Thrones Ellie package is much nicer looking other than the crappy playfield art but the cabinet art the cabinet armor the top or all that much nicer looking than Star Wars is I think Steve Richie needs to retire at expo I think he needs to he's done and he's done he's done get get you gave him the biggest theme in the history of of themes and this is what he made he's done

[27:31] time to retire all right now let me get on to my final point because when I say I feel just like this emptiness this this feeling that something is something wrong something a miss is happening in our hobby you know it's deep root and I've been thinking about this for the last few days and obviously because I'm a magical owner I'm personally invested in this story and what's going on but today even more I'm going to be able to get a new one

[28:01] more things are happening around this company and and here's basically what's happening because I just don't think people should be able to do things in this small little community of ours and just get away with it without you guys knowing the truth and knowing what's going on behind the scenes and knowing who the who these real individuals are so I called up deep root I spoke to Robert you know and he gave me you know

[28:28] I was like vague answers on everything going on and how they want to make everything right they want to make everything right and it was very like cordial nice like gentlemen conversation

[28:39] so there's clearly another side to Robert that I didn't get on that phone call but I've been hearing you know things that he's doing and things that he's trying to accomplish to make this John pop a deal of his work

[28:54] now if we step back for a minute you know Robert is a businessman he's someone who I you know I've talked to people who have known him from Texas from other things he's worked on you know I do a little homework and he's a businessman he's been a very successful businessman

[29:11] and he uses money and influence to make deals happen so he is now probably trying to accomplish the hardest deal of his life the hardest deal of his life which is partnering with John pop a Duke

[29:28] getting permission to make magic girl in all the rosas and also wonderlands getting the right permission and people in place to reengineer magic girl because it doesn't work to then figure out how to manufacture them because he has no manufacturing knowledge of pimple

[29:46] and then actually like fixing making and shipping the industries white whale mythological game called magic girl and I've been deconstructing this on a lot of levels

[30:00] but something that I heard today just really upset me and I saw it and I'm inside and it's the fact that Robert wants zombie yedi to sign over his artwork to deeproot

[30:14] so they can remake magic girls and zombie yedi was basically like fuck you like I'm not doing that zombie yedi spent five years plus of his life working with John pop a Duke maybe

[30:29] was four years but he spent an inordinate amount of time working with john slaving away you know probably didn't get compensated at his normal rates

[30:41] because he you know he got really excited it was pimple he was going to go the extra mile we saw that in the doby video he like he gave more than john ever paid him because he was so excited to be part of pimple history

[30:54] and what did he get in the end he got paid but he didn't get his machine and you know john just completely like fuck them over in so many other ways right

[31:07] john completely fucked over the guy who's coding the machine apple juice over there in the UK you know we never sent that guy a game either

[31:15] and so you know the problem is this with john pop a Duke is when Robert tells me oh john's a nice guy talk to john's family you know john doesn't mean harm

[31:25] john's not toxic you he's hearing that story from john pop a Duke like of course john so easily puts on that like me like timit like victim like sweet guy who's just trying to make

[31:43] pimple and the bottom line is this it wasn't john pop a Duke who made the games you love yes like he had designs for these games and he's got a very creative flare

[31:55] but it was the team of people at Valley Williams that when john went home and thought he had invented genius they went to work burning the midnight candles making john's ideas and concepts actually work okay

[32:12] that is what made john pop a Duke great john you know the artist who put great art in john's game because john does understand the need for good art the good for you know creative design

[32:25] but zombie Eddie got burned you know mad Andrews I think he finally got paid by American pinball the coder was never fully paid

[32:35] but it's not just those three individuals there are so many other people that gave john parts that gave john help that gave john assistance that john turned his back on and just basically like a pariah like took from these individuals and gave nothing back

[32:54] and what about all those people what about all those people that got stabbed in the back or never got anything you know this this notion that that john just gets to walk through the pinball hobby like some sort of deity who who can never die you can never go away that he should keep being resurrected

[33:16] every time he fails someone's there to pick him up with with the promise of making magic girl and raza and Alice and and and what's the one common denominator that everyone always thinks they can solve john's problems with it's with money

[33:32] and so you know Robert is trying a strong arms zombie Eddie into getting the artwork now why does he need the artwork well I don't know my guess is this this is just a guess

[33:44] if they're going to remake magic girl and they need to make changes to the game which we all know they need to do because the game doesn't function properly the way it is then they're going to have to change the artwork and they're going to have to redraw things and move things around and the and it's not going to look right unless zombie Eddie does his artwork

[34:04] you know zombie Eddie might also own the rights to using his his artwork on these machines and and john might have had permission to sell X amount of games using his artwork so if these guys want to make an unlimited amount

[34:16] the zombie Eddie was compensated for an unlimited amount now I believe all of this is just so forward looking that it's almost laughable that we're discussing it like this like like magic girls that are working are about to come out

[34:32] because other things I've learned today is deep root pinball isn't where is deep root pinball what where is the company where is the manufacturing where is the know how to make pinball machines you know how are they going to do all that I'm sure Robert because he is a man of means will pay individuals who know a thing or two about pinball or engineering money to try and find the way to do it

[35:00] and I'm not just saying this because I own a magic girl it makes absolutely no sense to remake magic girl the only the people who bought magic girls all got them the fact that they're not starting with raza which is the game that no one has received which is the game that makes the most sense to start with is a head scratcher to make it

[35:29] remember remember remember the re and again if you why is that why aren't they starting with raza they there's no no one was promised more magic girls and didn't get them other than the you know zombie Eddie and the code or maybe a few vendors who got screwed but you know the fact that they're starting with magic girl it's I don't know are you I believe it's like this here's my hunch on why it has to be magic girl I believe

[35:57] I believe hunch number one is that raza is not where near complete john when have you ever seen raza mechanism when have you ever seen raza anything I was on the zidware blog I saw everything there was to see around raza I saw a game that had artwork that had so much IP and Frenchman on it that they could never release it like that like john just have them he just had them draw things that he had no permission to use so that whole thing needs to be redrawn

[36:27] because of all that IP issues that are occurring in that game okay but even then all you had was like a raza layout right very much like john's Houdini layout you know he's he's a master at putting down on paper what looks like a pinball machine like everything's where it should be but he hasn't designed it yet in a working fashion

[36:50] he hasn't been flipping raza he doesn't have mechanisms and this and that and all the magic people expect from a jpop game designed for that game okay now I was thinking to like remember the only reason john had to introduce raza to the world is because he ran out of money with magic girl remember

[37:13] raza was the Ponzi scheme title to keep money coming in when he was when he was done with spending all the magic girl buyers money he needed more money what did he do did he go get an investor did he go like take a loan out

[37:29] did he go do the right thing no he said I've got game number two and all of a sudden everyone threw money at him and he kept using that raza money to develop magic girl

[37:40] and then what happened when that money ran out hey I got game number three also wonderland send your money now and people actually did you know so that was always john's plan his plan was always to finish the game of his dreams

[37:56] to finally figure out how to make a game that would show he was the greatest pinball designer in the world and he would capitalize on pinball's resurgence so he created his opus his chinese democracy of the pinball world and he called it magic girl magic girl it was the game that would be the greatest game of all time he told chris from coin taker I want you guys to really listen this is the trick

[38:25] this is the truth this is the men we are dealing with right he told chris from coin taker right before he sent Chris his game that this was his best work to date okay Chris goes to plunge the ball and it didn't even plunge he looks down and sees there's not even a shooter lane groove cut into the playfield nothing hardly anything on magic girl works yet john told him it was his best game ever

[38:54] and see what world are we living in okay are we gonna start to look at these individuals for who they are what they've actually done and their actions are going to define how their reputations you know how the reputations are in the pinball world so you have john who did this whole thing and now Robert Robert over a deep route wants to salvage and save that entire palm the scheme pinball plan that john had put in place

[39:24] and he wants to do the first thing is make more magic girls and all that does is screw over everybody who bought a magic girl because they're gonna get screwed I am and like I'm not denying it you make unlimited versions of magic girl

[39:38] and and then you lied to the people who gave you sixteen thousand dollars because they thought they were getting a very limited machine so you're gonna lie to them now you want to fuck them over by making an unlimited amount

[39:49] the right thing to do is just be start with raza and then you at least you get those people the game they deserve and you gotta give them one to one on the dollar for their credit that they gave john

[39:59] but the whole thing makes no sense if they were smart if they were smart what they would do what they would do if they want to work with john so badly is they would why would they ever get back in bed with the zidware shit show

[40:14] why would they ever do that if they were smart they would just let john design a new game why not let john just design a new game right why not just make john pop it into who deany remember who deany is an open IP

[40:29] anybody can make a who deany game you can make two who deany games at the same time and there's nothing anyone could do to stop you because it's open IP

[40:38] you can't have the exclusive who deany pinball machine right that's why john love that theme so much it's john's dream theme by the way if you look at the original magic girl he's got who deany's face in one of the plastics above the pop bumpers in the prototype who deany is the man he's obsessed with he's obsessed with magicians

[40:59] okay now the other reason I was getting to this I kind of went around it the other reason why I think they want to remake magic or more than anything more than anything is that magic girl represents john pop a duke's pride his pride has been destroyed by his inability to give the world the game that he promised them and magic girl it's his it's like cathedral

[41:28] he keeps building it higher and higher and higher yet none of it reaches the heavens yet none of it will ever be done the center mechanism of that game of that game of the one game that I'm looking at right now that center mechanism is the ultimate metaphor for john pop a duke's mind when it comes to designing pinball lately

[41:51] he just doesn't know when to stop he just doesn't know how to make anything work and instead of taking stuff out instead of making something just function that's fun he keeps adding another layer and says I'll get to that later

[42:09] look at the center mechanism on the playfield on the playfield there's one this is the layers of that center Mac the layers that have to work there's one there's two there's three there's four there's like four layers of how the ball is supposed to travel first the ball is supposed to go over this like vertical up kick plunger that's in the middle underneath that center Mac right and supposed to ball is supposed to get magnetized there

[42:39] I don't even I don't think john even like ever even got that to work with the ball moving at normal velocity so anyway supposed to magnetize there then the vertical up kicker is supposed to shoot the ball up in up through the middle of that ramp goes past the magnet flip second layer up until the this like ring this guy with like his arms out and he's got like a circle ring this mystic ring that's supposed to grab the ball

[43:08] mid air using a magnet right all those things are there in the game I've got a magnet I've got the vertical up kicker kicks the ball through I've got the middle portion with the magnet flippers and none of it works none of it works so what the fuck did he do for five years he burned through 1.2 million dollars of customer money he burned through another hundreds of thousands of dollars of dovels money and he burned through a lot of money

[43:37] and he burned through a hundred thousand dollars or more bill brand is his money and now he's found the guy that claims to know the pinball business better than anybody so Robert who's who knows pinball better than anyone who's seen john pop a dude burn through the money of very smart men a very successful business men but now he's going to make it work now he's going to make it work and seeing what he's trying to do to zombie yeti

[44:07] seeing how he's got this desire to like strong arm and threaten people and try to like use his money and influence to get his way I don't think that's going to play in the pinball world I don't think it's going to play with consumers I don't think it's going to play with people

[44:26] and none of that none of that puts a good feeling in anybody's mind or hearts about this company and I don't you know I don't know when they're now they're going to when they're going to come out and actually make an official statement so this is where we're at this is where pinball is out people another john pop a duke bail out situation I don't want to talk about this crap anymore I just wish this stuff would go away for good

[44:56] I wish the 25 magical owners could work together to try to figure out a solve without john and I wish zombie yeti could move on with pinball and focus on his stern machines and put that chapter behind him I wish that everyone who got burned by raza you know I wish you guys would get your games but not this way I don't even want it to be from john pop a duke I wish some other company like just bought the rights to run the game

[45:26] raza designed it properly and just made it and kicked them to the curb you know john pop a duke is like George Lucas you're just going to get a better product when you kick his ass to the curb he might have had some great concepts and ideas that he was able to execute in his youth but he clearly has shown that he has no no right being anywhere near his very own creations anymore

[45:55] and that is who john pop a duke is he is the George Lucas of pinball and it's just it's just time for like either robber to tell everybody what his plans are to show that he has the ability to manufacture pinball but I just think this thing is going to be a fiasco that continues to go on and on and on you know it was it was enough talking about the Dutch pinball fiasco the highway pinball fiasco now he throw another new like fiasco into the main

[46:24] fiasco into the mix and it gets old it gets tiring it wears everybody out who's excited about new pinball because it hurts the hobby this stuff hurts the hobby there's no other way around it we should be spending page after page congratulating spooky page after page getting excited about born french is new guardians machine page after page you know getting excited about what could possibly be in pirates of the Caribbean that should be pinball that should be this hobby

[46:54] that these like these investors with their legal suits and their contracts and strong arming people and trying to give john another shot that is no place in this hobby anymore no place and again the only people that can allow it to survive is you and me if we say no we say we're not going to buy this shit it changes the ability for this guy to keep resurfacing all right

[47:23] that's it for episode 162 of canators pinball podcast I'm trying to get Ted on the show it was my fault tonight he was going to come on I didn't have the right computer I'm going to go try and find a place to sleep in this apartment where there's no bed no pillow nothing I've got a match sleep on top of the magic girl I should just sleep on and be like oh and dream of it working it'd be amazing all right guys I'll talk to you real soon have a good day

[47:53] but just now you never left somebody like me before that easy
