[00:00] I'll be your friend.

[00:06] I love you, carry on.

[00:13] I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said I said, I said, I said, I said.

[00:15] Ah, you know, I never thought it would be this hard to put on the microphone and just

[00:20] talk to people out there about pinball, but as a new dad, and as someone right now who

[00:25] has no daycare, I have no let up on my work schedule.

[00:30] We have no family help.

[00:32] It has been really, really taxing this December just trying to get the headset on to talk pinball,

[00:39] but here I am, and I'm trying to do this early in the morning because I don't have any free

[00:43] space or free time anymore.

[00:45] But let's talk about pinball.

[00:46] Let's talk about what's going on in the pinball world, and it's a little bit of a low, right?

[00:50] This December time period as we're waiting for Rush Pinball to be revealed.

[00:54] There's not much happening.

[00:56] Now in years past, Canadian might have drummed up his own drama, but for the most part,

[01:02] everything I talk about on this show is me reacting to what is going on in the pinball

[01:06] world.

[01:07] And so, as I see stuff like Haggis Pinball's latest update on Fathom Pinball, am I allowed

[01:13] to react to it until you my point of view on it or am I supposed to say, you know what,

[01:18] they're going to get those games out and, you know, just cheerly them through the holiday

[01:22] season.

[01:23] It's a little bit of both.

[01:24] It's a little bit of both.

[01:25] I do want to start with Haggis Pinball.

[01:27] I'll also tell you why I sold my Godzilla Ellie, and we'll talk about why I think Jersey

[01:33] Jack Pinball needs to figure something out because we need more than one game a year from

[01:37] J.J.P.

[01:38] Okay?

[01:39] And we'll talk about the Stern rumors a little bit, and that's what we're going to do

[01:42] on this episode of Canadian Pinball podcast.

[01:44] So let's talk about Haggis.

[01:46] Let's talk about history repeating itself.

[01:49] Let's talk about how we've seen this movie before.

[01:52] Now, what I want to talk about, I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about this

[01:56] a little bit from a philosophical level.

[01:59] On why is it in the Pinball world?

[02:01] We sometimes like to think that this time it will be different.

[02:06] This time, the result will be different, even though everything we're seeing to date

[02:12] seems very familiar and we've seen it before.

[02:16] And you can go down the checklist of what we're seeing happening right now.

[02:19] To take pre-order money, you tell people their games are going to go into production on

[02:25] a certain date.

[02:27] So you take their money and you promise a date.

[02:30] Then you miss that date.

[02:33] Then you come up with excuses why you miss that date.

[02:36] Then you come up with a new date.

[02:38] And all throughout this period, you're usually making videos from the factory in which we never

[02:43] see any workers on the lines making games.

[02:47] Why is that?

[02:48] Every time these Pinball beauty companies who release videos to convince us everything

[02:53] is fine, right?

[02:54] Everything is fine.

[02:55] Everything is going according to our new schedule because we missed the five previous schedules.

[03:01] Everything is fine and here I am.

[03:03] Pinball manufacturer, wealthy business man who decided to go into Pinball manufacturing.

[03:07] And there's nobody here.

[03:09] I'm at my company and nobody's here except for the guy maybe running the camera but who

[03:13] even knows if there's someone behind the camera.

[03:15] So we've seen it before, right?

[03:17] Every time they make these videos, that everything is going fine.

[03:20] For some reason, it just seems really hard to do it as people are actually there screwing

[03:24] games together.

[03:25] And my only conclusion is this, I think they don't want you to see what it's like every

[03:31] day inside these places because I think they don't want you to see that there's not a

[03:35] lot going on, that there's not a lot of people there at any one time.

[03:39] Right?

[03:40] We don't even see many videos from Jersey Jack Pinball these days, right?

[03:43] Where is the videos?

[03:44] Whenever you walk through the doors at Stern Pinball, it's nothing but activity.

[03:49] What about the doors over to American Pinball?

[03:51] What's happening there today?

[03:52] I don't know.

[03:53] Part of me would like to see what is happening on the assembly lines of each company, right?

[03:58] It's not just Haggis.

[03:59] It's everybody because ultimately the greatest sign of a pinball company being healthy, a pinball

[04:04] company being efficient, a pinball company being effective always boils down to the manufacturing

[04:11] line, right?

[04:12] To the assembly line at the factory.

[04:14] And we all know, and history is shown as this.

[04:16] And this is just common sense, right?

[04:17] When I say history repeating itself with Haggis Pinball, that every single day there is

[04:23] not stuff on the line.

[04:25] You are losing money because there's no way to make money, right?

[04:29] No new money is coming in, but every day money is going out to employees, to parts suppliers,

[04:36] to the landlord of the building.

[04:38] So every day you're not getting new orders and taking new money in and nothing is happening

[04:43] on the line, you're losing money.

[04:46] So then how many days can you go before the money runs out?

[04:50] Now the problem with pinball, and this is another part of pinball history, is we've also

[04:55] learned that for some companies, the money may never run out.

[04:59] If you're Jersey Jack Pinball and you're backed by the Abbas family, the money's not going

[05:04] to run out.

[05:05] Even if Jersey Jack Pinball is losing millions of dollars, that's simply a write-off for

[05:10] a family that's got multiple business, making multiple millions of dollars, who have billions

[05:15] of dollars in net worth.

[05:17] So it's not going to run out ever.

[05:19] Stern Pinball will never run out of money because Stern Pinball is efficient.

[05:23] Spooky Pinball will never run out of money because Spooky Pinball has the rent of one dollar

[05:27] in Benton, Wisconsin.

[05:29] It costs Charlie next to nothing to have his pinball manufacturing operation there.

[05:34] And that's great for him.

[05:35] It was a great decision.

[05:36] He's also hurting Spooky Pinball because they can't get any talent to move there.

[05:40] And then you got American Pinball who's clearly being financed, not by the success of their

[05:45] first three titles because their first three titles were not successful.

[05:50] American Pinball is being financed by Ametron, which is the parent company that makes all

[05:55] the money and has all like the big contracts.

[05:58] And I think some of the new people that came over there, maybe it was Rob Burke, maybe

[06:01] it was David Fix.

[06:02] I think they've invested some capital too in the operation.

[06:05] But that money I think, here's the thing, if any company I think isn't jeopardy of

[06:09] saying you know what we're done is probably American Pinball because I think there will

[06:13] come a point where Mukesh will just get tired of losing that money because I don't think

[06:18] he strikes me as the kind of man who goes into a business operation that loses money.

[06:24] He's not in this for the passion of Pinball.

[06:26] He wants to make money.

[06:28] He was sold that this is an industry that can make money and he wasn't misled.

[06:32] You can make a lot of money in Pinball.

[06:34] The problem with Mukesh and Devall and all the guys who started American Pinball is they

[06:38] just made three mediocre games that not many people want it.

[06:42] And the biggest problem was they made October Fest.

[06:45] That really needed to be a hit.

[06:46] And they also have not learned a lesson that you do need license games if you want to sell

[06:52] a lot of titles.

[06:53] And I think they're going to be in for a rude awakening in 2022 when they have another

[06:59] unlicensed game and they're wondering why they can't sell thousands of units because

[07:03] you best believe when the supply chain issues get better and people aren't starving for

[07:08] games, they are going to run to the license games over at Jersey Jack Pinball, over at

[07:14] Stern Pinball and they're going to buy games based on themes that speak to them.

[07:18] And you know this is going to happen.

[07:19] I mean they got very, very lucky with legends of Vahala coming out when there's no inventory

[07:24] anywhere.

[07:25] So let's go back to Haggis Pinball.

[07:27] So Damien puts up another video saying the following that they're making more Celts

[07:31] and then Fathom production is going to start in January.

[07:34] There's a big question mark here for me.

[07:37] Why are you making more Celts when you said Fathom was going to be produced in July?

[07:43] If you have the ability to get parts and to make games, why are you making more Celts?

[07:49] Why aren't you making the game that is the bigger ticket item that more people want?

[07:55] Like why aren't you doing that?

[07:56] And why are you selling more Celts and making more Celts right now?

[08:00] So this is the part where I start to get a little nervous and we've seen this before

[08:04] two of these Pinball companies.

[08:06] You start to take more money on game A after you announced game B.

[08:11] Now are you taking any of that money from game B to make game A?

[08:17] Think about it for a minute.

[08:19] They're telling me that they're taking no money from those Fathom orders to put towards

[08:25] salaries and rent and all the learning and the manufacturing stuff they have to ramp up.

[08:31] None of that money.

[08:32] None of that money from Fathom is going to go towards that.

[08:35] Then where does all that money come from?

[08:38] It didn't come from Celts sales because there aren't that many people who are getting

[08:42] Celts in the United States are getting like numbers 30, 35.

[08:46] They didn't sell hundreds of Celts.

[08:48] So where does that money come from?

[08:49] Is it personally financed by Damien?

[08:52] It's no pre-order money.

[08:53] Who knows?

[08:54] Right?

[08:55] But history has shown us.

[08:56] Again, this is not Haggis.

[08:57] This is me looking at the Pinball historical landscape.

[09:00] Every time we've seen a boutique company do this, it usually leads to something that's

[09:05] not good.

[09:06] It usually leads to more money as being burnt than is coming in the door.

[09:10] Isn't that just the very fundamentals of business?

[09:14] More money needs to come in than goes out.

[09:16] If it doesn't, aren't you upside down on your balance sheet?

[09:20] How do you then recover?

[09:22] How do you make up for that lost ground?

[09:24] See that's the problem.

[09:26] All of these Pinball companies face is I think people run into this with enthusiasm.

[09:30] They say we can do this.

[09:32] And then as they're doing it, they actually realize how hard it is to actually make a

[09:38] pinball machine.

[09:39] They start to realize that Stern Pinball has 50 years of experience.

[09:44] 50 years of experience.

[09:46] Stern makes it look easy.

[09:48] And so I think they go into this and they say, hey, we can do this.

[09:52] We can screw a game together in our garage.

[09:54] We can make 10 Celts.

[09:56] And then we can say we'll take orders for 500.

[09:59] And you know, when you go from 10 to 500, your headaches go from 10 to 500.

[10:04] It's not as easy as it looks.

[10:07] Because once you take a lot of orders and you have to fulfill a lot of orders, the game

[10:13] gets a lot more challenging.

[10:15] Every delay gets amplified 10 times when you have to make a lot more games.

[10:20] I mean, look over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:23] They're not more efficient nowadays than they were back in New Jersey.

[10:27] They sold more guns and roses in one year than I think any game they've ever sold in

[10:32] one year.

[10:33] But it's clearly been very, very hard for them to ramp up production, to get games out

[10:38] the door.

[10:39] How many guns and roses machines do you think they're making a week?

[10:43] Why is that a trade secret?

[10:45] Let me ask you a question.

[10:46] Why would that be a trade secret?

[10:48] How many games a week Jersey Jack Pinball makes?

[10:51] Shouldn't you know that as a customer?

[10:53] I mean, automotive companies tell you how many cars they can make.

[10:57] Video game companies will tell you how many consoles they're going to be able to supply

[11:00] this holiday season.

[11:02] Why is it some sort of manufacturing mystery?

[11:05] And they all keep it a secret, right?

[11:06] It is not official anywhere.

[11:08] Like it's not official at Stern.

[11:09] It's not official at Jersey Jack.

[11:11] And the reason why they keep it a secret is very simple.

[11:14] People know this.

[11:15] It's not because anybody has a true competitive advantage with how many games they're cranking

[11:20] out.

[11:21] The reason they keep it a secret is they don't want you to delay ordering from them because

[11:26] they don't want you to know the truth about how long you're actually going to be waiting

[11:31] for your game.

[11:32] So how long do we think people are going to be waiting for for them?

[11:36] Do we think that's fathom production and a game will ship by the end of January?

[11:41] I'm here to tell you right now that Canada is betting that we will not see fathoms

[11:47] ship by the end of January.

[11:49] If they do ship by the end of January, what will Canada do?

[11:52] I'll do this.

[11:53] If Damien is successful in shipping fathom by the end of January, here's what I will

[11:59] do.

[12:00] I will promise that the only game can a to plays a T. P. F. I will not be allowed to play

[12:06] anything else.

[12:07] The only game I will play at T. P. F. is Celts.

[12:11] I will have to spend three days playing Celts.

[12:15] I think that's a good repercussion for losing a bet.

[12:18] So I will spend three days in a row playing Celts at T. P. F. if he's able to get fathoms,

[12:24] ship to customers by the end of January.

[12:27] So let's see what happens.

[12:28] I would say that by now we've learned a lesson.

[12:32] By now we all would have learned a lesson that you shouldn't preorder anything.

[12:36] That preordering pinball is not the way to go.

[12:39] I think people are learning that lesson once again with Haggis.

[12:42] I think everyone's learning that lesson with spooky pinball because with spooky it's

[12:46] not whether or not you're going to get your game.

[12:49] It's whether or not the game is going to be any good.

[12:51] And every time I go into the spooky thread, I just want to give Luke some advice because

[12:55] I see Luke in there every day.

[12:57] And I mean this Luke when I say it, transparency is good up to a point.

[13:02] And you are now becoming too transparent and you're now saying too much stuff that you

[13:07] shouldn't be saying.

[13:09] He said something in the thread the other day that when I saw it as a marketer and as

[13:13] a professional and as someone who guides multi-billion dollar businesses on their communication

[13:18] strategies, it just made me cringe.

[13:21] He said that we are going to keep testing out animators until we find one that you guys

[13:26] like.

[13:27] I mean it's in there.

[13:28] He said that.

[13:29] Really Luke, you're going to keep testing out stuff until you find something we like.

[13:35] You know what that tells me that you have no idea what the consumer wants.

[13:39] You have no idea what great animations look like.

[13:43] You need to hear feedback from us after you've locked us in with non-refundable pre-order

[13:48] dollars on what's good.

[13:50] Go buy a stern machine and see what good animations look like Luke.

[13:54] Go buy a Jersey Jack machine and go see what good animations look like.

[13:58] I'm not against spooky.

[13:59] I'm just getting annoyed by this overwhelming transparency that is basically them in

[14:04] bidding that they're not really sure what we want after they lock us in into a non-refundable

[14:10] situation.

[14:11] See that's my problem with all of this is once you lock people in with a non-refundable

[14:15] deposit, just get it right then.

[14:17] Don't come back to me with excuses.

[14:19] Don't tell me that these are the best animations.

[14:21] Don't tell me how many clips you have.

[14:23] Get them in the game.

[14:24] How about you don't take any money on a game until you finish it next time.

[14:28] I'm really really upset that spooky did it this way.

[14:31] Sorry, I've just lost patience in how they're doing it.

[14:34] This whole like let's build the ship in the ocean.

[14:37] Let's sell everybody a non-refundable ticket to a cabin on board this ship.

[14:41] Then when they see the ship might be taking on water, well hey guys we're going to like

[14:45] find a ship builder next time and we're going to like make sure that that ship builder

[14:49] meets your expectations next time.

[14:51] I'm so tired of that next time or if this game's going to get better down the road, I think

[14:56] a lot of people are getting fed up with it.

[14:58] Instead of talking every day, Luke you don't have to respond to every single person who

[15:02] has every single issue with your game.

[15:05] You guys are no longer this tiny boutique company.

[15:07] You have 1700 and 50 customers and it's not about daily responses.

[15:12] That's not what matters.

[15:14] Just sometimes it's best to go away and get the job done.

[15:18] Go away and hire good animators.

[15:20] Go away and internally know what people want.

[15:24] You're a company spooky.

[15:26] You're not a focus group.

[15:28] You're not building pinball machines to focus group how to make the next game good.

[15:32] That's what nobody wants and that's what it feels like with these two games.

[15:36] That these two games are a focus group journey.

[15:39] How do we do this now that we've lost a lot of talent that made the previous games?

[15:44] That's how I'm beginning to read into this and I think a lot of people are too.

[15:47] Can I get a pinball man?

[15:48] Are we going to win a fifth twippy?

[15:50] Who knows?

[15:51] Who knows?

[15:52] I mean it's twippy season but I will say man the twippy's we'll talk about in a little

[15:56] bit.

[15:57] So we're going to see a lot of people talk about how quickly we're going to see Rush

[15:59] pinball any day now and I think that's going to give all of us new stuff to talk about

[16:04] so we can move away from spooky pinball.

[16:07] We can move away from haggis.

[16:08] We'll have a new game from Stern.

[16:10] Can you imagine how boring this hobby would be if there were not new games from Stern?

[16:14] I heard Zach many talk about the possibility and he laid out his case for this.

[16:18] The possibility of his Stern vault machine in 2022 and Zach absolutely 1,000 1 million

[16:26] per cent that makes total sense and I think Stern pinball saw that with Elvira.

[16:32] There is such an opportunity for Stern to go back to the well with games people want,

[16:37] make a very limited number of them and in this market charge insane amounts of money for

[16:42] the games and they will sell immediately like absolutely.

[16:45] The only thing I don't agree with Zach on is I don't think they're going to call them

[16:49] vault additions anymore.

[16:50] I think they're going to call them like anniversary additions or super limited additions because

[16:55] vault additions means you're remaking the game.

[16:58] I don't think they're just going to remake them.

[17:00] I think they're going to make them a lot better.

[17:02] I think they're going to add more bells and whistles and shiny armor and I think they're

[17:06] going to be super, super limited.

[17:08] If they're super, super limited call them an SLE, a super limited addition and I think

[17:14] they're going to create an even higher tier of collectible and it's going to be multiple

[17:20] SLEs because they haven't done a good job Stern of branding the top tier.

[17:25] We had SLE Batman.

[17:27] We had signature addition Elvira.

[17:30] We had 40th anniversary Elvira.

[17:32] They're all over the place.

[17:34] I've said it and I've said it for years.

[17:36] Stern should just do a platinum series.

[17:39] That's the top of the top and the platinum series is just like 200 or 250 of every title

[17:45] they make and they would sell everyone and they could charge 20 grand and all these rich

[17:49] guys that are bored out of their mind that need to have Christmas morning happen every

[17:53] other week are going to buy them.

[17:55] I mean, that's who the audience is for these games.

[17:58] It's not for the pinball enthusiasts.

[18:00] It's not for the collector even.

[18:02] It's just for the guy that's got so much money he wants to have the nicest version of

[18:07] something and in pinball, there are more than 200 people out there that want to have the

[18:12] nicest version of every single game.

[18:15] Easy money for Stern.

[18:16] Easy money.

[18:17] All right.

[18:18] So we're going to get Rush pinball.

[18:19] Rush pinball will divide the community.

[18:21] People will love it.

[18:22] People hated it, but I think for the most part, Rush is a snooze fest.

[18:26] If you went down the street and you asked most people, can you name three Marvel characters?

[18:33] They absolutely could go down the street and ask people, can you name three songs by

[18:39] Rush and watch them just fall back and play dead.

[18:44] This is not that much of a mainstream band.

[18:46] It's not and I don't care if like all we need is as many people to overlap with pinball,

[18:51] but still a snooze fest.

[18:53] I don't want titles from a major manufacturer like Stern to be something that only appeals

[18:59] to a niche audience.

[19:01] That's not what Stern should be making.

[19:03] They should be making things that have a much broader and global audience.

[19:08] Remember, Stern is sending these pins all over the world.

[19:11] Rush does not have the mainstream broad global appeal as Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Jurassic

[19:20] Park, Godzilla.

[19:22] These things are all bigger globally than Rush.

[19:25] Like go make a Rush documentary movie and see how empty that theater is.

[19:30] It'll just be Canadians inside there.

[19:32] Alright, well if you think Rush was obscure, what about my rumor that Food Fighters is coming

[19:36] out?

[19:37] I mean, Food Fighters has more mainstream popularity than Rush, but I would argue that

[19:41] Food Fighters is not as good as Rush.

[19:44] And I think actually think Food Fighters is one of the most overrated bands of all time

[19:47] I got to be honest.

[19:48] I went on Spotify, I listened to all their songs and meant like nothing.

[19:53] Like what mood would you be in to be like I want to put on the Food Fighters right now?

[19:57] I mean, come on.

[19:58] This band has like no edginess to it.

[20:00] Like just listen to Nirvana.

[20:02] Alright, so we're going to get Rush, then we're going to get Venom, which is the comic

[20:06] book edition of Venom with Brian Eddie and Zambi Eddie.

[20:09] Can people stop wishing for the M&M song inside the Venom game?

[20:15] It's a game based on the comic book.

[20:18] Stern is going the cheaper route.

[20:20] They're not going to pay to put an M&M song in this game, okay?

[20:24] People get back to reality.

[20:25] Then what's next, right?

[20:27] What is next after Venom?

[20:29] Then we get to that T-P-F time of year.

[20:31] I think at T-P-F, we will most likely see maybe, maybe they will tease out the next game

[20:38] from American Pinball.

[20:40] We should see Cactus Canyon's shipping by January, February, and then the big question

[20:45] becomes this.

[20:46] The number one game everyone really wants to see.

[20:50] I mean, even if you don't like the company, the number one game everyone really wants to

[20:54] see is Toy Story from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[20:58] A Jersey Jack game is needed now.

[21:00] I'm sort of bored of guns and roses being the only thing we can talk about.

[21:05] I'm sort of bored that Jersey Jack once again can't even come close to getting two games

[21:10] out a year.

[21:11] It's not even like close anymore.

[21:14] Like where is it?

[21:15] Like what was the point of moving everything to Chicago?

[21:19] Having all of this extra room, you've got four designers and you can't even get two games

[21:24] out every 18 months.

[21:26] What's going on over there?

[21:27] Like what are those designers doing?

[21:29] They must be the most patient men in America.

[21:32] Now the other rumor I heard is that Steve Richie is going to be after the Pat Lawler title.

[21:37] Then we're going to see Eric Minier's game.

[21:39] Now I'm going to do what I do best and I'm going to put out the rumors of what I hear

[21:43] that Steve Richie and Eric Minier are working on.

[21:45] I'm going to tell you right now, I think Richie might be taking the helm with Avatar or Matrix.

[21:50] Those are the two that I think Richie might be at the helm of.

[21:53] Now I also think those games might have been in development before Steve Richie got there

[21:58] and he might be putting the final touches on them.

[22:01] But I'm not sure, right?

[22:02] Does Jersey Jack strike you as a company that can go back and make a lot of changes?

[22:07] Go back and put final touches on stuff?

[22:09] I don't really see them as a company that can do that.

[22:13] The way Stern does it, right?

[22:15] I think JJP because they're so focused on one game, one designer,

[22:20] and you have to wait like two and a half years to get your game back on the line.

[22:25] I'm not really sure like they've got all these white woods in development.

[22:29] They just don't strike me as that kind of company.

[22:32] But man, I would die to get a toy story.

[22:34] I'm dying to get a toy story so badly I did something unthinkable to so many of you.

[22:40] Because I want a toy story so badly and it's a dream theme for me.

[22:45] And all I want now in my home are dream themes.

[22:48] I sold my Godzilla Ellie.

[22:50] And the reason I sold Godzilla Ellie is not because I don't like Godzilla Ellie.

[22:55] I think it's an amazing game.

[22:56] I think it is going to be game of the year.

[22:58] I think it might end up being the number one ranked game of all time.

[23:01] Can we talk about how heist is number two?

[23:03] Come on, Robin, you can have heist pinball.

[23:06] Be the second greatest pinball machine of all time on the top 100

[23:10] because 26 people who own it voted for it.

[23:13] Get real with that voting metrics.

[23:15] You should not be allowed to be in the top 10 unless at least 200 people have voted for the game.

[23:20] Alright, let's go on.

[23:21] So I sold my Godzilla Ellie for one reason.

[23:25] I will only own pinball machines from now on.

[23:28] That are dream themes and are amazing games.

[23:31] And those two things have to happen.

[23:34] I'm sorry but medieval madness is not a dream theme for me.

[23:36] I don't care how fun it is.

[23:38] I'm sorry but attack from ours is not either.

[23:40] I'm sorry but Monster Bash doesn't move me.

[23:42] Neither does cactus Canyon.

[23:44] I enjoy those games tremendously and I will play those games on location

[23:48] at pinball shows and at friends houses.

[23:51] So I'm sorry but I don't need to own that.

[23:53] I don't love the theme.

[23:55] I want a pinball machine that when I walk by it,

[23:59] the theme moves me emotionally.

[24:00] That is the most important thing to me.

[24:02] After that it has to be good, right?

[24:04] If home pin made a Kira, I probably wouldn't own it.

[24:09] But the first door I need to walk through is is this a dream theme?

[24:13] And so people have been saying to me,

[24:15] well now you're a hypocrite Chris because you sold Godzilla Ellie,

[24:18] but you kept your Ultraman order and here's the other thing.

[24:22] There is now a very high probability that I will not be taking Ultraman.

[24:27] But I'm stuck with it right now.

[24:28] The reason I sold Godzilla right now,

[24:30] guess why I sold it right now?

[24:32] Because the market is hot and I got market value for it.

[24:36] And getting market value for Godzilla right now means the next pinball machine I buy,

[24:42] I will get at a 60% discount most likely, maybe more.

[24:46] So can you blame me?

[24:47] If my dream theme is Toy Story.

[24:49] And Toy Story CE is 12.5.

[24:52] Let's just say it's 12.5, I think it's going to be more.

[24:54] That means by buying Godzilla Ellie and selling it,

[24:58] I will get Toy Story for basically 50% off.

[25:03] 50% off.

[25:04] Not a bad deal, right?

[25:05] I will get a Toy Story CE for a cheaper price than a Stern Pro.

[25:11] This is why those of you out there that think this is such a deplorable thing.

[25:15] I mean, it's not.

[25:16] It actually helps us out when we realize that you can play the market and then cash your chips in

[25:23] when you find a dream theme.

[25:25] What's wrong with that?

[25:25] Like, what is wrong with that?

[25:27] So I sold my Godzilla Ellie number 500 to an amazing buyer,

[25:31] Super Nice Guy in California and he's building his pinball collection and he was super excited to get the machine.

[25:37] He wasn't worried about the price.

[25:40] But this is where I am in pinball.

[25:42] I only will put dream themes in my home.

[25:45] Everything else I will enjoy in other locations and that's just the way I'm going to do it moving forward.

[25:51] And it also frees me up.

[25:52] It's very liberating.

[25:54] I will say this.

[25:55] It is very liberating when you stop chasing every single new game.

[25:59] And I've heard from people who have listened to my show and if there's anything that I'm glad I'm hearing people say,

[26:05] it's like Chris, after listening to your show,

[26:07] I realize I've been in this cycle of contempt.

[26:10] I've been chasing after every single new game just because it's new.

[26:16] And when you stop and think about it,

[26:17] well, do I really want this game?

[26:20] Like, do I want an Avengers comic book edition?

[26:23] Am I a fan of Deadpool?

[26:25] Do I like Iron Maiden music?

[26:27] And even though the game might be great and that, see, the thing is this, for many of you out there,

[26:31] that might be all that you need, right?

[26:33] You might just love the gameplay and the code and the callouts and the experience.

[26:36] And that's great that that's just not enough for me.

[26:39] That's just not enough for me.

[26:41] I need it to be a dream theme as well.

[26:43] I'm just going to be more selective because I have more expenses in my life.

[26:48] There's less I want in my life.

[26:49] Is this a weird thing?

[26:51] I know this goes against everything American marketers like myself are trying to convince you.

[26:57] But in life, you will be happier when you have less.

[27:01] It's a weird concept.

[27:03] But when you have less stuff, less stuff to look after, less stuff to worry about,

[27:08] less stuff to lift the glass on, you will be happier.

[27:13] And I picture my future with Killian and Brenda and the world we're going to live in.

[27:18] The world we're going to create for ourselves, the environment we're going to create for ourselves.

[27:23] It is not going to be some big house loaded with stuff.

[27:27] It's not going to be that.

[27:29] I am such a fan of more minimalism and zen and just having less clutter.

[27:36] I don't want to walk into a room and have like 30 pinball machines.

[27:39] I don't care how big the room is.

[27:41] I don't want to house that big.

[27:43] I don't want to be paying for that much space if I don't need that many rooms.

[27:46] I know that's the American thing.

[27:49] It's all about having so much more than you need.

[27:51] And when you have a kid, you realize just give me what I really need and let go of everything

[27:57] I don't really need.

[27:58] And the things I really need, I need experiences, I need time more than anything in my life.

[28:04] If you were to ask me right now, I'm 45 years old and I'm staring at this beautiful baby

[28:08] every day and he's crawling all over the place and I'm staring at my beautiful wife who's

[28:12] working so hard to keep it all together and she's working way harder than I am to keep

[28:18] everything together and I'm saying to myself, what do I need right now?

[28:23] What's going to make me happy in my life right now?

[28:25] The last thing on that list is another pinball machine or a pinball machine in storage

[28:31] that I'll unbox years from now.

[28:33] That's not what I need.

[28:35] Do I need more clothes?

[28:36] No.

[28:37] Do I need another car?

[28:38] No.

[28:39] Do I need a bigger house?

[28:40] Yes, I do need that.

[28:41] But what I really need more than anything in my life is I need time.

[28:47] That is all I want this holiday.

[28:49] That is all I want for Christmas is time.

[28:52] I just want time back to have to spend with the people I love.

[28:58] That's it.

[28:59] I can't get time if I buy another pinball machine and the more toys we put into our homes and

[29:04] the more things we acquire, they take our time.

[29:08] For some of us out there like, yes, absolutely like your kids are grown, you've done your job.

[29:13] I'm at the beginning of parenthood.

[29:14] I'm just starting the parenthood journey in which you have no time.

[29:17] I know this and I know for many of you you've been down this road.

[29:21] You've made those sacrifices.

[29:23] You've educated your kids.

[29:25] They're off to college or they're grown up enough where then you can fill your house with

[29:30] toys and pinball machines and spend the second half of your life just playing and I can't

[29:35] wait to get there but I'm not there.

[29:38] That's why I don't begrudge anyone who has big collections and all these things because

[29:42] you might now have the time and the money, right?

[29:45] You need time and money in this hobby.

[29:47] You might now have the time and the money to enjoy your life and fill it with anything

[29:52] you want.

[29:53] You can put in any room of your house, anything you want because you worked hard to get

[29:57] there and that is amazing and I don't begrudge that.

[30:00] I never will but for me that's not where I'm at.

[30:04] Another reason why I did sell Godzilla was the free up the capital a little bit.

[30:08] I mean it's the holidays.

[30:09] I don't get holiday bonuses.

[30:11] I've got people coming into town, family coming into town and I want to have experiences.

[30:16] I want to have dinners.

[30:17] I want to go out.

[30:18] I want to spoil Brenda's sisters.

[30:20] I want to do stuff for family because I know the sacrifices they're making to get here

[30:25] and that means more to me and I mean this when I say this, I would rather take the money

[30:29] I made on Godzilla profit and instead of rolling it over into toy story, just take that

[30:35] money that I made because I was in the right place at the right time on a pinball purchase

[30:40] and then spend that on paying for the hotel rooms for Brenda's sisters, their airline flights

[30:47] and all the restaurants because they're bringing family together during the holiday and that

[30:51] means more to me than Godzilla wizard mode and having a Godzilla pinball machine in which

[30:57] there's so many of them.

[30:58] There's going to be thousands of them.

[30:59] You're going to be able to play them everywhere.

[31:01] Come this time next year, no one's going to care about Godzilla.

[31:04] That's the dirty little truth.

[31:05] Nobody wants to admit is that a year later, everything's going to fall out of fashion in

[31:09] pinball.

[31:10] It's just what happens because there's so many new games.

[31:13] It doesn't mean Godzilla won't still be a great game.

[31:15] It's just you won't care as much.

[31:17] You'll be on to the next, on to the next.

[31:19] I mean, if you think any game right now, you know, the only game that will ultimately

[31:23] have long lasting appeal for you will be dream themes or a game that plays like a dream.

[31:29] And for some of you, it's one or the other.

[31:31] For me, it needs to be both.

[31:32] Okay, everybody?

[31:33] Have a great December.

[31:35] Try to not work.

[31:36] Try to take time off and again spend that time with the family.

[31:39] And spend it being anti-social playing pinball later.
