[00:00] I'll have to leave now now.

[00:05] Well, don't go alone.

[00:08] Well, I don't leave now now.

[00:12] I don't leave now.

[00:15] Just...

[00:22] Good Friday morning and welcome to episode 191

[00:26] of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:29] I know it's been a while.

[00:30] We haven't spoken as frequently on this podcast.

[00:34] It's because work has been crazy.

[00:36] The holidays have been crazy.

[00:38] And there just hasn't been that much pinball news.

[00:41] But we're back.

[00:42] We're not dead.

[00:43] We're still doing this.

[00:44] This is going to be a fun episode.

[00:46] I talked to Ted last night about our 2018 prediction.

[00:50] So I'm going to air that interview soon.

[00:52] But first, I want to talk about user mail at the beginning of this podcast.

[00:57] Because I want to read what you guys write to me.

[00:59] So first, we're going to start off with Joshua Kushner, who wrote to me.

[01:03] And by the way, thank you, Joshua, for listening to the podcast.

[01:06] He wrote, hey there.

[01:08] I just discovered your podcast and I absolutely love it.

[01:11] I went to spooky a few weeks ago and picked me up.

[01:15] Total nuclear annihilation.

[01:17] I'm an operator.

[01:18] So I put it on route and had a launch party to celebrate.

[01:21] The reception was great.

[01:23] I love the game so much.

[01:24] I bought another Terout as well.

[01:26] In my honest opinion, Tina is all about fast paced multiplayer games that are tons of fun.

[01:33] The light show is the best I've seen in Pimbal.

[01:36] Plus as an operator, with all parts being off the shelf I can rely on Pimbal Life to be there for a while.

[01:44] Even if spooky fails.

[01:46] Side note.

[01:47] I think you're a sterico in a good way.

[01:49] It's like you read my mind sometimes.

[01:51] Keep up the great work, Josh.

[01:52] Well, Josh, thank you for the note.

[01:54] I concur that I think Total Nuclear annihilation has sort of filled the void in Pimbal.

[02:01] That void is games that are fast and fun.

[02:05] Games where even if you're a good player and you get on Total Nuclear annihilation,

[02:09] you're not going to be on there for half hour ball time.

[02:12] I think certain games in a home use environment are fun for guys like me that suck at Pimbal

[02:18] that want longer ball times because I can play more Pimbal.

[02:21] But when I go out and I play Pimbal at bars and league nights,

[02:26] there is nothing more boring than watching people spend a half hour on a single ball.

[02:30] So I think TNA is reminding people that Pimbal can be fast and fun and doesn't need upper, lower playfield ramps, left and right.

[02:39] It can just be a fun fast game.

[02:41] So Josh, well thank you for the note and I'm glad you're enjoying your TNA.

[02:44] All right, I got an email from...

[02:48] Let's see.

[02:50] I got one from Gabriel, the Nunsale Gabe.

[02:53] Thanks for writing it.

[02:55] Now Gabe is the organizer of Fantastic Up in the New England area.

[03:01] And he just wanted me to ask you guys out there to remember that there are Ellie ticket packages go on sale starting January 1st.

[03:09] So there's still available.

[03:11] There's a hundred of those available and numbered.

[03:13] So if you guys are looking to go to Fantastic, check out the website is FantasticNewEngland.com.

[03:21] BackslashPasses if you're interested.

[03:25] I love that there's now Ellie Passes.

[03:27] Gonna be super Ellie, collector's edition passes to these shows.

[03:31] But for you guys up in New England, it's always a great show to check out.

[03:35] Let's see. I got an email from Ben Crane.

[03:38] Ben, thank you for listening to the show.

[03:40] Ben said, Chris, listen to your latest show.

[03:43] Your first piece of advice was to never buy a pin you haven't played.

[03:47] This advice seems to be also frequently posted on Pinside as if it is self-evident.

[03:54] But frankly, I don't agree with it.

[03:56] If people want to play before they buy, I don't have a problem with that.

[04:01] I also don't understand why it seems to bother some people that others buy games without playing them.

[04:08] I also find it especially strange to hear it from you since you bought Magic Girl without playing as well as pre-ordered several others you haven't played.

[04:19] I have bought 19 games during my life.

[04:22] Of those I bought three Stern Star Trek Game of Thrones Guardians of the Galaxy without ever playing before.

[04:29] Technically, I find there is nothing more exciting than to explore a new game I haven't played before and see the code develop.

[04:37] I have yet to regret any of these purchases.

[04:40] I have bought some games I played before.

[04:43] I bought it shows or on location that quickly grew tiresome in a home environment.

[04:47] So for me at least playing a game a few dozen times doesn't mean it will offer long-term satisfaction.

[04:53] Ben, I hear what you're saying loud and clear.

[04:56] And you're right, there is often people like myself screaming from the rooftops don't buy a game before you play it.

[05:03] And look, this isn't in an exact science.

[05:06] No one's right. Like I'm not right, you're not right.

[05:09] People who moaning grown on Pinside are not right. It doesn't matter.

[05:13] If you buy a pin and you haven't played it and it arrives and you love it, awesome.

[05:18] But here's the thing, if you buy a pin and this happens more than what you describe.

[05:23] More people than often buy a pin without playing it, it arrives and they're disappointed in the state of the code,

[05:32] the lack of playability of the game and that frustrates them.

[05:36] Okay, and if they had played it first then they wouldn't have gone in and been frustrated by it.

[05:42] So look, and also when I bought Magic Girl, there's these certain games you have to go in and get it before it comes out because they won't be available.

[05:51] I bought Magic Girl because there were only 21 in the world and if I didn't grab a spot and the game worked,

[05:58] nobody would have put theirs up for sale for anywhere near the price that I paid for it.

[06:03] So I felt like I needed to go in early and what happened, right?

[06:07] Game comes out, doesn't work. Got burned. I got burned.

[06:11] So I'm simply giving the advice based upon my experiences that every time you go in early, you could get burned.

[06:18] And so I have not bought a game without playing it though. So that's the other part, Ben.

[06:23] Yes, I am in on Pirates of the Caribbean. I was in on dialed in and what happened, I played dialed in, I played it a bunch, I thought it was a good game and then I didn't want to own it.

[06:31] So I didn't buy it.

[06:33] But for people who like buy a game and they've never played it, I just think that's a silly proposition because it's easy to play something before you know you want to own it.

[06:45] Now the flip side in what you said this Ben, you could play a game at a bar and love it for an hour and order it and then it comes to your house and you get bored of it quickly.

[06:56] See, there's no way to prevent that either. So you just don't know that's why ultimately I think buy a game based on a theme you love and you'll want it in your house for a long time.

[07:05] Ben, thank you for writing in. I do appreciate it. I am a hypocrite at times for sure. I mean, I crapped all over Batman 66 and now I have one.

[07:15] Maybe I'm a hypocrite, but I'm a happy hypocrite.

[07:18] Okay, I got an email from Brad's arcade Brad. Thank you for listening to the show. This is from Bradley Hunter.

[07:26] Hey, Chris, your comment about not receiving free stuff from your fans is not true. I sent a large envelope full of supplement samples for you to try that should be at your work waiting for you when you get back from the holiday.

[07:40] Well, thank you, Brad. I appreciate that. I forget what Brad sent me, but when I get it, I'll remember it came from you, Brad, but I can't wait to test that stuff out.

[07:52] I got an email. Let's see, there's just a few more than we're going to air Ted. I got an email from Thomas, Shory Thomas. I hope I pronounce your name right. Thank you for listening to this pinball podcast. He said, I've enjoyed listening to your podcast and I've been a regular for the last year.

[08:09] I really like that you keep us up to date on the current issues, rumors releases, high pitfalls and other things going on in the pinball world.

[08:16] I really enjoy the interview, so please keep them coming. I don't always agree with everything you say and usually chalk it up to one person's opinion versus another, but I feel I have to voice a strong disagreement on your last podcast.

[08:30] I thought your criticism of spooky pinball was a little harsh. Yes, I know you ended your spooky review with a positive. I still give them an A. But when you said they have not made a game that is up to the standard of a stern pro.

[08:44] I think you are dead wrong. I'll use America's most haunted as my example. Since I own one and know more about it, let's look at what it gives you.

[08:52] He lists out everything that's in America's most haunted. So two ramps, one ramp that you have to jump across, a working elevator, a working door, Mac, three target drop banks, six ghost modes, fast game with flow, unique play field layout, great call out, solid play field, back glass, no translate, RGB LED strips,

[09:13] original music. All right, interactive goes. I get that some people don't like the theme and the humor is not for everyone. But I love the Zucker Brothers, Mel Brooks, National and Poon style humor.

[09:26] He also goes on to say, I put it at either a premium or somewhere between premium and pro in terms of gameplay code and what it gives you.

[09:36] I think you really take a look at if you take a look at Rob Zombie, you'll see the same. I admit Rob Zombie does nothing for me with the theme. But when I look at some of the gameplay streams, I really want to play the game because it is so unique.

[09:49] At least Charlie, Ben and Scott are giving us original designs. So give them a break. Spooky's greatest weakness is that because of their low runs, most people haven't played their games because they aren't out there. Same problem, JJP.

[10:03] I only consider, by the way, I only consider America's most haunted Rob Zombie and Teen A to be spooky games, not Domino's and Jetsons. Okay, this is from Tom.

[10:13] All right, Tom, here's my take. I appreciate this. I appreciate someone sticking up for what they believe in someone sticking up for spooky pinball and saying that I'm wrong. That I that that when I crap on spooky for not being at the quality or the same levels of storm pro.

[10:31] I appreciate that. Here's here's why I still think that spooky games are not as good as Stern Pro because if you look at them, if you look at like America's most haunted for example, I mean, I just it just feels like a level below a storm pro and just feels more home brew.

[10:52] When you have like 3D printed ghost in your game, it feels home brew. When you look at Rob Zombie, the toys and the sculpts in that game, I know they weren't done by spooky, but the stuff just feels more like a home brew project and not not at the same level of like a stern pinball when it comes to like the sculpts in the game and the artwork and the code and the level of depth in these games.

[11:21] Now look, it doesn't matter. I think a lot of people feel the same way and I'll tell you why because there are constantly Rob zombies up for sale like why is that why are people when there's only 300 why aren't people holding on to these games and I've said it before. I mean, spooky's number one issue is that Charlie needs a better designer to get these games to the level that I think can compete with where Stern has it has its games in terms of design.

[11:49] And in terms of artwork and whatnot, again, like I think spooky, it's just not there yet. Like the spooky games don't look as good and they don't feel as good as stern pinball pros.

[12:02] And look, we may we may agree to disagree on this, but that's my opinion. And I think America's most honoured and Rob Zombie were good first couple of attempts, but Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is the game that to your point needs to be as good as possible.

[12:18] And it needs to be as good as a stern premium if spooky is to really put themselves on a map as a company that can make high quality pinball machines that can compete in the marketplace because there's a lot of games out there and it's not going to get easy with the competition. It's only going to get harder.

[12:36] Alright, let's go on. There's a couple more I think. So that, let's see.

[12:43] Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

[12:45] Alright, so like I got an email from Gabriel, Gabriel M. Gabriel, thank you for listening to the show. He says,

[12:53] Oh, that he's on clav and pinside and Aussie arcade. He says, I have to argue with your stance on the Chicago coin remakes. It's bullshit.

[13:01] The remakes have in my honest opinion, substandard SMD tech, nothing to work on. The idea that a new playfield makes the game more desirable. It's just insanity.

[13:13] People who buy these remakes are rich collectors who have no idea how to repair, which sure I can understand, but that's why shit like Stern's spike still rolls out.

[13:24] Companies do not have to use SMD tech. They choose to and charge more. What the fuck?

[13:32] Regardless of what you're saying on the show Williams playfields with the diamond plate clear way better than the crap Stern is using today.

[13:39] The new clause they put in about ghosting inserts, they are not cheering the wood correctly. Moisture is affecting the plastic and clear as the wood continues to dry.

[13:49] Same issue in Spanish classical guitar making and general.

[13:54] Alright, I don't know, Spanish guitar. What are we talking about now? Okay, he goes on to say, people need to say no to 10k plus machines.

[14:01] That is pricing machines out of players hands. I still have her nothing on JJP, Willy Wonka from you, WTF.

[14:11] And I thought it was funny that you would say the F word and another episode you said, fuck.

[14:18] Keep casting, Pinside and Clob, suck. Keep it skeezy. Well Gabriel, thank you.

[14:24] Yes, I will curse every now and then. Some days I feel like doing it more than others typically when I have a few whiskey in me.

[14:31] I hear what you're saying. I hear what you're saying about the quality of machines going down and the price of machines going up.

[14:39] And that companies nowadays are using cheaper options to put into these machines and charging more money.

[14:46] Obviously I think Stern is the biggest culprit of that and they're getting away with it.

[14:51] I think they will continue to get away with it because Stern clearly has the best themes and actually has a cadence of rollout that appeases the addiction of the collector.

[15:03] I think you are right that there is a gap between the player and the collector. But this is a collector's hobby.

[15:11] I don't think guys who play in tournaments and are league night guys that don't have the money to buy these new unboxed machines even care.

[15:20] Why do they care about the quality? I think those guys actually have the most fun in Pimball because if you're a player and you go out and play Pimball and beat on machines and bars or different places or go over to people's homes and play their machines and then you get to go home and not have to worry about the long term reliability.

[15:40] And then you get to go home and play some of the most fun in the game and then you get to go home and play some of the most fun in the game.

[15:47] And I think Pimball was never meant to be this device that people owned and became OCD and Aino about every little thing going on in the machine.

[15:57] They were simply meant to go on location, be played for like six months to year and then been thrown away.

[16:03] And we now have tried to flip what these games are all about and make them things that last forever. A steel ball bouncing around, plastic and wood and circuit boards and switches and soldered components.

[16:18] It's going to fail and it's going to have problems. But I hear what you're saying. I do think that the 10k pricing for machines that have taken stuff out is kind of BS.

[16:29] But again, I think the rich collectors, these guys, they don't care. So they're going to keep buying. All right. I also got.

[16:36] Let's see. I think we're good. I think we're good. A couple news items and we'll go on. So the rumor is that yellow submarine beetles is going to be the Kepau title that's turned releases.

[16:47] Lot of back and forth on Pinside about this. I'm not the biggest beetles fan, but I could see this working as a pinball machine. Yellow submarine is sort of like when you've ever gone to the circus, like the beetles version in Vegas.

[17:00] It's very much like that with those songs and the very colorful sort of psychedelic world that is the beetles yellow submarine.

[17:08] I mean, you know, I think it'll it'll be a huge huge sort of title if it comes out. And I think the art package and the if Stern makes an SLE with like metallic decals and the music is great.

[17:24] And I don't know. You know, is will it be a re-themed or not? I don't know. I it's not really on my radar. I think if we see it, we're going to see it at expo. So we've got ways to go.

[17:35] All right. Trying to think if there's any other news I'm missing in pinball, who Dini has shipped is great. We talk a little bit about it in our predictions. I make a little bit, you know, make a little jab at them for shipping one, but we're the other four or five.

[17:47] But they're out there now. I saw games two and three are on location. And that's good. I want to congratulate American pinball on getting who Dini out in 2017 like they said they would. I know I joke about some of these companies, but at the end of the day.

[18:01] Any company that actually ships a game and puts a game in a box and gets people the game they paid for that company is okay in my book. It doesn't mean that their games are great, but I'm glad that they did what every business should do, which is delivered to a customer. The thing they promised.

[18:19] And the other companies out there that continue to struggle to do that need to go away and pinball would be better off for it.

[18:25] You know, as we think about New Year's resolutions, here's one for all of you. And here's what I realized the last week. I spent so much time off of pinside last week that I just didn't really care to even do a podcast and explain what happens.

[18:39] When you remove yourself from the place where people are going crazy all day long on a form talking about pinball all day long debating pinball all day long. It sucks you in.

[18:50] Life is so much better and so much more enjoyable when you turn off the computer when you put down the screen. And when you stop fighting with people on a daily basis about something as silly as pinball.

[19:02] There's not that much news. I highly recommend everybody go to this week in pinball. It's the best resource for pinball news. I did laugh what Jeff did with like the you know I'm going to tell you the two new titles and I'm going to go down a list.

[19:17] And then he has that long list of all the potential new titles coming out there are titles coming out that I know are coming out for a fact that aren't even on Jeff's list. But Jeff.

[19:27] I love this guy. This guy is like the new like Perry Mason detective. He's going to get all the info for all of us to read. I actually think if you just don't go on pinside and you go to this week in pinball and catch up on all the weekly pinball news and you listen to some of your favorite podcasts.

[19:44] Hopefully I'm one of them. I think you'll be much happier. I think pinside really is just a garbage pale lately of like nonsense over and over and over again. The only good threads on pinside. And this is why I like pinside though. This is not all bad.

[19:58] The only good threads are the owner threads where people actually talk about games they talk about issues they help each other out. That's the good stuff if you're going to go on pinside stick to the stuff that actually adds value right the other stuff is all garbage day right.

[20:13] Let me air this interview with Ted where we talk about our predictions for 2018. I know you're going to enjoy it. I had a few whiskies in me. I got to warn you some of my opinions are simply that I do I do get a little harsh at times.

[20:28] But and Ted is a good comic relief for for that sort of strident can aided that you're about to hear so enjoy everyone happy weekend and we'll talk to you again shortly.

[20:39] All right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to can a his pinball podcast probably the greatest predictor of future pinball happenings in the entire industry.

[20:51] We Mr. Ted Ted welcome back to the show. How you doing all right Ted it's real simple what we're going to do tonight. I've left my podcast listeners waiting for a week for this show so you better deliver we're going to predict what we think is going to happen in 2018 in the pinball hobby. How does that sound.

[21:15] Well that sounds great I mean I have a number of predictions I think I think we know what's going on because you have these great connections and they probably told you all the stuff.

[21:26] Yeah I know everything is actually going to happen and we're going to hear from you on what you think is going to happen but here's how we're going to do it for you listener of the show.

[21:34] We're going to go down the list of manufacturers and we're going to predict how we think their year is going to go in 2018 how does that sound and I will guide you that sounds fantastic but I'll tell you let's do something first let's talk about the new star wars movie.

[21:50] It sucked wait wait a minute wait a minute it didn't totally suck okay part did you like the first time is unfortunately we had our company Christmas party and I went there and about four guys finished off a few balls of tequila then we went to the late show right of course I was in a semi coma and I don't remember much I remember about 20 minutes of the show someone said how do you think when you think about that see with Yoda in there I go Yoda was it it so I didn't even know.

[22:19] So I had to wait for another like week and a half and I went back to see it again this time I remembered what happened.

[22:29] You know I don't think like something says I don't think it was terrible I mean they're nitpicking every little thing it's the Star Wars universe you have to really suspend belief in certain areas you know they're getting into these real nitpicky things where they drop in bombs and they're how the air wasn't right and they're not.

[22:48] They can't fall in the gravity well you maybe there's an oxygen thing there and the and the things have guides on them I mean that there's all kinds of ways to explain stuff of course there was a bunch of stuff there that just totally sucked but hey I didn't think it was as awful as some of the people were saying so you just probably cap out of two billion so I think there was that was a beautiful explanation of how bombs fall in the vacuum in a space which they don't I don't really want to talk about it.

[23:17] I really want to talk about Star Wars because I think I'll tell you why because this movie was supposed to be Luke Skywalker trilogy and they fucking drop the ball on the story and here's the thing they don't even have the next story written like there's no trilogy that has been written they are making it up as they go along which is the same thing JJ Abrams did with the TV show lost and for those of you who watch lost.

[23:46] 26 episodes per season of bullshit that now that sucked lost that's what that's what this is anyway let's get to pinball because people won't listen to Ted talking about a tequila fueled first encounter with Star Wars.

[24:07] Oh believe me people want to hear more about that than they do about the stupid pinball stuff. I agree I agree I'm getting over a pinball in general.

[24:15] Which one do I want to talk about first. Alright so here's how we're going to do it. I'm going to list a manufacturer we're going to talk about what they have going on in 2018 and let's give our predictions.

[24:26] Alright number one this is how we talk first for a minute. What's up?

[24:30] So we talk about you first for a minute. Sure go on. So you you you sold magic girl. Yes correct. Yep and you got Batman Batman super Ellie and how do you like it?

[24:43] I love it until it broke pretty immediately. It broke and it broke.

[24:50] The node board number eight stopped working. Oh that man or the dead node board it stopped working but here's a thing I swapped in a new node board it works fine. I love Batman.

[25:02] I think Batman's going to go down as one of Stern's best pinball machines ever. Where you know board. What's up? Where'd you get the new node board?

[25:10] So I had a contact my distributor. He sent me a node board from a working machine he had and I'm mailing him back the broken one. Oh did you buy this new?

[25:23] New inbox. Oh okay because I thought you were supposed to sell those super shawantified. You're not I bought it from coin taker. He had one new inbox never opened. Oh cool.

[25:35] Yeah and it's working. It's beautiful. I love it. I mean the game's great. I play it. Did you get the little projecting the bat signal for the thing? I got everything. I got everything. I got every mod you can think of. I got the good one. What's up?

[25:46] I suppose he sucks. They have another one that's supposedly really good. Yeah I know was it doc quest has the one that's even better. Like honestly like I like you don't even notice it to begin with. Like these guys who are like oh my projector doesn't have any scratchiness.

[26:02] Cool. Like it's like saying the the underside of my nuts sack is is beautiful. Like no one's even looking there to begin with. Well there are a few people looking well we won't go into that. Anyway so okay so what's next?

[26:15] Okay here we here's what we're going to 2018. I want your prediction Ted and what you think is going to happen with this company. Number one American pinball Houdini go.

[26:27] I have high hopes for this company for a number of reasons. Number one what's the owner's name again that we met in downtown. What?

[26:39] Double. Yeah him. Very very nice guy. He's on the inside. He talks to people. Anybody has a question. He answers it. If they say this sucks or whatever it is come back in town to go fuck themselves. He says look you know we're trying to do the best.

[26:56] We can yeah that's a great idea. I mean that he's really listening to everything and trying to make this pinball the best it can be. I mean we saw the thing at all in town. It looks it looks fantastic and they said it's getting better and better.

[27:09] I think that the only thing that can that can take a few of the sales away from Houdini is if Stern or Kishwant so whatever the hell in the name it is.

[27:21] You know says they're going to be doing the Beatles or Joes or something like that but otherwise this this Houdini thing really looks good. I mean I'm looking forward to Elvira but I think that's not going to be in 2018. I was hoping it would be but.

[27:35] Why do you think that? Did I just tell you that wasn't going to happen in 2018 before we started recording. Is that what what you're doing? 2019.

[27:44] Well we'll talk about a viral later but okay so you think American pinballs Houdini is going to be successful because double answered people's questions that shows.

[27:54] No because he's he's he's completely being transparent with this thing we're following the game. So that equal success to you.

[28:02] No people are playing it and saying they love it. Okay. So I think fantastic. I think it's going to be I think it's going to be a humongous hit for them. Okay.

[28:10] When you say humongous hit I want to ask you a question. How many units sold do you think they will achieve?

[28:20] I think they could do over a thousand and that's a humongous hit. I in nowadays and what's a humongous hit. Nobody does 20,000 like you.

[28:31] Here's here's my prediction because I appreciate I appreciate that prediction. I don't need I don't think they can even make a thousand if they wanted to in a year.

[28:44] So let's let's talk about production of Houdini. There are new company to make a thousand pinball machines a year is how many a month.

[28:57] 70 80 right like 85 a month right. Okay. Roughly 20 something a week. I just don't even know if they can make that many.

[29:09] So my prediction is this. I think Houdini is going to be a pinball machine that people want to buy. I think people are not going to want to wait a year to get it.

[29:21] I think they have like a four to five month window to get the machines out the door before people's desired to own a new machine moves on to a new title. Here's my concern.

[29:35] I said if those big titles are announced that that could take some way for the people that can't afford to buy every machine.

[29:42] I don't think they can. But a lot of people can't get one to machines a year. Right. I kind of laughed when American pinball was like we've made Houdini number one is shipped.

[29:53] Did you see that I'm inside that they shipped game number one before the end of the year and they're like here it is in a box.

[30:01] It's going out. We lived up to our promise and the reason why I laughed was this. If you have an assembly line that's supposed to make many games a day.

[30:12] Why did only one game go out? Well obviously they're just doing that because they they have at least a dozen games or something in various stages ready to go out the door.

[30:24] But they want to be able to say that they got a machine out by the end of the wrong with that. So they got it. It was a PR move in them out. It's okay. Okay. I agree. I agree. I would do the same thing maybe maybe not do it. You know, I mean they said they do it. They did it. Okay. Yes. It is a little thing. You're fine. But they did it. And so now they'll move on and you know the bulk of their stuff will be delivered in 28. Are you in on? Are you interested in Houdini?

[30:51] Yes, I am. I am actually interested in Houdini. I want to play it. I hope it's it. You know, Alan. You played it. Yes, but that that was right. That was like a prototype type thing. That wasn't the final. You're going to play it. You're going to play it again to make sure you.

[31:06] Well, let's put this way. If Elvira is not coming out until 2019. The end. The Houdini is definitely on the radar for something, you know, for something to get. I also want to play Guardians of the Galaxy.

[31:21] Let's look. Ted keeps spoiling the beans. I'm just going to say it for all you out there. Elvira is not coming out in 2018. They were never supposed to announce that game during that was that expo panel session with Cassandra. That was a fuck out. They weren't going to announce it. They weren't supposed to announce it. The person who announced it was Elvira's agent teed up the question.

[31:50] And then what was it like Greg Ferris like confirmed it. He wasn't supposed to confirm it. People it is a fuck up on the on a huge marketing level for Stern because now people are holding on to their money in 2018 waiting for Elvira. I'm here to tell you.

[32:08] Why would she be there on the panel for this thing? If you could argue why does anyone do any pinball panel but it wasn't there to announce the new game. The fact that they did was a fuck up. And for any of you waiting to spend your money on Elvira in 2018, it's not happening. So let's go on. So the next company Ted let's go on because we got a lot. Chicago gaming is coming out with what do you think 2018 holds for them.

[32:37] So the rumor is that monster bash is coming out at TPS. That's the rumor. So so I would possibly be in for a monster bash. You know what's going to say if they're going to do big bang bar, I would take that. But if monster bash, I'd wait, of course, until if you were out, then I'd probably check it out of coin taker and maybe get one because monster bash is on my short list of something I'd like to get.

[32:59] Okay, so it's going to be monster bash. It's not going to be big bang bar. They said they won't remake big bang bar. Now when you heard that Ted and you saw the titles, they're going to remake big bang bar, theater of magic monster bash cactus canyon.

[33:16] As a possible consumer, are you like, are you weighing which one you'd rather have or like, how would you approach that?

[33:26] I'd rather have big bang bar over any of them. Okay, why is that?

[33:30] Because I've played big bang bar twice and I love the game. It's I'm a science fiction person. I like that stuff. It's right in my, I just love the game. I thought it was a fun game.

[33:41] I like monster bash too, but again, you can probably get both because I'm sure they're not going to come out one year. So if monster bash is first, that would definitely be as long as it's a stable machine. I would be interested in doing that.

[33:55] Okay, so if monster bash comes out, you might get one and maybe sell it and get big bang bar when that happens.

[34:01] No, I probably keep monster bash. I want to keep just so more I can't fit a lot of machines. I mean, my limit right now is probably six or seven machines is is about it.

[34:12] Okay, how many do you how many do you have right now?

[34:14] Four. Four. So what do you got right now? I'm not telling you. Oh, Jesus, Ted. Don't make me drive over there. I kicked the door. I don't think that like, don't you have like a scared stiff again?

[34:27] And so fucking like roadshow bullshit. Oh, what's going on? It was horrible as I had to wonder. I keep trying to upgrade the scared stiff side yet. And of course, you know, the one I sold my last one, which was, which was a great one.

[34:42] I had every mod you can imagine there because a friend of mine in another state said he had one that he bought brand new in a box at the time and hardly ever played it.

[34:54] He had it in his house and he would sell it to me. Right.

[34:57] I'll in it like six months. So I sold my team. I'm ready to go all of a sudden. I call him up and he says, Oh, I didn't I said I would think about selling it.

[35:06] And so I was just so pissed off that the deal didn't come through. So of course I was on the hunt for another machine and a lot of people were looking for me, you know, for a machine.

[35:14] And I finally found one out in in Maryland. So I had to make that trip out there to get this machine. And so far, if this has been it's been good. So I've been just working on getting the mods back in it now.

[35:26] So all right. So you have it. So you confirm one of your four games. All right. Okay. So here's my prediction for Chicago gaming. I think monster bash when revealed at Texas Pimbal Festival.

[35:37] Yeah. Is going to be a juggernaut hit. I think with the new screen, new playfield, new topper. I think this game is going to sell out faster than attack from Mars remake.

[35:51] I think there's way more in monster bash that makes it more interesting than attack from Mars. I think this game is going to be a ginormous hit.

[36:00] So if you want a monster bash, like I would get in on one early. Okay. I agree. I agree with that. I think I think monster bash is a game that I'm going to attack from Mars. Again, it's a cool game, but it's relatively simple.

[36:14] And you know, I found just from friends of mine that had it when I go over to play it. I get bored with it pretty fast for a monster bash. You know, because it has all the monsters on and everything was, you know, it's pretty cool.

[36:25] Look, look, Dracula Frankenstein wolf, you know, wolf man, like that just quarter entities, then, Martians. All right. Let's go on to the next company.

[36:36] Circus Maximus Ted. So circus Maximus is the company. And we're doing this in apolitical order. They're supposed to be remaking python, angelo's, pinball circus.

[36:48] And the rumor is they are remaking kingpin. What do you think happens with this company in 2018? You know, really, I don't think anyone has enough information. I spoke to the guys when they brought pinball circus to

[37:03] Alan town and I played it. I think it was really a cool game. I mean, it was it was a lot of fun. It was totally different. You know, having those levels. It was just it was just a lot of fun.

[37:15] Easy to store because it goes upright as opposed to, you know, long. So it was it was really neat. I've never played kingpin. I've seen pictures of it. So I really don't know anything about it, even to have a conversation about it.

[37:28] But pinball circus. I hope they come out with that game because it's a lot of I think that would be a good seller. Right. All right. Well, here's my prediction. These guys have been promising pinball circus for a couple of years now. They've delivered nothing.

[37:46] Now they're tearing apart kingpin saying they're remaking that. Here's my prediction in this company. I just still think these guys do absolutely nothing of significance in 2018. And again, this is our prediction for what happens next year.

[38:01] I think they're going to struggle to get any of these games out in number. I also think they're going to remake the artwork for kingpin because they've already shown a translate of theirs. And it looks like a fucking bad menu from a time square restaurant.

[38:20] Like that fucking bad dead. So here's the thing. If you're going to remake kingpin remake it. Don't redo the artwork and make it look like a shitty time square restaurant menu.

[38:35] Also, like I hope they get their production now because these are games that people want. But people also want production chops. And I don't think people are going to wait for these companies to figure their shit out. So I don't think 2018 is going to see much from these guys.

[38:53] Yeah, I agree with that. That's possible. I mean, they're really not that far along. So they've got a long way to go.

[39:01] You know, they always said that they were going to see what happens with pinball circus. You know, I mean, this is you're right. This is I think we should really not even worry about them in 2018. And that's something that's possible for 2019.

[39:14] Okay, going down our list in alphabetical order, probably the most I would say this, this company is probably teed up to be the most successful pinball company of 2018. They have.

[39:29] It high win peak the interest of most people. And that is deep route. What do you think happens with deep root pinball?

[39:35] What's what's their deal again? That's that's the one that they were good that they hired John or something to do job pop it.

[39:42] So I introduced them deep root is working with John pop it to remake magic girl.

[39:51] Raza and Allison Wonderland and possibly more titles.

[39:56] What's up?

[39:59] Has that been confirmed by this?

[40:02] That website. There's a website that tells us legally how they're going to do this.

[40:09] How are they going to work on it? No, no, I said that it has been confirmed that they've hired him and they are going to work on those games.

[40:15] Yes. Wow. Where have you been Ted? There's like a whole website.

[40:20] Oh, I heard it was a rumor, but I thought like anything else that they were going to hire him. He was going to go in there.

[40:26] We turned to a shit show of the crap would come down on them and they'd say holy crap. What the hell did we do and get rid of them?

[40:32] Right. Okay. So let me let me let me ask you a question.

[40:36] They they're working with John pop it. They have said to the pinball world.

[40:42] John is our guy, but only we know how to make his games work.

[40:48] Do you think they will successfully unravel the mystery of John pop it.

[40:55] You know what else could if they if they have bottomless pockets.

[41:02] Then I'd say the answer is yes. If there are company that's going to try to go in there and get something together and you know half-ass it, then no, they're going to just they're going to sink.

[41:11] If he's having to find a company that he bullshit it like the other ones, but these people have a crap loaded dough and they manage him.

[41:20] Then yeah, of course there's a shot.

[41:22] Right. Okay. My prediction is this. There is a shot. Who's going to support this scum?

[41:26] Right. My prediction is this nobody has ever proven to have successfully been able to work with John pop it.

[42:05] I know who loves pinball who's very wealthy, very egotistical.

[42:11] And I think John sold them on a bunch of lies like John always does and we will see nothing from deep root in 20.

[42:19] If the if the people love pinball, why would they get involved with this scumbag?

[42:23] Exactly. I can't answer that.

[42:26] They they know the history of this guy and how we ripped off people.

[42:29] I don't know the guy personally. I know he's done some some good stuff, but you know, I understand that he may go in there and you know take people's money and maybe have good intentions who the hell knows.

[42:40] But after you do one machine, don't produce it to another, do another and keep taking people's money.

[42:45] And then just don't have any plan on restitution for these people or whatever.

[42:50] You know, in my book, the guy is just a scumbag and anybody that supports him is a scumbag company.

[42:55] And I wouldn't want anything to do with them to take it.

[42:58] Look, as an owner of a magic girl, as an owner of a magic girl, I just I break it down like this.

[43:03] John worked on magic girl for five long years.

[43:09] Magic girl is without fundamental things that make a pinball machine work.

[43:16] It doesn't even have the shooter lane groove carved into the play field.

[43:20] When I was talking to the coder, he said to me, Chris, to lock a ball, you've got to hit this and hit this and then it goes up the ramp and goes into the diverter to go into the ball lock.

[43:34] And I'm like, that diverter ramp doesn't even exist.

[43:38] John Papaduke designed an illusion and Apple juice, the coder, code it, something that doesn't even exist.

[43:48] The guy's a lunatic. Nothing's going to happen ever good from John Papaduke.

[43:52] Alright, let's move on.

[43:54] I bought one, but that's one of the story.

[43:56] Yeah, I bought one. I lost, you know, not too much. I got out.

[43:59] I'll do it. I think you're going to look.

[44:01] I'll say it like this. I've spent more money in a strip club in a single night than I've lost on magic girl.

[44:09] Well, I'm pissed off at that, by the way.

[44:11] Well, the crazy part is, is it was John Papaduke giving me a lap dance when I lost that money.

[44:16] Oh, that's disgusting.

[44:18] What's that?

[44:19] Look, he was showing me his raza. Alright, so the next on my list, and I'm doing this after way.

[44:24] I'm looking at Dennis Nordman's pitch and bat game.

[44:29] Oh, everyone wants to forget about everyone wants to forget these things.

[44:33] I don't want to forget about it. I want one.

[44:35] You want one. Talk to me about pitching bad.

[44:37] That's bad.

[44:38] Pitch and bat. I love those games.

[44:40] Alright, let me show you a question because I got in a big argument.

[44:42] Do you find our pitching bats pinball machines?

[44:45] Um.

[44:48] What what are they called?

[44:51] They call them pitching bat machines.

[44:53] Are they called pitching bat pinball machines?

[44:55] I don't know.

[44:56] Does it fucking matter?

[44:57] It's a pinball.

[44:58] So here's the thing.

[45:00] The name pinball comes from a pin a steel ball going up and hitting pins, which like steel pins, which doesn't happen in any modern form.

[45:11] I know. I probably wouldn't call it a pinball machine.

[45:14] Yeah, I just called a pitch and bat game the same way.

[45:17] Like like if you have those games called we're throwing a ball in the circles of ski ball or something.

[45:21] You know, I mean, you don't call that a pinball machine.

[45:23] You know, I mean, it's why the fuck would I call a ski ball a pinball?

[45:27] Doesn't have a little steel ball?

[45:30] Like a pin a pinball is a pinball like the little steel ball is a pinball, right?

[45:34] I would call the pitch and bat.

[45:35] I don't know if I can pull a pinball.

[45:36] Okay.

[45:37] Okay, let's not get into the semantics around the title.

[45:41] What do you think about Dennis Norman's pitching bats?

[45:44] I like it.

[45:45] I mean, I like the zombie one.

[45:47] I think it's really, really cool.

[45:48] I like pitching bad games.

[45:50] I mean, I think they're fun.

[45:51] The zombie thing is great.

[45:53] I mean, I really can't wait to play it.

[45:55] You know, if that's another game, if it's as fun as it seems, you know, it's not super expensive.

[46:01] It just seems like a real fun game.

[46:04] All right.

[46:05] My prediction is nobody gives a shit about pitching bats in 2018.

[46:09] This game will come out.

[46:11] I do think the zombie one looks interesting.

[46:13] I've played them at the shows.

[46:15] I just don't understand how like Dennis Norman is able to even get the funding to make these little side projects.

[46:21] It's like this thing, like the wool nelly game that didn't really sell well.

[46:26] Well, Nelly did good.

[46:29] Did nobody thought that we would want an EM game?

[46:33] It didn't sell that well.

[46:35] These games are just like the side project, like wins the cool things these guys get permission to make.

[46:42] Right.

[46:43] If you're going to go through all the effort, at least make something that like people really want.

[46:48] It's like what these dissonance want.

[46:50] These games just meant sell thousands of units.

[46:52] I think these are only the side projects.

[46:54] I think these are only meant to go out to, you know, I think if they sell five, six hundred thousand, I think they're thrilled.

[47:00] I think they're good.

[47:02] I would say that these pitch and bats won't even, they won't even sell 300 of them.

[47:08] Oh, I think you're wrong.

[47:10] Who?

[47:11] Who's buying them?

[47:12] I don't know.

[47:13] Pitch and patch you a lot of fun.

[47:14] But anyway, okay.

[47:15] All right.

[47:16] If we see more than 400 new and box openings of pitch and bats, I will send Ted a check for $1,000.

[47:22] The next company on our list.

[47:24] The next company is another super.

[47:27] I want it.

[47:28] No, no, we're not there yet.

[47:30] It's a Dutch pinball close.

[47:32] Dutch pinball.

[47:33] What happens to Dutch pinball in 2018?

[47:35] Oh, Dutch pinball.

[47:36] Well, look, again, this is another company.

[47:40] It's overseas.

[47:41] We don't really know too much about it except for what we read and whatever.

[47:45] They seem, these guys seem to be, and everybody was really on their back.

[47:49] These guys seem to be trying to make good.

[47:52] They got a company in China, wherever the hell it is.

[47:57] They seem that they want to make good on these games.

[47:59] And so, you know, I don't know.

[48:02] I don't know what's going to happen with the game.

[48:04] Ted, this isn't like Ted telling us what these guys intentions are.

[48:10] What do you think is good at?

[48:13] I think they're going to get their big Lebowski in 2018.

[48:16] I think they're going to come out with it with with big Lebowski in 2018 and they're going to start delivering games.

[48:21] Okay, so you think everyone who's in on one is going to get satiated in 2018?

[48:26] I don't know about satiated, but I think they're good at their game.

[48:30] Okay, but you think they'll get what they paid for?

[48:33] I think so.

[48:34] Okay.

[48:35] That's my prediction.

[48:36] Okay, no, no.

[48:37] This isn't like you have to give the prediction that I want you to give.

[48:42] This is exactly what I want in this show.

[48:45] So here's my prediction.

[48:46] I think that Dutch Pimbal closes its doors in 2018.

[48:53] I'll tell you what, the business model these guys have in place to make more games requires a lot of new orders to come in to pay for all of the new manufacturing they need to make the game's reality.

[49:11] So, ostensibly this, they need new money to build the old machines and that is nothing short of a Ponzi scheme business model.

[49:22] And because of that, they're not going to be able to hoodwink new investors or new buyers to go in on the big Lebowski.

[49:32] This company will close in 2018 and the other part of this company that's interesting, there will be an auction of those 40 games that ARA has in their inventory that happens when Dutch Pimbal closes its doors and those games are going to go for 15 to 20,000 each.

[49:53] That's my prediction.

[49:55] I would, if they were still floundering and they didn't have a plan, I would agree with that.

[50:01] But because they have a factory in China, because they have a prototype, because they're obviously sinking money into doing all this again, I think they'd have to be horses asses to dump all that money into what they've been doing so far if they didn't intend to produce.

[50:16] That's just my prediction.

[50:18] I agree with you on the level that they took people's money four years ago and they've delivered only 50 games in four years, pathetic, get out of Pimbal.

[50:29] All right, let's go on to the other super successful company Highway Pimbal. Talk to me, Todd.

[50:38] I have a lot of mixed feelings about. I know their history, I know what they went through, I know they have the new owners in there.

[50:47] I'm hoping a lot of people seem to be enjoying the game and I get that.

[50:52] And again, Alien would have been on one of the games on my shortlist as well.

[50:56] I'd love to get an Alien game.

[50:58] But it's very hard to get behind a company that does not communicate.

[51:03] They certainly, I hate when these companies they come into Pinside or all the sites or whatever when they're trying to push something, try to push the games, they're in there all the time.

[51:11] Then all of a sudden they just, when people have the hard questions, they vanish.

[51:16] If they're going to be involved in this community like this because they're a boutique company, they should be more involved and keep us in the loop.

[51:24] All they have to do and people are very forgiving. All they have to do is tell the truth.

[51:29] All they would have to have done is come in and say, hey, look, we're fucked.

[51:32] We came in, we took over this company, we thought there was more money, there wasn't.

[51:37] We thought that we had more parts, we didn't and we're fucked here, but we're going to make as many of these as we can.

[51:43] And we're going to get them out to you and we're going to try to help you as best we can.

[51:46] If you have a problem with it, we know some of them are going to go out.

[51:49] Our quality control is going to be so, so we're hoping that you guys can fix all the shit yourselves and give us some clues.

[51:56] But we're going to be right there behind you and get parts out to you and all they had to do is tell the truth and people be falling over themselves like, oh, you know, no problem.

[52:04] But no, instead they go, I meant they're not doing the refunds or giving little bits and pieces.

[52:10] Some people are getting help, some people are getting dick.

[52:13] You know, how much trouble is it that if a guy that got one of the machines needs the fucking Xeno head, get them the damn parts, stick it in a box and put it in the mail.

[52:23] The guy even offered to pay the postage. I mean, how far do you have to go?

[52:26] So the company to me has fallen short in that department as far as their quality control and their and their, you know, just dealing with people and refunds.

[52:38] So that pisses me off.

[52:40] Right.

[52:41] But I predict they're going to, I mean, they're going to, I mean, they're going to make it.

[52:47] If they can get their shit together because evidently, a lot of people even when these games don't even work, people are enjoying them.

[52:57] They're saying they're different. It's really cool that they love alien as I do.

[53:02] And so the theme really takes over so much of this game and people love it so much that if they just got their shit together and told the truth, I think they could make it.

[53:14] Whether they are or not, I don't know, but I think they could. If they, if they get their act straightened out and start getting some games out there, I think they could, I think they can turn it around.

[53:24] Whether they will, I don't know.

[53:26] Right. All right. Well, I think that was all beautiful. I think it was well said. I think that the lack of transparency has been a problem for many people.

[53:37] I think the lack of refunds has been the ultimate red flag for people as they think about investing in highway pinball.

[53:44] Here's my take and I've been brutally honest. Highway pinball and Dutch pinball are both going to go under in 2018.

[53:53] And I'll explain why these guys had no idea how deep the rabbit hole went in terms of Andrew highway is bad business decisions.

[54:04] And there is no way to get to the green. There's no way to make a profit in companies that spend four to five years putting the company in the red.

[54:15] And alien pinball is not even that good. And that's my opinion. This game keeps, it keeps being like put on life support and it keeps being sort of shield by the 20 guys on pinside who want it to be great.

[54:33] But when you really look at the alien pinball machine, it's plagued with issues. It's plagued with problems. It's plagued with like all the things that Andrew highway like left these guys.

[54:45] Here's my prediction. I've played it at Alan town. Yeah, it's a broken man. It's a broken man. It was just horrible.

[54:53] First of all, the Zeno didn't work at all. They had that disconnected. And then the ball coming up the thing, whatever the hell you call it, would have to try to pop up about six or seven times before the damp. They would finally get out there.

[55:05] I mean, it was just it was painful to play, but I can see where we find it.

[55:09] We've been saying this Ted. I've been saying this for two years now. The moment Sigourney weaver was in part of alien pinball was the moment everyone should have bailed on this failed attempt at making a bet.

[55:22] At making a pinball machine based on this franchise people love. It is a joke of a theme integration. It has good music. It has good lights. I get all that. But how can you make an alien pinball machine without the main character of alien?

[55:39] It's like making Batman without Batman. And look, all that's a mute point because at the end of the day, everything Andrew highway tried to innovate the modular system of swapping your play field out. Right?

[55:53] You buy a full throttle and you swap an alien. That's a failure. All the different things he designed and redesigned for his company have failed. These guys are done.

[56:05] Alien pinball is going to be followed up by Texas pinball festival. These guys are going to announce that their next machine is queen pinball queen the band. Nobody's going to give it away. Yeah, highway is going to announce that queen is going to follow up title.

[56:26] Who wants queen?

[56:30] If I was people, I would just say I want my damn alien to work. I want to think about it. Until you get your shit together, you get people paid their refunds that want it and get their machines that every one of them isn't in the cry. I actually don't believe that there's one machine that works perfectly. I don't believe.

[56:50] It's like, why can't they refund people?

[56:55] They're not the money, I guess. Yeah, real simple. Like, but it's like, if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. If they can't refund people and they say they're they can't then they're out of money. And this company is out of money.

[57:10] And Dave Sanders and the people over there that are like constantly trying to convince us, ferret the coder, like this company is done.

[57:20] They they collapsed when Andrew highway whose name is on the company door got booted. You know, last time I checked when like James Dyson didn't get kicked out a Dyson vacuum cleaner.

[57:33] He's like, he's the founder of this organization and he he failed. And I just what I what sucks about Pimbal is the inability for companies that fail to actually fail.

[57:48] Like John Papaduke, Andrew highway, Kevin Kool Lake, you know, should have no business being in Pimbal in 2018.

[57:59] Yeah, yeah. All right. So let's go on because I think highway fails. I think it's going to be collapse. I don't think most people are going to get their LEDs. And I think the LEDs not even in Ellie. It's a piece of shit. All right. Let's go into.

[58:11] Let's go into a more positive company because this is it. You know, let's go on. No, actually no, I'm wrong. Let's go to home pin.

[58:18] Yeah. So home pin and. Home pin.

[58:22] Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It looks like a real cool game to me. I'm looking forward to playing it. You know, it's another one of these these things where I liked that this guy is out in.

[58:34] In China and he's making all these parts and he's making parts for other people that need them. And, um, you know, I mean, there's been some controversy at the guy. I don't get I personally don't give two shit about what.

[58:45] You know, as long as he's doing his job and he's not ripping people off, that's all I really care about. I don't care if the guy is a freaking eaten kittens. It doesn't matter to me as long as he's doing what he says he's going to do.

[58:56] So, uh, you know, I hope that.

[58:59] Okay. He's made it very obvious that you know, these games are not being produced for the United States right away. If they get here, they get here if they don't they don't. So I mean, I'm looking forward to playing one.

[59:10] And I hope I hope he continues to make the games. I hope he continues to make the boards and the parts that we need.

[59:17] Wow, Ted, that was that was beautiful.

[59:20] Let me. Let me. Let me. Let me. Let me break it down on like a more specific level. So you think Thunderbirds will sell well in 2018.

[59:33] Yeah, I think it will. I think everyone knows Thunderbirds and I think everybody where?

[59:40] Well, everybody I know no stuff. But we're that you know, we're into that kind of stuff.

[59:45] Okay. So you don't think that makes vitriolic like politically incorrect.

[59:55] His whole fucking crazy rant he's gone on like racist comments like sex is. You don't think any of that will impact his company's well.

[01:00:07] Doesn't bother me a bit. I get it doesn't bother you.

[01:00:10] Me and my friends talk a word together. Oh my god. We'd be.

[01:00:13] But you're not. Ted, you're not selling me a machine.

[01:00:16] I know. I know. Look, that's the guy's personality. If you're buying a game on personality, well, I guess that everybody should be selling their.

[01:00:23] Let's remove the personality from. Let's remove the personality. Thunderbirds when it was revealed was laughed at for being shitty.

[01:00:32] Did you see the video of it? I saw some some some videos of it, you know, and they changed a bunch of things and they they're making it better.

[01:00:42] Okay, but the initial thing and listening, they took it to shows. They listened to all the comments. They agreed with a bunch of the comments and they're going back on their changing some of the layout that changing the size of the toy.

[01:00:52] They're listening to people and they're making changes, which I applaud.

[01:00:56] All right, cool. All right. So test prediction is that Thunderbirds will sell well in 2018 and that it will find buyers. My prediction is this.

[01:01:05] Okay. I think Mike is a terrible, terrible, terrible marketer.

[01:01:12] Anyone who starts a company wants to create one thing and that's buyers and fans of the company.

[01:01:20] Mike has shown time and time again to give two shits about that and the number one market in the world for pinball is the United States of America.

[01:01:32] And Mike is time and time again. You know said he doesn't give a shit about that. He's selling games to Australians. Okay, that's cool.

[01:01:40] Here's the thing. I have many friends in Australia and I have many friends who are the target for this game. The game looks like a leftover, data east, Sega game.

[01:01:51] You're going to come out with a pinball machine in 2018 that has orange DMD dots as the display.

[01:01:59] Ted, the Australian podcasts that are out there also won't even deal with this guy. Like he has no fans.

[01:02:07] Okay. Who's next?

[01:02:10] Jersey Jack pinball 2018. Let's talk about Jersey Jack.

[01:02:17] Well, um, hired to the Caribbean and dialed in. I haven't played it, but, but from what I'm reading everyone that does is is going crazy over it.

[01:02:30] So, you know, it's not not my kind of theme, but why not like explain it to me. I'm not like pirate.

[01:02:38] I'm not a big fan of the movie. You know, so it's just, you know, it's just that for me. It's just theme. I mean, again, I'm a mediocre to crappy player.

[01:02:47] So to me theme and how it looks and everything is the main thing. And, you know, so again, you know, I'm looking for games like, you know, the old viral games, the space games and, you know, that sort of monster bash, show you what monsters and that's that's my thing.

[01:03:04] You know, so this I wasn't a big fan of that stuff. I'm very much looking forward to playing it. And I hope that, you know, friends of mine get it and I'll be able to play it there.

[01:03:13] And so I know I know I know it's going to.

[01:03:16] How do you think it does in the marketplace?

[01:03:21] It surprised me a little bit that they did a machine that's already been made, you know, that that that that the title has already been out there. So that that did surprise me a little bit.

[01:03:31] I don't know how popular the original one was.

[01:03:34] I mean, just again, my soul connection is pinside. So just by reading that, it seems like a lot of people, you know, want the game.

[01:03:44] Okay. So I think it's going to do well. Okay. What do you think?

[01:03:48] Kaneda's prediction for Jersey Jack in 2018 is, you know, I've been thinking a lot about this because I do like Jack and I like what his team's doing over there.

[01:03:58] The game came out at Expo in October and people loved it, right? I mean, people like when bonkers for it, they were excited to see Eric and his new mechanisms and the game itself looked great.

[01:04:11] But six months will pass between that and when the game goes on sale. And here's my prediction.

[01:04:17] And I think you hit it on the head, Ted, is when you said, theme is everything.

[01:04:23] And this continues to be the quagmire for me when I look at pinball marketing because it's like nobody really wants pirates of the Caribbean pinball in 2018.

[01:04:35] The movies have been long forgotten in the sense of cultural relevance. So you're going to make pirates of the Caribbean.

[01:04:44] You're going to send your new designer, your new engineer, Eric, who's brilliant. And you're going to ask him to make a game based on a theme that nobody wants on a movie that bombed the last two have bombed at the box office.

[01:05:00] Wait a minute, but don't forget. I mean, a lot of people are not like maybe like you're either buy it on the theme alone, they buy it because it's a fun game.

[01:05:10] If you talk about bombs, I mean, look at everybody was predicting the dialed in. It was going to tank and be a be horrible.

[01:05:18] And I don't know anyone that's played that game that says that they don't think it's one of the top games they've ever played. It's tons of fun, including me.

[01:05:25] Well, here's my other prediction. Nobody, but people love it because they just love the gameplay of the game.

[01:05:31] Yeah, but here's the issue. Here's the issue. I bet Stern has sold more Mustang machines than Jersey Jack has sold a dialed in.

[01:05:40] And I'll tell you, this is the problem. And this is Jack's biggest problem. Jack let Pat Lawler spend five years making dialed in.

[01:05:52] Five years in the making. People forget this. That game has been in the works for five years.

[01:05:59] And he wraps it in a theme that makes it hard for Jersey Jack to sell even 2000 units. And meanwhile, Stern can sell five to six thousand units of ACDC.

[01:06:15] And that is Jack's issue. And I say this with like, almost like compassion and empathy for Jack where it's like, why would you let Pat Lawler work on a game for five years?

[01:06:30] I think he invested a million dollars in Pat Lawler and you let him determine the theme and you make it dialed in.

[01:06:39] If that was JAWS Ted, how many units would have sold? Well, yeah, but that's it. Like that game could have been anything.

[01:06:50] People are loving dialed in. Yeah, I agree. If he would have taken that theme and made it invaders from Venus and made it with spaceships and giant insects and...

[01:07:01] No, no, just make it a theme. If you think about Pat Lawler's biggest games were what? Adam's family twilight zone.

[01:07:11] It wasn't road show or fun house. So basically Jersey Jack let Pat make an original theme when Pat's biggest selling games ever were licensed properties.

[01:07:25] I just goes to show that like he made a mistake. And I think people are still going to wait for Toy Story because out of all the Jersey Jack rumored themes, Toy Story by Pat Lawler is the only one people really want.

[01:07:43] Okay, well, mine is me, of course. I really couldn't care less about it. I love the movies, but I really like it.

[01:07:49] You're like a great example. So would you have bought Wizard of Oz? Oh, yes, yes. A Wizard of Oz were my favorite movies.

[01:07:57] Okay, did you buy the page? I have three, but many playfields. I had to bought that the first thing.

[01:08:01] If you didn't have three playfields? I don't like many playfields. Okay, so you love the theme and you passed on it because you felt that they put too much like too much upper playfield into it.

[01:08:13] Hobbit. Yeah, it's not it's that would you like that kind of would you bought a habit?

[01:08:17] Um, to obtain the truth, Hobbit, I haven't played enough to really know. Okay.

[01:08:24] So I really don't know, but you're not a hobbit lover. Like right, the movies didn't speak to you.

[01:08:30] Right. I'm not a big lover of the or Lord of the Rings. I'm like I said, I'm more of a science fiction fan than I am a fantasy fan.

[01:08:40] You know, so I mean, if they would come out with a Ray Harryhausen machine from seven of the way just some bear something like that. I would be the first one.

[01:08:47] What Ray Harryhausen? I love it. You always bring it up. Okay. So then dial then. Would did that speak to you?

[01:08:56] Oh, yeah, that I thought was a real fun machine. Um, you know, again, it wasn't.

[01:09:02] I don't know. It was just one of those machines. It's fun to play. I don't know if I would buy one. If I had a choice of buying, you know, that or or a monster bash or big bang bar, I would take those other titles.

[01:09:13] If I'm Jersey Jack's marketing director, you are exactly my target. You are the guy that needs to feel like I need to own this machine.

[01:09:26] And Jersey Jack has not made the machine that makes you say that yet. And that is their problem. You're the target. You're the target. Okay. Let's go on because I think that Jersey Jack, he needs to call me and have me head up his marketing because I would have.

[01:09:42] That's what he needs to happen. Hey, look. All right. Next next. Next on our list is Spokey or Stern?

[01:09:50] Not where we're going alphabetically. Multi-morphic P3.

[01:09:57] It sounds like a catheter. I don't know. What is that? So you know P3 right. Lexi light speed. It's the game with the LCD play field.

[01:10:08] Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Like I said, I played one at at Alan town one time and it wasn't for this way. It was better than I thought.

[01:10:22] But I didn't like it like a real pinball machine. Okay. It still was like playing a video thing. It just didn't have it. It doesn't do anything for me. I don't think I would ever get one.

[01:10:32] I'm going to let Ted speak for both of us on that one. Okay. So Quetzal. These are the guys who are making that Captain Nemo machine.

[01:10:41] Oh, well, I thought that was done. Yeah. Did they even ship any to America?

[01:10:47] Well, yeah. I think they were only going to make whatever it was five or seven and they made them. And that's it. I think that's, I think that's done.

[01:10:54] Okay. So Quetzal you're done with Ted and I see you later. Guys, nothing in 2018. All right. Riot pinball. So there's a rumor that Riot. Do you think Riot will get the wrath of Olympus game made in 2018?

[01:11:09] To be honest with you, I have no idea. I played the game when it was in Alan town. Again, I thought it was sort of a fun game, but not when I would buy.

[01:11:19] Yeah. See you later, woolly. You couldn't even get a hundred people to buy it when you had the game. You're not getting it a hundred people in 2018 game over. All right. Let's go to skit b pinball.

[01:11:31] I think I thought we have to go to pinball companies. Okay. Do you think anyone. Do you think anyone gets their money back?

[01:11:40] Um, no. Let's go to spooky. Let's go to be dragged out in the courts and whatever. I mean, again, I think everyone's pretty much realizing now that they just want to, you know, cause them as much pain as possible because of what he did.

[01:12:00] Hey, look, I was behind the guy too. I mean, this guy had a working prototype. He took it around to the shows. I played the game.

[01:12:09] A few different, at least three different times. You know, no, it wasn't the greatest game in the world, but again, it's in all these games like alien. It's the theme was everything. It was freaking predator, man.

[01:12:20] It was like, you couldn't do anything. The only complaint I had with the game is I didn't think that that target in the front was too close and the balls were bounced back and I told them that was it.

[01:12:29] But I got a little great with it. He would call me up at night sometimes and, you know, tell me he's doing this. They made a shirt for me. I tell him I don't wear t-shirts. So they made an actual button shirt for me with the logo. I'm going to put that on.

[01:12:40] You still have it. Yes, I do. It's in the class. I can buy that of you.

[01:12:45] Sure you can. Let's do it. It's an actual button shirt. It's not a t-shirt. It's an actual. I want to wear it. I want to wear it to. Yeah.

[01:12:54] Important client meetings and me like, look at this shirt people. Yes, but yeah, they had that. And again, I just because of the theme and they seem they were trying real hard and I got suckered just like everybody else. I mean, you got out right.

[01:13:10] Yeah, well, I was, yeah, I was in and at the time I had no deal coming and I sold a bunch of my stuff and, you know, I had a poster deal and I was going to get involved in a cigar company.

[01:13:21] And so I got out of all the stuff and luckily just luckily it was that and I even told him I sound really give a shit. It was only 250 bucks or something or 300 whatever I gave him just to put down.

[01:13:31] And I just told him I said it's no big deal if you need the money, you know, no biggie, but you know, I'm not going to be able to get the machine, you know, because I told him of course they'd be out with like six months. I'm not going to get the machine.

[01:13:42] And two days later, we just just sent me back to the department. So I was very, very lucky on that. Well, look, 2018. I hope 2018 is just the year that it all ends. Like no one's going to get their money back.

[01:13:56] Kevin is a loser. We all know this. The lawyer is going to get paid in nobody else. Let's move on to spooky pinball. So spooky pinball in 2018 will keep shipping total nuclear annihilation and the big title. This is the big title Ted.

[01:14:15] How do you think Alice Cooper nightmare castle does?

[01:14:21] If it's you know, that's totally going to be on the gameplay of the machine. I think it's a fantastic theme. If they make it like an old virus sort of game with a lot of this cool stuff in it, I think it's going to be really neat.

[01:14:36] If it falls flat, it could fall flat. But I mean, the theme is there. All they have to do is make a really good game. And I think that'll sell. I mean, they're games. I mean, again, they don't make thousands of games. They make, you know, a few hundred games. And they're usually sold out right away. So, you know,

[01:14:55] they're going to keep happening with that. It's not going to keep happening with spooky right. This like immediate sellout. I think the more experience they get with this thing and the more, you know, games they make and the more money they get for these things. And I think they're going to each game that they have come out with. I think he's going to get a little bit better.

[01:15:16] So my prediction, my prediction for spooky and I do think like they will get better because I think they know they have to get better because I think they've seen the writing on the wall that Rob Zombie and America's most haunted have had lukewarm responses from like real pinball fans after taking ownership.

[01:15:38] Here's the thing. I think Alice Cooper. Ted, do you think they sell all 500 of them?

[01:15:44] Other make you 500. I think they could. I mean, again, it's going to be totally how that game plays. If the game plays like a like a scared stiff type game has a lot of cool stuff on it. I think I think they could sell them right away.

[01:16:02] Do you think Alice Cooper as a theme? Does that appeal to you as a heart? You're a horror fan.

[01:16:10] Yes. Well, I know Alice Cooper. So I mean, I've had conversations. Alice Cooper has come to the Chiller conventions.

[01:16:16] You know, and I've actually sat down with him and had a conversation with a very, very nice guy by the way. And yeah, there's big, big fans. I mean, I've gone through a number of the concerts. He has a very, very good fan base.

[01:16:29] A lot of people like him. I mean, again, for me, it's not the music I list to all the time, but the songs that he's done that are good songs are great.

[01:16:36] Okay. So I think enough there. It's the horror thing. I mean, he's big into the horror stuff. You know, that's, you know.

[01:16:43] So my prediction is this. I think that total nuclear annihilation will continue to be like a decent like seller for spooky.

[01:16:52] It'll probably go down to spooky's best selling machine of all time in 2018 in terms of volume. I think there's so more than 300 total nuclear annihilations.

[01:17:02] I don't know, right? Alice Cooper is a game that none of us have seen much on. Right? We haven't seen anything. I've seen a translate.

[01:17:11] And I've seen maybe like the back box art, which is.

[01:17:15] And we saw that skull that looks like a ball might fly out. Right. So which is like embarrassingly little to predict on a pinball machine.

[01:17:22] So we're moving on to Stern right now. And we're moving on to Stern. So Stern pinball 2018.

[01:17:28] So let me ask you a question Ted. Like if you had a choice to buy a monster's or Alice Cooper's nightmare castle on theme alone.

[01:17:37] What pulls you in?

[01:17:40] Taking a viral out of the question. You can't put a viral into the question.

[01:17:48] I know. I always try though. I would probably go with monsters.

[01:17:55] I would probably go with monsters because you know, I watched them when they originally came on.

[01:18:08] I got to meet a number of the people that were in the in the in the monsters. I got to hang out with the out Lewis. It is restaurant in in New York many times.

[01:18:17] I just like the monsters. You know, I like Alice Cooper too. But I mean if you're forcing me to pick one that I would buy, I'd probably go for monsters before I.

[01:18:25] Okay. So let's talk about Stern in 2018 because Stern's gonna. Stern's. Let me give you the rumored titles that.

[01:18:33] And these are all. So you got put in people asleep. This is supposed to be a half. I know we're wrapping up this is it. Stern's the end after Stern ahead did wear, but there's no Zidoo.

[01:18:42] So this here's we go time shocks never happening. So for Stern, the rumor titles next year.

[01:18:50] I think the rumor titles are monsters, Deadpool, Iron Maiden, Beatles as a Kappao game. Those are the rumors and maybe Pulp Tiction.

[01:19:04] Okay. Now I know that it's not going to be six games. There's Stern's going to have three releases next year.

[01:19:14] Yeah. Well, luckily I'm not interested in any of them. I mean, I'm not interested in Paul fiction. I'm not interested in what was the other Iron Maiden.

[01:19:24] I'm not interested in Iron Maiden at all. Deadpool. I'm not interested in Deadpool at all.

[01:19:29] Monsters. I would be interested in the Beatles and I would be and I would 100% buy that because it's my favorite bandable time.

[01:19:37] But for when I understand it's going to be yellow summary. So I really don't care that much about the yellow summary movie.

[01:19:45] If it was Beatles, like, you know, if they had like you play through, you know, the Beatles, let's say the first three or four albums, you know, be one set of Beatles then going to the Sergeant Pepper type era, then going to like the Abbey Road type, you don't have like the three.

[01:19:58] Separate, you know, groupings of, you know, how the Beatles progressed and their music. I mean, that would be on board and day one, but a yellow submarine.

[01:20:07] It was just, you know, like I said, it wasn't a big deal to me. Right. So how do you think Stern is going to do next year?

[01:20:14] Well, it's like, why do you think Stern does next year?

[01:20:18] I think Stern always the, I think Stern is always going to do good. I mean, I mean, let's let's face reality.

[01:20:24] I mean, they come out with how many games a year, three or four games a year. Regardless of how much people bitch and moan about the quality or the wood is warping or the things are popping out of the no boards are flying out of the window.

[01:20:41] It doesn't matter. They still buy people are still buying the games. I mean, I mean, there's only only game in town that that's producing games on a consistent level. You know that in 2018, Stern will be releasing three or four games.

[01:20:55] And that's bottom line. So it's like they still until a company can come up and compete with them head to head like that. It's still very tough to compete when you're only making, you know, one game a year or one game every two years. It's hard to compete in the market. Yeah, you can do it.

[01:21:11] But Stern is definitely going to eat up the, but especially if they're going to come out with stuff like, you know, the Beatles and, and you know, some of these these rumor titles, deadpool or whatever.

[01:21:21] I mean, I think I think Guardians of the Galaxy was a good choice. I haven't played the game yet. But yeah, everybody loves the movie.

[01:21:28] Ted, here's my prediction. Here's my prediction. I think Stern is going to have one of its weakest years in history. And I'll explain why.

[01:21:37] Are going to have one.

[01:21:39] So if you think about the year prior, let's talk about the last 12 months of Stern releases. Ghostbusters, Batman and Star Wars. Okay, let's put those titles up against.

[01:21:54] Well, they all, but selling wise, they all sold really well, right?

[01:22:01] Yes, but like, let me, like, you sell, you sell high amounts at the beginning and then it, you know, it, it, it, it, like, it decreases significantly.

[01:22:14] Yeah, so you have a window for like hype for machine. So like, I'm just saying, like, in terms of like within 20, basically, 2017, Stern was like hot selling Ghostbusters, Batman and Star Wars.

[01:22:29] There is no way Iron Maiden, Deadpool and maybe monsters or maybe like Pulp Fiction, I don't know, you know, these titles have nowhere near the cachet or the demand that Ghostbusters, Batman and Star Wars does.

[01:22:47] I think here's my prediction. I think Stern really got Star Wars wrong. I thought they thought Star Wars would sell well into 2018 and demand would be much higher than it was.

[01:23:00] I still think that game is a mess. I think Stern is going to have a lukewarm year. And here's why. I think Deadpool is a title that doesn't speak to many pinball collectors.

[01:23:12] And I think that that game is going to struggle. I think Iron Maiden gets you even more into like a niche rock group. I love music. I love major rock acts. I couldn't even tell you an Iron Maiden song.

[01:23:27] I couldn't either. I mean, I'm sure if you named one or played one, I'm sure I've heard it.

[01:23:32] I've heard it or but like Iron Maiden is not on the same cultural mainstream. They don't have the same mainstream sort of appeal as Guns and Roses, as YouTube, as like ACDC, as Metallica.

[01:23:50] There's just not on that same mainstream level.

[01:23:53] I know like Led Zeppelin, you know, the Beatles, you know, these are my bands. I really don't know. I don't listen to ACDC. I don't listen to Metallica. I don't listen to Iron Maiden. I don't listen to these guys.

[01:24:09] I think Guardians of the Galaxy will ultimately be like a Miss Interns world. I again, I think that game. And I think the way Stern handle the launch of it and the WWE armor and just throwing songs in late.

[01:24:28] Those aren't the kinds of themes that Pinball fanatics want. Pinball fanatics want jaws. Well get us jaws. Pinball fanatics want nostalgic titles that like they have like an emotional and like indelible attachment to.

[01:24:48] I think Monsters is niche but has emotional appeal for people. So I think that title will do well. But I think Stern hasn't learned their lesson from Ghostbusters which is people fucking wanted Ghostbusters before even seeing it.

[01:25:06] It was sold out site unseen. So was Batman 66 and they've yet to follow up with a theme that made people wanted so badly. You know Star Wars was supposed to be that. But people saw Star Wars and were like, eh, tie fighter on the spring. What the fuck is this?

[01:25:27] I agree with both ends. I think people want the nostalgia. They want the joes. They want the monsters. They want the Beatles. They want the back to the future. They want that. But I think they want the new stuff too.

[01:25:39] I mean, I think stuff. Galaxy is going to be a hit. It's not a hit. The LVs are not sold out Ted.

[01:25:47] Not yet. But that's the whole point is like if you think about a title like Guardians, it's a current movie franchise. It hasn't been around for decades.

[01:25:57] Guys who buy Pinball machines are in their 40s, 50s and 60s. They didn't grow up as kids loving Guardians of the Galaxy movie. You bring out a Pinball machine that's only based on the first movie when the second movie just came out which is a fucking terrible marketing move.

[01:26:13] It's not sold out. It's not a hit. Okay. Stern's, Stern's, Stern's, I don't mean I'll still think it would be but Stern's measurement. They're measurement. I think all Pinball machine measurement for hit. If your Ellie sells out on day one, you got it right. If it doesn't, you fucked up.

[01:26:37] But you have to make your Ellie number like a real Ellie number, not like Jack with like a thousand Ellie dialed in.

[01:26:47] Yeah. Yeah. I know. So Jack's Collector's editions are his Ellie's. We all know that he did not sell 150 dialed in Collector's editions for 150, you know, 12,500 each at 150 in term.

[01:27:04] I wouldn't even be willing to guess how many I love that you came on the show tonight. Both of us. This is all like last minute impromptu snow storm northeast.

[01:27:18] What's your ultimate like word of advice for the pinball person out there in 2018?

[01:27:25] It's really going to come down. I think there's a lot of interesting stuff. It's really going to come down to what you can afford. I mean, I see people all the time now are moving machines. They want the new stuff.

[01:27:40] So they're getting rid of this stuff because they want to, you know, they want the Beatles and they want the new titles, who Dini and they want the new stuff that's coming up. So they're getting rid of the getting rid of machines.

[01:27:54] So it's going to be a tough choice. I think the interesting stuff coming up. I'm really looking forward to playing some of this stuff. I hope I hope we have an interesting talent show.

[01:28:06] Well, I agree with Ted. I think for me, the defining thing of 2018 is going to be this. I think so many games are going to come up for sale as people with collections want to get new things.

[01:28:20] I think it's going to cause the second hand market of pinball to collapse somewhat, especially with all these remakes coming out. And I think what people are going to realize is this Ted.

[01:28:33] Buying every new machine when it comes out in the year comes out is a losing proposition. I should only buy machines that I love to play and are a theme that I would love to own for years.

[01:28:49] And having just a few themes that I love is more rewarding than just chasing after every new game. And I think that's what people are going to start to realize more and more of is just have the few machines that you just love those themes and love those games and just be content with them and enjoy them.

[01:29:11] I think that's a draw on caps and whiskey. Fuck around with them when your friends are over. But stop chasing after every new machine.

[01:29:19] Well, that's what you would think would be the thing. But there's people out there that have, you see, I just don't have the space. But there's like friends of mine that have the space for these games.

[01:29:31] I don't mind going after a lot of the machines because they know they're going to just swap them out. But here's the thing Ted. I think what's going to happen in 2018 and moving into the future, they are going to lose a lot moving forward on these.

[01:29:48] They're not going to be able to buy a machine for 7200 and sell it for 6800 anymore. You're going to buy it for 7200 and no one's going to want it until it's 5200.

[01:29:59] And once that stops, once that starts happening, these guys will, they will think twice because the, that's that's always a possibility. But you know, like I said, there's a lot of people out there with a lot of dough.

[01:30:11] For rich, yeah, Ted, you and I both know this for rich dudes, all of what we're talking about means absolutely nothing. These guys will, these guys have watches that are like 100 Pimmel machines on their wrist.

[01:30:27] I don't tell me about it. Look at movie posters. Seriously, my friend bought the movie poster 250,000 dollars for a movie.

[01:30:34] 250,000 dollars for a poster.

[01:30:38] Oh, that's nothing. My other buddy sold his mummy half sheet for a 430,000.

[01:30:44] So think about that. So you know, that's right. Yeah, these are Todd fire.

[01:30:48] I like it. I said it all the time. Every time I start to think these things are overpriced, I look, listen to the show. Do me one favor.

[01:30:58] Go on eBay and type in Disney VHS. Apparently, the original like VHS versions of Disney movies.

[01:31:11] If you have the collection of like 10 of them, the buying out price is $50,000.

[01:31:20] I made a deal with a guy to take three of my movies and make them on VHS. It cracks me up. So I said, fine, do it. It's just, it's fun. They're on VHS. People, yeah, that retro stuff. It's like collecting albums, I guess. They just like the VHS.

[01:31:35] The key is this. For every Pimball machine, you should have 10 times that machine in savings.

[01:31:43] So if you have six machines that are worth 6,000 each, that's what, $36,000 in Pimball, you should have $360,000 somewhere in savings. If you don't, you don't have at least three or four times that you can't retire.

[01:32:01] I'm going to come find you and I'm going to come like put a, a health and hoodie on your head and beat you senseless. All right, Ted, Brenda's open the door. I knew once you go to bed. This has been an amazing rundown of 2018. I appreciate it.

[01:32:16] Are you going down town? I'm always going down town. Okay. Are we going to go? We're going to go. I'm going to drive you like I do every year.

[01:32:26] Okay. Cool. So everyone that's listening, thank you very much. I hope you had a nice Christmas and a nice new year. And let's hope that there's a lot of cool pinball games coming out in 2018.

[01:32:41] All right. Say no to drugs, kids. Say no to drugs. That's right. Don't text and drive your best. All right. Ted, thank you. We'll talk to you soon. Okay. See you later.

[01:32:51] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to die. We're going to die.

[01:33:01] I'm the mine.
