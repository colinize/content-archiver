[00:00] Yeah, I look forward to going to Texas every year, and Twippies are looking pretty good this year.

[00:04] ["Squidward Theme Song"]

[00:20] Aw, that was John Borg talking about the Twippies. They're gonna be great this year.

[00:25] Everybody welcome to the Canada Spinball Podcast. It is Sunday. We got a surprise!

[00:30] Scooby Doo stream Friday night. We're gonna talk about that. I want to give you my first impressions of this game.

[00:37] 48 hours later, how do I feel about Scooby Doo? Have I eaten my Scooby Snacks? Do I think this game is gonna sell out now?

[00:47] Do I think there's enough left to right movement in the game? We're gonna talk about it.

[00:51] But first, I want to thank some of our newest club members. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now at 566 club members.

[01:00] I thought it might be really hard to get to 600 by TPF, but I think it's now in sight. I want to thank William, Paul, Manania, Nicholas, Manuel, Trent, Heather,

[01:10] Breda, Armin, you guys are in the house. Doug is in the house. Thank you guys so much.

[01:15] Alright, so here's what I want to do before I talk about Spooky Pinball's Scooby Doo stream.

[01:20] I want to talk about a rumor that I'm hearing, and that rumor, you might have got the message,

[01:25] is that Quentin Tarantino was shown Pulp Fiction Pinball back in October, and he approved the machine,

[01:33] so the machine is ready for the line. So here's what we know about this game. We don't know that much,

[01:39] other than it's a single level game. For some reason, Tarantino wanted like an old school throwback Pulp Fiction

[01:47] machine. I don't know why, because if you watch the movie and you love the movie and who doesn't love that movie,

[01:54] the movie takes place, what? Like in the 80s or 90s? I think it takes place in the 90s. So why is a

[02:00] Pulp Fiction machine being made to look like it's from the 60s or 70s? I'm not so sure about that one.

[02:07] And so like that's what we know about this game. It's going to be a single level game. And here's

[02:12] the thing too, I think we all are at the point now where we're like, we don't want another single level

[02:18] game based on a popular theme that's probably going to have a really high price tag. We just got

[02:25] this James Bond Elwin pin. Please don't do the same thing to people with Pulp Fiction. Now the question

[02:32] I have about Pulp Fiction is this, who's designing it? I think the designer of this game is going to

[02:37] be Mark Ritchie. Okay, so Mark Ritchie designing Pulp Fiction. I think it's going to be a CGC game,

[02:44] Chicago Gaming Company, the worst public relations communication company in all of Pinball. They're

[02:51] backlogged on Cactus Canyon remake. But even so, I am here to tell you that I think this game is

[02:57] going to be at TPF. And it is shaping up to be one of the craziest TPFs in a long time. I think we're

[03:04] going to see a new game from Stern. I think we're going to have a New Jersey Jack game at TPF. We're

[03:09] going to have Godfather. We know we're going to have Scooby-Doo there. And now I think we're going

[03:13] to have Pulp Fiction. And I also think we're going to get another surprise game at the show. We're

[03:19] also going to get the American Pinball game at the show also. Like it's just going to be the craziest

[03:25] march in all of Pinball. And we're also going to be there to celebrate the Twippies. And hopefully

[03:31] Canada will have his cargo shorts on with favorite Pinball podcast. You know, because every award

[03:36] on my shelf, like we've earned it. And it's such a fun show to see what all the fans out there vote for

[03:41] and see everybody get up on stage and give their speeches. It's the only Pinball award show in town.

[03:46] So I can't wait to be there. I got to book my flight down to Texas. All right. So let's talk

[03:50] about Scooby Scooby-Doo and what we saw in this like 40 minute gameplay reveal. Now I want to say

[03:57] this. I want to say thank you to Spooky Pinball for staying true to your word that you would show

[04:04] us gameplay in January. Now look, Jack Danger is also going to be streaming this game very, very soon.

[04:12] You know, and Jack is like the master of streaming these games. He knows how to set up the rig the

[04:17] best, but it was great. I mean, we saw everything we needed to see. It's a little dark, the lighting.

[04:21] I'm watching it right now. I have the YouTube video playing. You know, it's not the most beautiful

[04:26] delivery of a video. We've got these sort of like orange or pumpkin colored sort of blocks that they

[04:32] have on the video stream, but they used that space to put words over it because they tell you what's

[04:37] going on in the game. So look, I actually really enjoyed watching this video. I watched it from

[04:44] beginning to end from a pure piece of marketing content. You had Bug, DJ and Luke, and there was

[04:50] a fourth gentleman. I think maybe it was the other Spooky Luke, but the whole thing is these four guys

[04:56] really look like they were having a lot of fun. They've got a lot of passion and you know, that

[05:01] rubs off on people. You don't want to see like old man Pat Lawler tell you about how this is the most

[05:07] innovative thing in pinball because it's not. You want to see the youth. You want to see the energy.

[05:13] You want to see the enthusiasm because I think that rubs off on everybody and it just makes you feel

[05:19] good about supporting this company. And I will say we don't see this level of transparency from most

[05:27] pinball companies. And I want to just say to Spooky, thank you for being you and thank you for

[05:33] being personal and thank you for sharing with us your passion on this machine. I think it goes

[05:40] a really long way. Alright, so what do I think about the game? So the biggest thing we've all

[05:44] been wondering is what was the code going to be like on Scooby-Doo? Was it going to be another

[05:50] like day one nightmare like Halloween and Ultraman? And I think everybody who saw this stream was like,

[05:56] my gosh, they really put a lot into this game and it already has a ton in it. And I was super

[06:03] impressed by how they're using the assets. I was super impressed with the design decision on the

[06:09] code of the game. I love the fact that you get to pick between the five different characters in the

[06:15] Scooby-Doo world. I even more love the fact that when you select a character, the callouts for your

[06:22] gameplay experience are from that character. I haven't seen another game do this since I've

[06:28] been covering pinball. And that is why there's going to be like 4,000 custom callouts, because

[06:33] you basically have to do the game five different ways with five different characters. And that is

[06:40] called giving you great bang for your buck, great variety. And I think it's super fun too that it's

[06:46] a five player game. You know, as I was watching them play this game, and I started to see like

[06:52] how the game was developing, how you start mysteries and how you sort of progress through

[06:56] the modes. And I'm not going to go into everything in detail, but I want to cover this game in some

[07:00] broad strokes. I love the assets. I love we get to see so much of the cartoon on the screen.

[07:06] And I love the simplicity though of this game. I think that's the thing that impressed me the most

[07:11] is finally a pinball machine you can walk up to and actually know what you're doing.

[07:18] Finally, a pinball machine that uses the lights and the arrows to tell you where you need to shoot.

[07:24] And the creativity in some of these modes really came through. There was one of them where you're

[07:29] in a museum, and you have to paint the walls or something, and you have to dip your paintbrush

[07:34] in red paint, and then you have to cover the white walls. And then you see the way they use the

[07:39] inserts and one insert will turn red. And that's you dipping your paintbrush into the red paint.

[07:44] And then you got to shoot the white inserts after that. Super, super smart. I think a lot of us out

[07:50] there have been longing for games that have this level of sort of creativity baked into it. And

[07:57] you don't need something to be complex to make it deep and creative, right? You can still make it

[08:04] hard. Because a pinball machine should be about having to hit a series of shots in a row. It

[08:09] shouldn't be hard to understand what you're doing. Hello, games like Avengers. We're still to this

[08:15] day. Most people don't even know how to play the game. It should be about designing creative ways to

[08:21] get through the modes. And the mode should be so inspired by what's going on with the theme itself.

[08:28] And I think what happens with a lot of these other pinball designers, I'm just going to say it,

[08:32] you get too many tournament guys designing the rulesets for the game. And what they think is

[08:38] creative is a creative way to get to a high score. They're not thinking about the creativity of the

[08:45] experience and creating pinball moments. And that's what I see with Scooby-Doo. I don't really care

[08:50] how to score high yet. Like what's fun about pinball should not be figuring out how to just get a

[08:56] high score or get multipliers. What should be fun about pinball is making your way through the modes.

[09:01] And when you get through the modes in a creative way, then you should have a high score. It doesn't

[09:07] seem like it should be that hard. Like I almost would remove all multipliers and all of the stacking

[09:12] and all of that stuff and just force the designers to make the modes themselves the pathway to high

[09:18] scores. Okay, so let's go into the gameplay itself. It's a fan layout and it definitely looks like

[09:24] Spooky's most friendly game to date. It has the monster upper playfield with Cutler with his

[09:30] undersea mask on and you got to bash him and the arms are like magnetic. And then it's got that

[09:36] really, really creative upper left flipper, which I can't stop talking about that level of creativity

[09:43] because that upper left flipper can act as a normal flipper. You could actually fire the ball like

[09:49] slingshot it off the top of that flipper. And then you can also open the flipper up to change the

[09:54] pathway of the ball. So it acts as a diverter at the same time. This thing does like three or four

[10:00] things just thinking creatively about a normal pinball thing like a flipper. And that's the

[10:07] level of creativity I really want to see from more pinball companies as we move forward. Like you

[10:12] don't always have to engineer the most complex thing. You can sometimes take a simple thing and

[10:18] just think about it differently to insert creativity into your design. Now that being said, I want to

[10:25] say like some good with the bad. The one thing missing from this game and I'm not here to be like

[10:29] shill for Scooby-Doo or Spooky Pinball. I'm not buying the game by the way. I can't wait to play it,

[10:34] but I'm still not buying one. And it's nothing against the game itself. I don't have room and

[10:37] I'm basically running out of money after I bought a twenty five thousand dollar Batman SLE. I know

[10:42] I'm crazy. But the thing about this game is when you look at it, there's no major mech in the game.

[10:48] Like there isn't like a major toy in the game either. Like there's no Godzilla building here.

[10:53] There's no T-Rex that eats the ball. There's no Elvira house. And so Spooky Pinball, the last thing

[11:00] they really need to figure out is how to in-house really engineer a modern pinball toy where you

[11:08] could put it next to stuff at Stern or Balli Williams or JJP and you can see the real engineering

[11:15] ability of the company because it's still a lot of off the shelf parts going into these kinds of

[11:21] games. Now that being said, you're getting a lot for your money in this game. You're getting this

[11:25] wide body game, this huge upper play field. You're getting great theme integration. You're

[11:30] getting great music, great light show by the way. I mean this light show in this game super, super

[11:35] good. The other thing I loved about the code was like the meters, right? You've got these easy to

[11:41] read meters when you go into a mode. And I love stuff like that, like your oxygen meter, your fear

[11:47] meter, and you've got like the countdown and the timed modes. I think that's another great way to

[11:53] make a machine fun is having these modes that are timed. Like there's some urgency to hitting the

[11:58] shots. Like you don't always have to make the shots hard to hit, but if you have to hit them in the

[12:03] right order in 30 seconds, all of a sudden you've made the game more challenging and fun without

[12:09] making the actual geometry frustrating. And I'm just gonna say it, shooting a game like Rick

[12:15] and Morty is no fun. Shooting a game like Ghostbusters, I never found that much fun. So I think

[12:21] this game is gonna be much more fun to shoot. Now here is the biggest question mark around this game.

[12:27] Is this game too easy? And there's no way around this debate. They played this game for 15 minutes

[12:35] and didn't have a single out lane drain. Now look, that's gonna make some people really nervous because

[12:43] long ball times in pinball, especially on a game that's a five player game, can you imagine

[12:49] if five good pinball players walk up to this machine? It feels like they might be on it for

[12:55] three hours. Like when Jack Danger starts playing this machine, because I noticed when the spooky

[13:00] crew was playing it, they weren't really nudging the machine and they still were not draining anywhere

[13:05] near on the out lanes. And not only that, you've got the post that pops up between the flippers,

[13:10] which makes it even easier. Now some of this stuff, they can make harder with the software,

[13:15] but I'm a little worried that you good players out there are gonna have monster ball times on this

[13:21] game. I mean, it's a fan layout, which means you guys are gonna have no trouble hitting the shots

[13:25] over and over and over again. There's not much left to right action in the game. There's no

[13:30] pop bumpers in the game. Like there's not a lot of randomness that throws the ball into the out

[13:36] lanes. And I think you're gonna see a lot of up to down fan layout shooting. And that's gonna equal

[13:42] really long ball times. Now look, there's also something that nobody really wants to talk about

[13:46] is that most of you probably are not that good at pinball. And a lot of pinball collectors are

[13:51] not that good. And they actually enjoy longer ball times. But I think for some of these personalities

[13:56] who stream pinball, who are really good at pinball, you're gonna see some streams probably indict

[14:02] this machine for being way too easy. And that's just going to be an individual thing. Like do you

[14:07] want a machine in your home that has long ball times? The other thing I thought when I saw this

[14:12] game was this is the perfect game for a family. And I really mean that. Like if you want a pinball

[14:17] machine that your wife can walk up to, your kid can walk up to, and everyone can enjoy the game,

[14:22] everybody can figure out the game, and it's really easy to see what to do. I think Scooby-Doo

[14:28] just wins in spades much more so than Toy Story 4. I don't think Toy Story 4 is the most family-friendly

[14:34] game. I know the theme is, but I still walk up to Toy Story and it's really confusing figuring out

[14:40] what's going on in that game. There's almost too much going on. You know, it's like in a weird way,

[14:45] like JJP always makes their games a little bit confusing. Like there needs to be like a handbook

[14:50] you have to study before you really understand how to play the game. But this game just looks like

[14:54] so much easier to follow what's going on with the game. The other issue I saw when I was watching it

[14:59] was the left side, like those drop targets, didn't really seem to play that much of an

[15:06] important role in the gameplay itself. And then the ball is up on that upper play field a lot,

[15:12] and the play up there is pretty slow and sluggish. So I'm just curious, right? I haven't played the

[15:18] game nobody has. I'm just curious if you have this game, and you play this game like 300 times,

[15:26] is it going to get monotonous? Are the long ball times going to eat away at you? I don't know yet.

[15:32] It's still after the 40 minutes, I still feel this way. I still feel like we need to play these

[15:38] things. The days of buying these machines and going all in before we get a chance to flip it,

[15:45] I still think it's a gamble. Do I think this video is going to help them sell some of those

[15:50] outstanding spots? Absolutely it will. Like this is the kind of gameplay video that gets you sales,

[15:57] right? The passion, the enthusiasm, and if you're a Scooby-Doo fanatic, I don't know how you watch

[16:03] this and don't want one. You know, we're living in crazy pinball times right now, where like a $10,000

[16:09] spooky pinball machine seems like great value and a bargain. And it is basically in a world in which

[16:15] everyone else is now testing $15,000 for their collector's editions and LEs. And now we've got

[16:22] this sort of $20,000 James Bond. I mean that's what's really embarrassing is that Stern thinks that

[16:27] James Bond machine is worth twice as much as this Scooby-Doo. This Scooby-Doo, I will say this,

[16:32] after watching this stream, it's made all of the streams of James Bond seem like a snooze fest.

[16:40] James Bond to me has never been shown to us in a way that delivers any enthusiasm or passion

[16:47] whatsoever. Even when George Gomez talks about it, it's like all they can talk about is what's

[16:52] going to come, what they're thinking about putting in the machine, and how difficult it was to work

[16:57] with a license holder. That's not what I want to hear. I don't want to hear that for $13,000.

[17:02] All of your troubles. I want you to show a game with so much stuff in it that I feel compelled

[17:08] to give you $13,000. And I think that's the difference between this launch and James Bond.

[17:14] And I think if you're in on this game, you're feeling really pumped. And I think if you're

[17:18] in on James Bond, you have to be a little bit nervous. Like I don't think that game's going to

[17:23] get to the level people think it is. And I also think we're going to start to see more and more

[17:27] of these bonds go up for sale as people become impatient waiting for this like game to be done

[17:33] a year from now. There's much more in Scooby-Doo on day one than is in James Bond on day one.

[17:39] There's much more laughter happening over at Spooky Pinball than there is over at Stern Pinball.

[17:44] I mean, people are basically laughing at Stern with this James Bond 60th. Scooby-Doo and the

[17:51] Spooky Crew, they're laughing because they're having fun playing pinball. And that's my ultimate

[17:56] takeaway from the stream, ladies and gentlemen, is this is the point of pinball. We should get

[18:01] excited. We should want a game. It should be a theme that makes us smile. It should be gameplay

[18:06] that makes us happy. It should leave us feeling happier than when we went into the game itself.

[18:12] And I think there's a lot in this Scooby-Doo game that is making a lot of people smile. And I think

[18:18] if you're in on one, I think you're going to enjoy it. We don't know if this game yet is going to have

[18:22] that longevity, right? Because of those long balltimes. But we're all going to get a chance to play it.

[18:28] And that's the other good thing. If you're not in on this game yet, you are going to have multiple

[18:33] opportunities to play this game over the next few months. And it's never going to be hard to get one.

[18:39] Remember, it's still going to take Spooky Pinball about 18 months to make all 1969 games. And trust

[18:47] me, not all are spoken for. Spots will open up. And there's a lot of pinball coming, right? Some

[18:54] people might be in on this with a deposit. Then they're going to see Venom. Then they're going to

[18:59] see Pulp Fiction. Then they're going to see Galactic Space Force. Then they're going to see, like,

[19:03] I don't know, there might be a Twilight Zone remix coming out, right? All this stuff is coming out.

[19:08] I mean, remake, not remix, remake. So this is all going to start happening at the same time. We're

[19:14] heading into a global recession. So trust me, you're not going to have a hard time getting anything.

[19:21] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club. I love doing the show.

[19:25] I'm going to keep doing the show. And we are growing at a pace I never thought imaginable.

[19:30] And it's all because of you. I'll be back with more shows this week. Canada out.
