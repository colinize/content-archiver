[00:00] You can go, oh bad night.

[00:03] This is basically, can I come over after school?

[00:08] Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:10] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:15] Welcome to episode 330 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast with two

[00:22] lower play fields.

[00:23] I'm coming at you from a windy Miami today.

[00:26] I love this city.

[00:27] It's awesome.

[00:28] The way people dress.

[00:29] Wow, everyone's working for the money that way they're dressing.

[00:32] Okay, so here's the deal.

[00:33] We're going to talk on this episode a lot about Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:37] We are two weeks away from Willy Wonka, it seems.

[00:40] And that's what everyone is saying.

[00:42] It's going to be at the Midwest gaming class.

[00:43] It gets crazy.

[00:44] It's a little over two weeks away.

[00:46] Wow, wow.

[00:47] There's so much going on in Pinball, all of a sudden.

[00:50] We went from no news to tons of news.

[00:52] But here's what I'm going to do on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:55] We're going to talk about a little news.

[00:56] Then we're going to talk a lot about J.J.P.

[00:58] Then I'm going to read some of your notes and then I'm going to let you have your day

[01:01] back.

[01:02] How does that sound?

[01:03] All right, first and foremost, let's talk about Stern Pinball.

[01:06] So obviously we've got the big news about Steve Richie's new game.

[01:10] A lot of excitement.

[01:11] Everyone's sort of wondering how this game is going to flip.

[01:14] Swords of rage.

[01:15] It's kind of cool.

[01:16] It's Steve Richie's initials if you take out the U of, right?

[01:19] Pretty neat to do notice that.

[01:21] So look, there's nothing really left until we play the game now.

[01:25] It's one of those points now where there's no point in beating it to death.

[01:29] The question I have is, will the LEDs of this game sell out?

[01:32] Now, I'm hearing it's selling pretty well with distributors.

[01:35] So I'm pretty confident that all 600 of these LED machines will be spoken for by the time

[01:42] they hit the line.

[01:43] What do you think?

[01:44] CanadianPinball at gmail.com will all 600 be sold out.

[01:48] I do think this game is going to be one of the better games Stern puts out in recent

[01:52] memory because it has some originality.

[01:55] It has a new mechanism.

[01:57] And if you're a pinball fanatic who grew up loving pinball, you know the Black Knight

[02:02] series.

[02:03] So there's some prominence there.

[02:05] This game will not have the same sort of hype when it hits distributor showrooms though

[02:10] because remember, if you don't know pinball, I think you're going to have a hard time walking

[02:15] up to this and being like, wow, I need to own that as if it was like a Star Wars or Batman

[02:19] or Game of Thrones or Deadpool.

[02:22] It just doesn't have that level of following.

[02:24] There aren't millions of people that are into the Black Knight.

[02:27] There are a few thousand people that are really into it.

[02:31] But that's all Stern really needs, right?

[02:33] Is Stern just needs to have like 5,000 people who really want this game and it will be a

[02:37] success for them.

[02:38] All right, what else is going on?

[02:40] So there is new Batman code coming.

[02:43] I heard that from Lyman.

[02:44] He's working on new code.

[02:46] That's exciting.

[02:47] This game is pretty much already amazing.

[02:49] So I'm hoping that we get a third season for all the major villains.

[02:55] I also wish, and I don't know what the issue is with the villain vision, but I hope that

[02:59] gets implemented into the game a little bit more.

[03:01] I hope there are a few more light shows we get.

[03:03] I hope the crane comes out to play with us a little bit more than it does currently.

[03:08] But that's exciting new Batman code coming.

[03:10] Now here's the other rumor I'm hearing.

[03:12] Are you sitting down?

[03:13] Is everyone got their tattoo guns ready?

[03:16] The rumor I am hearing is that there will be another Batman premium that is going to

[03:23] come out into the world, right?

[03:25] It's going to be a new version of the game.

[03:28] That is exciting as well because now that the code is incredible and Stern wants to drum

[03:33] up new interest, it sort of makes sense that this rumor might be true, that we're going

[03:37] to get a new Batman premium.

[03:40] Something, you know, so we've seen them do it before.

[03:42] We've seen them do it with like ACDC and they have another premium run with maybe a different

[03:47] art package.

[03:48] So we'll see if more to that rumor comes out sometime soon.

[03:51] All right, what else is happening?

[03:53] So what's crazy, right?

[03:54] We talk about the cadence.

[03:55] We're going to talk about that on this podcast where it's like non-stop new pins are coming

[03:59] out.

[04:00] The saturation of the industry is upon us because you know, look, we're in April next

[04:05] week.

[04:06] Okay?

[04:07] And we're going to have the new black night game.

[04:08] And then in June, July, we're going to get Brian Eddie's Jurassic World.

[04:13] And then in the fall, we're also going to get Elvira 3.

[04:17] Now here's the rumor I'm hearing about Elvira 3.

[04:20] I'm hearing that Dennis Norman is the designer of the game that Stern is making Dennis live

[04:26] up to his contractual obligations to finish the game and work on the game, which is kind

[04:31] of freaking nuts that this guy is over at deep root and he's also going to have a hit game

[04:36] coming out from Stern in the fall.

[04:39] And will we see deep root by the fall?

[04:41] And also we know that Lyman Sheets is the art, sorry, the coder of Elvira 3.

[04:47] So that's going to be a huge launch for Stern.

[04:50] I thought Elvira was kind of irrelevant and not popular.

[04:54] And then when Cassandra was at Tpf two years ago, the line was around the block.

[04:58] So I'm wrong.

[04:59] I'm wrong.

[05:00] There is a lot of excitement for Elvira.

[05:02] All right.

[05:03] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[05:05] So here is what gave rise to a lot of the alien rumors.

[05:08] And there's something going on behind the scenes here.

[05:11] Somebody is making alien parts.

[05:14] If you go over to pinball life and you search for alien pinball parts, why all of a sudden

[05:21] are there a ton of alien parts for sale through pinball life?

[05:26] Ask yourself that question.

[05:27] I mean, we've got everything from the beacon toppers to the alien eggs, to the face huggers,

[05:33] to the LED boards that are now available.

[05:35] There's coils that are available.

[05:37] There's artwork, plastic sets, interior plastic sets.

[05:41] There's power supply.

[05:43] There's board sets available.

[05:45] So where are all these parts coming from?

[05:47] And that is the rumor that I am hearing is that alien is being remade.

[05:53] Now the other, now the new thing I'm hearing is that this game is actually going to be made

[05:56] overseas and there's 300 more of them being put together.

[06:00] I don't know anymore.

[06:01] I really don't know.

[06:03] I do know that pinball brothers has clearly not stopped manufacturing things around alien

[06:09] because just go to pinball life and look at all those parts.

[06:12] All right.

[06:13] We'll see if it comes out.

[06:14] We'll see if that rumor is true.

[06:15] Get your tattoo guns ready.

[06:17] People, all right.

[06:18] So before I jump into JJP, I want to ask all you guys a question out there.

[06:24] And I think you know the answer.

[06:25] You think it's basically this.

[06:28] How are all these pinball games going to succeed in 2019, all right?

[06:31] But even without deep root, let me go down a list real quick for all of you.

[06:35] These are all of the games that just currently right now are looking for buyers.

[06:39] These are all the companies that have new and box machines, nice, beautiful cardboard boxes

[06:44] that can arrive in your home and you could set up your game.

[06:47] Ready?

[06:48] Let's go down the list right now with stuff that is asking for dollars.

[06:50] So, and this is not even everything.

[06:52] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[06:55] Batman 66 Pro.

[06:57] Batman 66 Premium.

[06:59] Beatles Gold.

[07:00] Beatles Platinum.

[07:01] Beatles Diamond.

[07:02] Black Knight Pro.

[07:04] Black Knight Premium.

[07:06] Black Knight Ellie.

[07:07] Cosmic Carnival.

[07:09] Deadpool Pro.

[07:10] Deadpool Premium.

[07:11] Deadpool Ellie.

[07:12] Monster Bash.

[07:13] Remake Classic.

[07:14] Monster Bash Remake Special.

[07:16] Monster Bash Remake Limited.

[07:17] Monsters Pro.

[07:18] Monsters Premium.

[07:19] Monsters Ellie.

[07:19] Multimorphic.

[07:20] October Fest.

[07:21] Pirate to the Caribbean.

[07:23] Standard.

[07:23] Pirate to the Caribbean.

[07:24] Ellie.

[07:24] Pirate to the Caribbean.

[07:25] Collectives Edition.

[07:26] And Waz.

[07:27] The Yellow Brick Road.

[07:28] Let's count that list.

[07:29] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25.

[07:41] I think it's 25 games.

[07:42] 25 pinball machines.

[07:45] In boxes, online's right now trying to get your dollars.

[07:49] That is insane.

[07:51] We are clearly oversaturated.

[07:53] Hey, hey, put Deadpool, and that's not dead.

[07:56] We'll put deep root into the mix now.

[07:58] With their promise of making the most games in one year ever in the pinball industry.

[08:03] And all of a sudden you start to realize, wow, as a buyer, I love this.

[08:08] We have so many options.

[08:10] But doesn't it also create buyer's anxiety?

[08:13] Like where do I spend my money?

[08:15] What should I go in on?

[08:16] Or should I just wait?

[08:17] Right?

[08:18] Because Jurassic World is also coming.

[08:19] You know, a buyer and Willy Wonka and Toy Story and Guns and Roses and Deeproot.

[08:24] And who knows is, you know, cactus Canyon next and this and that.

[08:27] This is really, really shaping up to be way more supply than there is demand.

[08:33] Now demand is strong.

[08:35] It definitely is.

[08:36] It is stronger now that it's ever been before.

[08:38] I have talked to more collectors who want to go in on stuff.

[08:41] I mean, I talked to a guy, a good friend of the show, who actually just tried to go buy

[08:46] the big Lebowski pinball machine for $25,000 new in box and guess what happened?

[08:51] He was told it sold already.

[08:53] Oh, my God.

[08:54] Right?

[08:55] So there's a lot of very new to the hobby people.

[08:57] Not everyone's new, but there's a lot of new collectors that are coming into pinball

[08:59] now every month with big checkbooks.

[09:02] The economy has been great for a really long time.

[09:06] So I think it's an amazing time.

[09:08] I think it's an oversaturated time.

[09:10] But I'm not complaining.

[09:11] I am not complaining.

[09:13] It is awesome to watch what is happening.

[09:16] I mean, it is a battle with Stern on the top of the mountain and everyone is trying

[09:21] to get up to where they're at.

[09:22] Now they are still the most formidable pinball company I've ever seen.

[09:27] They're winning this battle.

[09:29] Don't be fooled.

[09:30] Yes, there are some companies chipping away.

[09:32] Primarily, the only one really chipping away at Stern is Chicago gaming company.

[09:37] Everybody else is not.

[09:38] Nobody else is really making a dent on Stern's black castle.

[09:42] That's at the top of that mountain.

[09:43] And they have so much coming.

[09:45] They've got a Tyrannosaurus Rex up there that's waiting to charge at the enemies.

[09:50] They've got a skeleton army, right?

[09:52] They've got a Elvira up there showing you her great cleavage.

[09:56] You know, they've got so much happening that I don't see anybody really taking them down.

[10:02] Now Will Jersey Jack be the company to finally wake up a little bit and dent Stern's market

[10:07] share.

[10:08] We'll see.

[10:09] But it's crazy.

[10:10] It is crazy.

[10:11] There are going to be and mark my words.

[10:13] There's going to be winners and losers.

[10:15] There's no way that this battle can continue like this with all these companies.

[10:19] And I think the one that's going to struggle a lot.

[10:21] And I've said this before and I don't mean to be a jerk.

[10:24] It's going to be really hard for some of the newer companies to survive if their titles

[10:29] don't really break through in a magical way, right?

[10:32] It's not how, I mean, how much harder is it now coming out of T.P.F.

[10:37] How much harder is it now to sell October fest with Steve Richie's black night game being

[10:42] announced right after you had a good showing at T.P.F.

[10:45] And also how hard is it now where the next place October fest is going to go to get people

[10:51] excited is MGC and black night is going to be there and be flippable.

[10:56] And then all of a sudden we're hearing Willie Wank is going to be there.

[10:59] So there really hasn't been a window in which October fest is available without a lot of

[11:05] competition.

[11:06] And then that's what Stern does.

[11:08] That's what all this sort of saturation of the market does is it's never a good time

[11:13] to release a game anymore, right?

[11:15] But it is a good time to make a game amazing that can succeed in this marketplace.

[11:19] And I've said it, there's no room for mediocrity anymore.

[11:22] Your game is either amazing or it's not going to sell well.

[11:26] And that's just where we're at.

[11:27] And I think consumers are going to look at these games now.

[11:30] And they are going to expect a game to check every single box.

[11:34] It has to have good animations.

[11:35] It has to have good art.

[11:36] It has to have a good theme.

[11:37] It has to shoot well.

[11:39] It has to have code that is worthwhile of owning.

[11:42] There's a lot of stuff.

[11:43] But for the most part, to get that initial sale, I think you're going to need theme,

[11:47] artwork, and layout has to be like stellar.

[11:50] Like it has to be, okay?

[11:52] That is where the battle is won on day one of the battle.

[11:55] The battle is won.

[11:57] The long battle is won on the coding of the game.

[11:59] We all know that.

[12:00] That's what makes people either want to keep a game for a long time or get rid of it.

[12:03] All right.

[12:04] Let's talk about Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[12:06] All right.

[12:07] So here's the thing.

[12:08] There was an interesting thread.

[12:09] I need to read it.

[12:10] It's from our friend Iceman 44.

[12:11] And the title is My Current Take on Jersey Jack Pimbal after T.P.F.

[12:16] I want to read his points and I want to discuss because I think this is interesting.

[12:20] I think it's seven pages worth of discussion is always a decent thread.

[12:25] All right.

[12:26] So his take is this.

[12:27] The reveal about was, because this is the reveal about Yelpick Road.

[12:30] The reveal was 100% about raising money to put down on getting wonkas started.

[12:36] Do the math 200 games times 11k is over, you know, it's over $2 million.

[12:41] The investors said go raise the upfront money yourself.

[12:46] Hence the Yelpick Road disaster and joke.

[12:48] All right.

[12:49] So what Iceman is saying here and let's talk about this is that the angel investors

[12:54] at Jersey Jack Pimbal are tired of losing money.

[12:57] They are tired of always having to front the money for the parts for the next game.

[13:02] They wanted Jack to go raise that capital in some other way.

[13:06] And so he is saying that that is what the Yelpick Road decision was.

[13:10] To raise the money to buy the parts to make wonka.

[13:14] I'm not sure that's the case and I'll tell you why.

[13:17] Maybe they just need to like, you know, maybe that was to buffer the losses

[13:21] from the pirates of the Caribbean delay.

[13:23] But here's why I don't think that was the case.

[13:25] To get the parts to make Willy Wonka and we're hearing that Willy Wonka is going to be

[13:29] on the line within a month of being shown at MGC.

[13:33] You would have to have ordered those parts a long time ago, much longer than, you know,

[13:39] than a month or two.

[13:41] I mean, I'm talking like three to four, maybe five months in advance.

[13:44] You need to start getting parts ordered for a new game.

[13:47] So I'm not sure that's the case.

[13:48] Ice, but I definitely think that the decision to put Yelpick Road out into the world

[13:55] was a decision to raise capital and that the investors are starting to get a little weary.

[14:00] All right.

[14:01] And now, so then the question becomes this, do we think that Jersey Jack Pimbal is once again in trouble?

[14:07] Right.

[14:08] Does this move sort of speak of a desperate act of a company that is still always, you

[14:15] know, one day away from the investor saying, I'm done with this and just closing up doors.

[14:20] Like how close is Jersey Jack Pimbal to being like on the brink of disaster?

[14:26] I don't know.

[14:27] I just don't know.

[14:29] I hope not.

[14:30] I mean, we all hope not.

[14:32] Nobody wants to see Jersey Jack Pimbal go under.

[14:35] I can't help but shake this feeling when I see them sometimes that there's this vibe

[14:39] that all is not good back at the home for that things are really dire and they need money

[14:48] badly and to get that money, they need to sell a lot more of these games.

[14:52] The delay of Pirates of the Caribbean was another financially crippling thing.

[14:59] It just was.

[15:00] Okay.

[15:01] So then the next point that Ice Man says is this, Jack actually says,

[15:04] that we do more than 200 later, but it won't be more than, okay.

[15:09] So then he said number three, Jack had destroyed the collectibility of any JJP game.

[15:15] Number four, the rush to buy Pirates of the Caribbean late is total manufactured bullshit.

[15:21] Sales were crap until there was last call announcement.

[15:24] Again, hey guys, I've got a few pins outside and the trunk, let me show them to you.

[15:29] Point number five, after TpF, like everyone else with JJP to extract every dime possible

[15:35] there will be a black pearl edition coming next year.

[15:38] How do we know this?

[15:40] LOL.

[15:41] Okay, so let's talk a little bit about all these things together.

[15:43] So let's talk about we, you know, Jack and collectibility and limited editions.

[15:47] We've talked about that before.

[15:49] There is nothing sacred in JJP land when it comes to limited.

[15:52] The big thing here is, will he rerun Pirates and why was Pirates stopped?

[15:57] You know, there's a lot of back and forth in this.

[15:59] The true answer to this is, I don't think, you know, the Pirates sales were not great.

[16:04] Out of the gate, there is no denying that.

[16:07] People need to stop thinking that this is the greatest game of all time and that people

[16:11] just need to understand that because the truth is in the sales of the game, like the numbers

[16:17] don't lie, the money doesn't lie.

[16:19] When Pirates of the Caribbean was available, it was not flying off of the shelf the way

[16:24] the owners think it was.

[16:26] The owners enjoy it, the owners love it.

[16:28] They never stopped talking about how, how many issues they've had with the game and

[16:32] they never stopped talking about how great the game is once it's playing functionally properly.

[16:37] Okay, but that doesn't change the fact that Stern will have sold more deadpools than Pirates

[16:43] of the Caribbean.

[16:44] Stern will outsell it with monsters.

[16:45] Stern will outsell it with Steve Richie's game.

[16:47] You know what I'm saying?

[16:48] It's like, yes, and in total, they will only have made 1,000 Pirates of the Caribbean.

[16:53] Now that's a total sales failure.

[16:56] And I didn't stop production of the game.

[16:59] The fans didn't stop production of the game.

[17:00] The Jersey Jack Pimbal is who stopped production of the game.

[17:04] And so you can't tell me that they would have stopped production of this game if orders

[17:09] for it were flying in.

[17:11] If distributors were like, I need 50 more, I need 100 more, I need this many more.

[17:15] You think they would have stopped production of this game?

[17:17] Absolutely not.

[17:18] So the orders clearly weren't there.

[17:20] And I think we need to put a pin in that discussion and just accept that as the fact.

[17:25] Now, will he make another run of this game?

[17:27] Will there be a Black Pearl edition?

[17:29] I've been saying that since day one, Black Pearl makes so much more sense than a, you know,

[17:34] the squid phase guy, David Jones, they should have made a Black Pearl from the very beginning.

[17:38] The top of his Black Pearl would be a nicer art package.

[17:41] It'd be really cool.

[17:42] The main, you know, the main toy in the game is the Black Pearl.

[17:45] I don't, you know, like Jack always does this.

[17:48] He always finds a new way to make another version of the game.

[17:51] So I think that's a pretty good guess that that's going to happen.

[17:54] All right.

[17:55] The iceman goes on to say that Disney wouldn't really care that they didn't sell many.

[18:01] It's a dead franchise, whatever, whatever.

[18:03] And Toy Story is next.

[18:04] So the bottom line, he says, Jack lies when the truth would sound better.

[18:09] And now I'm probably going to roll over my money from Pirates of the Care being collector's

[18:13] edition because once again, it's delayed.

[18:15] And in Jack's style, we know it's coming again with a Reeskin version, Black Pearl.

[18:19] All right.

[18:20] So that's the other thing too is the question of have the collector's editions sold out

[18:25] of Jersey Jack, Pimball Machines for Pirates.

[18:28] And look, here's the deal.

[18:30] They're probably sold through to distributors, but not everyone is sold.

[18:33] I could wake up today and go buy a collector's edition.

[18:36] They are available.

[18:37] Don't fool yourselves.

[18:38] They're not sold out at $12,500.

[18:40] These games are still available.

[18:42] And now I'm hearing if you order a collector's edition to a distributor that already purchased

[18:47] one, it doesn't mean they have it in box.

[18:50] They are still waiting for them all to be manufactured.

[18:53] And now there's a delay.

[18:54] So what does that mean?

[18:56] It doesn't mean it's coming out in a week or two weeks or doesn't mean that they have

[19:00] to order more parts.

[19:01] So there might be some collector's editions that are waiting for a while.

[19:05] And to Ice's point, it might be a Black Pearl collector's edition that replaces the

[19:10] Davy Jones one.

[19:11] So all of this, a couple, all of this with the fact that in two weeks, we're seeing Willy

[19:16] Wonka.

[19:18] And it's going to happen.

[19:19] And people are saying that is the time Midwest Gaming Classic.

[19:22] And that it's going to be on the line within a month of being revealed.

[19:26] Are you excited?

[19:27] Are you anxious?

[19:28] What are you?

[19:29] How do you feel about it?

[19:30] It's crazy, right?

[19:31] I mean, all this stuff is happening at once.

[19:33] I tell you honestly, I feel a little overwhelmed with excitement.

[19:37] And I'm a little like, I'm just a little like fatigue a little bit.

[19:41] There's just so much.

[19:42] We used to have a pinball collecting and buying.

[19:45] It used to be something where just a couple times a year we got excited about a new game.

[19:50] And it wasn't like this.

[19:52] Now it feels like Munsters is old news.

[19:55] Willy Wonka in two weeks.

[19:57] Well that makes Steve Richie's game feel a little like old news.

[19:59] It's almost like these things are coming out at the pace of like a new comic book or

[20:04] video game.

[20:05] Right?

[20:06] You know how like when all the video games come out in fourth quarter and there's just so

[20:09] many options, but they're 50 to 60 dollars.

[20:11] I think what's really hard for me is to keep getting excited and getting again and again.

[20:16] When these things are like five to fifteen thousand dollar toys and there are a lot of money.

[20:22] And you do want your new purchase to have a little bit more of a sustainable hype and

[20:26] conversation around it.

[20:28] I mean that's the other part.

[20:30] We used to get a game and we used to be able to talk about that game deconstructed.

[20:35] It used to be like a game or two all year round that we talked about that we got up for

[20:41] every morning and we couldn't wait to play.

[20:43] And now it's like we're so on to the next and there's so much available that the window

[20:50] in which things are even relevant is so much shorter now that it's hard to really really

[20:57] really feel like I don't know for me.

[21:00] It's like I don't really feel like I need to go in on any of these games anytime quickly.

[21:05] And it's just like I just like standing on the sidelines because like why not just wait

[21:09] to see how it all shakes out.

[21:11] Like even even waking up today and you say like what are you going to buy?

[21:14] Like how do you wake up today and go buy like October fest when you can just wait four

[21:18] weeks.

[21:19] You just wait four to six weeks and you don't buy October fest today.

[21:23] You'll still be able to buy October fest.

[21:25] You'll then know what Willy Wonka is.

[21:27] You'll then know what black knight is.

[21:29] You'll then and then here's a thing but in six weeks you'll then start to be like well

[21:34] what what's Jurassic World going to be like?

[21:36] Brian Eddie made medieval madness like probably the best game of all time.

[21:41] So what's Jurassic World going to be and then what's deep root going to do and then his

[21:45] cactus Canyon X and then his kingpin being remade and hey maybe aliens even going to

[21:49] survive back into the pinball world.

[21:51] You see what I'm saying?

[21:52] It's like it's almost like it's a great time to be a buyer but it's like never a good

[21:57] time to feel like well this is the time I really need to go in on it because the other

[22:02] thing that is absolutely going to happen.

[22:05] Absolutely positively going to happen is prices of these games are going to go down quickly

[22:12] after they're out.

[22:14] But there's no other way.

[22:15] I mean you're going to start buying games for $10,000, $11,000 and then how much is it going

[22:21] to be used in a year when the next one comes out?

[22:23] Because here's the thing that I'm most curious about with Willy Wonka.

[22:27] Besides seeing what Pat Lawler has done with this theme, I'm so curious to see what the

[22:32] price is on Willy Wonka because I think the price for Jersey Jack games is going to go

[22:38] up again.

[22:39] It has to.

[22:41] This Jersey Jack is Stern's best friend in getting more for their games.

[22:46] Without Jersey Jack, Stern would be nowhere near $9,000 and $7,500 for machines.

[22:52] But Jack kept showing them that the market was there.

[22:55] But Jack couldn't deliver the games though.

[22:58] It's crazy.

[22:59] But I think Willy Wonka limited edition.

[23:02] I think it's going to be $10,000.

[23:05] And I think the collector's edition is going to be more than $12,500.

[23:10] I actually see Jack should just take a page from Stern.

[23:14] I think Jack needs to stop with all this.

[23:16] Just make limited edition and make premiums and make pros.

[23:21] Like whatever.

[23:22] Just call them what Stern calls them or call them collector's editions, premiums and pros,

[23:28] okay, or standard.

[23:30] Because I think the problem with limited and collector is they both kind of are trying

[23:34] to do the same thing.

[23:35] They're both trying to be the rare game that the collectors are going to buy and are

[23:39] limited at the same time.

[23:41] And I would, I just think that's bad marketing.

[23:43] It's wonky.

[23:44] It's Willy Wonka marketing.

[23:46] He needs to, I think, pick one or the other.

[23:48] And then Jack really has to do something that I think he hasn't figured out yet.

[23:53] I really think Jack is missing how many loaded people are in this hobby that would go in

[24:01] on the special version of the game at a higher price point.

[24:04] Because Jack is making the Bugatti, the Rolls Royce of Pimball compared to Stern he absolutely

[24:09] is.

[24:10] And he is, here's where he falls down.

[24:12] Jack should make 500 Willy Wonka collectors editions for $15,000 each and just watch every

[24:21] one of them sell.

[24:23] It's just that simple.

[24:24] And again, it needs to have a magical top or needs to have a really unique armor.

[24:28] You know, and all he has to do, and this is the part where I just want to take Jack

[24:32] by the neck and be like, Jack, will you just understand how easy it is to do this?

[24:37] Like 500 of those games and give each of those games a mode or a wizard mode that is only

[24:45] available in the collector's edition code.

[24:47] Why don't they do that?

[24:49] I mean, look at Keith.

[24:50] Look at all he put into Pirates of the Caribbean.

[24:52] Like, it's got like more than it needs.

[24:55] Like, couldn't you just simply have a secret mode that is an Easter egg mode that only the

[25:00] collector's edition games had?

[25:02] And then all of a sudden, every single person who bought the collector's edition would

[25:06] feel like their game is special on a level that the Ellie guys don't have.

[25:11] It's not just art.

[25:12] It's also the, when you make the gameplay unique, it makes the owners that much more excited

[25:17] to own the game.

[25:18] Why can't these pinball companies realize that?

[25:21] That it's the code that makes Tron, Ellie and Ellie.

[25:24] It's the code.

[25:26] Silly.

[25:27] Anyone can put the fiber optic ramps on the game, but nobody can code in the Daff Punk

[25:30] Multi-Ball.

[25:32] Only the Ellie guys get that.

[25:33] And that's why that game was selling for double, double the price.

[25:38] And how many years ago was that?

[25:39] And nobody is ever, nobody think about that.

[25:42] Nobody since then has ever given the limited edition or collector's edition games anything

[25:47] unique at all.

[25:49] Other than Adam West with unique call outs in Batman 66.

[25:53] And speaking of, why do you think that game is holding value like a, like a diamond?

[25:59] It is.

[26:00] Games value, even though diamond value is plummet.

[26:04] But that game is holding value like it's a rare work of art.

[26:07] I mean, one, an, an Ellie of Batman just sold recently in Australia.

[26:12] This is Aussie dollars for 26,000 Aussie dollars or Aussie dollars, right?

[26:18] 26,000, which is about 17,500 dollars in US dollars.

[26:22] That's insane.

[26:24] Insane.

[26:25] So what's an SLE worth now with only 80 out in the world?

[26:29] And personalized Adam West call outs in each game.

[26:33] What are they worth?

[26:34] You know, I mean, I have one.

[26:35] I mean, mine's pristine.

[26:36] It's got a play field protector since day one, 20 grand, 25 grand.

[26:41] I don't know.

[26:42] They're kind of onobtainium the SLEs.

[26:44] They're not for sale much.

[26:45] All right.

[26:46] So here's, so that's the thing.

[26:47] It's like Jack, I'm just curious to see what the pricing is.

[26:51] I'm also just curious, is there going to be anything from dialed in that makes its way

[26:55] onto the play field of Willy Wonka?

[26:57] That's the other thing.

[26:59] You can't tell me there are not leftover mechanisms from dialed in because that game was not a barn

[27:05] burner in sales.

[27:06] Are there going to be, is there going to be anything from dialed in that makes its way

[27:11] onto the Wonka play field?

[27:14] Will the beer like a quantum theater that's reskinned or the subway?

[27:17] Will something be reskinned or will it be all original?

[27:22] I don't know.

[27:23] I really don't know.

[27:25] At some point, they're going to have to like do something with those parts, you know,

[27:29] these are going to be another dialed in.

[27:31] See that's Jack's dilemma.

[27:32] When you walk Jersey Jack factory, he's got millions of dollars in parts and what good

[27:39] is that if there are specific parts to games just sitting there in box collecting dust,

[27:46] you know, he's losing money.

[27:47] He's paying rent for the factory.

[27:49] He's got these workers and he's got millions of parts that are not going into games.

[27:52] Like, that's not good.

[27:54] And I think he learned the lesson and now he's trying to get rid of all the parts

[27:58] hence the Yellowbrook Road edition.

[28:00] Now, do you think that game's going to sell?

[28:02] Yellowbrook Road edition.

[28:03] I don't know.

[28:04] I really don't know.

[28:05] We'll see.

[28:06] I do think it will.

[28:07] I'll tell you why because there are again, there are so many rich people out there that

[28:11] wake up tomorrow and they want a cute game.

[28:12] And when you see Wizard of Oz on Facebook and you're a mom and a dad and you're like,

[28:16] oh, we should really get a pinball machine for the home and it's like $11,500.

[28:21] You don't know any better.

[28:23] You don't know what this game is worth.

[28:24] You don't even know about Ruby Red and Emerald City editions.

[28:27] This game is not being marketed to all of you people who are in the know for years.

[28:33] It's going to capture new buyers.

[28:35] And you have to remember, this game can be available globally.

[28:38] So all the rich people in China do buy the Middle East, Latin America, Canada, United

[28:43] States, like Japan.

[28:44] And look, you only have to sell 500 around the world and I think they will find 500 homes

[28:51] for this game, right?

[28:52] Okay.

[28:53] Let's go to some of your emails and then I'm going to go because I got to jump on a

[28:57] work call in 15 minutes.

[28:59] So let's do this.

[29:00] I'm going to pull them up.

[29:01] All right.

[29:02] So I got a lot around the Twippy victories.

[29:04] I can't read them all obviously, but let me go.

[29:07] Do do do do do do do do.

[29:10] Okay.

[29:11] So Twippy's let's start here March 24th.

[29:13] I got an email from Frank.

[29:15] It says congrats on the Twippy's award tonight.

[29:18] Well deserved.

[29:19] This is Frank, Daniel.

[29:20] I think it was hang with Frank and his son Frank.

[29:22] Thank you so much for the note.

[29:23] I got an email from just justus.

[29:26] Hey brother, congrats on another Twippy.

[29:28] I voted for you.

[29:29] Looking dapper as usual, I thought your acceptance speech was very classy.

[29:33] F the haters.

[29:34] Justus.

[29:35] Thank you so much for the note.

[29:37] I got an email from Doug Allen.

[29:39] Congratulations on the win, Chris.

[29:41] Best acceptance speech of all two.

[29:43] Keep up the great work in 2019.

[29:46] Doug and Seattle, pinball, cog or something.

[29:49] Cool.

[29:50] Doug, thank you so much.

[29:51] I got an email from Ben Crane.

[29:53] Ben Chris.

[29:54] If you of us were watching the Twippy award show in rock

[29:56] chester and we're rooting for you to win, I don't agree with all your opinions, but I respect

[30:01] that your voice, your own opinion on the show.

[30:04] You have the most entertaining podcast in the pinball and the award was much deserved.

[30:08] Well, Ben Crane, thank you so much brother for listening.

[30:12] I got an email from Lucas.

[30:14] Congratulations on your well deserved second win.

[30:18] Wish they named and shamed the booer.

[30:20] What a bad sport.

[30:21] Glad you asked them on stage and didn't move.

[30:24] What a, I won't say that word.

[30:26] It wasn't franchy.

[30:27] It wasn't no.

[30:28] It wasn't franchy.

[30:29] Lucas, thank you so much for the note.

[30:30] All right, let's keep going.

[30:31] I got an email from Neil Shelton.

[30:34] Good luck tonight brother.

[30:35] You got this shit in the bag.

[30:37] We'll be shocked if you don't win Neil.

[30:39] Thank you so much for the note.

[30:41] Got an email here from Jason Zimmerman that I still love the show.

[30:46] Nobody's perfect and fuck the haters.

[30:48] Well, Jason Zimmerman, thank you so much for listening.

[30:51] To Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[30:53] I got an email from Jack.

[30:55] This is from Jersey Jack.

[30:57] He said, good morning.

[30:58] This is from Jersey Jack.

[30:59] Good morning from DFW.

[31:00] Nice to see and talk to you.

[31:02] Don't let the guy who booed you take away the fun and smile of winning the Twippy.

[31:07] There will always be those people used to fuel your, use it to fuel your passion.

[31:11] Be well.

[31:12] Jack.

[31:13] All right, that is awesome.

[31:14] I love that Jack sent me that note.

[31:15] That was super awesome.

[31:16] I'm going to go down to Jack and visit him soon and get him back on the show.

[31:19] I'm really excited to help give Jack ideas on moving forward when he does seminars at

[31:25] these pinball shows.

[31:26] All right.

[31:27] Got an email from, let's see, Blade, some J.

[31:30] J says, I love the fact that everyone bashes you and you win two years in a row.

[31:35] You should mimic head to head logo again, but change it back to Canadian's podcast.

[31:39] I've said this before, but your opinions and interviews are the best of all the podcasts.

[31:44] And it seems I'm not alone thinking that.

[31:46] Enjoy the win and promote it to all the haters.

[31:48] J.

[31:49] Well, J, first of all, thank you.

[31:51] No, I don't need to like rub it in anyone else's face.

[31:54] I'm glad that we won.

[31:56] I'm glad for you guys out there that listen, that this show, while people would like it to

[32:01] go away, just won't go away, right?

[32:03] I got an email from Peter.

[32:05] Pete says, Chris, congratulations on the back-to-back Twippy wins for Best Pinball Podcast.

[32:09] While I don't always agree with everything you say, I always listen to your podcast first

[32:14] before anyone else's due to the honesty and the passion you have for this industry.

[32:19] You are spot on with a number of things, especially around today's pins lacking the magic

[32:23] or world in your glass.

[32:24] A perfect example of this is with current Stern pins and other manufacturers relying too

[32:28] much on the LCD screen.

[32:30] Too much emphasis put on the LCD and not enough on newer mechs.

[32:34] A recent pinball gathering I went to at a friend's place really hammered this idea home.

[32:39] The person has an amazing collection of mostly older system 11 pins.

[32:43] Each of those pins has something magical going on on them and you can see experience it

[32:48] within a few minutes of the playing the game.

[32:51] Whether pinbots are opening the visor for the first time or starting in multiple on high

[32:55] speed, those games give you some exciting moments that don't require you to look at the

[32:59] screen.

[33:00] Anyway, keep up the great work looking forward to a full year of new podcasts.

[33:03] Well, thank you so much, Pete.

[33:05] But how awesome was it to see Steve Richie's new game, Pete, and that black knight mechanism

[33:09] in the middle of the play field?

[33:10] I think that is what we want more of, right?

[33:13] That is super exciting.

[33:14] How boring would it be if you battled the black knight on an LCD screen just by hitting lights,

[33:20] right?

[33:21] So much cooler to hit his flail, hit him, hit the shield, and try to take him out that

[33:26] way versus all that happening up on the screen.

[33:30] All right, I got an email from, let's see, dude, Jared job.

[33:35] Jared, thank you for taking the selfie of us.

[33:38] He said, you know, he sent me a picture of him and I taking a selfie.

[33:42] It was awesome, Jared.

[33:43] Thank you so much for hanging at TPS.

[33:45] I really, really appreciate all the nice things you said when we were hanging at the show.

[33:50] I got an email from Eric Young, Chris, my 11 year old son and I are huge fans.

[33:55] How can we meet at TPS?

[33:57] And then I did meet up with Eric and his son, Max.

[34:00] So Eric and Max, I'm so glad you guys listened to the show.

[34:04] Thank you so much for congratulating me on the award.

[34:07] It was awesome seeing you guys and I can't wait to see you guys again soon at another

[34:11] show.

[34:12] All right, what else?

[34:13] Do, do, do, do, Brian.

[34:15] Brian, Adelstein, Brian, he said, hey, Chris, hope you enjoyed the show.

[34:19] No, we didn't talk much recently.

[34:21] I guess you decided to have other, let's see, no longer productive or enjoyable relative.

[34:27] Like, okay, Brian, here's the deal, bro.

[34:29] I love you.

[34:30] I used to talk to Brian all the time.

[34:32] You know, just hit me up, man.

[34:33] Anyone who used to talk to me on Facebook about pinball, just hit me up.

[34:36] I'm always open to have a conversation.

[34:38] I got an email from Ed Cs.

[34:39] He said, fuck yeah, congratulations, Chris.

[34:41] I was getting worried when Deadpool won Bestime.

[34:43] I think I think I think this is where I was last time with announcing the thank yous

[34:47] to people.

[34:48] So anyway, that has been episode 330 of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[34:53] I just want to sign off by saying, guys, it's an awesome year for pinball.

[34:58] This is going to be a year like no other.

[35:00] If I were you, I would wait to see where things shake out.

[35:04] We're going to have so many great options over the next few months.

[35:07] Super exciting time.

[35:08] Can't wait to cover it all.

[35:09] Can't wait to interview more and more people and get their opinions about this whole crazy

[35:13] pinball hobby we live in.

[35:16] And it's going to be awesome.

[35:17] It's going to be awesome.

[35:18] I wish I had more room and I wish I had more money.

[35:21] Those are the two things that I go to bed every night thinking about when it comes to

[35:24] pinball.

[35:25] Have a great day, everyone.

[35:27] Have a great weekend.

[35:28] I don't think there will be another show before the weekend is over next week.

[35:32] I'm going to get more people on the show later in the week.

[35:34] I'm going to get Greg Bone back on the show.

[35:37] You know, Greg from the, from the Twippies.

[35:40] He was a co-host.

[35:41] You know him from straight down the middle.

[35:42] He's coming back on the show soon.

[35:44] I've got some more people lined up.

[35:46] Josh Kugler.

[35:47] I want to get Josh back on the show.

[35:49] He said he'd come on after TpF.

[35:51] I'm going to ask to see if he'll still do that.

[35:54] I am really interested to talk to the people at American pinball about how, you know, how

[35:58] they're going to feel that they're going to do with all the competition in the pinball

[36:02] world and let them talk to us about October Fest and how the reception was at the show.

[36:07] Because they heard from people more than I did about October Fest.

[36:10] Alright, everyone, 3.30, signing out right now.
