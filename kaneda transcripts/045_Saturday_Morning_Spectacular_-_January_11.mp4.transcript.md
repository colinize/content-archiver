[00:00] Do we are live coming at you from in overpriced garage and

[00:11] awaiting Connecticut paying over sticker all the homes here they go in one day for hundreds of thousands over sticker and we complain about pinball prices people.

[00:23] I mean imagine if this community looked at the real estate market how insane it would be I'm not I'm not going to go tell people anymore that we're doing the Saturday morning show on YouTube it's where we're doing it every Saturday morning so people either stumble in or they miss it that's it I'm done I'm done promoting this thing it's like the easiest thing to figure out every Saturday.

[00:48] Roughly around 10 am we're going to do this madness how's everybody doing what's up we got Jeremy Brian.

[00:56] What's with the pink workout pants man the ski pants the snowboarding pants because it's snow here.

[01:04] It's snow here I'm there baggy they're a little tight in the ways I got to break him in a little bit but I think that's because they don't you know you're not supposed to get snow down your pants when you're snowboarding.

[01:13] Everybody how you doing like like you know it's funny is people were like I'm tired of you telling people to work out when you do your doctor Phil stuff I turn you off I don't want to hear life lessons from canada I'm done with you well you know anyone who's offended by me telling people to go work out and get in shape and take care of your bodies more than your pinball machines.

[01:33] Probably should be hitting the gym alright because those people who get inspired by it and go work out and put in the hard work so you look 10 years younger than you really are those are my those are my people.

[01:48] What's up Brian got a few inches of snow yeah man I woke up this morning and it was white out it was really nice not a lot I'm waiting for the big snow fall few inches.

[02:01] It's not even an inch really just sort of covered everything with some white.

[02:06] Do you have any celebrities in your town.

[02:11] Hoda just moved to my parents town you know Hoda from the today show who makes like 20 million a year she just moved into the town where my parents live where I grew up in Bronxville New York not the Bronx I spent my whole life correcting people they're like where you from I'm like.

[02:29] Bronxville they're like oh yeah the Bronx you know someone said to me I was shopping and she goes yeah did you eat at any good Italian restaurants in the Bronx and I'm like I don't think you understand Bronxville is a square mile it's not the Bronx it's a much different town.

[02:47] So yeah grew up my whole life everywhere else in America when you say Bronxville they just think it's like part of the Bronx.

[02:55] In this town celebrities I don't know I mean I'm sure there's some look I'll tell you this there might not be famous people in these towns but there are rich people in these towns and I mean the kind of money that is even past what a lot of famous people have because you know you're talking there's like $8 million home's $20 million home's $50 million home's you go into grand age you got $150 million home's it's crazy it's crazy.

[03:24] What do we got here so J Hendrix red light grounding breathing exercises okay yeah Mr. Donk Brenda has been waiting for a few white inches to yeah that's okay now we're now we've crossed over into the realm of inappropriate and we're only three minutes into this show.

[03:44] Stephen Tyler lives in my town Massachusetts okay that's awesome Brian man that's do you ever run into him do you ever see any of his cars doesn't Stephen Tyler have like an awesome car collection.

[03:58] I know he used to have one of those like crazy what was the car company name I think it was I think it was like saline made that crazy super car that look like an extended Lotus Elise and you have like a

[04:13] thousand horsepower Mr. Franchie in the house welcome Christopher welcome to the best and only and possibly worse Saturday morning show about pinball where we talk all things pinball I actually I actually I'm excited that we're sort of we're getting close we're getting close to pinball on the beach.

[04:39] I don't know should I go to pinball on the beach yeah I'd rather go there than tpf I have to be honest like if I did shoes between going to warm Florida where the entire thing is sort of set up to be by the pool drink in frozen cocktails with pinball personalities out in the sun you know I don't care about the games I don't understand you know and I know all the games are going to be there but.

[05:08] I would rather do that and they're not even paying me to say this I know Ed is doing the show I would they they haven't reached out they haven't asked me to show up I'm apparently I'm not at the same level as Carrie Hardy who gets he gets actually put into the show program as a legendary pinball personality carry congratulations Christopher Franchie also gets top billing zombie.

[05:37] Zombie Eddie George Gomez like you know all the usual characters Steve Richie's gonna be there canada going is always like I think I make people nervous it's not just because of my good body trust me that's not what they're nervous about it's like well he goes how's that gonna make these people feel now

[06:01] Franchie I saw Franchie at expo and everybody knows this when you go to a show and you walk around everyone's just having a good time right there's no real drama there's no beef there's no fighting there's no nothing you know when I went to expo and they tried to keep me out last year and I know people saw like David fix saw me and then went to Rob Burke to kind of escort me out and Melvin saved me because I was like I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure.

[06:31] Because he told them if you kick him out I'm leaving with my games that's what happened it was it was unnecessary even after everything David fix did to me I just saw the guy and said hey David and walked on like it's it's over it's bygones it's it's just I don't know what am I going to do I'm not going to fight the dude I'm not going to threaten the guy I'm not going to cause a disturbance is it's his show of course I'm going to respect his show

[07:01] You know that was the part when I got booed at the twippies right by CJ I'll never forget that he he didn't show any respect to all the people who organized the show and all the hard work and he actually like just made himself look foolish not can eat it because I still won the award.

[07:19] But yeah so I don't know pinball by the beach is anyone going besides Franchie here.

[07:24] I think it's going to be fun I think it's going to be fun I don't it's coming up fast so the thing is it's super bowl weekend I don't know who decided to do it's super bowl weekend and that is not ideal it is like the weekend of February it's like seventh eighth and ninth something like that.

[07:52] And the only reason I say that is you know you can still get back in time for the super bowl I just think traveling on super bowl weekends a little bit you know even though it's in New Orleans and this is in Florida I don't know I don't know I think I'm going to have to float this one by Brenda it would be nice I will say this it would be nice to one day actually get invited to be at a show.

[08:22] Where they actually take care of my accommodations I've never had it happen now I will say this whenever I go to tpf I would always share a hotel room with Blake Dumas nil love Blake he's the artist you guys know Blake his work has been on a few games he did the logo for a lot of tpfs he also did the artwork for he did he did an art package for spooky when they did that sort of space theme game.

[08:52] That never came out he's also working with barrels of fun right now Blake is a Blake is like one of my really really good pinball friends I love Blake he did the new twippy's logo as well so yeah it's got that kind of like cosmic sort of retro vibes going on did everybody vote in the twippy's I was calling he said voting is about this surpass I think I think he's headed to about this surpassing the world.

[09:22] I think it's not what it did last year but now that I think about it I'm like yeah but like nobody really vote it last year did they like last year's twippy's was like an abomination but I look again here's a deal vote vote vote I'm disappointed that evil dead art package was not even eligible French you know how I feel on this I said it should have been I think it's ridiculous it's art it's done it's going on the game it's the best art package that I'm going to do it.

[09:52] I think it's going to be a good time to do this year so yeah why not why not I guess we're going to have to have Frenchies goonies competing against Frenchies evil dead oh he said it he said it and French is not going to chime in here and say I French he could he he's been known to do this he's been known to say I will tell you right now the next spooky game is not goonies that's not confirming they don't have goonies but he see he's not going to say it.

[10:21] He's right I've been watching him goonies is not the next game.

[10:25] Okay he said from spooky dammit um dammit what is it.

[10:32] Well that's good that's good screen grab this everybody.

[10:37] Jason send this to Jason nap let him get let him put this up as a story by the way guys I you know I um I actually I actually it's bigger than goonies all right that's even better than goonies.

[10:51] Better all right so okay every screen grab that just let's just keep screen grabbing everything for anti says and we'll get more news out of this show in just 11 minutes then then all the other podcast or his combined so this is good this is good.

[11:07] Look I'm excited I think that spooky is in a really great position let's just talk about the the vibes of Pimmel right now I I think there's some really really sort of there's a dichotomy happening you guys know what dichotomy means right I don't have a very big vocabulary so I use some big words frequently like a name and dichotomy and ancillary right okay I wish I had a bigger vocabulary but that's not going to be a big word.

[11:37] It's dichotomy which means like there's two opposing things happening I think there's a dichotomy of we're really excited about dnd and evil dead and we're really excited about the return of a lot of magic and theme integration and depth of code and creativity with mechanisms beautiful beautiful games I well well let me let me.

[12:05] Let me step back a little bit I think dnd's art isn't miss all of it all of it I think I know they use like legendary dnd are yeah but maybe that guy's good at making $10 dnd booklets but I just think the art and dnd really comes across as looking pretty ai generated pretty flat looking pretty boring it's just boring it's just.

[12:35] It's I think that's like the best word it's just not interesting and then I look at evil dead artwork and it's dynamic it's got energy it's colorful and when I love about franches evil dead it it just it's all it's all beautifully mixed together like it just has such cohesiveness is the word i'm looking for look see I struggle for the big words evil dead just look at it's just like.

[13:04] Evil dead just looks so good and I love that each side is different artwork but then you've got like that you know the color palette carries over into the apron into the playfield into the back box into the translate and it's why and I mean is when I say this it's why I almost prefer.

[13:24] The franchy trend that the franchy topper over the other topper because again like I get that that topper is neat but I think the franchy topper artistically fits in better with the game versus that like puppet guy popping up and down I mean that I absolutely mean that I actually prefer.

[13:49] That franchy topper so I think if you get if you get the game and then you get the I would get the butter cabinet and I would get the franchy topper I don't I don't think you know I get I look I get that that topper pounds is up and down and it's $1,300 but I don't know.

[14:11] So here's a thing.

[14:13] Here's a thing the the dungeons and dragons sort of the feedback from the community has been really good it's been really good and it's it's like alright you know what I feel like everyone sort of vibe in like that with dnd like alright alright like we like what you did here stern like we really think there's a lot of depth in the code we really like the passion that went into the project we like what you did with the dragon.

[14:43] It feels like Brian Eddie's best stern game to date for sure there's a reason why gang if you go on pin side why do you think we've seen three to four Lord of the rings Ellie's have popped up for sale this past week I want to stay on this.

[15:03] Why is that I think that's the result of dungeons and dragons a new medieval themed game is out that is going to have probably you know better shooter better mex now look nothing nothing

[15:21] that dnd has so far that I've seen from a code perspective looks nearly as exciting as the moments in Lord of the rings pinball it's just it's just not there right it's just you just can't Lord of the rings pinball the way it recreates the iconic scenes from the movie is just probably one of the greatest pinball machines of all time

[15:44] if we were to rank games by moments of wow and the way the mechanisms integrate with those moments of wow and also would be up there with greatest call outs in the history of pinball best multi balls in the history of pinball feeling like you've achieved something when you get to multi ball is another great element of Lord of the rings where it falls down is the art package on the cabinet is kind of a trotious

[16:14] it's got the hair you know d i c k on the glass mirror glass translate but it had real mirror glass gang not the cheap stuff you're getting now it also is clunky it's just clunky there the upper left path of the dead is really just useless area of the game

[16:39] but the sword ramp is awesome ballrog is incredible and you know you got the the ring which is just one of the greatest mech Stern has ever made so yeah I just think that um you know I think that we're seeing those Lord of the rings pop up for sale because of dnd now I talked about which dnd would I get you know we got the pro the premium and then you've got

[17:09] as we know we've got the um what do we got we got the Ellie right okay so right off the bat the Ellie I think is not a good Ellie I don't like the Ellie I think the what the beholder the guy on the right side is really hard to look at I get he's a main figure but I don't like how he looks I don't like the colors against the red armor

[17:39] I don't find the flaming red fire on the armor to work really well in comparison to what's on the art like the imagery on the cabinet doesn't really connect with that armor I don't like really red armor unless it's really like a deadpool or something where like red makes total sense I get what they're going for and red is a dnd color

[18:06] I just think this cabinet is ugly I think the translate is hideous and you're going to be looking at that translate artwork more than anything and I just I just think they fumble the whole Ellie I really do it does look like monster zinc and and I just I don't know I just don't like the Ellie I don't think this is ever going to be in Ellie that is highly sought after that looks good in a line up

[18:37] and is going to be you know in demand so again so and here's the tricky part so take the Ellie off the table then it's like the premium artwork I like better the premium seems to be the way to go

[18:51] and then you're caught in this sort of quagmire another big word for everybody out there the quagmire is this do I drop 9500

[19:04] on a premium of dnd right now when I know that there's a really really good chance if I just wait six months the Ellie will be 9500 dollars see I look I'm not an idiot in the end yeah I would rather have a 9500 or

[19:27] Ellie then a 9500 or premium because in six months these premiums will be 7500 King Kong is going to push all the prices down of everything it just is it's just the way it's going to work

[19:41] So I again I and so what I recommend to everybody see I think the dnd to get is in six months the premium for $7500

[19:57] Sterns going to make unlimited premiums I think you're going to be able to get premiums for 7500 let people because they hear it because gang remember this

[20:08] The dealers are stocking up on these things and they're going to have unsolved inventory and it's not going to make them nervous now but they're going to need to get rid of that unsolved inventory to absorb the inventory of the next stern game

[20:25] So I would just wait the code's not done it's at 0.80 by the time the code is done you're then looking at a savings on I think both the premium and the Ellie of at least two to three thousand dollars

[20:44] The pro's not going to go down to three thousand dollars I look the pro to me I don't want it I just don't want it I think the dragon needs to have all of its features and I don't like the way the dragon and the pro operates for those of you who don't mind that then absolutely that's the way to go for you if you can live with that coil dragon that just springs up and down and that's it

[21:11] Then knock yourself out

[21:19] Pros are for hose that was a ho that phrase is still true

[21:24] It's still kind of true

[21:27] But yeah, like I also think I

[21:31] You know I've been watching more and more of the dnd gameplay and

[21:35] I think what's it's going to come down to is how creative they get with the code

[21:41] I was listening to one of the streamers talk about one of the modes and it sounded really awesome and the mode was this

[21:46] You're trying to sneak

[21:49] Into the castle I think or or do something sneaky and you don't want to alert the guards to your presence and so in that mode

[22:01] You're trying to avoid hitting the slingshots because that will alert the guards that you are there and that is awesome

[22:11] You know there's just too much

[22:14] lack of creativity I think in how games are coded

[22:19] Every single sling and switch and pop bumper and Valk everything

[22:25] Can do whatever you code it to do

[22:30] And I love it. I love when you approach a pinball machine

[22:36] And you're like alright in this mode

[22:39] You're trying to not hit stuff

[22:42] You're trying to avoid that shot

[22:46] GNR has a really fun mode this shall we play a game when you want to hit five consecutive

[22:52] Red, white and blue shots as you're battling China and the shots turn from red, white and blue to you know

[23:00] Yellow and red for China and you're trying to do five in a row

[23:05] Or you lose the streak. It's fun. It's like you know what's funny about GNR to me is like

[23:09] The game's best modes are the simplest wizard modes that you hit at the end of

[23:16] You know the songs which can sometimes just turn into

[23:21] Multi-ball madness and you know, they just become too much

[23:25] But I do love GNR you know, I have a love hate with it

[23:30] I haven't seen everything yet in the game. I haven't gotten to sympathy for the devil. I got to the slash solo

[23:36] I've gotten to the or in the world tour

[23:40] Wizard mode

[23:43] Destruction Derby demolition Derby whatever. I don't really I don't that's kind of like my least favorite one

[23:49] battling the robot to those two you know bringing down the wall and

[23:54] The Chinese democracy wizard modes are the best or many wizard modes

[23:58] Just more satisfying so

[24:02] DND is gonna be a lot of I think fun code and I think the way

[24:07] The game is right now that you know, you're you're kind of excited. There's gonna be 40 plus modes and all these different ways to go and

[24:14] It's still very nerdy

[24:16] It's still very dnd, you know like the skeletons popping up on the screen and some of the animations are kind of you know

[24:24] Like yeah some of them are cool

[24:27] Some of them are neat some of them are not as much but all in all

[24:32] probably the best stern game to come out since jaws and

[24:38] You know sternza sternza an interesting point right now spike threes around the corner

[24:47] It's around the corner

[24:49] We're all anticipating a price hike. I think Seth has been talking in a way that is like teasing that

[24:56] Yeah, hold on I say I gotta turn out I got a little portable heater on you can see it's right here

[25:02] It's right there and I'm gonna turn it off because I got these snowboarding pants on and it's

[25:09] You can see him

[25:14] I'll be right back hold on

[25:27] Oh

[25:37] All right, we're back

[25:41] And we're back

[25:47] Okay, I've never seen a 50 year old with worst taste and clothing. I'm not 50

[25:56] So there's that and Inkelberg Humberdingk

[26:02] I don't think you understand brother. I have fun with fashion and let me just first of all

[26:10] Don't insult someone's attire until you show us what you look like man

[26:14] And you're not even you're not even using a real name your name is not Inkelberg Humberdingk, which is from what Princess bride

[26:22] So here's the thing about clothing brother

[26:41] Looking great looking like a million bucks. I go to a wedding looking like a million bucks

[26:45] so like

[26:47] It is what it is. I know this though Inkelberg you would never

[26:52] You would never let us see who you are and that's the difference between

[26:56] That this not 50 yet with horrible taste and clothing and you know random dude with a fake name on the internet

[27:35] What age should we stop having fun with clothes is that so I bet you drive a boring car

[27:40] What does that mean you're your age?

[27:43] Is that is that do you guys subscribe to that that that at a certain age you have to start dressing and

[27:49] wearing like landzend and

[28:10] You think I care brother. I don't care. I walk in anywhere and as long as I feel good about

[28:18] How I'm how I'm rolling through life. I don't care

[33:12] Insulting me. I yeah, so I'm just like winning. I'm like living rent-free in that guy's head

[33:18] So and and like now he knows like you know like he just he could and he could like he just he just

[33:23] He just got triggered right away by canada and my pink pants. I'm the pink pants or baby Brenda got me these

[33:31] after I choked her out

[33:34] I can't I can't wait to tell Brenda that that she got choked out

[33:39] Amazing right after I choked her out she decided to marry me and have two of my children

[33:45] That's crazy. That's crazy. How low her standards must be

[33:50] It's

[33:52] It's funny. It's funny people are like people are crazy on the internet

[33:56] Um, all right. What about CGC for Dredi remakes. All right. I love it. Let's get back. Let's get back on track

[34:02] Okay, here's the deal here's the deal

[34:06] I do not like

[34:09] Chicago gaming company. I said it

[34:12] I don't want to support

[34:15] Chicago gaming company

[34:18] And my reasons for that are obvious

[34:23] I think

[34:24] they are

[34:26] the worst

[34:27] communicators in all of pimple and

[34:32] Josh sharps smug comment on my smug comment

[34:38] Just rubbed me the wrong way. It was just like really bro

[34:44] Like you think this is funny that people

[34:47] waited so long

[34:49] and you never

[34:51] Communicate it that the weight would be that long

[34:55] and you I just think it's sad. I think it's bad business and again

[35:01] It's nothing personal Josh and whoever's over there dug and the you know the folks over at CGC

[35:09] I just won't support them

[35:11] And I won't buy anything from them now you can say look you're going to be missing out. I don't care

[35:16] I don't want pulp fiction now. I did two years ago. I don't want it now

[35:22] I don't want to try light zone remake. I never will

[35:27] And I just don't care about remakes of old games anymore. I just don't care

[35:33] Even if look if Pedredi remakes toad in it's not going to be as good or built as good as the bali Williams toad in

[35:39] And I think that that's where I'm at with it. I don't think the fun house remake like look like how look at the fun house remake

[35:46] Pinside page

[35:48] It's got like two pages

[35:51] Maybe three pages

[35:54] I just don't think that people care

[35:57] There's no way the games are flying off the shelf

[36:03] You know

[36:06] I

[36:07] Got to do it again get ready. I got to take a little five minute bathroom break. You know what it is is these pants are so warm

[36:12] It's like warming everything up down here at a drink in my coffee. I gotta go. I gotta go real quick. I'll be right back right back

[36:18] Franchi keep them keep them

[36:21] Keep them engaged keep them entertained

[36:24] Look what else what can I say like guys

[36:28] everybody

[36:29] Go shop for some clothes that are so you can dress your age right so go go buy clothes that indicate how old you are

[36:36] I'll be right back

[36:59] You

[37:29] You

[37:59] You

[38:29] You

[38:34] Oh

[38:38] Back

[38:40] You know I think I think Enkelberg Humberding might also be on my patreon chat. I'm gonna have to ban them there too

[38:49] I think I'm good. I think I'm good. I'm gonna have to go again. Oh

[38:55] Man choking women wow

[38:57] I

[38:58] Weird weird weird vibes today, right

[39:03] Um

[39:04] I know I know I'm still feeling a lot. I might have to run again. I might have to run again. I don't think I

[39:10] This coffee's run through me

[39:15] Okay

[39:18] You know like in it's it's like

[39:20] The haters again, there's an art form

[39:24] There's an art form detrolling

[39:27] And you just don't want to because use what the trolls do in and you know this

[39:33] What they're doing is this and and it's

[39:36] It's like you know, there's like a small circle of a real canada haters that can't

[39:41] They can't go on without knowing what I'm gonna say because I think I'm gonna talk about them

[39:45] Or they want to see me get like riled up right they I'll use like the analogy

[39:50] Of what they're looking to get out of me

[39:52] It's sort of like when you take a dog

[39:57] and the dogs

[39:59] behavior

[40:01] Will be what

[40:04] You know it'll be how you treat the dog will be how it behaves so the real short story is this

[40:10] Take a dog that's not a bad dog, but chain it to a fence

[40:15] And the dog's gonna bark because it wants to be free and then the owner might point at the dog and say see

[40:20] That's why I have to chain the dog to the fence look how it's behaving, but it's only behaving that way

[40:27] Because you chain to the fence and what these haters try to do or trolls is they want me to behave in a way

[40:36] So they can point at me and say hey see look that's why he's a bad guy

[40:40] That's why he's bad for this hobby. That's why he's bad for this community

[40:43] See what he did there and it just it just doesn't work

[40:47] And the only

[40:49] person

[40:50] That can cancel me is me

[40:53] Right, so I don't do like drunken stupid stuff anymore, right?

[40:57] When's the last time you saw me get drunk and do something stupid in this hobby

[41:02] Now look do I still get drunk and

[41:04] Stoop it in real life? Yeah, not like not bad stuff, but I'm still gonna have a few

[41:09] But you know these people are stuck in a momentian. It's like it's that that thing was like six years ago

[41:15] And can you imagine

[41:17] Six years ago did it did anyone get hurt?

[41:19] Did anyone get injured?

[41:21] Did anyone

[41:23] You know what I'm saying? It's like ridiculous

[41:25] Ridiculous the world in which we live in these guys are frozen in moments

[41:29] They're just jealous and I mean that's what it comes down to is like the jealousy

[41:33] Think about it like this the jealousy of these haters is that here's their issue

[41:38] They have all their buddies that are like die hard pinball guys making content every day for no money

[41:44] Right making content every day no money

[41:46] They can't understand why anyone subscribes why anyone pays attention. They can't understand any of it

[41:52] They're they're narrative is that he hates on everything pinball. He hates pinball

[41:56] He doesn't play pinball and then you know for people who listen to my show. It's anything but that

[42:01] And the people that don't listen are still stuck in a moment that like they're so off base

[42:08] On the content on the fun we're having on the community that surrounds canadus pinball podcasts

[42:15] They're just so off on it and and they don't know how to it would see don't it would suck being that loser that can enjoy

[42:23] Right, you can enjoy the provocateur. You can't you you're you're I don't like m&m. I don't like Axel Rose

[42:30] I don't like that n.w.a. Music. I don't like you know two live crew like that

[42:35] That's what these guys are like they're just so uptight

[42:38] And they dress like it to right that's the thing like clearly like if I walk into a room at my age at 48

[42:44] Yeah, well, I don't know he looks like

[42:47] Looks like he's more fun than my husband wearing the lens and you know, it's it like I look

[42:52] I could see it when I walk around you know these conservative wasp towns and they are like everyone's so uptight

[42:59] Like uptight with money. That's the weirdest thing to me

[43:03] You have millions and you and you're not even free

[43:09] You're not free

[43:11] You you you decided to look like the catalog of who you're supposed to dress like

[43:17] Because you live in a Connecticut town and you have a finance job and you just have to you just have to wear that uniform

[43:25] And that's kind of why I dress like this every now. I just don't believe in uniforms of age and uniforms of jobs

[43:33] And he's like it is and look it's got me this far it might not get me much further, but hey it is probably not right

[43:39] I mean you can make a real serious argument that I've sort of plateaued in my career

[43:43] Preventionally because I won't

[43:45] conform to the next layer or level of what it's you're supposed to look like and that's probably true

[43:52] But I also know that I don't want to give up my personal freedoms and my my ability to express myself

[44:00] creatively to be that right if any of you ever go on LinkedIn and you read the way people talk about themselves and about their

[44:08] The company. It's just it's so like ah

[44:11] Like nobody it's like it's like it's like these human beings sound like chat gpt

[44:16] And I don't know but like I'll say this my company been there 12 years they they appreciate me for me

[44:23] And they let me be me right and look I'm not an idiot. I don't walk into a a client meeting like this

[44:30] All right, and where are we at?

[44:32] You should have a 50th part. I'm going to Japan for my 50th birthday me and Francie are gonna go business

[44:38] Let's do it

[44:41] Ah, yeah, thank you

[44:43] Thank you manual her name is

[44:46] Um with another name. I love it. I love long names

[44:51] Francie, do you so art on your website?

[44:56] Okay, so here's the thing here's the thing here's the thing

[44:59] Let's ship in and buy a canada some of those huge bottom email hot topic pants with the danglings

[45:05] Dude, I've got the dangling suspenders. I've got them here. Is that what those are

[45:11] um

[45:13] Anyway, all right, so like

[45:14] Patre again remakes to me are as boring as it gets

[45:19] Looking to the past boring

[45:23] You know what stern remakes is really worthy excitement right like look at Metallica not boring

[45:31] Ghostbusters next I don't know

[45:35] I don't know how they would handle ghostbusters with the LCD

[45:39] A trup sorry pick up tron and gb

[45:44] When we talk about the games that people want stern to put on a new platform

[45:49] It's always the same three it's ghostbusters. It's tron

[45:54] And it's lord of the rings like that that's like that's it

[45:59] That's it

[46:02] And if I were to add another game in the mix

[46:05] Simpsons maybe

[46:07] ACDC

[46:11] I don't know you know, I mean stern has that the problem stern has is they got to be careful

[46:17] They got to be careful

[46:19] Because every time they do a better remake and they outshine

[46:24] that other game

[46:26] They instantly burn old customers and they also

[46:31] Over-saturate the market because then all of a sudden now you've got all these older Metallica LEDs

[46:38] And I know some people out there right now might have both of them side by side, but that's not gonna last too long

[46:46] You're gonna want to get rid of the old one you're not gonna want to play the old one when you have the new one

[46:54] Well, I'm just excited that franchi has seemingly confirmed that spooky's next game is not the goonies

[47:00] And it is bigger than the goonies

[47:05] You know

[47:07] It's beetle juice then

[47:10] Will you tell us it's not beetle juice like I feel like it's got to be beetle juice then

[47:16] I feel like it's got to be beetle juice

[47:19] Is beetle juice bigger than goonies? Yeah

[47:23] easily I would I would have my vasectomy twice

[47:29] If it was peewee's big adventure

[47:32] Right

[47:33] They should make peewee's big adventure and the only way you can get a collector's edition is if everyone gets into a theater

[47:43] And jerks off

[47:47] I don't know where the shows go today people it's been like I've been accused of

[47:52] Shoking out my wife

[47:54] I've been accused of not dressing my age

[47:57] Uh all of which would seemingly right

[48:02] A someone who's assaulted women who is a horrible dresser

[48:06] Is still in the contention as

[48:08] favorite pinball content creator

[48:10] and favorite

[48:12] Pinball podcaster has everybody voted in the twippies and trust me don't just vote once vote

[48:20] Um get you get your family members to vote don't vote twice

[48:23] I'm not I'm not encouraging you to do anything illegal

[48:26] You know, I always say this like

[48:29] The the committee over there is always in the dilemma because I've wanted six years in a row

[48:35] The seventh year didn't count

[48:37] I've usually won by a pretty good margin

[48:40] I don't know like if I do lose

[48:43] Um

[48:44] Someone just did a better job campaigning for votes. I don't really see people campaigning for votes as much

[48:50] I see you know who always seems to be asking for the most votes

[48:54] It's always like the mod makers. They're like we're so honored to be like guys chill out

[49:00] There's no honor in the twippies. Let's let's can we call a spade a spade

[49:06] You should why you honored to be recognized by the twippy committee. Oh man

[49:11] Yeah, they saw that I made that 3d printed mod and they they put me in the drop down with the other 75 different drop down

[49:18] I don't like it like I'm honored

[49:22] I'm honored

[49:25] Ralph is a stern shill

[49:27] Yeah, Ralph went

[49:29] Ralph went full shill

[49:33] and it's unfortunate

[49:35] and

[49:36] Not only is as he gone full shill for for stern he's he's also

[49:42] You know, I mean, he's he's making money from from flipping out to sell games. So that's look

[49:48] Look, he's got like I

[49:50] It's it's he's it's not gonna change his views. He'll probably get

[49:56] Just as much if not more views

[49:59] Um, I get zero free stuff

[50:03] I've been waiting for a

[50:06] A spooky hat and t-shirt that has the boner on it the eggplant boner emoji

[50:13] I was told I'd be expecting that one day soon

[50:17] Um

[50:20] Ralph

[50:22] Has no idea what pinball is it's quite annoying to listen him talking about pinball

[50:27] He's just an amateur is talking about like I think you could probably just insert canada into that in salt

[50:35] I mean, that's kind of what people say about me

[50:39] um

[50:40] Retro Ralph could have just stayed in our cage and got more views and made some money

[50:46] He legit loves pinball and makes great content

[50:50] Uh

[50:52] Did you see the art I did okay, so um

[50:57] Look, I I will say this I give everybody credit who does nicely polished youtube videos

[51:03] Raise your hand if you don't do that

[51:07] Raise your hand if you don't make nice thumbnail images, so it attracts people to your youtube content

[51:13] Raise your hand if you're making no money with any of your pinball content on youtube

[51:19] I don't know how to do it. I tried to turn on the monetization. It says I wasn't eligible. I don't know like

[51:25] I don't know then I say hey well you could just give money to paypal and I'll give you guys a shout out

[51:30] But like I you know kind of happy with where I'm at. I think I've kind of plateaued

[51:33] I mean that like 720 subscribers the most I ever had subscriber wise was like 750 or something

[51:40] Yeah, if I did more interviews sure

[51:42] Franchi knows how it is. I think only franchi knows

[51:46] How much work?

[51:48] It is to do interviews

[51:51] How much editing we do to make the person we're talking to not sound like a fool with um

[52:01] um

[52:03] um, you know or they pause or they say like like like like like like like you know

[52:09] You know, you know, you know, you know, you know like the amount of times

[52:14] I've done interviews and then when I go back to listen to the interview

[52:19] It is almost impossible to make it through 10 minutes with the way the person talks

[52:24] You will never know that because

[52:27] The editing that I've done has made a lot of those personalities sound incredible

[52:33] They could never do

[52:35] This like live without all that

[52:38] You get better over time in a way

[52:42] media training

[52:43] This show has helped me become a better presenter. It's helped me become a better public speaker

[52:49] It's it helped a lot if you go back and listen to my first shows that are pretty bad

[52:53] I kind of was just

[52:55] Emulating a little bit the podcasters I listen to at the time like Nate shivers and other people

[53:01] But that was kind of like their voice, but it's kind of all I knew like you talk about him all like this

[53:07] Check your phone franchi my phone. Oh, let me go get it. Hold on

[53:31] This is great. This is great. Could I share could I share that?

[53:46] Franchie, could I share that? I'll wear that

[53:53] Oh my god, all right. Oh my god

[54:01] I mean

[54:04] You know look and they say that we're not having fun here

[54:09] That I I will wear that

[54:12] That is good

[54:15] That is good

[54:17] Oh my god um

[54:19] You know we could end the show right there. We want we have another like a little bit more than a half hour go to go

[54:24] This is fun

[54:27] Yeah, I just showed it

[54:31] I'll show it again

[54:40] Oh, he is packing

[54:45] Oh, we need to have more fun

[54:49] You ever think about that?

[54:51] Well like a serious there's a serious contingency in this hobby that

[54:56] Sucks like these people take it seriously, right? It's like we're there like I take pinball seriously

[55:01] I'm gonna I'm gonna win that translate tonight

[55:05] I'm gonna go into that league night

[55:07] And I'm gonna I'm gonna beat those people at pinball

[55:12] And win that translate

[55:14] Yeah, I'm gonna spend hours getting better at this game hours

[55:19] You know when I ask people how could I do my content better? You know you hear some people like I play more play more play more

[55:24] I get it, but then you start to see people say like

[55:27] Get good at games like teenage mutant interturtles and I'm like uh yeah

[55:31] I'm not gonna do that that game sucks the game's not fun the game drains on the left side

[55:38] I think it was design wrong and I won't even waste my time

[55:41] Why would I waste my time on a game that I consider to be a design nightmare?

[55:46] That's no fun and they're like yeah, even though the game's not fun to shoot

[55:50] It's really fun if you can if you can like hold on for dear life to get to this mode

[55:55] And then you'll finally understand Dwight's genius in the game and Dwight makes really hard games and and but if you can get there

[56:02] And you get good then you know, I don't want to do that

[56:06] I don't want to spend

[56:09] countless hours of my life to overcome a design deficiency in a game

[56:15] That you can't make play properly

[56:19] I'd rather masturbate for all those hours

[56:23] Then stay on TMNT to get good enough to overcome the

[56:28] The design deficiencies of the game

[56:31] Okay, so like no, I don't care. I don't care

[56:36] I'll take the glass off and use my finger and get to that mode and then I'll go whack off

[56:40] I don't care. I don't want to do that for hours and hours and hours

[56:45] And a shitty game

[56:47] Don't normally curse a crappy game

[56:50] Doesn't become uncrappy because you spend enough time to overcome what makes it crappy. I'm sorry

[56:57] It's still a crappy game

[57:00] You know and like it should that game like the

[57:03] Board messed up he messed up you could tell you could tell that game would have been a masterpiece

[57:11] It it kills me when you stand over Ninja Turtles

[57:14] It is such an awesome world under glass like there's way more to there's way more going on in turtles than in D&D

[57:21] But then they went and they absolutely made the game brutal and they made the game so not fun to play

[57:29] And it's like why would you make a

[57:32] Kids cartoon show that we all grew up with that we love

[57:36] Impossible to play it be like making

[57:39] The old school for player Ninja Turtle arcade machine really difficult to play

[57:46] Right like almost like cuphead difficult to play

[57:50] They messed up they messed up and it's no fun

[57:57] You see what's crazy to me is like and Ghostbusters is another one. It's like if Stern were smart

[58:04] I would go back and fix turtles

[58:07] Go back and fix Ghostbusters make them more fun

[58:12] Right make them more fun

[58:14] And nobody wants to get like I'll tell you this there's nothing more

[58:17] Unsatisfying in Pimball

[58:19] Then out lane drains that happen all the time

[58:24] Without you making a mistake

[58:27] Can I repeat that

[58:29] The most not fun thing about Pimball is just constant out lane drains

[58:35] That happen

[58:37] all the time

[58:39] Because of the bad design of the game you didn't do anything wrong you didn't miss a shot you you just

[58:44] You the game is just designed to fireballs there too often

[58:50] And the and the openings are too large

[58:53] And it's not fun. I hate that

[58:56] I'll take this right now in Guns and Roses

[59:00] I lowered the out lane post and it still drains

[59:03] So much in the out lanes in that game

[59:06] I don't want I don't like games

[59:09] Where you're like just trying to avoid the slings at all costs and every time you go near the slings

[59:13] You've got to be nudging the machine all over the place. I don't like that design

[59:20] I don't

[59:22] I don't I look and I know it's hard

[59:25] I know it's hard. I think these companies sometimes have players that are too good

[59:29] And they make them so they're challenging to like Keith Elwin

[59:33] Good do that and then watch the rest of us not have any fun at all

[59:37] No, but Elwin games I think are the right balance right godzilla is not it's not it's not

[59:43] Easy, but it's not overly punishing

[59:46] Same thing with jaws same thing with Jurassic Park. They're not easy

[59:50] But they're not you don't feel like they're like unfair

[59:59] Um

[01:00:08] Yeah, all right. I'll send you my address now hold on france. He's asking for my address. Here we go

[01:00:17] This could be a huge mistake

[01:00:20] Oh

[01:00:28] Hold on I can't write and talk at the same time

[01:00:43] All right there you go brother. Thank you

[01:00:46] Uh, what do we got here?

[01:00:50] You know what I've got this is weird like let me show you something I've got two mods here just sitting here hold on

[01:01:11] I was like

[01:01:14] I

[01:01:16] I've got these mods that I never

[01:01:20] I've got a

[01:01:22] Batman parachute pickup mod

[01:01:27] And then I've also got the bat signal

[01:01:31] That I believe I haven't even opened this I believe is has been

[01:01:35] pain it black where the the one in the game

[01:01:39] Comes like silver

[01:01:41] Yeah

[01:01:44] Yeah

[01:01:46] Oh just drop the washer hey

[01:01:53] Let me show you this thing let's see what we got here

[01:01:58] I'm dropping pieces

[01:02:01] I

[01:02:10] It's the black it's the black bat signal and it's the right bat signal

[01:02:14] I think the other ones like the wrong signal

[01:02:19] Um, no medium

[01:02:24] Not large medium medium will be great

[01:02:27] Okay

[01:02:29] spooky speedo that'd be great

[01:02:36] Well

[01:02:39] So did you guys see the tpf post that I put up that

[01:02:44] They're indicating that we might get Harry Potter

[01:02:47] Will be at tpf

[01:02:52] I don't know about you guys but man it's it's mid-January almost

[01:02:56] Not quite there yet

[01:02:59] But

[01:03:00] It's crazy that we're probably gonna see Harry Potter

[01:03:05] Sometime in February March

[01:03:08] We all know that avatar sales are abysmal right you guys like you guys all know that right there's

[01:03:15] Did anyone even get can I ask this question has anyone even got their avatar CE yet

[01:03:22] Did anyone get

[01:03:23] Yes speedo small did anyone get avatar CE

[01:03:29] Anybody like I don't the game was

[01:03:35] The game was made the game was announced in October

[01:03:39] October November December like like four months to get the C's

[01:03:43] Which

[01:03:50] Which with this whole first batch going overseas nonsense what why is that

[01:03:57] Why why why would they even get them first like why can't you why why not just make the people overseas wait

[01:04:03] I don't I don't understand that can someone explain that to me a

[01:04:07] U.S. product

[01:04:09] I get that it takes time to get them over there, but like okay

[01:04:12] Just let let them wait another couple months get your U.S. customers your main market the games first. Why would you go overseas first?

[01:04:25] I don't I'm never understood that we got to get the games to like why

[01:04:30] Europe doesn't send us their games first

[01:04:33] When they make a game in Europe they're the first ones are not on a you know on their way to America first

[01:04:39] Make America pinball a great again

[01:04:47] They should go to Canada first

[01:04:53] People will lose interest during the long wait is the logic

[01:04:58] Can I just can we just say collectively if you bought an avatar CE

[01:05:05] What were you drinking

[01:05:08] Were you on something?

[01:05:11] Did you lose a bet?

[01:05:13] Can someone explain to me why you would buy that game for $15,000?

[01:05:19] Knowing that the demand for it is less than godfather toy story and elton john

[01:05:24] And knowing that that game is going to be a

[01:05:28] 9k game in just when Harry Potter drops can how do you guys feel like you're gonna drop?

[01:05:34] 15k

[01:05:36] Harry Potter is gonna drop and your 15k avatar is gonna be worth like 9k like in an instant

[01:05:44] And also if what I'm hearing is true when you see like a

[01:05:50] A wide body filled with magical toys Harry Potter

[01:05:55] How are you gonna walk over to your avatar with nothing in it?

[01:05:58] I

[01:06:00] Mean all up like why do you like how can you be happy with what they put into avatar

[01:06:05] like how

[01:06:08] Like how are you not disappointed as a fan of the franchise because all of I know you love avatar

[01:06:13] How are you not just so disappointed in the lack of magic in the game?

[01:06:20] Like there's not even a single toy

[01:06:23] There's not even like the black light doesn't even it works. It's okay for me

[01:06:29] Like that just sounds like such a defeated like

[01:06:33] That's just like this such a shoulder shrug though, man

[01:06:37] I don't care about toys. What do you care about?

[01:06:41] Like you

[01:06:43] Then it could just be a single level EM

[01:06:47] The colors are nice. I care about speed

[01:06:52] It doesn't play nearly as fast as Elton John. It doesn't shoot as good as Elton John

[01:07:01] It's not even a fast game bro

[01:07:03] It's not I've played it like there's like it's not a fast

[01:07:08] Yeah

[01:07:11] Dude an Olaf man nothing kills speed like lower playfields brother

[01:07:16] I

[01:07:20] I don't know man

[01:07:22] Olaf Olaf man. I feel like I feel like

[01:07:25] But Olaf let me ask your question and I'm serious. I hate to keep it on you

[01:07:30] But why wouldn't you just buy a CE for 10 grand

[01:07:34] When when it why why do you need to order it right now?

[01:07:37] I

[01:07:42] I

[01:07:43] Olaf can you answer that like you you you do know the way the market's been going so why

[01:07:50] Why wouldn't

[01:07:52] Why wouldn't you just wait are you in Europe Olaf lord Olaf?

[01:08:03] I don't know I don't know

[01:08:05] All right, you're in Spain man. I don't know man. I don't know

[01:08:11] I mean, I guess I guess you have to be rich in Europe to buy pimp don't you have to be like really rich in Europe to buy pimp all machines

[01:08:20] Don't you I mean I feel like yeah, man. You think you need like you need like a few mill

[01:08:25] You're a bit stupid like I just couldn't buy something in a region

[01:08:30] Knowing that if I was anywhere else in the world it would be so much cheaper

[01:08:36] You

[01:08:40] Man

[01:08:41] Man, I mean, I feel like Olaf though like I feel like it's just gonna hurt

[01:08:46] It's gonna hurt man because Olaf how much do you have to buy your CE for

[01:08:50] Like how like is it like 18 19,000 dollars? How much is it if you live in Spain

[01:08:57] To unbox MS unbox at retail in avatar. Yeah, what's the VAT tax brother?

[01:09:06] I don't pay that why don't you pay that

[01:09:12] Well, how are you avoiding that 21 present VAT

[01:09:24] I have a friend distro so is your is your distro friend

[01:09:29] Is he is he breaking the law?

[01:09:33] You know, I'm just curious like how can he give you that at that price?

[01:09:45] But the distro has to pay the VAT tax

[01:09:50] All right, so I think what's so you okay, so here's what's happening here's what's happening

[01:09:55] Olaf is paying in cash

[01:09:58] His

[01:09:59] distro has to pay the VAT tax to take the product like there's no you the distro has to pay it

[01:10:06] So basically, I think what's happening is Olaf

[01:10:09] Is basically getting a game at cost because I bet with VAT tax

[01:10:15] The distros probably spending somewhere around 15,000 dollars

[01:10:20] To get the game then does the markup right because he has to do the VAT markup and also his margin

[01:10:26] So it sounds like you're getting a game where the distro is not getting any margin

[01:10:32] Or profit. They're just selling you a game at cost for cash

[01:10:41] Um, all that being said Olaf

[01:10:44] All that being said

[01:10:46] The game is pretty bad

[01:10:48] It's just like such a I don't know man

[01:10:52] You know, you don't really see do you guys see markside in anywhere?

[01:10:56] Do you do you feel like they've also like do you see mark like doing streams getting people excited?

[01:11:02] Is it is that happening anywhere?

[01:11:05] I mean, that's the one thing I'm surprised about I feel like even Jersey Jack is like just forget it like they they've moved on

[01:11:13] And I'm surprised like marks a good guy is a nice guy like I just don't see him out and about

[01:11:19] Trying to drum up excitement for his own game

[01:11:23] Isn't that weird? It's like it's like they're only game for sale right now and

[01:11:30] They really haven't I don't know that it's like you can tell like they spend a hundred thousand dollars on a launch video

[01:11:39] A hundred thousand dollars on a launch video and

[01:11:43] You know, they haven't really followed it up with much

[01:11:48] Yeah, Jack danger, you know, I spoke to Jack the other day

[01:11:53] It's just a brutal thing happening around X-Men right if you if you're following the X-Men conversation

[01:12:00] It's just brutal nobody feels good about it

[01:12:05] Still trying to unload G and R is um

[01:12:10] You know, it's it's um

[01:12:15] I'm coming to TPF in March dude don't oh, I trust me oh, I'll do this do this

[01:12:20] Oh, I don't fly from Spain to

[01:12:26] Texas

[01:12:28] Fly to New York City brother. I'll pick you up. We'll go to Tommy Jazz and

[01:12:33] The game will be out. We'll play the game

[01:12:37] It automated

[01:12:40] Or we'll do this fly to Chicago and ask to see the game at JJP. I want to go all the way to T. I'll tell you why man

[01:12:48] It's like

[01:12:50] It sucks seeing a new game at a show

[01:12:54] It sucks

[01:12:56] You know the fact that Stern invited all those media to play D&D

[01:13:00] and then

[01:13:01] Put them all in a room together with 20 people talking over your shoulder

[01:13:07] All the games were on at the same time. It was the stupidest media moment. I've ever seen in pinball because it's like

[01:13:14] All those media paid money

[01:13:15] I talked to Colin they spent more than five six hundred dollars out of their own pocket

[01:13:20] To go sit in a room with 20 other dudes all talking

[01:13:26] To play a game that they couldn't really hear very well

[01:13:30] What what how is that a great first impression of a game

[01:13:34] And when you go to a show I would rather go to TPF than New York City

[01:13:40] um

[01:13:41] Yeah, because what you'd rather be in a

[01:13:44] uh

[01:13:45] middle of nowhere where it's just like strip malls

[01:13:49] a peri stay-couse across the street and

[01:13:52] like

[01:13:53] Anyone who says they'd rather go to TPF in New York City is uh culturally broken

[01:14:00] Seriously, how could you like why would you want to be stuck in like this like

[01:14:06] middle of nowhere

[01:14:08] There's nothing to do

[01:14:11] That's always been my issue with like TPF man is like all the shows like you after like a few hours

[01:14:18] You're kind of like

[01:14:19] You're exhausted

[01:14:21] Playing the games is not that much fun because of how loud it is

[01:14:25] And you just kind of are over it. I look I think shows

[01:14:29] I think shows

[01:14:30] kind of um

[01:14:32] I wish they figured out a different way to do shows

[01:14:35] And here's what I mean by that I wish that

[01:14:39] I wish that

[01:14:40] There was an opportunity to like have everybody together but also have

[01:14:46] Gameplay experiences that were much more

[01:14:49] enjoyable than they are at a show

[01:14:54] Look, I like peri stay-couse gang. I mean it's fine. It's it's it's not

[01:15:00] You know, it's it's always where I did my happy hours. It's it like there's nothing better in that vicinity

[01:15:07] but

[01:15:08] You know Wolfgang's in New York City on 33rd Street blows it away blows it away

[01:15:15] blows it away you get to have dinner

[01:15:17] In vendor builds private subway station think about how cool that is like

[01:15:23] vendor built was so rich. He had his own train station with his own like

[01:15:29] Stop that only he could get on and they built the steakhouse inside it

[01:15:35] That's cool

[01:15:37] Peri stay-couse

[01:15:40] Just another one

[01:15:48] What do we got here I'm reading the chat

[01:15:51] Yeah, like I just think um

[01:15:57] Now look everything's not the best in New York City and also like I'll be the first to tell you right now in New York City is like kind of going

[01:16:03] It's going

[01:16:05] It sucks now like compared to what it used to be

[01:16:08] Eric Adams is a terrible mayor

[01:16:11] The um

[01:16:12] The democratic city

[01:16:14] Has been run into the ground and it's terrible now

[01:16:18] You know what what sucks about New York City now is they've completely

[01:16:22] After all the social movements after the defun police New York City has turned into

[01:16:28] Not that much of an enjoyable place anymore. I mean it they and then they allowed all these

[01:16:33] Weed stores to pop up everywhere and the Nobel it's really the Nobel policy is what has killed New York City

[01:16:42] once they did Nobel and they let everybody

[01:16:46] Who can commit a crime or do something like they they you know it's crazy

[01:16:54] About

[01:16:56] About the Democrats, okay, and I'm not like a crazy Republican, but you know it's crazy about the Democrats

[01:17:02] They actually think that

[01:17:05] Like no bail is like a fair thing to do like right

[01:17:10] They're actually on the side of the criminals

[01:17:14] Because guess what

[01:17:16] You don't need to get bail if you don't commit a crime

[01:17:20] And you know what they've also done is they they want to decriminalize like think about this for a minute

[01:17:25] They want to decriminalize shoplifting

[01:17:29] Just think about that for a minute

[01:17:31] You want to decriminalize

[01:17:34] People walking into drugstores and bodegas

[01:17:38] And not protect those business owners from shoplifting

[01:17:44] That is what kills cities and that's what kills

[01:17:48] Your that's what's gonna kill them in the elections. I'm telling you all this stuff doesn't work out

[01:17:54] And so then you know when you live in sort of the belly of the

[01:17:58] You know

[01:18:00] Democratic run environments how poorly there they're they operate it's like come on gang like this is silly

[01:18:09] It's silly

[01:18:13] You could push someone on to the subway tracks

[01:18:17] And if you have no priors

[01:18:20] You'll be out on the street in the same day

[01:18:23] same day

[01:18:25] You know anyway a crazy guy that went around stabbing people midtown man had and he was like

[01:18:30] arrested 17 times

[01:18:32] 17 times

[01:18:34] How's he on the street

[01:18:37] Anyway

[01:18:38] You know for the city for me is I

[01:18:44] I

[01:18:45] I go in I go to work I go to tell me jazz I go home

[01:18:50] I'm not like I don't venture around anymore. I don't try restaurants

[01:18:55] I don't care

[01:18:57] I don't really don't care

[01:18:59] It'll come back the city will come back

[01:19:02] We just need a better mayor the best mayor since I've been in New York city was was most bloomberg

[01:19:07] Bloomberg's the man

[01:19:09] He's the man

[01:19:11] He um, you know he he knew how to run a city he knew how to

[01:19:17] Keep New York clean keep it safe

[01:19:19] Guess guess what guess what makes a city safe

[01:19:23] The police

[01:19:26] Guess what you gotta get rid of the people

[01:19:30] That make a city bad

[01:19:33] You know what juliana he did

[01:19:35] I mean he really is the reason why the city became what it is

[01:19:39] They bought one way plane tickets for all the homeless people and they put them on a plane somewhere else

[01:19:46] I don't know what you do with everybody. I don't I don't have the you know the answers to social

[01:19:51] um, you know

[01:19:53] Social welfare, but like I I don't know, you know

[01:19:56] You sent them to LA

[01:19:58] awesome

[01:20:00] But some yeah, just holding anyway

[01:20:08] I'm burdened yeah, where is umperding?

[01:20:11] Where is umperding when you need him?

[01:20:15] Oh, man, this fire is a terrible. I really feel for anyone. I have um a co-worker whose friend is staying with her

[01:20:22] They lost their house and it is absolutely

[01:20:26] So devastating to see the footage and to see the people that are

[01:20:31] Displaced and you know and it's not

[01:20:34] It's it's it's like entire

[01:20:38] Neighborhoods are wiped out everything gone school the school you went to the house you grew up in

[01:20:45] The movie theater the you know

[01:20:49] It is it is

[01:20:50] Look, I you know, I don't I don't think anything could have fully prevented it

[01:20:54] You know clearly they weren't fully prepared for this with all the money there

[01:20:58] Do you see like Paris Hilton like I just saw like images of her house. Do you see the house from uh

[01:21:04] The house from

[01:21:07] That was in secession the $150 million mansion on the hills like that beautiful house. It's the one where you know

[01:21:13] The brothers in in the last season where he's thinking about starting his own news corporation

[01:21:18] It's gone like the whole thing is just rubble

[01:21:23] I've never seen anything like it and you know they said the damages are upwards of 50 billion

[01:21:29] But like you can't even replace this stuff if then if any of us lost our homes and may we never have to deal with that

[01:21:36] You can't replace you can't replace this stuff

[01:21:40] It's it's it's a it's hell on earth

[01:21:44] It will make you a spiritual person absolutely

[01:21:48] um

[01:21:50] You know so

[01:21:52] Everybody look

[01:21:54] What is it January 11th?

[01:21:57] Isn't it nuts that we might see Harry Potter in just six weeks? I can't I don't know like it just it even feels like are we gonna see Harry Potter and March

[01:22:07] Like that's gonna be upon us very soon

[01:22:11] I feel like the game's been done for a while I keep forgetting that like Eric Minier's last game

[01:22:17] He probably finished in like a weekend right godfather

[01:22:21] I feel like I feel like you do that thing together is like yeah, man. I'm done like let me get on the Harry Potter

[01:22:28] I hope Harry Potter is a wide body we'll see

[01:22:38] Well, I don't really care about two JJPs a year I just I just want a good JJP

[01:22:47] All right, everybody look we're um, I know we've had some bathroom breaks

[01:22:55] It's football wild card weekend that's gonna be fun

[01:23:02] Like Jack is absolutely gonna get Harry Potter out before King Kong King Kong's not really scheduled until if we look at normal stern

[01:23:12] You know, it's like three four it's like three months three like we we shouldn't

[01:23:20] April May for Kong

[01:23:24] April May

[01:23:26] Um, I think um, I think Kong's gonna be awesome

[01:23:33] Do you think packer Jeremy's on Kong? I do

[01:23:36] I

[01:23:39] If there's a big gorilla with big hands and he like

[01:23:45] I think Kong could be beautiful if it's I think what I'm what I'm what what I think is gonna be challenging with Kong

[01:23:54] Is nailing the narrative

[01:23:57] Let me end the show on this because here's here's the thing about King Kong that I hope they get right and I'm worried

[01:24:03] They're gonna not get it right

[01:24:06] Kong I think where I think they're gonna go with Kong is I think they're gonna be

[01:24:11] It's gonna be like

[01:24:13] Godzilla

[01:24:15] 2.0 I think they're gonna keep the game primarily on skull island

[01:24:21] And Kong battling the different creatures sort of like Godzilla with his battles

[01:24:27] I don't want really that King Kong

[01:24:32] What I would love it is

[01:24:35] A game that is like

[01:24:38] Some of that

[01:24:39] But I also think you need to get King Kong to New York City

[01:24:46] And I think you need to have Kong

[01:24:49] climb the Empire State Building

[01:24:51] And I think you need to have King Kong

[01:24:55] Fall

[01:24:57] And I think you need to have him fall in love with the blonde and I think you need to have

[01:25:02] You know, there's some of those moments in Kong that are just

[01:25:05] Beautiful and then that's to see to me the only

[01:25:09] The only like

[01:25:11] seen in Peter Jackson's King Kong that I feel like captured that like that tragedy of this

[01:25:17] This ape that just wants to get back home. I mean that's the story of King Kong

[01:25:22] He just wants to get back home and the Empire State Building reminds him of his home

[01:25:30] You know up on the mountain the tall is peak and so

[01:25:34] There's a scene in Peter Jackson's

[01:25:37] King Kong where

[01:25:39] He ends up in Central Park and they're like ice skating and he's like having fun on the ice

[01:25:45] With with the woman and it's just it's like those beautiful moments

[01:25:50] juxtapose

[01:25:52] To the the you know the terrifying moments for Kong where they're trying to kill him and cage him and

[01:25:58] And take him away from his home. So I don't know you know, I don't know what they're gonna do

[01:26:03] I don't know what they're gonna um

[01:26:05] How they're gonna execute it

[01:26:08] But there is just

[01:26:10] There's it's a lot more difficult. I think with Kong than it is with

[01:26:15] Godzilla to get it right

[01:26:17] I'm a little worried that they're gonna go more modern like Kong is like you know monster and just blah blah

[01:26:23] Like you know just Kong and Godzilla like I think it's I think they might just go that route

[01:26:28] Um, but that's not you know the iconic calm anyway everybody look

[01:26:34] Have a great have a great Saturday

[01:26:38] Thank you all for hanging out. Don't forget to vote in the twiffies
