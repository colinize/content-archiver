[00:00] When I do get the permits, how long will the job take?

[00:03] Two weeks.

[00:04] Two weeks? Two weeks?

[00:06] Do you sound like a parakeet there?

[00:08] Two weeks? Two weeks?

[00:09] Well, two weeks.

[00:12] It's amazing.

[00:14] It's amazing nothing.

[00:15] It'll be a regular miracle.

[00:25] There's nothing quite like a Monday after the Super Bowl.

[00:29] I really think this should be a national holiday.

[00:31] Nobody wants to go to work today.

[00:34] Nobody.

[00:35] I congratulate the Heinz organization on giving all what, like,

[00:39] 42,000 employees the day off today,

[00:42] instead of airing a Super Bowl commercial.

[00:45] What a game, though, right?

[00:47] Unbelievable.

[00:48] I bet on the Patriots.

[00:50] So I spent about three and a half hours in agony.

[00:55] And then I couldn't believe it.

[00:56] Wow.

[00:57] What an interesting and incredible way

[01:00] to secure the dynasty that is Brady and Bellicuk, right?

[01:04] I've never seen anything like that.

[01:06] And what a collapse by Atlanta.

[01:08] How do you not run the ball after that amazing Julius Jones

[01:13] catch it, like the 21 yard line?

[01:15] How do you not just run the ball three times

[01:16] and kick a field goal and win the Super Bowl?

[01:18] Unbelievable that the coaching has helped the Patriots win

[01:22] the last two Super Bowls.

[01:24] But you're not listening to Canadian's pinball podcast

[01:27] to hear me talk about sports.

[01:28] You want to talk about pinball.

[01:30] Now, what I found funny yesterday is

[01:32] while I was watching the game, I get a text message from someone

[01:36] and said, it said two weeks.

[01:38] Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:39] I can't believe he said it again.

[01:41] And I was just like, what?

[01:43] Like what happened?

[01:45] And so apparently there has been a lot of conversation

[01:50] going on in the alien thread.

[01:52] And we talked a lot about this.

[01:55] The last couple podcast I've been discussing,

[01:59] what I believe to be is just the topic

[02:02] of asking the hard questions when it comes to pinball

[02:05] manufacturers.

[02:06] And I'm always just intrigued by the way

[02:08] people behave in the threads and on the forum

[02:11] when it comes to believing what pinball manufacturers tell us.

[02:17] Now, I'm just going to step back before I jump into two weeks

[02:21] in highway pinball and what happened again on Sunday.

[02:25] I just want to step back and say that out of all the hobbies

[02:28] I'm into, out of all the different companies and brands

[02:32] I follow, I don't think I've ever experienced more of a larger

[02:39] group of disingenuous, dishonest all over the place,

[02:45] never get, you know, tell you the actual truth,

[02:49] lack of transparency companies that I do in the pinball world.

[02:52] Now, if I were to rank these companies in sort of order

[02:57] of being most trustworthy, most transparent,

[03:02] most honest, at the top of the list is spooky.

[03:06] I mean, these guys continue to impress me with just being

[03:11] the only company out there that doesn't seem like they're

[03:14] trying to rip people off, that doesn't make a bunch

[03:17] of false promises that never takes people's money early on

[03:23] without delivering something and never, ever, ever would spin.

[03:29] Right? And the word spin is really interesting

[03:31] because I work in PR and PR people typically get accused

[03:35] of being spin doctors and constantly saying stuff that's not

[03:38] accurate just to buy time.

[03:40] And I think we see so much of that in pinball where we either

[03:45] hear nothing or we hear a bunch of spin and rhetoric that

[03:47] doesn't really mean anything.

[03:49] So spooky is incredible.

[03:50] I think they're great.

[03:53] It's then when you go to second place of this list of like,

[03:56] who do you really trust in the pinball manufacturing world

[03:59] in terms of companies?

[04:00] Who's number two?

[04:02] After spooky, who would you say is number two?

[04:07] Dutch pinball?

[04:08] No way.

[04:09] I mean, look at Dutch recently.

[04:10] They've just gone completely radio silence

[04:14] on all the people waiting on their pins.

[04:16] And it's been months and there's nothing, no correspondence,

[04:20] shame on them, right?

[04:22] Let's go to Jersey Jack pinball.

[04:26] I don't know.

[04:27] I think you do know, right?

[04:29] I think we all agree that Jack is a salesman.

[04:34] And he spins like nobody else.

[04:37] He spins like nobody else.

[04:39] And even though every time he says something, usually the complete

[04:43] opposite happens, right?

[04:44] We're not going to show Pat Lawler's new machine until it's

[04:46] done.

[04:46] And you can order it that day.

[04:48] And it's shipping.

[04:49] What happened?

[04:49] He shows it six months earlier, eight months earlier.

[04:52] OK, went against his word there.

[04:54] We're not going to take any more pre-order money on machines.

[04:57] The next game is like, you buy it when it's ready.

[05:01] He's taking pre-orders undial then.

[05:03] And then we go through the whole collector's edition thing.

[05:05] Again, all this stuff, right?

[05:07] It's like these aren't like crimes against humanity, right?

[05:12] This is the thing too.

[05:13] It's like as much as we get upset about how these companies

[05:16] behave in today's culture and today's world with everything

[05:19] that's going on in the world, all this seems like trivial bullshit.

[05:23] And it is trivial bullshit.

[05:24] But you come to this podcast and you go on to pinball forums

[05:28] because you want to escape the horrors that are waiting for us

[05:32] out in the real world.

[05:34] The real issues facing this world, and we're complaining

[05:37] about collectors' editions are going

[05:40] to not be the only special edition Jersey Jack makes.

[05:43] I mean, say that to your friends at a bar

[05:45] and prepare to get slapped in the fucking face

[05:48] for how out of touch we are with everything

[05:51] else going on in the world.

[05:52] So Jersey Jack, nope.

[05:55] Who else is next?

[05:56] Let's see, PPS, Planetary Pimball and Rick.

[05:59] I mean, no way.

[06:01] Another organization that had problems with the ink

[06:06] on medieval madness, and then they were lying to people.

[06:09] Then they didn't really have a fix.

[06:11] And his customer service has been pretty horrendous.

[06:15] Let's get to Stern because I know Stern always gets slammed.

[06:18] I would consider Stern to be number two

[06:21] and on the list of companies that at least gets back to you,

[06:25] at least communicates to you.

[06:27] I know KPG, I can hear you screaming into your speaker.

[06:32] We know there are certain individuals

[06:34] that Stern does blacklist and treat like lepreah patients,

[06:40] but for the most part, and everyone I talk to,

[06:43] when they have a problem with Stern,

[06:45] they have a problem with a new inbox machine.

[06:47] There is at least someone to pick up the phone on the other end,

[06:50] and they can work to get any issue solved.

[06:53] And also, let's be honest here,

[06:55] Stern doesn't miss release dates very often.

[06:58] And if they do, it's by a period of maybe at most,

[07:03] a few months, we're not talking a few years.

[07:06] And also, when was the last time Stern was like,

[07:09] pay and fall, but you're not going to get a machine for years,

[07:13] or even months, people paid and fall in Batman,

[07:15] and they had their Batman in December, January.

[07:18] So I think Stern is good.

[07:20] It doesn't excuse Stern from all the other issues I think they do.

[07:25] I think they do ship product with quality issues,

[07:28] and they know that the quality issues are there,

[07:31] and they still ship it to consumers.

[07:32] I have problems with that.

[07:34] Who else is out there?

[07:35] P3, Jerry too soon.

[07:37] Jerry really hasn't had his games out there.

[07:40] They're supposed to be going out in a few months,

[07:42] so we'll see how he handles customer service moving forward.

[07:45] I know I'm missing someone.

[07:48] Spooky, JJP, Dutch, highway.

[07:51] Let's end it highway, because I want to talk about highway on this.

[07:54] And this is the reason why I was hit up during the Super Bowl.

[07:59] So I've joked in the past.

[08:01] I've joked in the past that Andrew Highway always says two weeks.

[08:06] He always uses two weeks as when you can expect things to be fixed.

[08:12] It's always like his go to for the solution will happen in two weeks.

[08:16] You're going to hear good news in two weeks.

[08:18] And that's why we have that great clip from Tom Hanks in the money pit,

[08:22] where all the contractors promise him two weeks.

[08:24] And I almost was dying laughing, because even after I've been sort of

[08:29] making fun of the whole two week thing in Andrew,

[08:33] I would have thought by now someone would go to him and say,

[08:36] Andrew, look, man, there's this like, you know,

[08:39] canada, he's got this little podcast.

[08:41] He keeps saying that every time you're trying to mislead people

[08:46] or set their expectations falsely, you keep saying two weeks.

[08:49] Maybe you shouldn't say two weeks.

[08:50] Maybe you should just like say, we'll give you an update when we know, right?

[08:54] No, because two weeks gives people expectations and hopes

[08:58] for a resolution within that time period.

[09:02] So how did he use two weeks in this context?

[09:04] So we're talking about, and I've been beating this drama.

[09:06] I'm saying, look, I don't understand why

[09:10] Ellie owners aren't demanding to see the Ellie artwork

[09:15] and what they're getting for their money.

[09:17] And I think it's a fair point.

[09:19] It's February of 2017.

[09:21] And if you haven't seen the Ellie package,

[09:23] I think it's kind of unfair that he's asking for people's money.

[09:26] So this is what Andrew said yesterday.

[09:31] And I don't even know why anyone was on Pinside yesterday, guys.

[09:34] You should be watching the Super Bowl.

[09:36] So he wrote, someone asked, Andrew,

[09:40] any ETA on Ellie artwork, I know some are getting restless.

[09:44] Is there any issue with Ellie art or just life

[09:47] and they're taking their time?

[09:49] Hopefully ease the minds of those concerned.

[09:52] So Andrew writes in and says,

[09:54] we expect to be able to show Ellie art within two weeks.

[09:59] If this date shifts, then I will report it here.

[10:02] Needless to say, we must have full approval

[10:05] before we can ship Ellie games.

[10:07] So we are going through the due process as a priority.

[10:10] I hope that doesn't sound too vague.

[10:12] It just so happens that the Ellie art

[10:14] is the last piece of this puzzle.

[10:16] OK, so why?

[10:19] I read that.

[10:20] I'm like, why does he always do this?

[10:24] He doesn't know when it's going to get approved.

[10:28] So to say, we expect to hear within two weeks.

[10:31] To me, is a little mind bogging.

[10:33] And let me explain why.

[10:35] What date is it, ladies and gentlemen?

[10:37] What date is it?

[10:39] It is February, what is it?

[10:41] Fifth or sixth?

[10:43] February 6, of 2017.

[10:46] The alien artwork, the art that we saw on regular alien.

[10:51] We saw it back.

[10:53] I want to say, wasn't it like it was before August?

[10:57] What?

[10:57] June, July?

[10:58] But I didn't think it was before then.

[10:59] It was almost like a year ago that he showed

[11:03] Orrick's play field and the art package for the machine.

[11:08] OK, so my question is this.

[11:10] And this is my question to Andrew, to Orrick,

[11:12] to all the you guys following in on alien.

[11:16] When was the Ellie artwork submitted?

[11:19] When was it submitted?

[11:20] Can someone ask that question for me on the thread?

[11:23] Can someone also ask?

[11:25] If it was submitted just recently, why?

[11:29] Why?

[11:30] Why was it submitted so late when these games,

[11:34] if you go back and you remember what Andrew said,

[11:38] these games were promised to be out by Expo,

[11:42] then promised to be out by November.

[11:46] He said, you'd have your games by Thanksgiving.

[11:48] Then he said, we're going to make 30 games in December

[11:52] with 100 Ellie's going out in January.

[11:56] So if he promised 100 Ellie's to go out in January,

[12:00] and he made that promise back in December,

[12:03] did he not have Ellie artwork approval

[12:05] when he made that promise?

[12:07] Do you see what I'm trying to do here, ladies and gentlemen?

[12:09] And it's just present a case of the facts.

[12:13] This is not my opinion.

[12:14] None of this is me editorializing any of this.

[12:17] None of this is me dramatizing this.

[12:20] All I am doing is stating what he's said over the last few months.

[12:26] And how quick everyone is to just believe what he says.

[12:31] And the reason why I started out this podcast

[12:34] with my belief that these manufacturers aren't honest

[12:39] and they're not transparent.

[12:42] I just don't get it.

[12:43] Yes, the answer he gave was incredibly vague.

[12:47] And yes, the answer or a gave was also incredibly vague.

[12:51] And what vagueness does, and all it does,

[12:54] is it opens the door to speculation.

[12:57] And we all know that speculation is really where

[13:02] drama gets born.

[13:04] It's where anxiety gets born.

[13:06] It's the well that people go to when they're afraid.

[13:10] They speculate on why.

[13:12] Why isn't the Ellie artwork approved?

[13:15] So if you're not going to tell me or tell your customers

[13:18] directly why there still is no Ellie artwork approved,

[13:23] then people are going to speculate.

[13:25] And so my mind, as Canadian's mind,

[13:28] I tend to go into not dramatic places,

[13:32] but I would assume that Fox approval on this artwork,

[13:38] remember, this is not like New Playfield artwork.

[13:40] This is just this side cabinet inserts

[13:44] and the back box, not much has to go into it.

[13:47] And I guarantee you, when you see the Ellie artwork,

[13:51] you're not going to really see this tremendously different art

[13:55] package.

[13:56] And you're going to scratch your head and wonder why it took so long.

[14:00] So if I were to guess, and I'm going to speculate,

[14:03] because this is what these guys do, they make a speculate.

[14:06] I'm going to say that maybe, maybe Orrick

[14:09] didn't do the Ellie artwork months ago when he said he did,

[14:14] because maybe he's kind of wise up and understood

[14:17] that he hasn't been paid.

[14:20] And he's put a lot of hours into this project.

[14:23] And I would say he's learned the ultimate lesson

[14:26] that you never do work for free.

[14:28] You never do work on the promise of getting a machine.

[14:31] And that's what he did.

[14:32] So he got promised an alien Ellie, and now

[14:34] has done all this work.

[14:36] And hasn't seen a dime, hasn't seen a game,

[14:39] and he's still not only is he still doing work on it,

[14:44] but he's still got to now take all the arrows from people.

[14:48] And we saw him get into a back and forth with Iceman,

[14:51] which we're going to talk about.

[14:53] Wasn't even back and forth, Iceman's response to,

[14:56] or we're going to talk a little about that in a second.

[14:58] But I know Orrick.

[15:00] I know the kind of guy he is.

[15:01] He's passionate.

[15:03] He's creative.

[15:04] He has a tendency to be a dick, and he knows that.

[15:07] And he goes too far.

[15:08] And he says critical things.

[15:10] And I get it.

[15:11] And then he gets critiqued.

[15:12] And he realizes it's just not worth it.

[15:15] It's not worth it.

[15:16] And I understand what he goes through,

[15:17] because I go through the same thing.

[15:19] It's like you can get too into stuff.

[15:21] And you can say things that go too far.

[15:24] And then you're going to get criticized.

[15:25] And then it just doesn't become fun.

[15:27] You're in this hobby that's about a toy.

[15:30] And you're in personal disputes with people.

[15:32] And so I think he's just ready for this chapter to be over.

[15:35] So maybe he said, look, Andrew, I'm not

[15:38] doing the early artwork until you finish the fucking machine.

[15:43] I can bang this artwork out in a weekend.

[15:45] And we know we can.

[15:46] We know that this is not, again, this

[15:48] is not going to be a big hand-drawn, whole new,

[15:52] trans-like kind of thing.

[15:54] He's going to use the asses he has.

[15:56] And he's going to make a little bit

[15:56] of a different alien package.

[15:59] And so we know he can do that pretty quickly.

[16:02] And so I bet maybe he held it back

[16:04] until Highway showed some progress.

[16:07] Maybe he submitted it months ago.

[16:11] And then the question becomes, well, then why didn't Andrew

[16:14] give it to Fox for approval?

[16:16] Now, my speculation there is, I think Andrew maybe

[16:21] is being dishonest about Fox approval still holding it up.

[16:26] And I think he's falling back on Fox approval far too many times

[16:31] for my taste.

[16:32] And I think he hides behind that because it buys him time.

[16:36] And I've said this.

[16:37] And I think this is, when I think about all the things

[16:40] that I speculate around, the lack of early art,

[16:43] I still think Andrew's hiding behind Fox approval

[16:47] because he knows when he shows you the early art package,

[16:50] it's not going to blow you away.

[16:52] It's not going to be the big difference

[16:54] that people expect from an early package.

[16:57] And because of that, and because Andrew's silly,

[17:00] a silly decision by him months ago, if that years ago,

[17:04] he's basically allowing you to upgrade everything

[17:07] from an alien standard to an elderly.

[17:10] You can buy the light at ramps, I believe.

[17:12] You can buy the, you know, you can buy the translates.

[17:15] You can buy the beacons.

[17:16] Like he's going to sell you everything.

[17:17] So the elderly doesn't really mean anything.

[17:19] If you allow people to turn their standards

[17:22] into elderly is pretty easily.

[17:23] So I think he's worried that if he shows it,

[17:27] people are going to downgrade from an elderly to a standard

[17:31] and he can't afford that right now.

[17:33] So look, again, I can be wildly off.

[17:36] But I do want people to ask those questions,

[17:38] which is when did you submit it?

[17:41] And that's it.

[17:42] Ask when he submitted it.

[17:44] And how long does it typically take Fox?

[17:46] And why can't we see anything when you said that?

[17:49] And when Orrick said the artwork for the elderly

[17:51] would be quick to do.

[17:52] And he said that like eight months ago.

[17:54] So those are just questions.

[17:56] Those are just questions.

[17:58] And I think as long as people continue

[18:01] to create this environment on Pinside where you can't

[18:04] ask those questions, you just got to like just go with it.

[18:07] Just go with it.

[18:08] Anya, do I think that Highway Pimball is the same as J-Pop

[18:12] or Kevin?

[18:13] No, I don't think that at all.

[18:15] Do I want people to get burned on Highway Pimball?

[18:18] No, I don't want people to not get their games.

[18:21] I don't want Highway Pimball to fail.

[18:24] As much as I have personal issues with some

[18:27] of the people over there, I do think

[18:29] Moa Pimball is good for the hobby.

[18:32] I think that making Pimball is extremely hard.

[18:35] And if you're not a good businessman

[18:36] and you don't know how to run a business properly,

[18:39] the last business you'll succeed at is Pimball.

[18:44] A product that requires 2800 parts to work together

[18:48] harmoniously, a factory, a line, workers, all the parts

[18:53] coming from all these different places.

[18:55] If you're not smart at business, I don't think

[18:56] you're going to succeed.

[18:58] And yes, I think as what I've seen of Andrew Highway

[19:03] over the past few months, it makes me question

[19:06] his business acumen.

[19:07] And I don't think that's unfair.

[19:10] I don't think it's unfair to ask that of any businessman

[19:12] whose product is so delayed.

[19:14] But look, look, you wake up.

[19:17] It's a Monday.

[19:18] We all got to enjoy a great football game.

[19:22] I want to turn a chapter with this game

[19:25] and get some real updates and the products out to people.

[19:29] And I hope people get their product.

[19:32] Now, what I saw Iceman do over the week,

[19:34] and I want to talk a little bit about that,

[19:36] because he listens to this podcast.

[19:37] And I talked to him personally on text messages.

[19:40] And I was telling him before, he's like, look, man,

[19:42] you should be a little careful with your money here.

[19:44] I'm not necessarily sure.

[19:45] It's like a 100% deal here.

[19:48] And it seems he got drunk.

[19:49] And he was beating the Ellie artwork

[19:51] drum and then Org chimed in and made some,

[19:53] you know, Org, honestly, I think what Org does to people,

[19:57] and he is polarizing.

[19:58] He made some little political comment

[19:59] about what's going on in the country.

[20:01] And I get it.

[20:01] Like, I live in New York City.

[20:04] I was raised pretty moderate.

[20:05] My parents are definitely more Republican than liberal.

[20:09] I'm very socially liberal.

[20:11] I'm very fiscally conservative.

[20:13] I consider myself to be a moderate.

[20:15] I don't like what's going on in the country politically

[20:18] at all.

[20:19] And like Donald Org Hillary.

[20:20] And I think a lot of people feel that way.

[20:24] But when Org came on there and was whining like a baby

[20:27] because he got three down votes,

[20:29] I think that rubbed people the wrong way.

[20:30] It's like, you can't do what you do, Org.

[20:33] You know you're a polarizing figure.

[20:34] And you can't ask for universal support.

[20:37] It'd be like Kaneda asking for everyone to like me.

[20:39] I know people out there are just annoyed and disgusted by me.

[20:42] And you also have to accept you're

[20:44] going to get some of that feedback.

[20:46] So I wouldn't take it personally.

[20:47] But he takes it personally, right?

[20:49] And he puts up a little political comment.

[20:51] And Iceman says, because of that,

[20:53] this is like the most polarizing project that he's out.

[20:57] And clearly he was drunk because he came on later

[20:59] and said he was drinking.

[20:59] And that's why he did it.

[21:01] Now, what's a shame here is when I heard Iceman flipping back

[21:04] and forth over this issue is I thought Iceman was beating

[21:08] the proper drum of asking the tough questions.

[21:11] And now he's fought the back.

[21:12] And I know Andrew called them and said

[21:14] he'd give him a refund immediately.

[21:15] And I thought that was the right thing for Andrew to do.

[21:18] I thought if Andrew stalled on Iceman's refund,

[21:21] that would have really sent shockwaves

[21:24] through the whole thread and everyone else is waiting.

[21:26] Because we know that Iceman is very vocal.

[21:30] When he's on your side, he's on your side.

[21:32] But when he's campaigning against you,

[21:33] God help your soul.

[21:35] They God have mercy on your soul.

[21:37] And we saw that with J-Pop.

[21:39] We saw that with Kevin.

[21:42] And look, Ice, I know you love the theme.

[21:45] I want you to get your game.

[21:46] I really, I'm not going to come on here and say,

[21:48] you made a mistake.

[21:49] Look, Alien's a great theme.

[21:52] Alien is a tremendous theme.

[21:53] It is one of the greatest themes you

[21:56] can make a pinball machine out of.

[21:58] When I look down at Highways Alien, Pinball Machine,

[22:02] do I see the famous movies that I love?

[22:06] I don't see it all there.

[22:08] I kind of wish for a little bit more of a 70s gritty sci-fi

[22:11] field at all.

[22:12] It all does feel very Sega data.

[22:14] It's easy to me, shiny, colorful, glossy.

[22:16] That doesn't feel like Alien to me.

[22:20] But it doesn't mean the game's not going to be fun.

[22:23] It doesn't mean people are not going

[22:25] to have a good time with their Alien Pinball machines.

[22:27] What it means is we have to play it.

[22:29] And I think we're all at that stage.

[22:31] I really want it to ship.

[22:33] Ice, you're back on board.

[22:34] But again, I think over the next couple months,

[22:37] you guys are going to have to ask the hard questions here

[22:39] and make sure you're happy with your answers.

[22:43] And that's all I hope to see.

[22:45] Kaneda's not here to try and go on crusades

[22:47] to bring down companies.

[22:49] And as I told Andrew, I can't hurt your company, Andrew.

[22:54] All I will do in this, I think in all fairness,

[22:56] I've done this, is I'll present the facts.

[22:59] If you're going to say something, I'm going to simply

[23:02] hold you to what you say.

[23:03] And I think this podcast has done that job fairly.

[23:08] I have simply held Andrew to his own words.

[23:11] And I hope that all manufacturers understand

[23:15] that we're going to hold you accountable on this show

[23:19] to what you say.

[23:20] And that's why I want to change gears a little bit

[23:25] and talk about American Pinball for a second.

[23:28] Because I think these guys have gotten a little bit away

[23:33] with staying true to their word as well.

[23:35] And I didn't bring them up when I was talking about the different

[23:37] companies.

[23:39] But these guys have a new game who Dini, they're working

[23:43] on that's all new.

[23:44] But they really have a responsibility

[23:46] to come out and explain what is going on with Magic Girl

[23:50] and J-Pop.

[23:52] And look, I know some stuff that a lot of you

[23:55] don't know around this whole thing.

[23:56] But I think the time is coming now where they need to start

[23:58] communicating that.

[24:00] And I don't break confidentiality that I make

[24:04] with certain people.

[24:06] Yes, I did break a little bit of when people

[24:10] are just sending me all sorts of stuff

[24:12] about highway pinball, like his ex employees and whatnot.

[24:16] Honestly, I have no desire to allow certain individuals

[24:20] to try and go out and harm a company

[24:23] and then not want to stand behind their statements.

[24:26] I'm not going to be the middleman, the patsy for people,

[24:29] to just use me as a microphone if they have issues.

[24:34] Then say something.

[24:35] If any ex employee at any of these companies

[24:38] wants to say something about their employer,

[24:40] they're happy to come on this show and talk about it.

[24:43] But if you want to just mail me stuff anonymously

[24:45] and then just hide in the shadows, that's not cool.

[24:48] I don't even want to live with that pressure

[24:50] of having that information.

[24:52] So look, this is going to be an interesting year

[24:56] for pinball guys, because I really do

[24:59] think that a lot of people are going to get burned.

[25:03] And I think I don't think all these companies

[25:05] are going to survive.

[25:06] And I think the promise of boutique pinball

[25:09] that developed a few years ago has really not materialized

[25:15] and been worth it.

[25:17] It hasn't been satisfying enough.

[25:19] And it's a shame.

[25:21] It's a shame, because I think like most of you, we see,

[25:25] we just want, we want, I don't know about you,

[25:27] but here's, I just want new games that

[25:31] are Valley Williams quality.

[25:33] That is what we're all chasing after.

[25:36] Let's be honest.

[25:37] We want a game that has the quality of a Williams game

[25:42] that when you look down, it's a world under glass

[25:44] like nothing else.

[25:46] And we've had to compromise for so long on getting back

[25:50] to that level of a game.

[25:53] And Stern, great, congratulations, Stern.

[25:55] You do get the most games out, but you're not there yet.

[25:59] You're not there with a world under glass.

[26:01] You're not there with quality by any means.

[26:04] You finally realize that we want good artwork.

[26:07] But you're not there yet.

[26:09] Jersey Jack, you're the closest.

[26:11] You are the closest to really giving people

[26:14] that quality machine that they can be happy with.

[26:18] Waz wasn't the theme for everyone.

[26:20] Waz had issues.

[26:21] It's your inaugural title, we get it.

[26:23] I think Hobbit was like the big mess in terms

[26:26] of what could have been.

[26:28] Hobbit to me is the same as Star Wars Episode 1.

[26:31] Everyone thought that movie and theme would be great.

[26:35] Jack told us all about how Smalg

[26:37] is going to be the most interactive toy ever.

[26:39] And Hobbit sort of faltered.

[26:41] But dialed in.

[26:42] Dialed in gives me hope.

[26:45] Because I do think dialed in is really

[26:47] going to be the one that is that world under glass.

[26:51] The quality is there.

[26:52] For those bitching about the $8,000 price point,

[26:55] I think everybody who buys dialed in

[26:58] is going to be extremely happy.

[27:00] Yes, the theme isn't exactly what you want.

[27:02] But it, to me, that feels like if Williams made a game today,

[27:08] that's the game they would make.

[27:10] I think Lebowski was there too.

[27:12] But their problems have made it impossible to root for them.

[27:16] So I think Stern is the volume player here.

[27:22] But I'm just not feeling it.

[27:25] I'm not feeling the quality and the level of the games.

[27:28] And I think Batman Super-Elly.

[27:31] And I'm going to end on this point.

[27:32] I think Batman Super-Elly will hurt this hobby

[27:38] and set this hobby back more than anything.

[27:42] Because in one stroke, in one move, Stern proved one point.

[27:48] They prove that pinball collectors are fools,

[27:53] are kind of silly that pinball collectors don't really

[27:58] need to get their money's worth.

[28:00] They prove that with 80 machines that if you

[28:06] knew the build of materials on a Batman Super-Elly

[28:10] and then knew what they charged you,

[28:13] you can't walk away without thinking anything other than

[28:17] pinball collectors are a bunch of suckers.

[28:20] And if I was in Sight Stern's marketing department,

[28:23] that's what I would be thinking.

[28:25] Look what they spent for what we gave.

[28:28] Think about it for a moment.

[28:30] When people spent $16,000 on Magic Girl, people went nuts.

[28:35] And we're like, how can you charge so much for a machine?

[28:38] And remember, John was only going to make 16 units of it.

[28:43] Crazy, right?

[28:43] Didn't work.

[28:45] But how much more would you rather

[28:48] have Magic Girl than a Batman SLE?

[28:53] And it's just this point, too.

[28:55] When you look at Batman SLE being 15 grand.

[28:58] And then you see there's someone's son

[29:01] who's beautiful Big Bang Bar collection for $20,000

[29:04] or best offer.

[29:05] If you bought a Batman SLE and don't have a Big Bang Bar,

[29:10] I think you're a big bang dummy.

[29:14] Because when we talk about real value,

[29:18] when we talk about the story behind it,

[29:22] see that's the whole thing.

[29:23] When you look at Big Bang Bar and why it's worth the money,

[29:25] it's worth it's the story.

[29:28] It's the thing was an impossible venture by Gene Cunningham.

[29:31] It sold originally for $4,500.

[29:34] And people thought their money was gone.

[29:36] And he used the last of the remaining parts to make it.

[29:40] It's almost like he resurrected the woolly mammoth

[29:43] with some DNA.

[29:45] This thing is, it's got that story.

[29:48] It's got that history.

[29:50] And that's the reason why people spend a lot of money

[29:52] on a Big Bang Bar.

[29:54] Because when you go over and you see one,

[29:56] not only is it a unique piece of Pimble history,

[30:00] it's rare, it plays, it's different.

[30:03] And you're not going to see thousands of them.

[30:06] Like you're going to see a Batman.

[30:07] You're only going to see a 96, right?

[30:10] Something like that.

[30:11] So one stern went into the boutique arena and took our money.

[30:17] I think everybody fucked themselves.

[30:19] I really do.

[30:20] And I know I've said this before.

[30:21] Look, stern's happy, the buyers are happy.

[30:23] I get it.

[30:24] But what they showed and what they proved

[30:27] is that we all are a bunch of idiots in this hobby.

[30:30] And when we show that, that we're just like grown men

[30:34] with money to burn, that chase after the next flashy thing,

[30:40] we're just setting ourselves up to be lied to,

[30:43] to be marketed to like we're idiots.

[30:46] And we're going to keep getting pinball manufacturers

[30:49] that treat us like suckers because we behave like suckers.

[30:53] And that's all I'm asking, guys, is the onus is on us this year.

[30:57] I think collectively.

[30:58] And this is why I want to see it on Pinsad.

[30:59] I want to see it when we talk to each other at shows.

[31:02] We need to say no.

[31:04] We need to ask the hard question.

[31:05] And we need to stop just running and waiting our money

[31:08] as if it means nothing to give you guys some reason.

[31:13] I've been saving up my money.

[31:15] And I haven't jumped in on, well, I'll talk a little bit

[31:19] more of this at a future podcast.

[31:20] But my money's tied up in other areas.

[31:23] But I'll say this.

[31:25] There have been times where I want to keep Batman.

[31:28] I want to keep Ghostbusters.

[31:29] I just put my money in the market.

[31:31] And I made money on it.

[31:33] And then when my financial advisor gives me my reports,

[31:38] I just laugh because I'm happy with one pinball machine I have.

[31:43] I do want to wait for another machine that really speaks to me and speaks to my soul.

[31:48] But I do, I don't know if you guys are like me, but I do find myself.

[31:52] Always on the forums, always on eBay.

[31:55] You get bored.

[31:56] You get bored with life.

[31:57] And you want a new toy to fill the boredom a little bit.

[32:00] And sometimes I think about that adrenaline you get when you're waiting for

[32:06] your new toy to arrive.

[32:08] And then what happens, right?

[32:09] You get it.

[32:10] And it's just another toy.

[32:12] So I've sort of mentally been working on my own addiction to needing new things to feel

[32:17] better and to feel like what compensated in life and justifying like whatever.

[32:25] Like, now I just saved my money.

[32:27] I love saving my money.

[32:28] And I want to use my money for experiences.

[32:31] I want to think about all the vacations and the things you can do with a Batman SLE that

[32:36] you'll remember far, far further into the future.

[32:41] And we'll mean so much more than that game itself.

[32:44] You know, it makes me wonder why people do it.

[32:46] But again, like the people who buy Batman SLE are also taking those vacations and have

[32:50] those sort of other big things going on because you should be really rich if you buy a

[32:55] $15,000 stern.

[32:57] There's no way around that.

[32:59] So that's it.

[33:00] Really, I hope you guys take away this.

[33:03] I want people to be a little bit more positive, but I don't want positivity and optimism to

[33:11] be confused with becoming pushovers and letting these manufacturers get away without answering

[33:19] the tough questions.

[33:20] You know, we've got to find that balance.

[33:23] So I want someone on there today to go in the alien thread and just ask them, when did

[33:29] you submit the Ellie artwork and how long ago did you do it and like how long did Fox

[33:34] take to approve the artwork the first time?

[33:37] I want you to ask that.

[33:39] And that's it.

[33:40] I don't want people to go, you look, you can get crazy and go call up Fox licensing,

[33:44] merchandising and you can find out like this stuff probably if you want it to be nuts about

[33:49] it.

[33:50] But we're not there.

[33:51] I don't think highway.

[33:52] I think Andrew's problem right now are the boards and I think he knows that and I think

[33:57] the boards are going to take a few months more than he then people think and he's going

[34:01] to hide behind a few other reasons.

[34:04] But I hope the game comes out soon.

[34:06] I want to play it.

[34:07] I want to play it and then all this drama will dissipate right and all these tough questions

[34:11] can go away.

[34:13] But that's it.

[34:15] That's it people.

[34:16] Let's wise up this year.

[34:17] Let's make better decisions and let's enjoy pinball right now me personally.

[34:22] So you guys know I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix the dam.

[34:26] There's a damn switch in toad and that keeps messing up.

[34:28] It's the it's the roll over switch right where you lock for multi ball right.

[34:33] So you lock the one ball and then the second ball comes down and rolls over those two switches.

[34:39] Well the second switch it rolls over doesn't won't get press.

[34:44] It doesn't read properly or doesn't get pressed down fully and because of that it's not

[34:48] reading the second ball locked which then won't kick out the third ball and I've I've

[34:54] bent the switch a million different ways every once in a while like I'll bend it a certain

[34:57] way and it'll start reading it then I put the glass back on and then the ball rolls over

[35:01] and it pushes it to a different angle and it stops working.

[35:05] So if you can do me a favor if you know what that switch is can you email me at canadapimball

[35:11] at gmail.com and help me out so I can order a new one.

[35:15] I would go on pinside and put a picture of it and it would be great.

[35:19] This is where not having access to the community sucks whenever I have an issue.

[35:23] So if you could help me it's that second roll over switch I'm totin.

[35:26] I'd be forever appreciative and I would call your name out as being the greatest person

[35:31] on planet earth.

[35:32] Happy Monday everybody.

[35:34] Enjoy pinball we had a great super bowl.

[35:37] Try to tune off all the political bullshit in the world.

[35:40] Love your family.

[35:41] Love your toys and don't buy a stern that costs more than $10,000 ever again.

[35:49] Canada pinball over now.
