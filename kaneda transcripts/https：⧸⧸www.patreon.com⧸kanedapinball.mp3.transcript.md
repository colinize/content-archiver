[00:00] There are still fans of Canade's Bimbal Podcast that ask me each week where did your show

[00:11] go?

[00:12] And I know for five years you were so used to new episodes popping up on your podcast

[00:17] feeds.

[00:18] And for those of you who don't know, and I know that most of you do know, but I still

[00:22] want to put this up for everyone to hear.

[00:25] This Bimbal Podcast is now available exclusively on Patreon.

[00:30] And I'm going to put the link to it in the notes of this.

[00:33] I'm even going to make the link of this show where you need to go if you want to listen

[00:37] to Canade's Bimbal Podcast again.

[00:39] Now look, I know there are people who are upset by this.

[00:42] I will guarantee each and every one of you that has not joined the Canade Club that it

[00:48] is the best way you could spend $5 a month.

[00:51] I'm still doing two to three shows a week.

[00:54] We're having a great time talking about everything going on in Pimbal.

[00:58] And I haven't missed a step.

[00:59] And I think the numbers prove that.

[01:01] And it's been a hard year from COVID to having Killing and to having all of these things

[01:05] I've been juggling.

[01:06] But I still, every single week, love making my Pimbal Podcast.

[01:11] And I hope you join the club if you're not a club member already.

[01:14] And the conversation has been as good as it's ever been.

[01:18] So everybody, be good.

[01:20] The link is here.

[01:21] And again, I guarantee if you join the club, you're going to have a great time.

[01:25] We'll talk to you soon.
