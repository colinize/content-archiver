[00:00] The boys of the end like getting wild with the new door by

[00:05] I'm the bowser right now for Christmas's sake

[00:13] Tis the season to listen to episode 539 of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:19] On this podcast, I am going to get Joe Newhart from Pinball Star on the show

[00:24] And we are going to ask Joe Point Blank

[00:27] He doesn't know this yet, Point Blank

[00:29] Where are the Guns and Roses Collectors editions?

[00:32] So we are going to see what he says

[00:34] And I also want to know if someone orders a Guns and Roses right now

[00:38] What is the earliest they can expect they are going to get that game?

[00:41] I just heard a few minutes before doing this show

[00:45] That Stern has confirmed for my distributor friends out there

[00:50] That the next Stern Cornerstone game is going to be revealed next Tuesday

[00:56] The information went to distributors and here's the code name of this cornerstone game

[01:01] The code name is Ranger

[01:04] Is it Texas Walker Ranger Game?

[01:07] Are we going to get that Chuck Norris Game?

[01:09] We've always wanted from Stern but it is code name Ranger

[01:12] And it is being revealed next Tuesday

[01:15] Can I get a Twippy vote for that?

[01:17] Can I get a Twippy vote for being correct on this one?

[01:19] If not, should you send your votes elsewhere?

[01:21] Oh no, it's Twippy season, he's doing it again

[01:23] I'm also going to talk a little bit about Deeproot and the Mediator they've been doing this week

[01:28] I want to just discuss a couple things there

[01:31] What else is going on?

[01:32] I pretty much have confirmation that Alien is coming

[01:35] We're waiting to see what happens on the Christopher Franchi interview

[01:38] I think there's going to be a lot of great exclusive news that Franchi tells us about this project

[01:43] I've reached out to the pinball brothers twice

[01:46] I've reached out and guess what?

[01:48] They haven't responded

[01:49] So welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast

[01:51] The number one show with the largest audience that is often frequently ignored by so many of the pinball companies

[02:00] So I will say this, I did ask George Gomez if he would join the show

[02:04] And you know what he said?

[02:05] He didn't say flat out no, he said he was going to run it by the boys

[02:08] So I can't imagine what must happen when George Gomez opens up the marketing door over at Stern Pinball

[02:15] And says, should I do Canadian Spinball Podcast?

[02:17] And Sharp just looks at him and says, are you effing kidding me George?

[02:21] But George, I think it would be a great chat

[02:24] We had George on many, many eons ago

[02:27] Alright, so let's talk a little bit about some of the information we learned with the Deeproot Mediator that happened this week

[02:33] So first and foremost, I want to recommend that if you want to get as much information as possible on Deeproot Pinball

[02:40] You should listen to the two interviews that went up, they were really good interviews

[02:44] And I will say this, even though the sound quality is not the best in the pinball news interview

[02:49] Because for some reason, it sounds like the microphone is inside someone's shirt

[02:53] And they're just trying to get it out of their shirt the whole time

[02:56] The interview that pinball news did with Robert was great

[03:00] It was two and a half hours long

[03:02] But I will say this, they asked every difficult tough question you can imagine

[03:07] And if you want your questions answered, you should listen to that interview

[03:11] Because they covered every single base and then some

[03:14] So Jonathan Justin, thank you so much for doing that

[03:17] There's also another great interview with Jeff Teal, this on pinball profile that went up yesterday

[03:22] Which has Steve Bowden, Robert and Quinn as well

[03:26] So you should also check that out

[03:28] Now I just want to give my broad strokes feelings on this

[03:32] And you know, look, I've had Robert and Quinn on this show

[03:35] I had Robert on a bunch of times

[03:37] And my door to Canadian pinball podcast is always open

[03:42] It's always open, it's open to every single person out there in the pinball world, the pinball manufacturers

[03:48] That wants to come on and have a chat about pinball and their company

[03:52] And you've listened to this show, we've always been very respectful and cordial to every single guess we have

[03:59] That's until Joe comes out in a few minutes

[04:01] And I just absolutely lamb based him for no reason, right?

[04:04] So the door is always open for Deeproot to come on the show, I haven't heard from them

[04:08] But he knows that anytime Robert or Steve or Quinn wants to come on this show, they can

[04:13] So a lot of information has made its way out into the world as Rosa pre-orders have opened up

[04:19] I just want to give a few of my thoughts on the things that I've heard after listening to all these interviews

[04:24] Okay, so the first thing I felt after listening to both of these interviews

[04:28] Is that the team over at Deeproot is very, very excited for everyone to experience the Deeproot difference, right?

[04:35] The Deeproot platform, the pinbar, their innovations and how they are thinking about pinball differently

[04:41] And you hear it from everybody on the team like we just can't wait for people to jump on our platform

[04:47] And experience our machine and they'll understand what we have been so passionate about all these years

[04:54] And so I think everyone out there in the pinball community is like, yes, I absolutely want to jump on this new machine

[05:00] And experience it for myself

[05:02] But then the marketer and me, after I hear their excitement, I just can't get around one glaring thing that just keeps hanging over me

[05:10] And hanging over the common sensical mind that I think I do have

[05:14] Here's the thing that I can't shake

[05:16] If you want everybody to experience the Deeproot difference and you want them to see all of the hard work that went into your project

[05:24] And you know that people want to experience it

[05:27] There is no way anybody can experience the Deeproot difference before the order banks for Raza close

[05:34] That's the part I just can't figure out

[05:37] There is no way anyone can actually experience the game by December 30th

[05:41] So by the time people actually get to experience the Deeproot difference, they can't order this game

[05:47] So that is the part that I'm just, it still just continues to make me scratch my head on

[05:51] Don't you want more people to actually experience it and be able to play it and then order it and buy it

[05:58] Like why close the order banks well before anyone's opportunity to play the game

[06:05] So that was like the one thing where I'm like yes, we want to play it, yes, we can't wait to see the difference

[06:10] But man, we can't order it when we see that difference

[06:13] All we can do is go off of not very much right a few videos and a stream

[06:18] So is that going to be enough to drive people to buy?

[06:22] Now we know that the game is now limited to 300

[06:25] There's a limited ordering window so they're really pulling two levers here to get people to feel that FOMO

[06:31] And look to play somewhat of a devil's advocate, I mean FOMO works in this hobby right?

[06:36] We see it time and time again you put you put a limited number on a top or you're gonna sell out

[06:40] You put a limited number on a game and if the game is something people want it sells out pretty quickly

[06:45] So will this work? Will pulling two of those FOMO levers at the same time in which you're limiting the order window

[06:52] And you're limiting the number of razas will that be enough to entice people?

[06:57] Now I'm on the forum and I do see people are ordering the game, I'm not sure how many orders they've received

[07:02] But that is the approach they're taking. Now I do want to remind people when it comes to ordering raza and buying raza

[07:08] I did say on my show that I would buy raza extra edition I would buy game number one

[07:16] And people love to call canada hypocrite they love to call canada liar

[07:20] Now my offer still stands I will buy the first extra edition of raza that makes it off of the assembly line

[07:28] And I mean that so if the team over there wants to put game number one aside or you know

[07:34] It could be any of the initial batch aside and I will have cash on the glass for them the moment that happens

[07:41] Now what I won't do though what I won't do and partially because I've already committed to a Guns and Roses CEO

[07:47] I've got a baby on the way what I won't do is I won't pay for the spot to get game number one

[07:53] You know I'm not going to buy a spot online I want to buy the actual game so the moment that game is in a box

[08:00] Robert and team over deeproot I will buy that first game so I'm not going against my word that I will go in on the deeproot platform

[08:08] The day it becomes available and is real and in a box okay so I just want to clarify that

[08:13] Now the other part I kept thinking about you know as I was listening to the interviews and as I was going through the website again

[08:20] This hobby has changed a lot over the years but one thing has remained constant the finish line right the finish line

[08:28] The moment in which you can take credit the moment in which you can pop champagne

[08:33] It's not the moment your game goes on sale or the moment the order banks open

[08:38] It's the moment your game ships right any sales team any salesman can sell you something

[08:44] But it takes an army of highly skilled workers to make you something and ship you a pinball machine

[08:51] And that is the moment in which you do your victory lap

[08:54] While I know this was a great milestone for them to get to this point where they open the order banks and they're revealing all this stuff

[09:01] And they're showing you all that behind the scenes of the company

[09:04] I still think that the victory laps in pinball and this is not just for deeper it's for everybody out there

[09:10] The moment you do your victory lap the moment you can congratulate yourself on your accomplishment

[09:15] It isn't the moment sales open it's the moment games ship

[09:19] And that is why we're seeing more and more in pinball we're seeing more and more companies combine those two things right

[09:26] The day the game goes up for sale is also the same day the game ships right we saw that with Jersey Jack and Guns and Roses

[09:34] We saw that with stranger things in stern and so that window continues to get condensed

[09:39] But for the most part the moment you should really congratulate yourself and the victory lap moment is when your manufacturing is turned on

[09:47] And games are going into boxes and shipping to customers that's the moment you can really pop that champagne and say we did it

[09:54] We did it right now. I'm not saying deep route doesn't have that ready to go and it's not just around the corner right times going to tell whether or not that comes true

[10:03] They've told us in the interviews that it's four to six weeks after orders closes when we should start to see the first games go out right

[10:11] And that is true like within the industry we normally see that as the time between a game being revealed and a game shipping

[10:18] Now some companies can do it quicker, but that's the standard in the industry

[10:22] So let's say that if order banks close on December 30th we should start to see some Roses trickling out at the beginning of March

[10:31] If deep route delivers on that that will be the moment people say yes they did it and are doing it

[10:37] That is the moment in which they will have peak confidence that they can do it right once you see people unboxing the games

[10:44] That is when everyone's gonna be like okay

[10:46] It's real like but here's the thing that goes back to my initial point

[10:49] When that moment happens when people are unboxing their Roses and enjoying their Roses you can order one

[10:56] So I am curious to see if maybe the third edition of the game opens up when that moment happens

[11:03] So right now we've got only 300 of these LEDs and then they are Ked edition

[11:08] I find it hard to believe that after all these years of hard work if the manufacturing line is turned on and all these games are pumping out

[11:14] And interest peaks right because people see the unboxings that they're not gonna do another run

[11:19] I would assume you'd have to right don't you want to sell as many of these games as you can

[11:24] So maybe they'll turn more arcade editions on because really it's only the extra edition that is limited

[11:30] The other thing as I look at all this through the lens of a marketer is I've seen this industry evolve so much over the years

[11:36] The take our word for an approach worked years ago

[11:40] Remember people could just rock up to the show with the translate and get $16,000 checks in their pocket

[11:46] Will it work today? I see orders happening so some are willing to take the leap

[11:51] Will the brave be rewarded with an ultra rare J-pop game that will be super limited and soar in value

[11:59] That would be a sweet goal for the deep root team to achieve right

[12:03] Get those early adopters the games on time and tell all the doubters we told you so

[12:09] Right that's they will be able to do that to beat their chest and say see we told you so we told you we were gonna deliver

[12:16] And now these early adopters have this exclusive rare game and you all should have had faith in us

[12:22] Or will the story unfold differently right? Will this drag out longer than anticipated?

[12:27] Will pre-order customers feel more like investors in a startup and less like purchasers of a product?

[12:35] I will tell and I think to me that's the ultimate thing with all this I am not here to speculate and doom and gloom anybody

[12:41] And I think ultimately that's the takeaway is all of this will just come down to what we see over the next few months

[12:48] During the interviews too I also would hear the phrase the negative media

[12:51] The negative pinball media and sometimes I think they're talking about me they didn't say me but I'll just assume when people are upset with pinball media

[12:59] Usually usually the vitriol lands on my desk and I just want to say this for the record for everybody listening to this show

[13:07] For everyone over at team deeproot for everyone in the pinball industry

[13:11] I am 1000% in support of every single pinball company getting their games to market

[13:17] This is a pinball podcast in which I want to evaluate the products

[13:22] I don't necessarily want to evaluate the journey

[13:24] I don't care where your money comes from, I don't care who your investors are, I don't care who your customers are or how you find them

[13:32] What I care about are pinball machines and I get excited about pinball machines

[13:36] So I 1000% and in support of deeproot fulfilling on all of this right I am not here to be negative about this company

[13:45] I hope 5 months from now we see all of these great raza unboxings

[13:50] I hope people are excited for games 2, 3, 4 and 5 because we know as they've said in the interviews

[13:56] I've said it before in my show I know they've got a lot of exciting stuff that's in the pipeline in these future titles

[14:02] And they just need to get raza out and that is where we're at right now

[14:06] But here's the other part of being part of the pinball media and anyone who picks up a microphone and has a show about pinball and is covering new pinball companies

[14:14] The moment you take pre-order dollars from customers that is the moment you cross the Rubicon

[14:20] You are no longer a conceptual design startup company

[14:25] You now have an obligation to the people whose money you took to deliver on the games

[14:32] And as a pinball media member all of us have an obligation now to look at companies that take money from consumers

[14:40] And report on how things are going right so if deadlines are missed or red flags pop up we shouldn't bury that

[14:49] We definitely should bring it to people's attention because it's important once you start taking money from customers

[14:55] That companies are held accountable for the things they say, the things they do and most importantly

[15:04] Companies are held accountable for the things they don't do and that is how we've always been on Canadian pinball podcast

[15:10] We have applied that approach to every single company that we've covered this isn't about deep route this isn't about Stern

[15:17] This isn't about Jersey Jack this is about how anyone who's covering an industry needs to fairly cover the industry

[15:25] You have to be fair you have to be balanced you have to call it like it is

[15:30] And if companies want to tell us what we should expect from them we have to hold them to those expectations and hold them accountable for those timelines

[15:40] So what I mean by that right now is it's December 10th of 2020

[15:45] As far as I'm concerned there's a lot of interesting stuff going on with Raza and I understand why people are excited by this new pinball offering

[15:52] I am I mean I see cool stuff happening with the pinball I see cool stuff happening with the game

[15:57] I've always been a fan of J-pop I've always wanted a rare J-pop game I mean I owned a magic girl before even seeing if the thing worked

[16:04] And at least we see that this Raza works I mean the game works we have a working J-pop game that is a modern day miracle people

[16:12] Alright so I understand why people are going in on it alright and as far as I'm concerned

[16:17] Once December 30th is up then it's just a wait and see period right we're not gonna cover deep route every day every week

[16:24] Right now it's like let them do their job now they know that and Robert knows this and the team knows this and I heard this in the interviews

[16:30] They now know they have an obligation to fulfill these consumer orders and they're gonna be knows down doing it

[16:36] Now's the time to get it done now's where the rubber meets the road

[16:39] You know enough enough I could give them any advice it's just go do it it's go do it

[16:44] We look forward to then over the next few months to see the progress of deep repimble

[16:49] And I will happily report any progress they have as they get these games into boxes

[16:54] It's CanadianPimble at gmail.com and as I said my door is always open if they want to come on and talk to us about how manufacturing is going and how the line is being set up

[17:03] And I just want to end before I bring Joe out by saying this

[17:06] When you deliver on what you say the news and conversation will be great I want nothing more than anything to say in March

[17:15] We have shows that are titled deep route unboxings right that's really what I want

[17:19] But there's another side to this coin and I do have a responsibility right if there's any delays bumps in the road to cover those things

[17:26] But for now December 10th CanadianPimble podcast wants to say congratulations to the deep route team on reaching this milestone for your company

[17:36] The door is always open to discuss anything you wish we've dropped a pin on the calendar of Raza's shipping by the end of February early March

[17:46] That's the date I'm also expecting my firstborn so I hope that both firstborns arrive in this world right around the same time

[17:54] Everybody let's bring Joe from pinball star out so he can answer for all the 500 people out in this world

[18:01] Why they spent 12 5 on a game and then heard absolutely nothing from the company that took their money up until now

[18:08] He doesn't know this is coming right away. I'm gonna hit him with it right away. Okay. You ready for it? Let's get Joe new heart out here now

[18:15] Well right before we get Joe out here though. I just got some breaking news. It was in my inbox. I'm here to confirm for you right now

[18:22] Pinball brothers alien pinball machine will be revealed to the world on either December 18th or December 19th

[18:31] So that is what is that end of next week? This is crazy people

[18:35] So we're gonna get Stern's next cornerstone next Tuesday and just a few days later

[18:41] Pinball brothers is gonna show you the details of alien pinball. Does anyone have any money left?

[18:47] Does anyone have any space left? Let's bring out Joe now. All right ladies and gentlemen Joe new heart my favorite distributor in the world

[18:55] Over at pinball star Joe you've got my guns and roses collectors edition on order Joe welcome back to the show. Hey thanks Chris good to talk to you again

[19:02] I know it's been a while maybe about a year since since we've chatted so let's catch up buddy. Well that's not true because I chatted with you when I ordered my collector's edition

[19:11] And question number one Joe where are the collectors editions of guns and roses? They do not exist yet. They're they're gonna be made

[19:19] The word is is that they're probably gonna be on the line towards the end of December early January and we'll probably see most of production on the C.E.s take place

[19:31] You know after the new year into January and February would think you know whether they're gonna do all 500 in one shot

[19:39] Whether they'll take a little break and mix in some L.E.s or S.E.s I don't know that I just know that they're coming and they're coming pretty soon

[19:45] I'm sure they're waiting on you know maybe some final special parts for the C.E.s that usually occurs you know with a special model for many company if there's something unique to it

[19:54] You know sometimes if they don't have everything then they have to you know at that the wait for all the parts

[19:59] Now let me ask you a question because this launch was a juggernaut launch for Jersey Jack Pimble sold out of the 12-5 edition in like an hour

[20:08] Did you have customers that just wanted a collector's edition and they got locked out because a lot of people couldn't get one?

[20:14] Oh well yeah we did of course yeah everybody did I think every distributor had people that we had to go back to and take their game away which was probably one of the hardest things I've had to do as a distributor doing this you know 10-12 years

[20:30] Having to take a game from somebody that that we thought we had so yeah that was hard

[20:35] How did that happen I mean how did you thought you had a number then they had to take some back what happened there?

[20:43] I think it was really just a factor that they were taking by surprise at how many C.E.s would sell

[20:51] I think what they did which would be reasonable as they looked at past history of the number of C.E. editions for dialed in and pirates and wonka that sold and probably estimated

[21:03] You know what they would sell on guns and roses and I think they were just kind of shell shocked on day one in a good way that you know there was just such an incredible demand maybe a little bit of poor planning I don't know.

[21:16] Right yeah it ended up just taking off more than anticipated and obviously nothing intentional it was just a little mistake that they tried to stop as quickly as they could but unfortunately a lot of us.

[21:26] People were coming not just myself but at every distributor left and right ordering the games and at some point in time fortunately I was smart enough in early afternoon I think it was even our late mid afternoon just kind of putting up the brakes on it because you know I wasn't 100% sure where we were at and I still ended up having a

[21:46] total good number of people that we didn't have a game for them and the only fair way to do is you take the last people that ordered up until we got our allotments finalized and then kind of went from there so right difficult day.

[21:58] The part of mouys trying to figure out did they ever tell each distributor you get this many was there ever that or did were there assumptions being made on both sides of the camp.

[22:09] Chris to be fair I'm going to say there were assumptions made on both sides of the camp obviously distributors don't make up our own numbers and in the same respect there probably was a good amount of assumptions on both parts I think the company was assuming that they didn't have anything necessarily to worry about and I didn't have a firm number in my hand but I also didn't have a concern that selling the games that I usually would sell would be a problem so there's not really fault with the distributors per se and and I think that's not the same thing.

[22:39] Maybe not any intend to fault with JJP either but yeah we both just kind of got surprised by the crush and you know should have been handled better absolutely no doubt about that did you wish you had this kind of demand for dialed in.

[22:52] We did we did a lot of time.

[22:56] Wait, wait.

[22:56] Wait, wait.

[22:57] Wait.

[22:58] Wait.

[22:59] All right.

[23:00] Mr. Mom, Gene's has a huge following, Chris.

[23:01] You have no idea.

[23:02] Yeah, and I saw you just had your last dialed in available for sale.

[23:06] Has it sold?

[23:07] It's gone.

[23:08] It shipped on Monday.

[23:10] And no more.

[23:11] No more.

[23:12] Their company is sold out.

[23:14] And I believe most distributors are probably sold out too.

[23:17] This was just one extra left game that I had.

[23:20] And, you know, we posted it out there that we had one left and then take about a week

[23:24] to get rid of it.

[23:26] And we're seeing that now with Willie Wonker, right?

[23:29] Those are starting to sell out.

[23:30] I think there's only a few LEDs or a collector's editions left and standards.

[23:35] The only thing that's left are collector's editions.

[23:38] Willie Wonka, Ellie, sold out in November, I believe it was.

[23:43] You know, we kind of got word.

[23:44] Usually what happens is we get word with any company that, hey, we only have 30, 50 of

[23:49] X title left and usually at that point.

[23:52] And the bigger distributors that like holding stock will step up and will buy adequate

[23:58] numbers.

[23:59] So we have them.

[24:00] With dialed in, we didn't really get that warning.

[24:01] I think that the stock just sold very quickly at one point in time and we got an email

[24:06] one day that, hey, dial in, Ellie's are also sold out, which was disappointing.

[24:10] I would have liked to have had a chance to grab a few extra for the holidays because

[24:14] we are getting asked for them.

[24:16] But yeah, it was just things sell out.

[24:18] And that's the biggest problem right now, Chris.

[24:19] I don't know if you're, what kind of questions you'll have for, you know, this

[24:22] podcast, but you know, the biggest problem right now with any distributor and any manufacturer

[24:26] is just having stock to sell.

[24:28] Right.

[24:29] There's just not a lot out there.

[24:30] How many people calling you up right now asking if you have dialed in in stock?

[24:35] How many of those people's name is Pat Lawler?

[24:39] You're so bold, Chris.

[24:41] You're so bold.

[24:42] Well, let's talk about, let's talk about this because I hear that sales are through the

[24:46] roof and distributors can't keep inventory in place.

[24:49] I was totally wrong that COVID would crash the economy and cause distributors to have

[24:54] a horrible year.

[24:55] What's been like?

[24:56] Not at all.

[24:57] You know, this is very close to what occurred with the financial crisis back in the last

[25:04] decade.

[25:06] And what we found then and what we're, we find now is that when people, not that people

[25:12] aren't, you know, obviously people are affected, businesses are closed, businesses are down,

[25:17] they're worried about their jobs, all that sort of stuff, that's very prevalent.

[25:21] That's not, you know, I'm not down playing that in any capacity.

[25:25] But also what happens on the flip side is people are not taking vacations, people are not

[25:30] spending money maybe on a huge purchase, like a car or a house renovation or stuff like

[25:36] that.

[25:37] And they're also cooped up at home.

[25:39] That's the other part of this that is different than anything else that occurred before, you

[25:44] know, just in the world or in the country financially is people are at home, they're

[25:49] sequestered and quarantined and kids are home from school and stuff.

[25:53] And we found that a lot of people want something for the home, for the family to do and enjoy

[25:58] and spend time together, et cetera, et cetera.

[26:01] So we really didn't see any kind of a downturn.

[26:05] I would get a lot of people that would acquire about games maybe back in the spring when everything

[26:10] was just starting with the virus.

[26:12] And I was sensing a lot of hesitation on people's part that they would want to buy a game.

[26:18] And, you know, I had a number of people say, I'm going to get back to you in two weeks,

[26:22] our company's having a meeting.

[26:23] I want to see where things are going and stuff like that.

[26:25] Some people came back and bought the game that they were interested in, some didn't.

[26:30] But then pretty much consistently over the summer and now into the fall and winter.

[26:37] Games are selling on a regular basis.

[26:39] And what's occurred with that, I don't want to say the band is strong.

[26:43] I don't think we've sold more games than we would in a typical year because that's been

[26:47] affected by the number of reveals probably having been less than we would typically see

[26:52] in a normal year.

[26:53] And also obviously shows aren't occurring.

[26:56] So we're losing some contact with customers and people aren't seeing games in person.

[27:00] A lot of times is the the impetus for them to buy a game.

[27:04] And then the companies, the flip side of that is the companies were shut down.

[27:06] They're pretty much every company was shut down for maybe two months or so.

[27:10] So that also affects their production.

[27:13] So then you get people continuing to buy at a regular pace.

[27:18] And then you get companies not being able to make games for a period of time and then

[27:23] some delayed reveals and stuff like that.

[27:25] And it just pretty much is led to just about every company not really having stock of older

[27:31] games or new games to sell.

[27:35] I mean, it's a tough person.

[27:36] So I was talking to another distributor and it's kind of hard.

[27:40] We'd like, I send more emails out and we put it this way.

[27:43] Of course, I send more emails replies to people telling them what I don't have and that I

[27:48] can't take care of.

[27:50] They wanted to attack from ours.

[27:51] They want to medieval man this royal or they want to visit a vase 75th anniversary.

[27:57] I send multiple of those emails every day to people saying sorry.

[28:01] Those are sold out and out of stock.

[28:03] It'll be summary runs into 2021.

[28:06] But that's been to frustrating things.

[28:08] But sales are strong.

[28:09] I mean, companies are doing well and distributors are holding our own and challenging your otherwise.

[28:15] Well, and Joe, you're talking about how you're communicating to your customers.

[28:19] I want to talk about communication because as a distributor, you have customers and they

[28:24] want to hear the status of their order.

[28:26] And so we saw this a lot with GNR.

[28:29] We had this amazing launch and then people ordered the game.

[28:33] Lots of LEDs, lots of CE's, lots of S's.

[28:36] And then communication from the company sort of went dead.

[28:41] How as a distributor do you navigate that when you have people who want to know the status

[28:46] and yet you've got nothing?

[28:48] Is it frustrating for you to have to sort of navigate that?

[28:51] Well, I don't think that's fair.

[28:53] And if you're referring to JJP exclusively, it's been weird with GNR.

[28:59] I've seen a lot of that commentary about the company's radio silent and they're not

[29:04] saying anything and sometimes people then make stories up and say, well, they haven't.

[29:09] There's a web page on Facebook that's called Jersey Jack fans and it should be Jersey Jack

[29:14] haters because people are making up stories that games aren't shipping.

[29:18] The truth of the matter is is that they were making guns and roses before they reveal.

[29:22] They haven't stopped and they continue to get games out every single day.

[29:27] On November, they did have to take a good portion of the month, probably the entire month

[29:32] of December.

[29:33] I think it or November, I think it was that they made overseas games because they need to

[29:38] be made with different electrical systems and then they have to be put on a plane train

[29:42] or automobile and boat and shipped to other countries.

[29:46] And sometimes countries like Australia takes them two months to get containers of games.

[29:51] So they'll take a little bit of their production, maybe not right out of the gate, but a short

[29:55] while after they reveal or start production and they'll take care of some overseas orders

[30:01] and try to get those to places that are going to wait for them and they still don't probably

[30:06] have those games.

[30:07] But people here think that there's no games being made and that's not the case and it's

[30:12] kind of unfair to kind of create stories that games aren't shipping or they're not communicating.

[30:17] There was nothing to communicate.

[30:18] Those games are at during that point in time we're being made for overseas and being

[30:22] shipped overseas.

[30:23] Well, and sometimes that is the communication.

[30:26] Even people just want to hear that, right?

[30:27] Let me ask you a question because and for the record people, Kenne just Pimbal podcast

[30:31] has never made up a story and got him booted off of Facebook pages even though I seem to

[30:36] be banned by some here and there.

[30:37] But here's the thing, here's the thing, Joe.

[30:39] Do you think a Pimbal company should transparently tell customers how many games a week or

[30:46] a month they can make so at least those customers know where in the line they are?

[30:51] I have an opinion of that and it's probably not going to be a popular opinion.

[30:55] But I don't think that the companies have a duty to announce their production schedule

[31:04] every week to the general public.

[31:06] That's their business and really whose responsibility that that is to communicate with the customer

[31:11] base, that's the distributor.

[31:14] It's our job to talk to the manufacturers and then figure out what the production schedule

[31:21] looks like and then communicate that.

[31:23] Okay, let me stop you there, Joe, because I want to ask you a question that is based on

[31:26] that.

[31:27] If I knock on Pimbal's star's door two day, right?

[31:30] And I say, I want to order Guns and Roses Ellie.

[31:34] What would you tell me is the timeframe I should expect?

[31:39] I answer that question multiple times a day.

[31:42] The answer as of today is that what we know is occurring and what's been communicated

[31:48] with us or what questions I've asked to find out is that the CEs are doing a small

[31:53] run of Ellie's and SEs right now, which are still fulfilling day one first hour people

[31:59] that ordered.

[32:00] So those games are going out and then mid-month I believe later in December, they're going

[32:06] to be switching over and hopefully starting the CEs.

[32:09] I believe they're going to try to do the majority of the CEs together, whether it will take

[32:14] some breaks like I said before and do some SEs or Ellie's I don't know that, but it's

[32:19] not like they're going to do 100 and then don't do another 100 for a couple months.

[32:22] They're going to try to get most of the SEs done I believe.

[32:25] So basically what I tell people is the CEs, the collector's additions being done late

[32:29] December, that's probably going to take them through the whole month of January, possibly

[32:33] into February, and then we're probably going to see the bulk of the Ellie's get produced

[32:38] in February and beyond.

[32:41] Yeah, that's February until eternity.

[32:44] Because that's all that's left, right?

[32:46] So I guess the thing is you really can't give a customer any real.

[32:51] Can you?

[32:52] I can't give a customer a date.

[32:55] I'm very forthcoming with that.

[32:58] And I think if you were to call JJP direct and ask them for a date, they're not going

[33:02] to give you a date because you don't know what's going to happen.

[33:05] The virus situation is another variable, things are getting worse.

[33:07] So they can start shutting factories down again.

[33:10] Who knows?

[33:11] I will never give anybody a firm date because it's nothing I control.

[33:14] I can't give a date.

[33:16] Companies don't give us dates.

[33:17] So in that respect, I do think it's unfair for people really to gang up on companies and

[33:22] say, oh, there's been no communication.

[33:24] Yeah, we, they owe the public that bought the product some sort of indication and they

[33:30] do give that to the distributors.

[33:32] It's really up to the distributor to then kind of formulate exactly what I told you just

[33:37] now into some sort of reasonable timeframe.

[33:40] And I've told a lot of people this that I'd rather not guess a date because all

[33:44] I'm doing is guessing and we don't know.

[33:46] Well, here's the good news, right?

[33:47] That's the bad news might be you might not know when you're going to get it, but here's

[33:51] the really good news.

[33:53] How effing awesome is this game, Joe?

[33:55] I mean, to me, this is the moment for them.

[33:57] They finally made an adult theme.

[33:59] Eric Minier crushed it.

[34:01] Slash with this.

[34:02] What are your thoughts on the game?

[34:03] I think it is probably the high bar that will be set, not just for Jersey Jack, but for

[34:11] any pinball company going forward.

[34:14] And this was hard for me to say because I'm very forward thinking and I love innovation

[34:19] and different things in games, but I can't foresee a title in the future from any company.

[34:25] I don't care who it is that is going to have the assets, the video, the inclusion of,

[34:32] you know, in this case, Slash who was able to get everything that he was able to get.

[34:36] I mean, the fact that even Axel's doing call outs and the rest of the band, I

[34:41] was amazed.

[34:42] Like, I would never expect that Axel signing the plaque on the CE edition.

[34:47] Obviously, he's known to not maybe be as involved in public type stuff and, you know,

[34:51] whatever you want to call it.

[34:52] And so I was very surprised to see that Axel was involved with everything.

[34:56] The fact that they had, I think we were told they had 36 total concerts to choose video

[35:02] from for each of the, the, the, the, the songs and everything.

[35:07] They had all their actual photographic images from, you know, the bands.

[35:12] They have every, there's nobody to ask permission of.

[35:15] It's slashes.

[35:16] It has everything.

[35:18] And I think that's the thing we might never see again.

[35:20] You know, as we're about to get, I hear Led Zeppelin, by the way, Joe might be next Tuesday.

[35:25] It's going to be, if it is Zeppelin, it is going to be crazy that we're going to have

[35:29] two juggernaut musical acts in pinball format where we can compare and contrast the two.

[35:36] Oh, yeah.

[35:37] That's, that's amazing.

[35:38] The music pins really resonate with people because movies are one thing.

[35:42] You could say, hey, I love that movie, but nobody tattooed the logo of a movie on their

[35:47] army.

[35:48] Maybe some people do, but so I'm not surprised at the impact that the music games have.

[35:53] I think Led Zeppelin is another killer theme.

[35:55] That whether, you know, the music lends itself really well to pinball.

[36:00] We'll, we'll see.

[36:01] I just keep thinking about stairway to heaven multi ball.

[36:03] And you just like, you fall asleep at the machine and just fall backwards.

[36:07] And that's what I was referring to.

[36:09] I mean, obviously great song, classic song, but, you know, how does that translate to to

[36:13] pinball?

[36:14] Do they take certain aspects of it and add it into the game?

[36:16] Well, I guess we'll see if that is the title that's coming out.

[36:19] But, but I do want to get back to your question about guns and roses.

[36:22] I really, and I'm kind of even fearful in a respect that guns and roses is possibly

[36:28] going to be the best total package that we'll ever see.

[36:32] Yeah, music theme that that obviously is right in the wheelhouse of 20 to 30, the 60 year

[36:38] old, mostly males and women of that era.

[36:42] That's right in the wheelhouse of who's buying pinball machines made by JJP, which obviously

[36:47] everybody would love their dream thing done by JJP, you know, incredible animations, incredible

[36:53] artwork on all three models, just fabulous.

[36:56] The LE artwork on guns and roses with the tour posters, I think is by far the best package

[37:02] of artwork on any game.

[37:03] It's just so unique and different.

[37:05] And if you take the time and actually look and read each of the posters, you know, there

[37:10] are different dates and different cities.

[37:13] And you could see that the artwork that was done for that poster in some way relates

[37:17] to that particular city.

[37:18] It's just, it's just very well done, the colors game, everything.

[37:21] So I just think it's an incredible game.

[37:23] I think it's going to be really hard and you can pick anything that JJP, let's say, can

[37:28] get in the future, whether it's Toy Story.

[37:30] I don't know that we'll ever see something as immersive and I've been talked about the

[37:34] light show, which trust me, I like TNA when it came out and it was unique, you know, what

[37:39] Scott did with TNA with the light show was really different and unique.

[37:43] I liked it.

[37:44] Was it the end all be all to the game?

[37:46] No, it was just that it was a great game was most interesting, but it was a nice aside

[37:50] that he did something really different with the light show.

[37:53] But then you look at guns and roses and you've got spotlights that are turning and the

[37:57] mood and colors of the game are different for each song that comes up.

[38:02] You get a song like November rain with the moody beginning and the piano and the lighting

[38:07] of softer and then it kicks in.

[38:09] Living let die is just absolutely insane.

[38:12] Let me ask you a question about more adult themes in Jersey Jack because I think the other

[38:16] thing is this is really the first Jersey Jack machine that kind of deviates a little bit

[38:21] away from from Jack's, you know, always family friendly approach.

[38:25] And do you think they're going to learn from that and start to look at some more adult

[38:29] themes and movies and things that aren't cartoons and Wizard of Oz and stuff like that?

[38:35] I'm sure that their eyes are open that and I'm sure that we're bringing a lot of customers

[38:41] to the table.

[38:42] And I think that's probably part of what they underestimated with the demand.

[38:46] Honestly, is that there might have been a small slice of the pie of pinball buyers that

[38:53] were never J.J.P. owners, not because they didn't like what they did with their games,

[38:58] but that there just wasn't knock down dirty, hard, rock and whatever, you know, theme that

[39:04] they wanted as much as they maybe liked watching the Wizard of Oz.

[39:08] If somebody doesn't have a family and that was their purpose for it, maybe they would

[39:12] say, well, I'm better off with a superhero theme or something like that.

[39:16] So I think they definitely brought new people that maybe weren't J.J.P.

[39:20] professionals or officials previously to the table.

[39:25] So I think I don't think that anything's off the table going forward.

[39:29] You know, trust me a couple times, you know, playing guns and roses and you hear the

[39:33] F word here and there, it's a little different from here that comes from J.J.P.

[39:37] machine.

[39:38] Yeah, it's refreshing.

[39:39] Oh, it's refreshing too.

[39:40] Yeah.

[39:41] Let me ask you a question because before guns and roses, all we ever heard about,

[39:44] I mean, you couldn't stop hearing this, are they going to remake pirates?

[39:47] Are they going to bring it back?

[39:48] Do you think this will silence that or do you think they're going to remake pirates?

[39:55] I have no knowledge, Chris, one way or the other.

[39:58] I might have asked the question and probably was told that they don't know either.

[40:03] It's probably going to depend again on production schedule of how fast and furious guns and

[40:10] roses continues to sell.

[40:11] I think it's going to be another evergreen title for them that people are going to continuously

[40:16] want.

[40:17] Obviously, there'll be another game coming after this.

[40:20] Can they squeeze in another run of something?

[40:22] Do they want to squeeze in another run?

[40:24] I don't have an answer to that question.

[40:26] I know I could sell 100 of them day one, but whether that happens from now, I don't know.

[40:32] Let's switch gears to another company that you distribute, Chicago Gaming Company.

[40:37] And we heard from Christopher Franchi that he's working over there that the next title

[40:42] from CGC is most likely going to be revealed by the end of the year.

[40:47] Have you heard anything?

[40:48] No, we haven't been told anything.

[40:52] Obviously, we expect that another game obviously has been in development and that we should see

[40:58] something soon because Monster Bash was revealed when.

[41:02] That was November of 2018 or when Dracula was still alive.

[41:09] It was 18.

[41:10] Come on, Chris.

[41:12] That's forever.

[41:13] That's okay.

[41:14] Nothing on CGC's friend.

[41:16] I just got, what do you got?

[41:19] Well, I just, I don't, we don't have anything firm, but you know, what do you got?

[41:23] What do you got?

[41:24] Wait, Joe, what do you got soft?

[41:27] What's that?

[41:28] You said we have nothing firm, but what do you got soft for me on CGC news?

[41:31] Well, no, I was just going to refer.

[41:33] If Chris says it's going to happen at the end of the year, then that's probably a better

[41:38] indication than anybody.

[41:40] Right.

[41:41] And of course, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case.

[41:43] Okay.

[41:44] So we're running out of time.

[41:45] So we look forward to that.

[41:46] And now I just confirmed before I brought you out here that pinball brothers is revealing

[41:51] alien December 18 or 19th to the world.

[41:54] Now, part of me is like, is it a CGC game?

[41:56] Is it being made in Europe?

[41:57] The timing of alien coming out just a few days after Stern's new machine.

[42:02] What do you think about alien coming back?

[42:04] I think it's a good thing.

[42:05] I think any pinball machine that didn't get its due course, which alien didn't obviously

[42:10] is extremely popular title.

[42:13] And a lot of people wanted that game where it wasn't able to get it.

[42:17] I think it's a good thing.

[42:18] And more pinball in the hobby is good.

[42:21] So I'm supportive of that and happy to see that that'll come out.

[42:26] Yeah.

[42:27] Will you be distributing it?

[42:28] Have you been contacted by the pinball brothers?

[42:29] I don't have, no, I don't know them.

[42:31] I don't have any plans or have had any discussion.

[42:34] And that's not commentary one way or another.

[42:36] But did you carry highway games?

[42:38] No.

[42:39] Okay.

[42:40] Yeah.

[42:41] Smart move, by the way.

[42:42] Good.

[42:43] Congratulations on not picking up highway.

[42:45] How is Hot Wheels been selling for you?

[42:48] Hot Wheels is doing really well.

[42:51] Sold definitely more than we sold the Voktoberfest.

[42:55] And it's still going strong.

[42:57] I actually sold one yesterday.

[42:59] So it's pretty consistent once people get a chance to play and see it.

[43:03] Hot Wheels sold really well to operators.

[43:05] I can't put my finger on why, but we sold a good, a very higher percentage of Hot Wheels

[43:10] to operators than we might other games.

[43:13] Off the top of my head, pin operators that I know of, that I'm friends with, that I sell

[43:16] to, that I can probably reach out to and ask them for their honest opinion.

[43:22] And every single one and just was gushing on how well the game was doing on location,

[43:26] how reliable it was.

[43:28] So I'm really happy with it.

[43:30] When do you think their next pin will start to be on the horizon?

[43:33] You know, I'm not sure.

[43:34] We're starting to have some conversations with them.

[43:36] Actually, we have a conference call tomorrow and I'm not alluding in any way that has,

[43:40] that has anything to do with a new game reveal because it does not.

[43:44] I specifically asked that and that's not on the radar.

[43:47] It's just kind of looking back and looking forward type of call with, with their distributor

[43:51] force, you know, planning until next year, which is, which is, which is to conference

[43:55] me into that call.

[43:56] Yeah, I'm conference man.

[43:57] Yeah, cool.

[43:58] I'll do that for it.

[44:00] Oh man, that's a big.

[44:01] I got Canadian on the phone too.

[44:03] What do you got guys?

[44:05] But the only thing I do know is that probably after a few weeks that Hot Wheels was in production,

[44:13] I know Joe Balser was taking days off.

[44:16] You know, Joe was pre-involved with the production of Hot Wheels, you know, inspecting every

[44:20] game before it went out.

[44:21] Joe just has that level of care, you know, with any new title.

[44:24] I know he was putting his hands on every single game first month or whatever that the

[44:28] game's were shipping.

[44:29] Make sure that the build quality was there and, you know, the line had it right.

[44:33] No different than Eric it.

[44:34] You know, you see a lot of pictures from JGP of Eric on the line checking the games out.

[44:39] But I know at one point that Joe then had a little hiatus where he was working from home

[44:44] in peace and quiet, so to speak, to, you know, working on the design of the next game.

[44:48] So, you know, they were moving ahead with their next title back in the spring.

[44:52] Obviously there's probably a year, 18 month time frame that games get designed and before

[44:58] they're revealed and shipping and stuff like that.

[45:00] So I would think some time in 2021.

[45:04] Yeah.

[45:05] You know, AP is a smaller company and they're going to take their time and get it right

[45:13] between titles.

[45:14] Are you carrying the puny factory?

[45:17] No, no, I haven't.

[45:18] I haven't seen that.

[45:20] I'm, I'm, I know.

[45:21] Come on Chris, I love all pinball.

[45:23] You're not going to get me to say, you're not going to get me to say anything bad about

[45:26] it.

[45:27] No, no, no.

[45:28] So we've covered up on JGP, CGC, AP.

[45:30] Someone else that you cover that I, that I'm missing, that you sell?

[45:34] Spooky.

[45:35] Well, there's nothing to sell.

[45:37] You sold out of Rick and Morty's.

[45:38] I mean, yeah, but you know, they're, they're doing their thing.

[45:41] They're doing good and people are getting their Rick and Morty's and they're flying through

[45:45] their, their list as best they can.

[45:47] And the one commentary I could tell you on, on Rick and Morty's service issues have been

[45:52] literally non-existent.

[45:53] Yeah, I was talking to Chris from Kingpin who does their tech support a couple of weeks

[45:57] ago, just casually.

[45:58] And I said, I said to Chris, I said, hey,

[46:00] Chris, I got to ask.

[46:01] Okay, so I really haven't had any service issues.

[46:04] You know, you and I haven't had to talk about a customer, you know, having any, any problems

[46:08] with their games.

[46:09] And he said, no, he said it's been, been really quiet, which is good.

[46:12] So speaking of service issues, well, what was it like when you started to see guns and

[46:17] roses play fields pooling again?

[46:19] Were you just like, no, not again?

[46:21] Well, of course.

[46:22] Yeah, you don't want to see that.

[46:24] I just can't understand why we keep ending up back at this situation.

[46:28] You think it's Mirko is finally taken enough lashes from the whip and we're going to get

[46:33] perfect play fields moving forward?

[46:35] I hope so.

[46:36] Yeah.

[46:37] From what I understand, Chris, you know, I don't know.

[46:41] It was a bad batch.

[46:42] Don't give me the bad batch theory.

[46:43] It was a bad batch theory.

[46:45] It was a bad batch.

[46:47] You know, maybe there were a few games that there weren't, there weren't many of them.

[46:51] This gets amplified, Chris.

[46:53] Of course it does.

[46:54] But you get one person on the pin side and I'm not saying it's wrong.

[46:59] It's absolutely right.

[47:00] The game should be perfect.

[47:01] There should not be pooling.

[47:02] There should not be any play field issues.

[47:03] The game should work 1000%.

[47:06] These games cost way too much to have any kind of issues.

[47:08] But you know, you get one person on the pin side posting pictures and the same pictures

[47:13] keep getting circulated.

[47:15] They go on Facebook pages and it looks like 100 people have an issue when it may be two

[47:20] or three.

[47:21] We reach out on this one and say, hey, to all the G&R distributors, we've got a little

[47:25] batch that has some issues.

[47:27] We know about it.

[47:29] We're handling it.

[47:30] You know, full steam ahead.

[47:32] No, not necessarily in that manner.

[47:34] It might have been more so inquiries from a distributor asking what's what's a play here

[47:39] and give us the comfort level we need and we got that.

[47:43] I'm very comfortable with what I was told additional things that were put in place to

[47:48] ensure that they don't occur again.

[47:50] That may be worn in place before, maybe both at Mercow and both at JJP, some extra checks

[47:56] and stuff like that.

[47:57] So I'm very comfortable.

[47:59] I mean, all the parties care Chris.

[48:01] I mean, that's the bottom line.

[48:03] This isn't something that anybody wants to happen or they're looking to happen or it's

[48:08] not like they're not spending enough money so therefore this occurs.

[48:12] It's none of that.

[48:13] Well, Joe, I want to thank you for taking the time.

[48:14] It's always great to get you on the show.

[48:16] For those of you out there, Joe Newhart, Pimball Star, your Jersey Jack distributor, your Chicago

[48:21] gaming distributor, your American Pimball, I want to ask you one final question.

[48:25] As a distributor, if you had the power to tell a manufacturer, it would probably JJP, this

[48:31] is the dream theme you should make that I think would sell like hotcakes that hasn't been

[48:35] made yet.

[48:36] What theme would you recommend?

[48:38] It's funny that I've never even heard of it mentioned before.

[48:41] That's not like maybe a dream theme, but I think Lego would be a great theme possibly

[48:48] to be done.

[48:50] I sense by your silence that you don't agree, but no, no, no, no, no, because Lego, so

[48:54] no, so like my silence is just me processing and thinking about it because Lego is humongous,

[49:00] right?

[49:01] Lego has made interpretations of our favorite movies in video game format and the movies

[49:06] have been super popular.

[49:07] I think where you would, it would be tricky is would you want just Lego Lego or Lego

[49:13] that also would feature like because they've made Lego Jurassic Park, Ghostbusters, Batman,

[49:18] the IP would be difficult to throw all the stuff in it that you would want.

[49:22] That's true.

[49:23] Yeah, that's true.

[49:24] Yeah, I always looked for stuff that's unique and different.

[49:25] I thought Hot Wheels was a great, a great idea.

[49:28] But how cool would a cabinet be that was all made out of Lego's and you weigh it, you

[49:32] can make it look that way.

[49:33] That would be awesome.

[49:35] You think about it, you get, you know, objectives of the game are to build certain Lego parts

[49:40] and earn pieces and put them together.

[49:42] I mean, you know, there's multiple things that can be done there.

[49:45] I look for the unique stuff.

[49:47] I think the unique stuff is interesting.

[49:49] I thought it was really cool when American did Houdini.

[49:52] I thought that was a different theme, you know, resonates, not maybe not with everybody,

[49:57] but certainly well known.

[49:58] Obviously, big franchises with movies and bands and stuff like that.

[50:01] They're going to continue to get milked and they're going to continue to be,

[50:05] lesser franchises.

[50:07] Obviously, you got Harry Potter out there, but what other big franchises of movies,

[50:12] you know, Jaws gets mentioned a lot.

[50:14] Jaws is so not as big as people think.

[50:17] I mean, you go back and look at the box office.

[50:20] I mean, it's a great movie.

[50:22] It's one of, yeah, I think it's Spielberg's first, but it's not as big.

[50:25] It's the same thing with Goonies.

[50:26] I thought Goonies was much bigger than it actually is at the box office.

[50:30] Like, if you want to go off box office popularity, despicable me.

[50:34] And the minions, like even blows away toy story.

[50:37] I didn't even realize that until I was working on a project for them.

[50:40] You look at the numbers and there are a lot of much larger audience films that are out

[50:47] there.

[50:48] Obviously back to the future gets mentioned a lot.

[50:50] You think there's room for another.

[50:51] That would back to the future.

[50:52] That would be great.

[50:53] Yeah, absolutely.

[50:54] Yeah, I think that would be a fun theme.

[50:57] There's a lot of things could be done and maybe even with the time travel and stuff,

[51:00] you know, incorporate that into the rules in some manner.

[51:03] I think that would be a great thing.

[51:05] Even though it was done, I'm not a huge fan of redoing things that have been done before.

[51:09] I like guns and rises.

[51:10] Like, no.

[51:11] What?

[51:12] Look at a lot of the JJP games.

[51:14] The Hobbit.

[51:15] There was a Lord of the Rings.

[51:16] Pirates.

[51:17] There was a Pirates game.

[51:18] I mean, I would always gravitate to thinking something would be exciting if it was new and

[51:24] fresh and different.

[51:25] I thought Willy Wonka brought that because that's an incredible theme that haven't been

[51:28] done before.

[51:29] And, you know, I think we're going to have a lot of this look back to the 70s and 80s.

[51:33] And again, it's because of the age bracket that, you know, the buying pinball public is

[51:39] something like Jaws.

[51:41] Goonies, I don't get.

[51:42] I saw the movie for the first time this summer to drive in and like, I left me scratching

[51:48] my head.

[51:49] I can't.

[51:50] I got to disagree with you on that.

[51:51] But you've got to watch the goonies when you were a kid.

[51:53] I think that's worth an nostalgia lies.

[51:54] I think if you watch that movie as an adult, I don't think it will have the same impact.

[51:58] And especially to drive in, it's not the same as like, when you were a kid, you watch

[52:02] the goonies like over and over and over and over again.

[52:05] And you sort of, you know, when you're out in the neighborhood with your friends, you

[52:08] like, you took on the role of being the goonies.

[52:10] But Joe, anyway, thank you.

[52:11] Chris, you had a really strange childhood, bud.

[52:13] I did.

[52:14] Oh, believe me.

[52:15] I did.

[52:16] I mean, it must have been strange to lead to this point now where I'm spending too much

[52:19] of my time talking about pinball.

[52:21] But Joe, thank you so much for joining the show.

[52:24] Have an amazing holidays and congratulations on, you know, the sales year being good for

[52:29] you and the rest of the pinball distributors.

[52:31] I think it's a golden era of pinball right now with so many options.

[52:35] And I really appreciate you coming on the show again.

[52:37] And Chris, can I personally say congratulations to you and Brenda on your upcoming little

[52:43] one, you may, you may.

[52:45] And all of my efforts to name him, baby, canada have failed.

[52:48] So I got to figure out what to name this kid.

[52:50] We'll see.

[52:51] I know, I know Brenda has you in line.

[52:53] So that's, that's good.

[52:55] I'm glad that she's not giving you carte blanche on naming the baby.

[52:59] It was, it was as fast as a no as it can possibly get.

[53:02] Yeah, no, Chris, thanks for everything you do.

[53:05] Thanks for being a resource out there for a lot of people.

[53:08] I know a lot of times you hit hard with, with things.

[53:11] But, you know, I think you're the one guy out there.

[53:15] And I'm sure there's, you know, maybe some others to a lesser capacity that are holding

[53:18] companies and people that are doing things that were paying a lot of money for holding

[53:22] their feet to the fire.

[53:23] And sometimes it makes things difficult on the business side of it.

[53:27] Yeah, I might, what you do, I know you take a lot of barrels, but I appreciate that all.

[53:32] Obviously, you have a ton of listeners and bunch of twiffies on your mantle to show for

[53:36] some things.

[53:37] Maybe, maybe there might be a fourth.

[53:39] We'll see.

[53:40] We'll see.

[53:41] You got to, you got to stop disappearing and coming back.

[53:42] I know.

[53:43] Well, people got to stop threatening me every other way.

[53:45] Yeah, I don't go for that either.

[53:47] That's right.

[53:48] That's not a good thing either.

[53:49] But I'm glad you're back and, and it's good that, you know, you entertain us all on our,

[53:54] on our drives and, and in the car and all that good stuff.

[53:57] So, thanks for what you do.

[53:58] No, anytime, Joey, I appreciate that.

[54:00] No, thank you so much, brother.

[54:01] Okay.

[54:02] The fun is the end of my pretty course.

[54:05] The soon go away play.

[54:07] Find the balls are ringing out for Christmas day.
