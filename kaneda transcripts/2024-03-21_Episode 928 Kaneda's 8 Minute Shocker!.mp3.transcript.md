[00:00] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:16] I've heard the feedback.

[00:17] You guys are starting to say, Canada's giving people on Facebook the news, rumors and scoops

[00:22] before he gives them to his paying customers.

[00:25] We got Kerry Hardy not trying to say my name.

[00:27] He can say six Twippies right now, baby, because I'm about to show all of you right

[00:31] now why Canada is the world's number one pinball podcaster.

[00:35] It's not because of my great sartorial senses.

[00:38] It's not because of my beautiful wife.

[00:40] It's not because I fill the pinball airwaves every single week with the most entertaining

[00:44] content.

[00:45] It's because I'm going to give you stuff no one else is going to give you.

[00:48] And I'm going to give it to you live and I'm going to give it to you raw and I'm going

[00:51] to give it to you before anyone else even gives it to you.

[00:53] So are you ready right now, ladies and gentlemen?

[00:55] I don't need to do two hour shows.

[00:57] I don't even need to do 20 minute shows.

[00:59] I can do a 10 minute show and get the whole pinball world talking.

[01:03] Heck, I could do this in five minutes and you're going to say my name.

[01:06] Don't make videos and you can't say the name.

[01:08] It's Canada, ladies and gentlemen, and he's about to drop it like it's hot.

[01:12] Even if Jason Knapp won't cover my funhouse news, I'm going to drop it like it's hot.

[01:17] Now here is.

[01:18] Here is the biggest news that's going to rock the pinball world.

[01:22] It's not whether or not Stern pinball is going to sell for like a hundred million dollars.

[01:26] And we all know Seth Davis.

[01:28] He's in there just to pump the price up, to pump the volume up, to pump their books up,

[01:33] and then he's going to sell the company and it'll probably end up in disaster.

[01:36] No, here's the big news in the pinball world.

[01:39] It's not that Elton John C.E.'s are shipping.

[01:41] It's not that pinball life is sold out of I.O. boards for guns and roses owners.

[01:46] You want to know the number one thing that's going to get everybody talking and make sure

[01:50] when you take this to pin side and you take it to Facebook that you say my name because

[01:55] Canada is here to confirm for you something nobody knows.

[01:58] Remember when I told you, you're like, Canada, just say it.

[02:01] Remember when I told you that James Bond was going to have a fourth version of the game

[02:05] and everybody thought I was lying?

[02:07] It made John over at Jack Bar have to subscribe and I see my competition, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:12] They're starting to go negative.

[02:13] They're trying to get some edginess to their content.

[02:15] It's never going to work because they're never going to do what I'm going to do right now.

[02:19] Are you ready for it?

[02:20] Here we go.

[02:21] I'm here to tell you right now.

[02:22] The next game from Stern Pinball is John Wick.

[02:25] Now you know that, but here's what you don't know.

[02:27] The next game from Stern Pinball is not going to be designed by anybody you know.

[02:34] Let me repeat that.

[02:35] John Wick is going to be a brand new designer with Stern Pinball.

[02:40] It is not going to be Jack Danger.

[02:42] It's not Keith Elwin.

[02:44] It's not anybody you've ever, ever heard of.

[02:46] It's not George Gomez.

[02:48] It's not Brian Eddy.

[02:49] It's a brand new designer.

[02:52] Now take that to the bank.

[02:54] Take that to pin side and get everybody talking and get everybody subscribing.

[02:58] All right.

[02:59] Am I done?

[03:00] Am I over with my news for the day?

[03:01] I'm not.

[03:02] I'm going to hit you again.

[03:03] The one-two punch from Canada.

[03:05] Six-time Trippy Award-winning pinball podcaster.

[03:08] The numbers don't lie.

[03:10] If you saw my W-2s, I'm running circles around all these other phonies who are shilling every

[03:15] single company.

[03:16] I ain't shilling nobody.

[03:17] I'm just giving you the heat.

[03:18] All right.

[03:19] Here's the next bit of news you don't know for sure, but I'm going to confirm it for you

[03:22] right now.

[03:23] Spooky Pinball is making, guaranteed they're making this game.

[03:28] They are making Beetlejuice.

[03:29] And not only that, not only are they making Beetlejuice, but they are going to have Christopher

[03:34] Franci on the art package of Beetlejuice.

[03:37] And this is going to happen.

[03:38] If this doesn't happen, I'm turning the show off for a month.

[03:41] Why do you think Christopher Franci, his booth at TPF, was right next to Spooky Pinball's

[03:47] booth?

[03:48] So Beetlejuice from Spooky Pinball coming out soon.

[03:52] All right.

[03:53] I'm hearing that the next Spooky game is going to be revealed in December of 2024.

[03:59] That makes total sense.

[04:00] That's always how they do it.

[04:02] So they're up to like a new game every year.

[04:04] And Beetlejuice 2, the movie, is coming out in September of 2024.

[04:10] So this would seemingly make a lot of sense.

[04:12] So Beetlejuice, Spooky Pinball.

[04:14] I also hear they have the license for Gremlins.

[04:17] I also hear they might have Sonic the Hedgehog.

[04:19] The two I feel the best about are Beetlejuice and Evil Dead.

[04:22] I think those are definitely happening over at Spooky Pinball.

[04:26] Canada, why you got to do this?

[04:28] Why you got to drop this stuff?

[04:29] Why you got to tell us now that John Wick is not going to be designed by John Borg or

[04:34] Jack Danger or Keith Elwin or Brian Eddy or anyone over there?

[04:38] Everybody, this is the world's favorite pinball podcaster because I don't care about burning

[04:43] relationships with any of these companies.

[04:45] The moment I hear something, you're going to hear it.

[04:48] All right.

[04:49] So I'm going to be here for like five minutes and I just gave you some really, really juicy

[04:54] stuff.

[04:55] I just want to say this for the record.

[04:56] Look, I know when the games are not exciting, I know that pinball content creators can start

[05:00] to go at each other.

[05:02] I know I fired some shots and it's nothing personal against Kari Hardy.

[05:06] He should stop aiding and abetting Damien.

[05:09] That's my beef.

[05:10] Kari's content is still amazing.

[05:12] It's not his fault.

[05:13] I would be caught nowhere near a Haggis Pinball product right now.

[05:17] You know why?

[05:18] Because there's one question that all of us need answered.

[05:21] It's not whether or not canada and carry our friends.

[05:24] We're still friendly.

[05:25] There's no love lost in any of this.

[05:26] Here's the main thing.

[05:28] I just want to know how many fathoms are there left to be built?

[05:32] That is it.

[05:33] That is the question.

[05:34] Shouldn't you know that?

[05:35] If a man is saying to you, I'm going to finish building these games by the end of the year,

[05:40] then how many do you have to build?

[05:42] Why is all of this a mystery?

[05:44] I think the guy is out of money and I think time is running out on Haggis Pinball and

[05:48] I don't think you care.

[05:50] There's so much about to happen in Pinball.

[05:52] Beetlejuice with Franchion artwork.

[05:54] We're going to get the matrix and back to the future.

[05:57] Hard stop right there.

[05:58] Those three themes alone are going to be take my money now themes.

[06:02] Now just think about that.

[06:03] If you want to get each of those, that's going to run you now in the current Pinball marketplace

[06:08] about 40 to $45,000.

[06:11] If you want to buy each of those games in their nicest trim, we don't need a lot of

[06:17] games.

[06:18] We don't need a plethora of companies.

[06:19] I don't need a barbecue challenge.

[06:21] And by the way, how did David Fix get approval to make a barbecue game from a company that's

[06:28] run by Indian businessmen where the cow is a sacred creature in their culture?

[06:34] They don't eat barbecue in the Indian culture because of that.

[06:37] I'm so shocked that this guy has done everything idiotically wrong and nobody cares.

[06:43] Like the companies that are not firing on the right cylinders, it's game over.

[06:47] You know where it's not game over?

[06:48] Canada's Pinball podcast.

[06:50] And I really wanted to do this show today and just prove to all of you out there.

[06:53] I'm going to drop like an eight minute show and you're going to get more news than you've

[06:57] had in a really long time.

[06:59] And I'm confirming all of this stuff.

[07:01] Okay.

[07:02] All of this stuff.

[07:03] You're going to see John Wick, brand new designer.

[07:06] All right, everybody.

[07:07] It's going to shock everybody.

[07:08] It's going to shock everybody.

[07:10] Everybody happy Thursday.

[07:11] Go to the bar.

[07:12] Go have some happy hour.

[07:14] Don't let the pinball drama get you down.

[07:16] It never gets me down.

[07:18] Who's hot?

[07:19] Who's not?

[07:20] And who is number one?

[07:21] Canada out.
