[00:00] I get the same old dreams, same time every night, fall to the ground and I wake up.

[00:07] So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head, thoughts like back to the break-up.

[00:14] Sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a.

[00:18] Ah, welcome everybody to the world's most biased pinball podcaster. That's right, if you give me your money, I'm only gonna say nice things about you.

[00:28] We know that's not true. Everybody welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast. It's a new week.

[00:32] I was watching Killian this morning with a magic marker and a big crann and I said to myself,

[00:39] there is no way I can actually unbox any of these rare machines I have as long as Killian is running around the damn apartment with a magic marker.

[00:48] How do you keep a two-year-old kid from destroying a $25,000 Batman SLD?

[00:56] On this episode of Canada Spinball Podcast, I want to talk about remakes. I want to talk about these Bali Williams games.

[01:03] Do we need remakes of the John Papadou classics? How well will they sell? What will they price them at?

[01:09] These 2.0 kids have been pretty terrible. I mean, if that's the approach, they're gonna remake these games and then put these 2.0 kids that are pretty piss-poor.

[01:19] That's not what we want. Everyone wanted Lyman sheets to redo code on stuff like Cactus Canyon.

[01:25] So we're gonna talk about remakes and how I don't even think you need to do too much to the software.

[01:30] Just make a brand new version of these old classics and they will sell just fine.

[01:37] Because there's a dirty little secret in pinball that nobody wants to admit.

[01:41] That most collectors are you waiting for it? We suck at pinball. We're not great at pinball. We're not getting to wizard modes.

[01:49] We're not putting 500 plays on a game in a single month.

[01:52] I love it when people are like, oh, the game's so shallow, the game's so shallow.

[01:56] And meanwhile, you see these dudes with like half a million dollar collections and then they own a game for five years and they go to sell it and every 4th sale ad is the same.

[02:05] It's only got 86 games on it. Really? You had this Metallica for five years and you put 86 plays on the game.

[02:14] And look, I don't begrudge anybody who just wants to collect these things. I think my friend Chad said it best.

[02:20] These are simply movie posters that you can play. And just go look at what people will spend on old classic movie posters and what's more fun, right?

[02:30] Owning an old Star Wars movie poster or owning a Star Wars pinball machine that you can play every single day.

[02:37] But for a lot of collectors, they just love to see the Balli Williams mechanisms and the magic under the glass.

[02:43] They really don't need to have a totem that has like a super duper hard to get to Wizard Mode or auto plunges the ball when you're in the final Wizard Mode battling the genie.

[02:53] We'll talk a little bit about the remakes. We'll talk about the fact that there are new pinball companies about to throw their hat into the ring.

[03:01] I can't even believe this. I don't know a ton about these new companies. I know some of them are using the fast pinball board and that's fast all capital letters.

[03:11] Alright, cool. I don't care what board you're using. The only thing I care about with these new pinball companies is what is the theme and who is making these games.

[03:21] Like that is the two most important things that people want to know on day one when you reveal your new pinball company to the world.

[03:29] If the theme is forgettable, don't even bother making the game. I saw this new company in France is making pinball machines, right?

[03:36] I mean the image of the game itself. It's got this cartoon image by the flippers of like a pinball smirking at us. It's clearly an unlicensed theme game.

[03:47] Who out there amongst you is going to buy an unlicensed theme game from a brand new pinball company located in France?

[03:58] I mean, why are these companies even bothering? I really don't get what makes someone wake up one day and say, hey, we're going to make a pinball machine.

[04:07] We're not going to be able to compete on price. We're not going to be able to compete on theme. We're not going to be able to compete on artwork.

[04:15] We're not going to be able to compete on software. We're not going to be able to compete on mechanisms. So then why are you making a pinball machine?

[04:24] Can someone answer that question for me? Canada pinball at gmail.com. I would love to hear why anyone should get into pinball who cannot make a game better than a stern pro.

[04:33] I mean, that's just the way it goes. You know, and you could argue that maybe a spooky machine is not as good as a stern pro, but I would argue that Scooby-Doo gives you as much in a pinball going experience as a stern pro.

[04:46] I would argue CGC games do that. I would argue that Galactic Tank Force does that. And obviously, Godfather is doing that for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:55] So let's go on to Godfather real quick. I've been in the thread. I've been reading people enjoying the game. My friend Derek has the game. He's enjoying the game.

[05:04] And as I predict it, I think this game is going to be a very, and I mean it a very, very slow burn for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[05:13] There just aren't many new in-box games right now that people want that are brand new. There's a lot of older stern games that they're going to put on the line and sell to you.

[05:23] But if you want a brand new game, if you want a new pinball experience, you've got Foo Fighters, you've got the Godfather, and you've got Galactic Tank Force.

[05:34] Now, they're not really making many Galactic Tank Force games right now, but if you want to have a Godfather in your home this weekend, you most likely can have it.

[05:45] And I think Jersey Jack is going to find more and more customers with a slow burn approach to this game.

[05:51] The hardest part about this game is simply this. There's nowhere for most of us to hop on one and play it.

[05:58] Operators are not putting this game on location, and that's the biggest challenge.

[06:05] Because when you go to a pinball show and you try to play the Godfather, you're not going to walk away with a great experience, simply because pinball shows are horrible to immerse yourselves in the game itself.

[06:18] And so all we can really go on is word of mouth on pin side and maybe some streams of the game itself.

[06:26] Now, I've been watching the streams of the game. I've been hearing from my friend Derek.

[06:30] We all know the game is probably the best shooting game by Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:35] I still have yet to see anyone stream this game or anything happens in it that really is like, oh my God, did you see that happen in a pinball machine?

[06:44] And that is the thing about pinball for me is I need to see more mechanical wow happening in the game.

[06:50] And I know when you're playing the game and the shots feel right and you're progressing through the mode, I know there's a lot of satisfaction in that.

[07:00] But I would still like to see something visually, like a mode in the game, like Wonka's Room, or something like Guns N' Roses with the Light Show,

[07:09] or a T-Rex picking up the ball and throwing it around the play field, or the Stranger Things UV Kit sending me into the upside down.

[07:17] I just want to see something like the Godzilla building or the bridge falling apart.

[07:22] I just want to know what happens in Godfather that creates a magical and fun moment that you can't wait to get to over and over and over again.

[07:34] Now look, I haven't played the game. If you've played the Godfather, if you own a Godfather, can you do me a favor?

[07:40] Can you please articulate for Canada what are some of the magical wow moments you are experiencing in this game that makes me want to pull the trigger for $12,000 or $15,000?

[07:54] Thank you very much.

[07:55] And I would just love to hear it. I would love to hear from somebody.

[07:58] Alright, so Godfather sales slow burn. Everyone is now looking forward to freaking Harry Potter, which is not going to come out until like 2025.

[08:07] If they did secure the license, which it sounds like they did. And I don't believe the story.

[08:13] Do you see the story that Joe Kamikaw was working with Stern and they put in their bid too late with Warner Brothers and they like missed it by a day.

[08:23] So Jersey jack up the license. That's total BS.

[08:28] There is no way that Stern pinball, the most professional pinball company in the world was going to get one of the biggest licenses in the world and fell asleep at the wheel.

[08:41] There's just no way that happened. I don't think that's how it went down.

[08:45] I don't really care how it went down again because we're not going to see this game for like three freaking years.

[08:53] They most likely just secured the license. So let's count it.

[08:58] We've got Eric Miniers next game, which is on the line now. It's going to be on the line until the summer or fall.

[09:05] Then we've got Steve Richie's game, which I'm hearing is the Matrix and not Elton John.

[09:10] And then we've got Mark Sadden's game, which is after that. Now, Mark has already been working on his game, so it's not going to be Harry Potter.

[09:18] And at the rate at which Jersey jack releases a game, which is roughly one game every 18 months, we're not going to see this game for a very long time.

[09:28] But hey, look, I love Top Gun. I love Akira. I love fifth element. I love big trouble in little China.

[09:35] And I would be just as excited if I heard that Stern or Jersey jack pinball secured the license to one of my dream themes.

[09:43] Right? If you love Harry Potter, this is great news. Like it doesn't matter how long it's going to take.

[09:49] You would have waited an eternity for a pinball company to make your dream theme.

[09:55] And look, I hope Jersey jack knocks it out of the park. I keep saying this their next game.

[10:00] Their Steve Ritchie game is going to tell us everything about what direction this company is going in.

[10:05] They can't even give away Toy Story 4's right now. They can't give them away.

[10:09] I mean, there are distributors now in Australia selling the LEDs for a loss, ladies and gentlemen.

[10:16] They are losing money on everyone they sell because they got to get rid of them.

[10:21] Godfather's not going to set any sales records. It's not going to sell better than guns and roses.

[10:26] Godfather and Toy Story combined will not sell as well as guns and roses.

[10:32] And that's why the Steve Ritchie game is going to be so important.

[10:35] I really hope Jersey jack gets its mojo back. I don't think it really had mojo for very long.

[10:41] I think Jersey jack only really had a cool factor with guns and roses.

[10:46] And then that cool factor got erased when the playfield started falling apart.

[10:50] And Jack Guinari told everybody that it's the owner's fault that their playfields were falling apart.

[10:56] The owner's fault. And they really haven't recovered since then.

[11:00] Really Jersey jack pinball hasn't really recovered since that moment.

[11:05] And so now the playfields work. Now the game shoots better, but it's not a theme people really want.

[11:11] Two games in a row, not really a theme people want or not integrate it the way people want it.

[11:18] So this next game, if it's the Matrix, I'm hoping Steve Ritchie knocks it out of the park.

[11:23] Alright, let's talk quickly about these remake games. Tales of the Arabian Nights.

[11:28] Theater of magic. Maybe the Adams family. Most likely Twilight Zone.

[11:35] Big Bang Bar is also rumored to be coming back. What do we feel about these remakes?

[11:40] I'm just going to say this. It's really easy to think about these remakes.

[11:44] Of course they will sell, but manufacturing them has been the issue.

[11:49] Chicago Gaming Company makes an amazing product. It takes them forever to make that amazing product.

[11:57] But if you have a manufacturer making your game, you're going to want it to be a company like CGC.

[12:04] No one makes a cabinet as well as they do. Nobody makes a playfield as well as they do.

[12:09] Nobody screws together a pinball machine as good as Chicago Gaming Company.

[12:15] But they have taken forever to make these cactus candy and LEDs.

[12:20] And I think Planetary Pinball is not moving away from CGC, but they want to make more of their portfolio into machines.

[12:30] And Chicago Gaming Company just hasn't shown they can do it in an efficient way.

[12:34] So I think Planetary Pinball now is exploring Padready making games.

[12:39] They're going to be looking at anyone else out there who can manufacture and they're going to ask them,

[12:44] hey, how would you like to make a couple thousand machines?

[12:47] This is my issue with these remakes.

[12:49] Is once you announce you're going to make a remake of a classic game, people are going to want it.

[12:55] And then my concern is that these companies can't crank these games out fast enough.

[13:00] But playing Devil's Advocate, I also think collectors will wait a really long time

[13:07] for a brand new version of a game they know is incredible, a game they know is a classic,

[13:14] and having a brand new version of a classic game with all new playfield, RGB LED lights,

[13:22] new sound systems in it, maybe a new topper, maybe new inner art blades.

[13:27] Let me tell you, when I brass played at my Tales of the Arabian Nights,

[13:31] it is more stunning than any modern pinball machine.

[13:34] If you put a brass-plated totem next to a godfather, totem blows it away.

[13:41] So I think the audience will be there.

[13:43] I think the collectors will line up to buy these things.

[13:46] But I would be nervous that the quality would be there on the manufacturing,

[13:51] on the assembly of the games, if it was not made by Chicago Gaming Company.

[13:56] I also think that the 2.0 kits are doing a disservice to these classic games.

[14:02] And let's be candid here, people. These aren't just classics.

[14:05] These are considered to be like the Valley Williams games that are pretty much masterpieces.

[14:10] If you're going to redo them in modern times and add like corny code to the games

[14:16] and make the 2.0 kits pretty cheesy, what are you even bothering for?

[14:21] If you're going to try to add anything, you have to add value.

[14:26] And I think these kits are not adding value.

[14:28] Like the World Wind kit is absolutely atrocious.

[14:32] The Fun House one was alright, but I don't think it made the game much better.

[14:37] And I'm just worried.

[14:39] I don't want to play Tales of the Arabian Nights with new code that sucks.

[14:44] If you can't make it better, don't even bother trying to make kits for these machines

[14:49] because the kits are not going to sell you more games.

[14:52] Nobody's going to need a 2.0 kit to pull the trigger on any of these classic games.

[14:58] If you make them, people will buy them.

[15:01] They don't need anything else.

[15:03] And getting back to my original point, I think most collectors don't care.

[15:08] They're not getting to these deep wizard modes ever in any of these modern games.

[15:14] And I think sometimes people forget that most people that enjoy pinball actually suck at playing pinball.

[15:22] Let me repeat that.

[15:23] Most people that buy pinball machines suck at pinball.

[15:28] The reason why we suck is we can't walk up to any machine like these great league players and just blow up any game.

[15:36] That's one of the reasons why Toy Story sales were so bad is just average players were walking up to the machine

[15:42] and spending like a half hour on it.

[15:44] But for most of us, that's not why we buy pinball machines.

[15:47] Let's be honest.

[15:48] We buy pinball machines because it's a magical world under glass.

[15:53] Because the pinball machine is a three-dimensional diorama that we can put in our house that lights up,

[16:00] that has like fun toys, you turn it on and all the lights are going and the sounds are going.

[16:05] And it's like a tiny amusement park for your house.

[16:09] I mean, that is why most collectors love these things.

[16:12] Each box is a tiny amusement park world under glass that you can play and every single game is different.

[16:21] It's not like you're memorizing Donkey Kong every single game you play.

[16:25] It's going to be a different experience in the game before and that's why pinball is awesome.

[16:30] And that's why we love it.

[16:32] And that's why some of us out there want to collect pinball machines.

[16:36] And speaking of collecting, are you ready? I never do this.

[16:39] A new segment for Canada Spinball Podcast.

[16:42] We're going to call this Canada's Collectors Corner.

[16:45] And what I'm going to do, I'm going to see what games are available for sale that are targeting collectors.

[16:51] But not just any collector.

[16:52] I want to look at games that are being targeted towards the high-end collector because that's where it gets exciting.

[16:58] Like, is this game priced appropriately and do we think this game will sell at this price?

[17:05] And the last question is, do I think this game is a good investment for a collector?

[17:10] Now I know what some of you are saying.

[17:11] Well, if someone loves the game, who cares?

[17:13] Well, if that was the case, it would be boring listening to all pinball podcasts because you don't need to.

[17:17] You just buy what you love and then tune everything out.

[17:20] Alright, let's kick off Canada's Collectors Corner with Alien Pinball from Highway Pinball Game Number One.

[17:27] Home Use Only documented Alien Number 001 for 18,000 or best offer.

[17:36] So here's the funny part.

[17:37] Andrew Highway sold his personal number one to the Pinball Brothers, one of the last games built after the acquisition.

[17:45] So do I think Alien Number One is worth $18,000?

[17:51] So I don't think being Alien Number One matters.

[17:54] I don't think being the first game off the line from a pinball company that failed, that gave a lot of people heartache, is something I would invest in.

[18:05] I think if you walk up to an alien, whether it's Number One or Number 429 or Number 007, I don't really think it matters.

[18:15] In fact, I just never feel like the first one off the line really matters that much.

[18:20] And also, no other collectors really have Game Number One because usually Game Number One goes to the designer of the game.

[18:28] I think that's what they're going for here, right?

[18:30] Like, this is a rare game.

[18:31] It was Andrew Highway's personal game.

[18:33] But if I were you and you want to have an alien from Highway in your collection, I would just avoid this one and get one for a better price.

[18:43] The other thing is this.

[18:44] If I were going to collect Alien, I actually would collect the one from Highway Pinball and not the one from the Pinball Brothers because I think down the road, the original ones are going to be the more interesting ones to own.

[19:01] They have a better story.

[19:02] I like the bigger screen and I like the lit up cabinet artwork in the original Highway game.

[19:09] So that's just my opinion.

[19:11] If I were going to get an alien, I would try to get one of the ones from Highway Pinball.

[19:16] I don't know if this is possible.

[19:18] Can you take the Pinball Brothers game and can you put it inside the Highway cabinet with the bigger screen and the lit up cabinet?

[19:28] That's what I would do if that was a possibility.

[19:31] I'm not sure if the software would make that possible.

[19:34] All right.

[19:35] So there we go.

[19:36] $18,000.

[19:37] How about a game for $21,000?

[19:39] Medieval Madness Royal Edition.

[19:42] This is out of the box game home use only.

[19:47] Now this game originally sold for $10,000.

[19:50] I remember when they made the Royal editions and it was easy to get one.

[19:55] It wasn't even hard to get one.

[19:56] I would not buy this game and I'll tell you why.

[20:00] I'll tell you why.

[20:01] It's easy to replicate the Royal edition of Medieval Madness.

[20:07] It also is not that much different than the other Medieval Madness games you could get.

[20:13] I think a Medieval Madness Royal Edition, if I were going to buy one, I think $15,000 to $16,000 at most.

[20:20] $21,000 just seems bonkers for a game, especially when you can just make any other LE into a Royal edition

[20:29] because they offer the topper and other things for sale separately.

[20:33] Here's a really interesting machine for sale.

[20:36] A 24-carat gold ball-rog edition Lord of the Rings machine.

[20:42] I'm looking at the pictures of this thing.

[20:44] It's interesting.

[20:45] They've absolutely changed the cabinet artwork on Lord of the Rings.

[20:49] They've changed the armor color, but it's weird.

[20:52] It's not gold.

[20:53] $14,950 for a very personalized and customized Lord of the Rings game.

[21:01] There is no way I would ever go near a game like this.

[21:05] When you highly customize your game and once you start changing the cabinet artwork and you change the armor color on how it came from the factory

[21:15] and you make it super personalized and then you charge $15,000 for it, you're never going to get your money back.

[21:22] I don't care how much work you put into it.

[21:25] If I were going to spend $15,000 on a Lord of the Rings game, I would find myself a stern pinball, limited edition Lord of the Rings,

[21:35] which came with the beautiful real mirrored back glass.

[21:39] All you got to do is add the figurines to the game itself.

[21:42] You could get an LE in which they only made 400 of them.

[21:46] You could get it for less than $15,000.

[21:49] That's another interesting thing about collectible games.

[21:53] I don't care how much you personally modify your game.

[21:57] It is never going to be worth as much as stuff that comes from the factory when the factory stuff is rare.

[22:04] Yes, and that is why the Royal Edition will always carry a premium over a regular medieval madness LE from Chicago Gaming Company.

[22:14] I don't think that medieval madness premium should be like $5,000 or $6,000 more.

[22:18] But who knows, pinball is crazy now.

[22:20] Alright, here's a Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition out of box number 197 with 51 total plays on it.

[22:28] 51? That doesn't make any sense.

[22:30] How do you buy Guns N' Roses and only play it 51 times?

[22:36] There are 22 songs in the game.

[22:40] That means you only played each song like two times, two and a half times, and you're ready to get rid of the game?

[22:46] So do I think a GNR CE with 51 plays is worth $15,000?

[22:53] It kills me to say this, but no.

[22:55] I don't think we've seen the bottom of GNR CE prices yet.

[22:59] I think with so many LEs now trading close to high $7,000 range, it's hard to argue that a CE is worth twice the price as an LE.

[23:11] And until Jersey Jack Pinball finishes the code on Guns N' Roses or does something for CE owners,

[23:18] I mean they could easily add a new Guns N' Roses song that's available for CE owners only,

[23:25] but they're not doing anything.

[23:27] They absolutely are doing nothing to preserve the value of these CEs.

[23:31] Here's another medieval madness royal edition for $25,000 firm.

[23:37] I don't know.

[23:38] Stupid.

[23:39] There's a bunch of Foo Fighter LEs for sale for $14,500.

[23:42] I would just wait on Foo Fighters.

[23:44] There's a lot of them out there.

[23:46] The premium looks exactly the same.

[23:49] I don't think Foo Fighters LE differentiates enough from the premium,

[23:54] and I think we're going to see Foo Fighters LEs after all thousand are made and unboxed or most are unboxed.

[24:01] I think you're going to see Foo Fighters easy to get at like $13,000 or $12,500.

[24:07] There's a Godzilla LE for $15,000 firm.

[24:10] Godzilla's are coming down in value.

[24:12] Godzilla LEs opened up.

[24:14] Have always been around $15,000 to $16,000.

[24:18] New in box.

[24:19] They were going for like $18,000, $19,000.

[24:21] Here's my prediction on Godzilla again with a thousand LEs.

[24:25] If you're a collector, just wait.

[24:28] These games are going to keep sinking down lower and lower, especially if two things happen.

[24:34] Keith Elwood makes a new game that people enjoy even more,

[24:38] and it's based on a theme people want even more than Godzilla.

[24:42] But there's no denying the fact that Godzilla is one of the best Pimol machines ever made,

[24:47] one of the best theme integrated machines ever made,

[24:50] and a game that is this great, should, and will, and is holding value very nicely for collectors.

[24:58] The only thing missing from Godzilla for me is this.

[25:01] When you make a thousand LEs, nothing really feels that collectible.

[25:08] It feels like every single collector who wants one can have one.

[25:13] And in the world of collecting, that is not interesting.

[25:17] That is not unique.

[25:19] That does not feel rare.

[25:21] And that's the problem with a thousand LEs moving forward for all of you collectors out there.

[25:25] If you really want to collect stuff, that's going to hold value

[25:29] and make people get ready for it because part of collecting is

[25:33] you want to make other people who are collectors a little bit envious that you have one.

[25:39] And I don't think any of these thousand LE games are going to make people feel that way

[25:45] unless the theme is something like Back to the Future,

[25:49] in which five thousand people want an LE,

[25:51] and snagging one of those thousand LEs was really hard to get.

[25:55] Here's an interesting one.

[25:57] The Monster's Limited Edition Newinbox with Topper.

[26:01] Brand new game.

[26:03] Newinbox for seventeen thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars.

[26:07] Now that's a lot of money.

[26:09] But the reason why it's eighteen grand is the Monster's Topper alone.

[26:15] And I mean this alone is worth three thousand dollars at least on today's market.

[26:22] So that means they're selling a Monster's LE for fifteen thousand dollars.

[26:26] I actually don't like buying a Newinbox game.

[26:29] I don't like paying for the box because the moment you open up that Newinbox Monsters,

[26:35] you just threw away a two to three thousand dollar cardboard box.

[26:41] So if I were looking for a Monster's LE with the Topper,

[26:46] I would try to find one that's been opened up and pay closer to fourteen to fifteen for one.

[26:53] I don't think Monster's is a game I would collect unless I was a diehard Monster's fan

[26:58] because I still think the code is not where it should have been.

[27:02] And I think after Batman 66, the Monster's still feels like an incomplete game.

[27:09] When you look at how much, how much of the TV show made its way into the game,

[27:14] and then you go play the Monsters and it feels empty next to Batman.

[27:18] I would much rather buy this game a Newinbox Elvira's House of Horrors 40th anniversary.

[27:25] This is twenty two nine or best offer.

[27:28] I think you could offer distributors nineteen or eighteen for Newinbox Elvira 40th.

[27:33] I'll tell you why.

[27:34] And information is power people.

[27:36] We all know that distributors paid stern fifteen thousand dollars for this game.

[27:43] So any penny over that, any penny over that is profit in the pocket of the distributor.

[27:51] And the majority of these Newinbox Elvira's, they're being sold by distributors.

[27:58] So you go to a distributor say, hey, look, man, I'm going to put eighteen thousand cash on the table.

[28:03] You're making three thousand dollars cash.

[28:06] Don't even report it.

[28:07] And we both get a win-win.

[28:09] I don't think you need to spend twenty three thousand dollars to get a Newinbox Elvira 40th.

[28:14] There are a ton of foo fighters sitting at fourteen five or fourteen nine.

[28:18] Trust me, they're not selling at that price too high.

[28:21] All right, let's end this segment with three more games are going for high prices.

[28:25] So it goes Buster's L.E. for fifteen five one owner less than three hundred plays.

[28:32] I mean, I love descriptions of games less than three hundred plays.

[28:36] This game is six years old.

[28:38] I would put three hundred plays on a Ghostbusters in one month.

[28:43] This is a six year old pin.

[28:45] The problem with saying how many plays the game has, everybody knows this.

[28:50] I believe when you update the code, you can reset total games played.

[28:54] I'm not sure if that's changed on the new codes with stern machines.

[28:57] So fifteen five for a Ghostbusters L.E. do I think that's a good buy?

[29:01] There's only four hundred of them.

[29:03] I got to be honest, if there's a thousand foo fighter L.E.'s and everyone's

[29:07] asking fourteen five for a foo fighter L.E.

[29:10] Arguably, it shoots better than Ghostbusters easily shoots better.

[29:15] But Ghostbusters, there are only five hundred of them and Ghostbusters has a prettier art package.

[29:22] And Ghostbusters, I would argue is a much more popular theme for pinball.

[29:27] Now look, foo fighters, the better pinball experience, but that's not why collectors collect.

[29:32] I think Ghostbusters L.E. for fifteen five.

[29:36] Is that a good buy?

[29:38] Still a little too high for me.

[29:40] It's still a little too high for me.

[29:42] If it came with the topper for like sixteen five, I might consider it, but fifteen five, I wouldn't do it.

[29:49] I'll tell you why, because something weird has happened with collecting Ghostbusters pinball machines.

[29:55] To really have the complete game, you need the damn topper.

[29:59] Stern didn't make many of them and people sell this damn topper for like four to five thousand dollars now.

[30:06] So if you have a Ghostbusters L.E. with the topper, you're looking at eighteen to twenty thousand dollars easily for the game.

[30:15] And again, I'm looking at this through the lens of a collector.

[30:18] I would hate to spend fifteen five on a Ghostbusters and then have to spend more time trying to hunt down the damn topper.

[30:28] So if I was going to collect a Ghostbusters, I would have to wait until a machine with the topper came up for sale.

[30:37] Because we all know this people, if you've got fifteen five burning a hole in your pocket and you're a pinball collector, you can afford twenty thousand dollars for the Ecto one topper version.

[30:48] Let's end this on the final game.

[30:50] There are two Pirates of the Caribbean collectors editions.

[30:54] The CE only two hundred ever made Jersey Jack Pinball's second rarest collectors edition game.

[31:02] The number one rarest is dialed in Pirates CE thirty two thousand firm.

[31:10] And then there's another one for thirty six thousand dollars.

[31:15] Here's my favorite part about the listing for this second CE for thirty six brand new.

[31:22] No games have been played on this machine, but it has been removed from the box and placed in the game room.

[31:30] Topper is still boxed.

[31:33] This is Pinsider L. Tizzle from Temicola, California.

[31:39] This kind of makes me sad.

[31:41] Think about this for a moment, but this reinforces my belief that the high end collectors barely play their machines.

[31:50] This guy bought the game, put it in his game room and has never played a single game on it.

[31:59] So there are no dimples.

[32:01] There's nothing.

[32:02] There's no pooling.

[32:04] There's nothing.

[32:05] I want to stand over that game and see absolutely no play field where whatsoever.

[32:12] Why even bother putting the balls in the game?

[32:15] Did he even turn it on?

[32:16] Why risk having an LED burnout?

[32:19] I mean, it does make me sad.

[32:21] See, I don't really like this.

[32:23] I love a collector that buys high end stuff, but bangs on the game like play the game.

[32:30] Don't buy a game and never play it.

[32:33] I don't feel like that's a fulfilling life at all.

[32:36] Why did they even make a game that can be played if you're never going to play it?

[32:41] Am I being judgmental?

[32:42] Yes.

[32:43] Are people who live like this OCD wealthy?

[32:47] Yes, they are.

[32:48] But I think that's sad.

[32:50] Like I really do.

[32:51] I really want you.

[32:52] If you're going to collect anything, whether it's watches or pinball or cars or bottles of wine, you eventually should freaking use it.

[33:02] Let me know what you guys think of Canada's Corner and me giving you my opinion on some of these really expensive collectible pins.

[33:09] I think it's fun to talk about some of these high end games and see where people are pricing them at.

[33:13] Everybody, it's good to be back.

[33:15] As you can hear, I'm getting over a cold.

[33:17] I've had a really hard time sleeping.

[33:19] I haven't slept in five days, but it's always fun making episodes of Canada's Pinball podcast.

[33:24] And we'll be back real soon with more shows talking about what's going on in pinball.

[33:28] And trust me, a lot is about to happen.

[33:31] These new companies are going to try to prove they can make it.

[33:34] And there's going to be a lot of new games making their way to market over the next few months.

[33:38] I can't wait to cover it.

[33:40] Canada out.

[34:01] Canada out.
