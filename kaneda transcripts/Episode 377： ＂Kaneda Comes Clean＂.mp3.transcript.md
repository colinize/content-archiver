[00:00] You know, I think to start episode 377 of Canatus Pimball Podcast, a podcast in which I'm coming clean.

[00:07] I'm telling you guys 100% the truth. I should start out by coming clean. I do have a little clip

[00:16] of an unreleased Guns and Roses song you've never heard. So let's start the show with that awesome song

[00:21] that just rocks. I wish Axel would have released this. This comes from the Chinese democracy error

[00:27] and it's a song that he never put out there. Enjoy this.

[00:57] Isn't that an awesome song? Don't you wish Axel would have just had confidence in himself and

[01:02] released hard rocking songs like that? I mean Guns and Roses was always about high energy stuff.

[01:09] Anyway, on this episode 377 of Canatus Pimball Podcast, Canatus coming clean. I'm going to tell you

[01:17] everything that's been going on in the Pimball world, in my world within the Pimball world.

[01:22] And I want you to just make up your mind on whether or not a few things you want to keep listening

[01:28] to the show. If you think I'm a dirt bag for some of the things that are happening in my Pimball world,

[01:34] I leave it up to you, the listener of the show, to judge me however you see fit. And I get judged a lot.

[01:43] I put myself out there a lot. I'm a very public person. I don't hide anything from you and I think

[01:50] it's time to come clean on a few Pimball related items. Are you ready? Number one, I do have a big

[01:58] Lebowski on order. I grabbed one of the ARA spots. We're going to talk about that. I also

[02:07] am not currently planning to get a Willy Wonka. And when I decide it not to go in on Wonka,

[02:15] after seeing the way the code was developing, I decided to go grab a game that I had been very

[02:21] critical of because I wanted to see if it was as good as everyone says it is. And the other

[02:28] thing everyone was saying is you have to play this game in a home environment. And so the only

[02:34] way for me to do that is to actually put it in a home environment. Aren't I really smart? And so

[02:40] the game that I put a deposit down on is a beautiful collector's edition of Pirates of the Caribbean.

[02:49] And I gave a non-refundable deposit on it. Now this happened before I knew the ARA big Lebowski's

[02:57] who are going to be available. Now if you know me, you know my dilemma of space in this apartment.

[03:04] Okay, we're going to get to that. The third thing that I want to come clean on is yes.

[03:09] Pinquest is a sponsor of Canada's Pinball Podcast. Neil is a great guy working on a great product

[03:17] that is going to make playing pinball on location more fun for people. I've talked him a few times,

[03:23] but in no way should people boycott anything he's doing to make pinball playing more fun for people.

[03:31] And I also have 42 people who donate to Canada's Pinball Podcast on a monthly basis. Now let

[03:37] me break down the numbers for you. I'm going to be fully transparent. You know, I've always been

[03:42] one of the only fully transparent pinball personalities out there. For better or for worse, you can

[03:49] either like me or hate me. But there's a reason why my podcast has always always shown you how many

[03:56] people listen to every show. I've never hit it. And you could go over the years and watch this show

[04:02] go from 100 listeners to 1500 to 2000 to 2500. I've always let you see how popular we are. I don't

[04:11] hide it like other, you know, pinball podcasters that are out there. And everyone has their own reason

[04:17] for for where they are. Okay. I also don't hide the fact that I have 42 Patreon subscribers. But

[04:25] here's what they net me out on a monthly basis. This is how much money I make for all the hours

[04:31] and years. I give you guys in terms of free pinball entertainment. I don't charge you for the show.

[04:37] I have 42 people who support the show. And that nets me 268 dollars per month before taxes. Because

[04:47] you pay taxes on these Patreon subscriber donations. All right. So look, I'm not doing this to make

[04:54] a lot of money. I'm not doing this to be famous. I'm not doing this to become wealthy. I am simply

[05:00] doing this because I love pinball. And I love the conversation and the point of view about pinball

[05:07] that I get to think about and deliver to you on a weekly basis. I love the personalities that I

[05:12] get to interview. And I love the topics we get to discuss. I'm super excited for what's to come in

[05:18] pinball this fall. But I'm always been very transparent. Okay. And so I want to be transparent on a

[05:25] few things on this show. And I want to be very honest with you about where I'm at. Okay.

[05:31] So first of all, I want to thank all the people who donate to this show. They don't own me. I don't

[05:37] hold back. You know, I don't change my tune because someone donates and sponsors the site. I think

[05:43] I still call it like it is. Some of you still can't get over some of the bad things I've said are

[05:49] done in the past. I've apologized for every single thing that needed to be apologized for. And then

[05:56] some, and I think most of us have moved on, which is good. Life is about moving on and learning from

[06:01] our mistakes. And I think we have done that. Okay. So is buying the big Lebowski a mistake? Is it

[06:08] something I never should have done? Now, you know me. I've always been very transparent about the

[06:13] fact that I am a pinball speculator that there are times when I will buy a game. For the sole

[06:19] purpose of maybe flipping it for a little bit of a profit because I know there's a higher demand

[06:25] for the game than there is supply. Now, some people just hate that. I get it. It's annoying. People do

[06:30] it in the car industry. They do it in the watch industry. They do it in the wine industry. I mean,

[06:34] it happens anywhere where demand outweighs supply. Okay. Now, on my pinball speculation moments,

[06:44] I've lost money mainly because magic girl was a huge financial loss for me on different levels.

[06:51] And I speculated there, if magic girl was working, I would have hit the jackpot. If I'm working

[06:57] John Poppidoo, magic girl came out and there were only 20 in the world, my $23,000 purchase,

[07:04] I know I cringe when I think how much I paid for that would have been worth double that. And we

[07:09] know it would have. It would have, especially if deep root didn't have plans to remake a rumour.

[07:14] Back then, I was just simply operating under the notion that John would make a working game.

[07:20] An American pinball wouldn't be a bunch of fools for letting him tinker in their back room for a

[07:24] year and deliver that turd. Okay. I knew what you knew. And I just I had expectations. Okay.

[07:31] I made a few bucks on selling a Batman Ellie and a Ghostbusters Ellie. Now, the big Lebowski,

[07:38] I've been speculating four months of the game is going to be coming back out. And I knew,

[07:43] and you all knew this too, you had to be foolish, the ARA games were going to go back out for sale.

[07:49] They were going to do it. We all knew that Dutch pinball was at a money that the ARA, sorry,

[07:56] the ARA deal fell through because Dutch pinball did not have money to pay the vendor. And so what did

[08:02] you think was going to happen to those games? Did you think they were just going to go to early

[08:05] achievers when there was no money to pay the bill to release the games? I mean, ARA won the lawsuit

[08:12] and the opportunity came to get a game. Now, there are some people who are like, you're scumbag.

[08:16] I mean, I have people that I'm friends with that are like, if you buy one of these, I may never

[08:20] talk to you again in your POS and your scumbag and you're how could you buy a game that belongs

[08:25] to somebody else? I get that people feel that way. All right. And I'm sorry people lost money on

[08:31] the big Lebowski. But today, those games were going to go up for sale. Okay. So you might think

[08:38] I'm a scumbag for buying one. Okay. I can't change your mind on that. I've always wanted a big Lebowski

[08:43] and this is the only chance I have to buy one. There's no other chance. There are no games for sale.

[08:48] If one did go up for sale, it would be $20,000. So now I have a chance to buy one for $12,500.

[08:54] Okay. Now, putting that money out there for Lebowski has made getting hired to the Caribbean

[09:01] not really feasible for me right now because I don't have room for it. And I also don't want to spend

[09:08] $25,000 on two Pimble machines. I don't really have the financial ability this year to put so much

[09:17] into PIN. I'm still well financially. Don't worry. It's just like I'm doing a honeymoon and

[09:23] Brendan and I are trying to have a family. We're doing stuff on that front that's expensive.

[09:27] There's a lot of expenses. And so I just don't have that kind of PIN money or play money.

[09:36] I don't want to spend $50,000 this year on just unnecessary. When things like my honeymoon

[09:42] mean more to me and having a family means more to me. So I gave a non-refundable deposit on

[09:49] the pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition. And I will I will stay to my word on that deposit I

[09:54] gave that gentleman. Very nice man. Beautiful machine. Beautiful machine. Mint has every mod in it

[09:59] that you're going to want. He's waited to install the cliffies and all the protectors on the play field

[10:04] and all the stuff that will like, you know, people I've been like frustrated by with the game.

[10:10] Now, that's where I'm at right now. Two days. Chris talking to you. I won't even use Canadian.

[10:16] Chris just talking to you. I have a big Lebowski and I have a pirate CE deposit down. Now I'm here

[10:22] to tell you as you know, for you listening to the show. If anyone wants a pirate to the Caribbean

[10:27] collectors edition or knows of someone who wants one, I will happily talk to you about getting

[10:34] that machine. And it's going for less than some of the ones I've seen on PINSIDE cell four.

[10:41] But you know, it's a brand new machine with all the mods. It's you know, don't think it's going

[10:44] to be low lesser than 12,500. It's not. I think I listed it for 14,000 and like everything that you

[10:51] pay for you're getting in the game. Now, if you're interested, let me know. Hit me up at

[10:55] CanadaPimball at gmail.com. I'm not trying to flip this thing for a profit. I'm just trying to maybe

[11:00] move my deal to someone else. Now, the big Lebowski's different. We all know. We all know this game

[11:07] is worth more than 12,500 dollars because the chance of Barry figuring this stuff out and Dutch Pimball

[11:12] becoming a real viable Pimball company again is still a long shot. It's a moon shot. So then the

[11:19] question becomes is this. Then I want to talk to you candidly and I want to talk to you honestly.

[11:24] It's like, what am I allowed to do with this game if I bought it? There is a huge camp of people

[11:30] that thinks you're just a scumbag for buying it. Okay, I get it. I've lived my whole life

[11:35] with people being pissed at me for certain decisions I make to Pimball decision. I'm sorry that

[11:41] guys lost 8,500 dollars. I did not rob those gentlemen. Barry did and the op did. I didn't do that

[11:48] to them. These games are ARA's property right now. I think that's a point people just don't

[11:53] they it's this isn't like Barry's gonna sail off into the sunset with hundreds of thousands of

[11:59] dollars because of this money that's being generated. All right, so I didn't I didn't create that

[12:04] situation. All I know is these games were available and I want one. Okay, and people are gonna buy them

[12:08] without a doubt these games sold out before the next morning even happened once once you know,

[12:13] people caught wind of the fact that coin taker was gonna distribute these games. And remember,

[12:19] way back when I said alien and libousky would be available again to purchase, you know, people

[12:25] called me crazy. I haven't doubted it. I you know, look the game's not back into production the way

[12:30] I thought it would be. That's what people told me rumor wise. But you know, the games are now,

[12:35] you know, 40 people are gonna get libouskeys and unbox them in the near future in August,

[12:40] you know, this year, which I didn't think was gonna happen now. As a grown adult who made the

[12:46] decision to get this game, I think then the question becomes, is it morally reprehensible for me

[12:53] to flip this game if I can't put it in my house? Let's just say I decide to go with Pirates of the

[13:00] Caribbean next to Batman 66 that I have a libousky inbox that I just don't even have any room for.

[13:07] What do I do with it? What would you do with it? I mean email me at canadapinballadgmail.com.

[13:14] It is, is it should I sell it for 12,500 to someone else who wants it and not make a easy profit on it?

[13:23] Should I flip it and make a profit and, you know, be damned the people that are always crying about,

[13:29] you know, flipping, you know, machines for money. That's not right. Like it's not fair. Like I get it.

[13:35] I get it. Like there's a lot in life. My friends, that's not fair and flipping non-essential toys and

[13:42] limited edition things happens in every single hobby. It happens in the car hobby, the watch hobby.

[13:48] And, you know, should you be rewarded for getting in early for building those relationships with

[13:54] the people that can give you access to these things where it doesn't matter. You know, it's look,

[14:00] everyone's going to have a different opinion about this. I don't feel great about it. I have to be

[14:04] honest. I also don't think this deal is going to go as smoothly as everyone thinks. I am, but again,

[14:12] I'm always going to be someone of a pinball speculator and an opportunity to get a libousky at 12,500.

[14:20] To me, was like a no-brainer. And some of the people that listened to my show way back when I said it was

[14:25] going to, those games are going to be available for sale. A lot of those people, a lot of those games

[14:30] are going to people who contacted Cointaker and got on the list. Okay. So, you know, that's where I'm

[14:36] at today. And it's been weighing on my mind a lot recently because this stuff is happening quickly

[14:43] with ARA and Barry. Right. We saw the news today. If you didn't see this, I think he has to pick up

[14:49] the games from ARA by tomorrow. And he's inspecting them and apparently putting you code in. And he

[14:55] also has parts supposedly to build a hundred more games. Do I think he's going to be successful

[15:02] in assembling 100 more the big libouskeys? No, I don't. I think this whole thing has been a cluster F.

[15:12] And it's been a cluster for years. And it's been nothing but, you know, wishful thinking and what

[15:19] ifs and months and months of silence and months and months of spin. And nothing is ever point it

[15:26] like things are going in the right direction. And so why would I believe that now it's going to

[15:33] work out? You know, I was listening to Jonathan Houston's podcast talking about it. And it's

[15:38] amazing. Even after all this crap, after all the missed chances and opportunities, he's like

[15:45] still confident. It's all going to work out. And I don't have that level of optimism.

[15:52] You know, and then what are the value of these machines? If more are made, I still think these

[15:58] games, I've always said this. I've always said this. A big libouskey. If there's only like three to

[16:04] 500 ever made in the world, they are, they are 12,500 dollar games all day long. If they make a

[16:12] thousand or two thousand, they're not. And it all comes down to that the less they make, the more

[16:18] they're worth. And people were selling new inbox. I think I think a new inbox won sold for 25,000

[16:26] dollars when there are only like, you know, like 38 out in the world, they're 40. It's just the nature

[16:32] of this hobby. You have thousands of people with collections and only 80 games to go around. And

[16:38] remember, this isn't like 80 super Ellie batman's where you can still get a catwoman edition or

[16:44] premium batman and have the same exact great game. No, this is only 80. There's only 80 physical

[16:51] places on planet earth that you can stand and play a big libouskey. That is why the value is there.

[16:57] And you all know this. This is nothing new. This is nothing revolutionary in the world of collectibles.

[17:04] You know, for a lot of you out there, I think a pinball machine being a collectible, you're

[17:09] disgusted by it. You want as many people as possibly there can be to jump on and enjoy every single

[17:16] pin. And that's cool. That is fine. It's okay that you want it to be that. But in the world of the

[17:21] collectible, the guy that wants the high end rare collection, that doesn't appeal to him. He doesn't

[17:28] want to own the thing that everybody has. He doesn't want to have the watch that everybody has. He

[17:31] doesn't want to drive the car that everybody has. And you can hate those people. But there's a

[17:37] market for people like that. And that's that's that's all I'll say on that matter. Okay. So I don't

[17:44] know. I haven't done anything. I've listed Lebowski for sale on Facebook part of why. And I'm going

[17:49] to be honest. I do this stuff because I love to see the way people react. It's so funny to me how

[17:55] bent out of shape people get. And here's how I listed the big Lebowski. I said, I might have a big

[18:01] Lebowski for sale. I listed it for a dollar. I said, PM me with an offer and we'll go from there.

[18:08] I'm not setting a price. Now whenever you do that, when you don't set a price and you just say,

[18:13] make me an offer, people go nuts. They they PM you they insult you. How dare you? How could you do

[18:20] this? You're not allowed to do it. And let me just say this. I'm allowed to do whatever I want

[18:25] with what I have. I can do whatever I want. I can list Batman SLE for $20,000. Guess what? I did.

[18:32] Guess what? I got offers that were near $20,000. Meanwhile, there's people crying that like I'm trying

[18:39] to rip off people that it's not worth anything. It's if it's not worth anything. It's just not worth

[18:44] anything to you. And here's the thing. It's okay that it's not worth anything to you. But all I need

[18:53] is it to be worth that to one person. And that's the nature of collectibles and trading and putting

[19:03] value on items that are meaningless. If you don't think that a pinball is a meaningless thing in life,

[19:10] it is. It's meaningless. We give it meaning. You give it meaning. We give it value. You give it value.

[19:18] These things are not necessary on any level. If pinball went away tomorrow, you still would be fine.

[19:28] Okay. You might not think it, but you would. So I don't know. Shall I let you guys decide?

[19:34] So someone said this. They said this. If you flip it for a profit, are you going to give your money

[19:40] to the people that got screwed over by the game? Now, how would you do that? Let's say hypothetically.

[19:46] I sell this thing for $20,000. And I've got what? Like $7,500 profit. Okay. What should I do with that

[19:55] money? How should I give that back to the EA's? Should I give each of them divvy it up and give

[20:02] them each a couple hundred bucks? Is everyone who buys a Lebowski obligated to somehow give restitution

[20:10] to those who got screwed? I mean, I get it. It we're all anyone who buys a Lebowski is going to be

[20:18] dragged into this vortex of negativity of anger. And I went through this with magic girl. This is

[20:25] the same thing. It was the you know, the raza people were saying, how dare you get a magic girl that

[20:31] was built using the money I gave to build. Raza, I've gone down this road. It's no fun. The only

[20:38] difference here is we at least know that Lebowski works. Unlike magic girl, that was just a joke

[20:46] when you plunge that game. So I don't email me at canadapimbal at gmo.com. Tell me you're going to stop

[20:52] listening to the show because I've told you what honestly is happening in the Pimbal World.

[20:58] You know, I hope none of you stop listening. I hope you're entertained by this show.

[21:03] And if it's all too much for you to handle, the good news is there's like 30 something

[21:08] of their Pimbal podcast that are out there. I even think Nate shivers is coming back to do

[21:12] Stern's insider Pimbal podcast that you're going to have to pay money for to listen to it.

[21:17] Enjoy that. All right. Come on. My God. Right. So here's that's my take. You know, and I'll say this.

[21:25] I'll say this. And I'm going to be totally honest. I'm just telling you guys how I feel.

[21:30] All this stuff, all this stuff has not been enjoyable. It has it. It hasn't. When you're, you know,

[21:38] this money is not going to change my life. If I flip one in these machines, it's not going to change

[21:42] anything about, you know, my enjoyment of the hobby. In fact, when you when you jump into these

[21:48] elements of the hobby where there is drama and there's people who got burned, you know, it's

[21:53] it's the reason why I love just everything Stern does and Jersey Jack does and, you know,

[21:59] American Pimbal does and Chicago gaming. The reason why I talk about those companies all the time

[22:03] is spooky Pimbal. You know, they don't rip people off. You know, there's no one's no one's on a

[22:08] witch hunt. No one got burned. Everyone who's ever bought a game from Jersey Jack Pimbal has

[22:14] received their game. Same with Stern, same with spooky, same with Chicago gaming. Well, except for

[22:19] all the people waiting for Monster Bash, you know what I'm saying? It's like you should feel good

[22:24] about going in on these games. I mean, I have people saying that I hope like the ship crashes or

[22:31] the playing crashes that's carrying these Lebowski's to their final destinations and there's a lot of

[22:39] like really anger and vitriol and ill will being wished upon the people that bought those ARA games.

[22:47] I knew that would happen and I honestly like I really don't care. I had a chance to buy a game,

[22:53] I bought a game. I had a chance to buy a game I always wanted. I bought a game and my and my

[22:58] upset that people got burned. Do I feel bad for those people? Absolutely, but there's nothing I could

[23:02] do to change that. There's nothing I could do. You could say, well, you don't buy the game then

[23:07] and take a moral stance. And I'm sorry, but like it's still just a toy and it's I get it, but

[23:14] we're all a little bit selfish in the pinball collecting community. And people who see people who

[23:20] say they're not, it's such a hypocritical people would fight hand over fist to get these Lebowski's

[23:25] if they could. If you put them on eBay, would that have solved it? So they're all going for $20,000

[23:29] plus, then every rich guy just get one gets one. I don't know. I don't think it was never going to

[23:33] work out in a way that would make people happy. All right. So now you know, now you know where I'm at.

[23:40] I've also really struggled over two things. I've really struggled with Willy Wonka. I still like

[23:47] really want Willy Wonka to be the game. I thought it would be. I still love the way the game looks.

[23:53] I love the theme. I love the way the game shoots. It really, it really makes me feel bad that I went

[24:01] over there and I hyped this game to you guys and I got really excited and I was like blown away

[24:07] on my initial impressions of the game. And it sucks. It sucks that like I just emotionally can't get

[24:15] back on the Wonka wagon. And you know, it sucks when I hear like the call outs and I'm like, why? Why are

[24:22] we? Why are we? Why are we struggling to put good call outs into a game in 2019? Like why do pat

[24:29] lullers two games have the shittiest call outs? Sorry to curse. Why do they have the worst call outs

[24:35] in these games? And like nobody's nobody's like changing it. Nobody's screaming about it. Nobody's

[24:42] demanding. It's better. And it's just it's just you know, something about Joe Katz saying it is what

[24:48] it is. What you see is what you get. It's just sort of like, I don't know. I just had the biggest

[24:54] turn off moment with the game when he said that. And I think they should be working hard to make the

[24:59] game better. Hold on. Bubba's barking. I'm going to walk over. I'm not even going to stop this podcast

[25:04] because Bubba's it's his dinner time. Let me pause it right now. And I'm going to come back after

[25:10] I feed Bubba. Hold on ladies and gentlemen. All right. The big boy is eating right now. He thinks

[25:15] all of you for letting his daddy pause the show. Now where was I? I don't even really remember. You

[25:21] know, look, you know, I think that Willie Wonka was hard one for me. I still wanted to have the

[25:28] machine. I said to you, my listeners, that you're going to you're going to see a Willie Wonka in this

[25:32] apartment. And the call out the lack of mode progression in the game. It just all started to fall

[25:40] apart from me. And then we get Jurassic Park from Stern Pimball, a game with no drama, a game with

[25:47] a designer that I think is the best designer in Pimball right now, a game that yeah, while it's not

[25:54] based on the movie we all love went in a direction that looks freaking awesome. I'm hearing from

[25:59] Pimberg people love the game. It shoots like a dream. It's a dream theme for a lot of people.

[26:05] And it's a mode based game going through Jurassic Park. I can tell you right now the game that I

[26:11] would rather own right now would be Jurassic Park just because of the way they brought the game to

[26:17] life. And I don't understand when you when you don't make a game mode based and you don't make it

[26:23] feel like a journey, people feel lost. They just feel like they're randomly doing stuff to get

[26:28] to higher scores in the game. I just think it's the dumbest thing to do with a property that people

[26:35] love. And again, you know my thoughts on all of this. But here's the good news. Both of these games

[26:40] are are are ones out right now. One's about to come out right now. But all these people who love

[26:46] Pimball are down in Pimberg enjoying both of these games. I mean, I love that. That is what this

[26:53] hobby should be about. And I've always said it. If I always said it, you know, and when I listen to

[26:58] like Jonathan, juicin talk about Barry and Dutch Pimball, I want it Dutch Pimball to go away. I want

[27:05] it highway Pimball to go away because I want the companies that have done nothing but create

[27:11] pain and agony to leave this industry. They they've done nothing nothing but cause anguish more than,

[27:20] you know, ecstasy. Their games were great. People love Alien and they love Lebowski. It's nothing

[27:26] about the product. It's just the companies themselves did nothing but sink a lot of people's

[27:33] enjoyment in the hobby. I mean, there are people that leave this hobby because they lost money on

[27:38] those games. They never want to see another Pimball machine again. And you know, I think Pimball will

[27:44] be much better off when the only people in the game are actually in the game. And they actually

[27:50] know how to run a business and they actually know how to deliver products to people. Sell you a

[27:55] product that is in a box. You're not investing in these companies. You're buying a product. Okay.

[28:02] You know, and it's like Dutch Pimball like restarting again. I don't think it's ever going to happen.

[28:09] Okay. Now that's just where I'm out with it all. And this has been episode 277 of Pimball podcast.

[28:17] I just wanted to put everything on the table for you of where I'm at and let you make up your mind

[28:23] about me, about who I am, about the kind of person I am. And I'm very transparent. I will happily

[28:30] have a conversation with any of you. All right. Any of you, if you're disgusted by this revelation,

[28:37] email me at canadapimballadjimout.com. Come on the show. Come on the show. I am not hiding, but I'm

[28:44] also not going to do this. There's a lot of new Pimball personalities out there that want to just

[28:48] jump on the show and use this platform to become Pimball famous, which absolutely means nothing. And

[28:54] I'm not here to do that either. But if you're just a fan and you just want to vocalize, I'd happily

[28:59] have you on the show. All right. Everybody. I love doing this show. I love the things we talk about

[29:06] on this podcast. I am always a work in progress. And sometimes I do things that are smart. Sometimes

[29:15] I do things that are stupid. Sometimes I do things that I don't even need to do. But I still just

[29:21] want to see the best Pimball come out into the world. And I love talking about it and giving you my

[29:28] opinion about all the different things that are occurring in the Pimball hobby. All right. So I thank

[29:34] you for listening. I wouldn't do this if I didn't see all of you tune in to every episode every

[29:42] week. It's awesome. It really is awesome. So that's the latest. Hey. And if you want a big

[29:48] Lebowski or a pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition, hit me up at can you to Pimball at gmo.com.

[29:53] All right. Everyone. We'll talk to you soon. I'm trying to think what the next news will be.

[29:58] I'm not sure, right? I think a lot of it's going to be reactions to Jurassic Park. So I look forward

[30:03] to seeing what people think about that game coming out of Pimburg. Have a great day everybody.
