[00:00] You know, there's 365 days in a year, but there are only about 5 or 6 of those days in

[00:24] which we get to wake up to a brand new Pimball machine in the world and today was one of those days.

[00:30] We finally got to see Steve Richie's Led Zeppelin Pimball Machine. Let's talk about this game on

[00:38] episode 541 of Canadian Pimball Podcast. I have to give Stern credit. They kept this game under

[00:45] wraps very well. There were no leaks. We were not seeing this game a few days early. Everything was

[00:51] launched exactly when they planned it to. Now everybody knew it was Led Zeppelin and Steve Richie.

[00:56] That was not a secret. So that cat was out of the bag a very long time ago. So what do we think

[01:03] of Stern Pimball's Led Zeppelin? How does it compare to Jersey Jack Pimball's guns and roses? You

[01:09] know, it's kind of incredible that these two companies are right down the block from each other.

[01:14] And this is what each of their interpretations are of some of the greatest rock and roll acts

[01:20] of all time. And we can't not compare these two games on some level. Now here's what I want to do

[01:25] because this is just my first impression of this game. I haven't shot it. Nobody has. I haven't

[01:31] seen what the code is. Nobody has. I haven't heard the call outs. I haven't seen much of the animations.

[01:37] What we are going to talk about right now is just my first impression of this game based on the

[01:44] materials all of us have at the same time. Okay. And we're going to go through it in the good,

[01:49] the bad, and the ugly. And yes, there is some ugliness to be discussed with this pin. Okay. Let's

[01:56] start with what I like about Led Zeppelin. Well, first we have to start with the fact that it's

[02:01] Led Zeppelin Pimball. So on a theme alone, this is an incredible theme for Pimball. This band has so

[02:07] many fans around the world. And the fact that you get to play a Pimball machine with Led Zeppelin

[02:13] songs blasting out of the speakers, I mean, sometimes I think people are forgetting that that is

[02:18] going to be something that is highly rewarding and highly satisfying to the majority of people who

[02:24] jump on this machine. They're not going to get hung up on the cabinet artwork. They're not going

[02:29] to get hung up on this and that they are simply going to hit the start button and hear some of their

[02:35] favorite Led Zeppelin songs and flip a Pimball machine on a very macro level. If you just do that,

[02:42] you are going to hook the majority of people and give them something to enjoy with this Pimball

[02:47] game. So this is a killer theme. And I think it's going to sell very well just on that fact alone.

[02:54] Even though I haven't seen the game in action, I'm reading what the code and the structure of the

[02:58] game is. There are 10 songs in the game. Now look, that's far short of Guns and Roses' 21 songs.

[03:05] But what are you going to do? What are you going to do? These are full songs. So that is good news.

[03:09] And there's 10 of them. And so the way the game works is you select your song at the beginning

[03:14] of each ball. And then each song is a progressive building of that song. Now I want to remind people

[03:21] on Canadian Pimball podcast like a year ago when we were talking about Guns and Roses, what did I

[03:27] say? I said it would be really cool if when you start a song, you progressively build that song

[03:33] and layer the song. So you have the chorus being separate from the drums. And you have you

[03:38] basically add the elements of the song to make the song a complete song. And I think that's what

[03:44] they're doing here in Led Zeppelin Pimball. Now did they steal that idea from Canada? Because I said

[03:51] that that would be amazing and I can go back and I can play for you the podcast in which remember

[03:56] it started out with the welcome to the jungle drums. And then it started in with Axel's vocals.

[04:01] And then we added the bass line. So I think that's how this game is going to be. You are going to

[04:07] build each song and add the elements to each track. Now that is really cool. And I can't wait to see

[04:14] how that comes to life in this game. Because I also think, you know, just playing the entire song

[04:19] from beginning to end really doesn't make much sense and would get boring unless you did it the way

[04:25] G&R does it, which is inviting you into the actual concert itself. And then the game itself is

[04:32] supposed to be about like being at the rock and roll concert. See this is not that. This is a

[04:36] different approach. And I do applaud them for finding a unique way to bring a music pin to life.

[04:43] What else do I like about Led Zeppelin? So here's something that I sort of like, but I'm also a

[04:47] little underwhelmed by at the same time. I do like that it has a big mechanism in the middle of the

[04:53] game that rises up from the bottom of the play field. Because I think all Pimball machines should have

[05:00] something that mechanically moves and does something. And it just feels like the game is coming to life.

[05:06] And I think if I look at Guns and Roses, it doesn't really have that. So I do love that this thing

[05:11] has the electric magic device. It rises up and then there's a spinner and there's also a magnet

[05:17] that grabs the ball. Now I will say this when that thing rises up, it is really sort of underwhelming

[05:23] that the only thing there is a spinner, which is like the blimp. And then it I get that it traps the

[05:29] ball. But I just the look of it just doesn't feel intuitive to Led Zeppelin. You see what I mean?

[05:36] I do think that this is where Stern males in a little bit that these devices and these mechs,

[05:42] they should be derivative of the theme itself. So what about Led Zeppelin is here. Like I just don't

[05:49] get anything coming from this mechanism being reflective of Led Zeppelin. To me, this feels like

[05:56] Steve Richie designed this mechanism and you could drop this mech into pretty much any Pimball

[06:01] machine out there. And I feel like that's always Stern's approach where they make stuff, but it's

[06:08] not made for the theme. It's just made to do something in the Pimball world. And then they just

[06:14] throw it onto a game regardless of the theme. And I felt the same way about the Hyperdrive in

[06:21] Star Wars. Like you could stick this thing into any game and just change the sticker on the spinner.

[06:27] And it would work. And then it just becomes like a unique way to trap the ball and do something

[06:31] else and hit something. But it's not really a bash toy. But I do like that it has this thing.

[06:36] Because I do think every game should have a major mech that moves and does something visually

[06:41] interesting. Okay. Now look, if you're going to have something rise up and lift in a Led Zeppelin

[06:47] Pimball machine, why wouldn't it be the Zeppelin blimp? Like that's the part that kills me. It's

[06:53] like Stern. You've got a theme that is called Led Zeppelin. And the whole thing is a hot air balloon.

[06:59] And you're telling me you're going to have something lift up mechanically on the game. And you're

[07:04] not going to make it the blimp. That's what a blimp does. It lifts up. So I did feel like it was a

[07:09] missed opportunity to have the blimp be the thing that rises up on the play field. What else do I

[07:15] like about Led Zeppelin? So I do think the layout. It's a fan layout for the most part. I do think

[07:21] this game is going to shoot really fast. And I think it's going to be a great shooting pin. Now

[07:25] when it comes to Steve Richie games, you know, and I know his games are going to shoot fast. They're

[07:31] going to have flow. They're going to have combos. And this thing does look like when that ball drops

[07:37] in, the ball is going to be flying around this game. So this is a pro in a calm though too. It does

[07:42] look like the ball is going to whip around this game. But it also looks really, really empty. Like the

[07:47] entire center of this play field is absolutely empty. I'm looking at it right now. And it almost

[07:54] looks like P3 multi morphec game. And the reason why I'm saying that, you know how Jerry's got the

[07:59] entire screen takes up the lower half of the play field. That's what Led Zeppelin looks like to me.

[08:04] There's absolutely nothing in the bottom two thirds of the game. It's completely barren. So there's

[08:10] nothing to slow down the pace of the ball. So some people might like that. Some people might like

[08:15] there to be more stuff coming down the play field or more stuff for the ball to interact with.

[08:20] But this is a wide open fast play field. Okay, if there ever was one. So I do like the fact that it's

[08:26] got three flippers. I think that makes the game a lot more fun and gives you more shot options in

[08:31] the game. The artwork we're going to talk about. We're going to talk about the artwork in this game.

[08:35] Look, it's got this like 70s psychedelic look to it. I like the colorfulness of the play field and

[08:42] the inner art blades. And I think that does pop and scream Led Zeppelin. You know, you're not

[08:47] going to walk over this thing and mistake it for anything else. We're going to talk about the

[08:51] artwork though as also being one of the major major cons for me in this game. I do like that

[08:57] Stern is trying a new lighting system in the game. They're calling it the expression lighting

[09:02] system. It's 96 intelligent RGB LEDs that enable full color spectrum control. And those go up the

[09:11] side of the game on each side. Now here's the thing. If we didn't see the hot rails from Jersey

[09:16] Jack Pimball in Guns and Roses, this new lighting system in the Stern game would be welcomed and

[09:21] might even be appreciated. But after seeing the hot rail system that GNR has brought to Pimball,

[09:28] this looks really pedestrian. It looks really outdated already. And it doesn't even look good. And

[09:35] then here's what I want to say about this. The reason why I say it doesn't look good. It's not that

[09:38] the lighting isn't going to be a cool effect. But the way these LEDs are cut into the side art

[09:45] on the inner art blades looks really bad to me. It looks like the windows to an airplane. Like,

[09:51] does like look at this. It looks like an airplane fuselage now is running up the side of your game.

[09:56] And this is where I have an issue because I feel like when Stern does stuff and they step back and

[10:03] look at it, they're designing stuff to a cost. They're not designing stuff to make it look as good as

[10:10] it can. And I feel like that's the difference between Jersey Jack right now in Stern Pimball.

[10:15] Is Stern Pimball always feels like they sort of stop halfway and just say, okay, it's good enough.

[10:22] It's good enough. But the problem is now that we see the potential and how you can actually get

[10:28] more innovative and do things differently, this to me just doesn't feel good enough anymore.

[10:33] And I don't want to see this kind of lighting system on every single Stern game moving forward.

[10:37] Because again, I just don't think it looks great. And I do think they need to start looking at

[10:42] these machines and finding new ways to put stuff in them. But that also looks aesthetically pleasing.

[10:49] And I wonder if this was always part of the design. I am curious how much of guns and roses

[10:55] impact it. Some of the design decisions on Led Zeppelin because we're seeing a lot of similar

[11:00] attempts to bring new stuff to a rock and roll pin. And just everything is executed better on

[11:07] GNR when it comes to the lighting in the game. When it comes to obviously how many lights are in the

[11:12] game. I mean, GNR has 351 I think something crazy like that individually controlled RGB LEDs.

[11:19] Like we're not even close. It's got twice as many songs. It's kind of reaching a point now where

[11:24] each company is showing us the best they got. And the best that JJP has just feels next level.

[11:31] I think that's the best way to think about it just feels next level. Let's talk about some other

[11:34] stuff. So so things I don't like about the machine. And again, I have not seen this machine flip

[11:40] yet. I haven't seen what the code is. I haven't seen what the call outs are. But here are just some

[11:45] things on a very sort of like top down viewpoint of this game. How did I feel about when I saw

[11:51] this game for the first time? And like the rest of you out there, I just have to start and rip the

[11:55] bandaid off right now. I think the pro and premium versions of this game are some of the ugliest

[12:03] art packages I think I've seen in Pimball. And mainly because of the color palette. And it doesn't

[12:08] even get better with the elderly version of the game. And let me talk about why. I get that these are

[12:13] the album covers of Led Zeppelin. I get that. But that doesn't mean that something that was made

[12:20] 40 something years ago, something that was made 40 something years ago that was put on a vinyl

[12:25] record cover, right? A square vinyl record that doesn't mean that that will look good or translate

[12:32] good into a Pimball machines art package. And when I saw this pro model for the first time, it looked

[12:39] like a loaf of wonder bread. It did. It looked and look, I get that this is Led Zeppelin's artwork.

[12:46] But it doesn't make the art good. It doesn't make it appealing. Now if you're a fan of Led Zeppelin,

[12:51] you might not mind this and I understand that. But man, I really feel like they should have creatively

[12:57] asked the band to go in a different direction on these art packages because they just don't look good.

[13:05] A predominantly white Pimball cabinet and translate doesn't look good. It looks like the bug's

[13:11] bunny game that came out. I mean, why would you make this kick ass rock band? Why would you make

[13:17] their Pimball machine look like this? And there's no way around it. I just was like, I almost like

[13:23] spit my coffee out being like, I can't believe this is the art package. It just reminded me once again,

[13:29] here we go. What did we say? The one thing that Steve Richie Pimball machines always suffer from.

[13:35] Art. It's like the art is always the last thing they do on a Steve Richie Pim and doesn't

[13:40] just feel like the art package was mailed in and maybe you're saying, well, maybe they had

[13:45] restrictions from the license holder. I just don't buy that. I think they should have pushed them

[13:48] to do something different. And then you get to the lazy part where you have the same exact art

[13:53] on the side of the cabinet that's on the translate. Really? That's all you can do. You can't make it

[13:59] look any different. I mean, I'm looking at the premium right now and you basically have this humongous

[14:04] orange lead Zeppelin. It's you see it one, two, three, four. Like how many it's everywhere? It's the

[14:10] same image. It's the same image on the front by the coin box. It's the same image on the left and

[14:15] right side. And it's the same image on the translate. And it's on the side decals that are on the

[14:20] back box. This is repetitive. It's boring and it's uninspired. I think that's the best word I can

[14:27] use. When I saw these art packages, they felt so uninspired. Like there's just no creativity going

[14:34] on here, especially when we just saw what Zambi Eddie can do with Iron Maiden. We saw what he could do

[14:40] with Avengers. And we're seeing incredible art packages across the board from guns and roses.

[14:46] And then you get to this. And it feels like a major step backwards when this is the art package of a

[14:53] pinball machine in 2020. Now let's get to the Ellie because I think when people saw the first two

[14:58] models, they're like, well, the Ellie will save the day. I do think the Ellie looks the nicest,

[15:03] but man, you're going to get a divided camp on whether or not this bright blue armor is working

[15:10] for people. Now when I look at it and step back, it does look like a Zeppelin T-shirt from the 70s.

[15:16] It does pop lead Zeppelin. You could use this armor if you ever make a Smurfs pinball machine. So

[15:21] maybe Smurfs is coming out sometime in 2021. But do I like this? Do I like this art? You know,

[15:27] again, it just all feels sort of lazy. Even with the same image across the entire machine, I just feel like

[15:35] it feels mailed in. And I would have liked them to do a little bit more, a little bit more. Like

[15:41] even on the side of the back box, there's nothing there. There's nothing there, but they just carried

[15:46] over the color gradient. But that's it. That's it. So I think on some level, on an aesthetic level,

[15:53] this is probably one of the most visually disappointing Stern art packages of all time. And I

[15:59] mean that because it just feels lazy. And maybe you can blame Led Zeppelin because it was there

[16:04] art to begin with. But again, I just think Stern needs to do a better job of steering these

[16:10] machines to look better than this. I think Stern has so many years of experience on how to make a

[16:15] cabinet look as great as it can. And this just isn't it. This just isn't it. And this is 100%

[16:22] subjective. So this is just my opinion about these art packages. I think all three of them are a

[16:29] little bit of a swing and a miss. I do think the Ellie looks the nicest, but none of these really

[16:35] pop and make me get excited. And art is something that should universally excite. It should.

[16:41] You know, and then we get to the artwork on the play field itself. I like the 70s psychedelic stuff.

[16:48] I like the blimp in the middle. You know, I'm on the fence about the band members in the circles

[16:53] like this. They look kind of grainy again. 70s artwork. Look to it. It's not, you know, it's not

[16:59] amazing. It's not terrible. But here's the part two where I just think Stern once again had a

[17:03] ton of restrictions. So one of the parts on a pinball machine that you can apply art and make it

[17:08] interesting are the plastics and look at the plastics on Led Zeppelin by the slingshots.

[17:13] Absolutely no art there. Just the color gradient. And this again just makes me feel like

[17:19] they didn't go over every single element of this game and give it as much detail as they could have.

[17:26] And this is where I just always feel like Stern goes 75% of the way there. Look at the slingshot

[17:32] plastics on guns and roses and compare them to this. Look at the slingshot plastics on Avengers

[17:37] or Ninja Turtles. So how did we go from that to this? And I think some of the answer is that

[17:43] this game wasn't illustrated. This is assets that were given to them by the band and they are

[17:49] arranged this way. So that's also why I think you're seeing a lack of detail in the artwork

[17:55] in this game. But look if you're a fan of Led Zeppelin, it's all here. This looks like a Led

[18:01] Zeppelin pin. It has the visual cues of the band you love. And I think when you do stand over

[18:07] this machine, it's going to look pretty decent. It's not going to blow you away, but it's going to

[18:13] look decent. But once again I can't help but feel like Steve Richie pins. They always come up

[18:18] really short in the art department. And I've said it from the very beginning. I just don't know if

[18:22] he really puts an emphasis on the art. I think he's so focused on the shots. And look for you pinball

[18:29] players out there. That's great. But why can't we have it all? Why can't we have it all for 9200 bucks?

[18:35] And look and I think like one of the big differences in these two pinball machines when you compare

[18:39] guns and roses to Led Zeppelin is who is behind both of these creations. On guns and roses pinball

[18:44] machine, you have a signature from slash, axle, and duff. On Led Zeppelin, you have a signature from

[18:51] Steve Richie. And I think that's the big difference. I think that's the big difference is that

[18:54] Stern licensed this game from Led Zeppelin. And I think they probably did the best they could

[19:00] with all the restrictions they had and what they had to work with. This was not made with Led Zeppelin.

[19:06] Guns and roses was made with slash and the band itself. So that is why you're just going to have a

[19:12] humongous difference in how these games come to life. And when we get to call out and we get to

[19:18] other stuff, I'm really curious to see what is in Led Zeppelin because they don't have nearly,

[19:25] nearly the stuff to pull from that G and R did. Like G and R had like something like 38

[19:30] concerts with three hours of footage to grab stuff for the animations and for the big screen in

[19:36] the back of the game. What is Led Zeppelin have? All right. So we're going to see all that. We don't

[19:40] know yet. Overall, I just want to say this. Overall, I think people came to this reveal with a lot

[19:46] of expectations. I think there's always a little bit of anxiety when you see a new Stern game. We

[19:51] don't know how this machine shoots yet, which is a very important part of a pinball launch. Okay.

[19:57] But I just think from an aesthetic standpoint, this is somewhat of a very disappointing visual

[20:02] game for Stern Pimball. We know they can do better and I just don't think this game makes it

[20:08] visually pop. Will it play well? That's yet to be determined. Will the code be rewarding? That's

[20:14] yet to be determined. I do like the way they're coding this game. And if they can build each song with

[20:19] progression, I think that's going to be a lot of fun. I also thought it was kind of funny that the

[20:24] songs are listed in the back of the game the way they are. Like to me again, it just feels a little

[20:29] lazy. Like, it's like they're expecting someone to walk up and be like, okay, hear the 10 songs. Oh,

[20:34] I like that song. Okay. Let me play this game. I just different ways they could have brought some

[20:38] of this stuff to life. Let me close out by saying that all of us need to make up our own mind on this

[20:43] game. If you're a diehard Led Zeppelin fan, I think you're going to buy this regardless because

[20:48] you're going to be able to jump on a pinball machine and hear some of the music from your favorite

[20:53] band. And if you love pinball and you love Led Zeppelin, I don't see how you could stay away from

[20:58] this machine. But if you're not the biggest Led Zeppelin fan, I do think you're going to look at

[21:03] this machine and probably enjoy it when you play it on location. You'll probably enjoy it at one of

[21:09] your friends' houses. But I don't think there's enough here to say I'm going to go grab one of these.

[21:15] Will the Ellie's sell out? I was talking a lot about that. There's only 500 Ellie's of Led Zeppelin.

[21:22] I just think on theme alone, yes, this Ellie is going to sell out. But I also don't think this

[21:27] is going to go down as one of those pins that people just have to have because I just don't think it

[21:32] checks enough of the boxes for people like other pins in Stern's repertoire. And I also, I mean this,

[21:39] I think following guns and roses, the bar has been lifted so high that G and R CE is an absolute

[21:47] masterpiece. And I just don't think you can look at Led Zeppelin Ellie and be like, that's a masterpiece.

[21:53] This is the kind of game that's going to hold value for a long time. And this game is doing something

[21:57] completely innovative and never been done before in Pimball. I just don't think it's raising the bar

[22:03] on any level that feels significant. And I think guns and roses did. Now, all of you have to make

[22:08] up your own minds, jump on these machines, buy what you enjoy. The good news is if you love either

[22:14] band, you've got an option right now. If you love Alien the movie, you're going to have an

[22:18] option on Friday. If you love zombies and an amusement park that has aliens coming after them,

[22:24] you've got Rosy to go by. Right? So there's a lot of good options for us right now. Now's the point

[22:29] where we go to Pinside and we watch people tear each others heads off around this game. This is

[22:35] when it's fun. Get the popcorn out because the Stern apologists are going to defend this title.

[22:40] We know who they are. They're going to come out. Chuck Warts already there. He's doing it already.

[22:44] They're going to defend this title to no end. Iceman is going to say how it's going to be the

[22:48] greatest game ever already. He already ordered an Ellie. And then you're going to get people who are

[22:51] just going to slam it saying it's the worst looking Pimball machine ever and it's terrible. It's neither

[22:56] one of those. It's neither one of those. I think this game is going to fall somewhere in the middle.

[23:01] But I will say this. This doesn't feel like the mic drop redemption pin that I thought Steve

[23:06] Richie was going to make and I do think Eric Minier and Keith Lwynn. Those are the two guys now.

[23:11] They're the two Kings. The two Kings in Pimball are Eric Minier and Keith Lwynn. This is a good

[23:17] attempt but nothing fully revolutionary going on here everybody. This has been episode 541. Let me

[23:24] know what you think about Led Zeppelin. Email me at canadapimballatgemo.com. Always happy to hang out with

[23:31] you guys in real time and talk about these things as they happen. I hope you appreciate this. When

[23:35] you go to vote in the twippies that the one podcast that's always on the air right when stuff

[23:41] happens is canada's pinball podcast. Talk to you guys soon.
