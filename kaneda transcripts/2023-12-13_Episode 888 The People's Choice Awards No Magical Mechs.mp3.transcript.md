[00:00] Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night where the children of tomorrow dream awake in the wind of change.

[03:17] I think people are gonna do that I don't because what's fun about Facebook voting is you get to see who voted for what it's not

[03:24] Anonymous which I also like like what better way to verify it than doing something like that

[03:29] And yes, if you want to go through all the effort to make a fake Facebook profile to put a vote in this People's Choice Awards for Pimball

[03:38] That's on you and I think we're gonna get to a result with this People's Choice Awards

[03:44] that's gonna mirror exactly what people will find out

[03:48] like three and a half months from now

[03:50] when the Twippies finally goes to Texas

[03:52] and by the time we recognize those games,

[03:55] nobody's gonna care about those games

[03:57] because games like Foo Fighters,

[03:59] which I think might win Game of the Year,

[04:01] will have been out for over a freaking year

[04:04] and everyone's gonna have moved on to the latest games

[04:07] like Jaws and other games that are coming out

[04:10] in the pinball space.

[04:11] Now here's the thing I'm gonna do

[04:13] a little bit differently.

[04:14] When it comes to the games that are available

[04:16] to vote on a lot of the categories,

[04:19] here's the very simple criteria.

[04:21] If your game took deposit money anytime in 2023,

[04:27] your game is eligible for a lot of the categories.

[04:30] So games like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Looney Tunes

[04:34] will be in some of these polls.

[04:37] If you took deposits and the games were revealed,

[04:40] I think games like that should be up for categories

[04:43] like even Game of the Year, it's not gonna win

[04:46] and it will be eligible next year

[04:48] if the game ships in the following year.

[04:50] But I think games like Looney Tunes

[04:52] and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Pulp Fiction,

[04:55] like games like that should be eligible for categories

[04:59] like artwork because the artwork is not gonna change.

[05:02] The toppers are not gonna change.

[05:05] The mechs in the game are not gonna change.

[05:07] So and as you're gonna see on this episode

[05:09] of Canada's Pinball Podcasts,

[05:12] I think some of these games might have a chance

[05:14] in winning best mechanism designed in 2023.

[05:18] And even if you haven't played the game,

[05:21] we can look down and see which of these mechanisms

[05:23] are creative, are innovative,

[05:26] and actually create a magical moment in pinball.

[05:29] You know, cause I think it's so silly

[05:31] that Pulp Fiction topper would not be eligible

[05:34] simply because it didn't ship,

[05:36] but the topper's not gonna change

[05:38] and nobody is questioning whether or not

[05:40] CGC will actually make these games.

[05:42] So it's gonna be fun, it's gonna be low lift,

[05:46] and after we do all the polling

[05:47] and the polls close next Friday,

[05:50] we're gonna do a fun show, Jengus and I,

[05:52] talking about the results

[05:54] of the Pinball's People's Choice Awards.

[05:57] Ah, the only thing I'm debating about right now

[05:59] is whether or not I recuse myself

[06:02] from favorite pinball podcast

[06:04] or in favorite pinball streamer.

[06:05] I don't want people to feel like I'm biased.

[06:08] I know the polling is happening on my page,

[06:10] but I can't control any of it, right?

[06:12] It is all public polling.

[06:14] I get one vote for myself

[06:17] and the rest of it is up to everybody else.

[06:19] And we have about 3,200 people on Canada's Facebook page.

[06:23] Obviously they're not all currently active,

[06:25] but I do think when you look at the Twippy voting,

[06:28] they get a few thousand votes.

[06:29] I think we can get around a thousand people

[06:32] to participate in this poll

[06:35] and I think it's gonna be fun

[06:36] and I think it's a great way to put a cherry on top

[06:39] of the things that happened in pinball in 2023

[06:42] and we're gonna do it in 2023.

[06:44] The only favor I ask of all of you

[06:47] is if you could share and spread the word

[06:49] about this voting and this polling,

[06:51] I think it's gonna be fun,

[06:52] because I'm banned from places like pinball and enthusiasts.

[06:55] Let's see who has the courage

[06:57] to share this People's Choice Awards with that site.

[07:01] And again, this is not about me.

[07:03] This is about allowing everybody on Facebook

[07:06] to simply vote about what they loved in pinball.

[07:09] Let's have some fun.

[07:11] Let's end the year on a positive note.

[07:13] Let's jump into one of these categories right now

[07:16] and I want this to be the focus of this podcast.

[07:19] Now, if you listen to Canada's Pinball podcast,

[07:21] what do people always say about me?

[07:22] He's always complaining about prices.

[07:25] He's complaining there's not enough magic in these games.

[07:28] He's complaining that these companies

[07:30] aren't really throwing the creativity

[07:33] they should at these games.

[07:35] He's complaining that Bally Williams,

[07:37] like 35 years ago,

[07:39] put way more mechanical magic into the games

[07:42] and now we're spending so much money.

[07:45] The most pinball has ever been in 2023.

[07:49] And surely, if pinball is the most money it's ever been,

[07:53] we should be able to look down at these games

[07:55] and point out mechanical, magical, wow things

[08:00] that these companies created

[08:02] to make these pinball experiences incredible,

[08:05] unforgettable, memorable, and worth the freaking money.

[08:09] All right, so ladies and gentlemen,

[08:11] here's the funny part.

[08:11] If I were to ask you, close your eyes.

[08:13] Everybody close your eyes, do me a favor,

[08:15] but do not close your eyes

[08:17] if you are driving a car right now,

[08:19] but if you're in a safe place, close your eyes.

[08:23] And let me ask you one simple question.

[08:26] What was the most magical mechanism in pinball

[08:31] in 2023?

[08:33] What was the mechanism that when it activated,

[08:36] when it interacted with the ball,

[08:39] what was the mechanism that when you saw it operate

[08:42] for the first time, you said to yourself,

[08:44] wow, what a magical mech.

[08:47] After all these years of pinball engineering,

[08:50] I'm still amazed at what creativity comes through

[08:55] in this hobby.

[08:56] Did anything come to mind?

[08:59] Did anything happen this year?

[09:01] That was cooler than a Balli Williams mechanism

[09:04] from the mid-90s.

[09:06] Did you see anything like the thing in Adam's family

[09:09] grabbing the ball or shooting star out lane post saves

[09:13] like Toten or theater of magic, magic box

[09:16] that spins around and does like 18 different things?

[09:20] Did you see anything like a disappearing magnet

[09:22] in front of the genie in Toten?

[09:24] Did you see anything like the T-Rex head in Jurassic Park

[09:27] that picks up the ball and flings it around?

[09:30] Did you see anything like slimer that swoops down

[09:33] and you get to bash him?

[09:35] Think about it, an entire year of pinball machines.

[09:38] And I'm gonna read the games for you right now,

[09:41] an entire year of pinball machines

[09:43] in which pinball is the most expensive it's ever been.

[09:46] It's a physical game under glass.

[09:49] And I ask you, what's the most magical mech

[09:52] out of the following games?

[09:54] James Bond 60th, Foo Fighters, Venom, Godfather,

[10:01] Elton John, Galactic Tank Force, Pulp Fiction,

[10:06] Labyrinth, Looney Tunes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Centaur.

[10:12] Now you could argue this is also, I would say,

[10:15] one of the weakest years and weakest lineups

[10:19] in pinball in a long time.

[10:21] We won't even go down that road, right?

[10:23] For this much money, these are the themes we're getting

[10:27] in pinball in 2023.

[10:30] Now some of them are cool, Pulp Fiction is like

[10:33] over the top cool, but some of them, mm, you know,

[10:37] Godfather, Elton John are these really the themes

[10:40] people want.

[10:42] When you're gonna charge this much money,

[10:44] where's Karate Kid, where's Top Gun, where's Matrix,

[10:48] where's Harry Potter, where's He-Man, where's G.I. Joe,

[10:52] where's the stuff that you know would take your money

[10:55] right now, all right, we're not talking about themes,

[10:57] Chris, stay on the point.

[10:58] The most magical mechs of the year.

[11:01] Now look, I tried to sort of identify these,

[11:04] and maybe I'm missing a few, but let me read you.

[11:07] The ones that I think are sort of like, all right,

[11:10] like if you're gonna look at each of these games

[11:12] and point out the magical mech, the thing that does

[11:15] something that makes you say, wow, we've got the odd job hat

[11:20] in James Bond 60th, the Foo Fighter Alien,

[11:24] it has the post, it has the magnet inside

[11:27] that shakes the ball around, it locks the ball,

[11:30] and then you knock the ball out of that area,

[11:32] and then we've got something simple in Foo Fighters,

[11:34] the overdrive post, right, the dead save post that pops up

[11:39] and saves the ball and puts it back into play

[11:41] when it's about to drain.

[11:43] One of the most simple things in all of Thinball,

[11:47] but boy does it create a wow moment,

[11:49] and is this where we're at, right,

[11:51] just a single post that pops up,

[11:53] but it's put in a very, very creative space.

[11:56] Crazy, right, that maybe something as simple as this

[12:00] could be the most magical mechanism in all of Thinball

[12:03] in the year in which Thinball was the most expensive

[12:05] it's ever been.

[12:06] Kinda gets back to my philosophy

[12:08] that maybe sometimes in life, less is more.

[12:12] One magical bite of a piece of uni is better than a cheese

[12:17] steak that's gonna make you feel horrible afterwards.

[12:20] All right, we go to Godfather.

[12:23] Man, this game, when you think about this game

[12:25] and you're like, where are the magical mechs in Godfather?

[12:28] You might as well fall over backwards and play dead

[12:30] because you're not gonna find any,

[12:31] but the one that we would have to call out

[12:33] is the gangster in the back up the center of the game.

[12:37] It's a spinning disc in there,

[12:38] and then you've got the gangster on top with his Tommy gun.

[12:42] Doesn't really do anything magical though.

[12:44] I've played this game a bunch,

[12:45] like that shot is not that satisfying,

[12:48] it's not that rewarding,

[12:49] and maybe you could argue that it's the Tommy gun

[12:52] going with the knockers on the topper

[12:54] and the sound of like the machine gun.

[12:56] Magical mech, I don't know.

[12:59] Recently released the Elton John piano that locks the balls.

[13:03] It's got all those LED lights on it.

[13:06] It's got little Elton John playing the piano,

[13:09] and I played this game a lot when I went to automate it,

[13:12] and while that piano is cool,

[13:15] here's where I think this piano mechanism

[13:17] like missed the mark because it's always just going,

[13:20] and it doesn't interact with you the player,

[13:23] and here's where I think Jersey Jack missed

[13:25] a golden opportunity to make this mech

[13:27] more than just the mech it is, right?

[13:30] Which is just the ball lock and Elton just playing the songs.

[13:33] I get that his hands are mimicking the song that's playing,

[13:36] but there's no real interactivity

[13:38] between the player and that mech that's that satisfying.

[13:41] It's just kind of going on and you don't really notice it.

[13:44] Here's where they could have taken this mech

[13:46] to a supernal level.

[13:47] Imagine if there was a mode in this game

[13:49] that was just called make a request.

[13:52] This little animatronic Elton John

[13:54] sitting in front of the piano, his head turns to you,

[13:57] and they get the real Elton John to do a call out

[14:01] that says, hey, what song would you like to hear?

[14:04] And you actually speak out loud

[14:07] the next song you would like to hear,

[14:09] and then it's like a beautiful mode

[14:11] where he's playing that song just for you

[14:13] as if you requested it of Elton himself.

[14:17] And then you need to sync up like the song with that mode.

[14:20] It would be like a there and back again mode

[14:23] in the Lord of the Rings.

[14:24] It would be magical.

[14:26] You know, and also just making it so like you feel

[14:28] like that little Elton is talking to you

[14:30] the way Smaug talks to you in the Hobbit Pimball machine.

[14:34] And they didn't do anything like that.

[14:36] Like he's just moving back and forth,

[14:37] but they really should have made it seem like

[14:39] he's talking to you, kind of like those old toys

[14:42] when we were kids, like the game show host toy,

[14:45] where you really felt like that animatronic little toy

[14:48] was actually speaking to you.

[14:50] And I think they missed a golden opportunity to do that.

[14:53] So as it is right now with the LED lights and the ball lock,

[14:57] is it a magical mechanism?

[14:59] I don't know.

[15:00] Then we get to Pulp Fiction.

[15:01] You know, there's the hamburger,

[15:02] which is not really a mech.

[15:03] There's the pawn shop in Pulp Fiction,

[15:05] which is some drop targets.

[15:07] Nothing truly magical.

[15:09] I would argue the most magical mechanism in the game.

[15:12] It doesn't really interact with the ball,

[15:14] but it's the suitcase that turns around,

[15:17] opens up and has that shining golden light come out of it.

[15:21] And Jules is staring at it, right?

[15:23] And Jules, John Travolta's character,

[15:24] is right in front of it staring at it.

[15:26] You know, it's that iconic scene in the movie,

[15:28] like we good, we got it.

[15:30] But again, it doesn't really interact with the ball.

[15:33] It's an interesting thing,

[15:34] but is that the most magical mech of the year?

[15:37] And then we get to like the labyrinth.

[15:39] And I was thinking about the labyrinth.

[15:41] It's got some magnets, but for the most part,

[15:44] the mechanisms that really are designed

[15:46] to create the surprise and delight

[15:48] are all those hidden goblins that pop up.

[15:51] But those two don't interact with the ball.

[15:54] You know, they're meant to happen

[15:56] when certain things are going on with the code

[15:57] or the gameplay, but they don't get triggered

[16:00] by a kinetic ball thing.

[16:02] But when I watch someone playing the labyrinth,

[16:04] I'm not like, wow, look at that toy.

[16:07] All right, then we get to Galactic Tank Forest

[16:09] and we've got a cow that is hanging

[16:12] from a piece of string that moves back and forth.

[16:15] And we've got that tank in the middle of the game

[16:17] with those five targets in front of it

[16:20] and the 3D sculpted guy that comes out of the tank.

[16:23] None of it is, wow, we've heard all the feedback.

[16:26] It all looks really cheap.

[16:28] And for a company that spent three years

[16:30] working on this game, it's really disappointing,

[16:34] the mechanical magic that's not in this game.

[16:37] You know, then we get to Venom, right?

[16:38] The game that's just getting blasted by everybody.

[16:41] I mean, I feel like Venom, maybe location people like it,

[16:45] but for the most part, this game is just a falling knife

[16:49] in terms of value, but Venom actually has some mechs in it.

[16:53] I mean, I actually give Brian Eddy credit

[16:56] for putting some mechanical stuff in the game.

[16:59] It's got the carnage mech that's got the new Tim ball

[17:02] that keeps pushing carnage up the play field.

[17:05] Like that's pretty neat.

[17:06] Is it magical?

[17:07] Does it create a wow moment?

[17:09] I don't know about that.

[17:10] Probably the coolest mech in the game is the Venom 180 ramp.

[17:14] It's very functional.

[17:15] It's a ramp that can rotate three different ways.

[17:18] It like goes from opening up so the ball can go through it.

[17:21] It then can rotate down and become a target.

[17:24] It then can rotate down again

[17:26] and become like this horseshoe ramp

[17:28] that puts the ball into a wire form.

[17:31] At least they tried.

[17:32] There's some actual engineering going on with that

[17:34] and the ball interacts with it.

[17:36] And it's pretty cool because it changes throughout the game

[17:39] depending on the different Venoms and symbiotes you occupy.

[17:43] And then we've got that Venom doppelganger

[17:45] that swings out with the three targets hanging from them.

[17:49] A little clunky looking.

[17:50] You know, I always say it looks like Venom's Spider-Man's

[17:52] got three USB sticks hanging from his butt.

[17:55] Not really sure that creates a wow moment.

[17:58] And so that's pretty much it people.

[18:00] There's nothing else.

[18:02] Out of everything I just mentioned,

[18:04] I don't consider any of these to be like wow magical mechs

[18:08] or something really cool where like,

[18:10] wow, did you see the ball do that?

[18:13] Other than Jack Danger's overdrive post.

[18:16] And I fully mean that.

[18:17] Like that is the most wow thing in pinball

[18:21] when pinball's been the most expensive it's ever been.

[18:24] But then we got two new games to the mix.

[18:27] We just saw two new games from Spooky Pinball,

[18:30] a company I rag on for years

[18:33] for having no mechanical magic in their games,

[18:36] for having no toys in their games that do something cool,

[18:40] for not having that moment where you say,

[18:42] hey, did you see what the ball did just there?

[18:45] And look, I'm not saying Spooky Pinball

[18:47] just engineered something crazy like a Godzilla building

[18:51] or a T-Rex or a freaking Doctor Who

[18:54] or Ringmaster sort of mechanism,

[18:56] but they've got a few cool things happening in this game

[19:00] that I can't say I see in other people's machines.

[19:03] I mean, there are cooler mechanisms

[19:05] in freaking Spooky Pinball's games

[19:08] than are in Jersey Jack Pinball machines.

[19:10] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[19:11] The fact that Spooky Pinball is even in the same conversation

[19:15] as magical mechanisms as Jersey Jack Pinball

[19:19] just goes to show you the state

[19:22] of current pinball manufacturing.

[19:24] And their mechanisms, whether it's the meat grinder

[19:27] on the left side, which is super cool,

[19:29] but my favorite mech in all of these new games

[19:32] is the magnet in front of the drop target door.

[19:36] I mean, they kind of jacked that a little bit

[19:38] from the shadow, but who cares?

[19:40] I'd rather every single company

[19:42] steal some of the magic from Balli Williams' days

[19:45] and put it into these games and I'll give you credit.

[19:48] Because even if you can't design something

[19:49] from the ground up new,

[19:51] at least put something into a game

[19:53] that's freaking magical.

[19:54] Like a disappearing magnet will always be magical.

[19:58] So will Shooting Star Outlane protectors.

[20:01] I'm shocked that nobody has done something like Toad and Did

[20:04] with the Shooting Star Outlane savers.

[20:06] Nobody ever, since then, what, we're out of ideas?

[20:09] And so Spooky Pinball might have some

[20:11] of the most magical mechanisms in pinball in 2023.

[20:16] Now, I'm not sure if that's a celebration of Spooky

[20:19] or if it's an indictment of how sad

[20:22] the current state of pinball mechanical engineering is.

[20:26] And I think Jaws is gonna change that,

[20:28] but as I keep saying, we can't rely only on Keith Elwyn

[20:33] to do magical things in pinball

[20:35] if pinball prices are gonna be this high.

[20:38] And I think Jersey Jack should be a little bit ashamed

[20:41] that Elton John and Godfather are so damn empty.

[20:45] And I think Stern Pinball hasn't had anything really

[20:47] magical mechanically since Godzilla.

[20:51] So we're waiting again for Keith Elwyn.

[20:53] American Pinball had more mechanical magic in Houdini

[20:57] and Oktoberfest than it has in any of its games since then.

[21:02] Barrels of Fun is brand new to the game,

[21:04] so I'm gonna cut them some slack,

[21:06] but they need to get to the mechanical

[21:07] creativity drawing board.

[21:09] You're not gonna be able to make stuff like the fifth element

[21:12] and just use off-the-shelf parts.

[21:15] You're gonna have to start engineering some toys

[21:17] to really bring these themes to life.

[21:20] And this is why I'm excited for Dutch Pinball

[21:22] making Back to the Future,

[21:24] because when you look at the Big Lebowski,

[21:26] that company understands the importance

[21:29] of mechanically magical toys in a game.

[21:31] They brought a lot of it to the pinball world 10 years ago,

[21:35] and that's the other part that makes me like so confused.

[21:38] How could a company do it 10 years ago

[21:40] an entire decade has gone by?

[21:43] And we've got like 12 pinball companies now

[21:46] and nobody after an entire year of making games.

[21:51] Nobody when you close your eyes and you say,

[21:53] what was the most magical mech you saw last year?

[21:57] Nothing comes to mind.

[21:59] That's a problem, people.

[22:01] And look, this is not a negative podcast.

[22:03] You know, all these people that try to indict me

[22:05] for pointing this stuff out,

[22:07] we need to point this stuff out.

[22:09] We need to be saying to these companies,

[22:12] if you wanna charge us this money,

[22:14] then hire some more mechanical engineers.

[22:17] And you know what they've done instead?

[22:19] They hired software people.

[22:21] They've hired artists.

[22:23] They don't want to put mechanically complex wow toys

[22:27] into the games because it takes money,

[22:30] it takes effort, and the things might break down.

[22:34] So they took the cheap way out

[22:36] and just filled these games with artwork and animations

[22:40] and then charged us through the roof.

[22:43] It is the problem that we need to change in pinball.

[22:46] We need more mechanical wow.

[22:48] Everybody get ready for the pinballs people's choice awards.

[22:52] I don't have to tell you what my most magical mech was.

[22:55] I will vote on it when voting opens on Friday.

[22:59] Everybody have a great day.

[23:01] The wind of change is here.

[23:02] We are not gonna be spending this much money

[23:05] if the creative effort is not put into these games

[23:08] and if the themes are not themes we want.

[23:11] I mean, gosh, I didn't even go over

[23:13] like this can't be the best we come up with

[23:16] when pinball is the most expensive it's ever been.

[23:19] Thank you for the support.

[23:20] We'll talk to you later.

[23:21] Canada out.

[23:22] Take me to the magic of the moment

[23:28] on a glory night

[23:31] where the jerry tomorrow dream away

[23:37] in the wind of change.

[23:39] In the wind of change.

[24:02] When you look at it from up here,

[24:04] you get an appreciation of our world is a beautiful place

[24:07] and we do need to take care of it.
