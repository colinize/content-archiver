[00:05] It's the final countdown.

[00:14] The final countdown.

[00:21] Ah, welcome to Gnadis Pinball Podcast everybody.

[00:24] We are on the eve of Pinball Expo.

[00:26] What will happen?

[00:27] Will we see Elton John games on the line when they reveal the game?

[00:31] Will Canada show up to Pinball Expo?

[00:34] Will the Pinball Brothers, will they give this new Ellen Ripley code to the original

[00:39] highway owners?

[00:40] Are we going to see clips of Ripley in the game?

[00:43] And will Turner Pinball bring back the pinbar?

[00:46] And hey, are a bunch of grown men going to wake up and say, hey honey,

[00:50] a few months from now we're going to get a pinball machine with goblins in it from

[00:54] barrels of unicorns.

[00:55] What's going to happen in the pinball world?

[00:57] And look everybody, I'm so excited.

[00:59] You can see it's the eve of a major pinball show.

[01:02] It's like a few times a year all these manufacturers decide to make the biggest

[01:06] marketing mistake and reveal all of their things on top of each other.

[01:10] Everyone's plans just colliding all at once.

[01:14] It's impossible to have hype for more than like two weeks.

[01:16] I mean, trust me when I say this, like three weeks from now,

[01:19] how are they going to maintain a hype for the labyrinth?

[01:22] How is that going to happen?

[01:23] It's not going to happen.

[01:24] And what I'm going to do on this episode is we're going to talk a lot about Elton John

[01:28] and if this game doesn't make the line right now when they reveal the game,

[01:32] I'm hearing the game is delayed.

[01:33] I want to talk about the significance of this.

[01:36] If this game is shown to the world tomorrow and those games are not ready to go out the door,

[01:42] huge, huge implications if that's the case.

[01:46] I'm going to give my predictions for this barrel of monkey game labyrinth.

[01:50] I know I keep making fun of the name and until they change it,

[01:52] I'm going to keep making fun of it.

[01:54] And then we're going to talk a little bit about what else is going to go on at the show.

[01:57] We've got this alien topper that not everybody can have.

[02:01] I'm not a fan of that move.

[02:03] And then we're just going to give a really big shout out to start this show

[02:07] to the new raise the roof members of canada's pinball podcast.

[02:11] And you know who you are.

[02:12] I want to give a huge, huge shout out to Mr. Justin Collins,

[02:17] who didn't just raise the roof.

[02:19] He also joined the omokase club and is donating $30 a month to the show.

[02:25] Justin, thank you so much.

[02:27] I want to thank Mr. Pete Rosen, who didn't just raise the roof.

[02:30] He smashed through it.

[02:32] Mr. Pete Rosen giving $50 a month to canada's pinball podcast.

[02:37] And I want to thank Darren W for raising the roof.

[02:40] Now, Darren didn't go so high.

[02:42] He didn't go so high.

[02:43] But trust me, all you got to do is make a little bit of an increase

[02:46] and you become part of the raise the roof club.

[02:48] Now, Justin and Peter also now part of the omokase club.

[02:52] And I also want to give a huge shout out to Cody,

[02:55] who I always pronounce his name wrong.

[02:57] It's 904 pinball zine like magazine.

[03:01] I always say Zine.

[03:03] Cody, thank you so much for joining the omokase club.

[03:06] All right.

[03:06] And I also have to do this.

[03:07] We are now at 633 club members.

[03:09] I want to go down real quick and thank all of our new members.

[03:12] All right.

[03:13] So, we have a big shout out for joining Canada's pinball podcast

[03:16] club.

[03:17] Let me know.

[03:17] And I will give you a shout out on the show.

[03:20] I'm happy each and every one of you are here.

[03:22] All right.

[03:22] So let's talk about the big news.

[03:24] Jersey Jack pinballs Elton John.

[03:27] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:28] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:30] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:32] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:34] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:36] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:38] I'm going to be talking about the big news.

[03:40] Jersey Jack pinballs Elton John.

[03:42] I've been predicting it's going to win over pinball expo.

[03:45] It absolutely is going to win over pinball expo.

[03:47] I think we've all been sleeping on Jersey Jack reveals

[03:50] because the last two have been so mediocre.

[03:53] It's been almost three years since Guns N' Roses was revealed

[03:56] to the world or maybe it was three years ago.

[03:59] And I think everybody is just really, really waiting for Jersey

[04:02] Jack to come out of the gates with the game that blows us away

[04:06] again on day one, the way Guns N' Roses did.

[04:09] Now look, Guns N' Roses blew us away because we had never seen

[04:13] a light show like that in pinball before.

[04:15] We had never seen a music pin implement assets

[04:18] quite like Guns N' Roses.

[04:20] We also remember this.

[04:21] We had never seen a Jersey Jack game with illustrated artwork

[04:25] as beautiful as Guns N' Roses.

[04:28] All things considered, Guns N' Roses had the greatest launch

[04:31] in the history of pinball.

[04:33] I mean this.

[04:33] No pinball machine has ever been launched in such a great way

[04:37] as Guns N' Roses was launched.

[04:39] And we all felt it and we all were excited.

[04:42] And then we realized the game had too much multi-ball again.

[04:45] We realized that the playfields were falling apart

[04:48] and about three to four months into the Guns N' Roses life span,

[04:51] all of the excitement died.

[04:53] And we were told they're going to fix the playfields

[04:55] for the collector's editions and then they didn't.

[04:58] And it was really a bad period for Jersey Jack pinball.

[05:00] And then they followed it up with two terrible launches,

[05:04] Toy Story 4 and The Godfather.

[05:07] Both of those machines have been sales flops.

[05:10] If you ask distributors, the games have not moved.

[05:12] And I highly doubt that they made a thousand Toy Story CEs.

[05:16] I also doubt that they made a thousand

[05:18] Godfather collector's editions.

[05:20] I think Jersey Jack has been selling more games directly

[05:24] and we don't know, right?

[05:26] We don't know how many they're selling directly

[05:29] and how many they're allocating to distributors.

[05:31] But I find it hard to believe that there are 2,000 Toy Story

[05:35] and Godfather CE machines out in the world.

[05:38] I find that really hard to believe.

[05:40] Now we are here at the moment of truth.

[05:43] The moment in which Steve Richie's departure from Stern pinball.

[05:48] Steve Richie who has not said nice things

[05:50] about his colleagues over at Stern pinball.

[05:53] Steve Richie who has been labeled the king of pinball.

[05:56] He is at the crossroads now.

[05:59] It is his turn to put up or shut up.

[06:01] It really is that dramatic.

[06:03] It really is.

[06:04] Like he's either going to come out with an epic game

[06:07] which Jersey Jack is calling this an epic game

[06:09] that is going to be one of their best selling games ever.

[06:12] Which is not really a flex because their last few games

[06:15] haven't sold very well at all.

[06:17] And really only 2 Jersey Jack machines out of like 8 or 9

[06:21] have actually sold well.

[06:22] And that's Wizard of Oz and Freakin' Guns N' Roses.

[06:25] Everything else has been sort of like a mediocre sales experience.

[06:29] And so here we are.

[06:30] Is this going to be the game that puts Jersey Jack back on the map?

[06:33] Now I have not seen the game but we all know it's Elton John.

[06:36] We saw the photo yesterday.

[06:38] You can see Elton John's reflection in the silver ball.

[06:41] And so what we get tomorrow here is what I'm hearing.

[06:44] I'm hearing this game is going to be loaded with toys.

[06:47] But we heard that before.

[06:48] We heard that on Toy Story 4.

[06:50] Somebody told me Toy Story 4 was packed and then we got it

[06:53] and it was empty.

[06:54] So is this game going to be loaded with toys?

[06:57] Jack's gone on interviews recently and said they let Steve loose.

[07:01] Steve's been saying he didn't have any restrictions in this game.

[07:04] He was happy to finally put everything he wanted into the game.

[07:07] So this game is going to be loaded with toys.

[07:10] It is based on Elton John.

[07:11] Is it going to be a concert going experience like Guns N' Roses?

[07:15] Or is it going to be more of a story driven game like Foo Fighters?

[07:18] We don't know yet.

[07:19] We do know that this game is going to be unveiled to the world tomorrow

[07:24] at noon at Chicago Expo.

[07:26] But here's the other part I'm hearing that I think is going to be the major

[07:30] story of this game.

[07:32] Even if this game wows you, even if this game excites you,

[07:36] what I am hearing and I hope this rumor is wrong,

[07:39] I am hearing that this game is not on the line.

[07:42] And if that is the case, this is a major problem for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:47] If this game is not on the line and I hear the reason it's not on the line

[07:51] and they're going to spin this,

[07:52] they're going to say because we put so much into this game

[07:55] and there's so many unique parts and interesting toys

[07:58] and mechanical magic in this game

[08:00] and so many new devices that there's going to be a delay

[08:03] on getting these highly customized parts from our suppliers

[08:07] and they're not wrong in this.

[08:08] But then the question is this,

[08:10] if they don't have all those parts to make the game right now,

[08:14] then why would they reveal the game right now?

[08:17] They didn't do that with Guns N' Roses.

[08:19] There were a hundred G&R machines in boxes when they revealed the game.

[08:23] Toy Story was on the line when they revealed the game.

[08:26] Godfather was on the line when they revealed the game.

[08:29] If they don't have Elton John's in boxes when they reveal this game tomorrow,

[08:34] you're telling me a company called Barrels of Fun

[08:37] has done it better than Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:40] Now, I'm not saying Labyrinth is a better machine,

[08:42] but they at least launched the game while the game's on the line.

[08:46] And I'm worried that Jersey Jack is going to show this game tomorrow

[08:50] and it's going to be impressive and it's going to win a lot of us over.

[08:54] But then the real question is, well, when are they going to make it?

[08:58] And is this going to be another Pirates of the Caribbean moment?

[09:02] For those of you new to Pinball Podcasting and you know who you are,

[09:05] who steal my episodes,

[09:07] if you don't remember what happened with Pirates, here's what happened.

[09:10] They ushered the game out and the game wasn't on the line.

[09:14] And then they started removing stuff from the game.

[09:16] Now, I'm not saying they're going to remove stuff from the game,

[09:18] but you know why they revealed Pirates of the Caribbean to the world so early?

[09:23] This was in my episode 500 because Jack Winari had approved to the Abbas family

[09:28] that there was demand for the next game

[09:31] because the game before Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do so well.

[09:35] And now it looks like we have the same exact thing happening again.

[09:39] Toy Story 4 is not doing well.

[09:41] Distributors are sitting on games unsold.

[09:44] The Godfather didn't do well at all.

[09:47] Distributors are sitting on those games unsold.

[09:49] And so now you have all of these distributors

[09:52] sitting on Jersey Jack inventory unsold at their factories.

[09:57] And what is happening right now?

[09:58] They know that Keith Elwin's Jaws is about to come out in December.

[10:03] So there's only like six to eight weeks before an entire

[10:07] another stern juggernaut game is going to be revealed.

[10:10] They've got this labyrinth game.

[10:12] They've got another Elvira, another run of Stranger Things.

[10:16] And so if Jersey Jack Pinball wants any of its distributors to buy any of their new inventory,

[10:21] they're going to have to move quickly.

[10:23] So I think they're showing the game at Expo without any games on the line

[10:28] because they're going to try to desperately lock in non-refundable deposits.

[10:34] And that money is going to go to distributors because they need to put some money into the

[10:39] distributor pockets who have all lost so much money sitting on inventory of games that will

[10:46] not sell in the form of Godfather and Toy Story.

[10:49] But I am just telling each and every one of you, if history repeats itself and this Elton John

[10:55] machine is $12,000 for an LE and $15,000 for a collector's edition and they say they're going

[11:03] to make a thousand CEs, why would you in a million years order one this week if the game is not on

[11:12] the line? If the game is on the line and you can take that game home in like a few weeks by all

[11:17] means order the game. But if they're going to show this game and try to lock in pre-order money

[11:23] on a game where you have no idea when the ETA is, you're going to get it, I think you need to go back

[11:29] and listen to 860 episodes of Canadian Pinball podcast and learn why that's a bad idea.

[11:35] I really want my distro friends who sell Jersey Jack Pinball and you know who they are, Joe Newhart

[11:41] at Pinball Star, you know who they are, you know who they are. Like I really want them to have a

[11:45] hit JJP game on their hands but I really want Jersey Jack Pinball to reveal it the right way

[11:52] to the world and if they reveal it and games are not on a line I'm telling you I would not order it,

[11:59] I would just wait because here's what's going to happen. If you lock in your orders now, right,

[12:04] just think about this, if you lock in a $2,500 deposit now and the game takes four months to

[12:11] get onto the line, you have no other options now. There's nothing you can do with that money,

[12:15] your money is locked in and you are also now contractually obligated to pay the other $12,500

[12:23] to get the CE or the other $10,000 to get the LE. Why would you do that if the games nowhere

[12:31] close to making its way into your home? And if you just wait two months you'll be able to see Jaws.

[12:36] If you wait a few more months there's another crazy collector game coming out that nobody

[12:40] knows about that I know about and then the end of next year is going to be capped off by Back to

[12:44] the Future and there's all this other stuff coming out too. Like if Jersey Jack is coming out with

[12:49] Elton John now, you know there's other stuff happening. It almost feels like everyone's forgotten

[12:54] that a lot of you also owe money for a little game called Pulp Fiction which nobody talks about,

[12:59] right? And I know for a lot of you out there you're making these commitments, you're doing these

[13:03] deposits and you're not really thinking through the totality of what you're going to owe if you

[13:10] keep running at all of these reveals. And again history has shown us that anyone who pre-orders

[13:16] right now that falls victim to the FOMO you're going to lose money. And so that's my thing is like

[13:22] if they show this game and it's not on the line, it's a major red flag and I would not order. Here's

[13:29] when you should order a game. When a distributor has it in a box and you say, hey I will buy it,

[13:35] ship it and I want it in a few days, you can go get Godfather's CE like that, you can go get

[13:41] Toy Story's CE like that, you can go get every single pinball machine other than what. Name me

[13:46] machine you can't go get. I could go get right now Jurassic Park LE 30th anniversary for less than MSRP

[13:54] right now. Anyone who fell victim to the FOMO you're losing out. And that brings me to this

[13:59] like labyrinth game. It's like if you order labyrinth right now, how many a week are they going to

[14:05] make? Here's what's going to happen with the labyrinth people. And for those of you who listen to

[14:08] Canada, trust me what's going to happen. What's going to go down with labyrinth is the same thing

[14:13] that went down with Scooby-Doo, the exact same thing. They're making 1100 of them. Trust me when

[14:19] I say this, that's way too many for a theme like this at this much money. I get that there's some

[14:25] of you out there that have goblin love affairs. Some of you have been angry with me for making fun

[14:30] of this theme. Some of you have shown me that you have the labyrinth movie poster in your home.

[14:35] That's cool. I just don't relate. It's just not one of the movies that came through with me through

[14:41] the 80s. Like when I was watching Star Wars and Ghostbusters and Back to the Future, I wasn't really

[14:46] telling my twin brother, screw all those movies. Let's watch the labyrinth again. Like have you

[14:51] ever heard a grown man say, hey, let's watch labyrinth. I haven't heard a grown man say that

[14:58] and I'm 47 years old. So anyway, but here's what's going to happen. They're going to get their orders,

[15:03] right? They'll get their few hundred orders. Nobody will really know what number they are in the

[15:07] lineup. I don't think they're going to bill them in numerical order like spooky or they haven't said

[15:12] they are, but here's what's going to happen. Imagine you order labyrinth and your order number 417.

[15:20] And you've given a thousand dollar non refundable deposit on a game that's $10,600.

[15:28] So that means there's 416 people in front of you that also gave the deposit. Now,

[15:34] how long do you think it's going to take them to make 400 games? Let's say it takes them six

[15:40] months to make that many games. So what do you think is going to happen in three months when

[15:45] Jaws comes out? What do you think is going to happen in five months when the next Stern corner

[15:49] stone comes out after Jaws? When another game comes out from pinball brothers? When the mystery

[15:54] game I've been talking about comes out? What do you think is going to happen when all these new

[15:58] titles come out? I'll tell you what's going to happen much like Scooby-Doo. People are going to

[16:02] get tired of waiting on the line for the game and they're going to want to get something new and

[16:08] they're not going to have like $25,000 to buy two pinball machines or $20,000 and they're going to

[16:15] say to themselves, okay, well, I'm willing to let go of my labyrinth deposit to get this newer title.

[16:21] We saw that with Scooby-Doo. People ran right in, they gave the deposit and then they realized that

[16:26] the wait was really long and then here's what's going to happen just like Scooby-Doo. People are

[16:30] not going to be able to sell their deposits dollar to dollar. They're not going to find someone to

[16:36] take over their spot with no loss. So you're going to start to see people easily, easily be able to

[16:42] get a labyrinth and save money on that $1,000 deposit. And then the other thing that's going to

[16:47] happen is this, is that dealers will order labyrinth without those games being sold yet to a customer.

[16:54] And we saw this with Scooby-Doo. They're going to start to bring the games to shows and sell them

[16:59] right off the show floor. You're easily going to be able to cut the line and get a labyrinth for less

[17:05] than $10,600. And that's why it's like the guy who's order number 800 and 900, that guy,

[17:13] if he just waited, I guarantee you labyrinth is not going to stay a $10,600 game for very long.

[17:20] This game will absolutely be losing a thousand to $2,000 over the course of the year. And the

[17:26] people at the end of the line could have saved so much money and they also could have cut the line

[17:31] if they just listened to Canada and waited. And this is not me picking on barrel of monkeys. This

[17:36] is just me trying to remind everybody what history has shown us. This is what the data shows us.

[17:45] You think that labyrinth has more enthusiasm around it than Scooby-Doo? It does not. And even

[17:51] though there's twice as many Scooby-Doo games being made, I'm just looking at what's happened to

[17:56] Scooby-Doo after only a thousand have been made. The hype falls off pretty quickly. The FOMO dies

[18:04] down almost instantly. And for a lot of you out there, if you just wait a few weeks after expo,

[18:11] do you know what's going to happen? The hype around all of these games is going to die down.

[18:17] And then the real battle begins. Then all of these distros that ordered all of these games,

[18:23] they now have to go find buyers for these games. Do you think Elvira is going to sell out when they

[18:30] make 500 new versions of an LE for $13,000? Those games are not going to sell out, but distros have

[18:38] to buy every single one. Distros had to buy all of the Jurassic Park 30th anniversaries. The distro

[18:46] inventory is going to pile up people. It's going to pile higher than Canada's ego. And when that

[18:52] happens, guess what's going to happen? You're going to be able to get a deal on every single one

[18:58] of these games. Rarity is dead. FOMO isn't real. I'm telling you, the only game you might have to

[19:04] move quickly on is going to be this Jaws SLE. All right, so that's my word of advice to you.

[19:11] Go to these shows and enjoy the games. Go to these shows, jump on the labyrinth, jump on Elton John,

[19:18] jump on everything new, jump on Elvira. And if the game's available and you can have it in a

[19:23] short time window and you really want it, by all means, buy it. But putting a deposit down to wait

[19:30] for months is a sucker's game. Only fools rush in with the deposit unless they're guaranteed they're

[19:36] going to have that game in a few weeks. Otherwise, you're being foolish. And that's just my advice

[19:41] as you guys head towards Expo. All right, so the final point I want to make on this episode of

[19:45] Canadian Pinball Podcast, we've got this alien topper from Art of Pinball, Lior, and he's only

[19:51] making 300. And I don't like it. I don't like it. I saw this thing. I don't know how much it is.

[19:55] It's like 1300 bucks, 1400 bucks, and all of a sudden, right? Anytime anything's revealed, have

[20:00] you noticed this in the pinball world now? Anything that gets revealed, we get spammed immediately

[20:05] by every single distro that's covering this thing. I'm like, I got this, I got this, I got that. Who

[20:09] wants to get it now? Bye, bye, bye. And it's so annoying. But the most annoying part about this

[20:14] topper that doesn't make any sense, they marketed this topper as an optional thing for the Ellen

[20:20] Ripley edition of the game, which is not limited. And then they're saying this topper is limited to

[20:26] only 300 units. So why would you do this if you're pinball brothers? It's almost like they're acting

[20:32] as a conduit for Lior's normal like fake scarcity mod strategy, right? He's always like, I'm only

[20:39] making 200 of these, I'm only making 500 of those. If you want to make all of your customers happy,

[20:45] why wouldn't you just sell to every single alien owner who wants the topper? Why do you want to

[20:51] tell some of your customers who spent thousands with you that they're not going to be able to make

[20:57] their machine the way they want to make their machine? It makes no sense. The only person this

[21:04] helps out is Lior and the people who will scalp these things who don't even own alien machines.

[21:11] So I don't like that they're only making 300. And if you want to make a topper limited, it should

[21:16] be connected to a very specific Ellie version of the game. So if they really wanted to make the

[21:22] Ellen Ripley version special, then it should have an exclusive Ellen Ripley topper. But that's not

[21:28] what they did. And again, I just think all these pinball companies need to be very careful. We're

[21:33] in a period now where almost every single company has like fleeced its own consumer base, like everyone's

[21:40] been greedy. Everyone's been treating their customers a little unfairly. I don't think every

[21:45] company has, I would say, I don't think Spooky's done this to its customers. Barrel of seagulls

[21:51] hasn't done it to its customers yet. But Stern Pinball has been fleecing everybody this year.

[21:56] Jersey Jack Pinball has been handing their owners nothing but huge financial losses.

[22:02] They got greedy with how much they asked for their last two games that were like baron games.

[22:06] You know, Chicago Gaming Company once again has screwed over everybody that preordered

[22:10] Pulp Fiction. There's absolutely no conversation or momentum about Pulp Fiction. You know, it's a

[22:15] real dicey game pinball. Dutch pinball has been good to its customers. You know, they're finally

[22:20] getting all the EAs made. But we're at a very interesting point in pinball right now. And I

[22:25] hear from a lot of you, a lot of us at these prices, we want to be treated fairly. We almost

[22:32] want to be treated like royalty for how much money these games are costing. And every time Seth Davis

[22:39] re-releases a game or throws a new Ellie out into the Stern world, he is absolutely destroying

[22:46] all of the goodwill that Gary and George built with the community over the years. Stern Pinball

[22:53] has the most to lose because they're absolutely going to flood their distributors with so much

[22:58] product they can't move. It's like Venom came out two years ago. Did we forget all of the inventory

[23:04] of Venom they're sitting on? Now they got to sit on these Jurassic Parks. Then they're going to sit

[23:09] on these Elvira's. We can see through these cheap tricks. It's a cheap trick to change the artwork

[23:15] and turn a premium into an Ellie and try to charge us three, four, five thousand dollars more than we

[23:20] used to have to spend on the game. I'm not falling for it. Are you falling for it? Everybody have a

[23:26] great time at Expo. Look to the entrance door. Maybe Canade is going to walk through it. Maybe

[23:31] he's not. Everyone's going to be paranoid. I really want to go to that media mixer. I heard

[23:35] something good about it. I think I might have to hop on a plane tomorrow and get through that door

[23:38] for the media mixer. Everybody have a great day. We'll talk to you soon.
