[00:00] The Bears, The Diamonds, The Painter, and the Wall, Yeah, come on, come on, now, let me hold the money, come on, come on, listen to the money, come on.

[00:12] Haggis Pimball, Limited

[00:42] How we know how deep the rabbit hole goes, we don't just know that, we now know the home addresses of everyone who lost money on this company.

[00:53] We've got the listing of the creditors for Haggis Pimball, I'm assuming this was all part of liquidation, and we also know how much is owed to each one of these creditors.

[01:05] And everyone from the banks, everyone from the distributors, everyone from the personal people out there in the world that had faith in Damien and Marty and gave this company money.

[01:17] Now look, here's the thing, I've been saying this for years, you know how I feel about this whole thing, there is no easier way to lose money, to turn a million dollars into a thousand dollars,

[01:31] than to start a Pimball manufacturing company, and we've seen this so many times, I'm not sure really what's different this time, it's always the same formula, you get a guy who has good intentions.

[01:45] You get someone who's had some success in the world of business, usually not in the world of manufacturing.

[01:52] And so that person gets bit by the Pimball bug, and then they see the amount of money that is in the Pimball hobby, which is not insignificant for a tiny, tiny little subculture, and they think to themselves, I could do this, I could start a Pimball company and make a few million dollars, how hard could it be?

[02:15] And what none of them realize is that in the world of manufacturing, that is where the wheels come off, they have no idea the hidden costs associated with manufacturing, because they've never worked for a manufacturing company ever.

[02:33] They have no idea all the different things that can go wrong, and we know in the world of Pimball, they will go wrong, so Damien like Scratch builds in his garage, a few kelts machines, and instead of slowly growing his company, the way spooky Pimball grew its company, he jumped way too far ahead of his own abilities.

[02:58] And took on way too much overhead, having no idea how to maintain that overhead, because that's really what sinks these companies, it's the monthly costs.

[03:11] And unless you're making games every single month, everybody else has to get paid.

[03:16] Your employees have to get paid, you have to pay rent, you have to pay your vendors, you have to pay for parts, all that has to go out, and nothing is coming in.

[03:25] And you can see, as we're looking at the numbers over here at Haggis Pimball, it seems like they are in the negative around two million dollars, maybe a little bit less than that, because everything on this document is in Australian dollars,

[03:40] but somewhere in the vicinity of this company is out two million dollars, and a lot of people are owed games.

[03:51] And so just to look at a couple of notable people on this creditor list that are owed money, and again, this is in Australian dollars, we've got Rick over at Planetary Pimball is owed 56,729 Australian dollars.

[04:08] How did he even allow a single game to go out if he wasn't made whole?

[04:15] And maybe he's getting a royalty for every game made, and that's what he's owed, and that's a caveat people, as I'm not exactly sure the details of what all these numbers are connected to.

[04:26] We've got this big one, business fuel of 146,511 Australian dollars, and I think that happened somewhere around Centaur being announced, so he went and got another loan.

[04:41] Now here's the macro question everybody should be asking about Damian and Marty, Marty, you don't get to get out of this.

[04:49] Also, did you notice on Pinside who started to share this information? No other, this is crazy, no other than Marty's boy, Ryan C. is chiming in and saying that he is sick to his stomach seeing all the people on the list who lost money.

[05:08] Now I thought Ryan C. and Marty were boys, and now all of a sudden he's sick to his stomach.

[05:15] The only real mystery in the Pimball world more than Haggis Pimball financials is what Ryan C. does for a living.

[05:24] If you can figure that out, that is a bigger mystery than whether or not Leor is dead or alive, because we now know that he is alive and A-OK.

[05:33] I'm not sure why Leor, the art of Pimball, why it's taken him so long to get back to people. I get it, you're in a war-torn country, you've had personal health things, but man, you have customers.

[05:46] Like on some level you still have customers and you still should do the due diligence, even if you can't get back to all your customers, just have someone who's friendly with you or a family member get back to everybody and say, hey, I'm not feeling well.

[06:00] Hey, there's a war going on in my country. Hey, just give people some update. Take a photo, do a Facebook live. He didn't do any of that.

[06:10] I mean, the fact that people were speculating that he was dead is all because of him. He didn't do enough to just let people know he's still alive.

[06:19] I mean, I know there's a lot of people out there, mainly Christopher Franchi, who wished this show would be dead, but we're still here.

[06:24] Even when I take down my Facebook, even when I do something on my Patreon, I'm always going to let you know communication is easy.

[06:33] There's no excuse for anybody and I mean it, no matter what hardship hits you. If you have customers and an obligation to people, come on, just communicate.

[06:44] Like we're all very understanding in this hobby.

[06:47] So yeah, if you know what Ryan C. does for a living, I'm going to send you a special Canada t-shirt.

[06:53] So just email me at canadepinball.com because I haven't known this for 10 years.

[06:57] The only thing I ever got out of him like years ago was that he used to like hack up playstations and sell them for money.

[07:04] I don't know what else he's doing out there in the world over there in Australia.

[07:08] Back to my point, like was this company trading while in solvent?

[07:13] And what that means is this, that this company was in solvent, it was in the red, they were in extreme debt and they knew that and they didn't have enough money to keep the business going and to make all of the orders for fathom.

[07:29] And when they knew that, what did they do? They sold more new product and I hear over in Australia, maybe in America, that that is illegal.

[07:39] I don't know all the ins and outs of how that works. I've never traded while in solvent, but it does beg the question.

[07:48] When there's those people out there that are still sticking up for Damien and Marty and for the podcasters like Jeff T. Oldis and Marty going on the airwaves and taking in new money.

[07:59] Remember, they helped people take in cent our money and did they know when they were doing that that the company was in solvent?

[08:10] And that is going to be, I think, the main question that people continue to ask as we get more information about the downfall of Haggis Pimbal.

[08:19] All right, now I'm looking at two really big numbers on this creditor list and it's Damien himself.

[08:27] So you've got Damien Hardin and Hartsko, his company at the same address, roughly a million dollars in Australian dollars.

[08:37] They say are owed to them. I'm not sure what that means.

[08:41] I think that means that maybe he put up his own money or he bought equipment through Hartsko and they're the ones who are owed the money on the equipment that was being used to make the games.

[08:55] So it begs the question, is Damien owed a million dollars?

[08:59] Is he protected somehow by listing a million Australian dollars as something that him and Hartsko put up?

[09:05] I'm not exactly sure how that works, but that's one of the biggest ticket items.

[09:12] It does look like Damien clearly paid himself a salary.

[09:17] It looks like he owes other people who worked for the company a salary.

[09:22] Now, is that Damien's salary? $621,000.

[09:27] Now, remember John Papaduc in the Zidware days?

[09:30] Do you know J-pop paid himself like $200,000 a year?

[09:33] He bought a Range Rover?

[09:36] I know that Damien flew first class like not just him, also his family members.

[09:41] When he went to Texas Pinball Festival, do you think they were flying in coach?

[09:46] Nope, they were flying first class tickets to America.

[09:50] Who do you think bought those tickets?

[09:52] Someone on this list who doesn't have a game.

[09:55] So the distributors that got burned were RS Pinball, Nitro and Flippin Out.

[10:00] Now, Zack got burned the least.

[10:03] Number one on the list of getting burned was RS Pinball in Europe, $123,000.

[10:11] Zack is down here flipping out for $60,000.

[10:15] And then let's see, I know Nitro is here somewhere around $76,000 for Australian dollars for Nitro.

[10:22] And then this list goes on and on and on and lists every single person who is owed money,

[10:28] how much money and it ranges here.

[10:32] You've got people that have $2,000 deposits.

[10:35] I saw Jeff Teolos, his name is in here.

[10:38] He's not getting a game.

[10:40] I saw people we all know like Todd McCulloch, he's on here.

[10:43] There are some people on here and I don't want to name their names.

[10:47] They clearly bought like a Fathom, Paytonfall and a Centaur or Blivian Edition.

[10:53] Remember that game was $17,500.

[10:59] There are clearly around six to eight people that paid in full for that game.

[11:05] And those people, when they paid in full for those games, they knew that the Fathom builds were having such an obstacle.

[11:13] And so it's hard to even feel bad for those people.

[11:17] They really should have been much smarter with their money.

[11:19] Then we've got the employees of Haggis Pinball.

[11:23] We've got Alex Carter, who's owed just a little bit of money.

[11:27] Then Marty Robbins is owed money.

[11:29] I don't even know how this works.

[11:31] Marty Robbins is owed $16,908 Australian dollars.

[11:36] Casey Dean is owed $14,422.

[11:40] And then Angela Harden, Damien's wife is owed $4,500 Australian dollars.

[11:45] And so the whole thing is just a crazy, crazy list of where the money goes.

[11:53] And when you think about all this money is owed, what that means, people remember, what that means is that all of that money went to Damien.

[12:03] Like it's almost hard to even fathom that, no pun intended.

[12:07] But how did he take all of that money and then he didn't make the games?

[12:12] Where did the money go?

[12:15] Where's the money? Where is the money? Where did it go?

[12:19] Who got paid? Did Aaron at Fast Pinball get paid? He probably did.

[12:23] I see Aaron is doing the solid thing now and saying, hey, we feel bad.

[12:28] We want to offer customer support because everyone who has these games, they are running on fast boards.

[12:34] But he might be laughing all the way to the bank because I don't see Aaron or Fast Pinball on this list at all.

[12:40] And so that means Aaron was smart. He got paid before he sent Damien anything.

[12:48] How did Rick not get paid at Planetary when it's his damn license NIP?

[12:53] And I think this is like a lesson learned for everybody is you just never want to end up on this list.

[12:59] Like all these people, all that money, that's a million dollars.

[13:02] Think about it. That's a million dollars that could have gone to all the other legitimate pinball companies.

[13:10] That's a million dollars that could have gone to all the other games that are sitting in boxes.

[13:16] There's a million dollars in Elton John's that could be unboxed right now.

[13:21] A million dollars in John Wick's, a million dollars in Jaws machines.

[13:25] You name it, this money should have gone to those games.

[13:28] And I think it's over. I hope it's over once and for all.

[13:33] But you know what's crazy as I say that? And I need to just say this.

[13:37] Like Turner Pinball is announcing that they are going to take pre-order money on Ninja Eclipse.

[13:43] And it's another one of these. If you pay now and give your deposit now, you're going to have your game in a few months.

[13:49] I mean, here we are again. It can't work like this.

[13:53] And I know Chris is a fan of the show and he's a listener of the show, but how can we continue to do this?

[13:58] I mean, because everybody starts these business deals with the same intentions.

[14:03] But man, like, are you going to give a nonrefundable deposit on a Ninja Eclipse game?

[14:10] And I don't understand why anybody is starting pinball like this in 2024.

[14:15] Shouldn't you go get the capital somewhere else?

[14:18] Get the money you need to make the games.

[14:21] And if you are making games, you should be able to make games and put them in boxes before people pay for them.

[14:28] I'm sorry. I mean, that's what Barrel's a fund did.

[14:31] Albeit they only made like 10 games and then they took all the deposit money.

[14:36] I mean, they did a little bit of a bait and switch.

[14:38] They did. They won't deny it. I mean, they made 10 games.

[14:42] They figured manufacturing out.

[14:44] But man, it wasn't like that line was going when that deposit money was coming in.

[14:49] They did a little bit of a bait and switch.

[14:52] And I love them over there, but they know they did it.

[14:54] Even though they sent me like baby clothes and t-shirts, I got to call it like it went down.

[15:00] But people are getting their games, you know, and the people behind Barrel's a fund.

[15:03] You got to give them credit. They're known in the industry.

[15:06] Chris Turner, you know, is he known for making games in the industry?

[15:10] No. And we know that like bringing a prototype to a show isn't enough confidence for people.

[15:17] And so if I could give Chris some advice, man, make 15 games, make 20 games, sell them,

[15:22] and then make the next 20. And again, you got to walk people through your manufacturing facility.

[15:28] I don't even know if that's confidence inspiring because we've seen all these startups.

[15:33] They know how to at the very beginning, like talk to you in a way that's confidence inspiring.

[15:41] You know, they'll say stuff like, we're going to show you behind the scenes as we make your game.

[15:47] We're going to be very transparent.

[15:49] We're excited to go on this journey with you.

[15:50] And no, you know, enough of this.

[15:53] Like I don't want any of you to be investors in startup companies.

[15:58] Stop. That is what you become when you send nonrefundable money to a pinball company that hasn't manufactured a single game ever.

[16:07] You are now an investor in a startup and the risk level if you do that is through the freaking roof.

[16:13] And why would you do that when you can go buy a game that's backed by 100 millionaires over at Stern,

[16:21] a game that's backed by billionaires over at Jersey Jack Pinball,

[16:25] a company like Spooky that's never failed to deliver a customer order,

[16:29] a company like CGC that's never failed to deliver a customer order.

[16:34] I can now say it's been 10 years, but Dutch Pinball now they have not failed to deliver a customer order.

[16:40] Now that they are whole with the Lebowski's American Pinball has delivered every game that's been ordered.

[16:47] You could just name all the companies that they have never not delivered a game that people have ordered.

[16:54] So the days of like pay now and we think you're going to get your game by Christmas.

[17:00] We think you're going to get your game by spring.

[17:02] We think you're going to get your game.

[17:04] 

[17:05] So this list is really interesting.

[17:06] If you got burned by Haggis, I'm sorry.

[17:11] I think people do need to be accountable for this.

[17:14] I think Marty and Damien are not going to say anything.

[17:18] I think Jeff T. Oles and Marty what they've done on that podcast the last few times they talked about the customers who were worried about Haggis.

[17:26] I think they owe everybody an apology.

[17:29] Do I think Marty's as much to blame as Damien?

[17:32] 

[17:32] I don't.

[17:34] But do I think he's been smug throughout?

[17:36] I do.

[17:38] Do I think we should let someone like that back into the community?

[17:42] I mean maybe if he really genuinely apologizes, but man here's the problem.

[17:49] Is he clearly knew that things were this bad when he was doing those shows?

[17:55] And that to me is really the moment of when you find out what's in the hearts of men.

[18:02] If you know you're wrong and you know things are over to then go and use your credibility and your reputation to convince people to stay in on the journey to give new money on centaurs.

[18:18] You did that.

[18:20] You did that when you knew you were trading while in solvent and I don't know.

[18:25] Like I think there needs to be a point in which just go away.

[18:29] Right?

[18:30] I think these people, we don't want to see you again.

[18:33] I don't want to see you laughing at pinball shows.

[18:35] I don't think it's a laughing matter and you know what you did.

[18:38] Because people remember they could have done what I'm doing right now.

[18:42] They could have done what Lior just did yesterday.

[18:45] They could have just talked to us and been honest.

[18:48] They could have, but they didn't.

[18:51] They didn't.

[18:53] They manipulated and they misled people and they knowingly did that and that is the part that is hard to forgive.

[18:58] I mean we all make mistakes.

[19:00] I've made mistakes.

[19:02] Typically when I make a mistake, usually there's alcohol involved and usually the next day I wake up, I'm really apologetic and I really feel terrible.

[19:12] I'm not doing podcasts doubling down on my behavior.

[19:16] And so here we are.

[19:18] Right? Here we are.

[19:20] I think there's a lot of great pinball coming.

[19:22] I think there's a lot of legitimate companies that deserve your money.

[19:23] I think there's too much great pinball sitting in boxes right now with no home.

[19:30] And I think the big problem in the hobby now is everyone's out of space.

[19:34] It's not even like most of us.

[19:36] Yeah, like you could say we're out of money, but we always as grown men, we find stupid ways to rationalize buying these games.

[19:43] We can always find more money, but it's a lot harder to find more space.

[19:47] So I think a lot of people are out of space.

[19:49] I think this like haggis thing, I think what it does do is it's like,

[19:53] it does remove a lot of the enthusiasm for the hobby because it does start to paint us as a community, as a bunch of fools.

[20:02] Because think about it, like, you know, how many times do we have to get fooled before this hobby wakes up and grown men stop being impatient?

[20:12] Because think about it, if you were not impatient and you just waited for games to be made and put in a box, you would not have lost any money.

[20:21] But that's the thing.

[20:23] It's like, it just kind of gets old being a part of a community with so many impatient men who just can't wait.

[20:33] You know, we're like babies.

[20:35] I mean it when I say it, we're like babies.

[20:37] I'm raising two little children.

[20:39] That's how they behave.

[20:41] Like they get really impatient and start crying when they don't get what they want immediately.

[20:47] We are supposed to be the adults in the world.

[20:49] We're supposed to act with a lot more wisdom and not act like children.

[20:55] And so all these people that were throwing money at these companies when there was clearly no games going out the door, you act it like a child and you didn't even get your baby rattle.

[21:07] Like you got nothing in the end and it sucks.

[21:10] And I think anyone who listened to Canada's Pinball podcast was saved from that train wreck.

[21:15] I know now everybody's going to make content exposing this company.

[21:21] I did it when it wasn't popular and that's all I want to say everybody have a happy Friday.

[21:26] We'll be back next week with more shows.

[21:29] I need to talk about some other stuff going on.

[21:31] We've got rumored games coming out.

[21:33] We've got more medieval madness is coming out.

[21:35] We've got more medieval madness toppers that are now available, which means the game is right around the corner.

[21:40] It's interesting to see what CCC is going to do as they rerun medieval madness final edition.

[21:46] 500 more are coming.

[21:48] So everybody be good.

[21:50] Have a great weekend.

[21:52] Enjoy time with friends and family.

[21:54] It's August.

[21:56] Like again, pinball is a winter sport and we'll be back.

[21:58] Canada out.

[22:11] Yeah.

[22:16] We're running tall.
