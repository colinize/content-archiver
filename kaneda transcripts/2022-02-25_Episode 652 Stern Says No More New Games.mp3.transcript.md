[00:00] Do you really wanna, do you really wanna taste that?

[00:13] CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA

[00:17] Ah, welcome to Canada's Bimbal Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. The war is going on in the Ukraine.

[00:23] Prices of stocks are plummeting. Gas prices are going through the ceiling.

[00:28] What will happen in the pinball world in 2022? Will any of these outside forces impact this hobby?

[00:35] Well, we did get the biggest piece of news this week from Gary Stern.

[00:39] And he has told us Stern Pinball's plans for 2022.

[00:43] And whenever the biggest pinball company in the world that has like 80 to 90% of the pinball market

[00:48] makes a statement like Gary did, it's gonna have ramifications for this entire hobby in 2022.

[00:56] We're gonna talk about what he said, but first a moment of silence for Barry O'Berry.

[01:00] Rest in peace. We're all gonna miss you. And we're sad that we're not gonna see your latest efforts over at American Pinball.

[01:08] You know, life is really short, everybody. We've lost Barry O. We lost Lyman Sheets.

[01:12] And I think it's another lesson for each and every one of us that we really need to really celebrate every day above ground.

[01:19] And these pinball machines that we talk about, they're not that important. We all know that.

[01:23] You know that. I know that. And I think I know most of you out there who listen and most of us

[01:28] have pretty balanced lives and we're into this because it's just fun to be into this.

[01:33] So let's talk about Gary Stern's news. Okay, so here's what Gary Stern said.

[01:38] Gary Stern has said that there will be only two cornerstone releases from Stern Pinball in 2022.

[01:46] Now, I didn't even realize that Stern has a cornerstone schedule of releases. And it usually is this.

[01:53] There is a new game in January, another game in April, and another game in August. And it makes total sense.

[02:01] I think last year it was Led Zeppelin, Mandalorian, and Godzilla. Those were the three cornerstone games.

[02:07] Now, I was told that the next game was going to be Venom by Stern Pinball, and we were going to see it in April.

[02:16] But now Gary has officially said there will be no new game in April from Stern Pinball.

[02:21] Now, this move makes total sense because the backlog on orders over at Stern Pinball is in the...

[02:28] I believe it's almost like 10,000 games they have to make just to fulfill the backlog of orders.

[02:36] I was talking to just one distributor, one. And you know him well. I'm not going to name his name.

[02:41] And he said his backlog is over 700 games. And so Stern Pinball can't release another game

[02:49] and make people wait for their Mandalorians and their Godzilla's and their Elvira's and their Batmans.

[02:55] And they're... And they're... And they're... You could keep going on and on and on of some of these machines people have been waiting months for.

[03:02] Like if you ordered a Godzilla premium, the wait to get it was like 9 to 10 months. So this is huge news.

[03:09] Let's talk about what I think this is going to create in the Pinball hobby. I think first and foremost, if you bought a premium or a pro at a premium price,

[03:19] which means if you paid over sticker for a pro or premium machine, because there was no inventory at distributors, you're about to lose a lot of money.

[03:28] And I said this, buying a pro or premium over sticker price is the dumbest thing you could ever do because Stern Pinball was always going to make more.

[03:36] And I know people get impatient, but we've seen on Pinside some of the prices people are asking for premiums,

[03:43] right? Over 10 grand for premiums, 8 to 9 thousand for some of these pro machines. Why? Stern is going to make more pros for like 6,600 bucks and more premiums now for like 9 grand.

[03:55] Now that's the other thing that's kind of crazy. Stern is going to change the price, I believe, of all games moving forward to reflect the new prices.

[04:04] So every single Stern premium now will be 9 grand. Wow. Just think about that. But the good news is this.

[04:12] You're not going to have to spend over 9 thousand dollars to get anything. And they're going to make more premiums of every single hot title people want.

[04:20] And it's just going to be let's crank out as many of these as we can get because the wait now to get a new game is August.

[04:28] Now, do I think the August release is going to be Venom? There are some people out there that think Venom is a codename for Cobra Kai.

[04:36] Now, I don't think that's the case. I don't want a Cobra Kai pinball machine. I've seen the show. I mean, it's a great show. I love it.

[04:43] I just don't think it would translate very well into pinball. I couldn't really tell you like what would the toys be?

[04:50] Like would it be the stage of the karate tournament? Would it be the Cobra Kai dojo? I don't know. I don't really want a Cobra Kai pinball machine.

[04:58] And I don't think it's Cobra Kai. My very good sources have said it is a comic book version of Venom.

[05:05] With Brian Eddy and Zombie Eddy on artwork. And so if you think about that, if it's a comic book version of Venom, it's not associated with a new Venom movie.

[05:15] They could probably release this game anytime they want. And also Venom is making his way into the Spider-Man sort of multiverse.

[05:23] So I think delaying Venom is actually a smart move. Now, this also means for the first time since we've been covering Stern Pinball,

[05:32] it is going to shift everything down the pipeline, which means there's going to be more time to R&D these games.

[05:40] So will that mean we're going to see more put into the next Keith Elwyn, which is rumored to be Jaws?

[05:46] And also what happens now to James Bond? See, here's the part that I think is going to happen.

[05:52] I don't think Venom will be the August release. I think if James Bond is ready to go or Jaws is ready to go,

[05:59] who are you going to give seniority to come August? Will it be George Gomez? Will it be Keith Elwyn?

[06:06] Because that's it. That August release becomes the big selling pin of the year for Stern because that's the pin they sell during the holiday season.

[06:14] And they've traditionally given that August block to Keith Elwyn. So really interesting time.

[06:20] So also when I heard this news, I was kind of bummed out because I don't want to only talk about Rush as being the latest Stern

[06:27] over the next six months, like six months and all we're going to get from Stern is Rush, Pinball, and then all these older games.

[06:35] Now, it's great for all of you guys who have ordered machines, but from a content creation standpoint,

[06:40] it sucks that we're not going to have a new Stern machine because that's what really keeps this hobby interesting

[06:47] is every three to four months, Stern has a new machine because the rest of the industry has shown us

[06:53] that they can barely get new games on the line. Now, here's the other thing that's crazy. This window now

[06:59] is also a window of opportunity for every single other pinball manufacturer to take advantage of the fact

[07:08] that Stern Pinball will not be releasing another game in April. Now, here is the saddest part.

[07:14] I think only one company out there is going to take advantage of this window and it couldn't be better timing

[07:20] for the company called Jersey Jack Pinball, which has Toy Story right around the corner,

[07:25] rumored to be coming to TPF on the line in April. Think about this serendipitous timing if you're JJP.

[07:32] Stern Pinball, as announced, we're not coming out with a new game in April.

[07:36] No one's going to be ordering more Stern machines because of the backlog, which means all of the money will flow to JJP

[07:44] if this game is great and if the playfield issues are no longer an issue. This is perfect timing for JJP.

[07:51] If you're over there, you've got to be like, this is the moment. Now, the other thing I would do if I was JJP

[07:56] is this, and I'm just going to say this from a marketing standpoint. If I walked into that boardroom and I said,

[08:01] guys, what are we pricing the collector's edition at? And let's say they tell me 15 grand. I mean it when I say,

[08:07] guys, let's charge 17.5. They'll still sell out. They will absolutely sell out because there's nothing

[08:13] else available. And Stern's saying that they're not bringing a new game to market

[08:18] is a golden opportunity for Jersey Jack to pretty much charge whatever they want for this new game because they know

[08:25] that all of these rich collectors, and you know you're one of them, you know you're going to want to get something new

[08:31] and shiny out of a box. And there's nothing that Stern's going to put new and shiny in a box for almost six months.

[08:38] So you're going to want this game. And from what I'm hearing, Toy Story should be a game that is Pat Lawler's last.

[08:44] It should be his swan song game. And I expect big things of Toy Story. I have not seen it.

[08:51] I don't know what's in it, but I really think that this is going to be a game that Pat Lawler is going to want to go

[08:57] out with a bang, or he's going to go out with a fizzle. It's going to be one or the other, right?

[09:01] This thing's either going to exceed our expectations or it's going to be disappointing.

[09:06] I really think there's no middle ground when it comes to JJP launches, but I'm rooting for them because this is a dream theme.

[09:13] Now, what about everybody else? The biggest failure in pinball is American Pinball's timing because I am hearing that Dennis Norman's game

[09:22] will be ready. Wait for it in August. You're kidding me, David Fix. You're legitimately have nothing new to sell people.

[09:31] When they're saying your biggest competitor, Stern, is saying there is a six month window in which we will not be selling anything new

[09:39] and you have nothing new to sell people. What horrible timing for AP. And once again, this company just doesn't have it.

[09:47] They just don't have their ducks in a row. And then you're going to launch an original IP Dennis Nordman game in the same month

[09:55] that Stern is going to come back with a bang. Like, do you really want to put Dennis Nordman's game up against George Gomez's James Bond or Keith

[10:04] Elwin's Jaws? Like, that's horrible timing for you. And so if you're American Pinball, how do you not go in there and be like,

[10:11] can we just finish this game up in the next couple of months and get it on the line?

[10:14] Like, what else do we have to do to finish this game? And it was over a year ago in which Dennis Nordman joined this company.

[10:23] So how is it that Stern can R&D a game in a year and get it to market, but American Pinball takes almost two years to get a Dennis

[10:31] Nordman game to market. And it's an original IP game, guys. It's not like they have to get assets and permission.

[10:37] You don't have to submit any of it to anyone for approval, which means an original IP game should be the easiest thing to make.

[10:46] And here it is. American Pinball is not going to take advantage of this sales opportunity.

[10:51] We're also looking at Chicago Gaming Company, maybe, right? If they can get cactus canyons on the line, that's a good opportunity for them.

[10:59] But here's where the real opportunity lies for CGC. Not just cactus canyon.

[11:05] I think they should do more runs of Monster Bash and Medieval Madness and Attack from Mars. And if they were smart,

[11:11] they should be looking at the Royal Edition and how successful that was.

[11:15] And they should make Royal Editions of Monster Bash and of Attack from Mars and make it for the Super High-End Collector and watch every single one sell out.

[11:25] Did you see the jerky who's asking $29,000 for a Medieval Madness Royal Edition? Seriously.

[11:33] If you ask $29,000 for a game that was easy to get at $10,000, you should be banned from Pinside for life, alright?

[11:41] So Stern has got this window of opportunity. Is Haggis going to walk through this window of opportunity?

[11:46] I mean, there is still no update in the Haggis form. I mean, it's kind of funny reading the thread on Haggis Pinball.

[11:53] Nobody wants to see a picture of production. Nobody wants to ask for anything. It's everyone joking about snakes. Let me tell you.

[12:01] I think it's not going to get any easier on Damien and Company getting these games to market.

[12:07] It is hard to make pinball. It is hard to secure all the parts. It's hard to get labor to understand how to make these things.

[12:14] It's hard to make hundreds of pinball machines and fulfill your customer's expectations in a short window.

[12:21] And so if you're Damien, I mean, you've got nonrefundable deposits, so he doesn't need to sell more fathoms.

[12:27] He needs to figure out how to make this company profitable. That's the big challenge and that is the hill I think they could die on.

[12:33] We'll see what happens. So who else is out there, right?

[12:36] Dutch pinball is still making Lebowski's. It feels like forever. You've got the pinball brothers with the alien LVs should be shipping soon.

[12:44] We've got the Spanish company with the Hoops game. That is pretty interesting.

[12:48] But who else is out there? Spooky pinball. They've got nothing new to sell you. They're sluggishly making these games.

[12:54] Like I'm not seeing a ton of Halloween and Ultraman unboxings every week.

[12:59] So I think they're also suffering from a supply shortage. So the whole industry, right? Stern is basically saying

[13:06] we're gonna stop and just make old orders. The rest of the industry has really nothing new to put out there

[13:15] other than Jersey Jack pinball. It's gonna be a humongous,

[13:19] humongous sales period for Jersey Jack. I am gonna go on the record and predict that toy story becomes the fastest selling.

[13:28] The most successful Jersey Jack pinball machine of all time.

[13:33] I know that some of you out there think it's a kiddie theme. It's not. Pixar movies

[13:39] are made for adults that also appeal to children. Also, if you sit down and watch Toy Story and don't enjoy it,

[13:49] I mean this when I say it. You're dead inside. It is one of the greatest movies of all time.

[13:55] The entire franchise, the Rodden Tomatoes score for Toy Story movies is always like 95% and up.

[14:04] I have never met anybody who did not enjoy the adventures of Buzzing Woody and trying to get to Infinity and beyond.

[14:12] The story is amazing. All of the movies are amazing. So for those of you out there that are like, this is stupid.

[14:19] I'm not buying Toy Story. Well, you don't seem like you'd be a lot of fun at the bar because every grown adult

[14:25] I know loves Toy Story. Okay, so then we've also got P3 Multimorphic. Let's not forget this weird-out

[14:33] Museum of Hilarity. This is a great opportunity for Jerry to sell this platform, especially

[14:41] as Stern goes on a new release, Hiatus. Now, will Jerry be able to make the games? That is the big issue.

[14:50] He is going to have a great opportunity to get a lot of orders and get games into people's homes.

[14:57] He needs to hire like three times the amount of people to make these games. If I'm Jerry, this is your moment.

[15:03] This is your moment to go all in to invest everything you have in manufacturing efficiencies.

[15:11] You've got to fulfill orders, Jerry. You can't be making like five a week.

[15:15] This is your moment where you need to actually get a few hundred games out a month and get a user base up.

[15:22] The only way this platform can survive, if there are thousands, at least a thousand people with P3 Multimorphics,

[15:29] because if you have a user base of like a thousand people owning P3s, then every time you have a new game,

[15:37] you're going to have a thousand people that want it. That's how it works when you have a platform like this with a modular kit system.

[15:44] This is the moment for Jerry. Will he be able to do it? Will he be successful?

[15:49] I don't think they're going to be able to make games fast enough.

[15:52] I think people are going to get frustrated and I think he's not going to be able to put hundreds of machines in people's homes every month

[15:59] during this six month window of opportunity as Stern doesn't make any new games.

[16:03] So a little bit of mixed emotions for me on this whole thing. Like I'm bummed out that we're not going to get a new Stern.

[16:09] I think going to TPF now is all going to be about Toy Story. Now if Toy Story does not make its way to TPF,

[16:16] there pretty much is almost no reason to go. And I mean this and I love going to shows and I guess I shouldn't say that because the whole reason

[16:24] we go to shows is to hang out with each other. I actually take that back. I will be going to TPF

[16:29] to hang out with you guys. Now I just think TPF will be so much better if we get a new game release at TPF.

[16:36] I wish like Ed and Kim could go to JJP and say can we

[16:42] officially communicate that a new game is going to be at TPF this year because I think that drives a lot of attendance.

[16:48] And I know that JJP I think is going to try to surprise us the way they did with dialed in.

[16:53] Like they're going to usher these games in and pull the sheets off of them.

[16:57] And that's fine, you know, and then we know Jersey Jack Pinball is going to have one of the greatest launch videos for Toy Story.

[17:03] Like Ken is not stupid. Ken Cromwell and the team over there, they have successfully, each new game,

[17:09] they've worked with this great video production company to launch their games better than every other pinball company.

[17:17] And for those of you out there who think it doesn't matter, it matters. How you show up on day one, it matters.

[17:23] And it's important to put your best foot forward because you want to get people excited. And especially at these price points,

[17:31] you need to get people excited because if you're asking me for 15 grand and all you do is push a machine into the room the way they did Cactus Canyon,

[17:39] I wasn't excited during that Cactus Canyon reveal. It didn't make me want to order the game. And I mean this when I say it,

[17:46] the lackluster reveal of the game carried over to my experience playing it because you had this lackluster reveal.

[17:54] Then we all like moseyed on over to just four games on the floor. And it was really lackluster. Like, I don't know.

[18:00] I kind of felt like, you know, it's Cactus Canyon. It doesn't shoot that well. It doesn't do anything amazingly new.

[18:06] It's a typical fan layout game. I mean, there's a reason why Cactus Canyon isn't one of the most popular games of all time.

[18:12] And it impacted my desire to buy one. It did. It really did. All right. So we shall see. Like, we've only got a month to go.

[18:19] So we've only got a month to go. So I'm really looking forward to TPF. I'm looking forward to going there.

[18:24] I think, you know, prices are going to start to come down now. And it's not just because of what Stern said.

[18:29] Look at the economy. Look at what's going on in the world. For a lot of us out there, if you have any money invested in crypto

[18:36] or even like blue chip stocks, you just lost a lot of money. And we're going to keep losing a lot of money.

[18:41] And as gas prices go through the roof and as inflation impacts all of our lives and real estate prices go through the ceiling, everything.

[18:50] Right? Everything. I think the way we live and our standard of living is going to go down a little bit with world affairs.

[18:58] And when that happens, you're looking down at your pinball collection that's worth over $100,000.

[19:05] You know, when your wife wants to go on vacation and you might be a little cash strapped, are you going to sell your investments at a low point?

[19:11] No, you'll probably look to cash out some of your pinball investment. And I will say this. If I were some of you,

[19:17] I think some of you are sitting on games that you know are not worth anywhere near what the market will pay for it right now.

[19:25] And I do implore some of you out there, let them go.

[19:29] Sell them at these high prices and laugh all the way to the bank as idiots are paying 18 grand for a stranger things LE.

[19:38] Like if you have an iron maiden, new and box LE, 25 grand, sell it.

[19:43] Seriously, sell it. There is no difference between an iron maiden premium, which they are now going to run again.

[19:49] There's no difference in the game. And I think, you know, a lot of us with all of these LEs and LEs everywhere,

[19:56] 1,000 now and this many LEs and SLs, it doesn't matter. We all know they're not really special.

[20:02] If you just want to enjoy pinball and enjoy the experience of pinball, there's no reason to own any LE.

[20:08] It's amazing that Stern and everybody else has cajoled all of us into placing value on what's value list.

[20:14] Like we are placing value on a plaque and some armor and some stickers and that's it. That's the only difference.

[20:20] There's no difference in gameplay in any of these. So think about it. I do implore all of you out there with collections.

[20:26] Like I have 30 machines. I have 40 machines. I have 80 machines. Why? Why do you need 80 pinball machines?

[20:33] I don't think you do. I don't think that gives you enjoyment more than 20 would. And let's face it.

[20:38] There's only like 20 pinball machines that are worth owning. I mean, if you had the top 20 pinball machines,

[20:44] I have a hard time believing you're not happy. So those people that have got like 100, 500, you know, there are people with like 1,000.

[20:51] Like it's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. And I'm not hating. Like God bless. If you have that much money to invest in pinball, like more power to you.

[20:57] Anyway, everybody, thank you again for your support. It's always a pleasure doing these shows on a weekly basis.

[21:02] I will be back with more news. Oh, and one last thing I didn't mention on my last show.

[21:06] Jersey Jack Pinball will be rerunning Wizard of Oz. So if you want a Wizard of Oz, do not pay over for one.

[21:15] And that means they're going to make more Yellow Brick Road editions of Wizard of Oz. That's the remake they're going to be doing.

[21:21] And so I saw people paying like 18, 19,000 for Yellow Brick Road. Wake up people. They're going to remake everything.

[21:28] If there's money to be made, pired to the Caribbean, they're going to remake it. You know, it's going to happen one day.

[21:35] So just put your money back into your wallet. Nobody cares that you've got expensive pinball machines. Buy machines you love.

[21:43] Buy machines you want to play.

[21:44] Don't buy machines to put 87 plays on it in four years and then try to sell it for 300% profit.

[21:51] That's not why pinball exists. Everybody have a great day. We'll talk to you soon.
