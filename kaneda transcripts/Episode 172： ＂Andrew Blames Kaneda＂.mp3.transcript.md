[00:00] follows our ethos that we want to be able to manufacture as much as possible in a 2-week.

[00:07] In 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week, in 2-week.

[00:16] Oh

[00:25] OMG

[00:27] Andrew highway is blaming me

[00:31] Canada for the failure of his company. He's blaming me that people want it to pull out of his business

[00:40] Do you really I can't believe this you guys are getting like the weekend where canada just like spills the truth and

[00:49] Goes off but listen to this Andrew highway is back on Pinside a man who drove a pinball company

[00:58] Into the ground a man who took hundreds of thousands of dollars from people and

[01:05] Had absolutely the worst business acumen is blaming a podcaster

[01:12] For the failures of his business he wrote in this new email that he said on Pinside a

[01:19] well-known podcaster here was

[01:22] Incessantly posting podcast aimed at destroying the company

[01:28] Also two anonymous ex employees were posting damaging comments even though they were under

[01:35] NDA non disclosure agreement also a UK poster here again under NDA

[01:43] Went on a campaign to destroy the company not only this but this person emailed

[01:50] Highway pinball customers directly and telling them to cancel their orders

[01:54] You tell me a company that can effectively survive such hostility towards it

[02:00] Combined these led to nervousness amongst customers and many canceled if cancellations are greater than orders

[02:07] You do the math all right Andrew highway

[02:10] How dare you come back on to Pinside and

[02:15] Accused me

[02:17] Accus rubber ducks

[02:19] Accus other people of telling customers to get the fuck out of highway pinball the only reason

[02:28] People pulled money out of highway pinball is because you lied

[02:33] You failed to deliver when you said you would it's not my fault the fact of the matter is this this man continues

[02:42] To not accept the blame for all the terrible business decisions he made I did not make Andrew highway make full throttle

[02:52] I did not make Andrew highway tell people back in the day

[02:57] RIP he told people back in like 2000 what was it like

[03:02] 13 2014 that he was going to make

[03:05] 500 pinball machines a day do I have to go and re air for you the

[03:12] Alien Day podcast where all I did was play Andrew highway's own words from his mouth about what he said highway

[03:22] Pinball was capable from so the fact of the matter is this this man is coming back on to Pinside

[03:30] To say that it was my fault that his company hit hard times

[03:35] Are you F-ing kidding me?

[03:38] Is it my fault that magic girl and raza and like zidware collapse?

[03:43] Is it my fault that predators won't be made what other

[03:47] Laymasks use is this guy gonna come up with to like to to like get back in the hobby and

[03:55] Ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen listen to like why snow the man who I always pick on

[04:01] He was the early adopter of alien pinball

[04:04] He bought one of Andrew's early versions of the game and he has not been supported by these new

[04:11] Investors he can't get the replacement parts on his broken alien machine

[04:16] So I am just like absolutely flabbergasted that Andrew highway wants to once again come back to the hobby to defend

[04:26] His name and defend his honor Andrew you want to defend your honor come on this show

[04:33] Come on canators pinball podcasts. I will happily interview you

[04:38] About all of the things you've said in the past about all of the missed truths you've put out there the missed deadlines

[04:44] The way you tried to fake shipping Ellie pinball machines the only reason my podcast was able to tell people to get their money out

[04:54] When they could is because you failed to deliver the machine years

[04:59] After the fact you were supposed to deliver that machine two years before I started telling people to get the F out

[05:08] So don't you dare blame me for your problems at highway pinball

[05:15] This is the problem with this hobby and then Andrew highway gets how many of votes through his post

[05:21] Let's see oh 30 people 30 people think that's a great 31 people voted that

[05:27] I like literally are you people that stupid that you think Andrew highway was just this innocent

[05:34] Business man that wanted to make alien pinball and it was canada that destroyed it and let me tell you this the fact that he's saying

[05:43] X employees who were under NDA

[05:46] This and that and rubber ducks under NDA. Let me tell you something non-disclosure agreement right so these people

[05:54] Disclosed information that was

[05:57] Accurate that was truthful about the situation going over at highway pinball if these individuals and if I did not report

[06:07] On what was actually happening at highway pinball

[06:11] Do you know what would have happened a lot more people would have lost their money because Andrew highway

[06:19] Bit off more than he could chew all right

[06:21] This is not a personal attack against Andrew

[06:24] He just didn't know how to set up a large pinball manufacturing company when we see videos of people in his factory

[06:34] Using screwdrivers by hand to make pinball machines

[06:38] How the f could people believe in a company like that and I'm just I'm absolutely flabbergasted that Andrew highway is back on pinside

[06:48] And he's not banned by the moderators robin are you listening you don't this is a duplicate account

[06:56] Is it not of Andrew highway and you're gonna let a guy back on the pinside that was

[07:03] Basically gonna lose people their money Andrew highway was he he failed

[07:10] He failed and like hundreds of thousands of dollars of customer

[07:15] Money was gonna be a race evaporated because of him and he wants to blame me. It's funny. I really do Andrew

[07:23] Canada pinball at gmail.com you email me at any time

[07:29] You tell me when you want to talk about how a podcast a podcast

[07:34] Took down a pinball company

[07:36] Because last time I checked

[07:39] You were out there running your mouth about how many machines you were gonna make you were out there running your mouth about how you were gonna

[07:45] Have your machines available in 2014 you're the idiot

[07:49] You're the idiot who went and signed oric to do the art package on aliens because you don't have access to google

[07:57] And couldn't find a better alien artist every decision you made Andrew is the reason why your company failed

[08:05] If you wanted to put me in charge of a pinball company and I was making the decisions and I was making alien pinball

[08:12] Do you think it would be the game that it is today?

[08:15] Absolutely not don't ever don't ever

[08:19] Blame me for the failures of your company and don't ever crucify

[08:25] The ex employees of your company that spoke the truth. Okay?

[08:30] Do you really want me to read out loud because I will I will read out loud the transcript

[08:37] Between you and one of your employees

[08:39] That showcases who you really are as a person Andrew you need to just go away get back in your Porsche truck

[08:47] That you probably bought with consumer dollars get back in your truck go back on your vacation

[08:53] You will not be

[08:55] Back in this hobby. Okay, because I won't let you return because men like you don't deserve a second chance

[09:05] I get you wanted to make all this happen. I get you wanted to make a pinball machine

[09:11] But at the end of the day my friend you took people's hard earned money

[09:17] And they are still without game in November of 2017

[09:24] You required your investors to reinvest a whole new large sum of capital

[09:30] To make up for your mistakes and all the decisions that led to highways failures were yours

[09:38] Not mine. So don't you ever

[09:41] Andrew highway point the finger at me and the pinball community should be ashamed for letting this clown back on the forums

[09:49] The he should be blocked from posting and from communicating because Andrew highway is another

[09:57] Example of someone who had no right

[10:00] Taking people's hard earned money because he didn't deliver what he said he was gonna do and it wasn't my fault

[10:07] Have a great weekend people who knows how many more podcasts

[10:10] I'm gonna put up this weekend

[10:12] This should just be the weekend of like me throwing up a bunch of random thoughts

[10:17] Uh, but it's the truth. I can't believe this guy is blaming me. What a freaking clown

[10:22] I will happily

[10:24] Stand toe-to-toe with that clown in his face and tell him what I think of him

[10:29] And if he wants to come after me, he knows where to find me

[10:31] I never got any you know what I never got any legal notification from Andrew highway about

[10:37] Slander you know why because everything I said was 100% the truth

[10:42] 100% and the fact that he's back on pinside to blame me for the collapse of highway pinball

[10:51] For he wanted you to bury the truth. He wanted he came up to me at expo and said are you trying to sabotage my company?

[10:58] And I said to him in his face the only one sabotaging your company is you if you ship alien pinball machines

[11:06] You have no problem. You know what he did? He didn't the man didn't he lied to you. I didn't

[11:13] I told you the truth. He is the liar good night
