[00:00] And exchange commission versus Mueller.

[00:02] Who do we have for the government?

[00:04] Morning, Your Honor.

[00:05] This is Dave Massey on behalf of the Securities Exchange

[00:07] Commission.

[00:09] Thank you.

[00:09] And for the defendant.

[00:12] Morning, Your Honor.

[00:12] This is Jay Hewlings on behalf of Robert Mueller.

[00:16] Thank you.

[00:17] And good morning, Your Honor.

[00:20] I'm sorry.

[00:20] This is Ed Snyder on behalf of the co-defendants, Jeffrey Mueller

[00:26] and Belinda Breen, co-trustees of the MB Hale, Ohana Trust.

[00:33] Thank you.

[00:35] Anybody else on the line?

[00:37] No.

[00:38] OK.

[00:40] So this is an action brought under the Securities Act.

[00:46] And back in, I guess, October of 2021,

[00:53] Mr. Mueller received from US Attorney's Office or the Department

[00:58] of Justice a target letter indicating

[01:03] that he may be under criminal investigation for the same matters

[01:08] arriving out of the civil case.

[01:11] Do we have any update of where we think the criminal matter is?

[01:16] Let me start with the SEC.

[01:20] No, Your Honor.

[01:21] We don't, as you, Mayor, and I know,

[01:23] we don't necessarily coordinate our investigations with the Department

[01:30] of Justice or the Attorney's Office.

[01:31] So Mr. Hewlings may have a better idea in terms

[01:34] of what his interactions have been,

[01:35] but no further update beyond that target letter from the SEC.

[01:41] Mr. Hewlings, any update?

[01:44] Yes, Your Honor.

[01:45] We've met with the two AUSAs handling it.

[01:49] Bill Lewis and Bill Harris.

[01:51] We've got the target letter.

[01:52] We know the case exists.

[01:54] I think we know that it started with the SEC complaint.

[01:58] In this case, that was the referral they sent over the complaint.

[02:02] I don't have a ton of visibility into what

[02:04] else the US Attorney's Office is doing.

[02:06] I don't.

[02:07] We haven't received any subpoenas.

[02:08] We're not aware of any.

[02:09] Certainly, I haven't done any search warrants,

[02:11] but it wouldn't have to in this case,

[02:13] because a lot of the investigation's been already

[02:15] completed by the SEC.

[02:18] So I think we're at the point where we know it exists.

[02:21] We know they're taking it seriously enough

[02:22] to issue a target letter, but we don't have a lot of visibility

[02:25] into what else they've done.

[02:29] Your client was invited to appear before grand jury.

[02:34] Did your client do that?

[02:35] No, Your Honor.

[02:36] We have not.

[02:40] Let me ask the question of reversing.

[02:42] Did your client decline to appear before the grand jury?

[02:46] It hasn't come to that yet.

[02:48] They sent the target letter.

[02:49] We haven't followed up on a, hey,

[02:52] we're going to go to the grand jury in next date

[02:54] if your client wants to come testify.

[02:56] Here's the time.

[02:58] It hasn't been.

[03:00] They have not followed up in that way.

[03:04] So, Your Honor.

[03:06] No, you go ahead.

[03:08] I think to the candidate, based on my discussions

[03:13] with Mr. Lewis, I think there were

[03:16] a little bit of a sense of the government

[03:19] was going to wait the government, as in the U.S.

[03:20] Attorney's Office knew that there were some settlement

[03:23] negotiations going on between Mr. Mueller and the SEC

[03:27] and wanted to see what came of that.

[03:29] Obviously, they have not resolved the settlement.

[03:31] I think there are some legal issues

[03:35] that are keeping us apart, but we did negotiate in good faith.

[03:40] And I don't think we're quite done.

[03:41] I think there's room to go back to it.

[03:43] But I think they were aware.

[03:45] Well, they're aware, because we told them.

[03:47] And may have been waiting to see that,

[03:51] all right, is this going to play into something?

[03:56] But beyond that, that was a few months ago.

[03:58] I had that conversation.

[04:01] I haven't had an update since then.

[04:05] So, pending is the motion to stay.

[04:08] And then the grounds for that is basically

[04:12] the tension between discovery going forward

[04:18] and exercising Fifth Amendment rights is applicable.

[04:22] I'm wondering, is there any way we can continue discovery

[04:26] in this civil case without any kind of

[04:30] Fifth Amendment implications?

[04:32] Is there any other discovery we can be doing

[04:34] or other kind of motion practice that we can engage in

[04:39] apart from an actual deposition of Mr. Mueller?

[04:44] I'll start with the SEC.

[04:46] Yes, your honor, as you might imagine,

[04:48] and a fair number of our cases,

[04:51] defendants take the Fifth in our cases.

[04:54] And in those cases,

[04:56] defense counsel and defendants are able to raise

[05:00] a robust defense and engage in false and discovery.

[05:03] So, our view is that this motion is pretty

[05:08] entirely premature.

[05:10] Mr. Mueller is full to engage in the full range of discovery

[05:14] as are we prior to his taking a deposition.

[05:20] Rental discovery experts run the gambit.

[05:23] So, in our view, we should go ahead and proceed.

[05:27] We have a target letter, I think,

[05:29] going on five months ago,

[05:32] and we filed this complaint in August

[05:35] and have yet to really engage in any discovery.

[05:38] So, we'd like to move forward and go forward

[05:40] on a normal basis.

[05:44] So, for that reason, we don't see there's any prejudice

[05:47] or really at this stage to Mr. Mueller

[05:51] with proceeding with discovery of the normal course.

[05:55] And so, when you're talking about discovery,

[05:59] what are you talking about?

[06:01] Other than the deposition of Mr. Mueller,

[06:03] what other type of discovery do you think

[06:05] you need to start engaging in?

[06:08] Certainly with the request for production of documents,

[06:10] there was an investigation,

[06:11] but there were still documents that we feel

[06:15] had to be produced from Mr. Miller and other witnesses.

[06:18] Other Rule 45 subpoenas that we would need to engage in,

[06:21] as well as the initial discovery in terms of interrogatories

[06:25] and potentially request for admission,

[06:27] and then depositions of third party witnesses.

[06:31] And then, if needed, potentially experts.

[06:34] So, all those things would be things

[06:37] that we would like to proceed going forward with your art.

[06:41] Mr. Huling, so why can't all that go forward right now?

[06:47] I deny the motion this day,

[06:50] but limit discovery at this point

[06:52] to not taking your client's deposition

[06:55] until other avenues of discovery have taken place,

[06:59] and we revisit a deposition of your client in three months.

[07:04] What's wrong with that idea?

[07:06] Well, I think it would need to be supplemented a little bit,

[07:09] because it wouldn't just be his deposition,

[07:10] interrogatories or request for admissions to Mr. Mueller,

[07:13] could also implicate the Fifth Amendment.

[07:16] I don't think document production

[07:18] would necessarily be as problematic.

[07:20] Certainly third party discovery

[07:21] wouldn't be as much of a problem.

[07:23] There is an issue with, we filed an answer,

[07:26] and in our answer, we asserted the Fifth Amendment

[07:30] to most of the factual allegations.

[07:33] As it is right now, the SEC could take an adverse inference

[07:36] and produce some documents in the move for summary judgment.

[07:40] That would create a situation

[07:43] where Mr. Mueller's Fifth Amendment rights

[07:45] would end up being used against him, essentially,

[07:49] and would put him in that hops and choice

[07:51] that we described in the briefing.

[07:54] A couple of ways to work around that

[07:56] is a deadline to amend pleadings

[07:59] that is relatively late to give us the opportunity

[08:03] to consider whether or not to waive those rights

[08:07] and fight this case on the merits.

[08:10] But if the case is allowed to go forward

[08:13] all the way through, say, summary judgment,

[08:18] if it's not stayed, then the existence of the criminal case

[08:24] is all but forcing us to concede the civil case

[08:29] because we'd have to change our answer

[08:33] and then therefore waive the right

[08:35] for the rest of the proceeding.

[08:37] That's the part of the problem.

[08:39] There are middle grounds.

[08:41] We can go forward with some limited discovery.

[08:44] The government can produce their initial disclosures.

[08:46] We can do third party discovery.

[08:49] We can move forward with quite a bit of that,

[08:58] but for us, it's the concern about,

[09:02] we have to be able, right now, with the answer to the way it is,

[09:08] and the answer is the way it is because of the existence

[09:10] of the criminal case, we're still put in the box

[09:13] where we have to either sacrifice the criminal case

[09:17] to dispute the civil allegations

[09:19] or sacrifice the civil case to maintain our rights

[09:24] in the criminal case.

[09:26] And that is, you could push that down the line a little bit

[09:29] where that kind of problem really comes to a head,

[09:32] but probably not that much.

[09:36] So I think there are middle grounds, Your Honor,

[09:38] but I think we have to be careful and judicious

[09:42] as to which ones we choose.

[09:44] I would also note that although this case is preliminary,

[09:48] you do have cases out there that grant stays

[09:54] in cases that are like this.

[09:56] And if anything, where there's less of an impact

[10:00] on a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights,

[10:02] the Maritrust case in the Northern District,

[10:06] there was already a default judgment

[10:08] against the defendant in the SEC case,

[10:10] and they were doing some post-judgment discovery.

[10:14] And the criminal case was only a few months along

[10:18] and was very preliminary, and I think it was Judge Fitzwater,

[10:21] still stayed the civil discovery and saying that,

[10:25] well, even though there is really no impact

[10:27] on the Fifth Amendment rights,

[10:28] because there's already a default judgment,

[10:31] there's still attorney's fees

[10:33] and the marginal impact on the rights,

[10:35] so I'm still gonna stay this case.

[10:38] So it's still within the range of the court's discretion

[10:42] to stay this case, at least as to Mr. Mueller.

[10:45] I would also note that the bankruptcy case is proceeding.

[10:50] There was a 341 creditors meeting,

[10:52] and Mr. Mueller testified,

[10:54] started the Fifth for the most part,

[10:55] for the most substantive questions.

[10:57] And that proceeding is leading to auctions,

[11:04] efforts to liquidate the assets of the companies

[11:08] and raise enough money to pay back investors.

[11:12] The entity defendants did not answer

[11:15] and appear to be headed for a default.

[11:18] So the SEC can take their default against the entities,

[11:22] work out whatever they need to work out

[11:24] with the bankruptcy trustee,

[11:25] and the case against Mr. Mueller personally

[11:28] can be stayed.

[11:32] Without a lot of impact on the efforts

[11:37] to give recoveries for the investors,

[11:39] remember the court's already frozen Mr. Mueller's assets.

[11:43] The money is not going anywhere.

[11:45] So all the stay would do is stay the case as to Mr. Mueller

[11:51] and allow everything else to go forward.

[11:54] That would be another way to slice this.

[11:57] In some ways it might be cleaner

[11:59] than trying to figure out what part of discovery

[12:02] can be stayed and what can go forward.

[12:05] Two points for you.

[12:08] One is you let me to believe in your earlier comments

[12:11] that there were legal issues that needed to be resolved.

[12:14] I'm not sure what you meant by that,

[12:16] but I was thinking that perhaps you thought

[12:20] that your client had some motions

[12:22] for summary judgment points he could raise.

[12:27] Was that your point or was it something else?

[12:30] No, in the, this is maybe previewing things a little bit,

[12:34] but I think the key disagreement in our discussions with the SEC

[12:37] about whether or not we could resolve this case

[12:39] is the application of the recent Supreme Court case in L.I.U.,

[12:46] which discusses how discordsments be calculated,

[12:49] how that would apply to this case.

[12:51] I think that's a major disagreement between the parties

[12:53] that I think at some point the court's going to be asked to resolve.

[12:56] We're not quite there yet, but I was explaining that's,

[12:59] we had discussions, I think we forecast to the court

[13:02] that we've had some settlement discussions.

[13:04] They did not reach a resolution in part because of disagreements

[13:07] as to how L.I.U., SEC versus L.I.U. applies to the facts of this case.

[13:14] And the second point, you're not saying that the bankruptcy proceedings

[13:20] operate as a stay in this civil case, are you?

[13:23] No, we have not attempted to stay the bankruptcy proceedings.

[13:28] No, what I'm talking about is whether a bankruptcy,

[13:32] because of this case being in bankruptcy, it stays my proceedings.

[13:36] No, no, we're not saying that, Ron.

[13:38] There is an exception for SEC enforcement actions.

[13:41] So there's no stay because of the existence of the bankruptcy case.

[13:45] What I was saying is that there's still an avenue

[13:49] for the investors to recoup some of their funds through the bankruptcy case,

[13:54] which is part of what the SEC is supposed to be doing

[13:57] in getting a disgorgement remedy.

[13:59] It's all supposed to go to the same place.

[14:01] So the entities look like they're going to default.

[14:03] They're the ones with the assets.

[14:05] That, well, to the extent there are already assets,

[14:09] that process can go forward.

[14:11] Whatever can be gained by liquidating those assets

[14:14] can be distributed to the investors

[14:17] and whatever funds that Mr. Mueller has are currently frozen.

[14:21] So there's not a lot of loss to the investors

[14:25] by staying the case against Mr. Mueller.

[14:28] The rest of it can go forward.

[14:30] We just, in a clean sort of way,

[14:33] we're going to take the Mueller case

[14:35] and we're going to hold it for a little while

[14:38] until, frankly, we take our efforts to try and get a

[14:42] declination from the US Attorney's Office.

[14:45] And it doesn't have to be indefinite.

[14:47] We can do this in three or six month time periods

[14:50] and just come back periodically for updates.

[14:54] So Mr. Snodder, you want to chime in here.

[14:57] I'm still leaning towards opening limited discovery,

[15:01] not allowing the deposition of Mr. Mueller,

[15:03] allowing depositions of third parties,

[15:06] allowing for request for production,

[15:09] disallowing any request for admissions being propounded

[15:13] and only interrogatories as to factual issues

[15:17] that would not implicate the Fifth Amendment.

[15:20] Your thoughts on that, if any.

[15:22] Your Honor, my thoughts are actually geared more towards

[15:25] the bankruptcy proceedings.

[15:28] My understanding from speaking with counsel,

[15:31] with Mr. Hewlings, is that Randy Pullman,

[15:35] and I noticed that Leslie Hyman, his partner,

[15:38] is here attending this hearing.

[15:40] Maybe she can speak to this.

[15:42] But my understanding, Your Honor, is that Randy Pullman

[15:45] has the intention of suing my clients, Jeffrey Mueller

[15:49] and Belinda Breen, the trustees of the trust,

[15:53] under the Tufta statute for fraudulent transfers,

[15:57] basically the same claim the SEC is bringing in this case.

[16:00] And so if this case, the SEC case,

[16:03] is allowed to go forward as to my clients,

[16:06] my clients will be subjected to potentially

[16:10] duplicative discovery, litigation,

[16:13] and just a multiplicity of lawsuits.

[16:16] And so for that reason, we believe that the SEC case

[16:21] should be stayed in order to allow the bankruptcy proceedings

[16:26] to continue in any litigation that Mr. Pullman

[16:29] decides to bring can proceed in that court.

[16:33] Let's complicate this further.

[16:36] So, yes.

[16:38] Yeah, yeah, may I just bring up a few points, Your Honor?

[16:41] Yes, go ahead.

[16:43] Yeah, sure.

[16:44] As to Mr. Hewling's first point on terms of any prejudice

[16:49] that his client might have, I think the law is clear

[16:51] that that is just not sufficient in order to grant a stay.

[16:55] Secondly, I think it sort of misstates the laws

[17:00] that relates to the application of in-first,

[17:03] in-first in this case.

[17:05] I think the law is pretty clear that the answer alone

[17:08] is not going to be sufficient to give an adverse inference.

[17:11] We would need to bring in independent and cooperative evidence

[17:14] to get that inference, which you then, you or the ultimate

[17:17] fact finder would have the option to take.

[17:20] So, and so of course, the notion that we would somehow,

[17:25] based on the answer alone,

[17:27] file a motion for summary judgment next week or something

[17:30] to that effect is, I just don't think it's realistic.

[17:33] Secondly, I would...

[17:35] It's not realistic and I wouldn't grant it.

[17:38] So, and I think the further that, you know, at any time,

[17:45] you know, of course we will work with Mr. Hewling,

[17:47] I think we've had a good cooperative dialogue with,

[17:50] in terms of timing to amend the pleadings.

[17:53] So even on the answer itself, of course,

[17:55] he could amend his pleadings.

[17:57] And we have numerous cases, even after a defendant

[18:00] has taken a deposition where prior trial,

[18:02] they indicate that they want to, you know,

[18:05] not invoke and go ahead and testify,

[18:08] we have arrangements to do that as well.

[18:10] So I don't think going forward discovery prejudices

[18:13] Mr. Mueller near to the degree that Mr. Hewling has described.

[18:16] And furthermore, I would note that the Amerifer

[18:19] trading case that he mentioned is, you know,

[18:22] like you said, there had been a default,

[18:24] there had been a finding in liability already.

[18:27] And the court there was only staying the deposition

[18:29] of the defendant, not a blanket stay,

[18:32] all while, you know, over the entire case.

[18:36] And moreover, in that case, the court weighed the interest

[18:39] that the SEC didn't even need the request of discovery

[18:41] in order to make determinations about discords with that receiver

[18:44] or seeking in terms of a remedy phase of the case.

[18:46] We're in a much different phase of the case here

[18:49] where we haven't even, you know,

[18:51] begun to do discovery onto the core issue of liability here on it.

[18:55] And then lastly, I would just note to Mr. Snyder's point,

[18:58] again, this is sort of the first time I'm hearing of that,

[19:01] of that concern, but I would say I'm certainly,

[19:03] we could come up with ways to facilitate, you know,

[19:07] you know, doing discovery in a way where we can give it

[19:10] to the trustee as well as to the parties in the bank

[19:13] of C case, if the extent we're providing a discovery to them

[19:16] in the same timeframe and we can do it with Mr. Hewling.

[19:19] And as your honor, I think noted, there is certainly no,

[19:22] in fact, there's an express exemption in the law

[19:24] for staying our case due to the bank of C proceeding.

[19:31] And if I may, your honor, Mr. Nassie and I,

[19:35] we actually don't disagree on what the law is,

[19:37] but we agree that just the answer alone is not sufficient.

[19:42] He would have to produce probably initial disclosures

[19:45] and enough documents to corroborate his claims

[19:49] and then the SEC's claims.

[19:51] And then the court would have to decide whether or not

[19:53] to actually apply an adverse inference

[19:56] or allow the jury to.

[19:58] So there are a couple of intermediate steps.

[20:01] As to the cases, your honor, I mean, the cases are very,

[20:04] all very fact specific.

[20:06] You can see from the briefing, we're both sort of picking

[20:08] apart different elements of different cases.

[20:11] I mentioned the briefing, the tandem management case,

[20:14] which is a Southern district of New York case.

[20:16] There was an SEC case filed and then there was a criminal case.

[20:19] They came after it and the court just simply took the SEC case

[20:22] off its docket.

[20:24] Nope, that's not going forward.

[20:26] And it came back years later after there was a conviction

[20:29] in the criminal case.

[20:30] So at the same time, you, in a lot, in a lot of other cases

[20:34] where there has not yet been an indictment,

[20:36] courts more often than not wait for the criminal case

[20:41] to get a little further along.

[20:42] There's lots of different factors you can pick at if we're

[20:45] going to get into which cases go which way.

[20:48] But I think the bottom line of all of them is this is well

[20:52] within the court's discretion, not only to stay the,

[20:55] the whole case, it, it, it, depending the criminal case,

[20:59] but even to sort of do what the court is talking about here,

[21:03] allow some discovery to go forward, not allow discovery

[21:07] against Mr. Mueller, kind of be, you know,

[21:10] give a long length of time for us to file an amended pleading.

[21:14] There's a lot of range here for the court to,

[21:18] to, to use its discretion.

[21:20] And one of the cases that was talked about briefing from both

[21:23] sides is the Gonzalez case, which is Judge Martinez,

[21:26] I don't know, Paso.

[21:28] And what the, what Judge Martinez mentioned is one of the

[21:32] options the court had was protective orders to prevent any

[21:37] discovery in the civil case from being used in the criminal

[21:40] case. It's a bit extreme and tends not to happen a lot.

[21:43] You read that opinion, you get the sense that Judge Martinez

[21:46] was worried about an older case being stayed further.

[21:50] And, and there's a section about the efficiency of moving the

[21:54] docket.

[21:56] That's not really a concern here.

[21:57] It's just cases only six months old.

[21:59] But you can, you can think about this, all these cases together

[22:05] and a way to keep Mr. Mueller's rights protected without

[22:12] significant adverse consequences while allowing the bankruptcy

[22:17] case to go forward, which would allow some remedies for the

[22:20] investors.

[22:23] And you can do that with a stay.

[22:26] I think that's the cleanest way.

[22:29] Say that gets revisited periodically and then we can push the

[22:32] U.S. Attorney's office to make a decision, which is hopefully a

[22:35] declination, or, or if, if not that some limited version of

[22:40] discovery so that parts of this case may proceed and then we

[22:44] kind of kick the can down the road a couple months until we get

[22:47] closer to the point where all of the third party discovery has

[22:51] been exhausted and we're looking at that position of Mr.

[22:54] Mueller and the ROGS and RFA.

[22:57] So there's, there's some ways to parse it while to protect

[23:01] Mr. Mueller and allow relief to the investors.

[23:07] So we have not.

[23:11] I don't believe I received a scheduling proposal from you.

[23:17] Is that correct?

[23:18] That's correct.

[23:19] The conference is due on Thursday.

[23:21] We were actually Mr. Nessie and I spoke earlier today.

[23:24] We were going to ask the court for a little more time based on

[23:27] this hearing to work one out.

[23:29] Maybe a week or two.

[23:32] So let me recognize Ms.

[23:35] Hyman to see if she has any thoughts on this.

[23:37] And also I want to put on the record.

[23:39] The Fifth Circuit conference will be held sometime in May,

[23:42] I believe in this Hyman is the chairperson of the San Antonio

[23:47] Bar Association's federal courts committee.

[23:49] And so I've extended an invitation to her to be my guest at

[23:53] the Fifth Circuit conference.

[23:55] Given her role there.

[23:57] I do not believe it poses any conflict in this case.

[24:01] But I wanted to put it out there.

[24:03] Any objection from the SEC.

[24:05] No objection.

[24:09] Mr. Hewlinx.

[24:10] Yeah, no, of course not.

[24:11] Your Honor, I'll be there as well.

[24:15] Mr. Snyder.

[24:17] No objection, your honor.

[24:18] Ms. Hyman and I are old friends.

[24:22] So Ms. Hyman, do you have any thoughts on discovery here?

[24:26] Just so you know, so your honor,

[24:29] I'm actually in the process of drafting you an email that

[24:32] something has come up and I don't think I am going to be there.

[24:36] Well, that resolves that.

[24:40] I'm doing with my child's school,

[24:42] but we don't have to go into the detail.

[24:45] Your honor, Leslie Hyman on behalf of Patrick Lowe,

[24:48] the trustee in the deep root bankruptcy cases.

[24:52] I think that's a good point.

[24:54] I think that's a good point.

[24:56] I think that's a good point.

[24:58] It is very much our interest to move forward.

[25:03] Mr. Lowe has an obligation to marshal assets of the estate.

[25:07] We need to do that as quickly as we can.

[25:13] There are certain things that are causing the estate to incur costs.

[25:18] But I don't think we have a particular position as to whether

[25:22] this case goes forward and how as they are related,

[25:26] but as we already discussed in the briefing,

[25:30] the SEC is entitled to go forward,

[25:33] notwithstanding the bankruptcy filing.

[25:37] Ideally, the US Attorney's office would figure out what they're doing,

[25:41] because we would like to speak to Mr. Mueller,

[25:43] because he has information that would help us.

[25:46] And I think that's a good point.

[25:50] And I think that's a good point.

[25:53] And fulfilling our obligations to the estate.

[25:57] But other than that,

[25:59] I don't believe that we have a position one way or the other as to

[26:02] stay in this case, as long as it is limited,

[26:05] whatever the court does is limited to this case.

[26:08] And the parties in relation to this case and doesn't affect.

[26:10] Mr. Lowe.

[26:15] I think that the state is granted in part tonight in part.

[26:19] It's denied almost in full though, with this exception.

[26:25] So discovery will continue to go forward in this case.

[26:30] The parties are to meet and confer and come up with these proposed scheduling order.

[26:39] So the deposition of Mr. Mueller,

[26:42] I'm trying to balance moving this case forward,

[26:45] balancing the interest of all the parties,

[26:48] the alleged victims, and then Mr.

[26:51] Mueller's fifth amendment rights.

[26:54] And so we're going to bifurcate any deposition of Mr.

[26:57] Mueller.

[27:00] So that for now,

[27:03] a deposition of Mr.

[27:04] Mueller can not be done.

[27:06] That for now, a deposition of Mr.

[27:09] Mueller cannot go forward in this case.

[27:12] Until such time as the parties again,

[27:14] approach me and we lift that stay.

[27:18] Any interlocutories and requests for admissions that are propounded to Mr.

[27:23] Mueller should be drafted such that they would not require the invocation of any

[27:29] fifth amendment issues.

[27:31] So there's bound to be those some

[27:35] interlocutories or request for admissions just asking for authenticity of a document.

[27:40] Those kind of issues would be appropriate and would not require any fifth amendment

[27:45] invocation.

[27:47] So those kind of things were allowed.

[27:49] Any depositions of third parties, of course, are allowed.

[27:54] And so you all can go forward on that basis.

[28:01] With regard to dispositive motions,

[28:05] you probably ought to have a deadline on those.

[28:08] It's some some time out along with amendment of pleadings.

[28:13] If the SEC does decide to file a motion for summary judgment.

[28:18] Before we reach these issues regarding Mr.

[28:21] Mueller, I'm in all likelihood going to grant any request for

[28:27] continuances of a response for a motion for summary judgment.

[28:31] So that sort of advance notice to the SEC.

[28:34] Don't bother filing at this point or anywhere close because it's not going to be well received as I try to still balance any

[28:44] that the amendment issues regarding Mr.

[28:47] Mueller.

[28:49] Any points of clarification we need to make with with that ruling from the SEC.

[28:56] No, I don't think you're on just one.

[28:59] I think housekeeping measure was the timing of the initial status report is Mr.

[29:04] Hewlin's indicated a week to 10 days from now.

[29:07] We'll be able to the SEC.

[29:10] You have two weeks from today.

[29:15] Anything by way of clarification, Mr.

[29:17] Hewlin's anything you think I missed.

[29:20] No, your honor, I think that I think that's a not right now.

[29:25] Thank you.

[29:27] Mr.

[29:28] Snyder.

[29:29] None for most your honor.

[29:31] Miss Hyman.

[29:33] No, your honor.

[29:35] Good enough.

[29:37] I'll wait to get that scheduling order and.

[29:41] Well, I'm thinking in this case, we probably ought to think about having intermittent status conference just to see how we're doing and where we're at.

[29:53] So, in your in your proposed scheduling order, why don't you coordinate with Ms.

[30:00] Fernandez and schedule something like in the four month mark that we can all visit and figure out where we're at.

[30:09] Good enough.

[30:10] Thank you.

[30:11] Thank you.

[30:12] Thank you, your honor.
