[00:00] Alright, this was gonna be like a special edition but it went a little longer so it's gonna

[00:26] be episode 106 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast and on this one this is actually a really big episode

[00:34] because we're gonna get a first-hand account of what it's like to play Alien Pinball in a home

[00:41] environment. Home environment. We're gonna talk to Brad who went to Tpf with some money in his

[00:50] pocket and walked out of Tpf with an alien. Now he went in pre-order to the game for years,

[00:57] he didn't do any of that stuff. He simply called a distributor and inked a deal to get a game

[01:02] and I give him credit for that resourcefulness. If you want a game, money always talks, money always

[01:08] talks, all these pre-order lists and people waiting for years, call distributors. If they're gonna

[01:12] get their hands on some because we all know distributors always have their own inventory and they

[01:17] can sell it to whoever they want. So Brad congratulations on getting one. But this podcast,

[01:22] we're just gonna talk to Brad and Blake Dumasnell over in Houston, Texas and I pretty much give them

[01:29] the floor. I give them the floor to talk about their impressions with Alien and the machine and I

[01:35] think you're gonna hear it from them first-hand what they think. I think you'll walk away from it

[01:40] with one feeling and one feeling only. Ship it already. Get it to people. It's enough is there,

[01:48] enough is enough. Get the game on the line. But without further ado, I want to give you the

[01:52] world exclusive feedback of Alien in the home environment. Let's roll the tape.

[01:59] All right ladies and gentlemen, I have a special edition of Candace Timbal podcast where we are

[02:04] going to record live but you'll hit record it. Two gentlemen which are playing Alien Timbal

[02:11] in a home use environment. I want to welcome Blake Dumasnell and Brad, Barryman, you guys are

[02:17] wearing Houston right now. Yes sir. All right and you guys, Brad, it's your alien, right? Tell us

[02:25] how long you've had it. I know you got it from TPS but just like what was it like sort of

[02:30] bringing an alien home? Well obviously I was just beyond words excited. It's kind of been a dream

[02:38] theme for me. I knew I wanted it. I've known for a while and so yeah kind of had to do a little

[02:46] work. I had a had a TPS basically well ahead you know contacting Melissa and working out a deal

[02:53] with her basically to be able to bring the game home from TPS. I was super excited to be able to

[02:59] do it. Got it home and you know like any new game had to do a few tweaks and adjustments here

[03:06] and there to kind of get it to play the way that I think it is capable of but I'm really happy

[03:11] with it. Really excited about it. And when you were an angel was at TPS with you too Brad so

[03:17] walk me through sort of when we played at the show I know like the alien head wasn't turned on

[03:23] at the show itself. Was it nerve wracking sort of knowing that you were going to take home a game

[03:29] that people were going to play for for two days two and a half days straight at a highly

[03:35] traffic show like TPS? I had a little bit of concern. Luckily I wasn't I didn't have to pick the

[03:44] game I was taking home until you know the end of the show. So it was actually kind of nice to be

[03:48] able to have three games there. I'll be able to judge how each one played and and then at the end

[03:55] of the show you know be able to pick the best of the three at least what I thought was.

[03:59] Right and when we got to the show one of them had had the class had broke during shipping. So

[04:06] you were like all right now it's I'm going to pick the best two out of three right I mean that

[04:11] eliminated that one. There the choice down pretty quick it was it was actually pretty neat I was

[04:15] able to help them up do the unboxing and that was one of the ones I felt kind of bad because as

[04:21] soon as I pulled the box off they were like oh I don't think you're going to want this one.

[04:24] Right and so yeah we saw the glass diamonds everywhere and and it did chip the scratch with the

[04:31] playfield a little bit so yeah that one was kind of a no-brainer kind of broke that one off and

[04:38] and settled between the other two. When I know Andrew went over the game with you before he let

[04:46] you take it home what kind of things was he going over what was he telling you about the the

[04:50] product you were going to about to put in your house. It was more of a general overview of kind

[04:56] of the guts of the game and how the game operated you know it's a little different from a stern

[05:02] so I just wanted to be able to at least look under hood no kind of what I was looking at.

[05:08] Right. I'm pretty handy with the with the ranch up you know I've done a playfield swap or two

[05:17] I brought a few older games back to life so I mean I know my way around Pinball Machine pretty well

[05:21] and so I wasn't you know super concerned about some of the more basic stuff but I did want to

[05:27] understand you know a little bit more just how everything kind of tied together under the hood.

[05:33] So he did he kind of walked me through that and so yeah the alien head I'll be straight up with you

[05:43] I don't think they have the production boards ready for that I think you know as you as you

[05:47] probably saw on the forums it was sort of last minute getting production boards into these games

[05:55] you know the one that Wysnow has out on on route originally didn't come with production boards

[06:02] they were factory built boards so mine had all the production boards it has all of the you know

[06:07] the the black nylon inserts on the on the flippers you know how you can drop the flipper mix completely

[06:13] out of the playfield and so it is you know what I consider a production I think with the exception

[06:18] of that one board so basically I walked out of there knowing that Andrew was straight up with me

[06:24] and you know told me that basically once they get their hands on that they're gonna get me out

[06:30] a new board for that and and at that point you know the alien head will function fully.

[06:36] Did he did he tell you how many weeks now I'm not gonna I think he said two weeks

[06:40] I'm not gonna set that one. All right so the game is pretty much all there the alien head boards are

[06:47] are they're still waiting on final production for those so you get the game you get the game home

[06:53] um what was like firing it up was it just walk us through it the listeners here and Blake

[06:59] we're gonna this is Blake you can jump in now too because these two guys both have been playing it

[07:03] just but give me your initial thoughts and then guys both do you tell us like what your your

[07:07] gameplay feedback is for people listening to the show okay so I'm obviously as the owner I'm

[07:12] a little biased and being a being a dream theme and everything um you know my opinion you know take

[07:19] it for what it's worth um I will say my expectations were really high going into it and I haven't been

[07:26] let down the the sounds on this game the light show in this game it really shines in home environment

[07:33] um I kind of want I have him talika premium also um in my office here and so I was looking for

[07:39] something kind of a little on the opposite end of the spectrum you know not so uh hired you

[07:44] rock and roll the kind of more something a little moody and uh this this definitely fits the bill

[07:49] there right uh so I mean for me I was I was really pleased I was uh and like I say once you get

[07:55] the lights off and uh you know it's you're in the dark room by yourself it's it's pretty damn uh I

[08:02] hate to use the word immersive I know that's kind of right right round on now but Brad when you

[08:06] were setting it up um what's any stuff need to be like tweak to sort of dial it in as they say to

[08:12] get it playing right well yes Chris in fact there were um I kept a list uh running list of any

[08:20] issues and if you want to go into that I had 16 tweaks to the machine or so that I that I did

[08:27] uh to make the game uh a little little just play I think the way that it is is more designed to play

[08:37] right uh what what we're like if you want to call out like the things the major things that you

[08:41] think you know any new owner is going to want to like check this first these few things

[08:46] okay well if we're talking about specifically the alien machine um one thing that's that you're

[08:53] going to have to kind of stay on top on is this LCD screen right in the center of the play field

[08:59] it's adjustable so it can be raised or lowered and during shipping it may you know uh it may settle

[09:08] or and I don't know maybe after a bunch of plays or whatever it gets vibrated loose but um if

[09:13] that thing is not level you could run the risk of potentially chipping your play field right and

[09:19] that's what I saw with one of the other games there at tpf basically the play for the LCD in the

[09:25] play field had dropped low enough to where balls were hitting the edge of the play field and it

[09:31] uh chipped one of the edges of the play field it's adjustable it's not like secured in a bracket

[09:37] that makes it absolutely flush I mean it's it's there's because it would seem like you know that

[09:41] what causes dimples might cause that screen to keep pushing lower yeah honestly I think the the

[09:48] met could use a little improvement that's something you know that I'm debating you know uh

[09:54] Andrew mentioned actually when we were adjusting it that there there could be some springs in the

[09:58] mechanism that can keep it a little tighter right keep it you know uh from being adjusted but

[10:04] that was one of the big ones another big one that I had was there's an airlock scoop at the top

[10:09] of the game is to the left of the alien head it's pretty important shot in the game because it

[10:13] basically starts and stops your modes when I got the game home the thing was just firing straight

[10:19] down the center and as much as I enjoyed you know having a new game and all the join all the

[10:26] sides and sounds and everything a little frustrating having all my games end up you know straight

[10:31] down the midter shots once you finally qualify to mode and hit that shot so uh I I I pulled that

[10:38] mech out um it's it's pretty easy to pull out I think there's about five or six screws that

[10:43] mount it to the bottom of the play field and there's you know the nice thing about Andrew's system

[10:49] is everything's got connectors on it so I didn't have to sassader or clipney wires or anything I just

[10:53] unclip a couple wires from the coil unscrewed the mech I tried to basically adjust the mech but it

[11:00] there wasn't much play at all in that mech so what I ended up doing was taking it out and getting

[11:05] a drill and drilling out the holes a little bit extra uh to give that mech you know drilling out

[11:10] the mounting holes basically so you could just shimmy it just a little bit just that ball seminal

[11:15] a little more play yeah exactly to our could adjust that mech just enough to where now it fires

[11:20] pretty reliably down the left blipper yeah and that and that that's an important shot because

[11:27] everything you do to to get through the modes on this game revolves around getting the ball into

[11:32] that scoop so when we were playing earlier it's playing fantastic now in terms of um you know

[11:38] the ball going to a flipper um whether it's the ride or left it kind of varies a little bit but

[11:45] but basically yeah that would be incredibly frustrating if you know it was going down the middle

[11:50] every single time you you shot that because it seems like every 20 or 30 seconds you're doing

[11:56] something in the game where you have to hit that scoop shot right okay so bride and Blake so knowing

[12:03] that you're like one of the first people in the world to have this machine are you giving this

[12:08] kind of feedback to Andrew has he asked you to sort of report back like any issues you're you're

[12:12] finding as you play it I have um and they've been you know really good honestly I think communication

[12:20] has been really good um the the sound guide David Thiel contacted me as well and I sent him all

[12:30] the audits from the machine from tpf and I've since cleared it um I think there's the possibility at

[12:37] least they're talking about the possibility of having you know they have basically a tournament

[12:41] setting they were kicking around the possibility of having a setting for operator and then a home

[12:48] setting as well and so I think that uh anyway I don't know if they will or not but I thought

[12:53] that was pretty cool if they were interested in getting the audits back and looking at that and

[12:57] I did like I say on every time I made a little tweak or something I wrote down little

[13:02] notes on I guess I'm kind of in a wet way but just kind of wrote down what it was that needed

[13:07] adjusting and what the fix was so I did type of a memo um copied Andrew and copied really the

[13:15] highway support team um I got an email back from helmet he's the customer service manager there

[13:21] at highway and he was uh you know appreciative and basically reached out to say you know hey we're

[13:27] gonna support you 100% and he also echoed Andrew's comment about getting the Xeno headboard to me

[13:33] as soon as possible and and he thanked me for some of the other you know commenting about some of

[13:40] other issues I think some of them are known to them um it's maybe something that they needed tweak

[13:45] and manufacturing process um example of that was uh the ball kick out to the uh to the trough to

[13:54] the shooter lane um it wasn't firing 100% um there was a couple of times where it would take a few

[14:02] kickouts you know to load that ball up and I'm just thinking you know why why would it do that

[14:07] and right anyway stick you I was sticking my finger down in there and you could feel there is a

[14:12] a metal lane protector that they have screwed on to the shooter lane and it was just barely

[14:18] overhanging the mech uh the the ball launches up on and so it was kind of glancing off that on

[14:24] occasion and not coming out cleanly and that was just two screws took that off took a dremel to

[14:29] it ground it back a little bit screwed it back on and now it's firing 100% so another just a

[14:35] little tweak right right so I mentioned that too and that like I said I don't know if that's just

[14:41] something they're gonna have to tell the people who are mounting that park maybe to uh not mount it

[14:45] so close to the met or something I don't know yeah I mean it's so I definitely think this feedback

[14:51] is helpful right because I think everyone knows that probably the worst instrument you can ask people

[14:56] to go go get on a new unbox machine is just go grab a drill and you'll be fine you know after

[15:02] after you do that so these units right and when you when you bought it from coin ticker brie was

[15:08] it was sort of like a stab was like this is sort of it is kind of like a beta pre-final production

[15:13] unit and you were totally cool with that you kind of knew that going in I knew that um you know

[15:20] honestly it was it was it was a role of the dice and I really wanted the game I knew I was

[15:26] taking a risk um you know getting one so early off the production line uh but I'm like I say I

[15:34] was I was pretty cool with that and uh um you know if the game doesn't live up to my expectations I

[15:41] suspect I could turn around and I may lose you know some money off of it or maybe not who knows

[15:47] I'm not sure I actually saw right now I mean and there's a lot of people waiting yeah but honestly

[15:51] I have this game's not leaving the not leaving my house anytime soon I'm really happy with it

[15:56] cool so like let's talk about the gameplay because when I played a tpf and you know maybe it's just

[16:02] mean wide bodies don't really get along uh but did it do you have it set up so it's playing a

[16:09] little you know faster I think it was playing a little slow and flow to a tpf but how do you have

[16:13] your setup is it different than what what was at the show um I mean not not really I leveled it

[16:20] and like I say I've tweaked some of the uh some of the max just so that everything lines up and

[16:27] and shoots the way that it should now I'm gonna defer to Blake really on gameplay because he

[16:32] he just got his first few games in this evening he didn't get a chance to play it at tpf so

[16:38] uh I think it might be interesting to hear his uh initial impressions and I you know I'll be fair

[16:44] because I don't care if you hate it or not. No I told I like Blake you better be objective.

[16:50] This was one of the games I really was looking forward to playing the most at tpf uh because we've

[16:54] been watching the progress on it for so long but I I purposely ended up kind of staying away from

[16:59] it at the show just because I knew that Brad was gonna be taking this one home and I kind of felt

[17:05] like I'd rather have my first impression be of this game in a quiet home use environment rather than

[17:11] you know with a line of people behind me and a whole lot of other noise because it it is a game that

[17:16] they they've hyped up as being a very immersive atmosphere at game and I think that it does end

[17:22] up living up to that in a in a quieter environment. The gameplay is actually a lot of fun. I have to

[17:30] say that this game was more fun to play than I think my impressions from some of the live streams

[17:37] that have been done up to this point have kind of showed. I think there's a lot to be said for playing

[17:42] this thing in a home versus in a bar or at a huge you know show. The the game for a for a wide body

[17:52] there are some shots that if you do not make them cleanly you're gonna hit one of the stand-up

[17:58] posts or something alongside one of the ramps and that's gonna that's going to cause the ball to

[18:04] be a little bit floaty getting back to your flippers and stuff but I will say that the games

[18:08] actually got really great speed to it and I don't think it's as fast as full throttle is because I

[18:15] think it's got more strategic shots than that game does but I think that it's not nearly as

[18:21] floaty as the hobbit is in my opinion. So I think it's it's a pretty good balance. I don't know if

[18:28] feels quite as smooth as like a as a balli Williams wide body like Twilight Zone for example but I

[18:34] think it's a lot better than some of the super pen wide bodies from the 90s like Popeye for example

[18:42] you know so I think I think it's definitely a better game than some other wide bodies out there.

[18:48] There's there's a lot to do on this thing I mean I have to say that if if it hadn't been for Brad

[18:53] kind of walking me through what your your objectives are and what you're supposed to be doing

[18:58] kind of right out the gate when you plunge the ball I think that you don't really know

[19:03] immediately what you're supposed to be doing. Brad's been studying this game for a week every

[19:07] single evening and evening so he's figured out you know what you're supposed to do you know he

[19:13] figured out what the skill shot is and all that kind of stuff and that helps a lot. Basically it's

[19:20] the I kind of I have to I owe I owe Andrew a little bit of an apology for a comment that you

[19:29] and I kind of made on our tpf pre tpf show a few weeks ago talking about the modes and they

[19:36] they do jump around a little bit but in terms of the ladder structure when you see the game in person

[19:41] it does make a little bit more sense once you've selected one of the two films and then how you

[19:46] crawl up that ladder to get through the modes do you stay in do you stay in a film when you select it

[19:53] or do you go back and forth. Yes so that was something that we found out that I think I actually

[19:59] heard somebody say this is the show last weekend that once you select a film you have to play all

[20:05] the way through the ladder and the modes of that film and once you've done that once you've

[20:10] essentially beaten that film then the game will automatically switch you over to the other film.

[20:15] One thing about the modes it's not sequential like it is on ghost fusters you don't always start

[20:21] on the same mode basically the ramp shots alternate the modes so as you hit the ramps the the

[20:28] modal change so there is some strategy sometimes to you know if you want to start a particular

[20:34] mode or if you feel confident about completing a certain mode you might want to hit that one earlier

[20:39] so yeah it's it's not so linear you know it was a little bit more variable as far as how the

[20:49] mode starts. One thing I didn't realize until just having played it was that the

[20:57] by the modes are set up in those inserts in the lower part of the play field basically you've got

[21:02] the first film ladder on the left hand side you've got the second film ladder on the right hand side

[21:08] and then the middle ladder of inserts are actually all of your multi-balls so there are at least like

[21:15] six different multi-ball modes or something like that I think yeah on the game yeah

[21:20] wow and so right right now are you guys able to start how many of the multi-balls can you start do

[21:24] you need the alien head to be functioning to grab some of those multi-balls or no they all function

[21:30] really the alien head not functioning is just cosmetically that it impacts any of the rules or the

[21:35] scoring so more or less everything works. The magnet still grabs the ball like it's supposed to

[21:43] set up multi-ball and then it'll it'll start multi-ball once it releases that from the magnet so

[21:50] yeah it's one of the questions I know we've talked about and you guys might have you might have

[21:55] got a sense from this when you play the game do you feel that both the first film and this second

[22:01] film are sort of you get the equal representation or does it feel more like the second film like

[22:06] what do you feel immersed in both of those films knowing that they kind of both have different

[22:10] aesthetics and sort of vibes going yeah I mean I do it and so I did listen to your podcast where

[22:16] you're talking about that and you you felt like the second game was more represented I mean it

[22:21] depends to me on obviously which one you select and if you're playing the second film that's all

[22:26] you're gonna hear you're gonna hear call outs on the modes and the visuals are all gonna be from

[22:30] the second film for your whole game but if you select the first one you know all the modes and

[22:36] call outs and all the video and everything is from the first film and the music I gotta say the

[22:41] music is very fitting you know the music for the second film is a little more upbeat little more

[22:49] military sounding and whereas the first film the background music for that is all very moody and

[22:56] spooky and a little more dark and speaking of dark there is a couple of there's a mode in there

[23:03] from the first film where you're basically chasing the aliens through the airlock it's really dark

[23:10] I could hear I expect to hear a few people complain about it being so dark you can't see the ball

[23:15] but it's it's dark and it's you hear the heavy breathing you hear the heartbeat and I don't know

[23:21] it's kind of cool though right I mean I think we expected for them to make it an immersive alien

[23:28] game to have some some modes that are that feel like you're sort of in that claustrophobic dark

[23:33] corridor I mean yeah you shouldn't be able to see the ball perfectly it's it's yeah I mean so

[23:39] you know it's fun well wanna you know one of my favorite things about pinball is just the the

[23:44] visual aspect of it everything from whatever's on the monitor to the overall lighting and the artwork

[23:50] on the game and I've got to say that I actually just hit that mode that Brad was talking about on

[23:56] the last game we played and the the lighting on this game is phenomenal it is actually a beautiful

[24:05] beautiful game that that mode that he was talking about it drops all the GI out to this really

[24:11] dark blue basically so you've got a dark blue and you've got just a slight glow of green coming from

[24:17] the pop bumpers and other than the inserts a few inserts that are lit up the rest of the game

[24:23] is pretty much black and it's cool it's really really fun to do it so overall the lighting is

[24:32] absolutely fantastic on this game and like Brad said the the sounds and the sound effects are top

[24:39] notch I mean they they put a lot of love and a lot of detail into all of that kind of stuff on

[24:45] this thing so I will say that while I'll never be a hundred percent satisfied with maybe some

[24:53] of the artwork choices just based on what Eric was able to use for the assets on the game for the

[24:59] playfield art I will say that they have they've definitely captured the essence of the films in

[25:05] terms of the lighting and the sound effects and the music right I know this that's that's really

[25:11] really good to hear because I think that was the big thing for fans of the franchise they really

[25:16] wanted to feel immersed in the worlds that the films brought to life um talk to me guys about screen

[25:23] so you have a screen on the back box right the 26 27 inch 27 yep and then you've got the one

[25:30] on the playfield talk to me about when you guys are playing uh do you guys ever feel like you're

[25:35] looking up or you don't need to because it's there on the playfield what's it like on the highway

[25:38] system with this game I you know it's I don't look up a lot um but I'm kind of like that same

[25:49] way regardless of what game I'm playing I honestly I don't I don't look up a whole time the

[25:54] less there's enough pause in the game for me to feel like I can do without losing my ball

[25:58] pretty much have my eyes glued to the playfield which is why I like you know the playfield LCD I think

[26:03] that's pretty neat if you're going to go to the trouble of having all these graphics and everything

[26:07] you know I like the ability to be able to see him right there without having to look up um that

[26:11] being said I absolutely wanted the big the big screen the big LCD of the back box also

[26:18] there is definitely a cool factor for having that there um even in my house you know people

[26:24] like well if you're not looking up you know why do you have it well I don't always play alone

[26:28] I have friends over and um you know we have you know other people to come over to play football

[26:35] some of you know don't want to just sit around and you know stare at nothing so I think it's

[26:40] pretty cool to have yeah I mean I actually made a comment to write about the LCD just a little

[26:45] while ago after we finished the game and um you know naturally my my instincts playing pinball

[26:53] have always been to look up at least to the speaker panel because that's where the DMD's have been

[26:58] placed for so long and while playing this game I actually don't think I ever really looked up at

[27:04] the big LCD at all I didn't even find myself looking up that in that general direction um because

[27:12] I knew that there was a screen in the play field that you're kind of keeping an eye on anyways

[27:15] and sometimes especially during multi-ball you're not looking at either of them I mean you're honestly

[27:21] you just can't keep your eyes on everything is going on the play field and watch the monitor

[27:27] in either place honestly is how how I'm implemented is the the little screen next to the alien head

[27:34] to the left is that utilize a lot so as probably most everybody knows that was a very late edition

[27:41] um I think it came out of the feedback from the previous expo that they weren't happy with the

[27:46] queen and the joker can and so they replaced it with the LCD there's not a ton of content on it

[27:51] right now um there's a few little screens every time the eject scoop goes off and there's also

[28:01] in a lot of the modes I don't know if it's in all of them but I've seen in most of the modes there

[28:06] is a mode timer on that screen that's not reflected on the big screen that shows you the time of the

[28:13] modes I do know you know one of the neat things about being so early in the game is having the

[28:19] contact with the alien team and like I say the guy that works on the audio um he sent me a couple of

[28:30] PM exchanges but basically they're saying that you know they're going to have some some updates coming

[28:35] out in the next couple of months that basically will be tuning and refinement and then a big audio

[28:44] video update sometime around June timeframe I think they're looking at so uh it's neat so I know it's

[28:52] you know if I'm happy and and pretty pleased with what I'm seeing now you know I'm optimistic that

[28:59] it'll get a little better and so I'm cool that and and by the way there were uh when Brad check

[29:06] the audits on the game looked like on this particular machine out of the three that were at the show

[29:11] there were about 400 plays on this machine over the year so over the course of the weekend last

[29:16] weekend I got like 880 plays on my magic girl the first time I've played it so I'm not even you know

[29:24] screw you guys um well that's that's really cool so it's it's it's from what I've heard too like

[29:31] from the most part a lot of the game is there out of the box in terms of code which is good right

[29:37] this isn't going to be like a libousky or like a stern Batman right where people get it and they're

[29:42] like what you know like where's half the game it sounds like a lot is in there right now

[29:48] yeah I think so I like to say I've been playing it pretty nonstop for the past week um

[29:53] I have completing modes is hard and you know um they set up some pretty challenging modes for you

[30:00] I'm okay with that you know I don't want to beat the game in the first week I have it um I have

[30:05] seen I have gone through where I've seen I had a game I broke a hundred million on and I it went

[30:10] through all the modes in one movie and started another and I think I saw four or five out of six

[30:16] multi-balls um I did go into menu and set the multi-balls to be a little bit easier to achieve

[30:24] um just because I like to see the game right so uh yeah okay so um I'm trying to think so okay

[30:33] so we we there's some good code out of the box what's the most satisfying shot that both you

[30:39] guys are having right now with the game if you were to pick one shot that you're like you know

[30:43] manages feels good every time I hit that shot which one is it for me that's the right ramp

[30:50] it's uh it's one of those loopback shots it just loops back real quick and comes right back

[30:55] down the ramp I've got that one dialed in pretty good it feels pretty good every time you hit it

[31:00] yeah I think that the uh the ramp shots are definitely the most satisfying so far um only because

[31:06] the the right ramp is the easiest of the three to hit um the two left ramps even the one that

[31:13] that's up in the front surprisingly it's it's not as easy to hit as it looks like even though there's

[31:19] nothing in front of it um it's the sweet spot on the flipper that you have to get to to make that shot

[31:28] is not in a place that you think it's really in when you're watching the ball travel down and you're

[31:34] you know you've got your hand-eye coordination synced up with that so um I think that definitely

[31:40] once you get used to it then it'll be great but it's um there's a little bit of learning curve to

[31:46] that and um I will say that the orbit shot feels really good on it uh it it really whips the ball

[31:52] all the way around the game very quickly um I even found myself forgetting a couple times that I

[31:59] had four flippers on this machine that I you know that I had a flipper way over in the far left and

[32:04] I the one that's that's kind of up in the middle of the play field on the right uh it almost you kind

[32:11] of visually think that it looks like a wall sometimes for the ball to travel down and you kind of

[32:16] forget that you've got a flipper there but but it's crucial for hitting um the back left ramp which

[32:23] is equivalent to like the warp ramp on Star Trek right do you got you guys feel like you're using

[32:29] those other two flippers a lot of there are a lot of shots dedicated to those those other flippers

[32:34] I did yeah there is in fact there's a the multi ball that is that is dedicated to that back ramp

[32:42] that back left ramp that you can only hit from the upper right flipper you know basically if you

[32:48] drop your dropped targets that's what lights the lock for that ramp and if you hit that a couple times

[32:54] then it starts a multi ball yeah this this game is not like the hobbit where you just got this third

[32:59] flipper that does everything that the lower right flipper can also do you know uh there there

[33:06] definitely shots with that flipper that you have to to use the upper one for gotcha some of the

[33:12] videos I saw the game did look pretty brutal so talk to me about how hard it is what's the

[33:18] difficulty are there any like that left out lanes seem pretty nasty when I was watching a lot of

[33:22] videos so what's uh what's uh what you'll take on the difficulty level right now as it's set up

[33:28] well uh for me I would say it is but it's pretty difficult it's pretty brutal game um and maybe

[33:35] because I'm not drinking tonight I don't know but my game is a little off Blake came and schooled me

[33:42] uh so I haven't really shown my skills on it's line but I've got it dialed in once you get those

[33:47] shots dialed in you know I I've hit four or five way combos um and that's that's pretty rewarding

[33:54] the game the game's hard Chris I mean it's it's not a piece of cake it's it's a game that for people

[34:00] that are gonna have this in their home um I don't think you'll get tired of it that quickly because

[34:07] you're not gonna see a ton of this game unless you're having a really good game so it's kind of

[34:11] like Ghostbusters in that regard you know um it you know the it does kind of punish you if you

[34:19] don't make the shots cleanly if you break the shots on some of the the standup posts and whatnot

[34:26] um then that's gonna be a disadvantage um there's a really good reason why they put the center

[34:32] posts in the game I mean there were a couple of shots that I totally lost down the middle but the

[34:37] center post saved them um in regards to the outlines uh yeah they they can be kind of brutal but

[34:44] I will say that the game has got some really forgiving ball saves on it so there were a couple of

[34:50] times where I had assumed that the ball save timer was out and I got a ball anyways again when I

[34:56] drained it yeah and there's that revive that little kick out on the left lane that's a kind of

[35:00] little like you said a little mini nudge game or whatever if you try to get it to go down one

[35:04] way or the other um and it revives the ball that way um of course one of the first things I did

[35:10] Chris when I got the game home was to tighten up damn outlines of course I do that with every game I

[35:14] buy right right now I'm not that great a pinball player I need all the help I can do yeah don't let

[35:20] him fool you he's actually one of the better guys in our league so yeah he's a good player and

[35:25] but you know I think that that's all the more reason you know it's a challenging game for

[35:30] people that are still really good and you know you feel like you'll get your money's worth out of

[35:34] it more I suppose yeah I mean like I think it's finding that balance right between the long ball time

[35:40] and then just like the drain monster and I think for for anyone who has friends coming over and

[35:46] wants to you know kind of have a game that they go back to frequently the harder the better you know

[35:52] I think these long ball time games and they get too long yep you don't want to watch someone have

[35:57] a 20 minute ball at a time you know I just can't do it like never had that problem tonight

[36:02] well I mean no I mean I had okay games you know just learning it uh I really don't know what all

[36:10] I was doing and I was just trying to hit flashing socks like you're supposed to do open ball nowadays but

[36:15] but I mean um yeah if if the ball saves were not quite as generous and if things like that center

[36:22] pose had not been there oh my ball times would have been incredibly short honestly I mean it it

[36:29] it's a hard game it's not easy um but they put those things in there wisely you know because

[36:37] they knew that they had designed a pretty difficult game so this is something that at least

[36:41] gives people a chance right so as I know you guys are both fans of the franchise as fans is each of

[36:48] you um what's one thing you you would have added to the game if you had total just creative control

[36:54] and you were making it wow that's a good question you know I I don't know I hadn't really uh I mean

[37:04] I could I don't know that I would dress it up and make it more gig orish maybe right you know

[37:10] I I would I would I mean that I've said this before um I think the overall layout of the game

[37:17] is fantastic I think the light show and the way they incorporated the clips from the film and then

[37:24] the way that they they aged the clips from the film to make or or all the new animations to make them

[37:29] look you know late 70s early 80s and I think that was all fantastic that was a home run in my opinion

[37:36] I think that if there was anything that I would want to to add or adjust on this game it would be

[37:42] to definitely add more of the HR Geeger style the the biomechanical design into the game you know

[37:49] that to me by far that's the thing that's missing the most from this game and honestly that

[37:55] that's even aside from the game not having Ripley in it I mean I feel like that if you're

[38:00] gonna do a game without Ripley um then I think that's all the more reason to to do more of the

[38:07] Geeger style artwork right did you guys was she at absence for you guys as you were playing without

[38:14] her in it I haven't I haven't felt it I think there's enough callouts from the movie that you know

[38:20] you feel like you're getting pretty good quantity of that I is she I mean but she doesn't have

[38:26] she doesn't have callouts right there's there's a shit ton of callouts from Ripley from Ripley or from

[38:33] no no no okay yeah yeah okay just run the clarify um my point was though there was enough you know

[38:41] from the movie I don't hear the same thing over and over again right yeah there there's no

[38:46] mistaking this as an alien game it is clearly an alien game from the movies and while Ripley

[38:54] you know is is definitely missed in this game I guess you could say because you would feel like a

[39:01] definitive alien game would have Ripley in it at the same time all the other elements that are

[39:08] that make the first two films what they are they're all present in this game yeah you still have

[39:14] the loader battle which is you know one of the wizard modes from the second movie and I think they

[39:23] they talk about doing a good job creatively of kind of having that in there without having her

[39:28] in it and how they kind of win around doing that unfortunately just can't use the most famous

[39:33] line from that movie yeah right right right the final line um so if I could if I could add something

[39:42] I would just add more toys you know there's so many cool like the power loader you've got that like

[39:46] armor truck that they had these something I would I just the power loaders would be perfect where

[39:52] you could like if you can magnetize the balls in each arm and like lifts it up and that like

[39:56] drops into multiple like stuff like I just wish I saw more toys on it but again I think a lot of

[40:02] guys who who will start modding this thing out will start adding some of those elements onto the game

[40:08] well I've got to say the head is actually probably my favorite aspect of this of this game

[40:15] even though even though it's not currently working on this particular machine because of the board

[40:21] it just looks freaking cool and it's huge it's it's you don't realize how how large it is in the game

[40:28] until you see it in person especially see it from the side and everything I think that's going to be

[40:33] a real shining feature of this game once it's up to its full potential you know yeah they talked

[40:40] about um I talked with Andrew about this at the show some of the enhancements that that they

[40:45] are still looking at they're gonna potentially add in strobe lighting and he's talking about

[40:52] having even another board on the back that that has that lighting so they can have strobe effects

[40:57] on the Xeno when it eats the ball and he's talking about potentially also still having something

[41:02] with the queen on the left having some motorized mech or something that pops the queen up at some

[41:09] point in time or something he may be this may be all be pipe greens but I do think that they

[41:14] are gonna add some code definitely to punch up the the biggest toy on the game

[41:21] so I'm taking you guys like it which is good so I think as people listen to this podcast who are

[41:26] in on alien this is all really exciting feedback for them now the question that's burning

[41:33] in everyone's minds is just basically like when do you think people are gonna get this game because

[41:39] it sounds like this is still that that beta out there sort of in test mode and Andrew's still

[41:46] talking about making changes in where it April and 2017 like do you think it's going to be pencils

[41:52] down sooner or like another month of sort of tweaking this thing like what what kind of sense do you

[41:56] get with when's this thing going to be like all right we're done because we all know production

[42:01] doesn't begin until all this sort of beta testing is finished yeah I got the sense that they

[42:11] are at the point where they're you know early production machines are rolling off

[42:15] and I now are those beta but are those beta units those are still beta games all right I mean it's

[42:21] not like at some point you know like every manufacturer has to hit a point where like this is like

[42:28] final production like on the line final production begins on this date right so these are still like

[42:33] the early pre-production all right you know I don't know I'm not sure it's kind of hard to quantify

[42:41] I think that if it had that that one Zeno board in it I think it would have most everything you

[42:49] know yeah they're talking about out beneath add this or add that I mean maybe they'll do that

[42:54] as an add-on maybe they'll just offer that as you know hey if you want to buy the extra lighting

[42:58] kit you know we'll put the code in for it if you want to you know pay for this kid I mean I

[43:02] I have no idea did he did he give you any did he talk it all about you know when he felt

[43:10] more that stuff would be available or is it sort of just like we're waiting on it like any day

[43:14] now kind of stuff I got the impression it was any day now when I asked him you know he said he's

[43:20] sending the board and I said well I might be waiting weeks or months it goes on and I'll get it

[43:24] to you within within a week or so okay so I you know again he's famous for throwing out two weeks

[43:31] so we'll see we'll see I'll let you know if I get my board or not I mean I feel like that as

[43:37] the game sits in here right now you know next to a beautiful metallic a premium I think if you

[43:45] got that Xeno board in the game and that mech worked it's I think the game could ship right now

[43:52] as it is and feel like a quite a complete game the coding is really far along in this game actually

[44:00] I think that it's it's got a lot more to it in terms of where the modes are and what you can get

[44:05] the game to do even more so than some stern set of shipped you know new in box so I applaud them for

[44:14] that I do think that yeah you can't be shipping people's games and the Xeno head not work that's

[44:22] that's the main toy of the game now Brad knew what he was he knew what he was getting from the show

[44:27] and he knew that that was something that they were going to have to to tag up with him on after

[44:33] so is what you guys are saying that board issues is the delay now I'm just this time it's this time it's

[44:40] real right this time that's a that's a different board Chris come on okay all right I feel like

[44:46] every other week I hear it's a board issue from these guys but these guys it the actual board issue so

[44:52] but Andrew's been honest about that about how the Chinese New Year and they got delayed on

[44:56] on the boards and they've been waiting on that stuff so look it sounds like we don't we can all

[45:01] speculate right I mean I don't want I think there's no there's no point in trying to figure it out

[45:05] these guys they want to get games out as fast as possible so it sounds like it's worth the wait

[45:12] and I think that's the big takeaway people have that are listening to this that are hearing from you

[45:16] guys that it's fun it's immersive and it's for the price it's a hell of a package I mean I keep saying

[45:24] I mean Andrew keeps throwing stuff into the standard I mean do you even need an LE you know I think

[45:30] the game look great when I saw it I don't I don't think that EL blades were even originally

[45:36] supposed to be in the standard games when they first announced them I think that kind of got thrown

[45:42] in there's no there's no there's no yellow blade type aesthetic in alien it's such a tron move

[45:49] that everyone keeps moving over to other games I know it makes the ramps look cool but just that's not

[45:55] alien it's not aliens just ship it it looks it looks cool though I'm not talking about the the

[46:01] EL lighting on ramps I'm talking about the EL blades on the side of the decals that are

[46:07] lighted yeah those yeah those are those are cool those see but that's why I looked at those I'm like

[46:13] man that should have just been your Ellie upgrade they're cool they're cool they're cool

[46:19] like that's cool than anything Stern's ever put in is cool than Mirrorblade so I think Andrew

[46:25] you know it pencils down soon right it's like the from what you guys are saying like just get that

[46:30] Zeno head work in and you're gonna have a lot of people happy you know we don't need to keep tweaking it

[46:35] so I think it's I think it's to me I'm more than happy with game I'm thrilled to have it the the

[46:42] light show and sounds just honestly blows away anything I've seen yeah like I said it's some of

[46:49] the coolest lighting I've ever seen in a game before and I've got to say that you know if you

[46:54] want to kind of compare this to anything this games had kind of a long road of development like

[47:00] the hobbit did they're both wide body games they both had a lot of hype they both were said to

[47:06] have some really cool toys and mex in them and I think that this game when it gets into the hands

[47:12] of the people that have been waiting for two plus years for it I think they're gonna be a lot

[47:16] more satisfied with the game then maybe how some of the people felt once they finally got the hobbit

[47:22] and and I don't mean that to be a knock on JJP because probably my favorite game from the entire

[47:29] Texas pinball festival last weekend was dialed in and I think they hit a home run with it but I

[47:33] think that I mean Blake it's okay to it's okay to knock the hobbit on this on this podcast

[47:38] I mean that's all it's all I've ever done it's all right man yeah no I know it can be better than

[47:45] the hobbit that's not look that's not saying much in some circles yeah I think that in a nut shell

[47:53] I think owners that have been waiting a long time for this game are probably going to be very

[47:57] pleased with it when they get their hands on it good Brad it sounds like you love it I mean I've

[48:02] been reading your post on pinside it sounds like you're enjoying it I'm really glad that it's in

[48:08] in the home environment I think that is where these games shine I you know coming at a TPS I was

[48:14] like man everything you're kind of just like annoyed by there's all the lights and sounds after a

[48:19] while that every game to sort of underwhelms at these shows which is why I don't even I don't even

[48:24] think like to be honest the show floor is a good place at all to get customers I don't they should

[48:33] the alien should have been in a dark room you know blacked out the windows and Andrew should have

[48:40] had people come through there one by one to truly experience it yeah that would be cool honestly

[48:46] I think if they had more time just to set up and and get the games dialed in too they might have

[48:50] gotten a better session but that being said I do know that there were people that approached Andrew

[48:55] at tpf asking to buy the games and and they had to kind of say that they were already spoken for yeah

[49:01] no look you got lucky Brad I mean hold on to it because you know like if stuff doesn't work out

[49:06] we have to say this if they don't get production going and then just stalls and stalls and stalls

[49:11] you might have something rare than magic growing your hands so it's it's just a no lose for you my

[49:17] friend and no lose situation well I am very thrilled to have a game and I have had a pretty fun

[49:23] week playing it as my wife can attest I've pretty much been able to talk about nothing else so

[49:28] it's been fun all right well we want to make you save the marriage and we'll end the podcast

[49:34] on that note that it's a great game we hope people get it soon so Brad we will we will check in

[49:39] with you especially want to hear when you you know how long it takes to get the boards and so we'll

[49:44] we'll stay in touch and yeah congratulations on scoring one of the only aliens in the universe

[49:52] on planet earth in the pinball world so Brad and Blake thank you for your time thank you Chris

[49:58] all right thanks Chris go drink some beers I'm gonna I'm gonna go pass out

[50:04] all right guys all right thanks
