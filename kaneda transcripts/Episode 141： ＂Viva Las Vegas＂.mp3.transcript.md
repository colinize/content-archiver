[00:00] I'm pretty women, we're nothing

[00:03] They're all living and they will make care

[00:06] And I'm just a deal with love and space

[00:09] So people lost their kids

[00:13] People lost their kids

[00:23] Whenever I get back from Las Vegas

[00:25] I always feel like I need another vacation

[00:27] Immediately after to sort of transition

[00:29] He back into the real world

[00:31] There's something about Vegas

[00:33] That disrupts your entire outlook on life

[00:36] It pulls at your moral compass in a way that no

[00:40] Their city does

[00:42] But I love it too

[00:44] I love it because in Las Vegas

[00:46] It's like this place where everyone there

[00:48] Is there to have a good time

[00:50] People are there to look good, people are there to eat

[00:52] Good food, people are there to try and win some money

[00:55] And as long as you can get out of that city

[00:58] Without doing anything you'll really regret

[01:01] I think you'll love it

[01:03] And so I won a few hundred bucks

[01:05] Had some great meals, had some good poolside parties

[01:08] Some good late night sort of entertainment

[01:11] No, I didn't go to strip club dreams, things like that

[01:14] I'm not really into that scene

[01:16] But I'm back

[01:18] I took a red eye, it was really bumpy

[01:20] And I've just been catching up on what's been going on in the pinball world

[01:23] And we're going to just go into that on episode 141 of Canadian Pinball Podcast

[01:28] And we have to start out with Fantastic

[01:31] Unfortunately I couldn't do my Vegas trip and go to Fantastic

[01:35] And I do miss going to shows

[01:38] Especially the ones that are local that I can drive to

[01:41] And from the looks of it

[01:43] Gabe put on an amazing show up at Fantastic

[01:46] So we want to congratulate Gabe on doing it

[01:48] This is a venture that he's taken on his shoulders

[01:52] With the help of people around him

[01:54] But he made this show happen

[01:55] There really was no Northeast show this time of year going on

[01:59] And Gabe provides that

[02:01] And I was happy to see that he also was able to secure

[02:04] A Star Wars and a dialed in

[02:06] A couple dialed in for his show

[02:08] Because the big pinball machine

[02:10] Everybody wants to jump on right now

[02:12] Is Star Wars

[02:13] And we're going to talk about Star Wars

[02:15] We're going to talk about some of the video footage I've seen

[02:17] And we're going to talk about some of the feedback that I've been reading

[02:20] From pinside people who have played the game

[02:23] Because now it's no longer

[02:25] Something to be judged on artwork alone

[02:29] We can actually get people's experiences with the machine

[02:33] And I want to start off by mentioning one thing

[02:39] If you went to the VIP part of Gabe's show

[02:45] And you took more than one slice of pizza

[02:49] And you loaded all of the buffalo wings onto your plate

[02:53] So that most of the people that came at 10 o'clock at night

[02:57] Had to go without food

[02:59] You should be ashamed of yourself

[03:01] And you know who you are

[03:03] People were pinball fans

[03:06] Not pigs

[03:07] Do not hog the food at these vents

[03:11] And we know that oftentimes people will give out free pizza and free food

[03:14] To get people into a room

[03:16] And to have fun for the night

[03:18] I couldn't believe it when I was going to the fantastic thread

[03:21] When I was reading about the selfishness and the gluttony of some of you out there

[03:27] I mean really

[03:28] And then Gabe had to order even more pizza

[03:31] And those people were going back at the pizza that came afterwards

[03:35] And this one he's coming out of Gabe's pocket too

[03:39] You know he's doing this as part of a treat for those who are paying more for the VIP package

[03:45] But when he has to go and order tons more food because of greed

[03:49] I just want to say you guys you know who you are

[03:53] You probably know someone who did what the you know who loaded their plate up

[03:57] This is what I'm called for

[03:59] Come on

[04:00] Alright let's talk about Star Wars

[04:02] Because I've seen some video footage of Star Wars

[04:04] And I don't want to go too much into like reading people's paragraph emails about whether or not they like the game or not

[04:11] The way I want to approach this right now is I think what we're seeing here is what we always see when a new pinball machine comes out

[04:19] Right so we have this moment where you have people that are fans of the game

[04:24] And you have people who don't like the game

[04:26] And this isn't a game that I think is going to be universally just loved right away

[04:31] And and the reason why I say that is it has things that people have issues with

[04:38] And the things that people have issues with are the fact that it's a pretty barren play field

[04:44] These are the things I read that it's the games it's really fast but it's also really brutal

[04:49] I was listening to Nate Chivers interview Josh Sharp on his podcast on his last episode

[04:57] And Josh played this game a lot because Josh was with Jack Danger in Stern's factory doing the dead flip video of Star Wars

[05:04] And Josh said it is like this game is it's really confusing to understand what's going on in the game

[05:12] You got to pick your character then you got to pick your skill shot then you got to pick what you're going for

[05:16] And he basically believes that pinball machines have become far too confusing for people to just jump on and understand what's going on in the game

[05:28] So I think when I read about people's knocks against Star Wars a lot of it's coming down to the fact that with the implementation of the LCD screen

[05:38] The games are getting too complex and Stern just is is letting these games become really complex

[05:45] Now the flip side of that argument is that these are home use only products and people who buy them further homes really want deep code

[05:53] And those people don't have a problem really learning the nuances of the game and the complexity of the code

[06:01] So for a home use guy he actually craves that the deeper the better

[06:06] So that's the balance that I think is really hard because I think for most people you do want to just jump on a pinball machine

[06:14] And love it pretty immediately and then love it even more when you explore the depths of the code

[06:23] So there's that part of it

[06:26] Now I saw a lot of people say Steve Rich the king is back I saw a lot of people talk about how fast the game is

[06:34] How it's just so many quick shots that return the ball to the flipper very quickly

[06:40] The music is great the sound on the new Stern spike system is phenomenal there's no denying the fact that the sound in this game is cool

[06:48] The call outs are cool

[06:50] You know it's a Steve Rich game and I've said it and it's like the thought really an opinion or an observation

[06:58] Right it's just a fact like that's this is how Steve likes to make his games he should change his name to speed richy

[07:05] Not Steve Richy because he really likes to make these really really fast games

[07:09] So I haven't played it and until I play it I can't really give you much more of my opinion of the game

[07:18] Other than the opinions that I've given on the game which I still do think it looks barren

[07:23] I still don't believe that that game captures the magic of the Star Wars universe for me

[07:30] It doesn't mean it's not a good pinball machine it doesn't mean you're not gonna have fun playing that pinball machine

[07:36] I do wish people would allow people who love the machine to just love it

[07:42] Like if someone says I played it and I think it's great and someone says I played it and I think it's meh

[07:48] That's cool like I totally respect people having an opinion about the game

[07:54] If someone wants to spend their hard-earned money on Star Wars and sees the value in a $9,000 LE or $7,300 premium

[08:05] That's their prerogative I fully expect these games to sell because of the theme

[08:11] I don't personally see the value there so I won't be buying one right now

[08:15] I'm not in the market for Star Wars I even though I haven't flipped it from what I see there

[08:22] I can tell that speed is not gonna win me over

[08:26] I just don't see the ball doing anything that seems to be that magical

[08:32] And I just don't see the world of Star Wars coming to life but look let's also be honest here

[08:38] Nobody really gives them about the pro

[08:42] I think we all could agree that the pro for Star Wars is an operator's wet dream

[08:48] It is very barren, it is very like sort of sparse

[08:53] But probably on purpose because now there's less stuff to break

[08:56] There's less stuff for a start to put in the game

[08:59] And they can sell it at a low price and get casual people who just want a new pinball machine for their game rooms

[09:07] When they go into a distributor's warehouse or into their showroom

[09:13] And they see Star Wars and they love Star Wars and it's $50, $300

[09:17] And that's a great win win right?

[09:19] It's a win win for operators who want to put the game on location as well

[09:22] Because people will put dollar bills into Star Wars pro just as quickly as they would if it was a premium or an LE

[09:30] And there's just much less to break and there's much less operating costs associated with the pro

[09:35] But no one nobody, none of us, none of us like fanatics who actually spend more than an hour a year thinking about pinball

[09:45] None of us guys who really want to see this game and actually care about the pro

[09:51] I mean we really want to see what that hyper drive is all about

[09:54] We want to see what that ramp that pops up that destroys the Death Star is all about

[09:58] We want to see how the Death Star opening up, how that really functions

[10:02] Those are the things that are of most intros

[10:05] I mean I really can't wait to see the balls getting into the hyper drive and zipping around and around and around

[10:10] Now I've had a lot of you reach out to me

[10:13] I get fans on both sides of the fence

[10:16] I get people who hit me up and say Chris the game is cheap and Stern is just pulling a fast one

[10:22] And this is just the cash grab error pinball

[10:25] And then I get guys like my friend Mr. Ed Robertson that I'm going to call you out

[10:30] Who's just like this game is going to be great, this game is going to be great

[10:33] Stern is on a roll and they know how to make really great pinball machines

[10:37] He's like Batman's going to be great, Lyman's going to knock that out of the park

[10:41] You give these games time and Stern will ultimately deliver the best pinball experience for people

[10:49] And look I used to be a lot more strident and angry and like how could they do this

[10:56] But look it's your money and that's the other thing with like Vegas

[10:59] I have to be honest when I was at Vegas

[11:02] There was a moment when I was at a craps table and there was an older gentleman there with a woman who was about a third of his age

[11:09] Playing craps and I just looked down at his chips

[11:12] And he probably had about 20,000 dollars in chips

[11:15] Just like Cavalier throwing chips down betting on numbers, what not, roll in the die

[11:20] And I just thought to myself this is one dude in this casino with thousands of people drinking, partying, gambling

[11:28] If this guy was in the pinball, what is 80, 300 dollars, 84 dollars for Star Wars meaning this guy

[11:34] He's going to win that or lose that in the next hour here

[11:38] And he's having fun, he's having fun

[11:41] And so much of what I'm trying to just extract from my life and my experience with pinball

[11:48] Is all the stupid negativity that people bring when they just have a lot of angry opinions about these games

[11:56] So it's just like don't buy it, like nobody is forcing anyone to buy Star Wars

[12:01] So I won't buy Star Wars, now look that doesn't mean I won't buy it one day if it's great

[12:05] If Batman 66 all of a sudden becomes great one day, I'd be in the market for one

[12:11] You know I'm not just only artwork and that's all that matters to me, that's not how I look at this hobby

[12:17] I do though, I do think a lot of people, I think a lot of you out there are starting to look at your collections

[12:23] And tally them up and the number that is coming back at you is probably starting to scare some of you

[12:30] I saw Iceman tallyed up this collection and it was something like $42,000 or $47,000

[12:37] He's put into pinball machines recently

[12:40] So there comes a point when you start to look at the totality of your investment in it

[12:45] And people will just have to ask themselves, am I getting that much pleasure from these games

[12:51] Or could I be doing this differently?

[12:54] For some people out there, $50,000 means absolutely nothing

[12:58] For others out there, that's the cost of their house

[13:02] And that's what you need to get about pinball is that you really do get people on both sides of the socio-economic ladder

[13:10] Who love pinball because it used to be accessible to all

[13:16] And it still isn't a way, you know

[13:19] You love cars, but for our eyes aren't like accessible to all

[13:23] Like I can't go out and have an amazing car experience on location without paying a lot of money

[13:32] But pinball, you can play the best pinball machine of all time for a dollar

[13:36] So just don't forget that

[13:39] Alright, so we've seen more and more Star Wars footage

[13:42] We're going to obviously see a lot more because people have taken some of these games home

[13:46] That's exciting too, I mean we can officially say that Stern's Star Wars is shipping

[13:52] The question of when the premiums and the LEDs are going to ship is on a lot of people's minds

[13:58] And what I was told is we're going to see those in August, September

[14:03] More, I was also told more likely September for the early owners

[14:09] So good news, right?

[14:11] That means you can just take some time off this summer

[14:14] And not go crazy, not fight with people on the forums, and just wait for it to come out

[14:19] I'm sure we'll see gameplay footage with Jack Danger when they're ready to play the game

[14:24] The code is not done, the code is still, I think 0.60 code, so there's still a lot to be done

[14:30] When you see Star Wars and you see certain modes have gray, they're grayed out

[14:36] That's because those codes aren't coded in yet, but they will be

[14:40] So there's placeholders there for them

[14:43] My final point on Star Wars, I just, I tried it down some notes

[14:47] I don't understand why this scoring though on these new Stern's goes into hundreds of billions of points

[14:55] I think it's stupid

[14:57] I think it's a bad decision for one reason and one reason only

[15:00] I think it looks terrible on the LCD screen when the points start to get like 9-10 digits long

[15:06] Absolutely terrible looking, hard to read, hard to know

[15:09] It's really hard to know like who's ahead, who's not when you start to get these like multipliers

[15:14] And these crazy, crazy, crazy scores

[15:16] Why can't Stern just make the points more balanced and lower the scores?

[15:23] Is it, is it like a logical that someone just thinks, oh I plunged, it hit a pop bumper

[15:28] And then it drained and I have 10 million already

[15:31] I don't get why they use these big scores

[15:35] So that's just something I would change as they move this game forward

[15:39] It's just weird decision on Stern's part

[15:42] Alright, what else is going on in the world?

[15:46] So I want to congratulate and I want to read what they wrote

[15:49] I want to congratulate the investor group at Highway Pimble

[15:54] We haven't heard from the new owners over there

[15:57] We've had some fun at their expense we have

[16:01] But when someone does something right and when someone makes a good decision

[16:06] We will applaud them on this podcast

[16:09] This is, you know, Canada's mind is not 100% made up on anybody

[16:13] On any manufacturer, on any individual in the hobby

[16:17] I think I give people enough of the benefit of the doubt

[16:21] But there was a lot, a lot of doubt with these new highway owners when they took over the reins

[16:26] But I want to read what they wrote on Facebook

[16:29] This is from a day ago

[16:32] They wrote, there has been a long silence from us here due to the change of ownership

[16:36] But we are happy to announce that we are in the final phase of the transition

[16:41] And we are now able to focus more or less entirely on the way forward

[16:45] A lot of work has been done during the past weeks to prepare for the big step up

[16:50] In the manufacturing of games, while we have in fact been building games all the time

[16:56] It has so far been at a slow rate

[17:00] The picture was taken in Friday areas

[17:02] So they have a picture here of some alien machines

[17:04] One, two, three, four

[17:07] It looks like five, maybe six machines with their legs on

[17:11] And it looks like they are pretty much final machines

[17:16] They wrote, in the meantime we would like to thank everyone that is patiently waiting for their games to be shipped

[17:22] As soon as we can, we will reach out and let you know when you should expect your games to be ready

[17:28] To those of you who have asked for refund, most should have been contacted by now

[17:33] And of those who have, many have received their refund already

[17:37] Some are still to be contacted, however, to have your situation...

[17:42] Some still have to be contacted, have their situation sorted

[17:46] And they go on to say that it's just taken a little bit longer because money had to be moved around in different ways

[17:51] From how Andrew had things set up, they gave their email, they gave their phone number

[17:55] And then they say in general it has been exceptionally hectic during the transition period as you would expect

[18:01] While trying our very best to respond to all of you who have contacted us

[18:06] We may have failed to get back to each and everyone

[18:09] But if you have an unanswered email, please send it again since it is possible that your email has simply got lost

[18:15] And the sheer amounts of emails received in the past weeks

[18:18] We also want to thank our distributors who are showing great patience and understanding, believing in the potential and quality of our product and us

[18:26] Alright, I think they said somewhere when we might be able to see games ship

[18:33] But I'm not sure if that was in this note

[18:36] But here's the thing, I want to say that this is great news

[18:40] And that people... I've seen people post that they got their refunds, which is great news

[18:45] It's great news that these new investors are being transparent and speaking with actions not just words

[18:53] People physically got their money and that's the most important thing

[18:57] People have been waiting for years for their games and some people are just fed up and wanted out

[19:03] And I think it's the smart move always to get your money refunded

[19:07] If these guys get everything together and start shipping alien in mass quantities

[19:11] Then you'll easily be able to go buy one

[19:13] Remember, the fear of missing out on an alien alien is not a real fear

[19:18] The game itself, the standard game itself is all you really need

[19:22] So this is good news

[19:24] I know that I've probably been the harshest critic of Andrew Highway, of how he ran Highway Pimball

[19:32] And I like what these guys are doing

[19:36] I'm getting more bullish on their ability to turn this thing around

[19:41] And I think a lot of people are going to start to feel the same way

[19:45] Now, with that being said, I do think that by the time they get everything sorted out

[19:53] I still don't think alien Pimball is this great amazing game

[19:57] Bubba is barking at me, maybe Bubba is in on an alien alien

[20:01] Bubba, what's up?

[20:02] So I just don't know, I'm still not so that alien alien or alien is like this amazing game

[20:08] I think it's okay

[20:11] And we haven't seen many people get it, we haven't seen many people played in their homes

[20:16] Remember only about what, like 20 have gone out

[20:20] And those 20 people who have it, they sort of have all...

[20:25] I'm trying to choose my words here

[20:28] They all have in a way not bragged

[20:33] But yeah, but like it's been like a little bit of a show off item for them

[20:36] Like look what I've got, no one else has got one

[20:39] And most of those people really worked sweetheart deals with Andrew

[20:44] So they also didn't want to say anything negative about the game

[20:49] Because they were afraid that they wouldn't get parts

[20:52] They couldn't get replacement Zeno heads, they couldn't really be honest about their opinions of the game

[20:56] So I still don't think we've ever had a really objective and fair sort of home use only assessment of alien pimbal

[21:06] And it looks like that's going to happen soon

[21:09] Alright, so again, I'm glad to see people getting their money back

[21:13] Bubba's like all over me right now, you miss when you miss your daddy?

[21:16] Bubba, you send these bulldogs, like they just get in heat, I have to hit pause, I gotta settle him down, hold on, I'll be back

[21:21] And we're back, you know, bulldogs are a cuddly amazing dog, but they also are strong

[21:27] I mean when Bubba puts his 55 pounds on top of you and wants something from you

[21:32] Remember these dogs were engineered to fight bulls back in the day, it was a brutal sport

[21:37] They would attach bulldogs to a wounded bull and they would bet money to see which dog would survive

[21:41] So he's still got in it, the fighting spirit

[21:44] Alright, what else is going on?

[21:46] So we were just talking about alien

[21:49] Let's talk about Dutch pimbal

[21:52] So the latest news every Friday, Dutch has promised us some updates and I want to read their update that occurred on Friday

[22:00] So here it is, word for word, Dutch pimbal's latest update, they wrote

[22:05] Alright, here is your weekly update about the production status of the Big Lebowski pimbal

[22:11] Last week we informed you about our new contract manufacturer, which a lot of you were very happy about

[22:16] And we too, this week we have news about Universal

[22:20] One of the elements in the license from Universal is that Universal has to approve the manufacturer who will build the games

[22:28] We therefore submitted the license manufacturer's survey

[22:32] Good news, Universal approved everything so we have a green light to proceed

[22:38] Universal also gave us extra time to produce the Big Lebowski's so things are looking very positive

[22:44] We will now start ordering parts for a zero series engineering samples

[22:49] So we can start building the Big Lebowski's again

[22:52] Our goal is to have the Mimis O's series ready in October 2017 after which we hope to start the regular production

[23:01] We are very grateful for Universal's flexibility and also for your continuous support

[23:06] Thank you so much

[23:08] Have a great weekend, kind regards, Barry and yeah

[23:11] So that's what they wrote

[23:13] What are my thoughts? I think that it's always been sort of a debated about when a company will lose the ability to make a game

[23:24] Because the licensing agreement expires and then we usually hear it's like a three-year period

[23:28] And there's also a lot of speculation that Universal would pull the plug on the license after witnessing all of this debacle unfold

[23:36] And that's not the case

[23:38] And I think people under they don't realize how small a pinball license really is with some of these major properties

[23:46] It's not a lot of money

[23:48] And getting the license and the agreement together for these machines

[23:53] The licenseer tends to want to have people license their product

[23:59] And so getting an extension and flexibility from them is not surprising to me

[24:04] So I'm glad that that is no longer an issue

[24:08] The issue still just remains, you know, do we think that they can come up with the capital to get the new manufacturer going?

[24:15] And so if the earliest we're going to see a new version of the Big Lebowski made by these new guys is October

[24:23] That that when is a date ever come true?

[24:27] Right, when is a date ever been hit by any of these boutique manufacturers when they set a date?

[24:33] So surprise that they put a date out there happens to be the same month as Expo

[24:39] It would be, it's kind of unbelievable that they would come back to Expo

[24:44] What is it? Three years now since they first unveiled the Big Lebowski

[24:48] To unveil the Big Lebowski version 2.0 made by someone else after everything that they've gone through

[24:56] I do hope it succeeds

[24:58] I'm still very, very skeptical about it all

[25:01] Because I still am not sure what's going to happen with the ARA games

[25:05] What's going to happen with all the tooling ARA did to make these games

[25:09] Are they just going to let Dutch walk as well?

[25:12] What's in the contract between Dutch and ARA?

[25:15] Does an ARA have the exclusive manufacturing rights to make the Big Lebowski with Dutch pinball?

[25:21] So is it over?

[25:24] Is it over? You know, does ARA just let them walk?

[25:27] Will there be a lawsuit?

[25:30] How does this move forward?

[25:32] Is this whole new sort of approach Dutch trying to get ARA to give in a little bit?

[25:38] I don't know, I really don't know

[25:40] All I know is that the Big Lebowski games are not shipping

[25:44] And if you're an owner, you still have to wait now, July, August, September, October

[25:51] And that's just, so that's four more months now, you have to wait

[25:54] Just to see like the O series or zero series showcase

[25:59] That's not production, your games are not coming in

[26:03] So then you're looking at what, like another almost six months, half a year

[26:08] Before you might, it might or might not happen

[26:12] And during that next six months all these other great games are coming out

[26:17] But you can't go get them because your money is locked up with Dutch pinball

[26:21] It's not good, it's not good

[26:24] And you can't get refunds, you can't get refunds

[26:27] There's your money's locked, they can't afford to give you refunds and get manufacturing going

[26:32] They pretty much have said that flat out

[26:35] So every Friday, we'll read these updates

[26:38] There's going to come a point though because we're really just at the beginning of July

[26:42] That we're, I mean what are they going to say every Friday

[26:47] If it's between now and October, I just don't know

[26:53] Like it's, this feels like we're starting this company all over again

[26:57] When it would have been easier just to figure out a solution with the ARA

[27:01] So that's what's going on with Dutch pinball

[27:04] Dial dins are shipping, dial dins are making their ways into people's homes

[27:09] They look incredible inside people's homes

[27:12] There are of course some quality issues that are popping up that people are dealing with

[27:16] I saw that one of the recent ones was that little electrical guy that goes back and forth

[27:21] For lightning bolts that he holds

[27:24] Have had some issues

[27:26] Where if they're installed incorrectly they'll block the ramp

[27:30] One person had theirs break

[27:33] I'll say this though, Jersey Jack customer support will fix anything that happens

[27:37] We, we, I've never seen an example where with the new JJP

[27:41] It has strung people along

[27:43] They've been quick to remedy these situations

[27:46] The play field shipping issues

[27:48] I think you're just going to see a handful of those happen

[27:51] I think you're going to get you know there's going to be like

[27:55] 3 to 5% failure rate in play fields that people just have to deal with

[27:59] I think we all know preventative measures

[28:03] When it comes to play fields, when it comes to mylar and clifes

[28:06] And those things people should explore if they're really OCD

[28:08] And want to prevent all chipping from occurring

[28:11] A little weird thing I saw was on one person's dial

[28:15] Then the target, the color of the target underneath that electrical dude

[28:19] Was red when it should be light blue to match his shirt

[28:23] And I was just kind of confused for that because how do you miss that

[28:27] Like a color thing on the assembly line

[28:31] So someone put the wrong target color on the machine

[28:34] And it's just like well were they out of balloons or how did you

[28:38] Did that see to me that's not normal

[28:41] Those things should be caught at the factory

[28:44] Not a big deal is that's an easy easy thing to change out

[28:48] I don't want to make a big deal out of it

[28:50] But it just goes to show that no matter what company

[28:53] We're talking about things always can happen in manufacturing

[28:57] And in production that are real head scratchers

[29:01] We saw it with Ghostbusters when he had like the wrong lollipop rails on the games that went out

[29:07] It just happens like there's it's an assembly line

[29:11] Like someone comes back from lunch I don't know maybe grab the wrong part

[29:15] And it was you know keep the games moving there's a lot of games going out

[29:19] A lot of dial bans are supposedly going out the door that Jack can't keep up with the demand for the game

[29:23] Which is which is a good thing

[29:27] We heard from the distributors about the collector's editions

[29:31] The timing for those is looking to be somewhere in September

[29:35] With payment being asked for probably sometime in August

[29:39] So for those of you with dialed in collectors editions

[29:42] The good news is you get some more time to save up your money

[29:46] Because your game costs more than an L.A.

[29:49] You need $12,500 bucks

[29:50] I don't think there's there's not really like a street price with J.J.P. Games

[29:54] The bad news is you have to wait

[29:57] But I think people are I haven't really heard people say

[30:01] They're going to bail on dialed in for Star Wars and then vice versa

[30:05] Some people have said they might be switching back and forth between the games

[30:09] They're so radically different

[30:11] And I saw two in the Star Wars thread

[30:13] People for some reason can't discuss Star Wars or Stern Pimball

[30:17] Without bringing up Jersey Jack Pimball

[30:21] It's like Trump and Clinton

[30:23] It's like Republicans Democrats

[30:25] These two companies have now become pitted against each other

[30:29] And almost every single conversation thread

[30:32] And I think it's time we just stop trying to compare these two companies

[30:38] Like it is apples to oranges

[30:40] I think both of these companies have gone about Pimball radically different

[30:45] I think Stern is making a mass produced product

[30:50] They're the Honda Civic of Pimball

[30:53] Stern is not looking to make the best possible Pimball machine they can

[30:57] They're not looking to make the Pimball machine with the most premium and high-end items inside it

[31:03] And push the envelope as far as they can

[31:07] I think Stern is trying to make Pimball successful

[31:12] I think Stern is trying to make bring you as many themes that you love in Pimball format

[31:17] And survive as a company and keep people employed

[31:21] And be the number one Pimball manufacturer in the world

[31:24] Like the burden on Stern is tremendous

[31:27] And I give them credit for what they've done

[31:29] They've saved Pimball

[31:30] They continue to save Pimball

[31:32] Everyone else is really struggling to get any games out

[31:35] Jersey Jack to me is more of the Mercedes Benz of Pimball

[31:40] They are trying to make the product more high-end

[31:44] They are tailoring these games because of where they're priced for more of the home market, the home collector

[31:51] The homey's only guy

[31:53] Does it mean you can't put these machines on location and people will?

[31:56] Does it mean they won't earn on location because they will

[31:59] But it's much harder as an operator to make your money back if you're spending $9,000 on a game versus a Stern Pro

[32:05] You're never going to see a $5,000 Jersey Jack Pimball machine

[32:08] I think also people need to stop blaming Jersey Jack for where Stern prices are at

[32:15] The only person you should blame for Star Wars Ellie being $9,000 for Batman super-arlie being $15,000

[32:24] The only person to blame are you or your Pimball friends that spent that money on those games

[32:30] If people had basically said we're not going to spend $15,000 for Batman

[32:36] Would you cannot see the value in it?

[32:39] If people didn't order them, guess what would happen?

[32:43] Stern would have lowered the price on all of them, but no, they got 400 applications for that game

[32:50] So you know what I'm saying? It's not Jack's fault

[32:53] I almost feel bad for Jack because I feel like Jack's slaved away to put everything in the kitchen sink into Wizard of Oz

[33:01] Basically made a game that was $7,000 with bomb price

[33:06] And he sold it for $6,500

[33:08] He was losing thousands on every Wizard of Oz sold and he did it to make the best Pimball machine possible

[33:15] He established his brand as a company that is aiming for Pimball greatness

[33:20] I would find it hard for someone out there to tell me that when you look at a new Stern Pimball machine right now

[33:27] You look at it and say this is the greatest Star Wars Pimball machine there could have been

[33:34] But they really made it, they didn't hold back, they didn't cut any corners

[33:39] They didn't know, there's a tide fighter on a spring

[33:43] Do you think you'd ever see a toy or a mechanism like that inside a Jersey Jack game?

[33:49] But again, Apple's the orange is it's like when I open up a Mercedes interior

[33:54] I expect to see carbon fiber and wood

[33:57] I don't expect to see carbon fiber and wood inside of a Honda

[34:02] I might get flamed for some people saying like, well Honda, what are you talking about Stern?

[34:07] Yes, look I think when Zambi Yeti and Lyman and Dirty Dottie make a Stern, then that's like the Acura

[34:18] That's when Sterns to me start to get more towards the premium side of the market

[34:23] Because they're using premium artists and they're putting more premium stuff into the games

[34:30] But Stern is inconsistent with that, where I don't think Jersey Jack's inconsistent with that

[34:35] But again, Jersey Jack's only made three games

[34:38] Stern makes three games in like eight months and is on to the next

[34:42] In the amount of time Jack has got three games out into the world

[34:46] Stern has probably gotten 15

[34:48] So again, Stern is the one who's carrying Pimball on its shoulders

[34:54] And so we have to be thankful and respectful of that

[34:57] Because if we're not, if we're not, then we're just shooting ourselves in the foot

[35:02] But I still wouldn't spend these premium prices

[35:07] I just don't think they're worth it

[35:10] I think Stern needs to get more into these games

[35:13] And collectors need to stop just buying every single new box game that comes out

[35:18] I mean that's this dynamic, this sort of cult following that I've noticed on Pinside recently

[35:24] Is this sort of like groupthink, sort of cult mentality where people just defend every single new unbox game

[35:34] And almost have to rationalize and justify that the value is there

[35:38] And to do that, I think these new collectors and these new people to the hobby

[35:43] I feel like I'm one of these people and I've been guilty this before

[35:47] Completely turn themselves off to the history of Pimball

[35:51] To what people used to get for their money, to what games used to contain for the amount of money they sold for

[35:57] And then they look at a game like Stern's new Star Wars and you're telling me

[36:02] That Stern Star Wars, early or print, is 9,000 dollar Pimball machine

[36:07] And yet a game like Circus Voltair sold for what, new in box, $2,500, $1,700 bucks

[36:16] Okay, so the problem is the cost haven't gotten up that much

[36:21] And Stern is a big company like Bally Williams was, they've got the hundreds of employees, they've got the full production line going, mass production line going

[36:30] I think they may, like I do, I think Stern makes too many games

[36:34] I think they make too many games that keep the line moving and because of that I do think the games aren't aiming to be the greatest possible games out there

[36:45] They're good enough for the theme but they're not getting anywhere near, I think, where JJP is with the quality of product

[36:55] And but the prices are the same and that's the part that's confusing to me

[36:59] If you told me that Mercedes and in Acura were the same price, which are you gonna buy?

[37:08] Problem is like Stern's got the best themes in the world and that is always the ace up the sleeve that they have, that JJP can't figure out

[37:16] I really thought by now Jersey Jack would have that like ace in the sleeve theme, that knock out theme that just everybody would want one

[37:25] And if Pirates is next, I just don't see it being that and then I think Toy Story is the one but I kind of feel like it just skip Pirates and go to Toy Story

[37:36] But we'll see what happens but that was my little sort of sidetracked rant about the cult mentality of defending you in box games

[37:46] You may have noticed that the interview with Jared has never aired and I wanted to read an email I got from a listener of the show

[37:55] I got an email from let's see from Aaron Nicholas

[38:01] Chris, good to hear your podcast when I'm back to work, which time would have allowed for us to get together in Vegas?

[38:09] I know think Aaron was out there

[38:11] He said, listening to your podcast this morning, you made a very good point about Robin possibly allowing pin manufacturers to edit or moderate their own forum

[38:21] And how that is a mistake, I agree

[38:23] The question I have is this, aren't you allowing Stern to execute the same privilege already by having them lock up your interview while they dissect it?

[38:34] Is there a difference or perhaps I am missing something that is not transparent?

[38:40] All right, well Aaron, the big difference is this, nobody has money invested in Canadian Spinball podcasts

[38:49] Nobody will get burned by this show if that interview doesn't air

[38:55] If Stern doesn't want to air the interview, it's no harm, no foul, it's up to them

[39:03] When I interview people, I allow them, every one of my guests, I allow them the same courtesy

[39:10] But if they want anything that we talked about on the podcast to be edited out, I will

[39:16] I, well maybe not anything, right? If they give me some amazing juicy nugget, but I've never experienced that

[39:24] Because we're talking about pinball here, I always have to remind people, this isn't hard news, this isn't something that really matters in the world

[39:33] This is pinball, there were times when I had really sort of scandalous information on highway pinball, and I thought I probably failed horribly in how I handled a lot of that information and how I deliver that to people out there

[39:48] Because it's also like, I'm here talking about pinball, I don't want pinball to become a stressful thing in my life where I'm putting out really negative, salacious stuff

[40:00] Or going against a word I had with someone just to get pinball views or listens, like I really, it's not worth it

[40:10] I'm not going to walk around stressed out because I think some guys mad at me or wants to sue me or I disrespected him or I went against the word I had about how I'd interview him and whether or not I'd air it without his final consent

[40:23] And the thing is this too, is Jared works for Stern, like they've hired him his skill set, and if he's going on the record for something they want to hear it

[40:36] I don't know why they didn't, I don't know why they didn't air it yet, but there's something I can do, so it is what it is

[40:43] It might be one day you'll hear it, but again, there was nothing in it that I think is going to blow you guys away

[40:50] I think Jared gives very safe answers about it because he has to, so that's the big difference

[40:56] If Robin lets the manufacturers edit out the truth though and silence people who have information about those companies that could save people money, that's the big difference to me

[41:07] If you let Andrew Highway moderate his forum and I have information that says Andrew Highway might be going bankrupt, you might not want to buy one of his pinball machines

[41:15] He's allowed to delete those comments and those threads and then people give him money and then he goes bankrupt

[41:21] So then people just lost $8,000 that they could have saved if he didn't have that power

[41:26] But no one's invested in Canadian pinball podcasts, no one's invested, nothing I don't have any reason why I think it's the same thing

[41:36] So that's it, Brenda just came in the door, it's been a long day for me, and Bubba, and Red Eye

[41:44] We'll talk to you guys soon, I got some interviews I'm lining up, there's a $10,000 Star Trek, New and Box, Ellie for Sale

[41:51] Who the hell buys a Star Trek? How many years ago, five years ago, and just keeps it in a box and wants to sell for $10,000

[41:58] Second, you open that box up, it's worth $7,000, have a good day everyone, we'll talk to you soon

[42:04] People, those big ones
