[00:00] I'm gonna have to pack it down, I'm gonna have to pack it down.

[00:12] I'm gonna have to pack it down, I'm gonna have to pack it down.

[00:18] Welcome to episode 131 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, I actually just closed out of watching

[00:24] Tim Ball's interview Crazy Levy about Star Wars.

[00:28] I think that just in a nutshell defines our hobby.

[00:32] Tim Ball's talking to Crazy Levy.

[00:35] It was actually interesting to hear how that pin played.

[00:39] Levy said it played really fast and had a lot of good flow.

[00:42] Sounds like every Steve Richie pin, right?

[00:45] I don't want to go too much into that now because on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[00:50] I'm gonna talk about Star Wars and a whole lot more with another individual out there

[00:56] that does a pinball podcast and I'm talking about no other than Jeff Rivera has joined

[01:02] the show to talk to me about all things going on in pinball.

[01:07] It was awesome to talk to Jeff and Jeff is one of the hyper-users on pin side.

[01:11] He's actually had a pinball podcast that has been up, I want to say for like six years

[01:16] and we cover every hot topic that's hitting the forum and hitting the pinball hobby these

[01:22] days.

[01:23] Before I go into that, because as I said earlier, like this week or last week, there's so much

[01:28] news happening on a daily basis that I literally, I literally feel like this could be the CNN

[01:34] or the Fox News of pinball because I can't keep up with it.

[01:39] So a couple news items and then I'm gonna air the interview with Jeff.

[01:42] So I heard a news item about Dutch pinball and there's a rumor that someone contacted

[01:50] ARA to pay ARA money to give up their pinball machine.

[01:55] I think this individual had the big Lebowski number 78 and he says,

[02:00] ARA, I'll give you a big chunk of change if you give me my game.

[02:04] And ARA says to him, what are you talking about man?

[02:07] We only have 10 games that we built that are here right now, not the 40 or 50 that people

[02:12] think they do.

[02:14] So I don't know who to believe.

[02:17] The whole story is a sort of soap opera that doesn't seem to have a happy ending anywhere

[02:25] inside.

[02:26] It just doesn't.

[02:28] And it's really, really stressful for all these Lebowski owners to not know who to believe

[02:34] and what is really going on.

[02:36] Wouldn't that be funny though if ARA, like just handed 30 of their employees big Lebowski's

[02:42] and we're like, hey guys, you guys can take all these.

[02:45] We'll keep 10 just in case these fools can come up with the money.

[02:50] But we don't think they are so everyone can go have one.

[02:53] I was joking with someone saying ARA is going to pass one around the company that everyone

[02:57] can jump on and it's probably going to end up being rare here.

[03:01] So that's just more bad news in the land of Dutch pinball.

[03:05] Highway pinball.

[03:06] We'll talk a lot about that on this podcast.

[03:10] The latest is this.

[03:13] They have made, I believe, another just sort of silly mistake and have now put out a timeline

[03:21] of what people can expect in terms of when games might start shipping and how many games

[03:27] might start shipping.

[03:28] And so the dates they've thrown out, it looks like August, September.

[03:32] They're saying again, they want to ramp up to get to 100 games a month around that time

[03:37] period.

[03:39] Someone said it perfectly.

[03:41] Deja vu all over again.

[03:43] Why would they give any dates and any numbers?

[03:48] Because after all the missed dates and missed numbers, people have heard in the past.

[03:54] These guys need to not make the same mistake as Andrew.

[03:57] If they feel confident that they can get these games out in August and September at 100

[04:04] games a month.

[04:06] I don't think they should say that to they've actually turned on the production line and

[04:11] understand the actualities of manufacturing this game.

[04:16] Right?

[04:17] It's not as simple as saying we need this many parts in this location, buy this date,

[04:23] and then all is good because we all know that there will be unforeseen delays.

[04:30] There will be hurdles.

[04:32] There will be issues.

[04:33] As someone else pointed out, the game has a lot of tweaks that need to be made.

[04:38] Have those been made and have you fixed everything before you've even ordered all the parts.

[04:45] And so I don't know what is going to happen next.

[04:49] I really don't.

[04:50] I saw Orc was in the thread and he's sort of like if people bailed, they're going to make

[04:55] this company difficult to continue.

[04:58] Remember, the ink hasn't dried on the deal.

[05:01] But I will keep beating the same drum.

[05:04] Nobody, nobody who has a chance to get their money out should keep the money in.

[05:12] If these gentlemen are so rich and so confident that they can turn this around, again, one

[05:18] simple approach.

[05:20] Let them fix the company with their money and not yours.

[05:23] I know this feels like a political campaign and that's my like make America great again

[05:27] line.

[05:29] But I'm really am nervous.

[05:30] I'm nervous that people are having revisionist history.

[05:34] People are hearing only what they want you to hear.

[05:37] And I'm really getting nervous because I'm hearing the people closest to highway pinball,

[05:43] trying to convince people not to ask for refunds.

[05:46] And I think it's too late for that.

[05:48] I think these gentlemen need to refund people who want their money, not a phone call, not

[05:55] like a begging you to stay in, not a threat of jacking the price up.

[06:00] And it's going to be dramatic.

[06:01] You know, I saw Orc was like, I'm fucking him out.

[06:03] I'm sick of this shit.

[06:04] It's going to be months of drama.

[06:06] You're absolutely right, Orc.

[06:08] It is going to be months of drama.

[06:10] This is not going to go smoothly.

[06:13] And I think these gentlemen don't understand that yet.

[06:17] It's really easy to be on an ivory tower in another country and just writing Andrew

[06:23] checks and believing his lies.

[06:25] If you now have to step into his shoes, figure out his mess.

[06:30] And not only that, you now have to take the arrows coming from the pinball investor and

[06:37] the pinball community.

[06:39] It's not going to be as easy as you think.

[06:42] And so we'll see how this whole thing transpires.

[06:44] But it's going to be a long bumpy road.

[06:48] And my advice is to get your money back if you can, if they'll give it to you.

[06:53] Another thread that is news that popped up today is that Slayer Pinball is a rumored title

[07:00] from Stern.

[07:01] And we remember when Stern went to a Slayer concert months ago, right?

[07:04] And they put up the Slayer banner.

[07:06] And everyone's like, the next game is Slayer.

[07:08] And everyone's like, no, I think it's Erasmith.

[07:11] And it was Erasmith.

[07:12] And now we have Zombie Yeti put up a sort of like a cryptic teaser where he was making

[07:18] the devil horns with his hand.

[07:20] And it was like a Slayer sort of motion or there was like a Slayer image in the background.

[07:26] And he's like soon Stern Pinball like coming like guys, how it's not going to be Slayer.

[07:32] I may be wrong.

[07:33] All right, that's my out in my prediction.

[07:37] But I think Stern would be out of their mind to make Slayer Pinball.

[07:42] Who?

[07:43] What?

[07:44] Like, no.

[07:46] It's most likely going to be Iron Maiden, which I don't care if it's Slayer or Iron Maiden.

[07:51] It might as well be Danzig.

[07:53] This is such an easy title for me.

[07:55] And I think for most of you to pass on, I don't think the fan bases of these bands is

[08:03] big enough to coincide with the Pinball fan base.

[08:07] I just don't see it.

[08:08] I really don't.

[08:09] I don't think there's going to be the level of excitement around those themes.

[08:14] And look, if it's not me getting knocks it out of the park with Iron Maiden and I think

[08:17] it might be Trudeau doing it with him.

[08:19] Yeah, that's a whole another story.

[08:20] If they come up with an amazing Pinball machine, I think the music might just, doesn't even

[08:24] matter if the game is incredible.

[08:26] But man, Iron Maiden to me, it's almost like when spooky is like Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[08:30] Castle.

[08:31] And I'm like, what?

[08:32] Like, I have that same sort of reaction.

[08:36] What else is going on in the news?

[08:37] I'm trying to think there's anything else.

[08:38] I'll tell you guys, I, you know, I'm still in on my Star Wars.

[08:44] That I have in with the game exchange.

[08:47] I don't have excitement for Star Wars though.

[08:50] And I have to be honest, every day that goes by, I want to wake up and I want to warm up

[08:55] to it more.

[08:56] And I know I haven't played it.

[08:58] But every time I see stuff on the game, every time I hear about, you know, stirring removing

[09:04] features from the LE, every time I just look at it and I read the forum, I really think

[09:10] a lot of people are just trying to convince themselves that this game is as awesome as

[09:16] they wanted it to be.

[09:18] Without even flipping it, I think there's just enough initial disappointment in just what

[09:24] you're getting for your money.

[09:26] And for me, the big disappointment is simple.

[09:28] And again, I was listening to Levy describe the game and the gameplay and this and that.

[09:32] And I just keep hearing like arrows and rams and posts and this and that and, and, and

[09:40] that's like describing any pinball machine with flow.

[09:43] And what I don't hear is really that the world of Star Wars is coming to life under the

[09:52] glass of this machine.

[09:53] I just don't feel that way about this game when I look at it.

[09:57] And from what I can tell so much of the Star Wars universe will come to life solely in

[10:02] the code and what's on the LCD, not what's below.

[10:07] The glass and, you know, Stern used to tell us that the game is below the glass, but

[10:14] I think they're relying now on so much of just the screens to bring the Star Wars, Star

[10:19] Wars, Star Wars, sorry, world to life.

[10:23] And I mean that when I look down at this game and I see these pop bumpers with just drag

[10:29] and dropped like pictures of Star Wars characters on the pop bumpers, like how lazy it is to

[10:36] like how lazy is that in the Star Wars universe?

[10:39] If Jersey Jack had made this game, I feel like those pop bumper areas would be, you know,

[10:44] the trees from the Ewok village, right?

[10:47] I feel like there'd be a lower play field or maybe an up and lower play field that might

[10:51] be like Han Solo in Carbonite where it has like a lighting effect that looks like the

[10:55] smoke when you freeze him in Carbonite.

[10:58] I feel like there'd be an AT-AT Walker.

[11:00] I just feel like there'd be so much more of the Star Wars world brought to life and

[11:08] there just isn't, right?

[11:09] I don't think they, you know, again, like I get what's there could be cool and the theme

[11:17] is a jug or not, but I'm just not feeling this game has like the magic and represents

[11:25] the Star Wars universe in the best possible way.

[11:28] And we'll see if I'm wrong when I play it, but I just don't, I don't think anything

[11:32] I play will change my mind, you know, seeing tie fighters blow up on screens to me is not

[11:39] as much fun as actually physically seeing amazing toys interact with the ball.

[11:46] And the fact that there's no magnet, like force grab magnet at all in this game, you know,

[11:52] that's to me that's just like a no brainer.

[11:54] How do you not have that in a Star Wars game?

[11:55] You almost got to build the game around the force, not just build the game around speed

[12:00] and shooting tie fighters, okay?

[12:03] So without further ado, let me welcome Jeff Rivera to the show.

[12:07] He's great guest.

[12:10] Him and I talk all the time.

[12:12] He's, I consider him a good friend.

[12:14] We communicate frequently on Facebook.

[12:17] He is the co-host of the pinball podcast, which I listen to as much as I can.

[12:24] I listen to almost every pinball podcast that is out there and I always have him on my

[12:28] feet as well.

[12:29] So I encourage you, if you are sick of Canadian pinball podcasts, there are other pinball

[12:34] podcasts out there to check out.

[12:37] So let's welcome Jeff to the show.

[12:40] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome the Canadian pinball podcast, a very

[12:44] special guest.

[12:45] This almost feels like when Batman would be in a Scooby-Doo episode, I've got Jeff Rivera

[12:52] from the pinball podcast, joining Canadian pinball podcast.

[12:56] So Jeff, welcome to the show.

[12:59] Yeah, it's good to be here, man.

[13:00] Thanks.

[13:01] This is exciting.

[13:02] I love talking to people like yourself who are hyper into the hobby.

[13:07] On the pin side, your codename is, is it jar 155?

[13:12] Yeah, yeah.

[13:13] And one of the worst user names possible, but I'm assuming those are your initials and

[13:17] the 155 is, it's a long story, but I can make it short.

[13:22] It's funnier if you tell the whole thing, but essentially when I was playing in a competitive

[13:26] basketball league years ago, I altered my jersey to have three digits.

[13:30] And when I came into the game, the ref got mad and kicked me out.

[13:34] But yeah, 155 was the number that I had changed.

[13:36] All right.

[13:37] All right.

[13:38] Two.

[13:39] And we know you're a Star Wars fan because you've got a Stormtrooper as your avatar.

[13:43] So Jeff and I are going to talk about just what's going on on the hobby.

[13:46] And I have to say, we picked this date specifically because we thought without a shadow

[13:51] of a doubt, there would be Star Wars gameplay footage out by June 6th.

[13:59] And I think we kind of got like half, not even like a 10% footage today.

[14:05] So let's jump right in, Jeff.

[14:09] When you first saw Star Wars, like what was your initial impression when you saw the game?

[14:14] Well, right away, I liked the layout.

[14:17] The problem was, is without seeing the ball in motion, everything.

[14:20] I just kind of had to fill those gaps in mentally of how it was going to shoot.

[14:23] So I guess my impression on that was pretty reserved, but I did like what I saw.

[14:28] I think like most people, I wasn't a big fan of the art kind of looked a little clip

[14:32] already to me.

[14:33] But knowing Steve Richie, and I'm a huge fan of last time, he worked with white Sullivan

[14:39] on Game of Thrones, I would say my overall reaction was positive just with reservations about

[14:45] how it looked as far as art goes.

[14:47] But I thought the layout looks great.

[14:50] You know, I think, look, next to Game of Thrones, it probably looks phenomenal because I think

[14:55] everyone collectively agrees that the Game of Thrones art was really suffering.

[14:59] And I have to say, like, I'm a huge Star Wars fan.

[15:02] I know you are.

[15:04] I'm still like, even today, and we saw Hyras images from IGN.

[15:10] I don't know about you, but I'm still trying to love it more, right?

[15:14] I keep looking at it.

[15:16] And I do like the layout.

[15:17] I do think it's going to shoot really well.

[15:20] I just wish that it had more visual pop.

[15:24] And I know you've been showing on Pinside Jeff how like a lot of these images, right?

[15:29] These are simple Google image search, Star Wars images that come up immediately that are

[15:36] the images we're seeing on the Playfield.

[15:39] Right.

[15:40] And I mean, I don't know.

[15:41] Do we feel like Stern mailed it in?

[15:43] Or are there, I hear a lot that they were just restricted.

[15:46] Did you believe that?

[15:47] That their hands were tied so much that this was the best art they could do?

[15:54] I mean, the problem is, is I don't have any evidence to know whether they were restricted

[15:59] or not, or if maybe in the negotiation, they said, hey, if you want to have customized

[16:04] art, it's going to carry a heavier cut on each sold or something.

[16:09] So I have no idea.

[16:11] To me, I don't know.

[16:13] I just have seen other products, especially like the comic books that are out there

[16:17] and stuff, that have been able to use the likenesses of the original characters and put them

[16:26] in however situations they feel works for what they're trying to convey.

[16:31] So I don't know.

[16:33] To me, it's probably somewhere in the middle.

[16:35] I kind of, if the license holder, like Disney was just saying, no, we'd rather you just

[16:41] go with our art package, let's stay on brand with this.

[16:46] I get it, but I kind of almost feel like Stern probably could have pushed back some on

[16:50] that just saying, pinball is a whole different animal than action figures.

[16:54] We really need to make this look good, make it cohesive.

[16:58] So I don't know what the situation was.

[17:01] If it really just came down to the license holder putting their foot down, like I feel bad,

[17:04] because they're always going to get criticized for that.

[17:08] And they can't really throw Disney under the bus.

[17:10] It's like something you don't do, right?

[17:12] You can't, you can't.

[17:13] But if it was a situation where they're hiding behind that a little bit, then that kind

[17:16] of sucks too, because I feel like Star Wars deserves a bit more than that.

[17:20] It's a dream thing for many, many football players out there.

[17:23] I think what makes it hard to feel like, so here's the thing, if all of Steve Richie's

[17:31] pins were beautiful works of art, and then we landed at this, I think we would say,

[17:37] yeah, they were restricted, right?

[17:39] I mean, because Steve's always giving us beautiful, but it's the opposite, right?

[17:43] I mean, most of Steve's games, the art, always seems to be probably the weakest point of

[17:49] the game.

[17:51] And we know that he's so focused on flow.

[17:53] We know that shot geometry and gameplay are his focus.

[17:57] He's really not.

[17:58] I don't think he emphasizes art as much as other designers in the Stern portfolio.

[18:04] So I guess people kind of got what they expected.

[18:08] They didn't expect it to be the most amazing art package.

[18:11] We all knew that Disney would have restrictions on what we got.

[18:15] So we have to accept it.

[18:16] I think people are starting to warm up to it, right?

[18:18] And now that we have high-res images, I think we can zoom in and actually see that all

[18:22] the artwork is in fact hand drawn, even if it's inspired by old artwork.

[18:28] Now, Jeff, let's talk about the layout, because you said the layout was, you're sort of

[18:31] really excited by it.

[18:33] When you look down at it, and I'm looking right now at the pro version and the premium

[18:36] LE, what excites you about the shots in the game itself?

[18:42] Well, I'm a big fan of what Steve ends up putting out.

[18:49] But what I really like about it is it just looks like a very clean shooter.

[18:53] It doesn't look like there's going to be a lot of hard stops for the ball.

[18:55] And that's classic Steve Richie.

[18:59] I'm not so hung up on the fact it doesn't appear that it has any under the play filled

[19:03] magnets or any of that stuff, because that generally doesn't work with what he's trying

[19:07] to do.

[19:08] And so the similarities between Avatar or ACD or ACDC or something don't really bother

[19:13] me that much.

[19:15] I just want a real clean shooting game.

[19:17] I want to let Dwight Sullivan and Steve work together to do real imaginative stuff with

[19:21] that shot map.

[19:23] And if you look, there's going to be plenty of opportunities for combos.

[19:27] The ball is going to be just going to be rocketing around that play filled as it does

[19:31] with most Richie games.

[19:33] Right.

[19:34] And go ahead.

[19:35] No, as you say.

[19:36] And I just feel like as Steve tends to do, even if you don't know what you're doing

[19:42] on a Steve Richie game, you go up to it and the flipper has really nice sweet spots for

[19:47] when you're launching a ball where there's something about it just feels nice.

[19:51] Like this shot just has a feel to it that you don't find with a lot of other designers.

[19:56] So when I looked at it and said, OK, he didn't lose his mind and go crazy or weird.

[20:00] And I knew more of that was in store.

[20:02] I got pretty happy about that.

[20:04] Right.

[20:05] And you'll never be confused where to shoot because there's like 20 arrows on this point

[20:09] field.

[20:10] Telling you exactly where to go with it.

[20:13] Like I agree, the flow is going to be great.

[20:15] And just to put the room at a rest, there are no magnets under the play field.

[20:19] It keeps, when the IGN video went up, there was this, first of all, that video.

[20:24] Let's talk about that for a second because we've all been waiting for gameplay video.

[20:28] And I don't think I've seen a worse gameplay video because first of all, the music was

[20:34] atrocious.

[20:35] It was like gin blossoms.

[20:37] It was like talking Japanese, talking Japanese.

[20:41] It was like that weird like fast pace, like crappy music when we all were expecting Star

[20:46] Wars music.

[20:47] But here's, I heard that IGN made that video.

[20:50] I saw someone on Pinside said, Stern made it.

[20:53] I don't know.

[20:54] It's not a great video.

[20:55] But there's a scene in the video where the ball's like floating around in the video a lot,

[21:03] and not a lot of fast pace action.

[21:04] And there's a scene where it looks like the ball goes near the force targets and sort

[21:09] of seems to like move upwards.

[21:11] Right.

[21:12] And everyone's like, oh, it's being force grabbed and it's being moved around.

[21:15] No.

[21:16] That is not what's happening in that little section of the video.

[21:20] But what did you think of the video when you saw it?

[21:22] Did you feel like it adequately gave you a sense of how the game is going to play?

[21:29] I guess that was the thing that for me, I was able to see glimpses of where the ball would

[21:36] be in certain points in its track.

[21:38] And I think if you have a lot of experience with Steve Richie Pins, you know there's going

[21:43] to be like a lot of longer shots to those points.

[21:45] So the video did a cool job of showing what's going to happen once it's in the ramp or

[21:50] once it's coming out of the ramp.

[21:52] And unless you were able to adequately fill those gaps in with your mind, I could see

[21:57] you just being confused.

[21:58] But to me, I think that's kind of what you want to show.

[22:02] But for people who maybe aren't going into it with that mindset, then yeah, it just seems

[22:07] disjointed.

[22:08] It seems like it's slow and floaty, which we know is not going to be the case.

[22:11] I saw people saying that and I like, you guys are crazy.

[22:14] This is a wide open play field.

[22:15] It's not a wide body like the Hobbit that's going to have the ball jibbling around.

[22:19] You know, if that's not going to happen, but I understand a little bit how they came

[22:24] to that conclusion.

[22:26] It's partially the video's fault, maybe partially just experience on behalf of that person.

[22:33] But yeah, the video maybe could have done it better showing some complete shots.

[22:38] But me personally, I didn't feel like I needed that to understand it.

[22:41] Right.

[22:42] And I think once people just heard that horrendous music too, they were fully expecting

[22:46] the John Williams score to get them pumped up.

[22:49] It's a very short video.

[22:50] I mean, I think it was cool to finally see the hyper drive in motion.

[22:54] It's this thing we've been doing so much about.

[22:57] The rumor is, and again, this is speculation because we still don't know fully how the

[23:02] full game is going to play.

[23:03] I heard you can put up to six balls inside that hyper drive as it's going around and around

[23:09] and around, which it's going to be freaking cool.

[23:13] Right?

[23:14] You're playing a ball and there's maybe three or four balls inside that track spinning

[23:18] around super fast as you're building up to get to light speed or whatever the mode is

[23:24] that engages the hyper drive.

[23:27] I don't know.

[23:28] I've never played a pinball machine that has a railing going all the way from the front

[23:33] flippers all the way through the back of the game and through a death star.

[23:38] Pretty cool.

[23:39] I mean, yeah, for sure.

[23:40] I still like the getaway with a supercharger.

[23:44] To me, that's still a great toy, but this is definitely like a whole other level beyond

[23:49] that.

[23:50] It's going to be really cool to see it.

[23:52] That's I guess another problem is the speed of the video didn't really convey that, but

[23:56] apparently the ball just really gets ripping around that like super, super fast.

[24:02] I think that's going to be kind of fun visually to watch.

[24:04] I kind of feel like they might have slowed down the video.

[24:08] When I look at it and I watch it again too, the ball is moving in a very, very slow

[24:14] in a strange way that is not indicative.

[24:17] Even when the balls come off the slings, it's not as fast as sling action on a pinball

[24:23] machine.

[24:24] I think they might have slowed it down just a little bit.

[24:27] And again, we'll talk a little bit about the marketing behind this whole game because

[24:32] I know that's a topic we're both into.

[24:34] So we finally get this video.

[24:38] Let's go from the outside in a little bit.

[24:40] So Jeff, are you in on a Star Wars right now?

[24:43] I'm not, but I'm going to be watching to see kind of how it does in the secondary market.

[24:49] But again, it's a theme that I'm super into.

[24:54] I love Steve Richie as a designer, so I'll be keeping an eye on it and definitely watching

[24:58] the second hand market.

[25:00] Out of the three different packages, the Pro, the Premium and the LE, and they all have

[25:04] different art packages.

[25:07] What are your thoughts?

[25:08] Which one do you think is the nicest if you had a pick one from an aesthetic standpoint?

[25:13] Originally, I liked the Premium the best.

[25:18] Seeing the new right side of the cabs, I really liked the right side of the LE.

[25:23] But I think I still probably prefer the Premium though the Pro's really growing on me.

[25:28] So I don't know, they've all got their strong points to it.

[25:33] So it's kind of hard to pick an outright winner, but from the beginning, I liked Premium

[25:36] best.

[25:37] Right.

[25:38] So the Premium has on one side the AT-AT walkers.

[25:43] And on the other side, it looks like it's got a Star Destroyer sort of firing, it's

[25:48] big green lasers.

[25:50] So the artwork on each side is pretty radically different on the Premium and the Pro.

[25:57] The LE has a little bit more of a cohesive art package with the Millennium Falcon being

[26:02] the main focus.

[26:04] And a lot of talk about the LE railing, right.

[26:08] This laser cut railing that people at first thought was Imperial grating or the inside

[26:16] metal inside the Death Star and inside Imperial Star Destroyers.

[26:20] I actually shared with a front and image that it's like the bottom grating inside the

[26:25] Millennium Falcon.

[26:26] It's just a bit of a gipsy, just galactic grating design, right, that we see in the universe

[26:33] of Star Wars.

[26:34] It doesn't light up though.

[26:35] And I think let's go through the LE because I think the LE package, especially when it

[26:41] comes to Stern-Pimble machines, they want to know if the LE value is there.

[26:45] And a lot of interesting features, I believe, have been left off of the LE.

[26:50] And I think LE owners, in particular, one of which I might be because I'm in on an

[26:55] LE, I'm trying to figure out if the value is there.

[26:58] So the first thing Jeff that they announced is that those side rails don't light up all

[27:04] of Star Trek LE.

[27:07] I think that's a missed opportunity.

[27:09] It just doesn't, it would be so cool if they would light up and maybe give the going

[27:16] into Hyperdrive or light speed sort of light show on the sides, but I don't know, they're

[27:22] just kind of cut out.

[27:24] Yeah, I agree with that too.

[27:26] I do like the pattern because the pattern is very Star Wars, but you almost never see

[27:31] it without them being lit up in the movies.

[27:34] Obviously in the grating for the Millennium Falcon, they're always lit up, but when you

[27:38] see them in the condo, it's on the Death Star or Star Destroyers or whatever, they are

[27:42] lit.

[27:43] That would have been nice to see.

[27:45] Willing to that, a model will come out for that as people have sold kind of some mods

[27:49] for a Tron to light up laser cut stuff.

[27:51] So it's doable and I think that will be an after-market thing.

[27:55] Yeah, I agree.

[27:56] And especially with 800 LEDs out in the world, I think if you make a cool mod for that

[28:02] area, almost everyone who has one would probably buy it.

[28:06] Yeah.

[28:07] So some other weird things Stern is doing here and this is, this sort of gets to the

[28:11] whole, is this, are there some cash grab moves going on?

[28:14] So they took out the real glass in the translate that they put back in with Aerosmith Ali.

[28:23] We no longer get real glass or mirrored back glass.

[28:27] It's a plastic translate, but you get all three.

[28:31] So I think that's how they're sort of making up for not giving you a real back glass.

[28:37] Well, like, I like the translate idea.

[28:41] I think that's really cool.

[28:44] With my Tron, I have all the translates produced and all switch around every once in a

[28:47] while just for variety.

[28:50] But I think that's better than a back glass unless the alternative was a mirrored back glass.

[28:58] If they could have made it mirrored, then I'd say screw the other translates, just give

[29:03] me one nice mirrored one.

[29:05] I think it was going to be like Ghostbusters where it's a true back glass painted, but there's

[29:09] not any mirroring or anything in it.

[29:11] I think I'd rather just have the additional trans lights.

[29:14] Right.

[29:15] Is the Aerosmith mirrored, I believe it is, right?

[29:17] It is, yes.

[29:18] Okay.

[29:19] So a little bit like one step four, two, step in a half back all say since you get all

[29:24] three translates.

[29:25] But here's another interesting thing I heard.

[29:28] So you know how the Ali back glass has the, I always say back glass, but translate has

[29:35] the, you know, above, you sort of like you're behind the four characters and they're going

[29:41] into light speed and it's a lot of the stars that are coming from the light speed motion.

[29:46] I heard that Stern is going to offer at an additional cost something that goes into the

[29:52] back box that simulates that moat that'll make it look like it's going into light speed

[29:57] like LED strips that will create that look of that back glass going into light speed as

[30:04] an Ellie option.

[30:06] Yeah, and that would be awesome.

[30:10] That would have been probably a fair trade to say instead of the extra back trans lights,

[30:14] now I'm saying back glass, to go ahead and do that effect included, I think that would

[30:20] have been awesome.

[30:21] It's crazy that it's an additional cost though.

[30:24] You know, I'm, because that's where I'm sort of scratching my head, the Ellie limited

[30:28] edition, the top dog, I just feel like everything should come with it for the money.

[30:34] Right.

[30:35] Because the other thing we don't get, we don't get a shaker motor anymore.

[30:40] So that's been yanked out.

[30:41] Yeah, that's how.

[30:42] We don't get Stern's new anti-reflective glass.

[30:48] That's another additional option.

[30:50] I'm trying to think there's anything else that the Ellie is without.

[30:55] So I think, you know, for the most part, what you do get for the Ellie is the different

[31:01] R package.

[31:02] I think you get the autographed play field, which is pretty standard on most Stern Ellie's.

[31:06] So sure.

[31:07] I think a lot of people are wondering whether or not to go in and on the Ellie.

[31:12] And here's my take, Jeff, and I'm curious to see what you think.

[31:16] I think this game is designed to be a great shooting game.

[31:20] I don't think it's designed for the collector market per se.

[31:24] And here's why I don't think the Ellie's in this case are going to be as sought after

[31:30] by collectors the same way, maybe a Ghostbusters Ellie is or maybe a Batman Ellie, just because

[31:37] there's so many more of these.

[31:39] And they also don't have like the aesthetic appeal and pop that I know collectors like

[31:45] alongside good gameplay.

[31:47] Yeah, I agree with that.

[31:49] I don't think that like you said, with 800 out there that it's going to be a struggle

[31:54] to find one if you do want one.

[31:56] On the other hand, it is Star Wars.

[31:57] So it's not going to be like something like WWE or Transformers where you could still

[32:02] find them new in box.

[32:03] They'll all get sold.

[32:05] But the I don't think people will be stabbing each other for a place in line or in the

[32:11] second hand market whenever one pops up.

[32:12] So I agree through there.

[32:14] It's not going to be the massive collectible.

[32:18] It'll always be something where if someone's looking and the price differences, if they

[32:26] shrink the price gap between premium and Ellie in the second hand market, they'd probably

[32:30] prefer to go LA just because it is technically a bit more limited or it is a little bit

[32:36] more special.

[32:37] But yeah, I don't think it's going to cause people to go crazy.

[32:41] Right.

[32:42] And we haven't seen all of it in motion.

[32:45] We haven't seen if that cool light feature does work on the Translite with the Ellie's.

[32:50] That could be another thing that differentiates that people might want.

[32:54] And we haven't seen the Topper, right?

[32:55] That's another thing that we've got no indication of, will there be a Topper for Star Wars?

[33:00] I would assume there would be considering Star Wars has pretty much topped off every

[33:04] game recently with $500 Toppers.

[33:08] And we haven't seen any decals or the inner artwork inside the cabinet, right?

[33:14] We've only seen that area black so far.

[33:18] Right.

[33:19] Yeah, something like an R2D2 Topper or like a C3PO Topper, I think it would make people

[33:23] go crazy for it.

[33:25] If it's R2D2, you know the head spins or something, any whistles on jackpots or something

[33:29] like that, people would probably get pretty excited about that.

[33:32] Right.

[33:33] I thought it would be cool too, maybe to have the sort of the back of the Millennium Falcon

[33:37] that lights up that could look pretty interesting.

[33:41] Let's talk about so marketing on this game.

[33:46] And then we'll move on to some other topics.

[33:48] But what I'm just curious about too is this is Stern's biggest theme ever.

[33:53] Would you disagree with that?

[33:55] I know, this is their biggest gift, for sure.

[33:58] So it's their biggest theme ever.

[34:00] This launch, I know it's been delayed.

[34:02] I know they are originally trying to launch on May 4th and then they are also trying to

[34:06] hit May 25th, which was the actual 40th anniversary of Star Wars.

[34:11] Their hands were definitely tied.

[34:12] I have to say that.

[34:13] I see a lot of people on the forum saying, Stern's marketing department should be fired.

[34:18] I don't think that's the case.

[34:20] I do know that it is really challenging working with Disney and Lucas on a machine like

[34:25] this.

[34:26] But that being said, I am confused though, how when they went to show it to the world for

[34:32] the first time, that all the bells and whistles aren't on it.

[34:37] And that's when I say like the toppers not there, the inner or decals, if there are any

[34:41] or not on it.

[34:42] It's a little strange that Stern didn't reveal its ultimate pinball machine or its most anticipated

[34:48] pinball machine with the right assets on its launch.

[34:55] This thing is sort of stumbling out.

[34:56] We first got low res images.

[34:58] Now we've got a kind of crappy gameplay video.

[35:02] Now we're waiting to see.

[35:04] So I also hear like there's all these rumors about how they have to show a twitch stream

[35:09] of it.

[35:10] They just can't invite Jack Dangerin and they can't do it from their own factory.

[35:14] They have to have it somewhere else.

[35:17] Why do you think it's like, is this just Lucas and Disney just making it a nightmare to

[35:22] market a pinball machine?

[35:23] Yeah, man.

[35:24] I really don't know what's going on with that.

[35:26] I know when obviously when they're doing episode one at Williams that it was a crazy nightmare,

[35:32] but they were working with assets to a movie that hadn't been released yet.

[35:36] There's no surprises left in the original trilogy.

[35:38] So I don't understand the secrecy there.

[35:41] Unless it's just fully a power play from a licensor saying, don't forget, it's a real privilege

[35:47] for you to use this and we're going to push you around and show you that.

[35:51] So I don't know what's going on.

[35:52] But otherwise, you know, with marketing, you're essentially convincing people to buy things

[35:57] that they don't need and you're going to make them just have this fear of missing out.

[36:01] And the big shame is that when you don't launch something at its best, that fear of missing

[36:08] out turns into like a, I'm a glad, it turns into a situation where people are almost

[36:12] glad they're not in yet.

[36:15] And that's kind of scary.

[36:17] Now the nice thing about pinball is, yeah, it's growing, it's getting bigger, but it's

[36:22] still a pretty small hobby.

[36:24] If you're a hardcore pinball player, you'll get exposed to it at some point.

[36:28] And that's an opportunity to change hearts and minds there, but that initial reaction

[36:32] can never be redone.

[36:36] So that's the real kind of bummer and shame about it all.

[36:38] Right.

[36:39] I agree.

[36:40] And because a lot of this, even though there is time to make up your mind, when it comes

[36:46] to buying an Ellie, though, and this is a part that being in on an Ellie, people,

[36:51] Ellie owners don't have as much time as people think anymore to make up their mind and whether

[36:56] they're going to pull the trigger or not.

[36:58] So what I heard from my distributor today was, all right, you have 48 hours to put another

[37:06] $2,000 down.

[37:07] Right.

[37:08] Now, I haven't read the fine print yet.

[37:10] It might be non-refundable at that point.

[37:13] And then the rest of the payment is due when your game is about to ship.

[37:19] But the problem for a lot of these Ellie guys now, and we saw this with Batman, especially,

[37:24] they don't even get to play it or even see the game being played before they've financially

[37:28] committed to it.

[37:30] Yep.

[37:31] And that's dicey.

[37:32] Yeah, Metallica kind of changed the game on how quickly all those Ellie's sold out and

[37:37] how many people were left wanting.

[37:38] And then that craziness hit a peak with Ghostbusters.

[37:42] Like within minutes of the official art being unveiled, you couldn't get one.

[37:48] And people were left scrambling and overpaying or buying spots in line.

[37:52] And so what I understand with most distributors and they're all going to handle a little bit

[37:55] differently.

[37:56] If you put that extra $2,000 in and a lot of times it's not refundable, but it is transferable.

[38:02] So if you decide to drop out of your Ellie, you can roll it into a pro or a premium or

[38:07] another game.

[38:08] But yeah, you would have to pull that trigger a lot of times before you're comfortable.

[38:12] So it's a really big faith-based decision.

[38:15] And if you're feeling shaky because maybe the unveiling wasn't what you thought, you either

[38:21] have to make a decision that you don't feel great about because you don't want to miss

[38:24] out or you pull back.

[38:27] And then when the good assets come out, you could feel really burned that you didn't

[38:31] stay in.

[38:32] So it's tough.

[38:34] It feels loose-lose.

[38:36] I know it's only pinball and it shouldn't be that serious, but I understand the anxiety.

[38:42] Yeah.

[38:43] I mean, it's, and I definitely think, you know, from Ghostbusters, right, the friends

[38:47] who was even worse for Batman because the number was so low for Ellie's and then the

[38:52] whole S.O.L.E. shenanigans.

[38:53] And I mean, I do give certain credit for not going S.O.L.E. on Star Wars.

[38:58] Like if there was one title, they could have just milked us.

[39:01] Easily.

[39:02] Yeah, they could have made it.

[39:03] They could have made just like, they could have made 40 Darth Vader editions for 20 grand.

[39:11] And they would have sold out.

[39:12] Yeah.

[39:13] They didn't do it, which is good.

[39:15] Okay, so Jeff, what's interesting about pinball right now, and I know this is another game

[39:19] that I believe you're in on and you're excited about.

[39:22] I, you know, I hand someone $9,000.

[39:25] You got Star Wars, Ellie, and you got dialed in, which is, should be shipping this week.

[39:31] Tough decision there.

[39:33] Tough decision to put these two games side by side and, and, and ask like, which one is,

[39:40] where, where's the value lie?

[39:42] Which one do I really want to own?

[39:44] And I know a lot of people out there are weighing those two games and maybe a lot of people

[39:49] will get both.

[39:52] What, what are your thoughts when you think about Star Wars juxtaposed to dialed in in

[39:56] terms of which one you think is, you know, maybe the better pin?

[40:00] Yeah, that's, see, I don't get super hung up about the art and stuff.

[40:05] I appreciate good art.

[40:06] I mean, if I'm being honest, I don't think dialed in is worth $9,000.

[40:09] Yeah, that's what I'm paying and I'm in on one.

[40:12] But if it's a pure comparison, yeah, dialed in has a lot more in it.

[40:19] We don't know any questions about the, like we've seen very basic details about code.

[40:23] So that's tough to judge, but dialed in does have a ton of code into it.

[40:28] And we know it was all basically all the visual elements and everything were from scratch.

[40:32] They had to build that.

[40:34] So I understand on the direct comparison how people can say, you know, dialed in just offers

[40:39] so much more.

[40:41] But what happens if Star Wars is just more fun to play?

[40:43] Like a lot of that just doesn't matter.

[40:45] I mean, okay, I always am bagging on the hobbit.

[40:48] Sometimes I feel bad about doing that.

[40:51] But I mean, objectively, yes, the hobbit has a lot in it.

[40:55] Maybe not on the play field, but technologically it has a lot in there.

[40:58] It's got the big screen.

[41:01] It's got tons of mechs and individually controlled drop targets.

[41:05] But the game is just not very fun.

[41:07] I just, I can't enjoy it.

[41:10] And so I don't care.

[41:12] You could offer me a hobbit for 3,500 and I'd walk away.

[41:15] Right.

[41:16] Now it's a really good point.

[41:17] I mean, I think when you look at a pinball machine and you try to just ask yourself, you

[41:23] know, just is this worth what they're asking?

[41:26] And if you look at dialed in, I think the game's got something like four magnets in it.

[41:34] It's got something like a, it's got a bash toy.

[41:36] It's got the cell phone.

[41:38] It's got the holographic theater.

[41:41] You know, it's got the 27 inch screen.

[41:43] It's Pat Lawler's like return to pinball, right after a long hiatus.

[41:49] And it looks great.

[41:50] It's got the full LED RGB changing lights in the light showing that game is phenomenal.

[41:55] You know, like if you were to put Star Wars next to dialed in the meaner, like they're

[41:59] both nine grand.

[42:00] I would be like, I don't know, like maybe dialed in looks like it's eight, maybe Star

[42:05] Wars looks like it's a GP6500.

[42:06] I still don't think Stern's no Stern looks like a 9000 on pinball machine.

[42:12] They cost that now.

[42:13] We don't really have a choice.

[42:15] And the street price I think has gone up.

[42:17] So I was coated by distributor that Star Wars Ellie shipped to my door.

[42:21] I think it's something like $8,495, which is a little bit of a price increase.

[42:27] I believe, I believe Ghostbusters, I want to say Ghostbusters Ellie was $8,100 shipped

[42:37] to door.

[42:38] I think that's what I paid.

[42:40] Yeah.

[42:41] So it's gone up in price.

[42:42] But again, there's going to be an increase with the LCD.

[42:47] We all knew that was coming.

[42:49] So are you in on a dialed in, Jeff?

[42:52] Yes, yes.

[42:53] I've been in since, well, if you remember way back when Steve Bowden and Buffalo pinball

[43:02] did that stream at the Jersey Jack factory, I actually called and got on the list the

[43:09] next day.

[43:10] So it's been quite a while.

[43:12] That was kind of one of the first real gameplay things.

[43:14] And then I got a chance to play it.

[43:16] And I was already in at that point, but that just solidified my decision to stay in.

[43:20] But yeah, I'm in for an L.A.

[43:21] Okay.

[43:22] So you already had just on a gameplay video.

[43:24] I'm watching them sort of flip it.

[43:26] And you're just so impressed with what you saw that you're like, I got to get this.

[43:29] So my decision on that was, I wanted to, if I was going to get in, I wanted to get

[43:34] in early, but knowing how long it takes Jack to put a game out, I knew it, I would have

[43:37] a chance to play it before, you know, final deposits were due or second wave, whatever

[43:44] it would be, I knew that that would happen.

[43:46] So I thought, why not get on the list now?

[43:48] If I play it and I'm just not that impressed or I'm not $9,000 impressed, I can always back

[43:54] out.

[43:55] So I threw it a positive down and got it at that point.

[43:57] Thankfully, after playing it, I, it just reaffirmed my decision to stick with it.

[44:01] But honestly, I don't think any pinball machines worth $9,000.

[44:05] It's emotionally maybe, but actually, monetarily, we're crazy for doing this, but it's kind

[44:12] of what it costs to play these days.

[44:13] It's getting, yeah, and it, you know, and I say this as someone who's got a over $20,000

[44:20] broken pinball machine in my living room, but it's getting harder and harder to see how

[44:26] there can be a market, right, for so many games coming out at this price point with all

[44:34] these different companies.

[44:36] And I just don't, I think we're sort of at a little bit of a ceiling unless a few things

[44:42] happen, right, unless you really jam pack these games with amazing features and amazing value

[44:49] where you can see it being a $9,000 game.

[44:53] I think what people fail to realize is back in the day when they try to compare these modern

[44:57] games to Valley Williams games, it's different when you used to sell 15,000 of a game.

[45:04] They could load those games up and there was enough profit once they hit a certain volume

[45:09] point to justify going the extra mile.

[45:13] But I think pinball is a lot tougher and I also, because we don't know the actual volume

[45:19] of games that sell.

[45:22] I don't think it's as big or they sell as many games as people actually think.

[45:26] I know I hear numbers of like ACDC and like 5,000, 6,000.

[45:30] We don't know.

[45:31] We don't know these games are moving at that volume.

[45:34] I don't know if you heard when I interviewed Jersey Jack and he said he had a 1,000 dial

[45:38] dins that were sold.

[45:40] I don't know if that sold or 1,000 people put $250 down, which is different than sold,

[45:45] because those deposits are refundable.

[45:49] Once you ask people to pony up $89,000, you're going to lose a certain percentage of people

[45:55] who just got on a list, right, with a refundable deposit.

[45:59] Yeah, those numbers are always a little fuzzy.

[46:03] I don't know that they've actually sold at full price any dial dins at this point.

[46:09] Maybe sold to distributors.

[46:10] Maybe he has distributor orders.

[46:12] It's that whole marketing thing where if your sales are really high, then you report

[46:18] sold.

[46:18] If your sales are okay, you report shipped and call it sold.

[46:23] So I don't know what numbers there are.

[46:24] I don't even know if 1,000 is good because nobody releases numbers anymore.

[46:28] So I have no idea how that compares to Stern.

[46:31] I would be surprised if Stern wasn't selling 4 to 5,000, even their lukewarm titles these

[46:37] days.

[46:38] There's just so much more happening.

[46:41] From what I always heard, people had guessed that ACDC may have been in the eights.

[46:46] That seems pretty high to me.

[46:47] I don't know, but I could see Metallica flirting with that for as long as it's been running.

[46:51] So I don't know if 1,000 is good or not, but I would guess that the way Jack speaks,

[46:59] it would probably be distributor orders, which maybe he counts on sticking those numbers.

[47:05] But to the end user, I'd have a hard time believing 1,000 at this point.

[47:10] I could see 1,000 people on lists.

[47:12] How do you think Dial did is going to sell?

[47:14] We talk a lot about the theme.

[47:17] From a marketing standpoint, definitely not a slam dunk by any of the next titles like

[47:22] Star Wars and Batman and Ghostbusters.

[47:26] It's going to be, what do you think the market reception will be outside of the few

[47:29] of the diehards like us on these forums?

[47:32] There's a whole other market they need to reach if they want it to be probably commercially

[47:37] and successful.

[47:39] Yeah, that's the problem.

[47:41] For commercial success, it is really expensive.

[47:45] I don't think an operator cares how much extra features they packed into Dial in over

[47:51] a Star Wars Pro.

[47:53] And if they need to order 10 machines for the year, they can either order, you know,

[47:59] their buying power is like 1.75, almost Star Wars for every one dialed in, whatever it

[48:08] is.

[48:09] I haven't done the math, but so commercially, I think it could be tough.

[48:12] They're going to be always those special locations that they just, they buy and they put everything

[48:16] out there and they have the muscle to do that.

[48:19] But I don't think your average operator can really do that.

[48:23] Or if they do, they can only put it in one location and they might be able to put, you

[48:27] know, they might be able to order three Star Wars for three different locations, but they

[48:31] can only have one dialed in among the three locations.

[48:34] So I think in the hardcore collector community, they'll have a hot start because just the

[48:39] initial hype of any new game.

[48:42] And then I think you'll probably see a bit of a trailing off and then a slow burn of

[48:47] decent sales over time that would outpace say like what the Hobbit did over time.

[48:53] Wizard of Oz has just been out so long.

[48:55] It's going to be a really long time before it could catch something like that.

[48:58] But I don't see it doing anything along the lines of what like Star Trek has been able

[49:05] to do for Stern just purely for financial reasons.

[49:08] I don't care how good a game is.

[49:10] There's only so much money out there.

[49:12] Yeah, no, I agree.

[49:14] And you know, it's the at the price point and the theme being what it is.

[49:20] I think the word amount is going to be phenomenal.

[49:22] I think when people start getting them, people are going to want one.

[49:25] But a lot of people are going to wait and try and pick one up secondhand.

[49:29] It's at the point now, too, where when you get a game secondhand for the most part now,

[49:34] these games all end up in these collector homes and they're waxed and they're treated

[49:39] pristinely.

[49:41] You might as well.

[49:42] And with all the new stuff coming out, it's going to be a secondhand market for a long

[49:47] time to be able to grab something of quality for much less than these MSRP prices.

[49:52] Because I do think all the prices, too, are going to start to dip even further just because

[49:56] the volume of new stuff coming out, I mean, Stern's not stopping.

[49:59] They've got so many titles.

[50:01] One after another coming out.

[50:03] Got a tack from Mars.

[50:05] You've got, you know, let's see.

[50:08] What else we got coming out?

[50:09] We've got P3 maybe, but that's again, very limited, limited, limited there.

[50:13] That's even more expensive.

[50:15] That's a $10,000.

[50:16] Do you think P3 makes it?

[50:17] I mean, we're still waiting.

[50:20] Yeah, it's going to be really, really hard to judge that one because you go to the shows

[50:24] and there's always people on them and they're laughing and having a good time.

[50:28] But I don't know that it's understandable or digestible without them standing by and explaining

[50:33] it.

[50:34] For location, it could just be very confusing.

[50:38] The home brew market loves it, obviously.

[50:41] They like all the possibilities of the interchangeability, but it's something I really want to succeed.

[50:47] It just doesn't feel like it's built to succeed.

[50:51] And as much as pinball has grown, it doesn't feel like it's big enough to support that.

[50:55] But I don't know, I could be surprised.

[50:58] I don't know.

[50:59] I'm not just never had a good feeling either way.

[51:01] Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, I agree.

[51:03] I mean, I think Jerry has a really big ambition with P3 and he's changed a lot of what pinball

[51:12] is.

[51:13] And I think Nate Chivers used to say, like, I don't know if it's pinball enough to be successful.

[51:17] And I think that's a good way to look at it.

[51:20] And I hope they go out soon because I know that they've had some delays in manufacturing.

[51:26] And that always seems to be the challenge for all of these sort of boutiques and startups.

[51:32] Just taking a game around to shows for a bunch of years to drum up interest is one thing,

[51:38] but then actually getting the game into production.

[51:41] It's a whole nother can of worms.

[51:42] So speaking of production, speaking of sort of stumbling in terms of production, we have

[51:50] to talk about alien.

[51:52] And it's something that's the main, the two main threads that are just blowing up in

[51:57] the hobby right now are Star Wars and the rebirth of highway pinball.

[52:03] Were you surprised when you learned that that Andrew was stepping down and that investors

[52:08] were taken over?

[52:10] No, I thought when the investors took over, if they didn't outright push him out, they

[52:17] were going to push him into a corner just because the fans of highway pinball have accepted

[52:24] Andrew.

[52:25] They've accepted his, I mean, they're excuses, right?

[52:29] They haven't been explanations.

[52:30] They've been excuses and they've accepted that.

[52:33] But everybody from the outside looking in on the alien project just felt like Andrew was

[52:38] just selling words to buy time.

[52:41] And I don't think anybody trusted anymore.

[52:43] And I think the new investor group would say, I don't think this guy can generate new

[52:49] orders because nobody trusts him anymore.

[52:51] He said too many things haven't come to pass or he said too many things that were just

[52:56] outright impossible for him to do or just were not going on.

[53:00] So I knew he would be out or if he wasn't out, he was going to be, I don't know, some

[53:06] different role within the company and they'd frame it in a real PR friendly way, but didn't

[53:10] shock me at all.

[53:11] Yeah, and I think the first indication of that is Dennis Norman, the reason he left, I

[53:18] mean, it's pretty public now is when he came on board and designed the game and that

[53:23] was October, around October of 2014, there's around expo when Andrew said the game's going

[53:32] to be out in April of 2015 and he's like, I'm out.

[53:36] That timeline isn't possible.

[53:38] And I think we're, Jeff, why do you think like people just become fans of a company?

[53:45] When we see it on Pimphit all the time, right?

[53:47] And I sort of refer to refer to as like people picking a religion, like they become a fan

[53:54] of it, they defend it, even though there might be evidence that things in this religion

[54:00] are not right.

[54:02] And even with that evidence presented, they just ignore it and cheerlead.

[54:08] Like what makes a pinball fanatic into a fanboy of a company that can't think objectively?

[54:20] Well, there's the whole pride aspect that you have to admit that you were wrong, but

[54:26] you don't just have to admit that you're wrong.

[54:28] You have to look back at all of your enthusiasm, realize that it was misplaced, and also realize

[54:32] that you had a hand in kind of sucking other people in along for the ride.

[54:37] And Skippy was coming up and the cautious people said, hey, yeah, looks like they got

[54:43] something going, but I'm not ready to put my money in until I see something more.

[54:46] You had some people like, tell them all you're ready, that you're not going to get it,

[54:50] you're going to miss out.

[54:52] They know they said those things.

[54:54] So they're just going to go down with the ship and tell the point when it's 100% dead

[55:01] and over, and then they can fall back on that boy.

[55:05] That guy was such a slick customer.

[55:09] I just got sucked in and has to do everyone else, but they want to point it.

[55:13] Everyone else that got sucked in too, but they don't want to admit that they're part

[55:17] of the reason all those other people got sucked in.

[55:18] They were the cheerleader that grabbed people's hands and dragged them along.

[55:23] It's tough.

[55:24] It's the same personalities, like our friend helped in who the same sort of people did it

[55:30] and Skippy, they did it with Andrew.

[55:32] I think to the other thing is, I think people just love the theme so much.

[55:37] It's not like they're a fan of Andrew or they're all they want.

[55:41] It was a UK pinball company.

[55:44] They love the movie, Alien so much.

[55:47] Same way people love the movie, Predator so much.

[55:50] The thought of having that theme in their game room, we hear it all the time.

[55:55] It's like, this is my dream theme.

[55:58] They will do whatever it takes to try and bring that theme to fruition.

[56:05] That means, man, I got to shut up these guys over here that if they're right, it might

[56:11] sink this company in my chance of getting my dream theme.

[56:16] I wasn't surprised either.

[56:19] I've been shouting from the rooftops for over a year that there have been problems at

[56:23] a highway pinball.

[56:25] Some people listen to me.

[56:26] I think a lot of people, though, Jeff are on the sidelines.

[56:29] I think the simple fact that with Alien being as big of a theme as it is and the L.E.s

[56:35] hasn't, still haven't sold out.

[56:39] Even up until the last week's announcement, people still were saying everything's fine.

[56:44] They're going to come out.

[56:45] They're still L.E.s available and there's only 500 there making.

[56:50] I think a lot of people have been cautious.

[56:52] We saw yesterday an announcement from Alien or highway pinball investors.

[57:00] Did you get a chance to read that email they sent to people requesting refunds?

[57:05] Yeah.

[57:06] It's like when you try and cancel your lawn care service and they don't just take your

[57:12] cancellation notice.

[57:13] They call you up and they want to talk about it.

[57:17] They want to have a friendly conversation.

[57:19] It's crazy.

[57:20] It's just like, no, I'm smart.

[57:21] I've decided I want out of this.

[57:23] Let me out.

[57:24] There was that tone of, like, let us try and convince you to stay in.

[57:30] Right.

[57:31] Plus the hail Mary of, well, you're going to want to come back and it's going to cost you

[57:36] more if you don't keep your pre-order.

[57:38] That's kind of funny, too.

[57:40] Yeah.

[57:41] What advice would you give these guys?

[57:47] These investors were clearly on the sidelines and they let Andrew sort of run the company.

[57:54] These guys all have other jobs and other businesses that must be successful.

[58:02] You're a very successful businessman.

[58:04] If you have enough extra money to pump into a pinball company that you're not even actively

[58:09] managing.

[58:10] Right.

[58:11] Yeah.

[58:12] I think these guys have a lot of pride and a lot of hurt egos.

[58:17] I think they're jumping into this but I don't think they really understand from a marketing

[58:22] standpoint.

[58:23] They need to be an issue in crisis mode right now and I don't think they're fully, they

[58:27] fully grasp that when I look at how they're communicating.

[58:31] Right.

[58:32] If you look at what American pinball did, they went through a very, very painful process

[58:39] of divorcing themselves from J-pop fully and putting out a new product.

[58:47] I think they've done a good job of turning it around and the way they've done it is they've

[58:50] been pretty much honest and said, yeah, look, we know that you guys have a lot of anger

[58:56] and stuff.

[58:57] We don't have anything to do with Papaduke anymore and I think they need to be real honest

[59:01] about what their ongoing relationship is with Andrew.

[59:04] Now, I think Andrew, personally, he's actually a pretty good guy.

[59:06] I've talked to him at shows and stuff.

[59:08] I think he cared.

[59:09] He just got in over his head and had no idea how to get back out.

[59:13] This investor group has to explain why they're willing to make that leap.

[59:17] As you said, they're successful people.

[59:19] Why did they use that knowledge that they have to look at not a sinking ship, but a ship

[59:24] that was already like six inches underwater and say, we're willing to throw the money

[59:29] into bringing that up and try and make it happen.

[59:31] Because if they just wanted to get into pinball, why wouldn't they just buy another design

[59:37] and start with something that's not tainted?

[59:40] So I think they need to be honest.

[59:42] They need to be upfront and not get these weird kind of gamey tactics of, hey, you want

[59:48] out.

[59:49] Well, let us talk to you at first.

[59:50] Don't pull the mob guy over to pay a visit or anything.

[59:54] Just be as up front with everybody you can.

[59:57] Give the money back.

[59:58] Move forward with new people.

[01:00:00] Well, the hard part for them is they're the initial investors in highway pinball, right?

[01:00:06] It wasn't like American pinball was the initial investors in Zidware.

[01:00:11] And they were trying to do a little bit of a mea copa and just salvage it because that's

[01:00:17] all they had.

[01:00:18] I think if the big question is this, would it be easier for these gentlemen if they're

[01:00:24] going to go through all the rigour mororer?

[01:00:26] Is that even how you say the word?

[01:00:27] If they're going to go through all of that and they really have to start a pinball company

[01:00:32] from the bottom up and get production running and ramp it up, would it be easier just to

[01:00:38] come up with a new company?

[01:00:39] Will they change the name from highway pinball to something else, but still ship alien?

[01:00:44] That might be difficult contractually because probably every contract is between Fox and

[01:00:48] highway pinball LLC.

[01:00:52] But I do know that it won't be easy.

[01:00:55] And I think when they first communicated that they're going to get out aliens quickly,

[01:01:00] I mean, I don't know what does quickly mean in this pinball world where we live in.

[01:01:05] People have waited two years.

[01:01:07] I definitely think we're not going to see alien alleys shipping anytime in junior and

[01:01:12] July.

[01:01:14] I don't know.

[01:01:15] How long do you think they have?

[01:01:17] Do you think they have six months, two months before people really are going to want to

[01:01:21] see some movement?

[01:01:23] Yeah, their messaging is going to be really important in how much time they can buy because

[01:01:28] that's the highway story is time just kept getting bought, but progress wasn't happening.

[01:01:34] So they need to show that it's a different story now.

[01:01:37] It's a new day.

[01:01:38] Obviously people do, if they want to be in and they still believe it's going to happen,

[01:01:42] then they're going to have to give them some time to rally and make things right.

[01:01:47] But really, yeah, they need to be building games.

[01:01:52] I would say like actual completed games, not one here and there, but truckload of games.

[01:01:59] I would say within three months, six months, they need to be going out to people at a regular

[01:02:03] pace because the design is done.

[01:02:05] Right now it's staffing up.

[01:02:07] Maybe getting a few guys to help build faster.

[01:02:10] Apparently, they have parts, right?

[01:02:13] Like some, they just, they've got to get the ball rolling.

[01:02:16] It's hard to tell because I hear lottery ports that there is a lot of issues with

[01:02:22] vendors that Andrew burned all the bridges with the local vendors and then pinball lifeless

[01:02:27] supplying him and then he didn't pay pinball life.

[01:02:30] Again, these are all rumors.

[01:02:31] Don't hold me to it.

[01:02:34] But it is a time where rumors are going to fly because it doesn't matter.

[01:02:37] The company right now is in rebuild mode.

[01:02:39] So it's whatever Andrew did, it didn't work out.

[01:02:44] Here's what I think they should do.

[01:02:47] This is, I'm not an issues in crisis.

[01:02:51] My role in marketing is to help brands get news and get excitement going.

[01:02:55] When a brand messes up, we have a whole issues in crisis department where I work.

[01:03:00] But what I can take from issues in crisis is just be truthful and be honest and be upfront

[01:03:05] and also try to think about it to the lens of your consumer and play devil's advocate.

[01:03:11] Don't think about it.

[01:03:12] What's going to make it easier for you to do your job as the new investor in this company.

[01:03:17] I would announce we're going to give anyone who wants a refund or refund.

[01:03:20] We're going to start there.

[01:03:22] We know you've waited two years.

[01:03:24] We know you've been lied to.

[01:03:25] We're sorry.

[01:03:26] We'll give you your money back.

[01:03:27] We hope that you return as a customer when games are ready.

[01:03:29] I would announce that with no shenanigans about raising prices, about, let's talk on the

[01:03:34] phone.

[01:03:35] We're pinball fans.

[01:03:36] They said something like, let's have a great pinball conversation.

[01:03:40] I mean, what?

[01:03:42] This isn't like, let's all just bond and talk about pinball.

[01:03:48] I've been waiting two years and I have nothing and I'm sick.

[01:03:51] I'm sick and tired of it.

[01:03:53] I'd give everybody their money back and say, look, we're going to announce that we're going

[01:03:57] to fix this company with our money not yours.

[01:04:00] That's it.

[01:04:01] Don't say anything more than that.

[01:04:02] The next time you'll hear from us is when we have production up and running.

[01:04:07] Here's how buying an alien pinball machine is going to work in the short term.

[01:04:10] We are only going to send games to distributors that are inboxed that you can take into your

[01:04:15] home.

[01:04:16] We're not going to be taking your money directly.

[01:04:18] When we have truckloads of games going to distributors, we will let you know.

[01:04:22] For all you Ellie people, your spots will remain, but you will pick up your game and pick

[01:04:27] your game from distributors.

[01:04:29] And they need to figure out.

[01:04:31] It sounds easy when I say quickly like all that, but I think they're going to be in a

[01:04:38] real pickle if they've got like an inbox, inbox is full of refund requests and they're

[01:04:46] not handling them properly or timely.

[01:04:48] And then they've got all these Ellie people with different denominations in.

[01:04:53] And they also need to say there's one Ellie.

[01:04:55] It's this.

[01:04:56] It's like blue trim with this.

[01:04:59] That's it.

[01:05:00] There's no pick your own Ellie.

[01:05:02] There's no pick your own.

[01:05:04] They will never get manufacturing on a line the way Andrew had the matrix for that game.

[01:05:10] It was idiotic to allow people so many options that stop the line from moving.

[01:05:18] When Stern wants to build Ghostbusters Ellie Jeff, they order 500 green armor and legs.

[01:05:26] 500 and we're done.

[01:05:29] If Andrew has to go build Alien Ellie with green blue black, now he's got to like, how

[01:05:35] do you order for that?

[01:05:38] And if you're not sold out, you can't place your order for just a total number of 500 which

[01:05:42] would bring your cost down versus ordering 173 green like 225 like blue.

[01:05:50] They got to just say this is the Ellie.

[01:05:53] Yeah, I agree with that as well.

[01:05:57] It's silly too, like you said, if it's not sold out, if someone places an order and say

[01:06:02] he's just made a parts order, do you have to wait for him to hit a critical mass of a

[01:06:06] certain number that he needs to order to make it financially viable?

[01:06:10] Or is he just going to eat the added cost of ordering ones and twosies the whole time?

[01:06:14] It just doesn't make any sense.

[01:06:17] So now that you know, I haven't really revealed a lot of this, but just in the spirit of

[01:06:22] like now that the thing is kind of like quasi-collapsed.

[01:06:25] One thing that people don't know is that remember when we were waiting months on the

[01:06:30] Ellie artwork for Alien and that was like that big stall tactic, like it's not been

[01:06:34] approved by Fox, it hasn't been approved by Fox.

[01:06:37] Sure.

[01:06:38] So I wonder what people would say if they learned and this is like what happened.

[01:06:44] The Ellie artwork for the backlash wasn't even commissioned until like a week before

[01:06:51] Alien Day.

[01:06:53] So there was no artwork submitted for months during that period that everyone was told

[01:07:01] they were waiting.

[01:07:02] So it just goes to show.

[01:07:03] There was just all these stories cooked up and look, you can only lie so long before it

[01:07:09] catches up to you and it caught up to Andrew and I think everyone does wish these investors

[01:07:14] luck.

[01:07:15] I think they have a long road ahead of them and I think they need to clamp down on everyone

[01:07:22] who's on team highway and that means like putting a gag order on you know whether it's

[01:07:27] oric or even David Teal like all the people who are on the highway team they need to call

[01:07:32] an all highway meeting and say one channel of communication because you can't have in

[01:07:40] during a period like this everyone chiming in and trying to either defend the company

[01:07:45] here or like like I just saw even like every time Hilton says I wouldn't get a refund

[01:07:50] you know what that does it makes more people want refunds yeah for sure you know and

[01:07:56] every I think people would calm down because it is like right now this this she'll keep

[01:08:03] the thread popping up to the top constantly and if they all just went quiet and the investors

[01:08:08] say look there's going to be a month of calm I we figured this out you know what would

[01:08:13] happen people would just like stop yelling at each other for a month and let them figure

[01:08:18] it out.

[01:08:20] What they really need to do is Martin has been into the from him on news he's been in there

[01:08:25] to see the game and he flipped on it they said to have him back and say he's will love

[01:08:30] us sit down with him clear all the air let Martin ask whatever questions he wants to do ask

[01:08:35] him honestly and then say there's our statement there's our story here's where we move forward

[01:08:41] and and rebuild from there but they leave a lot of speculation open that's why I think people

[01:08:46] are asking to bail now who knows how much health they brought to the company with their you

[01:08:52] know combined investment is it going to be enough to start building games now or do they need

[01:08:58] to generate new orders if everybody pulls their money can they move forward I think there's a lot

[01:09:03] of questions that need to be answered and someone like Martin I think would be really fair he'd

[01:09:07] hold him accountable for things but he'd also give him a chance to explain it but then from then

[01:09:13] low-equally said forward yes one one voice one channel communications it all runs up through

[01:09:18] whoever that may be but it's crazy what has been allowed to get out there what they're what who

[01:09:24] they're going to need to hire sounds like and I don't know who this person is but they need to hire

[01:09:28] their George Gomez their their Jersey Jack they need to hire the new leader of the company and

[01:09:36] put that person in place and I look I wouldn't be surprised if these guys are really serious I think

[01:09:42] they're going to have to find an industry veteran who knows a lot about manufacturing at pinball who

[01:09:49] brings maybe some credibility and knowledge I think that would be their best bet but again like

[01:09:53] it's like so hard to find those people because they don't exist like they're they're they're

[01:09:58] situated in their pinball companies so we'll see what happens so let's go over to the other the

[01:10:05] other European sort of powerhouse that just can't seem to figure it out so Dutch pinball where are

[01:10:11] they now I mean they're just sort of they they won't accept the deal they publicly through a

[01:10:17] or a and the parent company under the bus with their last communication so it seems like the only

[01:10:21] option they have is to sue yeah and I I from what I understand the law isn't really on their side

[01:10:31] though right like I don't know every time I hear people talk about that the law in in Holland or

[01:10:38] Netherlands and I can't quite figure out you know there you get like one chance to go to court you

[01:10:44] got to build your case for a long period of time there's all this like European pride and they'll

[01:10:51] be shamed by the Dutch public I make I what I can't figure out is this if they have a contract

[01:10:57] that says you're going to build me these games at this price and then the bill they got wasn't that

[01:11:04] price what why isn't in why isn't this just like an opening closed case yeah that's what I

[01:11:10] understand because I don't know why it matters to a ray that the that their own cost inside changed

[01:11:20] I mean if someone contracts with me to do work and I give them a number and I find out that I

[01:11:26] spend more time on it than I anticipated I'm not going to ask them for more yeah it's cost my bad

[01:11:33] but uh or you hit or you say or Jeff you tell them hey you know maybe before you reach the like

[01:11:40] the budget limit you say hey this might go over um do you have more you know can we can we

[01:11:48] renegotiate but that typically doesn't really happen in our industries you usually just eat it

[01:11:54] but but at some point you know I wonder what the actual

[01:11:59] cost per game increase was I think we heard that it was something like 1100 euros or something along

[01:12:06] those lines um if that was the case I still think all the buyers of Lebowski would have chipped

[01:12:12] in 1100 dollars more just to get their games and get things going again so I kind of feel like

[01:12:18] it might have been more than that even I don't know it's hard to tell yeah that's the other thing too

[01:12:24] is like highway they kept stringing people along because what I don't understand is why they

[01:12:30] keep doing this like it took so long for the story to come out and it really came out because people

[01:12:35] found back channels into ARA to get you know word of what was actually going on so knowing that

[01:12:42] that is eventually going to get out I think you just need to explain this situation for me or

[01:12:47] and first and say hey guys we're getting bullied around here's our situation um it sucks for

[01:12:53] us to really ask for more money but here's the options either we sit around and wait till exchange

[01:12:58] rates improve so the money that was paid up front is worth a bit more or we just simply have to

[01:13:04] ask for more money like there's no other option because the law there in the Netherlands is that

[01:13:09] if you have an asset of someone who owes you money you're able to claim that asset so that's

[01:13:16] essentially what they've done is they've claimed their machines as their own now because Dutch owes

[01:13:21] I wonder if anyone in ARA is like just taking it home for the weekend and like open to the box you know

[01:13:26] like it's probably going to be like rare heroes game two this is the one they passed around like

[01:13:31] with in the company by the time he gets it it's going to have like dead coil stops and all that

[01:13:36] stuff that's in place on it so but if that's the situation though like 1100 per game um I get it

[01:13:45] like you're you're really in a bad situation you can't really float that um unless people have paid

[01:13:52] in full then you know I could see getting them getting in the first wave released and then say

[01:13:59] for pending orders where people just have deposits in say guys here's the reality of the situation

[01:14:05] for people who paid up front we honored that for people who have money in uh we're not going to be

[01:14:10] able to get the rest of the games released unless we pay more if you're willing to pay more for that

[01:14:14] we can get your game right away um if not you know feel free to get your deposit back from your

[01:14:19] distributor and we'll continue to work you know with our manufacturer but it seems like Dutch either

[01:14:26] wanted it all or they're okay just keeping things tied up they they they don't seem like they're

[01:14:33] trying real hard to compromise right and then and then just the completely mind boggling

[01:14:39] bop 3.0 announcement at expo just sort of was it an expo or tpf I forget was a tpf it was

[01:14:47] a tpf yeah yeah that see to me that was the moment where I I just would have like got up and walked

[01:14:54] out of the room and been like never again with these guys because it just showed a complete lack of

[01:15:01] common sense and completely tone deaf to like where their company was at and you know when you

[01:15:08] when you display a level of of idiocracy within business I don't know sometimes I just feel like

[01:15:12] there is a past there's a point of no return with regaining credibility which is where they need

[01:15:18] it to be at that moment and at that show they had a moment to try and restore some credibility

[01:15:24] and and that that would have been the moment where I said like here's here's the financial

[01:15:28] reality and how we can get the games made and and and lay out those options you talked about Jeff

[01:15:33] instead it was just like this like really weird sort of another project we're working on that

[01:15:39] and hey and guess what the prototype is locked at a.r.a and you're just like are you guys even here

[01:15:45] with your sound like it's not going to work so I look I I'm I used to think like a month ago that

[01:15:56] actually Dutch was in a better position than highway because at least like a raise like a professional

[01:16:01] manufacturer and if they could just get a deal signed they would be okay and and I know the deal

[01:16:08] they got offered was probably pretty terrible but I also think they probably just should have

[01:16:12] taken it because it because I don't think the option to sue is going to work and if it does it

[01:16:20] could drag out in the court systems for months if not even year sometimes these kinds of cases so

[01:16:26] not looking good not looking good for big Lebowski owners out there and it's a really it's

[01:16:31] really a shame yeah I don't on current paths I don't see any way that it resolves

[01:16:40] it's just and again it's one of those situations I don't know any of the Dutch pinball guys

[01:16:45] personally people come out and say well they're a good guy well a good guy can make the worst

[01:16:50] business moves ever it doesn't it doesn't help the situation that he's a good guy so I

[01:16:56] Steve Jobs was an asshole like I would have given him all my money like night business

[01:17:01] you know it's like people want their products when when they put when see the thing I had with

[01:17:07] their last correspondence where they're like option A is we take the deal and you get your game

[01:17:12] option B is we don't take the deal and we we we maintain Dutch pinball's ability to make

[01:17:18] future games and stay in business everybody wanted option B and it's like bullshit they wanted

[01:17:24] option B like nobody would have voted for option B who has money in on the game and just wants big

[01:17:32] Lebowski and I think they again that was another example of you know they're just making stuff up

[01:17:37] they're they're making stuff up to sort of justify their decision and trying to buy time and

[01:17:43] so speaking of not eating to buy time Jeff you have and we're coming up on an hour but I want to

[01:17:49] talk about your your decision to get a Ruby Red Wizard of Oz and and how that came to be and when

[01:17:54] and how the game is going yeah so that was that was a pretty quick decision actually so I've

[01:18:02] always liked Wizard of Oz I I've always kept my eye open for a deal and with the last couple

[01:18:13] of updates of stuff as I'd gotten more chances to play it I was just like okay if I see a good deal

[01:18:18] I'm in on it and I showed us some video of it to my wife just hey like hey what do you think about

[01:18:25] this and she said that looks awesome go get that game so I think it was the day after she said that

[01:18:34] as she was half asleep on the couch so maybe I took a little advantage of the night night drunkenness but

[01:18:42] there was someone who just lives a little bit north of me that had them for sale and I jumped

[01:18:48] up there and grabbed it and brought it so now I already didn't have room for that and I'm

[01:18:53] have dialed in coming soon so I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to deal with that at this

[01:18:59] moment but it was just one of those deals that I figure out the small details later but get the

[01:19:04] machine in hand so right I haven't had much time to play it though I've been really busy with

[01:19:10] other stuff but my wife and kids have liked it so far so that's good so do you have all your pins

[01:19:15] in in one game room I actually have them split there's a hallway between them so like in one

[01:19:22] game room I'm actually sitting close to it now I've got six games I have room for maybe one more

[01:19:29] if I move out the little popcorn machine and then I have a back room that right now has

[01:19:35] five more plus some arcade games they're both you know in the basement and close to each other but

[01:19:42] there's a little bit of a hall that connects them and then like the worst of us at our hobby I've got

[01:19:48] like four up in the garage right now and I keep one at my brother's house so it's it's bad

[01:19:54] right I mean once you start keeping games at other people's houses too that's when I I always say like

[01:19:59] my rules I don't want to be storing stuff and I got lucky I mean I moved all my arcade games out

[01:20:03] of my my bedroom my bedroom arcade is gone it's it's an empty I'm sitting in an empty room right

[01:20:08] now waiting for this renovation to happen in this apartment because I had to do the floors over

[01:20:13] and there's just like no way I could move those arcade machines around while doing the floor

[01:20:20] in the in the apartment and I was just ready for a change of pace and plus I'm into pinball now I

[01:20:23] don't even I didn't even play the arcade games to be honest I'm I'm more of like an Xbox and

[01:20:28] PlayStation guy anyway right now so yeah a fellow pin cider friend is is holding on to all my

[01:20:36] arcade games free of charge he he gets the games and I don't I don't have to pay a storage fee so

[01:20:40] that was a good arrangement but yeah I mean I kind of like having space as an excuse not to go

[01:20:48] crazy because I feel like I would just go get dialed in I'd get Star Wars I'd have Ghostbusters

[01:20:55] probably I'd have Batman I would probably just go in and all these things and I don't know I'd

[01:21:03] like that I can only have maybe two to three at most and I it it helps curve this hobby from

[01:21:11] taking too much of my life over although this podcast probably takes an inordinate amount of time

[01:21:17] away from my life and my other things that I should be doing probably that would would sort of

[01:21:24] advance me as a human being in different ways like I could be reading books I could be watching

[01:21:29] documentaries I could be hanging out with Brenda but you know I think I think I love talking

[01:21:36] about pinball on a weekly basis and I think the listeners do too and Jeff I really appreciate

[01:21:39] you joining I mean this is this has been great I mean we've been wanting to do this for a while and

[01:21:44] I mean if you ever want to come on to anytime I know you got your podcasts and

[01:21:48] you do it every two weeks if there's every any time in between your recordings you're like you

[01:21:53] want to just join just let me know and I'm happy to have you on I love talking to people who are

[01:21:58] you're you're in it like you know everything that's going on so I don't have to like

[01:22:02] poll answers out of you I know you're up to speed as much as anyone on Pinside and in the hobby so

[01:22:08] it's been great talking about this stuff yeah I boy I never run out of desire to talk pinball so

[01:22:16] that works for me too so yeah for sure and Jeff and I are like a testament right we we used to

[01:22:23] butt heads all the time and we used to like be like you're a jerk you're a jerk you're an asshole

[01:22:28] they were like wait a minute like we both love pinball like we're like in the 0.001% of the

[01:22:33] planet that actually gives us shit about this stuff and you know I think we're at a time now

[01:22:40] too we're seeing a lot of people arguing back and forth right and there's a lot of

[01:22:45] angst in the hobby with what's been going on with some companies and I do implore everyone to sort of

[01:22:51] take a deep breath and realize that if you're angry at a manufacturer who's like kind of stiff

[01:22:56] in you and there's certain people you should be mad at that's fine but you know try not to take

[01:23:01] it out too much on certain individuals and in the forums not worth getting so riled up about

[01:23:08] sometimes it's good to just like turn it off for like a few days and come back and realize

[01:23:13] you know it's just pinball definitely get get the blood pressure

[01:23:19] to normal levels before you react uh hey that helps

[01:23:24] he's got to put health and on ignore and you'll live 10 years longer

[01:23:30] it's the way it works well Jeff thank you so much and I'm sure we're going to see probably

[01:23:34] Star Wars video tomorrow and and the thread will blow up again but um this has been great and

[01:23:40] we'll do it again soon and everyone um if you're looking for other pinball podcasts out there I do

[01:23:46] recommend a Jeff's podcast the pinball podcast he's been doing it for six years now which is

[01:23:53] incredible um I listen to every show um and you know I I think um it's one of the better pinball

[01:24:00] podcasts out there so I hope you guys who listen to this show also tune into Jeff's podcast

[01:24:06] yeah it's at least top 10 there you go I love on pinside just oh just final I heard from Robyn

[01:24:12] today my lifetime ban on pinside will be upheld I will not be allowed back on the site

[01:24:19] uh the tribunal did not go in your favor they did not go in my favor and and apparently the reason why

[01:24:25] um was I've been underplaying why I was banned in the first place it wasn't just my

[01:24:31] trollish comments around the hobbit and I've been honest about this it was also my dickish behavior

[01:24:37] to uh some vulgar emails I had sent to to robin and pinside moderators during what I like to

[01:24:43] call the dark ages of canada um which was a while ago and I've moved on from that uh I thought we

[01:24:50] bird the hatchet but I guess you get I guess some emails are just too tainted to ever forgive so

[01:24:56] I can be I this is saying in me can come out in pretty nasty ways at time I feel like when I'm

[01:25:00] drinking so uh so sorry robin and sorry pinball moderation staff I I I respect your decision

[01:25:08] and you won't hear me ask again but for my listeners out there who have been lobbying for me to come

[01:25:13] back I just hate to break the bad news to you that it's just never gonna happen this is just

[01:25:18] gonna be uh just gonna be a separation that we have to live with and you know life goes on

[01:25:24] we'll get through these dark days we we will Jeff we will well Jeff have a great night um and I

[01:25:30] look forward to talking to you on a daily basis we talk all the time on Facebook so it's gonna be

[01:25:34] fun to see what happens this summer with pinball good time to be in the hobby Jeff thank you for

[01:25:38] being a guest of canada's pinball podcast no problem man thanks have me all right have a great night
