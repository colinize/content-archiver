[00:00] Don't you forget about me.

[00:05] Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[00:08] C-ra-c-ra-c-ra-c-ra-c-ra-c-ra-c-ra-c-ra-c-ra.

[00:12] Oh, welcome everybody to the only pinball podcaster that's been scrubbed from the history books of this week in pinball.

[00:19] We're gonna talk about pinball news.

[00:21] We're gonna talk about what I'm thankful for in pinball.

[00:24] It's not gonna be what everybody else is saying.

[00:26] And then we're gonna talk about this final, twippy drama at the end of this show.

[00:31] But first, I want to give a huge shout out to Jamie over at Wormhole Pinball.

[00:36] Had an amazing hour-long conversation with him.

[00:39] I hope you check it out.

[00:41] I posted it here on Patreon.

[00:42] It's on Facebook.

[00:44] Jamie is a New Yorker like myself, and we just sat and we talked pinball.

[00:48] And it was a heck of a good time.

[00:50] So everybody check out that.

[00:51] It's on YouTube.

[00:52] It's on his Wormhole channel.

[00:54] Now let's talk about some pinball news, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:56] Stern Pinball, they finally figured out how to get Stern Insider connected into app format for your phones.

[01:04] And that's good news.

[01:05] You know, we don't really talk about insider connected very often,

[01:09] but it is probably one of the greatest innovations that has hit pinball in the last 1,000 years.

[01:16] Because it gives everybody something to strive for.

[01:19] It connects the community in a really great way.

[01:22] It gives operators a great opportunity to reward people for playing games on location.

[01:27] I think they need to amp that part up, you know, like you go to a machine and you set a high score,

[01:32] and maybe you get like free drinks and nachos.

[01:34] I'm not sure if people are doing stuff like that with Insider connected.

[01:38] The next great river they need to cross over at Stern Pinball with the connected stuff

[01:43] is they need to get head to head gameplay much more into these games.

[01:46] Like they need to make it so there's like co-op modes.

[01:49] They need to make it so you can battle against your friend who also owns a Foo Fighters

[01:53] or a Ninja Turtles or a Star Wars.

[01:56] Like they need to figure out a way to do player versus player with pinball machines.

[02:01] It's a lot of fun.

[02:01] If you've ever played like head to head on Multimorphic P3,

[02:05] their head to head game like is really fun.

[02:07] I mean, I don't really say a lot of nice stuff about Multimorphic,

[02:11] but when they have those two games linked up with each other at the shows, it's a heck of a lot of fun.

[02:15] All right, what else is going on?

[02:17] We also heard that Stern Pinball is going to have some delays with their manufacturing.

[02:21] They have pushed up the two week schedule in which they take their winter break.

[02:25] Normally it's in January.

[02:27] Now it's going to be the last two weeks in December.

[02:29] So it is really starting to look like we are not going to see Keith Elwyn Jaws at the end of the year.

[02:36] And I'm not even sure now we're going to see it in January.

[02:39] I think we might see it in February.

[02:41] If we think about the day that they launched Foo Fighters,

[02:44] remember it was in February and they came out in front of everybody and they shocked everybody

[02:49] with that early February launch of Foo Fighters and they were like the first game to show, right?

[02:54] As we were getting excited about TPF, Stern swooped in and scooped everybody with Foo Fighters.

[02:59] Will we see the same thing with Jaws Pinball?

[03:01] Now, if you think about Jaws from a marketing standpoint,

[03:04] it's a movie about summertime at the beach and a great white shark.

[03:08] So is the best time of year to launch Jaws Pinball in the winter?

[03:11] Or should you wait till it starts to warm up a little bit and it's safe to get back into the water?

[03:16] We will see what happens when this game comes out.

[03:19] All eyes are on this game.

[03:20] Everyone is expecting big things from Keith Elwyn.

[03:23] So we shall see what happens with Jaws Pinball.

[03:25] I'm going to give you a rumor right now that I'm hearing.

[03:27] I'm hearing that Jaws Pinball might be the first time ever that Keith Elwyn puts an upper play field into one of his games.

[03:35] Will this be true or not?

[03:37] And if you think about Jaws, what would the upper play field be?

[03:40] You know, I think it might be a ship.

[03:41] If they're going to do anything, make it the orca, you know, like the pirate ship and pirates of the Caribbean that rocks back and forth.

[03:48] How cool would an upper play field be that is the orca?

[03:52] And as the ship is taking on water, it starts to lower and sink into the ocean.

[03:56] How cool would that be?

[03:58] You know, every time I dream about the mechanical possibilities of what could be in a future stern pinball machine,

[04:04] every single time we are sorely disappointed.

[04:07] I mean, Godzilla was cool and all.

[04:08] Don't get me wrong.

[04:09] But come on, man, they made a Godzilla pinball machine in which Godzilla physically does nothing.

[04:15] Now, look, I know people are like, well, you're playing as Godzilla and that doesn't make much sense.

[04:19] Because if Godzilla was standing over a pinball machine, his arms would never reach the flipper buttons.

[04:24] All right, so we've got that.

[04:25] We've got delays at stern pinball.

[04:27] We're going to push back the Jaws date.

[04:29] It's not going to be December.

[04:30] So that means really the only thing that's going to happen between now and the end of the year is either we're going to see pulp fiction games start to get on the line.

[04:38] I want to give a shout out real quick to Mr. Ryan White.

[04:41] He called me up yesterday all off the record.

[04:44] But basically, he said, Chris, I want to let you know what they did to you by removing you from the database was absolutely wrong.

[04:50] And I reached out to all the committee members over there to tell them, even though you talk so much smack about me and C.G.C.

[04:56] I just want to let you know that ethically, I found that to be very problematic.

[05:01] So thank you, Ryan, for the support.

[05:02] I really do appreciate it.

[05:03] And I did ask him, when are we going to see pulp fiction games?

[05:07] And he gave me some vague answer like someday soon.

[05:10] So I'm not sure what soon means in the world of C.G.C.

[05:13] But I also heard from him that they most likely will not be eligible for a twipe, which means games will not be shipping before December 1st or November 30th, which also means that pulp fiction will not be eligible to win favorite pinball topper of 2023.

[05:30] And I think that's a shame.

[05:31] I'll tell you why.

[05:32] I mean, the toppers not going to change, right?

[05:35] Like, why does the game have to ship for the topper to win?

[05:38] We've all seen the topper.

[05:40] It's not going to change.

[05:41] It is one of the greatest pinball toppers in the history of pinball toppers.

[05:44] So just make it eligible.

[05:46] You know, I had any advice.

[05:47] Well, I've got a lot of advice for the twipe committee.

[05:50] We're going to talk about that.

[05:51] But if I had any advice for these people, you got to start using more common sense.

[05:55] You got to be a little bit flexible.

[05:57] You got to use common sense.

[05:59] Like it's absolutely stupid that you would open up voting for the twipees to be a month long.

[06:04] If you're trying to mitigate fraudulent votes, the easiest way to do that is minimize the amount of time people have to vote.

[06:12] By making it four weeks long, you're basically opening the door for a lot more corruption in your own voting system.

[06:18] And it makes absolutely no sense.

[06:20] And that is why I don't understand why common sense seems to allude almost everybody who's like in the pinball marketing space, like common freaking sense people.

[06:28] So we're not going to see pulp fiction.

[06:30] You know, people have been starting to sell their pulp fiction Ellie spots and I keep telling people, you know, I would just hold on to your pulp fiction right now.

[06:37] And here's the reason why is still, you know, in a world in which all these games over at Stern, you know, the limited edition games over at Stern that are not truly limited, you know, first of all, if Stern and made pulp fiction, they would have charged you 13,000 for the Ellie.

[06:50] They would have.

[06:51] I mean, think about it.

[06:52] A single level game with no screen.

[06:53] Guess what they charge you for the last time they did that over at Stern?

[06:56] They charged you $20,000 for freaking James Bond 60th.

[07:00] So Stern would charge you 13,000 for the machine.

[07:03] And then they would have charged you another for this topper.

[07:06] They would have charged you $2,000 for this topper.

[07:09] And so you would have been spending on pulp fiction if Stern pinball made it $15,000.

[07:16] And if you ordered it from C.G.C.

[07:17] With the topper, it was like $9,750.

[07:22] I think all of these Stern apologists need to stop making excuses for this company

[07:26] and how overpriced their freaking games are.

[07:29] I would actually argue more mechanically in pulp fiction than is even in like Foo Fighters, Ellie.

[07:35] You know, there's not a ton more even in Venom.

[07:38] The reason why I would hold on to pulp fiction is I think it's one of the coolest pinball themes of all time.

[07:44] It's the only Tarantino movie in pinball format.

[07:47] It's a game that is new and old and classic all at the same time.

[07:51] When you look at this thing, it just feels like it comes from a different period in time.

[07:56] But it's got enough modern stuff in it as well.

[07:59] And I think it's going to be a keeper for a lot of people.

[08:01] And my point is this, why sell it now?

[08:03] Right? The most you're going to get for this game is going to be when the game is out.

[08:07] And I know a lot of people are like hype on pulp fiction is going to die down the same way it died down on Rick and Morty.

[08:13] The same way it died down on Foo Fighters.

[08:15] The same way it died down on every single game coming out right now.

[08:19] And again, the reason why I don't think it's going to.

[08:21] If pulp fiction started at $13,000, then yes, I could see it sliding down towards 10 grand.

[08:28] But because it starts at 9700, I don't think this game is ever going to slide down.

[08:34] Not with that top or anywhere near like 7500 or 8000.

[08:38] In fact, if I were a speculator, I think pulp fiction LEDs are actually going to gain a couple thousand dollars in value because of what they're giving you.

[08:46] So we shall see what happens with that game, but we're not going to get it.

[08:49] So then the next question is what game is going to come out by the end of the year?

[08:52] Everybody wants to see Elton John ship by the end of the year.

[08:55] Look, the general consensus on Elton John, we all know it's overpriced, but we're hearing really good things about the way the game shoots.

[09:02] We're hearing the Platinum Edition artwork is some of Christopher franchise best.

[09:05] The game is a great shooter and it's stunning and everybody wants to buy it for 8500 bucks.

[09:11] But here's the thing.

[09:11] 95% of us have had opinions about Elton John and only 5% of us have actually played the game.

[09:19] And will this game have enough gameplay?

[09:21] Will it have enough code?

[09:23] Will it have enough in it to make people pay the MSRP price for this game?

[09:28] And I just want this game to come out.

[09:30] I'm just worried though that even when this game comes out, I'm not going to be able to play it.

[09:34] There's not even a godfather in New York and I don't know if anyone's going to even order Elton John.

[09:39] I don't think John at Jack Bar is and that's the real dilemma for Jersey Jack games at $12,000 is operators aren't going to buy these things.

[09:48] I mean, it is legitimately, literally and metaphorically, not even metaphorically, literally, it's twice as much money as a Stern Pro.

[09:57] And that's crazy.

[09:58] You have to have 6000 more people to play in Elton John to justify buying it if you're an operator.

[10:05] And then when you go on Pinside, like nobody really is ordering this game.

[10:08] You don't see that many people declaring they ordered in Elton John.

[10:12] So I just hope this game gets out.

[10:13] But I do think the problem for Jersey Jack is the price is always going to be an issue.

[10:18] And then we know that Matrix is next.

[10:20] And I think knowing that is just going to make people wait and see what else is happening by the end of the year.

[10:24] Did you see American pinball this trying to get people to have FOMO around the $17,500 version of Galactic Tank Force?

[10:33] So let me get this straight.

[10:34] You can't sell the regular version of the LE, which was what, $11,000.

[10:40] And you think you're going to sell another version with only 200 units for freakin $17,500, a $6,500 premium to get all these ugly SIGs on the apron.

[10:53] And then it's got a 3D translate, and then it's got a thermos and a lunchbox and a bunch of throwaway posters.

[10:59] And people think about it.

[11:00] Add up all that stuff along with the cheap 3D printed sculpts in the game.

[11:05] Add all those extras up.

[11:07] And all that is $6,500 in value.

[11:10] I mean, that's the price of a Stern Pro machine.

[11:12] You can get an entire pinball machine for the price of this useless junk they're putting onto this game.

[11:19] American pinball is just an anomaly.

[11:21] I don't think David Ficks knows what he's doing.

[11:23] I don't trust what he says about how many orders they have.

[11:26] And there is no way they're going to sell 50 of these things.

[11:29] They're not even going to sell 20 of these things for $17,500.

[11:33] Limiting these to 200 units just shows me how delusional they are and how out of touch they are with the pinball marketplace.

[11:41] I just feel like they should be embarrassed.

[11:43] Like they don't even know what they're doing.

[11:44] All right.

[11:45] So that's what's happening over there at American Pinball.

[11:47] What else is going on?

[11:48] Barrels of fun.

[11:49] They're getting more of these labyrinths out the door.

[11:52] I think the more these games get unboxed, the more they're going to get new orders.

[11:56] But do I think they're going to end up selling all 1100 of this game?

[12:01] I don't.

[12:01] I don't think the theme is that popular.

[12:03] I think they're going to start to stall out around like 650 orders.

[12:07] And then I think people are going to wait.

[12:08] They're going to wait for those 650 to be built.

[12:11] And look, Barrels of Fun said, if we don't get 1100 orders, we will simply cap it at the number of orders we get.

[12:18] So that could be a good thing.

[12:19] It would be interesting.

[12:20] So let's say they cap it at 700 units.

[12:23] If they make all 700.

[12:25] Does that mean they're still allowed to make another 400 because they said the initial run would be 1100?

[12:32] Or will they say we're never making any more?

[12:35] If I'm a boutique company that's looking to create a community of buyers that have trust in me as a manufacturer, I would really play this marketing card.

[12:44] I would say this is how many we're going to make and we're never making any more and we're never making other variations.

[12:51] And this is it.

[12:51] I think these companies need to start building trust.

[12:54] They need to look at the market right now.

[12:56] Like Stern is burning everybody by destroying all of its LE community.

[13:00] Like nobody thinks that Stern LE is special anymore because they keep making new versions of it.

[13:05] And if I'm a boutique company, I would say this is it.

[13:08] This is final.

[13:09] You can trust us.

[13:10] What am I thankful for in the pinball world?

[13:12] Oh, look, you know me.

[13:13] I mean, I'm not going to say what everybody else is saying.

[13:16] Everyone else is going around the horn and they're thanking every manufacturer.

[13:19] And sure, I'm thankful all these companies are around and making all of these games.

[13:24] I'm not thankful for every single game.

[13:26] I don't think every single game is great.

[13:28] I'm not thankful for these prices, but I'm thankful that they keep making new stuff because without new stuff, it would be boring.

[13:35] Observing this hobby, it would be boring speculating on what's around the corner.

[13:39] But what I'm really thankful for other than my beautiful wife and my beautiful family and all the people that support me personally, you know,

[13:46] I'm thankful for my job that allows me the freedom to do my real job and also do this podcast.

[13:52] And I think they supported.

[13:53] They don't really say anything anymore.

[13:54] As long as I'm not hearing from the lawyers, I think all is good with my company.

[13:58] The thing I'm really thankful for is each and every one of you.

[14:02] And I mean that because your support of this show is what helps me get through weeks like the week I just had a week in which once again, they're trying to cancel Canada.

[14:12] Once again, they're trying to label me as the bad guy.

[14:15] Once again, they want to deny me the hard work I put into this hobby.

[14:19] The hard work that I put in is what led to this following.

[14:22] It's what led to you being here.

[14:24] It's what led to me winning an award six years in a row.

[14:27] All of that was hard work.

[14:28] All of that was taking a contrarian stance.

[14:31] All of that was analyzing this hobby in a way nobody else does.

[14:35] So I want to thank each and every one of you because you know what it means that there are 660 of you that are subscribing to this show.

[14:42] You know what that telegraphs to everybody else?

[14:44] That one guy is saying something that we believe in.

[14:48] And so I want to thank you for showing me that validation because it is important.

[14:52] You know, when people get up there and like nobody follows them and nobody's subscribing and they're like, we just do it for the love of pinball.

[14:58] Guess what happens to all those guys?

[15:00] They get very bitter about the success happening over here at Canada's Pinball podcast.

[15:05] So I want to thank you that you don't follow the sheep off the cliff.

[15:09] I want to thank you that you're not a shill.

[15:11] I want to thank you for listening to this show without any incentives, without any giveaways, no bribery.

[15:18] Nothing.

[15:18] You come here without being forced.

[15:21] You showed up at Canada's Pinball podcast and you subscribed and you've been here for a while.

[15:26] Some of you have been with me since day one.

[15:29] Day one when I first put on a microphone and started talking, I think I talked about like Spider-Man and pinball.

[15:35] You know, when I go back and listen to those early shows, like they're rough.

[15:38] They're really rough.

[15:39] I was still trying to find my voice.

[15:41] I was trying to find my way in the hobby.

[15:43] And some of you have been with me for like seven or eight years as I've been doing this podcast.

[15:48] So thank you so much.

[15:50] And some of you have just discovered me.

[15:51] You're like, oh my gosh, who is this guy that everybody hates?

[15:54] Like who is this guy that gets banned from pinside?

[15:56] Who is this guy that everyone is calling negative and toxic and a narcissist and a sociopath?

[16:00] Who is this guy?

[16:01] I'm going to check him out.

[16:02] And then you check out Canada's Pinball podcast and what happens?

[16:05] You can't really go anywhere else to hear this kind of pinball podcast.

[16:08] I'm really thankful for each and every one of you.

[16:10] And I do this show in honor of you.

[16:13] I do it every week for each and every one of you.

[16:15] And every time I lose a subscriber, it hurts.

[16:18] I don't want to lose any of you.

[16:19] I don't want to say something that makes you want to leave the show.

[16:22] I don't want to become a sellout or a shill in a way that makes you want to leave the show

[16:25] because you get disgusted in me.

[16:27] I want to remain true to the very reason why you're here.

[16:30] I want to thank each and every one of you who is starting to wait and see.

[16:34] I want to thank you guys who are not running at every single new game.

[16:38] I want to thank you for starting to analyze your life and realize that the FOMO is a dangerous thing.

[16:43] We shouldn't be blindly bailing out these pinball companies for every single boneheaded decision they make.

[16:49] We will buy their games if they do it right.

[16:52] If they put magical themes in a box in a way where the ball interacts with special stuff

[16:57] and we see the value in the game and the theme itself emotionally clicks with us,

[17:01] we will send our money over there.

[17:03] Sometimes we might send $6,000.

[17:05] Sometimes we might send $15,000.

[17:07] But I think each and every one of you knows this deep down inside.

[17:10] You know the last couple years of pinball have been extraordinarily underwhelming.

[17:16] And yet the prices have gone through the roof.

[17:18] So I want to thank each and every one of you for saying, we're not going to take this.

[17:21] Like this is not good enough.

[17:23] And I want to thank each and every one of you for supporting an influencer like me

[17:27] who's influencing you not to buy the damn product until the damn product is worthy of your money.

[17:34] Because I want to thank each and every one of you for having some self-respect,

[17:38] some self-esteem, not falling victim to all of the sales pitches out there.

[17:42] So thank you.

[17:43] I think my listeners are the most independent thinkers in all of pinball.

[17:48] Like did you see all that shenanigans yesterday?

[17:50] Oh, here are the top five games by all the pinball content creators.

[17:53] Yup, once again, Colin over at the Kinetis is trying to exclude Kaneda.

[17:57] Did you notice who wasn't on that list?

[17:59] And isn't it funny how quickly everybody sells out and makes content for somebody else

[18:04] just to help them in their SEO search engine results?

[18:07] It's so funny to me how everybody folds like a lawn chair.

[18:10] But guess who wasn't on that list?

[18:12] Guess who wasn't going to do work for somebody else?

[18:15] Kaneda wasn't on that list and Jason Napp wasn't on that list.

[18:19] And I'd rather hold company with Jason Napp than all those people that are now just like

[18:23] locking arms and kumbaya and the pinball world.

[18:26] Cool.

[18:26] And I want to thank all those people

[18:28] because the more there is this group think where nobody can be independent,

[18:32] nobody can challenge the status quo.

[18:35] Like how rock and roll is that?

[18:36] Just go along with everything that everybody says.

[18:39] Cheerlead, everything happening in pinball.

[18:41] It is boring.

[18:42] It is not entertaining.

[18:44] It is not interesting.

[18:45] You know, and I do this show and as much as I have issues with some stuff in this hobby,

[18:49] I also have a lot of stuff that I love going on in this hobby.

[18:51] There's also a lot of things that I'm excited about in this hobby.

[18:54] Back to the freaking future.

[18:56] Two games from Keith L when coming out next year.

[18:59] I'm about to get Batman back in my life with Lyman Sheets,

[19:02] the greatest Cody's ever done, Batman 66.

[19:05] I got a Guns N' Roses Collective's Edition that's lost $10,000 in peak value,

[19:10] but I'm still going to unbox it when I get a house and I'm never going to sell that game.

[19:14] I got a Pulp Fictionale on order.

[19:16] I can't wait to get that game.

[19:17] And if some of these rumors are true people, if Fifth Element comes out, I'm buying it instantly.

[19:22] If Bloodsport comes out, I'm buying it instantly.

[19:24] Big trouble in Little China, I'm buying it instantly.

[19:27] But I just want each and every one of you to do me a favor.

[19:29] Just pat yourselves on the freaking back.

[19:31] You made it here.

[19:32] We found our way through this journey together.

[19:35] And without each and every one of you, it wouldn't be what it is.

[19:38] And that is why I'm going to ask each and every one of you for a favor.

[19:41] What happened to me yesterday I took very personally,

[19:44] because I work really hard in this hobby.

[19:46] I've been working in this hobby for 10 years making content.

[19:49] It hasn't always been good.

[19:50] I haven't always been positive.

[19:52] I haven't always kept my cool.

[19:54] I haven't always kept my faculties about me.

[19:56] I've had some bad moments in this hobby.

[19:58] I've had some moments where I got drunk and said stupid stuff on Facebook Live.

[20:02] I had a terrible moment at a pinball tournament where I was hanging out with

[20:05] Lyman sheets and Penny.

[20:06] And I was rooting for Penny and I was kicked out of the tournament by Tim Sexton.

[20:10] And I decided to throw my vodka soda in his face on the way out the door.

[20:14] It's not something I'm proud of.

[20:15] It's not something I wish I did.

[20:16] It's a moment I wish I could take back.

[20:18] I've made some mistakes.

[20:19] We all make mistakes.

[20:20] I've apologized for every mistake I've ever made.

[20:23] But what I won't apologize for is creating this show.

[20:27] And I work hard at this show.

[20:28] And I earned every single vote I've had all these years.

[20:31] And for Colin and Will over at This Week in Pinball,

[20:34] to remove my show from the pinball database of content creators.

[20:38] So when you search, when you search who's won a Twippy,

[20:41] I don't even come up anymore.

[20:43] It's like I don't even exist to them.

[20:44] And the fact that they removed the reviews that my fans like you gave me

[20:49] annoys me to no end.

[20:50] Because I know deep down inside nobody,

[20:53] I don't care if it's Zach Manny,

[20:54] I don't care if it's my biggest detractors,

[20:56] I don't care if it's Dennis Crissel,

[20:57] I don't care who it is.

[20:58] Nobody should be supporting a move like this.

[21:02] Where you erase somebody's existence.

[21:04] And you pretend like they don't exist.

[21:06] And you want to censor them.

[21:07] And it is absolutely disgusting.

[21:09] And the reason why it's disgusting is because it happened by a guy

[21:12] that doesn't have an ounce of the talent I know I have.

[21:15] And you can go listen to his talk at Pinball Expo.

[21:18] And you can decide for yourself.

[21:19] Do you want a guy like that?

[21:21] Being the ambassador for Pinball?

[21:23] A guy like that getting people excited about this hobby?

[21:26] He couldn't even make it through a 30 minute seminar about Pinball.

[21:29] I make it through 90 minutes every Saturday with a captivating audience.

[21:33] And so what I'm asking each and every one of you,

[21:35] this is the year where it's personal now.

[21:37] I want us to get so many votes for the damn Twippies

[21:40] where Colin's gonna have to sink down in his chair

[21:43] when he sees the results of the votes as they come in for the Twippies.

[21:47] He's gonna do everything in his power for me to lose.

[21:49] Over the last few years, think about it.

[21:51] Every single rule change they've made has been made to target one individual.

[21:56] That's it.

[21:56] Every single rule change was put in place to prevent

[21:59] Canada's Pinball podcast from being successful.

[22:02] First, they tried to add the weighted system

[22:04] because I was crushing people with the most number one votes.

[22:07] Crushing people.

[22:08] I had three times the number one votes as everybody else.

[22:11] So then they added in the weighted voting system

[22:13] to try to give people a better shot.

[22:16] That didn't work.

[22:17] Then they said you have to have free shows.

[22:19] Why do we have to have shows that are free?

[22:21] Are the pinball machines free?

[22:23] Is anything else that wins an award at the Twippy?

[22:26] Is any of that stuff free?

[22:28] Are pinball mods free?

[22:30] So why does a pinball podcast have to be free to win the freaking award?

[22:34] Again, another effort by a bunch of cowards who have done nothing

[22:38] but try to change the rules to prevent me from winning

[22:41] and year after year after year after year after year after year.

[22:45] Was that six years people?

[22:46] I win.

[22:47] And what do they do?

[22:48] Do they congratulate me?

[22:50] Do they ask me to take a more positive role in the show?

[22:53] No.

[22:53] Like a few years ago, I went to the show

[22:55] and there was a red carpet special

[22:57] and they didn't even want to interview me.

[22:58] They didn't even want to talk to me.

[23:00] And I get it people.

[23:00] I've been up there.

[23:01] I've been booed.

[23:02] I've been heckled.

[23:03] I've been called every single name.

[23:05] But what I will not be called is forgotten.

[23:07] And you won't be able to forget me, Colin.

[23:09] And you won't be able to forget me, Will,

[23:11] because my fans won't let that happen.

[23:13] And when this ballot drops on December 18th,

[23:16] I want each and every one of you to vote Canada.

[23:19] I want you to get your family members to vote Canada.

[23:21] And the message we're going to send

[23:23] and the principle about this message this year,

[23:25] it's not just about my show

[23:26] and my Saturday morning spectacular.

[23:28] And that's the other thing they altered people.

[23:30] They are really mad because I do a Saturday morning show

[23:33] that talks about pinball.

[23:34] It is a stream for 90 minutes straight.

[23:37] Nobody else can do it.

[23:38] Nobody does it as good as Canada.

[23:40] And now they try to change the rules.

[23:42] They're trying to insinuate

[23:44] that that's me recording a podcast on Facebook Live.

[23:47] And it's not. It's a separate show.

[23:49] It's not my podcast.

[23:50] They don't want me to win favorite pinball streamer.

[23:53] You know why?

[23:54] Because the people who spend all this money on rigs

[23:57] and put up content of them playing pinball machines,

[24:00] they're not happy that a streamer like me can win.

[24:03] A guy that doesn't even have a pinball machine

[24:05] set up in his home could win favorite pinball streamer

[24:08] in the world and think about what message

[24:10] that sends to all of them, to all of my haters.

[24:13] I don't even need a freaking pinball machine set up.

[24:15] And I can make more entertaining pinball content

[24:18] than you can with every single pinball machine

[24:20] in your disposal.

[24:21] And it concerns them and it bothers them.

[24:24] In some low-key TVA multiverse,

[24:26] like these guys are all the award winners.

[24:28] If it wasn't for me, all of them would be the award winners.

[24:31] And I love listening to people who say awards don't matter.

[24:34] And isn't it ironic that the one guy that says awards don't matter

[24:38] is the one guy who had to create his own award show

[24:41] to give himself his own award?

[24:43] And then he wants to say awards don't matter

[24:45] and the numbers don't lie?

[24:46] Everybody sees through this.

[24:48] It's so thinly veiled.

[24:49] And that is why, ladies and gentlemen,

[24:51] this is going to be the year in which

[24:52] Caneatus Pinball Podcast is going to get up on stage in Texas.

[24:56] We're going to celebrate and Colin's going to have to hand me

[24:59] not one, but maybe two trophies this year.

[25:01] And it's all going to be because of you.

[25:03] And I'm looking forward to it and it's going to be awesome.

[25:06] That's it, everybody.

[25:07] And we're going to have so many great freaking podcasts

[25:10] and that's what kills them is they don't even listen to this show.

[25:13] And the final point I'll make is this.

[25:15] I'm tired of living in a world with so many cowards,

[25:18] so many cowards everywhere.

[25:20] They could never get in the ring with me.

[25:22] They could never.

[25:22] I invite all of them to come on my podcast.

[25:25] Colin, come on the show. Will, come on the show.

[25:27] They don't want to come on this show.

[25:28] They don't want to talk to me.

[25:29] They can join me on Facebook Live.

[25:31] None of them will do it.

[25:32] They simply won't do it.

[25:33] They just want to erase me.

[25:36] And the more they try to erase me,

[25:38] the stronger I become people.

[25:39] Can it is like Obi-Wan?

[25:41] Every time they try to strike me down and cancel me,

[25:44] I just come back stronger.

[25:45] Everybody, I love you.

[25:47] And I'll end saying this.

[25:48] The reason why we all have so much to be thankful for.

[25:50] You know, this last year, Brent and I, we lost a child, okay?

[25:54] And I'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart.

[25:56] When you go through a trauma like that,

[25:58] nothing these cowards like Colin could do could ever get to me.

[26:01] Never, never.

[26:02] My parents gave me self-esteem.

[26:04] They gave me an education.

[26:06] They gave me common sense.

[26:07] And they always told me, speak from the heart.

[26:09] Don't be a sellout and be true to yourself.

[26:12] And I think that's what this show is.

[26:14] And the only validation I have that I'm doing it right,

[26:17] each and every one of you are here.

[26:19] Nobody else can do this.

[26:20] Nobody.

[26:20] Look around.

[26:21] This 660 people is more than everybody else combined.

[26:26] So pat yourself on the back.

[26:27] You're a brother of mine for life.

[26:29] And I will always be there for you,

[26:31] making the best damn pinball podcast

[26:32] and the best pinball stream on planet earth.

[26:34] Later.

[26:35] Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

[26:37] La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
