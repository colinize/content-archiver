[00:00] You know, I knew it was gonna be Halloween. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. And that is why I said after Scooby-Doo that spooky's next title was Halloween. And then you know what happened?

[00:29] Can it have stopped listening to his gut? And I had Joe Abate. Joe, I'm throwing you under the bus brother. And he's like, it's absolutely not Halloween. Mike Myers doesn't talk. There's no way they're gonna make a Halloween pinball machine. It's definitely Nightmare on Elm Street. And he had all this like rationale as to why. But I knew that the voice actor who played Dr. Loomis on the recent Halloween movie by Rob Zombie was making a pinball machine that he was only making a thousand units

[00:59] for. And I knew that that was gonna be Halloween. And I should have just stuck with my gut. But it is why on my last guess on my Facebook page I said, spooky pinball will do Halloween. Now we have confirmation that it is in fact Halloween. So we're gonna see the game and we're gonna be able to see what spooky pinball has put into this game. But before we see it, I wanted to do a very quick podcast about the theme itself. Because now we know it's official.

[01:28] We can actually deconstruct what do you think about a Halloween pinball machine launched to the world in July of 2021? I want to say, look when it comes to theme, you know me.

[01:43] My new approach to all of pinball is very simply this. I do not want to buy a pinball machine that is not based on a theme that I love. I don't care how good the machine shoots.

[01:56] I don't care how much is in it. For me personally, I want pinball machines in my house to reflect the things that I really enjoy. Now that is when it comes to a licensed theme. Why would you buy something licensed? That is not a license that you enjoy. Now for some of you out there, you can buy Iron Maiden if you hate Iron Maiden music because you enjoy the way the pen shoots. I'm not like that.

[02:23] I don't want to own a machine that wins on a pinball level, but falls down on a theme level. And I'll tell you why. Because there's just so many exciting themes out there that I would love to own or that I would root for to be made.

[02:37] And I think a lot of us are still rooting for stuff like the matrix, Transformers G1, He-Man, Scooby-Doo, the list goes on and on and on. And when I did my shows,

[02:50] when I did my shows recently where I played all of those different movie clips of things that had not been made yet in pinball that would make for amazing pinball experiences. I didn't have Halloween on there. Now that's not to say that Halloween is not popular. That's not to say that Halloween doesn't have a large following in the horror community.

[03:14] It's not to say that some of you out there aren't extremely excited about this. Now Halloween as a theme. What do I think about Halloween as a theme? It's hard, right? It's hard because I just don't love or watch these movies very often.

[03:28] So I almost have to remove myself from the equation, but I will say if I saw the success of Rick and Morty and you saw what happened when spooky pinball pivoted and made a theme that was more mainstream,

[03:42] made a theme that had more contemporary relevance. Look at what happened with Rick and Morty. Are we going to see Halloween by spooky pinball sell as well as Rick and Morty pinball?

[03:55] And I think from a theme alone standpoint, there's no way there's no way there's going to be the take my money now kind of response like there was from Rick and Morty. But here's the part that's going to be interesting. Do I think this is going to be a better pinball machine than Rick and Morty from a pure pinball level? Absolutely. I think it's going to shoot better. I think it's going to have more in it. And I think it's going to have amazing artwork and everything is going to be spectacularly presented to us.

[04:22] But it's still Halloween and I'm reading the forums. I'm reading people's response to this and I will say this is a very polarizing theme. This is a very, very polarizing theme. It's not a shocking theme from a company that's called spooky pinball, right? It's not like spooky didn't establish themselves as a pinball company focused on spooky themed games.

[04:44] America's most honoured Rob Zombie, Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle. Like everything they've done has been pretty much spooky themed. Rick and Morty is the anomaly. But Rick and Morty is where they've had their greatest success. They could have made twice as many Rick and Morty's and they would have sold twice as many of them.

[05:05] So it's going to be very interesting. Will this be a one step forward two step back for spooky pinball? It's going to be a very interesting market research for this company. I am fascinated to see what the response is to spooky pinball Halloween. Will it be a day one sellout?

[05:23] Now here's the other interesting forces at play right now with inflation where it's at right now. The most affordable games to get nowadays are new in box games.

[05:33] So this is going to help spooky out because people don't want to spend 18,000 on a Jurassic Park Ellie or 21,000 on some Tron Ellie or 15,000 on an Elvira Ellie.

[05:48] With this game you'll be able to get it brand new new in box for the price it's worth for the price the manufacturer considers it worth and it's going to probably have a lot in it. It's going to look gorgeous. I heard the artwork in this machine is phenomenal and I heard the game is pretty loaded.

[06:06] So I do think it's going to be spooky's most impressive pinball machine to date on a pinball level but I just don't know about the theme. I have a lot of question marks about how this theme will do.

[06:18] And there is just the joke about releasing a Halloween theme pinball machine in July in the middle of the summer heatwave right now who's thinking about Halloween.

[06:28] Now that's really where we're at with this. This isn't the theme I would have selected if you want to sell games. So someone asked me right now are you going to buy it and flip this machine and I have to be honest.

[06:39] I'm not quite sure there's going to be the demand for this kind of theme. I'm not quite sure you're going to be able to buy this machine and flip it for a profit the way you could with Mandalorian, the way you could with Rick and Morty, the way you could with titles like Jurassic Park or Iron Maiden or Guns and Rose.

[06:57] Because I just don't think there are more than a thousand die hard Halloween movie fanatics out there who also buy expensive pinball machines.

[07:08] Now but ultimately here's the exciting part about all that this is the market will tell us who's right and who's wrong. The market will show us what people will bear and the market will tell us immediately if this game sells out day one then they made a smart marketing decision.

[07:25] Because it is hard to go from a day one sell out like Rick and Morty and will this be something that does the same. I think this one is going to be a little bit of a slower burn.

[07:34] I don't think you're going to have to like claw over each other to get one of these games. I do think they'll sell everyone they make but I do think it's going to be a title that's going to take them a few months to sell all of them if they make a thousand of these.

[07:48] Now I could be wrong and you could see the gameplay on this thing and it blows everybody away and everyone's like you know what I want to support spooky pinball.

[07:55] I think they do great stuff for the community and the good will that spooky has built up with customers definitely helps them.

[08:02] I would say a lot of people out there regardless of theme might just want to throw support to spooky because they agree with the kind of company spooky is and I can't argue against that.

[08:13] You know buying from spooky makes people feel really good there's small company in Benton Wisconsin.

[08:18] They've improved each one of their games one after another they always are constantly improving and iterating their games and so for some people out there you don't have a problem supporting a company like spooky pinball.

[08:30] But I have to say that the theme of Halloween when I look at all the pinball themes that have come out recently I can't help but think Halloween is a hard one.

[08:41] It's a hard one to get excited about for a lot of you out there and I know they love this movie and I've always said the biggest issue that spooky pinball will run into is are we making games for us or are we making games for people out there.

[08:59] And I do feel like this is a game that's more inside baseball that they're making for themselves because if you do the market research and I mean this.

[09:08] If you do the market research and I saw that Luke over at spooky asked for people to share what they want even in the spooky threat itself even in the spooky threat where everyone was saying what was the theme or what did people hope the theme would be I didn't see a lot of people say I hope it's Halloween.

[09:27] And this is after canada told everybody there's a really good chance it's going to be Halloween nightmare on Elm Street or army of darkness and I will say that the majority of people would rather have nightmare on Elm Street and army of darkness over Halloween.

[09:44] And the reasons why are basically because of the humor of the campiness of both Freddy Krueger and Ash from army of darkness how is this game going to bring a horror movie to life and we're going to see we're going to see now is this a gamble for spooky pinball is this a gamble for them to go all in on a theme like Halloween and it's probably not going to have this sort of like take my money now response of a Rick and Morty the reason why I don't think it's that much of a gamble is if you look at the pinball.

[10:13] Look at the pinball market as a whole I do think any company with a brand new game new inbox that has a lot of features and comes from a company like spooky will sell I do it's not going to sell out day one I would be so shocked if Halloween sells out day one I just would be I would absolutely be shocked if it sells out day one because I still think a lot of people just bought Mandalorian and it's not even you can't even compare Mandalorian to Halloween in terms of themes people want.

[10:43] Right people also know cactus can you remake is right around the corner so I think people are going to wait to see that in July and I just I just don't know I just as the marketer me I can't get excited about a theme like this I need to see the pin I need to see the pin but I will not be buying it I will not be buying a Halloween to flip it I just don't think there's going to be money to be made on this flip and I have to call it like I see it absolutely there's money to be made by flipping guns and roses absolutely there's money to be made.

[11:13] I think if spooky pinball makes a thousand Halloween they will find a thousand customers but there won't be another thousand customers dying to get it that's my point of view on this whole thing the only thing is if the game itself is just phenomenal right if the game itself is absolutely incredible then maybe the theme won't matter and then maybe it falls into that category like Pirates of the Caribbean or I think that's what I'm going to do is I'm going to be like a

[11:15] I think if spooky pinball makes a thousand Halloween they will find a thousand customers but there won't be another thousand customers dying to get it that's my point of view on this whole thing the only thing is if the game itself is just phenomenal right if the game itself is absolutely incredible then maybe the theme won't matter and then maybe it falls into that category like Pirates of the Caribbean or Iron Maiden in which I don't think a ton of people are going to be in the game itself

[11:44] I think a ton of people who own Iron Maiden like love Iron Maiden music and I don't think most of those people who are raving about Jersey Jack Pinball Pirates of the Caribbean are actually movie fanatics you guess why because there's absolutely no assets from those movies in that game but they love it on a pinball level so if this game does something very interesting and something new then who knows maybe this Halloween theme spooky game will be something that people are craving to get their hands on so we'll see I'm excited.

[12:14] I'm excited. The marketer me not a theme I would have chosen but we will see how the game plays more to come on at this week but I just want to do this quick little podcast saying I was kind of right.

[12:26] I wasn't wrong it was in my top three titles I said it was going to be but I really should have stuck with my original statement and I knew it I knew it I had that podcast and then I went back and I told you it was going to be Nightmare on Elm Street I'm looking at you Joe Abadi I'm going to take you to court I'm going to take you to court

[12:43] because you didn't have any information that said it was Freddy Krueger and yet maybe maybe Freddy Krueger is that second game that spooky pinball is working on we shall see an exciting time to be in pinball at least we have new games coming out finally the dam is breaking and we have new options in pinball this summer thank you for listening to this episode of canate is pinball podcast I know it was a short one but it was just for me to say it's going to be Halloween will it sell well we're all going to find out together talk to you soon.
