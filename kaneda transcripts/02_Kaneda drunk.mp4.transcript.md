[00:00] And Kaneda's all in on Guns N Roses, you all should be all in on Guns N Roses.

[00:04] Guns N Roses is the proverbial fuck you to Pat Lawler.

[00:10] Fuck you Pat Lawler, here's what Eric can do.

[00:14] I can't wait. I'm gonna buy Guns N Roses just because it's not a Pat Lawler machine.

[00:20] Fuck you Pat Lawler.

[00:22] Whirlwind, these fucking losers with Whirlwind.

[00:25] Fuck that. Fuck Whirlwind. Fuck Funhaus. Fuck all these bullshit games.

[00:32] Seriously, Pat Lawler made CSI. He made CSI.

[00:40] Washed up. Time to go Pat. There's the door.

[00:46] You don't show Butch Peel the door, you show Pat Lawler the door.

[00:52] Do you know that I heard that Pat Lawler was the one who made CSI?

[00:54] Do you know that I heard that Pat Lawler was the one who made CSI?

[00:55] I heard that Pat Lawler got paid like $2 million for Dialed In.

[00:59] $2 million.

[01:02] Go get that interview, Christopher Franchi.

[01:09] It's not gonna suck, Jody. It's gonna be the best fucking game ever.

[01:17] Kim Mitchell. Kim Mitchell.

[01:21] Kim Mitchell's the greatest man on planet Earth.

[01:24] Next to Kaneda.

[01:34] I was just reading your comment, Mr. Franchi.

[01:36] Here's the deal, people. You all know it. You all know it.

[01:40] Pat Lawler's a dick.

[01:42] Leonard Abis, like, bought Jack's company and pushed Jack out.

[01:48] Jersey Jack Pinball is no longer Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:52] It's like Nantucket Nectars is now made in fucking Korea.

[01:57] Like, the company's done, people. It's done.

[02:01] Jack has zero power in this company. Zero.

[02:06] Jack can't change shit.

[02:08] Jack can't change shit.

[02:10] Jack can't change shit.

[02:12] Jack can't change shit.

[02:14] Jack can't change shit.

[02:16] I'm not hating on the classics, Adam. Wake the fuck up.

[02:18] I'm not hating on the classics, Adam. Wake the fuck up.

[02:20] Jack has two great games. Two. Two.

[02:25] And Eric's Pirates of the Caribbean blows away Wonka and dialed in.

[02:31] So Pat Lawler is ready for retirement.

[02:34] Wizard blocks. Get the fuck out of here.

[02:40] Why do you guys support an asshole?

[02:42] Like, do you understand? Pat Lawler is the reason they fired Butch Peel.

[02:47] Aaron, these aren't corporate investors, Aaron.

[02:51] These aren't investors.

[02:56] These guys don't need to make money. They're not investors.

[02:59] They don't need to get money out.

[03:01] These guys got 1.3 billion dollars.

[03:04] And Aaron, aren't you, like, isn't Aaron part of, like, Fast Pinball?

[03:08] Is that the other Aaron?

[03:12] Funhaus. Fuck Funhaus. Seriously. Fuck Funhaus.

[03:17] Funhaus. Fuck Rudy. Fuck Funhaus.

[03:28] You think Pat Lawler designed Funhaus? Rudy?

[03:34] Where's Pat Lawler?

[03:36] Christopher Franchi, get Pat Lawler on your show.

[03:39] Safecracker. Safecracker was a fucking commercial flop.

[03:44] Let's make a fucking pinball machine for Hollywood.

[03:46] And call it Safecracker.

[03:49] That uses time and not balls.

[03:52] Dumbest fucking idea ever.

[03:55] Safecracker's a fucking joke.

[03:58] Never would have got past Canada's fucking boardroom meeting.

[04:02] Fuck Safecracker.

[04:04] Fuck Banzai Run. Let's go up the fucking Mac box.

[04:08] Yeah! It's great!

[04:11] ...

[04:13] ...

[04:15] He's already won.

[04:17] Pat Lawler? Let me tell you something.

[04:19] Does Pat Lawler strike you as a man that's content?

[04:24] And feels satisfied?

[04:26] He's a bitter man.

[04:28] He's trying to bury Eric's games.

[04:31] He's not happy or satisfied.

[04:34] He's not, like, honestly, you guys got him all wrong.

[04:39] ...

[04:42] The only reason Pirates, listen to me right now.

[04:49] No, listen to me right now.

[04:51] John from Jack Bar.

[04:53] John, honestly, I'm going to tell you, fuck that right now.

[04:55] The only reason Pirates was a commercial flop is because Pat Lawler has now buried the game.

[05:03] People want to buy the game.

[05:06] And Pat Lawler told the investors, don't make any more.

[05:09] So fuck that.

[05:10] That Pirates of the Caribbean would outsell, would outsell Dialed In and Willy Wonka.

[05:17] Maybe not Willy Wonka.

[05:18] I got to be honest there.

[05:20] It would outsell Dialed In if they would make more of them.

[05:25] Pat Lawler's a legend.

[05:27] Patrick, Pat Lawler's not a fucking legend.

[05:30] Michael Jordan's a fucking legend.

[05:33] Axl Rose is a fucking legend.

[05:36] Bill Gates is a fucking legend.

[05:38] Pat Lawler is not a fucking legend.

[05:41] People wake the fuck up.

[05:55] I'm still waiting for someone to tell me why Pat Lawler's a legend.

[05:59] A legend.

[06:00] A legend.

[06:08] Pat Lawler's a legend.

[06:10] Yeah.

[06:12] Yeah.

[06:12] Pat Lawler.

[06:13] Pat Lawler made you Dialed In.

[06:21] He looks like, Pat Lawler looks like a turkey.

[06:24] Looks like an old turkey.

[06:26] Gobble, gobble, gobble.

[07:10] Axl Rose made 500 million dollars

[07:16] in the last few years

[07:17] what did Pat Lawler make

[07:19] fuck Pat Lawler

[07:22] you guys don't get it

[07:24] a legend

[07:25] a legend

[07:27] Patrick

[07:35] you're just like a J.J.P. fanboy

[07:37] see Patrick's like these guys

[07:40] where they just have to suck ass

[07:42] of the company they decided

[07:43] to root for

[08:01] you know I think you guys

[08:03] finally realized the truth

[08:05] of everything is that the

[08:07] Bally Williams

[08:07] engineers propped up

[08:09] all these guys to be famous

[08:11] like

[08:15] okay so if

[08:17] John Papaduke had Adams

[08:19] family it would have been the one that

[08:21] sold 20,000 units it wasn't

[08:23] because of Pat Lawler's design

[08:25] you guys are fucking like

[08:27] just think about that for a minute

[08:28] the Adams family movie was just out

[08:31] that game got put

[08:33] out on location when our kids were in their

[08:35] heyday it wasn't because of Pat Lawler

[08:37] design you guys that that's the thing

[08:39] because when Pat Lawler got to design his

[08:42] own game in modern times nobody fucking

[08:45] wanted dialed in you tell butch I love

[08:50] butch peel I would I would defend a man

[08:55] like butch peel over a hole like Pat

[08:58] Lawler any day butch peel is gonna be

[09:01] fine Pat Lawler's legacy will be what a

[09:04] fucking asshole he was

[09:07] that's all it was Adams family came out

[09:11] at the right moment at the right time it

[09:13] wasn't because of Pat Lawler's design

[09:15] absolutely it wasn't like you think

[09:18] people like oh let's order 20,000 Adams

[09:22] families because of how Pat Lawler

[09:24] designed this game nobody gave a shit

[09:26] fucking Street Fighter you people don't

[09:29] understand this when Adams family sold

[09:31] 20,000 units Street Fighter sold

[09:34] fucking 200,000 units that year so get a

[09:37] fuck out of here because Pat Lawler's

[09:40] design you don't get it people you still

[09:49] don't get it it's a great playing game

[09:52] you think Pat Lawler designed the code

[09:55] of Adams family you think he designed a

[09:58] call-out you think he designed the

[10:00] elements that make that game great he

[10:02] didn't we're going to raise money for

[10:06] butch that's next

[10:07] exactly Tommy exactly any designer at

[10:19] Bally Williams could have designed Adams

[10:22] family

[10:37] the the the the the the the the the the

[10:49] the the the the the the the the the the

[10:51] No, I'm not asleep, Macho.

[11:01] I don't know what to say.

[11:02] I really don't know what to say.

[11:10] I'm tired of wearing a hat.

[11:12] You asked me some questions.

[11:13] I mean, what else is there to say?

[11:21] All right, gentlemen.

[11:29] I'm going to go have dinner with my wife.

[11:36] Over the top.

[11:39] I love that movie.

[11:45] Listen to the new show.

[11:47] Take away a few things.

[11:50] Take away the fact that I'm a man.

[11:51] Take away the fact that Pat Lawler buried Pirates of the Caribbean.

[11:55] Take away the fact that Leonard Abis hired a guy that fucked up all the licensing agreements.

[12:01] Let me tell you something.

[12:02] The next game you're going to be disappointed by is Toy Story.

[12:05] Because Toy Story is going to have none of the assets that you want in the game.

[12:11] Like, Toy Story is going to be worse than Willy Wonka with assets.

[12:21] I don't even understand how to invite Macho Man onto my show.

[12:29] I don't.

[12:30] What does that mean?

[12:33] Ooh, yeah.

[12:36] All right, I'm going, guys.

[12:38] Later.
