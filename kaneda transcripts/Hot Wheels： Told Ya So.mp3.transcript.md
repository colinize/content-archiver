[00:00] Hot Wheels from American Pimball. Let's discuss.

[00:07] Oh my god, we finally know that it's Hot Wheels.

[00:11] Canada said it three months ago, but now it's officially confirmed American Pimball's Hot Wheels is out in the world.

[00:18] You get to see the pictures of it. And here's the thing.

[00:21] I was planning a different podcast. I'll put it up maybe tomorrow. It happened before.

[00:28] This happened. I mean, the world's crazy today.

[00:30] We see Hot Wheels revealed that the arcade or amusement, it's amusement expo international.

[00:37] They revealed the game. Zach Mani's already taking orders on the game. No one's even flipped it.

[00:43] But get your order in. Bye, bye, bye. I love it. I get on the list for Hot Wheels.

[00:48] I wonder how long that list is. Now look, you know that we can't really give you any,

[00:54] anything other than our feedback on what we've seen so far. Nobody's played the game.

[01:01] I mean, people are playing it there, but I haven't seen any video of the game.

[01:05] But what did I tell you was going to be the story of Hot Wheels. I said American Pimball,

[01:13] because of the first two games not doing well, was going to lower the bomb significantly.

[01:20] Significantly on Hot Wheels and what you were going to get is going to be a much more

[01:27] barren experience. Now you look at this game, people, and don't be distracted by all the loop,

[01:33] the loops and all the stuff happening on the art package. Look at the actual physical stuff

[01:40] in this game and tell me that this is not a complete step backwards in terms of putting

[01:49] a bunch of stuff into the game. I mean, the game's got not much going on. It is, because you know,

[01:54] I'm the expert on this. It's a fan layout. It's an absolute fan layout. It's got transparent orange

[02:01] ramps, but it doesn't have the, it doesn't have the quintessential Hot Wheels ramps, which are

[02:07] transparent. Why did they make them translucent? Why didn't they use the Hot Wheels tracks that

[02:13] everyone knows and loves? Are you kidding me, but we're not even going to start there.

[02:17] Let's just zoom out a little bit. Hot Wheels battling dinosaurs. It's a dream come true for all

[02:26] of you people out there. I'm reading some of your pin-side comments right now, and I am like,

[02:31] your standards on pin-side are so low that people are saying this is amazing. Hot Wheels cars

[02:40] versus dinosaurs. I'm the grown man at sleeps in Spider-Man pajamas. Are you freaking kidding me,

[02:48] people? What is going on here? Why is there a triceratops in the middle of a Hot Wheels game?

[02:55] Why is there a T-Rex on the back box? It's like Jurassic Park meets Mustang. Welcome to the world

[03:02] of Hot Wheels. You know, Hot Wheels DNA. I don't understand. I don't, maybe this is like what kids

[03:09] are into these days. They live in a world in which triceratops is and T-Rex is and muscle cars

[03:17] occupy the same space. You know who finds that kind of story exciting? Three-year-olds. Three to

[03:25] six-year-olds really get excited about muscle cars and dinosaurs together at last. And so does bye-bye-bye.

[03:33] Get on the list right now, people. Taking orders today. Now look, now look, this game, here's a

[03:40] here's the thing I want to say. I am so I'm so beyond frustrated that this is how they revealed the

[03:47] game. And I'm looking at you, Michael Grant, your brand new, your brand new marketing and sales manager.

[03:53] How, why is it once again? They know this game is going to be at the show. They know people are

[03:59] going to have cell phone cameras at the show. They know that the first images of their new machine

[04:05] are going to be shared with crappy over the shoulder cell phone picks. How did you not have high

[04:14] res images ready to go so that the first time people see your game, they see it properly. I mean,

[04:21] half of these images, the colors are all washed out. Half of these images, you don't get a full

[04:26] sense of the play field. These colors look like they pop. But in half of the photos that are

[04:31] circulating, they look like crap. So it's just like it just boggles my mind that people who do

[04:38] pinball marketing can't understand this principle. You get one chance to make a first impression.

[04:46] It's not rocket science. Have good images ready to go. Have video ready to go. Now I don't,

[04:54] I don't know if you've seen any video. I haven't seen any video. But you know, we have to only go

[05:00] off of what we've been given. Now there's like this flyer with the game on it. And most of the flyer

[05:05] talks about the popularity of hot wheels and how there's hundreds of millions of fans all over the

[05:11] world. Well, there's hundreds of millions of hot wheels collectors all over the world. This game

[05:16] should easily sell thousands, right? Hundreds of millions of collectors. And so here is the first ever

[05:23] hot wheels pinball machine. The two worlds collide pinball and hot wheels hot wheels and dinosaurs

[05:28] all together at last for your pinball flipping entertainment. What could possibly go wrong, right?

[05:36] So here's the other part I'm looking at this game. And you know, like look, the art package is fine.

[05:41] It's very kitty. It's very hot wheels lunch boxy when people are saying the art package looks

[05:47] great. It's almost like, Hey, dummy, knock, knock, McFly, anybody in there go look at

[05:53] zombie yeti's Deadpool artwork and then look at this and tell me that they nail the art package.

[05:59] This is stock hot wheels imagery dropped and dragged into place to the point where I feel like

[06:07] on the back box instead of cutting off the artwork, they just move the screen over to the left.

[06:13] I've never seen and I've been covering this hobby for a really long time. I've never seen a single

[06:20] pinball machine that has the LCD screen not in the center of the back box. What is happening over

[06:27] ad-American pinball? Who is making these decisions? That looks like a cost-cutting measure.

[06:33] Instead of designing an original art package around the way a pinball machine should look,

[06:40] they move the screen to not block the static artwork unless there's a reason why it's off to

[06:47] the left like that. Now the only reason I can think if you look at the artwork, it's that that

[06:54] orange ramp that loop deloop is going to actually go into the screen and I don't know maybe the art

[07:01] in that scenario is going to carry onto the LCD itself. I don't know. Oh man, but like I'm just

[07:08] and then I'm looking at the one thing I just can't get over this. Canada can't get over this

[07:12] and it's not that I'm having a bad day. I can't get over how ugly the damn American pinball back

[07:18] box is. What is this stupid? We're back to the ugly Houdini back box shape. Part of me feels like

[07:26] they just had a lot of them lying around and that's why they're going with it. The October fest

[07:31] one looked better. We're back to this ugly design. It just doesn't look good. It looks so awkward

[07:40] and it looks weird on this machine. You've got straight lines in the cabinet. Looks normal.

[07:45] You've got all these other like straight lines in a pinball machine and then you've got this weird

[07:50] sort of, you know, curvy back box. Do you like it? Am I just am I nitpicking? Am I nitpicking?

[07:59] Of course I'm nitpicking. This is what I do on Canadian pinball podcasts. And then we get

[08:03] to the game itself. Now if you're just looking at it, if you're looking at it, nothing really jumps

[08:08] out. I mean, you've got a fan layout. You've got three pop bumpers up the middle. I think there's

[08:15] a car that you hit that spins around and there's a vertical upkick that is, you know, as close as

[08:22] we're ever going to get to sort of a hot wheels loop to loop. I don't see any jumping and there must,

[08:30] I think there's an area where things are going to crash into each other. And then there's all these

[08:34] targets on the left side of the game. Let me see. Let me see here. There's I'm trying to find the

[08:40] best picture of people. What are they? They spell battle and then we've got these modes in the middle

[08:46] here. Let's see. You choose to battle creatures, a gorilla, a cobra, a T-Rex, and a tri-Sera. Oh yeah.

[08:57] And there's epic features of ramps, loops, pops, and cars. And you collect all your hero cars.

[09:05] They become hot wheels legends. Okay. And you shots increase RPM for higher scoring.

[09:13] Ooh, it's a score multiplier. Oh, look. Oh my god. I didn't even realize this. Look at the

[09:17] animations on the LCD. It looks like this is from like a hot wheels like cartoon or something. I,

[09:23] I, I don't know what's happening here, people. Hot wheels, dinosaurs, no loop to loop. And, and

[09:31] people on Pinsider are saying it's great. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Here's what's happening on Pinsider right

[09:36] now. It's awesome. Maybe like great effort AP. Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. You're not going to buy

[09:40] one. You know, you're not going to buy one. What? Wait, wait, wait, you see teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

[09:47] Like this is, it's interesting to me that they released this game now because it's like this is

[09:51] the window. They really need to get as many games sold between now and Ninja Turtles being revealed.

[09:56] So get on that list with flipping out pinball. Get on that list. Zach Menys list. It's probably like

[10:01] a post it note right now. A potential buyers, but you better move fast. Now the real question is how

[10:07] much is this machine going to cost? So they have not revealed the price yet. If you're, if this

[10:12] machine is 69.95, it's D O A. Okay. There's no way they can charge as much for this machine

[10:22] as October fest. And if you put this next to October fest and Houdini and I did it, I created a

[10:29] photo. It, and I'm going to put it up on my Facebook page and it is embarrassingly Spartan in comparison.

[10:38] And it's, I'm sure this game shoots fast. It's a fan layout. I'm sure it's going to have speed.

[10:45] It's a little bit like Iron Man. I think it's going to be a lot of, you know, fast ball action.

[10:50] But the real question is just simply this. Do you want to own this machine with everything

[10:57] out there in the pinball landscape? Will you buy hot wheels? Will you buy hot wheels? Will you

[11:02] support American pinball? And that's your prerogative. Not mine. For me, this is a, this game is an

[11:07] easy pass. I'll tell you why. I'm a grown man. I'm 43. I don't play with hot wheels. I'm a grown man.

[11:13] I'm 43. I don't want to do a storyline. That's about hot wheels battling dinosaurs. If I want a game

[11:19] about battling dinosaurs, oh, look at that. The greatest game last year Jurassic Park is available

[11:25] to buy and to play that features an actually incredible T-Rex mechanism that eats my ball,

[11:31] choose it up and I get the incredible Jurassic Park theme song and I get a whole storyline of

[11:37] escaping Jurassic Park. I don't need, and it also has a car in it, which you can bash. It's got the

[11:42] Jurassic Park Jeep that you can bash around and around and around and around. So that's, that's what

[11:46] I'm going to do as a grown man. If I want to have a dyno theme game. If I want to have a car game,

[11:50] here's what I'm going to do. I'm not going to buy anything because as we know, car games don't sell

[11:56] pinball machines must-staying, Viper, Corvette, high speed, never big selling games. Something about

[12:04] car enthusiasts and pinball enthusiasts, even though there's crossover, we don't want to own a

[12:10] pinball machine about driving cars. We'd play Forza or video games about cars and grown men who want

[12:18] to play with hot wheels. Guess what they do? They go by real cars that they can drive and have a

[12:25] hot time in like the Dodge Demon, which you ain't going to see here. Anyway, look, is this a step

[12:31] up for American pinball? Yes and no. How do you not see this and say yes and no? It's a step up and

[12:36] and that it's a license theme. At least we know what we're dealing with here. But this this

[12:42] interpretation of hot wheels, it's like this is the this is hot wheels in 2020, right? It's like

[12:47] the combining of like dinosaurs and cars. Really weird. Wasn't the hot wheels I grew up with.

[12:52] And and so you have yes, a step up in theme, the art package, yes, better than Houdini and

[12:59] Octoberfest, but not saying much, right? Because those are two of the worst art packages of all time.

[13:03] But it's bright, it's colorful. It will definitely draw more attention than their previous two titles

[13:10] from an artistic and color standpoint. I still think the overall package at American pinball

[13:16] needs to be rethought. The back box is just not working. Okay. We have yet to see what the animations

[13:23] are on the screen. If we they are there big question mark is what will the animations be because

[13:29] in their games, they've been pretty mediocre. But overall, overall, this is exactly what I expected.

[13:36] This is exactly what I said hot wheels would be a very stripped down version and at least it's

[13:42] based on a license theme which at least opens you up to a broader audience. Okay. Now I just am

[13:50] not excited about it. What about this machine should I be excited about with everything out right

[13:57] now with everything on the market right now? Because don't forget people don't don't have like

[14:05] short term memory loss. If this machine is $7,000, you can go buy for $7,000, a dialed in LE,

[14:15] a Hobbit Smalg edition LE. You can go buy most stern LEs from the last few years or now that

[14:23] price point. You can go get a Jurassic Park premium brand new for that price point. So just this

[14:29] is all going to live or die by price. If this game is $7,000, good luck. Ain't going to sell it that.

[14:38] This game looks like it needs to be priced at $59,95. I firmly believe that. There's too much

[14:47] competition at the $7,000 plus price point for this game. And again, you're looking at it in a vacuum.

[14:54] You're looking at it thinking, oh, it's a step forward for AP. You're not looking at it next to

[15:00] Ninja Turtles. You're not looking at it next to medieval madness remake. You're not looking at it

[15:05] next to Willy Wonka. When you look at it next to your options, I think you're going to see this game

[15:12] a little bit differently. You know, and someone said like it's it looks better than strange your

[15:17] things. I don't know. Look at stuff next to each other. But anyway, those are my initial impressions

[15:23] on this game. I haven't seen it flip. I don't have an agenda against American Pimball. But this

[15:30] proves my point. When you make your first two games and they don't sell, you suffer. And this does

[15:38] not feel like a big step forward. It feels like a theme step forward. But the rest of it feels like

[15:45] we lost out on a lot on a lot of what they put into their first two games. And it's a total shame.

[15:52] And I'm just going to say it. This should have been game number two. Imagine Hot Wheels with Joe

[16:00] Balls or having the bomb he had with October Fest. That's my final conclusion on this game

[16:08] before we see it flipped. Okay. Other Pimball podcasters will get shows up about this. But that's my

[16:15] initial opinions of Hot Wheels. One step forward. Two steps back. Lowered bomb. Ugly back box.

[16:24] Colorful artwork. Theme that has a large broad audience. But no grown man in his 40s to 60s.

[16:34] wakes up and says he wants to get in a muscle car to go battle. Tyrannosaurus Rexes. Okay. You

[16:40] guys are men, right? Are you boys? You know, I mean, put this next to Rick and Morty where Rick is

[16:45] cursing you out. And you want to go battles a triceratop with a muscle car? What's wrong with you people?

[16:51] Wake up. You're grown men. All right. Can you just pinball podcasts? Number one pinball podcasts in the

[16:56] world. For those of you who want to buy a Hot Wheels get on Zack's list. Bye, bye, bye. Game's not even

[17:01] flipped yet. Sell in spots. Get on the list. Post a note. It's a post a note later.
