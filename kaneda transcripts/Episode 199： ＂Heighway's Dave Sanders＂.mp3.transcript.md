[00:00] Re Hahahaveeeeeeee,完 olive, rusty, hazardous...

[00:15] Warehouse

[00:21] Welcome to episode 199 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:27] Can you believe we're almost at 200 episodes about Pimball delivered to you from New York City?

[00:35] Welcome to the show, AmiHouse, Canada.

[00:38] On this episode, I'm going to air a very special interview with a Mr. Dave Sanders.

[00:44] Dave is the lead designer at Highway Pimball and I know what you're thinking.

[00:48] He's probably the last person on the planet that you would expect to come join the show.

[00:53] After all of the drama and tumultuous history, I think this podcast has had with Highway Pimball,

[01:01] but I have to say this.

[01:02] I have to say this.

[01:03] I really appreciate Dave for reaching out and for having a conversation.

[01:08] Not only about Highway Pimball, but also about the Pimball hobby with me and with you,

[01:14] the listener, because you're about to hear what he says.

[01:17] And look, I've learned a lot.

[01:19] I've learned a lot.

[01:21] And I think one of the struggles I have with this show, and I'm going to talk about it

[01:25] in another context in a few seconds.

[01:27] One of the struggles I have with this show is, my show is dedicated to you, the listener,

[01:33] to the Pimball fan and hobbyist out there who loves Pimball.

[01:38] I feel that I have an obligation to you in reporting what I know about what is going

[01:43] on in Pimball and sharing opinions about the Pimball hobby that I think you may agree

[01:49] or disagree with.

[01:50] Now again, this show is 100% my opinion.

[01:54] Sometimes I have facts about companies that I learn that I will share with you, but again,

[01:58] my obligation is to you.

[02:00] I wouldn't have a listener base if I simply cheerleaded every single company and everything

[02:05] going on in Pimball because I don't believe that everything going on in Pimball should

[02:10] be cheerleaded or just blindly celebrated.

[02:14] But what I've also learned, and this is the hard part for me, and if you put yourself

[02:18] in my shoes, is when I do say stuff about companies that isn't always positive, I have

[02:24] to always remember that there are people at these companies who are working really hard

[02:29] to maybe turn some of those negatives around.

[02:32] And there are people who are working really hard day in and day out to try and make a successful

[02:36] Pimball company happen.

[02:38] Okay?

[02:39] You see, it's easy for me to pick up a headset and a USB headset and stick it in my computer

[02:44] and say something for a half hour and an hour that has an influence and an impact on

[02:51] some of these companies, and it's much harder for them to actually go manufacture Pimball

[02:57] machines, right?

[02:58] It's much harder for them to make a profit and to be successful in what I believe is a

[03:04] very crowded marketplace.

[03:06] Okay?

[03:07] Now, that being said though, that being said, that's life, that's the reality of life.

[03:14] Lots of people make movies and there are hundreds of people who review movies and some of them

[03:19] have a lot of influence on which movies we go see because we trust their reviews.

[03:24] Now I think a lot of you out there trust my opinions about these companies and sometimes

[03:30] my opinions about these organizations may even lead you to buy a game or avoid a game based

[03:36] upon my opinion.

[03:38] Okay?

[03:39] And look, that's again, that's just life.

[03:41] If anything you do, that you put into the public spectrum is open for criticism and critique

[03:47] and also open for praise and adoration.

[03:51] Okay?

[03:52] So, you know, Dave Sanders is working over at Highway Pimball and we all know that Dave

[03:57] and the people over there who are trying to make these alien games get out the door, they

[04:02] haven't necessarily been dealt the best hand by Andrew Highway and they've obviously struggled

[04:07] for years to get production going and get games out the door and we all know the story

[04:13] we know where they're at right now and I think it's good that they are focusing their efforts

[04:19] on trying to get as many aliens out the door and get the quality of the machines where they

[04:24] need to be because it's a very, very difficult time to make people wait and to have delays

[04:31] and to have issues with your product.

[04:33] But above all, above all, the one good thing that they did do years ago is they picked

[04:40] the theme that people love.

[04:42] Alien is a property that a lot of people have a lot of passion for and that is why people

[04:47] are still waiting for this game, right?

[04:50] If this was Mustang or WWE, you would never have people holding on for this long.

[04:57] So I look forward to you guys hearing the interview and hearing Dave explain what it was

[05:01] like going through that rough period and where they are right now and then we also discuss

[05:06] his response to the Twippy Awards.

[05:09] Before I air that interview for you guys, I want to talk about another sort of company

[05:13] out there that has reached out to me because of some of the things I've said and I knew

[05:17] I would get this sort of response and that is P3 and multi-morphic and Jerry is a great

[05:22] guy and I've met Jerry many times at shows and he reached out to me and he basically

[05:27] I'm just paraphrasing.

[05:29] He asked me why I was negative on P3 and he asked me why I would go after someone who

[05:35] put a pre-order down five years ago and Jerry is right.

[05:39] He explained in his email that five years ago the whole notion of pre-ordering a game,

[05:45] it was all about investing in new pinball because at that time all we had was stern pinball

[05:51] and so for people that wanted another option, they really became the investors in the companies.

[05:57] Jersey Jack Ray is something like $6.5 million before people even saw a game and it was

[06:03] a period in time where people were quick to hand over their money.

[06:07] Now yes, it is easy with hindsight being 2020 to look back at that behavior and think

[06:12] everyone who did that was foolish and almost everybody who did that really stood to lose

[06:18] money and probably should have lost money and never got a game if these companies didn't

[06:22] get bailed out.

[06:24] But Jerry also let me know and I agree with this is that P3 wasn't like that.

[06:28] Multimorphic wasn't like that.

[06:30] Jerry's company, they never took people's money and didn't deliver.

[06:34] They never took people's money and lied to them about timelines and when things were

[06:39] happening, I think Jerry's always been a very straight shooter in terms of here's the

[06:44] reality, here's how long it's going to take and we are going to not sort of mislead

[06:50] you and screw you over with any falsities or mistrust.

[06:55] He's not like he's a complete opposite of an Andrew highway who kept coming out and

[07:00] making all these promises that never came true.

[07:03] But at the end of the day though, at the end of the day, the way I look at marketing and

[07:07] pinball and these companies and their chances of succeeding in the pinball marketplace, I have

[07:13] to call it like it is and that's what I told Jerry is, I get that you're building a platform

[07:18] that is in it for the long haul, right?

[07:21] That all the years and hard work and the innovation that you brought to pinball took a really

[07:26] long time and my whole thing is, am I question for all of it and this is not just a question

[07:32] of P3 and multimorphic, it's a question of what Andrew highway was doing, it's a question

[07:36] for anybody out there that looks at pinball and says to themselves, I need to innovate

[07:44] this product if I want to build a successful pinball company.

[07:49] And the reason why I question people who feel that pinball needed innovation is quite

[07:54] simply this.

[07:56] Over the last five years, Stern has sold probably tens of thousands of games and made millions

[08:03] of dollars why these other companies have faltered and flailed and struggled to sell even

[08:10] just a few hundred.

[08:12] So how can you guys who are innovating, how can you convince me that all the hard work

[08:18] and innovation that you've pumped into pinball has worked out is successful and ultimately

[08:25] is what the market wants.

[08:27] And I think the email I read from the last episode said it perfectly, there's a difference

[08:32] between marketing and sales, marketing understands what there is a demand for in the marketplace.

[08:40] And if these new companies understood that, they probably wouldn't have gone off and invented

[08:48] all this stuff or re-engineered or over-engineered pinball machines to the point where there's

[08:54] not even a market demand for that.

[08:58] And so look, content, your first game needs to be something that moves the platform, it's

[09:05] very much like a video game council.

[09:08] Would people have really been into Nintendo Entertainment System if the first game they

[09:13] released with it was track and field?

[09:17] It was Super Mario Bros.

[09:18] That was the first game that built that entire platform.

[09:22] And so when I look at P3 and Jerry and I go back and forth on this, I mean, you're at

[09:28] the point now where, you know, what cart is a little bit ahead of the horse and without

[09:34] a game or a piece of content that really, you know, showcases or makes people emotionally

[09:40] want to invest in the platform, it's going to be difficult.

[09:44] It's going to be difficult.

[09:45] And look, this isn't for me to figure out, this isn't, this is like, if you have a company,

[09:52] you've got to figure it out.

[09:54] You've got to figure it out.

[09:55] And look, you're going to succeed or fail based upon the decisions you wanted to make.

[10:00] And I will call it like it is on this podcast.

[10:03] I'm sorry, but I can't just blindly support any new pinball venture that is out there.

[10:09] My overall opinion about this entire hobby is very simply this.

[10:14] Pinball is pinball.

[10:16] If you make a great pinball machine with a great theme, with great mechanisms, with great

[10:22] flow, with great code, you are going to most likely have buyers for that pinball machine.

[10:29] Pinball does not need to be completely re-engineered.

[10:32] Ball does not need to be reinvented.

[10:36] It's not that there's no market for that.

[10:39] I also have questioned the whole notion of the swappable games.

[10:47] There has never been in the history of pinball a successful example of the whole swappable

[10:53] play field modular system of pinball.

[10:57] And yet we keep seeing people try to go back to the modular system of pinball.

[11:03] While they struggle to create a demand for that, Stern is selling thousands and thousands

[11:10] of games.

[11:11] Chicago gaming will sell thousands and thousands of games.

[11:14] Jersey Jack Pinball will sell thousands and thousands of games.

[11:17] So that is where we're at.

[11:19] Okay?

[11:20] Now look, I hope Jerry finds a great title to show people how great P3 can be.

[11:26] Ultimately, it's up to consumers to decide if they love it or don't like it.

[11:30] Jerry has always been great in going to all the shows and letting people have hands on

[11:34] time with the game.

[11:35] And if you buy a P3 and you love P3, that's awesome.

[11:39] I have a lot of fun playing P3 at the shows.

[11:42] I think the connected games are one of the most enjoyable things in pinball.

[11:48] I think if P3 can figure out how to get connectivity and network the machines, I think that's

[11:54] the real differentiator for the platform.

[11:56] I really do.

[11:57] And I also love the fact that Jerry's built a machine that you can get kids into.

[12:03] I don't think there's any pinball machines out there that are really kid friendly.

[12:07] I think P3, with a lot of the games on it, are the perfect introduction to pinball for

[12:13] kids, especially for kids who spend all day long staring at devices and screens.

[12:18] This has got a huge screen as the play field.

[12:20] I think it's a lot more, how do I say this, like a friendly and approachable for children

[12:28] than like an ACDC would be or the walking dead or any modern pinball for that matter

[12:34] of fact.

[12:35] All right, so that's just where I'm at with this show.

[12:39] It's not easy for me.

[12:41] These are people that I really like personally, but I have to keep it objective and honest

[12:47] on this show or I don't think you would listen to this show.

[12:51] All right, before I hear the interview, one final thing, I keep reading the J-Pop thread,

[12:56] keeps popping up about deep root and this and that.

[13:00] And here's the thing about Robert.

[13:02] And this is the other part.

[13:04] I hear from people who know what's going on on the peripherals and it's not all positive

[13:09] and they have news and they have thoughts and opinions, but everybody always wants to

[13:13] talk to me off the record.

[13:15] They want to tell me stuff off the record.

[13:17] They don't want to tell me stuff specifically.

[13:19] I think partially because they don't want to get sued or they don't want like Robert coming

[13:23] after them and they don't want to have like some millionaire with a bunch of dollars,

[13:28] you know, banging on their door, making their life miserable and I understand that.

[13:31] So, but I also want to just like set something straight and I'm going to say this, this is

[13:37] what I'm hearing.

[13:38] If this is wrong, then I would happily accept an email from Robert or anyone over at

[13:44] deep root to clarify this statement.

[13:46] So I am not saying this is a statement of fact.

[13:49] I'm saying this as something I heard from a Zidware customer about how deep root is

[13:55] dealing with them and I would love for them to either clarify or give me a correction

[14:01] on this statement.

[14:02] So what am I, what am I, what I'm hearing is this.

[14:06] When we keep hearing the phrase for this company to work, they have to make Zidware customers

[14:10] whole.

[14:11] Now the word whole means there are no gaps, there are no like inconsistencies.

[14:19] If you gave Zidware a dollar, you would get a dollar back in something of value, okay.

[14:23] Now, from what I'm hearing is this, deep root is offering Zidware buyers who invested

[14:29] a lot in John's company, 50 cents to the dollar, okay.

[14:33] They're not getting made whole.

[14:35] They are being offered 50% of what they invested in J-POP.

[14:38] So if you gave John Poppiduke $100,000 and you bought 10 razes and spent $10,000 on each

[14:46] of them, this company is offering you 50,000 dollars in credit towards new machines or

[14:52] razes with deep root.

[14:54] Okay, so that's not whole.

[14:57] It's better than nothing, that's the other side of the argument, isn't it better to get

[15:00] something versus nothing?

[15:02] And if you root against them, then you'll get absolutely nothing, so maybe you should

[15:06] take something.

[15:07] You see, it's not an easy place to be in it.

[15:10] And this is the problem with John Poppiduke.

[15:13] And this is the problem with giving John Poppiduke another chance.

[15:17] People just don't understand that John Poppiduke will be the anchor that sinks the ship of

[15:24] any new pinball venture because he carries with him all the bad baggage from the Zidware

[15:30] days and you just can't forget it and move on.

[15:34] Because there are hardworking men and women out there who gave this man money, who had faith

[15:40] in him and he knew when he couldn't finish Magic Girl, he moved on to two more titles

[15:46] and took money on those titles and then delivered nothing to those people.

[15:51] He also paid himself a nice $75,000 year salary.

[15:56] He also paid all these other people to make stuff for him and then delivered nothing.

[16:01] He also took a lot of stuff from people and never paid them.

[16:05] And so, you know, Deeproot saying, oh, they paid off the Coder Apple Juice now, we're

[16:10] good, right?

[16:11] That's not the case.

[16:13] It doesn't work like that.

[16:15] You don't get to go write a check for Apple Juice for $10,000 and then think you have

[16:20] goodwill now with all the people John burned.

[16:24] And that's the problem with Jay Popp.

[16:26] You're going to start a company with four designers and one of which has been a toxic

[16:33] member of the Pimbal community and it's just not right.

[16:38] It's just not right.

[16:39] And I think part of that just shows what these guys do want to be like the bad boys of

[16:44] Pimbal that are going to prove everybody wrong.

[16:46] But again, I think that Jay Popp rabbit hole goes much further than people realize.

[16:51] They don't realize how much money Dovel pumped into John and believed in John and got burned

[16:57] by John.

[16:58] And now Deeproot is trying to just take all the stuff that John worked on with Dovel and

[17:05] American Pimbal and just you just don't get that for free.

[17:09] I love when he said to like he's exercising an option to take it all for $99.

[17:13] And meanwhile Dovel probably spent a few hundred thousand dollars and believed John.

[17:19] But I can't wait to actually sit in a room and try to deconstruct magic girl and figure

[17:23] the whole thing out.

[17:24] I can't wait until John shows them what was actually done on Raza and how Alice in Wonderland

[17:29] all it really is is foam core with zombie yeti's incredible artwork on it.

[17:34] Think about it.

[17:35] Before the man even had a flipping white wood, he already laid down the play field artwork.

[17:40] Just think about that for a minute.

[17:42] The complete opposite of how you make Pimbal machines.

[17:45] So look 2018 and 2018 is going to be a year where I really do.

[17:52] I think it's like when you mine for gold.

[17:55] The companies that are great, they're going to get caught in the pan.

[17:59] All the companies that are just beessing us and floundering, they're going to get washed

[18:04] away.

[18:05] There's just no room in this market anymore for all these companies who are just like trying

[18:10] to make it up as they go along.

[18:12] I really don't have much faith in deep rooted and all that stuff that they're saying they're

[18:17] going to do by next year.

[18:19] I think your faith should be in spooky and in stern and in highway.

[18:27] Highway I hope, spooky, stern, JJP, Chicago gaming, those guys got it together.

[18:34] Highway Pimbal, they've got 2018 to prove this wrong that they can do it.

[18:38] As does Dutch Pimbal.

[18:40] I believe that if Dutch Pimbal and Highway Pimbal can actually figure their shit out, there

[18:46] are people who want to buy those games.

[18:49] P3, multi-morphic, circus maximus with their new kingpin, all that stuff.

[18:55] They're going to have to work twice as hard to get buyers for these machines because they

[19:00] haven't shown that they can really produce games at volume.

[19:02] The same is true of American Pimbal.

[19:04] I think Houdini is phenomenal and I'm hearing phenomenal things about this game from people.

[19:09] Now people that I trust who have played the game, the new game, are saying nothing but

[19:14] positive things.

[19:15] But the only concern is can American Pimbal, can they produce the game and manufacture

[19:21] it fast enough to meet demand while the demand is there?

[19:26] And I'll say this, this is the year where the window is wide open for a boutique company

[19:32] like American Pimbal to be successful because I don't think the titles coming from Stern

[19:37] or Jersey Jack are really going to be like the juggernaut themes of the past or the licenses

[19:42] of the past.

[19:43] So the door is open for spooky, possibly to blow it out of the park with Alice Cooper.

[19:48] The door is open for P3 to show us what it's really about.

[19:51] The door is open for Houdini.

[19:53] This is the year for those companies to strike and let's see what they can do.

[19:57] It's going to be an interesting battle this year.

[20:00] I don't think the big companies pick the right licenses this year at all.

[20:04] I think they're not going to emotionally grip people all the way they think they are.

[20:08] So the door is open.

[20:09] Again, all this is just my opinion.

[20:11] We'll see how it goes.

[20:14] Let's air the interview with Dave Sanders.

[20:16] I hope you enjoy it.

[20:18] Thank you for listening to the show.

[20:20] Thank you to all of you who voted for me on the controversial Twippy win that I got.

[20:25] And again, thank you to all the other podcasts out there for delivering great content to Pimbal

[20:29] fans.

[20:30] I appreciate it.

[20:31] And I know everyone else does as well.

[20:32] Ladies and gentlemen, Highway Pimbal's lead designer, Dave Sanders.

[20:37] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canatus Pimbal podcast.

[20:42] This is like an amazing guest because Dave has been a listener of the show and he reached

[20:47] out to me and he's been wanting to come on for a while.

[20:50] And it's no other than Dave Sanders lead designer at Highway Pimbal.

[20:54] And Dave, I really appreciate you taking the time on this Sunday afternoon for you to

[20:59] join the show.

[21:01] Well, it just seemed like after the Twippy, you seemed like the best time to do it.

[21:06] I mean, there was a particular focus there that we could work on.

[21:11] Like what we take away from the Twippy is because you and I were both on the chat during

[21:19] the Twippy Awards.

[21:21] And what struck me was when they finalists were being read out for each category was just

[21:29] how much our choices overlap.

[21:32] I mean, we both picked ones that were right.

[21:35] We both picked ones that were wrong, but we tended to both pick the same ones and we

[21:40] tended to pick them for the same reason.

[21:43] So I thought that was interesting.

[21:46] And I thought as well, there was a lot that we could like analyze and take away from

[21:53] this.

[21:54] Right.

[21:55] Where I work where things stand with the industry because I mean, you always have a lot

[22:00] to say about the industry.

[22:02] And there have been episodes where I've felt a little bit, you know, disheartened obviously

[22:08] by whatever opinions you had or certain topics that you were getting onto.

[22:17] But at the end of the day, I mean, it's free advice from a guy who's in marketing.

[22:23] You don't get that in the box crunch.

[22:25] Well, I appreciate that.

[22:27] And what we want to do, Dave, on this episode is, and then we were discussing this, is we're

[22:30] sort of going to break it out into two parts.

[22:33] We definitely want to talk about Dave's experience as working in highway.

[22:38] And just for the listeners of the show, this is not going to turn into a bashing Andrew

[22:41] highway sort of podcast.

[22:43] We're going to just talk about the sort of how Dave sort of got involved with highway.

[22:48] And just discuss the past of the company a little bit, where the company currently is

[22:53] sort of where we see highway going.

[22:55] And then as Dave was mentioning, a lot of interesting results from the trippies and the

[23:00] implications, I think, those results have for the industry as we move forward.

[23:04] So Dave, how did the sound of we sort of tackle it that way?

[23:08] Yeah.

[23:09] I'm just going to be me.

[23:12] I'm not here to bash Andrew.

[23:13] I'm not going to do anything like that.

[23:15] I'm not here to show for the present company.

[23:18] That's not what I'm here for.

[23:20] So for the three people who haven't switched over their head to head pinball yet, two of

[23:24] which are us.

[23:25] Let's get on with it.

[23:26] We've got more listeners than that.

[23:29] But I do love Ryan's.

[23:30] Yeah, but yeah, but I'm your guest, okay?

[23:32] Yeah.

[23:33] For me, five years.

[23:35] Right, right.

[23:36] All right.

[23:37] Well, what I wanted to do is like, you know, obviously we've been covering highway pinball

[23:40] for many years.

[23:41] And there's, you know, you've been sort of, you were involved with the company right from

[23:46] the beginning, correct?

[23:47] Yes.

[23:49] So how did that happen?

[23:50] So it's, walk me through sort of, sort of joining a company who was getting build a

[23:55] pinball machine.

[23:56] Like, how did they find you?

[23:57] Like, what got you through the door?

[24:01] What got me through the door was my work in the design, the visual design field primarily

[24:08] through visual pinball because at that point I would have been, I was active with the

[24:14] VP scene since the very early days, since 2001 when it was still in beat of three.

[24:24] And I was among the first people who started jumping on saying hang on.

[24:32] There's all these tables here, all those tables that are out there, all our favorites from

[24:37] so many years ago.

[24:39] And we have this tool now, which has never been seen before.

[24:43] We can actually replicate those tables.

[24:47] Let's do it.

[24:51] And this was, this was raw VP.

[24:53] This was before VPN came along, I think.

[24:56] This is even before the, the whole pin name site came about.

[25:02] So the amount of raw creativity that was there in those first couple of years was incredible.

[25:11] But also not just the creativity, the passion, but also the learning experience because

[25:18] one thing that VP taught me or rather researching to use VP is it was the early days of the

[25:32] internet pinball database as well.

[25:35] And that was a, that was a wealth of resource.

[25:43] Since this was way back in dial up of course, you couldn't make a game that was more than

[25:49] about four or eight megabytes in size.

[25:53] Otherwise, people would start complaining at that in download speeds.

[25:56] So of course, you basically worked with whatever you could get.

[26:03] And that basically meant flyers flyer images from flyers dot some, oh, I can't remember

[26:09] the site.

[26:11] Flyers dot DM, I think it was.

[26:15] Let's still around this.

[26:16] That's different.

[26:17] Very useful.

[26:18] And also, whatever stuff was on the IPDB, which was still, even at that point, I think

[26:23] was still pretty substantial.

[26:27] But it was like, if you had any inclination to pinball at all, this was, this was a gold

[26:34] bun.

[26:35] And certainly I found myself looking at this and saying, you know what, I can fucking do

[26:40] this.

[26:42] And I started to wiggle the stuff that I had to hand.

[26:49] Essentially, I was able to learn from the masters and how they did it.

[26:55] But of course, there's a huge difference between being able to look at geometry above

[27:01] the play field and analyzing what's below a play field and what makes that work and

[27:08] being able to reconcile the two.

[27:12] Because I don't have an engineering background.

[27:15] I am much more creative in terms of, well, partly with concepts, but also with structure,

[27:25] structure and geometry and being able to squeeze space, I think.

[27:32] I mean, that's where I tend to shine.

[27:36] So I work as a part of a team.

[27:38] I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a sort of one man band.

[27:43] I have to have a team.

[27:47] Okay.

[27:48] So you're designing games in the virtual pinball space and then you get the opportunity to

[27:53] physically make a game and full throttle was the first game that you designed.

[27:57] Is that correct in terms of like a physical pinball machine?

[28:00] In terms of the physical pinball machine, yeah, that was the very first one.

[28:03] And what was that, what was that like, that transition from working in a digital space

[28:08] to a physical space?

[28:11] Well, obviously there was a lot more research involved and one thing that Andrew, this is

[28:18] one Andrew was living back in Ireland.

[28:20] I mean, he reached out to me through the UK pinball news groups because he, he'd found

[28:25] my original designs on visual pinball and thought, yeah, we might be able to do something

[28:35] with this if we can plan out a machine properly.

[28:42] And he had ideas in mind.

[28:44] I had ideas in mind.

[28:48] Circus animal house as it became them was actually one of the last, what, last ideas that

[28:54] came about because everything else was either very complex or it would have needed a license

[29:04] which we would have had no means of actually getting it at that point because we were just

[29:12] starting from the ground up.

[29:14] I mean, we have no idea exactly how long it would take as the R&D side of things to really

[29:25] get things going.

[29:26] I mean, we both underestimated that.

[29:29] But also when he first reached out to me, I was not at, I was not at a good point in my

[29:37] life.

[29:39] I was having various forms of anxiety and depression troubles and various other related

[29:45] things that I've never quite been able to get over.

[29:48] I mean, you, yeah, yeah.

[29:52] I'd be very much a recluse in the community because I mean, I'm on the autistic spectrum

[30:08] a bit.

[30:09] And so that, so I tend to focus on the something like the here and now on what I'm doing.

[30:17] So I mean, you can be a project and I'll focus on it.

[30:20] But I haven't been in a position that I need to try to rectify this where I can interact

[30:27] with the community more.

[30:29] But yeah, I mean, the PIMBALL community, right?

[30:32] I mean, it's a very vocal community, right?

[30:35] And people are constantly.

[30:36] Oh, not off.

[30:37] It's probably one of the most vocal communities in the world, right?

[30:39] I mean, everyone's back and forth with each other.

[30:41] They want transparency.

[30:44] So it sounds like you sort of keep a little to yourself and you know, you're focused

[30:48] on the PIMBALL work.

[30:49] So talking about so full throttle, when you guys decided to make that title and I think

[30:55] for listens of the show too, I think what people don't realize about getting a license,

[30:59] it's not just about money, right?

[31:01] It's the company that is going to license the property to you, wants to see that you have

[31:07] the capability to manufacture a machine.

[31:10] So that's why it's easy for a company like Stern that has decades of machines under their

[31:14] belt to go get some of these licenses.

[31:17] So you guys decided to make full throttle.

[31:21] How did that process go?

[31:23] Was it, you say you underestimated how long it would actually take to manufacture a game,

[31:27] like what, what was the initial sort of timeline that you guys had in your heads that you thought

[31:33] you'd be able to accomplish with that?

[31:37] I think the initial timeline was one year from the day we arrived in Wales.

[31:46] Yeah, I think yeah, Christmas 2012 was what Andrew would have liked initially.

[31:57] What was it, talked to me about Alien, so when you inherited Dennis' design, what was

[32:01] that like?

[32:02] Would it have been easier to start from scratch or was it nice to have like him sort

[32:06] of lay the groundwork?

[32:08] Laying the groundwork for that game was, I don't think I could have done it half as

[32:15] well, if at that point, if I hadn't had had some groundwork to actually go on, because

[32:24] Alien was always going to be Andrew's team.

[32:27] It was never going to be mine.

[32:30] I mean, full throttle wasn't mine either.

[32:35] It just kind of became that way after the feedback that we were getting was we had created

[32:43] not just a fast game, but a fast wide body.

[32:50] So people were saying, well, what you really need to do is put on a theme that has, that's

[32:58] about speed.

[33:00] Okay.

[33:01] And Andrew, when he was younger, he actually, he actually raised cars.

[33:09] So I mean, he's still a bit of a boy racer even now, but that was his, that was one of

[33:17] his big passions was cars and racing.

[33:21] So of course, he jumped at the chance to do something like that.

[33:25] I mean, I had absolutely no interest in that sort of thing myself, but he said that,

[33:30] well, if we do it, we bike, that's at least something a little bit different and I went,

[33:35] yeah, all right.

[33:37] Okay.

[33:38] I mean, full throttle, the difference between full throttle and alien as far as designs go.

[33:44] I mean, that's not, I mean, I'm not talking about themes.

[33:47] I'm talking about raw design.

[33:49] With full throttle away, I approached the design for that game was, okay, this is obviously

[34:00] going to be the game with the most limited budget that we would ever do.

[34:06] So there are certain limitations that we have straight off the bat.

[34:10] We only have two flippers and you stand at pop up, sling shots, whatever.

[34:19] It's a case of what can I do with this that isn't going to be your traditional fan shop

[34:25] layout.

[34:26] I mean, what can I do that's different from this?

[34:32] And John Popper Duke, I think this might have been a little later, but it's certainly

[34:38] person.

[34:39] I mean, this is before the whole magic girl stuff.

[34:43] John Popper Duke did actually give me a little bit of advice at one point.

[34:47] It's like the shot geometry from the flippers.

[34:50] You have your flippers in the fact that in the standard places, the angles that you can

[34:56] shoot from those flippers never change.

[35:00] What you can change is the places where the ball from those flippers isn't going to go

[35:06] on its own.

[35:07] That means the in lanes and the out lanes and in particular with a wide body.

[35:13] You've got that much space on the bottom left and the bottom right, but normally you can't

[35:18] shoot at and you've got to find some way of filling that space.

[35:24] So those are the places where you can go basically nuts and give the player something new there.

[35:35] I mean, that's certainly the ethos that Jersey Jack took to heart with Wizards of Oz.

[35:41] I mean, they were all over that with the bumper in the left out lane.

[35:46] I don't think that had ever been seen before.

[35:49] Oh, yeah, the the the toad.

[35:51] Yeah, the the the the.

[35:54] Yeah.

[35:55] Okay.

[35:56] So what I saw with what I saw with full throttle, what I could do was I've done my research research

[36:02] on the two flipper games is I had seen plenty of games with a third flipper and a loop shot.

[36:10] I mean, it's a loop back to the flipper.

[36:13] It's a very standard thing on your typical three flipper game.

[36:17] One thing I had never seen though, or at least I had not seen any examples of this in the games that I'd looked up.

[36:24] I had never seen a two flipper game that had done the same thing.

[36:28] A shot where from the bottom flipper, you could shoot the ball into the loop.

[36:34] And that loop would carry the ball back to the same flipper at the bottom instead of a shot from a flipper up at the side.

[36:41] So I thought, okay, I'm going to figure out a way to do this.

[36:47] Build the loop shot as the shot of the game, which it turned out to be because everybody loves that shot.

[36:53] And then everything else that's going to be the central thing that the rest of the design builds up around.

[36:58] So it's a case of that was the starting point for the full throttle design.

[37:10] And the starting point with A and obviously was what Dennis had actually done because having that meant I had some focus to work with.

[37:24] It meant I could look at that and I could see, okay, what ideas on this do I think are going to work?

[37:33] What ideas do I think need to be revised?

[37:40] How can I sort of like tweak the geometry and do everything so it works as well as possible?

[37:46] And also it's a case of, well, what does Andrew want with this game?

[37:49] Because Andrew as far as the game concept when Andrew was very much the driving force behind Alien.

[38:00] So it's a case of what I would do differently, I think, with Alien now.

[38:09] If I was coming to Alien again, I mean, I would still create the same game, I think.

[38:19] But one of the mistakes that we did in those early years as far as it was a case of try to save as much money on the short term as we could.

[38:37] What that ultimately meant was we'd end up spending that money anyway in the longer term.

[38:45] And unfortunately that crept into the Alien design as well because I was thinking once we have the Genoahead, once I knew that there was going to be a big central toy.

[38:57] I was thinking, well, how do I save money elsewhere?

[39:01] What's going to look good that can be done for cheap, but he's still going to be effective.

[39:07] So that's how things like the platforms came about. But what I hadn't considered that was, it's not just about money.

[39:14] It's also about things like how easy it is to construct from a manufacturing basis on an assembly line.

[39:23] So when I did the platforms, oh, it took ages to get those platforms right to a point where somebody could come along and act and with just the minimum of instructions say, okay, put this together, put this together, put this together and all these bits.

[39:37] So one thing I would definitely do would be doing doing that again is I would stand behind myself with a roll up newspaper and smack myself whenever I think I'm getting too clever for my own good.

[39:55] So I guess what you're saying, David, is like a lot of times when you're designing something, the reality of manufacturing it, if it's really complex and difficult, makes it more expensive, right?

[40:07] Because all those hours that have to go into figuring out how to making this work on a production level sort of eats away at the bottom line.

[40:15] Actually, what eats away at the bottom line is the time on the assembly line.

[40:22] Right. Because you're still having to pay people by the hour and you're trying to get machines at a certain number of machines out every day.

[40:29] You're not just trying to get the bill of materials down, you're also trying to get the build time down.

[40:33] Well, let's talk about now because I think the past is the past. And I think if you were to do anything differently, Dave, is there anything like from that error that you're like, if we had just made it a little bit easier on ourselves,

[40:44] we probably could have got to the finish line faster?

[40:47] Well, we overstretched ourselves really badly in those first few years, trying to bite off more than we could chew.

[40:56] Frankly, it's interesting that we're talking about this on the episode after you were talking about the deep group thing.

[41:08] But yeah, we definitely overextended ourselves and overestimated what was practical.

[41:15] How much was practical that we can actually do?

[41:19] And the other thing I would certainly do is I wouldn't announce stuff until we were ready to.

[41:32] That was again, that was a huge, a huge mistake, not just from the fact that what you're saying about the whole half life of hype and how quickly that can sort of like dissipate by the time you get to the finished product, especially if it takes longer than you expect.

[41:53] And the buzz has already moved on to something else.

[41:56] There is also the fact that if you say, okay, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, we're going to do this.

[42:03] You've tied yourself down to a promise.

[42:06] And unfortunately, Andrew did have a marked tendency to promise things that we then had to scramble and fall over ourselves to try and keep them.

[42:21] Both in terms of marketing and games were also in terms of physical things on the actual games well.

[42:32] So that's definitely something that we absolutely would not do.

[42:38] And Dave, and Dave, to that point, the industry has changed a lot too because a few years ago, right, you could simply announce stuff without physically having in you.

[42:49] And people would pay money. I mean, the pre-order model has gone from being like the way boutiques introduced themselves to the world.

[42:59] And I think nowadays, if you're asking for pre-order dollars, I think people would be very reluctant to give money before a final machine was finished.

[43:10] Well, we'll see, right, because who knows what's going on in some other places.

[43:15] Well, Dave, let's talk about the present. So the Andrews no longer with the organization, the new investors, the not the old investors have to come in and put in new capital.

[43:25] What's the mood like nowadays at highway? Is it has it improved?

[43:30] It's improved, yeah, at the moment it's a case of well, before the top priority is to get alien as good as it can possibly be and out the door.

[43:43] That starts all encompassing at the moment. That is the number one priority.

[43:47] So we've got to get alien out the door. We've got to get it as good as we can possibly get it.

[43:57] We've got to erase all traces of whatever other various shortcuts and whatever that was done before the things that were unpolished.

[44:13] This will actually lead into some of the stuff that we will talk about with the twins as well.

[44:17] But we've got we've got to get alien out the door, but at the same time you've got a company, you've got a manufacturing company with a dedicated design department.

[44:29] That design department also costs money and they're not just going to be sitting on their asses.

[44:34] In terms of game three, two days, we don't know for sure what the theme or the license is.

[44:41] I know there's rumors of clean and whatnot and we don't have to go into that because I know that's a secret.

[44:47] But will you be designing game three? Because I know Barry worked on a few designs for Andrew.

[44:52] Walk me through who's got the design helm. Now we see Barry's over at Deep Root. I'm curious to who's leading design.

[45:03] Who's leading design on game three? It's myself building on what Barry gave me.

[45:12] But there's there's a lot more of Barry in game three than there is Dennis in game two.

[45:20] I'm not certainly not throwing out baby with the bath water just because Barry's no longer here to work on it.

[45:32] It's at a fairly advanced conceptual stage and geometric stage and as far as the licenses go, they're happy with the direction that we're taking.

[45:46] But so we have a focus. We know where we're going to go with that.

[45:52] We have a more concrete structure in place for getting from A to B with this game that we kind of lack with previous games.

[46:07] Because what we're definitely not doing with game three is trying to make anything up as we go along.

[46:16] It's a case of death. Things to a stage where it's like, OK, this is nailed down. We move on to the next bit.

[46:24] Also, there was a lot to learn a lot to apply to game three.

[46:29] There was stuff that really worked with for throttle. There was stuff that really worked with alien.

[46:35] It's a case of taking the best bits that worked from both of our, of boiling the stuff that didn't work and applying it to this game.

[46:47] Making it, making it shoot well, making it fun, making it look as good as possible, trying to bring cross something that's fresh.

[46:58] But at the same time is easy to build. Basically, I'm applying to game three, everything I've learned from the first two games.

[47:07] And since we have, since we have a lot more devices and proprietary tech and other components to work with now, it means things can speed up a bit on that front as well.

[47:20] As part of the design team, and I think part of Andrew's initial design philosophy was the modular, swappable game system.

[47:31] Is that something that you guys are going to continue or are you going to move away from that sort of approach where we're trying to sell people play fields to pop in and out?

[47:40] Are we going to go more towards traditional style cabinets or is it what's the what's the future look like?

[47:48] I'm not sure if I can answer that question.

[47:52] Yeah, I don't think, yeah, I think unfortunately that's straying into NDA territory.

[47:59] I don't think I can answer that.

[48:01] Absolutely understand.

[48:03] And it makes sense not to move on the game three. So we're not going to hear about game three at T.P.F.

[48:07] I think as a marketer, I think that's a smart move. I think a lot of times, you know, companies, if they come into some sort of trouble,

[48:15] sometimes the desires to quickly announce something else to deflect the issues.

[48:20] It's almost like when Big Lebowski went Dutch announced that they're going to do that bride a pinbott for 12,500.

[48:25] And everyone's like, well, where's my Big Lebowski? So I think it's smart to...

[48:29] Yeah, we did that as well.

[48:32] If you remember back in 2014, Andrew announced Alien very early on before Throttle was even out.

[48:44] He felt he needed the pre-order money.

[48:51] I mean, he certainly said since that's something that he'd never do again.

[49:00] I mean, to be honest, I haven't actually spoken to Andrew in some time.

[49:04] So certainly not since Christmas.

[49:06] So I'm not really sure what Andrew is doing.

[49:11] But I do know that he's taken away sort of quite a bit from this as well in terms of learning from what worked and learning from what didn't.

[49:23] But yeah, Alien was announced at a point before full throttle was fully ready and effectively stopped it.

[49:31] Well, let's move on to the trivia's after this.

[49:35] But I think it's been a real learning experience for so many people making pinbott.

[49:41] It's not just highway pinbott. I mean, I think we saw the entire industry.

[49:45] They saw that there was a lot of money out there. A lot of people were really enthusiastic about buying new pinball machines.

[49:53] I mean, people were throwing $16,000 at John Papaduke without even a game.

[49:57] It was a period where it seemed like don't forget.

[50:01] Don't forget. Don't forget.

[50:03] You got it. If you put to put John Papaduke into context with this, he was, I think, the original booty guy.

[50:13] He came along with magic girl and he said specifically, okay, there's nobody else doing pinball like this.

[50:20] I'm only going to be making what I think it was 25 and I'm going to charge this amount for them.

[50:30] In terms of what was happening in the industry at the time, John was the one who came along and shook things up.

[50:38] And open people's eyes to the fact that hang on. Maybe we could do this as well.

[50:44] Maybe do this in a slightly different way.

[50:48] I think the price for magic girl at that point was immaterial simply because there was nothing else being pitched like it at the time.

[51:00] I mean, yeah, we've seen Batman Ellie come out in more or less the same circumstances really.

[51:06] I mean, there were only supposed to be how many of Batman super early.

[51:10] So, when it was 30 originally and then Stern saw the demand and bumped it up to 80 and even those 80, they sold out instantly.

[51:20] So, CoinTaker had one in box because Chris got one over there. CoinTaker and he just never opened it.

[51:28] And I bought it.

[51:32] But Dave, to your point and I think what was interesting about what John showed and I've said this before, for all of John Papadoug's faults, he understood the market.

[51:44] And what I mean by that is there are a lot of people with a lot of money in this hobby because you need a lot of money if you're going to start buying 9,000, 10,000 dollar toys that are non-essentials for life.

[51:58] And there are multi-millionaires in this hobby who really want something exclusive and something limited.

[52:05] Now what's interesting is even though Zidware failed to deliver on that, nobody has really moved into that part of the market which is very low number high price games that are limited.

[52:18] Well, I would argue that Stan has-

[52:21] They've tried, right? And they were successful with Batman SLE to a point but I think what Stern has realized is the games themselves probably don't warrant that kind of price tag.

[52:34] Because think about like this, if I have a $15,000 Batman SLE, I think it's a cool machine.

[52:41] But someone is playing the same exact game as mine for $8,000 with the premium.

[52:47] And it's-

[52:48] Yes, but that's getting into-

[52:51] That's getting into slightly different territory.

[52:54] I mean the point with Magic Girl was there was only supposed to be one edition.

[52:59] Exactly. Exactly.

[53:00] But in my mind, what made Magic Girl worthy of the price, if he had delivered, is I would sell it like this.

[53:09] To actually play a Magic Girl, there are thousands of pinball fans out there in the world.

[53:15] You would have to be standing in front of one of only 16 machines. That's special.

[53:21] But he never could get it done.

[53:23] So let's talk about Deeproot and them going to the twips. Now that we're talking about John, Deeproot came onto the scene recently.

[53:31] And as we were just saying, Dave, don't announce stuff too early. Don't reveal your cards too early. Don't share your intentions too early.

[53:40] Well, they've shared a lot, right? And they're in their interview last week.

[53:43] And they have half of the design team from highway that have got Dennis over there, Barry over there.

[53:47] Yeah.

[53:48] What are your thoughts just as a pinball fan when you when you saw what they announced?

[53:53] I can't answer that as a pinball fan because I'm too close to it.

[53:58] But I'll tell you what I did think of it. I saw that as an immediate statement of intent.

[54:04] Well, with that photograph that had that had Dennis there, as you said, that had Barry there, that had David Thiel there, that's David Thiel's previous game being the one that he did for us.

[54:17] And that was effectively David feel especially was the greatest asset that we had on a lot of the success as a game is down to David Thiel.

[54:31] Everybody acknowledges it. And so now here they all are deeproot. And they're showing them off.

[54:38] What deeproot I see deeproot doing with this is basically they're saying we've got deep pockets and we're going to wreck your shit and we're starting with you.

[54:49] Right. Yeah, I mean, it was it definitely felt like I feel like they were trying to be like death row records where they've got Snoop.

[54:57] We've got Tupac. We've got Dr. Dre. We're going to we're going to take over. I mean, but it's a little strange, right?

[55:04] And I've always wondered the loyalty in this industry, what how people jump around so much? And I understand David does work for everybody because he's a sound guy and he goes wherever the people are paying him.

[55:17] I understand that. But do you feel like were you we upset at all to see that, you know, two designers that had been designing for you guys ending up there? Or is it just the nature of the business that whoever's going to pay me?

[55:31] It's the nature of the business, I think, actually, that wasn't one that wasn't the first and second. That was the second and third. What's what you probably what most people probably don't remember is that in the very early days, we had John Trudeau on board.

[55:50] In the very early days in 2012 and he was going to design things when the time right and Stern poached him away from us.

[56:01] This is very indicative of how cutthroat really cutthroat the industry is because you've said in a couple of episodes, I think, that you claim that people overestimate the industry.

[56:19] You know, you don't automate the amount of money that there is in the market and in the hobby. Well, no, no, they don't. The big player certainly, certainly don't.

[56:31] I mean, the stories that you hear of licenses being bought up so that other people can't have them. I'm pretty sure that goes on.

[56:46] The absolutely stern is locking down titles that I mean, I know for a fact that spooky pinball's dream theme to make was going to be monsters and you know, Stern doesn't need monsters. Spooky's got a pinball company that's all the, I mean, they're called spooky for God's sake.

[57:01] They want to make those sort of like fun, campy sort of horror kind of inspired themes and you know, Stern probably locked that down just to screw over spooky.

[57:11] Well, when you also consider it like this, a licensing deal involves two large, a significant degree royalties. You're paying so much as well as cash package to get that particular license.

[57:27] You're also going to be paying X amount per machine. Well, if you don't make the machine, you don't pay the X amount for him.

[57:34] So, Stern are obviously weighing up. Well, it's going to cost us this amount, base amount to get this license. Is it going to be worth it just so that nobody else can have it?

[57:49] For a company like Stern, it's probably not much of a conundrum, but they've got this big share of the market.

[58:03] They've got the distribution network and by Christ, they're going to do anything that I know.

[58:09] Oh yeah. Well, and Dave, when Deeproot made their announcement and they said they're going to design a game without white woods as a designer, is that even possible?

[58:19] To like, to never have a white wood stage of a game.

[58:26] I wouldn't try it. We did so much on the fly in the early years that I would not recommend anybody,

[58:41] try to make anything, especially anything as complex as pinball without building at least two white wood.

[58:53] You want at least two white wood. The first to try out the initial shots and the second to refine it.

[59:02] And I think a second white wood would be your final one.

[59:07] It was incredible to hear the level of confidence and almost like swagger that they were in Robert's interview about their ability to make pinball when they haven't ever made a single game.

[59:22] So I think a lot of people are looking at it like here we go.

[59:26] Yeah, you can understand why I paid that so much attention.

[59:29] Well, it's like history repeating itself and I think you know, it's a shame because it doesn't have to.

[59:34] I think there's so many good lessons to have been learned in this hobby over the last five years.

[59:40] Some have been painful lessons, some have been good lessons.

[59:43] But at the end of the day, you know, I think we all want to see pinball get to a much more positive place where all the drama surrounding companies,

[59:51] and games, and pins sort of dissipates.

[59:54] And we can focus on the good sides of the hobby.

[59:57] And I think the twippies, let's move on to some of that stuff because I want to go through some of the stuff you were raising in the email to me Dave around the twippies.

[01:00:05] So I want to read out some of these topics and let's just dive in. How's that sound?

[01:00:09] So you said the community is less conservative, not politically, but how they see the market than the industry is, especially when you look at the figures within both.

[01:00:20] Yeah, you got to remember you keep pointing this out. This is a toy used to boys market.

[01:00:27] And it's pitched as such.

[01:00:30] You've got, as you say, there's always going to be a certain amount of risk in buying a product, a toy that's going to be going to cost anywhere up to 9,000 pounds.

[01:00:49] And I describe a pinball machine. It's like a Fisher price toy for adults. That's basically what it is.

[01:00:57] You press this, you press this thing, you hit this thing and this thing lights up and this thing goes, being and it's the same kind of cause and effect.

[01:01:06] Or it's like the way people are people tinker with cars. It's pretty much the same kind of principle.

[01:01:12] Yeah, you know that there's going to be a certain amount of risk involved in trying to sell somebody in 9,000 dollar product.

[01:01:22] So, and especially if the figures that you have designing that product are your old hands and they know what works for them.

[01:01:35] You're going to minimize that risk and you're going to let those figures do what they do.

[01:01:42] But what the community has shown with dialed in and especially the total nuclear annihilation because that was the golden boy.

[01:01:51] It's like Scott and E C could do no wrong.

[01:01:56] People want something that feels fresh and new. I mean, we're seeing that.

[01:02:02] People want something that just offers something just just that little bit different, even if it's not as super complex, super deep.

[01:02:12] I mean, a lot of people just don't like deep games anyway. Some people fit games are too complex. They're too hard to get into.

[01:02:21] They're all modern stuff. So, total nuclear annihilation offered people something that wasn't there and that they didn't necessarily know they wanted until it was given to them.

[01:02:35] The other thing that total nuclear annihilation did.

[01:02:40] First impressions are really, really important. And people saw how total nuclear annihilation developed on the PIN side forums just as its own home brew project.

[01:02:55] So, before that got to the point where that was a product for sale where the first impression would matter.

[01:03:07] People already had the impression of that game. They knew how it was going to shoot. They knew how it was going to look, how it was going to sound.

[01:03:17] They already knew they wanted it. So, that was effectively the first impression that it gave when spooky picked it up.

[01:03:27] Now, if you compare that with Dildin, for example, Dildin, Dildin made the same mistake that we did when we first tried to do Cersei's Animal Aile House.

[01:03:47] Because your pitch is vital. If you get that pitch wrong, just people aren't really going to get it.

[01:03:56] I think with a pitch, if you're pitching to somebody who's going to buy a game, you've got to think of it like a new player who's going to walk up to your machine and they've never seen it before.

[01:04:08] And what you've got, you've got a machine in a bar, somebody comes up to it. The first thing they're going to see is the Translides and the name.

[01:04:17] That has got to convey what your game is. The basic idea of the game has got to be summed up in your Translides and your name.

[01:04:29] This is what the Balli Williams games were so good at doing in the 90s. With a license, obviously, your pitch is right there. I mean, Guardians of the Galaxy. It's Guardians of the Galaxy.

[01:04:43] So, you can see why just on that basis alone, licenses have that kind of appeal.

[01:04:51] So, there's a lot of discussion when dialed and launched. From a marketing standpoint, why is, I don't immediately get what this game is about.

[01:04:59] Is it about a cell phone? Is it about saving Quantum City? Should it just be called Save Quantum City?

[01:05:06] It didn't have that immediate sort of understanding. And to your point, David, it would be hard to explain to someone pretty quickly what the game is about.

[01:05:16] And I think Jack had a comic book that was trying to explain it, but you shouldn't really need an additional materials to be able to explain the backstory of a pinball machine because it should be pretty immediate.

[01:05:32] And I think Jack learned the lesson. You should be able to sum it up. You should be able to sum it up in kind of like a one line high concept pitch. I mean, I think the definitive example of this is Monster Bash because Monster Bash is a licensed thing.

[01:05:48] But if you didn't know the history of the Universal Monsters or whatever, if you didn't notice the Universal logo that was on the game, you'd swear that game was an original.

[01:05:58] And it was pitched like an original. I mean, you've got the trans like you've got the name and you've got the one like one one sentence pitch that that translates like conveys, which is there are monsters and they reform about attack from Mars, right?

[01:06:16] It's a type of madness. That is there in the name. Goofy aliens invade Earth. Goofy forces have to repair them. Right.

[01:06:26] Right. That's so again, getting back to 60s and an L house, the way we should have pitched that back was comedy magical bar where people turning animals everybody has far.

[01:06:43] Right. This is your hostess that shouldn't be next instead of getting so like hung up on the mythology and whatever and over complicating things behind it.

[01:06:52] You've got to give people the person information and the minimum information like I said, like I said with with new players, you've got the back glass and you've got the name.

[01:07:03] That's got to attract people and then you've got your play field. Right. It's not a hold for them. That's all you've got. So what Jersey Jack did, they kind of did it from they kind of came up this.

[01:07:16] They arrived at the same problem, but from the opposite thing that they what I seem to remember them doing this was clearly the game that's pat lawler wanted to make when he was part of the first initial kickstarter that the propimble guys did when they had him on board.

[01:07:39] I'm very sure that this is the game that he would have made then.

[01:07:44] But when he came on board Jersey Jack and they first started to announce the game they were.

[01:07:54] They were. Kremmy find wrong, but first and foremost they were advertising that they were promoting that as a pat lawler. Yes.

[01:08:02] Yeah, that's what I thought. So it's like look, look, you pat lawler game. It's awesome. Look, look, it's pat lawler. He's back. It's awesome. Look at this play field. Look at it. Look at it. Look at it. Okay. What's the game about?

[01:08:15] Yeah. It's got a cell phone on it. Right. Well, I think that I look I said this before and I respect Jack and everyone over there. I think the mistake is.

[01:08:29] And I would agree with you is is pat just this is Pat's magic girl. This is the game he wanted to make for over five years.

[01:08:37] He almost got a blank check to make the game he wanted. But at the end and look dialed in it cleaned up at the twippies for the most part. Right.

[01:08:47] Yeah, I mean it won the most awards. It's a great pinball game wrapped in a theme that will never come close to selling as many games as star wars or ghost busters. And that's why I was like. Yeah, but some.

[01:09:01] Yeah, I suppose you're going to ask yourself who is it really aimed at? Star Wars is another example of the same another thing I was going to come to with this is star wars by Steve Richie and dialed in by Jersey Jack.

[01:09:19] Both go to demonstrate that the era of using an established designers name, no matter who it is to sell a pinball machine. I think that's over.

[01:09:31] I don't think you can really do that anymore. That's why that's why I look to that deep group thing and I said, well.

[01:09:39] Yeah, I wish Barry every success. I really hope he gets to do what he wants with with deep roots. I hope he gets to make the games he really wants to make but we'll just have to see what happens.

[01:09:56] Anyway, yeah, using an established designers name to just to sell the game.

[01:10:02] Well, it's it's getting I think I think it's not right. Yeah, look at Star Wars. I look at Star Wars and I could I look to that play field and I could tell again, maybe I'm wrong, but I could form a basis of how the first design meeting for that game must have gone based on what I already knew about how

[01:10:25] Star Wars episode one went and how little fun everybody had with that how overbearing Lucas was with that game.

[01:10:37] Well, you asked it to your point though. I got no, that's finished this bit. They must have sat Steve Richie and Dwight Sullivan down in the room and said, okay, we're doing Star Wars.

[01:10:50] Obviously, nobody's going to be doing Star Wars, but you Steve.

[01:10:55] Lyman is busy with other codes. We we have to use this art. It's what because they they're so rigid with the style guide and what what we can produce.

[01:11:10] We have this much money to spend. It's going to be all down to you two guys to lock it out the park. I think Steve Richie did the best possible job he could have done under those circumstances.

[01:11:25] I mean, when you look at how much in terms of a game in terms of things to actually shoot for to shoot at shots to make targets to shoot that play field is packed.

[01:11:38] But they already knew in advance they were not going to be able to integrate the theme as much as they would have wanted to like us is the impression that I mean I get the same impression from a lot of conversations that the cost of the license was so expensive that the bomb on the game wasn't what they would have wanted to really bring that theme to life.

[01:12:00] But I'll say this though to Dave and I think that an interesting point when you talk about these these old designers these guys who've been around for decades.

[01:12:10] I think they're. I mean they look. I don't see a bunch of young news and experience that that right but but here's the thing I think in pinball it's like anything alive whether you're a musician whether you're a pinball designer.

[01:12:25] It is really hard to recapture the creativity and imagination you have when you're young and you're hungry to make a name for yourself and I think you know when people see Scott Denise's game when they see this stuff Eric worked on over at Jersey Jack for pirates the Caribbean I wouldn't have shown the game so early because now there's nothing to pull the curtain off on when they when the game goes on sale.

[01:12:48] But at least there's like a lot of young blood and Dave I think you fall into that category to I mean you're these are people new people designing pinball machines who are coming at it from a fresh perspective who want to become known as a great pinball designer.

[01:13:02] I think a lot of these older gentlemen who have been doing it for so long a lot of recycled ideas and it's hard not to go towards things that are recycled because you know it works and it's part of like your design scheme.

[01:13:17] You know so it's interesting because I do agree I don't I don't think like Pat Lawler equals 5,000 games sold anymore you know he sold one sold 20,000 Adams families but again it wasn't because it was Pat Lawler's Adams family I mean I think I think only recently we've sort of put these designers up on this pedestal now as if they can do no wrong but the game just needs to be great.

[01:13:43] I don't think people really care where comes from I don't.

[01:13:48] I think they care where comes from if they can if they do get to see the early genesis of it like total nuclear annihilation because people people like an underdog that makes good it's like a sports movie you root for the underdog makes good and that's got an easy to see.

[01:14:13] Well you also said something to your notes me said the community is very harsh against any game that is unpolished unfinished or makes a bad first impression right but it's also a very forgiving community if you make things right.

[01:14:28] Yes that's certainly true with dialed in and the number of awards that is swept up once people got to look at the game once people got to play the game and go oh right now I get it.

[01:14:41] I mean look at look at look at Batman 66 right a year ago in the code people hate at the game now you don't the code was what we're taking that yeah.

[01:14:51] See I would argue to that we're not arguing we're not we're not in an argument but I would say that I think the coders are becoming the new rock stars because I have people who tell me all the time like I just want buy another stern unless it's lineman.

[01:15:04] Yeah you there I would be worried that that kind of attitude starts to promote the kind of spaces and the kind of conservatism that we already touched upon with the established designers because then you've got your the code is saying oh well they like this I shall give them more of this.

[01:15:31] Well there's always a tug war right with coding between and you were touching on this earlier the casual player who would find a lot of games that are too deep and you know like 99% of people never get to wizard modes but yet it's all we hear about on Pinside right is like there's no final wizard mode I'm not you know the reality is I think the best pinball machines of all time struck the right balance of you immediately can jump on it and have fun.

[01:16:00] But you also can go go deep into the game if you're a skilled player and if you're a tournament player you're not complaining about the scoring and all that other stuff.

[01:16:10] Now but of course the best pinball machines of all time the classic 90s ones were never made for that audience they were only made for the market the mass market the collectors market if you like is experiencing them now through in the last 15 years through places like visual pins.

[01:16:29] And through fast side pinball arcade and now the common man can pick it up and just just for a matter of a few bucks and see over time how deep that game was and gain the appreciation for that.

[01:16:49] I think I think this is one way one direction I think the market should go as well I mean this is this is something that I would advocate particularly in terms of of original themes if you want to make games with original themes what I would do is I would make it in digital form first release it as an act let people play it let people get into it let people like it let it find its audience.

[01:17:18] If the audience is there if the demand is there then you make it for real. I think the two markets should complement each other rather than just try to write each other.

[01:17:30] And as you know right I mean there's it's really expensive risk to take if you get that wrong and you start with the physical machine.

[01:17:41] I think with I think one of the original IPs this gets back towards the pitch as well because I suppose in a sense you're trying to pitch this to yourself.

[01:17:54] I think I think I think I think you are creating a new IP like it has its own story it has its own background it has its own characters but most of the point you said this word as well it's got personality people right now what games that feel fresh and that have a lot of personality to them.

[01:18:19] So it fits in fits that bill total nuclear annihilation the personality comes from Scott and E see himself and what he was able to do with the game but it's still there.

[01:18:31] So total nuclear annihilation is offering that back man 66 now that the code is complete now it has all those callouts by Bert Warden out of west the personality is there that's what people want.

[01:18:45] And I think we're not even fully complete on that man we're only a point eight seven but to your point I think what makes the game come to life are those callouts and the fact that the last project that Adam West worked on is him saying.

[01:19:02] So the game is like a pinball line which is incredible for a pinball fan to experience that and I think you're right I think you know games like medieval madness the personality of games like attack from Mars like it should be fun like really really fun exactly to play a pinball machine and it shouldn't feel like corners were cut with you know we couldn't get the voice actors so we used you know this and that and it's so.

[01:19:27] Well thank God for Bill Paxton we got the same we got the same effect i don't want to put it like this but it happens to be true we got the same effect with Bill Paxton even though they're not custom lines a pinball was the last thing Bill Paxton was in before he died yeah no I know I mean that was untimely you know and it's but it's it's it's you know as I say these things are become sort of time capsules for these themes and I think it's always an honor for any license to be immortalized in a pinball machine.

[01:19:56] Yeah it's terrible that it's not good well Dave I really appreciate you taking the hour as you know we usually try to do these interviews an hour but I would love to have you come on as a recurring guest just to talk about pinball too because I think your knowledge and your point of view on stuff is really interesting and you know obviously we hope that everything with highway can come to a good end for everyone who's in on those machines and I'm glad to hear that you guys are focusing on getting people to see what they're doing.

[01:20:25] I'm getting people their machines this year and that is going to be the primary focus and look I mean that's all we want in pinball is just people to get the games they pay for and to enjoy them and to your point it's it's an expensive fish or price toy that is meant to bring hours of enjoyment into the home and onto locations around the world so any any final words Dave as I give you your Sunday back.

[01:20:50] Um Christ now you put me on the spot.

[01:20:57] Oh, before you go what twippies did you get right and wrong we talked about.

[01:21:04] Oh yeah, well we both got we both immediately latched on the pinstead the pinstadium lights when I need to see all the categories again.

[01:21:16] Um we got the categories here.

[01:21:22] Yeah, let me follow my two pinball.

[01:21:24] I got to go past this.

[01:21:25] I got to go.

[01:21:26] Right.

[01:21:26] This is deep rude interview.

[01:21:27] Didn't look here we go.

[01:21:29] Here we go.

[01:21:30] Best right best animations and display.

[01:21:32] We both called that for dialed in.

[01:21:35] Um, I called it for dialed in simply on the basis that it started everything from scratch.

[01:21:40] It didn't have any pre pre made assets to work with.

[01:21:44] It had to do all the work itself.

[01:21:47] Um, so that's the reason why I picked that one.

[01:21:51] Best light show.

[01:21:54] Best light show total nuclear annihilation because the other two were it was flashes.

[01:22:00] It was strobe city.

[01:22:02] Favorite new mod and that was pinstadium.

[01:22:05] Um, that was pinstadium there because pinstadium you were going for you were going to go for the.

[01:22:11] Um, I don't realize.

[01:22:12] I didn't realize that stadium was like brand new.

[01:22:15] So that's why I didn't I definitely think that mod is not because pinstadium is not because pinstadium is brand new.

[01:22:22] It's because you're going to adapt.

[01:22:23] Prince stadium to multiple games.

[01:22:25] Multiple machines.

[01:22:26] When it's a great mod.

[01:22:27] I mean, I think pinball machine lighting is super important for people, especially in the home environment.

[01:22:33] Uh, it changes the game.

[01:22:34] It did more.

[01:22:36] You can see the better you can shoot.

[01:22:37] So best theme.

[01:22:38] I think everyone voted for Star Wars.

[01:22:41] You just can't.

[01:22:43] Everyone voted for Star Wars.

[01:22:44] Yeah, I mean, you can't.

[01:22:45] It's just, but that's like a silly star was almost, it's anything.

[01:22:49] Best toys and gimmicks went to was it dialed in?

[01:22:53] Yes, it went to dialed in again because it was something.

[01:22:56] Fresh favorite pinball YouTube channel.

[01:22:59] I believe went to straight down the middle.

[01:23:01] Best theme integration.

[01:23:03] I was like, I was like head says Papa.

[01:23:06] Heart says SDT.

[01:23:09] But like, it's just not it's not meant to be as entertaining.

[01:23:13] I mean, it's more about educational.

[01:23:15] So I also think because Greg and Zach were hosting that they had a little bit of an advantage there.

[01:23:22] Best theme integration that that also went to dialed in, right?

[01:23:28] Which I was confused about.

[01:23:29] Was it you?

[01:23:31] Was it you who said that if you're doing your own theme,

[01:23:35] if you're doing an O your own IP, so long as you get the theme right, you can't get the integration.

[01:23:42] How can you mess up an integration of something that isn't even imagined yet in the world?

[01:23:48] Like it's hard to like be like, oh, you that's not how it should have been because the theme calls for it to be

[01:23:54] differently.

[01:23:54] I mean, it's all original.

[01:23:56] I guess you could argue that to your point, Dave, you know, if by calling it dialed in,

[01:24:02] is that theme integrated onto the play field?

[01:24:05] I don't know.

[01:24:05] I mean, it's all there, but I could see why it won.

[01:24:09] I also could argue that that's like a weird thing to win for integration on an original IP.

[01:24:14] I think it depends on the game.

[01:24:17] I think I think it kind of overlaps in the case of an original IP of an original theme.

[01:24:27] The integration will overlap into the art side, into the toys and gimmicks side, into the code side.

[01:24:33] There's going to be everything that makes that theme integration work.

[01:24:37] So best sounding callouts that, yeah, this was an interesting one.

[01:24:42] This is where you would have, this is one of the areas where you would have thought that Aian,

[01:24:47] because you were pushing for Aian for this originally.

[01:24:51] You thought Aian had a shoe in for this.

[01:24:53] And this is where you would have thought Aian might have had a stab,

[01:25:00] but in all the twippies, we were nowhere.

[01:25:05] And this gets back to what I was saying about the community being unforgiving about things

[01:25:10] that at the time seem unpolished, but we'll forgive them if it makes sense.

[01:25:18] I just think that best.

[01:25:19] The trippies were the perfect example.

[01:25:20] Yeah, yeah.

[01:25:21] I mean, people voted what they felt good about.

[01:25:25] And even if a game was like, I think Batman was an interesting game too,

[01:25:30] because even though Batman's better now, people haven't forgiven Stern for raping them for a year.

[01:25:38] So they literally didn't want to vote for it, because it didn't deserve to get an accolade

[01:25:45] when it made most of its owners be in pain.

[01:25:48] And here's the thing.

[01:25:48] So best I think the thing that's actually showing that principle off more is the fact

[01:25:55] that Guardians of the Galaxy was literally nowhere except the Galaxy.

[01:26:01] I agree.

[01:26:02] They said, well, we've seen this with Batman.

[01:26:05] We're not going to see this again.

[01:26:07] We're not going to let this be seen again until it completely agree.

[01:26:10] Because Guardians of the Galaxy are really down on Guardians for the way it was launched.

[01:26:16] And I think people are tired.

[01:26:17] Yeah, it's the first impression.

[01:26:18] Exactly.

[01:26:19] So best sound in callouts, what I think is interesting in that.

[01:26:21] And I spoke to this.

[01:26:23] I think those need to be two separate categories because sound is different than the callouts.

[01:26:28] Because if you're just say best callouts in a pinball machine, I think Batman 66 takes it.

[01:26:34] I don't think sound and callouts are the same thing.

[01:26:38] So it's almost like saying best guitar solo and vocals like together.

[01:26:43] And I think you can break them up.

[01:26:45] Now the favorite pitch streamer was Jack Danger.

[01:26:48] The best code in rules was dialed in, correct?

[01:26:54] I can't dial in when that.

[01:26:56] Let's get down there.

[01:26:57] Best code.

[01:26:58] Yeah, it's dialed in.

[01:27:00] Interestingly enough, Batman 66 was the way to be sure.

[01:27:06] Well, you know, the other thing is to so dialed down.

[01:27:10] They walked away with this one.

[01:27:11] Dilding up 52%.

[01:27:13] And the vouchers.

[01:27:13] This is another thing that struck me.

[01:27:16] OK.

[01:27:18] After the trivia was and I was thinking about what this means, well, it would be easy to just say,

[01:27:25] just to just shrug it up and say, well, maybe not enough people voted for alien because there

[01:27:34] hasn't been as many of them in people's homes as we would have liked.

[01:27:39] But first of all, you would have been the first person to say, well, who's fault that then?

[01:27:45] And second of all, both Batman 66, the super LA and total nuclear annihilation,

[01:27:53] neither of those were meant to be high run games anyway.

[01:27:58] So the fact that both of those total nuclear annihilation and Batman 66 coming in a very healthy

[01:28:05] second and the third in the twippies, that proves that that's not right.

[01:28:10] Right.

[01:28:11] So then we had the best play field layout and gameplay was also dialed in, which not surprise,

[01:28:19] which I guess goes back, yeah, which goes back to the theme integration and given something fresh again.

[01:28:24] Favorite pinball podcast now.

[01:28:26] Did you vote in the twippies, Dave?

[01:28:29] I didn't vote in the twippies because I felt I was too close.

[01:28:36] It's anonymous.

[01:28:38] That's not the point.

[01:28:40] You hear a lot about it.

[01:28:41] No, not sure.

[01:28:42] I want you to vote.

[01:28:43] At least vote for the favorite pinball podcast, which we all knew.

[01:28:46] I don't listen to a great deal of podcasts.

[01:28:48] I mean, there was so many podcasts listed.

[01:28:51] I get no.

[01:28:52] Either was 21.

[01:28:53] There were some one podcast they called out insane.

[01:28:56] The world doesn't need 21 pinball podcasts.

[01:28:59] There's no best artwork went to Erasmith.

[01:29:05] Yes, which I know.

[01:29:07] I think it was a much closer one.

[01:29:09] I mean, Erasmith guardians of the galaxy Batman 66.

[01:29:12] It was stern one, two, three and it was between Chris Franchey and dirty Donny.

[01:29:18] So real ding dong battle there.

[01:29:21] But somebody had delumes and unfortunately they're all good.

[01:29:25] They're all talented.

[01:29:26] Game of the year obviously went to dialed in.

[01:29:29] I mean, it was a very good day for dialed in.

[01:29:31] I mean, I think, you know, I think everyone looked at the result of these.

[01:29:38] I think they were fair and very honest sort of reflection of where the hobby is right now.

[01:29:45] And I know some people are...

[01:29:46] And where the game stood as well.

[01:29:48] I mean, dialed in was the comeback hit.

[01:29:51] And total nuclear annihilation was the underdog made good.

[01:29:56] Well, it was a fun award show.

[01:29:59] And I think doing it annually is going to be a really fun thing for the community.

[01:30:04] And again, I think it's time where I think people just want to put the drama behind and just celebrate pinball because we all love it.

[01:30:12] So Dave, I really want to extend a thank you for joining.

[01:30:16] I know it's not easy coming from highway pinball to join.

[01:30:19] Can I just pinball podcast, but hopefully you enjoy this.

[01:30:22] I don't put it like that.

[01:30:23] No, no, I mean, we've been harsh on it.

[01:30:25] And I know I want...

[01:30:26] If you have any questions about like why...

[01:30:29] I mean, I've always taken the stance of, I need to be on the side of the customers.

[01:30:33] I need to make sure people's money is protected.

[01:30:35] And I think it's not just highway.

[01:30:37] I think a lot of the pre-order model, you know, it just hurt consumers.

[01:30:43] And it took a lot of the life out of the hobby.

[01:30:46] I think everyone's wise or now than they were then.

[01:30:49] And so I hope everything can get back on track for people.

[01:30:53] And that's it.

[01:30:54] I just want to see people get their pinball machines.

[01:30:56] I really have no allegiances or bones to pick anymore with people.

[01:31:01] I've changed my tune.

[01:31:02] And I was a lot more negative a year ago.

[01:31:05] But I think life is better when you...

[01:31:07] What do you have negative things affecting you?

[01:31:09] Yeah, when you got to just get...

[01:31:10] You got to cut it loose.

[01:31:11] I mean, these are toys.

[01:31:13] No, even when I read on pins, like people arguing with each other on some level,

[01:31:18] step back and realize the enane-ness of really personally attacking people

[01:31:23] because of how they think about a pinball machine.

[01:31:25] I mean, it's too much real stuff going on in the world.

[01:31:28] So Dave, thank you so much.

[01:31:30] And again, I extend the offer to come back on whenever, you know,

[01:31:33] we feel like we have some fun topics to kick back and forth because I do.

[01:31:36] I really appreciate your point of view on stuff.

[01:31:39] What it might be while we'll just have to see on the...

[01:31:41] Yeah, it's, you know, door is always open.

[01:31:44] That's what I want to say.

[01:31:45] So Dave, thank you so much for joining the show.

[01:31:47] And we look forward to, you know, to see what comes down the road in pinball.

[01:31:52] And yeah, thank you so much.

[01:31:54] All right.

[01:31:56] All right, ladies and gentlemen, that was episode 199.

[01:31:59] And that was Mr. Dave Sanders lead designer at Highway Pinball.

[01:32:02] I think you should a lot of great information.

[01:32:04] I hope you enjoyed that interview.

[01:32:06] And as I've said, this is the year for these companies.

[01:32:10] Not just Highway, but all these companies to figure it out.

[01:32:14] Because this is the year where there's the most opportunity to get people to buy your games.

[01:32:20] But the games have to be shipped to distributors to get to consumers.

[01:32:25] I don't think people are going to want to have their money tied up for much longer.

[01:32:29] In any pinball company, all right.

[01:32:31] I hope you guys enjoyed this episode number 200 is coming up.

[01:32:36] And I have to say, I have to be honest, I failed to secure any special guests.

[01:32:39] I asked John Borg, I asked try to get Gary Stern.

[01:32:43] I tried to get Mr. Pinball himself from Barney,

[01:32:49] get ladies Ed Robertson on the show, but he's traveling.

[01:32:52] So I'm probably just going to do something a little bit more intimate for show number 200 of Canadian Pinball podcast.

[01:32:57] But I don't see this show as being milestone driven because we do so many of them.

[01:33:02] I just see it as quality over quantity, even though we have a lot of quantity.

[01:33:07] Thank you guys for listening. We'll talk to you real soon.
