[00:00] Well, there's never a dull moment in Pimbal.

[00:09] Every time I feel like we are out of news and there's nothing to talk about until the

[00:14] next Pimbal release, something happens out of the blue.

[00:18] And I wanted to give you my quick take on what is transpired over the last 24 hours in

[00:24] the Pimbal hobby with the news of Dutch Pimbal.

[00:28] And I want to stay focused on that.

[00:31] Because I know I put up my previous podcast in which we basically went back in time and

[00:35] said, look, four months ago, a Canadian Pimbal podcast with a tip from Iceman, predicted

[00:43] that the ARA Big Lebowski games would become available to buy.

[00:48] And we also predicted that Alien Pimbal would come back.

[00:52] And I want to talk about those two things quickly on this short little snackable version

[00:57] of the Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[00:59] And I also want to say this.

[01:00] I want to talk about what the debate is going on on Pinside and the ethical decision by

[01:07] people to buy a Big Lebowski knowing that there are early achievers that will not get their

[01:14] games.

[01:15] And I sort of want to clarify some of the information that seems to be misinformation

[01:19] and also just give my overall feelings of what it means to buy one of these games now.

[01:25] And I think also one big thing that everyone is missing through all of this.

[01:30] So first and foremost, Barry came out and delivered a letter in which he expressed a few

[01:37] things.

[01:38] Basically, in a nutshell, Dutch Pimbal lost the lawsuit to ARA.

[01:44] So ARA won the lawsuit that has taken a few years to figure out.

[01:49] Yop is not feeling well.

[01:51] In fact, his cancer has returned and it doesn't look good.

[01:56] Barry will be taking control of the company.

[01:59] And even though ARA won the suit, instead of saying game over, Barry reached out to ARA

[02:05] and was able to, maybe I don't know, somehow find a way to agree upon the following.

[02:13] If Dutch Pimbal could pay ARA the money they owed, then the games that are at ARA and

[02:20] all the parts and all the Dutch Pimbal merchandise and supplies would be turned over to Barry.

[02:30] And so because they have a plan in place.

[02:33] So then Barry said he met with his financial advisor and they ran the numbers and the numbers

[02:37] looked good.

[02:39] And the plan they came up with was this.

[02:42] If they are able to sell the games at $12,500, that will raise enough capital to pay ARA

[02:52] what they are owed, thus releasing the games to Barry to then release to customers.

[02:58] Now it seems all too good to be true because it is too good to be true on some levels

[03:03] and for some people.

[03:04] So here are the, here's the reality of the situation.

[03:08] If you have money with CoinTaker, CoinTaker and you have a deposit down with them on a previous

[03:15] game, let's say you had $8,500 down, I think that was the deposit.

[03:19] You can make up the difference and get your game.

[03:23] Because CoinTaker kept your money in escrow, didn't go to Barry and Yop.

[03:28] Okay.

[03:29] Now if you have bought your game from another distributor, I think you're at a lock.

[03:36] If you had bought your game from Dutch Pimball, you are also at a lock because here's why.

[03:43] They cannot honor any money that already went to Dutch Pimball because that money is gone.

[03:49] They need new capital in order to pay ARA to release the games.

[03:54] It's like we have to do this or nobody gets anything or else ARA just has the games.

[04:00] I don't know, maybe, you know, part of me was like, well why can't ARA just sell the

[04:04] games directly to customers?

[04:07] Why are they even doing this deal with Barry?

[04:10] So there's that part of it that is just circling in my mind.

[04:13] The point I'm getting at and you're going to hear more of this is I don't think things

[04:16] are going to happen as smoothly as people think they are going to happen, but who knows?

[04:22] They might turn out to be roses in the end, but we've known throughout the years that

[04:28] nothing that happens in the world of Dutch Pimball ever goes very smoothly or according

[04:32] to plan.

[04:34] So if you were an early achiever and you paid money and lost your $8,500 and you are

[04:40] past the number of games that are coming out, I think these are numbers like, I think

[04:43] it's like 40 to 90, something like that or 50 to 90.

[04:48] If you are beyond that number and you paid money, you still get nothing.

[04:52] So there are going to be games for sale to people basically and you still have no game.

[04:59] And so the debate is raging on Pinside that does that mean that they are selling a game

[05:05] that belongs to somebody else.

[05:07] Okay, so that's just a question on the table.

[05:09] We'll talk a little bit about that.

[05:12] Is it unethical for people to go in and buy a game two day or yesterday who were not

[05:19] originally an early achiever and who did not have deposits down and just sort of mosey

[05:25] on in with cash and just grab one and that is a possibility for people.

[05:32] And so what what happens now is this you will have a group of early achievers who are

[05:39] still losing money, still not getting their game and watching other people enjoy the

[05:45] game they already paid for while they themselves are left holding a bag of air.

[05:53] And so is that ethical.

[05:55] Now the thing is when you buy these games like this where you have early achievers and

[05:59] they're numbered games and you bought a number.

[06:01] So let's say for example, so I bought number 150.

[06:05] Well my game has not even been made yet.

[06:08] And so game let's say game number 67 is one of the games that Coin Takeer has to sell.

[06:14] If I'm number 150, am I allowed to say that's BS?

[06:18] I want that game available because I already paid for my game.

[06:22] Now the problem is right it's just there's no way to iron this whole thing out because

[06:27] let's say I'm number 150.

[06:30] What about guy number 149?

[06:32] What about guy number 148?

[06:34] 147?

[06:35] All the people in front of me who are who are on that line waiting for games that also

[06:40] lost money who gets who gets to get it.

[06:43] See there is no way out of this that will be fair.

[06:49] You just have to accept this situation for the way it is which you know and then I

[06:53] saw people trying to blame Coin Takeer and say it's not right and how could they do this

[06:58] and it's not Coin Takeer's fault.

[07:00] None of this is Coin Takeer's fault.

[07:02] Let's not ever put the blame on Coin Takeer.

[07:05] This is 100% Dutch Pimballs grave to dig themselves out of and it's Barry's deal that he

[07:14] inked with ARA to get those games out.

[07:17] Now here is the thing.

[07:19] Here is the thing.

[07:20] Do I think the people who buy these games are scumbag and should burn in hell the way

[07:24] rare hero is going on a crusade to destroy these guys?

[07:31] I'm on the fence.

[07:32] I will say this as someone who bought a magic girl in which I too was accused of buying

[07:39] a game that was made with people's money, other people's money who got nothing, all

[07:45] the rise of buyers are the ones who were responsible for funding magic girl.

[07:50] I'll say this.

[07:52] This all sucks.

[07:53] There is no other way to skin this.

[07:55] It sucks.

[07:56] This is a loose, loose situation for everybody.

[08:00] If you are one of the lucky few that gets in on a big Lebowski and nabbed one and are like

[08:05] yeah, let me tell you something.

[08:07] It's not going to be filled with the kind of excitement you think.

[08:12] When you get something that was the source of many other people's pain and agony, it

[08:18] doesn't have the same response you think.

[08:21] I know people are going to be like well, I got one and maybe to some people it doesn't matter.

[08:25] You don't care if people think it's lame that you have something that other people got

[08:29] ripped off on.

[08:31] I'm here to tell you no matter who you are, no matter how thick and sort of bullish you

[08:36] are.

[08:37] It does not provide the same level of excitement as when you buy a game that has no

[08:42] drama and no anger and sadness attached to it.

[08:48] This is just the way it is.

[08:50] Maybe this is a little bit too much hyperbole, but the games are somewhat cursed in a way.

[08:57] It won't give that level of satisfaction that you might think.

[09:01] That being said, I still think collectors don't care.

[09:04] They don't care.

[09:06] These collectors that want rare games and there are many of you out there who the big Lebowski

[09:10] is a dream theme that the second it comes back, you would do anything to get one and you

[09:14] don't care.

[09:15] You don't care that other people got burned.

[09:17] You don't care at all.

[09:19] You'll be able to put it in your home or in your game room with good conscience and not

[09:23] even be bothered by it and just say whatever.

[09:27] Grown men who went in on a pinball machine who got burned, that's not my problem.

[09:31] That's their problem.

[09:32] Everyone knew going in on an early boutique company like this that there was a risk of losing

[09:36] your money and so be it.

[09:38] Alright, so there's that camp of people as well.

[09:42] Then there's just the people who maybe they just love the game and they want one and they

[09:46] might not feel great about getting one, but they're going to get one anyway and that's

[09:50] that.

[09:51] Then there's the lucky few.

[09:52] I think the only people that can feel really good about this are the people that had deposits

[09:58] with CoinTaker have waited three years and they're finally getting the game and the game

[10:03] number that they paid for and they were promised.

[10:07] Those are the only individuals that really deserve to get one if you ask me.

[10:14] Okay.

[10:15] Now, it's not, you know, look, this thing's going to shake out in a lot of different ways.

[10:19] But here's the thing that I think nobody is really talking about.

[10:22] If you look at the way this whole deal is structured, okay.

[10:26] At some point, at some point, CoinTaker needs to pay for those 40 games at 12,

[10:33] $1500.

[10:35] At some point, CoinTaker has to write Barry at Dutch Pimbal a check for $500,000 and give

[10:45] that check to Barry of Dutch Pimbal, a known liar, a known thief, a known manipulator

[10:55] of people.

[10:58] I would be nervous about writing that check and feeling good that those 40 games are

[11:06] then just going to come and arrive and be working and get there in a timely manner.

[11:11] I mean, that to me is the biggest red flag in this entire thing is ultimately, right

[11:18] now people's money is safe with CoinTaker, but the moment that check goes to Barry, how

[11:23] do you know what's going to happen?

[11:25] How do you know what's going to happen?

[11:28] How do you know the guy that he talked to at ARA actually has the authority to release

[11:32] the merchandise?

[11:33] How do you know ARA might not see what's happening online?

[11:36] How do you know that ARA is not on Pinside, reading people's demand for this game and

[11:42] someone doesn't say, wait a minute, why are we going to sell the games at 12,500?

[11:46] Why don't we just keep them?

[11:48] Clearly these Pimbal nerds will spend 20,000 a game.

[11:52] How do you know that it's all going to go smoothly from here on out?

[11:57] It's Barry's telling Melissa how it's all going to go down.

[12:01] And I think after all the lies, after all the spin, after all the manipulation, it's

[12:08] on us as a Pimbal community to not be absolutely idiotic and just blindly having faith now

[12:18] in a man that has done nothing but lie to you.

[12:22] And yet he's telling this to coin taker like it's all going to go according to plan.

[12:27] And look, I don't know it's not going to go according to plan, but I would be nervous.

[12:32] And I was talking to someone who's in on a game last night, not going to name his name

[12:37] and he's secure to spot.

[12:38] And he's just like, yeah, got one.

[12:40] And I started to explain to him a few things that he's probably not thinking about.

[12:44] You know, one of them being, do you really think you're, it's just going to go that smoothly?

[12:48] Like when are you going to get your game?

[12:50] Like what's the time frame?

[12:51] It's got to get on a container.

[12:52] It's got to go across the ocean.

[12:54] All these things have to happen.

[12:56] What happens if a game opens up in a box and it's not working and you pay $12,500.

[13:00] It's not exactly like there's spare parts.

[13:03] It's not exactly like there's customer service.

[13:05] It's not exactly like, you know, there's another play field or a back box that's made

[13:09] that they can send you.

[13:10] And that was the other big thing I kept mentioning to him is look, everyone spoiled that

[13:15] when you call Stern Pimball and you call American Pimball and you call spooky Pimball and you

[13:21] call Jersey Jack Pimball and when you call Chicago gaming company, everyone spoiled

[13:27] because someone picks up the phone.

[13:29] And if you buy a product from them, you have a warranty and you have spare parts and you

[13:34] have customer service because those companies are currently manufacturing games and they

[13:39] stand behind their products and Pimball is a toy that very frequently breaks.

[13:46] And when something happens and you don't have support, let me tell you, then you have a

[13:51] $12,500 box of blinking lights that's going to do nothing but frustrate you.

[13:57] And if history has shown us anything and if people really want to go back and look,

[14:02] a lot of big Lebowski's have had major issues to the point where they're not playable and

[14:09] they break down and things wear out and the bowling alley is not working and the rug

[14:13] stops working and the code's not even finished.

[14:15] I mean, there's all these reasons why people should just be careful.

[14:20] But when people get into this mindset of a fear of missing out and now you're going

[14:24] to have hundreds of collectors trying to jam through, you know, into an arena that can

[14:30] only hold 40 people and I don't think people are thinking clearly.

[14:36] And that's why I want to do this podcast because you know, my last show is just stupid.

[14:39] It's just that was just stupid me bragging about the rumor with Iceman and you know, look,

[14:44] we got some of it right.

[14:45] We got some of it wrong.

[14:46] I just thought it was a funny podcast to see even how far we've matured since those days.

[14:50] I mean, that was before TPS.

[14:52] That was before the second Twippy win and there was a lot of like back and forth with other

[14:57] podcasters and people talking smack and throwing shade.

[15:00] We've changed.

[15:01] We've matured a lot since then and I hope you appreciate that.

[15:05] But I don't think people are thinking clearly here again and I think there's a rush to

[15:10] just see all this stuff with silver balls in your eyes and not understanding the implications

[15:16] and the realities of what now has to transpire for you to get a game.

[15:20] All right.

[15:21] The other thing is this $12,500 and Russian to get one of these.

[15:26] You know, we know some of these games are going to end up on eBay for $20,000, $25,000

[15:31] because the people who didn't get a chance to get one are going to pay exorbitant amounts

[15:36] of money.

[15:37] And then the thing is this though, Barry now if this works out and the games go out, he

[15:42] then now has total control again over his game and and Dutch pinballs big Lebowski.

[15:48] And you can't tell me if that happens, they're going to remake this game.

[15:51] He's going to find another manufacturer to come in and bring this game out to people probably

[15:57] for a better price than $12,500.

[16:00] He just needs that extra capital to pay ARA $500,000 because he's out of money.

[16:06] And it also exposes one of the biggest lies of all time is he, they lied to us for all

[16:11] those months and years that all they had to do was raise the price of a game a little

[16:16] bit to get ARA making them again.

[16:19] That's all they had to do.

[16:20] Because day one, they, that's all they had to do and see, but it was clear what they

[16:25] did was they burned through all your money.

[16:28] They took your money that was supposed to go to making your games and they traveled the

[16:33] world and they acted like rock stars and they lied to you and they stole from you and

[16:37] they misled you and now you want to put your trust back in him.

[16:43] Be careful.

[16:45] Wake up people.

[16:46] Wake up.

[16:47] Own men, grown men, acting like ignorant children here.

[16:53] Okay.

[16:54] Now look, I think what happens today happens today.

[16:59] People are going to get invoices.

[17:00] They're going to, if they get one, they get one.

[17:03] You know, if I had a chance to buy one, I'd buy one as, I'm a speculator.

[17:06] I mean, I would just buy one as a speculator.

[17:09] I've always said I want to own a big Lebowski.

[17:11] You know, I don't know.

[17:12] I think they're all spoken for.

[17:15] So we'll see what happens with who gets what and how many are available today.

[17:20] Okay.

[17:21] I just think people need to ask some more questions and not run to this thing like it's

[17:27] a done deal.

[17:28] All right.

[17:29] The other thing is this.

[17:31] I put up the podcast that also said that alien pinball is coming back and I know Dave Sanders,

[17:37] the designer is like, oh, that's news to me.

[17:39] How come they're not Dave?

[17:40] I don't think, I think you need to understand like what you own in this game and do you have

[17:45] a contract that says you own the designs?

[17:47] I don't, I don't know Dave.

[17:48] I mean, I don't know what to tell you.

[17:50] I think you need to look at whatever you signed with Andrew Highway.

[17:53] My guess is Andrew Highway probably screwed you over.

[17:58] Another man that was a liar, a thief and a manipulator to people.

[18:02] I mean, a lot of people.

[18:05] Now look, pinball brothers is bringing alien pinball back at some point.

[18:10] Now I don't think Chicago gaming company is who's making it.

[18:13] I think we said that.

[18:14] But that again, remember that was months ago.

[18:17] But what I'm hearing is that pinball brothers are very wealthy.

[18:22] They are very determined and they have a lot going on behind the scenes that nobody knows

[18:27] about.

[18:28] I think clean is a done deal too.

[18:30] And alien.

[18:31] I know that they tried to I think acquire Jersey Jack pinball at one point.

[18:36] Yes, Jersey Jack pinball, these gentlemen who we made fun of a very long time ago.

[18:42] Apparently, they're very wealthy and they're very determined and they're very driven to make

[18:49] a name for themselves in the world of pinball.

[18:52] Now look, will they succeed?

[18:53] Will they not?

[18:54] Here's my take on all of this.

[18:55] And I've been following this hobby for a long time.

[18:58] There is nothing stranger to me than the pinball hobby and the desire by very wealthy men

[19:05] with very big egos and tons of pride to spend millions of dollars to become a pinball

[19:12] company only to make back thousands of dollars.

[19:16] It's this weird thing that they all want to be pinball famous, that these men have so much

[19:21] money.

[19:23] And they're just something about their egos, that they're just not happy with all the millions

[19:29] they have or billions they have in their own personal lives and their own careers because

[19:34] they're not famous.

[19:35] They just have money.

[19:36] They're just rich guys.

[19:37] They have big houses, nice clothes, wives that don't share their interests, expensive watches,

[19:44] expensive wine collections.

[19:45] They have all this stuff.

[19:47] But something inside all of them, they love pinball so much.

[19:50] It makes them feel like a little kid.

[19:53] But they want to become pinball famous and they throw money at that.

[19:57] They think they can become the Gary Stern of pinball because they have money and desire

[20:05] to get there.

[20:06] Now what they don't have is this, the knowledge to do it.

[20:13] It's the same formula for all these men.

[20:15] They have so much money, they have so much desire and look they have so much passion too.

[20:21] And they all have bruised egos.

[20:22] I mean Robert Mueller coming out saying they're going to make better games and more games

[20:26] in anyone in 2019.

[20:28] Where is that?

[20:29] It hasn't happened.

[20:30] Now look they're still working on it.

[20:32] No offense, Robert.

[20:33] But you know, Robert's egos a little bit bruised that he got up there and said that.

[20:36] But they all hit the same reality.

[20:38] They all hit the same wall.

[20:40] Sooner or later they hit the wall.

[20:42] And it's the same wall that hits everybody.

[20:45] It smacks everybody in the face.

[20:46] It's the same wall that George Gomez told me when I was in a taxi with him that would

[20:52] hit Dutch pinball.

[20:54] The same wall hits all these wealthy men and it blinds sides them.

[20:58] And that wall is called manufacturing.

[21:01] And it's so easy to go cobble together a bunch of talented artists and designers and engineers

[21:07] and all these pinball people and then say you're a pinball company now and then great.

[21:13] And then if you make a great game, make a great game that the world wants and then you get

[21:17] 5,000 orders and you've never manufactured a single game before in your entire life.

[21:23] Watch how fast the wheels fall off.

[21:26] Stern pinball is Stern pinball is Stern pinball because they have 50 years people.

[21:30] 50 years of making these things.

[21:34] And everyone else runs in and thinks they deserve to be part of Stern pinball's glory.

[21:40] And you get buffoons like John Papaduke who take everyone's money.

[21:44] One guy, he's never made a single game in his life.

[21:46] He designed a game with an army of people underneath him and he thought he was better

[21:50] than all those people.

[21:51] He thought he deserved your money to make a pinball game because he could do it and look

[21:57] what happened.

[21:58] I really want to say that somewhere around 2015, 2016, this hobby has jumped the shark.

[22:05] And it's jumped the shark because everyone just keeps throwing in their desires to make

[22:09] pinball.

[22:11] Some successful, some not, some have succeeded, some have failed, some people have lost

[22:15] money, some people got games.

[22:17] But it's got into the point now where alien pinball is going to come back and Queen's going

[22:23] to come back.

[22:24] And then we have deep root making what they're making.

[22:26] And if cactus canning coming back, my head is spinning.

[22:30] As someone who follows this hobby, there are way too many games coming out.

[22:34] They are way too expensive and they are, it is all going to collapse on itself.

[22:40] It's all going to collapse on itself.

[22:42] You know, it's like Stern's not going to just go away.

[22:45] Stern has, see Stern has the manufacturing and they have the distribution.

[22:49] Nobody else has those two things.

[22:51] Nobody else.

[22:52] How many games is Jersey Jack pinball making a day?

[22:54] How many games is Stern making a day?

[22:56] You know, it is comical that we even waste our time with like Dutch pinball.

[23:01] 40 games people, 40 games.

[23:05] Right?

[23:06] 40 games after three to five years of drama, of heartache, of people losing money, of people

[23:13] going to bed at night, wondering if they're going to get their game for years, men having

[23:16] sleepless nights, wives of these men being like, you're a freaking idiot.

[23:20] You just lost $8,500.

[23:21] Like, what are you doing?

[23:23] You know, 40 for 40 games.

[23:26] Stern makes 40 games by lunch today, by lunch.

[23:30] Stern is going to sell those games in a day, on to the next, on to the next, on to the

[23:34] next.

[23:35] And they get so much crap from people on the hobby.

[23:37] So much, oh yeah, complaining about this, complaining about that.

[23:40] And I almost feel like a shame that we ever even do complain about Stern pinball.

[23:45] Right?

[23:46] I mean, Jersey Jack, you know, he's trying.

[23:48] He's got his big factory.

[23:50] He doesn't do anywhere near the volume, anywhere near the volume of Stern.

[23:55] And so like, I will always champion and applaud pinball companies that don't lose people's

[24:01] money.

[24:02] That is honest with us.

[24:04] That is straightforward with us.

[24:06] That doesn't try to mislead us.

[24:07] That doesn't lie to pinball media.

[24:10] That doesn't, that doesn't hoodwink us.

[24:13] That doesn't give us spin.

[24:15] And you know, the only companies that I feel like have done that, you know, that have

[24:20] been like, had integrity and honesty and like should have your support.

[24:26] Is it Dutch pinball?

[24:27] Is it the remnants of alien pinball?

[24:29] Is pinball brothers?

[24:31] You know, it's Stern pinball.

[24:33] It's spooky pinball.

[24:35] It's Chicago gaming company.

[24:37] Okay?

[24:39] It's American pinball.

[24:40] It's P3 multi morphing.

[24:43] It's, you know, who makes, who makes?

[24:50] What is it?

[24:53] What's that new game?

[24:54] Cosmic Carnival.

[24:55] Is it some coast pinball?

[24:56] I mean, these companies, like they exist.

[24:58] They don't lie to you.

[25:00] They don't spin it.

[25:01] They just tell you we have a game if you want it, you can have it.

[25:04] And that's how it should be.

[25:05] And I love covering those companies competing with each other.

[25:09] These other companies, you know, as much as, you know, the rumors were right.

[25:12] Yeah, but these rumors aren't what we really want.

[25:15] We're dragging up.

[25:16] We're resurrecting some of the most dramatic and annoying conversations in pinball.

[25:21] And now it's like it's sending new groups of people into tail spins.

[25:25] So look, look, we're about to see Keith Ellwyn's game in two weeks.

[25:30] He put up the two weeks that from a total recall, a little bit after Comic Con.

[25:36] I love it.

[25:37] I wouldn't have stern moved you out of Comic Con because of me.

[25:38] Now, it's, so we're going to get it.

[25:40] And did you like Keith Ellwyn's new game?

[25:41] And I hear it is spectacular.

[25:44] I want to get excited about that stuff.

[25:47] I don't want to get excited about people beating each other up to steal someone's big

[25:51] Lebowski and see people who lost money cry all over again.

[25:54] I don't want, I don't want to get excited by that.

[25:56] I don't think that's exciting.

[25:58] If pinball brothers can come out of the woodworks with, you know, a whole new pinball offering,

[26:03] I heard they have six games in the works.

[26:05] Six games from pinball brothers.

[26:08] Deeper is supposed to have like 15 white woods or whatever.

[26:12] Sterns going to always have four to five games you can actually buy.

[26:15] Jersey Jacks now on a schedule of two a year.

[26:18] It's ridiculous.

[26:19] It is absolutely ridiculous.

[26:21] It's going to be a total buyers market.

[26:24] And if you don't have a good product, you're going to be at a business in six months.

[26:27] Welcome to the new world of pinball.

[26:29] You guys wanted it.

[26:30] You asked for it.

[26:32] All these companies saw a bunch of people throwing money at John Papaduke and this is the end result

[26:36] of it.

[26:37] This is the end result.

[26:39] People are so dumb, they'll spend $16,000 on a game they haven't even seen.

[26:45] Imagine what they'll spend on a game that is somewhat real.

[26:49] And then imagine what they'll spend on a game that actually is real.

[26:54] Right.

[26:55] So it's unbelievable.

[26:56] It's unbelievable.

[26:57] Everyone, my final thoughts on all of this, just be careful with what you do with your

[27:02] money.

[27:03] If you're going on any of these ventures that aren't those reputable companies I just mentioned,

[27:08] it's on you.

[27:09] At some point, it's on you.

[27:12] If you buy games that you that should belong to other people, you just have to live with

[27:16] those consequences and when people are going to say about you, if you still don't get your

[27:21] big Lebowski, I really feel sorry for you.

[27:23] You didn't deserve to lose your money.

[27:25] You were lied to and you were ripped off.

[27:27] And how many second chances do we keep continuing to give these people?

[27:31] I'm sorry.

[27:32] You know, part of me feels like, you know, part of me, I'll leave you this.

[27:35] I feel like the second Barry gets that check for $500,000.

[27:39] Right.

[27:40] He's going to be driving down the road and the exit to the right is going to be ARA and

[27:47] the exit to the left is going to be a road to like a yacht.

[27:53] And he's going to like say, well, do I go right?

[27:57] Pay them the money and you know, end up no better off financially or do I go left and

[28:02] sail off into the sunset with everyone's money never to be heard from again.

[28:06] I feel like he's going to get on board and your highways hydrophoil and the both of them

[28:11] are going to like ride that hydrophoil off of the flat earth and like cruise all the way

[28:16] to Jupiter with our money.

[28:18] Anyway, everyone, that's my take on all of this.

[28:21] Okay.

[28:22] Didn't even talk about Willy Wonka, right?

[28:24] For freshening and to have something else to talk about.

[28:26] Everyone, I love you guys.

[28:28] Thanks for tuning into Canadian's pinball podcast.

[28:30] Thanks for listening to all these episodes and my take on pinball.

[28:33] I really appreciate it.

[28:41] this hobby.
