[00:00] All right.

[00:02] I'm so curious to see if this Neo Geo works.

[00:06] It has been a few years since this thing was restored

[00:12] all the way from Japan to France, Julian over there,

[00:16] this great restoration work.

[00:19] And I was just in the midst of like moving,

[00:22] having a second baby, COVID hit, all this stuff happened.

[00:26] And so we're gonna do an unwrapping of the,

[00:30] I mean, some would say this might be the holy grail

[00:32] of Neo Geo collecting.

[00:34] Let's get some people in the house there.

[00:35] Let's go share this with my pinball fanatics.

[00:41] Let's see here.

[00:42] This is gonna be fun because I just, I hope it works.

[00:47] This is always a nerve-wracking moment

[00:50] for those of you in the arcade space whenever you,

[00:53] whenever you unwrap or unbox an item that is shipped

[00:57] across oceans and continents, will it work

[01:01] when you turn it on?

[01:02] Will the CRT monitor be in one piece?

[01:04] You know, all these things can go wrong.

[01:08] Let's see, come join live.

[01:10] Let's do this.

[01:12] Hold on one second, gang.

[01:14] I love social media for this stuff.

[01:17] The rest of it, absolute garbage.

[01:19] We're gonna do a lab stream right now.

[01:22] I love Neo Geo, by the way.

[01:23] Like it is still to this day my favorite system.

[01:26] I have an SC14, which we're gonna unwrap,

[01:30] a Neo 19 and SC19 and a red mini MBS unit

[01:36] the small ones they made.

[01:38] So you can't, you can't say, I'm not a Neo Geo fan,

[01:45] but I grew up with Neo Geo.

[01:47] And so that is why I love the system so much.

[01:51] It brings back so many fun memories.

[01:53] And you know, look, I will say this,

[01:55] the Neo Geo community, the cart collecting community,

[01:58] the form is brutal, man.

[02:00] I mean, they drove me out of Dodge like instantly

[02:03] when I was just trying to buy carts.

[02:04] I never realized there could be so much anger

[02:07] around something that so many people love.

[02:10] Let's do this.

[02:12] Okay, next.

[02:15] But you do.

[02:17] I'm gonna back stamp it.

[02:20] Publish.

[02:22] Hold on one second.

[02:22] We're gonna do this.

[02:23] I'm wrapping guys in one second.

[02:25] I know you're like, this is the worst video ever.

[02:27] Just moved into this new house a few months ago.

[02:29] I love it.

[02:30] Not a lot of room for Pimball or arcade machines,

[02:33] but you know, you make sacrifices for the family

[02:37] and this is that sacrifice.

[02:38] All right, so we got people here.

[02:39] Let's do this.

[02:40] All right, so I've got, I'm gonna turn the camera around.

[02:44] I've got an MBS cart.

[02:46] What do we got here?

[02:47] We got Metal Slug 3.

[02:49] By the way, people who collect the AES carts

[02:53] and spend tens of thousands of dollars

[02:55] on like Neo Turf masters,

[02:57] it is the weirdest and strangest subculture imaginable.

[03:02] All right, so let's do this.

[03:04] Let's walk over.

[03:07] I've got my cup of Joe.

[03:09] This thing got delivered at six o'clock in the morning.

[03:12] Little tour here.

[03:14] Got my Supreme Chair.

[03:15] I love it.

[03:17] All right, you ready for it?

[03:19] There she is.

[03:19] She's so small.

[03:21] Let's set this up.

[03:24] So you guys can see, I think, right until the here might be best.

[03:28] Yeah, all right.

[03:31] Top of my, my vase, turn it down a little bit.

[03:36] Okay.

[03:38] As you can see, I'm a five foot,

[03:42] a five foot nine.

[03:45] This thing is tiny.

[03:48] It looks like someone just put him in SC19 in a vase

[03:53] and just squeezed.

[03:56] I forced a lot into you.

[03:58] Nice, Brian.

[04:02] So I did want to sell this.

[04:04] You know, I wanted to sell other ones.

[04:05] I listed them.

[04:08] I'll say this though.

[04:09] People have no idea how hard it is to find these things

[04:12] and good.

[04:13] I have no idea what this restoration is going to look like.

[04:15] They needed to do work to the hood.

[04:17] They needed to do everything.

[04:19] So let's see, I've got a new coin slot

[04:21] on the outside and original one that I'm going to put on this.

[04:23] I think this one has a different one, but let's open it up.

[04:31] Where to start?

[04:34] I think we, I'm going to pull it out a little bit.

[04:38] Think about these things too, gang, is like,

[04:41] you can't find these things for sale.

[04:44] Like, I hate the whole market of Neo Geo

[04:48] collector quality cabinets like these

[04:50] because everyone's like, oh, it's only worth $2,000.

[04:53] Like, find me one.

[04:54] Yeah, I get you might be able to find a destroyed one

[04:56] in Japan for $3,000, add shipping to that, add restoration,

[05:01] add all the work you need to be done.

[05:03] And no one ever accounts for the hours it takes

[05:07] to actually restore these things.

[05:09] It's like the labor is supposed to be free.

[05:15] So let's pull her out so we can get

[05:20] get underneath this wrap.

[05:23] Kind of just like what I like to do is get a knife

[05:27] and just, you know, just put away from the unit itself.

[05:32] Here's the key.

[05:40] Hopefully it works.

[05:43] Now this is not that.

[05:50] This is one of the, this is the most fun moment ever, gang,

[05:54] is the unraveling of the sarcophagus if you will.

[05:58] It's just something about this.

[06:02] It's so much fun.

[06:08] I really should open the bottom up

[06:10] because there's just so much of this.

[06:13] What I don't want to do is puncture.

[06:23] I don't want to get anywhere near the actual unit itself.

[06:28] I'm going to make this even more.

[06:30] So you guys can see.

[06:34] Just keep on wrapping it this way.

[06:36] I need to show you guys that.

[06:39] It's going to be glorious when we see that blue for the first time.

[07:03] Oh, looking at here.

[07:08] I'm going to get you guys in here.

[07:10] We're starting to see those beautiful neogeocolors.

[07:15] I mean, let's do this.

[07:22] Let's get over here.

[07:24] Let's swing around.

[07:27] So you can see the full thing.

[07:29] All right, that's perfect.

[07:32] All right.

[07:34] So let me, I'm just going up and down this thing and wrapping it.

[07:36] You get you guys a little bit closer.

[07:42] I'm worried he's going to step.

[07:44] I know I'm worried about stabbing the camera too.

[07:46] That's why I always sharp edge out.

[08:32] All right, starting to get some progress here.

[08:53] When I wrapped, when I had my SC19, I had them create it.

[09:00] Which was a lot easier to open up.

[09:03] Because when you create it, you just take a crowbar and pop it open.

[09:10] Better to work from the backside.

[09:16] All right.

[09:18] Good advice.

[09:20] Turn around.

[09:31] There we go.

[09:40] There's cardboard here.

[09:41] So I'm not going to risk stabbing or puncturing.

[09:45] But I'm going to be very careful.

[10:01] All right.

[10:03] All right.

[10:25] All right.

[10:26] Now we're getting out.

[10:28] So I'm going to put this tape off here.

[10:43] So I make sure there's not near any of the glue.

[10:58] Oh, there she is.

[11:13] That Neo Geoblue.

[11:20] So I bought this unit.

[11:23] I want to say.

[11:26] I want to say like maybe four years ago, right, right before COVID or right when COVID

[11:33] hit.

[11:34] It's been sitting at coin taker for like three years.

[11:38] God bless Melissa and Chris.

[11:39] She's like, get rid of this thing.

[11:43] So we got a lot of tape here.

[11:53] I'm going to try to get the scene here.

[12:00] All right.

[12:04] All right.

[12:05] You guys can have a look at this.

[12:33] Starting to see some of those Neo Geob colors.

[12:57] The thing is when you're doing this, don't say patient and rush any of this.

[13:04] When you get impatient and rush, that's when you make a mistake.

[13:10] And you're like, you'll scratch it.

[13:13] And you OCD collectors out there.

[13:18] You're driving nuts.

[13:25] All right.

[13:33] We're almost broke.

[13:39] Okay.

[13:42] This should start to get a lot easier now.

[13:46] I know.

[13:47] I just stabbed myself in the knee with the tip of the knife.

[13:53] This tape needs the most fun to peel back.

[14:08] I'm going to go back.

[14:15] Give you guys a little bit more height here.

[14:28] All right.

[14:29] You can see we're getting the back off.

[14:52] We really care for our hood.

[14:59] The rest of the most fragile part.

[15:04] The last thing you want to do after a restoration process like this is mess up your hood.

[15:13] I had a little hairline fracture on the hood because I took it off too fast.

[15:20] Never again.

[15:38] Let's turn it around.

[15:40] I think we're going to start to get to the good stuff.

[15:52] All right.

[15:53] As you can see.

[15:57] Starting to see the unit.

[16:06] I've got the original one here.

[16:13] This looks really good.

[16:21] Where did I put the knife?

[16:31] Just kind of button on the ground.

[16:33] Is that a good sign?

[16:35] I don't know.

[16:38] Maybe it's an extra one.

[16:39] Hopefully it's an extra one.

[16:43] All right.

[16:44] I've seen you have lost my knife in this madness.

[16:46] Oh, there it is.

[16:49] Okay.

[16:50] Let's keep cutting away.

[16:59] Okay.

[17:09] I mean, I hope I didn't ruin a lot of credit.

[17:35] Really packed this thing in.

[17:42] We've got to be really careful.

[17:51] You know, damage is good.

[18:03] Okay.

[18:13] Okay.

[18:23] Okay.

[18:33] Okay.

[18:43] Okay.

[19:01] Now this should come out.

[19:05] Let's see what we got here.

[19:09] This is from France.

[19:16] What do you got?

[19:19] That's a good joke.

[19:25] It needs a gizmo 2000.

[19:27] Okay.

[19:34] Okay.

[19:48] So, grease on here.

[20:08] It's cracked a little bit here.

[20:09] You can see.

[20:15] I'm not the best hood.

[20:25] It's not the best hood.

[20:33] It's not perfect.

[20:43] It's not terrible.

[20:53] It's just a cool little unique.

[20:57] I guess it's got to be level because it's right where the cut back happens.

[21:04] All right.

[21:07] All right.

[21:11] I can take my glasses off so I can see it a little better.

[21:20] It's a good top one.

[21:30] You can see the sides.

[21:44] I'm trying to get this.

[21:54] Okay.

[22:04] Okay.

[22:14] Okay.

[22:24] Okay.

[22:34] Oh my god. There's so much.

[22:36] All right.

[22:37] So let's walk around it.

[22:39] Okay.

[22:46] You can see how small it is.

[22:49] I'll tell you what I'm showing out here.

[22:53] See the guy cut it here.

[23:03] See that?

[23:06] Now look.

[23:08] Not sure if.

[23:17] You know, for the price of these things.

[23:20] See, it just needs to be painted again.

[23:22] You could sand that down, paint it perfect.

[23:24] I always think like when people do these things, you know.

[23:27] I wouldn't send it to customer unless it was absolutely perfect.

[23:30] But you know, that's just me. That's just me.

[23:33] I'm a little old.

[23:35] Come on in here.

[23:38] Let me get some air.

[23:40] The big moment of truth that it works or not.

[23:50] You guys think it's going to work?

[23:55] All right.

[23:58] Let's see if this thing works.

[24:00] These, these go for the SC 14s.

[24:05] It depends who you ask.

[24:06] I mean, in good condition.

[24:09] This one's really nice.

[24:10] You know, again, I would, I would, I would, I would just have the hood.

[24:14] We finished again.

[24:15] You know, just just to get rid of these lines.

[24:18] Which you could do.

[24:20] You need it like another.

[24:22] It's like, it needed like another sanded down, another coat of paint.

[24:26] That's easy to do.

[24:27] I don't care about that.

[24:28] Like you could always know the fact that it has the original hood.

[24:32] It's like the important part.

[24:38] All right.

[24:39] What we're going to do now.

[24:42] But I think.

[24:46] Got the key.

[24:47] I think, you know, for SC 14, you're looking at.

[24:51] You're looking at like 10 Gs or more.

[24:54] Like in this condition, probably more.

[24:57] But.

[24:58] Also.

[25:01] I feel like the vibe around arcade collecting and cabinet collecting has changed a lot.

[25:06] People are just kind of the.

[25:08] The phone low around it all is a little bit over.

[25:10] I think anyone who wants these things kind of has them.

[25:14] Okay.

[25:24] I mean, I will say the rest of the cabinet is absolutely gorgeous.

[25:32] I'm going to try to hide the wires.

[25:52] Okay.

[26:02] Okay.

[26:24] I deal with how to wires.

[26:26] I don't know the time.

[26:27] I don't know the time.

[26:30] I don't know the time.

[26:31] All right.

[26:32] So here we are.

[26:33] Let's get better angle here for you guys.

[26:37] See if she works.

[26:38] It's open her up.

[26:39] Put a card in here and turn her on.

[26:41] Hopefully the whole thing doesn't blow the house sky high.

[26:45] Now.

[26:53] I think she inside how beautiful this does look inside.

[26:56] And he does a really good job.

[26:59] And it's very clean in here.

[27:06] All right.

[27:07] It's not being.

[27:20] It's not.

[27:26] It's not.

[27:27] It's not.

[27:28] It's not.

[27:30] It's not secured to anything, which is kind of crazy to me.

[27:34] You know, normally on a, it would be a lock here for the coin box.

[27:38] Well, let's put in metal slug three.

[27:42] Into slot one.

[27:48] And then I can just add a little bit of metal slug.

[27:54] Which is.

[27:55] As your motherboard here.

[27:57] I'm going to show you.

[27:58] It slides out.

[28:00] Did a good job on all that.

[28:01] Unless she's turn her on and see what happens.

[28:02] Here's what's cool.

[28:03] It has 60,000 plays.

[28:06] When this thing was in an arcade, 60,000.

[28:09] That, you know, the vibe that by four.

[28:12] For quarters.

[28:15] That's a lot of money these operators are making back in a day.

[28:17] I don't see.

[28:19] If anything goes on.

[28:21] Let's do this.

[28:24] I heard a good sound.

[28:29] Oh, there we go.

[28:34] Where's the vine?

[28:37] It's working.

[28:41] It's working.

[28:43] Here's the volume is my next question.

[28:47] You know, the board's on here.

[28:50] Thank you.

[28:59] Oh, here we go.

[29:04] Thank you.

[29:10] You need to get that Neo Geo startup sound, right?

[29:14] The monitor looks amazing.

[29:16] Here we go.

[29:17] We need the iconic startup sound ready.

[29:40] I guess the ROM.

[29:44] It's got like a bios on it.

[29:50] Okay.

[29:58] Huh.

[29:59] I don't know why it's going to that.

[30:05] Oh, I don't know why it's going to that.

[30:09] Thank you.

[30:13] Super.

[30:20] Mission was.

[30:22] I mean, the colors are so good.

[30:26] It's actually really neat.

[30:28] I've never seen an SC-14 before.

[30:32] I think it's interesting about it.

[30:34] It works.

[30:36] Tiny little hood damage that we could fix.

[30:40] When does this thing turn fun?

[30:45] I mean, it's fine.

[30:55] All right.

[31:01] Clean up this mess.

[31:11] And there she is.

[31:40] I'm going to have to do this.

[31:46] I will say, after having these units,

[31:52] I see the blue button.

[31:54] There's a little damage.

[31:56] After having these units and chasing them down,

[32:00] the chase to find these cabinets,

[32:03] which is not even a chase.

[32:04] You know, you just, you either got to be in Japan and

[32:08] you're in Japan.

[32:11] The chase to get them is always far more rewarding than having them

[32:16] because the one thing that you can't recapture when you buy these

[32:20] old cabinets is just, I don't know, the fun of going into the arcade

[32:24] and everyone was in there playing and enjoying like Neo-Gew

[32:28] like in a Tadei when those were the best graphics in the world.

[32:32] It's still fun.

[32:34] I'm kind of, I'm done arcade cabinet collecting.

[32:37] I'm done buying a ton of pinball machines.

[32:40] I just want to have a few stuff that I enjoy.

[32:43] And that's that.

[32:44] I think that's sort of as I get older and like that's my,

[32:46] that's my new sort of feeling is just have a few things.

[32:50] We'll see if this thing even stays here.

[32:52] You know, I think it looks kind of neat in this open concept.

[32:55] But again, I don't, I don't know.

[32:59] I'm kind of like.

[33:04] I'll have to see.

[33:10] And I definitely like, you know, if the price is right,

[33:14] I would just sell it.

[33:15] I mean, I again, like I have too many.

[33:17] I don't have enough time.

[33:19] And that's it.

[33:20] But it fits well there.

[33:21] It does, it does fit well there.

[33:22] I think it's kind of nice.

[33:23] So I'll see when you walk in.

[33:26] By the way, the frame, Samsung and the frame is the best.

[33:30] When you, when you see like coming in out the back.

[33:35] You know, I think it looks cool there.

[33:37] The colors go with everything in this house.

[33:41] All right. So there you have it.

[33:43] After three years in storage.

[33:47] Oh, SC nine, I see 14.

[33:50] All right.

[33:52] I mean, I have, I've had so many of these things.

[33:54] It doesn't even, it doesn't hit anymore like wow.

[33:57] I prefer pinball because pinball like every game's random pinball.

[34:04] You can like, there's like, I don't know.

[34:06] It's like pinball is like having a golf course in a box because it's just you against the game.

[34:10] And every game is different.

[34:11] When you play these games, you know, it's always the same game.

[34:15] You're just studying the code and, you know, it's all repetition.

[34:19] Anyway, guys, happy Sunday.

[34:21] Thank you.

[34:22] I do love this house.

[34:23] It is so nice.

[34:24] I can see my Baba neon sign.

[34:28] Can you, how do I get closer on Baba?

[34:33] Will he eventually?

[34:36] There it is.

[34:38] I got to get out of frame.

[34:39] Everybody be good.

[34:40] Happy Sunday.

[34:41] Thanks for being a Canadian member.

[34:42] If you're not joined, if you're a neo-geo guy, my condolences.

[34:45] You guys are overpaying for everything.

[34:47] Bye.
