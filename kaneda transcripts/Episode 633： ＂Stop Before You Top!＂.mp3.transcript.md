[00:00] The boys of the end like Billy Coil was so you know I'm a thousand right now for Christmas

[00:09] time.

[00:10] Alright, one cup of coffee, no sleep, let's do it episode 633.

[00:18] Let's see how much Pimball News we can give you in a short period of time because I am

[00:22] tired but I am never tired of giving you the latest and greatest in Pimball.

[00:26] We're going to start right out right now.

[00:28] You are going to see Rush Pimball by Stern teased, maybe revealed, probably teased December

[00:36] 27th.

[00:37] Now December 27th is a Monday so does that mean that we are going to get the teaser on

[00:44] the 27th and the full game reveal that Tuesday.

[00:48] So we shall see but you're hearing it here on Canatus Pimball podcast, Rush Pimball by

[00:53] John Borg and Stern December 27th.

[00:57] So mark your calendars.

[01:00] What else is happening in the Pimball world?

[01:02] We are also going to see an unboxing of Home Pins Spinal Tap by I believe RE Pimball

[01:09] somewhere in Europe.

[01:10] I think they said they have the game in their possession.

[01:14] So Home Pins is going to just mail the product out there and let it be unboxed by one of

[01:19] their distributors.

[01:21] Do you care about Home Pins Spinal Tap?

[01:23] I don't think many people do care but we are always excited to see new Pimball machines

[01:30] out in the world and Home Pins has arguably nowhere to go but up because they've released

[01:36] maybe the worst game in the last 25,000 years which is Thunderbirds and so will Mike's

[01:42] creation of having an LCD screen and an orange DMD screen in the same game.

[01:50] How will it work?

[01:51] Will this game be able to compete on a modern level with modern games?

[01:55] Who knows man, they're handing out Celts as the best modern Pimball machine at Pimball

[02:00] shows.

[02:01] So maybe anything can sell these days.

[02:03] We shall see that sometime hopefully maybe two day we will see Spinal Tap.

[02:08] Alright, what else is going on in the Pimball world?

[02:10] There's another bit of news for you guys out there.

[02:13] If you pre-ordered Cactus Canyon Ellie, right?

[02:17] 1250 Ellie's.

[02:18] I am hearing that there is a delay and the delay is the Ellie has some different metal for

[02:24] that train that goes across the Chuchu track and if you ordered an Ellie your Ellie's

[02:30] will not be going on the line until April or May.

[02:35] So there is a significant delay on getting Cactus Canyon Ellie's out the door.

[02:40] They are going to make the SES first.

[02:43] So once again you were shown a game, months and months and months before it will even be

[02:49] in a box.

[02:50] I'm not sure why they did this.

[02:53] Why did CGC do this?

[02:54] They should have waited until they had all of the parts and all the things ready to go

[02:59] for the Ellie games because as we know and as I always say on Canadian Pimball podcast

[03:05] the Ellie buyers should be at the front of the line.

[03:09] You spend the most money, you've got the nicest version of the game, you don't want to

[03:14] wait to get your game.

[03:16] And also like this whole CGC thing with SE pluses and back glasses being offered to everybody

[03:22] and now everybody can buy the top or I'm not even sure what the special version of this

[03:26] game is anymore.

[03:28] But for those Ellie buyers out there, set your calendars April May.

[03:32] Now will we see Toy Story by April May?

[03:35] I don't know, right?

[03:36] See this is the problem with all of this locking your money in and the games aren't even

[03:40] on the line.

[03:41] I think this practice of buying these things, months and months and months before they're

[03:47] even going to ship to you is absolutely silly.

[03:50] You might as well just wait to see what comes out next.

[03:53] There are so many games coming.

[03:55] Why would you want to lock your money in?

[03:56] I mean I regret locking my money into Ultraman.

[03:59] Why?

[04:00] Why do I have $2,000?

[04:02] Locked in to Ultraman.

[04:03] Why?

[04:04] I have to wait like a year to get the game.

[04:06] I know I asked for the last one on the line, but now you know this FOMO and running towards

[04:10] all these things, is it paying out for us?

[04:13] I'm not sure.

[04:14] I'm not so sure anymore.

[04:15] Alright, so Cactus Canyon delayed April May for Ellie's.

[04:19] What else is happening?

[04:20] Now I'm about to tell you some stuff that most people don't know and that is this.

[04:24] Stern Pimball is not stupid.

[04:26] Well you knew that, but Stern Pimball is not stupid and they are not going to leave

[04:30] money on the table.

[04:32] Now for so many of you out there, for some reason the thing you've been valuing and the

[04:36] thing you've been chasing more than anything are these Stern Toppers, right?

[04:41] How do I get a Topper?

[04:42] People are spending $3,000, $5,000 on Ecto 1 Toppers, Black Knight Toppers, Deadpool Toppers,

[04:50] things that they feel like they can't get their hands on.

[04:52] Now I'm here to tell you right now that what I'm about to tell you is going to cause

[04:57] two parties to be regretful.

[05:00] It's going to cause people who should have sold their stuff when the market was hot

[05:03] to regret not selling their stuff.

[05:05] It's also going to cause people who bought at the height of the market to regret that

[05:10] they ran in and spent a fortune on stuff that's about to be remade.

[05:16] Are you sitting down?

[05:18] Canada is here to tell you right now that first and foremost, the Mandalorian Topper is

[05:22] coming.

[05:23] It is the most elaborate Topper Stern has ever done.

[05:26] It is the droid from the Mandalorian show and it spins around with his arms and shoots

[05:31] and whatnot.

[05:32] It's interactive with the game.

[05:34] That is still coming.

[05:35] Now that just goes to show how much of a delay and backlog there is over at Stern.

[05:40] Stern also has a historical track record to keep up with Star Wars Toppers.

[05:45] If they didn't make you wait years for your Star Wars Topper, then they're not doing

[05:50] it right.

[05:51] Stern loves to make the Star Wars Topper the slowest thing they've ever made ever.

[05:56] We're not here to talk about the Mando Topper because no Topper can save Mandalorian from

[06:01] not having magic.

[06:02] We're here to talk about the fact that Stern is about to rerun and make a boatload more

[06:08] of El Vira Toppers.

[06:10] If you paid over for an El Vira Topper, you just got burned.

[06:14] They're making more Jurassic Park Toppers.

[06:16] They're making more Deadpool Toppers.

[06:19] The Deadpool Topper is going to have an increase of $200.

[06:23] Isn't it funny?

[06:24] It's just plastic.

[06:26] There's nothing here that's a material cost, but Stern realizes the market is hot.

[06:31] That is all profit in the bank for Stern Pimbal.

[06:34] And good for them.

[06:35] Good for them.

[06:36] Okay.

[06:37] So Deadpool's coming out.

[06:38] But here's the big one.

[06:39] Here's the big one.

[06:40] And unless George Gomez is telling people lies, George Gomez has said to somebody, and

[06:45] I'm just going to say what I heard that in 2022, Stern Pimbal will make more Ecto

[06:53] One Ghost Busters Toppers.

[06:56] Now this is amazing news because for those of you out there who have your Ghost Busters

[07:00] and they sold so many Ghost Busters, Stern making more Ecto One Toppers is music to your

[07:06] ears.

[07:07] But where it gets really interesting is this.

[07:10] For Stern to make more Ecto One Toppers, that means they're going to be renewing the

[07:15] license for Ghost Busters.

[07:17] So does this mean that Stern is going to do another run of Ghost Buster games?

[07:23] And if they were smart, not only would they turn on more premiums, but I absolutely

[07:28] could see Stern Pimbal doing an SPLE, a Stay Puff limited edition of this game.

[07:36] Why not?

[07:37] Why not make some nice vaulted super limited edition of Ghost Busters charge whatever you

[07:44] want for the game and watch people fight hand over fist to get their hands on it.

[07:49] I mean, look what they did with Elvira.

[07:51] They're going to do it and they're going to do it with games like Ghost Busters.

[07:55] So I fully expect to see more Toppers from Ghost Busters in 2022, but it would also make

[08:01] total sense for Stern to reveal another version of Ghost Busters.

[08:06] I can already hear some people complaining like how could they announce another Ghost Busters

[08:10] when they have to make all these other games and they're so backlogged.

[08:14] Here's the thing, Stern doesn't care if it's backlogged because the line is going.

[08:19] All of those orders that they have, that's money in the bank for them already.

[08:24] So why not reveal something new?

[08:26] Because they know.

[08:27] Because Stern knows this.

[08:28] If they release a new Ghost Busters and it's some super limited edition and you're waiting

[08:32] on your game, what are you going to go do?

[08:34] What are you going to go buy?

[08:36] They don't have any competition.

[08:38] You can't take your money from Stern and go buy anything else that's ready to ship.

[08:43] You can't.

[08:44] You're going to go buy a Guns and Roses.

[08:45] No, you probably already have one or you don't want one.

[08:49] Are you going to go buy a cactus canyon?

[08:50] Well, you can't even get one.

[08:51] Are you going to go buy legends of a Hala?

[08:53] Absolutely not.

[08:54] Right?

[08:55] What are you going to go buy?

[08:56] And so they have all of you.

[08:57] They have all of you because they control about 90% of the pinball volume and they have

[09:03] about 99% of the games you really want and that's just where Stern is at.

[09:09] So they don't really care.

[09:10] They control the entire market.

[09:13] Now it's crazy that they've been sitting on the sidelines watching all these toppers

[09:16] go for all this money.

[09:17] I didn't hear anything about another black knight topper but if I were a betting man,

[09:22] I think they will absolutely eventually make more of those.

[09:26] You see this little period between 2021 and 2022 or 2020 and 2022, this pinball inflated

[09:33] period, it's not going to last and everything is a potential remake.

[09:39] As long as there is money to be made, we will always see these things come back in different

[09:44] forms.

[09:45] Think about it.

[09:46] In five years from now, let's say Jersey Jack Pinball goes out of business.

[09:50] Someone will just remake Pirates of the Caribbean one day.

[09:54] Why not?

[09:55] The same way we're remaking monster bashes and medieval madness is someone will just

[09:59] get the license.

[10:00] They'll get all the designs for the game and they'll just remake it because there's

[10:05] money to be made.

[10:07] There's so much money to be made in pinball that I don't think anything, anything that

[10:12] is a potential money maker is going to be ignored.

[10:15] Alright, so speaking of making games and getting games out the door, I've been getting

[10:18] some heat for just trying to call the bluff a little bit of haggis and I'm not even

[10:23] sure it's a bluff but let me tell you guys something right now and I mean this.

[10:27] I don't understand why people have an issue if haggis pinball says they're making games

[10:33] in January.

[10:34] All I've been saying is if games are going to go on the line in January, can they share

[10:40] with us all of the parts needed to make those games to make those games next month.

[10:45] They have to have the parts in house now and so if you're making 250 mermaid additions

[10:50] of fathom, then just show us a thousand legs, 250 coin doors, 250 playfields and I don't

[10:58] understand why people are so hesitant to hold these companies accountable.

[11:02] I didn't say January, they did.

[11:05] I didn't say they're going to make these games six months ago, they did.

[11:09] And I've said it too, I do think that haggis will end up delivering these games eventually.

[11:14] The real question becomes if eventually takes forever, then how long can they burn money

[11:20] without getting games out the door?

[11:22] Look only 250 you are on the line for this game, that's nothing.

[11:26] Think about it for a minute.

[11:27] Stern pinball makes in half a week, half a week's time.

[11:31] All of the fathom mermaid additions sold.

[11:34] It's not even competition.

[11:36] They're truly a boutique company.

[11:38] I hope it works out for all you guys, but I also think this community sets itself up to

[11:45] be burned time and time again.

[11:48] And I also will say that I think there's a lot of people out there.

[11:51] There's a lot of people out there that don't understand their rights.

[11:55] If you buy a game from a company, you have a right to ask questions and to see the progress

[12:01] of these institutions.

[12:03] It's not just like you send your money over and then you're not allowed to ask questions.

[12:07] You're not allowed to see photos.

[12:09] And I think there needs to be more transparency, especially these pre-order models.

[12:15] And I don't buy it for a minute.

[12:16] I don't talk about deeproot very much, but I think it's total bogus.

[12:21] How we completely forgave the deeproot employees that are a part of this community for not

[12:25] saying stuff, not speaking up.

[12:27] Like, oh, they thought production was about to happen.

[12:29] No, they knew nothing was going on over there.

[12:32] They knew all of it.

[12:33] And they went on podcasts and they told you all how amazing the games were going to be.

[12:37] And then everyone just forgives them.

[12:40] And I know Canadian Spinball podcasts sometimes has to take the other approach and say, I don't

[12:44] care about being friends with these companies.

[12:47] I just want to hold them accountable to the things they're telling you, to the promises

[12:52] they're making you.

[12:53] Okay.

[12:54] Shouldn't we be doing that?

[12:55] And most a name thing ever.

[12:57] If you just zoom out a little bit, we're buying toys before they're even made.

[13:03] We're paying for toys six months before they're even in production.

[13:08] Why?

[13:09] As if you don't have pinball machines in your house already.

[13:12] Like, why would you do that?

[13:14] Have you ever had a pre-order a stern?

[13:16] This is why stern pinball clobbers everybody again because you never have to pre-order a

[13:21] stern machine.

[13:22] There's no anxiety.

[13:23] There's no question mark.

[13:25] Now, look, when you do order a machine from stern, I mean, it's not a pre-order.

[13:28] The games are being made, right?

[13:30] When I mean pre-order, I mean you've spent money on a game before the game has ever been

[13:34] made, before anyone has ever assembled one on a line.

[13:38] And I really hope as we go into 2022 that these days are coming to an end.

[13:43] Unfortunately, I think this community learns no lessons.

[13:47] I don't.

[13:48] I don't think you hold people accountable.

[13:49] I think everyone puts their tail between their legs and says, canada's a really bad guy.

[13:54] Someone said I was tortuously interfering with Haggis Pimball's business.

[13:58] Tortuously interfering.

[14:00] They took non-refundable deposits.

[14:03] I can't interfere with anything.

[14:05] They've got the money.

[14:06] I just hope you guys get the games.

[14:08] You got your Christmas cards.

[14:10] Now let's get the games out the door, okay?

[14:12] All right, that's really it on this really short Saturday morning episode of Canada's

[14:16] Pimball Podcast.

[14:17] I'm your host, Canada.

[14:19] What else is going on?

[14:20] I mean, we got venom around the corner.

[14:22] Bombayette did an interview on TPN on Bill Webb's show.

[14:26] So go check that out.

[14:27] I haven't listened to it yet.

[14:28] I can't get Zombieette on this show.

[14:30] Nobody from Stern can do Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[14:33] Ah, it's just so hard for me to land those interviews with those icons of the industry.

[14:38] Someone asked me, what did I sell my Godzilla Ellie for?

[14:42] If you go on the pin-side marketplace and you look at Godzilla Ellie's, look at what

[14:46] they're selling for.

[14:47] I sold for around the top end of the asking prices that are up there.

[14:52] I'll just give you that hint.

[14:53] Now also look at how many are for sale, right?

[14:55] And the reason why I sold Godzilla when I did is I think we're going to have so many

[15:00] Godzilla Ellie's always up for sale because there's a thousand of them, right?

[15:04] Even if there's always just like 10 Godzilla Ellie's always available for sale, that's nothing.

[15:09] That's only 1% of games available for sale.

[15:13] And because there are a thousand, and there's going to be a thousand rush Ellie's, I really

[15:17] do think when this market sort of softens up a bit and when supply chains loosen up and

[15:23] production ramps up across the board, I do think these games are never going to be hard

[15:27] to get.

[15:28] It doesn't mean it's not a great game, they're just never going to be hard to get.

[15:32] And people will love their Godzilla's and then people might want to buy something else.

[15:36] Like if back to the future came out from Keith Ellwyn, show of hands who wouldn't rather

[15:40] have Keith Ellwyn's back to the future.

[15:43] So Keith Ellwyn isn't done, he's going to keep making games, Stern's going to keep giving

[15:48] him more money to put in his games.

[15:51] And so if Godzilla is not a dream theme for you, I think there's a very good chance.

[15:57] I think there's a very good chance Keith Ellwyn will make a theme you want more than Godzilla

[16:02] down the road.

[16:03] And here's the exciting part.

[16:05] Keith Ellwyn makes a new game every year.

[16:09] Every year.

[16:10] Can you imagine if Pat Lawler made a game every year with Jersey Jack Pimball, we'd have

[16:16] seven Pat Lawler games by now, not just two.

[16:20] We'd have seven Eric Minier games right now, not just two.

[16:24] See this is why other companies you wait forever, you wait forever, but with Stern, you don't

[16:30] have to wait forever.

[16:31] Every year now you're going to get a new Keith Ellwyn game, like that's a moment.

[16:35] I think Jack Danger might be doing food fighters.

[16:37] I really do.

[16:38] I just have this sense that like you're going to give food fighters the Jack Danger.

[16:41] Am I going to be right on that?

[16:42] But everybody, this has been episode 633 of Canatus Pimball Podcast.

[16:47] It's always fun to give you guys like what's coming down the road.

[16:50] I think the more information you have, the better decisions you can make.

[16:54] You see, I just save people so much money, so much money from overpaying for Elvira

[16:59] Toppers or Jurassic Park Toppers or Ecto 1 Toppers.

[17:04] And I'm always going to do this for you.

[17:05] I'm always going to do this for you because I don't think anyone should be paying like

[17:10] $5,000 or $3,500 for an Ecto 1 Topper.

[17:15] Look at the thing.

[17:16] It's cheap.

[17:17] We made fun of that Topper when it came out.

[17:19] Do you remember when that Topper launched?

[17:21] It's cheap.

[17:22] It looks like it was made in China for like 30 bucks.

[17:24] And here we are.

[17:25] $3,500.

[17:26] No way, everybody.

[17:28] Have a great weekend.

[17:30] We'll talk to you soon.
