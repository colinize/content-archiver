[00:00] I

[00:23] Remember this is coming from a list of all titled podcast tips not rooms tips

[00:30] Different between a room on a tip. I'm not telling you this is how you do things. I am nearly suggesting this is how you might want to try

[00:48] You know he's he's very you know he's a very entertaining guy

[00:52] I

[00:55] Man catch as much as possible in a two-week

[01:09] I did a podcast for four years at nothing to do with pinball nothing to do a pinball nothing to do a pinball nothing to do a pinball

[01:16] And

[01:25] So the winner is the winner for the 2017 Twippy is award for best pinball podcast is

[01:41] The most controversial

[01:47] Oh

[01:58] Did you think can a just pinball podcast was just gonna go away?

[02:02] It's not like you have other pinball podcasts out there to listen to there's only like 30 other ones

[02:09] Filling the airwaves, but no we're back and we're gonna do what we always do on the show

[02:13] We're gonna give our commentary on the pinball hobby. We're gonna have some interviews every once in a while

[02:18] But I would love I would love on this episode of Knatus pinball podcast to just jump right back into it

[02:24] I want to give you guys my thoughts on what I've been seeing going on in the pinball hobby

[02:28] You know, I have to be honest

[02:30] I took like four weeks and just didn't even pay attention to pinball

[02:34] I'm gonna talk a little bit later on in this podcast about what it was like going on a pinball

[02:40] Hiatus, but before then before we talk about that

[02:44] Let's go down what I've been noticing in the pinball hobby over the last let's say four to five weeks

[02:51] And what I'm gonna do to make it easy

[02:53] We're gonna go down the list of manufacturers in alphabetical order and I'm gonna give you my point of view on what has

[03:01] Transpired since this show went off the air all right. How's that sound you guys with me on this?

[03:07] All right, let's do it. We always just get right into it. So

[03:10] American pinball let's start with our friends at American pinball

[03:14] So here's the deal with American pinball. Here's what I can tell is happening over there

[03:18] Who Dini is being manufactured? I am not sure how well it is selling you know

[03:25] It's always hard because we don't get numbers from these pinball manufacturers to know whether or not their title is successful or not

[03:32] I would assume that it's doing okay

[03:35] I bet it's not selling one to two thousand units easily

[03:41] But here's I don't want to talk about who Dini because it's out

[03:43] We've given our opinions about who Dini I still think it's quite a challenging game to get into

[03:50] I would not have designed the game to be as difficult as it is

[03:54] But that's not what I want to talk about what I want to talk about is I really do think that these guys are getting ready to

[04:02] Release October fest as game number two now. Maybe they're just fucking with me

[04:07] Maybe they're just fucking with you, but I cannot for the life of me

[04:13] Imagine a world in which October fest pinball out of all the themes that you could pick from out of all the

[04:21] Themes that you don't have to pay money to make a game based on

[04:26] They're gonna do October fest and the reason why I think that is going to happen is I've been noticing sort of Josh

[04:32] Kugler sort of defending October fest as as a as a

[04:37] worthwhile title and theme to pursue now look

[04:41] I'm just gonna go on the record and say the following if

[04:45] American pinball makes October fest it will not sell very well this is not

[04:54] What pinball needs right now and I'm and again like there are those out there who might say

[05:00] Chris what are you talking about like if the game is good?

[05:02] It doesn't matter what the theme is I tend to disagree with that. I just don't think the sophomore title

[05:11] From a company like American pinball is super super super important because you need to remember one thing

[05:18] American pinball is not like spooky pinball

[05:20] They are not trying to be a boutique company where all they have to do is sell

[05:27] 150 or 300 of a game to be successful on that game's run

[05:32] This is a much bigger operation. There are many more people working at American pinball

[05:37] There are goals and ambitions for these titles are not to sell a few hundred

[05:43] They are to sell a few thousand and

[05:46] October fest is just not gonna get it done

[05:48] I mean I thought it was like a joke at first, but now I think they're serious

[05:52] So I just think they should if I were them

[05:55] I would actually open it up to the community about the possible titles that you're thinking about making for game number two and

[06:03] Use the community to do a little market research on whether or not it should be

[06:09] October fest or maybe it could be something else maybe it could be you know something based on I don't know

[06:15] Like Vikings or something based on

[06:18] Ninjas and Samurai's or whatever whatever you know what I'm saying you could just make a game based on so many different things

[06:24] And I'm not sure October fest is where I would

[06:27] Invest my time money and resources to make a game like that and this is just me

[06:32] This is just canada saying you make an October fest game and I'm not buying it

[06:37] And I don't think most people are gonna be that interested in the game either all right

[06:43] All right, let's see Chicago gaming company

[06:46] All right, the the delay of their

[06:48] Third title continues to be what everyone is speculating about and we also got the news again

[06:54] Sorry guys that some of this is like old news, but it's new for me because I'm back in the saddle

[06:59] Doug moved over from

[07:01] Chicago gaming to Stern and so there's been a lot of speculation about what that means about whether or not

[07:07] Chicago gaming company still has the licenses to do everything they wanted to do

[07:13] Look, I think this delay is is pretty interesting because it they were supposed to reveal this game back in February

[07:22] At Texas pinball festival and since then it's been nothing but crickets

[07:27] I mean there hasn't even been anything other than that one

[07:31] Pinball show where they said monster bash remake was gonna be a prize that they gave away then they quickly yank that post down

[07:38] If it is monster bash all right if what we get is monster bash and there has been this much delay

[07:45] On getting monster bash out. I think people might be a little disappointed

[07:49] I think the the delay hasn't led some people to think maybe it's gonna be cactus canyon

[07:55] Or a game like big bang bar a game that could really use

[07:59] updated code and software

[08:01] improvements

[08:02] So is that why the delay is happening? I don't know, but what I do know is this

[08:08] Every month they delay I think makes it harder and harder for these guys to sell these games

[08:13] And it's simply because the market is getting so very crowded

[08:18] And I'm not quite sure what the future holds for Chicago gaming company especially since they lost their new business development guy

[08:25] Which is not a good guy to lose the stern all right? It's not a good guy to lose the stern

[08:30] So I hope we see the game soon. I heard it's gonna be in the next few weeks

[08:35] But again, I heard that a few weeks ago. So what is going on there is anybody's guess all right

[08:42] Let's see circus Maximus is next on my list and I might be missing some people here

[08:47] But I think I got everybody so circus Maximus you know these guys are remaking kingpin and I was just on pincide today

[08:54] And I saw the thread and I was reading through it and I really read through this thread and I'm and it kind of just still feels like it's a couple guys

[09:03] In a garage trying to remake the game

[09:06] They were supposed to remake python angelo's

[09:10] You know pinball circus game they never accomplished that and now they're remaking kingpin

[09:16] I know we saw the prototype

[09:18] But what I think these guys are doing is I think they want to get a final prototype

[09:23] Complete it and then I think they're gonna shop around

[09:27] For someone to manufacture the game and we all know that if kingpin gets remade

[09:33] People are gonna want it. It is I actually think it out of all the old games that never saw the light a day

[09:38] I actually think kingpin is a very interesting title

[09:42] It's nice to look at from a design and layout standpoint if I were them though

[09:47] I would have redone the art package

[09:49] I think the art on the game on the on the cabinet especially just looks like shit

[09:54] I'm by the way. I'm not gonna start cursing a lot more. I think I've been cursing too much on this episode to begin with

[09:59] I think the art package leaves a lot to be desired

[10:02] I would have hired a new artist to sort of make it sort of like kingpin 2.0

[10:08] You know sort of like why go through the trouble of updating the LCD right and the graphics in the game

[10:15] Why not also upgrade the artwork which looks really

[10:19] Mundane and amateurish on the actual game itself if you own an original kingpin

[10:25] It would have been a nice way too if they had done that to actually keep the original

[10:30] beta units of kingpin to keep them still sort of unique and special sort of like throw a bone to those dudes who

[10:38] Own these games that it cost anywhere from 30 to 50,000 dollars and then make the new version

[10:44] I also think they're making they don't really have a plan like I read I met these guys at tpf. I played the game

[10:50] It it seems like they revealed this at a weird time and and and again the reason I say that is in the pinball world

[10:58] And you guys see this there's only so long you can keep a hype window

[11:03] Open before people start to get really tired and fatigued and they feel like they've seen this game for a long time

[11:10] And it's still not available

[11:12] A game like kingpin I actually could honestly see this game not even being manufactured at in time

[11:19] In 2019 I just I there's no nothing to indicate that they have a path to manufacturing

[11:26] All right, and so who knows who knows so that's the latest with circus Maximus all right

[11:32] All right, let's move on to a company that's really been making interesting waves

[11:38] lately and I think this is a company that all of us

[11:42] Initially just wanted to write off and just say they're crazy

[11:47] They're they must be insane to do what they're doing like how could they

[11:52] Reattach themselves to probably the most um

[11:55] Cantankerous person in the entire industry

[11:59] It's no other than

[12:01] Deeproot pinball now look I was probably one of the first people out there to just call these guys nuts

[12:08] That you know if you're gonna start a pinball company probably the last thing you should do is sign up with John popadook

[12:14] and and and announce your company that way and deep roots website was all about legal speak

[12:21] But a lot more has been happening behind the scenes at deep root and I don't think we can write these guys off anymore

[12:30] I don't think you can um just call them

[12:34] Bullshitters. I don't think they're bluffing per se I still think they have major hurdles

[12:40] To go from where they're at

[12:43] To actually manufacturing games because when I hear stuff like the following that they're increasing their

[12:50] Warehouse or their factory sorry not a warehouse of factory and they are gonna make it so they can

[12:56] Manufacture all the parts required to make pinball machines for the masses and I think the skill set required

[13:05] To manufacture pinball machines at a high volume right that skill set

[13:11] I don't think anyone really understands what that takes other than the individuals over at stern pinball now deep root

[13:21] hired

[13:23] hired senior level people away from stern who were involved in the manufacturing

[13:29] It would make me feel better

[13:31] Imagine if they like hired George Gomez just crazy right now that's not gonna happen

[13:35] But you know what i'm saying stern has 30 years of institutional knowledge about how to mass produce a pinball machine

[13:44] And I think deep root is coming at this with a new approach and they want to innovate the way pinball machines are made

[13:50] And I think they almost have this attitude like the way stern makes games

[13:55] Isn't the way

[13:57] Games should be made and we can make them better right we heard all about the quad manufacturing all that no one even knows what that means

[14:03] I think it means like four dudes are on the machine at once versus the assembly line where it's one at a time

[14:08] But it's really hard to say that stern is doing it wrong when every day stern is sending out

[14:15] You know 50 machines 75 machines. They're shipping thousands of machines a year

[14:22] And you have a different way of doing it that you know will work better

[14:26] So I just have a hard time believing that

[14:28] And I also get nervous because I think

[14:31] Getting a game to prototype stage is one thing

[14:35] But then actually mass manufacturing that game

[14:38] Is another thing and and there's a lot that goes into that that they will never

[14:44] They will never know their hurdles until they get there and that and that's the other thing is like a lot of times we we quickly

[14:51] Slammed stern for their quality and for the way they manufacture and all this stuff

[14:56] But when you're shipping so many games and you have so many orders coming in it's a nightmare right like if spooky pinball got a thousand orders tomorrow for

[15:04] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and those orders had to be fulfilled within a year

[15:09] The company would collapse they they couldn't do that volume

[15:13] So that that's interesting that that deep route is sort of

[15:17] Scaling up and saying they're going to do all the manufacturing in house all right

[15:21] Now the whole jpop thing is not going away. I mean we know that they're going to

[15:26] Release jpop's games. I actually reached out to Robert like a few months ago asked about magic girl because I'm just really curious about magic girl

[15:33] On on a personal level. I'm really curious to see how they

[15:38] Uh change that game to make it work like I

[15:42] Having stood over magic girl for too many hours trying to figure out what was in John's head

[15:47] I'm so curious as to how they make it work. I'm also really curious how much John is involved in the actual

[15:55] redesigning of his own games

[15:57] I bet robber is probably handing these off to new people to just make them work and here's why because I think the only reason

[16:06] The only reason John

[16:08] Was signed on by deep route not the only but probably night if I'm Robert 90% of why I hired John

[16:17] Is to get access to all the incredible artwork that zombie Eddie did because I still think that Alice in Wonderland is the most beautiful

[16:26] Pimball machine that we have never been allowed to buy now speaking of Alice in Wonderland

[16:33] Robert has indicated that Alice in Wonderland will be a

[16:38] $50,000 option if you want something that's super high-end and exclusive and rare right now

[16:47] Here's what he also said he said it's not going to be the only version of the game they offer

[16:52] Now I think robber I think he I don't know if he did this because I said you could sell a $50,000 machine

[16:58] But I think he misunderstood what I was saying when I said that

[17:03] Let me let me back up and say this do I think you could sell a $50,000

[17:09] John Papa Duke Alice in Wonderland Pimball machine and the answer is the answer is are you sitting down the answer is yes

[17:17] You could

[17:18] You could sell to this community which has many many many multi-millionaires in it

[17:24] You could sell a $50,000 Alice in Wonderland Pimball machine

[17:28] But you could only sell that

[17:31] If you only made at that price if you only made like 10 and you said

[17:39] There's only going to be 10 of these ever and I mean 10 like Alice in Wonderland games

[17:44] With zombie Yeti and John Papa Duke design and that's it

[17:48] Like you never make another Alice in Wonderland game and and you that's it

[17:54] There will never be more you can't sell a $50,000 version

[18:00] Of a game when other people will also be able to get the game

[18:05] It's just it's just that simple

[18:07] You know if Stern had said we are only going to make let's say Stern said we're only going to make 20 Batman Pimball machine

[18:14] Only 20 Batman 66 Pimball machines right no pro no premium no le no super le there's just 20

[18:22] In the whole world

[18:23] What do you think they could sell that game for I mean they sold 80 think about how how silly this is

[18:29] How silly I am for buying one even though I think it's a great game

[18:32] They sold 80 machines at

[18:35] $15,000 when the same exact game experience can be had for $8,000

[18:41] Okay, and that's unlimited like we'll make as many we can make 10,000 Batman premiums and 10,000 people are having the same exact experience

[18:51] As people who paid $15,000 see the the magic and magic girl

[18:56] And this is the only reason why John pop it you got people to pay $16,000 for magic girl

[19:02] And I've said this before

[19:04] The only place on planet earth where you could experience a magic girl is if you were standing in front of one of

[19:13] 16 machines

[19:14] All right, there's only 16 physical spaces on the planet

[19:18] Where you could get the magic girl experience and that's what people are willing to pay 16,000 dollars for

[19:24] So if you're gonna tell me there's a $50,000 Pimball experience

[19:28] There better only be like five to ten places on the planet where I can actually have that experience

[19:33] So we'll see what happens. I think it's a little bit of like bullshit

[19:37] But we'll see if that actually comes to fruition all right the other thing that Robert said he did an interview

[19:42] I think it was with with this week in Pimball

[19:44] He said something interesting and I think I think Robert sort of going back and forth

[19:48] He's sort of he's doing a little bit of a PR spin with this company where he says something really bold

[19:54] The community reacts to it negatively. He sort of backtracks

[19:58] Then he tries to do like a PR move that seems like it's doing good for the community to sort of

[20:04] gain goodwill right? So I saw that he said something about helping out

[20:09] the victims of Dutch Pimball and Highway Pimball

[20:12] All right, and and this to me was a real head scratcher because I saw that and at first you're like

[20:19] Man, that's one swell move to do that you know these victims of both those machines

[20:25] There are many many people out there who have lost a lot of money

[20:29] Investing in both of those companies and it's put a you know a sour taste in their mouth about the hobby

[20:35] And so here comes Robert who has no obligation to help in these individuals out

[20:40] And he basically says I'm going to do something for you

[20:43] But he also in the same interview was interesting. He also

[20:48] Kind of shit on those people's hopes of ever getting their machines again

[20:52] Because he said that he approached both

[20:55] Dutch Pimball and Highway Pimball

[20:58] About helping them

[21:00] Get their games out

[21:02] But in order to help them get their games out those companies needed to relinquish some of the ownership of the games

[21:09] To make the customers whole and they refuse to do it now

[21:13] Do I think Robert is is BSing when he says that I don't think so

[21:17] I mean bury in the op strike me as the kind of guys

[21:20] Who would rather who would rather

[21:23] maintain control over this whole thing

[21:27] And and make bad decision after bad decision and they don't care if you get your games

[21:32] We're gonna talk about them a little bit more when I go into Dutch which I think is next so um

[21:36] But what I want to say about this I think Robert's offer to these victims is sort of silly and here's why I think it's silly

[21:43] A he has absolutely no obligation

[21:45] B it just seems like we get that Robert is successful and has a lot of money

[21:49] but I also think when you start to

[21:52] Make statements like that

[21:54] You sound like you're gonna use your money in in kind of a foolish way

[21:58] And I also the the the biggest thing the biggest reason I thought it was is ridiculous

[22:03] Is he doesn't even have a plan

[22:05] He even says it he's like well, I don't really know what I'm gonna do

[22:08] Uh, maybe I'm you know, I'm gonna

[22:10] Ge it can be anything he can give them uh, you know a deeper t-shirt

[22:14] He's like maybe I'll fly them in to shows like

[22:17] You know, is it gonna be credit towards a game?

[22:19] And so here's my thing

[22:21] Don't ever say you're gonna do something for a victim without thinking through

[22:27] What that thing is you're going to do because then you're just basically saying like

[22:33] Hey, like I'm gonna do something really good. I just don't know what it is

[22:36] And I just don't think you should say that publicly

[22:40] Because I think then you're looking for credit before credit is deserved

[22:45] And I really think that Robert and deep root and the folks over there

[22:50] Should just focus on their games and they don't need to make their company the

[22:54] Saviors of all things that have gone wrong and pinball and I think that's the other thing he's trying to do is like

[23:00] Like make position the company as being like we're more than just a game manufacturer

[23:06] We are here to like be the saviors of all things that have gone wrong and pinball

[23:12] We're not just gonna revolutionize and transform the game like how the games are made

[23:17] We're also gonna heal the wounds of the victims, you know sort of like like almost like a messiah figure within the hobby

[23:24] And I just don't think

[23:26] They should make all of these bold claims. I don't think they've proven anything, you know like it's

[23:33] It's kind of ridiculous the amount of talk, you know talk talk talk talk talk we haven't seen anything yet

[23:40] Now again that being said like I really look forward to seeing what they do

[23:43] But I would just dial down the rhetoric on on how great and how like all

[23:49] Trawistic this company is when they haven't shipped a single game, right now Robert also

[23:55] Is been teasing this thing that they have you know they have license and unlicensed games

[24:01] Which is again a lot of talk and we know what some of those unlicensed games are we don't know what the license games are

[24:09] Um, and I also know that Robert through his investigating of which license he can get

[24:15] He's also at a competitive advantage because a lot of times these studios they'll let you know

[24:22] If if a license has already been claimed to buy another pinball manufacturer

[24:26] So he probably knows who's making what and probably like when they have a license for or how long they do so that that does put deep

[24:34] Root at a competitive advantage

[24:37] You know, so we'll see we'll see what that means

[24:40] He keeps saying there's going to be at least three games

[24:44] Completed by Texas pinball festival, but he also says maybe sooner all right

[24:49] So we'll see what that means like does a completed game mean a prototype they're willing to show

[24:55] Or am I going to be able to buy a deep-root game sometime before 2018 is up

[25:01] I would doubt that I would doubt that all right

[25:04] I did find it really funny and this is sort of like when I saw this

[25:09] The end of all the things I've seen that whether or not I have faith in this company whether or not

[25:14] I think they're going to design a good pinball machine

[25:17] What I did love was they had a ghost busters foam core of the play field hanging on the wall as a

[25:26] symbol of what not to do when designing a pinball machine and I thought that was hilarious because

[25:33] Ghostbusters is probably the worst design game in a very very long time

[25:39] But here's the ultimate kicker

[25:41] When you look at which game earn the most money on location last year, you know, a game it was ghostbusters once again proving

[25:50] That above all

[25:52] Theme is all that really matters when you want to make money on location all right

[25:56] So that's deep root a lot of question marks a lot of bold statements continuing

[26:01] I hope to get Robert on the show sometime in July

[26:04] I would love to talk to him about what what's going on over there and I can't you know

[26:09] I look look I think of all the companies

[26:11] The one that probably has most of our curiosity peaked is deep root. I think it's hard to deny that

[26:18] Are you really curious to see what's next from stern? I mean chances are

[26:23] It's gonna be just another stern game right let's go on so dutch pinball now look dutch pinball is dead

[26:31] It you could check for a pulse you could try to resuscitate them

[26:37] This company is dead. I want to congratulate Kim Mitchell on selling his big Lebowski pinball machine for $20,000

[26:47] I saw that someone

[26:49] Wrote that you know some idiot bought his magic roll for $23,000 when they could have bought his big Lebowski for

[26:56] For 20k and that idiot was me right? I mean I probably should have bought Kim Mitchell's

[27:02] Big Lebowski because it actually works

[27:04] But to my defense when I bought magic girl nobody knew nobody knew at that time that the game didn't work that that the American pinball magic girl was gonna be such a such a joke but

[27:15] I want to read a couple things because I'm not sure this is even talked about and and someone sent me a letter from

[27:22] ARA

[27:23] That I want to reach for you guys right now because this letter is really the reason why the should hit the fan

[27:31] With a lot of the people who were involved in the um

[27:36] You know in the pre-order

[27:38] Debacle with these guys now hold on. Let me let me open up this thing because I

[27:42] It looks like it just closed out real quick hold on and I don't you know

[27:46] I don't edit my podcast so like when I have to go find something. I feel get it all right

[27:50] So here we go now this letter is from aRA and it is marked February 24th

[27:57] 2017 all right, I want to it's from aRA and it says

[28:03] ARA and Dutch pinball agreed during the start of the serial production on the price of the pinball machines and

[28:12] Dutch pinball has paid this agreed price for the first few delivered pinball machines

[28:19] This price has not been changed by aRA the production stopped was triggered by the fact

[28:27] That Dutch pinball was not willing to pay for the already by

[28:32] The sorry pay for the already by container shipped pinball machines

[28:36] All right, they have some grammar mistakes there basically saying Dutch didn't pay for the container that already shipped

[28:41] ARA has approximately

[28:44] 40 pinball machines ready to be shipped as soon as we get paid for all delivered pinball machines

[28:51] And we have guarantees for the future payments the shipments and production will be

[28:56] continued

[28:58] Best regards

[29:00] You know some some guys name at aRA all right now. I just want to stop there for a minute and I want to talk about that letter

[29:07] That came out a year ago a year and a half ago

[29:10] And I want to just say when are we as a community?

[29:15] When are we as a hobby group?

[29:18] When are we going to finally just

[29:21] admit and say you know what

[29:24] We gave our money and we believed in two guys who have misled us and they've lied to us and

[29:32] They were called out on a lie when they told everybody that it was a board production delay that was causing

[29:40] Other games to not ship

[29:42] Now look this is just a letter by aRA. It doesn't prove that they are telling the truth and that Dutch is lying

[29:51] but

[29:52] Dutch got caught in a lie and who do you believe?

[29:56] Who do you believe?

[29:58] It doesn't really make sense that

[30:00] ARA would do what Dutch is saying they did

[30:05] Here's what I think happened and I think it's pretty easy to understand what happened is that Dutch pinball

[30:12] spent money that was supposed to go to people's games on themselves

[30:19] That they probably spent it on all these shows they probably spent it on marketing and sexy girls and pen houses and flights

[30:26] I want you guys to do me a favor go on expedia

[30:30] And book a bunch of flights from the Netherlands to the United States and see how cheap they are

[30:36] Now do that multiple times and see how many times

[30:40] That money is then responsible for

[30:43] Eating up people's machines and so I think the money just wasn't there

[30:49] And when they had to go write that big check because that's a big check like 40 machines. Let's say 40 machines times

[30:56] You know eight thousand dollars in machine or seven thousand dollars in machine

[31:01] You know what is that 280 thousand dollars they got to cut them a check for to ship those games

[31:07] Do you think what if you know what if the money's gone?

[31:09] Or they didn't have enough

[31:11] You know they couldn't then go raise new revenue and that is why

[31:15] These companies fail it is why Dutch failed it is why highway failed is that the numbers don't add up and what sucks is

[31:24] You get lied to and the problem is within the community is that you believe the lie

[31:29] Because all you want is your game now

[31:31] You don't want to wake up in a world where you're not going to get your big Lebowski pinball machine or your alien pinball machine

[31:36] And so you have to believe the manufacturers and the other part is this

[31:41] You don't want to upset the manufacturer too much because just in case they're right

[31:46] You also in this weird way have this fear that they're not going to then sell you a game because you've pissed them off

[31:52] But what really pisses me off is that all this time has passed and Dutch is clearly like right now

[31:58] They're they're basically a dead company and

[32:01] Whenever Barry and Yacht

[32:04] Communicate to buyers

[32:06] They're communicating to people who'd never got what they paid for they always communicate in this really sarcastic like a reverent tone of voice

[32:16] Like they think it's a joke

[32:17] You know and they use all these like jokes from the big Lebowski movie like you know

[32:21] I saw someone was like like threatening them or saying something how they want their money back or this or that

[32:27] Or they feel like they were cheated and they right back like you're not being a dude dude like

[32:32] Really really like you they really think it's appropriate

[32:35] To talk to people like that and I want to read

[32:38] Their last correspondence to the community and you tell me if this sounds like a company that is taking responsibility for what they've done

[32:48] If they really feel bad and sorry for

[32:52] You know basically taking people's money and delivering them nothing over a period of years

[32:58] And now the outlook looks really bleak that anything will ever happen and this is how they talk right

[33:05] It says how you doing there dude. Oh, not so good man one of those days, huh

[33:11] Well, it was a fellow then myself once said sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar. Well he eats you

[33:19] That's about how we felt a few weeks ago

[33:21] You will understand that this situation is extremely frustrating not only for you

[33:26] But also for our distributors and also for us

[33:29] We are now awaiting the lawsuit with our former contract manufacturer to get you and us compensated

[33:37] And then there's another like

[33:38] Quote that says so yeah, man

[33:41] We could be sitting here with just p-stains on our rug

[33:44] And then it says Seattle 7

[33:47] But like the dude and his friends we won't give up and we are not alone

[33:51] There's a group of pinheads who call themselves the Seattle 7 they contacted us because they want to start a go-fun me campaign to help us

[33:59] With funds for our attorneys and to start the production with our new contract manufacturer Zitec

[34:06] We are very very grateful for this initiative as soon as there is more info about this campaign

[34:10] We will inform you as well in the meantime

[34:13] We are working on a solution with Zitec than how to set up production pending the lawsuit

[34:19] And then they go on the right about specials on their page like they're selling stuff from this game like translates and aprons and all this up

[34:27] They're even selling a

[34:29] Pre-production or yeah pre-production game of the big Lebowski in a blind auction format. I'm gonna talk about that in a second

[34:37] But I just want to say this

[34:40] The fact that these guys have the audacity

[34:44] To even allow people to set up a go-fun me page to help them pay for their attorneys first of all

[34:50] Let me say this right now if any of you out there who listen to this show

[34:55] If you're thinking of donating money to paying Barry and Yop's legal fees

[35:01] You are a freaking moron right a moron

[35:06] If you want to take more of your money and throw it into this dumpster fire of a project

[35:12] You have nobody to blame but yourself and I think I can't tell if they're telling the truth or not

[35:19] But I think anyone

[35:21] Anyone who wants to give these guys more money to bail them out of a situation that they put themselves in

[35:30] That person is even dumber than the these guys who run these pinball companies into the ground all right

[35:38] Wise up. Why is up all right? How many strikes before these guys are out how many all right?

[35:46] Okay

[35:47] Now let's talk about this silent auction because someone email me they say hey Chris like do you think this is a good deal

[35:53] It's already at like 13,000 euros. I think it's now at 15,000 years

[35:57] The reality is this

[35:59] Would you ever buy a pre-production version of the big Lebowski pinball machine?

[36:06] All right, so first of all

[36:08] This game and we're going to talk about games for sale like magic girl and big Lebowski

[36:12] this game

[36:14] Has nothing but bad mojo surrounding it all right more people didn't get their games than got it

[36:20] There is nobody that is going to help you with customer support if anything breaks and this game breaks

[36:26] And it breaks a lot and if you play it a lot you better just play with one hand while the other hands got its fingers crossed because it's gonna break

[36:35] It there and when it does you're fucked and so

[36:39] All it takes on these machines is for one thing to go down and the enjoyment of owning it and playing it will

[36:48] Evaporate and the only reason you would own a big Lebowski is

[36:54] So when people come over you can impress them that you have a big Lebowski

[36:58] I mean that's it with these rare games from these failed companies. That is the only reason to own it

[37:03] You yeah, you you could say because you enjoy it, but let me tell you. It's not enjoyable playing a game

[37:08] That has no customer service waiting if something goes wrong because it's pinball and things go wrong

[37:14] But here's the other part. It's a blind auction

[37:17] Do you believe these guys when they say oh the bids up to like 15,000 euro 18,000 euro

[37:22] Where where is this auction being

[37:25] Regulated who's monitoring it? Are we just taking their word that that that they have someone bidding that much and

[37:34] You know

[37:35] They're probably she'll bidding the thing up themselves

[37:38] And I just wouldn't buy anything that has anything to do with this game if I were you again

[37:43] Everyone I know this kills me too because I still consider the big Lebowski to be

[37:48] one of the most

[37:49] Exciting games that when when we first saw it

[37:52] I still think it has one of the greatest worlds in her glass that of any machine ever

[37:56] The bowling alley mechanism was amazing. I would have loved for this company to have succeeded

[38:01] I would have loved to have seen them do like a back to the future

[38:04] I think out of all the companies that came out they actually made the best

[38:10] Game to compete with like the kinds of machines that stern makes all right. It was standard body

[38:16] It had a license theme that was perfect for the pinball demographic

[38:19] It had so many toys and bells and whistles in it and it was really something special and I can tell why you guys fell in love with it

[38:27] But ever since that love affair began

[38:30] It's been nothing but a nightmare following the production of this game

[38:35] And so I think everyone just needs to

[38:37] Understand that this thing is over all right. It's over and if you want to keep

[38:44] Supporting it and you want to hope that you get your game

[38:48] I can't remove hope from you. You can you can hope

[38:52] All you want I just don't see them coming out of this lawsuit with anything other than an announcement

[39:00] That unfortunately our dream of making a pinball machine is over and and it sucks

[39:07] But the hobby will be better off without dutch and highway pinball which is my next company

[39:16] So highway pinball's dead. I mean we when we left

[39:19] We sort of covered the the funeral and the the aftermath of highway pinball. It is still dead

[39:27] Nothing ever will come out from highway pinball again

[39:30] But there has been some news. It's been interesting that we have to talk about so first and foremost

[39:35] Oric Lawson finally got his game and he got his game

[39:39] And he did this is a tale of the smart man and the dumb man

[39:44] And the smart man is oric Lawson

[39:47] He gets his game and he does what any smart man would do

[39:52] With the machine that is just another ticking time bomb a machine that you just never will enjoy owning because of all the

[39:59] Negativity surrounding it he sells it

[40:02] And he doesn't just sell it for anything he sells it for

[40:06] $13,000 or maybe more and he gets rid of it immediately and I actually

[40:12] I actually applaud oric Lawson and I really enjoyed reading his very honest and very candid

[40:20] Feedback on why he could not enjoy this machine. I mean think about it

[40:25] You've got Dave Sanders who designed the game who is telling everybody

[40:30] There were compromises made in designing this game that they're not happy with that. They're just not happy with the final product

[40:37] You have the artist who did the art for the game who's not happy at all with how things went down

[40:44] He's not happy with how Andrew

[40:46] Communicated with the license hurry's not happy about the final product that

[40:51] You know that that ultimately ended up becoming the game because of all the the miscommunication that was happening and that if only they were able to

[40:59] Communicate directly with Fox it probably would have been a much different kind of game

[41:04] But it's also just like the two years of shit or three years of shit that he had to put up with

[41:08] He would never be able to enjoy it

[41:11] I mean it sucks the people closest to that game want nothing to do with it

[41:16] So he sells it now that's the tale of the smart man

[41:19] The tale the dumb man because I read this too

[41:22] Goes to

[41:24] The people that are buying these games and I saw that ice man

[41:29] Out of all people ice you think he would have learned a lesson by now

[41:34] That there that that like you have all the information you need in this world to know that owning an alien pinball machine

[41:43] Is nothing but a frustrating

[41:46] shitty experience and what is ice do he goes and buys an alien pinball machine and you know why?

[41:53] Because ice he suffers from the same sort of problem that all collector suffer from

[41:58] They really want they had that fear of like missing out

[42:02] I want to have the thing that people talk about like I love the theme. I need to have it

[42:06] You've got to separate

[42:08] Some of that from the reality of the situation and and and and and and I know that he was trying to buy like

[42:14] I think it was like Brian Kelly's machine or John Kelly's some some Kelly's machine for and he didn't want to pay

[42:20] So he ends up buying one in Australia of all places probably from Wayne

[42:26] And now he's got to ship it all the way from Australia to Texas hoping that it arrives in one piece

[42:32] Hoping nothing's wrong with it and you know look ice I think it's a silly move. I would not want to own

[42:41] Either the big Lebowski or alien pinball machine because as a magic girl owner

[42:46] I'll tell you

[42:48] When you own a game that has nothing but negativity around it that has no support

[42:53] All you're gonna do is be frustrated with the ownership of it and you're gonna pass it on to someone else

[42:59] I am the luckiest man in the world that I sold my magic girl for $20,000 all right the luckiest

[43:05] I mean I was almost gonna be into two magic girls for the tune of $50,000 and that was like the dumbest

[43:13] Basically the dumbest decisions I was ever making in my life was right there

[43:18] And I think what's gonna happen to all these alien owners and I see the threat of these guys who are like

[43:24] Trying to get these alien machines working right

[43:27] It's such a lost cause the game was designed wrong the game was designed incorrectly

[43:34] They didn't have the money and the resources and the time they needed to make this game

[43:42] Work properly and I love it too guys will open up an alien machine. They're like oh my game works

[43:48] My games working great everything's working fine except for the xenomorph head doesn't work at all

[43:52] It's like there's always that but but this doesn't work, but that doesn't work

[43:55] But this is out. This is out

[43:57] You know how dumb it is to own an alien machine where the main toy the xenomorph head like won't work or is a ticking time bomb

[44:06] The thing is a joke. It's a joke

[44:10] Here's what I think needs to happen

[44:13] I think that someone needs to go get the alien license and make an amazing fucking alien machine

[44:19] I think they need to do the Geiger art package on it

[44:22] They need to like actually go on deviant art and look at all the amazing artists that are making alien artwork

[44:29] And I think they need to go to Fox and say look

[44:33] Look this guy fucked the whole thing up. Let's reconcile

[44:37] What happened with that machine and make the alien pinball machine that the world deserves all right

[44:44] I think someone needs to go do that Robert Mueller. I'm talking to you brother

[44:48] All right, but it's dead and anyone who buys an alien machine you know what you're getting yourself into

[44:53] I just I wouldn't pay

[44:55] $5,000 for an alien. I just think it's again when when a machine goes down

[45:00] It's a paperweight and I think that's gonna happen to all those alien machines out there

[45:04] And I wouldn't want to own one no matter no matter even like no matter what the cost because I just think it's stupid

[45:11] All right

[45:12] All right home pin we're gonna we're gonna keep this under an hour

[45:14] Don't worry. We're only at 45 minutes and we're back. We're going through the news

[45:18] So home pin it hasn't shipped yet. It's been five years since they announced this game the he's got some like

[45:26] pre-production models

[45:28] On route. I don't really have much to say about

[45:32] Thunderbirds uh the theme still does nothing for me

[45:35] I think Mike's calm down a little bit. I haven't seen him go off as much recently

[45:40] I do think he's finally realized that you have to sell pinball machines to Americans

[45:44] All right, and to do that you can't be like an anti-American racist bastard

[45:48] So hopefully he's learned that lesson and he's you know, he's dialed it down

[45:53] The response from people playing the game seems to be lukewarm

[45:57] There's just nothing in this game that seems like terribly interesting or that special

[46:02] Uh, but it's also a cheap game. It's five grand right now five grand feels like

[46:07] Abargan it feels like

[46:09] You know great

[46:10] Until you realize like a stern pro is also five grand and comes with a color LCD and you know yada yada yada

[46:17] And even though he got the price low

[46:21] I still don't see how you buy this over a stern especially with the themes that stern is cranking out

[46:28] But we'll see what happens

[46:30] I am shocked that the game is still not shipping it just these some of these things

[46:33] It just takes forever for them to come out and and that is one of them all right. Let's go on to Jersey jack pinball

[46:39] Uh, you know, I thought by now we would have a little bit more of an update on whether or not

[46:46] Uh

[46:47] Pires the Caribbean would ship. I got to be honest. Uh, I'm just sort of I've lost all

[46:54] Excitement around this title

[46:56] At of all the things coming out in pinball

[47:00] Maybe I just need to play this game. It's it sort of boggles my mind though

[47:05] That by the time pirates of the Caribbean will ship to customers

[47:09] It will have been almost nine or ten months since it was revealed

[47:15] And I'm sorry, but jack said to us. I would not reveal a game

[47:20] Until it was ready to ship

[47:22] Nine to ten months later

[47:25] We still don't have the game out and I don't understand the reason for that

[47:30] I don't even want to speculate

[47:32] but hype in this crowded pinball market is a real thing

[47:37] And I think that hype for this game is gone and I don't know how you get it back

[47:43] I think the game is probably gonna be you know

[47:46] Another

[47:47] Jersey jack game and by that I mean

[47:50] There's gonna be so much about this game. That's great

[47:53] There's gonna be so much about this game that you wish was a little bit different

[47:59] um, but I just

[48:02] Keep feeling like jack needs his ghost buster

[48:07] He needs his game with the right theme at the right time with the right features and

[48:16] He's just everything's always like just a couple things off

[48:21] And it's a shame

[48:23] I would rather see toy story ahead of Willy Wonka

[48:27] I think we're getting Willy Wonka first because he has all the rights to Willy Wonka and we're gonna see

[48:33] um

[48:35] Movie clips from the original film which will be great

[48:38] You know who needs to be on Willy Wonka is Christopher franshee as the artist would be perfect for Willy Wonka

[48:46] Um, we're gonna talk about franshee and stern and what the f is going on over there. All right. Let's go to multi-morphic

[48:50] So

[48:51] P3 multi-morphic

[48:53] Uh, you know, I actually interviewed Jerry a couple days ago. I'm gonna air that for you guys later this week

[48:58] So you'll hear all about that. So I'm not gonna go too much into multi-morphic

[49:02] You know, basically Jerry is

[49:05] Sold out right now if you order one. It's four to five weeks to get it

[49:11] You know the volume's not big. They're building their company very very

[49:15] slowly

[49:17] Very much like spooky

[49:19] They're biting off as much as they can chew and they are getting you know feedback from early adopters

[49:25] And so you know, am I feeling on multi-morphic?

[49:28] Has always been the same that it's it's a huge leap and

[49:32] The theme and the games are ultimately gonna drive people to that platform or or drive them away and

[49:39] You know, it's

[49:41] Everyone who pre-ordered their game got one though, and I think you have to start

[49:45] You know just applauding any company out there who gets customers their games

[49:51] I think this hobby doesn't always need you know just crap on everyone who's trying to make pinball machines

[49:57] If you want to make a pinball machine

[49:59] And you want to sell it to people and you take people's money in fall

[50:04] Then you better get them a game if not you should get the fuck out of this hobby. I mean it's that simple

[50:09] And and Jerry has

[50:12] shipped to all people who pre-ordered and paid in fall a game. So that's good

[50:17] I think people wait to see what happens on that platform. It's been

[50:21] around for a while and

[50:24] You know

[50:25] I look forward to seeing what goes on in I mean I I have fun playing it at shows

[50:30] I think networking and connecting those machines

[50:34] Could be a real differentiator in pinball. I think that's you know, it's crazy that we play a game

[50:39] Like pinball and it's not networked all right

[50:42] All right stern pinball so stern

[50:45] You know look they're the big dogs. I saw that the Deadpool image leaked. I did not leak that image

[50:51] I know there was like speculation the image leaked shortly after I went away

[50:55] I did not send that image out there all right

[50:58] Iron Maiden continues to be selling like a jug or not. I've heard from distributors

[51:03] They can't keep these things in stock

[51:05] I think it's great. I think stern has a hit on their hands. They know it you know it

[51:10] Everyone is enjoying the game. I'm happy Keith Keith game that he made in his own time with his own dime

[51:19] Is turning out to be one of stern's best title. So that is great now will Deadpool be the

[51:27] Moment at which we realize that we're right back to stern games as usual

[51:33] Or will Deadpool be equally as special?

[51:36] It's gonna be funny because Deadpool also features the artwork of zombie Yeti

[51:40] So we have the same art as back to back

[51:43] Um, but will will it have the same sort of

[51:47] uniqueness that we get in iron maiden

[51:50] Uh, I'm not sure if you looked at the leaked image of the Deadpool

[51:54] It does you can't people are saying that's John Trudeau's but you've also got like Gomez is like you know his sword lock

[52:00] Like on Lord the Rings on the right side. So I don't know whose version that is I I how could you tell right if it's Gomez or Trudeau

[52:09] Uh, uh, you know, is there something I see in that game that

[52:12] Makes me go wow not really but again, it's just in very early prototype

[52:17] I still see they're using like the same kind of ramps that are in Batman. So is it gonna be a partspin game

[52:23] Or is it gonna be something in that game that really makes it worth owning

[52:27] They definitely missed the mark on launching this Deadpool game. I mean you got a Deadpool movie out like why isn't the game

[52:35] Out when the movie comes out. I just think it's sort of weird to have a Deadpool game

[52:41] Come out months after the movie comes out and then it's not even based on the movie. It's based on the comics

[52:46] So I don't know if Deadpool is gonna be a huge seller. I don't think so uh, what else so

[52:54] I've noticed like gardens the galaxy and there's been like code updates and this is another game

[53:01] Where I feel like gardens the galaxy is suffering the same thing that happened to Batman and that is basically

[53:08] You get one chance to launch your game and for people to get excited before they move on to the next games coming out and

[53:16] Guardians to me is that where I get that the new code has made the game really enjoyable and people who own the game are enjoying it

[53:24] I still don't care because I you know, it's like I've played so many

[53:30] Games on guardians at bars and whatnot when the code was so

[53:35] Limited that I now have to go back and play it again, and I'm sure it's great. I'm sure it's great

[53:41] And I think people are who own it will enjoy it

[53:44] But I think Stern is ultimately gonna learn the lesson that when you ship these games incomplete

[53:51] You may never get people excited again for that game. It doesn't matter if a year later. It's great

[53:59] You know Batman too like I'm curious how Batman is selling because I do think Batman is now a great game

[54:06] It's crazy to think

[54:08] Batman is still not done and in October it will mark two years

[54:15] Of which that game was

[54:17] Revealed two years

[54:19] Almost two years from the game shipping to people too with like completely just like spardan code

[54:24] You know I own an SLE and I got to say two two years and Stern has still not given the SLE owners their personalized callouts

[54:33] Which Adam West did and you know you pay imagine paying $15,000 for

[54:39] Uh, or like a hundred fifty thousand dollars for a special limited edition car and you had a weight

[54:46] Sort of two years for the headrest that's what it feels like it's just like it's just like why can't they just

[54:52] Code

[54:54] Give 80 people the code they spent $15,000 on it's just

[54:59] It's beyond me, but the game is great. You know, I played the new code update

[55:03] I'm having fun with Batman. I enjoy it. Uh, nothing's has has broken on my machine

[55:09] I've had nothing but a good experience with the game itself

[55:12] I think Batman is one of those games where

[55:15] If it wasn't so damn expensive

[55:17] I think more people would be in it. I think they'd they'd go by one

[55:22] All right, so what else is going on in Stern? So here's the thing and I know I'm leaving this to lay in the podcast, but

[55:28] There's been some controversy and some weird stuff going on with like Stern and Christopher fransche and he puts up a post saying

[55:36] Uh, my pinball careers over like news to come at 11 then I saw that post has been taken down

[55:42] I tried talking to him about it

[55:45] And I'm not sure where things netted out uh, I know this I know this

[55:51] If you are working for a pinball company, and I want to just give this advice to people

[55:57] Because there's there's there's a reality of being a professional and there's a reality of working in an industry

[56:05] And part of that reality is you are going to get information and access to things that only

[56:12] Your eyes should see and I think what happens in this hobby is that a lot of people get excited when they're working on projects

[56:20] And they talk about like stuff they're working on and they you know, they they get excited and it's pinball right it may

[56:26] I mean part of me is like I don't think anything in pinball should be that secretive like the Stern really think they're apple

[56:33] Right like their trade secrets really matter like Stern is not publicly traded

[56:38] They don't have like a stock price. They don't have like they're not going to get really hurt

[56:42] If people know that the monsters is coming out

[56:45] They're not going to get hurt if people know that beetles is coming out because we know those two things are coming out

[56:52] We have confirmation now that Deadpool is coming out. Is any of that information going to hurt their sales

[56:58] You know, and so you know Stern is like this company that has decided to pretty much

[57:03] Try to keep customers in the dark because they do know that that hype window is so important

[57:11] That they are they're the masters at driving hype in the pinball hobby and we see them do it time and time again

[57:18] Right, I mean to the point where like you know someone's buying my iron maiden Ellie off me for $12,000 because of that hype

[57:25] A month later you can't get $12,000 for iron maiden Ellie and you're still available new in box

[57:31] You can still get one for less than that all right

[57:34] now

[57:35] My issue with Stern lately is is is obviously the fact that like Stern's blacklisted this pinball podcast

[57:42] I mean way before any incident happened at any New York like tournament

[57:47] I reached out to Zach Sharp and I was basically told nobody from Stern will ever come on this show in the near future

[57:54] Or like not he didn't say that stridently he was like

[57:57] It's just not the right time maybe in the future

[58:00] And you can imagine you know what I would I feel when I then look at other pinball podcasts out there and Stern is doing interviews with these people

[58:10] So here's what I'm gonna do here's what I'm gonna do because I'm a negotiator. I'm a communicator

[58:16] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna tell Zach and George like we're gonna engage in a little game of give and take

[58:22] All right, and here's what we're gonna do

[58:24] Because I think it's only fair that if they don't want to give anything to me the the number one pinball podcast as according to the twit piece which absolutely means nothing

[58:37] If they don't want to give anything to me or let anyone talk to the show, you know they blacklisted they kept

[58:43] Zombie Yeti from coming on they won't let Keith Owen come on

[58:47] Zach Sharp won't come on they wouldn't let me air the interview with Jared

[58:51] If they want to if they don't want to give me anything

[58:54] Then I'm gonna take something from Stern, okay, and so you might be asking yourself. Well, can you what can you take from Stern

[59:01] Well, it's simple I can take from Stern

[59:05] The element of surprise I can take from Stern

[59:11] They're hype away from them because I can share with you what I know

[59:18] About future titles, okay, I can share with you more than they would like me to know about future titles and I but I'm not see

[59:28] I'm not gonna do it yet because I want to hear from Zach

[59:32] And the people over at Stern that listen to this show if they're willing to give me anything if they want to come on the show and look

[59:39] I've always said I own a Stern machine

[59:42] I've owned two Stern machines, okay, and I bought through a distributor

[59:46] I mean, I'm my money's going into Stern's pocket. I've been nothing

[59:50] But positive for the most part of Stern Pimball

[59:54] But being blacklisted by them and and this whole like we won't do anything for you, Chris

[01:00:00] But we'll do it for others. That's where I sort of draw the line and I and I said to them cool

[01:00:05] If you want to take that approach and you know

[01:00:07] Then cool, then I'll be there. I'll be that disruptive controversial figure that you

[01:00:14] Want to label me as because I don't think I am and I think when you listen to my interviews

[01:00:19] I George Gomez go back and listen to our interview together go back and listen to the great interviews with Christopher

[01:00:26] Franchie the interviews with zombie Yeti listen to them and tell me

[01:00:30] That we can't go on this guy's show all right, so we'll see we'll see let's see this. I'm gonna give Zach

[01:00:37] two weeks two weeks to um

[01:00:41] To respond with and and figure out something we can do and if he does in

[01:00:47] I will take something and reveal something about Stern that you would love that's really juicy all right all right cool

[01:00:54] All right, it's not a threat. It's not a threat. Maybe it's a little bit who knows

[01:00:58] But they can't do anything. I didn't sign any NDA. So we're all good there. All right. What else is going on

[01:01:04] Spooky pinball then we're gonna close down soon because I yeah, this isn't this isn't head-to-head pinball

[01:01:08] We're not going for two hours. So spooky pinball TNA is selling well

[01:01:12] Alice Cooper is going into production. I don't know if they've sold every single Alice Cooper

[01:01:17] I doubted it. I doubted I doubt 500 people have given them $1,000. I bet they have a list

[01:01:25] Of 500 people that want it. I bet they've gone down that list and asked for the deposits from maybe the first

[01:01:33] I don't know 100 or 200 people

[01:01:35] You know because I have to order the parts and that's when it gets real

[01:01:39] But I doubt they've they've made all 500 people pay

[01:01:43] So that's going on there

[01:01:45] So game number one actually shipped in June the end of June like the last I think game number one is going to Alice Cooper

[01:01:51] And I think it shipped the last day of June

[01:01:54] So that is great. I you know here's the thing about Alice Cooper and and I've been saying this

[01:01:58] I think you guys out there who put $1,000 deposits down on the game without ever playing it

[01:02:04] Man you guys are like kind of crazy and I'll say why

[01:02:08] Spooky has never really shown this game off properly. There's never been a video

[01:02:14] It's like they act like we live in a world where there's not like HD cameras and Jack Danger could come over and set up like his rig

[01:02:22] and you could actually show people what they're

[01:02:25] Investing in and what they're putting a deposit on I think the game looks beautiful

[01:02:30] I just don't think people really have

[01:02:34] All the knowledge they need to know how the game plays to see the code

[01:02:39] And I think we live in an error where you really shouldn't

[01:02:43] Sell something that you know, you're not really giving people enough info to act on

[01:02:48] But it's not spooky's fault because they can do what they want

[01:02:52] The for those of you out there who are putting deposits down and you're not sure

[01:02:57] There's something wrong with you there, right? Like why why no one's forcing you

[01:03:02] So once again

[01:03:04] We have this fear of missing out continues to be a common theme in

[01:03:09] In making people act a certain way in the pinball hobby all right

[01:03:13] So but I'm excited. I think TNA sort of has blown everyone's wildest imaginations away

[01:03:18] It's really really critical that they signed that game up to give them more time to make Alice Cooper a better game

[01:03:25] And I couldn't be happier for Scott Dinesy and Charlie and company that you know they made the right move

[01:03:31] And I think what they the lesson they've taught people is that

[01:03:36] You can't just always do things according to your plans that sometimes you have to call an audible

[01:03:42] And sometimes you have to look out there in the world and say hey

[01:03:46] Can we find another game that's ready to be made and put it into production and can we get sales there and you look

[01:03:54] That game sold better than Charlie's first two efforts

[01:03:57] And I know they're working on a new Scott Dinesy game, but there's like no details on that so

[01:04:03] I think it's good to you know spooky is still in the game

[01:04:06] We'll see how the game plays soon. It's gonna be interesting if people are not loving it and people's deposits are locked in how that goes down

[01:04:14] All right, a couple more things that I want to just talk about my quick hiatus and then we'll let you guys go

[01:04:19] so

[01:04:20] I saw that there was a magic girl for sale. We already talked about the 21 oh so sorry

[01:04:25] There's a $21,000 big Lebowski for sale. This guy saw Eric. Sorry Kim Mitchell sell his for 20k

[01:04:33] $21,000 for the big Lebowski

[01:04:36] Again, if you if you're a multi-millionaire that probably means nothing to you

[01:04:41] If you're a pinball collector that wants to have a pinball machine that has a story to tell whether it's a good story or not

[01:04:48] You know you could go in on that kind of game

[01:04:50] I again in my time off from this hobby

[01:04:53] The more I step back the more I realize that

[01:04:58] You know $20,000 for a pinball machine. It's just ludicrous. It just is especially one

[01:05:04] Where you're not gonna ever have support and one that has such a negative story attached to it, okay?

[01:05:10] But making it even making that listing even more comical is someone is trying to sell their magic girl for

[01:05:17] $25,000 now let me let me let me stop for a minute

[01:05:21] buying a magic girl now for

[01:05:24] $25,000 when you know

[01:05:27] That it's broken it doesn't work and it sucks like let me just repeat that magic girl

[01:05:33] Sucks it is the most beautiful

[01:05:36] Tirt on planet earth it sucks owning it

[01:05:40] I know you can set it up and like people come into the room like oh wow

[01:05:44] Yeah, that looks awesome and you're like yeah, but it doesn't work

[01:05:47] It sucks. It's designed poorly shots go nowhere. You can't start a multi-ball

[01:05:53] That the stupid out lanes on it are way too wide open that the ball just drains left and right that the spinner on the left side by the outline

[01:06:01] The jinx doesn't do anything doesn't even grab the ball the the levitation chamber doesn't work because they didn't put the ramp to

[01:06:08] It goes on, but it doesn't catch the ball

[01:06:10] It sucks and what's funny about this listing as the guy says

[01:06:14] It's 19 of 19 it's the last one made and I just want to tell you guys out there that that guy's wrong

[01:06:22] They made more than 19 magic girls. They made about 23 to 25 magic girls American pinball did

[01:06:29] So 19 is not the last one

[01:06:31] 19 is the last of the regular versions they made here's what I want to tell you the reality is

[01:06:38] Is that they also made some prototypes now the prototype magic girls are the only ones if you were looking to buy one of the rare

[01:06:46] Magic girls in American pinball made the only ones worth owning are the prototypes

[01:06:52] All right, you know who has a prototype

[01:06:54] Chris from coin ticker that was the one I was gonna buy I'll tell you why the prototype

[01:06:59] Has the original play field and artwork the prototype actually has

[01:07:03] Outlane post that for some unknown reason American pinball yanked out of the game

[01:07:09] The prototype actually has two holes in front of the levitation chamber

[01:07:15] Where the like metal rail goes to create the little ramp so that chamber can actually work

[01:07:21] Why that stuff was removed from the American pinball version is beyond me it was a rush job

[01:07:28] The prototype artwork is a little bit different

[01:07:30] It also has a completely different cabinet artwork. It's not the

[01:07:35] The lion saw it's completely different and so that to me is the rare

[01:07:42] One worth owning, but again

[01:07:44] It none of them are worth owning

[01:07:47] You know, it's just it's just not it's like

[01:07:51] picking which blow up doll you want to have sex with so people think you're cool like

[01:07:56] Yeah, I'm sure some are better than the others, but again like at the end of the day none of them are worth it

[01:08:01] So

[01:08:02] That's happening in the pinball world. All right. God. Well, see we're already chewed up an hour

[01:08:08] I want to just give some quick thoughts on

[01:08:11] You know when you take a break from this hobby and I recommend that most of you guys who are

[01:08:16] Living in the pinball hobby who are on the form every day

[01:08:19] I want to just share some quick thoughts about what it was like just you know taking a break

[01:08:23] so first and foremost

[01:08:25] um

[01:08:25] I think pinball is a great hobby. I think the passion that you guys have for this hobby

[01:08:29] I think the conversation around these pinball machines

[01:08:34] There's never a dull moment and even when I started reading pin sight again. It was just it's just funny to see

[01:08:40] How much people react in this hobby? You know, I bet like in the Lego

[01:08:45] hobby

[01:08:46] People are not going on to the Lego forms being like you idiot like you put the brick in the wrong place

[01:08:52] You more like no like there's no hobby where people are as at odds with with each other quite like pinball

[01:09:00] But I also want to say that that's not exactly a true

[01:09:04] painting of this hobby and what I mean by that is most of the vitriol and most of the drama and most of the controversy and most of the negativity

[01:09:15] It really just lives on pin sight like you don't you don't encounter it anywhere else out in the world

[01:09:21] So like if I were to spend a month

[01:09:23] Going to pinball bars and pinball shows. I would really have nothing but a good time

[01:09:28] And so it all comes back to when you spend a lot of time on a forum

[01:09:34] That is inundated with certain individuals that have just too much time on their hands

[01:09:41] And they really really really thrive on just you know stirring the pot

[01:09:47] It creates a lot of negativity and and and and but in a weird way

[01:09:52] You need those individuals on those sites to make it interesting. So that's the dilemma of like this podcast of just in general

[01:10:00] Of covering a hobby where there's not a lot of news and there's not a lot of talk about you know the the

[01:10:05] On pin sight the the thing people talk about the least

[01:10:09] And you'll notice this the thing they talk about the least is actually playing the machines right?

[01:10:14] Isn't that ironic? It's like all this hoopla around like

[01:10:17] speculation and niz and we need this in pinball. We need that in pinball and then machines come out

[01:10:23] And then people just stop talking about it. It's like all this build up

[01:10:28] To that moment. It's like it's like we're all just addicted to the reveal of a game

[01:10:33] The game comes out and ultimately

[01:10:36] It's just another pinball machine. It's not gonna change your life

[01:10:39] It's just a toy. It's not gonna make your health better

[01:10:43] It's not gonna improve your relationship with your wife

[01:10:45] It's not gonna make your kids like you anymore. It's not gonna make your neighbors more impressed with you

[01:10:50] It's not gonna bring you new friends. It's just a box of lights and a steel ball rolling around

[01:10:57] Right, and I think a lot of people

[01:11:00] Who who live on these forums they create almost like too much of an importance of what these machines are supposed to do for us

[01:11:09] I mean, they're really not gonna do much

[01:11:11] You know, and I took a break. I you know, I kind of felt like people treat me like I need I need pinball

[01:11:16] Like I like I need this podcast. I need this attention. I thought it's it's not really the case. I say for me

[01:11:23] I would say pinball probably eats up about 10 to 15% of my week or my time in terms of like

[01:11:29] where I spend time on the internet and doing this podcast

[01:11:33] But when I let it go

[01:11:35] When I let it go when I stop reading pinside and I stop engaging

[01:11:39] I still have a lot of other things that I'm really interested in and I will say like you feel better when you sort of

[01:11:47] Take a break from all of it because pinball is also a hobby where

[01:11:53] When you go out into the real world

[01:11:55] Most people don't care

[01:11:57] I went to France. I went to Cannes. I went to Dublin. I went I traveled

[01:12:02] I've been into different parts of the world and you have to seek pinball out like pinball is not gonna be the thing

[01:12:08] You start talking to a bloke at a bar about it's gonna be world cup. It's gonna be movies

[01:12:13] It's it's not a good icebreaker for 99% of the world

[01:12:17] Again, I do like the fact that it's like this niche hobby that you know a few people know a lot about but most know nothing about

[01:12:25] Another interesting thing happened to me

[01:12:27] So I had two guys come by to install my air conditioning unit, right

[01:12:33] So they come into my bedroom and there's my Batman 66 super early and these guys like their eyes light up

[01:12:39] They're like oh my god now one guy says to the other guy he goes, you know this this machine here

[01:12:46] This is a classic and

[01:12:49] And I kind of just was like what and then I realized

[01:12:54] To most people

[01:12:56] All pinball is old right. It's an old toy. It's a toy that comes from decades ago

[01:13:03] They don't know that this is a you know a

[01:13:06] 2017 machine that cost 15,000 dollars to they see a pinball machine like a Batman 66 and it literally looks like

[01:13:16] It came from 1996, right and that's just the reality of our hobby is we're still

[01:13:23] grown-ups living in the past and a lot of us a lot of us

[01:13:29] You know, we have a longing and an nostalgia for the way things were and

[01:13:34] You know somewhere along the line though

[01:13:36] We've all grown up and a lot of us have more disposable income

[01:13:40] But I do I do want to say one thing and then I'm gonna get off this soapbox in a little bit and let you guys have it an amazing

[01:13:47] Fourth of July week

[01:13:48] I do want to say one thing. I do think that for the most part and this is just me talking generally

[01:13:56] I do think for the most part

[01:13:58] Most of these modern pinball games are a ripoff. I think they're overpriced

[01:14:04] I don't think you get what you're paying for. I think a lot of these games are priced far above

[01:14:12] What goes in to the actual machines?

[01:14:16] And I think the companies that try and put as much as they can into equal the price

[01:14:21] um

[01:14:22] Have often struggled to make it a machine that you really want to own and and the thing that I realized too is

[01:14:29] I know there's no way around this because as a marketer. I know why this stuff exists

[01:14:35] But the whole notion

[01:14:37] Again, this is just me thinking philosophically over this month break the whole notion of like limited edition machine

[01:14:44] Where nothing in the gameplay experience is limited or unique to that game

[01:14:49] I think is the dumbest thing ever and we've I think everyone

[01:14:55] Just falls victim to the art packages and the things that don't cost a lot to change

[01:15:02] Or what these companies are changing and then they're charging you so much more money

[01:15:09] For a game that you could have the same exact game

[01:15:13] For so much less because all you're paying for then is some silly little plaque or art package that cost them nothing to differentiate

[01:15:24] And I think it's stupid like it's stupid that I have a 15,000-hour pinball machine

[01:15:29] That I could have the same exact experience for seven for for 50% less almost

[01:15:34] Yeah, you know that's to me that's idiotic and

[01:15:38] I know why they do it, you know, it's like just so guys can say I have one of the 500 or one of the 400

[01:15:45] If there's anything I want to see in this pinball hobby

[01:15:48] It's I would love to see that

[01:15:50] Things that are supposed to be limited and special actually become that or stop charging all this money

[01:15:58] You know, I still see new Stern machines and they all they all look like they should be like $6,000 to me

[01:16:04] Like there's just nothing that screams $9,000 and then when I hear there's gonna be a super early of the monsters

[01:16:10] It's like it's probably not gonna be 15 it'll probably be like 12 or maybe to super early of beetles

[01:16:16] I you know, it's just

[01:16:17] $10,000 like the experience of these machines is not worth it to me the only thing that would make me

[01:16:25] Want to spend that kind of money again is if I knew there were only like 40 or 50 these in the world and you know

[01:16:33] You can't go get the same exact version

[01:16:36] Which is different art and there's gonna make thousands of those and and and that's just did I just I you know, I sometimes

[01:16:44] I think people

[01:16:46] They look at this stuff and they they just try to convince themselves that they have to have this version

[01:16:52] But when you really step back, it's not special. It's just not again subjective right because the people are like what?

[01:16:58] It's special to me Chris. I grew up with Batman. I get it. I get it. I get it

[01:17:03] You know, I get it

[01:17:04] But I just think what you pay the money for the difference should be on the play field and in the experience more than just the art because the art is cheap

[01:17:14] It's cheap. There's so many good artists out there that work for peanuts. You may tap to artists out there

[01:17:21] Who are far better than zombie Eddie Christopher Franci all these guys like the tattoo artists out there insane

[01:17:28] That if you gave them the chance to immortalize their art on a pinball machine

[01:17:31] Then you could probably talk them into doing it for free if you just gave them one machine

[01:17:35] But you know somehow in the pinball world everyone got hoodwinked

[01:17:38] Because Greg Ferris was giving people like the worst art packages for like 10 years straight

[01:17:44] And then all of a sudden like one hand drawn guy that John poppadoot finds an all of a sudden like hey games are 50 grand

[01:17:50] You know, it's like so stupid

[01:17:53] um, but ultimately

[01:17:55] Ultimately

[01:17:57] I just encourage all of you out there and this is for me too like you just got a fine balance and like you know

[01:18:03] I was really ashamed by my behavior and I was really let down by how I act it and and I was disappointed in myself

[01:18:13] And I I did a lot of like thinking like well, why why is it coming to this like why are you getting

[01:18:20] To a point where you're acting out like this and you know

[01:18:24] You guys listen to my pinball podcast and and I love that you do

[01:18:28] But I'm also a human being who who has my own issues and and I have my own issues in life and in personal issues and demons inside me and things I deal with you know

[01:18:37] I've got family members that I haven't spoken to in 15 years because of some few that I don't even know a call like a lot of life going on

[01:18:46] and you know, we all act in ways that we we we don't like and

[01:18:51] You know, we can't go back and change the past

[01:18:55] But what we can do is is constantly work on ourselves and making ourselves better and and that's what I am always trying to do

[01:19:03] I sometimes I succeed sometimes I fail

[01:19:06] I think all of us are on the same journey

[01:19:09] I also you know, it's a summertime. I consider pinball a winter sport in New York

[01:19:13] I want to be out. I want to be meeting people. I want to be riding my bike. I want to be at the gym

[01:19:18] I want to feel good

[01:19:20] You know pinball is cool, but nothing makes me feel as good as as being healthy and my body and my mind feeling good

[01:19:29] And I'll say this you can put a lot of like

[01:19:32] Pinside cancer into your head and you can you can load your house with pinball machines and still be the loneliest man on the planet

[01:19:42] So find that balance and you'll be happy and look

[01:19:44] I consider life to be better with pinball in it

[01:19:48] I think it's a really fun thing to have in your life as a form of entertainment

[01:19:53] But it just shouldn't be the center of your universe, right? Everyone

[01:19:57] I'm glad to be back. I look forward to many more can-aided pinball podcast shows. I'm glad you're listening

[01:20:03] I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart who sent me notes like when's the show coming back? Are you okay?

[01:20:09] Are you dead? What happened? Are you being sued? All those things

[01:20:14] At all those notes meant a lot to me if you didn't

[01:20:17] Send me a note. It doesn't matter if you listen to this show. That is the only action

[01:20:23] That you need to do to show that you support

[01:20:27] This pinball podcast we do things differently

[01:20:30] We we we're not trying to be the other pinball podcasts out there. There are many other pinball podcasts out there

[01:20:36] They all do it their own way

[01:20:38] You can listen to whatever you want

[01:20:40] I'm just happy you listen to canators pinball podcasts everybody have a happy and healthy and safe fourth of July weekend
