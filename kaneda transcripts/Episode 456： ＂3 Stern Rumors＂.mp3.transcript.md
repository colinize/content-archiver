[00:00] Oh, you're not going to believe my morning.

[00:13] I just recorded an entire Valentine's Day special of Canadian Spinball podcast in which I

[00:20] said all these loving and glowing things about everyone in the hobby.

[00:26] And then I go back to listen to it and it was all scratchy.

[00:30] It's almost like the podcasting gods don't want me to air anything positive, but I'm going

[00:37] to do my best to redo what I was going to say.

[00:39] Now here's what's going to be fun about this episode of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:42] And we've been on a role this week giving you news, rumors and speculations.

[00:47] And I have three pretty much what I'm hearing are confirmed things that are going to happen

[00:53] at Stern Pinball.

[00:54] So three things that I haven't heard anyone talk about to this level of detail that is

[01:00] going to happen at Stern Pinball this year.

[01:03] And the reason why I got this tip, it's funny.

[01:05] Someone reached out to me and said, Chris, I'm sick of the shenanigans with Stern Pinball

[01:10] and this UV kit has made me so annoyed that I'm going to give you this information that

[01:17] I know is happening at Stern Pinball.

[01:19] And I said, my man, I'll happily take it.

[01:22] And for those of you out there.

[01:24] If you have Pinball news, rumors and speculation that you feel comes from a good source, you

[01:29] know where to bring it.

[01:30] I was thinking maybe I should pay people for Pinball rumors that are confirmed.

[01:35] Like ten bucks for the rumor and then a hundred bucks if it's confirmed to be true.

[01:39] Wouldn't that just make exact sharps day if I did that?

[01:42] Anyway, all right.

[01:43] So here's a few news items and we'll talk about these Stern things happening in 2020.

[01:48] So first and foremost, if you ordered a medieval man is from Chicago gaming company, get

[01:53] ready to get your game.

[01:55] And I mean the new ones, the remake of the remake of the remake, the royal additions,

[01:59] the new SCs, the ones with the big screens and the sexy toppers.

[02:02] The first one was unboxed yesterday.

[02:05] It's been a really long wait for you guys.

[02:07] I know you ordered it months and months and months ago, but they are now on the line and

[02:13] they are shipping to people.

[02:14] So that is great news.

[02:16] Now I also got a response to my last podcast, which is interesting because I said that

[02:22] Jersey Jack Pinball was going to move its design and manufacturing all under one roof

[02:29] in Chicago.

[02:30] Now they already have design there for the most part.

[02:33] Now what I did not say is that they were combining with Stern Pinball.

[02:38] I saw on PinSide.

[02:40] It's amazing how a story starts to take a life of itself.

[02:43] I did not say they were going to combine with Stern Pinball or anyone else in the Chicago

[02:48] area.

[02:49] It just makes more sense for them to do this, I think, for a financial reason.

[02:53] And we'll see if it happens.

[02:55] Jersey Illinois Pinball is not as nice as Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:59] And so I also, I guess I was pronouncing its Ametron, not Ametron, which is American Pinball,

[03:08] the company that is now acquiring American Pinball.

[03:11] It's always been part of it from the very get go.

[03:14] And I also, when I said that the Chicago gaming company would be working with Mark Richie

[03:20] on an original license game, the company that they're partnering with, I believe, I said

[03:25] was game mechanics, but it's actually play mechanics.

[03:30] And if you Google play mechanics with an X at the end, an alien, they actually made an

[03:36] alien arcade machine, I believe, with raw thrills.

[03:41] So this adds a little bit more truth to the rumor that this might happen.

[03:46] And if you're a fox and you're in your play mechanics and you've worked with Fox before

[03:51] and making an alien game, I bet Fox is pretty pissed off how their alien pinball machine

[03:57] never really saw the light of day.

[03:59] And maybe this is going to happen.

[04:01] We know the demand is there.

[04:02] If you made a great alien pinball machine and had great sound and great modes and put

[04:08] everything people loved about alien into it, you would sell thousands of them.

[04:13] This is the perfect theme for pinball.

[04:16] And I think it's silly that no one has really aggressively tried to solve the problems

[04:22] that Andrew Highway created with the alien property.

[04:25] All right, what else is going on?

[04:27] So we also talked about how American Pinball, you know, we're going to get the same results

[04:31] with the same team.

[04:32] And I think I undersold a little bit of the biggest development and that is that Jim Patla,

[04:39] I believe is his name, is part of the American pinball team now.

[04:44] Now if you don't know Jim Patla, he is, he has a long history in pinball.

[04:49] He was the game designer in the 70s and 80s for almost 40 games, games like Centaur, games

[04:55] like Kiss.

[04:56] And he has extensive, extensive experience coming from the management team at Williams pinball.

[05:05] So him being on board at American pinball is a very good thing.

[05:09] He's going to be at TPS.

[05:11] Now he also, you know, he hasn't made games in a while.

[05:15] He wasn't part of the whole 90s era of pinball.

[05:19] And if you look at his roster of game design, it does sort of end in that more solid state

[05:24] period of pinball.

[05:26] Now that being said, so what?

[05:28] Let's see what he can do because I think what I've always said is American pinball needs

[05:32] their George Gomez.

[05:34] And can Jim become the George Gomez of American pinball?

[05:39] I would still love to talk to these guys from a marketing standpoint because I just, I

[05:43] don't know, I think they can push further than themes like Hot Wheels if that's the theme.

[05:46] But let's see, March is coming up super, super, super, super fast.

[05:49] I mean, we are going to see what's next from American pinball, deep root, we're going

[05:53] to see Stern's next game.

[05:55] We're going to see Jersey, Jackson X game all within that March to April window.

[06:00] Going to be awesome.

[06:01] Going to be more than enough content.

[06:03] So you guys don't have to listen to Canadian pinball podcasts.

[06:06] You other podcasters because it's all going to be public knowledge, all right?

[06:10] So Scott Dinesi interview happening happening on Sunday now because Scott Dinesi and Jack

[06:15] Danger are going to do like a world premiere streaming of Rick and Morty Pimball tomorrow

[06:22] at 12 central times.

[06:24] So 1 o'clock my time.

[06:25] God, it's going to be a beautiful sunny day in New York and I got to sit inside and watch

[06:28] pinball, but I'm going to do it because I think this means this is it.

[06:33] I think this game might be played.

[06:34] I don't know if it's going to be at spooky.

[06:36] I think it's at an actual bar like a location out there in the world, which means hopefully

[06:42] they finally received enough approvals from adult swim to get these games out the door

[06:47] because they've probably built by now 40 to 50 games, maybe 60 Charlie told me by the

[06:55] time they're going to start shipping.

[06:57] So the floodgates are going to open.

[06:59] We're going to see a lot of unboxings at once because they've been stockpiling the games

[07:05] they've been making and just waiting on approvals.

[07:07] And I'm number 50 so I can't wait to finally get my game.

[07:11] What I could wait for is the sticker shock of what I think it's going to be.

[07:15] I think my game with tax with butter cabinet is going to be over $10,000.

[07:21] It's over 10k by Christmas, right?

[07:24] I can't believe a spooky game is $10,000.

[07:29] What has happened to this hobby?

[07:31] I can't believe we have to replace a metal apron in a stern machine when they could have

[07:35] just gave us the metal apron from the factory with the UV lighting.

[07:39] Now talking of UV lighting, I got hit up from Ben Heck and he said, Chris, do you realize

[07:44] that pinball clear coats use automotive clear?

[07:48] Now automotive clear is designed to keep UV lighting out.

[07:54] So if this game is letting UV lighting in, stern might be using different clear coat

[08:00] for stranger things.

[08:02] And that might be just why the clear in this game is dimpling and cratering worse than

[08:08] most other stern releases recently.

[08:11] Maybe that's why I'm not 100% sure.

[08:13] I was also wondering, are there any laws or regulations about shipping or selling products

[08:19] that omit UV light?

[08:22] Because UV light is dangerous.

[08:24] UV light is what's found in tanning beds.

[08:27] And so did Stern hold this back to avoid any potential sales regulations that UV light

[08:33] products might have?

[08:36] Not sure.

[08:37] Completely making that up.

[08:38] It sounds really smart.

[08:39] I sound really smart right now in today.

[08:43] Maybe it was the Margarita's I drank last night.

[08:46] It's Valentine's Day people.

[08:48] You better have plans for your partner tonight.

[08:51] You better be taken and someone out for a nice dinner.

[08:54] You better and do not do this.

[08:57] Do not sit across from your wife tonight or your partner tonight and do not start talking

[09:03] about pinball.

[09:04] If you do, I hope your partner throws a glass of red wine in your face.

[09:10] You know me, I'm a drink tosser apparently.

[09:12] But you know what I'm saying?

[09:13] Don't spoil this night.

[09:16] There is nothing that's less romantic on planet earth than pinball.

[09:21] I mean sometimes I'm at dinner and Brenda looks at me.

[09:24] She's like, don't, don't.

[09:25] Like she sees me text me.

[09:27] She's like, is it pinball?

[09:29] Don't.

[09:30] Don't.

[09:31] And she's right.

[09:32] I shouldn't.

[09:33] Okay.

[09:34] So maybe that's the issue with the UV lighting.

[09:35] Oh man.

[09:36] All that debate back and forth.

[09:37] Everyone is Valentine's Day.

[09:39] Make love not war.

[09:41] Make love not war.

[09:43] I do enough like war mongering in this industry and this hobby, right?

[09:46] I create too much drama with people.

[09:48] God, he's so annoying.

[09:50] You know they want me to host the Twippies?

[09:52] Someone's been putting my name down.

[09:54] I think the committee has been sort of exploring.

[09:57] Canada hosting the Twippy Awards.

[09:59] Let me tell you what I told someone who asked me this.

[10:01] I said Axel Rose.

[10:03] Axel don't host the VMAs, man.

[10:05] I'm not going to host the Rock and Roll Hall fame.

[10:07] I'm outside the box, man.

[10:10] I'm outside the networks.

[10:11] I'm outside of the hosting of shows.

[10:16] It's not what I do.

[10:17] I get that I might be entertaining.

[10:18] I get that I might have the kind of personality

[10:21] that could keep a show like that going.

[10:23] I would go full Ricky Droveuse on the show at the beginning.

[10:26] I would have to have an opening monologue.

[10:28] But it's just not my thing.

[10:30] I don't want to be up there on stage.

[10:31] You know who I think should host the show?

[10:34] I think it should be Jack Danger.

[10:36] Or I think to me the best, because even Jack,

[10:39] I think some of us, we're two, I don't want to say

[10:43] divisive, but we've got our own brands.

[10:45] And our brands are different than I think

[10:48] who should host the show.

[10:49] You know who I think should really host it?

[10:51] I think Ed Robertson would make the best host

[10:53] on the planet.

[10:54] Ed Robertson, if you're listening to this show,

[10:57] I know you're expensive.

[10:59] I know you're hourly rate, trumps mine, but do it.

[11:04] You'll probably be there.

[11:05] Just get up there.

[11:06] I know, it's a lot.

[11:07] It's a lot.

[11:08] It's a lot.

[11:09] I think Greg and Zack did a great job.

[11:10] And you know, you can't, there's a lot of work

[11:12] that goes into hosting a show.

[11:14] You can't just get up there and spitball it.

[11:16] I'm a more of a spitball kind of guy.

[11:18] I don't like to do much research.

[11:19] Anyway, all right.

[11:20] When are we going to get to those stern tips and rumors

[11:23] and whatever, not tips or not tips?

[11:24] I'm not going to teach you how to play pinball better.

[11:26] How do you really teach someone how to play pinball

[11:29] better on a podcast?

[11:30] Isn't that something you want to see?

[11:32] I never understood that when you get the tournament talk

[11:34] podcast, we're going to teach you how to get better.

[11:37] But you need to see stuff.

[11:39] It's not like we have a shortage of streams

[11:42] that shows how to play pinball better.

[11:43] Anyway, everyone do your shows.

[11:45] Everyone enjoy your shows.

[11:46] I guess it's just all for the fun and games of it all.

[11:49] That's what pinball is about.

[11:51] And it should be about that, all right?

[11:52] It should be.

[11:53] But I am a competitive person.

[11:55] And if I'm going to make a podcast,

[11:57] I do want it to be the best podcast,

[11:59] the most entertaining podcast on planet earth.

[12:01] And the thing that tells you, your popular

[12:04] are the numbers of listeners, right?

[12:06] And that's why I share them with you

[12:07] on every episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[12:09] We have some good shows.

[12:10] We have some bad shows.

[12:11] We have some great shows.

[12:13] We have some horrible shows.

[12:14] But we always give you shows.

[12:16] OK, so Stern rumors.

[12:17] Stern rumors.

[12:18] Anything else?

[12:19] I'm missing.

[12:20] Anything else I'm missing?

[12:21] I don't think so.

[12:22] Let's get right to the reason why you've

[12:25] lasted the last 12 minutes on this podcast.

[12:28] These are the three things happening at Stern pinball in 2020.

[12:32] Yes, they are rumors.

[12:33] But I'm getting these from, as I mentioned,

[12:35] a really good source who is fed up with Stern's UV shenanigans.

[12:40] OK, so I am, I'm going to give these to you

[12:43] in order of, I think, least significance to most significant.

[12:47] OK, all right.

[12:48] So what would happen this last few months ago,

[12:51] where a month ago, Stern surprised us all

[12:53] with the vaulting of a vault edition of Iron Man.

[12:57] Now, the first thing that I know is going to happen

[12:59] at Stern pinball is they are going

[13:01] to bring another title back.

[13:03] And sorry, it's not Lord of the Rings or Tron, which

[13:07] is what everybody wants.

[13:09] Stern is going to do in 2020 another run of a game you all

[13:15] know very well.

[13:16] And that game, which you all don't need another run of,

[13:21] which you could have bought already 18 times over,

[13:25] that game is Metallica.

[13:28] So Stern is doing another run of Metallica pinball

[13:32] in 2020.

[13:34] OK, what do we think of that?

[13:36] Not surprised.

[13:38] They're just going to keep making some of these games

[13:40] because they're easy to put on the line.

[13:42] They probably sell decently well.

[13:43] And they probably have leftover parts

[13:45] and they want to just get rid of them all.

[13:47] So that's that.

[13:49] The next thing I'm hearing, number two,

[13:51] on Canada's Valentine's Day, let's spoil Stern's news

[13:54] of 2020, is that Led Zeppelin is happening.

[13:59] But Led Zeppelin is not going to be a reskin of Quick Silver.

[14:05] Led Zeppelin is going to be an all-original new game

[14:09] made by no other than the King himself, Steve Richie.

[14:14] So Steve Richie is making Led Zeppelin,

[14:17] and it will be revealed at Expo 2020.

[14:21] So that's a little bit of a news on an title

[14:24] that we've been hearing a lot of rumors about Led Zeppelin.

[14:27] Steve Richie, original game.

[14:29] All right, number three.

[14:31] And again, two and three, I think,

[14:32] are equally maybe of significance.

[14:34] So this is another old title that Stern is bringing back into play.

[14:42] Now, this is a theme that is humongous within,

[14:46] I think, the pinball buying demographic.

[14:49] It's a theme that was never quite done the right way.

[14:53] And for some reason, this game never hit when it came out.

[14:57] It had a lot of nice sort of unique design layouts and toys.

[15:03] I don't know.

[15:04] I mean, I think you could look at this game and say,

[15:07] it's loaded.

[15:08] I think you could look at the game and say,

[15:09] well, there's a lot of stuff stuck on it,

[15:11] but there's really not that much.

[15:12] But it didn't go down as one of the better games

[15:16] in Stern's portfolio.

[15:18] And it never really reached up to the popularity of the theme.

[15:23] It's self.

[15:24] And so I think what they're going to try and do

[15:27] is breathe new life into it with a new package,

[15:31] a new presence of this game.

[15:34] Now, I don't know if they're going to do what they did

[15:36] with Spider-Man with it and actually

[15:39] revisit some of the game and make improvements,

[15:43] but the game that Stern is bringing back in 2020

[15:48] is no other than Transformers.

[15:52] OK, they are going to bring back Transformers.

[15:55] And the way they're doing it is Stern

[15:57] is going to do it comic book art style,

[16:01] all of what they just did with Star Wars.

[16:04] So will this work?

[16:06] And I'm not sure if they're going to do the current Transformer

[16:09] art package, comic book art, or if they're

[16:12] going to go back more towards the old school G1 comic book style.

[16:16] But that is what Stern, I'm hearing.

[16:18] The rumor is that Stern is going to reissue Transformers

[16:23] with comic book style art.

[16:25] And that's happening in 2020 as well.

[16:28] So all of a sudden it's like, wow,

[16:30] so we got Ninja Turtles, Transformers, Metallica, Led Zeppelin.

[16:34] And Led Zeppelin will be considered.

[16:36] I didn't mention this.

[16:37] It will be considered a cornerstone title from Stern Pimble.

[16:42] So if you now consider stranger things

[16:45] to be a 2020 title, Ninja Turtles a cornerstone,

[16:50] and Led Zeppelin a cornerstone, well,

[16:53] that's three cornerstone titles all of a sudden.

[16:56] So I don't know, are we seeing, do we now

[16:59] know what most of the big titles will be?

[17:01] Now, if Led Zeppelin is in Expo, in October,

[17:07] November time period, then that means there

[17:09] will be another Stern game that comes out in summer.

[17:13] And they usually bring a cornerstone game out

[17:15] in the summertime the way they brought out

[17:17] Jurassic Park in the summer.

[17:18] So usually June, July is when Stern's next cornerstone

[17:23] will hit after its March April cornerstone game.

[17:26] All right, and then they're going to fill in the gaps

[17:28] with some of these remakes and reissues.

[17:30] So that is what I'm hearing is happening.

[17:32] Let's see if Canadian goes three for three on these.

[17:35] Let's see if Zach Sharp calls someone into his office

[17:37] and starts yelling at them right now.

[17:39] How did he know where does Canadian get his source material from?

[17:43] And if you have rumors about anything

[17:45] happening in Pimbal, email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[17:50] And I will do my best to try and verify stuff.

[17:53] But stuff like this, I mean, I don't care.

[17:54] I hear stuff like this, I'm going to tell you.

[17:56] But this comes from a very trusted friend

[18:00] who's got a very trusted source.

[18:03] And I'll just leave it at that.

[18:05] OK, so I think this is going to happen.

[18:07] All right, everyone.

[18:09] On my other show, I read some of your emails.

[18:12] And I want to thank all of you who have emailed me in.

[18:14] Instead of reading the emails again,

[18:16] because I just, I can't.

[18:19] I can't do the same show twice.

[18:20] And believe me, I said such beautiful things about all of you.

[18:24] I just want to call out a couple of people who emailed me

[18:27] in what they said.

[18:28] I'll paraphrase it.

[18:29] How's that sound?

[18:30] Or in an opening up canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[18:33] I mean, I love having an inbox of emails

[18:37] where I get to see what's going on in your guys' world.

[18:39] So Matthew Stevens, Matthew basically

[18:42] said to me, Chris, I'm an early owner of Stranger Things.

[18:46] And I'm not buying this UV kit.

[18:48] This is the straw that broke the camel's back.

[18:50] And I'm done with Stern for now.

[18:53] And I think a lot of people out there share Matthew

[18:57] and Matt's opinions about this kit.

[18:59] But here's the problem, Matt.

[19:00] It's like, if you're $9,100 in on an LED,

[19:04] how are you not going to just cave eventually

[19:06] and put this into your game?

[19:08] It's hard not to do it.

[19:10] It's unfortunate.

[19:11] I don't like the business practice.

[19:13] But I don't see how you could play that game.

[19:16] And every time you go into the upside down mode,

[19:20] knowing there's a really cooler way

[19:22] to experience that in the game, you're

[19:24] not going to get because of $280.

[19:28] I mean, people are spending $750 on a crappy R2D2 topper.

[19:33] It's just the fact that this should have been part of the game.

[19:36] I get it.

[19:38] And people who have their principles will stay out of this.

[19:41] They won't go in on it.

[19:43] But it's unfortunate.

[19:45] I've never seen anything like this.

[19:46] I mean, I've been covering this hobby for years.

[19:48] I've just never seen any feature where you had to pay extra

[19:52] to unlock it like this since I've been covering this hobby.

[19:56] So I think it's scummy.

[19:58] And I think people feel that way.

[20:00] And I'm not sure why there's so many.

[20:02] There's not so many.

[20:03] There's like a few vocal.

[20:04] And they're very vocal on Pinside.

[20:07] Stern apologist.

[20:10] It's weird to me.

[20:11] It's like, you've got guys that just have so much money

[20:13] that I think they just like to sort of bump their chest

[20:17] against everyone else and beat their chest.

[20:19] How we're all a bunch of winers and complainers.

[20:22] And we have FOMO and we're suckers.

[20:24] And I don't think that's the case.

[20:26] I mean, it's not about, again, because it's just not

[20:29] about the money.

[20:29] No one's complaining that you're not getting your value.

[20:32] I mean, you get a metal apron if you have an Ellie

[20:34] or a premium.

[20:35] That costs more money than the plastic one.

[20:37] I think the pro kit should be cheaper for sure.

[20:40] The pro one's not giving you a metal apron.

[20:42] I think the pro kit should be like 200 bucks.

[20:45] I don't know why it's the same price.

[20:47] And it sucks because if you have a pro, you can't,

[20:50] even though you're spending 280,

[20:52] you can't install the metal apron into your game

[20:55] because the brackets are different for the apron.

[20:58] Because the Ellie and premium apron,

[21:01] it has different connections because of the projector

[21:04] that's inside that apron.

[21:06] So don't think you can upgrade either.

[21:09] Oh, man, I just wish it didn't happen.

[21:10] Got an email from, let's see, do, do, do, do,

[21:14] Kelly Daniel said, Chris, it's your fault

[21:16] Stern's doing all this stuff.

[21:18] You keep giving them these marketing ideas

[21:19] and then they're taking advantage of them.

[21:21] Well, it's just marketing.

[21:23] Marketing is how do we increase our market share?

[21:26] How do we increase our revenue?

[21:28] But here's the other part of marketing

[21:30] that Stern's falling down on.

[21:32] There, as much as they're increasing revenue,

[21:34] I think they're losing, I think they're losing people's good will.

[21:38] And I think they're turning people off.

[21:41] And that's not good marketing.

[21:43] You don't want to load your books up this year

[21:46] only to realize like you're turning more and more people away

[21:49] next year.

[21:50] Because here's what's going to happen.

[21:52] When the economy gets kind of lean,

[21:54] you're going to need to have your core,

[21:58] enthusiast base satisfied.

[22:00] There are going to be the people that pull you through the hard time.

[22:04] Now, unfortunately, well, maybe fortunately,

[22:06] there haven't been any hard times.

[22:08] And there hasn't been any competition for Stern in like a decade.

[22:11] And so because of that, they really are operating

[22:15] in such a unique way.

[22:16] Like if you're them right now, you have no competition,

[22:21] you can do whatever you want.

[22:23] You've got thousands of people that buy your products every year.

[22:27] And you keep increasing the prices while yanking stuff out of games.

[22:31] And they're still buying.

[22:32] You haven't even reached your ceiling yet

[22:35] on what people will pay for a game that has a bomb of close to $3,000.

[22:41] I mean, they sold people $15,000 L virus

[22:45] that only cost them around $3,000 to $4,000 to make.

[22:48] And they must be saying that to themselves,

[22:51] could we have got 18?

[22:52] Could we have got 20?

[22:54] The one game where it all failed,

[22:56] the marketing experiment was a total failure was Beatles.

[23:01] And what sucks is this, it didn't fail for Stern.

[23:04] Stern sold through their Beatles a lot, man.

[23:07] Stern is not sitting on Beatles inventory.

[23:10] What sucks for Stern's distributors is Beatles.

[23:13] Because Stern distributors are the ones that had to play along

[23:17] with that ridiculous sales package.

[23:21] You had to buy 10 golds to get one or two platforms

[23:25] to get one diamond edition.

[23:27] So they made people buy like 12 games just to get that rare version of the game.

[23:33] And then people realized there was nothing special about it.

[23:36] And so that is why if you go on eBay today,

[23:40] it's flooded the top games that keep coming up,

[23:43] are jerksters trying to sell,

[23:47] diamond edition, Beatles for $25,000, $28,000.

[23:51] And some people actually spent $25,000 on the game.

[23:55] I've seen Beatles, Diamonds, New Enbox sell for $12,000, $14,000.

[24:00] It's not even worth that.

[24:02] If you stand over a platinum edition one,

[24:04] it looks exactly the same.

[24:06] And again, it was just like, are you really going to spend something like

[24:10] $17,000 more than a Beatles gold,

[24:15] just because of a little meaningless, worthless plaque, right?

[24:19] They didn't even do anything else in the game for you.

[24:21] No, not even a unique mode, but it failed.

[24:24] And I'm glad it failed because I think they overestimated

[24:28] the popularity of Beatles today within this demographic.

[24:32] And I think they got lazy because they just re-skinned an old game.

[24:36] It just wasn't special.

[24:38] Now, if they had now imagine this,

[24:40] if they had made something like a crazy Beatles,

[24:44] like Yellow Submarine, John Poppiduke,

[24:48] Magic Girl kind of looking game,

[24:49] that just looks like a psychedelic, crazy ramps and magnets and shots

[24:55] and loopty loops and submarines going into lower playfields with holograms,

[24:59] if they had gone over the top and made only 150 Yellow Submarine Beatles,

[25:06] Pimbal machines at $20,000 a pop,

[25:09] yeah, then you sell everyone.

[25:10] Because you actually did some work.

[25:12] You didn't just throw artwork on an old game and call it a day.

[25:17] Sorry, it didn't work.

[25:18] It didn't work. Okay. Anyway.

[25:19] So here's my thing. Here's my thing.

[25:21] I got another email from a guy.

[25:22] Let me tell you his name.

[25:23] He said he, at first, he didn't like Star Wars.

[25:26] And now he likes it.

[25:28] And he played the premium and he wanted to know if I had changed my mind

[25:32] on Star Wars.

[25:34] Yeah, so as Alex Baz, he said,

[25:36] the interview with Damien Haggis was great and that he's played Star Wars

[25:39] and loves it now and wanted to know what I think.

[25:42] And I've said it before, like Star Wars to me is a total miss for two reasons.

[25:47] The code is just a complicated nightmare.

[25:50] And I don't care. It's like, it's just, it's not the journey of Star Wars.

[25:54] It's all mashed together.

[25:56] But ultimately, where I don't like is the lack of creativity in the game itself.

[26:01] And Star Wars is one of the greatest movies with the greatest source material

[26:04] to make some of the greatest creative things happen in a Pimbal machine.

[26:07] Let me give you an example.

[26:09] How do you not sit down in a room and say,

[26:11] let's have an ad ad walker, like an AT-AT walker.

[26:14] You know, the ones in Empire Strikes Back where they loop the cables around,

[26:18] the legs and it falls down.

[26:20] How do you not, with all of your engineering abilities, Stern?

[26:24] How do you not design an ad ad walker in which there is an orbit that goes around its legs

[26:31] and you keep shooting the orbit?

[26:33] Okay. And then it's walking and then if you shoot the orbit enough, it falls down.

[26:37] It like leans down like in the movie.

[26:38] How do you not make that an amazing mode, magical moment in Pimbal?

[26:42] Instead we get this, what I think is just an uninspired game.

[26:47] I'm sorry, it's just uninspired.

[26:49] It feels like they moved over a mech that Richie had been working on for something else

[26:54] and put it into Star Wars.

[26:55] The Hyperloop is not a big part of the Star Wars world.

[26:59] You have no lightsabers that even light up on the game.

[27:01] It's just I'm tired of talking about what I think is the biggest uninspired creative

[27:08] translation of the biggest theme ever, which is Star Wars.

[27:12] But you bring up a good point.

[27:13] If you like the game and you play a game and you enjoy it and you love it,

[27:17] that's all that matters.

[27:18] I'm one opinion.

[27:20] It's my opinion that I think Stranger Things could have been so much more and lacks creativity.

[27:25] That's my opinion.

[27:26] If you like it, great.

[27:28] I think if you look at that game,

[27:31] there's hardly anything physically going on in the game.

[27:33] Hardly anything.

[27:35] I don't know how you argue against it.

[27:37] And so much of the stuff that is supposed to wow us is not really interactive.

[27:43] And so it's just more screens, more lights, more this.

[27:47] But how about actually designing a magical mechanism coming from a guy that's known for

[27:53] creating the most magical mech of all time?

[27:57] I'm sorry, I just see it as a miss.

[27:59] And I think a lot of people feel the same way as me and that's cool.

[28:02] But if you love it, that's great.

[28:04] Why do people, you know, that's it.

[28:06] It's like you open up a machine.

[28:07] If you enjoy it, enjoy it.

[28:08] If you don't, don't buy it.

[28:10] If you buy it and don't enjoy it, you can easily sell it.

[28:13] It's the great thing about pinball.

[28:15] You know, I can go buy an $8,000 Gucci blazer, right?

[28:19] I can go buy it today.

[28:21] If I don't like the way the jacket fits or I get bored of it and I go to sell it like

[28:25] a month from now, you're not going to get anywhere near a great

[28:29] grant.

[28:30] And trust me, you can buy $8,000 blazer as a Gucci trust me again, which is crazy.

[28:34] So you know, for all things considered, this is still a great hobby to be a part of that.

[28:39] You're not going to lose the shirt off your back if you're not happy about a game after

[28:43] buying it, okay?

[28:44] All right.

[28:45] Well, look, guys, have a happy Valentine's Day.

[28:48] Again, take care of your health.

[28:50] Take care of your family.

[28:51] Take care of yourselves.

[28:53] And you know, as you're out tonight, do not talk pinball.

[28:57] Please, please give your partner a break, have a happy Valentine's Day.

[29:03] We'll be back.

[29:04] We'll be back with Scott Dinesi.

[29:06] I'm talking to Bill Webb as well.

[29:08] We're going to talk pinball.

[29:09] I know I feel bad when I talk to Bill.

[29:11] Like, it was all muffled when I was on special one late.

[29:14] So I've always wanted him to come back on and our schedules haven't lined up, but we're

[29:18] going to make it happen.

[29:20] Everyone, enjoy your pinball.

[29:22] We'll talk to you soon.

[29:23] Why do you want to fall in love?
