[00:00] We're going to do it right.

[00:16] We're going to F and do it right.

[00:22] We take a new prisoner on this episode.

[00:27] It's time.

[00:36] We're going to sit down and we're going to just talk pinball people.

[00:41] Let's get the link going.

[00:46] Let's do this copy link.

[00:49] Let's go to Facebook and get those clowns in here.

[00:53] Yeah.

[00:54] Who's doing a show right now?

[00:56] Let's bring in the heat.

[00:58] Canada.

[01:01] All the haters out there.

[01:04] Got nothing.

[01:05] Nothing.

[01:06] No views.

[01:07] No nothing.

[01:10] Let's talk pinball.

[01:14] Oh yeah.

[01:16] Let's get in this seat.

[01:19] Canada has got some arm.

[01:22] Let's get this mic over here a little bit.

[01:26] Oh yeah.

[01:27] Who we got in the house here?

[01:29] Who we got here?

[01:30] Who wants to talk some pinball today?

[01:32] I'm fighting a cold.

[01:34] It doesn't stop Canada from doing.

[01:36] I think the most entertaining pinball podcast there is.

[01:42] Maybe there ever will be the only one you can talk about these companies without his

[01:47] tail between his legs.

[01:49] I'm getting.

[01:50] We're going to talk about what we like about the games that came out this week.

[01:54] There were some winners.

[01:56] There were some losers.

[01:58] And there was like a lot of debate, a lot of conversation.

[02:02] But man, I'll tell you this.

[02:04] I'll tell you this.

[02:07] Nobody has the guts.

[02:10] The guy they want to say step.

[02:13] We're going to talk about everybody on this episode.

[02:16] Nobody is immune to what we're going to do on this Saturday morning.

[02:19] I'm feeling good.

[02:20] Well, I'm not feeling good.

[02:21] I'm sick.

[02:22] I'm feeling good because all you guys are here.

[02:25] Us.

[02:26] I don't know if it was Scotland, if it was all the whiskeys, the double jamos.

[02:31] But man, this is going to be a fun show.

[02:34] Well, everybody rock in a little bit.

[02:36] I want to thank the crew over at Spooky Pinball for sending me this shirt.

[02:42] Not just a spooky shield shirt, but man, in my color.

[02:48] And you want to talk about how a company should handle Canada.

[02:54] Take a look over at Spooky Pinball people.

[02:57] I'm not even chilling their product.

[02:58] They made a great game.

[03:00] You don't have to shield for Spooky.

[03:02] They're just in the driver's seat, man.

[03:05] They're running circles around some other company we're going to talk about.

[03:09] There's a lot of bad blood between the bad bloods only going one way.

[03:13] Trust me.

[03:15] Trust me.

[03:16] A lot of people want to get credit for stuff they didn't achieve yet.

[03:20] We're going to talk all about it, people, because I'm a little triggered.

[03:24] I'm a little triggered.

[03:25] I feel this pressure lately.

[03:27] You've got to say nice stuff about us because we worked hard.

[03:32] No, I don't.

[03:34] I don't.

[03:35] I don't have to congratulate you for working hard.

[03:39] I should congratulate you for how you execute it on your hard work.

[03:45] I've lost some friends over this past week.

[03:48] I'm going to talk about it because I think the whole thing is just quite comical.

[03:52] Quite comical.

[03:53] We're going to talk all about it.

[03:58] We're going to talk about the two games that came out obviously big week for Stern and

[04:02] Barrel's a fun.

[04:04] Some news on Pinball Brothers, whatever.

[04:07] Whatever.

[04:08] Whatever.

[04:09] It's like you hear the words Pinball Brothers and you could give to SHITSs until they

[04:14] prove themselves.

[04:15] I don't think anybody is clamoring to see what's next from Pinball Brothers.

[04:20] Even though they do have the best theme for the Pinball Buying Demographic.

[04:25] It's been a rough six weeks for me, but I'm finally post-Herniast surgery recovery period

[04:33] where I can actually go back to the gym.

[04:35] I went yesterday for the first time in six weeks.

[04:38] I've been a little cranky.

[04:39] I like to exercise.

[04:40] I lost some of my guns, but I'll get them back.

[04:44] I'll get them back, but I don't like to go a week without exercise.

[04:49] You might hear me cough a little bit.

[04:50] It's just because I've got a cold, but we're going to talk about everything.

[04:55] You didn't go to Stern and get on those banana flippers.

[04:59] Oh, man.

[05:00] I was invited to Stern Pinball.

[05:01] I was invited to Barrel's a fun pinball.

[05:03] I could not go last week.

[05:06] Something called worked.

[05:08] Real work.

[05:09] You know, both of these companies invited people in the middle of the work week.

[05:13] And I got to watch everybody's coverage of both games.

[05:17] I lived vicariously through all the individuals who went over there.

[05:23] We're going to do a little funny skit.

[05:24] I'm going to do a skit later today where I'm going to recreate Carrie Hardy's review of

[05:34] Doom Pinball.

[05:35] I don't know if you watched Carrie's video on Doom.

[05:38] I don't know if you've seen it yet, but maybe we got it early because we're Patreon subscribers.

[05:43] But I'm going to give you guys a parody, if you will, of Carrie Hardy's review of

[05:51] Doom Pinball.

[05:53] And it is absolutely spot on what I'm going to do.

[05:57] It's like it's like it's like painting him to try to say stuff like with some energy

[06:03] and enthusiasm.

[06:04] And you can see it's like that's the thing gang is when you go to these companies and

[06:11] you walk around the facilities, you definitely have a little bit of a conscious that you want

[06:19] to be nicer about everything happening.

[06:23] I didn't go.

[06:24] I didn't drink anybody's cool.

[06:26] I also don't care anymore.

[06:29] I think people understand by now, if you want to listen to the most entertaining pinball

[06:35] podcaster out there, you're going to come to Canadian pinball podcast.

[06:40] I mean, it just is.

[06:41] It's like every week, it's not like this negative place.

[06:44] Like it's so funny to me how like people don't understand.

[06:49] You don't do this for as many years as I've done this and have the most subscribers in

[06:53] the history of pinball podcasting because you're crapping on everything.

[06:58] So let's start out gang.

[07:01] Let's let you guys decide.

[07:02] Okay.

[07:03] Let's light a few more minutes people come in.

[07:06] But let's let's what's up Dana.

[07:09] How's everybody doing?

[07:10] Let's do this.

[07:11] I want to give a shout out to everybody who's here right now.

[07:14] Who do we got in the house right now?

[07:16] Let's do this.

[07:17] Let's spend the next couple of minutes.

[07:18] You say hi and I'm going to say hi back and call out your name.

[07:21] Now we've got like 80 people here.

[07:23] So I might not do all 80.

[07:25] Let's just say hi juicy time.

[07:27] What's up?

[07:28] What's up juicy time?

[07:30] Anthony, what's up brother?

[07:46] Chris Liu.

[07:48] Yo, yo call me.

[07:50] Chris, is this Chris Liu like down the block?

[07:52] Or is this a different like?

[07:54] We got Brad.

[07:56] We got Drew.

[07:57] We got Brian JPL.

[08:00] Connecticut in the house.

[08:03] Richard Pete Rosen.

[08:06] We got a good crew baby.

[08:07] We got a good crew.

[08:09] Where's Retro Ralph?

[08:11] Where is he?

[08:13] I was talking to him all last week.

[08:14] We got to get Retro Ralph in the house.

[08:16] He'll join.

[08:17] We got to get Carrie Hardy, Christopher Franchey.

[08:20] Keith is in the house.

[08:22] Arcade, Billy, Nick, what's up?

[08:25] Till pin.

[08:27] How you guys doing?

[08:28] You guys all subscribers?

[08:29] Con over, con overlord.

[08:32] Overlord.

[08:34] We're going to talk all about King Kong.

[08:35] I got a lot of feelings about King Kong.

[08:38] I got a lot of feelings about Doom Pimball.

[08:41] That's going to be the main things we talk about on this show.

[08:45] What's up Dennis?

[08:47] Where are you guys at?

[08:48] You guys at, isn't there a show this weekend?

[08:50] It's like Pimball at the zoo this weekend.

[08:53] Pimball at the zoo.

[08:54] Big gorilla.

[08:56] Keith L. Wins, Latest.

[08:58] All right, we'll let you guys decide.

[09:00] You want to talk about Doom or Kong first.

[09:04] I'll let you guys decide which way we go.

[09:08] Doom or King Kong.

[09:10] Where do you want Knai to start today?

[09:12] Because I got a lot of feelings with all of these games.

[09:16] And we're going to do it at the 10 minute.

[09:18] Let's give it another minute.

[09:24] All right, it's a pretty split here.

[09:27] Day one, seven.

[09:28] We're getting more for King Kong.

[09:31] We got one.

[09:32] I love when someone's like, con or Doom, and they're like, not,

[09:35] not Doom.

[09:37] OK, you guys want to talk about King Kong?

[09:41] All right, Kong it is.

[09:42] It's going to be Kong.

[09:43] So let me just collect my thoughts on King Kong.

[09:47] Because I've watched the whole stream again.

[09:52] It's interesting when you're watching a stream.

[09:54] I think I want to start out by saying this.

[09:56] When you watch a stream of a Pimball machine,

[09:59] it is not a natural way to really feel

[10:04] what it's like, obviously, to play the game.

[10:06] It's a physical game.

[10:07] It's also like, I think what's interesting

[10:09] about watching streams, because you've

[10:11] got all the windows up at the same time,

[10:15] is you're able to take in gameplay and what's on the screen,

[10:24] and a Mac, and the people playing all at once.

[10:29] And that's really kind of fun, but also really not

[10:33] authentic to what the experience of playing the game is like.

[10:37] So for example, when you're watching a stream,

[10:40] I do think a stream has a tendency

[10:43] to make the clips seem a lot more disjointed

[10:47] than it probably feels like when you're playing the game.

[10:51] So here's my feelings on Kong.

[10:54] And I have a lot of feelings on this game.

[10:57] I think, first and foremost, I want

[11:00] to go down what I like and love about King Kong.

[11:04] I want to start out with the things

[11:05] that I really like about this game.

[11:09] And I think there's been a lot of conversation around this game.

[11:12] But I think, first and foremost, the thing I like about King Kong

[11:18] is gameplay, right?

[11:21] Gameplay, gameplay, gameplay.

[11:24] This seems to be quite possibly, maybe, Keith L.

[11:30] Wins best shooting game today.

[11:34] It seemingly is also, and I think this is accurate.

[11:39] I think it's going to be his easiest game to date,

[11:43] which, by the way, I think will translate

[11:47] into being the most fun Keith L. Wins game ever

[11:52] for the pinball buying demographic.

[11:56] I think some of his other games, if you're honest with yourselves,

[12:02] are somewhat difficult.

[12:04] And I think Kong is going to be a lot easier,

[12:09] a lot easier for a lot of you to play.

[12:11] Is my audio clipping?

[12:13] Someone said the audio is clipping.

[12:14] Let me know.

[12:16] Because people sometimes say this, and it's not me.

[12:18] It's you.

[12:19] So how does the audio sound right now?

[12:26] Audio is fine.

[12:32] OK.

[12:33] So I think this is going to be one of the best shooting

[12:37] Keith L. Wins games to date.

[12:39] And I also, when I look at the gameplay,

[12:42] and I've been studying it, and I'm like, man,

[12:45] everyone's on the wrong side of the game.

[12:49] To me, where the magic lies in this game

[12:54] are the shots in the upper left.

[12:57] Like, when that ball's going in the upper left area of the game,

[13:02] and it's got the wire form shot that simulates

[13:06] airplane propeller going around.

[13:09] That is the greatest, I think, shot I'm seeing in this game.

[13:13] And I think there's so much, I think it's just me

[13:16] hitting my table here.

[13:18] I think there's so much fun combos happening in this game.

[13:23] And I think there's just so much rewarding shot geometry

[13:28] happening, and especially happening

[13:31] in the upper left region of the game.

[13:33] And I think there's a lot of focus on the gorilla

[13:35] and the train and the gong.

[13:37] But I don't think that's where the magic lies in this game.

[13:42] I think the magic lies in the other shots happening,

[13:46] moving towards the upper left.

[13:48] Now, that being said, the shots in this game,

[13:54] I don't, you know, it's hard to completely separate what I love

[13:59] when I don't love because also, I think,

[14:01] what's somewhat difficult is to see the shot geometry,

[14:07] you know, with the, what you're interrupting me?

[14:13] What's up?

[14:15] Can you run cash while you're away?

[14:18] Yeah, yeah.

[14:20] Hold on.

[14:21] Can't come in, kill.

[14:22] Say hi.

[14:24] Lean in.

[14:26] Hi.

[14:27] Hi.

[14:28] You want me to mine, Cassie, and why you're away?

[14:30] Where you guys going?

[14:32] OK, yeah, I'll hear it.

[14:33] I'll listen for it.

[14:35] All right.

[14:36] All right, buddy.

[14:37] I can't move it.

[14:40] I moved it.

[14:41] I've moved it.

[14:44] Daddy duty.

[14:46] That was two.

[14:48] OK, so the artwork makes it really hard

[14:55] to look down at the play field and see the shot layout.

[15:00] I'm going to get to the artwork.

[15:02] People, don't worry.

[15:02] I'm going to get to the artwork.

[15:04] It really makes it hard to sort of see where the balls are going.

[15:10] OK, but I think with, especially with the center post,

[15:14] I mean, they put a center post into a Keith Ellwyn game

[15:18] that doesn't even have a flipper gap.

[15:20] And the reason it's there is this game

[15:23] is paying homage to the Daddy East game, right?

[15:28] Same artist that did the play field on the Daddy East

[15:31] was brought over here.

[15:33] Is it Kevin Conner?

[15:34] I don't know.

[15:35] Is it Connor?

[15:36] O'Connor?

[15:37] Like, who?

[15:38] You guys help me out here.

[15:39] Who's the artist from the Daddy East game?

[15:42] But the Daddy East King Kong had a center post.

[15:47] So that is like Kevin O'Connor.

[15:50] OK, so that is why it is there.

[15:53] Now, that's absolutely going to make the ball

[15:56] times a little bit longer.

[15:58] So I think the game is definitely going

[16:01] to have some long ball times for people.

[16:05] Again, I think it's a good thing.

[16:06] I think Ellwyn's games in the past, especially Godzilla,

[16:09] like, it's hard.

[16:10] I think some of these games are too hard.

[16:12] And I think you're never going to get through them.

[16:15] And I think this is going to be probably most

[16:17] of the pinball buying demographics, most friendly Ellwyn

[16:21] game to date.

[16:23] And it's packed, right?

[16:26] All right, so I love the layout.

[16:28] All right.

[16:30] I love the music in the game.

[16:32] I heard people talk about this.

[16:33] No, the music's great.

[16:35] The music is great.

[16:36] It really has the right sort of atmospheric

[16:40] King Kong, the drums.

[16:42] Like, I love all that.

[16:44] Love it.

[16:45] Love it.

[16:45] Love it.

[16:46] I think the music is great.

[16:49] It is very cinematic, Joseph.

[16:51] Absolutely.

[16:53] OK, so I love that.

[16:54] What else do I love about this game?

[16:56] When it comes to the toys and mechs in this game,

[17:00] you know, like, I think they do the job.

[17:03] I don't think there's a toy or mech in this game that's

[17:06] that interesting.

[17:07] I absolutely don't.

[17:09] So I know that they put the subway car in last minute.

[17:13] And it does feel like it was put in there a little last minute.

[17:16] And I think Kong was supposed to hit the balls with his open hand.

[17:20] And they changed that up.

[17:22] I think that was probably just too random.

[17:24] And so now you have Kong's arms, you know,

[17:26] Aala, incredible Hulk.

[17:28] Kong's arms will now do something every time that is gameplay related.

[17:34] And I think that was probably a smart move.

[17:36] It does look like that subway car is blocked by the Gong mechanism.

[17:42] I don't know for those who have played it,

[17:44] you probably have a better sense of that.

[17:48] So I think the toys are all right.

[17:52] I don't see any toys do anything with the ball that's really unique.

[17:59] And I think on that level, it's a little bit of a letdown of the lack

[18:05] of mechanical magic in a toy.

[18:08] We saw more mechanical magic with the Godzilla building.

[18:12] We saw more mechanical magic with the Godzilla magnet,

[18:16] Captain Ball, that grabbed the ball.

[18:18] I'm not feeling any sort of toy magic happening here on the game.

[18:24] So I think that that's like, I don't know, right?

[18:29] It's like I think a lot of us were probably expecting a more magical mech.

[18:36] I think the dragon in D&D is much better, JPL.

[18:40] I also think the Sentinel in X-Men is much more wow.

[18:46] I think Godzilla's mechs are more wow.

[18:50] I think Jurassic Park T-Rex is much nicer.

[18:55] So from a toy standpoint, I think this game is a little bit of a miss.

[19:01] It's not bad, but it's not great.

[19:04] Coming off of jaws which has no interesting toys in it,

[19:08] I think Elwin has gone like over two since Godzilla

[19:12] in putting mechanical wow into the game.

[19:15] So that's just my opinion.

[19:18] You can take it or leave it.

[19:19] All right, what else do I like about the game?

[19:22] I like the Ellie translate I do.

[19:24] Someone, I think the Ellie translate with the damsel and distress

[19:29] who apparently, you know, Kong can't save her according to the licenseors.

[19:34] That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

[19:36] Everybody would be in distress and need saving if King Kong

[19:40] was trying to come after you.

[19:42] And that's the whole Kong storyline.

[19:44] Is he falls in love with the blonde and he's saving her

[19:50] from the airplanes and from the humans that are trying to kill him.

[19:53] So the fact that they didn't, I'm going to talk about that

[19:57] and what I don't like about this game.

[19:59] All right, so what else do I like about this game?

[20:02] I do think the, you know, this is kind of like,

[20:05] I'd like some of it.

[20:07] I don't like other parts of it.

[20:08] I really, I really like the, some of the animations.

[20:14] I think some of the animations are absolutely stellar and killer.

[20:18] I think other ones are mediocre and weird to me.

[20:22] I don't know what Stern's doing in their animation department.

[20:25] It definitely feels like they're using,

[20:28] I bet they're using some AI to generate some of this stuff

[20:33] graphically.

[20:34] And it's just, there's a lack of consistency

[20:37] in the actual animations themselves.

[20:42] Let me see if I can pull this up.

[20:44] I downloaded, let me see if I can pull up screenshots.

[20:48] Because I was taking screenshots.

[20:51] I'm not going to do it now.

[20:52] But basically, like there's some moments in the animations

[20:56] where Kong looks much more illustrated and cartoonish.

[21:01] And then others where he looks more like CGI looking,

[21:05] more kind of like 90s video game looking.

[21:08] And there's not a lot of consistent,

[21:11] it's not all consistent.

[21:13] So I think some of it is just good.

[21:15] Some of it is bad.

[21:17] And I know the code is early on.

[21:20] So, you know, there's that.

[21:23] All right, so like, as a theme, I also like King Kong.

[21:26] You know, I do think like it's a good theme for Pimble.

[21:30] But, you know, OK.

[21:32] So what don't I like about King Kong?

[21:36] Or what would I have changed?

[21:38] Well, obviously, I would have liked

[21:39] there have been an Empire State Building mechanism

[21:43] and seeing Kong climate would have been epic.

[21:47] Like he should have swung around.

[21:49] And the plane should have gone around the top of the Empire

[21:52] State Building.

[21:52] Maybe that's going to be the top.

[21:54] But in my honest opinion, a total miss there, a total miss.

[21:59] I just, sorry.

[22:03] I also would have liked them to have done.

[22:07] One side of the play field is the city and one side the jungle.

[22:12] I really thought it could have been super cool

[22:15] to sort of create the two iconic environments

[22:20] that Kong ends up in and almost like split the play field

[22:24] with one side being city, one side being jungle.

[22:27] I thought that would have been a really cool thing to do.

[22:30] Instead, it's kind of just all mashed together.

[22:34] And that's probably one of my biggest sort of like,

[22:38] I don't know if it's like complaints,

[22:39] but things I'm just not biving with is like,

[22:41] as I watched the stream of this game,

[22:43] I was watching like a three minute gameplay of Kong.

[22:48] And I was watching the clips that were coming up.

[22:51] And it was going from dudes in a boat

[22:55] like going through the jungle.

[22:56] Then right away, there's a clip of Kong climbing a building.

[23:00] Then right away, there's Kong shaking a log, knocking off sailors.

[23:05] Then right away, it's King Kong battling a lizard or a spider.

[23:09] Like all this is just happening at once.

[23:12] And so like, as I was watching that,

[23:15] I'm like, I don't like this.

[23:17] Like, I don't know what's going on.

[23:19] Like, why is this game all over the place?

[23:22] And it's like so schizophrenic.

[23:24] Like, I don't even understand.

[23:26] And then I asked someone like,

[23:27] who are you playing in this game?

[23:30] Because I do think a game's code and narrative and storyline

[23:35] are super important in keeping you coming back for more.

[23:38] And someone said, you're playing as the damsel in distress,

[23:44] but she's not in distress.

[23:45] You're playing as the woman in this storyline.

[23:49] So when I saw that, I was like, wait, what?

[23:53] How does that even make sense?

[23:55] Because think about it.

[23:56] If you're playing as the female character in King Kong,

[24:01] then how does that make sense?

[24:04] Because, okay, so for example, there's a mode

[24:06] where you got to get the sailors across the log

[24:09] as Kong is shaking the log.

[24:12] And how does that make sense?

[24:14] So who do you play as King Kong?

[24:16] Or someone just pulling my chain?

[24:17] Because I heard and they someone said in an interview

[24:19] that Keith did that you were playing as the woman.

[24:25] So I just don't understand how that makes sense.

[24:30] And I'm not sure who you're playing as.

[24:31] See in Godzilla, you're playing as Godzilla.

[24:36] And so like everything in that game is connected

[24:39] to you being Godzilla.

[24:42] So in King Kong, I feel like it's kind of all over the place.

[24:48] And nothing about the modes really makes sense

[24:52] if you're the woman in the storyline.

[24:56] Okay, so I don't like that.

[24:59] I think it's disjointed.

[25:01] And I think it's just like, I think it's going to grow

[25:05] old, maybe old a little fast.

[25:07] Like I do.

[25:09] You know, because again, like you're not clicking with

[25:12] a movie or movies or assets that you really like.

[25:16] Okay, and I'm just going to come out and say it.

[25:17] I don't like that this game does not pull

[25:21] from any of the iconic Kong movies.

[25:23] I don't, you know, I don't know how you go from Godzilla

[25:27] and get everything to King Kong and get nothing

[25:31] and charge $3,000 more for King Kong.

[25:36] So just on a very basic level,

[25:39] how did you make Godzilla for 10, 5 for an LE

[25:44] and you're making King Kong for 13

[25:46] and you had a license, no assets.

[25:51] So like, that's it.

[25:54] Like in a lot of ways, it's like a hard stop.

[25:58] Like that doesn't make any sense to me.

[26:00] You know, and again, like I know Stern's paying their

[26:03] animated animated, animated department and whatnot.

[26:06] But like, okay, but you can't tell me that like if you're a fan

[26:11] of King Kong and you jump on this machine,

[26:12] it just feels like you're playing a Netflix animated

[26:17] King Kong cartoon show.

[26:19] And there is one.

[26:20] There's like a Skull Island Netflix Kong show

[26:23] that looks a little bit more like an anime.

[26:26] That's what this game feels like.

[26:29] And again, so what I think is gonna happen is this.

[26:33] I think the gameplay is gonna be there.

[26:37] The like, you know, the L win, the rewarding shots

[26:40] are gonna be there.

[26:42] But I do think it's gonna get old.

[26:46] It's gonna get old playing this animated Kong.

[26:50] I just think it's gonna get old and tiresome.

[26:54] I mean, they're really gonna have to work hard

[26:56] to make the modes like Super Special

[26:58] and get you to connect with the game.

[27:01] But I do worry about the fact that the assets

[27:04] not being there are gonna over time, you know,

[27:08] make this game feel more like Avengers, right?

[27:11] Cause remember, like Avengers wasn't the Avengers movie.

[27:14] It was like this animated Avengers game

[27:18] and same thing with King Kong.

[27:21] So, you know, so that's something that time will tell on.

[27:24] And nobody here knows it, right?

[27:25] You know, this isn't a people like it's,

[27:27] it was funny to me, people going to Stern.

[27:29] They're like, after one ball, I knew this was a better game

[27:32] than like, what?

[27:34] You played one ball.

[27:36] And I don't think anybody who played this game

[27:40] during a honeymoon period while they were at Stern Pinball

[27:45] really knows what it's gonna feel like

[27:48] playing this game for a month.

[27:50] So that's just like, you know, the other thing too is,

[27:53] I don't know, Godzilla gave so much that I'm just not short.

[27:57] Jaws gave so much and Jaws has such a campaignist.

[28:01] Though, you know, my favorite part of watching the Kong Stream

[28:05] is like the beginning, you know,

[28:07] they got that like black and white film reel.

[28:10] I feel like they should have done it all that way.

[28:13] There's something about this game

[28:15] when it gets to that like,

[28:17] gray scale, black and white, old film reel,

[28:21] we're in the jungle, you know,

[28:22] like the vibe of the early movies.

[28:26] That's what they should have made this game.

[28:29] That feels really cong to me.

[28:34] And it feels like the, you know,

[28:36] the 1930s, 40s, like film reel of like a mysterious creature

[28:42] on an island in the middle of the Pacific, you know,

[28:46] and I just don't get that when I look down

[28:50] at the thing that I don't like the most,

[28:53] which is the play field artwork.

[28:55] And I don't care what anybody says.

[28:58] This play field artwork looks like a clown

[29:02] vomited all over it.

[29:05] And I don't care if you're Kevin O'Connor, Greg Ferris,

[29:10] Jeremy Packer, guys, look at this play field.

[29:15] It looks like Kaneda's wardrobe.

[29:19] It looks like Elvira did a line of Coke

[29:22] and then shot some acid.

[29:25] Like it's so bad.

[29:28] Like it's so bad, it's laughable.

[29:31] And by that, it's so busy and cluttered

[29:36] and like an explosion of all different colors

[29:40] fighting for your attention.

[29:42] It's terrible.

[29:44] Okay, and I don't need to go see it in person.

[29:47] I don't need to do anything other than look at the damn thing.

[29:52] Okay, the amount of inserts in this game,

[29:54] it's great Ferris, man.

[29:55] Like look at Greg's Elvira.

[29:58] Like look at Elvira.

[29:59] Like it's just this explosion of inserts.

[30:02] And it is maybe a more of a 90s way to do a game

[30:06] when you didn't have screens.

[30:12] Let me go get a glass of water again,

[30:13] because I'm like, I'm not gonna be able to make it

[30:16] through my dune if I don't get some liquid hold on.

[30:19] Give me one second.

[30:23] Dude, you like this beautiful,

[30:24] this is an arm war, by the way.

[30:26] I got this for Brenda.

[30:28] 1920s arm war.

[30:37] Super cool.

[30:40] Great artist, let me see.

[31:52] Something in this bathroom,

[31:54] this is the first name I've seen.

[32:00] Who knows.

[32:02] Yeahč.

[32:07] Man, he's like the viral infection's all the worse.

[32:09] They don't go away.

[32:10] He heads up inionics and like open out.

[32:12] All right, where are we?

[32:25] The clutter on the play field.

[32:29] All right.

[32:31] Again, it's like fighting and fighting for you.

[32:37] All right, so here's the deal.

[32:39] The artwork is on the play field is terrible.

[32:43] Sorry, guys.

[32:49] The artwork on the play field, it's bad.

[32:51] The cabinet artwork, I don't have an issue with.

[32:53] It's yet, of course, he's going to do a great job.

[32:56] But here's my thing.

[32:57] It's like, did you notice how Stern is using the same artwork

[33:03] on the cabinets for all three models?

[33:07] When I saw that, I was like, oh,

[33:09] I was like, what's happening here?

[33:12] Like, sorry, but now you're rushing,

[33:15] you're rushing your model of how you do three tiered model

[33:18] artwork.

[33:20] And so you're buying a con-LE that doesn't have

[33:24] unique cabinet artwork.

[33:26] That's lazy.

[33:28] And when it comes to this game, from what I've heard,

[33:32] people who have played it, I feel like it's

[33:34] like the pros the way to go.

[33:36] You're not missing much with the moving con

[33:40] and everything else and the gong and the subway car.

[33:43] So I don't think these LE is gang.

[33:48] I think, look, they'll get, it's going to pass.

[33:53] It's going to pass.

[33:55] They'll get sold through.

[33:57] And they probably will eventually sell out.

[34:02] But I'm telling you right now,

[34:06] this is not going to be like the fact

[34:10] that the LE art is on the free-con premium.

[34:14] You know what I'm saying?

[34:15] So then what?

[34:15] It's just your translate, it's different.

[34:17] And you know someone's going to probably just make a copy

[34:20] of it.

[34:21] It's so easy to do that.

[34:23] I don't know.

[34:24] I just think that there's not enough to warrant

[34:27] the LE of this game.

[34:30] It just doesn't feel special.

[34:31] I think the LEs are dead.

[34:33] I think LE is in general, are dead.

[34:37] And I think Stern's LE model is like over.

[34:40] And everyone who's bought in LE recently

[34:42] just keeps losing money.

[34:47] The LE model only worked when your games went up in value.

[34:51] Now it just doesn't make any sense.

[34:53] You're going to be able to throw replacement armor

[34:55] on the premium and it'll look exactly the same.

[34:57] So overall, here's my thing.

[35:01] I think Kong is going to be a very celebrated game.

[35:05] I think the gameplay is going to be phenomenal.

[35:08] I think the artwork is on the play field.

[35:11] It's atrocious.

[35:12] I think the LEs are not going to be like coveted

[35:16] like people think.

[35:17] So if you bought an LE, I'm happy for you.

[35:19] I think these LEs will be 10 grand easily.

[35:23] This is not going to be, oh, you have a Kong LE.

[35:26] I wish I got an LE.

[35:27] It's not going to be that 9.32 is way too many.

[35:31] They should have made only 500 LEs of Kong 9.32s way too many.

[35:36] They're going to be out there and about for a long time.

[35:40] And look, I think in the end, it feels like another storm,

[35:48] which isn't a bad thing.

[35:50] It feels like there's a little fatigue happening here

[35:54] with the Elwin Yeti vibe of how stern games are looking.

[35:59] There's just a little fatigue.

[36:02] I think people want stern to take a little bit more of a risk.

[36:07] I think people are looking to stern to mix it up

[36:11] and let the theme dictate the way the game should look.

[36:14] I don't know how you went from that daddy-ease game

[36:17] to this clown puke color scheme.

[36:20] Like, I'm sorry guys.

[36:22] I don't know any other way to put it.

[36:26] You made a great color scheme if it was Canada's wardrobe,

[36:28] but it just doesn't work.

[36:31] Like, this doesn't, I don't know if this is like,

[36:33] it doesn't feel like a jungle

[36:34] and it doesn't feel like a city landscape.

[36:37] And they would have been much better off,

[36:39] I think, making the art package look more jungle-like

[36:43] and old school New York City.

[36:47] OK.

[36:47] Well, Yeti's got to be careful, gang.

[36:59] Now that he's like the art director at Stern,

[37:01] he's just got to be careful that part of his job

[37:05] is to make sure you match up the right artist with the assignment

[37:09] and don't just make it your style on everything.

[37:12] It just doesn't work that way.

[37:14] I mean, you can do it.

[37:16] But I do think real fatigue is starting to set in.

[37:20] And I think the fatigue is real.

[37:22] Now, but I'm not upset about King Kong.

[37:26] I think King Kong looks like a lot of fun.

[37:28] I just feel no desire to buy one.

[37:31] I think it's going to be a great game on location.

[37:34] The lack of assets, the lack of connecting

[37:37] with the source material is the main reason why I wouldn't buy one.

[37:41] I think jaws gave jaws, lovers, everything and more

[37:44] what they wanted in a game.

[37:46] You know, yeah, you didn't get the shark eating the ball,

[37:48] but you got the movie, man, that you love.

[37:51] And I think same thing with Godzilla,

[37:53] you got everything you loved about that franchise.

[37:55] I think if you love King Kong, you're not getting everything

[37:59] you love about the franchise.

[38:01] You're just not.

[38:03] OK.

[38:03] I think that's a fair take on it all.

[38:06] I don't think that's too negative.

[38:10] I don't think that's a controversial take on it.

[38:16] And I think that's that.

[38:23] Zombie Yeti needs to go on a sabbatical.

[38:25] No, it's just starting to feel like Stern is now marble.

[38:34] And they're just launching comic books.

[38:36] And every comic book looks similar.

[38:39] I think that's the, I'll say this.

[38:43] I'll play devil's advocate.

[38:45] They seem to be pretty successful at it.

[38:48] So it's like if the sales are there, the sales are there.

[38:52] So and I saw a picture of Kong next to Godzilla

[38:55] and they look really good next to each other.

[38:57] So in the end, King Kong, I don't think it blew us away.

[39:02] I don't like it didn't sell out.

[39:05] Again, you got to remember a Keith Owen game, not selling out

[39:07] the LE in a week.

[39:10] That's like, that's the state of modern Pimball now, gang.

[39:14] I think a lot of people are just tired of running at this stuff.

[39:17] And there's no FOMO around King Kong.

[39:20] I don't think anybody has FOMO here.

[39:23] I think this is a game where you're

[39:27] going to be happy with the pro.

[39:28] And you're going to be happy with the premium.

[39:30] I just don't think there's any FOMO whatsoever.

[39:34] All right.

[39:34] So let's talk about Dune now.

[39:37] Because I definitely think King Kong won last week by a wide margin.

[39:42] I think Kong had the better launch.

[39:45] I think games are on the line.

[39:47] I think everything they did was like what they wanted to do.

[39:51] Like King Kong was launched the way Stern wanted to launch King Kong.

[39:56] They don't have any regrets.

[39:58] They didn't fumble on the goal line.

[40:03] They launched their game the way they wanted to.

[40:07] Barrel's a fun, completely different story.

[40:10] And I'm really going to talk about these guys right now.

[40:16] And I'm going to talk in a way that's not angry.

[40:22] I don't really know.

[40:23] I know David a little bit.

[40:25] I know Blake really well for years.

[40:28] I know they're upset with me.

[40:30] And I know that they're disappointed in me and in my coverage of their company.

[40:36] And I know that they feel that I've slammed them inappropriately on my coverage of how

[40:43] they launched this game.

[40:46] And I've been very critical about how this game was brought to market.

[40:52] I've been very critical of the theme.

[40:55] I've been very critical of I'm going to be very critical on this show.

[41:02] And I'm going to explain why.

[41:05] Because I think that there's a lot of desire by the crew over at Barrel's a fun to get

[41:14] a lot of credit because of what they've done in their inaugural game.

[41:20] And I get it.

[41:21] They've made them credit for launching a pinball company, making around a thousand games

[41:26] in a year.

[41:28] Nobody got ripped off.

[41:29] Nobody was lied to.

[41:32] Nobody was so that they did what they did what they set out to do.

[41:39] And I've always believed that a company's soft more effort, especially now when there's

[41:45] so much competition, is really important.

[41:50] And these guys are not new.

[41:51] None of them are new.

[41:52] Everybody connected to Barrel's a fun is not new to pinball.

[41:58] They've been around the block many times.

[42:00] They have a lot of friends in the community.

[42:02] They've seen pinball launches, a year after year after year.

[42:07] They've witnessed it all.

[42:08] And they sort of had a lot of fun with how they tease their company at the very beginning.

[42:15] They had a year long teaser campaign.

[42:19] And now I want to evaluate how they launched their soft more game.

[42:25] I want to talk about what I've seen on this game.

[42:29] Maybe I'll do my carry hearty parody, which I think it will be funny.

[42:32] I'm going to do it.

[42:33] It's like painting carry to be excited about this game.

[42:36] You can see it.

[42:37] You can see it.

[42:39] And I just want to start off by saying, if you're David and Brian and Blake and you're

[42:47] mad at me.

[42:48] I just want to say this game.

[42:51] You guys selected this theme.

[42:55] Like I just want to start there.

[42:58] You guys selected a theme that is a huge, huge, huge risk.

[43:07] I mean, you picked a theme that is based on a new, doomed franchise that doesn't have

[43:18] any nostalgia for the pinball buying demographic.

[43:22] You picked a theme that people don't really want.

[43:29] And every time I've done a survey and every time I've done a questionnaire of people all

[43:38] throughout the pinball community.

[43:39] And I put your title into a listicle of what titles would you like to see?

[43:47] Even hardly gets any votes.

[43:50] So right off the bat, I don't really think there would be any, any, any, any ill will

[44:00] between you guys and me and me and you and how it launched.

[44:05] If you picked a theme, people really want it.

[44:08] Nothing would matter.

[44:10] Nothing would matter.

[44:11] You could fumble the launch to Kingdom Come.

[44:13] It doesn't matter.

[44:14] Such pinball could have the worst launch ever back to the future and they would still sell

[44:19] out on day one of like there are a lot of myths.

[44:22] So you guys picked the theme, right?

[44:25] And again, everybody knew it was doomed.

[44:29] Everybody knew it was doomed.

[44:30] And I was screaming from the high heavens that if you guys have doomed, don't do what

[44:37] I think you're going to do.

[44:39] Don't keep it a secret until the very last minute and then reveal it's doomed because

[44:48] all it's going to do is make everybody who was hoping it wasn't doomed.

[44:54] It's going to make them see it with wishing it was something else.

[45:01] But they didn't listen to me.

[45:02] You know, there's people saying like, can you should have called them up and offered

[45:06] the help?

[45:07] I did.

[45:08] I just should have gave them some of these.

[45:09] I did.

[45:10] You know, so when you want to like try and indict me for my reaction to their launch yet because

[45:17] I tried to help my friends over there.

[45:20] They didn't listen to anything I said.

[45:24] And then they, and then they like apparently just had this date April 15th set for why.

[45:34] And just so happened to be the same day Stern Pimball was going to release Keith L.

[45:41] Wins new game.

[45:43] So what do you do?

[45:44] Your Brian Savage, Blake, David Van S.

[45:48] What do you do?

[45:50] Do you just keep going forward with your plan or do you pivot?

[45:57] You know, you know what happens in my industry?

[46:00] Any industry of marketing.

[46:01] Because you know, it's like when something happens that you didn't expect, you got to change

[46:07] your plan.

[46:09] You got to change your marketing strategy.

[46:12] They didn't do that.

[46:14] They didn't change any of it.

[46:15] They just operate it as if Keith L. Wins new game wasn't coming out or they knew it and

[46:23] they just were content dropping their game right on top of a Keith L. Wins game.

[46:30] Okay.

[46:31] Okay.

[46:32] So, so I just want to start because this is going to be a very intellectual, I hope, very

[46:40] thought out and I think a very fair assessment of this game's launch.

[46:47] And I'm not angry with these gentlemen.

[46:50] I hope they're not angry with me.

[46:51] I just, this is my observation of how they launch this game.

[46:57] Okay.

[46:58] So they didn't pivot.

[47:02] They went up against an 800 pound gorilla and they got, and they lost, they got, they

[47:06] completely got lost.

[47:09] There was none of the content coming out last week.

[47:12] You know, nobody was, you know, nobody was clamoring to share doing content and nor could

[47:17] they really, and we'll get to that.

[47:19] Okay.

[47:21] So you got your launch plans.

[47:25] What were they?

[47:27] What were they?

[47:28] What were the launch plans?

[47:31] Because you launched a game.

[47:33] So here's the thing and I know they're going to listen to this.

[47:37] This company has been, you know, every time I talk to David personally, he said, Chris,

[47:43] we don't want to launch a game until it's on the line and it's going into a box.

[47:48] I don't want to reveal the game until that day is here.

[47:53] Cool.

[47:54] That's like his hill to die on.

[47:55] It's like he wants to so badly be known for that.

[48:00] Fine.

[48:01] I'm not going to, his company, he can pick what battles he wants to win.

[48:05] He can pick what legacy he wants people to think.

[48:08] Fine.

[48:09] Did he do that?

[48:10] Did he do that?

[48:12] Did he launch the game when this game is on the line being made, going in boxes this

[48:18] week, going to customers?

[48:20] No, he didn't.

[48:21] No, he didn't.

[48:22] They're going to make two games and then send them out to operators, two.

[48:28] Two.

[48:29] How are two games?

[48:31] What are they going to do for you?

[48:33] How could that possibly help you get any sales anywhere?

[48:36] Two games are going to go out into the world.

[48:39] And the statement now is they're building games, but they're not going to ship those

[48:46] games being built just yet because they're going to go through rigorous testing.

[48:52] What does that mean?

[48:54] What does that mean?

[48:57] Was the game not rigorously tested the last year?

[49:01] I don't understand.

[49:03] So you're going to build consumer games and then rigorously test them?

[49:10] How?

[49:11] Are you going to put five-interplays on consumer?

[49:14] No, you're not.

[49:15] I don't understand what that means.

[49:17] But what I'm thinking it means is that games aren't shipping the customers right away.

[49:24] That's what I think he's saying.

[49:25] But they still want to get credit for we launched and revealed the game when games were on

[49:31] the line and going in a box.

[49:34] You know what I'm saying?

[49:35] It's like sure, kind of, but not really.

[49:39] And it's confusing to me because you didn't have to do that.

[49:46] Because what happened is, and everybody knows this, is you launched your game too early.

[49:54] It's not ready to be shown.

[49:57] There's zero movie clips in the game right now that are waiting licensure approval.

[50:05] So why would you show up your game to the world for the first time without having a great

[50:13] first impression?

[50:16] And so when people are trying to show gameplay, it's empty.

[50:22] There's no callouts.

[50:23] There's no clips.

[50:25] There's like, and that's what I said.

[50:27] And I don't know if these guys are even still Patreon subscribers.

[50:30] I don't even want to evaluate the game because it's so early.

[50:34] It's so, it's just so early, it never should have been.

[50:40] It never should have been launched.

[50:43] And so like, all of what David wanted to do, this is why I'm like, what was the plan?

[50:49] Was the plan to launch a game with like incomplete code to a level where there's no clips in

[50:56] it?

[50:57] Why would that make people want to order it?

[51:02] So like, I don't know what the future holds for the code in this game, but I know as of

[51:07] today, it just feels completely incomplete.

[51:15] And so like, then you have Carrie Hardy on his way over there.

[51:20] And by the time he even gets through the door, the game leaked, like all like everything

[51:26] went out hazardly on a Monday night and all of your launch plans were spoiled.

[51:34] I don't know who did the leak.

[51:35] I mean, there's a lot of people that were like, I don't know, all I know is I woke up,

[51:40] I woke up, I didn't wake up, I was up.

[51:44] All I know is like Monday night, all of a sudden, I'm like, I'm watching a dude trailer

[51:51] and I'm seeing everything on Naps Arcade.

[51:55] And I'm like, all right, cool, like I know this wasn't the plan.

[51:59] And I know that everybody traveling there must be pissed off now because they didn't get

[52:03] the exclusive first look and they didn't get a chance to make their content.

[52:07] And by the time they made their content, everything had already been spoiled.

[52:14] So like, well, then don't send a distributor the damn video.

[52:18] Why would you do that?

[52:20] You know, for a company that was so good for so long and preventing any leaks, why would

[52:26] you shoot your foot off at the very moment you need it to, you know, to succeed?

[52:37] So, so that's, so that's kind of like where I'm at with this game.

[52:47] I think the sandworm is really cool.

[52:50] Really cool.

[52:52] You know, I'm not sure like if it's how it will feel over like multiple like that hundreds

[52:58] of plays, but it's probably one of the coolest engineered mechs I've seen in a long time.

[53:04] But it's also a dude mech.

[53:09] And most people don't want to do.

[53:12] And so I don't know what to tell you.

[53:15] And every time I talk to David Van S about theme, he kind of talks to me like like I, you

[53:22] know, he didn't do any market research.

[53:25] So why is that a toxic thing?

[53:29] For me to say that a company should be doing market research because all those men and

[53:34] women who work at barrels and all the distributors who need to sell your product and all the

[53:42] legacy you're trying to build with your brand is going to come down to the themes you select.

[53:48] And if you didn't do any market research, then all I can say is, so then you're just going

[53:52] off of your gut.

[53:54] What you think would sell.

[53:55] I never in a million years would have picked the modern do movies as where I would go next.

[54:01] You know, he did labyrinth.

[54:03] He has a relationship with Henson and people, right?

[54:06] He should have made them muppets.

[54:08] You would have sold more muppets than do.

[54:13] So I don't know.

[54:14] I just want to ask you guys, you've just heard my, my feelings on this launch.

[54:18] And do you think I'm being unfair?

[54:21] Do you think I'm being too negative?

[54:25] Do you think there's anything I've just said that like you disagree with?

[54:30] Because from where I'm standing or sitting, I want these guys to succeed.

[54:35] I just think they're making major mistakes at the very beginning.

[54:40] And then they're like, and then they want to like be mad at me.

[54:47] You know, I get these text messages about, you know, they're like personal nature text

[54:51] messages from David Van S.

[54:53] Like, you know, saying how I'm unfairly slamming his company.

[55:02] And I don't think I'm anything I've said about them has been unfair.

[55:08] I think they want a lot of credit.

[55:11] And I think they need to earn it.

[55:14] And I think it's just that simple.

[55:17] Yeah, I think everybody's going to wait to play the game.

[55:27] But it's just, if you're David Van S and you're watching spooky sell 888 evil debts,

[55:41] and you spent way more money on Dune, you're not going to sell 888 Dune machines, not

[55:49] at 116 plus accessories.

[55:52] That's the other thing.

[55:54] You know, the communication out of the company for the last like month or so was like,

[55:57] we're the best bang for the buck and pinball.

[56:00] Right?

[56:01] We're the best bang for the buck.

[56:03] Well, you don't get to say that we do.

[56:07] And if you add up the topper and the shooter rod and the scopes on the slings, you're $13,000

[56:16] game.

[56:17] How is that the best bang for the buck and pinball?

[56:20] A $13,000 game.

[56:25] The best bang for the buck and pinball is a Stern Pro.

[56:29] Absolutely, without a doubt.

[56:32] How is a Stern Pro not the best bang for buck and pinball?

[56:38] So I think there's this like, again, there's like this desire to get credit and to just

[56:49] say hyperbolic things about your efforts.

[56:52] You know, I was reading an AppSarcade, did a story about, I guess they didn't interview

[56:58] with loser kid, right?

[57:00] And they said something that made me laugh.

[57:02] So they said that they have a, they're just, sorry, it's hard for me to like talk with

[57:11] my cough, but they said something like, oh, we're just a couple years into our 10 year

[57:15] plan.

[57:17] What?

[57:18] Like, you have a 10 year plan.

[57:22] What does that mean?

[57:23] I wouldn't like, are you talking to investors or are you talking to a pinball community?

[57:28] So what is that?

[57:29] You know, again, like the marketer and me is like, I wouldn't have said that.

[57:33] Why do you want to talk about a 10 year plan?

[57:35] All you're making me, I know what you're, I know why you're saying it.

[57:40] You're trying to say you're going to be in it for the long haul.

[57:43] You're trying to say like, this is just the beginning, but all that does when you say

[57:48] something like that is it makes people think about the future and not the year and the

[57:52] now.

[57:54] And you need to get people to buy your game in the year and the now.

[57:57] Once you start talking about 10 year plans, then I'm starting to like wonder, well, maybe

[58:01] I should just wait.

[58:03] If these guys are going to be around for 10 years, then it might as well wait until they

[58:06] make a theme that's much more to my liking than this.

[58:10] Do you hear spooky pinball talk about a 10 year plan?

[58:13] You know, you know what you hear spooky pinball talk about?

[58:17] You know what spooky pinball says?

[58:19] We can't wait to you see our next three titles.

[58:22] It's only going to get better from here.

[58:24] Beetle chooses next people.

[58:27] Spooky pinball knows that it's next three themes are going to be like OMG, OMG, OMG.

[58:33] They are so excited for us to see what's next around the corner.

[58:37] When I talk to David about what themes are next, he doesn't say it.

[58:40] He doesn't talk like that.

[58:42] He says stuff like well, you know, some people are going to like him, some people aren't.

[58:44] I don't want to hear that.

[58:47] I don't want to hear that.

[58:50] And so, you know, there's been a lot of, there's been a few people that think that like,

[58:56] oh, I'm not, you know, like, Kaneda's negative.

[58:59] He's toxic.

[59:00] He's this.

[59:01] He's that.

[59:02] I don't think anything I just said is inaccurate.

[59:06] I think, you know, there's a bunch of man children who cheerlead everything in this hobby

[59:10] and it gets boring listening to people like that.

[59:14] And that's why they don't have many views and that's why they don't have any subscribers

[59:17] because they say the same thing about every company.

[59:20] They're like cheerleading every company and I'm not, I'm not, gang, I'm trying to help

[59:23] these guys.

[59:24] But I can't help you if you don't do market research.

[59:29] You know, I can't help you if you don't listen to a word I say about how I would launch

[59:38] on April 15th.

[59:40] I can't help you if you want to release your game early and you don't have the assets

[59:46] ready.

[59:47] You don't release early that.

[59:49] If you didn't have those assets ready to go, you don't launch on April 15th.

[59:54] And that would have just helped you out because here's what I would have done if I was

[59:58] David Van S.

[59:59] All right, just start making games, bro.

[01:00:03] Just what date are you going to be able to show assets?

[01:00:07] So okay, so let's just say like the license is not going to approve our assets until the

[01:00:12] end of May.

[01:00:13] All right.

[01:00:15] All right, I would just make games and not launch it until the end of May.

[01:00:22] Here's what it just feels like happened.

[01:00:24] It's like they need it the money or something.

[01:00:26] It's like they needed the capital to come in.

[01:00:28] They needed to get non-refundable deposits in to pay the people to make these games

[01:00:33] because labor and sales are done.

[01:00:37] And I think they learn how hard it is when game 2 is not ready at the right time when

[01:00:43] game 1 demand is over because it seemingly feels like they needed to make all like what

[01:00:51] is it 1100 or 1200 labyrinths.

[01:00:53] I feel like they need it.

[01:00:56] Their plan was to sell all of those.

[01:00:58] So they overestimated the demand for labyrinth.

[01:01:04] They once again are overestimating the demand I think for doom.

[01:01:08] And what that is going to do is it's not going to line up with your 10 year plan because

[01:01:14] they seem like they need to like, you know what I'm saying?

[01:01:18] They need to be making labyrinths for another few months, but the demand wasn't there.

[01:01:24] And so that's why they had a rush to do now because they couldn't keep their line stagnant.

[01:01:30] Right?

[01:01:31] They've got employees.

[01:01:32] They've got to come in every day and do something and make something or we're losing a lot more

[01:01:37] money.

[01:01:38] And that's what sinks to Pimbal Company.

[01:01:41] Are those idle days?

[01:01:42] Because you can't survive idle days as a manufacturer.

[01:01:47] The reason J.J. Pican have idle days is because they have a billionaire backing them.

[01:01:52] The reason American Pimbal had idle days is Amtron was backing them.

[01:01:56] But the problem they face over at barrels is they can't afford idle days because the

[01:02:01] burn is so significant.

[01:02:04] You know, it's why people don't realize like Alice's adventures in Wonderland save Dutch

[01:02:08] Pimbal because back to the future was not ready.

[01:02:14] And if Alice wasn't ready to go, there'd be nothing for all those people working at

[01:02:19] Dutch to make until back to the future was ready.

[01:02:22] So if Melvin didn't make Alice, Dutch Pimbal goes out of business.

[01:02:27] They would have closed shop.

[01:02:29] Even if they had the back to the future license, they would have closed shop.

[01:02:35] So all of this is, I'm just curious.

[01:02:41] Like, are you are you jiving with what I'm saying?

[01:02:45] Does this make you want to cancel your subscription of Canadian Pimbal podcast?

[01:02:49] Or is this a place where we're kind of we're kind of having a real, real conversation

[01:02:54] about Pimbal?

[01:02:57] I love Pimbal.

[01:02:58] I love what a lot of these companies are doing.

[01:03:02] You know, I think anyone who gets King Kong is going to have a good time.

[01:03:07] I want to read your commentary because I just I don't know.

[01:03:09] I feel like certain people just, you know, they get mad when you talk like this.

[01:03:21] The other thing concerning me, did you read this in the NAPS Arcade interview or the

[01:03:25] interview at loser kid that NAPS reported on?

[01:03:28] Is that barrels of fun is going to absorb the space next to them because that company

[01:03:33] is is went away and they're going to expand their facilities.

[01:03:38] And I'm like, well, like why?

[01:03:42] Why?

[01:03:44] Like that, that is exactly what you probably don't need to do.

[01:03:52] I don't want to see this.

[01:03:53] These guys go like haggis and like get too big too fast, but like I don't think you need

[01:03:58] to you need more room.

[01:04:05] American Pimbal is dead gang.

[01:04:07] They might be working on Cuphead, but trust me, like I don't think you'll ever see it.

[01:04:12] It's kind of like predator.

[01:04:13] I don't I don't I just I'm not holding my breath to see predator.

[01:04:18] So I want to I want to now just talk with you guys.

[01:04:21] So what do you think you heard my takes on Kong and Dune?

[01:04:26] What are any of you canceling your subscriptions now because we've got a we've got a lot of

[01:04:31] great stuff happening on the community.

[01:04:34] If you're not a Canadian club member again, I really feel like you should join.

[01:04:37] And in part of it's just to show support for a conversation like this.

[01:04:43] All the hours I take out of my my day to make content for all of you.

[01:04:48] I'm very appreciative of everybody who is a subscriber.

[01:04:52] I did not raise my prices contrary to what someone tried to say on Facebook.

[01:04:57] It is still just $5 a month.

[01:05:00] We just went to an Easter egg hunt got two cups of coffee and it was $7.

[01:05:06] So for $5 a month, you can listen to Canadian Pimbal Podcasts show your support and you're

[01:05:12] going to get two to three shows a week and they're so timely and they're entertaining.

[01:05:17] It's a lot of fun and I think not just that getting into the Patreon chat is awesome.

[01:05:22] It's so much healthier than anywhere else.

[01:05:27] And I think the people that continue to try to label the show as toxic and negative, I

[01:05:34] think those people don't listen and they don't want to admit that I'm right.

[01:05:42] I'm right.

[01:05:43] I'm right about what I just said on Kong and Dune.

[01:05:47] I think Kong is a great game.

[01:05:49] I think it's going to play phenomenally well.

[01:05:51] I think it's amazing fun.

[01:05:53] I think the art is atrocious on the play field should have been less busy.

[01:06:01] And I think like clicking with that and you know it, whatever, it's all subjective.

[01:06:06] But I'm right in my own head.

[01:06:07] But you know what I'm saying?

[01:06:12] But it's the game.

[01:06:13] The thing is this, you know, we didn't talk about Harry Potter or anything, right?

[01:06:16] It's like all of a sudden it's like Jersey Jack now.

[01:06:19] If I'm now I'm like, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[01:06:22] I'm happy if I'm Jersey Jack because nobody dominated.

[01:06:25] Nobody.

[01:06:28] Nobody like really put the gauntlet down.

[01:06:29] If I'm Jersey Jack, I'm not worried about Dune.

[01:06:32] Kong is not, Kong doesn't have me panicking at all.

[01:06:42] My worry about Harry Potter is, is, is, is music clips.

[01:06:48] It's someone asked Jack, he said that you're going to get both, was that mean both?

[01:06:52] Why would there be both Jack?

[01:06:55] There shouldn't be any music clips.

[01:06:58] So I'm, I'm preparing to be disappointed.

[01:07:06] Hector said I'm right.

[01:07:07] I think Hector agrees with everything I say though.

[01:07:10] Hector, love you brother.

[01:07:12] So will you still be friends with Ralph, the bromance on the, no, I love retro Ralph.

[01:07:18] Why would I not be friends with retro Ralph?

[01:07:20] I spoke to him all last week.

[01:07:27] I don't know why I wouldn't be friends with retro Ralph.

[01:07:33] Did he say something about me that I wasn't aware of?

[01:07:37] I think Ralph's a good guy.

[01:07:43] I think he gets it all too.

[01:07:44] Like when him and I talk, they have a video cancelling patreon.

[01:07:50] I don't even know what that is, would video.

[01:07:53] I don't pay attention to anyone else's content gang.

[01:07:55] I watch the gameplay videos, but I don't listen to, to personalities talk about Pimble anymore.

[01:08:02] So people can say, you know, I'm, look, I don't, I don't stop anyone from making content,

[01:08:07] but I only want to listen if, if it's like a game review or something.

[01:08:12] Well, you know what, I've got a, I can afford people.

[01:08:17] You know what, the thing is like if anyone cancelling canate his pinball podcast, you know what

[01:08:22] my feeling on it is?

[01:08:25] I can't wait to welcome you back.

[01:08:27] It's just that simple.

[01:08:28] I never worry about keep people cancelling on me because I've noticed historically most

[01:08:34] people who cancel their membership come back because when you cancelling canate his pinball

[01:08:39] podcast, it is a, it is a weekly habitual addiction for a lot of people in a good way.

[01:08:46] And so I don't really, you know, and I look at my numbers like, you know, they go up and

[01:08:50] down, but like we've been hovering around like a really good number.

[01:08:53] And like my, the monetary number is really the most important one.

[01:08:56] So like I could have 740 people and make less money than when I have 680 because people

[01:09:02] will give more money.

[01:09:04] So I don't, I don't really care.

[01:09:06] Did you do the carry hearty parody?

[01:09:08] I stepped away.

[01:09:09] I did not do it.

[01:09:10] You guys want me to do the carry hearty, do you video that you're going to see soon?

[01:09:14] Do you want me to, do you want me to do it?

[01:09:17] It only if you guys want me to do it.

[01:09:19] I'm going to, I have to do like, I have to like move this like camera, a camera, a camera

[01:09:24] camera beat.

[01:09:25] Like carries, that is the most ridiculous carry I love you, but come on, bro.

[01:09:29] Like, so do you know, I think so do you know, so I'm over here now and I'm over here

[01:09:34] now.

[01:09:35] And it's the same damn dude.

[01:09:36] Dude, there's no going, cutting between cameras.

[01:09:40] It's the, it's the silliest thing I've ever seen.

[01:09:44] Like you do editing back and forth when it's like you're interviewing someone, but like

[01:09:47] what is that?

[01:09:49] All right, ready?

[01:09:51] All right, let me do it.

[01:09:52] It's good fun.

[01:09:53] All right, hold on, hold on.

[01:09:57] I'm going to do a little wardrobe change because I'm going to, I'm going to make it look

[01:10:00] like how he looks in the video.

[01:10:04] Oh see, he's got like a, Drillendor, Scott.

[01:10:24] Try more on the phone.

[01:10:26] That's good.

[01:10:27] Okay.

[01:10:28] All right, he's got a white shirt on and like a blue hat or on backwards.

[01:10:53] Now he's like, he's in it like.

[01:10:56] I got to play. I went down the barrels of fun and now I'm my way down there. Something happened.

[01:11:06] I'm going to move this as I go. Something happened. I'll just keep it. I don't want to keep moving.

[01:11:17] I packed up all my gear. Like I was ready. I brought all my tripods, all my gear and then

[01:11:23] all of a sudden, like before I get there, something happened and the game was out already.

[01:11:29] I'm like, what did I just do? Why did I make this trip?

[01:11:34] Then I get there and everyone's scrambling and I get to see the game.

[01:11:42] Now when he talks about the game, it's like, I'm not going to do a sudden accident. I'm not doing a sudden accident.

[01:11:49] And then he's like, you know, you can see he's got like the energy levels, like energy level

[01:11:56] to his. You know, when I hit my shots, they were fun. And you know, I'm not sure about the

[01:12:07] spinners. You know, they're made of metal and they click at the clank of them. I'm not sure about

[01:12:13] that. And they said they might put a sticker on the spinner because there's no decal on it.

[01:12:22] And they might actually put some decals on those red targets as well. But again, all I know is like,

[01:12:32] what I saw was a pinball machine. And it was fun when I shot it. And I'm not sure if the worm

[01:12:45] mech is going to get old. But I know that I played a pinball machine. And I feel like when you hit

[01:12:56] a shot, it's fun. And yeah, there's no decals on that. Wait, you guys can give money now.

[01:13:08] Did I think I finally set up my monetization and juicy time? Look at you. So wait, all this time.

[01:13:16] All right, you know, it carries like, thank you, brother. Wow. This is the first time I've ever

[01:13:22] got money on YouTube ever. Now, but carries like, you just squeaky voice. He's like, what I do know,

[01:13:39] like, you know, because if I could do a little bit more care, what I do know about this game is it

[01:13:45] comes in a box. Okay. Like, I'll do more of like a joke. And there's like, there's a worm that like

[01:13:55] really slowly lifts up. Now, is that going to get boring over time? Yes. Will I say that to you? No.

[01:14:06] Okay. All I know is I played a pinball machine. All right. And is it fun? Yeah, playing pinball is fun.

[01:14:14] Is this game fun? Am I going to buy it? I'm not going to tell you that. There were no assets.

[01:14:20] It seems like they have everything, but nothing's in it. Nothing's in it. I was looking at, I didn't

[01:14:26] even realize the screen was in the back of the game until, you know, until someone said it's there.

[01:14:33] And I just think like, you know, the integration of nothing is nothing. You know, so it's like,

[01:14:39] until they put those clips in, is Carrie is here. He's here.

[01:14:46] Carrie, I wouldn't say nowhere near as gay. Okay. And the reason I say that is I wouldn't use a

[01:14:55] homophobic slur here. Because I don't think that's a good look for you, bro. And I have a lot of

[01:15:01] friends that are gay. And I don't think that's cool, bro. I mean, I'm being serious now, Carrie. Like,

[01:15:09] you don't want to talk like that. It's not homophobic to say not as gay. Okay.

[01:15:18] Bro, I don't know what like where like, okay. It's weird. I don't know. Maybe it's just New

[01:15:26] York City, bro. We don't talk like that anymore. You're not happy. I doubt it. Okay.

[01:15:34] That's fine. No, but Carrie, like literally, I could tell, I could tell it was painting you, bro,

[01:15:45] to talk about the game. It was. It was like, I could tell, like, you had that dilemma, bro,

[01:15:54] because they, because you were like, because you went in, because you went in there, I could tell

[01:16:01] you wanted to say, but I did your energy level. Like, it didn't seem like you were that excited, bro.

[01:16:07] Gotta be honest. Look, I'm the last person who's gonna get like, woke and offended gang. I'm just

[01:16:21] looking out for you, Carrie. I'm not looking out for me. Trust me. When I try to help you with that,

[01:16:25] I'm not looking out for, for, and maybe you don't care, but that's, that's my thing, and I'm not,

[01:16:30] I'm not looking out for me, man. You can, you can use those words. I just don't talk like that to people.

[01:16:40] No, man, the game was empty. Carrie, the game was empty, though, bro. Like, let's be honest,

[01:16:45] there's no code in the game. I mean, it was very reminiscent of Batman 66 when they first launched

[01:16:53] Batman 66. And, and Carrie, let me ask you, since you saw it, like, do you think they were ready to

[01:16:59] launch that game? Do you really think like, barrels was ready to have media come in and to get

[01:17:06] people to shoot content on a game with no assets? Like, I'm just curious. Gang, like, it's fine.

[01:17:13] We're all grown in here. Like, we can, we can have little, we're not going to go now in that road.

[01:17:17] We're, we're good. We're good. This is a, this is a safe space. Okay, hold on.

[01:17:29] But I, you know, I'm curious what Carrie says about it being ready.

[01:17:39] They spoke about it having a lot of code, but I wasn't seeing it.

[01:17:45] But they're telling me what to shoot for and how to come, so like, okay.

[01:17:51] So, Carrie, I mean, it sounds like the game wasn't ready. I mean, I saw your video, man. It's like,

[01:17:57] so you're literally standing over a game with hardly any code in it. And these guys are like,

[01:18:06] they have to, did anyone have to stand over a King Kong to like talk about modes? No, like,

[01:18:11] they, the game actually worked.

[01:18:19] Carrie, did someone tell, we haven't been here the whole time, did someone tell you I was doing my

[01:18:22] Carrie parody? Anyway, I'm a Patreon subscriber to Carrie Hardy's page gang, so like, show the man

[01:18:30] some love. He's a good sport. He's a good sport. Yeah, I just, I just don't understand, you know,

[01:18:40] and, and barrels is like, it's going to take us a whole year to finish the code. And like, I get it.

[01:18:44] Like, Stern might do that. I don't know, but like, you need, you still need, it's just more

[01:18:50] important now than ever to have decent launch code. I'm not asking for a game to be complete.

[01:18:55] But you need decent launch code nowadays, right? You can't ask 11, 6. Tell everybody you're the

[01:19:01] best bang for buck and pinball and not have decent launch code.

[01:19:12] Yeah, no, I think Carrie was hyped to see it, but I don't think the game left, I don't think he left

[01:19:24] their height. You know, and Carrie, like, Carrie and I, like, people, people might have forgotten.

[01:19:32] So Carrie and I, right, like Melvin brought us in on Alice, and we both got to see it early.

[01:19:38] We both got to make content. Like, I saw the Alice stream. Like, it's fine. It is what it is.

[01:19:42] That game is not going to ever have the depth of code of anything, but it plays and it's a work of art.

[01:19:49] And it, it, Alice succeeds in being what Alice intended to be. Nothing more.

[01:19:56] You know, I think a lot of people would, you know, love the artwork of Alice and the beauty of it.

[01:20:03] But I also think a lot of people would find the game shallow and underwhelming.

[01:20:08] But my point being is, is that Melvin brought Carrie and I in and we got, you know, we got,

[01:20:15] we got to like get a little hype going and it was fun and they sold all of that.

[01:20:21] Yeah, we were both honest, man. Like, Carrie and I, like, nobody, Carrie, you go back and watch

[01:20:26] Carrie and I's content on Alice. Like, nobody was saying, like, oh, yeah, the code's going to blow you away.

[01:20:33] It was just pretty. We didn't know how it shot. We didn't. We didn't.

[01:20:37] Absolutely did not. The first time Carrie and I saw how Alice shot was during the first

[01:20:43] horrendous stream we were trying to help people watch. So it's, I don't know, gang, because like,

[01:20:51] my worry about Dune being incomplete is like, okay, so now what? Right? So, so like now what?

[01:20:59] Because you have no time on and when you're going to get a game, you're probably going to wait

[01:21:05] now because the code is so incomplete. And I think like, if you order a con, you're much more

[01:21:12] confident code's going to come along a lot faster. L one's team is the best in the business.

[01:21:18] And then you're going to have Harry Potter. And when Harry Potter comes out gang, it's going to be like

[01:21:22] code complete. Jersey Jack does not launch. Like, like games with incomplete code. Like, they might

[01:21:31] not have the wizard mode, which would be ironic with Harry Potter. But for the most part,

[01:21:37] you're going to be playing like the majority of Harry Potter on day one. So you will be able to

[01:21:42] determine whether or not, you know, you want the game because what you see is what you get. That

[01:21:47] really is like Jersey Jack's launch motto. And I don't know, not bad to have that as the motto.

[01:21:55] Problem is is like, if what you see is not what you want, you're not buying the game. Avatar.

[01:22:00] Right? Godfather. Elton.

[01:22:06] Dune was rushed out. Kong feels like it's in a rush. Well, you know, we didn't talk about it,

[01:22:13] but Kong not being on Spike 3 is, to me, is like a real miss. I think Dune fans will love the game.

[01:22:20] But if you aren't a fan, yeah, I mean, but who are these people, Harry?

[01:22:24] That has anyone here like in your social circles met a Dune fan 40 to 60 who like legit,

[01:22:33] like loves the new movies. Like, I, it's like Avatar fans. Like they're, they're fans of the film,

[01:22:43] but they don't collect, they don't collect Dune stuff. And then that's the big difference.

[01:22:51] You know what I'm saying is like, you could be, you could go spend 30 bucks and watch Dune and

[01:22:55] I max. You're not dropping 12 grand. Because there needs to be carryover. And, and when we do surveys

[01:23:04] of the pinball buying demographic and you, and Dune doesn't survey well, you're in trouble.

[01:23:12] If it was Gune's, it would have sold, they would have sold all thousand in one day. If it was

[01:23:16] Rick and Morty, they would have sold all thousand in one day. If it was Gremlins, all one thousand

[01:23:22] in one day, Karate Kid, all one thousand in one day, big trouble and little shine, all one thousand

[01:23:26] in one day. If they made Predator properly, all one thousand in one day,

[01:23:31] Fraggler Rock would have been, I bet they would have sold all thousand Fraggler Rocks.

[01:23:35] Yeah, I didn't talk about the calling animations. I don't know about them. They're not as good as

[01:23:48] the Godzilla ones. They, they, they, they feel like they're trying to do the same thing, but they

[01:23:51] don't work as well. This has been a fun show. Karate, thank you for letting me parody you a little bit.

[01:24:05] I mean, Karate and I are definitely, you know, we're definitely on the friendly side of the fence

[01:24:12] together. I think people see both of us as probably the most trailblazing content creators.

[01:24:21] It's good. It's good. It's fun. It's more fun. It's like you feel free. You know, absolutely feel free.

[01:24:28] Everyone does their thing. You know, at this point, there's no, there's no love loss with anybody

[01:24:33] anymore. I mean, I really, you know, I was talking to Jen as this morning. We had a great conversation

[01:24:38] at like three in the morning. And you know, like him and I were like, we're always going to be like

[01:24:44] brothers. You know, we might go through periods where we stop talking every now and then and I might

[01:24:50] say something that offends them, but like, he's like a freaking, he's like a Denmark version of me.

[01:24:58] Like, literally, same Erica, same movies, same interests, like you're same interests. I mean,

[01:25:02] that's what it comes down to. It was like, it's hard to be mad at people who have the same interests

[01:25:06] as you. And then he got a, he hasn't spoken to me on the phone yet, but like, it's fine.

[01:25:15] But life's way too short to hold on to anger really is. I mean, that's, by 100% believe that. And

[01:25:24] you know, I think we've all created a little pinball family for ourselves here. And it's beautiful.

[01:25:32] I can't carry, Gary doesn't have to run for it.

[01:25:38] I talk about a selling point. I know. Use that. Hey, Chris, will JJP let you in? Yes.

[01:25:44] Yes. Ken Cromwell already said he can't wait to have me come over and see the new game.

[01:25:51] And if schedule works out, I can't wait to go back. And unlike last time, I feel like,

[01:26:00] you know, this trip should be just for JJP not go down the block and see Stern. I don't, you know,

[01:26:07] but yeah, I've already, I've already been invited via text to see the next game.

[01:26:16] Look, I don't think they, I don't think they think I'm wrong on Avatar gag. I don't.

[01:26:21] Well, I mean, Gary, you went, you went to a place that they will never forgive you for.

[01:26:40] But look, you know, I mean, I, I still own only a JJP game. I had a little moment where I was

[01:26:47] debating whether or not I get a Kong Ali, then I just Chris wake up that stupid. This is stupid.

[01:26:51] It's a stupid buy. Kong Ali's are not going to hold value at all. And like, I don't want it

[01:26:57] bad enough. Like I, I, I, I'm very happy with what I've seen with the game. But I, I also don't

[01:27:03] feel like I need to own it. You know, I don't understand why that's like such a hard concept for

[01:27:08] people. Like you can really get excited about something you don't want to own. And it's not because

[01:27:14] I can't afford it. I just don't want it as an owner, but I want to play it.

[01:27:22] No, I'm not getting Elton John. Elton John's a great location game.

[01:27:27] I am definitely getting rid of Guns Roses.

[01:27:35] Here's the crazy thing about when I do get rid of Guns Roses.

[01:27:39] I've been toying with the thing where I just kind of store it. You know, I don't, I don't need

[01:27:50] the money. I don't want to take the hit. And I also like, I still think years from now, I mean,

[01:27:56] and I mean, that's what I say. There's just something amazing about Guns R as a jukebox you can play.

[01:28:03] Right? But the rest is, yeah. The thing that really kills G&R, I keep telling this to people,

[01:28:15] it's not the multi balls. It's not. It's the it's the outlane drains. The game is just

[01:28:23] frustratingly hard. And that's why they have to feed you all these multi balls constantly to

[01:28:29] at least get through stuff. But it's it's it's brutal game. And I think if G&R had more flow

[01:28:36] and less brutal draining, because that's the problem, right? It's like, there's too many shots

[01:28:42] close to the flippers. There's not a lot of flow at all. There's barely any flow. And so you're

[01:28:48] like always like breaking the ball back towards the flipper area, the sling area. And then it's just

[01:28:54] outlane drain out lane drain. Like that's that's the problem with G&R. The only really rewarding shot

[01:29:02] in the game is up the leper amp to the upper play field guitar neck. You know, because like the upper

[01:29:09] right flipper orbit shot, it's not consistent. It's not it's not that rewarding. It's just not

[01:29:15] consistent. And then you know, the the right ramp is not that rewarding. There's just not there's

[01:29:23] like no combos anywhere in the game. Yeah, no, Elton, Elton's a much better shooter. But like,

[01:29:35] you know, the my problem with Elton gang is like, I know I'd get bored of it. Because it's like

[01:29:40] just another music pin, right? And like, I'd get bored of Elton and just seeing that collage

[01:29:45] of him. And like, there's not a lot of them. I just think Elton's the it's like the perfect location

[01:29:51] game. Elton is like such a good game to play on location because you don't need to own Elton

[01:30:00] because it doesn't have like this deep, deep, deep code or rule set where you really need to like

[01:30:05] stay in it. No, again, I think like, you know, and look, for me, I'm in a unique situation. I'm

[01:30:12] never going to have a lot of pens. And you know, I'm really looking forward to my next game being a

[01:30:19] movie based a movie based pinball machine that has somewhat more of like a like a linear storyline

[01:30:26] or like you feel like you're churning through the the movie that I love. That is what you know,

[01:30:33] when people say like theme isn't everything I get at a dodge with that theme is everything.

[01:30:40] Saying theme isn't everything. Come on gang. Theme is like 90% of a reason why you'd buy a game.

[01:30:47] I mean it. I mean it. And there's nothing more there's nothing crappier than an amazing shooting

[01:30:53] game. That's on a theme you don't like because in the end like you're going to get rid of it.

[01:31:10] I don't know. Ghostbusters and Tron remastered. You might be waiting a lot a while.

[01:31:16] You've noticed like, and then we're going to call it a day. You notice what's interesting is

[01:31:20] stirring stalling on spike three. Why do you think that is? Do you think they just like

[01:31:30] know they need to price increase and like they know like like people are not ready?

[01:31:38] I don't know what it is, but like a shock that we didn't get the bigger screen on Kong.

[01:31:46] Do you really think we need a good music pin next? Why?

[01:31:54] Why? Like what? What? We have too many music pins in pinball. I think we need more 80s

[01:32:01] nostalgic movie pins is my my opinion. I think there's too much music pin out there.

[01:32:08] Wu Tang. You would not sell a Wu Tang pinball machine to this audience. Guys,

[01:32:17] like you see this audience. You'd sell more Kenny Rogers.

[01:32:28] I don't know. I kind of get bored of music pins. I have to be honest. I just

[01:32:32] would much rather have. Because the thing with music pins gang is like, there's just like the

[01:32:40] the world underclass isn't there. And when you think about music you love, like you're not thinking

[01:32:45] about the world of that band. What they do is they take like notes from music videos and album

[01:32:51] covers and make the world. But for the most part, like it's just not a physical world. That's not how

[01:32:57] you associate with a band. So I think that you know, it's crazy is that no one's ever like really

[01:33:04] made a game where it looks like the stage of that band. And when you look at like like the old guns

[01:33:14] and roses stages from the 1990s, like the ramps are there. Like Axel's running up and down those ramps.

[01:33:20] It's crazy. But nobody's made the actual like top third of the game. Like look like an actual

[01:33:28] entire stage setup of that act. Like you could totally do that. And shock no one's done that.

[01:33:37] Like it just would be so cool.

[01:33:42] Imagine me. But we thought it was like Margaritaville. Remember that rumor?

[01:33:47] I've had some really bad mistakes in the rumor mill. Everybody look, have a great Saturday.

[01:33:54] I'm going to go rest some more. It's a nice warm day here in Connecticut. The weather is turning.

[01:34:00] It's nice. I want to just say, Carrie, thank you for coming on. I'm not offended by your comment.

[01:34:08] You know, I like to keep my show very PG. I don't curse on my show. I don't use any slang words

[01:34:14] or anything that could even be taken inappropriately. I find it funny that some people think I'm

[01:34:22] so negative and toxic and yet I don't even curse. I think this show is another great example of

[01:34:29] Canadian Spinball Podcast always gives constructive criticism that is balanced. And if it was in and

[01:34:34] if it was just negative, then people would be leaving in droves and they're not. So I really do.

[01:34:41] I really do. John Erlich, what's up buddy? I really do appreciate all your all the support you guys do.

[01:34:50] And I love having you guys hang out every Saturday. The numbers here are great. We're actually

[01:34:54] getting more people watching this now than we ever did on Facebook, which leads me to believe that

[01:35:00] a lot of my audience and you guys in general prefer YouTube over Facebook. Because Facebook is like,

[01:35:08] it's just, it's terrible now. I mean, I have my page there. The boy is just like, what happened

[01:35:14] at Facebook? They've just barged you with ads and reels and it's just a cesspool now of contact.

[01:35:22] Don't be negative, buddy. You have to love every pin. That's your job.

[01:35:28] Well, look, I mean, yeah, no. My job is to entertain my audience.

[01:35:37] And that's not a job. It's just, it comes natural to me. And I think that's the only way I would

[01:35:44] want to make pin more content. I'm not a distributor. I get it. I get it. Some people are in it to

[01:35:51] sell games. Some people are in it to say nice things. Some people value the relationship with

[01:35:56] the manufacturers more than telling you how they really feel. Because I just think it's normal to

[01:36:03] love some stuff and not love stuff. I think some companies do things great. I think some companies

[01:36:09] are like just amateur hour. You look good in pink. Comte has not. Thank you. Everyone is a little

[01:36:18] okay. Just depends on how much. That's probably true. All right, everybody. Have a great Saturday.

[01:36:26] This is a great show. I wonder if I'm going to get any correspondence from my friends at barrels.

[01:36:32] Like I don't know. I don't know where we go from here. I really don't. I think they're mad at me.

[01:36:39] Maybe they should just send me a dune when it's ready to actually review. And we should go from

[01:36:45] there. Everybody be good. Canade out. But I'm still here. I'm trying to end the stream. Click it.

[01:36:52] And later.
