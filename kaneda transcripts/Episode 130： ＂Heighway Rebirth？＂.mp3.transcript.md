[00:00] I didn't want to do another pinball podcast this weekend.

[00:17] I wanted you guys to just enjoy the Jersey Jack pinball interview.

[00:22] It's amazing if you haven't heard it, go listen to it.

[00:26] I give you guys the news and I cover pinball stuff as it breaks, which is kind of crazy

[00:31] because it's a podcast.

[00:32] It doesn't need to be so timely, right?

[00:34] But just as I'm sitting on the couch with Bubba, I sort of just go on pinside and I see

[00:39] highway pinball, a new thread, the rebirth of highway pinball.

[00:45] We're going to talk about that.

[00:46] We're going to talk about also what happened with Dutch pinball today.

[00:49] It was a really active Friday in the pinball world.

[00:52] I thought nothing would happen.

[00:54] I thought we would all just wait until June 6th to see more Star Wars news.

[00:59] But here's what we're going to do.

[01:00] We're going to talk about highway.

[01:02] We're going to talk about Dutch pinball.

[01:04] Then I'm going to read some listener feedback of the show.

[01:07] Got a lot of messages from you guys after the Star Wars talk in the Jersey Jack interview.

[01:12] Those three things we're going to cover on this impromptu edition of Kinneas pinball

[01:17] podcast.

[01:18] Let's get right to it.

[01:19] I have predicted this a couple of weeks ago, a week ago, that this is what was going to

[01:25] happen.

[01:26] That Andrew Highway was going to get investors back in and he was going to step down as

[01:31] the leader of highway pinball.

[01:34] I know this must have been a really tough decision for Andrew Highway because we know he loves

[01:39] pinball.

[01:40] We know he loves highway pinball, the company he found it.

[01:44] This move, this move is like, this was the necessary move.

[01:49] I think we all can finally agree that Andrew Highway might love pinball, but Andrew Highway

[01:56] learned the hard way that making pinball is really hard.

[02:00] It's not easy.

[02:01] If there's one thing you need an abundance of to make a pinball company successful, it's

[02:07] money.

[02:08] You do need money when you want to be a pinball company, the size that Andrew Highway

[02:11] won at this company to be.

[02:13] Remember highway pinball has indicated it wants to ship a lot of gear.

[02:19] It wants to be the size of a company, let's say like Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:24] Let's read what we got from this new group that is running highway pinball.

[02:29] They wrote in the thread that is the rebirth of highway pinball and the person who wrote

[02:35] is, his name is HP Investor.

[02:38] I want to read this because I think this is really important to hear what they're saying

[02:42] is the path forward for so many of you who have been waiting for alien pinball.

[02:48] They write, hello to all pinball enthusiasts out there.

[02:52] We are active investors in highway pinball limited.

[02:55] There has been a lot of talk and also silence over the last few weeks.

[02:59] For this we are sorry, but we have not been legally able to reach out to you before now.

[03:05] We are now happy to announce that we have reached an agreement on how to take over the business

[03:10] and move it forward.

[03:12] We are all pinball enthusiasts and professional business owners.

[03:16] We are fully committed to making your games and we have the plan and finance in place to

[03:21] make this happen.

[03:23] We have drawn up a detailed strategy to invest money into the company both to ensure that

[03:29] machines are built to the highest quality and also to ensure that healthy numbers are

[03:33] shipped as quickly as possible.

[03:37] The company will have new management, new leadership and new funding to make sure that

[03:42] everyone who has money at stake will get their ordered pinball machines.

[03:47] The budget and business plan for how to make this a success has been carefully drawn up

[03:53] and is about to be put in place.

[03:55] The transaction is now in progress and legal papers are being drawn up as you read this.

[04:01] We hope you all will bear with us for the next couple of weeks.

[04:05] Did you say a couple of weeks?

[04:06] Did you say two weeks?

[04:08] I think that's what they said as we get everything in place.

[04:12] We have had positive talks with our major distributors around the world and we thank them

[04:18] all for their patience and for believing in us.

[04:21] Did they really have a choice?

[04:22] I'm sorry, I'm chiming in with some stuff here.

[04:24] Together with our suppliers, distributors and new pinball enthusiasts, we can make this

[04:28] happen.

[04:29] Alien is a great game and there are more to follow.

[04:33] We will keep you updated and communication channels will be opened as soon as we are settled

[04:37] in.

[04:38] Thank you for your understanding and patience and advance.

[04:41] We understand your frustrations and concerns.

[04:44] All of us investors are in the same boat as you.

[04:47] Waiting for their games to be shipped and after much time spent at the factory, we have taken

[04:53] matters into our own hands to ensure that highway pinball can survive and prosper.

[04:58] Regards, investor group, highway pinball limited.

[05:00] All right.

[05:01] Now, where do we start dissecting that statement?

[05:05] I mean, this statement means a lot of things.

[05:08] First, it means it's an admission finally.

[05:11] What we've been saying on this podcast for over a year, that Andrew Highway does not

[05:15] know how to get alien pinball into full production.

[05:18] Okay.

[05:19] So, we were right.

[05:20] This podcast was right.

[05:21] There were really troubles in paradise for many, many, many, many months and all the

[05:26] people who denied that, all the people that said everything is fine, all those people in

[05:32] the alien pinball thread who kept convincing everyone that this company was going to be

[05:38] all right.

[05:39] All those people were wrong.

[05:41] Okay.

[05:42] This is where it was always going to lead.

[05:45] They were either going to get bailed out or they were going to collapse.

[05:49] Without these investors, highway pinball would have sent out a message today that the company

[05:54] is no more and everyone would have lost everything.

[05:56] So, I think, look, we have to be honest about this situation.

[06:00] How close, how close this entire thing came to catastrophe?

[06:06] Now, we're not out of the woods by any means on this.

[06:12] How long, how long is it going to take these guys to figure this thing out?

[06:17] Now, I want to read some questions that Pinside Moderator Force Flow asked because I think

[06:23] he captured all of the really important questions in response to these investors.

[06:30] He wrote, who are you?

[06:32] What's your background?

[06:33] Okay.

[06:34] Very first and foremost, that's a great question.

[06:37] These guys don't announce even who they are.

[06:40] From what I can take in their note, they sound like very successful, wealthy businessmen

[06:45] who do other things though.

[06:46] They don't pinball's not their business.

[06:49] Who like pinball?

[06:50] Okay.

[06:51] Rich guys who like pinball, that's like a lot of this hobby.

[06:55] He then asks, do you have an existing interest or background in pinball?

[07:00] Now, for sure, I think these gentlemen are the gentlemen who were originally investors

[07:06] of highway pinball.

[07:07] They didn't state that clearly, but that is what I'm being told.

[07:10] These are the initial highway pinball investors who have been waiting for their games.

[07:14] I think that's the case.

[07:16] They should confirm that for us though, right?

[07:18] He then asks, do you have experience in manufacturing?

[07:21] Now, that is the most important question, right?

[07:25] Do these people understand what it takes to manufacture pinball machines?

[07:31] Because if you don't, then how does money help the problem?

[07:38] I think what people forget when they try to compare what Jersey Jack went through to

[07:43] what Andrew highway is going through is that Jersey Jack had a lot of experience manufacturing

[07:51] games by the time he needed financial help and was was in full-fledged mass production.

[07:58] Andrew only shipped around a hundred full throttles.

[08:03] Jack had an assembly line.

[08:05] He had workers.

[08:06] He had skilled technicians.

[08:08] He had all these people on board that sent out, I believe, somewhere in the ballpark of

[08:14] over 2000 Wizard of Oz's, around 2000 Wizard of Oz's, maybe more, probably a lot more,

[08:20] maybe I'm not sure the total number, but at that point, Jack got help.

[08:25] So that money, when Jack got it, went to bolstering, a company that had very strong pinball manufacturing

[08:34] chops.

[08:36] Manufacturing at that point wasn't Jack's problem.

[08:38] It was just he needed money.

[08:39] Now, right now, we're at a time where highway pinball needs more than just money.

[08:46] They need to figure out how to manufacture pinball machines and manufacture them at a level

[08:51] and a volume that they've never done before.

[08:55] It's almost as if they're starting the company completely over, completely over, less than

[09:01] a hundred full throttles over three years and less than 30 aliens going out over another

[09:08] like few years.

[09:09] That does not indicate to me that they have the systems in place.

[09:14] This flow also asks, is your plan to continue the company or liquidate it?

[09:19] Well, I think that question was answered.

[09:22] Their plan is to not only get alien out there, but also future titles and to make highway

[09:27] pinball a prosperous company.

[09:30] Are buyers going to be made whole, either through full refunds or the games they ordered?

[09:35] That's a good question, right?

[09:37] I wonder if these new investors really understand the amount of people who want refunds.

[09:44] But on day one, they might ink a deal with Andrew about how they're taking over ownership.

[09:51] They might figure out a plan how to make pinball machines.

[09:54] That's one thing.

[09:55] It's another thing to walk in and on day one of these new owners turning the lights on

[10:01] to highway pinball, checking their inboxes and realizing there's all these people that

[10:07] want $8,000, $9,000 back immediately.

[10:10] There's all these people that want their deposits refunded immediately.

[10:14] Are they comfortable with doing that?

[10:17] If they're comfortable investing the kind of money it takes to get a pinball company

[10:22] like highway pinball functional, and by the way, that number is in the millions.

[10:29] It's not just a few hundred grand here.

[10:32] These individuals have decided that they want to invest their millions into highway pinball.

[10:39] And there should be money to give people the refunds.

[10:42] Force flow then asks, are staff contractors and or suppliers that are owed payment going

[10:46] to be made whole?

[10:47] That's a good question.

[10:49] I would assume they would have to be.

[10:51] The last thing this new company wants is people going around the pinside and explaining

[10:57] how they're getting stiff by the new management at highway pinball.

[11:02] He then writes, since Andrew was responsible for the vision behind getting highway started,

[11:08] although he can continue to be part of the company in some way.

[11:11] I think that's a great question.

[11:13] I've wondered that myself.

[11:14] Will Andrew assume the role like Jack has with his company?

[11:20] His name's on the door.

[11:21] His name's on the building.

[11:22] It's highway pinball.

[11:24] It's his dream.

[11:25] It's his baby.

[11:26] It's his vision.

[11:27] Do I think he deserves to still be in a leadership position?

[11:31] Absolutely not.

[11:32] Absolutely not.

[11:33] He drove his own company into the ground.

[11:36] Personally as a marketer, I would change the name of the company.

[11:41] It's no longer highway pinball.

[11:44] If you want to why we birth highway pinball?

[11:48] Is it worth re-birthing?

[11:52] That's the question that these gentlemen have to figure out.

[11:55] They're investing a lot of money.

[11:57] Highway pinball has never successfully shipped many games.

[12:02] Whether or not Alien is a great game or not.

[12:04] We don't know.

[12:05] Not enough have gone out.

[12:06] The quality issues on the initial beta units that went out aren't really good.

[12:11] Another question I would ask is, what are you going to do for all those people that got

[12:15] these 25 games?

[12:17] Are you going to replace, fully replace their games?

[12:20] Because the games these individuals have are sort of like prototypes.

[12:25] They're going to have to make changes to this game if they want to get this game into

[12:29] full production.

[12:30] Another question I have is how much of the game is going to be a game that is going to

[12:34] be a game of the tweaking and the necessary changes to the game that Andrew actually

[12:39] make.

[12:40] We know that this game needs tweaks.

[12:43] Did he actually make those changes?

[12:45] Did he actually order the parts for the LE?

[12:48] What is a reasonable timeline for owners to expect to hear some news?

[12:56] From what these gentlemen have said, it could still be a few weeks before they even

[13:01] ink out the details of the agreement.

[13:07] Then the question becomes this.

[13:09] It becomes a question for everyone.

[13:12] How long are buyers of alien pinball, of supporters of highway pinball willing to wait this

[13:19] out?

[13:20] You don't have a choice.

[13:21] It's sort of like a rhetorical question.

[13:24] You kind of have to wait it out.

[13:26] I think this makes a lot of people sleep a little bit better at night that their money

[13:31] is not going to be gone.

[13:33] I do.

[13:34] I think that this makes you feel better.

[13:37] At least it didn't just go kaput.

[13:40] It didn't say we're bankrupt, we're in solving, it's over.

[13:43] If that happened, money gone, that sucks.

[13:47] They avoided that disaster.

[13:49] I think everyone who's in on alien has a really interesting decision to make.

[13:55] These guys have a lot of money.

[13:58] I don't know who they are.

[13:59] They haven't shown anyone in the world they know how to make pinball machines.

[14:04] You have to ask yourself one question.

[14:06] When these guys take over the reins, do you want your money back on day one just to play

[14:11] it safe?

[14:13] And I'll say it, who wouldn't do that?

[14:17] Why wouldn't you just get back your capital?

[14:22] Let these guys with their millions prove that they can finance highway pinball without

[14:29] your money.

[14:31] This is really like an historic moment in pinball because everyone who's in on alien pinball

[14:36] has a chance to say to these rich individuals, if you want to prove to me that you know

[14:42] how to make pinball machines and you're willing to make the necessary investments to make

[14:48] highway pinball prosperous to get alien out, then you need to prove that to me with your

[14:55] money not mine.

[14:57] And I think that is a really unique situation that we've never experienced in pinball.

[15:03] Do you have the guts to make them prove that to you?

[15:07] And Jack said to me when I talked to Jack yesterday, making buyers, the investors of the company

[15:13] was the biggest mistake he did.

[15:15] It's not the right way to go.

[15:17] You need to have other people invest in the company and a buyer should not be your investor.

[15:25] So will people do that?

[15:27] I know what I would do.

[15:29] I would ask for my money back and say, look, I fully plan to buy alien pinball.

[15:34] I would like a refund.

[15:36] And when you have production up and games are built, I will go back in.

[15:39] I support your company.

[15:41] I support what you're doing.

[15:43] But I've waited two years.

[15:44] I've heard too many lies and I'm not willing to keep all my money in.

[15:49] Again, this is just what I would do.

[15:52] I'm not telling everyone to go like, you do what you do.

[15:55] But that is what I would do because look, you've all waited so long.

[16:00] And again, I'm really, I just, part of me is just like, man, walking around Jack's factory

[16:06] yesterday, part of me is just like, I just think these guys with a lot of money, think

[16:11] making pinball is something you can just do.

[16:13] You can just go find someone who's a distributor.

[16:17] You can just go find someone who makes playfields.

[16:19] You can go find someone who makes cabinets.

[16:21] You can go find someone who's a programmer.

[16:23] Yeah.

[16:24] And all that stuff takes a shitload of time and millions of dollars if you want to crank

[16:30] out games and volume.

[16:33] Look, Forrestville has a few more questions.

[16:34] I want to get my man here, my pinside moderator friend, all of the questions he asked.

[16:40] He said, what will happen with warranty coverage on existing games out in the wild?

[16:43] Yes.

[16:44] Good question.

[16:45] I kind of answered that.

[16:46] Are they going to start to help fix these people's games quickly?

[16:49] He also writes, if you have plans to continue with production, what sort of timeline could

[16:53] we expect?

[16:54] And how many games per week month could we expect to be shipped?

[16:57] Well, Forrestville, I don't think these guys are going to be stupid enough to put a date

[17:02] out there ever that's going to be like, we're going to get 50 L leaves out by this month.

[17:09] He says, has coin takers shipment of games been located delivered?

[17:12] Has it been located?

[17:13] Forrestville, coin takers games have never been built, my friend, located.

[17:19] That's funny, located delivered.

[17:20] Andrew was lying.

[17:22] Okay.

[17:23] At some point, at some point, and at what point will that be?

[17:27] But is this not the point where we can now say, okay, Andrew lied.

[17:32] Andrew lied when he said two weeks ago, significant number of L's were going to ship.

[17:38] Okay.

[17:39] And then two weeks later, companies done, we need new money, we have no money to make

[17:42] production happen.

[17:44] He lied.

[17:45] He lied to coin taker.

[17:46] He lied to Melissa when he said, ten games had shipped.

[17:50] He told him the games had shipped.

[17:52] And then he gave no tracking number.

[17:54] He took their money.

[17:55] He took full payment on ten machines from Chris and Melissa, hardworking people, working

[18:03] in Pimble, trying to make a living in this hobby.

[18:06] He lied.

[18:07] Okay.

[18:08] I understand.

[18:09] I understand that when times get tough, these manufacturers tend to lie.

[18:14] They tend to say things that aren't true to buy themselves more time.

[18:18] And we've been saying it on this podcast all along.

[18:22] And look, I don't feel validated, right?

[18:24] I don't want highway Pimble to go belly up and all you lose your money.

[18:28] What I've always wanted is Andrew highway to tell the truth.

[18:32] And I want consumers out there to make smart decisions with their money.

[18:36] And I think you're at an interesting point right now.

[18:39] As whether or not you believe these guys can get highway Pimble turned around, that's

[18:44] yet to be seen.

[18:45] I don't think it's going to happen quickly.

[18:46] I don't think it's going to happen quickly.

[18:48] But I think, again, the onist should be on them to turn the company around with their

[18:53] money, not yours.

[18:54] I would get your money back.

[18:57] And until you see a sign that production has ramped up and you know that your money is

[19:02] going to your game.

[19:04] But because think about it guys, it's going to be really expensive.

[19:07] It's going to be really expensive for these gentlemen to turn the company around and to

[19:11] do all the necessary things.

[19:14] And I know you're going to get pressure.

[19:15] You're going to get pressure on Pinside from people who say, don't pull out.

[19:19] Now the investors we're going to get cold feet and then we're going to have no future.

[19:24] That nonsense needs to stop.

[19:27] These gentlemen have now come out and they've said they're going to do this.

[19:31] They now need to go do it.

[19:33] Of course they could always pull a pintasia and sort of see the reality of what they got

[19:38] themselves into and then quickly get out of it.

[19:42] And look, they might do that.

[19:44] They might do it.

[19:45] This is still on shaky ground.

[19:48] This is still on shaky ground.

[19:50] But I just want to say we did call it here on this podcast.

[19:53] We did tell people there were problems in highway Pimbo for many, many months.

[19:58] We don't feel good about it.

[20:01] And now's not the time to just take anybody at their word.

[20:06] And I think someone said it the best on Pinside.

[20:08] I forget who said it.

[20:09] They said, I'm so sick and tired of getting an announcement about an announcement.

[20:17] Another announcement telling us to wait for another announcement.

[20:20] I agree.

[20:21] I think it's enough of that shit.

[20:24] It needs to stop.

[20:25] And look, we have Star Wars to be excited about.

[20:29] We have dialed in to be excited about.

[20:30] We have a tack from Mars remake to be excited about.

[20:33] I'm so tired of this other stuff.

[20:36] These companies that are just collapsing around us who are who who like really can't get

[20:41] it figured out.

[20:42] So speaking of that, as if as if one new Pimbo manufacturer having a really hard time

[20:50] on a Friday isn't enough, we get two new Pimbo companies having a really hard time on the

[20:58] same day.

[20:59] And that's Dutch Pimbo.

[21:00] Let's read what those guys tried to pull with their newsletter today.

[21:04] I just have to read it first and then we'll go into a Dutch Pimbo problem.

[21:11] So Dutch Pimbo sends out, I guess they're doing like these Friday newsletters and they

[21:15] sent one out today and it's exactly what people didn't want to hear and I'll read it.

[21:19] Here is our weekly update about the latest developments of the production of the Big Lebowski

[21:24] Pimbo.

[21:25] You know, isn't production of Big Lebowski Pimbo about the most oxymoronic statement?

[21:29] But anyway, I'll keep reading.

[21:31] In our newsletter two weeks ago, we informed you that Nivouge, the holding that owns our

[21:37] contract manufacturer, ARA, had demanded, demanded 51% of the shares in Dutch Pimbo.

[21:45] Since then, we received a lot of advice and talked to a lot of people about their offer.

[21:51] We will share some of them with you.

[21:54] Basically, there are two groups, early achievers who want their Big Lebowski ASAP, early achievers

[22:01] who want their Big Lebowski ASAP and would like Dutch Pimbo to build more Pins in the future.

[22:08] Group one advises to accept everything just to get their Big Lebowski.

[22:14] Please note that this decision may be based on lack of knowledge of the conditions we would

[22:19] have to deal with.

[22:22] The conditions you have to deal with as all these early achievers, man, as they have their

[22:26] money tied up with you for years and you won't give refunds.

[22:29] Poor you.

[22:30] I love to victimizing.

[22:31] You read the victimizing in this?

[22:32] Anyway, I'll keep going.

[22:34] Group two pointed out a lot of risks when we would give away the majority of our shares.

[22:41] Here are a few remarks that we received.

[22:43] I'm not going to read this.

[22:46] So what he does is he writes actual remarks he got from people, from buyers of the Big Lebowski.

[22:53] Really weird to do that.

[22:55] I just really, really weird, but I want to point out one thing here.

[22:59] He said Group one.

[23:01] He said Group one, the early achievers who just wanted them to accept the deal to get their

[23:05] games.

[23:06] He said, is very small.

[23:08] Two or three achievers.

[23:11] Most of you want DP to be in business for the long term and we also want this.

[23:15] Therefore, we decided to turn down the offer as we feel there are way too many risks connected

[23:20] to it.

[23:21] We received no reaction yet from ARA and we, therefore, will also look for an alternative

[23:27] manufacturer to build the Big Lebowski's.

[23:29] Okay, so this goes out today.

[23:31] This goes out actually before the highway pinball rebirth.

[23:35] Okay, so on one day, it's like this sort of bloody Friday in the pinball world.

[23:40] This sort of, you know, we're fucked Friday for these two companies.

[23:46] Okay, where do I start with this Dutch thing?

[23:48] So I just want to say this.

[23:49] I want to say this.

[23:50] I talk to many more than two or three early achievers.

[23:55] Every single one of them wants them to accept the deals of ARA and get their game now.

[24:02] And I'll tell you why because they want the game they paid for.

[24:07] They don't give a shit about your future anymore.

[24:11] You've lost Dutch all goodwill with your buyers.

[24:15] All goodwill.

[24:16] It's gone.

[24:17] It's evaporated.

[24:18] It evaporated.

[24:19] Let me tell you when it evaporated.

[24:20] It evaporated the moment you lied to them about the delay.

[24:26] It evaporated the moment you made people wait years and didn't get them their game.

[24:31] It evaporated when you announced Bob 3.0 as a way to like raise capital to try to get

[24:38] yourself out of the hole.

[24:40] Okay.

[24:41] So when they say in this newsletter that only two or three people wanted them to take the

[24:47] deal, I am calling them out as lying that that's the only amount of people.

[24:53] And you know why I know they're lying?

[24:56] Because someone started a pin-side poll that basically asked should they have taken the

[25:02] deal, right?

[25:04] And 87% of people said to take the deal.

[25:10] 95 votes for take the deal.

[25:12] 14 votes for don't take the deal.

[25:15] Okay.

[25:16] Those 14 votes are probably burying the op with seven different duplicate accounts amongst

[25:20] each of them, right?

[25:22] Come on.

[25:23] Are we supposed to believe this?

[25:26] That people who have waited forever don't want that.

[25:31] They don't care.

[25:32] This is the thing.

[25:33] They don't care about the company they want the game they paid for.

[25:36] I don't care about highway pinball company.

[25:39] I want people to get their games.

[25:41] This notion that these companies are these like manifest destiny organizations that should

[25:48] survive at all costs because they're making pinball machines is the weirdest thing to

[25:53] make.

[25:54] No, a pinball company.

[25:56] It's like the movie Titanic.

[25:57] I assure you, sir.

[25:59] She's made of iron.

[26:00] She can sink.

[26:01] I assure you, sir.

[26:02] A pinball company that's managed by fucking idiots is going to fail.

[26:06] She can't fail.

[26:07] It's pinballed.

[26:08] These games have to be made.

[26:10] Are you telling me?

[26:11] Yes.

[26:12] That is what I'm telling you that a pinball company can fail.

[26:16] This is so weird.

[26:18] It's just, again, there's no other hobby like it where I've seen so many.

[26:23] So many missteps by so many companies who thought it was easy to make pinball.

[26:27] Everyone saw Jersey Jack come onto the scene in 2011 and just thought they could just

[26:32] follow suit and do it.

[26:34] And it would be easy and they would make money and they would make millions and their

[26:37] names would be on buildings and they'd go to all these expos and they'd rent out pen

[26:42] out apartments and they'd get up on stage and say, fuck you, Gary Stern, fuck Stern pinball.

[26:47] You guys don't know what you're doing.

[26:49] We're Dutch pinball.

[26:50] We're rock stars.

[26:51] We're higher hot chicks.

[26:53] We're going to make big libous skin.

[26:55] We're going to show you how it's done and now look where we are.

[26:58] Now look where we are.

[27:00] What's Gary Stern said?

[27:02] What's George Gomez said?

[27:05] What's anyone at Stern said?

[27:07] Has Steve Richie come on and been belligerent when people are making fun of his game right

[27:12] now?

[27:13] No.

[27:14] No, they're busy making pinball machines.

[27:16] They're busy putting these devices in your home.

[27:19] They're busy running a company.

[27:21] What's Jersey Jack saying about all this?

[27:23] He's busy making dialed in.

[27:25] He's about to do his cartwheel next week and these guys want to tell us only two or three

[27:29] people wanted them to take the deal.

[27:32] It's not cool.

[27:35] The lying, the constant lying.

[27:38] What I don't get is this though.

[27:40] Andrew Highway has lied way more times than Barry and Yop.

[27:43] I think Barry and Yop have lied a couple times.

[27:46] Two highways probably lied like 20 times.

[27:49] But yet Andrew Highway gets all the leeway in the world and people don't give Dutch

[27:55] any.

[27:56] It's so weird.

[27:57] It's so weird.

[27:58] They've both been caught in so many lies.

[28:01] One is like, let me tell you something right now.

[28:04] I'm going to be honest.

[28:05] The big Lebowski is a much better game than Alien.

[28:09] Much better game.

[28:10] Okay.

[28:11] Much better.

[28:12] Ask anyone who's played both.

[28:14] If I were to root for one company to succeed because I think they built the better product,

[28:19] it should be Dutch Pimbal.

[28:21] Because Lebowski is great.

[28:23] I would love to see what these guys would do next.

[28:26] Full throttle, Alien.

[28:28] That's the company we're rooting for to save all the time.

[28:31] That's the company that you give so much slack to.

[28:34] That's the company who you let lie to you time and time and time again.

[28:38] It doesn't make any sense to me.

[28:40] It's root for the game that's better, the company that has better potential to bring you

[28:46] guys what you're looking forward to and innovation and all that stuff.

[28:52] It's a bad day.

[28:54] It's a bad day for Pimbal to see both these companies trying to figure out their way out

[28:59] of these terrible holes they both put themselves into.

[29:04] Here's the mistake I think Dutch made from the very beginning.

[29:06] They never should have lied.

[29:08] They got the bill from ARA that said, you owe us this much for all these games.

[29:13] I don't care how much that bill was for.

[29:16] They should have went back and said, look, how much more per game is that?

[29:20] Let's say it was like two to three thousand dollars more per game.

[29:24] I don't care what the bomb is.

[29:25] I don't care what the actual cost is.

[29:27] I don't care what you told consumers.

[29:29] If Dutch had to go back to its customers and said, look, we fucked up.

[29:33] We made a gain that had so much in it.

[29:36] It's so advanced.

[29:37] We didn't have any manufacturing like ability.

[29:39] We had to pay someone to manufacture it.

[29:42] Their cost is this.

[29:44] That means each game is going to be twelve thousand dollars, thirteen thousand dollars.

[29:47] You can bail out.

[29:49] We're only going to make three hundred.

[29:51] That's how much they cost.

[29:52] We're sorry.

[29:53] Look, but we promise you this.

[29:55] It's going to be an amazing game.

[29:57] It's going to be well built.

[29:58] It's going to be much better than the sixteen thousand dollar magic girls that don't

[30:03] even work.

[30:04] It's going to be much better than the fifteen thousand dollar Batman Super Lee.

[30:08] We guarantee you, if you buy this game for twelve to thirteen thousand dollars, they're

[30:12] going to hold their value because we're only making three hundred.

[30:15] It is the most advanced and complex rare game that will ever be.

[30:21] Whatever.

[30:22] They don't have to say ever be.

[30:23] You know what I'm saying?

[30:24] They should have said that.

[30:25] I'll tell you what would happen.

[30:27] People would have said, thank you for telling us the truth.

[30:30] I'm sorry we know this is your first time in this rodeo and we'll either pay you the

[30:34] money or we'll ask for a refund and we'll let new buyers aside if they're willing to

[30:39] pay that.

[30:40] They should have asked for help in the right way.

[30:43] They lied.

[30:44] They lied.

[30:45] It's been almost a year.

[30:46] They're lying again.

[30:48] And look, I don't know where they go now.

[30:50] I mean, they have to go now, find a new manufacturer.

[30:53] What happens to the forty games that that ARA has?

[30:56] What happens to my friend Greg's game?

[30:58] That's Bill.

[30:59] That's just sitting in a box.

[31:01] So what happens to that ARA just keeps it?

[31:04] Do they just touch, sue them now to get them back?

[31:07] That could take years.

[31:10] Years.

[31:12] You know, I always feel like saying, you know, Dutch pinball is going to figure there's

[31:15] shit out the day after you die, right?

[31:18] All right.

[31:19] Well, that's, that's where these two companies are at.

[31:22] All right.

[31:23] It sucks.

[31:24] I hate talking about this stuff.

[31:26] I hate putting up these kinds of podcasts.

[31:29] I hate saying I told you so, but I told you so.

[31:33] A lot of people who are trying to tell you the truth about highway pinball, deserve an

[31:37] apology, right?

[31:39] They deserve an apology.

[31:41] My friend Kim Mitchell deserves an apology.

[31:45] He saw the true colors of the management at highway pinball months ago.

[31:50] And what did you do?

[31:51] You ran him off the site.

[31:53] He showed you information that showed that Andrew highway's business practices never led

[31:59] to successful companies.

[32:01] He showed you information that said that highway pinball is in trouble.

[32:04] And what did you do?

[32:05] You told him to shut up.

[32:06] You thumbs down to him.

[32:07] You ran him off the site.

[32:09] When I had information, when I was trying to reveal stuff and tell you guys things, that

[32:12] was actually factual and accurate.

[32:14] What did you do?

[32:15] You ran me off the site.

[32:16] You accused us of being like witch hunters.

[32:19] My friend Rubber Ducks.

[32:21] I know in the UK, Rubber Ducks sharing with you information that is helping you make better

[32:26] decisions.

[32:27] What did you do to him?

[32:28] You told him to shut up.

[32:29] You told him to go away.

[32:31] Look, I know we're not going to get these apologies, but I think people like Wicker

[32:36] Man, people like Helton, those people, those people are the dangerous people on the forums

[32:44] because they don't care about the truth.

[32:46] All they care about is their precious alien machine.

[32:50] And a lot of good people I know, a lot of people I respect, they saw the signs, they saw

[32:57] smoke, they saw smoke and they didn't yell fire right away.

[33:02] They didn't yell fire even today.

[33:04] They just say, God, there's a lot of smoke here.

[33:06] You should look at the smoke and you should ask yourself, is this worth it?

[33:12] Are you willing to put up with this?

[33:14] And I think today just validated that there's a lot of really good people in the thread who

[33:19] deserve an apology.

[33:20] And there's a lot of people in the thread who deserve to be looked at a little differently.

[33:25] And there's a lot of just people like Helton, they just deserve to lose all credibility.

[33:29] You know what Helton told somebody?

[33:31] He said, Andrew Highway is independently successful and that's how I know they're going to make

[33:35] it.

[33:36] He told that to somebody.

[33:37] He told that to somebody in Madison Pimbal.

[33:41] Is that where we're at, Helton?

[33:42] Are you wrong?

[33:43] Can you just come on and say you're wrong again?

[33:45] You're wrong about Kevin Koolik.

[33:47] You're wrong about Andrew Highway.

[33:49] And don't hide behind this.

[33:50] I just support all Pimbal.

[33:52] No, but you're not supposed to.

[33:54] You're not supposed to support everything.

[33:57] Are you supposed to just support every politician?

[34:00] Support everyone you meet?

[34:01] Do you just support everybody who's passionate about something?

[34:06] You should look at people critically.

[34:07] It's what being an adult is about.

[34:10] We shouldn't just blindly support everyone who says, I have a product.

[34:13] Give me your money.

[34:14] Okay, I support you.

[34:15] How?

[34:16] Grow up, Helton, or get off of Pinside.

[34:19] You've done nothing but hurt the hobby.

[34:22] You think you're helping the hobby.

[34:24] You've hurt so many people by constantly telling them to keep the faith in Kevin, keep the

[34:31] faith in Andrew.

[34:32] Look where that's led people.

[34:35] All the sleepless nights, all the gray hairs, because you were so confident and you were

[34:40] wrong.

[34:41] Okay?

[34:42] I think you owe a lot of people an apology.

[34:43] I think you should just take a step down for a while and go away and reevaluate how you're

[34:48] going to support Pimball in the future.

[34:50] Okay?

[34:51] It's important.

[34:52] Everyone should learn from this.

[34:54] All right.

[34:55] Are we done with that?

[34:56] Let's read some feedback.

[34:58] Let's read some feedback from people who have emailed me recently about Star Wars and

[35:05] other things.

[35:06] All right.

[35:07] So here we go.

[35:09] Here we go.

[35:10] He said, I love you.

[35:16] He said also a great call on the Zen Pimball Compare with Star Wars.

[35:21] He said, I had a laugh that you were down in the basement at 3am to record the podcast.

[35:28] Well, Jared, thank you for the note.

[35:30] Yeah.

[35:31] I am curious as to why Zen Pimball can look so good, but Stern Star Wars can't seem to match

[35:37] that level of detail.

[35:38] That's a question a lot of people have had.

[35:41] I got a note from Gregor.

[35:43] He said his note was Star Goers.

[35:46] He said, dear Chris, I'm sorry for your loss.

[35:49] But look it this way.

[35:50] Once Guardians of the Galaxy will be awesome, you'll be happy that you won't have two space

[35:55] themes in your small collection looking forward to upcoming coverage.

[35:59] Greetings from the old country, Gregor.

[36:02] Thank you.

[36:03] Yeah, I'm super excited that Guardians is a rumored theme.

[36:08] But with all Stern releases, Star Wars did kill a lot of my excitement to see what's

[36:14] next.

[36:15] Let's see.

[36:17] So I got a note from Steve Stone.

[36:19] Steve, thank you for reaching out.

[36:21] I said, he's like, you're not kidding.

[36:23] Wouldn't much rather have seen J.J.P. make Star Wars.

[36:26] Yeah.

[36:27] I agree.

[36:28] I think Star Wars deserved better than what we've seen so far.

[36:33] But I'm going to stop before I read more feedback from my listeners.

[36:37] I've heard from some people who have played Star Wars, who have seen Star Wars in action.

[36:43] And here's what I'm being told.

[36:45] There is a lot that is going to go on in the gameplay, that is going to really wow people.

[36:50] There's a lot that hasn't been shown or can be seen by looking at the play field picks.

[36:56] So like the rest of you, I think all of us should take a break from crying about the

[37:02] art, because we know Steve or T.R. does never great.

[37:06] And I think we should wait to see what they reveal on the six, what will be in the matrix

[37:10] of these games.

[37:11] And what surprises are in store.

[37:13] I've heard there are things that are going to surprise people about what this game can

[37:16] do.

[37:18] So look, when I hear that, I'm excited.

[37:20] I'm excited to see what Star Wars will ultimately become.

[37:23] We really are not judging it with enough of the information about the game.

[37:29] Got an email from Drew, Drew Blood, he says, as I was listening to your last two podcasts

[37:34] about Star Wars, I had a thought.

[37:37] I agree the art looks like shit and the play field, especially the pro is pretty empty and

[37:41] looks thrown together.

[37:43] It made me think what is their price point on each model?

[37:48] Have they announced it yet?

[37:49] What if because of the theme being so popular and the fact that a lot of non-pinheads potentially

[37:54] wanting to buy it for theme alone, that Stern price is quite a bit cheaper to reach

[38:01] more of the new buyer, the Star Wars collector market.

[38:05] Okay.

[38:06] And he says that maybe the pro will be at $4,000.

[38:08] And I told him, dude, you're crazy.

[38:11] It's going to be the price of Erasmith and Erasmith pro and Erasmith premium and

[38:15] L.E.

[38:16] Stern.

[38:17] Yes.

[38:18] There's pro looks probably to be one of the cheapest pros I've ever seen, but Stern

[38:22] is no way going to leave money on the table, especially with the theme as popular as Star

[38:27] Wars.

[38:28] And they're definitely going to want to charge as much as possible.

[38:30] Look, I think they're going to make a nice profit margin on Star Wars pro because that

[38:35] pro compared to Erasmith pro, man, it looks so barren.

[38:39] It's like taking out the toy box in Erasmith pro, right?

[38:43] I mean, none of the cool features seem to be in the pro, but we'll see what happens,

[38:50] but the pricing is not going to come down on it.

[38:52] All right.

[38:53] I got an email from Molly Ackinson.

[38:55] Molly, thank you for sending me this email.

[38:58] Molly writes, Hey, Chris, I listen to your podcast.

[39:01] Whenever I can, I go on jogs all the time and I always look every day to see if there's

[39:05] a new Canadian pinball podcast.

[39:07] I love your take on the hobby.

[39:09] It's very insightful.

[39:10] You're very articulate.

[39:12] I run a pinball operation in L.A.D.s called pins and needles.

[39:17] While my think focuses primarily on location pinball, I think what you're doing for the

[39:22] home collector is great.

[39:24] Keep up the good work.

[39:25] Thank you, Molly.

[39:26] I really appreciate it.

[39:27] It's always great when I have like female listeners to the show because I think what we're

[39:30] always trying to do is broaden our audience and Canadian pinball podcast.

[39:34] So Molly, thank you for the note.

[39:36] Let's see.

[39:37] I got some more Star Wars emails here.

[39:40] So Blades, Blitz said Star Wars.

[39:42] Hey, Chris, good take on artwork.

[39:45] It's amazing how such a franchise has so many poor machines.

[39:49] It's sad.

[39:50] But go back to Stern's Star Trek that Richie did and that took a beating on the artwork

[39:56] as well as the complaints over the Blan play field, including the premiums that had potato

[40:01] like asteroids.

[40:03] Quoting Nate Schivers podcast when he called them floating potatoes.

[40:06] Star Trek is great.

[40:08] My Star Wars might turn out the same with how it plays, but I think all the models of

[40:13] it look cheap.

[40:14] I still own my dad at East Star Wars since 1998.

[40:17] It's boring to play, but it's cool looking representation of Star Wars.

[40:22] Stern's play field looks like a cheesy sagittaddle from the 90s.

[40:25] That's from Jay.

[40:27] Jay, yeah, I mean look, I think what you said about Star Trek is what a lot of people are

[40:32] hoping for that.

[40:33] You know, look, we're not going to get what we would love with artwork, but if everything

[40:38] else comes together, then it could be just an incredibly fun pin to shoot and could go

[40:43] down as one of the better pins.

[40:46] But you know, look, and look, Richie made Star Trek.

[40:50] He made Game of Thrones.

[40:51] He made ACDC.

[40:52] I think ACDC is the one that people keep pointing out that Star Wars is so similar to ACDC

[40:59] and ACDC is a great pin.

[41:00] So I think that kind of puts people at ease, but I also think it backs up my opinion that

[41:05] it's just a lack of originality.

[41:06] When you put the ACDC next to Star Wars, you look at the layouts very similar.

[41:12] You know what else you need to do?

[41:14] Put Avatar next to Star Wars and tell me it's not the exact same pin.

[41:19] All right.

[41:20] Just do that.

[41:21] Take a break, hit pause.

[41:22] I'm, you know, I'm annoying, right?

[41:23] You want to hit pause everyone some while and just go do something else.

[41:26] Let's see.

[41:28] I got to know from Harry said, Harry said, Harry Riemher said, Chris, I so wish Jay, Jay

[41:34] could have had the license the more I have been looking at this artwork and game in general,

[41:38] the more of a disappointment it is.

[41:41] He then says, I was waiting to see Star Wars so I can allocate my pinball money today.

[41:45] I ordered MMR with Joe Newhart and that's that.

[41:49] Well Harry, you know, look, I think you build, I got to say this, I think you build maybe

[41:54] a little early.

[41:55] You saw the art and when it got MMR, you didn't see how Star Wars played yet.

[42:00] I may want to, I would ask you maybe to hold pause on that payment for MMR and see, see

[42:05] what the gameplay is.

[42:06] I, now it's too early to bail on Star Wars.

[42:09] It just is.

[42:11] Ryan, Culper said, Ryan, thank you for listening to Kenny's pinball podcast.

[42:15] Hey, Kineated, just wanted to say thanks for the great podcast.

[42:18] I'm able to listen to them at my job and listen to everything I can really enjoy the newest

[42:23] pod, wait, I really enjoy the newest podcast at the JJP Factory.

[42:27] Kyle Dinn is my first new and box machine and I'm very happy to get a JJP machine and

[42:32] I have it and have it be a Pat Law machine at that.

[42:36] So Ryan, look, thank you for listening.

[42:38] I think you're going to love Kyle Dinn.

[42:41] I got a lot of notes about how great that interview was.

[42:44] And I don't get them all just emailed to me.

[42:46] I speak to a lot of you guys on Facebook, on text messages.

[42:50] Unanimously, I think you guys really enjoy the talk with Jack and I enjoyed talking to

[42:54] him just as much as you enjoyed listening to it, hopefully.

[42:57] Let's see, I got an email from Todd Anderson.

[43:02] Let's see, Todd and I talked back and forth.

[43:05] So I want to get Todd's last one.

[43:07] He said, well, I hope and don't hope, sorry guys, we talked about pricing and we were just

[43:13] talking, we were talking about the JJP bomb and Jack talked about how the bomb being foreground

[43:18] on Waz and how it was more than that and we were going back and forth about whether or

[43:23] not we think that's the actual bomb.

[43:24] And I think when you see Jack's operation, I don't think Jack is making up how expensive

[43:30] it is to build the materials because you have to take everything into account of building

[43:34] materials, wages, workers, electricity, programmers, designers, vendors, everything has to go into

[43:41] what you ultimately will cost you per game and then you have to factor in probably delays

[43:46] and this and that.

[43:48] So look, I think Jack is being completely honest about how much his bomb is on these machines.

[43:53] And I think he's being honest too because they financially went under when he thought

[43:58] his bomb was going to be that.

[43:59] So I have no doubt that his bomb was accurate.

[44:01] All right, a few more than we're going to call it a day and let you guys have your weekend.

[44:08] I emailed Jack and I said, Jack, thank you, it was awesome going there and Jen just got

[44:13] back to me and said, that's awesome.

[44:15] I listened last night, it was great.

[44:17] Thanks again.

[44:18] Jen, thank you so much for listening to the podcast about your father.

[44:22] It brings me joy and I'll say this.

[44:25] And Jack and I, man, we butt heads.

[44:29] I butt heads with a lot of people in the past and looking back on it all, I regret some

[44:35] of the stuff I've said about people.

[44:37] But we called it like it is and we were honest about the troubles they were going through.

[44:42] Would I have done it in the same fashion and been as negative?

[44:45] No.

[44:46] I think this podcast has now approached how to talk about these things without personally

[44:50] attacking individuals without making up stuff about individuals without over dramatizing

[44:56] this stuff.

[44:58] So it was with great pleasure to go from being someone who is insulting what they were

[45:03] doing over at JJP to being welcomed into JJP and to talking to them about what's going

[45:10] on, seeing what's going on and reporting back to you that, you know, this company's turned

[45:15] the corner.

[45:16] It's done a 180.

[45:17] They have what I believe to be the best pinball machine of the year and I think they have a

[45:23] magical game in dialed in.

[45:24] It doesn't mean I don't think Star Wars can be magical but I think dialed in is an especially

[45:30] great game and I really do and it's a family run business and they really care a lot about

[45:36] pinball and seeing what's going down with like highway and what's going down with Dutch,

[45:41] I even give Jack more credit for fighting through the tough time and getting to where he's

[45:46] at today.

[45:47] And he'll tell you first hand, it's always going to be tough.

[45:50] You have to stay on top of it.

[45:52] I got a couple emails recently like in the next few minutes that highways no more that

[45:57] Andrew's out.

[45:59] So that's it for this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[46:02] I believe this is episode 130.

[46:04] Again, was implanting to do it.

[46:06] I want to take a week off from pinside.

[46:08] I have to be honest.

[46:10] I'm fatigued by all the Star Wars commenting back and forth.

[46:14] It's tiring.

[46:18] I might have jumped the gun too early as well and overreacted to the artwork.

[46:23] It's what happens.

[46:24] I love artwork.

[46:25] It's something I get really into when I see a new pinball machine.

[46:30] But I have to say this.

[46:31] I want to say thank you to all the listeners out there.

[46:34] I want to say thank you to, I was talking even to Robin.

[46:37] I'm pinside.

[46:38] I sent him the interview with Jack and I said Robin, you take a listen.

[46:41] I think I've really changed in a lot of ways and I think you'd appreciate this podcast.

[46:47] I told him to, you know, being a jerk in the Hobbit threads is what got me banned on

[46:52] pinside.

[46:55] I think this will show you what a 180.

[46:57] It's all gone.

[46:59] Jack and I have birded any hatchets.

[47:02] We're now friends.

[47:04] I'm friends with most of the people on pinside that I used to get an arguments with.

[47:08] I've even had good correspondence back and forth with orrk behind the scenes recently.

[47:14] I don't talk about this stuff because we move on.

[47:19] Would I like to be back on pinside?

[47:20] Yes.

[47:21] I would.

[47:22] Just because I like to be in these conversations with you guys, where these conversations

[47:25] are taking place, I don't want to be back on pinside to be a troll or a nuisance or

[47:31] annoying like user.

[47:32] No, of course not.

[47:35] If you want me back on, I always say is this.

[47:39] Just drop the moderation team of no being like, it'd be a good time to reconsider.

[47:43] Can I get it back on?

[47:44] That's it.

[47:45] I'm not begging.

[47:46] I'm not asking.

[47:47] And Robin knows I'd like to be back on.

[47:48] But again, I love what I do here and this will never alter.

[47:50] This will never change.

[47:51] But I do think it's a little bit of a shame that these kinds of great interviews can't

[47:55] even be linked to on pinside, like interviews with Jack and Gomez and Franchie and the list

[48:02] goes on and on and on.

[48:04] So look, enclosing, I want to say this, making pinball is hard.

[48:10] You shouldn't go make a pinball company if you don't understand what it takes.

[48:16] You should not believe what a pinball manufacturer tells you just because you love pinball.

[48:20] That's what a child does.

[48:22] A child listens to whatever an adult does and gets into the car and then gets kidnapped

[48:26] and killed.

[48:27] That's a dramatic example.

[48:30] We're not children.

[48:31] We're all grown adults.

[48:32] I know we love this.

[48:33] But I don't want to see anyone lose their money.

[48:35] I don't want to see anyone wait for years.

[48:38] I don't want to see any manufacturers have declining health and have the lie to us because

[48:44] they find themselves in a bad situation.

[48:47] I don't want to see any of this stuff.

[48:48] This is a pinball.

[48:49] This is a fun thing.

[48:51] I'm looking at magic girl.

[48:52] Well, it doesn't really work.

[48:53] But I'm looking at, if I were to imagine a pinball machine that was there that worked,

[48:58] I look at it and say this device is meant to bring joy.

[49:01] It's meant to bring happiness.

[49:03] It's meant to bring excitement into your lives.

[49:06] When it brings the opposite emotions into your life, like anxiety and fear and, you know,

[49:12] intention and arguing and crankiness and all the things that are the complete opposite

[49:21] of what we look to these non-essential items for.

[49:24] Like remember that these are all non-essential items.

[49:27] It's a shame.

[49:29] There are so many exciting games coming out this year.

[49:31] There's so much excitement going on at JJP, at Stern, right, at Chicago Gaming Company.

[49:39] So let's support the companies that are really delivering on that excitement.

[49:46] The companies that need to figure their stuff out, let's let those companies figure it out,

[49:51] but not with our money, not with our emotions, not with our time anymore.

[49:56] Time is so short.

[49:58] That's the point of locking up your excitement in this hobby with these organizations that

[50:04] have done nothing but deliver anything but joy and happiness, right?

[50:09] And 15 guys with beta units of aliens boasting that they have it, doesn't make anyone happy,

[50:17] right?

[50:18] Only like 50 guys having Lebowski's and everyone else is left hanging nothing, doesn't

[50:23] make anyone happy.

[50:24] Magic Girls going out with all the Razzo owners being like this sucks, doesn't make

[50:28] anybody happy, right?

[50:31] Pimball circus, is that even like still going on?

[50:33] I don't even know.

[50:34] Anyway, you know what I'm talking about though.

[50:36] So have a great weekend.

[50:38] Go see Wonder Woman.

[50:39] It's supposed to be amazing.

[50:43] Just enjoy Pimball.

[50:44] Enjoy Pimball.

[50:45] And hit me up at canadapimballatgmail.com.

[50:48] Like the special episode, June 6th.

[50:51] Have a special guest coming on the show who has another Pimball podcast.

[50:55] He's going to join me.

[50:57] And we're going to talk about the stern news that happens on that day because I'm sure

[51:00] it's going to be a lot.

[51:01] And it's going to be fun to talk about it with someone who also takes to the airwaves

[51:05] and discusses Pimball on a frequent basis.

[51:08] So look forward to that.

[51:10] Canada, once again, saying thank you and have a great weekend.

[51:13] I want to ride it all night long.

[51:20] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[51:22] If you are going my way, I want to drive it all night long.

[51:29] Give me, give me, give me, give me, yeah.

[51:32] I'll ride it all night long.
