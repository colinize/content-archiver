[00:00] Time flies, doesn't seem a minute, since the derrily and spa had the chest bars in it.

[00:04] I'll change, don't you know that when you play at this level, there's no ordinary venue.

[00:08] It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings, or this place.

[00:14] Ah, you can't start that song without the chorus, we gotta play it for you right now.

[00:25] Ah, 318.

[00:30] Are you guys ready?

[00:32] We're gonna talk about more about the speculation of rumors of what's gonna happen in 2019.

[00:39] Get ready.

[00:41] All the way in Bangkok.

[00:43] We're still the number one pinball podcast.

[00:46] Let's go everyone.

[00:47] Alright, so here's what we're gonna do on this episode.

[00:49] We're gonna talk more about rumors and speculations of what's gonna happen in 2019,

[00:54] because here's what happens when you reveal some of the things that are rumored to happen.

[00:59] You get an influx of emails and commentary from the inner circle of the pinball clomoon naughty.

[01:06] And I love doing it, because people can't resist sharing with you what they know.

[01:10] So we're gonna talk a lot about that on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:15] Here we go.

[01:16] Alright, so I might have hit my head really bad, and I got something wrong on my last podcast.

[01:21] And I wanna tell you the one big mistake I think I made with my predictions of what Stern will do in 2019.

[01:29] Alright, so here's the deal.

[01:30] The Steve Richie thing is that thing is ironclad, solid information.

[01:33] You're gonna see it at Midwest Gaming Classic.

[01:36] That's gonna happen in mid-April.

[01:38] Alright, they're still very nervous about it.

[01:40] Tim Sexton is doing the coding on the game.

[01:42] So we'll have to see what comes of that title.

[01:45] Now, Jurassic World or Jurassic Park, whichever one it is, I think it's Jurassic World.

[01:49] I'm also hearing that is very good information, and that is most likely gonna come out in 2019.

[01:55] Now, here's the one that had a lot of people reaching out to me and saying,

[02:00] you're wrong, and it's the title that most of you want, and that is JAWS.

[02:05] Now, I'm hearing now that JAWS will not be Brian Eddie's title.

[02:10] I don't know about this.

[02:11] Let me tell you a little bit of a JAWS story and all the different things I've been hearing.

[02:16] So way back when Stern made Ghostbusters, way back when Jody was inking the deal for Ghostbusters,

[02:23] Jody was in conversations with the licensing people at JAWS.

[02:28] And I know he was telling people that if Ghostbusters did well, they would make the JAWS game.

[02:36] Now, I know that for a fact.

[02:38] That was what their plan was to look at Ghostbusters and see how a classic movie like that would do.

[02:44] Kind of a no-brainer.

[02:45] I mean, everyone knows that we've been clamoring for titles like these for all these years.

[02:51] So Ghostbusters did phenomenally well.

[02:54] And so JAWS then became probably next in line in terms of like if you were gonna remake a classic movie

[03:01] that they would heavily consider JAWS.

[03:03] Now, I know from a person that works with all the JAWS people and he said that Stern does have the license for JAWS.

[03:13] That they gobbled it up.

[03:14] Now, Stern is a little bit of a license hoarder.

[03:18] That they have a lot of IPs that they've signed on.

[03:20] Whether or not the games are coming out anytime soon is up for grabs.

[03:25] Because again, I think they smartly will secure licenses that other Pimble manufacturers can't go grab.

[03:32] Now, here's what I'm hearing.

[03:34] I'm hearing that JAWS license is at Stern.

[03:38] But the problem is that the assets available for the movie pretty much would only get people the name JAWS and the shark.

[03:49] And that the other assets from the film would not be available.

[03:54] So whether that's movie clips, whether that's callouts from the actors, whether it's using the actors' voices from the film to be part of the game.

[04:03] I'm hearing that the assets for the movie are extremely limited.

[04:07] And because of that, nobody over at Stern really wants to make the game because they know people will complain about that.

[04:15] And they also know that they can't create a JAWS Pimble machine with the kind of theme integration that people have come to expect and want in Pimble.

[04:25] So that's what I'm hearing is why JAWS won't be the title.

[04:30] So then the big question becomes, well, what is Brian Eddie working on?

[04:35] And I'm here to tell you right now today on Canadian Pimble podcast that nobody knows for sure.

[04:42] Well, I mean, only Brian Eddie and the internals over at Stern know for sure.

[04:46] Stern does a really good job of keeping things private until they actually hit the line.

[04:53] If we were to speculate based on Paul and the other things we've been hearing, there are a few titles that have been coming up now and then Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

[05:04] Strange or things.

[05:06] Is he working on one of those two titles?

[05:08] What if Brian Eddie is working on Jurassic World?

[05:11] You know, what if that's the game and then there's something else coming out?

[05:15] I'm not sure what he's working on, but I know that people are really excited for it.

[05:21] But people have been good on this one.

[05:23] The leaks have stopped.

[05:25] The leaks have stopped on titles past, I think, Jurassic World.

[05:30] Okay.

[05:31] So is it pulp fiction?

[05:32] I don't know.

[05:33] All right. So here's some other news I got.

[05:35] So someone sent me an email because there's, if you notice when we talked about Stern's 2019 plans, the one thing we didn't talk about,

[05:43] which they always do are music pins.

[05:47] Right. We know that there's usually a music pin that Stern releases every year.

[05:52] And we did not talk about that.

[05:54] Now, I think this might fill in that gap.

[05:57] So I got an email from an anonymous email source with a bunch of information on three musical titles that have been in consideration over at Stern Pimbal.

[06:07] And do you want to know what they are?

[06:09] It is Rush.

[06:10] It is Led Zeppelin.

[06:12] And it is Motley Crew.

[06:14] Okay. And in terms of these three, someone sent me some information that had a little bit of a, you know, sort of like a write-up on each.

[06:22] So the rumor of Rush Pimbal has been around the longest.

[06:26] Okay.

[06:27] Now, Dirty Donny was supposedly doing the artwork on a Rush Pimbal machine.

[06:32] Now, where this stands right now is up in the air.

[06:35] In terms of the development of this game, it is very questionable if this game will see the light of day.

[06:41] We know that Dirty Donny is no longer doing Pimbal machines with Stern.

[06:45] He has moved on and working with that other Pimbal circus sort of game that I, the title always eludes me.

[06:54] I need to remember to just write it down on my hand or something.

[06:57] So Donny's out at Stern.

[06:59] Now, if Donny provided art for a Rush Pimbal game, they might not need him anymore.

[07:04] He might be done working on the art packages for the game.

[07:07] But I'm not sure. And I have to say Rush doesn't really excite me.

[07:12] Again, it's, I just didn't grow up listening to any Rush.

[07:15] Now, the other one is Led Zeppelin.

[07:18] And we're hearing that the most likely of these three to get made is Led Zeppelin.

[07:23] So how do you think about that Led Zeppelin Pimbal from Stern?

[07:28] We have heard that Stern has the license to this game.

[07:32] And let's see.

[07:35] So there's also rumor that Stern has been in a bidding war with another manufacturer over Led Zeppelin.

[07:44] But we all know what Stern does with bidding wars is they usually win them.

[07:48] So that apparently Stern has acquired the Led Zeppelin license.

[07:54] And that is also in the works.

[07:56] And the other one is Motley Crew.

[07:59] What we know here is that Stern has acquired the license for Motley Crew.

[08:03] And that is, that is all we know.

[08:07] But okay, so take it for what it's worth.

[08:10] There's a high probability that we will see a Led Zeppelin Pimbal machine from Stern.

[08:16] God, we're really going back.

[08:18] We're really going back further and further into the decades.

[08:22] Led Zeppelin is also very old.

[08:24] What about like Nirvana?

[08:26] There's a lot of, you know, I think I really think people are underestimating when I read on Pinside

[08:33] that when you look at currently in the music landscape, which bands are more popular, guns and roses.

[08:40] I just want to break this down for people.

[08:42] Guns and roses was the number one tour in the world last year.

[08:47] They made $500 million on their not-in-this-life-time tour.

[08:54] If people think that guns and roses is not popular, let me tell you to do some things.

[08:59] Turn on any NFL football game and listen to how many times they play welcome to the jungle during that game or Paradise City.

[09:08] Guns and roses music has remained more culturally relevant over the decades than Led Zeppelin's music has.

[09:17] And by that, I mean, you hear it more.

[09:19] You hear it more in modern sporting events.

[09:23] It's more, it's just more present.

[09:26] And they're also just still on tour and they're all still alive.

[09:29] And slash and axel are still doing their thing.

[09:32] And, you know, look, I know they haven't had a relevant album in a really long time.

[09:37] That's kind of also why guns and roses has remained pretty relevant.

[09:41] It's because they have very few songs.

[09:44] But the songs they do have are freaking incredible.

[09:48] And they have nothing but hits, really.

[09:50] A November rain, don't cry, Paradise City, patience, you could be mine.

[09:56] It's strange, coma.

[09:59] And then all of appetite, rocket queens, sweet child of mine, you know, night train, out to get me.

[10:06] It's so easy. Mr. Brownstone, you know, they're catalogued.

[10:10] And it's so perfect for pinball that I think guns and roses is going to be a humongous hit.

[10:16] And we know slash is working on that with Jersey Jack.

[10:19] So that's 2019 with Stern.

[10:22] All right, anything else I've been hearing?

[10:24] All right, so here we go.

[10:26] I want to talk on this podcast about Jersey Jack.

[10:29] And I did my Stern 2019 reveal show.

[10:34] Now I want to talk about why I think 2019 is going to be the year of Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:42] And I think we all missed it by a year.

[10:44] We all missed it by a year.

[10:46] I thought, remember we thought when they revealed Pirates of the Caribbean that that was going to be it,

[10:50] that it was a dark day for Stern 2018 was a pretty abysmal year for Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:57] It was a year of waiting.

[10:59] It was a year of miss deadlines.

[11:01] It was a year of removing mechanisms from the game.

[11:04] It was a terrible year for them.

[11:06] And Jersey Jack pinball has been around since around what 2011, 2012.

[11:13] I'm here to tell you on Canadian pinball podcast that I think after seven years of trying to figure out this pinball thing after all this time,

[11:22] I think Jersey Jack pinball is finally about to hit it stride.

[11:27] And I think they finally have learned from all their mistakes.

[11:31] I think Jack has finally a strategy and a plan in place to get this company firing on all cylinders.

[11:41] And knocking it out of the park.

[11:43] And I'm really excited for that because I, like many of you, if you really want, if you really want the magic of pinball.

[11:53] And by that, I mean it goes beyond art, it goes beyond code, it goes beyond frequency of releases.

[12:00] It's about the world under glass.

[12:03] And I'll keep saying it.

[12:05] If you want the company to bring the greatest world under glass pinball experiences to life, we all know that it's going to happen from Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:15] Because they approach games to make the best game possible.

[12:19] And I know they don't look at it like we have to hit this bomb at this number.

[12:24] And that's it.

[12:25] We know over at Stern that the target for these designers is a bomb price.

[12:31] I do not think that is the case at Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:34] I think it is also the case why Jersey Jack pinball has stumbled and fumbled for so many years.

[12:41] Because they sometimes over reach.

[12:44] They sometimes are over ambitious.

[12:46] And that also leads to games that can tend to have a lot of problems.

[12:51] And it also makes it a lot harder to manufacture those games when they're much more complex.

[12:57] So you know, it's hard because what we want in a pinball experience might also make it twice as difficult to manufacture those kinds of games.

[13:06] And it also might create twice as many headaches for owners if games keep having problems because of all the complexities of them.

[13:14] But that aside, I think enough time has passed.

[13:20] And I think they've learned a lesson.

[13:22] The biggest indicator of this lesson is that they are going to stop production on pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:30] It is done in March.

[13:32] And this is not a testament to whether the game is good or not.

[13:37] It's Jack has finally learned his lesson.

[13:40] He can't sit on one title for two years.

[13:44] And that be it.

[13:46] If he's looking down the road, if he ordered more pirates parts, if he stockpiled them or just continued to push pirates out,

[13:55] everything would be pushed back because they can't ramp up a new title as fast as Stern can.

[14:02] And they need to do a move like this to get the line ready because he doesn't have as many lines.

[14:09] He doesn't have as many people.

[14:11] He doesn't have as big of a space.

[14:14] He needs to make it more efficient and streamlined to get to the next title and prepare for the next title.

[14:21] So that move to me indicates Jack has learned that lesson.

[14:25] Okay.

[14:26] Now, the pirates of the Caribbean debate will continue to rage on about people saying it's the greatest of all time.

[14:31] I'm glad people feel that way.

[14:33] I'm going to jump on one.

[14:35] I know more people are buying them up now because of the fact that they're going away.

[14:39] And we may never see them again.

[14:41] And if you look at the numbers of pirates of the Caribbean, I am being told that they only made 100 collectors additions, not 250.

[14:50] So 100 were made and that was it.

[14:53] They also in total, the total number of pirates machines that are being made is between 1,000 and 1,200, which would make it the rarest Jersey Jack game to date.

[15:05] Rarity and value and what collectors want.

[15:09] Isn't it interesting I was having a conversation that ultimately it does feel like the games that failed to be successful will end up being the greater games.

[15:21] I just saw someone spend $17,000 last week on an alien Ellie $17,000.

[15:31] That game was supposed to sell for $6,500.

[15:34] It's now over $11,000 on top of the asking price because it's rare.

[15:41] And that's why.

[15:43] And it's from a failed company.

[15:45] Same thing with Predator.

[15:46] If you put up the Predator for sale, it would sell for around the same price.

[15:50] There's a reason why people are asking $20,000 for big Lebowskies.

[15:54] Now, if you go back, if you go back in time,

[15:59] the narrative around really rare games and being very valuable, oftentimes is the same story.

[16:08] It's because companies were failing and shutting down their pinball operations that led to games being only in prototype stage, maybe led to like a kingpin being shelved and a king Kong.

[16:23] And so really, maybe it's always been that way that if you want to create something super valuable, just claim you're going to make a lot of them, then throw your arms up and say, we failed to do it.

[16:34] And then watch your titles sell for a fortune on the second hand market.

[16:39] Imagine Andrew Highway, you know, while he's on his hydrofoil trying to figure out how to get that thing in the ocean in two weeks.

[16:46] Imagine what he feels when he opens up the thread and sees his dream machine is selling for 17 grand.

[16:53] He's got to be kicking himself, but we all know it's only selling for that because of the failure, not because it's worth that much.

[17:00] Oh, and by the way, like he just won't go away.

[17:03] Is he still doping people into investing on that hydrofoil?

[17:07] Okay, but back to Jersey Jack.

[17:09] So here's the thing I'm hearing some more news to I am hearing that Jersey Jack will make yellow brick road edition wizard of Oz is now what I'm hearing post my last show is that there will be more than 250 yellow brick road additions and the reason why is there are going to be new mechanisms in the game or adjusted mechanisms to fix things that weren't really working very well on the original machines now for Jack to do that he has to order parts.

[17:38] Now it doesn't make sense for him to order parts if he's only ordering 250 for that to be cost effective he'd have to charge like 15,000 dollars per machine.

[17:48] So we are going to see most likely 500 yellow brick road wizard of Oz additions.

[17:57] Okay, so not 250 more like 500.

[18:01] Okay, so that's news and I think we're going to see all the details in about three weeks.

[18:07] At Texas Pimball festival.

[18:10] All right, so that is what's going to happen now from there from there the reason why I'm really excited for 2019 and Jersey Jack Pimball is he's got two home runs coming.

[18:22] And if you think Pat Lawler didn't didn't feel the sting and the pain of dialed in.

[18:29] I think we're going to be in for a magical ride with Willie Wonka.

[18:35] I think when I'm hearing what people are saying it's going to be phenomenal.

[18:41] And I also think that when Willie Wonka gets shown to people it's going to be a moment in which I think Jersey Jack and everyone over there is going to finally hit.

[18:52] You know, they're going to hit it out of the park and we all we all have been rooting for Jackson's day one and how can you not like how can you stand over a wizard of Oz machine and not be like wow look at that.

[19:06] How can you I've always said it you put them next to stern machines and it's just it's just it's a whole nother level it's a whole nother level but here's the problem and this is what I I heard this Friday night this past Friday when I was at this amazing.

[19:21] Place of all stern machines and there was one TNA there but it was all stern machines and and the gentleman who has these machines Adam friend of the show he basically said you're just a lot of fun these machines are a lot of fun and you know Jersey Jack machines to a lot of people they just feel like work.

[19:41] It feels like a grind and I think for Jersey Jack to really make it you know a huge success I think they also need to understand why stern games are successful because it's not just about you know jam packing a game with everything you can.

[20:00] There is an approach ability and there is a level of enjoyment that stern games give people right off the bat right when you flip there is and I think with Jersey Jack games it's a lot harder to get into their games and I think we need to see them improve in that area if they want these games to be as successful as they should be based upon the themes that people want right and and I and you have to look no further than pirates it's it's pretty good.

[20:30] It's pretty simple that it's not super intuitive how to play that game and and that's what stern does well is they make their games I think a lot more approachable and there's a reason why there's a reason why people are loving the Beatles so much there is a level of approach ability to that game that is making people say you know what just this is just good old fun the way pinball used to be and all the games that everyone loves from the 90s they were super simple to figure out because they had to be they were in loud and they were in the middle of the game.

[21:00] It's a good old noisy arcades and you had to be able to walk up and and sort of know what to do and the games the games indicated to you how to play them they spoke to you there was a relationship between player and pinball machine that I think is sometimes buried under a mountain of code so if I had a wish for Jersey Jack it would be for Keith to understand how to make games a little bit more approachable when you when you get into them.

[21:26] Yeah you know Lyman sheets is the master at this and I hope that Keith can can understand why Lyman's games are so popular and how Lyman is is able to do both to make a game easy to understand but also give you the depth that you want to own a machine okay so this is the year this is the year for Jersey Jack and Guns and Rose is also going to be a juggernaut title for them and they're going to have slash supporting it it's going to be fucking huge.

[21:54] And Guns and Rose is music and Guns and Rose is pinball machine with modern sound and and and LCD that big I'm excited I don't know about you but I'm really excited for Jersey Jack to make their first music pin it's going to be awesome I do hope that they get the art down because I think if if you look at Jersey Jack right now the only area I'm a little nervous about is with where where their artists can come from because I'm not impressed by their art packages for the most part I think they need to find more stellar artists.

[22:24] For their games and and their stuff tends to look like the olds just looks like Photoshop drag and drop to me it just does like look at pirates it's just it's drawn over photography it's not art and it it should have more art on it like I would I would rather see a huge drawn illustrated black pearl machine or ship on the side of that cabinet versus just a big ugly Photoshop drag than drop

[22:53] drag than drop like squid face dude you know I just don't think the games are as beautiful as they should be I mean Stern is winning in the art department right now okay so but 2019 it's hard to look out there and think that Jersey Jack is not going to have a milestone year now that being said here's what I keep having to remind myself where does deep route fit in to this year like when are they going to rebound to the game

[23:23] feel themselves because if you look at the year and you look at how it's going to unfold it is going to be a I think another huge year for Stern because they always have huge years and Stern Stern knows what they're doing Jersey Jack is going to wake up and finally get it right and then you have deep route which apparently is working on all these magical titles is going to reinvent the game with with with stuff that is going to blow our minds they've set the bar so high and

[23:53] in terms of our expectations but then when and where and how are we going to see these titles T.P.F. missing T.P.F. for them I think was a huge mistake because if you think about it there was really going to be nothing new at T.P.F.

[24:10] they would have had the whole show to themselves you Wizard of Oz a new version of it but the game's not brand new there's might be some new mex October

[24:20] Fest is not new we've already seen it nothing new from spooky nothing new from Stern it would have been their show and now they're not going to be there and so then where they're going to be are they going to go to

[24:32] Pimberg are they're not going to go to the Midwest gaming classic and and Texas is their state like they're made in Texas all the people are there there there I think they're like near even T.P.F.

[24:45] So when will we see it and and the bigger question is is there going to be a market for their games if you have juggernaut IPs from Stern and Jersey Jack ready to go and here's the other part is people want to have faith and trust in your company

[25:06] and people have been burned by pinball startups so many times before will people trust that if they buy a game from a new company that the quality will be there the support will be there and the long term viability of that company will be there because people do want to feel confident that down the road they'll be able to get parts for these machines if they're going to invest in them

[25:33] and look I think Jersey Jack and Stern also have two things that deep route does not have right now and that's a fan base and in any industry having a fan base and having supporters and having loyalist is really important and you know you get that over time because you create something of value and people then support you and I think that those two companies have a lot of support

[26:01] and a lot of people are fans of both let's let's not act like this is the red socks and the Yankees people do root for both companies to make great games the majority of people do the majority of people will walk into a distributor and they'll just buy the game that they're having the most fun playing there isn't this like allegiance to one or the other obviously Jersey Jack games are more expensive their their ability to attract customers is smaller than Stern remember you can get a Stern pinball machine for almost half a year

[26:31] half of the price of a Jersey Jack game and Stern smartly is selling their L.E.s which I still consider to be like L.E.s today are like Stern pros from from 10 15 years ago it is amazing how little are in them or is in them but look that's just we all know that's what's happening Stern's been able to sell it a premium price because no one else has been able to get their shit together so that being said will deep route be able to create fandom and it wasn't off they weren't off to a

[27:01] good start because you know hiring J. Pop as much as we keep hearing what a great guy is a lot of people in the in the enthusiast part of this hobby a lot of them will not

[27:13] forgiven forget what John did to people even if they're able to solve the issues of J. Pop's games you're still going to have some people that are going to just you know

[27:22] on principal loan not go in on anything he makes a not support a company that he's a part of now look I don't think that's gonna be the majority of people buy any means but you're gonna lose

[27:32] some people like you're already starting out with with with a loss of some potential buyers but look if Magic Girls amazing I think it'll sell

[27:40] well but here's here's what I heard here's what I heard and I can get an email saying this is correct or not when Robert was shopping

[27:47] around deep root to people.

[27:50] And he met with like spooky,

[27:51] and he met with other manufacturers sort of like,

[27:54] you know, to gauge their interest

[27:55] in possibly manufacturing magic girl,

[27:58] the numbers they were expecting to sell

[28:01] or putting on paper,

[28:02] were,

[28:03] boba, he wanted his treats.

[28:05] I think Bren is mad at me

[28:06] because I keep giving him treats to get him outside.

[28:07] Anyway, here's the number that I heard

[28:10] that deep root was shopping around

[28:12] in terms of what they expected magic girl sales to be.

[28:14] It was around two to three thousand units

[28:17] that they were telling manufacturers would sell

[28:20] if they made magic girl.

[28:22] And how do you predict?

[28:24] And again, this is a guessing game.

[28:26] How do you predict how many games will sell

[28:28] of an original IP?

[28:29] I think it's nearly impossible.

[28:32] You know, again, because they're a brand new company.

[28:35] They've never made a single pinball machine.

[28:37] How could they accurately know

[28:39] that the hundreds, if not thousands of potential buyers?

[28:43] What are they going off of?

[28:45] The only companies that really know the demand for games

[28:50] is our companies that have been making games

[28:52] for a long time and they have information and data

[28:55] and insights coming back to them

[28:58] from distributors on here's the demand.

[29:00] And Stern knows it really well.

[29:02] Stern knows exactly if we do this, this is what we'll sell.

[29:05] That is why Stern is extremely nervous

[29:08] around Steve Richie's game

[29:09] because it's uncharted waters for them.

[29:13] They don't know and they're really nervous

[29:15] because they know it's probably,

[29:17] how is Steve Richie's game going to look in a lineup

[29:20] when someone walks into a distributor to buy a new game

[29:23] and you've got Batman, Guardians, Ghostbusters,

[29:26] Star Wars and Black Knight 3000.

[29:29] Which one is going to be like, oh, I need to have this.

[29:31] And they know that's going to be the case.

[29:34] As much as the die-hards on Pinside

[29:36] who grew up with Steve Richie's games are like,

[29:38] yeah, make it.

[29:40] They're like 5% of the pinball buying community

[29:45] and that's why Stern's nervous.

[29:46] Now, Magic Girls the same way.

[29:48] Within a vacuum of Pinside and the enthusiast group,

[29:52] John Papaduke is a star, but 90% or more

[29:56] of people who are buying games today.

[29:59] They don't know who the fuck John Papaduke is.

[30:02] They don't care.

[30:04] And you might say, well, that's a good thing

[30:06] because then they'll want one.

[30:07] I don't know though, people will not have

[30:10] an emotional attachment to an original IP,

[30:13] the same way they will to a theme based on something

[30:17] that they grew up loving.

[30:18] And it's just that simple, okay?

[30:21] All right, so that's what I, when I think about 2019,

[30:24] I'm like, well, where does Deeproot fit in?

[30:26] What do you think?

[30:27] I mean, I would love to know when they're going to do it.

[30:31] And what I missed about the five days of Deeproot

[30:34] is they gave us a target.

[30:36] They gave us a moment in which we were supposed

[30:39] to get excited for the launch of something.

[30:41] You know, waiting for Deeproot feels like waiting

[30:44] for the Avatar movies.

[30:45] Like it's just, it's a moving target now.

[30:47] Could it could happen any time this year?

[30:50] It might not happen this year at all.

[30:52] But with what's coming out from Jersey Jack and Stern in 2019,

[30:56] I'm telling you, there's not enough money to go around.

[30:59] I know everybody wants, almost everybody I talk to

[31:02] wants a Willy Wonka.

[31:04] If Stern makes a stranger things game,

[31:06] if they make a Jurassic World game,

[31:08] there's gonna be thousands and thousands of people

[31:11] that want these games.

[31:13] And then on top of that, you've got to sell your Deeproot games.

[31:17] On top of that, you've got to sell October fest.

[31:20] Let's talk about that for a minute.

[31:22] How does that game regain fanbase?

[31:26] How does it gain some momentum in 2019?

[31:30] I don't know.

[31:31] I really don't know.

[31:32] I feel bad for these games that are on the outside looking in

[31:39] in terms of the games people are hyped to play.

[31:41] And that's where we're at.

[31:43] It's, there was a window.

[31:45] There was a window in which October fest,

[31:47] I think, needed to come out.

[31:50] And that window is the month of October.

[31:53] It should have been out in September, October.

[31:56] How do you launch a game based on a festival

[32:02] that happens in October?

[32:03] How do you bring it out in spring, summer?

[32:06] On some just common senseical level,

[32:09] somebody over there needs to be like, we fucked up.

[32:13] Like, we brought out our Christmas game in July.

[32:16] We brought out October fest in the spring.

[32:20] What?

[32:21] Like, how does that even happen?

[32:23] You have all the ability to control when you release a game.

[32:28] And, you know, they revealed it in October

[32:30] at the end of October, but October, November, December,

[32:36] January, February, March, six months later

[32:40] after the game was revealed, it's still not shipping.

[32:43] Six months, you know, let's talk about spooky and waiting.

[32:48] And the days of waiting forever to get your pinball machine,

[32:52] man, those days are over.

[32:53] Go into the spooky thread.

[32:54] People are pissed.

[32:56] People are really upset.

[32:58] People will not do this again with Chuck.

[33:00] I said this from the very beginning,

[33:02] Charlie locking people in with these non-refundable $1,000

[33:07] deposits was the biggest mistake for customers to go in on.

[33:12] And yes, while it helps him out, look at what happened.

[33:17] It's been a year, a full year since they revealed the game.

[33:22] And now they're finally making, I think, six of them a week.

[33:28] And they're making 500 of them.

[33:31] And here's the part that sucks for everybody.

[33:35] If you're like number, let's say you're number 237

[33:40] on the list to get your Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[33:42] Okay, there's a very good chance you've never played it

[33:46] and yet your money is locked in.

[33:48] There's a very good chance you've played other pinball

[33:50] machines that you might just want instead,

[33:51] like a monster bash remake or a monster's

[33:53] or whatever else has come out in a year

[33:55] or you might even want.

[33:56] By the time you get your machine,

[33:58] if you're number 237, by the time your machine

[34:00] is even ready to ship, you will probably see Willy Wonka,

[34:04] you'll probably see Jurassic World, you'll probably see

[34:08] other titles, maybe deep root titles.

[34:11] The options will be out there,

[34:12] October Fest will be available, but you're locked in.

[34:16] You can't get your money back.

[34:17] Okay, that sucks.

[34:18] Why would you do that?

[34:19] Right?

[34:20] Okay, the other part that sucks is this,

[34:21] this is the part that really sucks.

[34:23] If you want an Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[34:26] and your guy number 237, you're locked in.

[34:30] You know what you're seeing?

[34:32] People are selling spot like 35,

[34:34] for less than $1,000.

[34:36] Right?

[34:37] Just think about that for a minute.

[34:38] You can go get the game for less than you paid for

[34:42] today, a year after you locked in your deposit,

[34:46] you can actually get, it's actually selling for cheaper

[34:49] before it's even made.

[34:50] Think about that.

[34:52] So why did anybody do it?

[34:54] Why didn't anyone, anybody, like,

[34:56] the fear of missing out, they're only making 500.

[34:59] I'm telling you, the spooky model of this

[35:02] was ridiculous from the very beginning.

[35:05] People didn't play the game.

[35:07] I think there's something, you know, TNA saved this company.

[35:12] It saved it.

[35:13] It was, they had nothing.

[35:16] Chuck had nothing to go on the line.

[35:19] And that's okay, like they did the right thing

[35:21] to keep the line going,

[35:23] but Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle,

[35:25] I think, is going to go down as a painful experience

[35:28] for people when you finally get the game,

[35:32] you probably will realize what a lot of people

[35:35] have been saying, no one can say it in volume yet

[35:39] because most people haven't played it.

[35:41] I mean, good luck.

[35:42] The game is, it looks pretty.

[35:45] It looks pretty, the animations are the best part.

[35:48] But I think you're gonna realize it's not the best shooter,

[35:51] but you're stuck.

[35:52] You gotta buy it.

[35:53] And people can't leave.

[35:56] They have to wait for their game.

[35:58] They're locked in.

[35:59] No other manufacturer has ever locked you in

[36:02] in a binding non-refundable way like spooky.

[36:06] And I think it's gonna create ill will, not good will.

[36:09] And Chuck's company is all about good will.

[36:14] And because, as I've said, the games are not on the same level

[36:18] as Stern Pro's and not even close to the other manufacturer

[36:22] stuff that's out there.

[36:23] And so they need to ride the good will.

[36:25] Now, the other game that was supposed to come out

[36:28] was Evil Dead.

[36:31] Was going to be the game that Ben Heck brought out.

[36:34] Now, you know why they didn't do it?

[36:35] It's simple.

[36:36] It's simple.

[36:37] To get the license for Evil Dead,

[36:39] spooky needed to increase the price of each game

[36:42] by 200 to 250 bucks.

[36:44] And Chuck wouldn't do it.

[36:45] And so that's why you're not getting Evil Dead

[36:48] as a spooky game.

[36:49] And how hard would it have been

[36:51] for Chuck to just increase the price a little bit

[36:53] and bring Evil Dead to the masses?

[36:56] Which is at least a theme that I know a lot of people

[36:58] are excited about.

[37:00] I'm not into that whole horror genre,

[37:02] but I know people are.

[37:03] I know people are.

[37:04] So look, 2019, man, it is gonna be a really exciting year

[37:10] for Pinball.

[37:11] I think 2018 was kind of a dead, dead year.

[37:15] I do.

[37:15] I look at 2018.

[37:17] And when I fill out the Twitties,

[37:18] I'd say these titles, you know,

[37:20] Iron Maiden obviously rises to the top,

[37:22] Pirates of the Caribbean finally came out

[37:24] at the end of the year.

[37:25] But for the most part, I think 2018 wasn't the best year

[37:28] in Pinball by far.

[37:30] But 2019, my gosh.

[37:32] Oh, god, they look at the titles coming out.

[37:35] Look at what the battleground is laid out.

[37:38] Willy Wank, a Guns in Roses, Magic Girl, October Fest,

[37:44] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, Jurassic World,

[37:48] Steve Richie original game, Pirates of the Caribbean,

[37:51] the final run.

[37:53] All this is happening in 2019,

[37:54] Yellowbrook Road Edition, Guns in Roses.

[37:58] All right, who knows?

[37:59] Maybe Toy Story at the end of the year.

[38:00] Who knows what's happening?

[38:01] El Vira 3 maybe.

[38:03] So many titles.

[38:05] And deep roots promising multiple titles.

[38:07] So we'll see what happens.

[38:09] And that's just like, you know,

[38:11] we've still got P3 around.

[38:13] We've still got all these other manufacturers

[38:15] that are promising games.

[38:16] It's Kingpin gonna come out.

[38:18] What's next from Chicago Gaming Company?

[38:20] Are they gonna have something by the end of the year?

[38:22] I love it.

[38:23] I love it.

[38:24] But, but, I do think, I do think this is the year

[38:29] of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[38:31] I think they've learned their lesson.

[38:33] And I really want to own a Jersey Jack machine.

[38:38] I do.

[38:39] I've always wanted to own one.

[38:40] I don't know about how you guys feel,

[38:41] but I always want to own one.

[38:42] But there's always just something keeping me

[38:45] from pulling the trigger on one.

[38:47] You know, there's something magical about Batman.

[38:49] There's just something fun about Batman

[38:52] that I enjoy.

[38:54] I mean, to Stern's credit, I have a Batman.

[38:57] It's a game that it's not completely original.

[39:00] It's a re-themed of an older Batman game.

[39:03] But here's what I love about Batman.

[39:05] It's so easy to play.

[39:07] It's easy to get into.

[39:09] It's easy to understand.

[39:11] It reminds me why I love the TV show.

[39:13] I think it's probably one of the best codes.

[39:15] If not the best code in any Pinball machine ever,

[39:19] the theme integration is incredible.

[39:21] It looks like a work of art when I'm not playing it.

[39:24] It does look like a world under glass

[39:25] when you put all the mods on it.

[39:27] Even though I wish the ball interacted

[39:30] with more in the game for sure.

[39:32] But also what I love about Batman is I've had it for,

[39:36] like, 18 months.

[39:38] And I haven't had a lift the play field in an entire year.

[39:43] I've never had to fix anything on it.

[39:45] It's worked flawlessly and it's my only game.

[39:48] I play it all the time and nothing has broken on the machine.

[39:52] And that is why Stern is Stern.

[39:56] They make these games and again, they sell maybe 10,000 a year.

[40:02] And the issues people have with them

[40:04] are very few and far between.

[40:06] And you have to applaud them for that.

[40:08] I don't want to have to be fixing my machine.

[40:11] I am terrified.

[40:13] I gotta be honest, I'm terrified when I open up

[40:16] the Pirates of the Caribbean thread.

[40:18] And I read about all the issues.

[40:20] It's, there's nothing fun about feeling

[40:24] that your game is gonna probably have many of those issues.

[40:28] And I don't want to be ripping apart treasure chest.

[40:31] I don't want to be taking upper play fields off.

[40:34] I don't want to have to be soldering wires back on.

[40:36] I don't want to have to be fixing switches all the time.

[40:39] I don't want a pinball machine

[40:42] that I have to constantly fix.

[40:44] I don't want to have to swap in quieter gears

[40:48] on the spinning disc.

[40:50] I don't want to have to have a topper

[40:51] that's super loud and annoying

[40:53] where I then need to like fix it myself.

[40:56] That whole game when I look at the thread,

[40:58] it feels like the consumers have to fix the issues

[41:02] from the factory.

[41:04] And I hope Jack fixes that shit with Willie Wonka.

[41:07] Now we know that Pat Lawler is a stickler

[41:12] for making sure his games get ample testing.

[41:15] And he puts his games out for testing.

[41:18] He did it with dialed in, but that's still had issues too,

[41:21] but not as many, considering how much is in dialed in,

[41:24] I think they're, the issues out of the box

[41:27] for Wizard of Oz, sorry, the out of the box issues,

[41:30] I think were the worst on Pirates of the Caribbean

[41:33] than any other machine that Jack has made.

[41:35] They've all had issues.

[41:36] I mean, there are issues with the trolls and Hobbit.

[41:38] And that's part of Pimball, but again,

[41:41] where we're at with Pimball now is,

[41:44] people don't want to have to do that shit ever.

[41:47] And Stern is making games that require very little

[41:50] lifting of the play field.

[41:51] Again, every once in a while we know

[41:52] there are some issues here and there,

[41:53] but for the most part, Stern games,

[41:56] they hold together and they don't require people

[42:00] to do too much work.

[42:02] And that's why Stern is very successful

[42:05] because I think people's experiences with them

[42:08] have been very good for the most part.

[42:10] They have been, so exciting time.

[42:12] What else going on?

[42:13] I think that's it, you know?

[42:16] Nate Schivers is back, it's great.

[42:18] He has a new episode up.

[42:19] Head to head has a new episode up.

[42:21] Just check it out.

[42:22] I mean, I just want Ryan to come back to the show.

[42:24] Ryan, come on.

[42:25] He like joins his own show as a guest

[42:27] and then he pieces out in the middle of the show.

[42:29] Who's, so it's head to head,

[42:31] but who's head is heading to who's head, you know?

[42:34] Just join, just come back.

[42:36] Come back.

[42:37] Let's bury the hatchet again.

[42:38] I keep extending the olive branch.

[42:40] I, let's do, let's do a show together.

[42:42] Let's do a special one lit head to head.

[42:45] Can you just pinball podcasts, Royal Rumble?

[42:47] We'll get the slam tilt guys in.

[42:49] And let's all have some fun.

[42:51] Oh man, I don't want to have to, you know,

[42:53] how far the Twippies next year

[42:55] can't happen at the end of March.

[42:57] It's too, it's too far away.

[43:00] It's still a month from now.

[43:02] I mean, it just feels forever and a day.

[43:05] By the time we're recognizing 2018 titles,

[43:08] it just feels like we've already moved past it all.

[43:12] Like even the Academy Awards just happened.

[43:15] I mean, even that pushes it for like movies from 2018.

[43:18] But man, oh man, oh man.

[43:20] I wish I could speed up time and we could just do it.

[43:22] I kind of told like Zach, I was like, man,

[43:25] just do like the freaking Twitch show again

[43:27] or YouTube show like in December.

[43:29] Like it was just such a fun year end thing to do.

[43:32] I know this was ambitious.

[43:33] I know the show's gonna be great.

[43:35] I'm not taking anything away from it.

[43:37] But man, it's just like, I just,

[43:38] like it's just, we're just waiting.

[43:40] I don't like to wait.

[43:42] Can you tell that?

[43:43] I'd like to just get episodes up for you guys every week,

[43:45] three times a week if I can.

[43:47] All right, we're gonna get some more guests on the show soon.

[43:50] But other than that, everybody,

[43:52] it's gonna be a great 2019.

[43:53] We'll talk to you soon.

[43:54] This has been episode, I think like 318

[43:57] of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[43:59] Let's go back to Bangkok.

[44:00] One night in Bangkok,

[44:02] in the world,

[44:03] star,

[44:03] iceberg,

[44:05] the boss on temples,

[44:06] but the pulsing free.

[44:09] You'll find a garden,

[44:11] every golden,

[44:12] iceberg,

[44:14] a little special,

[44:15] little story.

[44:18] I can feel an angel sliding to me.

[44:21] One night in Bangkok makes a fun man,

[44:24] fun,

[44:26] and I'm pushed between despair and ecstasy.

[44:30] One night in Bangkok,

[44:31] I can't stop guys,

[44:33] Tom Boy,

[44:34] can't be together with your company.

[44:39] I can feel the zephyl walking next to me.
