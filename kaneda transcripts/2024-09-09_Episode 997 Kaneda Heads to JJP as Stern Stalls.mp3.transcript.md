[00:00] Already Pullin' Me In, Already Under My Skin, And I Know Exactly How This Ends Like,

[00:08] Let's You Cut Me Open, Just Do What We Play, Game of Blue, Whatever You Wanted Me to Play.

[00:18] Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera.

[00:48] Jersey Jack, Pimball, All Expense, Pay Trip, Up To A Certain Amount of Money.

[00:54] Now Nobody Told Jersey Jack That Canada Likes to Fly First Class, So I'm Not Going to be

[01:00] able to Fly That Way, But We're Going to Go Over to JJP, I Say Words, Going to Be Me and

[01:06] Other Pimball Media, And We're Going to Get to Play the Game.

[01:09] Now Look, I Know Some People Have Been Saying Like, If I Go To Jersey Jack, And If They

[01:14] Introduce Me to Their New Pimball Machine, That I'm Going to Be a Shill for the Game.

[01:20] And I Just Want to Tell You This Right Now, That's Not Going to Be The Case, But Also,

[01:24] I Do Find It Weird That Some People Out There Are So Negative And So Toxic That They Want

[01:31] Me To Refuse This Trip And What? Just Like Slam The Company And Its Products, I Just Want

[01:39] To Say This, Each And Every One of Us Should Be In This Hobby Because We Enjoy Pimball, We Enjoy

[01:47] Every New Game That Comes Out, And I Don't Mean Like We Like The Game, I Just Mean That We Enjoy

[01:53] The Moment That A New Pimball Machine Comes Into The World Because It Gives Us Something New

[01:58] To Talk About, It Gives Us A New Game That Maybe We Might Buy It, Maybe We Won't, Maybe We Love It,

[02:05] Maybe We Hate It, But It Gives Us A New Reason To Connect With Each Other And That's Why A New

[02:12] Pimball Week Is Exciting For Everybody. We Also Get To See What These Companies For This Much Money

[02:19] Have Put Into A Machine. Now We Know, You Know, I Know That Jersey Jack Knows They Need To Load

[02:27] This Game Up. They've Had Like Two To Three Games In A Row Where We Did Not See 12 To $15,000 Of

[02:35] A Magical Pimball Experience. And So Avatar The Battle For Pandora, We Know It's Got Six Flippers,

[02:42] We Know It's Got Bioluminescent Lighting, We Know It's Got Two Lower Playfields, I Think It Has One

[02:48] Upper Playfield, It's Going To Have A Lot Going On. Now Look, Will The Some Of The Parts Equal A

[02:54] Magical Pimball Experience? That Is What I'm Going To Find Out On Friday. And Look, We All Know That

[03:01] A First Impression Standing Over A Brand New Pimball Machine Is Going To Be More Positive Than

[03:07] Negative. And It's Easy To Sit Back And On The Internet, See Something Complain About Something

[03:13] And Never Engage With Something. So I Do Think This Is A Smart Move By Jersey Jack Pimball To

[03:19] Invite People Over There To Play The Game. Because Guess Which Company Didn't Invite People Over

[03:25] To Play The Game The Day After They Revealed It? Stern Pimball. I Want To Talk About That For A

[03:30] Minute Because I Think Stern Pimball Is Stalling On X-Men. We Have Seen The Game, It Looks Cool,

[03:38] It's Beautiful, But Where Is The Stream? Where Is The Actual Gameplay Of The Uncanny X-Men

[03:45] By Stern Pimball? It Really Rubbs Me The Wrong Way That Clearly Stern Is Trying To Lock In As Many

[03:53] Ellie Orders Of This Game As They Possibly Can. And Nobody, And I Mean This Nobody That Is Ordered

[04:01] In Uncanny X-Men Ellie Has Seen A Single Footage Of Real Gameplay. Nobody Has Seen What The Code Is

[04:10] Like, What The Callouts Are Like, What The Gameplay Is Like, And It's A Radically New Design From Stern

[04:17] Pimball. And So This This Sort Of Rubbs Me The Wrong Way Because As Cool As It Is And It Is A Unique

[04:22] Creative Cool New Layout For Stern Pimball, It's An Extreme Departure From The Normal Layouts That Each

[04:29] And Every One Of Us Are Used To. And Look, There's A Reason Why Most Pimball Machines Are Not Layed

[04:35] Out This Way. It Might Not Be As Fun As You Think. The Code Might Not Be Nearly Far Enough Along

[04:43] For You To Want To Own The Game Right Now. And Yet They Want To Sell You The Game Right Now. It's Just

[04:49] Weird To Me Too Because It's Like Jack Danger Is The World's Greatest Pimball Streamer. This Is His Game.

[04:56] They Revealed This Game To The World Last Wednesday. There's Not Even On The Books This Week A Date By

[05:04] Which Stern Pimball Is Going To Stream X-Men And Yet They Will Take Your Money. And We Know On Thursday

[05:12] We Are Going To See Jersey Jack Pimball's Avatar. So It's Really Not Even A Good Week To Stream X-Men

[05:19] And Maybe They Might Let Jersey Jack Have The Spotlight This Week. But Again, Another Sort Of Quick FOMO

[05:27] Cash Grab Move By Stern Pimball. And I Looked Around And I'm Here To Tell You Right Now,

[05:33] It's Not Sold Out. Some Distributors Are Sold Out But There Are Many Distros And Dealers

[05:39] That Still Have An LE New Inbox That You Can Get Even With All The Creativity All The Uniqueness

[05:46] It Just Does Feel Like FOMO Right The Need To Get It Right Away It's Gone Right And We All Know This

[05:54] Do You Really Think X-Men At $13,000 Is Ever Gonna Be Worth Anywhere Near That A Year From Now.

[06:04] I Just Saw A James Bond LE People Swear By James Bond It's One Of Stern's Best Ever. A James Bond

[06:11] LE Which Is $13,000 With A Topper Which Was $1,000 Is Now Selling For Like $9,700 That's A $4,300

[06:24] Loss On A James Bond Game In Just What A Little Over A Year Maybe It's A Little Bit More Than That

[06:30] And I Just Don't Understand Right As Much As I Want To Welcome All Of These New Games With Open Arms

[06:38] The Price Continues To Hang Over This Entire Hobby Like A Dark Cloud And Nobody's Addressing It Nobody's

[06:46] Lowered Price And So As I Get Ready To Go To Jersey Jack It Is Easily Going To Be A Tall Order

[06:55] For Them To Deliver A Game That When You See It And When You Play It And When You Experience It

[07:03] It Has To Blow Us Away To Write A Check For $12,000 For The Mass Produced Version Of The Game

[07:13] And It Really Has To Be Something Truly Special That Is Unlike Any Other Pinball Experience We

[07:19] Have Ever Had To Warrant Going In On A $15,000 Collectors Edition Of The Game Here's The Problem

[07:28] They're Gonna Have Is We Both Know That The $15,000 Version Of The Game Will Pretty Much Be

[07:37] Exactly The Same Gameplay Experience The Lighting Will Be The Same The Shot Layout Will Be The

[07:43] Same The Artwork Will Be Similar Enough Maybe They Do It Differently This Time Because I Don't

[07:48] Think They're Gonna Be Using Any Of That Gold Sparkle Which Has Been The Traditional Difference

[07:52] Between The CE And The Ele or Platinum But Is There Gonna Be $3,000 Difference Between Those

[08:00] Two Games Now The Good News If You Spend $15,000 On A Jersey Jack Or Even $12,000 Your Game Is

[08:07] Gonna Come With Everything You're Really Ever Gonna Want For It It's Gonna Come With The Toppers

[08:13] It's Gonna Come With Inner Artblades And Now It's Even Gonna Come With Radcals On The Platinum

[08:19] Edition Of The Game I Can't Say The Same For Stern And What's Crazy About Stern You Guys Know This

[08:26] When Stern First Introduced Limited Edition Games And By That You Know Their Limited Edition Games

[08:33] Back In The Day Had Different Artwork Different Translights Like A Real Mirrored Backglass Translight

[08:40] It Had Differences Right And They Only Made 500 Do You Know Back In The Day When Stern First

[08:47] Introduced Limited Edition Games The Price Difference Between The LE And The Premium

[08:54] Was Around $500 Nowadays The Price Difference Between The LE And The Premium Because The

[09:04] Map Pricing On A Premium Is $9,500 The Difference Is $3,500 This Is Stupid Right It Just Doesn't

[09:15] Make Any Sense $3,500 Ladies And Gentlemen Is The Entire Bomb Of What Stern Is Putting Into Their

[09:24] Machines And That's The Other Issue To You And That's Why I Think All These LEs With Stern Are Just

[09:29] Kind Of Dying Is Just All These LEs Are Kind Of Pointless Because The Premiums Look Just As Good Now

[09:36] The Entire Game Is There And You Even Heard Jack Danger Say Like We're Gonna Release Some Of This

[09:41] Stuff As Additional Accessories You Can Get Armor That's Gonna Look Exactly The Same If You Powder

[09:47] Code It The Same Color You Can Get The Shooter Rob The Inner RD Cals You Can Get The Speaker

[09:53] Lights All The Stuff You Can Get Additionally And Yeah Even Though It's Not An LE You Can Still

[10:00] Add All The Stuff I Just Think It's All Kind Of Jump The Shark I Think What We Need Is This I Think

[10:06] We Need A Stern Pro To Be $6,000 I Think A Stern Premium Should Be $8,500 And I Think A Stern LE

[10:16] Should Be $10,500 I Think That Is The Sweet Spot For Stern Pinball If They Keep Doing It Like

[10:23] This I'm Telling You There's Gonna Be An Overall Decline And Who Buys Their Products And The Entire

[10:29] Pinball Market Is Just Gonna Keep Collapsing Slowly People Are Out Of Room You Can See It And If People

[10:37] Want To Go Get The New Game They Got A Free Up Space With The Old Game And Nobody Wants To Continue

[10:43] To Lose So Much Money On Every Single Game Now When We Go Over To Jersey Jack Pinball A Similar

[10:49] Issue Is Happening If They Think They're Gonna Sell 1000 Abitars I Don't Care How Much This Game

[10:56] Glows I Don't Care How Cool The Topper Is This Is Not A Theme Everybody's Been Waiting For I Don't

[11:02] Even Know How It's Humanly Possible For Them To Sell A Thousand CEs At $15,000 A Pop I Think What

[11:10] Needs To Happen Is This Jersey Jack Needs To Go Back And Make The Entry Level Of The Game Somewhere

[11:16] Around $10,500 And The Collector's Edition 13,000 Make It An Even 13 And Like 10,5 For The Regular

[11:25] Edition Of The Game And I Think You'll See Such A Different Response To Everything Both Of These

[11:31] Companies Are Doing And Raise Of Hands For Each And Every One Of You Out There How Many Of You

[11:37] Right It's Only Been Less Than A Week How Many Of You Your FOMO Around The Uncanny X Men Has

[11:44] Already Disappeared How Many Of You On Launch Day Were Giddy Like School Girls Right We Were Just

[11:50] All Going Crazy We Were All Running At It We Were All Like Sterns Back The Second Coming Of Pinball

[11:57] Is Here And If You Just Wait And See You Wait A Week What Happens You Know You've Been Staring At

[12:03] The Game But You Haven't Seen Any Gameplay And Now All Of A Sudden Your Enthusiasm For It Sort Of Falls

[12:10] Apart A Little Bit And I'll Tell You Where It Fell Apart For Me I Was Going To Grab An Le And

[12:15] Offered Up To One Of My Canada Club Members Because I Thought The Game Would Easily Sell Out And An

[12:21] Interesting Thing Happened I Had A Distributor They Held Me In Addition Of The Game And They Sent Me

[12:27] An Invoice For The Game Because This Is How It Normally Works I Would Buy The Game And Then I

[12:32] Would Do My Canada Club Sort Of Raffle To Get An Le Spot It Was So Much Fun When I Would Do That And

[12:38] I Did It Multiple Times In The Past And Two Things Happened One I Realized That They Were Not Sold

[12:46] Out So Nobody Would Really Want To Win A Canada Raffle For A Chance To Get An Le When The Le's

[12:52] Are Not Even Hard To Get And The Other Thing That Happened Was This I Opened Up My Email And I

[12:59] Saw An Invoice And There Was Just Something About Seeing That Invoice Before Even Seeing Any Gameplay

[13:06] Before Even Knowing If The Game's Code Is Good Or The Magic Is There And This New Sort Of Layout Is

[13:12] Going To Be Entertaining I Saw This Invoice For $12,999 Pay Now For A Single Pimball Experience

[13:24] And I Just Sort Of Frozen It's Too Much Money You Know I've Got A Lot Going On In My World I've Got

[13:32] A Lot Of Expenses I've Got A Lot Of Things I Want To Do And I Just Thought About It For A Minute

[13:38] Imagine If I Put $13,000 Into A Fund For My Children On Every Single New Stern Le Launch

[13:50] What Would Make Me Happier In Life Right I Have A Pimball Machine I Love I'm Definitely Going To Add

[13:56] Another Pimball Machine Or Two To The Mix But Why Would I Spend This Much Money On Something That I Know

[14:05] Would Never Bring Me The Level Of Satisfaction I Would Get If I Use That Money For A Better Cause

[14:12] And Yes Of Course I'm Putting Money Away For My Children's Future And Yes I Have Money In The Bank

[14:18] And Yes I Could Easily Snap My Fingers And Buy A $13,000 Pimball Machine But For Me It's Just Become

[14:25] The Principal That The Experience Of These Games Especially After You Have A Lineup Of Great Machines

[14:33] To Go In On A New One When You Already Have So Many Great Ones At These Prices Is Really The Pinch

[14:43] I Think All Of Us Are Feeling For Some Of You It's Just Space Right I Mean If You Want To Move X-Men In

[14:49] Or Avatar In You Gotta Move Something Out And If You've Ever Moved A Jersey Jack Machine Into

[14:54] Your House You Know It's Something You Don't Want To Do Many Times In Your Life Because Of How Heavy The

[15:00] Damn Thing Is Going To Be And If They Attach This Topper To Avatar Looks Like A Huge Topper On That Backbox

[15:07] That's Going To Be Something You're Going To Really You Better Have A Single Level Entrance

[15:11] Into Your Game Room Because It's Not Something You're Ever Going To Want To Go Up A Stair With Or Around

[15:17] A Corner But Here We Are Right Here We Are This Is The Modern Pimball World I Think Each And Every

[15:23] One Of Us Looks At Every New Launch With A Little Bit Of Skepticism Now Because Of The Pricing And We're

[15:30] Still Waiting I Mean This When I Say This We're Still Waiting For A Game That Gets It All Right Like A

[15:37] Theme We Want An Integration We Want Mechanical Magic We Want And The Price Is Right All Of That Comes

[15:45] Together You Know The Other Thing I've Been Thinking About Recently Too Is Like How Long Will All Of Our

[15:50] Nostalgia For The Things We Grew Up With How Long Will It Last You Know The Thing Is This Too Is Like We've

[15:57] Just Been Bombarded Culturally With So Much Nostalgia And Remakes And We're Going To Do This And Another

[16:05] Version Of That And This And More Marvel More Star Wars More This More That More Everything I Think It's

[16:11] Leading To A Point In Culture And I Mean This Outside Of Pimball I Just Mean Culturally I Think We're

[16:17] All Exhausted I Think We're Exhausted By All Of It Like Even Just Buying Pimball Machines Or Collecting

[16:24] Old 80s And 90s Arcade Machines I Got Heavily Into That I'm Looking At These Neo Geo Machines I Never

[16:31] Turn Them On I'm Thinking About All The Stuff My Brother Has At His House The Punch Out The Donkey Kong

[16:37] The Street Fighter 2 All The Energy Around Putting These Nostalgic Arcades And Vids Into Our Homes I

[16:45] Feel Like All Of That Too Has Become Tiresome And Like We All Got Bit By The Bug Years

[16:52] Ago We Realized We Could Turn Our Homes Into Arcades But In The End I Mean This In The End It

[16:58] Ultimate Leaves You With A Little Bit Of A Shallow Feeling And It Is Sort Of A Hollow Existence To Have

[17:05] All These Things And Yet Nobody Really To Play Them With And That's What It Becomes And They Will

[17:12] Never Ever Ever Give You Even An Ounce Of The Excitement You Felt When You Were A Kid And You Were Young

[17:20] And You Walked Into An Arcade And There That New Game Was And You Had Your Pocket Full Of Quarters

[17:27] And If You Were Good You Could Stay On The Machine For As Long As You Played The Game As Long As You

[17:33] Could Beat The Other People Next To You With One Quarter You Could Stay On Street Fighter All Day Long

[17:39] And So That's Where I Think We're At I Think We're All Starting To Come Out Of The FOMO I Think We're

[17:45] All Realizing We Have So Many Great Games We Don't Need Many More Now There's Like 13 Companies Making

[17:52] Pinball Machines And I Think We're Going To See More Pinball Companies Fall Like Dominoes As People

[18:00] Just Get Tired Of It All Like There's Just Too Much Of It And The Only Stuff That's Truly

[18:05] Going To Succeed In Finding Space In Our Homes And In Our Lives Is Something That Is Truly Magical

[18:13] But I Also Do Believe This We All Need To Look At Every New Pinball Game With An Open Mind And Not

[18:20] Be Prejudiced There Are People That Want Me To Just Tear Down Jersey Jack There Are People That Want

[18:26] Me To Just Tear Down Stern I Will Look At Every Game Objectively If I Did Not If I Didn't Look At Games

[18:34] Objectively I Would Not Have Canada's Pinball Podcast I Would Not Have 725 Subscribers I Would Not

[18:41] Have The Support I Have And So For Those Out There I Am Going To Do To The Best Of My Ability A Fair

[18:47] And Honest Review Of Avatar I Really Hope I Get To Play The Game Uninterrupted For A Long Period

[18:55] Of Time On Friday We Are Going To Be There It Might Be Hard To Do That And Yes There's Probably

[19:02] Going To Be A Lot Of Visual Wow That We Experience But I Want To Look For Things Here Is The Things I

[19:07] Want To Look For Because I Learned A Lot After Willy Wonka I Want To See How They Integrate The Movies

[19:13] Into The Game Is It Even Based On The Movie Are We Going To See Clips From The Movies Where The

[19:20] Voice Actors Are Synced Up With The LCD Screen Itself I Want To Make Sure There's Not Too Many

[19:26] Multi-Balls Kiefer Is Coding This Game Right So I Want To Play This Game And There Better Not Be

[19:32] A Multi-Ball That Starts Right Away Because You Hit One Switch I Also Want To Make Sure When I Play

[19:39] This Game Right I Know The Avatar Movies That It Talks To Me It's A Movie I Want To Feel Like I

[19:44] Know What Character I Am Am I Jake Sully Isn't That The Name Of The Character Am I Leading Him And

[19:50] His Family On A Mission To Get The Marines Out Of Pandora I Bet That Is The Storyline But I Want

[19:56] To Feel Like I'm On A Journey I Know I Want To Hit That Start Button And Like Many Other Jersey

[20:02] Jack Games Be Absolutely Clueless What It Is I'm Doing And Keith Has Had I Believe Some Issues In

[20:12] Making Games Easy To Understand And Instantly Approachable When It Comes To The Jersey Jack Code

[20:19] So I Don't Want To See Like Multi-Ball Craziness I Also Am Just So Curious What Mark Siden's

[20:25] Philosophy Is Going To Be When It Comes To Design The Toys Like When I Look Down At The Game Is It

[20:31] All Lighting And Flippers But Is There An Actual Mechanism That Does Something That Makes You Go

[20:37] Wow And Will Those Mechanisms Be Things That Will Be Enjoyable After You See It For Like The 500th

[20:44] Time You Know Some Mechs Are Like The Ring And Lord Of The Rings Is That The Disappearing Magnet

[20:49] In Toten Is That Like There Are Certain Things That Just Give You That Satisfaction Every Single Time

[20:55] So I Think It's Going To Be A Lot Of Fun I Go In Friday Morning I Still Have Two Children And A

[21:01] Wife So I Have To Help Out In The House And So I Will Be Flying Down There Friday Morning I Will

[21:07] Be Spending The Entire Day With Jersey Jack And The Crew And The Media People I'll Be Hanging Out

[21:12] With Them For Dinner And Lunch And Then I'm Flying Back Saturday Morning So That Means There Will

[21:18] Not Be A Saturday Morning Spectacular But Maybe We Delay That To Saturday Night Because I Think

[21:24] It'll Be A Really Fun Time To Hang Out Everybody Thank You For Being A Member Of

[21:28] Canada's Pinball Podcast And You Know Me You Know Me I Just Want To Summarize This Show I Think We

[21:34] All Want Pinball Magic We All Should Be Shown Gameplay And Real Streaming Of A Game Before We Spend

[21:41] A Single Penny On The Product Like That's Ridiculous Stern Is Stalling Jersey Jack's

[21:48] Gonna Have To Put Some Magic In This Avatar Game At These Prices To Move Units So Excited To

[21:55] See What They've Created We All Should Keep An Open Mind And We All Already Have Way Too Many

[22:02] Pinball Machines In Our Lives These Things That Become So Expensive And I Think We're All Waking

[22:08] Up To The Reality That We're Never Gonna Be Children Again We're Never Gonna Be As Young

[22:14] As We Are Right Now Also So We Have To Find That Balance How Much Of Yesteryear Do I Want To

[22:21] Shove Into My Current Life And Maybe Just Maybe I'm Good Spending This Much Over Here And I Should

[22:29] Start Spending This Money On New Experiences And How Many Of You Out There Raise Of Hands How Many

[22:35] Of You Out There How Many Of You Out There Have Been Going To The Gym More Have Been Eating Healthier

[22:40] Have Been Taking Care Of Yourselves More Than You Take Care Of Your Pinball Machines And I Mean

[22:46] That I Want To See Each And Every One Of You Take Care Of Yourselves I Mean Now We Live In A World

[22:51] Where Everyone's Just Gonna Be On Ozenpec In A Year Now That It's Gonna Become A Pail And Not Even

[22:56] An Injection That's Who We've Become Shortcuts To Feeling Good Showing Me A Game And Asking For $13,000

[23:04] Without Gameplay Is A Shortcut And It Doesn't Leave Me Feeling Good So I Think Stern Is Stalling
