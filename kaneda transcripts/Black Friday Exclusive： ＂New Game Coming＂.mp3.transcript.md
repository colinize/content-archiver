[00:00] Oh!

[00:02] Oh, now the video got beaten again!

[00:05] Oh, but I don't know what you've been bringing with us!

[00:09] I like playing and I love what we've been saying!

[00:12] Oh, it makes us want to buy you things!

[00:15] But now I'm in my limit!

[00:18] What's in my limit?

[00:20] What's in my limit?

[00:22] Oh, yeah!

[00:25] Black Friday is all about special deals.

[00:29] And on this special exclusive news edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:34] I'm going to give you guys the ultimate scoop that is going to create the most amazing pinball deal out there in the world.

[00:42] Because what is Black Friday all about, right?

[00:45] It's about something that is expensive that you can now get for cheaper,

[00:51] because there's a special deal and a sale price on it.

[00:55] I have information that is going to do one thing and one thing only.

[01:01] It is going to destroy the value of a pinball machine.

[01:06] It is going to make a game that is worth a fortune worth almost nothing.

[01:13] And I want to talk about what that deal is,

[01:16] and what that exclusive is that I'm going to bring to you now on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:22] And guys, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.

[01:25] I really do.

[01:27] I hope you filled your tummies to your heart's content.

[01:30] I'm here right now on Black Friday with Bubba.

[01:33] Bren is downtown having drinks with friends.

[01:36] I'm a little buzzed.

[01:37] I'm a little buzzed.

[01:38] But you know what?

[01:39] I'm excited.

[01:40] Because I want to talk about this topic,

[01:43] and I want to put it in the right context.

[01:45] Because I also, after I tell you what the news is,

[01:49] I want to tell you how I really feel about this news.

[01:52] Because I kind of think it's bullshit.

[01:54] And I'm going to explain why.

[01:56] But here's the news.

[01:57] Here's the news.

[01:58] And you're going to hear it first on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[02:01] You're not going to hear it on Head to Head Pinball.

[02:04] I love you Ryan.

[02:05] But you guys every Monday,

[02:07] seriously, every Monday is when you guys are going to upload a two-hour podcast.

[02:11] You're going to miss the news.

[02:12] What if news happens on a Tuesday?

[02:15] We have to wait an entire week for Head to Head Pinball to cover that news.

[02:19] You're not going to hear it from Nate Shivers and Costa Coast Pinball.

[02:23] Nate's like abandoned everybody.

[02:26] Nate came back and did one podcast about Pirates of the Caribbean and then went away.

[02:31] Okay?

[02:32] So Canada's Pinball Podcast will always be the place.

[02:36] That on a weekly basis will give all of you the news and the commentary that I know you're looking for.

[02:42] So here it is.

[02:43] Here's the scoop.

[02:44] So I know for a fact that the guys who are making Pinball Circus.

[02:53] Okay?

[02:54] Python Angelo's Pinball Circus game.

[02:58] They are making a second title.

[03:00] Now here's the title they're making.

[03:02] And they're going to come out with this title and it's going to be based on the P-Rock system.

[03:08] The game they are making, game number two for the pinball circus max and the stuice,

[03:14] whatever the hell that game is called.

[03:16] They are making and going to remake King Pin.

[03:21] Okay?

[03:22] They're working on it.

[03:23] They have the rights to do it.

[03:25] They are going to code it with P-Rock and they are going to make King Pin as their other title.

[03:33] And that is huge, huge news because King Pin is one of the most expensive and sought after games of all time.

[03:43] And there's a reason why, right?

[03:44] There's a reason why King Pin is so sought after because there's only what?

[03:48] Eight of them in the world, this prototype Capcom machine that never, ever went into full production.

[03:57] And I want to give you guys my thoughts on this because I think this sucks.

[04:03] And I'll tell you why.

[04:05] Because for the owners of King Pin out there, all eight of you who own a pinball machine that's worth anywhere from 30 to 50,000 dollars, depending on who you ask,

[04:17] the machine is probably worth somewhere like 40,000 dollars plus.

[04:21] Your machine is about to be remade, which will make your machine worth nothing.

[04:28] It'll go all the way down to like eight or whatever they charge for King Pin is what your game will be worth.

[04:35] I don't buy the bullshit about how the originals will always be worth more.

[04:40] Absolutely not.

[04:42] Because look, King Pin was never going to be a great game.

[04:48] There's only one reason why King Pin is worth so much money and it's because there's so few of them.

[04:55] It became this like, grey-o-pinball machine simply because it was forgotten.

[05:02] It was a machine that was made right on the eve of Capcom Pinball pulling the plug on their whole operation.

[05:10] And that's why people want it because the story behind it and the fact that there's so few in existence,

[05:17] and if you go and remake this machine and make a lot of them, the game doesn't have any special narrative attached to it anymore.

[05:29] And I'm really upset because I think these guys, remaking King Pin, is a bullshit move.

[05:38] I don't think the pinball circus dudes who are making this game deserve to destroy and ruin the legacy and the story behind King Pin Pinball.

[05:52] And that's my issue and I think all of you out there who love this hobby, who follow this hobby, should have a real issue with the holy grail, you know, the sort of the white whale items of this hobby, Big Bang Bar.

[06:07] King Pin, King Kong. Like if someone were to go to remake Data East King Kong, what does that do? It just screws over the entire lore around the game itself.

[06:21] And that is what is happening with King Pin. So they're gonna do it. They're gonna make King Pin.

[06:28] And what does that mean? It also means that if you own a Big Bang Bar, you're fucked because Big Bang Bar will be next in this remake, rehash, re-copy, the machines that people pay a lot of money for.

[06:44] So if you have a King Pin, you're fucked. You're fucked. There is nothing you can do now. The word is out there. It is happening. King Pin is coming out.

[06:54] I would love for the guys who are making the pinball circus game to come out now and officially tell us whether or not they're making King Pin because I know for a fact that that is their game number two.

[07:07] So if you own a King Pin, you're fucked. If you own a Big Bang Bar, you're fucked. You better sell your Big Bang Bar yesterday. If you want a game that you think is worth anywhere from like $16 to $20,000.

[07:22] It's not because it's gonna be remade and it's gonna lose its special nature and it's not gonna be something that people are gonna want because it's just gonna be everywhere.

[07:32] And Big Bang Bar is a lot like King Pin. It's not a very good game. It's not a very good game. It's worth a lot of money because of one simple fact that it is rare.

[07:45] It is rare. It is sought after because of its rarity and the story behind it coming out is what makes it valuable. If you mass produce them, it's worth shit.

[07:56] The same reason, magic girl, right? If deep root pinball wants to remake magic girl and make it work, then what is a magic girl worth?

[08:08] What is my machine worth if they're just gonna make as many as people order? It's worth nothing. Now I don't think deep root pinball is ever gonna succeed in that.

[08:17] I think that company is basically barking up the wrong tree. But remakes and remaking the classics is one thing.

[08:28] Remaking attack from ours, remaking medieval madness, remaking cactus canyon, remaking monster bash. Like that's one thing.

[08:38] Those games, they had their time, they made a lot of them. Those games appeared in our Cades. But I just vehemently think that remaking games and remaking the games that are valuable in 2017 sucks.

[08:54] It sucks. It sucks the life out of this hobby. It sucks the storylines out of these games. And it makes these games no longer special.

[09:04] If you think these games are special because they're like the greatest games ever, I don't think anyone would really agree with you.

[09:12] These games are special because of how they came out into the world. Like cactus canyon is special because it was like what? The last valley Williams title.

[09:22] And it never even got fully coated and they didn't make many of them. But it's still a brilliant game. But if you remake it and it's readily available for anyone to order and they're gonna make 1000 of this and 1000 of that and 1000 at least and unlimited regulars, it no longer becomes special.

[09:41] Same is true with monster bash, right? The games that people didn't recognize their genius back in the day are just gonna be remade now.

[09:51] You're gonna go remake tales of the Arabianites, go remake theater of magic because to me, remaking games in 2017 is the equivalent of copying somebody else's test.

[10:05] Right? Of copying someone else's paper or the report. These people are simply standing on the shoulders of geniuses who made great pinball machines and they're just gonna remake them and destroy what makes those games special now.

[10:23] And are you happy about that? Are you happy about that? And I don't know, I don't know. I think it sucks.

[10:32] I think that Kingpin being remade is a terrible idea. I do. Again, the game is not great. It's not meant to be a great game.

[10:44] Kingpin was meant to be a game that signified the end of an era. If you go replicated and make as many as you want, then what do you do?

[10:57] So let's say you buy one of these recreated Kingpins and someone comes over and says, hey, what's that? Well, you don't longer have the authentic story that this is one of the eight machines that Capcom built before Capcom pulled the plug on their pinball industry.

[11:19] So all you can say is this is a recreation of a machine that had that story, but it's not the same, it's not the same machine. It's not the same story anymore. It's absolute bullshit. It's absolute bullshit.

[11:31] You know, okay? And look, since my last podcast have you noticed, there's a Batman 66 Super Ellie up on eBay now from Orange County Pinball, the same douchebags that are charging $30,000 for the big Lebowski.

[11:48] They are now trying to sell a Batman 66 Super Ellie for $20,000. I love it. So now Batman 66 Super Ellie is worth $5,000 more than it was new when we saw one trade for 13 grand.

[12:03] Look, everyone, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving. I hope you and your families had amazing meals, amazing why an amazing booze, amazing time.

[12:16] But this is really an annoying thing that we're going to remake everything that was special and we're going to just redo stuff because people are out of ideas.

[12:30] How about all these companies remaking stuff? Actually develop a new game that's great. You know, I give credit to American pinball for making Houdini.

[12:40] I give credit to Jersey Jack Pinball making pirate to the Caribbean. I give credit to Stern Pinball making new machines. I give credit to spooky pinball making Alice Cooper and total nuclear annihilation.

[12:53] The stories we want, like I think everyone feels good about buying Scott Denise's total nuclear annihilation. I think people feel great about that purchase.

[13:03] I think people who are going to go buy a remake of Kingpin, what are you going to feel good about? What are you going to feel good about?

[13:10] Are you going to feel good about trying to support deeproot and their bullshit efforts to like rejuvenate John Papaduke?

[13:16] John Papaduke is the biggest cancer to ever infiltrate pinball. All right, the guy is a clown. He's an absolute clown.

[13:25] He didn't do anything at Ballu Williams. He designed games and then people made him work. He had five years to make Magic Girl.

[13:32] If you stand over a Magic Girl right now, think about five years worth of time, half a decade. He couldn't get a single mechanism to work right.

[13:41] If you really think that this guy deserves a second chance, you are out of your mind. You are out of your mind. So that's it. I got a feed Bubba.

[13:52] I got to go meet Brenda and friends for dinner. But I wanted you to hear this exclusive that Kingpin pinball is being remade by the pinball circus people.

[14:04] And Big Bang Bar is probably going to follow. And that is what you heard here first.

[14:12] And I also want to tell you guys that in the next week or so, I am going to be a guest on Head to Head Pinball.

[14:19] Marty and Ryan were nice enough to ask me to join their show and be a guest on Head to Head Pinball. And I'm super excited.

[14:27] I've had Ryan on my show a couple times. I love their podcast. Like next to Canadian pinball podcast, the best pinball podcast out there is Head to Head Pinball in Australia.

[14:39] So guys, look forward to me being a guest on their show. We're going to talk all about pinball and what's going on in the hobby.

[14:46] But really, I want to thank Marty and Ryan for inviting me to be on the show. I can't wait to be on it. You guys should check it out.

[14:53] It's going to happen in the next couple of weeks. And I really appreciate it. Probably like two Mondays from now. But I really appreciate it.

[15:00] Those guys are stellar guys. Like I can't wait to be on the show. Can't wait. I'm super excited.

[15:05] That is it. You got the exclusive. Go drink. Go have fun. And we'll talk to you real soon.
