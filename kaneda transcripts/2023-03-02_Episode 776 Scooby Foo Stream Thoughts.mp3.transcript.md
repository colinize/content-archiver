[00:00] Oh, we got to see Foo Fighters gameplay, we're gonna talk about that, and we're also gonna

[00:19] talk about, in the name of being honest, I said, if you continue your Canadian Club subscription,

[00:25] I will share with you March 1st, the Galactic Tank Force image I have, and I just want to

[00:30] give you guys the full candid background on this image, what happened over at American

[00:36] Pinball, and why I put up a poll on the Patreon page about whether or not I should release

[00:44] this image, and I also want to give you the full context that I've been talking with David

[00:48] Fix and with Christopher Franci, and as you can imagine, they are very upset with Canada

[00:54] because this is what Canada does, he spoils the launch plans of pinball companies.

[00:59] Now look, what I normally do, and the reason why you listen to this show is I will normally

[01:05] just tell you what the themes are, but the moment you share a picture of the play field

[01:12] prior to a game getting launched, it is impossible to not feel like you are spoiling the hard

[01:20] work of everyone who slaved away on the project itself, it's why I never shared the image

[01:26] of Guns N' Roses, and it's also why I'm really conflicted here, I've shared blurry images

[01:31] of it, I gave you some images of the Translight, I gave you some images of the Tank Treads,

[01:38] which they are, by the way, they are mad at me saying that I showed the game in the worst

[01:43] possible light, and that when people see these Tank Treads attached to the game, it's gonna

[01:49] look really cool, and so look, this game is going to be revealed to the world in just a

[01:54] couple weeks, and so I really don't feel like spoiling their plans right now, I also don't

[02:01] wanna go to TPF where people are hating me, I've been through enough drama in my personal

[02:07] life, so I'm hoping that the Canadian Army that is out there, that's a Patreon member,

[02:13] I'm hoping that most people vote to not share the image, and I'm also hoping if you

[02:19] voted to share the image that you don't leave the Canada Club and try to indict me as a liar,

[02:25] because you were here before this photo landed in my email inbox, and even though I know

[02:30] other pinball media have the image, nobody has really released it, nobody's leaked it

[02:35] out into the world, and so why don't we let Dennis Norman and Christopher Franchi and

[02:41] David Ficks have their moment and create their first impression the right way, and the way

[02:46] this photo happened, it was a friend of Mukesh's over at American Pinball, and he asked to

[02:52] take a photo of his kid playing the game, and he took the photo and he promised them

[02:58] that he would only share this photo with his wife, and he obviously didn't just share it

[03:04] with his wife, he sent it out to people, and then the photo got leaked around to everybody

[03:09] in the pinball media, and as I told Mr. Franchi, I am not the bad guy here, I am not the one

[03:15] who broke any NDA, I am not the one who is going against the trust with American Pinball,

[03:21] and I told them, guys, in the future, don't let anybody take photos, no ifs, ands, or buts,

[03:28] no like, oh it's just for my wife, oh it's because my cute kid is playing the game, no,

[03:33] if you want to keep something secret, keep it a secret, nobody leaked images of Foo Fighters,

[03:39] nobody's seen Venom, nobody's leaking stuff at Stern Pinball, and they have way more people

[03:44] going through that company on a daily basis, nobody's leaked images of Godfather, it is

[03:50] really easy to keep a game secret, and so look, this all falls on David Fix, but also,

[03:56] we're not bad people, and I don't think any of us have bad hearts or want to hurt these

[04:01] companies, and this would hurt their launch of the game, and I think I've done enough,

[04:05] again, I think I've given you enough, people already hate me, do they need to hate me even

[04:11] more, is the question that's on your plate right now as you vote on my Patreon page.

[04:17] But trust me, I'm not going to stop telling you guys what the next themes are, I'm not

[04:21] going to stop telling you guys what the rumors, news, and speculation is in the Pinball hobby,

[04:25] because I'm the only Pinball podcaster that's not trying to really sell you games or sponsored

[04:30] by people trying to sell you stuff, I'm just trying to give you all the information you

[04:34] need to make a good decision, and here's what I'm going to tell you right now, and I mean

[04:37] it, the best decision you can make in all of March is to wait and see all of these games

[04:43] before you buy anything, I mean it, I wouldn't even buy Foo Fighters yet, you get to see

[04:48] Godfather, you get to see Galactic Tank Force at the end of March, and I mean this, on April

[04:54] 1st, April Fool's Day, is when you should make up your mind on which game to order,

[04:59] and you have to be a fool to buy Pinball machines at these prices, I can feel it already, right,

[05:04] Pinball FOMO now, like even Foo Fighters, as much as I love the game, and I love what

[05:08] they did with the game, Pinball FOMO now man, it's like gone in less than 24 hours, simply

[05:14] because the prices are so high, I don't think anyone wants to be writing checks for 11,000,

[05:19] 12,000, 14,5, 13,000, whatever it is, I think Pinball now is so expensive, and I think that's

[05:26] just rubbing off on everybody, and as fun as these games are, everybody remembers when

[05:31] these games were just as loaded, they had just as cool artwork, they had just as many,

[05:36] if not more mechanisms in the games, and we remember when these games cost $6,500 or $7,504

[05:43] in LE, and I think only newbies are looking at these games being like, yeah, where do

[05:48] I send my check for $14,500 for a Stern LE, or where do I buy a Jersey Jack CE for $16,500

[05:56] with taxes, right? Nobody's excited for this stuff at these prices, and that's the thing,

[06:01] you almost have to turn off the price tag if you really want your FOMO to last for more

[06:06] than 24 hours, and so I think that's the best advice I can give each and every one of you,

[06:10] is I would wait to see every single company's offering, get to see the gameplay, and here's

[06:16] the greatest part, you're gonna be able to jump on every single machine, and still get

[06:21] any machine you want, you will be able to get a Foo Fighters LE in like three weeks,

[06:26] you will, you will be able to get a Godfather, you absolutely will be able to get that game,

[06:32] I mean there's no way they're gonna sell a thousand Godfather's CEs at $15,000, there's

[06:36] absolutely no way, it's just impossible, it is absolutely impossible, even if they unboxed

[06:41] Godfather and there was freaking Pire to the Caribbean playfield in the game and they just

[06:46] reskinned it to Godfather, there's no way, there is no way they're gonna sell out of

[06:50] these machines, I mean I am seeing now Toy Story Collectors editions, new in box, distributors

[06:56] are selling them for $11,500, $11,500, that means people lost $3,500 more than that because

[07:05] you paid tax, I mean these distributors I'm hearing are taking cash deals, $11,500 just

[07:11] throw the thing in the back of the truck, forget about taxes, just pay me cash and get this

[07:15] thing out of here because we gotta make room for Godfather, there's a lot of exciting things

[07:19] happening in the month of March, none of us need to feel bad, I don't think any of us

[07:24] need to spoil the plans of these companies, we will see everything within three weeks

[07:29] and I think everybody has enough patience to see these games the right way.

[07:34] Speaking of seeing games the right way, it was great that we got to see Foo Fighters

[07:38] yesterday, I watched about 20 minutes of the stream and I skipped to like the 30 minute

[07:44] mark because I read on Pinside that Raymond Davidson is so annoying when he talks about

[07:50] the ruleset of the game that the only way you can really enjoy it is if you tune him

[07:55] out and I just want to tell Stern this, stop having your coders and your ruleset guys,

[08:02] spoil the stream of the game, we just want to get into the game for a half hour, we want

[08:07] to feel the vibe of the game and so here's my early take on the game and seeing the gameplay

[08:12] and seeing the animations, first and foremost I actually think this is the first pinball

[08:15] stream I've ever seen where the animations were actually more impressive than the pinball

[08:21] and I don't mean the pinball wasn't impressive but man these are the greatest animations

[08:25] Stern has ever done, it's like you're watching a Saturday morning cartoon and I was so impressed

[08:30] by what's on the screen and the amount of effort that went into the game and I think

[08:35] this is going to be what Stern does moving forward with these animators and illustrators

[08:39] because think about it, if they do Jaws Pinball I think they might animate it like this because

[08:44] Stern is smart, they don't have to spend the money to get the actual clips or footage anymore

[08:50] if they do it this way but I also just think this 80's like Saturday morning cartoon vibe

[08:55] works so well with this game and wasn't it funny that they actually paid homage to Scooby

[09:01] Doo in the Area 51 sort of mode of the game, the Foo Fighter gang is going back and forth

[09:08] just like in a Scooby Doo cartoon series, it's like Foo Fighter Pinball is a better version

[09:13] of Scooby Doo than Scooby Doo Pinball even is, I mean it's just so weird to say that but I don't

[09:18] know, like look at what's on this screen and I think everyone else's games, like if you put

[09:22] spooky pinballs animations in their game versus this it's embarrassing how much better the Stern

[09:29] game is but the spooky machine is basically the same amount of money and there's more stuff in

[09:34] the Stern machine and there's just more talent over at Stern Pinball and I think that's going to

[09:39] be the big thing with Galactic Tank Force is I don't think their coding and their animations are

[09:44] going to be anywhere near as good as this Foo Fighter game and so I think look that's what jumped out

[09:49] at me first and foremost was how awesome the animations were in the stream itself, as far as

[09:54] the gameplay goes, the game looks great, I mean it looks really fast, it looks really fun, there's

[09:59] great flow in the game, there's great combos, I'm not surprised it was designed by a guy that

[10:04] plays nothing but pinball all day long, I'm just going to say it like this, the game looks like

[10:08] Godzilla Light and I mean it when I say it, it looks a little bit like Godzilla Light, it reminds

[10:13] me of how fast Godzilla plays, it reminds me of how the ball goes in a lot of interesting directions,

[10:19] there's a lot of great combos, the game doesn't have any of the wow mechanisms Godzilla has with

[10:24] the bridge and the building and the mecha Godzilla and like the Godzilla magnet that throws the ball,

[10:30] like there's a lot more in Godzilla that I think creates a mechanical wow than is in Foo Fighters

[10:36] but that being said as Jack Danger's inaugural game, I think everyone is very impressed, I think

[10:43] he should do a victory lap and I think it's a great game and the main question now is this,

[10:48] for everybody, it's not that Foo Fighter Pinball isn't super fun because it is, I do think the

[10:54] game needs more call-outs, that's the other thing I was going to say because the zombie-eddy artwork

[10:58] is absolutely incredible, I love the way the game looks, I love the way the game shoots,

[11:03] I love the animations, I just think the game needs more call-outs and I was sad to see that Dave

[11:10] Grohl did not do any call-outs, there's no band members doing call-outs in the machine itself

[11:16] and Dave Grohl is a very animated person so people who say like well band member call-outs are always

[11:21] lame, his would not be lame and I think this game really needs more call-outs because as I was watching

[11:27] the stream, the one thing I didn't feel, I didn't feel like there was any call-outs telling the

[11:32] player what to do, I didn't feel like there was any call-outs like driving the narrative of the

[11:37] game, you know it's like you've got Jack and the team over there telling you what's going on but

[11:42] you should be telling the player what's going on with your call-out and because it's at point 80

[11:48] code, I hope they realize that and put a lot more call-outs into the game that guide the player

[11:54] through this whole sort of alien invasion you know sort of thing happening because as of right now

[12:01] it's like the storyboarding is there with the animations, the scenes are there, the modes are

[12:07] there but you need someone emceeing this entire narrative through call-outs that I think engages

[12:14] the player more and I just didn't see that with the stream yet. Alright so we got foo fighters

[12:19] though man and the order banks are open and now the big question becomes do we as a community,

[12:25] do we have what it takes in our checking accounts to support this hobby at these prices? With so many

[12:31] games coming out on top of each other there's no way they're all gonna get the orders they think

[12:37] they're gonna get and at this price point I mean it when I say it I think $13,000 is too much for

[12:44] every single Stern LE moving forward I just do I just don't make enough money to write checks for

[12:51] 14.5 every time a new Stern LE comes out that I want to get and I don't know about some of you but

[12:56] like they really are pricing a lot of people out of the hobby and I see people being like I'm just

[13:01] glad I secured a premium I mean that's a weird state of pinball where people are now sort of proud

[13:07] to secure a premium which they are going to make for years and a premium is unlimited and that's

[13:14] the hard part about buying a premium right away because if you buy a brand new premium and now

[13:19] you're spending over $10,000 you know you're gonna be able to get that premium used in a year for

[13:25] probably $2,000 off. That's the main thing that's weird about all of these price increases is the

[13:31] market is now flooded with so many games so many more Ali's so many more CEs so many more premiums

[13:39] that once we get to this point of oversaturation then you're gonna see everybody and I mean this

[13:45] everybody is gonna lose money on every single game they buy and when that starts happening it's

[13:51] gonna become real clear you're only gonna buy stuff where you love the theme where you don't

[13:56] want to get rid of it because of the theme. The main thing that makes you want to keep a pinball

[14:01] machine will always be the theme a very second close to that will be gameplay but man like you

[14:09] know you could buy Iron Maiden and you could enjoy it for a few years but if you don't love the theme

[14:14] chances are you'll move on to the next if you like the theme more right if you like Godzilla more

[14:19] than Iron Maiden why would you have both like you probably would get rid of your Iron Maiden

[14:25] and keep Godzilla bolted to the floor because you love the theme. Everybody thank you so much for

[14:30] being a member of the canada club every month now we are losing less people at the end of the month

[14:36] and we now have 562 club members which is crazy it's blowing my mind I did have a goal to try to get

[14:43] to 600 by TPF but trust me it took everything in me not to say all release this galactic tank force

[14:51] photo if we get to 600 club members because I don't want to do that either like I think you're

[14:56] here because you know that this is the most honest the most transparent and the most direct pinball

[15:02] podcast that is out there I also think it's the most entertaining and I think it's why you're here

[15:07] and I don't need to like spoil a company's plans to keep you here you are not going to get a show

[15:12] this good anywhere else on the pinball podcasting airwaves so thank you for being a club member

[15:18] and the show is just going to keep getting better and this month's going to be bonkers as we talk

[15:22] about all these games coming out everybody have a great day enjoy your lives and don't let pinball

[15:29] drama get you down and trust me wait and see play all of these games make sure it's the game you want

[15:37] and you will not be told the game is sold out don't believe the lies that foo fighter at least

[15:43] sold out already it probably didn't they're going to be available now look do I think they're going

[15:48] to sell all of these games I do I do think all thousand will probably go by the end of the month

[15:56] but the day one sellout days are over and that's not a bad thing I know that jack danger wants you

[16:03] to jump on his game fall in love with it and then buy it and it's a good day in pinball now

[16:09] that all of us can do this I know that when you see this game and the zombie eddie artwork and you

[16:15] stand over it at Texas pinball festival then you're probably going to want one okay and that's how it

[16:21] should be we should stop buying these games because of four minute sizzle reel videos and

[16:27] distributors just like spamming facebook with their first sale ads and then telling us I've got one

[16:33] more left you want one I got one more left and then they sell you it and then they call up the next

[16:38] guy I got one more left all of that all of that FOMO is gone and it's gone because these prices are

[16:45] way too high and the only bargain left in pinball is canada's pinball podcast for five dollars a

[16:51] month thank you for being a member we'll talk to you soon they say all's well it ends well but I'm

[16:58] in a new hell every time you double cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it

[17:09] would have been fine and that made me want to die the idea you had of me you was she I never needed

[17:19] ever love me
