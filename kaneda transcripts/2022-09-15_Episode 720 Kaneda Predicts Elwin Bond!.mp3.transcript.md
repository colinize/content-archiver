[00:00] If Canada is correct about Keith Elwyn doing a fourth version of James Bond as a street-level

[00:06] game, he's gonna march into the Twippies like this.

[00:09] Ah, welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:28] Welcome to all of my new club members over from the UK.

[00:31] It's really great to have people from overseas joining the show.

[00:35] I got one simple question to ask as we start this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:40] Where's the Pinball Media at?

[00:42] Where are they all at?

[00:44] I don't understand this.

[00:45] This has been one of the most interesting, one of the most dramatic, and one of the most

[00:51] like news-filled weeks in the history of pinball reveals, right?

[00:56] The flubbing of the James Bond reveal has created so much interesting speculation and

[01:03] back and forth, and the rumor mill is going crazy.

[01:08] And meanwhile, the entire pinball media landscape completely dead.

[01:13] I only saw one show by the Loser Kid Pinball Podcast.

[01:17] Where is everybody else?

[01:18] Kerry Hardy did a video, but nobody else is saying anything.

[01:22] And that's why you're here in the Canada Club.

[01:25] So I'm here to say right now, I hope that everyone who made fun of me, who called me names, who

[01:31] said there is no way that Keith Elwyn is going to do a fourth version of the James Bond game.

[01:39] I'm hearing it all over Pinside.

[01:41] I've screen grabbed everyone who said, I'm crazy.

[01:44] It's never happening.

[01:46] I'm here to tell you right now.

[01:48] I feel really, really good about this prediction that Keith Elwyn is working on a street-level

[01:55] game with no ramps that is based on James Bond.

[02:00] It is going to be the mystery game, people.

[02:04] Look, I haven't seen it, but I have spoken to some people that have said they have seen

[02:10] it.

[02:10] Now either I am getting trolled really, really hard, or this is going to be the cherry on

[02:16] top of this James Bond game.

[02:19] Now look, it is Thursday.

[02:21] We have seven more days to go until we see this game.

[02:26] Here's the good news.

[02:27] We've already seen it.

[02:28] We've already seen the George Gomez version of the game.

[02:31] I will say this.

[02:32] I don't love the artwork.

[02:34] I get it.

[02:35] It's based on the old James Bond movie posters, but I do think in person these games are going

[02:42] to look better than these leaked photos we've seen.

[02:46] I'm going to talk a little bit about the leaks and everyone trying to figure out what the

[02:50] source is of these leaks.

[02:51] It wasn't Canada.

[02:52] I'm going to tell you exactly how this went down, but I want to get back to the game.

[02:57] The game is packed.

[02:59] I am so happy that Stern Pinball has put this much into the game.

[03:03] I think this is going to be an amazing game.

[03:06] I think it's going to be an amazing game to play.

[03:08] I think when we hear the music and we see the clips from the movies and we get the callouts

[03:13] and we see all of these fun mechs happening and we see the balls being locked and being

[03:19] picked up by jetpacks and being dropped on tanks, I think this is going to go down as

[03:25] the game of the year.

[03:26] I think everyone, even though we might be complaining about artwork, I think everyone's

[03:31] going to want one and I think there's going to be a feeding frenzy to get a James Bond

[03:37] LE.

[03:38] I really do.

[03:39] I think this game is going to be a day one sellout and I think when we see it in action,

[03:44] everyone's going to go real giddy.

[03:45] It's so unfortunate that this game had such a weird week.

[03:50] I think everyone's calmed down a little bit.

[03:53] I know there's a lot of finger pointing happening within the UK pinball community.

[03:57] I know some people think I leaked these photos that I burned someone.

[04:02] I did not.

[04:03] Here's what happened, people.

[04:04] It went down real simply like this.

[04:06] On Monday morning when I came into work, I was given some assets from the game.

[04:11] Someone said, here you go, but please do not share these assets, but you can talk about

[04:17] what you're seeing.

[04:18] And that's exactly what I did.

[04:19] If you saw what happened on my Facebook page, I said I was going to do a podcast in which

[04:24] I gave my club members exclusive information on what's in the game.

[04:30] And then what happened?

[04:31] About five minutes later, I saw that the images were all over Pinside.

[04:37] Ladies and gentlemen, I swear to you, I do not have a fake Pinside account.

[04:42] I am not on there in any other capacity other than reading the site.

[04:46] I do not have an avatar.

[04:48] I do not have a login.

[04:49] I did not post these photos.

[04:52] Somebody broke the trust of Phil over in the UK and shared these photos out and someone

[04:58] posted them on Pinside.

[05:00] And the moment that happened, the moment they're out, they're out.

[05:03] Now look, I know Pinside has taken down some of the images.

[05:06] I did not take down the images on my Facebook page.

[05:10] I'll tell you why, because nobody asked me to.

[05:13] Stern didn't reach out to me.

[05:14] They did not ask Neda to remove the photos, so they remain.

[05:18] I've all seen the game, right?

[05:19] If you're listening to this podcast right now, there's a 99.9% chance that you have

[05:25] seen the game, that you're excited about the game, but the game has been revealed.

[05:30] And I know there's a lot of drama with the pinball community in the UK.

[05:34] There's a lot of finger pointing who did what, who shared what, who broke trust.

[05:39] Look, I don't know if we're ever going to know who did it.

[05:41] It was not me.

[05:42] I did not burn the person who sent me the images.

[05:46] I will say, I think everyone needs to stop beating each other up.

[05:50] Yes, there is obviously some blame to go around on people who shared the assets.

[05:55] But ultimately, the reason why this game leaked, it's all on Stern people.

[06:01] Stern is the company that unboxed it on a show floor.

[06:06] This was going to happen.

[06:08] Whether or not it was Phil or somebody else, this game was going to leak before the Tuesday

[06:15] reveal, especially if Stern did it like this.

[06:19] They just brought the game out with no protection, no security, no coverage.

[06:25] So when you do that, it's going to leak.

[06:27] And I think the lesson learned here needs to be learned over at Stern Pinball.

[06:32] And the other part that's really weird to me, and I said it yesterday on my Facebook live

[06:36] rant, by the way, if you haven't seen that video yesterday that I did on Facebook, go

[06:40] check it out.

[06:41] It's one of my greatest Facebook lives of all time.

[06:45] And in just 20 minutes, we were able to raise like 13,000 stars.

[06:50] I'm going to use that money tomorrow to take Brenda to a really nice hand roll sushi lunch

[06:55] at Kazunori.

[06:56] But that's not why you're listening.

[06:58] The other part that's weird to me is like Stern doesn't come out and say anything other

[07:03] than they've delayed the release of the game.

[07:06] I think Stern Pinball needs to engage the community more.

[07:09] I think their marketing team and their PR people, they need to talk to us more.

[07:13] Because part of being the communications and public relations and marketing wing of a

[07:17] company is also to help that company out when there's a bit of a crisis.

[07:22] They need to do more scenario planning at Stern.

[07:25] So what do we do if pictures leak?

[07:27] How do we handle that?

[07:28] What happens if they're out there?

[07:30] Well, are we going to go ask people to take the photos down?

[07:33] If I were Stern, I would have had George Gomez do a Facebook live.

[07:37] I would have.

[07:37] I would have recorded a Facebook live with George and he would say, Hey, everybody,

[07:41] this is George Gomez from Stern Pinball.

[07:43] We know you're super excited about this game.

[07:45] We know some images leaked of the game.

[07:48] Trust me, this game looks incredible in person and we can't wait for you to see

[07:52] the official reveal of this game.

[07:55] We've delayed it because of the Queen's passing.

[07:57] We didn't realize the magnitude of what's going on here when we started to set up

[08:01] at the show.

[08:02] So we're asking everybody, do us a favor, please take down all leaked images and

[08:08] please don't share them.

[08:10] We really want you to see this game for the first time in the right way.

[08:13] And that's going to happen next week.

[08:16] And they also should have gave a date.

[08:18] They really didn't.

[08:19] They didn't say anything in that email.

[08:21] They didn't say anything.

[08:22] And now we're seeing that the countdown clock is next Thursday.

[08:26] So we have an entire week to go.

[08:28] Now there's a lot of questions I have right now.

[08:31] Are the Stern personnel who were supposed to be there for this launch, are

[08:35] they staying now an extra week in the UK?

[08:38] Is the license holder paying for their hotel rooms?

[08:41] This whole thing is turning out to be a real cluster.

[08:45] Distributors don't know anything.

[08:47] Dealers don't know anything.

[08:49] Nobody knows the price.

[08:50] Nobody knows what the Ellie looks like.

[08:53] Nobody knows if Canada is actually going to be right.

[08:56] And there's going to be a Keith Elwin version of the game that they unveil at

[09:00] the British Film Institute on September 30th.

[09:03] This is exciting.

[09:04] This is a thing.

[09:05] This is what's crazy to me.

[09:06] There are still so many question marks around this game.

[09:09] Even though we know what it looks like, we don't know some of the big elements.

[09:13] How much are they going to charge us?

[09:15] You know, what does the Ellie look like?

[09:17] Here's another question I have.

[09:19] When George Gomez did that interview last week, he held up a mech that was a

[09:24] scuba diver.

[09:26] So where does that scuba diver go?

[09:28] Are they going to put that scuba diver on the left side of the game where the

[09:31] upper left flipper is?

[09:32] Or maybe that's in the Ellie, the Thunderball Edition, because that scuba

[09:36] diver comes from Thunderball.

[09:37] So I still have a lot of questions on this game and we have to wait a week.

[09:42] And here's what I implore everybody to do.

[09:43] Let's stop attacking people about where photos came from.

[09:47] We're in this together.

[09:48] This community is all in it together.

[09:51] None of us work for Stern pinball.

[09:53] None of us have money invested in Stern pinball.

[09:56] And Stern pinball is not going to lose one penny because photos of this game

[10:01] leaked. This isn't like the new iPhone and you leaked it early and they were

[10:05] spending multi millions of dollars on a launch event that you just spoiled.

[10:10] Right.

[10:10] They didn't hire celebrities to launch this product.

[10:13] There is no money lost at all on this.

[10:16] Maybe other than hotel rooms and bruised egos over at Stern pinball.

[10:20] So I always want to ensure that we just stick together.

[10:23] Like we're all in this together.

[10:24] The world doesn't know this pinball machine is out there.

[10:27] The world has not seen James Bond.

[10:29] A few of us nerds and geeks have seen the game.

[10:32] And I always want to ensure that because I think we need to preserve and protect

[10:36] the community more than anything else.

[10:38] I think our bond and our relationship is more important and nobody should be

[10:43] berated.

[10:43] Nobody should be insulted and nobody should be personally attacked simply

[10:48] because they shared leaked images.

[10:49] It is what it is.

[10:50] It still stands fault.

[10:52] I mean it is still Stern's fault.

[10:54] They let that game leave Chicago, end up in the UK.

[10:58] And they did not have a good plan in place to keep leaks from happening

[11:03] until they were ready to show the game.

[11:05] That is on them.

[11:06] I think Phil just got excited.

[11:08] Like any of us would have done all of us.

[11:11] I mean this.

[11:11] How many of you out there would have been reaching for your cell phones?

[11:15] If you just saw a guy setting up the game, there's no security.

[11:19] There's no one telling you not to take photos.

[11:21] And all of these different vendors are setting up their booths and you walk

[11:25] by this vendor booth and there's James Bond.

[11:27] And nobody's stopping you.

[11:29] You're telling me you wouldn't take out your camera and start taking some photos.

[11:33] Of course you would.

[11:34] Of course I would.

[11:35] It's really weird to me when people are like on the side of Stern like, oh yeah,

[11:38] for your 15 minutes of fame, is it worth it?

[11:41] Is it worth it?

[11:41] You ruined it.

[11:42] No, we didn't ruin anything.

[11:43] This is all on Stern people.

[11:45] It really is.

[11:46] They should have taken more measures.

[11:48] So we got a way to week.

[11:49] We got a way to week.

[11:50] Now look, I feel really good about this Keith Elwin game.

[11:54] Here's what I think it's going to be.

[11:55] I think it's going to be a game that's single level, no subways, no ramps.

[12:00] I think it's going to be a beautiful game.

[12:03] I think the art package on the Elwin game is going to be super beautiful.

[12:06] Here's my prediction.

[12:07] I think the Keith Elwin James Bond game is going to be a throwback pinball machine

[12:14] that looks like it came from the year 1962.

[12:19] I think it's going to be a game that celebrates all of James Bond, but be a

[12:23] throwback, be like a retro design.

[12:26] And I think that's what we're going to see.

[12:28] And it makes total sense because James Bond, the Sean Connery James Bond movies

[12:32] began in 1962.

[12:35] And I think that's what we're going to see.

[12:36] I don't think it's going to compete with the George Gomez game at all.

[12:40] I think everyone needs to start looking at this thing and just like a cherry on

[12:44] top of what they're doing with James Bond.

[12:47] That's what it is.

[12:48] It's just a way for Stern to flex.

[12:50] And I think people are forgetting Stern has had all of this extra time because of

[12:54] the delays.

[12:55] I think people are forgetting a few things.

[12:57] People are like, there's no way they're going to have two designers work on the

[13:00] same thing.

[13:01] They've done it before people.

[13:02] They do it when they have another designer do a home pin.

[13:05] You know, Jack Danger did the home pin version of Jurassic Park and Keith Elwin

[13:09] did the cornerstone.

[13:10] And because Stern had like nine months off from new releases, they had time to

[13:15] do this.

[13:16] I don't think this would have happened if everything stayed on schedule.

[13:19] I really don't.

[13:20] I think this is happening because they had a little bit of a delay.

[13:24] They had a little bit of extra time.

[13:26] And also Keith Elwin is so prolific.

[13:29] The guy dreams, eats, sleeps, wakes up, pinball.

[13:33] He can design a street level game blindfolded.

[13:36] So I think this game is going to be cool.

[13:39] I think it's going to be a throwback.

[13:40] And I think it's going to have some like modern Elwin like design flow layout

[13:44] elements incorporated into a classic game.

[13:47] I don't know the price.

[13:49] I don't know if it's going to be limited or not.

[13:52] What I'm hearing is this, they are not going to limit it.

[13:55] It's going to be made to order.

[13:56] What if they opened it up?

[13:57] What if they said, we're going to open up orders for Keith Elwin's game for seven

[14:02] days, however many orders we get over those seven days, that's how many we're

[14:06] going to make.

[14:07] And then they could set a price.

[14:09] Why wouldn't they do that?

[14:10] There are so many different ways they could sell this game and it is not going

[14:14] to overshadow the Gomez game.

[14:15] It's not going to override what George did.

[14:18] It's just going to be Stern saying, we can do whatever we want because we're

[14:22] Stern and I think that's what the play is.

[14:25] All right.

[14:25] Any other news in the pinball world?

[14:27] So we are going to see spinal tap pinball from home pin this Saturday.

[14:32] This is crazy.

[14:33] That spinal tap is actually going to be revealed before James Bond.

[14:39] You know, it's also crazy about spinal tap.

[14:40] It's another game that's based on a UK pop culture thing.

[14:45] James Bond comes from the UK and so does spinal tap.

[14:48] So, you know, as the queen passes away, the two pinball machines that are

[14:52] coming out right now are UK properties.

[14:55] It's pretty ironic if you ask me, but we're going to see this game from home

[14:59] pin.

[14:59] I don't think it's really going to land with any fanfare, but there is hope for

[15:03] this game and I'm going to tell you what it is.

[15:05] The greatest hope for home pin spinal tap is the price.

[15:09] If this game is priced around like 7,500 bucks in a world in which all this

[15:15] pinball is getting super expensive, I think we might see some people go in on

[15:20] this game.

[15:21] My prediction about spinal tap is this.

[15:23] I think it's going to be pretty ugly looking.

[15:26] I don't think it's mechanically going to be that impressive.

[15:29] And I don't think there are many people out there as they look at their wallets

[15:33] really going to send money to home pin.

[15:35] I don't.

[15:35] I would have to assume that this spinal tap game will sell between three and

[15:40] 500 units max max.

[15:43] It is a licensed property and that is why I think they might get up to that many

[15:47] sales, but it's also home pin.

[15:49] This is a company that has no following, no fan base.

[15:52] And after Thunderbirds, it's like, how do you create excitement for this brand?

[15:57] And also remember it's 2022 people and this game is coming out with an

[16:02] orange DMD below an LCD screen.

[16:06] That is going to look horrible.

[16:08] I don't even have to see it.

[16:10] That is going to look horrendous.

[16:12] It's going to look lazy.

[16:14] And I think when you compare it to what else is out in pinball, I don't think

[16:17] many people are going to buy this game.

[16:19] So spooky pinball has finally listened to Canada and they've opened up the

[16:24] TNA 2.0 order banks to people outside of the fan club.

[16:29] So if you're not a fan club member, you can now buy this game.

[16:32] I think it's super smart.

[16:33] They did this.

[16:34] I think they probably will sell all of these TNAs, but now that we've seen

[16:39] James Bond and what you can get for $9,000, I think it's a lot harder to sell

[16:44] these TNAs.

[16:45] I don't think they're worth nine grand.

[16:47] I don't.

[16:47] And the other part is this, I think spooky messed up the FOMO window because

[16:51] what they should have done is they've should have opened it up for fan club

[16:55] members on day one, and then they should have opened it up to a wider

[16:59] audience to buy on day two.

[17:01] But now it doesn't feel like this game was revealed like a month ago.

[17:05] Now that we've seen James Bond, I think if you've got nine grand, you're

[17:09] going to want to probably buy that game.

[17:11] Now look, TNA is a completely different game, but here's the other part.

[17:14] Like TNA is a street level game.

[17:16] It's a single level game.

[17:18] And if there's a Keith Elwin single level James Bond, now it gets really

[17:23] interesting, right?

[17:24] Why would you buy TNA today?

[17:26] Maybe you wait and see what the single level James Bond game is because on

[17:30] some level, on some pinball playing experience level, you know, there's

[17:33] certain people that like single level games and there's certain people that

[17:36] don't like, I'm one of the people that don't really love single level pinball.

[17:39] I like full featured games.

[17:41] I like hitting Rams.

[17:42] I like there being a lot of toys and mechs in a game, but this just gets

[17:46] really, really interesting.

[17:47] It's been an amazing week for pinball.

[17:49] It really has.

[17:50] And I really want my content creator friends out there.

[17:53] Guys, don't wait to Monday.

[17:56] Come on.

[17:56] This thing is happening in real time.

[17:58] It's like top gun.

[17:59] Like this thing is going to be over by the time you do your shows, like you're

[18:02] missing everything.

[18:03] It is the greatest week of pinball speculating and covering something.

[18:07] We've never seen Stern fumble a launch like this.

[18:10] I also think it goes to show that some of these content creators, they really

[18:14] are in Stern's back pocket because that's why they're not saying anything.

[18:18] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Kinecta Club.

[18:21] I'm going to come at you in real time when stuff is happening, when it's

[18:25] relevant, and I'm going to die on this hill that Keith Elwin's James Bond is

[18:30] coming out and everyone who said I was wrong, get ready to eat crow.

[18:36] Canada and macho are going to dance into the Twippies later everybody.
