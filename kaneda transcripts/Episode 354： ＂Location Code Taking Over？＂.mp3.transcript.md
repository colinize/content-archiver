[00:00] Oh, welcome, happy Friday everybody.

[00:19] Welcome to Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canadian.

[00:23] The only pinball podcast that does back to back.

[00:27] So you can't stop the Canadian train because I just wake up in the morning and it's like

[00:32] I'm singing in the shower but it just ends up being a podcast for your enjoyment.

[00:36] So on the last episode, how many of you out there are like, what is he doing?

[00:41] He's flip-flopping on Willy Wonka.

[00:43] We knew he would do this.

[00:45] We knew he would bail on the game.

[00:46] I have not bailed on the game, but I raised a very interesting question about where this

[00:53] game is headed.

[00:54] And in the past 24 hours, I've received a lot of commentary, a lot of feedback.

[01:00] I've even heard some people who are saying this is what Pat Lawler and Joe Katz are going

[01:07] for in the game.

[01:08] And this is why the game is the way you are perceiving it, Canada.

[01:12] We're going to talk about that on this episode of Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[01:16] I'm going to read some of your commentary on the game.

[01:19] All right.

[01:20] I'm going to talk about the conversation on Canadian Pinball's Facebook page because I'm

[01:23] starting to do more and more posting there and it's a great place to share your feedback

[01:29] with me other than our Canadian Pinball at gmail.com address.

[01:33] So if you're not a friend of mine on Facebook, please join.

[01:36] All right.

[01:37] All right.

[01:38] So here's before we get into Wonka again.

[01:41] Let's talk about the Catwoman Edition Translate and you'll see on this podcast, the image

[01:47] I use is hysterical.

[01:50] Any photoshopped of Fonzie jumping the shark.

[01:54] Yeah.

[01:56] Jumping the shark from Happy Days, holding the Catwoman Cat under his arm.

[02:00] So if you look at the Translate, I didn't even notice this.

[02:03] This is how like distracted I was by the lack of effort by Stern Pinball with this Catwoman

[02:09] Edition.

[02:10] I didn't even notice on the Translate.

[02:13] Catwoman is awkwardly holding a cat statue under her arm in such a weird way.

[02:20] It doesn't even seem physically possible to hold such a heavy cat statue like that nor

[02:25] would she ever hold one like that.

[02:28] And it just looks so bad.

[02:30] This game, this game is going to go down as probably the most half-assed lazy attempt

[02:37] at creating a special edition of a game.

[02:40] And they didn't do anything.

[02:41] They didn't even change the T-molding color to black.

[02:46] That's how lazy Stern is right now.

[02:49] They are just, George is like, and Gary are just like, what do we got?

[02:52] What parts we got left over?

[02:53] We'll just slap some of this on there and put a new Translate and then call it a day.

[02:58] Oh yeah.

[02:59] And hey, for the first 100 of you, you get a signed card that costs us 20 bucks.

[03:04] Lazy.

[03:05] And people are seeing it more than ever.

[03:08] People are seeing right through Stern's lazy attempts at giving you special versions

[03:13] of these games.

[03:14] And look, it's not us that's calling it special.

[03:17] But it's them.

[03:18] They put more work into the flyer to get you excited about this game than they did the

[03:23] game itself.

[03:24] So congratulations.

[03:25] Give the guy who does the Stern flyers or raise because everyone else should be fired

[03:29] for this atrocity.

[03:31] Look, it doesn't really matter.

[03:34] If you want a Batman 66, go get one.

[03:36] It's one of the greatest Stern Pimball games they've ever made.

[03:39] And guess who's saying that?

[03:40] Pretty much everyone who's played it.

[03:42] Sure, it's a little clunky.

[03:44] But it is the best code it game I think Stern has ever done.

[03:48] I think it's Lyman Sheets's masterpiece.

[03:50] And I also think Batman 66 is the reason why I am looking at Willy Wonka, like what the

[03:56] hell is this code?

[03:58] We'll talk a little bit about that on this podcast.

[04:01] And then the Munster's edition, the color edition, who cares?

[04:04] Stern was going to do this from the very get go.

[04:06] But the big question with Stern is this, how are they doing right now?

[04:11] If you look at it, I really do think they have about four titles in a row that have to

[04:17] have been mediocre sales titles for them.

[04:19] And Black Knight is just, you don't even see many unboxings.

[04:24] I mean, this game is seemingly a sales flop, a disaster.

[04:31] And we knew Stern was really nervous about this game.

[04:34] And I had inside information to people at Stern who said that, they let Steve Richie make

[04:39] this game.

[04:40] And look, the only reason I think this game is a sales disaster is a few reasons.

[04:44] I think the game is brutally hard.

[04:46] It's brutally hard.

[04:47] Sure, the tournament players love it.

[04:49] And because they like stuff that is super challenging and that's great.

[04:53] But for everybody else, the game is brutally hard and fast and whatever.

[04:57] And also, the game is barren.

[05:00] There's no way around it.

[05:01] There's not much in the game.

[05:02] You can't stand over a Black Knight and feel like you're getting your money's worth anymore.

[05:07] And Stern's formula.

[05:09] Just everything costs the same regardless of what we put in it.

[05:12] It's not working.

[05:14] It can't be working as well as it used to.

[05:16] Okay, they're still doing well.

[05:18] Don't get me wrong.

[05:19] I mean, Stern, if you go into Stern's factory today, I guarantee you it looks a lot more

[05:24] productive and a lot more activity is going on than if you went into any other pinball

[05:29] manufacturer's factory right now.

[05:31] Okay, but that being said, Stern has expectations of how many titles each game will sell.

[05:38] And you have to imagine that Deadpool, Beatles, the monsters and Black Knight have not reached

[05:46] or exceeded their expectations for these games, which leads a lot of people to speculate

[05:50] one thing is going to happen.

[05:52] And no, it's not Jurassic World's going to save the day because I don't think it is.

[05:56] It leads us to one speculation that Stern is going to get a vault edition on the line

[06:02] and go back to a sweet spot in their history and remake a game that they know a lot of people

[06:09] want.

[06:10] And I, for one, I'm just here to tell you, I'm so sick of waiting for a Tron vault edition

[06:15] or Lord of the Rings vault edition, just either make them or don't.

[06:20] I don't think they're going to make either one.

[06:22] I do think that Stern has a bit of an issue with licensing with the vault editions.

[06:27] Okay.

[06:28] And also, like, it's probably not the easiest thing to part up a, make more parts of a game

[06:34] that's like 10 years old or whatever.

[06:36] I don't know.

[06:37] I don't know.

[06:38] But look, look, it's May.

[06:41] And I think sales on all these titles are just not rolling in.

[06:45] And we're starting, I bet distributors are sitting on so much inventory right now, which

[06:51] is not good, which is not good.

[06:53] And I think a lot of what people have been saying and in the comments to me is accurate.

[06:58] Where are the themes connected to the contemporary properties that people are in love with?

[07:05] Where's Avengers Endgame Pimball Machine?

[07:08] Where is stuff that's currently relevant?

[07:11] Think about it.

[07:12] Black Knight.

[07:13] You're making a Pimball theme based on an ancient Pimball game from like 30 years ago,

[07:18] okay?

[07:19] Monsters?

[07:20] A TV show from what like 1960, like four?

[07:24] Right?

[07:25] And then the Beatles, same year kind of, the 60s.

[07:30] Stern, it's 2019.

[07:33] How about some more creativity in your theme selection?

[07:36] How about something that appeals to people, I don't know, between the ages of 30 and 50?

[07:40] I mean, all these themes are going after guys who are like 60 and tournament players.

[07:46] And they're not making contemporary titles right now for guys who are home collectors

[07:52] and the wonder sales have sort of tapered off.

[07:55] Now here is the thing.

[07:57] Here's the thing.

[07:58] Here's, before I read your comments, here's what I heard about Willy Wonka and here's

[08:01] what I think is happening.

[08:03] And I think this deserves its own show, which is why you're getting its own show.

[08:07] Something is happening in Pimball and I think this is going to be a real issue in Pimball.

[08:13] And I think someone needs to figure this out.

[08:16] And I think one person understands this and understands how to code games properly for

[08:21] the current state of Pimball and his name is Lyman Sheets.

[08:24] But here's where everyone else is failing.

[08:26] Okay?

[08:27] And here's what has affected the monsters and is also what I think going to be the Achilles

[08:31] Heel of Willy Wonka.

[08:33] They are now coding these games.

[08:35] They are now coding these games to be simpler and to be engineered for location play.

[08:44] And that is why you're seeing a much shallower code in the monsters.

[08:49] They just want something that doesn't have long ball times and something that will work

[08:53] well on location.

[08:54] And if you think about the monsters, for example, that game is great when you play it on location.

[08:59] Right?

[09:00] It's like you go up to it.

[09:01] You have some fun for a few minutes.

[09:03] You play it again.

[09:04] It's fun.

[09:05] There's not a lot of depth.

[09:06] But on location, that's totally fine.

[09:09] If you own that game and you bring it home, it's a complete, you know, it's shallow.

[09:15] It's too shallow to own.

[09:16] There's no, you won't have long term enjoyment with a game.

[09:20] Code it like that.

[09:21] Okay.

[09:22] Can we agree with that?

[09:23] All right.

[09:24] I'm just pretending I hear you say yes, Canadian, you're right.

[09:26] And then the other end of the spectrum is like Pirate to the Caribbean.

[09:30] A game that's way too complex in its coding.

[09:33] Way too much going on.

[09:35] 22 character selections on location that games a disaster.

[09:39] It's a nightmare to try and figure out that game on location.

[09:42] But in the home environment, people love it.

[09:45] Right?

[09:46] So it's like one or the other.

[09:47] Now, now the sweet spot is Batman 66 code.

[09:52] Lime and Sheets knows how to make a game that on location, it's fun.

[09:54] It's immediately enjoyable.

[09:56] But if you own it, there's so many different ways to play the game.

[09:59] One is a genius because he knows how to make games that are deep but not confusing.

[10:05] Deep but not confusing.

[10:07] They're simple yet there's depth and there's complexities, but the complexities of them

[10:14] are not hard to understand.

[10:17] Right?

[10:18] There's a difference between complexity, which means there's a lot of different things

[10:21] going on and confusion.

[10:23] And I think a lot of games that go too deep, they lead to confusion.

[10:28] Here's to the Caribbean, for example, all right?

[10:30] Shut up all you pirate owners who are screaming at your earphones right now.

[10:33] I don't buy it.

[10:34] All right, so here's the thing.

[10:36] Now, I'm hearing this.

[10:37] I'm hearing the reason why Willie Wonka is the way Willie Wonka is is because Pat Lawler

[10:44] wanted to make a game that was for location play where the ball times, where the game times

[10:51] would be three minutes or less per ball.

[10:54] He didn't want to make a game that had super long ball times, didn't want a game that

[11:00] was coded with super depth and complexity per se.

[11:04] And that is why Willie Wonka is shaping up to be the way it is.

[11:09] Someone forgot to tell Pat Lawler that his most successful game of all time, Adams Family

[11:15] is a mode based game.

[11:17] And those modes are based on the movie Adams Family that people loved.

[11:21] Someone forgot to tell him that.

[11:23] Someone forgot to tell him that dialed in is a mode based game.

[11:26] And the reason why people who own that game enjoyed is because of those modes.

[11:30] So is this the case?

[11:32] Is this the case?

[11:33] What is Willie Wonka being made specifically for location play?

[11:39] And we're starting to like maybe unravel that that might be the case.

[11:44] And so let's talk about that for a minute before I read your commentary, all right?

[11:48] So if you think about it, it starts to make sense.

[11:51] There's not a lot of complexity in the mechanisms.

[11:54] They wanted to make a game that would be operator friendly that wouldn't break as much, not

[11:59] nearly as much in Willie Wonka as we see in games like The Hobbit and Wizard of Oz and

[12:04] dialed in, right?

[12:07] And Pirates of the Caribbean.

[12:08] And I think if you think about why most people are starting to, you know, if you pinpoint

[12:13] one disappointment from people, it's that Jersey Jack has always thrown a ton into the

[12:18] game.

[12:19] And then you see Willie Wonka, it doesn't seem to be on the same level in terms of what's

[12:23] in the game.

[12:24] Now, I disagree a little bit with that because I've played the game and there is a lot in

[12:28] the game and there's a lot of shots in the game.

[12:30] But just from an observatory standpoint, you're not going to see as much as wise.

[12:36] Why has it got two upper play fields?

[12:37] It's got all this stuff.

[12:38] It's got monkeys.

[12:39] It's got this.

[12:40] It's got crystal balls.

[12:41] It's got trees.

[12:42] It's got witches that come up, right?

[12:43] A lot of stuff in that game.

[12:46] Not nearly as much in this.

[12:48] Okay, so they wanted to make a game that would be more reliable.

[12:51] They wanted to make a game that was operator friendly.

[12:54] Now, so that's just from a physical standpoint.

[12:57] So let's yank out a lot.

[12:58] Let's not put in stuff that's going to break and be problematic.

[13:01] Okay, fine.

[13:02] I think the game shoots amazingly well.

[13:04] I have no problem with the game shots.

[13:06] I have no problems with the game's artwork.

[13:08] I have no problems with the game's mechanisms.

[13:11] I think it's fine.

[13:13] Okay, but here's where again, where I think the problem lies is because they wanted to

[13:17] make a game for operators and on location play.

[13:21] They're coding the game to be for on location play.

[13:25] And they are making this game to not have the depth and the mode-based kind of gameplay

[13:32] that people want in a home use environment.

[13:35] And I need to just say something and I'm just going to say it and I hope everyone over

[13:40] at JJP listens to me and I would say this to Jack.

[13:43] Jack Pimball games are for the home collectors.

[13:47] They are not for location play.

[13:51] They are too expensive for location play.

[13:56] And they don't make any sense for operators to buy one when they can buy a Stern Pro,

[14:01] which is half the price and has themes that are more appealing than most JJP games.

[14:07] And I think that the problem with this company right now and again, I hate saying this because

[14:13] again, I love the way the game shoots.

[14:14] I think Pat Lawler is sort of misguiding this company and I think Pat Lawler has too much

[14:20] control over there.

[14:22] And I think Pat Lawler is like chasing his housey and days of old and wants to have this

[14:27] like the most popular game out on location and he doesn't understand that his new buyer

[14:34] base is the home collector and everything they do for these games should be about giving

[14:40] the home collector what they want.

[14:43] And I think this approach of shorter ball times and not as much in it and this and that,

[14:48] it's going to do nothing but turn off the home collector to these games.

[14:55] But that's JJP's target.

[14:58] And again, I mean, use the word marketing over and over again.

[15:01] This company is being led astray.

[15:05] I think Pat again, if this was Pat's decision not to code Willy Wonka and not to have,

[15:12] and it must have been, who do you blame or who's responsible for this design direction of

[15:17] the game?

[15:19] Because think about it, they must have sat down together, Joe and Pat and said, here's

[15:25] what we're going to do and then here's what we're going to put into the game and it's

[15:28] going to work like this.

[15:30] Someone had to say it's not going to be modes based on the clips from the movie that we

[15:35] all love and then they went ahead and did that and it's a huge mistake and I don't know

[15:42] what to tell you.

[15:43] I think they're their egos and their desires to reclaim some of like, yes, their years,

[15:50] moments of fame out in the arcade have misguided this entire process.

[15:57] And if you think I'm wrong, email me at canadapimbalgemo.com, but I'm telling you, you know what

[16:04] email I didn't get yesterday?

[16:05] I didn't get an email from Joe Katz.

[16:07] He's got my email.

[16:09] Someone must have shared the show with him.

[16:10] I'm not getting any response from anyone at JJP saying all that stuff you've saying,

[16:15] Chris, it's going to be in the game.

[16:17] So why, you know, silence speaks volumes when you're saying like, oh, here's the thing

[16:23] that we need in this game.

[16:25] All they have to do is say it's going to be in the game.

[16:28] Now you might be saying like, what are you on a crusade to get them to insert this into

[16:31] the game?

[16:32] Well, maybe I am.

[16:34] And maybe JJP always needs some of this harsh feedback to make the proper changes to

[16:41] the game.

[16:42] But you know, it's a bummer.

[16:44] It's a bummer.

[16:45] So let me read some of your commentary because I put up a post on Facebook about this and

[16:49] I got a lot of responses and I think it's interesting to see what your take is on this

[16:54] game.

[16:55] All right.

[16:56] Okay.

[16:57] So I got a response from William Gunnady.

[16:59] He says, I agree with your concerns.

[17:01] Those concerns were what I believe a lot of us who viewed the reveal and first days of

[17:06] a release thought.

[17:08] There are plenty of games that shoot well, but shooting well is only part of the secret

[17:13] sauce.

[17:14] I've bought new titles, new unboxed the last six months and got a JJP Pirates and it's

[17:20] a great game, but it takes me feeling guilty about not playing to hit the start button.

[17:27] Guardians of the Galaxy with the something code is highly addictive on your recommendation.

[17:34] I picked up bat, wait, highly addictive on your recommendation.

[17:36] I picked up Batman 66 Ellie, amazingly fun, immersive game, clunky, but you keep wanting

[17:43] to play.

[17:44] I hope JJP answers the questions you posted because I've owned three of them and so far I'd

[17:51] say that they haven't had a game that hits enough boxes to be a keeper.

[17:56] All right.

[17:57] So then Darren, Stinger said, I enjoyed the game when I played it and thought it is really

[18:01] good even with early code.

[18:03] The Wankatania mode is super awesome and some amazing lighting effects.

[18:08] Yeah, it is really cool, Darren.

[18:11] But here's the thing, when you see that mode going, why aren't we seeing the video clip

[18:17] of Willie in the boat?

[18:20] And to me, that's just it.

[18:22] Like do they not have permission?

[18:24] Like where is he in that scene, which is so iconic, came in the kids in the boat and all

[18:29] that weird stuff going on.

[18:30] Oh, I got it.

[18:31] Okay.

[18:32] So I'm going to email from Andrew, Andrew Done.

[18:35] Wow.

[18:36] I'm selling your Batman super Ellie and all in on Wankat as the best pin ever to worried

[18:42] in 30 days.

[18:43] Absolutely, Andrew.

[18:44] I did.

[18:46] I'm worried.

[18:47] I'm worried.

[18:48] Is the only thing that wasn't far along when I played it was the code and now we're seeing

[18:50] more and I don't know if I'm liking what I see.

[18:54] Steve Wiltshire said, I agree with your concerns.

[18:56] I would have bought pirates, had its assets and mode based storyline play.

[19:02] Wankat is early yet, but they haven't shown anything yet to make me believe.

[19:06] It is similar to the asset usage of Waz Hobbit.

[19:10] Voice your concern to Jack and wait to see how code develops.

[19:14] Obviously, you have time to decide.

[19:17] This does however really concern me for Toy Story and how its assets will be used.

[19:23] Toy Story is a must for me, assuming only that it isn't lacking like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:29] That said, I do have faith that JJP will make a great game regardless.

[19:35] Just like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:38] There is a cloud hanging over how they're going to do Toy Story.

[19:42] We know Toy Story originally had asset issues like Pirates of the Caribbean, but they went

[19:48] back to renegotiate that.

[19:50] The hopes are high for Toy Story.

[19:53] I think everyone just hopes it's not a re-skin of dialed in.

[19:57] Wes W.

[19:58] Wes was Kowski.

[20:00] He said, I listen to your podcast on the Drive Into Work.

[20:04] I definitely understand where you're coming from and transparency and elaboration on forward

[20:10] trajectory would benefit Pimbal manufacturers more so than detract.

[20:15] But unfortunately, that's not how this business seems to operate.

[20:19] My thinking is this game needs to net a large vast target market versus a smaller one of

[20:26] enthusiasts that can pick up and grasp mode-based play sans confusion.

[20:33] That line of thinking doesn't gel so well with children, older folks, and non-Pimbal

[20:39] playing people.

[20:40] Which given the IP, I'm assuming that market has as much or more value as any other, keep

[20:46] up the good work.

[20:47] So Wes, what Wes is saying is, maybe Chris is just making this game for a broader audience

[20:51] and that's why it's much more simple and that's why they don't want to have it be too

[20:55] deep and too complex.

[20:57] Wes, you might be right, but I think if they do that, I think if they do that, it's

[21:02] a mistake.

[21:03] And some people are saying this, it's like what it feels like a slot machine.

[21:07] It's just a real quick instant gratification game that doesn't have a lot of gratification

[21:13] in the long term.

[21:15] I just hope it doesn't go that way because you can't, you can do both.

[21:20] You can do both.

[21:22] Batman 66 is bald.

[21:24] People come over my house.

[21:25] They've never played much Pimbal.

[21:26] I explain to them, just hit any of these shots twice.

[21:29] You'll start a mode and you're playing one of the characters.

[21:31] They love it.

[21:33] They're into the game.

[21:34] And when they leave, the game is still here for me to do a lot more in that I don't have

[21:38] to tell them about, but you can definitely do both.

[21:42] And I'm just not sure it's going to do both.

[21:45] Ian Haberman said, I don't need Wanka to retell the movie.

[21:50] Just make a fun pin is all I ask.

[21:53] If the modes are cool and all the confirmed wizard modes turn out to provide hours of entertainment,

[21:58] I'm all good.

[21:59] Well, see Ian, I disagree.

[22:01] Here's why.

[22:02] The wizard modes provide out.

[22:03] You know what?

[22:04] Most people don't get to wizard modes.

[22:07] Getting to the wizard mode is what's fun in Pimbal.

[22:10] And the journey to the wizard mode should be awesome.

[22:12] And in Willy Wonka, I'm sorry, but the journey to wizard modes should be like the scenes

[22:18] from the movie that we love.

[22:19] I want to collect the tickets.

[22:20] I want, you know, I want to see those scenes of the kids collecting the tickets.

[22:24] I want to see all the different rooms.

[22:25] I want to see all the different, you know, the everlasting gobstopper scene.

[22:29] I want to see the scene with like, you know, violet eating the bubble gum and turning into

[22:33] a blueberry.

[22:34] I want to see that stuff in the game.

[22:36] I don't want it to just be about collecting multi balls and collecting Wanka bars to

[22:41] exchange for big points.

[22:43] That's the same strategy as monsters and it's why monsters is sitting idle in terms of

[22:49] distributor boxes, all right?

[22:50] Tom Watson said, I actually wrote up a couple paragraphs with almost the exact concern

[22:55] after watching streams and was going to email after hearing your podcast about feeling

[23:02] the attack for your reaction, sorry, sorry, pockets about feeling the attack for your reaction

[23:08] in the in Wanka.

[23:09] I decided to wait and see the final code before projecting my concern.

[23:13] I think you nailed what maybe a major issue with the game.

[23:17] I feel they drop the ball on the right approach to immersion under the glass.

[23:21] I get to play tonight for the first time and I will tell you if my streaming thoughts match

[23:25] my play experience.

[23:26] All right.

[23:27] Well, look, everyone's going to love shooting this game.

[23:29] That's not the problem.

[23:31] The problem won't be shooting this game and also the problem won't be like playing the

[23:34] game for the first time as you guys heard my excitement in this game.

[23:37] I reacted to that.

[23:38] I think what they were going for is this game will be really fun to flip.

[23:42] You will jump on this game and you will have a lot of fun flipping the game, but owning

[23:46] it, owning it and then making it a magical.

[23:50] You want every look.

[23:51] I'm just going to say we want this game to be like a classic.

[23:55] We want it to be one of the best pinball machines ever.

[23:57] For it to get there, it also needs to have the right kind of code in the game.

[24:02] I got another response from Danny Franks.

[24:04] He said, have I been away too long from Pinside and the pinball community?

[24:09] We now care what this clown has to say.

[24:11] Is he talking about me?

[24:12] Let me see.

[24:13] I think he is.

[24:14] Oh, and then, yeah.

[24:16] Danny, thank you for calling me a clown.

[24:20] Someone else, Tim Hampton responded, buddy, who the FRU here trolling his page?

[24:25] Did the cat piss in your sandbox today and you need a new place to play?

[24:29] All right.

[24:30] Let's see.

[24:31] Danny Franks.

[24:32] Danny, you know what?

[24:34] We love you brother.

[24:35] Thanks for coming on the page.

[24:36] You had at least like my page to comment.

[24:38] All right.

[24:39] So Matthew C. Robert says, I thought there were six wizard modes coming.

[24:43] Those are modes.

[24:44] Personally though, I love scared stiffards.

[24:47] Uncomplexity, especially on location.

[24:49] All right, Jeff Wilson says, can he just pinball podcast?

[24:53] He says, I canceled my collector's edition order, which I made largely because you and

[24:59] I seem to have very similar views on what pinball is lacking and the bluh that Stern has

[25:05] been putting out lately, taking advantage of this boom with simple games and good themes.

[25:11] So when I heard your podcast about Wonka, I jumped on it.

[25:15] I wasn't extremely disappointed, but I certainly didn't see everything you had described.

[25:21] What we all have been waiting for, you know, and like I made my choice on my own inclination.

[25:26] He says, however, I canceled and bought the last pirates CE you talked about.

[25:33] And I'm now one of the J.J.P. Pirates of the Caribbean, which I think is one of the best

[25:37] games ever.

[25:38] Okay.

[25:39] So look, Jeff canceled his Wonka and bought Pirates CE and Jeff congrats on your pirates.

[25:45] Hopefully your starpost aren't chipping your playfields, which is happening in all those

[25:50] pirates games right now.

[25:52] But I think the CE is have a washer underneath Kyle wrote, I suggest sending Jack a direct

[25:57] question on three and four.

[25:59] If you haven't already, he's talking about my questions.

[26:01] People have been asking about it since the unveil on the questions I had in my post,

[26:07] where this people three and four.

[26:09] So so far, no clips with Sound are found in the game.

[26:13] The iconic scenes we know aren't going to appear with video sound like they did in Hobbit

[26:17] and was so, oh yeah, us Jack straight up.

[26:20] What's the deal here?

[26:21] Let's get an answer.

[26:22] People want an answer.

[26:23] All right.

[26:24] I got another note from to do do do kale Davis.

[26:29] weren't you croning that this sorry, croning, am I even like, is that even a word crowning?

[26:35] Sorry gentlemen.

[26:36] I'm not even going to edit that out.

[26:38] I'm going to turn to you, croning.

[26:40] This is the best game ever.

[26:42] Yeah, kale.

[26:43] Am I starting to look a little bit like a pinball hypocrite now?

[26:47] But I'm allowed to change my mind.

[26:49] I'm allowed to change my mind.

[26:50] All right.

[26:51] So then Mike Castleman said, did you not play it and like it enough to cut a check for

[26:56] one?

[26:57] Yes.

[26:58] I did play it.

[26:59] I did cut a check.

[27:00] I assumed, I assumed a big assumption that all of what I've been saying the last

[27:06] couple episodes would be in the game by now because we're hearing these games are supposed

[27:10] to ship in June.

[27:11] And now I'm very worried because I don't think that stuff's going to be in the game.

[27:14] All right.

[27:15] Brian Mallard says, waiting on my order until I can see how code develops as an Ellie buyer,

[27:21] there's no urgency order right away.

[27:24] Filling the holes in the lineup with some system 11s for now.

[27:27] All right.

[27:29] Brandon Hoffman said, maybe you bought too soon.

[27:31] I didn't buy anything.

[27:32] It's a refundable deposit.

[27:34] Paul Strode said, I'm worried about play filled issues.

[27:36] The last two games have had extremely poor quality issues, not the caliber we have come

[27:42] to expect from JJP.

[27:43] All right.

[27:44] Well, here's the thing.

[27:45] Here's the thing.

[27:46] I also got one more funny note I got to read you guys in my Facebook page and I'm going

[27:50] to go to my Gmail.

[27:51] Oh gosh.

[27:53] You know, happy Friday everybody other than these issues, right?

[27:57] There's a lot, you know, there's a lot more to be happy about than sad about with Pimble.

[28:01] But anyway.

[28:02] All right.

[28:03] I'm going to read the curse word, but you guys will enjoy this from Scott Millman.

[28:08] He says, love the show.

[28:11] Don't take this the wrong way.

[28:13] Wanka.

[28:14] He said, Samuel, mother, F and Jackson just walked into the room with his crazy see-through

[28:19] the BSI's and he is looking directly at you.

[28:23] You are now reconsidering Wanka.

[28:26] That's really MF and interest in giving the raving F and reviews on it.

[28:30] I got a suggestion for you.

[28:32] Send the F up.

[28:33] That's right, man.

[28:34] The F up.

[28:36] How the F will anyone take anything you F and say seriously if you get so F and wobbly

[28:43] in the knees after you overanalyze the mother F and gain.

[28:48] Man up mother F for to get the story from Jack and while you are at it, tell the slick

[28:54] F for to release the mother F and C before the L's.

[28:59] Get on the phone or better yet.

[29:01] Drive your happy ass down to his place and talk to the man to make the man get it right

[29:08] in the head.

[29:10] Samuel, Jack, and just walked out the door and left you with a collouaburger.

[29:15] He said, look, chill out.

[29:17] Have a great day.

[29:18] If it don't turn out, it's fine.

[29:20] But you will be armed with the experience of playing it in your home and be educated with

[29:24] the experience.

[29:26] That's from Scott.

[29:27] Well, Scott, thank you.

[29:29] Look, I am not worried that people are going to be like, oh my God, like how did Chris

[29:33] changes opinion about this game because everybody welcomed to the real world in which our

[29:39] opinions about things, are we not allowed to change our opinions about stuff?

[29:44] Are we not allowed to like play something really enjoyed the first time but then go back

[29:49] again and expect a little bit more and then not see what we expected, okay?

[29:54] All right.

[29:55] A few emails that I'm going to let you guys go and let you guys go, okay?

[29:59] How's that sound from Canadian's Pimbal Pockets?

[30:01] Oh, and by the way, yes, the interview with Jerry will be going up this weekend.

[30:05] So if you've been waiting for that, it's coming, all right?

[30:08] I got an email, Pimbal themed mixes from Mark Nellis or Nielis.

[30:15] Hey, Canada, I want to say I've been enjoying the music mixes.

[30:18] Thanks for posting them.

[30:19] I had an idea I wanted to pass along.

[30:21] You know how you have the one where it had all the sound clips from Doc Brown and back

[30:25] to the future mixed in with the music.

[30:28] What if you did some and use iconic Pimbal callouts?

[30:31] There are tons of good callouts you could use.

[30:34] Attack from Mars, Pimbal Gorgar.

[30:36] I think your podcast audience would love that sort of thing.

[30:39] Well, Mark, thank you for the suggestion.

[30:41] I will give that suggestion to my brother who makes the music mixes and I'll tell you

[30:45] right now is answer.

[30:46] If you're ready for it.

[30:47] F, no, he doesn't care about Pimbal.

[30:50] He won't do it.

[30:51] He won't do it.

[30:53] He doesn't care.

[30:54] He makes these mixes to play at different parties and dinners.

[30:57] You know what we do?

[30:58] So imagine those mixes.

[30:59] We get private rooms in New York City, steak houses and we play those mixes for people's

[31:04] birthday parties and Kentucky Derby party.

[31:07] I'm not going to do a party in which I have a Gorgar callout.

[31:11] Nobody's going to care, guys.

[31:12] All right, Wonka Woes is from Robert Campbell.

[31:14] Hey, Chris, Munster's sales fell flat because it was simple rule set and lack luster toys.

[31:21] I like others predicted the color premium would be made after they caught up on production

[31:26] to stimulate more sales, creating a second type of L.E.

[31:29] You know, Robert, it really wasn't hard to predict that.

[31:31] I was like, I had the incredible foresight that they would actually screw us over again

[31:36] and I was right this time as I was every time.

[31:41] He then goes on to say, I fear Wonka may follow suit with an easy rule set.

[31:46] Padding company said this is geared toward location play with a three minute target play

[31:51] time.

[31:52] Your worries about video are felt in my wallet also years ago.

[31:56] I made a wish list of pins that I would have to buy if they were made.

[32:00] A few have now come to life Mustang, Ghostbusters, Medieval madness, Monster Bash and Wonka is also

[32:09] on that list.

[32:10] How is Mustang on that list, Robert?

[32:12] I mean, I just feel like you can't put Mustang.

[32:16] Okay, I'll go on.

[32:17] He says along with pinball circus.

[32:21] What being, I am a roll over buyer when it comes to Wonka.

[32:25] In on a CE before I saw it, soon after seeing the game, I fell back to an L.E. based on

[32:31] Playfield art package.

[32:32] But the longer this takes, the more I contemplate just buying a standard and customizing it to

[32:38] my liking.

[32:39] My collection is basically stern at this point with a DE, AP and spooky tossed in there.

[32:47] I set aside money to buy Pirates of Caribbean, L.E. and then backed out when they removed

[32:52] mechs and didn't get voiced callouts.

[32:54] That money went to Monster Bash remake, L.E. due to J.J.P. falling short.

[32:59] Now I have Wonka money waiting.

[33:02] Where will it go?

[33:03] Is it all on J.J.P.'s updates now?

[33:06] But your point is proven again.

[33:08] If the machine was in box today, I would have paid for my L.E. on launch day and be waiting

[33:14] for my Wonka this week, rather than my Black Knight sword of rage, L.E. pin rambling

[33:21] Robert.

[33:22] Well Robert, congratulations on buying a Black Knight L.E. I think you're the first one.

[33:26] No, I joke.

[33:28] You're right.

[33:30] Absolutely right.

[33:31] Everything Robert says is where a lot of people are at.

[33:34] They're waiting to see.

[33:35] Every day that goes by, every day that goes by, Jack loses sales.

[33:41] Every new stream we get, I think there's less

[33:44] and less excitement in hype.

[33:46] What did I tell them?

[33:47] Don't stream the game.

[33:50] What are his distributors telling him?

[33:52] Stop streaming the game.

[33:54] What is he doing?

[33:55] He's streaming the game.

[33:58] I don't understand it.

[33:59] It's his company.

[34:01] It's their decision.

[34:02] These games should not be out there being streamed.

[34:07] Because here's why.

[34:08] What's really different each stream?

[34:11] Hardly anything.

[34:13] I don't know if a lot more is coming.

[34:16] It is, this code is not .40.

[34:19] That is like a rumor that has people's expectations hoping like there's going to be

[34:23] 60% more going into this game.

[34:26] No, there's not.

[34:28] That is not happening.

[34:31] If that is the case, then why don't they come out and say what is the case?

[34:36] They can tell us on Facebook.

[34:37] They can tell us somewhere.

[34:38] But Joe Katz, Jersey Jack, Pat Lawler, how far along is this game?

[34:43] Be honest with us.

[34:45] Are we going to see what I've been asking on this show?

[34:48] Let us know.

[34:49] I already got an email from Dave Sanders.

[34:52] Dave says, mode-based linearity.

[34:55] Maybe what Joe is saying about Wonka code is this.

[34:58] The thing about Lord of the Rings is it doesn't feel like a mode game or a multiple

[35:02] heavy one.

[35:03] Both elements from part of a much bigger picture or journey and the fact that it doesn't

[35:08] follow any of the story sequence doesn't make one jot of difference to your investment

[35:14] into it.

[35:16] It's much more like an achievement game when you can approach the play from any order

[35:20] that flows organically for you during those three balls.

[35:24] And there's always something to advance no matter where the ball ends up in whatever

[35:28] circumstance.

[35:30] It almost seems like there's actually more content present than is actually there.

[35:35] When you break it down into the component parts.

[35:37] In that respect, it feels very Keith Johnson.

[35:41] The Simpsons Pimball Party has the same rules and content sense to it.

[35:45] And you can tell that's what Pirates of the Caribbean as hamstrung by lack of assets as

[35:49] it was was aiming for as well.

[35:53] How much Keith ended up overcompensating is up to the individual and a topic for another

[35:58] day.

[35:59] Limein is good as this as well.

[36:03] Through his games they don't feel as spread out which is not the same as deep.

[36:08] And you can anticipate some degree of order to what you're doing in case and affect fashion.

[36:13] ACDC and the Walking Dead would be the prime examples that I'd pick.

[36:18] Given that Batman 66 divides itself into seasons, how much linearity does the game have now?

[36:25] By the way, there was another game in that last couple of years where the code had the

[36:29] homage.

[36:30] Hi, homage.

[36:31] Oh, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

[36:34] My parents are, their eyes are rolling that they gave us private school education and I'm

[36:40] saying homage instead of homage.

[36:42] And I can just see Mr. Greg Colton being like this kid can't even talk and he has a podcast.

[36:47] Yeah, Greg, number one pinball podcast.

[36:49] Okay, as homage mode approach, seen by scene as you remember the original media trying

[36:55] to make as many of the original quotes and clips that the game happened in a proper order.

[37:01] And that game is alien.

[37:03] All right.

[37:04] Look, I think also like doesn't Ghostbusters have a, you know, follows like a lineage and

[37:09] sort of like a linear path through the story.

[37:12] But Dave, thank you for the email.

[37:13] Look, I think you're right.

[37:16] I think Lord the Rings is really, you know, what we all love about that game is it's

[37:20] not, you know, you don't have to play an order of the movie.

[37:23] You don't have to play like movie one and then movie two, but it's just so awesome that

[37:27] they have like, you know, the iconic scenes from the movie where you select your mode when

[37:31] you shoot the ring shot, then you have different paths to get to each movie's multi ball.

[37:37] And then you can stack stuff and it's really easy to understand.

[37:40] I just don't think we're going to get just the simplest thing, which is that like those

[37:46] movie modes based upon the iconic scenes in Wanka, the way they would be in Lord the

[37:50] Rings.

[37:51] That's my whole point.

[37:53] All right, Michael Mullen, he's like, I hear Catwoman Batman is cool, but you got to see

[37:58] my Tin Man edition Twilight Zone.

[38:01] All right, so he's got a, there's a picture here.

[38:05] Let's see this.

[38:06] It's a picture of a cat standing on top of his Twilight Zone with a Tin Man.

[38:12] There's two cats on it.

[38:13] So he's actually got physical cats on his game.

[38:15] Well, Michael Mullen, thank you, right?

[38:17] I'm so glad you're, a lot of people's cats enjoy climbing over their pinball machines.

[38:21] It's not about pinball and cats just goes together.

[38:23] All right, got an email from Miles Cameron.

[38:26] Canada, stop with the evaluation of code before a game comes out.

[38:30] Oh, I love these kinds of emails.

[38:32] The code is never finished when a game comes out.

[38:35] It doesn't matter if you purchase a new game from Stern or Jersey Jack or even spooky.

[38:39] All the machines that are produced are not finished for at least one to two years.

[38:43] The smart people wait for two years till the code is done before buying a machine.

[38:48] You know that they will still be selling the machine for two years after they are announced

[38:52] and the code will almost be finished unless your ghost busters.

[38:57] You used to always say wait till the code is done so you can properly evaluate the game

[39:02] why buy a game early.

[39:04] You have no idea what the code will be finished when it will be finished.

[39:08] John.

[39:09] Well, John is a John or Miles Cameron, which one is?

[39:12] Who are you?

[39:14] I agree, but I also think we have enough to go on.

[39:19] And there's a lot in this game right now.

[39:23] And will it take one to two years to finish Willy Wonka?

[39:25] I don't think so.

[39:26] If Jack's current sort of goal to get like two games out a year or two games out every

[39:33] 18 months, he's not going to be able to take two years to code games anymore.

[39:38] He's going to have to get these games complete.

[39:40] And I think that's another red flag for people that because of that stuff is going to end

[39:45] up being much more shallow and simple.

[39:47] Because remember, you can easily code a game like the how long do you think it took to

[39:51] code the monsters versus how long it's taking lime into code Batman?

[39:56] How long do you think it took to keep the code pirates versus the monsters?

[40:00] Right?

[40:01] You want to make a simple code game.

[40:03] Great.

[40:04] But it's not going to you know, it's not going to get heralded as like a must-own

[40:08] from people.

[40:09] All right, let me see.

[40:10] I did get an email and I'm going to end on like a two more.

[40:15] I'm going to start with this.

[40:16] Scott Taman says, Canada, I really don't think we're going to get in Wonka what you're

[40:21] talking about.

[40:22] Narrative, nostalgia, magical scenes and the ability to step into the world of Wonka.

[40:27] I was over the moon when this pin was announced, but then I played it.

[40:30] I'll say that it looks amazing and I think your excitement was totally valid.

[40:34] But there's not one thing in the code that pulls you in.

[40:36] I played the game in Allentown and was totally bored, not just because of the weak flippers.

[40:41] I just don't get it.

[40:43] I collected 30 some Wonka bars.

[40:45] What the hell do I do with them?

[40:48] I don't get to open them to see if there's a golden ticket in one of them so I go in the

[40:52] factory.

[40:53] Then why the hell did I collect them?

[40:55] Oh, bonus points.

[40:56] Er.

[40:57] This Wonka machine was designed like a slot machine.

[41:00] Collect, cash in, see some pretty lights, but it's not giving the story you remember and

[41:06] it won't.

[41:07] If you get this into your home, I think you'll always see it as a missed opportunity, not

[41:12] as a magical machine.

[41:14] Save your money for Guns and Roses.

[41:16] Jersey Jack can knock that out of the park.

[41:19] No need for modes, just great songs, unless they want to make a help axle loose some weight

[41:24] mode.

[41:25] Thanks again for the shows.

[41:27] It's so refreshing, Scott.

[41:28] Well Scott, thank you.

[41:29] Man, I'm starting to feel that way, brother.

[41:31] I'm starting to feel like Guns and Roses.

[41:33] We're all just going to be waiting for the next.

[41:35] All right, let's see.

[41:36] Okay.

[41:37] I did get an email from Carl the Angelo and Carl is, let me just read this to you because

[41:44] I think this will help explain why I was banned from the IE stream.

[41:49] He says, my name is Carl and I run the IE pinball stream.

[41:54] I wanted to extend my apologies for you being, for your banning in the chat during my

[41:59] Wonka stream yesterday.

[42:00] It was the work of one of my moderators.

[42:03] All right, from what I saw in the chat, there was nothing egregious from you.

[42:08] And I even responded to one of your comments in the chat when I had a moment to view the

[42:12] chat.

[42:13] Shortly after banning you, he messaged me of which you'll see the short chat below.

[42:19] It wasn't funny to me and it is not the way I operate my channel.

[42:23] All right.

[42:24] Well Carol, I do, I wrote back to Carl.

[42:25] I thank you for clarifying that.

[42:27] I appreciated it.

[42:28] They unbanned me eventually.

[42:31] And the moderator was like, I just thought it'd be funny to ban Canada.

[42:34] And how silly is that?

[42:36] As I explained before, you don't ban Canada.

[42:40] It has repercussions because I have a podcast.

[42:44] I'm not here to brag.

[42:45] I'm not here to say, you have to give me special treatment.

[42:49] You don't have to do that.

[42:51] But you also don't have to go out of your way to make me out to be some clown or jester.

[42:58] And then it's, see, why is it funny to ban me?

[43:01] So like other people who hate me are like, ha ha, he got shut up again.

[43:05] And now look at what happened.

[43:07] Now we've got two shows up that are probably having more people wonder what they should

[43:13] do versus super excited to buy the pin.

[43:17] And I'm not saying it's because I was banned, but it didn't help.

[43:21] It didn't help matters to do that.

[43:23] Did it?

[43:24] But I do appreciate Carl and Carl.

[43:25] Of course, I accept your apology.

[43:26] First of all, let me just say this, the IE stream of Willie Wonka is the nicest stream

[43:33] I've ever seen.

[43:34] Have you seen the way these guys do it?

[43:36] The cameras are set up on every screen.

[43:37] It was beautiful.

[43:39] This is how it always should have been.

[43:41] This was a better stream than the Buffalo stream when they launched it.

[43:44] I loved watching this stream.

[43:46] I think this is my favorite stream to watch in terms of how good the quality is of that

[43:51] stream.

[43:52] Every other streamer out there, look at how these guys do it.

[43:55] Right?

[43:56] Let's just for a second say, when we do pinball streams from now on, just let people be,

[44:04] let them say what they want in the chats.

[44:06] Just grown men getting offended by people saying whatever they want about pinball is fine.

[44:12] There's one thing to troll, but you're not trolling when you're talking about pinball.

[44:17] It's like if you were watching a stream of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and you're

[44:20] like, wow, the shots look really tight.

[44:22] I don't know if I'm going to enjoy this pin because the shots are tight.

[44:25] I don't care if Chuck is in the room or like his, if they banned you from saying that

[44:29] during the chat, I just will always think that that's lame.

[44:32] All right?

[44:33] Okay.

[44:34] It's Friday.

[44:35] I got to get to work.

[44:37] Everybody.

[44:38] Everybody.

[44:39] You know, let's all do this this weekend.

[44:41] Let's all find a like, let's try to carry a cat the way catwoman is holding the cat in

[44:49] the translate.

[44:50] I want to try and find like a cat statue and walk around New York City like that and

[44:54] ask people if they think I look really stupid and awkward.

[44:58] I can't wait to hear Franchise like response to all that feedback.

[45:01] He's very, you know, he'll give it to us.

[45:03] He'll give it to us.

[45:04] I'm also hearing a rumor.

[45:05] I mean, look, like I'm hearing a rumor.

[45:07] I'm just going to say it.

[45:08] Like I'm hearing a rumor that that Franchise and J.J.P. are really in talks about him doing

[45:14] a next title over there.

[45:16] So will it be Guns and Roses?

[45:17] Look, someone just sent someone, you know, Facebook message me that.

[45:21] I don't, I have no confirmation.

[45:23] Don't do a whole show about it, Chris, saying how wrong Canada is, but that's what I'm hearing.

[45:28] My only advice is this, Chris.

[45:29] I hope you land somewhere.

[45:30] We can't wait to see your work on another game.

[45:32] Here's my advice to you.

[45:34] Don't tell anybody where you're going.

[45:38] Don't you, don't share it.

[45:41] Don't do a podcast about it.

[45:43] Just let the work do the talking and reveal that you're there in the moment in which the

[45:48] game is revealed.

[45:49] I know people will get super excited, but he's going to tell people and then they're

[45:53] going to share people and then it's just going to be out.

[45:55] It's no big deal.

[45:56] It's no big deal.

[45:58] But that's what I'm hearing.

[45:59] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[46:00] So what do you think?

[46:01] Guns and Roses by Franchise, Toy Story by Franchise?

[46:03] I have to assume Toy Story assets are going to come from Disney.

[46:05] So I doubt it's going to be that.

[46:06] But you never know.

[46:07] You never know.

[46:08] All right, everyone.

[46:09] Have a great weekend.

[46:10] Look for the Jerry interview this weekend and I'm done.
