[00:00] Canade is gonna give you every single rumor he knows on this episode.

[00:04] We're gonna talk about Jersey Jack finally speaking about the Playfield issues.

[00:08] How did Canade get Ultraman number 500 and the Deeproot Facebook page is gone.

[00:13] Episode 605 of Canade is pinball podcast.

[00:16] Sherry Sherry baby Sherry Sherry baby Sherry baby baby

[00:31] Silla Silla Silla Silla Silla Silla Silla Silla

[00:35] Ah this is gonna be the podcast.

[00:37] None of the manufacturers are gonna want you to hear because on episode 605 I'm gonna tell you everything I know.

[00:44] All the leaked information all the rumors all the speculation everything canate a nose is going to be shared on this episode of Canade is pinball podcast but more than that more than that while I will talk about these as rumors.

[00:58] I am gonna go on the record as saying I officially think these things are going to happen.

[01:04] I am not gonna present them as questions we're gonna talk about that and how Rob T is confused why more people are not given him credit for the Steve Richie.

[01:13] He's gonna be going over to J.J. P news because he knew it but he presented it as a question that's not how you do it Rob.

[01:21] I respected you shared the information but you got to be more definitive in saying this is happening.

[01:28] And then we're gonna talk about Jersey Jack pinball and how Jack Winari himself has gone on the record and said what he thinks about the Playfield issues over at Jersey Jack pinball.

[01:40] We're gonna talk about Jersey Jack pinball's offer to Guns and Roses owners with Playfields and with Playfield issues and what they will do for you.

[01:49] I'm gonna tell you what I did because I reached out to J.J.P. and I will take them up on this offer. I'm gonna explain why I'm doing that.

[01:57] We're gonna talk about Facebook and Deeproot pinball and how they've removed the Deeproot pinball page from Facebook.

[02:05] We're gonna talk about what that means for most of you in on a Raza but for most of you who are not in on a Raza the comedic club that is Deeproot pinball continues to go on without failure.

[02:15] It continues to entertain us week after week and I think even the most bullish Raza people rooting for it to come out are now realizing it's not looking good.

[02:25] Okay so speaking of not looking good we've seen the Jersey Jack Playfields over the past year and there's no questioning whether or not that Miracle Playfields

[02:34] and Jersey Jack pinball have once again experienced a sort of catastrophic quality control issue and no one has covered this more than Canada's pinball podcast and so we have been watching this company and waiting for this company to respond to this issue and finally this week two things happened.

[02:54] So the first thing that happened is Jersey Jack pinball announced that they would be giving guns and roses owners a chance to buy at cost new playfields for guns and roses and I said this this is something that I said Jersey Jack pinball should offer don't charge people more money because usually a playfield is around a thousand dollars so they are giving people with a guns and roses a chance to buy brand new playfields at 499 dollars for the major playfield and I think the other ones around a hundred dollars.

[03:24] So I'm glad they are giving people this option should they have given people who have problematic playfields these playfields for free.

[03:34] That's the big question mark and I look I do still think if you bought a brand new pinball machine and you're seeing some of the issues with these games with the chipping and the pooling and some of the artwork gets removed from your game.

[03:47] If you open up a game and you're having issues like that why do you have to spend any more money to replace it and repair the game that should have came from the factory without any of those issues.

[03:59] Now we all know that Jersey Jack pinball was never going to send anybody fully populated playfields that was never going to be an option.

[04:07] The second best option would have been free playfields for people who have problems they did not do that either.

[04:13] The problem with that is there's just too many guns and roses machines out there and there are also too many machines with issues and they know this.

[04:21] This isn't just like a tiny tiny tiny tiny sample size there are probably a few hundred if not more machines that are experiencing playfield issues and out of the thousands of machines they will make who knows how many of those machines will do.

[04:36] This is how many of those machines will develop issues over time because something is wrong with how Mirko is making these playfields.

[04:43] That is so obvious at this point and if you know that something is wrong over at Mirko and it's not consistent not every machine is having issues that's got to be the most frustrating part for Jersey Jack as they can't identify the problem.

[04:59] Because it's not happening on every game but the games it does happen on it's really bad.

[05:05] Okay so the other option is to give people a chance to just buy a new playfield we know that 99.9% of people who buy a backup playfield they will never do a playfield swap.

[05:17] But the whole reason of having it is just one thing and one thing only it's just for the peace of mind if you have that playfield.

[05:26] Underneath your bed you are much more likely to turn on your guns and roses machine and just play it and enjoy it even if you see pooling even if you see a chip.

[05:37] You're still going to enjoy it knowing that one day down the road you could swap in that new playfield and your game will be brand new again.

[05:46] That's what this is. This is $499 for peace of mind and from someone who lives in New York City $499 is the price of a dinner.

[05:57] Okay so I am fine spending this money. I reached out to Barry at Jersey Jack Pimball with the serial number of my guns and roses CE number 500 and I said Barry I would like to be put on the list to buy a Guns and Roses collector's edition replacement playfield swap.

[06:15] I am taking them up on this offer. I know it's not the most ideal thing. I don't even know if my game has issues or not but I just want to have this backup and I'm taking them up on the offer that they put out into the world.

[06:32] Now I have not heard back from Barry yet. I would like to hear back a confirmation and it would be nice for canated to tell all of his listeners that Barry got my email any responded and we're all good because that's the other thing we know we're not going to get these replacement playfields for a while they said summer of 2022 is when they expect to start shipping out these playfields here is the other thing I heard from a very very reliable source I heard that Miracle playfields is now running guns and roses collector's edition.

[07:01] Guns and Roses collector's edition playfields again which means possibly they might be trying to get the CE owners their replacement playfields first before they handle all the early owners of the game because if you spent the most you maybe get to the front of the line on this customer service policy.

[07:19] Here's the one thing that still hangs over all of this is that nobody knows if they fixed the problem right when you buy your replacement playfield from Miracle how can you trust when you see that Miracle logo on the playfield that this time around right it's like the playfield manufacturer that cried wolf this time around trust us it's going to be good and so the only way you're going to be able to find that out is if you swap in one of these new ones and have no issues and I'm going to get a new one.

[07:49] Again 99% of people will never do that these things will end up underneath everyone's beds or hanging on walls and they will never really be tested the real test for Miracle is going to be guns and roses machines that ship out now and into next year if there are no more issues people will start to feel good and then the real real test right because this always seems like they sometimes fix it mid production the real test is when toys are in the game.

[08:19] The story gets made and those initial games go out those things better be bulletproof but you know what by the time we find out if they are or are not it will be too late if they are not because I think for many of you out there you are going to tread lightly as you move towards new Jersey Jack pins in the future if you've had headaches with your current machines it's just going to be that way they have not restored faith and credibility in people and this move is not going to do that overnight but let's air what you're going to do.

[08:49] Jersey Jack pinball said about this whole issue because this is the first time we've officially heard from anyone over at Jersey Jack pinball about the play field issues and here is what Jack said when he was interviewed by Martin and Jonathan over at the pinball news he did this interview this week let's hear what Jack says about the play fields.

[09:07] Well look things happen in pinball and we have a reputation for many years of taking care of the customer and I'm pretty sure the few people that have problems you know we've made offers to sell play fields at a special price so if somebody feels the need that they want an extra play field at the end of the run of guns and roses they can buy a play field at a special price.

[09:35] So we've been very accommodating to our customer base very respectful of them and we want to build on that I mean the whole company was built on taking care of the customer and I don't think that really I don't think that really changed.

[09:51] I think possibly there are some play fields where people may have done something to the play field to cause damage I don't really know I've seen some pictures where you know as a technician and somebody in the business for dare I say like 46 years I really want to have a damage at heart I don't know and I'm not accusing anybody of anything I'm not saying anything I'm just making casual observance.

[10:20] Jack here's what people did to their machines to cause the play fields to fall apart Jack you ready for it they actually played pinball that's what they did these aren't people tampering with their machines to cause these issues these things have been falling apart by simple pinball use and I wish they would just admit that this isn't on the customer and he kind of blames the customer for these issues what we didn't get from Jonathan and Martin was a follow up question about working with Mirko and Wes

[10:50] and not they're exploring a new pinball manufacturer but I don't think they are I really don't I think it's going to be Mirko all over again so at this point I think we just put a pin in this topic this is it this is their offer this will be their offer and if it satisfies you take advantage of it if it doesn't I don't know what to tell you I just hope we can get back to the point where everyone can enjoy the masterpiece that is guns and roses this is hung over this machine for such a long period of this pinball

[11:20] that is when you put your hands in the middle of the machine for a long period of this time the ball is in your court to make your products higher quality and your customer service and your transparency needs to improve because it has not been great and what Jack said at that interview of how they take care of the customer I hope that is true moving forward it has not been stellar this year and they know that where should we go next before I tell you all the information some of these companies don't want you to know and I'm going to go on the right

[11:50] I mean this I'm gonna say I believe this is gonna happen in pinball and you are going to see this because a lot of people question can he just credibility and they say canada is always wrong as if it's like everybody forgot that I called Mandalorian and Halloween correctly okay so let's talk quickly about deep route pinball's Facebook page being down what does this mean does this mean you're not getting your razas does this mean deep route is done does this mean they made up a legal issue to make another excuse as to why people don't have their

[12:20] games yet and I just want to say there's absolutely no information that points you in a positive direction for this company there's nothing there is no pictures of

[12:30] manufacturing there's no production happening there is nothing that they have shown anybody that would make anyone feel good that this

[12:38] company will be successful that games will come out and that they want to give people an update that makes people

[12:45] feel good and now we're starting to see the removal of deep route content from the internet and that's a real big red flag for people so are they slowly trying to turn this thing off now the good thing is this everyone in the pinball community has captured and chronicled all of the deep

[13:04] route correspondence so deep route is never going to be able to go and undo the things they've said they're never going to be able to go and undo all those

[13:14] videos and all the bold claims and all the hyperbole that Robert and company have put out into the world and the only path forward for

[13:23] this company they only have two options this company only has two outs and the two outs are this the games come out or they go

[13:31] out of business there is no in between there is no in between this is it this is it and look everything points to them not getting these games out there is absolutely zero evidence that this company has

[13:45] manufacturing going and the updates continue to be non updates I don't think it's happening people so speaking about updates haggis pinball is another company that is learning a little bit of a

[13:56] lesson and the lesson for damon and company is this if you tell your customer base that they can expect an update by the end of July or that you think that games will ship by the end of July

[14:07] or you're going to start manufacturing by the end of the July you have to update your customer base on what happened now we know he put up a video saying there were delays because of

[14:17] covid but what they're going to realize now that they've sold 250 plus additions of fathom is they now have 250 people who have sent money in and they just want to know the status of things now

[14:30] remember this company has not really proven that they can make games and make games quickly they definitely have made some counts like they're much further along than deep route

[14:41] but can they make these fathoms in a timely manner and get them out to people they've already missed the deadlines they put out into the world and we see this time and time again

[14:51] I still don't understand why companies do this why they put dates out into the world and then they blow by them like where is the LV version of the pinball brothers alien machine right they said in the summer of 2021

[15:06] we are going to show you the LV version of the game and what is it August now nothing absolutely nothing

[15:13] so once again another pinball company with dates and deadlines misses it the only two companies that actually hit the dates and deadlines they promise are stern pinball and spooky pinball

[15:25] everybody else everybody else blows by their schedule and their deadlines okay let me talk real quickly about a ridiculous item

[15:34] I shouldn't even have to address and that is canada getting ultra man number 500 as a collector's edition with butter cabinet number 500 the last ultra man off the line

[15:47] and I want to tell you the true story of how canada got number 500 it's not because there's any money exchange between me and spooky

[15:54] it's not because spooky pinball is treating me with any special treatment do you want to know how canada got number 500 of ultra man

[16:02] let me let me tell you the true story I simply reached out to them and I said hey I love what you're doing as a company I really appreciate all of your transparency and I'm a supporter of spooky pinball

[16:15] you got to remember the context of this year right in which jersey jack pinball was telling us to punch sand and I wanted to support this company for everything they've been doing I think they're doing it the right way so I wanted to order in ultra man because I think it would go perfectly in my neo Tokyo

[16:32] arcade I'm gonna build in my new home one day and yet the problem is this I don't have the home yet and I don't have room for the game yet and I've got to pay for daycare so I asked spooky pinball would it be possible to get ultra man number 500 for two reasons one is I can't take possession of it yet and I need to wait a year to get the game

[16:53] the other thing is I thought it would be really cool to put number 500 of ultra man next to number 500 of guns and roses and they said well let us see what we can do a few days went by the order banks open and they said if you want that machine we can get it for you okay so I'm getting the last ultra man on the line I love that people are complaining about this people were upset when I got Rick and Morty number 50 they said spooky pinball was giving you special treatment and you got an early one and now people are complaining because I'm not gonna do it again.

[17:23] Because I'm getting the last one by the time I get number 500 let me assure all of you out there you won't even care about ultra man a year and a half from now you're gonna be moving on to so many new interesting titles coming out but I just love this effort and if you go to the pin side thread I love this effort to destroy any happiness that happens in my life.

[17:46] Anything I do to some of those individuals on pin side is always a mistake and anyone who shows support for canada is mistaken and on this horrible person and let me ask all of you out there who are complaining about this did any of you and I mean this did any of you actually ask for number 500

[18:05] ultra man and we're told no okay and I know some of you asked for specific game numbers and you might not have gotten them because of the way it works with like distributors getting certain numbers and that's just how it works this is the end of the line for them and so nobody wanted number 500 until canada asked for it and now all of a sudden it's a big issue.

[18:24] So I do want to thank chucking company for giving me the last one off the line and no I'm not flipping it what kind of person do you think I am you know what a jerk move that would be for me to get this

[18:35] machine after they did this and let me have some time to make the payment with everything going on in my life do you think that would be a cool move for me to take the game and flip it like not even open it not even play it I am not going to sell

[18:48] ultra man number 500 when it's still in a box it will be opened it will be put into my home one day I guarantee it now if I want to sell it down the road and I not allowed to do I got to get permission from the

[19:02] pinside babies who continue to cry about any joy that happens in canada's world you really will find any reason some of you grown men on

[19:10] pinside to give yourselves a wedgie and wake up and get so upset that canada got something and I just want to end with this note for those of you out there who say canada doesn't deserve anything from anyone anything special I've done 600 plus

[19:23] podcast about pinball do you not think that that gives me a little bit more pull or clout with people in the pinball world like these are the same men that again they complain

[19:34] because the restaurant that's booked doesn't have a table for them and then someone who walks and you knows the owner gets a table that's what's wrong with these people they're the ones who feel

[19:44] entitled to everything it's not me I just asked them and they said yes if they had said no that would have been fine as well this wasn't like oh you got a

[19:53] gimme number 500 because I'm canada nowhere in our correspondence was there that so just chill out pinside babies you're making

[20:00] yourselves look stupid right now the fun part drumroll canada is going to tell you everything I know about what's going on in the pinball world

[20:08] behind the scenes and it's this type of information and this type of stuff that separates this show from every other pinball

[20:16] podcast in the history of pinball podcasting nobody else does this nobody else goes on the record and tells you here is what is

[20:24] going to come out in the pinball world and I will do it in a way that is definitive now this is my definitive statement

[20:32] about what I think is happening in pinball and with some of these manufacturers yes you could call these rumors that I

[20:38] am hearing but I am going to go on the record and say I believe this is going to happen and you are going to see this and I am not going to

[20:47] change my mind on these things right now so what I say you can hold me accountable to these statements and I guarantee you I will get some

[20:57] of these correct and there might be a few that I get wrong and it's okay because that is what makes it fun talking about

[21:06] pinball and speculating about pinball and wondering what's going to happen with these companies even Jack Winari when he was

[21:12] interviewed by Martin and Jonathan he said he loves it when things leak he loves it when people are talking and speculating about

[21:19] what goes on with these companies and that's what makes this fun for those of you out there and I know you're listening

[21:26] because you love to hate canada for those of you listening and say what you do is wrong spoiling what's

[21:32] happening in the pinball world spoiling news that's not yours to reveal I don't really care what you think if you think that

[21:40] with what's going on in the world speculating and making statements about what's next in the pinball world is something that we

[21:48] should hold back and hold sacred and keep quiet until the time is right this is not a cure for a disease this is not some

[21:58] solve to a world problem that's really important this is speculative news about what's coming next in the pinball world nobody's going

[22:08] to lose their job over this none of this is going to change the way these games sell no one is going to be negatively impacted by this

[22:16] the only people the only people that might be a little bit bummed out and I mean this are people that might be behind

[22:22] some of these projects and wanted to keep it a secret but the only reason I know about this stuff is because people talk and people share

[22:30] stuff so I'm going to share it with you and the world's not going to come to an end and this is why you win twippies and this is why people

[22:38] listen to canada's pinball podcast because I give you this information I don't have to hold it back so where should we start so the

[22:44] first thing I want to talk about in terms of what I'm hearing behind the scenes is the Steve Richie move to Jersey Jack

[22:50] pinball so here's the conversation I heard from my high up contact over at stern pinball I'm not going to name names but I just

[22:57] asked what was the mood over at stern pinball or what was stern pinball's feeling about Steve Richie moving over to

[23:05] Jersey Jack pinball and basically they said to me look Gary's been very good to Steve over the years Gary

[23:12] has paid Steve well Gary has given Steve a home in which he had the same ability to design games

[23:19] that were like ninja turtles and like Jurassic Park and Steve just didn't put as much in his games as other

[23:25] designers but but people really enjoyed having Steve there and they do look at this move as Steve

[23:32] being disloyal to Gary after everything Gary's done for Steve over the years you know if you're

[23:39] stern you look at this move like as a designer going over to a company that can barely

[23:43] manufacture one game in two years it just seems like a weird move to have Steve go join pat lawler and

[23:50] JJP and even in the interview this wasn't even Jersey Jack pinball poaching Steve Richie Jack says

[23:57] it on Father's Day the two of them were talking and it was Steve Richie who asked Jersey Jack about

[24:03] the possibility of going over there and taking his talents to JJP this whole move is going to be spun a

[24:09] million different ways and the truth is this I don't care if Steve Richie goes over to JJP I

[24:15] really don't the only thing I care about is whether or not good games will be the result of this move

[24:22] we all have seen Steve Richie's latest efforts at stern pinball and they were not good they were

[24:28] not sought after they were not celebrated and it's not to take away that Steve Richie isn't an

[24:32] iconic designer but he hasn't really designed anything great in a long long time and the other

[24:38] vibe I got from my context at stern was just this it's like Steve didn't put in the effort to push

[24:44] his designs forward the same way Keith L Wind did and John Borg has and other people at stern pinball

[24:51] so what's the problem is it the bomb over at stern or is it Steve Richie just doesn't put in

[24:57] the effort to push his games more forward and put more in them and think more creatively see he's

[25:02] not going to have that excuse now at Jersey Jack pinball but here's the thing I just can't wait

[25:06] to see what he creates the only problem is it's probably gonna be years before we see this and I

[25:12] did also hear that Steve is not the easiest person to work with and neither is Pat Lawler so are

[25:19] these two entities gonna get together I mean as two managers at the top of the design pyramid

[25:25] over at Jersey Jack pinball I tend to think it's not gonna be a marriage made in heaven having

[25:30] both of them in there and I almost feel bad for poor Eric because now he's got two senior designers

[25:36] with these pedigrees and legacy that are probably gonna be meddling with Eric's designs and I think

[25:42] it's the other way around I think both of them can learn from Eric Minier and it's not the other

[25:47] way around because Eric's got new ideas and is innovative and is thinking outside the box

[25:52] it's been Steve Richie that's been doing the cookie cutter stuff over the years and that's why

[25:57] people haven't really loved his recent offerings so let's see what happens all right but you didn't

[26:01] tune into this to hear me talk about that move so here is what I am hearing are you ready people

[26:07] drum roll here is some stuff that I am gonna go on the record and say I believe this is gonna happen

[26:13] okay the first thing I'm gonna go on the record for saying the next game from Stern pinball will be

[26:20] Godzilla by Keith Owen with zombie Eddie on artwork now you kind of knew that right okay now here's

[26:27] the next thing I'm telling you that rush will be coming out from Stern pinball and it's been a

[26:33] rumor and people have been talking about it but I'm here to confirm for you that rush pinball will

[26:38] be coming out from Stern pinball I believe after Godzilla and the band have already done their call

[26:45] outs for the game so you're gonna see rush pinball from Stern now here's the part that I'm gonna go

[26:51] on the record and you haven't heard this from anybody else yet I am hearing that rush could be a

[26:57] boutique game and not a game designed by John Boer if rushes a boutique game it means someone

[27:05] commissioned rush to be made or they went to the band rush and said hey look we can make you a pinball

[27:09] machine we don't have to fully design it from the ground up here's here's what's interesting so

[27:15] if rush was a boutique game that means it could be in the supreme cabinet and that design it could

[27:20] be in the primeest package and that design or we never thought about this what if Stern pinball is

[27:27] taking an existing game and makes it rush pinball and just rescinds it I don't think it has to be only

[27:33] the supreme layout with the DMDs or the primeest they might take one of their LCD games and easily

[27:40] rescind it into a rush game but that is what I'm hearing is that rush is gonna be a boutique game

[27:46] and that John Boer's game will follow after that so you're hearing it first on canadus pinball

[27:53] podcast that is what I'm gonna go on the record now this one makes me nervous because of a couple

[27:58] things I know that John Boer and Lyman Sheets are the biggest rush fans and so I do find it's

[28:05] somewhat hard to believe that a rush game would come out and not be done by John Boer but I'm gonna

[28:12] go on the record and take the higher risk bet and say that rush will be a boutique game and John

[28:19] Boer's game will be after okay now are you ready for the real big juggernaut news items okay here

[28:26] we go people so in the interview Jack Winari said that Steve Richie finished a final game over at

[28:33] Stern pinball before he left and made his way to Jersey Jack pinball and I am gonna go on the

[28:39] record and I am going to predict that the last game that Steve Richie worked on and it is complete

[28:46] and it is ready to go into production the last game that Steve Richie worked on over at Stern

[28:53] is James Bond so if you are a James Bond fan and I think this will be a Joe Kamikaw game with

[29:02] Steve Richie and I want to explain why Joe Kamikaw is a humongous James Bond fanatic he's actually

[29:09] building his own James Bond car right now the man loves James Bond so I am predicting that James Bond

[29:18] will be a Kamikaw Stern joint release and it will be a Steve Richie design so Steve Richie James Bond

[29:28] coming out from Stern pinball all right does it end there canada is that enough for people to chew on

[29:33] no I've got some more information I want to share with you and we're gonna end with this one

[29:37] lineman sheets the best coder in all of pinball where's he going where's he gonna apply his efforts

[29:43] does he go over to American pinball and work with Dennis Nordman on his next game because they

[29:48] did Elvira together and the answer is no lineman sheets will not be going over to American pinball

[29:55] here's the big one people so I am hearing and I will go on the record to predict that lineman

[30:00] sheets is partnered up with no other than Steve Richie's brother lineman sheets is partnered up

[30:07] with mark richie and they're working together on possibly two titles now the one that I'm gonna

[30:14] I want to predict and somewhat confirm is that lineman sheets and mark richie are working on CGC's

[30:23] licensed game that you will know the movie as pulp fiction

[30:43] so you're hearing it on canada's pinball podcast that mark richie and lineman sheets will be

[30:48] working on pulp fiction and there is also a sci-fi title coming out from mark richie that probably

[30:54] lineman will be working on as well and the other thing is I do believe that lineman sheets will be

[31:00] helping out on cactus canyon remake I don't think he's an official employee of CGC but I also

[31:07] am gonna go on the record that I believe lineman sheets will be the person who has been doing the

[31:13] code update on cactus canyon remake and this is gonna be the big year for CGC and this year I think

[31:23] CGC is going to probably lap jersey jack pinball in terms of number of titles in terms of quality

[31:31] and that's gonna be where the real battleground is in pinball right now it's gonna be jjp versus cgc

[31:37] because stern is always gonna remain on top but really that second place spot right for premium

[31:43] machines that are loaded with stuff that you're gonna want to buy instantly I think jersey jack pinball

[31:49] is gonna have its greatest competition from Chicago gaming company and I know mark richie has been

[31:55] working really hard behind the scenes on these games and if lineman sheets partners up with mark richie

[32:02] and makes pulp fiction and a sci-fi title that I hear is gonna be epic as well CGC has been a

[32:09] sleeping giant that I think is about to roar and I think it's gonna get everybody excited and now

[32:16] all of you can be excited about this stuff and you tell me that this is bad for pinball you tell me

[32:22] putting this stuff out there is bad for pinball I'll tell you what's bad for pinball boring people

[32:27] over and over and over again with the same stuff and the same discussions this is what makes pinball

[32:33] exciting now we are super excited to see what comes out with toy story we're super excited to see

[32:39] what comes out from cgc with mark richie and maybe lineman sheets coding pulp fiction we're super

[32:44] excited to see what the sci-fi title might be we're gonna be super excited to see cactus canyon

[32:49] remake come out possibly with lineman sheets on code how exciting is it that we've got spooky

[32:54] pinball making two games right how exciting is pinball right now this is one of the greatest

[33:00] periods in pinball history and there's so much exciting stuff to come out but it's not exciting if

[33:06] we don't talk about this stuff or speculate or dream about what's around the corner but canada is

[33:12] going on the record right now to tell you the following I will summarize it again and go to pin

[33:18] side and put my name up there and I want to tell you something rob tea I'm talking to you right now

[33:23] thank you for the Steve richie news but when you want to go on the record and you want to confirm

[33:28] something as being accurate like you knew rob that Steve richie was going to jersey jack pinball

[33:34] but instead of putting your name in a confirming way you should have said I'm gonna tell you guys

[33:40] what's about to happen Steve richie is going over to jersey jack pinball that's how you put yourself

[33:45] on the line with a bit of information like that but to ask it as a question and back up as you say it

[33:52] then you're not going to get the same amount of credit as someone like canada that's going to say

[33:56] I am telling you right now Steve richie is going to make James Bond if you see a James Bond game

[34:02] from stern pinball I bet you would Steve richie's last design that I think rush is definitely coming

[34:08] out from stern pinball that I think mark richie and lineman sheets are working on pulp fiction

[34:12] and these are my bets I think all of these things are gonna happen and I might be wrong on some of

[34:18] it but here's the thing so what if I'm wrong on it but if I'm right on it and I think I am going to

[34:23] be right on most of this stuff that's how you win the twippy that's how you get all the support

[34:30] on patreon because people want to tune in and have this stuff now all the other pinball podcasts

[34:36] out there have all of these great rumors to talk about now pinside becomes even more exciting because

[34:42] you can talk about these things and believe me canada rarely steers you wrong and if I was wrong

[34:49] on this stuff like if it's not going to be mark richie pulp fiction then they would come out and

[34:53] say it but they're not you're not going to hear anything you're just going to hear the sound of

[34:57] canada week after a week saying he's the world's favorite pinball podcaster later

[35:12] be water
