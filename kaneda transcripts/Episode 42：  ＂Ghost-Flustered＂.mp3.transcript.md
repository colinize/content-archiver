[00:00] I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, here's back

[00:11] It's all good, so go get the matter of fact

[00:14] I'm a bitch, I'm a bitch, I'm a fella that you

[00:18] It's the way that I move, the way that I do

[00:22] It feels like that scene in Star Wars where Darth Vader's helmet is just lowered back on to his head

[00:35] That is what it felt like putting the headset on for Canadian pinball podcasts

[00:40] I am Canadian, it has been about two months and I am super excited to be back here talking to you guys

[00:46] I first want to say just thank you to all of the people that have been reaching out and saying

[00:51] I can't stand the other podcast out there, I need some more Canadian pinball podcasts

[00:57] I got about two of those emails, no I'm joking, I got a lot of it from a lot of you guys

[01:01] I want to say thank you for all of those people who reached out

[01:04] It has been super, super exciting to just step away from the pinball podcasting world for a couple of months

[01:11] and just get a new perspective on pinball

[01:14] And I'm happy to share with you guys that new perspective

[01:18] There's so much I want to talk about that I can't do it all in one episode

[01:23] So we're going to break this up into a little bit of a two part Canadian pinball podcast return

[01:28] This is going to be part one, I'll try to get part two up on Wednesday

[01:31] But it is just so, so, so great being back talking to you guys

[01:37] And we have to start this return with the topic that has just been dominating

[01:43] the entire pinball conversation this summer and that is Ghostbusters

[01:48] And you know when I left I said I thought this was going to be the summer of Ghostbusters pinball

[01:53] And I wasn't wrong but it wasn't the way I thought it would be

[01:58] And I think this is a topic that I want to spend some time talking about today

[02:02] Now I have a whole list of things but this is the thing that has really been on my mind over the last couple of months

[02:07] And I really really really think that this is going to create a ripple effect

[02:14] Throughout the whole hobby throughout all of the collecting community

[02:18] And let's go right after it now

[02:20] I think the best way to explain how bad the situation is with Stern and Ghostbusters is that

[02:36] Our good friend Iceman down in Texas, he's one of them, he's a great collector

[02:41] He's very prolific on the message board

[02:44] The man is literally praying and hoping that when his Ghostbusters ships it won't have ghosted inserts

[02:52] Really, this is what we've come to that people are spending $8,000 on a toy

[02:58] That should come to them in perfect play field condition

[03:03] And now we have people with their fingers crossed, anxious, anxiously awaiting there is a see if they got one that has issues

[03:10] And I think that has defined the pinball conversation in this entire summer

[03:15] It's all about that, am I going to get a good one or bad one?

[03:19] And I think this is ridiculous, these things are too expensive for people to feel this way

[03:24] But look, look, I heard Gary Stern is all over it

[03:29] And I was able to go over there and I overheard him talking to the play field manufacturer guys

[03:37] And here's what he was saying to them

[03:39] You call this quality?

[03:44] What is this a fucking joke?

[03:47] You've got some set of fucking balls coming in here with this shit

[03:52] Huh?

[03:54] You stupid Irish smirked

[03:57] Alright, well we can't confirm if it was Irish people making a play field

[04:01] But look, this is just, this is ridiculous

[04:04] So here's my thing, here's the bone I wanted because I know you guys have been talking about this

[04:08] My main issue with this whole ghosted insert fiasco is simply one thing and one thing only

[04:15] It's that Stern pinball, the number one pinball manufacturer is aware of an issue

[04:22] Whether it's ghosted inserts, whether it's slimer mechanisms, whether it's a misspelling on the play field

[04:30] Whether it's a captive ball railing, when they are aware of an issue

[04:36] They don't hit stop on the assembly line, fix the problem before sending out any more pinball machines

[04:43] They continue to ship machines knowing there are issues

[04:48] I have a serious issue with that and that is where I want to focus on this conversation right now

[04:54] Because if Stern continues to do this, they are going to lose a lot of customers

[05:00] How can you trust a company that does this?

[05:04] And I'm the biggest Stern fanboy out there, I love Stern pinball

[05:09] I give Stern pinball so much credit for what they do, what they've done

[05:15] And what they will continue to do in the pinball industry

[05:18] But this is an example of where they are either cutting corners or they are finding themselves in a sticky, icky situation

[05:29] But they're doing the wrong thing

[05:32] And so let's examine the issue

[05:36] Here's the rumor that I heard

[05:40] And I don't know if you believe or not, but there's a few things

[05:43] Because everyone's on a witch hunt, what causes these ghosted inserts?

[05:47] I've heard everything from Stern had a walk out by the experts who did their play field

[05:52] And now they lack the personnel who know how to make the play fields 100% perfect

[06:00] So there's that rumor

[06:02] There's a rumor that they switched the clear coding from alcohol based to water based

[06:06] I don't know, like, okay, there's that rumor

[06:09] There's a rumor that they're not letting the games cure long enough

[06:12] So they're shipping them without ample time for them to dry

[06:16] And that's what's causing the issue

[06:18] There's a rumor that it's shaker motors that are causing the happen

[06:21] And we have people unplugging their shaker motors

[06:23] I mean the whole thing is ridiculous when you really step back and look at this thing

[06:27] You've got a community full of fans and collectors who are really scratching their heads

[06:31] Trying to be like CSI investigators finding out what is causing this

[06:36] And you have guys literally like, I'm gonna take the glass off my play field

[06:40] I'm gonna let the game sit for a month before I play it

[06:42] How stupid is that?

[06:44] The fact that we've come to this point in this hobby

[06:48] Where you have grown men spending $8,000 on a toy

[06:53] And they have to take the glass off it and not play it for a month

[06:56] With their fingers crossed that the inserts won't ghost

[06:59] I mean that has for me defined where we're at this summer in the hobby

[07:04] It's like car human coming, it's like buying a car

[07:07] I'm not gonna drive it for the first month so I hope it has no problems

[07:10] I mean come on

[07:11] And from what we've heard from many people out there

[07:14] That the ghosted inserts stuff, you might get a game and it's perfect

[07:18] Perfect, perfect, perfect, then two weeks later your game's got ghosted inserts

[07:22] So there's nothing you can do

[07:24] It's a ticking time bomb

[07:26] It reminds me of the red ring of death with Xbox

[07:29] Everyone who's got a ghostbusters, Ellie right now

[07:32] Whether they have ghosted inserts or not is worried they're gonna get them

[07:36] And so my issue with Stern is this, what the F are you doing Stern

[07:41] Sending the games out knowing that this issue is occurring

[07:44] And how can you send out the LEs, the most expensive version of the machine

[07:50] That will ever be made with the issue

[07:53] And clearly, clearly, you know there's an issue

[07:58] And so what irks me about Stern and this is where I wish someone from them would just come on the show

[08:04] Maybe talk about it and I'm gonna ask my people over there that I know how can they do this stuff

[08:10] So the first sign that I was like what, that just seems really unprofessional

[08:14] When reinforcement was spelled incorrectly on the play field

[08:20] And when someone brought that through their attention they said hey those are prototype

[08:24] Those are not going out to customers, there's still more time for us to make some changes

[08:27] And then what happened, they shipped play fields with spelling mistakes to customers

[08:33] I mean how can you do that?

[08:35] How can you do that? How can you have you made the mistake

[08:39] And you're gonna pass your mistake onto the customer and make them have a play field

[08:44] On this super expensive item that they have to now live with and it was your mistake

[08:49] That to me, unbelievable, no excuse whatsoever

[08:55] To me that's even more like egregious than the ghosted insert issue

[08:58] Because at the end of the day I don't even know if they know what's causing a ghosting insert issue

[09:03] But a spelling mistake, that's easy to correct

[09:07] And you should have put all the ones that had mistakes aside and not sent them to customers

[09:13] So look, so we have the ghosted insert issue and we've got guys like KPG

[09:19] He's on the forum, he's super excited to get his LE

[09:22] We've got Jeff from the Pimbal podcast, got his

[09:25] All these guys are so excited and I've never seen people so excited to get LE's

[09:29] And then that excitement went from joy to pain when they look down one day and there's just ghosted inserts

[09:36] And then, so what can Stern do?

[09:39] Let's tackle it from this issue

[09:41] What are Stern's options here with ghosted insert play fields?

[09:45] Okay, so option A is that they can do nothing

[09:49] Which, I mean, that's not a viable option

[09:52] Option B is that they can send people who have the issue a play field, a new play field

[10:00] Right, not populated, a new play field that's been clear coded

[10:04] And hopefully they've figured out the problem by the time they make those new play fields

[10:09] The third option is they can send people fully populated play fields

[10:14] And that sounds cheap, right?

[10:16] Fully populated play fields

[10:19] And look, I think the only things Stern can do, where I would accept as a customer, is a fully populated play field

[10:27] How can you expect people to make a do a play field swap?

[10:32] I mean, come on, this is not a simple thing here swapping a play field and 98% of ghost buster LE owners don't have the skill necessary to swap out the play fields

[10:45] So I don't think that's a fix, which leads me to be even more confused why Stern wouldn't hit freeze on the assembly line and fix the problem

[10:56] If they were to come out, and this is the other issue, is like, where's the communication?

[11:01] Where's the communication?

[11:04] Come out and tell your customers what you're doing that you even are aware of the issue, talk to your distributors

[11:13] Alright, let's talk about the customer experience through this whole thing, how horrendous it's been

[11:19] I mean, if you have an issue, and Stern's whole model is, you buy from a distributor, and if you have a problem with the Stern Pimbal machine, you go to your distributor and your distributor is in contact with Stern and knows what the fix is going to be or has some communication from the company

[11:37] But here's what's been happening

[11:39] It's so inconsistent, some of the customers are going to their distributors and their distributors are telling the customers to contact Stern and Stern tells that customer to contact the distributor

[11:50] Or some customers will contact their distributor and distributors like, I haven't heard anything from Stern

[11:56] When the issue happens, Stern needs to have a blanket, sort of all encompassing response that goes out to every distributor

[12:07] You can't have like, oh, Trent knows something, but this distributor doesn't know something, and then you have this, all of this is just, then everything is just like, everyone speculating what's the fix going to be

[12:18] You know, even I saw a KPG, he's been so vocal on Pinside and so angry that someone from Stern contacted him and told him something about what they might be doing or sort of, you know, brought him into the, the sob a little bit

[12:34] I don't even like that, Stern, you can't do that, you can't just go one to one with your customers and make some people feel like they're going to get help but others are in the dark because their distributors are not getting back to them

[12:45] You need to tell all your distributors at the same time, we are aware that there is a ghosted insert issue

[12:54] Okay, we are working on a fix and something that will make everyone who has this issue happy when we figure what that is, we will communicate it out to everyone at the same time

[13:05] And then they'd be done, people would just be able to just play their pens knowing that a fix is coming

[13:11] But look, I think Stern is screwed here, I really do, I don't think there's going to be a cheap fix

[13:17] I don't think they're going to be able to send people populated playfield, I think that's going to be too expensive

[13:23] And I think they're in a pickle here, and I think the corner they're in is when they put themselves in because I think they should have hit stop on the assembly line and communicated to people, look, these games are going to be delayed

[13:35] And here's the reason why, we want you to get your ghost busters in perfect condition

[13:41] And we've noticed that some of the playfields have ghosted inserts, and those inserts should not be ghosting, especially on brand new machines so quickly

[13:50] And so we're going to hit pause and figure out what the problem is, this is going to create a delay, but we know that you want your machine perfect when you get it, and we hope you're patient with us

[14:02] If they had said that, everyone would be fine, the problem is they can't do that right, because their business needs to keep the assembly line going

[14:10] So they're basically, they continue to ship out machines that have issues to consumers, and I see guys like Iceman with their fingers crossed, hoping they don't get one

[14:19] But I just saw that one went out with a date of August 1st, August 1st, and it has ghosted inserts

[14:29] So the only thing I can imagine is that Stern has already preprinted all these playfields, they have not solved the problem, and people are going to get ghost buster LEDs, all of them are going to have a potential ghosted insert problem

[14:45] And people who have premiums are going to be just as anxious, and I really think the whole thing is a big problem for Stern

[14:54] And I don't think people should brush it under the carpet, I don't think people should accept the machine that isn't up to the standards of these new prices, because let's be honest, for $8,000, Stern is now saying that they're a high quality machine of the highest quality

[15:09] Because this is the price point that like JJP is at, and I don't even think you can compare JJP quality to Stern, and I think JJP charges that premium, but you get premium quality on this stuff

[15:24] I don't hear people complaining about ghosted inserts on the hobbit at all, I don't hear people complaining about ghosted inserts on the big Lebowski

[15:32] Once you enter that price range, I'm going to do a cargument again, if you're selling Mercedes Benzes, I expect the quality to be of a higher standard, I expect that door to have a nice like thunk sound, I close it, I expect the materials to be of higher quality

[15:47] If Stern can't get pinball machines to be of an $8,000 caliber, they should not be charging $8,000, but the onus is on the customer, the consumer to say no, to don't give Stern your money

[16:02] And that is what I'm saying a lot of people saying they're going to do, which is they're going to cancel their orders, and I applaud those people

[16:08] Because I think that's the only thing that's going to get Stern to halt the assembly line is that people actually say I'm not giving you my money

[16:14] But if the machine sells out in a day or two, and people haven't played it, and people haven't seen any issues, then Stern's never going to learn a lesson

[16:22] And I don't want Stern to have to learn these lessons, I think Stern knows how to make a good machine, it's confusing because I've elured the rings from 2008

[16:34] That doesn't have any ghost that didn't serve issues, so what happened? How are we now having like spider-man VEs have tons of issues and Game of Thrones and Ghostbusters, so the quality is getting worse

[16:46] And I think that's a big issue, and when I hear George Gomez get up there, and I love George Gomez, and I know they care, and I know they're passionate about it, and I know this hurts them

[16:57] So I think we also have to have some empathy for Stern, like something's wrong, and I don't think they're not doing anything about it

[17:05] But when Gomez gets up there and says, look, we know the new pinball buyer is a collector, and that collector expects things to be different than what an operator would accept

[17:17] And because of that, we have to be more careful, we have to have better quality, we have to have better communication with the buyer

[17:25] I hear that, and I want to believe that, but Mr. Gomez, you can't keep shipping people machines when there's a known issue

[17:36] You can't do that, you can't ship people machines with spelling mistakes on it, you can't ship people machines when the slimer mechanism is not right, and you know you have a fix in the work, but you're just still going to ship out a few that have the old mechanism, and then those people are kind of screwed

[17:53] You can't do that Mr. Gomez, you got to make sure that the quality is there before you put it in a customer sense, because quality is everything

[18:02] Let's be honest, it's getting to the point now, where you can almost go buy something else

[18:10] We're not quite there yet, so say like I bail out on Ghostbusters, what am I going to go buy tomorrow that I can get immediately?

[18:16] A hobby? Yeah, I think they're still making the ones that are previously ordered, the Big Lebowski will talk about that later on, but 20 of them on a ship after like six months or whatever, that's just slowly trickling out

[18:29] There's no rob zombies to be had unless you want to buy second hand one, you know, there's still not that competitor that if Stern's dropping the ball, someone else can come in

[18:39] But you know, that's what I want to say, is that Stern needs to hit freeze? They're going to have, they're going to have, I don't know what they're going to do

[18:47] I don't know what they're going to do, and I think this is really going to be a narrative that is dragged out into the fall

[18:56] I really do, I think people are going to demand new populated playfields for their 8000R Ghostbusters L.E.'s, I think premium buyers are not going to accept anything other than a perfect playfield

[19:10] And I think every ghosted insert that occurs now is going to be blown out of proportion and people are going to demand something perfect

[19:18] And if I've learned anything in my two months away, is that Pimble isn't perfect, Pimble machines aren't devices that can be made perfect or remain perfect very long

[19:29] But the thing about the playfield is this, and this is the last point I'm going to make, is the playfield is the foundation of every game

[19:36] And the playfield is what the game sits on top of, the playfield is what we look at when we look at the quality of a machine

[19:44] We look to see the playfield where, we look at the shooter lanes, we look at the inserts, we look to see if there's any chipping, we look to see if there's any dimples or scratch marks

[19:54] Or if there's any where around any of the different scoops and holes and whatnot

[20:00] And the foundation of the machine is the most important thing

[20:04] Because you can always change what's on top, you can always change a mechanism out, you can always change a railing out, you can always change other elements of the game that are on top of the playfield

[20:14] But changing out the playfield is the biggest pain in the ass and it's the foundation of the game

[20:19] So would you go buy a house that had a broken foundation?

[20:22] Absolutely not, you would run in the other direction

[20:25] So for Stern to have the foundation of these machines with problems, I think it's a huge issue for them

[20:35] If everything they're building these new games on is a ticking time bomb, this could blow up their business in the short term unless they get a fix

[20:45] And I don't know what they're doing, but if I'm Stern, I'm calling up the guys that are making the big Lebowski playfields, the Hobbit playfields, and I'm throwing all sorts of money at them

[20:55] Maybe buy that company, acquire them, you're the biggest pinball manufacturer in the world and you can't get your playfields right

[21:01] Shame on you Stern for shipping those machines out, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt as well the rest of the community if you make the fix that people need

[21:09] And you give us the solution that people need, but the fact that you continue to ship out Ghostbusters LEDs with issues without hitting pause I think is reason for concern

[21:19] So that's what I want to say about Ghostbusters and this summer and Stern, the balls in your court to make it right

[21:26] But so far I think you've given people very little confidence in your ability to control the quality of the product this summer

[21:34] And it's just that's it, that's it, that's what we're going to say about Ghostbusters

[21:38] There's only one reason why I wish I was still a legitimate member of Pinside

[21:45] It's so that every time why Snow, also known as Hilton, makes a post, I could simply respond with this

[21:55] First, take a big step back and literally fuck your own face

[22:00] I mean this guy continues to win the ass clown of the year award every day with every post

[22:07] So his latest is, and this made me laugh, is that he's selling his new inbox never opened, America's most honoured for the suggested hassle-free price of $8,200

[22:21] And the reason why he's selling his new inbox America's most honoured is because he wants to get a new car

[22:28] So I love Hilton's for sale threads because they're always the most inconsistent bunch of mumbo jumbo

[22:34] And he's always got some story that he's telling on why he's selling the pen first, I thought he already opened his pen

[22:38] I thought he was selling it a while back, people gave him a bunch of grief and he said I'm just going to keep it, it's great

[22:43] I'll never get one again, but here he is, it's still new inbox

[22:46] And just in time to avoid your ghosted insert problem with ghost busters, Hilton comes to the rescue

[22:52] I love how he always cooks up this crazy narrative whenever he's selling something

[22:56] And just paraphrasing what he said, he's like look, I'm also selling some of my other collectibles and if those sell first, I'm going to yank this ad

[23:04] So you better buy it now before that happens

[23:07] What is Hilton's other collectibles he has on the market?

[23:11] He always got some rare rubber ducky collection that he's also selling at the same time

[23:15] I mean come on man, just put your pen up for sale, you always have to make something bigger than it is

[23:19] And I know I never believe this guy, he was what I can't figure out about Hilton

[23:22] And I've been scratching my head about this guy for a while now

[23:25] Are you rich? Do you have a lot of money or do you need to sell a pinball machine to get a car?

[23:32] And I'm seriously asking this question because I think this guy is like an enigma

[23:36] Because in some threads he's like hey guys, I want to build a house with a bunker underneath it that holds 150 pinball machines

[23:45] What are your thoughts on that and how can I do it?

[23:49] Okay, so that sounds like the question of a really rich guy

[23:53] I don't know anyone out there that has, is building bunkers to hold 150 pinball machines that doesn't have a lot of money

[24:02] The other guy I know that has like 150 machines, a roto Dave over there in Australia

[24:09] New Zealand, which one is it? I probably forget

[24:12] But I clearly, the guys had a successful career in business and has a house filled with machines and more power to them

[24:20] God bless them, right? But Hilton, what is it man? Do you have a lot of money or you just get them by and need to sell a pinball machine to buy a car?

[24:29] I just can't figure the guy out, like he really is like the ultimate enigma

[24:32] But I love these stories about that he only says to cook up

[24:36] But here's the thing I'll say, if you buy an America's most haunted for $8,200, I think that's a joke

[24:42] I think this, I think spooky games aren't worth it, I know I know there's so limited

[24:49] There's only 150 America's most haunted out there

[24:52] But once you open up the box, come on, you're losing two grand right away on that

[24:57] Right away, and here's the thing I'll say about spooky, and I think this company has been applauded for shipping games

[25:05] And this is my observation though of spooky over the summer

[25:08] Look at all the Rob zombies that are going up for sale

[25:11] And this is one of the items on my list that things are talking about

[25:14] But the Rob Zombie flipping is exactly what I knew would happen

[25:20] It's exactly why Ben Heck said they should have priced the game higher

[25:24] Spooky is leaving all that money on the table when people buy it secondhand for $8,000, $9,000

[25:30] And I don't think they're worth it, I really don't

[25:35] The fact that when I look at my tales of the Arabian Knights, I paid $8,000 for it

[25:42] Are you really kidding me? That machine is gorgeous compared to an America's most haunted or Rob Zombie

[25:50] The rarity of spooky, I think that novelty is going to wear thin soon

[25:55] And I really do, I really do

[25:58] I think that with the amount of Rob zombies that are on the market right now

[26:01] And they're not moving, they're not moving at these prices

[26:04] I think the luster and the sort of the love affair with these limited machines

[26:09] They're starting to wear thin because I just think people are looking at them

[26:12] Finally, as they should have always looked at them

[26:15] And they're looking at the machines on their own merits and not like these limited run things

[26:20] And I think spooky is in a little bit of...

[26:24] It's going to find themselves in an interesting position because their whole stick is that they make these limited petite games

[26:31] And I think if they were to make any of these pinball machines mass produced without a limited number, would they sell?

[26:39] I don't know, I really don't know, I don't think so

[26:42] They don't sell out, they wouldn't sell 300 immediately of Rob Zombie

[26:47] If he's like, we're going to make as many as we can build

[26:50] I think people are chasing the scarcity

[26:53] I think in the past it's proven like a good bet

[26:56] In the pinball collecting community, if you buy a machine, there's only 150 of them

[27:00] There's only 300 of them, that's it, that's all they're ever going to make

[27:03] I think there's a good chance you're not going to lose money in that investment

[27:06] I do, I think Rob Zombie will probably settle around

[27:10] Initially the L-les will probably go for around like $8,000 maybe, $7,500

[27:17] But you'll be able to find used ones for MSRP in a year

[27:23] I really do, once more these games start shipping and they're in the hands of people

[27:27] I really don't think people are going to be like clamoring to get one

[27:30] Because again, the games, I don't think people are going to look at the games and say this game's amazing

[27:35] If they had a limited game that was also amazing

[27:38] I mean imagine if someone said to me once, imagine if Ghostbusters only had 300 examples of it

[27:42] How much would they be worth?

[27:44] And we're like, oh shit

[27:46] Like you could probably charge like 50 grand each if there were only 300 Ghostbusters Pimball machines in the entire world

[27:52] But luckily there will be thousands of Ghostbusters

[27:55] Okay, so I want to keep this first part of Canadian Pimball Podcast Return

[28:00] We'll call it episode 42, a little bit short

[28:03] I think of you guys just a little bit of an update on what I've been doing with my machines

[28:10] And where I'm at

[28:12] So some exciting stuff

[28:14] So let me just go down the list

[28:16] So I'm looking over my living room and I see my tails of the Arabian Knights

[28:20] And it is finally working 100%

[28:24] It all the brass parts that Mike Chestnut did before he passed away have been returned

[28:31] They're in the game, they look amazing

[28:34] I just replaced the Genie

[28:37] I will say this though, my tails of the Arabian Knights has not been without issue

[28:43] And one day I was playing it

[28:46] I was playing all right

[28:48] And then I did something, you know like all people

[28:51] I replaced the subway assembly underneath the game

[28:55] And I don't know when I did that, maybe I jiggled a wire somewhere

[28:58] And all of a sudden the shooting star stopped working

[29:03] All of a sudden a few lights were out

[29:06] And so it seemed like everything that was malfunctioning was along the same sort of board

[29:13] And again I'm going to use language like I'm probably going to be incorrect on some of it

[29:19] So anyway, so long story short

[29:21] Something electrical was wrong with the machine

[29:23] And I just didn't have a clue where to even begin finding the issue

[29:29] And so I found this really amazing gentleman

[29:32] His name is Mike, he is from Long Island, he's Pimbalber Paraguy

[29:38] And he's an awesome guy, awesome guy, came by, drove in, spent all day here testing out the game, figuring out what was wrong, diagnosing the problem

[29:47] Ultimately he came to the conclusion that

[29:50] There was just something coming from the PCB into the game

[29:54] And one of the signals was sort of like a radic

[29:57] And he's like look, I could either go through all of the wiring here and figure out which one is the issue

[30:05] Which is kind of like finding a needle in a haystack

[30:07] Or it could simply bypass the problem and run one wire from here to here

[30:13] And it'll work perfectly

[30:15] And I was like let's just, it's like creating a short gun

[30:17] Like let's just do that, you know some people might say that it's a hack, it's not

[30:21] It works now, he did it and it works perfectly

[30:24] And I'm happy

[30:26] And he said something to me, he's like look Chris the reality is this

[30:29] Just when your game is working, when your game is working and everything is functioning

[30:33] Just as much as you can don't lift the play field

[30:37] And I learned like in these 20 year old games like you're gonna have issues

[30:40] And I've still been having other issues on some of the connectors and the lights have been malfunctioning

[30:45] I think some of the pins need to be resoldered on some of the light boards

[30:49] But that's the price of owning a 20 year old machine that wasn't babyed

[30:55] Alright, this thing has a new CPR play field that the top of the machine looks absolutely gorgeous

[31:00] But underneath it things need some work

[31:02] But I'm happy to say as of today August 8th, Tails of the Ruby Knights is working perfectly

[31:09] And she is in the living room

[31:11] And the other machines that I am an ownership of are Ghostbusters Ellie and my Lord of the Rings Ellie

[31:18] So what did I do with these?

[31:20] So this summer, you know I've been talking a lot with Brenda and we've been just sort of discussing

[31:25] You know what do we do with these machines?

[31:27] Like what do we, what kind of pinball collectors do we want to be?

[31:31] And I came to the conclusion that I don't want to be one of these people that always has games and storage

[31:38] Always has like a few machines in another location

[31:42] And I just want to play a machine, enjoy it, and then move on to the next

[31:47] That's sort of like the way I want to collect pinball machines

[31:51] I don't want to hoard them, I don't want to have $100,000 invested in pinball machines

[32:00] I just don't want to be one of those people

[32:03] And I know that's hard, right?

[32:06] Because for some of you guys out there that have huge collections and huge space, like more power to you

[32:11] I'm not saying, I mean if I had a big game room, I'd probably fill it, right?

[32:15] And I'm just living within my reality

[32:18] And so that being said, I had Lord of the Rings Ellie at Eddie Kramer's house

[32:24] He's been holding on to me for a few months

[32:27] And I love Lord of the Rings

[32:29] I mean that was my first machine, I pented out, it had all these awesome mods, a beautiful machine

[32:34] But I just came to the conclusion that I just wasn't going to have room for it anytime soon

[32:40] And so I just wanted to sell it, I did enjoy it for two years

[32:43] I will say this, the long ball time's got annoying and I just didn't want it anymore

[32:50] And so I put it on eBay for sale

[32:53] And I put it up for sale for I think $8,000 initially, then I lowered to $7,500

[33:00] And something amazing happened

[33:03] And this is like one of those, just...

[33:06] It's kind of like a miracle way to get rid of a game

[33:10] So the first person, I get an email from a person who's local New Jersey

[33:15] And he's like, I'll give you $6,500 cash for it

[33:17] And I'm like, nah, it's not as much as I'm looking for

[33:20] I think the lowest I would take on it is $6,800

[33:23] Now given I'd spent $7,000 on it a couple years ago, but I played it a lot

[33:28] I had a lot of wear and you know, some wear and tear on it

[33:30] But I put a color DMD, I put about $1,000 for the mods, I would say

[33:34] Oh you know, everything from mirror blades, figures, to gam off of lighted staff, to pimbol refineries, path of the dead mod

[33:41] The thing was modded out, like everything was on it

[33:43] So this guy and I were going to make a deal

[33:47] And he was going to come drive up to Eddie's house, and with cash, and...

[33:52] And I still just felt like I was getting a little bit less

[33:54] But I still had it on eBay

[33:56] And then all of a sudden I get an email from someone who's like, you know, I really want the machine

[34:01] And then he buys it now

[34:03] He just bought it now on eBay for $7,500

[34:06] And I was like, oh awesome, like I'm getting $500 more than I bought it for

[34:10] But then I look at the eBay fees and the PayPal fees

[34:14] And shit, I was like, it was like $900 between PayPal and eBay and fees

[34:20] So I'm like screw that, and I email the guy, I'm like, look, I'm...

[34:25] I can't pay these fees, you know, can you do cash or your local, and he was local

[34:29] But here's where the story becomes amazing

[34:33] He said, Chris, my name is Peter, and I own Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn

[34:40] And I've been really wanting a nice Lord of the Rings for a while, and I saw yours

[34:44] And that's when I was like, are you effing kidding me?

[34:48] I can sell my Lord of the Rings machine, have it go into Sunshine Laundromat, which is where I go all the time to play games

[34:56] That is like the best of both worlds, I can sell my machine, and I can go play it whenever I want

[35:03] And I was like, oh my god

[35:07] Yes, like, I'll happily sell to you

[35:10] So we, we inked out a deal around $7,500 for the machine cash, and he showed up to Eddie's house

[35:16] And we spent a day hanging out, and he picked up the machine, and that's where it is now

[35:21] My Lord of the Rings, Ellie, is at Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn

[35:26] And when you play it, know that you're playing Canadian's machine

[35:30] And it's just, I just couldn't think of a better scenario to have my machine end up somewhere where I can go play

[35:36] A little bit sad that it's going to get beat on, because it's such a nice machine, being in the wild

[35:44] But Sunshine takes really good care of their games, and it's a dollar play, so people are not just playing on it

[35:51] Over and over and over, like a free play situation

[35:54] So that's where my Lord of the Rings, Ellie is now on to Ghostbusters, Ellie, what am I doing with Ghostbusters, Ellie?

[36:01] And I gotta be honest here, I have a buyer lined up for $9,500, he's still, wants it, I've been checking in with him

[36:09] He's like, Chris, when it's ready to ship, I'll pay you, and we'll do the deal

[36:13] I am having the hardest time letting go of Ghostbusters, Ellie, I still feel like this is the machine that I want

[36:21] And again, this is just the zombie Eddie effect, the theme effect

[36:25] I just feel like it's one of these special machines that if I let go of it, even at $9,500, and I want one one day

[36:33] I still feel like I'm going to be paying that and not getting a new one

[36:37] But the Ghosts and Insert issues, everything I've been talking about with the problems, that's the dilemma

[36:43] If these things were shipping and they were perfect and people were loving them, I'd probably keep it

[36:48] And then my plan of attack would be this, I'd put Ghostbusters, Ellie, in my living room, and I'd have Eddie pick up my tails of the Ramyon Knights

[36:57] and just shop it, just restore it, go through the whole thing underneath and make everything new again, and that's what I would do

[37:06] I just really, really, really love tails of the Ramyon Knights

[37:10] And before I let you guys go, I just want to explain you why I love toad in so much

[37:15] It's a game that is very simple, but it has so many magical shots, and it's so easy for me to explain to people when they come over what to do

[37:24] And when you watch people play tails in the Ramyon Knights, it's an enjoyable experience

[37:31] The ball times are not ultra long because the game can be brutal and unfair at times with the lamp spinning

[37:37] It can just send stuff straight down the middle

[37:40] But for me, most of the people come over and play our newbies

[37:45] And when I tell them, look, just shoot the genie or shoot the lamp

[37:49] If these get lit up, which you shoot here and here, you shoot stars, or pop up

[37:54] And here's the goal, you want to collect all the jewels and that'll lead to battling the genie to free the princess

[37:59] It's like, I love games that have a simplicity to what needs to happen

[38:04] I can't imagine someone new coming over and like jumping on a hobbit or jumping on ACDC

[38:10] And like, here's what you got to do, it's just you just lose them

[38:13] And that's my reality too, it's not just my space situation

[38:17] But I want a game that is immediately enticing to people who aren't just diehard pinball fans

[38:24] And even if you are a diehard pinball fan, I think tells the Ramyon Knights is a super fun game to play

[38:31] I do, and when you see mine, and any of you guys who ever come through New York City, you're invited to come over to Canada's Arcade

[38:38] When you see one that's restored and has all beautiful brass, it's just one of the most amazing playfuls

[38:45] The quality on it is still so much better than modern pinball machines

[38:52] It's just something about that error

[38:54] So that's what I'm doing, I will make my decision on Ghostbusters

[38:58] I can't believe I'm still like undecided on it in August

[39:02] And I can't believe it's August 8th and my machine isn't even ready for shipping yet

[39:08] My buyer has been on the hook since May

[39:12] So that is episode 42 of Canada's pinball podcast

[39:17] I want to thank you guys again for enticing me to come back

[39:22] We're going to do this, we always have done it, we're going to be honest

[39:26] We're not going to be too long or too long-winded

[39:29] And we're going to have some interviews like we always do

[39:33] I'll say that some people like the black knight, I wanted him to come back on

[39:37] And now he went on pinside and said all this mean stuff about me for some reason

[39:41] Not sure why, didn't do anything to the guy personally

[39:43] But that's his progative, the door is always open for him to come back on

[39:47] We'll definitely have other people on

[39:49] And if you're a guest of this show and you're having Ghostbusters issues

[39:51] I want to talk to you

[39:53] If you just want to talk about collecting and your experience with the hobby, let's talk

[39:58] Let's open to our policy

[40:00] This isn't a podcast where you can hear the same guys just go back and forth for hour and a half, two hours

[40:07] Like slowly talking about the hobby

[40:09] This has always been a place where you're going to get it in less than an hour

[40:13] Alright, so next episode, we're going to cover off from everything else

[40:16] I know there's so much more that I want to talk about when it comes to medieval man's colorization

[40:20] The big Lebowski's on a ship

[40:23] Alien is going to be available by Christmas if you believe that

[40:27] What else is going on in the hobbit?

[40:29] All these things are still, you know, there's still lots to talk about

[40:32] So we're going to address all that on the next episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[40:37] Yes, and I'll even address

[40:39] I'll reveal to the world all of my duplicate pinside accounts

[40:46] Not really, I've got like 50, you'll never catch me Robin

[40:50] Alright guys, that's it, the bitch is back

[41:15] You
