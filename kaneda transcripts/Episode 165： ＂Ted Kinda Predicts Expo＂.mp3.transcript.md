[00:00] Well I want back down, no I want back down.

[00:08] You can stand me up at the gates of hell but I want back down.

[00:22] Welcome to episode 165 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:27] On this episode we're going to switch gears a little bit.

[00:29] We're going to talk a little bit about the previous drama that we brought up in Pimball.

[00:34] But I have Ted as a guest and Ted is probably the greatest guest ever to give his Pimball

[00:42] Expo predictions.

[00:44] Partly because Ted had a few to kill as in him partly because I don't even think Ted

[00:48] knows what Pimball Expo is.

[00:50] So it's going to be a pretty interesting show.

[00:53] I think you're going to enjoy it.

[00:55] The other part I'll say is this.

[00:57] Before we air the interview because we talk about some of the news items we talk about

[01:00] Expo and then you know Ted and me we just sort of go in a million different directions.

[01:04] I'll just say this about the ultimate and the latest news item that's going through the

[01:08] Pimball world.

[01:10] I'll put it in this context.

[01:13] If you ever don't want to get laid or you ever want to clear out a bar or stop a group

[01:20] of people from conversing simply do this.

[01:23] Say to the people, to the woman, to the man, to the group of friends around you say,

[01:28] do you know that attack from Mars remake and medieval madness remake?

[01:32] The flipper buttons are reacting with a 0.5 millisecond delay.

[01:37] Did you know that?

[01:38] And because of that it makes hitting your shots so much harder.

[01:43] I mean this whole thing and I've listened to head to head pinball.

[01:47] I've listened to people talk about this.

[01:49] The fact that that delay is so minuscule there is no way.

[01:55] There is no way it is changing the way you play the game.

[01:58] The factors of new play field, different clear coat thickness that has way more to do

[02:04] with changing the way the game feels and plays and this lag that is so tiny.

[02:11] Now the thing is I get it.

[02:12] It's like variable lag.

[02:14] You don't know.

[02:15] You can't compensate for it.

[02:18] But I mean really there's always been a civil war of people who support remakes, people

[02:24] who think the originals are better.

[02:25] Now there's some scientific data that shows one thing.

[02:29] There's a little bit of a difference.

[02:30] There is.

[02:31] But for people saying they can't hit the center saucer on attack from Mars now but they

[02:37] could on the original.

[02:38] It's it's bogus.

[02:41] It's bogus.

[02:42] And like I've heard from a lot of my players or friends who are really good players saying

[02:45] that it's a big deal.

[02:47] Chris it's a big deal.

[02:48] They have to fix this.

[02:49] This is a big deal.

[02:50] All right.

[02:51] Fine.

[02:52] I don't think 99.9% of people who buy these machines care.

[02:55] I really don't.

[02:57] But with that being said, we talk about this Ted and I.

[02:59] I don't even think Ted could understand what I was talking about.

[03:03] But let me air the interview of Ted and Chris kind of giving their Pimbal Expo predictions.

[03:10] I hope you enjoy it.

[03:11] I'm going to Europe.

[03:14] And I won't be back until October 15thish which is going to be after Expo.

[03:20] I don't plan on doing podcasts while I'm gone.

[03:24] So I think you should listen to some of the other Pimbal podcasts that are out there.

[03:28] I need the break.

[03:29] You probably need the break from me.

[03:30] You think I you know for those of you out there who think I'm just a shitster and I'm

[03:34] doing all these negative things to the hobby.

[03:36] I'm dragging the hobby down the hobby down the Pimbal Hockey.

[03:41] I here's your chance.

[03:43] How you have over 10 days of your Pimbal hobby being able to grow without the negative influence

[03:49] of me.

[03:50] So let's see if like thousands of people start to join up now.

[03:54] All right.

[03:55] Enjoy it.

[03:56] Have a great 10 days everyone and I'll talk to you soon.

[03:58] All right.

[03:59] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[04:02] I think a much needed guest because this guy brings the positive vibes like nobody else

[04:08] and he's had a few dekeelism to them tonight.

[04:10] Ted, welcome back to the show.

[04:12] Ted, maybe to Keele's.

[04:14] All right.

[04:15] Well, I was telling Ted I'm like, let's do a Pimbal Expo prediction show and he goes,

[04:21] what's Pimbal Expo?

[04:22] And he said, he said, I've been to one show Chris.

[04:27] I said, you're more than qualified to then give your predictions on Expo because you've

[04:31] been to one Pimbal show.

[04:32] You're almost been to them all.

[04:34] So we're going to run down what we think is going to happen at that show.

[04:37] Has that sound?

[04:38] On town, that's as much driving as I could take.

[04:42] I almost went to the York show.

[04:44] Are you ready for this?

[04:45] I went out to Frederick, Maryland to buy a scared stiff Pimbal machine and on the way back,

[04:53] all of a sudden I realized, whoa, I'd be passing by York.

[04:58] So I called up and I said, hey, how late are you guys open?

[05:03] I want to stop by.

[05:05] And they said, this was Saturday.

[05:08] They said we're only open until six o'clock with four o'clock.

[05:13] Everybody breaks down.

[05:14] I was an hour and 15 minutes away and I was calling them at around three o'clock.

[05:19] So it didn't make sense to go there, but it was a shame.

[05:23] I almost got to go to York.

[05:25] So Saturday it closed pretty early then.

[05:27] Normally, like these shows go a little bit later, but I guess the shows that are like commuter

[05:31] crowds, they don't really go late, like the ones that are in hotels.

[05:36] Right.

[05:37] Yeah, he said they start breaking down around four o'clock until six, but they stopped

[05:41] selling tickets at four.

[05:43] So if I got there, a lot of people might have been gone.

[05:46] So I didn't want to even go slightly out of my way to try to do that.

[05:50] So I said, hell with it.

[05:51] Well, let's recap.

[05:52] What do you have in your home right now?

[05:53] Because then we'll get to.

[05:54] I you've been chasing the scared stiff forever.

[05:56] I mean, I feel like the day you get it, like every other Pimbal machine out there,

[05:59] just going to explode.

[06:00] But what happened was I sold everything.

[06:02] A guy came by and bought everything because he offered me so much more money than I

[06:06] paid for this stuff.

[06:07] I sold it all because I couldn't turn down the money.

[06:10] Right.

[06:11] And only my scared stiff guy was offering me big money for the scared stiff I had, which

[06:15] was a scared stiff that was owned by someone that worked at Jersey Jack.

[06:19] And a friend of mine said he knew a guy that had a home use only machine that was phenomenal.

[06:25] It was like mint condition.

[06:26] I said, I want this as soon as I found that I could get that, I sold my other machine

[06:30] for the big bucks.

[06:32] The other this guy backed out.

[06:34] Now I had nothing.

[06:35] So when I found out this machine in Frederick, I drove out there to get that this weekend.

[06:41] And I finally got it.

[06:42] No fade on the cab.

[06:44] It's really nice shape.

[06:45] So I'm happy.

[06:46] So I'm back into having a scared stiff again.

[06:49] But I got to put in the under cab lights and I got to put in some of the stuff.

[06:54] It has the skull pile.

[06:55] It has the candles.

[06:57] It has the dancing boogies.

[06:58] And people probably don't care about this stuff.

[07:01] Let's talk about the horrifying stuff that's.

[07:03] Yes.

[07:04] I got my scared stiff up right there.

[07:07] That's good.

[07:08] Yeah.

[07:09] So let's go.

[07:10] Let's do a little rundown.

[07:11] There's a lot's happened in the pinball world since we last spoke.

[07:14] And I just want to get your thoughts on some of like the recent developments.

[07:16] Let's start out on a scale of one to ten.

[07:21] What do you think the chances or the odds are that deep root will successfully unravel

[07:28] the mystery of magic girl and make that pinball machine?

[07:30] Oh, Jesus.

[07:32] You know something?

[07:35] It's so hard to even comment about this because a, I have no skin in the game.

[07:41] I'm one of those people.

[07:42] When I heard what people were paying in advance for this game, I just laughed and said, oh,

[07:45] my God, you've got to be either incredibly rich or incredibly stupid or incredibly

[07:50] both.

[07:51] But anyway, I was no way getting involved in that.

[07:55] So watching this unfold, all I'm saying is, hey, look, I don't really give a shit

[08:00] about any of this stuff.

[08:02] All I'm saying is that there's any company out there that even has a possibility of getting

[08:07] these people, the machines that they paid, you get money for, I'm all for it.

[08:12] I know nothing about the company.

[08:14] I know nothing about their finances.

[08:15] I heard they have big pockets.

[08:18] But if they could do something for the people that put money into this machine, I'd be thrilled

[08:23] to see it happen.

[08:24] Will it happen?

[08:25] Who knows if it does, I'd be thrilled if not.

[08:28] It's just going to be another chapter.

[08:29] Yeah, but that's the thing right.

[08:31] Don't you feel like they're just reopening the wound again.

[08:34] Like if they had finished Raza or Magic Girl and just like revealed it when it was done

[08:40] and said, good news guys, you're not screwed.

[08:45] We did it.

[08:46] But the fact that they're announcing this so early, because I heard the latest, they said

[08:52] they're going to go away for two years now and go finish Magic Girl.

[08:56] You know what?

[08:58] Magic by 2020?

[09:00] Anyone?

[09:01] We don't know.

[09:02] This could either be something good or it could just be a total piece of crap.

[09:06] We really don't know.

[09:07] All we can do is wait and see what happens.

[09:12] And you know what?

[09:13] The people have put the money in.

[09:14] That money is gone.

[09:15] So if they get something for it, it's great.

[09:19] If they don't, the money's gone anyway.

[09:21] I'm sure 99% of the people have written this off already and they never expect to see a

[09:26] thing for their money.

[09:27] So if they get anything, it's fantastic.

[09:30] What is Iceman always saying in the form?

[09:32] 100% of nothing is nothing.

[09:34] Right.

[09:35] You might as well wait and see.

[09:37] That's exactly right.

[09:38] So if they could do something for it.

[09:39] Hey, look, who the hell ever thought in a million, if you would have made bets on whether

[09:43] Magic Girl would have ever been made, released and gotten to people that paid for them, nobody

[09:49] would have won that bet in a million years.

[09:52] And still people got to every cheese.

[09:55] Whether they work or not, doesn't matter.

[09:57] The machine was made and people still got them.

[09:59] No one would have believed it.

[10:00] So you know what?

[10:01] Who knows?

[10:02] Maybe, maybe, maybe J.Douche is a magician like we've never seen.

[10:07] Who knows?

[10:08] Yeah.

[10:09] It's going to, you know, look, as someone who has a Magic Girl, I just really hope this

[10:14] saga just ultimately ends one day because it's like this, the never ending story with

[10:20] this guy.

[10:21] And for the guys who've been burned, and there's many more people that have been burned

[10:25] than God, a Magic Girl, I just can't see any company being able to make it.

[10:29] Make those people whole dollar to dollar.

[10:31] It just makes absolutely no financial sense why you would get in bed with a guy that's

[10:35] already like a million and a half in the hole, right?

[10:38] It's like, explain something because you know more about this than I do.

[10:43] They say that they were going to try to ultimately make more Magic Girls as well as the other

[10:49] two machines.

[10:50] Which makes absolutely no sense.

[10:52] Yeah.

[10:53] Because the problem with saying you're going to make more Magic Girls is you, is, what

[10:56] do you think?

[10:57] I mean, what you said, I like it to do that?

[10:59] Yeah.

[11:00] They want to make more Magic Girls.

[11:02] They want to fix the game because only they know how to do it is what they said because

[11:08] they must be magicians.

[11:09] But the problem with that now is you, what about the other 25 people that paid a premium

[11:14] to have a very limited machine?

[11:16] If you make an unlimited amount of them, what are you going to do to those original owners?

[11:21] Are you going to give them a refund because now their machine is no longer rare?

[11:25] I mean, you know what, all this is so cart in head of the horse.

[11:30] It's never going to happen.

[11:31] I don't think these guys are ever going to figure out the game.

[11:33] I'll tell you why because John Papaduch is the designer and he doesn't know how to make

[11:37] it work and he's working with them to make it work.

[11:40] They've tried this three times already.

[11:43] Why would it be different now?

[11:45] Exactly.

[11:46] Exactly.

[11:47] I don't know.

[11:49] But the main thing is, for some reason, John Papaduch always seems to find a way

[11:55] to find people that have money and these people, evidently, this is not a made up thing.

[12:02] This is not a bullshit thing.

[12:03] This is a company that has some real money behind them.

[12:07] So this is not a fabrication.

[12:10] He's convinced people to get into this for whatever reason and however it's going to work

[12:14] out, we don't know yet.

[12:16] But he's done this and it's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.

[12:20] You know what?

[12:21] We're kidding.

[12:22] There's nothing to lose for the people that are into this.

[12:25] They know they're getting nothing if they get something.

[12:28] It's something.

[12:29] Right.

[12:30] My theory on all of this is these rich patrons who keep floating, J-Pop, there's something

[12:35] about very rich men who are into pinball who want to become famous in pinball and they

[12:42] really think there's this great fame and accolades to be had by running a pinball company

[12:49] and I think they quickly realize the same way, double realized it, the same way,

[12:53] pentasia realized it, that it's really hard to build pinball machines, especially one

[13:00] that is already broken to begin with.

[13:03] And I think they're going to realize that they're not going to get the support they think,

[13:06] getting the parts they need, getting this thing together is not going to be fun.

[13:10] And who knows, maybe they have the skin for it but I think it's going to end up the way

[13:14] the other two projects ended up with John.

[13:16] There's no excuse for them.

[13:18] Number one, I cannot believe these people are stupid.

[13:21] Number two, they know the history.

[13:23] So they know the history of pop and do's.

[13:26] They know the history of American pinball.

[13:30] They know all of this stuff and they're still doing it.

[13:33] So then what do they see that no one else could see?

[13:37] They've never made a pinball machine in their lives.

[13:39] Deep roots.

[13:40] Well, that's the question.

[13:42] They've got the money, somehow he convinced them to do this.

[13:45] And if they come out with the machines fine, but like I said, at this point, I'm willing

[13:49] to totally go into hibernation for the two years and see what they do because it doesn't

[13:54] matter.

[13:55] Right.

[13:56] It doesn't matter.

[13:57] If they do it fine, if they don't do it, all right, who gives you shit?

[14:00] It's something else I'm talking about.

[14:02] But at this point, there's nothing, the people have the money in, have nothing to lose.

[14:06] They've lost their money already and they've come to grips with that.

[14:09] So if they possibly could get something back, it's wonderful.

[14:13] All right.

[14:14] Next switch here is a little bit because you might not know this, Ted, but this podcast

[14:19] tonight is being recorded with a 0.5 millisecond delay.

[14:24] Hey, yeah.

[14:26] Have you noticed the difference?

[14:28] No.

[14:29] Okay.

[14:30] Well, it's 0.5 milliseconds.

[14:31] What the hell am I?

[14:32] What am I, Stephen Hawkins?

[14:34] So this is the other big thing being talked about this week in the pinball world.

[14:38] And I know you saw some of this on the pinstack because I'm sure, I'm reading you.

[14:42] I'm your shadow on there, brother.

[14:45] It turns out that the remake games of Attack for Mars remake and Medieval Madness remake

[14:51] are running with a very, very minimal delay, 0.5 milliseconds, which is undetectable to human

[14:59] beings and their reflexes.

[15:01] Do you think that is making people now say this is a huge difference in the remakes and

[15:08] something has to be done?

[15:11] I don't understand the question.

[15:13] There's a 0.5 milliseconds and no one can understand.

[15:16] So when you press the flipper button, right?

[15:19] On an original Medieval Madness or Attack for Mars, there's 0 delay.

[15:24] Okay.

[15:25] If someone has that kind of feeling where they can detect that they should be working

[15:31] for NASA and they shouldn't be playing pinball.

[15:33] But the thread is pretty hilarious when you read it.

[15:36] I read the thread that they wrote.

[15:38] I agree with you.

[15:40] There's something, the thing with the remakes is this.

[15:43] It's not just the delay or the milliseconds.

[15:47] It's also, there's new play fields.

[15:49] There's different clear code.

[15:50] The games are remade in terms of the geometries all the same, but once you add any new variable,

[15:56] of course it might feel a little bit different.

[15:59] But I think for anyone who wants a little bit of comic relief, go read how 0.5 milliseconds

[16:06] is could make or break the value of these remakes games.

[16:11] Oh, let me put this right.

[16:13] I've spoken to at least a dozen people who have bought the remakes, who have had the

[16:18] originals and they said they can't tell the difference at all.

[16:22] That's good enough.

[16:23] That's good enough for me.

[16:24] What's interesting, so the delay is actually a real thing.

[16:28] Like someone hooked up a monitor to the flipper coils and you know, what's interesting about

[16:34] it.

[16:35] It's not a consistent delay there, Ted.

[16:38] It changes.

[16:39] It's like variable delays.

[16:40] So it might be 0.25, then it might go up to 0.5.

[16:44] All of that though.

[16:45] It's all within the relay.

[16:47] Yeah, but it's always in the realm of, are you really saying you didn't hit that ramp

[16:52] because of that?

[16:54] Is that really what happened?

[16:55] Because I think what's been brewing for the longest time too, within the community, when

[17:00] the remakes came out, there has always been a civil war, which is better, right?

[17:06] The original guys are like original serial matching games are the original, like those

[17:11] are worth more than the remakes.

[17:12] And there's just, and the guys who buy the remakes are like, fuck you, like these are better,

[17:16] like there's, it's got newer technology.

[17:19] And this will just keep that civil war going even more.

[17:23] So it's going to be interesting to see because Chicago Gaming Company said they're looking

[17:26] into this issue and are going to try and come up with a possible fix.

[17:30] I'm a lot of looking at it, but like I said, to me, like I said, I've known plenty of

[17:35] people who had both, and they think that the remakes is just fine, plays fantastic, plays

[17:42] just like the original.

[17:43] They don't know anything about this.

[17:45] So I've never even heard of this before.

[17:46] So I mean, I haven't read that thread.

[17:48] So you know something, this is something I'm not worried about at all.

[17:52] What's going to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's

[17:55] going to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's going

[17:57] to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's going to be, what's

[18:01] going to be, it's like okay, let's get ahead of him.

[18:04] You know what?

[18:05] What em'.

[18:06] It's...

[18:07] It's life.

[18:08] It's life.

[18:08] And you can't feel like you can feel it.

[18:10] You know it, it's like i'm going to give you a really good fold on something.

[18:16] You know what, so I find it fun for me to go down so solid and I'm supposed to pay

[18:20] how they go over the city as ever.

[18:21] Didn't know that play anywhere, listen, you know, and that one, you know what I mean,

[18:25] I feel, this is personally, I feel it's nowhere near as good as scared stiff.

[18:30] So I mean, what you just keep bashing the sauce and there's nothing there, where there's

[18:35] a dozen things to do on scared stiff.

[18:36] So I've actually, and this is very surprising for me, put that aside saying, I don't need

[18:42] to get, I don't like medieval madness, I know people think that's the number one game in

[18:46] the world, but I just never understood it, I don't get it.

[18:51] So AFM is out, and now if Monster Bash is the next game, that is something I would

[18:58] seriously be into getting, because you know, the science fiction, the monster thing is

[19:02] my thing, and it played Monster Bash a lot, and I think Monster Bash is a real fun game.

[19:08] Yeah, I mean, it's, look, it's, it's considered to be one of the best games of all time, a nice

[19:14] Monster Bash, like a mint restored in great condition Monster Bash can, can be upwards

[19:20] of $10,000 or more.

[19:22] Not anymore, we're not anymore, right, because the remakes, right, they're now starting to

[19:27] sink down into the $8,500, $9,000 range, but even then, it's a good time to wait, because

[19:35] by the time they announced that Ted, it should be around, they're going to show it at TPS,

[19:40] Texas Pimball Festival, I believe in February.

[19:42] I can't even spell it.

[19:45] And they, you know, you're also looking at the Elvira, the third, you know, installment

[19:52] of the Elvira game from Dennis Morgan.

[19:55] So that probably should be a 2018 title.

[19:59] So you're, you're going to have a lot of nice options when it comes to you.

[20:03] The options out there are fantastic.

[20:05] You've got, you've got Kudini, you've got Thunderbirds, you've got Elvira, you've got

[20:11] a possibility of Guardians of the Galaxy.

[20:15] You've got a possibility of the next Jersey Jack game, which they're rumoring to be Toy

[20:20] Story, which I have absolutely zero interest in.

[20:22] It's pirates.

[20:23] We're going to go down this list, we're going to go down the manufacturer list and we

[20:26] talk about extra predictions, but oh, great.

[20:29] You're on to something.

[20:30] I mean, there is, this is a good time to hold on to your wallet, because I think in

[20:35] the next six months, you're in a field day.

[20:38] So speaking of, I know, I know you saw a little bit of this drama.

[20:41] I was in the middle of it.

[20:42] I just curious what your thoughts were on the, on Mike from Home Pin sort of using some

[20:48] inflated language to describe certain individuals.

[20:52] Do you think it has a place in Pimple?

[20:54] I read it.

[20:55] I read it.

[20:56] You know, something, this is one of these things.

[20:59] It's like, well, maybe it's because I had too much to kill.

[21:02] I don't know.

[21:03] It's one of the stupidest things that I've ever read.

[21:05] If you could hear the way me and my friends talk once a week or we have the parties in

[21:13] our house, we do our band camp and we do our, you know, we do our, if you could hear the

[21:17] way we talk in that room, it would make that conversation that he has looked tame by

[21:23] comparison.

[21:24] And trust me, all these people, we are the least bigoted people you could possibly imagine.

[21:30] We don't give a shit about that stuff, but just the way we talk, it's just the way we

[21:34] talk.

[21:35] And that's that.

[21:37] And so I don't really give two shits about what this guy is saying or what he does.

[21:42] I care about the pinball machine.

[21:44] What was, what was they said at one point they said that Ford was like the biggest bigger,

[21:50] the biggest anti-Semite or whatever that was in the world.

[21:53] And so who's not buying his cars?

[21:55] This is, we don't really know what people believe.

[21:57] We don't know what they say.

[21:59] And personally, I don't give two shits.

[22:02] If he comes out with a good pinball machine, I'm buying it.

[22:05] If not, I'm not.

[22:06] That's it.

[22:07] What he does in his spare time or how he talks, I really couldn't care less because, believe

[22:12] me, I think we've all thought and said for the worst things that we've read on that website.

[22:17] So, yeah, I think, well, I think the issue that Ted is like, and I, you know, I've been

[22:21] in the cigar bars with the whiskey flowing and, and, you know, just a bunch of men.

[22:26] With me?

[22:27] Of.

[22:28] Yeah.

[22:29] Well, again, it's, it's, but the difference is this.

[22:30] Like, if you were not in a private environment with your close friends and you were on a

[22:37] public forum and you were saying those things publicly, would you have the same level of

[22:43] comfort that you do in the privacy of your home or with friends?

[22:51] Because the problem when you go public, you know, and then you defend it is, you know,

[22:55] you're also used to head of a company here.

[22:57] You know, you sell in a product to people and, you know, there are certain words that,

[23:03] and I've been with you guys and you guys are not that bad.

[23:07] You're not using.

[23:09] Oh, you haven't been to our parties, but I get what you're saying.

[23:14] And I understand what you're saying.

[23:17] And, you know, you know what, if that kind of talk, you know, turns people off, they're

[23:23] totally free to exercise their right and not buy the machine.

[23:27] And I have, there's nothing wrong with that.

[23:29] I get it.

[23:30] And that's fine.

[23:31] But to be honest with you, I think probably 98% of the people either A, don't know about

[23:38] it or B couldn't care less.

[23:40] If the machine comes out and it's good, they're going to buy it.

[23:43] So you think pinball overrides the person, right?

[23:47] So the same, like I said before, we don't know what people believe or have said.

[23:53] About anything that we buy in our homes, whether they're cars or refrigerators or who

[23:58] knows what.

[23:59] You know, so I mean, it's like, I don't know.

[24:02] I don't know.

[24:03] But I think the point is with the whole story, and we'll move on because we've already,

[24:07] I've delivered this like three times in different podcasts.

[24:09] And the point is when you do get caught saying something that could be seen as very, you

[24:17] know, insensitive and insulting, you know, if you got caught, and I was like, oh, here,

[24:22] you were like, you know, most guys would just like apologize, be like, you know what?

[24:27] I didn't mean anything by it.

[24:28] I'm not that, but you know, I shouldn't have used that language, whatever.

[24:31] But I think the problem now with where Mike is at is, and this is just the Aussie arcade

[24:35] form.

[24:36] It's like very, it seems like it's a very cultural thing where they just keep defending

[24:40] it.

[24:41] And it's like on some level, Ted, if I sent, if I sent the company that licenses Thunder

[24:46] Birds, if I sent them screen grabs, but the guy who's making the game is dropping the

[24:52] N word and dropping the F word, do you think they would license that game to that man?

[24:59] Um, probably not.

[25:01] So I don't think it should come to that.

[25:04] You know, I think Mike should just apologize, but I'm just saying, you know, we live in

[25:07] a world where like, you got to just be careful.

[25:09] You got to, I get that.

[25:11] And what I'm saying is I'm in the, in the film world where I'm used to licensing and

[25:15] all that kind of stuff.

[25:17] And whenever myself or any of my friends have licensed anything, no one has asked them

[25:24] what they believe, check their website or do whatever.

[25:27] It goes through a legal process.

[25:29] They look for the rights.

[25:30] Here's how much it costs and they do it.

[25:32] That's it.

[25:33] No one says, oh, wait a minute.

[25:34] This guy did a, did a, uh, uh, uh, on a website.

[25:37] He said something about this or he said, he said that.

[25:41] I don't think they think that way.

[25:43] Unless it's pinball is such a small thing.

[25:46] Unless this thing is out there in the world, like major thing that's going to be on the,

[25:51] on the 10 o'clock news, no one really cares about this stuff.

[25:55] When you put an application to get rights for something, they look at the application,

[26:00] they look at what you're doing and they give it to you where they don't, they don't

[26:02] ask you a bunch of questions or put you through a test as far as what you believe, what

[26:06] you've texted.

[26:08] That just doesn't come into play.

[26:10] So it doesn't, like we know it goes both way.

[26:11] I mean, we've seen like Billy Bush would still have a job if he wasn't recorded talking

[26:16] to Donald Trump, right?

[26:17] So it's like, but that's a big difference in pinball stuff that no one really knows about.

[26:22] No, I'm saying, but like in our little community, even though it's small, when, when people

[26:27] do become aware of it, I don't, I wouldn't necessarily agree that no one gives a shit as

[26:31] long as like the pinball machine is good, right?

[26:33] I think I think there are, there are, there are, there are some people who don't want

[26:38] to support certain people, right?

[26:39] I think, and the, my point is, if you're running a company, make everybody your customer.

[26:45] Just, just leave all the bullshit out, you know, leave the politics out, leave like the,

[26:52] the bad language out.

[26:53] Just, you, you never see Gary Stern getting like into the mix.

[26:57] You don't even see Jack anymore, right?

[26:59] These guys, they're, you know what?

[27:01] You're talking to the wrong person about that.

[27:03] I, I, I don't like it that these people don't get into the mix.

[27:08] I like it when they do.

[27:09] Well, I'm, the mix I'm talking about though, is there not, like Gary's not out there, bad

[27:14] malding, another competitor, right?

[27:15] But not there.

[27:17] That's the only reason.

[27:18] Right.

[27:19] People crap on anything you say because there's out of a hundred people, you have 20 assholes

[27:24] that will crap on anything.

[27:26] So these people from Stern or from Jersey Jack will not go on anymore.

[27:30] Right.

[27:31] I like when these people do come on.

[27:33] I like it when American pinball comes on and when you send a, a, a text to them or something,

[27:39] they answer you right away.

[27:40] I like that.

[27:41] I like it when the record these guys come on.

[27:45] And I think it's a privilege that we have that they come on there and give us some insight

[27:48] into the company.

[27:49] And when these people just crap all over them for whatever reason, who wants to put up

[27:55] with that?

[27:56] So I get it.

[27:57] My Gary Stern doesn't come on.

[27:59] He doesn't need to.

[28:00] But it's, it's, to our benefit, like in the home pin that we can actually watch this

[28:06] company, you know, go or American pinball, they're keeping us up to date on everything

[28:11] they're doing with, with Houdini and all this stuff.

[28:13] I love looking at that.

[28:14] I think that, right?

[28:15] I wish, I wish we had more of that.

[28:17] Well, I think everybody does, right?

[28:20] And I think, you know, the form is not just pin side.

[28:23] I mean, every form out there.

[28:24] They, they, they make it really difficult for the companies to engage because, you know,

[28:30] it's your point.

[28:31] There's just, you got to take the good with the bad.

[28:33] And you know, a lot of them are just like, it's just not worth it because you get trapped.

[28:37] But the thing is, these people are human beings.

[28:40] They put their, their time, their money, sometimes their, their life and soul into making something

[28:46] and someone comes on and shits on it.

[28:49] Not without even giving you a review saying, oh, well, you know, I think this is, that you

[28:53] could improve this, you could do that.

[28:55] Oh, this sucks and you're an asshole.

[28:57] You know, I mean, they don't have, they don't have the right way of doing it.

[29:00] They're not being constructive.

[29:01] They're just assholes.

[29:04] And when people are in a big company, they don't have to put up with that.

[29:07] So they leave.

[29:08] And that's, you know, that's bad.

[29:10] I would be the easiest way to avoid all that.

[29:12] It's just make Star Wars a good game and then we don't have to tell people how shitty it

[29:16] is.

[29:17] No, I'm joking.

[29:18] I'm joking.

[29:19] So tell me, tell me why I'm shitting.

[29:21] Yeah, because there's a test fighter on a spring, dude.

[29:25] You had two years to make it.

[29:27] Anyway, let's switch gears.

[29:29] Let's, let's, let's just a Star Wars.

[29:31] I agree.

[29:32] I want to play it.

[29:34] I haven't played the premium or the LE yet, but the videos I've seen that that's their

[29:39] major toy is a globe that that opens up.

[29:44] It's the Jurassic Park, Fabreja A. They just pops open with like a lollipop in the middle.

[29:50] Like I was at the park has a freaking dinosaur head that comes down and grabs the ball.

[29:55] And also Jurassic Park, the egg actually cracks open in the movie that I don't remember

[29:59] the death star splitting down the middle with a lollipop inside.

[30:03] Oh, you missed that first.

[30:05] Yeah, that must have been the, uh, diversity that version of Star Wars that like it was made

[30:09] in the Middle East and they just like basically took like 75% of the film and then just

[30:14] spliced in like Middle Eastern actors like for the rest of it.

[30:18] And they just released it like, it's like Turkish Star Wars or something.

[30:22] Anyway, let's talk about our predictions for Expo and because this will get us to go down

[30:28] the list of what's going on with these manufacturers and what we think will either be at the show

[30:33] or what they'll sort of be announcing around the show because Expo is more than just the

[30:38] show itself.

[30:39] A lot of these brands will be making some sort of announcement to be part of the news

[30:43] wave.

[30:44] So let's start with Stern Pimble.

[30:46] So Ted, the rumor is that Stern is not going to bring Guardians of the Galaxy, which

[30:51] is their next pin with John Borg and Christopher Franchion on art.

[30:56] Do you, do you think Stern is going to surprise people and actually show it on the Stern

[31:01] tour that takes place at Expo?

[31:04] You know, we don't, we don't know.

[31:05] I mean, Stern is very good at keeping secrets and the way we found out on certain things,

[31:10] well, hey, certain people have been right, but other people have found out like, you know,

[31:14] when the guy on whatever the hell it was, Metallica, whatever, he publishes his book with the

[31:17] pictures in it or someone says something.

[31:20] You know, so, so I don't know.

[31:22] I mean, but, but I'll tell you, I'd say at this point, a lot of the rumors that have

[31:29] happened over the past few years where people have said these are the next games, they've

[31:32] been the next games, right?

[31:34] Yeah, they've seen what they're going to do with the wrestling thing or whatever, but

[31:38] most of them they've gotten right, right?

[31:40] Yeah, people have been pretty accurate, right?

[31:42] And Stern's tried to do some leaking of misinformation with the head.

[31:49] Remember, like, there was like a Stern banner, a Slayer concert and it was then Aerosmith

[31:53] and it was just, I think some of that stuff is meant to throw people off the sand.

[31:58] But Guardian's...

[31:59] Oh, people are sophisticated now and they go and they look into the, into the copyrights

[32:04] and they find out who's, you know, applied for certain licenses and things and they figure

[32:08] it out.

[32:09] So, I mean, you know, it's not like he used to be.

[32:11] Now, you get these guys that are really sophisticated that could go in there on the internet and

[32:15] figure this out by who's, you know, who's bought certain licenses and they find out.

[32:20] It says Stern's name under Star Wars.

[32:22] Well, you pretty much know they're going to put out a Star Wars movie.

[32:25] Right.

[32:26] Well, there's just a lot of people that work at Stern right too, right?

[32:28] I mean, it's really hard to maintain leaks.

[32:30] I mean, all you need is someone and usually it's that the distributors I find that have

[32:34] the loose lips.

[32:35] I mean, you know, Stern's sales people probably tell the distributors the major ones what's

[32:39] coming in the pipeline and those guys always spill the beans to their best customers and

[32:45] that's all it takes.

[32:46] And I just wish they would stop with all this nonsense about how titles are secret for

[32:52] it's because I know what movies are coming out.

[32:55] I know what video games are coming out.

[32:57] It's like the only reason they keep this shit quiet is so that you rush the buy every

[33:03] new one and you don't hold on to your money and wait for the theme you really want.

[33:08] But I think it's coming to the point now with the amount of volume.

[33:11] It's not really effective because where it hurts Stern is they don't announce their games

[33:17] early enough to put them on location for quality control testing.

[33:21] And then what you get when you buy one is you are the quality tester.

[33:26] You are the creative tester.

[33:27] Doesn't matter.

[33:28] They've done it that way.

[33:31] People buy it that way and it doesn't matter.

[33:33] So why change?

[33:34] It's catching up though.

[33:35] It's going to catch up.

[33:36] It's going to catch up to them.

[33:37] I've been saying that in the next two years.

[33:39] There's finally a case.

[33:41] Everybody says that until you say one word.

[33:45] Jaws.

[33:46] Fuck.

[33:47] Take my money.

[33:48] It's never happening.

[33:49] It's never happening.

[33:50] I don't know.

[33:51] How many people got fooled by Ghostbusters?

[33:56] Nobody.

[33:57] A lot of people got fooled by Ghostbusters.

[33:59] People didn't know that was a minute next title coming out.

[34:02] Did they?

[34:03] Well, I think, you know, look.

[34:05] So at Expo to bring it back there.

[34:07] So Guardians probably won't be there as the rumor.

[34:10] I think.

[34:11] Oh, well, probably won't be there or probably won't be announced.

[34:13] It probably won't even be announced because here's what I'm hearing.

[34:16] I'm hearing Star Wars sales are not that great for where they should be for Star Wars,

[34:22] right?

[34:23] The Star Wars is not tanking like Mustang or WWE by any means, but they paid a lot of money

[34:29] for the Star Wars license and the game is not selling as well as they would like.

[34:34] The other part is I think they're going to release Batman 66 code because it's been

[34:42] a year because they revealed that at Expo, since that game has had a real code update.

[34:48] I didn't forgot about Batman.

[34:52] Everyone has.

[34:53] I mean, think about that game.

[34:55] We sales of that game must have just halted.

[35:00] Like, everyone's probably just waiting for the code.

[35:03] But now that it's so long has gone by, even if you release code, are people going to

[35:08] come back to that title, right?

[35:10] So have you played it?

[35:11] Yeah, I've played it a few times and a few shows.

[35:14] I mean, how is it?

[35:15] I mean, it's, it's got promise, but again, like the code is so not there.

[35:20] And you just, well, I mean, if they came up with the code, I mean, would it be a fun

[35:24] game?

[35:25] Yeah, it'd be a fun game.

[35:26] But here's the thing, Batman needs to be more than just a fun game.

[35:29] They sold a $15,000 version.

[35:32] The Ellie's was super one.

[35:33] I mean, they only have like, the Ellie's were 10 grand.

[35:37] And then they had like the premium, which is really just a glorified, it's just a pro,

[35:42] was 8 grand.

[35:43] So it turns most expensive machine of all time, right?

[35:47] It's their 30th anniversary birthday present to themselves, really embarrassing that it,

[35:51] a year has gone by and it's still without decent code.

[35:54] I mean, it really is.

[35:57] Yeah, well, I don't get that.

[36:01] I don't understand the situation with the code.

[36:05] It seems like it's an easy thing to fix.

[36:08] You know, if you got to hire a few more people, just work on these games constantly and get

[36:12] the code up.

[36:13] I don't know.

[36:14] I don't understand what they're thinking when they have people wait for you.

[36:18] I think what it might be is that they're probably figuring that the majority of the people

[36:23] are like me.

[36:25] Even that, if you would give me a, let's say, a Metallica game that's the way it is now,

[36:31] and the way it would be with the code perfectly, completely done, I probably couldn't tell the

[36:36] difference.

[36:37] You know, people are in a bar playing a game or an arcade, they're drunk and they're

[36:41] walking by.

[36:42] They probably couldn't care about this.

[36:43] The only people that really care about it are people that have the games in their home

[36:49] that play them like that.

[36:50] So, you know, maybe that's it.

[36:53] I don't know.

[36:54] I mean, like, Steven wants to make the games good for both on location and for collectors.

[37:01] I think my hunch is that, and I'm just, this is just a hunch, is that the LCD is throwing

[37:08] lime in off a little bit because it requires so much more and also because there's 120

[37:14] Batman episodes he has to go through, you know, to pick scenes and code against them

[37:19] and then integrate with the LCD.

[37:22] It's the first time he's ever had to do that with an LCD.

[37:24] I think it's really throwing them for a loop.

[37:27] He's probably also working on other stuff.

[37:29] There's no way he'd be the most inefficient man on the planet if he's only been working

[37:33] on this one game for an entire year and it's still not done.

[37:37] So I wish I could get that job.

[37:39] So yes, we're going to go on to the next manufacturer, but so just final, yes or no, do you think

[37:45] no guardians at Expo?

[37:49] I think there's going to be announcement of guardians at Expo.

[37:54] What month is Expo?

[37:56] Exposing in like 10 days.

[37:59] Oh, yes.

[38:00] Okay, wait a minute.

[38:02] And what's, let me see, what's Stern's latest is Star Wars.

[38:08] So I mean, are they supposed to announce a new game at Expo?

[38:12] I mean, that's the rumor.

[38:14] We're just making guesses because we're going to do a little scorecard like when we eat.

[38:16] So if they are, I'm guessing they're going to announce guardians.

[38:21] Okay.

[38:22] I think my hunch is that even though people want to see it, I don't think they're going

[38:26] to do it.

[38:27] Again, I think the people, the bean counters are running the show when it comes to reveals.

[38:32] Look, they missed, they missed May 4th.

[38:34] They missed the Star Wars convention to bring the Star Wars game.

[38:38] What do you think?

[38:40] Game is.

[38:41] I know it's going to be guardians.

[38:43] They're just not going to let people see guardians.

[38:45] And here's why because it's going to make Star Wars look like shit.

[38:49] And they know that they need to milk the Star Wars cow as long as they can because once

[38:56] people see it next to guardians, they're going to realize what I've been saying for a few

[39:00] months now.

[39:01] Steve Richie just needs to retire.

[39:04] He's done.

[39:05] That is the worst theme integration I've ever seen with a major license.

[39:09] Anyway, moving on.

[39:10] Okay.

[39:12] The big sort of excitement for this show is Jersey Jack Pimball is confirmed.

[39:18] This isn't speculating on whether or not a new game is going to be shown.

[39:22] He is bringing game number four.

[39:24] He's bringing five versions of it.

[39:26] I believe they're going to have a live from Expo moment on Thursday night where they're

[39:32] going to pull the curtain off of it.

[39:35] And all but everyone knows that it's going to be pyrid to the Caribbean.

[39:39] It's going to be based on all five movies.

[39:41] I heard Johnny Depp is in it.

[39:45] Release the crack in Motherfuckers.

[39:48] This is big news because Jack is is finally hitting a cadence where we're not waiting three

[39:53] to four years for the next title.

[39:55] Well, you know what?

[39:56] This is absolutely phenomenal news for me because I have absolutely zero interest in

[40:02] pirates of the Caribbean.

[40:05] So this is great news.

[40:07] It's another game.

[40:08] I don't have to worry about getting.

[40:09] So is it just a theme that you don't like?

[40:11] Is that really the aversion?

[40:12] I have absolutely zero interest in pirates of the Caribbean.

[40:18] I have zero interest in toy story.

[40:21] So this is wonderful news.

[40:23] Let me put this one.

[40:25] I have more interest in either alien or Houdimi.

[40:29] Right.

[40:30] Well, look, you know what?

[40:32] You can never argue a man on his, you know, what theme is speaking to him, right?

[40:36] It's the most subjective part of our hobby.

[40:40] There are just certain themes that people could care less about.

[40:43] Like I agree that pirates when I first heard it, I was like, you know what?

[40:50] They're still making pirates movies.

[40:51] I think the last one got like a 20% on Rod and Tomatoes and you know, we're, it's a little

[40:58] long in the tooth now, right?

[41:00] I mean, it's, I didn't even go see it because two or three people I know went to see

[41:05] it instead of no big deal.

[41:06] So I didn't even go.

[41:07] I just actually saw it.

[41:09] I watched it on my way back from Seattle.

[41:11] I was there for business last week.

[41:13] And I was like, let me watch it.

[41:14] You know, it's like dead men tell no lies.

[41:16] I think that's the name of it.

[41:18] And you know, it's a big popcorn flake.

[41:23] But here's the problem with it.

[41:24] Remember how awesome it was when we first saw Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.

[41:29] Like he was so refreshing.

[41:30] You know, he was sort of punking Keith Richards.

[41:33] The whole thing felt original and fun.

[41:36] This one by the fifth installment, I felt like it was Johnny Depp playing Johnny Depp

[41:41] who's playing Johnny Depp who's playing Jack Sparrow.

[41:44] It's like, it's like this parody of himself, of a parody of himself.

[41:48] And they're just going through the motions in it right now.

[41:52] That being said, that being said, if they were to take like the major sort of, the major

[41:59] goals of each movie made them mose and the crack in and you know, finding Poseidon's

[42:05] staff and the tried enough Poseidon.

[42:08] Like there's really cool things that happen in these films.

[42:12] And pirates is just a theme.

[42:15] Has potential.

[42:16] Right.

[42:17] Now I wouldn't be excited if Stern was making this game.

[42:20] But because it's Jersey Jack, there's always that level of excitement because Jack does

[42:25] the popcorn.

[42:26] You're right.

[42:27] You're right.

[42:28] But if it was a Stern machine, I might not be even interested in seeing it.

[42:33] But because Jersey Jack, it's something I would be looking at.

[42:37] Yeah, I almost bought a hobbit.

[42:40] So I don't know.

[42:43] But I have to wait for this new L viral machine because, you know, I mean, Dennis Gordman

[42:51] is, well, you know, I did the interview with him.

[42:53] I spoke to him.

[42:54] He's a real, real nice guy.

[42:56] I think he did an incredible job.

[42:58] I still to the state that scared stiff is the best pinball machine ever made.

[43:04] And if he's going to do even close to that or exceed that with the new L viral, it's

[43:10] going to be a must have for a lot of people.

[43:12] Right.

[43:13] Well, we know you're excited for that.

[43:17] We hope it's great.

[43:18] I've got what he's making it with Stern.

[43:21] I would you, well, here's an interesting question.

[43:24] Would you rather he make it with Stern or make it with Jersey Jack pinball?

[43:27] Well, I would always, well, you know, look, I like all the pinball companies.

[43:33] If I had to pick for a picture, he jack only because I think you would have more toys

[43:40] and more stuff.

[43:43] But either one he's going with Stern.

[43:45] That's a big only though.

[43:48] That's a big, that's the big differentiators.

[43:51] I think Jack doesn't design down to a price, maybe to a fault, right?

[43:56] I mean, sent the company into financial tail spin twice.

[44:01] But now that they've got money and dialed in, man, look at that thing.

[44:06] It's packed.

[44:07] I know.

[44:08] We played it.

[44:09] I remember it.

[44:10] It's cool.

[44:11] But you know, I don't think Dennis Norton is going to settle.

[44:18] I think he's going to know that he came out with L viral in the party monsters, which was

[44:22] a good machine, a scarce stiff, which is a phenomenal machine.

[44:29] And he's got to beat that.

[44:31] So I'm really looking forward to what he's going to come up with with this machine.

[44:38] It should be a lot of fun.

[44:40] Well, I think what's going to, what's probably happening now within the boardroom at Stern

[44:45] is that they're looking at what the competition is doing and they have to, they have to make

[44:51] a decision to add more to their games, right?

[44:55] The price is already where it should be for what people expect when it comes to a game

[45:01] that's loaded.

[45:03] But the loaded game hasn't been delivered from that yet.

[45:08] When you look at a game like the Simpsons pinball party, I'm like, shit, this would be a $15,000

[45:13] star now if it came out.

[45:16] They had sculpted, they had more toys, they had sculpted things, they had upper plate

[45:21] fields, they had like three flippers and all this stuff going on.

[45:26] And nowadays it's more about like, well, what can we take out to get to a higher profit

[45:31] margin?

[45:32] So look, I agree with you, Jeff.

[45:33] The good thing about Stern though is they come out.

[45:37] They'll release two or three or whatever games they do a year.

[45:41] I mean, they come out.

[45:42] They've had no competition and you're right.

[45:44] They are the only ones who have consistently put a game in your living room, but that

[45:47] is changing.

[45:48] With Jack's new cadence, they've got to be paying attention to Jersey Jack.

[45:52] So I think Pirates, my hunch on Pirates, I think it's really going to be exciting because

[45:58] there's a brand new designer making the game as a young kid.

[46:02] I think it's going to bring a fresh new sort of take on layout and toys because it's

[46:09] not the same old guys rehashing their old ideas.

[46:12] So I think this game is going to surprise people.

[46:15] I really do.

[46:16] I don't think it's going to underweld.

[46:19] I also think it's going to dare I say like steal some of the thunder away from dialed

[46:26] in.

[46:27] But again, how long can a pinball machine hype last?

[46:29] Like six months to a year is like really all you get.

[46:34] I still, because pinball seems to be making this transition from arcades and bars or whatever

[46:45] to the home use.

[46:48] And if what some people say is true, where the majority now, the machines are sold to the

[46:53] home market, I think the company should look into a number of different things for that.

[47:01] Number one, they should look into making a play field that is going to last a lot longer

[47:06] because they're not just machines that are going to be built to be used for a few years

[47:11] and then trashed.

[47:12] These are games that are putting people's homes and they're meant to be kept for 10 or

[47:17] 20 years.

[47:18] So they should look to make a play field or whatever material they look that will keep.

[47:23] Whether they need clifters out or whatever, these should be installed from the factory,

[47:27] whatever it is to preserve what needs to be done on these pinball machines.

[47:32] Underneath the machine, it needs to be made where people can service them very easily.

[47:37] You're not going to have to get in there with soldering irons and this kind of stuff.

[47:41] They have to be able to be very easily maintained.

[47:44] If I have a lot of friends who are very wealthy that have a number of pinball machines,

[47:49] 20, 30 machines in their game room and they know nothing about them and they have people

[47:54] have to come in and work on these things constantly because they continuously have a problem

[47:59] or go down.

[48:00] Whereas if they could just swap out a board or swap out something or make it a modular

[48:04] system, somehow no soldering, everything is plug and play, something that could be done

[48:10] very easily at home.

[48:12] I think this is the kind of stuff they should look into doing now to change pinball over

[48:17] if they are transferring over to a home use machine.

[48:25] That's the kind of stuff that if I was doing a pinball machine, that's what I would look

[48:29] into doing now is making a machine to the last and it's very easy to service.

[48:33] It's very, very well put, Tetta.

[48:37] I kind of want to like, etch that into marble and put it into some like pinball museum.

[48:42] That is beautiful.

[48:43] Beautiful.

[48:44] But no.

[48:45] People are trying to do that.

[48:47] We saw Andrew Highway try to do that with more easy modular system that were things popping

[48:52] it out.

[48:53] So you're not soldering you flipper coils and making maintenance and a lot easier on the

[49:00] game.

[49:01] People looking at different play fields, I agree.

[49:03] Wood chips, clear coat chips, wood scratches.

[49:08] Is that the only material that a ball can roll over?

[49:11] No, it's not.

[49:12] It's like get rid of some of this just legacy to approach and we might get some fun new

[49:18] stuff.

[49:19] Now, let's go back to Expo because I wanted to talk about a few more games that I know

[49:23] you're excited about.

[49:24] Who Dini will be there?

[49:27] How do you think who Dini's going to fare?

[49:31] Do you think we're going to see it this year or is it going to come out early 2018?

[49:37] Well, you know what, every company says the same thing.

[49:41] They give you their timelines and they never meet them.

[49:43] It's always a way ahead of that.

[49:48] They seem pretty good.

[49:49] They seem pretty honest about what they're doing.

[49:53] Who Dini I think can be a great machine.

[49:55] I mean, I've played it at the Alan Town and I watched it and every time that freaking

[50:01] ball jumps across that play field into the trunk, everybody just goes, whoa.

[50:07] It's a fun game.

[50:10] So yeah, I think who Dini, I mean, everybody knows who Dini, it's a great theme.

[50:17] I think that could really do something.

[50:21] So yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing that with Dini game.

[50:23] All right.

[50:24] I think, you know, I'm curious to see just how the game is refined and I've seen it at

[50:29] T.P.F.

[50:30] I've saw it at Alan Town with you Ted and I've said it from the very end.

[50:34] It's bad and that's early.

[50:36] Well, look, it's amazing what they were able to get together for T.P.F.

[50:42] Considering they had to, again, kick J-pop to the curb and start over and, you know, just

[50:51] redo the machine.

[50:52] All right.

[50:53] It wasn't going to be John Papadouk's Zidware, who Dini, where ball geometry just didn't

[50:58] work.

[50:59] So they brought Joe Balser and they brought Josh Kuhler in to do the coding.

[51:03] And, you know, I think it's got some really fun toys and I think it's, you know, my take

[51:10] on the art and I've said this to my friends over to American Pimball, I did love the Matt

[51:15] Andrews sort of more cartoon-stylized version of the Houdini art, but they decided to go

[51:20] with more of a photo-realistic sort of steampunk look.

[51:23] That's fine.

[51:24] It works.

[51:25] I like what they do with the LCD screen, with the kernel on the back box.

[51:27] It looks really cool.

[51:28] I think now people are going to be able to see the refinement in the game, right?

[51:34] So we're any of the shots refined because the game did play very tight when I played it.

[51:38] Like, there were a lot of brick shots.

[51:39] It's a difficult game.

[51:41] And I also, you know, the code was very early on.

[51:44] So I'm curious to see how the game now speaks to me because I think the shots are there.

[51:49] I think for the money, the shots are there.

[51:51] Now, the rumor I'm hearing is this and I told this to my friends at American Pimball from

[51:55] the very beginning.

[51:57] They price the game too low for the bomb and they're probably going to lose money on

[52:02] everyone's sold if they sell it for the price they said it at.

[52:06] Let them do it.

[52:07] I don't care.

[52:08] If I was an investor, I'd care.

[52:11] But once again, you know, you can't price your game before you know how much it costs

[52:17] to actually make it.

[52:19] I think they've got a pretty good handle on it.

[52:22] They've never made a Pimball game before.

[52:25] They didn't have a handle on it.

[52:27] What are you kidding me?

[52:28] They made magic, girl.

[52:30] Yeah.

[52:31] No, you know, hey, look, if they have to take a little bit of a hit on it, which maybe

[52:35] Jack did on Wizard of Oz, who knows if they have to just go.

[52:39] Going fine.

[52:40] You know, that's fine.

[52:41] They look what happened with Alien.

[52:43] Right.

[52:44] They came out with a price and now they have to up the price.

[52:47] You know, who knows?

[52:48] You know, but I think I think Houdini is actually, if it works and it's as good as it seems

[52:54] to be.

[52:55] You know, a really good seller.

[52:56] And you don't want, I think, you know, a sturd should really be worried at this point

[53:03] because it's not just you have a bunch of pinball making companies that are coming out

[53:11] with a maybe machine or it may suck or they're coming out with some really solid competitive

[53:17] machines.

[53:18] So, it's spooky coming out with Alice Cooper and with that, what's it called?

[53:25] A annihilation?

[53:26] Oh, the nuclear annihilation.

[53:27] Sound or whatever the hell it is.

[53:30] Which everyone is seeming to love.

[53:34] You have, you know, the Houdini game, you have the Alien game, you have the Thunderbirds

[53:39] game.

[53:40] I mean, you have games coming out.

[53:42] And what's the other one that I was always looking at the time?

[53:45] What the hell was it called?

[53:47] The time going back in time and the dinosaur.

[53:51] Oh, I got it right.

[53:53] Why?

[53:54] Time is a time bandit.

[53:55] Did I know?

[53:56] Time something.

[53:57] Whatever the hell it is.

[53:59] Hold on.

[54:00] Anyway, time shock.

[54:03] It's time shock.

[54:04] Yes.

[54:05] You have all of these games that are coming out and that look pretty damn good.

[54:11] And that's, you know, for every game that people are saying, okay, I can only afford to

[54:15] buy two games a year and I would buy, you know, Guardians of Galaxy and Star Wars or Batman

[54:21] or whatever.

[54:22] And now they're saying, okay, well, now I just might buy Star Wars and Houdini or Star

[54:27] Wars and Thunderbirds or Star Wars and Aliens or whatever.

[54:31] This is taking, you know, money away from Stern.

[54:34] You know, there's a lot of companies out there with some good stuff.

[54:37] And I think that ultimately this is, you know, these companies are going to be competing

[54:41] with each other, you know, for the money and they're strategically when they make their

[54:45] announcements and what kind of, you know, games they make.

[54:48] I think the next five years is going to be very, very interesting for, you know, pinball.

[54:53] Right.

[54:54] It'll be fun to watch.

[54:55] Like I, I don't think Stern has that much competition when you actually look at the

[55:01] numbers, right?

[55:02] And when Stern's assembly line is full going, it's 50 games a day, right?

[55:07] So you think in like a week they make more games and Charlie's made since he started

[55:14] spooky.

[55:15] But that's, but that's one company.

[55:17] Well, no, I, where I would use this, here's, here's Stern's problem right now.

[55:21] Well, Stern has all the themes locked down.

[55:23] The problem with Stern is very simple.

[55:27] Next after spooky and again, spooky is up in the end.

[55:30] But Stern is just not making the best games.

[55:35] And they should be.

[55:36] They have the most people.

[55:37] They have the most resources.

[55:39] They have the most experience.

[55:42] And yet the product they're releasing is, is not stellar anymore.

[55:48] And when you look at who's actually now got the chops to make a lot of games, you've got

[55:54] Jersey Jack and Chicago gaming.

[55:56] Those two are the big ones.

[55:57] Like that's like, that's like, they got to fight a two front war against, you know, Europe

[56:03] and Russia and, and, and, and, you know, and Jersey and, and Jersey Jack and, and Chicago

[56:08] gaming, they, they can make volume games that are really good.

[56:13] And then you add into the mix all these little other like, you know, like, sort of rogue

[56:17] nations, like American pinball coming at you, Dutch pinball coming at you, highly pinball

[56:21] coming at you.

[56:22] It's like everyone's coming at that market share.

[56:26] And yeah, if you're Stern, every game sold by someone else will most likely chip away

[56:32] at your bottom line.

[56:33] Absolutely.

[56:34] Um, but because there's, there's competition.

[56:38] There's a certain game is the only ones I'm really interested in.

[56:43] Possibly is the Elvire game and maybe Guardians of the Galactic.

[56:48] And that's if it's, if it's phenomenal.

[56:50] So, you know, I don't, I don't know.

[56:54] Let's, so when you, when you say that he's think who do you need is going to sell well

[56:57] to add like, how many units, if you had the guests, do you think they could sell in, in

[57:01] the pinball market?

[57:02] You know what?

[57:03] If I had that information, they'd be hiring me.

[57:08] But but what do you think they're guessing it is like 500 to 50,000?

[57:14] Oh, no, I would guess that they're definitely aiming it more than 250 or 500.

[57:19] You know, I'm guessing that they would hope to be selling, you know, one or 2000 or more.

[57:25] But that's still pathetic numbers compared to what these companies used to make.

[57:29] You know, back in the heyday when they could make 10 or 15 or 20,000 games.

[57:35] Right.

[57:36] So, you know, I don't know.

[57:38] By now, now they standards, if you sold one or 2000, you'd be doing great.

[57:45] Yeah.

[57:46] The problem with the companies of like American pinball, the problem with when you want to

[57:51] make one game and sell a thousand or two and you're small and you're only making that

[57:57] game on the line.

[57:58] And it's like, then you're only making Houdini's for like two years.

[58:02] And games lose their luster pretty quickly now because there's so many new games getting

[58:08] announced.

[58:09] It feels like every like few months.

[58:11] It's just hard to keep the sales going, but you've tooled up for, you know, a couple

[58:17] of your production runs.

[58:18] So, what's announced at what time?

[58:22] You know, Houdini, there's a lot of fans.

[58:24] If you're doing this, a lot of magic fans out there.

[58:27] If Guardians of the Galaxy was announced and it was a fantastic game, you know, that would

[58:35] definitely pull sales away from Houdini.

[58:37] I mean, you're always going to get like I said, you're always going to get the magic fans

[58:40] or whatever.

[58:41] But you know, whenever you go with the man, I understand why they do it.

[58:45] But whenever you're going with the major licenses, it's really tough to beat.

[58:50] I mean, there's a lot of Guardians of the Galaxy fans.

[58:53] Oh yeah, I mean, I would say it's on par with the popularity of Star Wars right now.

[59:00] I mean, Star Wars is always bigger, of course, but it has millions and millions and millions

[59:04] of fans.

[59:05] And I think a lot of pinball fans also love Guardians.

[59:08] You know, it's like when you find that overlap or it's not just like, it's a big theme,

[59:12] but like fast and furious, huge theme, millions of fans, but that's not really the pinball

[59:17] crowd.

[59:18] You know, same with some other big franchises out there that doesn't really overlap with

[59:22] pinball very well, but I think Guardians and pinball overlap extremely nicely.

[59:26] So let me talk about another pin that you always talk about that we that never seems to be

[59:30] able to actually get on a ship and land at port, which is aliens.

[59:37] Do you think alien pinball, like what's your thoughts?

[59:42] Because they're supposed to go to Expo.

[59:44] We're going to see it again.

[59:47] And do you think the game's going to finally play better than the version we encountered

[59:51] at Allentown?

[59:52] Yes, without a doubt.

[59:54] They have to.

[59:55] Otherwise, it will sink the company.

[59:56] The game I played with Allentown was, I didn't want to say it, but it was horrible.

[01:00:01] I mean, the upkicker didn't work.

[01:00:04] And the ball had to be tried about six or seven times before we didn't get the ball

[01:00:08] up there.

[01:00:09] The Xenohead didn't work.

[01:00:11] So I mean, you were shooting around doing what?

[01:00:13] I mean, there was nothing there to do.

[01:00:16] The main things you wanted to see didn't work.

[01:00:19] So for that, it was just very…

[01:00:24] But the game has potential.

[01:00:25] It's a growl game for many people.

[01:00:26] It will be one for me.

[01:00:28] I can see myself having one possibly in the future, but I'd have to see them working

[01:00:32] perfectly and feel that the company is going to be there to survive.

[01:00:37] Whether they're shipping games or not, I don't know.

[01:00:39] Like I said, on the side, I want to know the tracking number.

[01:00:45] It's like my friends do a lot of shipping of different things around the world, and

[01:00:50] they get the tracking and they can track the ships, they can track everything.

[01:00:54] So…

[01:00:55] Yeah, but for guy like you, Ted, just order from CoinTaker when they actually have it

[01:00:58] in a box and go get it.

[01:01:01] Where's the tracking number?

[01:01:02] That's all we got to know.

[01:01:03] What tracking from England or the tracking from…

[01:01:06] The tracking from…

[01:01:07] Pennsylvania.

[01:01:08] The alien is coming to CoinTaker.

[01:01:10] They give you a tracking and you can track that ship exactly where it is on the ocean

[01:01:15] and when it comes right into Portport.

[01:01:17] Right.

[01:01:18] Yeah.

[01:01:19] I've got that yet.

[01:01:20] Well, here's the thing.

[01:01:21] Ultimately, for this company to succeed, they have to be able to make a lot of them.

[01:01:25] They're in that big factory.

[01:01:27] It needs to come to a point where like a container with like 50 or 100 or 200 is like

[01:01:35] arriving in the States to satiate the past orders and the current demand.

[01:01:41] When I hear like, oh, 21 are coming over, I'm like, what the hell have these guys been

[01:01:47] doing to June?

[01:01:48] Like, it was like, well, first of all, how many do you think have been ordered in Payton?

[01:01:52] They've already been bought.

[01:01:53] All those have already been bought.

[01:01:54] No, but how many do you think that…

[01:01:57] Oh, how many orders do they get in total?

[01:02:01] Yeah.

[01:02:02] Of alien?

[01:02:03] I would say like, at the peak, Andrew probably had 750 to 1000 people with like,

[01:02:11] some sort of deposit down.

[01:02:13] Really?

[01:02:14] Okay.

[01:02:15] I wouldn't have thought it was out of high, but okay.

[01:02:17] Well, 750, you know, remember, he was selling like, you know, now that I say it out loud,

[01:02:23] I mean, maybe closer to 500, right?

[01:02:25] I mean…

[01:02:26] I wouldn't even guess it.

[01:02:27] Lugwer.

[01:02:28] First of all, I think like we've talked about before, a lot of people don't even know

[01:02:34] pinball exists.

[01:02:35] Then you go into the people that do know pinball exists.

[01:02:37] Then you go into the people that are on the sites like pinside or the people that buy

[01:02:42] pinballs actively.

[01:02:44] And the number keeps getting lower and lower and lower.

[01:02:46] So that someone makes an announcement like, when I would tell my friends, oh, I'm getting

[01:02:51] a pinball machine.

[01:02:52] Pinball still exists?

[01:02:53] Yeah.

[01:02:54] I'm getting alien.

[01:02:55] They're making an alien pinball.

[01:02:56] Nobody even knows this stuff.

[01:02:59] The amount of people that really knows that there's an alien pinball machine being produced

[01:03:04] is so minuscule, it's ridiculous.

[01:03:08] So you're right.

[01:03:09] You're right.

[01:03:10] You know, it might be for the thousand.

[01:03:11] I think the number is a couple hundred.

[01:03:15] You're probably, it's probably more accurate.

[01:03:18] You know, I get jaded because I just always see like Stern can sell like 800 Star Wars

[01:03:23] LEDs pretty immediately, right?

[01:03:25] And it's like sold out in like a few weeks where, but it's a real game, right?

[01:03:31] It's in box.

[01:03:32] People have no fear.

[01:03:33] They're going to get those Stern machine.

[01:03:35] Like I think highway pinball, this ordered one from coin taker a few weeks ago and he's

[01:03:40] getting it.

[01:03:41] Yeah.

[01:03:42] The whole thing of my number, how you can cut the line and what order you'll be in.

[01:03:48] You can get one in coming in on a shipment of 25.

[01:03:51] And there's dudes who like bought the bought them from Andrew right before he stepped down

[01:03:57] who are still waiting for the replacement parts, right?

[01:04:01] And they're not getting anything yet.

[01:04:03] So like I think my hunch on highway, my prediction spin, they'll be at expo.

[01:04:09] The code is running 1.02.

[01:04:12] It's pretty far along.

[01:04:14] I just don't think this game will ever be able to recapture people's imagination.

[01:04:20] I think it feels like an old game by now.

[01:04:23] I think people are sort of soured on it and they're not really going to run after

[01:04:31] it.

[01:04:32] I'm glad it's coming out.

[01:04:33] I hope everyone who paid for it gets it.

[01:04:35] It's only going to be the growl people that are going to really, really be interested.

[01:04:39] And look, for me, I figured I was getting an alien game one way or the other because that

[01:04:45] for me would be a phenomenal thing.

[01:04:48] I wish someone would ship and play it or whatever.

[01:04:51] I just said I'm just going to wait till this whole thing plays out before I even think

[01:04:54] about it.

[01:04:55] And the license expires on alien pinball for highway.

[01:05:01] Another manufacturer should make another version of it with Geiger artwork or Geiger artwork

[01:05:08] and really do it justice.

[01:05:10] I just don't think this game.

[01:05:13] Look, I think one of the main reasons why Andrew never sold out, I just don't think

[01:05:18] the game brings that alien world to life.

[01:05:21] It doesn't have freaking Sigourney Weaver in it.

[01:05:23] People are never going to get over that.

[01:05:25] They just never will.

[01:05:26] The game showed up at venues where people got to play it and everybody that played it

[01:05:34] went away with a band taste of them out because nothing worked.

[01:05:38] Including me.

[01:05:39] But even when you work, the shots and toys aren't there in that game.

[01:05:46] They're just not.

[01:05:47] If you take away the Xenohead which doesn't even interact with the ball really other than

[01:05:52] grabbing it, that's interesting.

[01:05:56] Even like the way the Xenohead works is silly.

[01:06:02] You want the side profile of the head with the tongue coming out.

[01:06:07] It just makes absolutely no sense that it's head on with you.

[01:06:11] But anyway.

[01:06:12] Well, a number of people played it.

[01:06:15] They like it.

[01:06:16] I hope it works out good.

[01:06:17] I hope they iron out the bugs.

[01:06:18] I hope everybody gets their games.

[01:06:20] I hope everybody gets their full throttle.

[01:06:22] I hope everybody gets their parts to the games they already have.

[01:06:26] And it works out good.

[01:06:28] And that's it.

[01:06:29] It's just another pinball game that a small amount of people are going to be buying.

[01:06:35] I hope it all works out.

[01:06:38] Well, my prediction is this company will have to show a new game soon.

[01:06:44] If they were smart, they would listen to me because I do marketing.

[01:06:47] I'm just the smartest marketer out there.

[01:06:49] But I'm being so much more suspicious.

[01:06:51] They should change the name of the company.

[01:06:54] It's no longer Andrew Highway's company.

[01:06:56] His vision was a failure.

[01:06:58] I think they should go back to standard cabinets that look much better and have the full

[01:07:01] art packages on the cabinets and get away with all those.

[01:07:04] The silly little design decisions Andrew made have standard back boxes that look better

[01:07:09] when they're lined up with other games.

[01:07:12] Make this company follow in the footsteps of what works and then make the improvements

[01:07:17] that will make the games better.

[01:07:18] But I think Andrew's vision is just never going to sell a lot of products.

[01:07:22] But anyway, let's go to Dutch.

[01:07:24] Does Dutch make it?

[01:07:25] So they're supposed to bring a game to action.

[01:07:27] They are.

[01:07:28] I mean, you know, I really know it's the new game or no game.

[01:07:33] Leaving what these people say because I don't know whether to full a shit or not.

[01:07:37] So I don't know.

[01:07:38] So I have to go back with the saying it's fine.

[01:07:40] They say they have a new general contractor.

[01:07:44] They said they're making games.

[01:07:45] They say they're going to be ready in a certain time.

[01:07:48] Until it doesn't happen, I have to go buy it because I really don't know.

[01:07:53] But Ted, they already lied once, right?

[01:07:56] They all lie.

[01:07:57] They all lie.

[01:07:58] Okay.

[01:07:59] Okay.

[01:08:00] So I love someone of Ted's or there's like this desire to have this positive revisionist

[01:08:06] history of all these companies.

[01:08:07] But they lied about it.

[01:08:08] No, they're just a positive revisionist.

[01:08:11] It's that we can sit here and piss.

[01:08:14] I can get ramble about this shit forever and so could we.

[01:08:17] But we don't know.

[01:08:18] Oh, but here's the thing.

[01:08:19] I'm just going to do.

[01:08:20] They're going to have pinball machines delivered to people by the end of this year or beginning

[01:08:25] next or they're full of shit and not.

[01:08:27] Okay.

[01:08:28] But we don't really know until it happens.

[01:08:30] So I think we're Ted and I differs.

[01:08:33] I think we could probably universally apply to every manufacturer out there.

[01:08:38] Ted's belief that he just hopes it works out.

[01:08:40] And then he's like, no, not just the hopes is that we don't know.

[01:08:45] We're guessing.

[01:08:46] Exactly.

[01:08:47] This is a prediction.

[01:08:48] Okay.

[01:08:49] This is our prediction.

[01:08:50] So we're predicting what we think is going to happen.

[01:08:52] Of course, a prediction is a fancier word than of guessing, right?

[01:08:57] Yes.

[01:08:58] So my prediction is, do you think the driveway, I would predict that they're going to make

[01:09:03] something?

[01:09:04] They're going to make something.

[01:09:06] I predicted they will.

[01:09:07] I didn't change something.

[01:09:08] I don't know.

[01:09:09] But I think that they're going to try to come up with it with a machine.

[01:09:12] I mean, either that or just the biggest bullsh**ters in the world.

[01:09:16] I mean, they say they got a contractor that has dough.

[01:09:19] They say they're designing boards.

[01:09:20] They say they're going to have games at a certain time.

[01:09:23] Either they're totally full of shit or they're going to come out with a game.

[01:09:27] So you know, this guy said, look, they've done a good job of becoming the burdener

[01:09:31] and the pinball world over the last year.

[01:09:34] I hope they make it.

[01:09:36] I do because I think the game is special and people deserve to be made.

[01:09:40] I would love to see their take on another game.

[01:09:43] But I just think these guys are like, again, they've lost so much credibility.

[01:09:47] But here's what I do.

[01:09:48] Particle happen.

[01:09:49] They will go to Expo when they really have no right to be there because whatever money,

[01:09:55] it costs them to go there.

[01:09:57] That money should be going to refunding people who have asked for refunds.

[01:10:02] So I think it's an adridious move to go and spend money.

[01:10:05] I also think to your point, Ted, who doesn't know about the big la Vasty who knows pinball?

[01:10:11] Everybody does.

[01:10:13] They need to put the game in a box.

[01:10:14] I don't want to hear Yop on the mic again, using the English language as an excuse why

[01:10:22] he didn't know something.

[01:10:24] Just make the fucking game now, guys.

[01:10:26] You went from having the penthouse, you were rock stars.

[01:10:30] Now it's like three years later and it's still like square one again.

[01:10:35] Yeah.

[01:10:36] Well, you know, this comes down to the same thing as the pop-a-dew thing.

[01:10:42] It's like these people paid their money.

[01:10:44] They're getting nothing.

[01:10:45] If they get something, it's great.

[01:10:49] You know, so-

[01:10:50] Do you think they need to go to Expo though, Ted?

[01:10:51] Like what's the game by then going to Expo?

[01:10:54] What?

[01:10:55] Why are they coming to Chicago in two weeks or a week to say what?

[01:11:00] Well, you still have to promote and you still have to promote.

[01:11:05] Promote what?

[01:11:06] Everyone knows the game.

[01:11:08] How close?

[01:11:09] You want them to sit there and make games and get them out.

[01:11:11] But from their point of view, they're looking at this as a company that they have to go

[01:11:14] beyond what they have right now and even have to sell even more.

[01:11:18] So they're going out there and promoting them.

[01:11:20] But that's the thing.

[01:11:21] The reason is there.

[01:11:22] Do you think they're going to take new money on like the new version of Lebowski?

[01:11:26] I don't know.

[01:11:27] What other reason is there for them?

[01:11:29] There's no way.

[01:11:30] Only an idiot would give them a deposit.

[01:11:33] Now people are waiting on refunds.

[01:11:35] There's an audience.

[01:11:36] Yeah, we're all, yeah, I agree.

[01:11:39] Everyone, all they got to do is like show one like read his own board.

[01:11:43] But first of all, a predator or Jayy Papanduches games, you'll find a lot of idiots out there.

[01:11:49] You can put me on the number one on that idiot list as is me.

[01:11:53] You can pre-buy, you bought F-d.

[01:11:57] I saw a cab and empty cab and then I bought it.

[01:12:02] Luke is still probably selling it again to make some money.

[01:12:04] Yeah, a few grand here and there maybe.

[01:12:07] I'm trying to think anything else.

[01:12:08] I'm trying to think any company we're missing.

[01:12:09] So Spooky's not going to be at Expo.

[01:12:13] Spooky's game will be at the Pimbal Life Party.

[01:12:16] So something unique about Expo Ted is like there's Expo that takes place in Chicago.

[01:12:22] I think it's at the Weston Hotel.

[01:12:24] And then Pimbal Life throws like its own party.

[01:12:28] That's like 40 minutes away.

[01:12:30] It's always a little like annoying because the Pimbal Life thing is sometimes a lot better.

[01:12:36] And so you go to Expo and then you end up just leaving for the day to go somewhere else.

[01:12:42] There's a lot of controversy with Expo and how Mike runs that show.

[01:12:47] It's, you know, I get it.

[01:12:49] He gets stressed out.

[01:12:50] He yells at people.

[01:12:51] He treats some of the vendors and volunteers poorly.

[01:12:54] But his son is working on it this year.

[01:12:56] So hopefully it'll be a more positive vibe.

[01:13:00] But yeah, one of these times I'd like to go to one of these big shows.

[01:13:03] Go to T.P.F.

[01:13:04] Go to T.P.F.

[01:13:06] That's the best show.

[01:13:09] Not this year, but maybe next.

[01:13:11] Why not?

[01:13:12] A bunch of people ago, you know, we'll all go together, you know, from over there.

[01:13:16] We'll drive the demon down.

[01:13:17] We'll pop a fucking wheelie all the way down to Texas.

[01:13:19] There's some deluge because that's, but that's a hell of a trip.

[01:13:24] I mean, that that's a major situation.

[01:13:26] And again, like I've explained a half a dozen times before, you know, pinball is just one

[01:13:31] of a dozen, you know, hobbies I have.

[01:13:34] And it's definitely not one of the top five.

[01:13:37] So you know, for me to make the plans and hop on a plane and go down there and stay, even

[01:13:43] when I go to Allentown, I go down in there, I play games for an hour and I'm looking

[01:13:48] at you to buy something and get the help to a bar or have something to eat and I'm

[01:13:52] going to hell out there.

[01:13:53] I told you to, like, everything that you can play at T.P.F.

[01:13:59] will be at Allentown.

[01:14:00] It's like, there's just no, yeah, there is no need to go to all these shows.

[01:14:05] You're not like entering all these different tournaments.

[01:14:07] It's to go to hang out with the people.

[01:14:09] And I go, I love going to T.P.F.

[01:14:11] because I get to hang with a bunch of my friends from, from that area.

[01:14:15] I don't get to see the most.

[01:14:16] In Texas?

[01:14:17] Huh?

[01:14:18] Do they have to kill it in Texas?

[01:14:19] Of course they've got to kill it in Texas.

[01:14:21] OK, I'm in.

[01:14:22] You're in.

[01:14:23] We'll go.

[01:14:24] We'll fight first class in a couple of ballers.

[01:14:26] We'll get, we'll get, we'll get someone to sponsor.

[01:14:29] Canada's pinball podcast going down there.

[01:14:31] You'll be part of the entourage.

[01:14:33] You'll be in my writer list.

[01:14:34] That's what we need.

[01:14:36] Yeah.

[01:14:37] That's a good idea because now I know this podcast has been, is listening to by like,

[01:14:41] like dozens of people now, right?

[01:14:43] There's at least like 50 people in my mom who listens to this show every week.

[01:14:48] And then I just, I delete cookies and refresh, listen to it about 900 times.

[01:14:53] So you get the listens to over a thousand.

[01:14:56] So we're all good guys.

[01:14:58] We got this.

[01:14:59] Well, tell, I think that's, you know, we're a little bit over an hour.

[01:15:01] I think that's a good prediction for the show.

[01:15:04] My final prediction is I think Jersey Jack is going to run away with this one and

[01:15:09] be the most talked about game from the show.

[01:15:12] I think Stern is going to hold back Guardians until November.

[01:15:21] And I think it doesn't matter because we're not going to, pirates is not going to be built

[01:15:25] for six months.

[01:15:27] So those two games are going to, they're going to battle it out.

[01:15:32] And it's going to be interesting.

[01:15:34] It's going to, it's going to, like I said, the next few years is going to be very interesting

[01:15:38] with pinball because, you know, besides all the, you know, the rumored new games coming

[01:15:43] out, the new companies coming out and this, that's going to be interesting to see who's

[01:15:47] going to stick around, you know, like American pinball, they've got some dough they seem to

[01:15:52] know what they're doing, who's going to fold by the wayside.

[01:15:55] You know, it's going to be a very interesting few years, you know, coming up because nobody

[01:16:01] knows what they're doing until they actually are putting games in boxes and selling them

[01:16:06] though.

[01:16:07] My wish for all these manufacturers out there is to really just figure this shit out first

[01:16:14] before you reveal your plans to the world.

[01:16:16] And I think that's always the big head scratcher for me.

[01:16:19] This whole industry, Ted, is people are too quick to kind of show their product half

[01:16:25] bait and to actually manufacture a pinball machine and make it quality and mass produce it,

[01:16:34] not easy.

[01:16:36] But if you have money, don't tell me you did it until you got a hundred in box.

[01:16:40] Yeah, well, you know, they get excited, they want to release the, well, you see the

[01:16:47] thing is it depends on to when you do what's, the stuff is coming out.

[01:16:51] If you know, let's say the biggest game in the world that's going to be coming out is

[01:16:55] going to be Star Wars.

[01:16:56] And now you're going to be listing, when are you going to announce your game?

[01:17:00] You know, and you have a game that's a minor game or you have a game that's going to

[01:17:05] be released in the middle of some smaller games like you know, the Jetsons is coming out

[01:17:10] and and Houdini is coming out of whatever.

[01:17:13] Now you think you can come in there and really zing somebody.

[01:17:16] You want to make that announcement so people will say, whoa, I want jaws or whatever it is.

[01:17:21] So I'm not going to spend money for Jetsons.

[01:17:23] I'm not going to buy parties of the galaxy.

[01:17:26] I'm not going to buy Alice Cooper.

[01:17:28] I'm not going to buy Monster Bash.

[01:17:31] I, jaws is my grip.

[01:17:32] I'm saving up my money for that because you know, there's a lot of people out there

[01:17:35] who don't have the 20, 30, 40 grand a year like a pump into these games that don't buy

[01:17:42] one game a year or one game every two years or whatever.

[01:17:45] So they've got to really watch what they buy.

[01:17:47] So one pick it up announcement of a game can really hear you know, but here's the thing.

[01:17:53] And and there just has never been one single example of that ever working for any of these

[01:18:01] boutique companies.

[01:18:03] Every single boutique that showed earlier announced early failed to deliver.

[01:18:10] Every single one, Zidware failed, Predator failed, Alien failed, Bigelbaus keep failed.

[01:18:17] These are all the games that they, they wowed as early on and then they didn't get the

[01:18:22] games in production.

[01:18:23] The only one who was able to do it was spooky.

[01:18:25] I mean, even Jack failed.

[01:18:27] It took him three years to get walls and hobbit out respectively.

[01:18:31] So I mean, now that people know this, if you, if the game's in a box, it will sell.

[01:18:38] It'll sell 200 of fucking anything that's done.

[01:18:42] You will.

[01:18:43] Then I want to see what this, this, this, this nuclear annihilation of what it's called

[01:18:51] is about because I've watched the videos of it and I don't get it.

[01:18:56] But they say you have to play it.

[01:18:59] So so what a novel concept that is.

[01:19:02] I'm just really looking to play this game because people play it say it's phenomenal, but

[01:19:08] watching it, it just looks okay.

[01:19:12] So so this is a game I'm, I'd be very interested in actually playing and I'm sure there'll be

[01:19:17] one at the Alan town.

[01:19:18] When is Alan town coming up this year?

[01:19:20] I'm actually watching most pinballs boring as fuck.

[01:19:23] It's beyond as I mean, it's when you're on the machine where like you really either get

[01:19:27] the energy or like you kind of don't.

[01:19:31] So Ted, I appreciate you taking something rough to stuff.

[01:19:34] Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time.

[01:19:36] You're going to obviously be seeing what happens at the show.

[01:19:40] I will be when this occurs, I will be in London, England.

[01:19:45] Brendan and I are leaving for Greece tomorrow.

[01:19:47] So I want to announce to the listeners of the show, you're going to get a hiatus.

[01:19:51] Brendan and I, we got engaged on Saturday night.

[01:19:55] What?

[01:19:56] Yeah.

[01:19:57] Holy shit.

[01:19:58] Yeah.

[01:19:59] I did not know that.

[01:20:01] Yeah, it was, I popped the question.

[01:20:03] I said, well, you marry me and do you know how to fix magic girl?

[01:20:11] And she said yes and no.

[01:20:15] And so no, we're excited.

[01:20:17] We have a lot of a lot going on in our lives between Renovation and the show.

[01:20:21] Congratulations.

[01:20:22] This is this is very, very interesting news.

[01:20:24] Thank you.

[01:20:25] She's a, she's a keeper.

[01:20:27] So we're going to go celebrate.

[01:20:28] I was going to do, I was going to pop the question in in Greece, but I didn't want to do it.

[01:20:32] And there I didn't want to go through airports with Ring.

[01:20:35] I didn't want to do all that stuff.

[01:20:36] So we found the right moment.

[01:20:39] And now we can just enjoy ourselves.

[01:20:40] We're going to be hanging with her family in London as well to celebrate.

[01:20:43] So all of you out there, I know you, some of you are just sick of my podcast.

[01:20:47] You're going to get a nice break for about 10 days.

[01:20:50] So I think people, they don't say it, but a lot of people enjoy the podcast.

[01:20:55] That's what I've been hearing.

[01:20:56] So not over in Australia here, like a lot of people are sick.

[01:21:01] Well, the main thing is, congratulations.

[01:21:04] This is great.

[01:21:05] Thank you.

[01:21:06] Let's get the four of us together.

[01:21:07] We're going to pour to househouse some cigars and drinks and do a little celebration.

[01:21:10] We will leave into a live podcast right there with the four of us.

[01:21:14] Can you imagine how ridiculously horrible that would be?

[01:21:18] No, it would be better than Star Wars pinball.

[01:21:24] Ted, I appreciate it.

[01:21:25] And guys out there, we will speak to you soon.

[01:21:27] I can't, who knows?

[01:21:29] I may get one up in your, I'm not even going to ring my mic.

[01:21:32] Where this is a celebratory vacation.

[01:21:34] I need, I need a break too.

[01:21:35] I think you guys can sense it too.

[01:21:37] I need to break every once in a while.

[01:21:38] So Ted, we'll talk to you soon and have a great hiatus, ladies and gentlemen, from the

[01:21:45] podcast.

[01:21:46] Enjoy X-Bell.

[01:21:47] I think you guys are going to enjoy all the news and the reveals and let's try and focus

[01:21:53] on the more positive aspects.

[01:21:54] But I will nuke the people that step out of line.

[01:21:57] You know that's why you listen to this podcast.

[01:22:00] And in the meantime, go over, listen to my friend Ryan and Marty over there in Australia.

[01:22:05] I do love their head-to-head pinball podcast.

[01:22:08] It's a good, it's a good counterweight to this one.

[01:22:11] I think if you listen to those two shows, you'll have all your bases covered.

[01:22:14] So check them out and head-to-head pinball and we'll talk to you guys in a little over

[01:22:19] 10 days.

[01:22:20] Okay, have fun.

[01:22:21] Enjoy your fishing chips.

[01:22:23] Congratulations.

[01:22:24] Let's get together soon.

[01:22:26] I'm happy for you.

[01:22:27] Thanks, Ted.

[01:22:28] And thanks everyone.

[01:22:29] I'll talk to you soon.
