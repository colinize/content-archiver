[00:00] You wanna know why?

[00:03] Cause I'm a liar!

[00:06] Yeah, I'm a liar!

[00:09] I'll tear your mind out, I'll burn your soul!

[00:14] Sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a, sit-a!

[00:18] Uh-oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the only Pinball Podcast headquartered now in Dubai, Pennsylvania!

[00:28] Look, if you don't have a pinball operation happening in Dubai, Pennsylvania, do you even have a pinball company?

[00:36] We're gonna talk about the pinball brothers!

[00:39] Did these dudes make predator?

[00:42] Or did they make true lies?

[00:45] They're starting to say stuff that just ain't addin' up, and you know me.

[00:50] I'm not the other pinball content creators who say everything is awesome, given every game of B+.

[00:57] I've always called these companies like I see it, and I'm starting to see some cracks in the armor.

[01:03] I'm starting to see some stuff that would make me nervous about sending money.

[01:09] Oh, all of a sudden these guys are just gonna pay tariffs?

[01:12] All of a sudden these guys are paying shipping?

[01:14] Are these guys gonna solve the problem in the Gaza Strip?

[01:17] Are they gonna be in peace?

[01:19] Bring some peace to the Ukraine!

[01:21] This show is live on Facebook right now.

[01:24] They can see no editing.

[01:26] This is just pure, under the surface, coffee fueled, Canadian talent.

[01:32] We're gonna talk about the pinball brothers.

[01:34] We're gonna talk about Stern Pinball, now we'd love to sell you a power supply that will fix the loud fan in all of those Stern games.

[01:45] So now you've got to spend more money to change something that should have been the right part in the first place.

[01:53] Don't you love it when companies do this?

[01:55] We cut corners, we passed on to our consumers something inferior, and now you have to pay to replace it.

[02:04] It almost reminds me of like the power supplies and spooky were loud, the spooky monitors were so cheap.

[02:10] How many of you bought a spooky game and all the blacks were washed out and you had to go buy like a, I don't know, like a $50 monitor, $80 monitor to make it so the contrast was good?

[02:22] Why can't these companies just give us the best stuff from the factory?

[02:27] It's a lot more annoying to have to buy it again.

[02:30] So once again, Stern Pinball, $300 power supply.

[02:35] I think what annoys me about the photo of the power supply is the photo itself, like the wires are hanging down.

[02:43] It's almost like George and Seth were like, what are we gonna do?

[02:47] Nobody wants King Kong.

[02:49] All of our efforts to take these arcade one up content creators to help us hype King Kong have failed.

[02:58] And you know the reason why none of us will ever really truly respect arcade one up content creators.

[03:06] You know the reason why and you know the reason why is simply this because anyone who was really into arcades as a kid,

[03:14] none of us who knew what arcades were all about would ever in a million years buy an arcade one up.

[03:24] We wouldn't collect them.

[03:26] We wouldn't build a community around these freaking fake little mini versions of what arcades were and nobody who's really into arcades would ever be caught dead playing a classic arcade game on an arcade cabinet.

[03:44] That's got an LCD screen.

[03:46] It's got to be a CRT or bust.

[03:49] And you know what's funny is the arcade one up scene is dead.

[03:52] You know why?

[03:53] Because all those dudes who collected all of those games, they got made fun of by you and I.

[04:00] Everyone who really gets where it's at is like, yeah, only a fool would buy and collect arcade one up games.

[04:08] And so they all got made fun of and now none of them want to buy them anymore because when you say you bought one,

[04:13] it's like buying a haggis game or a home pin game.

[04:16] And so yeah, don't march into our pinball space.

[04:20] Take the stern dollars, become stern shills and then tell us that you're now the voice of pinball.

[04:27] You got to earn it back.

[04:29] And the only way you're going to earn it back is if you call it like you see it.

[04:35] You don't suck on the T E E T of every single game a manufacturer puts out.

[04:41] King Kong is a failure.

[04:43] You got to say it.

[04:44] You got to say you can't go buy a Kong L E.

[04:47] If you're going to guide the pinball community, you can't go buy a Kong L E.

[04:52] You got to do what canada does buy it one.

[04:55] It's eight grand and I mean the L E.

[04:58] Nobody wants the game.

[05:00] I think they finally sold that new in a box game for $10,400.

[05:06] Think about that for a minute.

[05:08] It took a dude like three weeks to sell a Kong in a box for 10,4.

[05:16] So what do you think your opened game is worth now that you've beat on it?

[05:22] Uh, I don't know, 9,500.

[05:25] What do you think it's going to be worth after Star Wars?

[05:28] What do you think it's going to be worth after like Pokemon?

[05:31] You know what I'm saying?

[05:32] It's like, and here's the thing.

[05:34] Stern's about to increase their prices and it's going to work for Star Wars.

[05:39] And we're going to get to pinball brothers.

[05:41] We're going to talk all about the pinball brothers and Du Bois, Pennsylvania,

[05:45] which is all of a sudden the hottest place to be in pinball.

[05:50] I feel like I'm hyped.

[05:51] If you're listening to this on the podcast only, you're missing the Facebook live

[05:57] happening right now.

[05:58] And you can see how I get more performative when I'm looking at myself.

[06:02] I actually like doing it this way because I almost feel like I don't need to edit.

[06:06] You haven't even made a real mistake yet.

[06:08] You're like, Canadian made the mistake.

[06:11] You've now triggered all of these arcade one up guys who say they're the voice of pinball.

[06:16] And then you ask for their forgiveness.

[06:18] Look, it's just this simple.

[06:20] The easiest thing to do is just tell the truth.

[06:24] Tell the truth about how you feel about a game and every game can't be awesome.

[06:30] Because if you say that, it's not interesting and we're never going to get to better product.

[06:35] And I think it's hard for the newbies.

[06:37] I do because I think they came into the hobby.

[06:39] Prices were high.

[06:40] They were born.

[06:41] They were like bored.

[06:43] See, I made a few mistakes.

[06:43] I'm going to keep the mistakes in here.

[06:45] They were just bored during COVID and I get it.

[06:48] We all were.

[06:50] We were all looking at the world like what's going on.

[06:53] Everything's shutting down.

[06:55] People are dying.

[06:56] I'm spending most of my time at home.

[06:58] I'm not going on vacations.

[07:00] I'm not eating out.

[07:01] So I've got all this extra money and then all of a sudden the jackass that bought a stranger things,

[07:09] LE for $8,500.

[07:11] All of a sudden that jackass listed his game for sale for $19,000.

[07:18] And look, it would have been okay if it stopped there.

[07:22] But here's the problem.

[07:24] Another jackass bought the game for $18,500.

[07:29] And then all the other stranger thing owners felt they also had a game that was now worth $18,000.

[07:35] And so we went through this three year period of any man who had any sort of means and money

[07:41] that wasn't spending it on normal grown adult purchases started to look at pinball like

[07:47] this is the best place to put my money.

[07:50] I'm going to have so much fun and these things are never going to go down in value.

[07:55] Go look at the people who bought Snoopy Omega watches during COVID.

[07:59] You think pinball is bad.

[08:01] People were spending $35,000 on an unlimited run of a watch that retails for like 16.

[08:10] Okay, so it's not just us.

[08:13] So here we are.

[08:14] It's 2025.

[08:16] It's August.

[08:17] And I'm here to tell you right now.

[08:19] I think a few things are about to happen.

[08:21] I think the pinball brothers are going down a road that we've seen before.

[08:25] I'm going to talk about it.

[08:27] And I think they're saying stuff and I think you have to read between the lines.

[08:32] And again, when a company makes a statement like they just made and makes a marketing

[08:37] move like they just made, you can't just look at it in isolation.

[08:42] You have to look at it outside of the statement.

[08:45] You have to remember what they said about this game when it was launched.

[08:51] You have to remember how many they said they were going to make.

[08:54] And then you need to remember that.

[08:56] Don't be like these short term revisionist history shills who are just like, oh, cool.

[09:02] Great.

[09:02] Yeah, they only have 150 left.

[09:04] No, that is not accurate.

[09:06] We're going to talk about that.

[09:08] And then we're going to talk about the fact that now all of a sudden they're going to

[09:12] wave tariffs, which is kind of now throwing a light on Dutch pinball because everyone's

[09:18] like, well, what about us?

[09:20] How come you're not paying for the tariffs like Melvin and Barry?

[09:23] Why do we have to pay for the tariffs?

[09:25] I say we just ship every single pinball machine in 2025.

[09:30] I don't care if it's coming from the Netherlands.

[09:32] I don't care if it's coming from freaking the pinball brothers in Italy or the UK,

[09:37] wherever the heck they're making that game.

[09:39] I don't care if it's coming from Stern.

[09:41] I don't care if it's coming from Texas.

[09:43] Every single pinball machine that leaves a factory in 2025 should go through Du Bois,

[09:53] Pennsylvania.

[09:54] We should make this place this like whatever this little mailbox sort of shipping container

[10:01] thing they have.

[10:02] We should make Du Bois, Pennsylvania the capital of pinball in 2025.

[10:09] I've already changed my headquarters from Roate in Connecticut to Du Bois, Pennsylvania

[10:16] official today.

[10:18] All right.

[10:19] Let's go into this for a minute because then we'll get to like Star Wars and people want

[10:23] to know what I think the next Star Wars is going to be and how it's going to impact the

[10:28] 2017 prices.

[10:29] Do you really need me to tell you that a brand new Star Wars game that is not a turd like

[10:37] the, and I know that's like really mean, but come on, like the Richie game is a joke.

[10:43] It's got a tie fighter on a spring.

[10:45] The hyperdrive is impossible to get into.

[10:48] It's not even like a major element in the movies.

[10:51] And then there's nothing else in the game.

[10:54] There's no magnets in Star Wars.

[10:56] The fact that anyone even bought that game and then the stupid topper is like the cheapest

[11:03] piece of crap I've ever seen and idiots were spending like 3000 over on it.

[11:10] So if I feel like I've got a lot of aversion and I don't know vitriol around that game,

[11:16] yeah, because I love Star Wars.

[11:19] And when I see that game, it makes me feel like Steve Richie never even watched a damn

[11:25] Star Wars movie.

[11:27] All right.

[11:28] All right.

[11:29] Shut your mouth about Star Wars.

[11:30] Ken, you don't know what you're talking about.

[11:33] I'm talking back to people on Facebook right now.

[11:35] Star Wars is terrible.

[11:38] And then the way Dwight coded it were like your stacking modes, your stacking scenes

[11:44] from different movies.

[11:46] That is the most idiotic way to code a sci-fi story that is the most famous sci-fi story

[11:53] of all time.

[11:54] I want to feel like Luke going on the journey and I want to feel the moments of those films.

[12:01] I don't want to stack a scene from A New Hope with a scene from Empire Strikes Back to

[12:07] get a multiplier on a TIE fighter on a spring when I'm just slamming the damn lockdown bar

[12:13] button to blow up TIE fighters.

[12:16] It's all wrong.

[12:17] All right.

[12:18] Ken's like, you're wrong.

[12:19] I'm not wrong, Ken.

[12:21] And guess what?

[12:22] You have Star Wars about to lose 40% in value in two weeks.

[12:26] So call me up when you sell your Ali for $8,000.

[12:29] Am I on fire, people?

[12:30] All right.

[12:31] Let's talk about the pinball brothers.

[12:32] I'm not even going to edit this show.

[12:34] If you're going to hear this podcast, this is just Canada unedited.

[12:38] Let's do it.

[12:39] All right.

[12:40] So here's the deal.

[12:41] I want to read what the pinball brothers wrote to their distributors.

[12:44] They wrote, we are now building the first games of Predator.

[12:48] We are waiting for the last parts that unfortunately are stuck in customs at the moment.

[12:54] So right there, we know as a community that you can't start building a game until every

[13:02] part is in the factory.

[13:05] So when they say they're starting to build the game and then the next sentence is, we

[13:10] don't even have all the parts.

[13:11] I don't even know why I do this podcast anymore.

[13:14] Like what is with these companies?

[13:16] Who would ever say this?

[13:18] Like we know every part needs to be in-house.

[13:21] It's an assembly line.

[13:22] A game should be made in a day.

[13:24] You don't want to just build a few things.

[13:25] Hey, let's just put in a few posts and then wait two weeks to get the damn habit trail

[13:30] or the ramps.

[13:31] That's not how you build pinball.

[13:33] All right.

[13:34] Then they go on to say, but we believe the parts will be released very soon and we will

[13:40] start shipping this month.

[13:42] All right.

[13:43] Lies.

[13:44] Lies.

[13:45] Like what does that mean?

[13:46] It is August 15th.

[13:48] They do not even have all the parts to finish a game.

[13:52] They believe the parts will be in very soon and they're going to get games.

[13:57] These people act like a month has like 90 days in it.

[14:02] And here we go again.

[14:03] Like what world do these people live in?

[14:05] All right.

[14:06] Because we all know that no predators are probably going to ship in August.

[14:10] Okay.

[14:11] And they don't even have all the parts.

[14:12] They don't even.

[14:13] Like seriously.

[14:14] Like it's hard enough to ship and build these games if you have all the parts in-house.

[14:18] They go on to say, this is the part where I really am going to go off.

[14:22] Okay.

[14:23] So if you have kids around, I'm not going to curse, but you know, your kids might hear

[14:27] me and be like, dad, what's this guy's so upset about?

[14:29] Like he's screaming about pinball.

[14:31] Like is he okay?

[14:32] Is he getting like action from his wife?

[14:34] Like are his kids beautiful?

[14:35] Does he live in a great house?

[14:37] Does he drive a Dodge Demon dad?

[14:38] What's with this guy?

[14:39] All right.

[14:40] He goes on to say the following.

[14:42] The demand is high for predator.

[14:46] And we just want to inform you that we got approximately 150 games left to sell.

[14:55] We also want to inform you that we will only sell this game until the end of the year.

[15:03] We have restructured our license agreements and need to make space for our new titles.

[15:10] This means that we cannot sell alien and predator after year end.

[15:16] If you want to secure any of these two titles, now is the time to act.

[15:21] I'm going to stay on this paragraph.

[15:23] I am not going to let them stay this stuff and just get away with it.

[15:29] This is not alien.

[15:31] This is not predator.

[15:33] They're making true lies people.

[15:36] This is true lies because when they say demand is high, I want everybody to remember what

[15:42] they said when they announced this game.

[15:45] What did they say?

[15:47] They said they were making 800 predators.

[15:50] They said that is how many they were going to make and then they were going to go from

[15:55] there.

[15:56] So when they say that demand has been really high and there are only 150 spots left, that

[16:04] is them implying if you remember everything and again, don't like turn off the past.

[16:12] Don't call me toxic.

[16:13] I actually like to think and remember and draw conclusions based upon what these companies

[16:19] say.

[16:20] So that means you think they've sold 650 predators.

[16:23] Do you really think that's what's happened?

[16:25] No, it's anything but that.

[16:28] What people know and what I've heard and again, I don't have 100% confirmation on this, but

[16:32] this is what I heard is the rumor.

[16:34] I'll call it that, but I heard they ordered parts for 300 games for the first batch.

[16:41] So the first batch was 300 because remember, Pimbal brothers can't make 1000 games in six

[16:48] months or 800 games in six months and think about it.

[16:51] It's like almost September.

[16:53] So September, October, November, December.

[16:56] So that's a four month production run of predator and then they're calling it quits.

[17:02] You know what that means?

[17:03] It means they didn't sell 600.

[17:05] It means they didn't sell 500.

[17:07] It means they didn't sell 400.

[17:09] The rumor I'm hearing is they sold closer to like 100 to 150.

[17:15] So what that means is there's only 150 so spots left of the initial 300 parts they have coming

[17:23] in.

[17:24] That's it.

[17:25] So when you think about it through that context, that they have the predator license and they

[17:30] couldn't sell more than 300 games on a game that's roughly $15,000.

[17:36] Well, we're going to talk about how now they're going to pay your tariffs.

[17:40] So they leave Arnold out.

[17:43] They make the game.

[17:45] They also, you got to remember this.

[17:47] This is why I'm like, is it predator or true lies?

[17:51] You got to remember that these guys, when the game was revealed, they knew that there was

[17:59] a leaked video that they leaked.

[18:03] This didn't come from anybody else.

[18:05] They made it in-house.

[18:08] They made a video that showcased Arnold Schwarzenegger saying, get to the chopper.

[18:16] Now the new one is like, get to the chopper.

[18:19] Like what?

[18:31] What?

[18:33] They leaked that video out.

[18:35] You have to remember this.

[18:37] They leaked out a video that showed everybody Arnold speaking, Arnold's likeness, Arnold's

[18:44] image.

[18:45] They sent that out and that was doing the rounds at the exact same moment they were

[18:51] taking money from customers and they waited about 48 hours while that order bank was open

[19:00] before they clarified that that clip was not going to be in the game.

[19:06] They did not have permission.

[19:07] Why did they wait?

[19:09] Why didn't they immediately put out a response?

[19:12] Why did that video even get out?

[19:16] Why did they even record it?

[19:19] Not only that, who did they send it to?

[19:21] I would like to know because to me that was calculated deception to get people to order

[19:29] the game and they thought they were pulling a fast one and the reason why I think it was

[19:33] calculated deception is I bet they were thinking this.

[19:37] All right, look.

[19:39] We have Alien.

[19:40] That game when it came out did not feature the main character, Sigourney Weaver and Ripley.

[19:47] We know that everybody knows that.

[19:49] We know that eventually we got the rights to Ripley and then we put her in the Alien

[19:55] game.

[19:56] So let's do this.

[19:58] Let's leak this, show people what the potential might be if we get Arnold and so that way

[20:05] they will order it and think that Predator will have the same type of journey that Alien

[20:12] had.

[20:13] And one day Arnold might make it in and let's keep that door open because as long as we

[20:18] keep that door open, we're going to hook people who have blind optimism.

[20:24] And if you look at it like so much of like the damn modern content, pinball space, it

[20:30] is nothing but blind optimism.

[20:33] I'm a little bit tired of all the people unwilling to just let it go.

[20:38] Now you don't want to let it go.

[20:40] This is what you get.

[20:41] There's only so many times, Canada is going to extend the olive branch, then you're going

[20:44] to get it.

[20:45] Then you're going to get it.

[20:46] If you don't want to be friends and you think you're too good, they're just shaking hands

[20:49] and fine, then take it this way.

[20:51] But my point is this, this whole thing about like you got to get your game now, trying to

[20:57] manufacture this FOMO.

[20:58] It's a lie.

[20:59] There's no FOMO.

[21:01] There's no demand for this game.

[21:03] They didn't sell close to 800 units.

[21:06] And if you buy one, your game is going to like tank in value right away because if there's

[21:11] not even three inner people who want the game now, there's going to be even less than three

[21:16] inner people that want it after Star Wars, after they get their Harry Potter, after they

[21:20] see what's next from JJP, after all this stuff happening.

[21:24] And so look, these guys are in desperation mode.

[21:26] So desperate that they'll pay your tariffs.

[21:29] I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

[21:31] So look at this.

[21:32] They then put out a statement, we eat the bullets and save the crew.

[21:36] Who is the crew?

[21:37] I mean, I don't even know who this is.

[21:39] So we will cover the tariffs and the international shipping to Du Bois, Pennsylvania.

[21:46] So wow.

[21:47] But only if you order through them.

[21:49] See, did you notice that?

[21:51] So now they're screwing over all their dealers and distros.

[21:54] Anyone who sells pinball brothers products, they are now selling against you.

[22:00] Because you think that's a smart move to turn your back on the only people that have been

[22:05] helping you sell games.

[22:07] And here's the other part that makes no sense.

[22:09] Why is it even with the, this is crazy.

[22:12] The game is $11,995 after the tariffs have been paid.

[22:18] Why is this game $12,000 when alien with Ripley in it is like 7,500 bucks or 7,995?

[22:28] I don't understand.

[22:29] Everyone has everything in it and is so much cheaper than predator.

[22:34] And they say the U of tariffs on Europe goods are finally set.

[22:38] The bad news cost are up.

[22:40] The good news were absolutely as much as possibly can covering the tariffs and the increased

[22:45] international shipping costs.

[22:47] So you don't have to.

[22:48] All right, cool.

[22:50] Go out of business doing this.

[22:51] I mean, I don't know how you do this.

[22:54] Getting our games to our U.S. friends is our top priority.

[22:57] And we want them to land on U.S. soil at the most attractive price possible.

[23:02] Starting now, we're offering the predator pinball direct from pinball brothers with

[23:07] international shipping and taxes included.

[23:10] No surprises, no extra fees, just pulse pounding jungle chaos ready for your game room.

[23:17] Now look, I know I've been sort of going off on these guys and these statements.

[23:22] I know they're trying to like, I know what they're trying to do.

[23:25] They're trying to survive.

[23:27] You know, and I want to play a little bit of devil's advocate.

[23:30] I understand they're trying to survive.

[23:33] And I know it's easy for me to put on a podcast microphone and fly off the handle and do these

[23:40] dramatic shows.

[23:41] And I just want to say what's unfortunate about all of this is survival for a pinball

[23:46] company.

[23:47] I told this to Andrew highway.

[23:48] I'll tell this to everybody out there.

[23:51] Every decision you make as your pinball company is in your hands.

[23:56] Your destiny is in your hands.

[23:58] And these gentlemen just made a really bad decision.

[24:01] They took a huge risk.

[24:03] They made a game that needed Arnold.

[24:07] They made a game that needed the main character.

[24:10] And now this game does not have main character energy.

[24:13] And it's fine, but it's not worth anywhere near the price.

[24:17] And it just can't be competitive.

[24:19] And remember with the tariffs, this game is like $15,000 to your door.

[24:24] Even without the tariffs, it's a $12,000 game without Arnold.

[24:30] It's not like it's loaded with mechanical magic.

[24:32] And so they just shouldn't have made it.

[24:35] And now they know that that's why they're putting out this statement.

[24:39] They've got to get past it.

[24:41] They realize that the risk did not pay off.

[24:44] And when they say stuff like we're only going to make these games to the end of the year

[24:48] because we want to move on to our other titles, where have we heard that before?

[24:53] We hear that from every single pinball company that finds themselves in dire straits.

[25:00] The only way for their egos to recover is to say stuff like they've got so many more games coming.

[25:08] We've heard it from Damian, from Robert Mueller, from John Papadou, from Andrew Highway.

[25:15] This is how these guys have to think.

[25:17] It's all about survival.

[25:19] And in their minds, the only way to survive is to get people excited about the next thing

[25:25] if the current thing isn't working.

[25:28] But the problem is, in the space of boutique pinball, there's no room for failure.

[25:35] Every game needs to work.

[25:37] I mean, barrel's a fun.

[25:38] Dune's not flying off the shelves either.

[25:41] You can't have these mediocre sales.

[25:44] You can't.

[25:45] When you're a boutique, you need to get it right.

[25:48] And the reason why Spooky, I think, sometimes leads these other companies to making...

[25:54] Spooky's made mistakes.

[25:55] The difference is two things.

[25:59] Spooky learns from their mistakes, and Spooky does not have the overhead that other people

[26:04] have.

[26:05] And Spooky doesn't have to deal with tariffs.

[26:07] Think about it.

[26:08] All of a sudden, Spooky's in the driver's seat now because they don't have tariffs.

[26:13] If they make their game in America, they're going to sell all 888 Beetlejuices in America

[26:20] alone.

[26:21] They don't need to send them anywhere overseas.

[26:24] But these European companies, they're going to die if they don't get US sales.

[26:29] There's not enough people locally to justify being a pinball manufacturer.

[26:34] The main pinball market in the world is America.

[26:37] And so, you know, that's my final closing statement on this whole thing.

[26:42] I sometimes think these companies need to do more market research.

[26:46] If they had done a survey months ago, a year ago, would you buy a predator pinball machine

[26:55] that did not feature Arnold?

[26:58] They would have got back in that survey a 98% response, no.

[27:04] Okay?

[27:06] And that would have led them to make something else where they could get all the assets.

[27:11] I'm going to just end on this note.

[27:13] This is why these people don't get it.

[27:15] If they had made the last starfighter with every asset, that would sell you more games

[27:23] than Predator without Arnold.

[27:27] Sometimes in life, things are required.

[27:29] Right?

[27:30] There's non-negotiables.

[27:32] And making a Predator pinball machine without Arnold is not going to work.

[27:38] Being Arnold in it is a non-negotiable.

[27:42] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[27:46] If you're listening for free on Facebook, we would love to have you.

[27:50] We would love for you to show support to Canada's Pinball Podcasts.

[27:54] I get a lot of arrows from people who think I'm toxic.

[27:57] I don't think this is toxic.

[27:59] You know, I'm tired of everybody always saying that like, look, I'm trying, man.

[28:02] I have a good heart.

[28:03] I reach out to people.

[28:04] I apologize.

[28:06] And then they say nothing.

[28:07] You know, they ghost me.

[28:08] They stonewall me.

[28:09] They put up stories about me.

[28:10] They're the ones trying to dox me.

[28:13] They don't want to call me Canada.

[28:15] You know, when they want to like insult me, all of a sudden it's Chris Caloris did this.

[28:18] Chris Caloris.

[28:19] I get it.

[28:20] I get it.

[28:21] But he's always Hulk Hogan.

[28:23] He's always Hulk Hogan.

[28:24] Yeah.

[28:25] Oh, Terry Boa.

[28:26] He's only Terry Boa in the court of law.

[28:28] And that's what they're trying to do to me.

[28:30] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[28:31] It's not going to work.

[28:32] If you think I'm a jerk, if you think I'm an a-hole, if you're disappointed in me, trust

[28:38] me, nobody is more disappointed in me than me spending 1126 episodes making pinball content

[28:46] for each and every one of you.
