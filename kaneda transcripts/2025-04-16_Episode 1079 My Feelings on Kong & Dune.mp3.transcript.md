[00:00] Concussion, the boys and boys, shoot, I'm gonna shout, just stop the feeling.

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:11] Ah, good morning and welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:15] I'm about to drop it.

[00:16] I'm coming in hot, everybody, because I just want to do a show that I think needs to be said.

[00:21] And I don't think anyone else is gonna talk like this because I feel this tremendous pressure

[00:27] by the pinball armies that are out there to just universally support anything if it's

[00:34] done by Keith Elwyn.

[00:37] We've got a champion, all new pinball machines.

[00:40] And look, I just want to start this show out by saying this, I think both King Kong and

[00:46] Dune look like a lot of fun to play.

[00:50] I can't wait to go play both of these games.

[00:54] They're gonna get to automated pinball 30 minutes from me, probably in the next month

[00:59] or so, and I can't wait to play them.

[01:03] They both look fun in different ways.

[01:07] And I also feel zero desire to buy either game.

[01:12] Are you not allowed in the modern pinball world to hold those two opposing points of

[01:19] view?

[01:20] But I'm also allowed to have opinions.

[01:24] And I've noticed this, the more you have an opinion that isn't just favorable to what

[01:29] these companies work on, everybody comes at you with the pitchforks.

[01:34] And I just want to say this, I grew up in a family where my mother, who is the most artistic

[01:41] person I've ever met, she has an art gallery.

[01:43] You don't know this.

[01:45] My mom met my father at Bristol Myers Squibb.

[01:49] She ran the art department.

[01:51] She came up with the logos for Bristol Myers, Clare all bottles of shampoo and conditioner.

[01:57] She has an art gallery for decades.

[02:00] And I'm telling you right now, you might argue with my Gucci style and whatnot, but I can

[02:05] look at that King Kong play field and I can say that's way too busy.

[02:14] It's way too cluttered.

[02:16] It's got way too much colors going on for a theme like King Kong.

[02:22] And then you say that and everybody wants to jump down your throat.

[02:27] Like you can't say that about these pinball artists and these legends.

[02:31] Why not?

[02:33] My eyes have seen King Kong movie posters over the years.

[02:37] The iconic stuff that people spend six figures on, those original Kong movie posters, I know

[02:45] iconic King Kong looks like.

[02:49] And it's not this.

[02:51] And so yeah, there's some cool stuff happening in the game, but I'm allowed to look at this

[02:56] game and just say, hey, to me, that's not King Kong.

[03:01] When I think of King Kong, what is the most iconic thing he's known for?

[03:05] It's on the cabinet artwork, but it's nowhere in the physical game.

[03:10] How do you make a King Kong game where the major mech in the game is not the Empire State

[03:17] Building?

[03:19] How do you not have King Kong on the other side of that large top of the Empire State

[03:24] Building?

[03:25] He should have swung around like Balrog.

[03:28] There should have been airplanes flying around moving under the glass on top of that Empire

[03:34] State Building.

[03:35] He should have picked up the ball with his hands and thrown it somehow.

[03:38] How do you not have any of that?

[03:40] Nope, you just repurposed the Hulk mech from Avengers.

[03:45] That's all that's going on there, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:48] And I'm just here to tell you beyond that, Kong, I'm like looking at it right now and

[03:54] it looks like it's like King Kong looks like X-Men and Avengers had a baby.

[04:01] It's like, come on, I get it.

[04:03] Like you want to make it pop.

[04:05] You want to make it colorful.

[04:07] And boy, oh boy, did you succeed, but at what cost?

[04:11] This thing is like screaming at all of our eyeballs.

[04:15] Everything louder than everything else.

[04:17] I'm looking at a picture of the play field and there's just like so much happening to

[04:23] the point where like you don't know what to focus on.

[04:26] And look, these are very talented artists, but you can't tell me that somewhere in this

[04:32] artistic line of geniuses of pinball, nobody says, hey man, this looks a little busy.

[04:39] This looks a little bit like it's too much.

[04:42] Like when there's so much happening with so much color exploding all over a pinball machine,

[04:48] your eyes don't know what to focus on.

[04:51] And I'm sorry, I just don't like it.

[04:54] To me, King Kong should have been approached differently.

[04:57] I think they should have looked at a little bit more of the iconic King Kong that everybody

[05:02] knows and loves.

[05:03] And also, it's so weird to me that Stern's marketing is like, this game pays homage to

[05:09] the Data East game where only six of them were made.

[05:13] Why?

[05:14] Why?

[05:15] Nobody thinks fondly of some crappy Data East prototype game that never got made.

[05:22] And so that becomes your design inspiration for this King Kong.

[05:26] And it just goes to show you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the problem with Stern right now.

[05:31] It's the problem with pinball.

[05:32] These guys are living in a vacuum and they're doing everything for themselves.

[05:38] It's like inside baseball.

[05:39] And they need to step out.

[05:41] This is not iconic Kong.

[05:43] All right, it's not.

[05:44] It looks like King Kong met up with Xavier in the wheelchair and decided to join the X-Men

[05:52] and you get this colorful comic book looking King Kong pinball machine.

[05:57] And look, that's fine.

[05:58] And look, again, I'm not upset really about it.

[06:01] I'm just saying this isn't what I would have done.

[06:05] When I look at the colors in this game, I don't see Art Deco New York City.

[06:10] I don't see a jungle.

[06:12] I don't know what I see.

[06:13] I don't know anything in nature that explodes with this much purple, blue, yellow magenta.

[06:20] I don't know what this is.

[06:22] These colors look more like Pandora than anything from the world of King Kong.

[06:28] And yet you have to say you like it.

[06:30] Or John Erlich will come for you saying you're the most negative guy in pinball.

[06:34] Sorry, John.

[06:35] Sorry.

[06:36] Some of us don't make money off of the pinball machines we buy.

[06:40] Some of us actually lose money.

[06:41] Thousands of dollars, John.

[06:43] All right, so go buy a King Kong, John.

[06:45] Put it on location.

[06:47] And you're gonna buy the pro, which is half the price of the damn LE, and it's gonna be

[06:51] a moneymaker for you.

[06:53] You know I love you, brother.

[06:54] I'm gonna come to Jack Bar, and I'm gonna do what I always do and leave a big tip at

[06:59] the bar.

[07:00] But look, for some reason everybody acts like you need to be on the side of Elwyn and his

[07:07] team.

[07:08] And sure, this game is gonna shoot great.

[07:10] This game is gonna have great code, and it's gonna be fun.

[07:14] But that doesn't take away.

[07:16] That doesn't take away the big issue I see happening at Stern Pinball.

[07:20] It's just feeling like everything is the same.

[07:24] It's like this company can't step outside the box and make different decisions.

[07:29] It's like the same look and feel over and over and over again.

[07:34] It's like instead of looking at King Kong, instead of looking at its world and what is

[07:40] iconic in its world, they're putting it into the Stern Blender.

[07:44] And that's what it's all starting to feel like.

[07:46] You put everything in the Blender of Stern, and you get this.

[07:50] Lots of purples, lots of blues, lots of colors, regardless of what the theme is.

[07:54] The inserts in this game are absolutely ridiculous.

[07:58] I mean, I'm looking at a playfield image, and the amount of inserts almost make it impossible

[08:04] to have like a nice, easy-on-the-eyes art package in this game.

[08:10] They manage to layer art on top of this barrage of inserts and make it even more cluttered.

[08:16] I don't know what came first.

[08:18] I'm not even sure the order.

[08:20] Did they do the inserts first and then the art package?

[08:23] Or I think they probably did it the other way around.

[08:26] I don't know.

[08:27] I don't care.

[08:28] I'm looking down at the game right now, and I don't even know how to process it.

[08:32] Again, it's probably going to shoot well.

[08:35] But boy, oh boy, oh boy, after seeing King Kong, it makes me long for a much simpler art

[08:40] package like Jaws.

[08:43] Because if you think about the Jaws art package and it's the ocean, what happens, right?

[08:48] Your eye is drawn to the things that you are going to shoot, and your eye moves up the playfield

[08:54] towards the boats, towards the orca, towards the fishing reel, towards the shark fin mech

[09:00] area.

[09:01] I don't even know what to look at in this game.

[09:04] I mean, you've got the gong, which seemingly looks like it's blocking the subway car, which

[09:08] is behind it.

[09:10] Then you've got Kong in the upper right corner hanging out where Staypuff used to be, and

[09:15] he's just going up and down with his arms.

[09:16] I like the fact that the ball is locked into the subway car.

[09:20] I like the fact that he knocks it and it flips up in the air.

[09:23] I like all of that.

[09:24] The spider with the magnet, that doesn't seem very creative at all.

[09:29] And there's no Empire State Building whatsoever.

[09:32] I'm just going to stop right there.

[09:34] How do you make Godzilla and King Kong?

[09:38] And if I were to ask you in a blind survey, which theme should have an impressive building

[09:45] that becomes the talk of the game?

[09:48] Would you ever have said Godzilla?

[09:50] No!

[09:51] King Kong is the theme that should have the big building that everybody's talking about.

[09:57] It should have been the Empire State Building that gets taller and taller as King Kong is

[10:04] ascending towards the top of the building.

[10:06] I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

[10:07] I'm allowed to feel this way.

[10:09] I'm allowed to say that this is what happens when you stop doing any focus groups.

[10:15] You don't bring anybody in.

[10:16] I mean, most of us could have walked into Stern Pinball and said, what do you do in

[10:20] Georgia, Keith?

[10:22] Where's the Empire State Building?

[10:24] What do you do with this color?

[10:26] People are saying it looks like a clown vomited all over the game.

[10:30] It's hard to argue against those people.

[10:31] I didn't say it.

[10:32] That's what people are saying on pin site.

[10:34] But boy, oh boy, oh boy, I feel like this company is at the point now where you need

[10:38] to start bringing in some outside opinions to make some changes to these games.

[10:44] And so that's where I'm at on King Kong.

[10:46] I think it's a game that's going to shoot really well.

[10:49] I think aesthetically, it's all over the place.

[10:52] I don't even know how to get my head around it.

[10:54] I've watched the video like eight times.

[10:56] It still is like seizure inducing when you see how much is in the game.

[11:01] I don't think it works.

[11:03] Again, I don't.

[11:04] I think if you have that opinion, get ready to be attacked by the Stern Army.

[11:09] And I also think the L.E. of this game is not like I have to have it.

[11:15] The Art Deco armor on the game doesn't make any sense with the comic book style

[11:20] coloring happening everywhere else in the game.

[11:23] If it was much more 1932's beautiful, classic New York City skyline, beautiful

[11:30] Art Deco, I would have been all over this game.

[11:33] This game should have looked like that.

[11:35] If they went all in on old Kong with black and white animations, Art Deco

[11:41] everywhere, you know, the original top to the Empire State Building, like the

[11:45] original Kong movie, people would have been all over it.

[11:49] And the one major thing missing from this entire game, Stern Pimbal didn't

[11:54] license any assets from any of the Kong movies.

[11:58] Talk about cheap, ladies and gentlemen.

[12:01] So they spent zero money licensing anything from the King Kong film archive.

[12:08] Look at Godzilla.

[12:09] It's got everything from the Godzilla film archive.

[12:12] Godzilla's got the more impressive mechanisms in the game.

[12:16] So you're telling me that when Godzilla came out for $10,500 and gave you

[12:21] everything a Godzilla fan could want and more, and now we're spending 30%

[12:27] more on a King Kong le.

[12:29] They licensed nothing.

[12:31] Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for everybody to wake up.

[12:34] I think we have woken up and I think they need to stop like this doesn't work anymore.

[12:38] It doesn't work at these prices.

[12:41] And I don't think people are going to fall for it.

[12:43] And I will arm wrestle anybody out there who's going to tell me that King Kong

[12:48] shouldn't have the more impressive building mech.

[12:51] Then God freaking Zilla Godzilla should have had Godzilla breathing fire.

[12:57] It doesn't.

[12:58] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry, but shots and art are not the new toys.

[13:04] And some of these games need to be approached and the themes need to be

[13:08] developed onto the game that are paying homage to what that theme is iconic for.

[13:14] And you can't just throw everything in a stern blender and get an X-Men like

[13:19] looking game regardless of the theme.

[13:22] Thank you for being a member of Canada's pinball podcast.

[13:25] Nobody else talks like this because they can't because they still want to get the

[13:29] damn invites.

[13:30] I don't care about those invites.

[13:32] I'd rather be having lobster rolls at Roedon Seafood and being able to speak

[13:37] my mind freely.

[13:39] Let's go on to Dune.

[13:41] Man, that mech is awesome.

[13:42] The mech is freaking awesome.

[13:44] That is one of the coolest mechs I've seen in pinball in a long time.

[13:48] Now, one mech doesn't sell you a game.

[13:51] I was watching the gameplay footage of Dune.

[13:53] I can't tell really where the code is in this game.

[13:56] It still feels really early on.

[13:59] It doesn't feel like this game's ready to be launched right now.

[14:04] I think the reason they need to launch it now, they need to get the line going.

[14:07] I understand it.

[14:08] Stern pinball has made a career shipping games before the code is done.

[14:13] Okay, so Dune is out now too.

[14:15] And it's another one where like unlike King Kong,

[14:18] I think both of these themes, I got to be honest,

[14:20] both of these themes are not great for pinball.

[14:24] So I think both of these themes, a lot of us are like,

[14:27] oh, you know, I'm not dying to own this theme.

[14:30] There's a lot of you out there too that are not dying to own Harry Potter.

[14:35] I've been saying this for weeks.

[14:37] The one theme that most men 40 to 60 actually are attracted to the most out

[14:42] of these four games coming out is Predator.

[14:45] We all knew Predator is going to be probably horrendous.

[14:48] It's probably not going to have Arnold.

[14:50] You're not allowed to talk like this, Chris.

[14:52] Look, it's probably going to be the truth.

[14:54] And Harry Potter is also another one where most of you are not watching Harry Potter movies.

[15:01] You're not reciting the lines.

[15:03] It's going to win out right now.

[15:04] We know this is Kong.

[15:06] I don't think Jersey Jack is nervous at all.

[15:09] I think Harry Potter is going to be the champion of this round of new pinball games easily.

[15:17] And they're going to sell so many more Harry Potter's than Stern is going to sell of King Kong.

[15:23] It's just the way it's going to go, people.

[15:26] Times have changed, but Jersey Jack must be feeling really good seeing King Kong

[15:32] yesterday because I think Harry Potter, unlike Kong, they're going to translate

[15:37] that theme perfectly into a beautiful pinball game.

[15:41] I don't think anyone's going to look down at Harry Potter and see Rainbow Puk going on.

[15:46] I think Jersey Jack has heard that feedback and Potter is not going to be Rainbow Puk.

[15:51] All right, so Dune, though, right?

[15:52] Dune is a hard game for me to figure out.

[15:55] Like, I want to play it.

[15:56] That mechanism is really cool.

[15:59] Other than that mechanism, am I seeing a ton of other stuff?

[16:03] Not sure yet, right?

[16:04] I'm not seeing a ton of other stuff.

[16:06] But I do love that mechanism.

[16:08] But I'm just worried again that it's not a theme that most of you want.

[16:13] I'm not sure you're seeing enough to pull the trigger.

[16:16] And I think the software is really going to be critical on whether or not Dune is a game

[16:22] you're going to want, because on just theme alone, that's a no.

[16:27] But look at Evil Dead, right?

[16:28] Most of you do not love the Evil Dead movies the way the spooky folks do.

[16:34] But look at the Evil Dead game they made and they overcame a lot of people.

[16:40] Skepticism, mine included, by delivering one of the most beautiful

[16:44] packed games in a long time.

[16:47] That's just a lot of pinball fun.

[16:49] It's really campy.

[16:50] It's really fun and it's loaded with stuff.

[16:53] And so will Dune be able to do that?

[16:56] Will the software, you know, it's got a better mech.

[16:59] Trust me, that worm mech is more impressive than anything in King Kong.

[17:03] Than anything in Evil Dead than anything I've seen in most recent pinball machines.

[17:08] So kudos to you guys over at Barrels of Fun.

[17:12] But again, it's a mech that's inside a theme that most people don't want.

[17:17] If that was your flux capacitor mech, it'd be a different story.

[17:21] If that was your Nakatomi mech in diehard, different story.

[17:25] You know what I mean, everybody?

[17:26] It's like it matters.

[17:28] Theme really matters.

[17:29] And I think we're at a point now why we're all excited that two

[17:33] new games came out in one day.

[17:35] I don't think most of you opened up your wallet.

[17:39] I don't think most of you feel like either of these games are going to be hard to get.

[17:43] And I think most of you are like me.

[17:46] You want to play them.

[17:47] You were excited that new pinball machines came out.

[17:50] We're all excited to see this stuff.

[17:51] But you don't feel FOMO.

[17:54] You don't feel the pressure to pull the trigger.

[17:56] And I'm just here to tell you that's OK.

[17:59] Manufacturers don't want you to feel that way.

[18:02] They want you to feel FOMO.

[18:04] Distributors don't want you to feel that way.

[18:07] This has been my thing of late.

[18:08] Just wait and see.

[18:10] And you will be able to get both of these games.

[18:13] And by the time both of these games finished their code,

[18:16] trust me, you're going to be able to get any of them for 20 to 30 percent less.

[18:21] I don't know why that's such a problem.

[18:23] Why is it such a problem for everybody to approach this hobby this way?

[18:28] I think these pinball companies, though, they need to get the themes better.

[18:31] We shouldn't even be having debates.

[18:33] We should just be buying the game right away.

[18:36] Like that's what's going to happen when back to the future comes out.

[18:39] It's going to happen for the Harry Potter fan base.

[18:42] You know, what is it with this hobby and its inability to understand

[18:46] what the pinball buying demographic wants?

[18:49] You know, you got this huge list of people that they just love pinball.

[18:53] I get it. I love pinball, too.

[18:55] But I love my money more and I love my family more and I love taking vacations

[19:00] more than pinball.

[19:01] So for me to buy a pinball machine and for me to think about it and you guys are

[19:06] in the same boat, it really needs to wow you because most of you have many machines

[19:12] you love already.

[19:13] So are these machines giving you more?

[19:16] The days of just buying because you want something new, new inbox are over

[19:21] unless you want to lose a lot of money.

[19:24] And that is the narrative of the last three years.

[19:28] And that story and that narrative is not going to get broken by the two games we

[19:34] saw yesterday. And I don't think it's going to get broken by Harry Potter

[19:38] because if they make unlimited CEs and Jack's already said they're going to make

[19:42] it for years, then why would you go in right away?

[19:46] But at least Harry Potter on day one will be most likely code complete.

[19:51] Jersey Jack doesn't release games with incomplete code.

[19:54] They might not have the wizard mode, which is going to be so funny considering

[19:58] it's Harry Potter, but for the most part, most of the game will be there.

[20:03] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canada's pinball podcast.

[20:07] Tell me how you feel about King Kong.

[20:09] And oh, by the way, I saw a little bit of King Kong beforehand,

[20:13] which made me excited to order one.

[20:15] But when I saw the whole thing, I literally I couldn't even take in what I was seeing.

[20:21] It was too much. It's just too much.

[20:23] It's not what I want in King Kong.

[20:26] Canada out.
