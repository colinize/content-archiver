[00:00] You know, it's really weird hearing a Guns and Rose's song that Axel Rose recorded

[00:21] that in 1999, right?

[00:24] Hard School came out yesterday as a new Guns and Rose's song.

[00:28] This not new, he just had slash and duff play over and sort of chop up in a old song.

[00:34] Welcome to the Canadian Club.

[00:36] This is episode 12.

[00:37] I want to say thank you to all of you who are a club member.

[00:41] And I know that I gave the last Canadian club out for free.

[00:45] I just wanted people out there to know what they were missing, but we're not going to

[00:49] do it again.

[00:50] So all of you who are contributing, thank you so much.

[00:52] I want to give a shout out to our new members, Edward, Cliff, Squalk, Andy, Carol, Chairman

[00:59] now, Anthony, Dave.

[01:02] I think those are the newest J and James.

[01:04] I think I got you guys last time, but thank you so much for being members.

[01:07] Here's what I want to talk about on this episode of the Canadian Club episode 12.

[01:11] I just want to go down the manufacturer list and I want to say some things that are just

[01:16] making me scratch my head.

[01:18] They're making me say really at these prices with what's going on in the pinball hobby,

[01:24] we're still experiencing these kinds of things.

[01:27] Okay, and here's where I want to start first.

[01:29] I want to start with spooky pinball because this company, as you know, is probably everyone's

[01:35] favorite boutique pinball company.

[01:37] They represent the American dream and Charlie did it right.

[01:41] Charlie did it right.

[01:42] He started a pinball company.

[01:43] Are you waiting for it with like $50,000?

[01:47] He made America's most honoured and they couldn't sell any of them and then he limited it

[01:51] to a 150 machines and then they sold that and then they sold the next game at 300 units

[01:58] and then I think it was 500.

[02:01] Then we got 750 Rick and Morty's.

[02:04] We got 500 plus TNA's.

[02:07] Now we have 1,250 Halloween's and 500 Ultramans all on one day, which is great and everybody

[02:16] feels really good about spooky pinball and their ascension in the pinball marketplace

[02:22] and in the community and in the world, right?

[02:25] But here's where I think spooky pinball is making me scratch my head because they're no

[02:30] longer that little tiny company that basically could barely make 150 games.

[02:37] They are now a company that is selling a product at a price point that is premium.

[02:42] Remember, spooky games were like $5,000, now they're $10,000 with a butter cabinet.

[02:49] So when you charge this much money and remember, they're still in Benton, Wisconsin.

[02:54] Charlie's factory, I believe like the city of Benton kind of like gave it to him for

[02:58] like a buck, his overhead is not nearly the same cost of Jersey Jack or Stern pinball,

[03:06] which means they can invest in their people, in their workforce and in their talent.

[03:12] And I am starting to scratch my head a little bit about some of the things we're seeing

[03:17] with these new games and primarily I'm scratching my head as I see what is up on that screen

[03:24] on these machines and is making me wonder whether or not Charlie has invested enough money

[03:31] in the software and coding department of spooky pinball and I don't think he has.

[03:38] And I think this is a corner that they are kind of cutting and if they continue to cut

[03:43] this corner, I think this could start to could really start to erode away all of the good

[03:50] will he's built up with the community and I'm really perplexed.

[03:53] I'm very perplexed about the animations on Halloween.

[03:57] The more I look at them, not just from a quality standpoint and yes, I don't think those

[04:03] are pinball quality animations by any means.

[04:06] I don't.

[04:07] But what's really confusing about them is not just the quality, it's how they're represented

[04:12] in the game.

[04:13] So I'm looking at this scene in which you're trying to escape Mike Myers, you're trying

[04:17] to escape from the kitchen and he's there holding this butcher knife and it goes back

[04:22] and forth between this woman who is terrified and it's a static image of her that's an artwork

[04:28] piece and then we cut back to Mike Myers and he's just standing in the kitchen.

[04:33] He's standing in the kitchen just going up and down with the knife almost like he's master

[04:37] baiting with it and he's not moving towards her.

[04:40] There's no tension, there's no anxiety, there's no movement whatsoever that makes any sense.

[04:46] Like why would he stand still in a kitchen staring at this terrified woman and not go towards

[04:53] her?

[04:54] The whole thing doesn't work.

[04:55] The reason why these movies are scary, the reason why they terrified us in the theater

[05:00] is that whole moment in which he appears and then he attacks.

[05:05] And when he appears just static like that, do you feel scared?

[05:09] Do you feel like you need to escape him?

[05:11] Do you feel anything that relates to the sort of terror that the movie creates?

[05:16] It's like they're combining bad animations with a scene that makes absolutely no sense.

[05:21] You know what I think about Batman 66, there aren't many animations in the game but there

[05:25] is one in which Batman grabs the big pinball and it's like he's running around like he's

[05:30] holding the bomb like in the movie and he throws the pinball into the water and that gives

[05:35] you an extra ball.

[05:36] Now imagine that same animation done the way spooky is doing it in which Batman's just

[05:41] standing there and he's just like going back and forth with the ball and nothing else

[05:44] is happening and he's not running around.

[05:47] It's not really an animation what they're doing.

[05:49] And so that makes no sense.

[05:51] It makes me scratch my head and it makes me really worried that spooky pinball when they

[05:56] were given these animations, they looked at it and said this is good enough for a pinball

[06:03] machine that is costing people $9,000 and I'm sorry but I think they need to start over

[06:10] with the animations and I think they need to invest money in more talented people who

[06:15] can make these games as good as if not better than what their competitors are doing because

[06:21] you're charging that much money.

[06:23] And of course the other thing right, the hedge multi-baw.

[06:27] I know I've made this an issue that fact that like nobody caught that and even they now

[06:31] came out and said that nobody caught that and I really find that hard to believe.

[06:37] The moment I stood over the game, the moment I saw the game light up, it was the first

[06:42] thing I noticed.

[06:44] So how could they when they put in the order for the playfields and they started making

[06:49] these games and they're shipping these games to customers, they must have seen that and

[06:54] they must have thought they could get away with it and it's not a huge deal but it's

[06:59] just sloppy.

[07:01] And at these price points once again, there's just no room for sloppiness, you have to make

[07:06] sure that these details are figured out before you start making games and before you start

[07:13] shipping games to customers because this one's a big one because when you think about it,

[07:17] there might not be a way to retroactively fix this for all of the machines that have gone

[07:23] out and for all of the playfields that have already been ordered and that will cost them

[07:28] thousands of dollars if consumers demand a fix for this.

[07:32] Now I don't think they will.

[07:34] I think some of these early spooky games that have hedge multi-baw on them will actually

[07:39] become kind of like a rare conversation piece but it speaks to a larger issue.

[07:45] Charlie needs to invest more in some of these areas and he needs to not cut corners and

[07:52] I think if he continues to cut some of these corners and doesn't catch this stuff earlier,

[07:57] it's going to a road away at all of the great goodwill they have.

[08:02] And the coding is very important.

[08:04] I can't underscore enough, you need to nail the code on a game.

[08:09] The monsters is the most beautiful pinball machine maybe ever.

[08:13] It really is.

[08:14] Have you ever stood over a monster recently and realized that this is easily Christopher

[08:18] Franchise's nicest game?

[08:20] It might even be Stern Pinball's most beautiful game and what is the main reason why nobody

[08:25] wants to own a monster.

[08:27] It's because of the code.

[08:29] And when you look at the monsters, that code is still much further along and looks much

[08:34] better than the code we're getting on Halloween.

[08:38] And I'm starting to see like all of these apologists say, oh they're just going to end up

[08:42] fixing it.

[08:43] It's not that simple.

[08:44] The road they're going down with this animator and the way they're doing this game, it's

[08:49] not that easy.

[08:50] They're building this ship in the ocean and to turn it around now is going to be a lot

[08:55] more difficult, a lot more expensive.

[08:59] And I know there's a code update coming, I think October 1st.

[09:02] So we're going to see what they do to get more clips in the game, but I'm telling you

[09:06] right now when they said they've got clips that are like three seconds long, I don't think

[09:10] you're going to see what you really want to see.

[09:12] I really don't.

[09:13] I think you're going to see more snid bits, but I still think you're going to have a lot

[09:16] of those animations guiding you through this game.

[09:19] All right, the next head scratcher thing for Canator right now is this.

[09:23] Why am I in 2021 after they've shipped about 2800 games of Guns and Roses?

[09:31] Why is it that Jersey Jack Pimball, the world's makers of the most premium Pimball machine?

[09:37] It is.

[09:38] Guns and Roses and Jersey Jack, those machines are the Rolls Royces of Pimball.

[09:43] They really are.

[09:45] Why is it that we are still seeing people who have rubbers in their games that fall apart

[09:51] after 200 plays?

[09:53] Jersey Jack, this is inexcusable.

[09:56] This is such a weird thing for me to head scratch.

[09:59] Why can't they give people Titan rubbers?

[10:02] Why are they using the cheapest rubbers imaginable and their breaking and their wearing down right

[10:09] away?

[10:10] This makes no sense.

[10:11] Do you not expect people to play your games?

[10:14] Is this a strategy of yours to not have the Miracle Playfields fall apart?

[10:18] Hey, if we give them rubbers that fall apart in 200 plays, they won't be able to play

[10:23] the game.

[10:24] That's the best protection against all the play field issues.

[10:27] No, I'm just kidding, but this is just another head scratcher.

[10:29] It's like Jack.

[10:30] Come on, Jersey Jack.

[10:32] Enough of this already.

[10:34] How many customers do you have to see with their red rubbers just turning black and falling

[10:39] apart before someone says, hey, maybe we should give customers

[10:44] a better quality rubber in their premium pinball machine.

[10:48] This looks really bad.

[10:50] Stern flipper rubbers don't fall apart like this.

[10:53] And it's such a cheap item.

[10:55] That's the problem when you cut corners on stuff like flipper bat rubber.

[10:59] It's like, what is this?

[11:00] $5?

[11:01] You're telling me.

[11:02] I spend $10,500 on a game.

[11:06] And after 200 plays, it looks like I've put 2000 plays on the game.

[11:10] Jersey Jack, come on.

[11:12] Stop with this.

[11:13] I have one more head scratcher with Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:16] And this head scratcher is the topper for guns and roses.

[11:20] This game is amazing.

[11:21] This game is incredible.

[11:22] This game is beautiful.

[11:24] This game deserves a topper that's equally as impressive as the game itself.

[11:29] And you're telling me when you have the guns and roses IP, when you have all of the

[11:34] awesome skeleton artwork from Dane Henry Jr., you're telling me that you decided that

[11:40] that would be the topper for this game.

[11:43] Why?

[11:44] There's so much money to be made on toppers.

[11:46] There's so much revenue they could have made if they made a nice topper.

[11:50] And again, I'm seeing people unbox these toppers, right?

[11:54] And they all say the same thing.

[11:55] It's not that nice.

[11:57] Jersey Jack, as a marketer, why would you want to give people something that's not impressing

[12:03] them?

[12:04] Why would you look at that topper and then look at the beautiful game below it and say,

[12:09] you know what?

[12:10] This isn't good enough.

[12:11] You can't do this like this can't be the topper that we officially launch from Jersey Jack

[12:17] Pimbal for all of these guns and roses owners out there.

[12:20] You're going to have four to five thousand people with guns and roses, Ellie machines that

[12:27] would buy a topper if it was decent.

[12:30] This isn't decent.

[12:32] It's pathetic.

[12:33] And now you're not going to get all of that revenue because you launch something that's

[12:37] just so lazy.

[12:39] I don't understand it.

[12:41] It's not hard to get a beautiful 3D sculpted topper that would completely complement the

[12:49] beautiful work of art that Eric put into this game.

[12:53] And I think that's another head scratcher that can it just doesn't understand.

[12:57] All right.

[12:58] What else am I scratching my head at these days?

[13:00] Am I scratching my head at the Godzilla artwork?

[13:03] Not really.

[13:04] You know, I've sort of grown to sort of love Stern Pimbal over the last couple months.

[13:08] And I'll tell you why.

[13:09] Stern Pimbal makes the difficult so simple.

[13:12] They make it so easy on everybody.

[13:15] And every time we nitpick Stern and every time we complain about Stern, it's always kind

[13:20] of like unfounded.

[13:21] I get that they charge a lot.

[13:24] But ultimately, the way they have manufacturing down, the way they don't make you wait forever

[13:29] for a game, the way they continue to release three to four games a year, are we really

[13:34] that mad at Stern Pimbal?

[13:37] Even that I was always scratching my head at Stern Pimbal.

[13:39] And I got an answer and I'm going to give it to you guys right now.

[13:42] I was always like, why doesn't Stern re-release all of these toppers that are selling for thousands

[13:48] of dollars?

[13:49] Why don't they re-release the Ecto 1 topper?

[13:52] Right.

[13:53] The Ecto 1 topper is now selling for like 3,500 bucks.

[13:55] So I had a really amazing conversation with Andrew, who is over at Stern Pimbal.

[14:00] Andrew's in charge of their merchandise and their accessories.

[14:03] He runs like their e-shop.

[14:04] He's an incredible guy with an incredible back story.

[14:07] He worked at Marvel.

[14:08] He worked at tops.

[14:10] He worked at Hallmark.

[14:11] And I had about a half hour conversation with him.

[14:14] He listens to the show.

[14:15] I was happy to hear that.

[14:16] That's Stern Pimbal.

[14:17] Listen to the show.

[14:18] And he's such a cool dude.

[14:19] And he said it's real simple, Chris.

[14:20] He's like the only reason we don't have any more Ecto 1 toppers, or we can't make them

[14:25] right now, is that the license ran out.

[14:28] There is no other reason than that.

[14:30] And the license for these things are very expensive.

[14:32] Now to play Devil's Advocate though, right?

[14:34] I get that with Ghostbusters.

[14:36] But you're telling me that the Black Knight license ran out?

[14:40] No.

[14:41] They could easily make more Black Knight toppers.

[14:43] And that's really the only reason to own a Black Knight machine is if you have the topper.

[14:47] Apparently that's the best part of the game.

[14:49] So where else in my head scratch in these days?

[14:51] Well, I am head scratching at American Pimbal, just not getting anything out.

[14:55] Same thing with CGC.

[14:57] These two companies, it's like what are they waiting for, right?

[15:00] When are they going to release these two new games?

[15:02] And when is the timing going to be right for them?

[15:05] Clearly there's a delay.

[15:06] Clearly the COVID supply chain issues is impacting both of these companies.

[15:10] But I think the real head scratcher for American Pimbal is they still haven't revealed

[15:14] what their game is.

[15:15] Everybody knows it's cactus Canyon remake.

[15:17] We've known it forever.

[15:18] Everyone knows that game is going to be the game.

[15:21] Everyone's seen for years.

[15:22] It's going to have improvements throughout.

[15:24] It's going to do fine.

[15:26] It's American Pimbal that has me scratching my head the most because they need more help.

[15:30] They need to create more hype and enthusiasm for this title or it's not going to do well.

[15:35] It's not going to do well and I don't see them doing anything.

[15:39] They're still talking about the old titles.

[15:41] But the future for American Pimbal isn't front of them.

[15:44] It's not Houdini, it's not Octoberfest, it's not Hot Wheels.

[15:48] And so they have a new game ready to go.

[15:51] And they're doing absolutely nothing to even slowly get people excited about it.

[15:56] They could at least do a few things.

[15:57] If I were them, maybe show people what the new cabinet looks like because they're not

[16:01] going to do the old cabinet anymore.

[16:03] Maybe show people some other features that are going to be part of the American Pimbal

[16:07] games moving forward.

[16:09] Maybe even start to talk about internet connectivity.

[16:11] Do you have any of that plan for American Pimbal?

[16:13] But there's nothing.

[16:15] And you do have to work hard in Pimbal to create a fan base and a community.

[16:20] And I just feel like American Pimbal, it's like they wait for a new game to come out.

[16:25] It's usually not that successful.

[16:27] And then all these months go by in which they're doing nothing to sort of get the community

[16:32] to rally around their brand.

[16:34] A brand is a very precious thing.

[16:36] You have to cultivate it.

[16:38] You have to nurture it.

[16:39] You have to keep it relevant.

[16:41] To go silent for eight months makes you irrelevant in Pimbal.

[16:45] And not only that, people are spending their money on other things because they don't

[16:50] know anything is coming from you.

[16:52] That's a really bad marketing strategy.

[16:55] And now that you've waited until after Godzilla is out there, it's a really, really bad strategy

[17:01] because I would hate, I would hate to launch a game after Keith L. Wins Godzilla.

[17:07] The amount of money and the amount of room this game is going to occupy is going to make

[17:12] it really, really hard for Jerry to sell his new P3 license game for AP to sell this junior

[17:18] designer game.

[17:19] And I also think it's going to put a dent in Chicago gaming company's plans for cactus

[17:24] Canyon remake.

[17:25] But I also part of me feel like you're not going to see cactus Canyon remake ship until

[17:29] next year.

[17:31] And Stern's going to have another reveal.

[17:33] This is crazy.

[17:34] Stern will reveal another game before the year is up.

[17:37] So I think Stern's actually going to reveal another game before any cactus canyons even

[17:43] make their way into homes.

[17:45] And the last thing that just has me scratching my head right now and you've heard me talk

[17:48] about this.

[17:50] It's just the prices that people are paying for a lot of these games second hand.

[17:54] And I'm seeing it on Pinside.

[17:56] I'm seeing the prices people are asking for games that were going for thousands less

[18:00] just a year ago.

[18:02] A Ghostbusters premium from Refinery now $10,000.

[18:06] $10,000.

[18:07] Like you legitimately could easily get a Ghostbusters Ellie for $8,000 for like three years.

[18:14] Three years.

[18:15] If you waived $8,000 to $9,000, you were getting a Ghostbusters Ellie.

[18:19] Now a premium is $10,000.

[18:22] I'm scratching my head and I'm wondering is anybody buying at these prices?

[18:26] I know people are asking this stuff like I saw a TNA with a sale pending for $9,000 on

[18:33] Pinside.

[18:34] Did somebody really go buy a TNA for $9,000?

[18:39] And I'm scratching my head because there is just no way this hobby.

[18:43] If everything moves so far upstream.

[18:46] If all of these games that are like okay or mediocre.

[18:50] If all of these things start to get inflated.

[18:53] It will come to a point where a lot of people are just going to get burnt out and it won't

[18:58] be fun anymore.

[18:59] And I've been doing my finances again.

[19:01] I'm going to talk a little bit more candidly to the Canadian club.

[19:04] I've been doing my finances just at a kid looking at daycare.

[19:08] Looking at rent.

[19:09] Well it's not rent.

[19:10] It's maintenance because I own the apartment but the maintenance is $2,000 a month.

[19:14] I won't even tell you what daycare is.

[19:17] Then I've got the cost of like the parking garage, the car insurance, the two cars.

[19:21] We've got the cost of like here's what seamless costs.

[19:24] Here's what going out costs.

[19:25] We did a budget.

[19:26] And I'll tell you this.

[19:27] I'll tell you this.

[19:28] We make good money as a dual income household.

[19:31] But at the end of the month.

[19:33] When you take care of all of your real priorities and also a real priority for us is investing

[19:39] money.

[19:40] Money away for our future, our retirement and for Kylian and his education.

[19:45] When you do all the math and you put it all together.

[19:48] I just can't run around anymore.

[19:51] Just throwing $12,000 at a Pimbal machine because that's not a priority to me.

[19:56] I also am very aware that the ability to flip these machines for a profit is kind of gone,

[20:02] especially at these prices.

[20:04] And I totally expect Jersey Jack Pimbal to charge $15,000 for their next collector's

[20:11] edition.

[20:12] And it's just getting to a point now where two Pimbal machines sitting in your home might

[20:18] now be around $30,000 or $25,000 for two machines.

[20:23] You have to make $50,000 before taxes just for that toy that you don't really need.

[20:30] Maybe I'm scratching my head at my own desire to be following this thing so closely

[20:34] because the higher the prices get, I'm not going to lie, the higher the prices get, the

[20:39] more un-enthusiastic I become about it.

[20:42] But I'm not going to lose my love of Pimbal.

[20:45] Here's what's happening to me and it's actually the ultimate silver lining and it's the ultimate

[20:49] moment of enlightenment.

[20:50] The more expensive these games become.

[20:53] The easier it is for me to say, you know what?

[20:56] I'm not going to go spend $11,000 on a Godzilla.

[20:59] I'm going to take $100 and I'm going to go to Jack Bar and I'm going to play it there

[21:04] for a month and get my fill.

[21:06] And John will open up the bar for me early, I'll jump on the game, I'll crank the volume,

[21:11] and I'll be able to experience it the same way anyone would in their home and I could

[21:15] play it for two hours uninterrupted.

[21:18] So why would I buy the game?

[21:20] I'm doing good for my friend John in his bar, I'm playing Pimbal out on location, the

[21:25] game is actually set up better than anyone's home because he sets them up perfectly.

[21:29] But starting to feel like as these things become so much more expensive, that location

[21:34] play is actually going to be the most enticing thing moving forward.

[21:39] That owning these things in your home is no longer like a good deal, it no longer makes

[21:45] sense.

[21:46] You have to remember the majority of Pimbal collectors, the majority of people who got

[21:50] into this hobby, so many of them started putting these games in their homes in the late

[21:56] 90s early 2000s.

[21:58] And if you started doing it then, you could get these amazing games for just $1,000.

[22:04] Some of them were 500 bucks, maybe $2,000 for a Twilight Zone, people were giving these

[22:09] games away.

[22:10] There was such a period in which everything was a deal, there were no $12,000 games, there

[22:15] were no $8,000 games, there was only a handful of games like a King Kong or a Kingpin that

[22:21] warranted over $10,000.

[22:24] Now every new game is that, every new game is so inflated and I do think if you love

[22:30] Pimbal, if you love Pimbal, you can still really enjoy this hobby by playing out on location

[22:36] more.

[22:37] You can still really enjoy this hobby by listening to Canadian Pimbal Podcast and other Pimbal

[22:42] Podcasts that you enjoy.

[22:44] You can really enjoy this hobby by going on Pinside and talking about Pimbal with your friends.

[22:49] You can really enjoy this hobby by going on streams.

[22:52] My point being is now for me, the last thing I really want to do to enjoy Pimbal is spend

[22:59] over $10,000.

[23:01] I want to just go to shows and hang out with people, I want to talk Pimbal with all of you,

[23:07] I want to play games that my friends bars that I can get to in just a few minutes, I don't

[23:12] feel this need to own it.

[23:14] And I don't even think owning these machines anymore is any flex move by people.

[23:18] I don't, I'm not impressed anymore when I see people's row of games.

[23:22] Now I see people's row of games and I'm like, wow, you've got like $200,000 in Pimbal

[23:28] machines, that's kind of stupid, that's how I feel.

[23:31] I mean, that's just how I feel.

[23:32] Now God bless some of you out there who have so much money and have so much room, I'm

[23:37] really happy for you.

[23:38] I never begrudge anyone who has that.

[23:41] I'm not envious, I'm really not, I would not do that.

[23:43] If I had $200,000, I would not create a row of Pimbal machines in my home, there's

[23:49] just other stuff I would rather do with the money, but that's the thing, I actually feel

[23:53] more liberated.

[23:54] It's this strange sense, the more I give up chasing all this new inbox fomo, I just feel

[24:00] so liberated.

[24:01] And I just want to go play Pimbal and order a bunch of beers, drink some whiskey, talk

[24:06] to you guys at the bar, talk to you guys at the show.

[24:09] I'll happily visit you guys in your houses and see your collections.

[24:13] But I'm free now and I sort of have to be free of it because I can't afford it because

[24:17] I'm a new dad.

[24:18] And to me when I look at little Killing and he smiles, I want to make sure in 16 years

[24:23] he's not like dad, why are you stressed out?

[24:26] Why can't we afford to do things that we should be doing as a family?

[24:29] Well because son, I bought all these Pimbal machines instead of investing in your future

[24:34] and instead of investing in my retirement, I bought toys at the age of 45.

[24:39] And I say the age of 45 because my birthday is tomorrow, I will be 45 years old.

[24:45] If you want to get Canada gift, you've already given me the gift.

[24:48] You're a Patreon contributor so you do not have to give me anything more.

[24:52] But if you want to, it's canadapimbalatgmail.com and I will happily buy a drink on your

[24:57] behalf or an omokase sushi dinner because some of you guys are so rich.

[25:00] Like it's amazing what some people gave to Brenda for her birthday.

[25:04] I mean we had the most amazing meal thanks to the fans of the show.

[25:08] This is canada club episode 12.

[25:10] I always enjoy talking to you even more than the mass audiences.

[25:14] I think these shows are my favorite to do and you're my favorite for contributing

[25:18] because you don't have to.

[25:20] And you've had hundreds of hours of free content and this means so much to me

[25:25] as sort of like my side hustle that I have people that support this show.

[25:29] And every month Brenda and Killian, we look at our Patreon contributors

[25:34] and it makes us smile because it does and in some little way it just makes it feel like

[25:39] it's all worth it.

[25:41] And I don't care what anyone says nobody wants to do a ton of hard work for free.

[25:45] They don't nobody does.

[25:46] I don't you don't.

[25:48] And so it feels great to be rewarded for being the number one show and doing this show

[25:53] that has given you guys so much entertainment over the years.

[25:56] So I do mean that from the bottom of my heart.

[25:58] Thank you so much.

[25:59] And I know for some of you it is a lot to contribute this every month but I really do appreciate

[26:04] it.

[26:05] I do have a lot of fun new merchandise that is coming out.

[26:07] So if you didn't want to rock the Viva LaRaza don't worry.

[26:10] Some really cool stuff is just down the road.

[26:13] Everybody have a great weekend and we'll talk to you soon.
