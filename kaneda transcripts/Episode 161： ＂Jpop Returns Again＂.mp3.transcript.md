[00:00] No, that's funny, but I just can't stand the pain.

[00:16] Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow.

[00:28] Welcome to episode 161 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:32] It's Friday. I'm Canada. I'm your host.

[00:36] This is an interesting podcast because I actually put up another podcast late last night.

[00:42] I was really upset. I was really frustrated when I heard the news about deep root in John

[00:47] Papaduke, like many of you out there. It is unbelievable that this whack-a-mull designer keeps popping up.

[00:55] I talked a lot about that later on in this podcast, but I had to take down that podcast because sometimes we let our emotions get the best of us.

[01:05] I don't disagree with anything I said. There are probably some of my friends over in Australia and other parts of the world that have my podcast set to automatic download.

[01:15] It will go as one of those lost episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast. What I want to do in this podcast is simple.

[01:23] There are a lot of things that I want to do over some news items. There's not too many. It's a slow time of years we head into expo.

[01:29] Then I want to talk about deep root and J-pop. The way I want to talk about it this time in a more civilized manner is I want to talk about this entire hobby.

[01:39] I want to put the context of a new Pinball manufacturer revealing itself to the world and the history of the different Pinball manufacturers that have popped up over the years and the outcomes of the past.

[01:52] What they produced for this hobby is what they produced for this hobby.

[01:57] Stick with me. I think it's going to be really entertaining. I think you're going to enjoy this podcast a lot.

[02:03] I think it's going to put everything in perspective in a short period of time. First, a few news items.

[02:10] Number one news item is Alien Pinball should be going on to a ship today. There should be a container leaving highway for coin taker.

[02:21] I'm Melissa Wistoll that today is the day the games will ship and go on the boat. That's good news. It's good news.

[02:28] Look, I don't think these games are not going to ship. I've seen the pictures. We know they're making them. This game will go out to the early buyers of Alien.

[02:41] Will this mean that highway pinball will succeed or fail? Look, that's to be determined.

[02:47] My guess, my speculation is that this company won't make it in the long run. I could be wrong. I could be wrong. All I've ever wanted.

[02:58] All I've ever wanted is people to get the machines they pay for. Also, not just that though. I do want people to get the best possible version of a machine and a theme that they love.

[03:10] That's what separates this podcast from me from a lot of other people out there that just cheerlead any game. I am so utterly disappointed still in Star Wars.

[03:24] I can't tell you how many friends email me, chat me, text me and tell me how much they don't like their Star Wars. How frustrating it is, how it's a drain monster, how they're really thinking of getting rid of it already.

[03:39] We're already starting to see people sell their games really quickly. All I want is games that are magical, games that are fun, games that are world under glass, games that bring the theme to life in an incredible way.

[03:52] Speaking of new games and bringing worlds to life under glass, I have another bit of news or rumors that I'm hearing.

[04:00] Number one is that Stern will not be bringing Guardians of the Galaxy to Expo this year. We're not going to see it in October.

[04:11] I don't know about this news. I go back and forth. I think Stern leaks a lot of misinformation to its distributors because let's be honest, all of the Stern news comes from distributors talking freely when they should not be.

[04:27] But if Christopher Franche is going to get up there and talk and not have anything to show in terms of Guardians, I'd be shocked.

[04:35] So that's what I'm hearing. The other bit of news, which is also interesting, is I am hearing that Pirates of the Caribbean, Jersey Jack Pinball Game Number Four, will be at Expo.

[04:48] Which is shocking to me because I would have thought that would dial in still moving out the door pretty quickly that Jack would not show another title.

[05:00] Now, the marketer in me thinks all these companies make a mistake of pulling the curtain off these games way too early and then the game feels old.

[05:09] Like how old is Houdini feel by now? These guys go in eight months, nine months, 12 months early and then by the time you get your game, the excitement that the buzz is lost.

[05:22] There's a reason why Apple shows you a new iPhone and you can get it next week, not a year from now. There is a window of hype and a window of excitement.

[05:32] And it diminishes the more we've seen it. I look at a car like the Acura NSX, which we saw for like five years before they finally made it.

[05:41] And by the time it's come out, it's just sitting on show and floor as nobody wants it.

[05:46] So I also understand the other side of it though, because if I'm Jack, my thinking too is, well, if I show it early and the rumor is that Jack will show it at Expo and the game will ship six months from then.

[06:00] Very similar to Dialbin, six month window between reveal and shipping. I think where Jack might have an advantage there. And again, I'm not sure is that if he shows it and pirates is something pretty cool, pretty awesome, pretty spectacular or something he's really excited about, he's going to make people wait for it versus going in and buying newer Stearns.

[06:23] Because Jack knows he's got the better product. He just does. And he, I think everybody would agree that a Jersey Jack game is just a better game in terms of quality, in terms of craftsmanship, in terms of innovation than anything that Stern is putting out there.

[06:42] So he might do that to freeze all that money and keep that money from going to newer Stern games. I mean, the best thing that could happen to Jersey Jack pinball is Stern pinball making Star Wars the way they did.

[06:55] If Stern pinball had made Star Wars to be as good as innovative as rock solid as creative as a Jersey Jack machine, they probably could have put Jersey Jack out of business.

[07:08] Because nobody would be going in on dialed in the way they were if Star Wars were equally as good of pin with that kind of theme.

[07:16] But as we saw dialed in is just a much better game, much better value, much better fun. And so I'm glad to see that this theme that everyone cried about, imagine that this original theme by Pat Lawler created a better game than Star Wars.

[07:34] Like that's pretty impressive. All right. Now let's go on to the news that happened yesterday. And this news just came out of left field for a lot of people.

[07:45] And I've been hearing rumors that John was working with someone new again and I just didn't believe it because you know it's a kind of thing that you don't want to believe.

[07:52] You kind of want that story, that man to just go away and he just won't it just it's just it's just unbelievable ability for this guy to resurface like a cancer over and over and over again in this hobby.

[08:06] And I used to think John was a good guy. I used to think John was a nice guy. I used to think John meant well. And then when I heard that John was basically saying F you to all magic girl owners.

[08:18] You know you start to realize the guy isn't this saint. He isn't this sweetheart. He isn't this nice guy that he's actually always painting himself as the victim.

[08:29] But here's what I want to do. We'll talk about John Papadoukin a little bit. But I want to talk about deep route. Deep route which is this new pinball or technology company run by a lawyer run by businessmen.

[08:44] It's an investment fund. It's all these things right. So the origins of deep route is plain and simple. Somebody with money.

[08:54] Somebody with money wants to make a pinball machine and a pinball company. All right. So what I want to do and I think this is important.

[09:01] I want to go down a list. My friend sent me a list of the realities of all these companies that have come out of the woodworks over the last let's say like five to seven years probably.

[09:13] In the last five years these are the end results of all these different pinball manufacturers that promised you pinball machines.

[09:23] Now and these guys weren't even promising you a pinball machine made by a guy who's the biggest flop in the industry who couldn't even finish one game in five years.

[09:33] But let's go down a list and this is also one of the reasons why all of you out there. I kind of want to get out of this hobby and I'm really serious.

[09:42] My time in pinball I feel like it's coming to an end because I'm losing the excitement and I'm losing the passion for this hobby because of things like deep route.

[09:53] Because of men like that that want to work with John Papaduke because it just shows me that there is no values in this hobby. There's no morals in this hobby.

[10:03] The fact that some of these people think that they can create a company with the most despicable guy in the industry is unbelievable.

[10:14] But let's go down the list. I keep digressing. Here is the reality.

[10:21] And after hearing this you tell me if you think deep route is going to be successful. So Zidware. Complete failure they burnt up a cool million dollars and never ended up shipping a single game.

[10:32] They didn't even finish a single game. Pintasia also failed to get Magic Girl or Zidware Optic Round and they lost another, pushed another hundred thousand dollars at least into that project.

[10:44] American pinball they repaid for all of the Magic Girl machines which was around, I believe they sank around three hundred thousand dollars into John's Magic Girl project.

[10:57] They had to remake Houdini from scratch. The new Houdini game is not done or available to buy yet but MG as they had manufacturing knowledge.

[11:06] So they made MGs but look at the game that ultimately came out. It wasn't finished. The code was a joke, a hack job. There are just loose wires everywhere.

[11:17] American pinball they're entire approach. These guys are probably as close to deeper it as we'll get. Very wealthy owner investor, duped by John, convinced that Magic Girl was almost ready, spent a year in American pinball's factory to deliver what a joke game he did.

[11:40] Then how quickly did these guys rip Houdini out of that Zidware cabinet and kick John to the curb when they finally went to expose and shows and heard the anger and the vitriol from the community which is the same anger and vitriol that deep route will here and we'll get to that.

[11:58] Highway pinball they spent four plus years less than 80 games shipped completely ran out of money full throttle sucks and alien debatable if you think that game is good.

[12:11] Dutch pinball built a complete game a beautiful game a great theme sold hundreds at full price. Farmed out manufacturing via build house they even designed a Bob 2.0 game on the side they ran out of money they collapsed.

[12:29] We all know what's going on over there hardly anybody got their big Lebowski's riot pinball completely finished wrath of Olympus could not even get 100 buyers right these guys had a finish game that they could have built with just 100 buyers only managed to make four games for themselves had no way to build them outside of spooky at 7500 a pop and the thing about riot that's interesting is I'm really upset that

[12:58] so many fucking fools through money at companies like Andrew highway and Jay pop when these guys to me these are the kinds of guys we should be supporting right the guys who worked hard who did it right who built the game first and then showed it to the community and said hey we just need help to get this off the ground and nobody supported these guys yet John pop a Duke got you know 20 people to give him 16 grand another hundred and twenty

[13:27] hundred and twenty five raza buyers to give another five thousand plus absolutely we should be ashamed of ourselves as a community that we you know we didn't invest in the company that had the real game that they could have built the wrath of Olympus is for people home pin what it's been four years five years now since home pin's been an entity no games don't complete pictures no end in sight there you know look home pin seems to be

[13:57] coming closer and closer to that finish line but it's September September October November December and Mike says there's still four months away from shipping this game and yet he's about to reveal it why would it why is it going to take so long is going to take four months for approvals and again by the time he does by the time he does I don't think the marketplace is going to be as interested in that title

[14:24] um... jersey jack pinball wizard of us completely ran out of money even after having it all up front with no interest

[14:33] you know millions upon millions upon millions of dollars were paid up front four years for was and the game was four years late pretty much

[14:42] okay jjp the habit he completely ran out of money again with the habit could not even by parts at one point destroyed all vendor relationships

[14:51] and credit rating needed to bring on another investor nearly three years late to deliver the habit

[14:58] jjp dialed in currently funded by newest investors

[15:03] terry says jjp i'm not even read this line um...

[15:07] but the bottom line is this is that the financials at jjp they might be in the whole pretty big after those years and years

[15:14] of struggling to get manufacturing going right pinball circus four to five years

[15:21] no details no prototype nothing nothing pinball circus where is that game

[15:27] right these guys have absolutely done nothing making those with those twelve prototypes

[15:32] time shock pinball just some picks of prototype parts promises nothing really not nobody even knows

[15:39] who's doing it and what is going on with time shock pinball

[15:42] maybe a few people in the inner circle no but that's it

[15:45] that's it spooky pinball

[15:47] they built their games on time right

[15:49] people consider a lot of them to be boring monotonous games with no magic or creativity

[15:53] total nuclear annihilation is only being built with non-refundable deposits games

[15:59] do not have any resale value on spooky right now

[16:03] their bad investments

[16:05] you're supposed to just buy them and enjoy them and lose money i don't think a lot of people got into pinball without approach

[16:11] so when you look at that that series of

[16:15] sort of misfortunes and failures and difficulties in making a pinball company and getting a pinball company off the ground

[16:22] you know the one we didn't talk about

[16:24] which is really the only

[16:25] successful company in town still

[16:29] is stern

[16:31] you know and it so that's the hobby we're in

[16:33] so what are deep roots chances of making it

[16:37] and what are they even trying to do

[16:39] okay now

[16:41] i can't tell you all the details and this is the part that frustrates me because

[16:46] if you knew what i knew

[16:48] you would be just as live it just as upset

[16:52] just as angry as i was last night and you would go down and you would curse out everybody on the deep root

[16:59] board

[17:00] all their personnel

[17:03] but i don't want to do that today what i want to do is tell you this

[17:06] they plan to make john's games

[17:08] they plan to make

[17:10] magic girls

[17:11] they plan to make rosas

[17:13] they plan to make alisson wonderlands

[17:15] their plan is to do what

[17:18] magic uh... sorry what would a what a american pinball tried to do what would

[17:22] pentatio tried to do

[17:24] because remember deep root was circling in that thread like two years ago when john was having trouble

[17:28] they were exploring

[17:30] uh... helping john out

[17:32] so what do you think that these guys

[17:34] can do

[17:35] so let's let's tackle this from a few

[17:37] vantage points

[17:38] if you were rich guy

[17:40] like this

[17:41] mister muller

[17:42] which is name on i don't even have their site open right now

[17:46] uh...

[17:47] but if you are wealthy individual

[17:49] things like robberton muller

[17:50] if you're wealthy individual

[17:52] and you wanted to start a pinball company

[17:54] okay double is like this and you want to get into pinball you see an opportunity you

[17:58] see a business opportunity to to create a pinball company

[18:02] and you want to start a pinball company why would you

[18:06] on your all title

[18:07] why would you hire your lead designer

[18:10] to be

[18:11] the man

[18:12] that the majority

[18:14] of people in the hobby despise can stand and hate

[18:18] so that's your first

[18:21] acquisition

[18:22] is john pop it

[18:23] okay

[18:24] it is like

[18:25] you want to you want to

[18:28] rejigger a new football team and you put

[18:30] concapernick as the quarterback to get people to become fans of the team right

[18:34] it's

[18:35] it's it's it's kind of like that you know john pop it you

[18:38] and it's no longer at the point now

[18:40] where people just don't know it or could get dooked or couldn't google search

[18:45] john pop it you can all the things he's done

[18:47] so the fact that these individuals

[18:50] uh... have decided to work with john

[18:52] i think it tells us a lot about the men behind this company about their values

[18:58] about their morals about their ethics

[19:01] and so

[19:02] i'd what i do like about the people in this hobby is they do

[19:06] they do often

[19:09] try and shut down

[19:11] organizations and people and operations that are doing things that are not

[19:15] really like ethical

[19:16] or right right there's just

[19:18] uh... on the side of right

[19:20] what i think these guys

[19:22] are doing is saying

[19:24] you know what look at all the

[19:26] excitement that was surrounding magic girl and john's games and there there

[19:30] was a reason why and

[19:32] i get it

[19:32] john's games are beautiful john's designs are incredible john

[19:37] things and makes pinball machines like nobody else

[19:40] i still consider magic or the best looking pinball machine of all time i wish it

[19:45] worked

[19:46] um... you know i wish that i i didn't have a half working

[19:50] sort of

[19:51] box of lights

[19:52] um... so

[19:53] there's no denying the fact that

[19:55] a working version of john's games

[19:58] uh... would be

[20:00] something people would want but that was five years ago

[20:04] and that ship has sailed

[20:06] and it never came to fruition now these games now these titles magic girl

[20:10] raza alis

[20:12] did where john pop it do

[20:14] now these things are all very very tainted

[20:17] these are things that

[20:18] have put a sour taste in people's mouths

[20:21] and people have lost

[20:23] a lot of money

[20:25] i also know and i can't go into the full details of this thing

[20:29] but if you got burned by j pop

[20:31] and these and this new company deep route

[20:33] their plan is to make j pop games i can tell you with certainty

[20:38] that this does not mean that they're you're gonna get your game isn't that crazy

[20:42] that you might have paid money

[20:44] for a john pop it game

[20:46] and they might make that game

[20:48] but even if you paid john it doesn't mean you're gonna get the game from them

[20:53] and so

[20:54] why would a rich

[20:56] man who wants to make a pinball company do that

[20:59] why would he do that did he not see

[21:01] the way american people try to do it it's like american pinball all over again

[21:06] and i think american pinball is a lot like these guys right this like shadow

[21:09] company like no one really knew if they existed they had filed

[21:13] you know paperwork in their l lc and they set up their company remember they

[21:17] had like a little note on a door or a little printout that said american

[21:21] and people started to investigate and it was real and then they saw like oh

[21:25] they

[21:26] you know they had john pop a do come board and then they start to get really

[21:29] real and then what happened right we saw the picture of the empty magic

[21:32] girl cabinets and then we all thought it was all gonna happen

[21:35] then they promised magic girls will would be made

[21:38] uh... and be delivered at expo what happened they didn't do it and then what

[21:42] happened

[21:43] you know they basically had a forced john to get the games out in february

[21:46] because of the pending lawsuit

[21:48] so and what happened at expo was that dove all

[21:52] you know scott goberg and the team in american pinball they got up there and they

[21:57] saw

[21:58] they saw how much

[22:00] people despised john and how disgusted people were with their decision to

[22:05] connect their company to john

[22:07] and then all they did since then was backtrack get rid of john get joe balsa

[22:13] in there and realize that it's just smarter to start a company without john

[22:18] because john pop a do brings a bag of shit that you don't want

[22:23] sure he comes with games that look so beautiful that's the thing

[22:27] john sells everybody on on on these beautiful things that don't work

[22:33] and people fall victim to it over and over and over again

[22:38] right

[22:39] you know he always tries to paint himself as the victim if you've ever talked to

[22:44] john he's the victim it's every bone

[22:46] else is fault

[22:47] but we know we know that he'll never take full responsibility i want to read

[22:52] something else

[22:54] um my my friend rodey said deep root is another nothing burger

[22:58] investors plus pinball machines equals disaster

[23:02] seriously all the money in the world can't get those guys off the ground if

[23:06] they don't know manufacturing

[23:09] we've seen it time and time again dove was different he is a

[23:13] manufacturing guy you know i've seen him in his company at two design part

[23:18] shows he was j pop's golden ticket on so many levels think about it

[23:22] john had it all a new guy a new company and who dini was on its way to being

[23:27] made and even then j pop was working with them behind the scenes for years

[23:33] before magic girl dropped and it almost didn't drop the only reason he sent

[23:37] them was because of the lawsuit

[23:40] all right so the other part too and this is something that people often forget

[23:44] people forget that jersey jack paid john pop it to give it as a two to

[23:48] evaluate the made the feasibility of making magic on and jack walked away jack

[23:54] who has the total ability to manufacture pinball machines so

[23:59] at the end of the day i think all of us just need to

[24:03] see what happens with this whole fiasco i think it's pathetic that he's back

[24:08] i do i would love one day to fix my magic girl

[24:14] but magic girl was always supposed to be this very limited rare exclusive title

[24:18] and if these guys want to mass produce it what are they going to do for all

[24:22] the people who bought into the original magic girls

[24:25] right are they going to pay them back sixteen thousand dollars twenty thousand

[24:28] dollars twenty five thousand dollars what people are paying for them

[24:31] because that's what they're worth when they're rare and then you're going to

[24:34] make a ton of them right so i don't think these guys are going to make it i

[24:40] think they're going to be another company that's going to announce and here's

[24:43] what they're going to do and mark my words they're going to say that

[24:46] we're making magic girls and they're taking deposits i guarantee you they're

[24:50] going to want to take deposits and if people give this company deposits shame

[24:54] on you shame on you shame on you right i mean think about it it's just it's so

[24:59] comical it's even hard to talk about it so these guys who have never made a single

[25:03] pinball machine before are going to make a magic girl pinball machine

[25:08] that completely needs to be re-engineered because the thing was never ever like

[25:13] even test it and it has never really worked probably so these guys who have

[25:17] never made a pinball machine before are going to fix that center mechanism that

[25:21] that doesn't work right for five years john couldn't get that ball to work

[25:25] they're going to fix the levitation chamber they're going to fix the magnetic

[25:27] hair area they're going to fix all those things they're going to make sure all

[25:30] those switches that that the ball can't even physically get to are going to be

[25:35] in working order they're going to do all that right they're going to figure out

[25:38] way to have the balls lock on the game because the ball locks are not even

[25:40] there they're going to invest all that money all that time into doing that

[25:45] bullshit you think they're going to do all that and how long is that going to

[25:49] take how many years is that going to take because magic girl as it is now

[25:53] as it is now is not just a quick fix see it's going to take a long time then

[25:58] from there raza the game that is an ip nightmare have you looked at raza have you

[26:03] looked at all the art on it john poppadook basically had the artist draw stuff that he

[26:09] didn't have the rights to there's no way they could release raza the way it was

[26:13] designed and the way the art package is on the game right now and so and raza let's be honest

[26:19] raza's not done raza's not close to being done and then Alice in Wonderland is just white

[26:24] foam core so good luck good luck it's just so sad that we're back here all over again i

[26:32] thought this movie was over i thought this story had ended i thought we were never going to hear

[26:38] from john poppadook again unless he was in a courtroom and unless people who were burned we're

[26:43] going to get some sort of some sort of final piece of mind and i want to end on this note i

[26:50] want to end on this note i feel so bad for the pinball communities friend for someone who's

[26:59] contributed so much to the pinball community far more than john poppadook has contributed to the

[27:04] pinball community over the last you know three four years i feel so bad for Jeremy Packer zombie

[27:11] Yeti i feel bad for him because i know this sucks and now he has to hear this shit all over again

[27:19] that this company is going to now be manipulating his artwork and he's not going to get paid

[27:24] for any of it and it once again he just wants to put this chapter behind him and they won't

[27:29] let it die and look at all that he's done for the hobby he's going to do for the hobby and he's

[27:35] such a great genuine good person a kind spirit and john poppadook is the complete opposite he is

[27:42] the complete opposite um and the fact that people with money keep backing john just blows my

[27:51] mind it blows my mind if i was a rich guy here's what i would do here's what i would do i'm this

[27:56] Robert Mueller i'm these these these guys with millions of dollars if you want to really start a

[28:01] pinball company you have millions of dollars you know what you could do you could go higher limon

[28:07] sheets you could go higher zombie Yeti you could go higher you could go get George Gomez if you wanted

[28:16] to do people really think that George Gomez is making like a million dollars here maybe i don't

[28:22] know but you don't say like if you have a lot of money and you want the best pinball people in

[28:27] industry you can go get them nobody would not leave for the right opportunity and the right money

[28:33] now i bet the guys it's stern probably love it because stern is a well oiled machine who would

[28:38] want to it's like it's like if i went from a big company that had tons of resources to a startup

[28:44] the only way i would do that is for a lot of money and equity in the company and even then i

[28:51] probably would wouldn't even want to do it because the amount of work and the lifestyle change

[28:55] would be horrendous um i'd rather be surrounded by resources so look this is news all the other

[29:02] podcasts will be talking about it everyone's going to be scratching their head i don't know when

[29:07] more information is going to come out but i'll say this i am rooting against deep root and i think

[29:12] you should too and i think this is a total joke i think it's going to be another Mickey Mouse

[29:18] operation uh and i think if we hear the words magic girl again um it makes no sense and here's

[29:26] the thing too why did these guys put up this website with their names and everything on it if they

[29:30] really wanted to make magic girl work and and create a working magic girl they would have just

[29:35] done it behind the scenes with john right and then revealed it and then ask for people's money

[29:41] but the fact that they're putting his name up there now leads me to believe they're going to

[29:45] want to ask for money before they even figure out the problem and again i think that's again a

[29:49] surefire way to create another new pinball company that's going to fail we don't need more bullshit

[29:55] pinball companies we need less we need less this hobby is starting to implode a little bit

[30:02] i think everyone can sense it the games are not bringing the fun that that that are not they're

[30:09] not bringing the fun for the amount of money people are spending people have been frustrated with

[30:12] like star wars um people you know you can get a go get a smoug special edition for six thousand

[30:20] dollars a fucking smoug edition is six grand and so is the jetsons so is dominoes pinball

[30:28] think about that for a minute the jetsons and smoug are the same price people are starting to lose

[30:34] thousands of dollars now on these new and box games thousands right this is no longer the error

[30:40] we're like i buy a pinball i play for your i lose only five hundred bucks they're losing thousands

[30:45] so if you buy five machines and you lose two thousand dollars on each machine you you really you

[30:49] just lost ten grand on on a non-essential toy all of a sudden it doesn't seem so great anymore

[30:56] all right so i'm just saying this hobby is headed for a period where less is more less machines higher

[31:03] quality right less manufacturers better games less bullshit more authentic passion in pinball

[31:12] all right and that's that's where we need to head and that's as a community where we need to push

[31:18] we need to push we need to align and and all sort of like lock arms and say we're not going to take

[31:24] this shit anymore we're not going to accept companies like deeproot we're not going to accept all

[31:28] the bullshit and it's up to all of us and i'm getting tired man i've canate is getting to the point

[31:34] where i am just going to go and say fuck pinball this is stupid all these failed companies all these

[31:41] games that never came out all these people throwing money at allusions you know it's it's almost like

[31:47] it's it's it's it's it's it's i feel ashamed to be a part of it and then it's look it is this

[31:52] is the collecting side of the hobby right i'm not a pinball tournament player i probably should go

[31:58] become one because now i look at it the only guys who are really loving this hobby are the guys

[32:04] that just go out and play pinball location and get good at it and go to tournaments the new

[32:08] unbox collector guys man they're the ones who are just like completely miserable lately because

[32:13] of all the shenanigans so that's going to be that i'm just going to go get my demon and and

[32:18] beyond the the dodge forms and and and and start hanging out with car enthusiasts fuck it

[32:24] but not yet not yet there's still hope to save me there's still hope but we got to get deep

[32:28] root out of this hobby all right have a great week and everyone we'll talk to you soon
