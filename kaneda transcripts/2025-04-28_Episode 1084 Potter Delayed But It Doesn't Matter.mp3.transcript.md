[00:00] I was far too scared to hit him, but I would hit him in a heartbeat now.

[00:06] That's the thing with anger, it begs to stick around.

[00:10] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:15] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] We are almost at International Harry Potter Day, and it doesn't feel like we're gonna get anything

[00:26] on that day from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:28] Here's what I'm hearing.

[00:30] I'm hearing this game is being held up by the license holder.

[00:34] They're asking for minor changes to a few things, and because of that, Jersey Jack Pinball

[00:42] is not able to show this game on Friday.

[00:46] I don't even know if that was the initial plan, but I am hearing now that the game might be a month

[00:54] away, a freaking month.

[00:57] Why did Jersey Jack get up there at Texas Pinball Festival

[01:01] and tell us to hold on to your money, people?

[01:05] Hold on, because I got Harry Potter coming.

[01:08] Why did we get that letter two weeks ago when King Kong dropped about how

[01:13] this is the culmination of Jersey Jack's dream, and then nothing?

[01:20] But here's the good news.

[01:23] Dune is not even close to selling out.

[01:26] King Kong, Ellie is not close to selling out, so you might as well continue to wait.

[01:34] And I think most people are going to wait.

[01:38] Now, here's the part that scares me.

[01:41] How many of these $15,000 games do they expect to sell

[01:50] if they make an unlimited amount of Harry Potter CEs?

[01:54] I do think that this is going to backfire, and I think we're seeing it throughout all the pinball.

[02:01] I think there's a threshold.

[02:03] I do.

[02:04] I think $10,000 is kind of all anybody wants to spend on a pinball machine,

[02:11] and I mean a high-end collectible pinball machine.

[02:15] Nobody wants to spend much more.

[02:18] $15,000 for a game that they might make thousands of.

[02:27] I'm worried that the distributors are going to order and overorder this game and be stuck with them.

[02:37] Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition right now.

[02:40] Zach Many has one for sale.

[02:44] $9,999 or best offer.

[02:49] It's not even moving, and there's only 500 of those.

[02:53] I've got one of those.

[02:55] I've been telling people for the longest time, I think by the time I go to sell my Guns N' Roses

[03:01] Collector's Edition, I'm looking at like, I don't know, 8,500 on the table.

[03:08] That's most likely what I'm going to get.

[03:10] And what's crazy about that is this game that was once selling for $18,000.

[03:17] I'm going to take a $4,000 hit on this game.

[03:22] Nothing is immune to what is going on to the market forces.

[03:28] Let's talk about King Kong LE.

[03:29] I mean, I put a side-by-side photo of King Kong LE and King Kong Premium,

[03:36] and they look exactly the same.

[03:38] There's a little bit of a difference on the front artwork by the coin door,

[03:43] and there's the inner art decals that you could easily get and the armor,

[03:47] but the main art on the cabinet, on the play field, exactly the same.

[03:54] And I think what's happening now to Eastern Pinball actually has to hit this head on.

[04:00] They have to address this head on.

[04:03] They have to start giving.

[04:05] The LE versions of their $13,000 games, they have to differentiate them

[04:12] a lot more than they're doing.

[04:15] Remember, this game is twice the price of a King Kong Pro.

[04:20] It's almost $3,500 more than the premium.

[04:26] And on my last show, I talked about the speakers inside the game.

[04:29] People told me they're like,

[04:31] Canada, those speakers are $35.

[04:36] $35.

[04:38] I spent more on lunch than the upgraded speaker system you get in a Stern LE.

[04:46] This needs to change.

[04:48] They need to give you exclusive toppers.

[04:51] They need to give you exclusive modes, and heck, for $3,500 more,

[04:56] you should get an exclusive mecher to in the game.

[05:01] The days are over.

[05:03] Everybody realizes now none of these things are hard to get.

[05:08] They're all losing value.

[05:09] And if you went in on a King Kong LE, trust me, it's going to be $10,000 in six months.

[05:16] You're going to lose $3,000 in six months.

[05:20] Oh, now we know what the storyline is.

[05:23] Did you see this?

[05:24] Keith Owens did an interview where their friend was at Gonzo over there in Europe,

[05:28] and he said, here's the storyline.

[05:29] Now we figured it out.

[05:31] You have already captured King Kong.

[05:34] He's already in New York City.

[05:37] And now the point of this game is to watch the recap, the black and white recap video

[05:45] of all the things that went on on Terror Island to capture King Kong.

[05:51] It's like everything in the game is a flashback to what it took to get King Kong to New York City.

[05:58] And look, I've watched this game now being played for a few hours.

[06:02] It doesn't feel anything like that narrative.

[06:06] When you start a game, sure, there's a little bit of that black and white film reel,

[06:11] but that's not pulled across the entire game.

[06:15] This game doesn't feel like a stroll down memory lane.

[06:18] You don't really start out with King Kong in New York City in a cage, on a stage,

[06:25] and that Indiana Jones figure is on stage saying, we've captured the beast.

[06:31] And this is what it took to capture the mighty Kong.

[06:35] Where is any of that narrative?

[06:37] See, I understand they have an idea of a framework of what the story is,

[06:42] but still, when you watch the game being played,

[06:46] does any of it feel like that?

[06:49] And it still doesn't make much sense to me because I'm watching the streams.

[06:53] And in just like 30 seconds, you're jumping around from being on a building,

[06:57] to tossing taxicabs, to being back on the island,

[07:01] to fighting spiders and lizards, and then you're back on top of the building.

[07:05] All this is happening at the same time.

[07:08] I get that you might not want a linear story, but at least make it more cohesive.

[07:14] I understand that Keith Elwyn is a great designer.

[07:18] I understand the gameplay is great.

[07:21] I'm just not sure when it comes to storytelling,

[07:25] these companies even know what the heck they're doing.

[07:28] I don't.

[07:29] You know, when you look at all the inserts in King Kong, how does that work?

[07:32] Like, they've got all these inserts, all these modes mapped out,

[07:37] but I'm not so sure they really know how to stitch it all together

[07:41] in a very cohesive narrative.

[07:44] And you just have to kind of take their word for it.

[07:46] Here's what's going on.

[07:48] Well, here's what's going on.

[07:49] The reason why there are a lot more Kong LEs for sale

[07:54] is that I'm hearing that not all of them went over to Europe.

[07:59] I heard because of the tariffs, there were not as many orders for these games overseas.

[08:05] So more of these games got allocated to US distributors.

[08:10] And that might be why you saw more LEs pop up for sale

[08:14] when they were initially sold out by some of these main distributors.

[08:18] But I still think because the LE is just so similar to the premium,

[08:22] it's not really creating that FOMO and that OMG.

[08:26] I have to have this nicest version of the game.

[08:30] So I'm hoping to play King Kong at Allentown this Friday.

[08:34] I'm going to be there.

[08:36] If you're going to be at Allentown, I will be there.

[08:39] Friday morning, Frank is picking me up in some vehicle.

[08:42] We're going to take turns.

[08:44] Someone's going to drive down there and someone's going to drive back.

[08:47] But I plan to get there around 10 a.m. when the show opens up.

[08:52] And the other game I'm really excited to play on Friday is Dune Pinball by Barrels of Fun.

[08:58] I'm not sure how much code is going to be in the game when I play it,

[09:02] but this is another game.

[09:04] I'm on pinside people and I've been watching the thread

[09:07] and Barrels of Fun is another game that is brand new.

[09:11] It does feel like the hype around this game is somewhat buried in the sand.

[09:16] And I'm curious to see how the game shoots, how it plays.

[09:20] The fun part about playing this game at a show versus playing it at Barrels

[09:26] is I'll be able to jump on all of these games, not just Kong,

[09:30] not just Dune, but Labyrinth and Elton John and all the other games at the show.

[09:36] Because I think sometimes when you cross shop games,

[09:39] it does allow you to formulate a little bit of a better opinion

[09:43] about how good a game shoots because you get to compare it to all these other games

[09:48] that are there at the same time.

[09:50] So look forward to my first impressions of playing this game,

[09:55] the things I'm curious about.

[09:57] I'm curious about the shot geometry.

[10:00] I'm curious about that sandworm.

[10:02] What is it like experiencing that in real life?

[10:05] Is it going to be too slow?

[10:07] Is it going to be magical?

[10:09] I'm curious about the lighting in the game now.

[10:11] Of course, playing this game at a show, it's not going to be the best lighting.

[10:15] It's going to be very bright.

[10:17] I want to see if that expression lighting system in the game

[10:20] actually reflects onto the play field or if you don't notice it from the player's point of view.

[10:27] And then obviously I'm really curious about the code.

[10:30] Are we going to see clips from the movies?

[10:33] We know they have it.

[10:34] The clips are synced up with the actors.

[10:36] That's great.

[10:37] I'm curious to see how it's integrated into the game.

[10:41] And the reason why I want to get there early is hopefully we can crank the volume

[10:46] and I can really hear all the atmospheric score of this pin at the show.

[10:51] So another game that'll probably be at the show,

[10:54] even though they're all sold out, is the world's new number one pinball machine of all time.

[11:02] Spooky Pinball's Evil Dead is now at the top of the pinside top 100 ranking.

[11:09] If there ever was a moment where this ranking makes no sense, it is right now.

[11:14] But that's just because you don't need a lot of votes to be validated on that top ranking system.

[11:21] You might have 100 or 200 votes for Evil Dead and you could get a 9.3.

[11:27] And that matters more than like 2000 votes for a medieval madness that might have a 9.1.

[11:34] I'll say this.

[11:34] It's all splitting hairs.

[11:36] Nobody thinks that Evil Dead is better than Godzilla because what's going to happen next

[11:42] is the stern army is going to catch wind that Evil Dead is now number one

[11:48] and the Elwynn fanboys are going to come out of hiding and they're going to vote this game down.

[11:54] You know, we don't really talk about the Elwynn effect, how he has his fans,

[12:00] how his fans don't allow for a lot or any even constructive criticism of what this man does.

[12:10] I'm just going to say this.

[12:11] As I look at King Kong, I am sure the game shoots phenomenally well.

[12:18] Absolutely.

[12:19] But from an engineering standpoint, there's nothing really magical in this game, King Kong.

[12:27] There's not.

[12:28] They repurposed the Incredible Hulk mech from Avengers from like 12 years ago.

[12:34] You got the gong, you got the spider that's just a magnet.

[12:39] That's a cheap little cake topper on top of it.

[12:43] And then they added in the subway car last minute and that's it.

[12:47] That's it.

[12:49] Where's the magic?

[12:50] Where's the OMG?

[12:52] Where's the thing that we've never seen before?

[12:55] Where's the freaking Empire State Building?

[12:57] And again, because it's Keith Elwynn, you can't say anything like that.

[13:02] And the truth is this, he hasn't engineered anything nearly as impressive as Godzilla

[13:09] since Godzilla.

[13:10] He hasn't and Godzilla was $10,500 for the freaking LE.

[13:17] This game is $2,500 more than Godzilla.

[13:21] Does it look like there's more in it?

[13:24] More magical stuff engineered in it?

[13:27] But you're not allowed to say that, Chris.

[13:30] You gotta blindly support everything he does.

[13:34] He's the goat and the goat can do no wrong.

[13:37] I'm not saying he did any wrong.

[13:39] I'm just saying he didn't do anything that special or magical on this game.

[13:44] Because designing unique layouts to this guy is easy.

[13:47] But what really makes a game a masterpiece is the combination of the layout with the magical toys.

[13:55] And I'm just not seeing it in King Kong.

[13:58] I see a lot more creativity in the sandworm that barrels of fun engineered than anything going on in King Kong.

[14:06] The balls in Harry Potter's court, man.

[14:08] I mean it.

[14:09] The ball is in JJP's court.

[14:12] I think one of the reasons why they're waiting on Potter now is they realize

[14:18] Kong did not land with the same enthusiasm as Godzilla.

[14:24] I think they were worried.

[14:26] I really do.

[14:27] And I don't think they're worried about King Kong now.

[14:30] I don't think King Kong is going to be like Keith Owens, like second best-selling pin.

[14:35] I don't.

[14:36] I think it's going to do all right.

[14:37] I do.

[14:38] I think it's going to shoot phenomenally well.

[14:40] But I also think a lot more people are going to wait on the sideline and pick up one of these

[14:46] when they lose a few thousand dollars and they're going to people.

[14:51] I think Jersey Jack now is being a little bit more patient.

[14:54] They're probably just fine-tuning some details.

[14:58] I have a little bit of bad news.

[15:00] Miracle Playfield will be making Playfields for Harry Potter.

[15:05] Now, will Bader be making the CE Playfields like they did with Avatar?

[15:11] I don't know.

[15:13] I can't imagine they're going to with this unlimited run because Bader can do smaller

[15:19] batches.

[15:20] They can't do like three to four thousand of one model of Jersey Jack game.

[15:25] So I'm a little worried.

[15:27] I think Miracle is going to be back doing all of the Playfields.

[15:31] I feel like Elton John Playfields didn't really have many issues.

[15:35] So hopefully there's no issues with Playfields and Harry Potter.

[15:39] I would hate to see Harry Potter come out and be plagued by any issue like Playfields

[15:46] chipping or some mech that doesn't work right.

[15:49] I really hope this game has been properly tested.

[15:53] Now we both probably know it hasn't been.

[15:57] We know this right.

[15:58] None of these companies properly test these games because they care more about secrecy

[16:04] than adequately testing these games.

[16:06] So speaking of testing games, I am here to tell you that Back to the Future is being

[16:12] made by Dutch Pimble and it is currently in Whitewood stage.

[16:18] Now, does that mean it's coming sometime soon?

[16:22] I don't think so.

[16:23] I don't think you're going to see Back to the Future any time in 2025.

[16:27] You know how I feel.

[16:29] I think you're going to see Raza and Melvin make like two to three hundred Raza's before

[16:35] we get to Back to the Future.

[16:37] It's just not going to be ready in time.

[16:39] I think they'll finish the Alice games and then there's going to be a gap.

[16:44] And you can't have a gap when you're a manufacturing facility because every month

[16:49] without a game on a line, I think they're burning something like 100,000 euros.

[16:54] And so they need a game on the line.

[16:57] I think that game will be Raza.

[16:59] Then I think we're going to get to Back to the Future.

[17:01] I hate to say this people, but I don't think Back to the Future is going to come out until

[17:07] summer of 2026.

[17:10] That is my prediction.

[17:11] I hope it comes out sooner, but I don't see it any time before summer of 2026.

[17:19] Do you think George Gomez is going to be able to fix X-Men?

[17:23] He's heard all the complaints and he's putting three people on the code to make this game better.

[17:31] And he's personally overseeing this.

[17:34] I'm like, all right, well, this game came out in like September of last year.

[17:41] Do you really think Stern is going to be able to turn around the uncanny X-Men?

[17:48] The value on the games have plummeted.

[17:50] Owners are frustrated.

[17:52] The game has a really unique layout, but it never came together.

[17:58] Do you think that Stern Pimbal is going to be able to do a Miacopa and fix this entire game?

[18:05] I just don't think it's going to happen.

[18:07] I really don't.

[18:08] There's too much existing in the code as it is that just doesn't work.

[18:14] I feel like they're going to have to start completely over.

[18:18] And it just feels like why would they do that?

[18:21] They've already got the money from the people who bought the games.

[18:26] There's no way they're going to sell a lot more of these.

[18:29] I bet they're a little bit worried because there's probably a bunch of these games sitting in a box

[18:34] unsold that they're never going to be able to move at MSRP.

[18:39] So maybe that's why they're going to invest time in it.

[18:42] I also know there's just something called pride.

[18:45] And Stern Pimbal does take pride in its machines and they don't want to burn people

[18:51] with code that is underwhelming.

[18:53] But I just think everything about this game was rushed.

[18:57] And I don't think they're going to be able to go back and fix it.

[19:00] The other Stern game you don't really hear a lot about recently is the most recent one.

[19:06] And that's Dungeons and Dragons.

[19:08] Remember when this game came out, right?

[19:10] The Dragon Mag.

[19:11] Oh yeah.

[19:12] Awesome.

[19:12] This is it.

[19:13] This is the savior own adventure.

[19:15] Choose your own pathway.

[19:17] This game is going to be amazing every Sunday.

[19:21] And then why you don't hear anybody talk about this game that much?

[19:26] Because what's happening is this.

[19:28] Everyone who owns one is on the adventure.

[19:31] They're saving their progress.

[19:33] They're seeing most of the game.

[19:36] And I think then they're reaching a point where it's just kind of getting boring.

[19:42] And it's like chopping wood.

[19:44] And they have to do all these things they don't want to do over and over again

[19:48] to get to the few new things that they do want to do.

[19:52] And you don't hear people talk about it.

[19:54] But you know how I know this game is falling quickly out of favor?

[19:59] The LEs are now sliding down to 10.

[20:01] I think I saw one for 10-5.

[20:03] This game just came out.

[20:05] And now all of a sudden every single LE sliding down to 10.

[20:10] People should have listened to Canada for five dollars a month.

[20:14] I have saved so many of you thousands of dollars.

[20:18] That's not me asking you to raise your subscription amount even though I just did.

[20:23] I love it when it pisses people off.

[20:25] But think about this is where the fun is.

[20:26] I don't know about you guys but I'm having so much fun just observing all of these companies

[20:32] trying to make money.

[20:34] Trying to convince us that a pinball experience is worth well over 10,000 dollars.

[20:40] Trying to keep collectors engaged as every single collector has lost three to four thousand dollars

[20:46] on every single LE except for one game.

[20:49] Well no two games.

[20:51] There's only been two games over the last three years that even held value.

[20:57] Jaws LE and Metallica remastered LE.

[21:00] By the way that game now is sliding back down to 13.

[21:04] Sliding back down to 13.

[21:06] It was going for 18-19 when it first came out.

[21:09] The writing is on the wall.

[21:12] The threshold is 10,000 dollars.

[21:16] Nothing can hold at 13.

[21:18] Nothing.

[21:19] Nothing's going to hold at 13 for very long.

[21:22] The only stuff that's holding are themes that are both to the floor for people.

[21:27] They don't come up very often.

[21:29] It's a great time to be a buyer.

[21:31] It's a great time to engage in my new phrase WPD.

[21:36] Wait.

[21:37] Play the game and then decide.

[21:39] It's a really good time now.

[21:41] You don't have to run at anything.

[21:43] Who has to run at Harry Potter CE if they're going to make an unlimited amount?

[21:47] So wait everybody.

[21:49] Play the games and then decide.

[21:52] Decide if you want to buy it.

[21:55] Decide if you want to play on location.

[21:57] And also the most important decision even if you want to buy it.

[22:01] Decide is now the right time to buy it.

[22:04] Because if I'm listening to Canada,

[22:07] King Kong LE is going to be 10K in six months.

[22:10] 100% it's going to be that.

[22:12] And then all these other games, trust me,

[22:15] D&D LE is going to slide down to eight.

[22:18] Guns and Roses CE sliding down to eight.

[22:21] Everything else.

[22:22] X-Men LE sliding down to eight.

[22:24] Foo Fighters LE sliding down to eight.

[22:27] They oversaturated everything.

[22:29] The only thing that's not sliding to eight is

[22:31] Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[22:33] It's going to stay at $5 a month.

[22:34] Have a happy Monday everybody.

[22:36] We'll be back.

[22:36] More coming this week.

[22:38] Canada out.
