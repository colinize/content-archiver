[00:00] I just opened up the Jurassic Park Thread, the owner's club, and someone just unboxed a brand new Jurassic Park Pimball Machine.

[00:29] It's placing us together after some time.

[00:59] coverage from the pinball media out there. And I think I'm not blaming them. But I think

[01:06] that this is a topic that people just don't want to address because it's an inconvenient

[01:11] truth about something that is happening in the pinball industry right now that is affecting

[01:17] multiple manufacturers. You know, all this started because one guy, Harry Houdini, on pin

[01:25] inside was not satisfied with his response from Jersey Jack pinball on these issues. And

[01:31] he kept hitting that drum over and over. Started a thread, started a poll. We started to

[01:38] get more owners of Jersey Jack pinball's pie to the Caribbean to come out and share with

[01:44] us visual proof that their games too were being affected by this issue. Okay. Issues that

[01:53] people did not see on previous versions of Jersey Jack games issues people did not see

[02:00] on previous versions of Stern's pinball machines. And so I think we have enough information

[02:07] and enough data and enough visual proof and evidence to do a podcast completely dedicated.

[02:16] Well, there might be a little news items at the end of this, but completely for the most

[02:19] part dedicated to doing a halt on your new inbox purchases until we find out what is happening

[02:29] with these games. And maybe you think it's premature. Maybe you think I'm yelling fire

[02:34] inside a theater, but there is something different in the clear code of these games that is causing

[02:42] this issue. Now, here's the main issue I have with this whole thing is I don't make clear

[02:48] codes for a living. You don't make clear codes for a living and I don't mean clear codes,

[02:53] but you don't make play fields for a living and I don't have expertise and inside knowledge

[02:58] on what would cause this to occur in a pinball machine. And for most of us out there, I think

[03:04] we all fall into the same boat. We're like, well, I bought all these games all these years

[03:08] and I never had this issue. Now all of a sudden on these new games I'm buying, I have

[03:14] an issue and it's causing the post to create puddling around them. It's where the clear

[03:18] code like ripples. And after that, what happens is it chips. And when it chips, it takes

[03:24] the artwork with it. And now that is happening on games from Gardens, the galaxy we see it

[03:31] on. We saw it on total nuclear annihilation, pirates of the Caribbean, we're seeing it on

[03:35] Willy Wonka's brand new out of box. I mean, there's another thread that a guy said, I just

[03:41] bought a Willy Wonka. It's one month old and the artwork has chipped on it already.

[03:47] Okay, this isn't me making this up. This isn't me ambulance chasing. This isn't me trying

[03:53] to bring down companies. This is these are actual photos and testimonial evidence from

[04:00] owners of these games. Okay, so so something is changed. Something is changed and you're

[04:06] seeing it in the very products that you're buying. And for a lot of these collectors out

[04:11] there, and you know me, I've always been on the side of the collector of pinball. I'm

[04:15] not here to talk about tournaments. I'm not here to do two and a half hour podcasts

[04:19] about strategies and how to tackle a pinball machine. I'm here to talk about the pinball

[04:25] collector. Okay, and discuss things that are on your radar. The guy who loves to buy pinball

[04:33] machine, sell pinball machines, you know, speculate on what's next. And I in the five years

[04:39] covering this, the only other time I remember an issue like this that created a little bit

[04:44] of a, you know, stop buying this game until the problem is figured out was when we had

[04:50] the ghosted insert issue on ghost busters. And don't don't get me wrong. Ghost busters

[04:56] ghosted insert was a real issue. It was a real problem. It happened during a period

[05:02] in which you never heard this, but this is the truth. It appeared in which Stern was in

[05:06] between, I think play field, man, vendors with them and they got a whole bad batch of games.

[05:13] And so that almost, I'm going to say this like that financially that delay on ghost

[05:20] busters because of the ghosted inserts, you know, crippled Stern and guess what? Are

[05:25] you seeing ghosted inserts on Stern machines nowadays? Absolutely not. You know why? Because

[05:30] the people spoke and the people told Stern this is not good enough and Stern, you know,

[05:37] you can say what you want about Stern. What did Stern do? They sent people who had ghosted

[05:43] insert problems, fully populated play fields. Do you know how expensive that is to do?

[05:50] But they did the right thing and they made those customers. It took a while and there's

[05:56] a lot of fighting with some customers. It took a while, but they did the right thing

[06:01] and at a humongous cost to Stern Pimbal, they fixed the problem. Now here's the problem

[06:06] now is we know that Jersey Jack Pimbal is not and never will send people fully populated

[06:14] play fields if their brand new game is chipping. They don't have the money and the resources

[06:21] to do something like that. Stern can do it. They have a huge factory. They have multiple

[06:25] lines and they also Stern has the most to lose, right? If they have 85% of the market share,

[06:31] they can't afford to have a popular game like Ghostbusters just destroy all the good will

[06:37] between them and the customer base. So they did the right thing. But here we are today.

[06:43] You're opening up a game new in box, Jurassic Park, Guardians of the Galaxy, Willy Wonka,

[06:49] higher to the Caribbean and you see the issue. And across the board right now, this issue

[06:55] does seem to be impacting Jersey Jack games more. But the first question I want to ask

[07:02] is this. Is this issue derivative of one vendor's problem? Is this coming from Mirko Playfields?

[07:13] Who is to go to first to find an answer on this? Do you go to the manufacturer or do you

[07:21] go to the vendor who bought the play fields? Sorry, sorry guys. Do you go to the manufacturer

[07:27] or the vendor who made the play fields? Now here's the thing. I think first and foremost,

[07:33] if you're having an issue with your game, you need to go to your distributor and tell him,

[07:36] hey look, look what's happening. This isn't right. I've had, you know, I've bought multiple

[07:40] games. I've had games throughout the years. This should not be occurring on the play field.

[07:45] From there, you go to the manufacturer. The manufacturer is responsible. It is the manufacturer.

[07:52] And here's why it is the manufacturer who is ordering the play fields from the vendor.

[07:58] The manufacturer needs to tell the vendor by which the standards they need to see met

[08:04] in order for them to pay for those play fields. So it is Jersey Jack's responsibility to make

[08:11] sure that the play fields they get from Mirko or anyone else arrive at their factory to

[08:17] the standards in which they need them to be. And if they are seeing the clear coat start

[08:24] to puddle and ripple and chip on brand new games that have only had, you know, post installed

[08:31] in them a few weeks ago or a week ago, they need to say stop, stop the line, stop production.

[08:39] We can't keep putting these play fields into these games if this is going to occur. Now they haven't

[08:45] done that, right? We saw the problem with pirates of the Caribbean. And I think everyone just assumed

[08:52] that Jersey Jack would get to the bottom of this problem. Saw the same problem with Beatles.

[08:58] And now I'm seeing it with Jurassic Park. So something's going on that's really big.

[09:04] Something is happening here. It is almost as if the manufacturers have no clue what is causing

[09:12] this problem. And because they have no clue what is causing this problem, they have no communication

[09:18] on this problem. Think about it. Who's talking about this issue? Are the manufacturers telling you

[09:25] anything? No. Are they communicating with you? No. You're getting some like back sort of like

[09:31] backdoor deal where you can buy a new new new new stock play field from Jersey Jack for 550 bucks.

[09:41] But the problem isn't fixed. So that's the other that's not a solution. Hey, here's here's play

[09:47] fields that have clear code issues. Hey, buy another one. Even that'll have the same issues if you

[09:52] install it on your play field because here's what's happening and someone showed this on the Willy

[09:56] Wonka. The clear code is just it's too soft. It's just too soft. And I'm not sure what people,

[10:04] you know, people always said this. They said this with ghostbusters. You got to give it enough time

[10:08] to cure. I mean, I don't know. Do you know how much time it takes a play field to cure properly?

[10:14] Is it one week? Is it two weeks? Is it three weeks? Are manufacturers? Are they speeding up

[10:19] production because they need to get production on the line? So are they putting these play fields

[10:23] together too quickly and not allowing the play field secure long enough? Now if that were the case,

[10:30] then the manufacturer is solely to blame because Mirko or whoever's manufacturing the play fields

[10:37] must be telling these companies you have to let them sit for X amount of weeks before you install

[10:45] any features on the play field because otherwise you'll get this result. Is that the case? I

[10:52] don't think that's the case. I'll tell you why. There is someone who bought a backup pirate to

[10:58] the Caribbean play field and he's had it for a while for weeks or a few months and he's still to

[11:04] this day says I can push my fingernail into the clear code and it is super soft. It is super soft

[11:11] and there is no way it is a curing issue. Okay, so that's just what he says. So what is the problem?

[11:20] What is the problem? Is the problem? What George Gomez said on this podcast almost two years ago

[11:26] is the problem that customers want to see shiny glass like play fields that have thick clear code on

[11:35] it and when you make thick clear code that will create a much taller layer of the varnish and the

[11:43] clear and that'll create much more dimples. Now is that thicker clear when you're going to screw

[11:49] in a post? Is it only natural that that post is sinking into it because there's just extra layers

[11:55] of clear for it to sink into? But I have to believe there needs to be a way to make that clear

[12:01] code harder. There has to be. So then is it are they making it softer? Is there something with like

[12:07] the way the ink is adhering to the wood which adheres which then has to be a certain way and the

[12:12] clear code has to be a different compound to sit over that artwork. You know when you look at

[12:18] spooky pinball they've got with total sorry, Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. Interesting right?

[12:24] Look at that game around the slingshot area, around the post area. There's no artwork.

[12:31] It's pure, it's plain wood. They've did a cut out. Did they do that on purpose because they realize

[12:37] it's the artwork underneath the clear that is causing the weakness there? I don't know right?

[12:44] It becomes like a wild goose chase to try and figure out what the issue is. So here's my thing.

[12:51] Here's my main point today on Canadian pinball podcast. I don't want to have to go on a wild

[12:56] goose chase to figure out what the issue is. I can clearly see there's an issue in other people's

[13:01] games. I don't want to have to wait weeks and months for for manufacturers to address this issue.

[13:07] I don't want to have to wait for the other pinball media to actually make this a main topic of

[13:12] discussion. Meanwhile people you know they're gushing over how great these games are. Meanwhile

[13:17] people are buying games and these issues are occurring and now they've got nothing but a super

[13:22] expensive headache. I don't want to do any of that. Here's what I want to tell you to do.

[13:26] I want to tell you to stop buying new inbox games until this problem is solved. Stop buying new

[13:32] inbox games until you get a direct solution to this problem. Why are you going to roll the dice

[13:40] with this much money just hoping you're going to be a fortunate son and get a game that's perfect.

[13:46] And I don't care if that guy's game over there is perfect in Chicago or that guy in Oregon has

[13:51] no issues. All I care about is that there's consistency. Would you buy a car?

[13:58] Would you buy a car if your neighbor's Corvette clear code is perfect but yours is chipping and

[14:03] you know what you just have to live with it that's total BS. So I'm just saying right now there

[14:11] needs to be a halt of production using whatever vendor is serving up these play fields to manufacturers.

[14:18] There needs to be a halt until we figure out what is causing this issue. I think it is irresponsible

[14:25] for these manufacturers to continue to put these kinds of problems into the game and then passing

[14:33] those problems onto you the customer who is spending all this money because as we all know

[14:39] the most difficult thing to do the most expensive thing to do is a play field swap. So I'm saying

[14:46] right here what is it August like 22nd or 21st saying right now August 21st Wednesday. I think

[14:54] you'd be silly to buy a new inbox game right now until you get confirmation from these manufacturers

[15:01] on what the issue is and I know the manufacturers listen to this podcast and maybe I don't have that

[15:07] much influence but maybe let's show them we do. We have 2500 people that listen to every episode of

[15:13] Canadian pinball podcast and I'm not trying to hurt pinball manufacturers. I'm not. I want them to

[15:18] be successful but when we have a well documented issue that just needs to be addressed and no one

[15:25] seems to want to address it that's where I draw the line and I'm always on the side of the buyer

[15:32] not the company because here's what I think might be happening they might be saying well this is

[15:37] just falls within the acceptable limits of play field quality control and I know I know they might

[15:45] be thinking that but I'm here to tell them right now Stern Jersey Jack spooky pinball Chicago game

[15:51] whoever it is when it happens to you it's unacceptable I don't accept that as as an answer

[16:00] something has changed in the way these games are made something is happening now that's been

[16:06] happening for you know almost a year to half two years you need to figure out what the problem is

[16:13] I don't care if that's going to cost you money I don't care if that's going to cost you business

[16:19] but you need to either find a new vendor you need to figure out what the issue is you need to develop

[16:25] a new test in which you can test these play fields to see if the posts are going to sink into the

[16:32] clear like this within just a few weeks of ownership you know it's on you manufacture it's on you

[16:39] to ensure that the product that goes out to customers has been put through all of the necessary

[16:46] test to ensure the quality will be there and now it's not just about apparently it's not just

[16:52] about how mechanisms will hold up how will the play field clear cut clear coat hold up over time

[16:58] screw in post screw in post with extra torquing see how much pressure it takes before that

[17:04] clear coat brittle it becomes brittle and breaks or or will it sink in I mean someone showed a photo

[17:10] and it is unbelievable the post by the slings it's moving the clear code like a body of water it's

[17:18] pushing that clear coat in the direction in which the sling rubber is pulling on the post it is

[17:25] too malleable it's too soft okay and I just wouldn't buy anything until it's figured out

[17:32] you know I'm looking let me look over my my Batman 66 right now let me let me look over that

[17:36] machine I mean this build about two years ago and let me see if there's any rippling in any of the

[17:42] posts in this game okay because this does have softer clear code I've seen Batman's and I've seen

[17:49] you know this game like become a dimple cratered mess and I'm looking at the post in my slings

[17:54] look at I'm doing it right now you know I don't really see anything nothing to be worried about

[18:02] now here's the other part that sucks is right people open up a new and box pinball machine the new

[18:06] box experience and what do we get now it's just all these zoomed in photos of to see like what's

[18:12] going on with like the post and the clear coat so something's going on and I just wouldn't buy

[18:18] anything until they figure this problem out and I think all the manufacturers need to stop doing

[18:25] this one thing they need to stop the silence silence is BS it is not an acceptable response to your

[18:33] customers every time I read about people trying to call over to Jersey Jack and get a response

[18:38] and no one picks up the phone and no emails and they open up a ticket and there's nothing I just

[18:43] want to like pick my computer up and throw it against the wall you can't have silence be a

[18:49] response to a customer is a complaint and I don't care if that customer is annoying I don't care

[18:56] if that customer doesn't you don't have a solution for them yet I don't care if they're

[19:00] barraging you with with new want you know annoying like request it doesn't matter here's why

[19:07] they gave you their money they paid for an expensive toy that you made you're now responsible

[19:14] like it or not you're responsible now customers still should go through distributors how in the

[19:20] distributors as well don't just call directly into Jersey Jack every day you know I sent Jack an

[19:26] email and I asked him if he would give me a comment on on this issue I didn't hear back from him

[19:32] but here's I send it to him last night it's August he might be away he might be traveling he might

[19:35] not be there I'm not going to like crucify him because of that but let me tell you this because of

[19:41] this podcast and we're going to keep banging this drum and we're going to tell you not to buy I'm

[19:46] going to tell you not to buy these games until we get an answer and we will get an answer and we

[19:50] will not stop until we get an answer on this issue and I encourage the other pinball podcasts out

[19:56] there to also talk about this issue and also pressure these companies to do this until we get

[20:02] an answer I encourage the pinball streamers that are out there to do it I encourage Jeff at this

[20:07] week in pinball to make this a front page story Jeff this is news people are buying games that are

[20:14] having clear coat issues and nobody wants to take responsibility this is way more dam and poured

[20:20] and then stupid haggis pinball or that you know cosmic carnivals only going to have a hundred woo-hoo

[20:26] nobody cares bro put this on the front page all right and I want to thank Harry Houdini and all

[20:32] the other people in those threads for not letting this topic die I know you guys are in a rough spot

[20:38] and it seems like nobody wants to highlight it so uh canate is pinball podcast has just highlighted

[20:44] it for everybody out there and you best believe they're going to pay attention and this is the

[20:48] responsibility of the media this is part of what we're here to do we're not just here to show the

[20:54] games we're not just here to like gush over everything we're also here to bring up topics that you

[20:59] that aren't the want you know aren't always positive that are inconveniences for these pinball

[21:06] companies because if we don't do it who will who has your back who has your back you think pin

[21:11] sides are going to have your back you think robins are going to go do that you think Jonathan

[21:15] Justin of pinball magazine you keep defending Barry at Dutch pinball is going to look out for you

[21:21] the guys looking out for Barry have you read that thread he keeps giving Barry the benefit of the

[21:26] doubt he keeps failing to realize that the reason a ray said enough with these clowns is they didn't

[21:32] get paid I don't know what world we live in I guess like the Dutch law when you declare bankruptcy

[21:37] all of your debts are absolved kind of world is that you you get like this like universal bailout

[21:42] what a way to incentivize business people to make the dumbest business decisions and screw over

[21:47] their customers because they'd hey the Dutch government will like look out for you this is why

[21:51] in America I can't even say that we build out so many companies but anyway I just want to let you

[21:56] guys know I got your back and I'm going to make this a topic and I think everyone should stop

[22:00] buying their games hey what's the worst that could happen if you stop buying your willy wonka

[22:04] le they're only making five thousand of them I would why would you buy one until this problem is

[22:09] figured out I just talked to a customer yesterday who bought one and he's got the issue and he's

[22:14] just like oh you know now he's got to live with it now he's got to live with it and here's the big

[22:19] issue oh my god you really think they're going to have this problem figured out before they ask

[22:24] people for twelve thousand five and an hour collectors editions versions of the game no they don't

[22:29] have it figured out those clear those playfields have to have been ordered already and should be

[22:33] curing by now and so people are going to spend the most expensive amount of money on any pinball

[22:39] game available today and they're going to have playfield puddling and shipping issues and

[22:44] pirates of the care being collectors edition owners went through the same thing so I think it's

[22:49] crazy and I think everyone needs to stop and get an answer all right wow wow just did it focused on

[22:56] one topic for twenty three minutes a couple of things I want to talk about and then we'll end this

[23:00] episode of can you just pinball podcasts oh man what else is going on so let me read let me

[23:07] a note from some of you guys but before that I do that let me do a couple news items so first and

[23:11] foremost I encourage you guys if you like this show and you are on Facebook I encourage you

[23:18] to become a member or like me please like me can a dis pinball podcast has a Facebook page and the

[23:27] reason why I encourage you to do that is I'm going to start you know uploading every episode to

[23:32] to that page but it's a good place for us to have a discussion about the topics we talk about on

[23:38] this show so if you do that you know join in on the conversation it's a really good conversation

[23:44] it's it's and it's everyone's very respectful and it's a really good place we have like about

[23:48] 550 of you are friends of the page but I just want to let you guys know if you want to reach out to

[23:54] me or talk to me more often we can do that on Facebook as well because I do chime in on all the

[23:59] comments that happen on that page right okay I saw a two games for sale that I think are ludicrous

[24:06] there's a big bang bar I think it's new in box for $22,500 and then there's a theater of magic

[24:13] a high-end panic hep restored theater of magic for $15,500 and you know we've said this before

[24:20] on this show these high-end games and this big bang bar those are two games that Chicago gaming

[24:26] company has already said they're going to remake and when big bang bar gets remade by Chicago

[24:32] gaming company it's gonna cost like $8,000 so you could you could spend $14,500 more on one

[24:40] or you could just wait and same with theater of magic and you know this theater of magic it's

[24:45] beautiful it's it's got a lot of brass plating but they didn't brass plate the coin door you can't

[24:50] charge me $15,500 for brass plated theater of magic and not brass plate the coin door

[24:57] so you know it's not gonna sell and I just saw another theater of magic sell like a couple

[25:03] weeks ago for $8,500 and so you know I think when people have failed to realize is and they

[25:09] haven't I think you guys are really smart these games will sit forever they will nobody is going

[25:14] to pay you what you paid high-end pinball for the game I know you might have paid $15,000 for it

[25:22] but sorry I just hate to break it to you but a hepp restored theater of magic now it's probably

[25:27] worth more like $10,000 to $11,000 with the remakes looming and they're coming they are coming

[25:33] and they're gonna be better versions of those games you might as well just if you buy a Chicago

[25:38] gaming company theater of magic and then go get it brass plated all in all it'll cost you like

[25:44] $9,000 if you buy a hepp one you're gonna lose $6,500 bucks on top of that no way sorry I mean

[25:51] I love his work I would love for Chris to chime in on the play field issues because if anyone

[25:59] has experience you know where is Chris with Hutchins and and and then cruise mon or cruise

[26:05] cruise mon where are the two guys the two guys that do amazing restorations I would love for

[26:10] them to chime in I would love for them to be a guest of the show and chime in about these play

[26:14] field issues and talk to us about why they think this is occurring in the play field because here's

[26:19] here's a thing they know how to clear a play field they they they have the skill set they're not

[26:26] skill list like this pinball podcaster and oh yeah Harry Houdini once again I would happily have

[26:32] you come on the show to talk about this I would love to have your point of view and it's

[26:36] canada pinball at gmail.com I know he doesn't really listen to pinball podcasts but if you know

[26:41] Harry just tell him to hit me up I would love to have him as a guest all right so those games

[26:46] are not gonna sell that's just that's just that all right all right now deep route deep route pinball

[26:54] there's a reason why deep route has deactivated their pinside account and no it's not because

[27:00] they're going away it's because if you look at pinside and you look at what Robin and the

[27:06] moderators have allowed the deep route thread to become it's a complete joke and they should be

[27:13] embarrassed that they allowed the inmates to run the asylum you know Robert was active on the

[27:19] deep route thread and Robert would chime in every now and again he might have said stuff every

[27:24] once in a while that might not have been the most popular but at least you had the head guy

[27:29] at a new pinball company engaging with the community and once again pinside has failed to do what

[27:36] they're supposed to do and it's just keep the thread on topic and now the thread is just a dumpster

[27:41] fire and deep route has deactivated their account and and and Robin is still letting the dumpster

[27:47] fire go so I think you're gonna I think it's gonna be interesting to see what deep route does and

[27:53] especially what they do with regards to pinside I'll just leave it at that all right all right what

[27:57] else going on let me read a couple of your notes and then I'm done on this episode of

[28:01] Canadeus pinball podcast see we can we can talk about something important and not take hours all right

[28:07] all right I got an you know apparently my last couple episodes were somewhat polarizing that people

[28:14] some people like them some people thought they were negative and I want to read some of your feedback

[28:19] on them how's that sound and then I'm also going to read some of the stuff from Facebook because

[28:23] I did ask the question what's the most magical thing you've seen in pinball in the last five years

[28:30] and this is an in response to my last episode about Canadeus dreams of pinball because you know I

[28:36] still think I still think if you ask some very basic questions about what's wowing you in this

[28:41] industry man people come up with a really short list like there's a lot of games but the list

[28:47] of magic is always really short all right so Jeremy Herman wrote in now Jeremy first of all

[28:54] thank you for listening to the show and he said Chris your last few episodes have been super

[28:58] negative and are painful to listen to at even two times speed with ample use of skip 32nd

[29:06] button you talk about getting bored with the recent pins coming out I'm bored with you bitching

[29:11] about everything from a podcast pulpit for instance the recent rant on how the theme choice is the

[29:17] most important thing ever have you googled all time greatest pinball machines let's have a look

[29:23] at ipdb's list literally half of the top 20 aren't licensed themes theater of magic medieval

[29:30] madness monster bash whitewater tails of the Caribbean night to talk from Mars funhouse circus

[29:34] Voltaire fish tails to get away the list goes on do you think anyone cares that medieval

[29:39] madness isn't called Monte python and the holy grail well let me tell you something right now

[29:44] if it was called Monte python and the holy grail Jeremy yeah they would have cared and they would

[29:49] have bought more and it would have been more successful oh wait medieval madness wasn't very successful

[29:55] back in the day uh oh okay look it's still a great game absolutely great game because it's a great

[30:00] design with fun rules and callouts you said all of us should demand a little bit more than what we're

[30:05] getting right now from pinball I expect more from you how about some more interviews that's when

[30:11] you're on your best behavior bonus points for not crapping i he says the s word on jerry every

[30:17] opportunity you get he's contributing a hell of a lot more to this community than you are

[30:21] look at the new and homebrew machines running on his hardware despite this rant i love you

[30:27] Jeremy i love you too look i'll do some interviews who do you want me to interview people tell me

[30:33] who you want me to interview canate a pinball edgmail dot com i mean do you need me to interview

[30:37] people at stern i mean nature versus got that taken care of now i found out why Nate unfriended me i

[30:43] wasn't going to say this i'll tell you this right now apparently someone shared with Nate um

[30:48] he said bad things i said about him he said multiple people shared bad things i said about

[30:53] nature which means uh you know look in the pinball podcasting world here's a little dirty secret

[30:58] everyone's talking crap about everyone behind the scenes it's it's what we do um some of the

[31:04] stuff is is you know just jabbing some of it is more personal uh but someone apparently you know

[31:09] screen grabbed uh conversation and sent it to Nate so that's great it's always nice to know that

[31:15] on social media it's nothing filled with a bunch of backstabbers that will just take what you say

[31:20] in private and go share it and look i said hey man Nate i'm sorry i don't even know what i said i

[31:26] don't even know how to defend myself i don't even know who you're talking about and what's always

[31:29] amazing is when people backstab you it's like they're always anonymous they never tell you who gave

[31:34] them the information they just unfriend you and that's cool like i don't you know all all is

[31:38] fair and in love in pinball podcasting and you know i i don't you know again that's just the way it

[31:45] is now it is it's like you got to be really careful i mean i guess the ultimate lesson i learned

[31:49] is just don't say bad things about people don't say nath nassie things about people unless you want

[31:54] to want it to get to them and unless you're comfortable saying it to their face okay but you know

[32:00] like i've always said like i think nath shows great um i think he's gonna you know be the spokesperson

[32:05] for stern and i don't think it's it's it's what he wants to do he wants to tell pinball history and

[32:10] you want to give you the interviews with stern people so i am not gonna get stern interviews okay

[32:14] i they won't do it i reach out to zack sharp all the time and he always respectfully declines my

[32:20] request for interview i've interviewed jerry recently i want to interview who if i could

[32:26] interview anyone in pinball right now who who who would i want to interview uh you know it's a

[32:31] good question i would want to interview there's only one person that i'm dying to interview right

[32:35] now and i want to get them on the show and that's robert muleer i want to get deep root back on

[32:40] the show i would love to interview robert muleer i would love to interview berry from dutch pinball

[32:46] right if i could have he'd be my second most in demand interview berry from dutch pinball i want

[32:52] to talk to that guy that guy has been able to hide from a podcaster like me he'll never do this show

[32:59] he never wants to talk to someone like me because i'm gonna go right at him right at him i would love

[33:04] to interview john poppadooke i would love to interview joe balser i would love to interview dovel

[33:11] over at american pinball i want to interview people where i think the interview would be interesting

[33:17] what i don't want to do or and i don't need to do is i don't want to interview people that are

[33:22] just gonna come on show their product and their game or they've been interviewed eighteen million

[33:27] times by other people i mean that's you know that's the thing it's like yeah i mean i i love guys

[33:31] like jack danger i talked to him all the time and i always say jack you should come on the show

[33:35] but the thing is jack is always out there doing his thing giving you his point of view he's been on

[33:39] many shows i sure i could have him on and i could you know it look in every other pinball podcast

[33:44] you have out there they've co-hosts i mean it's basically like each two people talking about pinball

[33:50] what i like about this shows it's just me you know and again like when i feel like doing an

[33:54] interview with someone i will i'll try my hardest to get the interviews i want to do for you

[33:59] but you know what if those people are not available and they don't want to talk i don't really

[34:04] care to just do an interview to do an interview i used to be like that i used to have like

[34:08] guest of the show come on and talk about pinball and and it just bored me i don't want to hear just

[34:13] another like just everyone towing the same line on pinball i want to give you guys interviews where

[34:19] we're uncovering something you know my favorite interview and my favorite thing that we ever

[34:23] learned and this is one of my favorite interviews maybe not my favorite but one of the best interviews

[34:27] i ever did and he's never done another pinball podcast interview was with nick parks in which nick

[34:33] parks a huge distributor for pinball actually gave us amazing information and it was it was a bombshell

[34:40] news it was bombshell news that a lot of people have forgotten that stern would love for you to get

[34:44] that the cost to actually make a stern machine is around three thousand dollars now now now go

[34:50] by a black knight alie for nine thousand dollars and tell me tell me who doesn't deserve your

[34:56] twippy vote number three can they just pinball podcasts all right let's go on to see if we have any

[35:01] any more feedback here uh you know i would love to interview zack many did i did i mention that

[35:06] zack many zacks funny to me like he won't come on my show he won't let me go on his show and yet

[35:13] we're friends we talk every day i don't understand the the reason why that happens you know i'm kind

[35:19] of calling them out here like why don't we just like have a pinball conversation it's like we can

[35:24] have it for hours on facebook but there's something about the public perception of zack many and me

[35:31] like sharing the airwaves that he feels might be damaging uh i don't know why zack what's up what's

[35:38] up you know Greg comes on the show all the time i also want to interview ken kromwell from special

[35:45] one late because i love that show and i want to get him on all right well before i do that i want to

[35:49] talk about one other news item so i reached out to to jason foul or over at slap save pinball

[35:55] podcast because i listened to their last show and i was like wait a minute i didn't sell my big

[35:58] Lebowski for thirty thousand dollars and he reported it as such i think i was joking with him

[36:04] saying hey yeah it's on ebay and i bet someone will pay thirty thousand dollars for it but no one

[36:10] bought a big Lebowski for thirty thousand dollars if you buy big Lebowski for thirty thousand dollars

[36:15] you're freaking moron i wouldn't even sell it to someone for thirty thousand dollars because i

[36:19] don't want someone to be a moron the game is not sold i've not done anything with pire to the

[36:24] Caribbean i still have a collector's edition for thirteen thousand five hundred that is exactly

[36:29] what i paid for it people didn't just i i didn't i'm not trying to flip that for profit there's

[36:33] another pire to the Caribbean CE for sale for almost fifteen thousand dollars by but by hemi orange

[36:40] on pinside you can either buy that one or buy the one i have for thirteen thousand five hundred you

[36:45] go decide you want to waste another twelve hundred bucks for no reason whatsoever and mine has more

[36:49] mods in it i just don't know you know where to put it right now because i wasn't expecting to buy

[36:55] big Lebowski because financially right now i'm not a multi multi millionaire like some of you

[37:00] guys out there and i just booked an expensive trip to japan i'll tell you right now between

[37:06] i mean the last six months it's like i used to be in this position where like i would make two

[37:11] dollars for every one dollar i would spend on life but the last like six months because of a lot

[37:17] of expensive things lately it's felt like off every dollar i make them spending two dollars and it's

[37:22] sucks and i and i'm just trying to like put a pause on that for a while to get back to where i want

[37:28] to be not in financial trouble but you know i'd like to have a lot saved up i don't like to

[37:33] to have pinball machines be my investments all right i got an email from steward burns just

[37:40] can non-licensed pinball themes exist in 2019 2020 dear canada thank you for your podcasts

[37:46] entertainment each week i will vote for you in the twippy yes i can't wait for the third

[37:51] twippy awards i you know what i you know what's gonna be funny guys is it's gonna be funny to see how

[37:55] the other pinball podcasters out their handle asking for your twippy vote remember last year like

[38:02] nobody wanted to ask for the vote and everyone was like ashamed and then head to head pinball tried

[38:07] to crap all over the twippies and then they realized the mistake in their ways like after doing

[38:12] a year of incredible shows they then said the twippies don't really matter and then they realized

[38:17] their mistake they they did such hard work imagine doing all this hard work on an assignment

[38:23] and then going in front of a client and being like you know what i don't really care if we win this

[38:26] business that's what it was like and oh my god but anyway this year i think it's gonna be like

[38:31] the 2020 presidential election we're gonna have like all these candidates right it's gonna be like

[38:36] the DNC where everyone's gonna come out and they're all gonna have a really hard time asking for votes

[38:41] but you know me i do this podcast to make the best pinball podcast i think the world has ever heard

[38:48] i'm not being i'm not being arrogant i do this show to do that to make the best and i think this

[38:52] is the most entertaining because of how we do this show and that means a lot to me and the twippies

[38:57] do mean a lot to me and i'll always be honest about that and i'm gonna start i'm not gonna start

[39:02] campaigning right now even though this sounds like i just started campaigning all right then he says

[39:06] do you think that any non-license theme can exist in this current climate is medieval madness to

[39:13] brine eddy design is the only theme that could possibly cut through license recognition or do you

[39:20] even think it's a theme that would still struggle in the current environment all right some stewie

[39:25] bee here it's still he's great question it's a great question like do i think that like a medieval man

[39:30] is to a theater of magic to or a big bang bar to would they be successful i'll tell you this right

[39:35] now i think those if you did a sequel to one of the most popular pinball original ip's of all time

[39:43] it would only work if you made it a special collectible game for the diehard pinball people because

[39:51] those themes i hate to break it to you guys they mean absolutely nothing to most of the people who buy

[39:58] a new pinball machines they mean nothing pat law there means nothing george gomes means nothing

[40:04] brine eddy means nothing zombie eddy means no none of these guys i don't know why through zombie eddy

[40:10] he's he's like a new guy but you know like all the old designers and the old themes that were

[40:15] really popular they don't have any modern day cash for the most part the the cash a only exists

[40:22] within the diehard who actually love those original titles okay and that's as much smaller pool of

[40:30] people go back and look at how many people bought medieval madness back then or like how many were

[40:35] in the arcades it wasn't that many and so a lot of the reason why those games were great is they

[40:41] were great games but they also came out in in in in a period in which there were so many license

[40:45] themes but they're also just great games but your question was this if these games came out today

[40:51] would they be successful only if a company said we're going to make medieval madness to and we're

[40:56] going to make only 500 we're only going to make 500 big bang bar to and i also think you price them

[41:01] higher but also if you look at those games and you look at the game the reason why people love

[41:07] those games from the 90s it's like i said in my last podcast it's because those games have so much

[41:12] mechanically amazing stuff happening in them and the code and the sound effects and the lights

[41:19] and the music and the callouts freaking the callouts we haven't seen callouts as good as medieval

[41:25] madness ever in new pimpal we haven't seen callouts as good as the atoms family and other of those

[41:31] night those value Williams games all the great games like monster bash those callouts are so much

[41:36] better than any callouts in new games to me if you ask me like those games had one thing that

[41:41] personality they had personality in their design and their mechanisms in the callouts and the light

[41:47] show and the modes most of these games nowadays they lack the cohesive personality that those games

[41:53] had but if you're going to remake it you best not make it a mass volume thing and you have to look

[41:58] no further than black night sort of rage and how that game is not selling very well it's because

[42:04] they made a mistake they listened to i know actually know whose idea it was to make it and it

[42:09] wasn't Steve Richies i'm not going to call them out but they they they made a mistake and this

[42:14] is what happens all the time when you start to think that pinball history and the pinball enthusiast

[42:19] the stern army guys the guys who've been playing pinball religiously for 20 30 years when you start

[42:24] to think that that's your market to make a successful new game at volume you fail you feel

[42:31] horribly you feel horribly but when you understand that all right there's there are 500 die hard old

[42:37] school guys that would buy this then you're on to something i think you need to make it more

[42:42] limited all right let's see what else we got here oh people how you doing this morning i feel

[42:48] like we should just like every once in a while just get a beer and not even talk about pinball

[42:52] and see what else is going on in our lives that's interesting because i do think it's not healthy to

[42:56] think too much about pinball all right so angelo moro hey Chris how you doing i'm enjoying your

[43:03] constant podcast and keep it up do you have a link to listen to the stern insider podcast by Keith

[43:09] L. Win by every single stern game that comes out i'm not paying for the insider bs any link

[43:15] torrent download is much appreciated angelo angelo the good news is you don't have to

[43:23] pay for stern insider program to listen to the podcast which is the good news the bad news is

[43:31] stern requires you to give them all of your personal information to register for stern insider

[43:38] page and once you give them your phone number your email your address everything that is you

[43:45] once you hand it over to them then they will allow you to listen to their little podcast okay i think

[43:52] it's a joke i do stern it's just funny to me stern's whole mission is to expand pinball and yet they

[43:57] create a pinball podcast that's behind closed doors it's it leaks a little bit of arrogance i don't

[44:02] think zack really i don't think he's a bad guy but it's like come on come on welcome to 2019 and

[44:07] how the podcasting world should work i mean i i think that stern's like behind the firewall kind of

[44:13] podcast is not going to work out people have already said when they try to listen to it on that

[44:17] platform it's buggy it lags you ain't going to get no lag when you listen to canators pinball

[44:23] podcast on iTunes or on sound sound cloud right this is and it's all free you know what to give me

[44:29] anything you know when people complain about this podcast i just remind them like you're not

[44:33] paying for it it's all for free so uh you know enjoy it because it might not last forever uh oh

[44:39] is that a spoiler alert maybe maybe not all right all right so yeah but if you go to stern's pinball

[44:45] page in the insider you can listen to it for free angelo you don't have to uh you don't have to

[44:50] pay any money tbl john galvan said hey christ are you in the second batch of tbl shipments from a

[44:58] array i am and i'm looking forward to it all right so john um i i i would assume so i think there's

[45:04] two batches i have not received word from coin taker on the status of the machine i purchased

[45:11] have to be honest i'm i'm not really in a rush to to do anything with it it is going to sit

[45:17] in storage until i make up my mind all right let's see mic p feedback for pinball themes podcast

[45:25] hey canate a great episode as usual something i always wondered why haven't there been more video game

[45:32] themes used there are some massive video game franchises around now and the video game industry has

[45:37] been bigger than the movie industry and music industry combined you would think the pinball

[45:43] manufacturers would be looking at this more closely or maybe there's a market research that shows

[45:47] that people who play pinball don't play video games that's not true i think a lot of people play both

[45:52] um but he goes on to say here are a few examples call a duty grant that thawto halo tumerator the

[45:57] witcher assassins create a metal gear i'm not familiar with david busters but from what you have

[46:03] described recently i'm thinking some video game themes for the younger audience could be successful

[46:08] here pokemon mario sonic zelda and minecraft see i think those are great ones mic i do i think the

[46:15] ones you mentioned above like call the duty grant that auto are terrible some themes are just much

[46:20] better in video game form and much more immersive and the people who love those games like fortnite

[46:26] people don't want to play pinball machines they would be bored to death if it was a pinball medium

[46:31] bringing fortnite to them so that's just where it's at i do think though like the iconic themes like

[46:37] you can make a pinball docky con or a super mario brothers or zelda i think those would be very cool

[46:44] i don't know why it's not done if i were deep root i would i would call up nintendo and see

[46:49] what's the deal the here's why it's probably not done you think disney's expensive good luck looking

[46:55] at how expensive it is to license the rights to you know nintendo properties but but the thing is

[47:02] this you don't have to worry about paying actors a separate fee because they're everything is

[47:07] working with fictional characters i think it should be a little bit easier to pull off brinda you can

[47:11] come in i know i'm running late just coming in we do this in the morning people usually do this

[47:17] between seven thirty and around eight thirty a.m. people wonder where do you get the time real question

[47:22] they should be asking is where do i get the guts to tell the pinball community to stop buying

[47:28] games until the playfield issues are taken care of all right let's see what else we got here

[47:33] then i'll let you guys go do do do do do do do do do licenses okay robert i get to read robert gave me

[47:43] a really awesome scott drager topic that will get some opinions hey canada the pinball distribution

[47:51] model has a flaw manufacturers do not reward the creation of showrooms in the automobile dealer world

[48:00] dealers get credit for having a nice showroom that is on brand we all know there is sufficient margin

[48:07] in pinball to display products properly this especially true for aspiring lifestyle brand

[48:13] most distributors just drop ship machines and they don't care about customer once the box hits

[48:19] the curb but some distributors operate nice showrooms at considerable expense to themselves great

[48:25] american pinball is an example near me mic nogle showcases new games unbox and playable for sale

[48:32] he has wonka drastic park monsters sort of rage on display with about twenty five other machines

[48:39] maybe the manufacturer should give some credits or benefit for distributors who are building brand

[48:45] value for the manufacturers if you want a lifestyle brand you need a nice retail environment

[48:52] manufacturers should support unique placement of products uh scott scott i think is a really

[48:58] interesting topic i i really do and you know stern tried to open up a store like a stern store to

[49:04] sell games and and and they quickly bailed out and realized that brick and mortar retail is not

[49:10] their industry it is manufacturing uh here's here's what i would say uh you know i don't think like

[49:18] stern it's stern's responsibility if you have a nicer pinball showroom you're going to attract more

[49:23] people into your showroom you're going to have an environment in which selling games is going to

[49:30] you know be more successful for you because you have a showroom that is appealing to people i think

[49:35] there are some distributors that are set up solely for like the pin side buyer right i think they

[49:40] they have just a warehouse and they have like you know a huge customer list and they have their rich

[49:45] collectors who buy every le and these guys just move product from a to b they don't really they don't

[49:50] even need a showroom like they're just like middlemen right you know they don't that's their business

[49:54] model other people like great american pinball you know they have a model in which they they do both

[49:59] which they can get you a game a to b if you don't even need to walk in but they have something that's

[50:04] attractive for people to walk into but nobody made them become a pinball distributor and i

[50:11] i believe in in a free market and i believe that if you want to start selling a car and you want to

[50:16] start selling you know you you can make the dealership the way you want to make the dealership i think

[50:20] car dealers or sorry car brands require that a dealership be to a certain standard right to become

[50:26] a dealership uh absolutely right you're not going to find like a Bentley dealership and a beat up

[50:31] warehouse uh but you know there's not i don't know there's not a ton of volume in pinball sales

[50:38] there's not that much money uh that you know the margins are so good where you know the manufacturers

[50:43] should be like building the lifestyle within the showrooms i just don't think most people care i

[50:48] really you know this is always where i end up i sometimes i feel like pinball people

[50:52] who their gaming showrooms are not like that there's not that many of them there's not that much

[50:58] demand to have that experience being credible i will say this um you know i think it's just up to

[51:04] the individual distributor create the create the just see to me the distributor becomes the brand

[51:10] within pinball right i mean who does not think that like coin taker is a brand tnt amusements is a

[51:15] brand great american pinball is a brand and when and and those brands are brands because the people

[51:22] backing them are very well known within the community and like jj's a brand right gex exchange you

[51:28] you know i i love jj like i love chris i love like melissa i love you know all these pinball

[51:35] distributors that have the the right kinds of personalities that's what makes you want to buy

[51:38] from them i think you could care less if there's a showroom or not um i'm just saying i mean it's

[51:43] more for like the casual ignorant person that doesn't know anything about pinball yeah you want

[51:48] their experience to be nice but i don't know part of me is just like who like why do we care so much

[51:52] about some of this stuff i i you know i mean if if that person wants a pinball machine in their

[51:57] basement i don't really think they're gonna you know they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna do

[52:00] like a white glove across the windowsill inside the distributor and if it's not like a nice environment

[52:06] they're not gonna buy it i don't know and if distributors are selling games and then not supporting

[52:10] them then they won't keep selling games you know i mean the the distributors that are being successful

[52:15] they have great customer service and they they they they follow their customer from a to z and

[52:21] they're always there for them and that's who you should buy from i don't really care about showrooms
