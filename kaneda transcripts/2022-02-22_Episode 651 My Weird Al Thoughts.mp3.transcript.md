[00:00] ["Dare to Be Stupid"]

[00:16] You know, when I hear this song, Dare to Be Stupid, by WeirdAl Yankovic, I can't help but feel like Dare to Be Stupid may be the perfect theme song for P3 Multimorphic.

[00:28] No, I'm kidding, but I did think about the irony of that song and revealing to the world this Monday that P3's licensed theme that we've been waiting for for a really long time is, in fact, WeirdAl's Museum of Hilarity.

[00:45] Now, I want to give you my thoughts on this, my thoughts on Jersey Jack and are they going to come to TPF and is Jaws and Back to the Future coming?

[00:54] Let's talk about all of this that's been happening in the pinball world.

[00:57] Okay, now, Dream Theme. Is this a Dream Theme pinball machine? Now, on my Patreon club page, as you guys know, I put up a poll.

[01:07] Is WeirdAl a Dream Theme for you? Now, I got the most responses ever during this poll.

[01:14] 162 people said no and 11 said yes. Now, a Dream Theme I don't think should divide people this much.

[01:24] Like, this is probably one of the most divisive Dream Themes used ever in the world of pinball.

[01:31] Now, what do I think about this? Do I think this is a smart move for P3 Multimorphic? Do I think it's a Dream Theme? Will I be buying this game?

[01:38] Do I think there is an audience for this game in the pinball world? And what are my thoughts on this whole thing?

[01:44] Well, first and foremost, WeirdAl is a Dream Theme for some people, but not for most.

[01:51] Now, as a marketer, me looking at this decision, it is not the theme I would have chosen if I wanted to move a lot of P3 Multimorphic units.

[02:02] I think this is a very, very niche theme when it comes to being a Dream Theme.

[02:08] I grew up in the 80s and 90s like most of you. I remember WeirdAl. I remember his music videos.

[02:16] I just didn't bring WeirdAl with me into adulthood. I kind of don't understand adults who are still into WeirdAl, but I understand he has a fan base.

[02:28] I understand he's sold 20 million albums. I understand there are grown adults who still engage in WeirdAl.

[02:36] It's just nothing I've been engaged with for decades. And I run a group called CultureTap, and we tap into cultural things that have

[02:45] relevance in the modern world. And I mean this when I say it. I have never, ever, ever, ever heard anybody ever in a creative meeting or a strategy session with all of these major clients.

[02:58] No one has ever said, you know who we should partner with? WeirdAl Yankovic, if we want to reach people.

[03:04] So look, you could say that he still has relevance, but he's, you know, like he's an American pop culture iconic figure from back in the day.

[03:11] And I know he's still doing stuff, and he's famous for parodying songs that are famous out in culture. And it is what it is. I just don't understand grown adults who are still into WeirdAl.

[03:23] And that's just me. I'll put it like this. When are you in the mood to listen to WeirdAl music as a grown adult? Do you still go back and watch WeirdAl music videos as a grown adult in your 40s, 50s, and 60s?

[03:35] I don't get the people who do, but I get he has a fan base and I can't argue against that. Like it'd be silly for me. So I'm theme alone. I don't love this theme. I'm definitely not buying it. You know me. At these prices, things have to be a dream theme for me to jump into it.

[03:54] Now, all we know is the theme. I am hearing from people who have seen the game that this game is pretty packed and loaded, like the modular system that you put into the P3 to play this WeirdAl game is going to have a lot of stuff.

[04:10] And that's cool. Like I can't wait to see that, but there is nothing. And I mean this. There is nothing they could put into this game that would make me buy it because I don't want to own a WeirdAl game.

[04:23] Now, I wish Jerry would have given me some information prior to this. Like it was clear. He did a good job. Like he invited some media to come see the game first. He did not invite Canada. He did not invite ZachManny.

[04:35] But we saw the video of FlipTronic seeing the game for the first time and they're like, wow, dudes. Like, but they're actually seeing the game too, not just the theme. And they said that it was a dream theme for them.

[04:47] And look, if WeirdAl is a dream theme for you, it's much like Rush fans. Like I'm not going to argue that you like WeirdAl. It's just not for me. It's just not mainstream. And you're just not going to have the buyer base with a theme like WeirdAl as you would if you had something that was more like a Rick and Morty or something that was like Matrix or something that was like Rambo.

[05:10] Right? There's just not as many people into WeirdAl. And it is a music pin. We don't know how they're going to incorporate all the WeirdAl songs into this pin, but we shall see. And again, I hear the gameplay is actually going to be the most impressive part. So I look forward to seeing that.

[05:27] But here's the other thing I was thinking about. Will this help Jerry sell more games? The answer is absolutely yes. But my big question mark remains this.

[05:37] How fast can they build P3 Multimorphics? Like if you ordered one today, when are you getting your WeirdAl game? And that's my worry because I'm hearing from some distributors that P3 Multimorphic is already like six months behind on orders. And so if you place an order today, you're waiting six months or longer to get this game. And then how much is this game? And for you to go in on the P3 Multimorphic platform, like you really have to go in on the platform.

[06:08] So you're probably going to end up buying like the Heist or Cosmic Carnival or something else. It's a very expensive proposition because once you buy the platform and you have a few of the kits, now you're in deep like 15 grand, 16 grand, 18 thousand dollars. And then if you go to sell your game, you've got to try to find someone to buy all of that. Like, and that's the hard part about this entire platform.

[06:35] And even though like there's going to be a lot in this game, part of me is like, why don't they just make a normal pinball machine and then price it accordingly? You know, because the other part about P3 is like, these aren't like LEDs, like anyone who wants a game can have one. So there is no real FOMO at play here. They're going to make an unlimited number of WeirdAl games. And so look, I'm happy Jerry's got a licensed theme. I hope they can make these games fast enough.

[07:02] But I also think the window of excitement around this game is going to be very, very short because coming in on the heels of this game will be a game known as Toy Story. And I think there is going to be an interesting battle that happens down at T.P.F.

[07:18] So here's the other rumor I'm hearing is that Jersey Jack Pinball is ready with Toy Story. The game is going to go on the line in April. They're just waiting on two parts. That's what I heard. Two parts they're waiting for.

[07:31] The games will be built in April and they are going to bring this thing to T.P.F. Now that is what I'm hearing. And that is super exciting.

[07:40] If I were you, I would not sleep on this game. And I know what all of you are saying.

[07:45] Canada, we do not know if the playfields are going to be better or not. And I don't know. And you don't know. But I do know this. That when it comes to a Jersey Jack Collectors edition of Toy Story, it will be their hottest selling pinball machine of all time.

[08:02] And I'd rather roll the dice on a dream theme because this is a dream theme of mine. I'm going to buy Toy Story. I am not going to get locked out of a CE because I'm nervous about the playfield.

[08:13] Even if you get a CE and there are playfield issues, hello guns and roses, you are not going to lose any money. Now the question becomes how many CE's are they going to make and how much money will they be?

[08:27] My guess, I've said it before, I think we're going to see the CE be $14,999. So $15,000 for the CE and I think they're going to make a thousand of them. And I'm not sure if they're going to be 500 Buzz or 500 Woody editions, but I expect 1000 Collectors editions.

[08:45] I think Jersey Jack is witnessing this marketplace and seeing what is going on. I also expect them this time to not just say we're making 5000 LEs of Toy Story. There will be no SE version of the game. That's the other thing I'm here to report.

[09:02] There will only be LEs and CE's. Now I also think they're going to say that we are only making this many LEs in 2022. And the reason why I think they're going to say that is that they want to make the Godfather by the end of the year.

[09:18] Because Eric Minier is the Godfather, which will feature, I'm hearing, Christopher Franchi on artwork. He's no longer making any Stern games. We saw his post where he said the Stern bridge has been blown up. So that's never going to happen again. Franchi on a Stern game.

[09:34] But he is doing this game with Eric Minier that I'm hearing. And it's going to be Godfather. I'm hearing the game is done. Like they're playing Eric's Godfather at JJP today. And it's the 50th anniversary of the Godfather Franchi.

[09:48] So I think that's the plan over at Jersey Jack Pinball this year. Let's get Toy Story out. Let's finish up the Guns Run. And then let's also reveal Godfather sometime in October, November.

[10:00] I fully expect that to be the play here. I think 2022 is going to be a year in which Jersey Jack Pinball does a flex move and gets two games out in one year and shows people what they can do.

[10:14] They've been building up this company to get to this point. They don't want to be a company that's one pinball machine every 18 months.

[10:22] Because now they've got four designers. They've got all this space. They've got all of this knowledge on how to get it done. If they can just get the playfields to be better and they can just quality test these items a little bit more.

[10:35] I really think Jersey Jack Pinball with a new game every year makes pinball so much more exciting. I've been talking to my friends about this. Without Jersey Jack Pinball, it gets really boring.

[10:47] I love what Stern does. Stern dominates every year. Jersey Jack launches are just another level of excitement. And then the boutique companies out there I think have been the real disappointment because nobody from the boutique world has really elevated anything.

[11:04] Nobody from the boutique world has shown us anything that's blown us away. I was hoping eight, nine years ago when we saw the Big Lebowski that more companies like Dutch Pinball would get it done.

[11:16] But we've never seen American Pinball give us a game as good as the Big Lebowski. We haven't seen the Pinball brothers do anything really interesting.

[11:26] Spooky Pinball keeps getting better for Spooky Pinball but it's still a company that's never really even engineered a single toy that's been complex.

[11:34] Look at the Big Lebowski and put it next to everything Spooky Pinball's done. It's comical. Then you've got like Home Pin doing what with Spinal Tap and you've got Pinball, Ballerama, you've got Pony Factory, all these other boutiques, deep root.

[11:48] Everyone who's coming gone and nobody's been able to make a really great game from the boutique space. So then you look at the Pinball landscape and it's all Stern, it's all Jersey Jack Pinball.

[11:59] Chicago Gaming Company takes forever and American Pinball has just never put out anything that's been like, oh my God, take my money now.

[12:07] An American Pinball strategy as we go into 2022 is to release original IP games and we know that original IP games are just nowhere near going to be as exciting or entertaining or popular or take my money now as a theme like Toy Story or even Godfather or Jaws or James Bond or Venom.

[12:28] It's going to be a very interesting 2022. The big issue that is going to happen this year is still manufacturing and who can get the parts, who can make the games, who can get the games to customers.

[12:40] I was looking in the Spooky Thread and I don't even think they've made like 250 Halloween's yet. The pace at which they're making games is pretty slow.

[12:49] We haven't seen any production updates from Haggis Pinball. I'm not even going to go there. The Thread is talking about snakes now. They're not even talking about the game. It is now like the 22nd of February.

[13:01] It's now another month that's gone by and there's still no photos of production. I'm not going to keep beating that drum. If you're in on a fathom, it's up to you to ask Damien for proof of production.

[13:11] I don't care anymore. I really don't. I think it is what it is. I still think you'll get your games. I just don't know how they make money with all these delays.

[13:19] But look, I think when we get to TPF and Jerry's got his new game, he can't make them that fast. How many P3s can Jerry make a week?

[13:28] Let's say he gets 200 orders for the Weird Owl game. When are you getting your game? That's the problem is people are not going to want to wait 8 months to get something that you reveal today.

[13:39] I have full faith that if Jersey Jack announces Toy Story and they go on the line in April that a lot of us and all the CEs will be built by the summer when the new Buzz Lightyear movie comes out.

[13:53] I think Jersey Jack's going to hit the timing perfectly with Toy Story. I have no idea what's in Toy Story. I'm excited to see it. I have no idea what the toys are, what the layout is. It's a pat-la-la theme.

[14:05] I believe John UC is on the art package of this game. Now look, it's Toy Story. So they are going to get great assets from Disney.

[14:14] It's not going to be too hard to make a Toy Story pin look amazing because it's already illustrated and animated.

[14:21] So all they have to do is move that stuff around and make it look amazing. Then you add like the gold sparkle to the CEs.

[14:28] And we know that nobody puts more into their modern games than Jersey Jack Pinball.

[14:35] The main question mark around Toy Story will be how many assets are they going to get? Are we going to get clips from the movies?

[14:42] Are we going to see the iconic scenes we love voiced over by the actors in those scenes? Are we going to get Tom Hanks? Are we going to get Tim Allen?

[14:51] Nobody knows. Nobody knows. We shall see what happens with these games. But it's an exciting time in Pinball because as we get closer to TPF, more and more will be revealed.

[15:01] Like when is American Pinball going to start revealing the Dennis Nordman game? Think about it for a minute.

[15:06] I'm not seeing any Legends of Vahala's being unboxed. I don't know what's going on, right? I still think manufacturing across the board is really sluggish everywhere.

[15:16] Now Stern Pinball, let's talk about them for a minute. We've got Rush L.E.'s going out the door. They will make all thousand Rush L.E.'s by the end of February.

[15:24] So that's a good thing. Then we're going to get to their next title. I believe their next title will be shown in April or May.

[15:31] But the other thing I'm hearing is this, and this is bad news for everybody, that Stern is going to do another price increase in April.

[15:39] $400 across the board Stern is going to raise every single game. They're going to keep doing this every single year now. It is getting to the point now where if you own two Stern L.E.'s, you're looking around $24,000 for two Stern L.E.'s without a topper.

[15:58] Add a topper to each one and you're at $25,000 plus dollars to own two Stern L.E.'s. Remember when a Stern L.E. was $6,500, right? Now it's double the price and there's not double in these games.

[16:15] It's getting really expensive. When I see people spending $18,000, $19,000 on like a stranger things, I really do wish everyone would just slow down.

[16:27] It's not going to be like this forever. There's a lot of really exciting titles coming. Why would you go all in on a stranger things?

[16:36] We're going to get Venom. Then we're going to get James Bond. And then I'm hearing that Keith Elwyn's next game might be Jaws.

[16:44] I can't 100% say it's Jaws. I have not seen it, but there is a very strong rumor that Keith Elwyn will be making Jaws and it will be like Jurassic Park where it will be an all new Jaws adventure and not clips from the movie.

[17:00] If they make Jaws and it's Keith Elwyn, it's going to sell. Keith Elwyn could sell Care Bears. Like he could sell My Little Pony. When this guy makes a game, it's going to sell like hotcakes.

[17:12] And Jaws is still super relevant. You know why? Because people just love sharks. There's a reason why Shark Week is the most popular thing on the Discovery Channel.

[17:23] So if they make this game and it's got the Jaws music and it's got the colorful blue shark and there's like a big shark toy that pops up from underneath the play field, it's going to do phenomenally well.

[17:37] You would have said, I'm never buying another Godzilla. We don't need another Godzilla. Then Keith Elwyn makes Godzilla and you all bought it. Same is true with Jaws except we've never had a Jaws pin.

[17:47] If they make this Jaws pin, it's going to sell phenomenally well and it's another property that just has millions of fans. Jaws is more popular than maybe Halloween. It's just as popular as like Rush.

[17:58] Like you don't need to have like a billion fans. You just need 5,000 diehard fans of any property who also like pinball and you'll be okay. And that's where we are in the pinball marketplace.

[18:10] So here's my prediction. I think Toy Story is going to be gangbusters for JJP. I think Weird Owl is going to do okay for Jerry but he's not going to be able to make the games fast enough and by the time the games become more available, people's money will be spent with Jersey Jack and with Stern.

[18:28] And also people are going to be hit up to make up the remainder of their Cactus Canyon purchases. Like we're not even talking about the fact that Cactus Canyon is another game that has asked you for $10,000 plus.

[18:39] I think a lot of us in this hobby have reached a point now where like wait a minute, I'm now committing to four games a year which is almost like $44,000.

[18:49] Like everyone's starting to like have a wake up call and be like I don't want to spend $50,000 a year on four pinball machines.

[18:56] When we asked how much money do you have invested in pinball and the majority of people said over $100,000. But that's not even surprising now because we're at the point where if you have four Stern like limited edition machines that are hard to find, you're over $100,000 in value.

[19:12] If you have a Jurassic Park, a Stranger Things, a Deadpool and a Batman 66 LE, you now have over $100,000 in pins.

[19:22] Now each of those games, if you bought them when they first came out, you would have only been spending like $40,000. See it's stupid now. It's absolutely stupid how inflated everything has become.

[19:33] And that is why as someone who is a new dad and looking at Killian who's about to be one years old this weekend, I'm happy to sit on the sideline and watch you rich guys buy all this stuff.

[19:45] I mean, it's fun to watch. It's fun to see what people will ask for like a premium. I mean, when did premium and pro machines get a 30% bump in price because there are none.

[19:56] There is no inventory. And so you can almost ask whatever you want if you have a game new in box. It's an exciting time to be in pinball people. It really is.

[20:05] So look, congratulations, Jerry. It's not a dream theme for me. I wouldn't have selected this, but I do think you're going to get orders for Weird Owl.

[20:14] I just hope you can make them. That's going to be the big hurdle. Can you make these games? Because it's not just getting new buyers.

[20:22] All of the existing P3 owners are probably going to want this kit. And then you've got to also make it for them as well.

[20:28] So we shall see how well they can get this game made and how well it sells. Ultimately, it's not what Canada says. The market will dictate how well this does.

[20:38] I just don't see the P3 multi-morphic platform being able to stay competitive with what else is in pinball because the market is shown that people just want to buy standalone games.

[20:52] The whole modular swapping out of the games as kits, that's not what the market wants. If it was what the market wanted, other companies who have tried this would have been more successful.

[21:04] It's never been successful. And I think when your game is turned off, you still want to stand over it and see all the beautiful artwork. You don't get that with the P3. It's a big blank screen.

[21:15] Alright everybody, so I'm going to be at TPF. So if you're going to TPF, hit me up. Let's all hang out. Let's have fun. Let's grab a beer. Let's connect.

[21:25] Make sure you go to the Twippies and cheer if Canada takes it for favorite pinball podcast. I'm super excited to report that we are over 400 club members. We are at 403 right now.

[21:37] About two months ago we were around 300 and so when I made this decision to take this show behind the paywall just for the fans, people said it wouldn't work out. It's actually working out better than I could ever have imagined.

[21:51] My goal is still to get a thousand people. I think more people that realize when we win the Twippy, I think more people are going to want to join when they realize like Canada won again for favorite pinball podcast.

[22:02] If you're new to the pinball landscape, I put up some shows for people to listen to but this is where it's at. It's here and it's on the Facebook live page and I think we're having a great time.

[22:11] There's a lot of other great shows out there but we get right to the point. We talk about it and we're in and out in just like 20 something minutes. This is how it should be.

[22:19] We don't need 90 minutes analysis of weird out. It's an okay theme. It will sell Jerry some units. That's it. Do we need to talk about it for an hour? No.

[22:30] When we see the game, we'll have more to talk about. Everybody have a great day. I hope you had yesterday off. I did. I just don't want to drink for like an entire year.

[22:38] I feel like I've been drinking and eating since the holidays like way too much. Canada's got to get back into a healthy balance. Everybody have a great day. We'll talk to you soon.

[22:49] It's time for us to join in the fight. It's time to let your baby's grow up to be careful. It's time to let them play fun fights.
