[00:00] There's no intro music, there's no song, there's no celebratory moments that will occur on this episode of

[00:07] Canadian Pimball Podcast, but this might be one of the most important Pimball Podcasts that I put up because

[00:14] it has to do with the community and what happened to a member of this community last night and also involves a very

[00:24] prevalent member of the Pimball community and I want to read to you a

[00:28] Facebook post that went up last night by Aaron Elizabeth

[00:34] Shadden sack and she writes

[00:37] anybody know Tommy Floyd from Nitro Pimball?

[00:41] He offered to sponsor the women's tournament if I slept with him, got creepy, touchy

[00:48] feeling with myself and my friend, then grabbed my ass while I was playing Pimball. He told me to

[00:55] grow up and that I should be thankful he touched me and refused to leave when he got 86

[01:02] deed from the bar. Tell him hello from me when you see him because he's sponsoring the NWPAS

[01:11] Women's Pimball tournament. Okay, so this is appalling news to hear, this is appalling

[01:20] behavior by Tommy at Nitro and I also want to read what Aaron went on to say as well in her

[01:29] Facebook feed because I just really I was shocked to hear this and see this but I definitely think

[01:36] we have to talk about how unacceptable this is for the Pimball community. So she went on to say

[01:42] for the record I was too intimidated by his position to do anything at first

[01:49] and I drew the line when we were proposition for sex in exchange for sponsoring the women's tournament

[01:57] and we were talking amongst ourselves about what to do when she her friend Alex went to the bathroom

[02:04] to get away and he assaulted me. I say this for one big reason women it's okay to be afraid to

[02:10] speak up it's okay to feel uncomfortable when something like this happens to you it's okay to

[02:16] ask a friend or a bartender especially if I'm working to intercede on your behalf. I was afraid to

[02:23] post this I thought I would get in trouble but from the bosses they've been 100% behind me like some

[02:33] let's see 100% behind me like some weird I shouldn't tell anyone that's been in me ever since I

[02:39] can remember. I posted this because he's been doing this for years and I would assume he uses his

[02:45] position to pray on and intimidate his victims and if I don't say anything then this will continue

[02:51] to happen I appreciate your support and want to make sure a change 86 deed from the Pimball community.

[02:58] All right so you know Aaron this is this is horrible and I think if you read the responses on her

[03:06] Facebook page you will see everybody is just completely completely like so upset that this

[03:15] happened that you should never in this community you should never be it's not even about Pimball and

[03:22] that's the thing this is nothing to do with Pimball this is just a man assaulting a woman in this

[03:27] manner it is I mean the cops she says she should have called the cops or she didn't call the cops

[03:34] and she and she told Tommy like I'm gonna call the cops and he grabbed her you're actually he

[03:39] actually assaulted her too physically not just with the touching and the weirdness but she

[03:43] uploaded a picture of her wrist which was obviously grabbed really hard with great marks on it

[03:50] and I think I might make that picture even the picture of this podcast I don't know but I just

[03:55] want to say that this is it like there's no coming back from this and I think it's crazy to me that

[04:02] Tommy whose livelihood is Pimball and I've met Tommy at many shows and he's always very nice and

[04:09] you know he he went on her Facebook page and he's he's been trying to do damage control after this

[04:14] happened and he wrote the following he said your damn right I regret it I've never done anything so

[04:22] stupid I don't even remember saying those awful things if you only knew me you know this is

[04:29] completely out of character and I absolutely respect women and I'm very ashamed of my behavior

[04:35] now Aaron saw that and respond it with this she said that is absolutely who you are the arrogance

[04:42] and scorn you showed me when I asked you to leave the bar is the same reaction I see every time a man

[04:48] is reprimanded for assaulting a woman and then asked to leave you did not immediately apologize

[04:54] acknowledge that you what you did was wrong and unwanted and leave you be little to me

[04:59] argue to me told me that you would finish your beer first look to your friends to help you

[05:05] and when I threaten to call the cops you said effin call the cops they won't do anything you're not

[05:12] sorry for what you did you're sorry you got caught I was not offended I was assaulted I've been

[05:18] bartending for 15 years and one thing I can say is that drinking does not make men assault

[05:23] women men drink all the time and keep their hands to themselves you Tommy did not all right so

[05:31] this is I mean this does feel like a very black and white case in which I don't know how you come

[05:38] back from this I think Tommy crossed a line that I don't think people are going to forgive him and

[05:44] I don't think they should forgive for this and you know me I mean I am all about you know we

[05:50] we shouldn't just be like one in done culture but there's there's lines there is lines to

[05:55] behavior there's lines of things you do and you know sometimes you you you you you you can you

[06:01] can piss away everything that is important to you with bad behavior and we sit all the time in

[06:08] culture and society right I mean again it's crazy that we're talking about this on a pinball

[06:11] podcast but this is this affected the pinball community and and that's my point is it's much

[06:16] bigger than pinball and in the pinball community we are all in a malgamation of different types of

[06:22] people we have men we have women we have adults we have children you know we we take the piss out

[06:28] of each other at times we might get an arguments but typically majority of the time so things

[06:33] we're fighting about and debating about it's all in good fun it's all around pinball sometimes

[06:39] people crossed a line and get into fights and angry with other people but this I've never seen

[06:45] anything like this in covering pinball in three and a half years and I think it's over for Tommy

[06:53] and for his role in the pinball community and I don't think people are gonna forgive him I don't

[06:59] think people should forgive him for this behavior it's gonna be a matter between him and his family

[07:06] and his business I'm already reading that people are starting to pull their business from him

[07:11] I'm not surprised by that I think when something like this happens you have to just go away work

[07:17] on yourself get whatever help you need but but you can lose access to the community and they might

[07:25] never take you back and that's just the consequences of actions in life if I went into my if I went

[07:31] into my company tomorrow and and sexually assaulted a woman at my company not only would I be fired

[07:38] I would never get another job again in the industry because people would know about that about that

[07:44] termination and word of mouth and it would be like a black stain on on me and so this is bigger than

[07:51] a black stain I mean this is this is just really really bad and the community will do what the

[07:56] community does best I mean I will say this about the pinball community they rally around people

[08:02] when this happens and the community will survive and move on from this because the pinball community

[08:09] is amazing and because it's not about pinball it's just a community of people like the there are

[08:13] so many amazing people in this hobby and nobody nobody should ever have to put up with this

[08:19] especially especially when it's when you're there just to have a good time and play pinball at a bar

[08:25] right and and nitro being the sponsor of the women's tournament they were the ones who were

[08:30] going to give a game away and now that's all gone the the people doing the show now are saying we're

[08:35] going to give a cash prize we're not going to accept anything from them his customers are now

[08:39] saying they're not going to buy games from him anymore and now everyone who listens to this

[08:44] podcast knows about what happened and they should know this this this is you know and so it's

[08:50] it's it's not the news I want it to come back and do a show because you know me I'm I'm supposed to

[08:55] be on my two week break I'm still going to put up the show with Neil but I just thought this this

[09:02] deserved a separate discussion on this show and and I just want to say that to Aaron I'm so sorry

[09:11] this happened this sucks this and and I think you handled it so well and I think the people on

[09:16] the Facebook page have been saying some really good stuff in terms of how we can accept this

[09:23] behavior and and the most important thing Aaron is that you spoke up and you said something and

[09:28] every woman or man should say something if this type of behavior happens to them it's unacceptable

[09:34] and it is no place for this imping ball you know we shouldn't accept people who say racist comments

[09:39] sexist comments I don't care there's there is just this is not this will never be part of this

[09:44] community and I'm so happy to see the community will extract those individuals who display that

[09:49] behavior and and and there's no turning back like I look at pinball the community it's a very

[09:55] precious thing I mean you know people talk about you know getting banned from forms that look at the

[10:01] there's no way I would ever want to lose being part of this great community and I know you feel

[10:07] the same way too I mean that's that's what makes this community fun is the people and you do not

[10:12] want to get ostracized from being around the things that you love and I think it's completely crazy

[10:17] that Tommy would act this way not just because he's a member of the community it's his livelihood

[10:22] and so there's just no place for it and and when it is your livelihood you have to be extra careful

[10:28] extra careful when everything that you have is on the line every time you grab a drink or you

[10:34] want to socialize or you want to like tell that joke we we live in a world now in which you can

[10:40] hide you you know and if you've been doing it for a while it's going to come out and I'm so happy

[10:44] that Aaron said something and because she said something I want to say something on this show and

[10:49] and and again the conversation will keep on going on on Facebook I don't think I even saw this on

[10:54] pinside the conversation will go to pinside next and people will discuss it but I think everyone's

[10:59] going to come to the same conclusion I have and I there's no room for this and I just thought we

[11:06] had to say something on this short episode of Canatus pinball podcast not what we want to talk about

[11:11] not what we want to talk about at all on this show but it's important that we do talk about it

[11:18] so that's it I'm going back on my vacation to for you know from the show I will put up the

[11:25] interview with Neil on a separate note and this I don't want to talk about anything else other

[11:30] than this behavior is intolerable and that's it enjoy your weekends everybody
