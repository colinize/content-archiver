[00:00] But if you can't take me at my worst, you don't deserve me, it's my best.

[00:12] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:16] Aw, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:18] Canida, what are you doing?

[00:20] You're not supposed to do a podcast for at least another week.

[00:23] Well, one word.

[00:25] Oxycodone.

[00:27] This damn drug is the only thing that has taken away the pain and I'm looking over at

[00:32] the microphone and it's sort of like got this gravitating magnetic power to me calling me

[00:38] to do a podcast about pinball because I have pinball news to share with each and every one

[00:44] of you and as a thank you and I said this on the live, we had the least amount of people

[00:49] ever leave Canadian Spinball Podcast at the end of the month and I thought because I was

[00:54] going into surgery and I wouldn't have content up that people would leave the shores of Canada's

[01:01] Pinball Podcast, it has been anything but that so thank you so much.

[01:05] We had 742 going into the end of the month and now we're at 743.

[01:13] So as a thank you, there's so many well-able body pinball content creators and as Canida

[01:18] is injured and recovering, he's going to give you more than anyone else in the pinball media

[01:25] space right now and it's going to be fun.

[01:28] I'm going to say some stuff on this show that's going to be confirmations.

[01:31] I mean this.

[01:32] This is not a rumor.

[01:33] I have two very strong confirmations that are going to happen and they're both going

[01:39] to be maybe somewhat surprising to each and every one of you.

[01:43] Before I do that, I want to go around the horn a little bit and just talk about what's going

[01:47] on in pinball lately and don't think you're going to get like three episodes a week now.

[01:53] I'm just feeling really good right now.

[01:56] For those of you who have gone through surgeries and I had an epidural people like a freaking

[02:02] epidural, they didn't tell me this.

[02:04] I wouldn't have done it.

[02:05] I thought I was just going to have general anesthetics and then I'm on the operating

[02:10] room table and I see this guy come over like a trapper keeper.

[02:14] I know there's like really long needles in there and so now I know what it's like for

[02:19] all you women out there, my wife, who had to get an epidural.

[02:23] It's not fun, but you're not listening for Canada's spinal anesthesia podcast.

[02:29] You're listening to Canada's pinball podcast.

[02:31] Okay.

[02:32] So a few things are happening right now.

[02:33] A lot of people are trying to decide whether or not you get X-Men or whether or not you

[02:38] get Avatar.

[02:39] And I think for most people out there, probably for the majority of people, you're probably

[02:43] not looking to buy either game right now.

[02:47] And I think those people are the smart camp when it comes to these two games because in

[02:52] my mind, both of these games are going to come down to whether or not the code in the

[02:58] game is going to give you the kind of pinball enjoyment that makes you want to own the game

[03:04] in your home.

[03:05] I think if you play both of these games on location, you're going to have a good time

[03:09] and you could save yourself 13 or $15,000.

[03:13] Now that being said, I do think X-Men has a lot more toys in it.

[03:17] I think X-Men is the better shooting game.

[03:20] It just is.

[03:21] Like you could argue with me on this.

[03:22] It's not to say that Avatar is not fun to shoot, but it's not nearly as good of a shooter

[03:27] as X-Men.

[03:28] And I think X-Men's layout is also a lot more creative.

[03:32] And after that, when it comes to toys and mechs and wow stuff happening on the game itself,

[03:38] X-Men runs circles around Avatar in my honest opinion.

[03:42] You've got the Sentinel, you've got all these things happening mechanically.

[03:46] And when you ask people, just name me one toy in Avatar, nobody can give you one single

[03:52] toy.

[03:54] And then the JJP apologists are coming out of the woodwork again saying that like a game

[03:59] is the sum of its parts.

[04:01] And I get that.

[04:02] But if a game is $15,000, then some of the some of those parts or some of those parts

[04:08] better sum up to being some awesome freaking things where it looked like a lot of engineering

[04:13] went into that stuff.

[04:15] And I'm just not seeing it.

[04:16] And I do think people are giving Avatar a really big pass on not having any major mechanisms

[04:23] in the game.

[04:24] It doesn't feel like you're diving under the ocean.

[04:27] There's no big whale.

[04:28] There's a crab that's just sitting there stationary.

[04:31] If Stern made this game, I think people would be a lot more harsh on it.

[04:36] Now that being said.

[04:38] It's beautiful.

[04:39] Avatar is one of the most beautiful pinball machines I've ever seen.

[04:42] Walking up to the machine itself, it's very stunning.

[04:45] I just want there to be as much wow in the gameplay and in the mechanisms and in the

[04:51] experience of Avatar.

[04:53] I want to pinball moments and the magical mechs to have as much wow as the visual stuff happening

[04:59] on the physical game itself.

[05:01] Like the artwork is beautiful.

[05:03] The topper is amazing.

[05:05] You know, the UV lighting is another area.

[05:07] Like I'm watching people talk about this game and stream the game, but it's just not

[05:11] working the way they describe it.

[05:14] And here's the thing I've been thinking about.

[05:15] The whole thing about this UV eclipse, right?

[05:17] It's supposed to make you feel like the eclipse is overhead and the sun and the moon are touching

[05:24] and it's getting darker and darker slowly.

[05:26] The whole thing that's magical about an eclipse is that gradual movement of the moon blocking

[05:31] the sun and that should light up the bioluminescent world in Pandora.

[05:37] And when I look at the gameplay gang, it's not that.

[05:40] There's nothing gradual happening of the game getting darker.

[05:44] And I think I figured out why.

[05:46] They can't create this gradual effect if you look at the playfield of Avatar.

[05:50] It's not filled with lights.

[05:52] There are not nearly as many lights covering from east to west and north and south.

[05:58] That playfield as there is in Guns N' Roses, you know, Guns N' Roses can light up all of

[06:04] those little lights throughout the game to really create an effect that something is

[06:08] happening.

[06:09] Whereas in Avatar, the thing they want to light up to create that gradual effect of an eclipse

[06:15] happening is the UV ink, right?

[06:17] But the problem with that is you can't gradually light up the UV ink on the playfield.

[06:23] It's kind of all or nothing.

[06:25] So like you're playing the game and then all of a sudden things start to change color,

[06:30] but you never get that feeling.

[06:32] Like an eclipse is slowly starting to happen, like gradually moving over the game.

[06:37] And look, I would have loved for them to have nailed that, but it just doesn't nail it for

[06:43] me right now.

[06:44] And then from there, much like X-Men Ali, I think both of these games are going to come

[06:49] down to the code and the software.

[06:51] Who's going to be able to code their games to have pinball moments that are going to

[06:55] make you excited, that are going to get your blood going?

[06:59] I'm just going to say this.

[07:00] And this is why theme is so important because in my mind, it's a lot easier to get X-Men

[07:06] and the uncanny X-Men to create moments of excitement than it is in Avatar.

[07:12] Look, we know Stern's going to put the X-Men theme song into the game and that's going

[07:17] to be a moment, right?

[07:18] When you get there.

[07:19] I don't think it's going to start out right away.

[07:21] I think they're going to hold it to a wizard mode.

[07:23] But let me ask each and every one of you a question.

[07:25] When it comes to music and getting you emotionally going.

[07:29] If I walked up to each and every one of you and said, Hey, I'm going to give you $100,000

[07:36] if you can hum the theme song to Avatar.

[07:39] Just think about that for a minute.

[07:41] If I walked down the street and offered people $100,000 to hum the theme song to Star Wars

[07:47] or Indiana Jones or He-Man or the A team or heck, even different strokes I could do.

[07:54] I'm not going to do the different stroke song anymore.

[08:02] But you know what I'm saying?

[08:03] It's like that's it.

[08:04] When you hit the start button in Avatar and again, I think about moments in Pimbal and

[08:08] you hit that start button in a Pimbal machine.

[08:11] There needs to be a feeling that you're going on a journey that you know what you're here

[08:17] to do.

[08:18] And I was just thinking about this.

[08:19] You're a human being and you're playing Avatar Pimbal.

[08:23] Jersey Jack has a little camera on the front of the game.

[08:26] How come when you hit start, there's not a sequence in the game that basically shows

[08:32] you and then you morph into the Avatar version of you?

[08:36] I feel like they easily could have done that because that's what the whole damn movie is

[08:40] about.

[08:41] Human beings adopting an Avatar body to help the Navi sort of save the planet.

[08:48] And when you hit start in the game, does that ever happen?

[08:51] And look, Keith can put a freaking Greek diner menu in front of each and every one of us

[08:56] and say, look at all that's in this game.

[08:59] All of this is in the game.

[09:01] And again, back to that metaphor, but the sum of these parts, I don't care if there's

[09:06] like 30 modes or 22 modes.

[09:08] If it doesn't add up to something that's delectable and delicious, then what are we doing here?

[09:15] More does not equal more enjoyment.

[09:17] It doesn't.

[09:18] And that's my thing.

[09:19] I think it's way too early on both X-Men and Avatar to know they're going to deliver that

[09:25] magic.

[09:26] I just haven't seen it in any of the streams.

[09:29] I think they've both got a way to go.

[09:31] And the thing is this, by the time you're going to know whether or not it has it or not, we're

[09:36] going to be six months from now.

[09:38] So I don't think there's ever been a greater period of wait and see.

[09:41] So speaking of wait and see, we are going to see Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[09:46] And is most likely going to be sometime either like Monday or Tuesday of this next week.

[09:52] I think they're aiming for Monday for a full reveal of the game.

[09:56] When we get the full reveal, Order Banks will open up.

[10:01] But you know me.

[10:02] Do you think they're going to sell out?

[10:04] Well, with only 500.

[10:06] And if Melvin truly has captured a beautiful pinball experience in a box that not everybody

[10:13] can have, I think this game has a real good chance of creating FOMO where the other companies,

[10:20] they just make too many.

[10:22] Stern's going to make thousands of X-Men games.

[10:25] Jersey Jack is going to make thousands of Avatar games.

[10:28] A thousand CEs at 15K a pop does not feel like it's ever going to be something that's

[10:33] difficult to get.

[10:34] But if Melvin is making 500 Alice's and there's going to be roughly 300 at America and 200

[10:42] overseas and it's loaded, it's got that cool Cheshire Cat topper.

[10:46] Now that we've seen that, that is neat.

[10:48] I don't know.

[10:49] I still feel like at all of these prices, you want to have people play the machines,

[10:56] playing a pinball machine and making sure you love it.

[10:58] It shouldn't be something you have to do after you spend like 10 to $15,000.

[11:05] But that's where we are at in pinball.

[11:08] It was so much different when Stern Alice were 7,500.

[11:13] You could easily buy every single one and not lose any money.

[11:17] I've seen too many people now.

[11:19] They're all losing like $3,000 to $5,000 on every single collectible version of a game.

[11:25] I mean, isn't that just nuts?

[11:26] You're buying something because you think it's collectible and it's going to hold value.

[11:32] And that item is actually losing more money than any of the other editions of the game.

[11:39] So we're going to get Alice and then three units are going to pinball expo this year.

[11:44] So if you're going to expo, you're going to be able to play the game.

[11:48] I've never played the game.

[11:50] And as I've told Melvin, I'm not just shilling this game.

[11:54] I want to hear what you think about it.

[11:56] I think it's going to have way more toys than Avatar.

[11:59] I think it's going to have some unique stuff in it.

[12:02] I think it's going to be a work of art, but, but I don't know what the sum of the parts will be.

[12:08] There just won't be many of them.

[12:10] So a lot more to come on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland next week.

[12:16] All right, I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded.

[12:18] I probably shouldn't have done a show, but it just goes to show you how committed

[12:23] Canada is to giving you something you've never heard anywhere else.

[12:26] And I'm going to just rip the Band-Aid off right now and tell you two things that

[12:31] nobody else has told you.

[12:33] And these are confirmed.

[12:35] These are not rumors.

[12:36] These are happening.

[12:38] And these are things that we've been wondering about for a while.

[12:42] So I've been saying that Spooky Pinball could march in in December and sort of

[12:46] steal the stage, like have the game of the year and sort of drop a title that's

[12:51] going to remind us like everything we want in pinball.

[12:54] It's going to be based on something nostalgic and it's going to be the Goonies.

[12:59] I'm here to tell you right now.

[13:01] They do have the Goonies license, but unfortunately for you, the Goonies lovers out

[13:07] there, the Goonies is not going to be next from Spooky Pinball.

[13:12] I know even I had it on my calendar like a week ago, it's not going to be the Goonies.

[13:18] What I do know is this, the next game from them is going to be loaded with some really

[13:24] big mechs and toys.

[13:26] And I think what they show in December for the money they're going to charge for that

[13:31] game is going to make the folks over at Jersey Jack work harder at getting more

[13:36] mechanical fun into the game.

[13:37] Because if Spooky Pinball starts putting more mechs and toys into its games, they

[13:44] have no investors, they have no financial backing.

[13:47] If that little company in Benton, Wisconsin is going to deliver more loaded games than

[13:53] Jersey Jack with a billionaire backing it, something's wrong and we need to speak up

[13:59] more and we need to get more toys into these JJP games.

[14:02] So here's what the theme is going to be.

[14:05] And you know, it makes sense.

[14:07] It's not a theme you haven't heard before.

[14:09] And it also makes sense because we know that he's been working on a game for Spooky for

[14:14] a while and his name is Mr. Ben Heck.

[14:18] So Spooky's next game that will be revealed in December is going to be Ben Heck and Spooky

[14:27] Pinball making Evil Dead.

[14:31] It will be Evil Dead.

[14:34] And I heard the big mechanism in it is going to be that big cabin that's in the forest

[14:39] and it spins around and does all this awesome stuff.

[14:42] And so I think we're going to see something a la even more impressive maybe than the trunk

[14:47] in Theater of Magic.

[14:49] And so you're going to get major mech.

[14:52] You're going to get toys.

[14:53] You're going to get Evil Dead.

[14:55] And I bet you that Christopher Franci is on the art package.

[14:59] And so this is kind of like a niche theme, but it's a good theme for pinball because

[15:04] if you've watched Evil Dead, it's like campy horror and campy horror does really well.

[15:10] I think it said horror better a horror better the second time.

[15:13] Campy horror does much better for me and pinball than real horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[15:20] You got to have games with personality that make you laugh.

[15:23] And also we know unlike Avatar, we know they're going to have all the video footage from the

[15:28] movie or maybe movies where it's going to be synced up with the voice actors.

[15:33] They probably got the voice actor from Evil Dead to do callouts in the game.

[15:38] So that is going to be what is coming from Spooky Pinball.

[15:42] It is confirmed.

[15:43] It is happening.

[15:44] Canada is not going to be wrong on this one.

[15:47] So when you take it to pin side, you can say Canada said it's Evil Dead next, not Goonies.

[15:54] That leaves Goonies Beetlejuice still in the chamber for Spooky Pinball.

[16:00] The next three to five years for Spooky is going to be cool.

[16:03] I also don't think Spooky Ever is going to make 2,000 of any theme anymore.

[16:08] So expect Evil Dead to have a run of somewhere around 800 games.

[16:14] I think they want to make 800 of these games and then they're going to move on to the next.

[16:19] So we may see two Spooky titles over the next 12 months.

[16:24] Alright so let's end this show with something that's really strange.

[16:28] Like when I heard this I was like that can't be true but this is also confirmed.

[16:34] Now we've been wondering for a while.

[16:37] This Ryan McQuade walked around with his Sonic the Hedgehog homebrew game.

[16:43] We've all been wondering when that license was not obtainable by the company we won't

[16:48] speak about anymore, everybody wondered who has Sonic the Hedgehog.

[16:54] We've been attributing it to all these different companies.

[16:57] I've been doing it, you've been doing it.

[16:58] We've all been wondering because I do think we all believe that Sonic would be a great

[17:03] theme for Pinball.

[17:05] The damn video game character acts like a pinball when he runs through his world.

[17:10] I mean there's basically pop bumpers, he's shooting all over the place, he's doing loop-de-loops

[17:15] and I'm just going to say this right now.

[17:17] If somebody makes a Sonic the Hedgehog pinball machine, how do you not have a back box that's

[17:25] like Banzai Run where Sonic, one of those red springs you hit it and it shoots the ball

[17:31] up into the back box and that's where you do like horizontal move the ball and do a

[17:36] big loop-de-loop back into the game of play.

[17:39] I mean that would be the coolest way to do Sonic the Hedgehog.

[17:44] We know that's not going to happen because those were the Balli Williams heydays.

[17:48] Alright, so Sonic the Hedgehog.

[17:50] So I finally figured it out and you might be wondering how did you finally figure it

[17:55] out?

[17:56] Well, I've got some sources and when all of my sources are pointing in one direction

[18:01] and then I have one source buried deep within the industry and I said is it this, is it

[18:06] them and I asked it in a way I was like look all they want you to do because I'm about

[18:10] to do a show I want you to just tell me if they don't have it.

[18:14] I'm not going to ask you to tell me who has it but if they don't have it I just don't

[18:18] want to be wrong.

[18:19] I'm recovering from surgery man can you just give me something and let me know the truth

[18:25] and so I'm here to tell you.

[18:28] Sonic the Hedgehog has been licensed by a company nobody's been guessing it is no other

[18:36] than Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[18:39] Did you expect me to say JJP has the license for Sonic the Hedgehog?

[18:45] But then all of a sudden I was thinking about it like first of all JJP's got the weirdest

[18:49] line up of themes ever like it's really hard to collect their games because you're never

[18:53] going to want all of them.

[18:54] The thing is this I was thinking about it Mark Sidon is a video game nerd like he made

[19:02] Metroid he loves video games just as much as Ryan McQuade I'm not sure he loves Sonic

[19:10] as much as Ryan does but it makes sense now that Mark Sidon's game after Avatar will be

[19:18] Sonic the Hedgehog and now I'm starting to realize what the JJP lineup is we've got Eric

[19:26] Minier's Harry Potter in February then I think we're going to get Steve Richie's The

[19:32] Matrix sometime at the end of the year and then I think the game after that is going

[19:38] to be Sonic the Hedgehog from Mark Sidon.

[19:42] Now look they might have the license to Sonic and not make the game but the thing that is

[19:48] a hundred percent true is that Jersey Jack has the Sonic the Hedgehog license so take

[19:56] that to pin side and all of your forums and say Canada, Canada's given us more juicy news

[20:04] when he's recovering from surgery than everybody else and that is why you're a member of the

[20:10] Canada club I'm going to go pass out on the couch right now everybody be good I'll talk

[20:15] to you soon.

[20:40] I'm going to keep my head up I'm going to keep it going I'm going to keep my head up I'm

[20:45] going to keep it going I'm going to keep my head up cause life is about.
