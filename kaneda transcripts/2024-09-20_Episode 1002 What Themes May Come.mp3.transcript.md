[00:00] richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig, richtig

[00:30] that have come out. I'm gonna tell you what themes they were based on and you tell me how many of

[00:37] these games are a take my money now theme. Now there are a lot of really exciting themes in the

[00:44] rumor mill and it's about freaking time. How hard is it for these pinball companies to understand

[00:52] what we want. We want a theme based upon something we love, something we think about,

[01:00] something we engage with frequently. Not a movie we saw once just because it had cool 3D special

[01:07] effects. Not an obscure thing that like was here today gone tomorrow. Not a musical act that's

[01:14] only popular in Australia. No, we want stuff that has universal long lasting appeal. Alright,

[01:22] you start there. Then we want three mechs in the game that are fun. Three, not one, not two, but

[01:31] three main mechs in the game. Heck, I would just take one major toy and I would be happy if you

[01:39] look at most modern pinball machines for this much money and you say what's the one major mechanism

[01:45] that creates a moment of wow when you play this game. You would come up short on so many of these

[01:51] games I'm about to list and then you want theme integration, right? Is it fun to shoot? Have they

[01:57] made it perfect? I mean, I guess that's two things. You want the game to have good gameplay. Absolutely.

[02:03] Look, there's no excuse. There is no excuse in 2024 that a pinball machine should ever

[02:10] like make its way to customers and it doesn't shoot well. I mean, how hard is it to make a white wood,

[02:16] call up a few buddies, you know, have some people sign some NDAs, get some of the best tournament

[02:21] players in the world. Look, everybody remember this, a professional pinball player, they don't exist,

[02:27] by the way, but you get some of the top 10 pinball players in the world. They probably make about

[02:34] $13,000 a year in pinball earnings. If you offer them a few thousand dollars to play your game and

[02:43] help you design it, it would be a great game. There's a reason why Keith Elwin games play so well

[02:49] because he's one of the best players in the world. There's a reason why Jack Danger's games shoot so

[02:54] well because he's an amazing pinball player. So there's no excuse. Like it's almost like criminal

[02:59] that we have to like say a game should shoot well for this much money. And then you want

[03:04] theme integration. And I think anyone who saw my live last night and if you haven't, go watch the video

[03:12] where I had to showcase how Jersey Jack games have simply like nerfed theme integration because

[03:19] they've got whatever theme it is, they show you the movie clips with these like muted scenes.

[03:26] And it's removing all of the excitement. It's removing all of the moments that made those

[03:31] movies magical. And they're replacing it with just like callouts that are telling you what to shoot.

[03:38] So you've got these epic battles in Avatar and you don't hear any of the battle. You just hear

[03:44] a monotone voice saying shoot the right ramp, shoot the spinner, the multi balls arrive,

[03:51] like the wizard modes arrive in this like monotone voice. And I'm not saying it to be a jerk, but

[03:57] it's over. This way of coding a game is over. It's not exciting. And if that excites you and you want

[04:04] to invest in games that come at you like that, I don't know what to tell you. And I showed in that

[04:10] stream last night, Stern pinball gives you all the synced up video you want. Jaws is one of the

[04:16] greatest theme integrated machines of all time. Even if it doesn't have a wow mechanism, it definitely

[04:22] gives you everything else you want. Spooky pinball is able to sync up voices with clips. So many other

[04:29] companies are able to do it. So it's really just no excuse anymore. And especially if you're Jersey

[04:35] Jack, you've got all the resources, you have all the potential there. And every time they do a media

[04:41] day, and I loved going over there, they told us light storm gave us access to everything. And it's

[04:48] not a licensing reason why they're not doing it. It is a Keith Johnson Jersey Jack code decision

[04:55] not to have the sound effects and the actor callouts in those moments when they're showing

[05:01] them on the screen. And I think it's a huge mistake. And I wish more pinball content creators

[05:07] would actually like call it out and bring some attention to this because if more of us did,

[05:13] they would change this because it's just software. I mean, look at all of the feedback Stern got

[05:19] about the X men music, guess what they're doing? They're changing the music in X men because of

[05:25] the feedback. If you act like a newbie, like some other pinball content creators, and just rush at

[05:32] every single new game and fork over $15,000 acting like you've seen enough in the game, all that does

[05:39] is reinforce that these companies don't need to get better. They don't need to make the right

[05:44] changes. And we're going to continue to get an aim towards mediocrity versus an aim towards a masterpiece.

[05:51] And I mean that. All right. So 20 titles in the pinball world 20. Are you ready for these titles?

[05:57] People get ready. You're telling me when you have a captive audience of 40 to 60 year old men who

[06:04] want to buy pinball machines. This is the best the industry can do. Scooby Doo, Looney Tunes,

[06:13] Texas chainsaw massacre, venom, jaws, John Wick, X men, Abba, Queen, Funhouse remake, Toy Story 4,

[06:27] the Godfather, Elton John, Avatar, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Princess Bride, Weird Owl,

[06:38] Pulp Fiction, Barbecue Challenge, and Ninja Eclipse. Take a gun to my head as a marketer

[06:46] and pull the trigger people because we have so many companies making pinball. How did we end up here?

[06:53] Now here's the good news and here's the bad news. I mean, let's start with the bad news. The bad news

[06:57] is coming out of COVID, you had the most captive buying audience in the history of pinball.

[07:05] People wanted to buy everything and you dropped these themes as a way to capture that money.

[07:13] What a colossal marketing mistake by everybody. I mean, there's only a handful in here that are

[07:20] really good choices and I'm going to call them out right now. I think the good choices and I mean

[07:26] this based upon the audience, how many games you need to sell, the good choices in here are Jaws

[07:33] and Pulp Fiction. I think that's it. I think just Jaws and Pulp Fiction are the two that are like,

[07:40] all right, those make sense. Everything else, I think there's more going against it than for it

[07:46] and if I had to pick a third one, it would be Scooby-Doo. I mean it, if I had to pick a third one,

[07:52] it would be Scooby-Doo because Spooky Pinball making Scooby-Doo, you know, if they only made

[07:57] a thousand that game would still be in demand but 1964, get out of town with that many games.

[08:02] It's too many games, too many games for Scooby-Doo and so now we're on the precipice of what we're

[08:08] hearing is going to be a period in Pinball in which all of these like kind of B and C themes,

[08:15] they're going to go away and we're going to get Harry Potter from Jersey Jack Pinball in February.

[08:22] I know this and it's crazy that they kind of told us this because if there's anything that's not

[08:28] going to help Avatar sales, it's knowing that the New Jersey Jack game is right around the corner

[08:33] and yet it is done. Like it is ready to come out and it is a game where if they don't sync up the

[08:40] video with the voices, I'm just going to be done with JJP. I'm just going to be done because it

[08:45] just shows me they're not listening to any of the feedback. I don't think Joe Katz is going to do it

[08:50] that way. I'm praying they don't do it that way but man, oh man, oh man, when you look at all their

[08:56] games, they continue to use the video assets like it's a slot machine and not a pinball machine.

[09:03] So we've got that from Jersey Jack. I also know that Jersey Jack has 100% has the matrix license.

[09:12] I think that's Steve Ritchie's next. I think Steve Ritchie is going to make the matrix. I know it's

[09:18] going to be a challenging game to make because I heard if you get the matrix license, it comes with

[09:23] nothing from the movies. So it might be more of like a pirate to the Caribbean situation again,

[09:28] but as long as they do it right, Steve Ritchie with the matrix get voice actors that sound like

[09:35] the movie actors and just make that game rain down black and green and you will get customers.

[09:43] It needs to have mechanisms. It needs to have a phone booth. It needs to have bullet time and

[09:47] magnets and all that stuff. So we're going to get Harry Potter and then I think the matrix.

[09:53] Awesome. We know spooky pinball most likely has what? Beetlejuice. We know that. We know they

[10:01] have most likely the Goonies and they have most likely Gremlins. I forgot a title, ladies and

[10:08] gentlemen. I was thinking about which company did I miss 21 games people because I forgot

[10:15] Labyrinth from barrels of fun. How could I possibly forget my friends over there at barrels of fun?

[10:22] Labyrinth. Talk about not a theme I would have picked and they did not sell out. Again, my point.

[10:28] That game actually makes my point perfectly. This company's next theme is going to be so much better

[10:34] than the Labyrinth. We all know it. So what is barrels of fun going to have next? Let's go back

[10:38] to spooky. Then we'll go to barrels. So they have Goonies, Beetlejuice, maybe Gremlins. We know

[10:45] they do not have Sonic the Hedgehog, but somebody does. All right. I'll take Sonic over like 15 of

[10:52] those themes. I just rattled off and then who's got Sonic? Oh, we'll talk about that. All right.

[10:57] So spooky pinball. At least we know they're next like three or four games. They are really excited

[11:03] about. I know they also have Evil Dead. That is coming out. And I hope they don't make that

[11:09] Motorhead game. Trust me, guys. If you want to stay in business, don't make Motorhead pinball

[11:15] in the mix of everything coming out. All right. Barrels of fun. What are they going to make? Now,

[11:20] maybe they have Gremlins, but I do know that whatever they're going to do next, it's going to be

[11:26] based on something exciting and something nostalgic. And I think they're going to get something

[11:32] right this time. I'm not saying Labyrinth was wrong, but let's face it, people. It's not exactly

[11:38] a loaded game. It's not. There's a lot of scopes and Pes dispenser heads popping up all over the game,

[11:44] but there's really not a major toy in the game. What I'm looking for from Barrels of Fun on their

[11:49] next game is a better theme and more mechanical magic. You're not going to hide it with scopes,

[11:55] people. I don't want scopes everywhere. I don't mind them, but do the scopes after you've got three

[12:01] major toys designed in the game. Let's go over to Stern next. Stern pinball, right? This company

[12:07] passed on back to the future. Could be the biggest regret of George Gomez's life. How do you pass on

[12:14] back to the future? We could spend many, many nights and many, many glasses of whiskey trying to figure

[12:19] out that decision. How did Seth Davis let that decision happen? I mean, if I'm CEO of Stern pinball,

[12:26] I don't even care if nobody wants to make it. You're making the freaking game. So we know that

[12:30] they have dungeons and dragons. Really? That feels like another miss and we're most likely going to get

[12:37] King Kong from Keith Elwyn. Now that's going to work because Keith is the king of the monsters,

[12:44] and I would love to see a Keith Elwyn King Kong machine. And after that, right? Stern pinball,

[12:51] what they have in the mix, Metallica remastered. We've already seen Metallica. We know what the

[12:56] game is going to be. It's going to have nicer artwork. Pokemon, maybe? Maybe Pokemon? And that

[13:02] could be the game that bridges the divide, right? Between millennials and Gen Xers. Are we going

[13:08] to see Pokemon? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. I still think that's like a 30% chance based upon how big

[13:14] that property is. Even if Pokemon did come out, I still don't think the majority of people who buy

[13:21] pinball machines are really into Pokemon. Like back to the future would sell you more pinball

[13:26] machines than Pokemon based on who buys pinball machines. I'm serious. Like people who play Pokemon

[13:33] video games or Pokemon on the go or collect the cards are not going to be dropping like 8 to 12

[13:40] to $13,000 on a pinball machine. Sterns had rumors like Journey. We heard Motley crew for a while.

[13:47] I'm trying to think if there's anything else major. No, I mean, Stern to me really feels like a lot

[13:52] of these other boutique companies have swooped in and taken some of the dream themes. Let's just

[13:58] say it. Dutch pinball. Back to the future. It's coming. It's coming out in October of 2025,

[14:05] which makes total sense because that's back to the future month and there's that back to the

[14:10] future day. So a year from next month, we will see back to the future. A lot's going to happen in

[14:16] pinball up between now and then, but we know it's coming. 100% Joe Kamnikau is making it with the

[14:23] executive producer Bob Gale. Will Christopher Franchi be on the art package? I do not think so.

[14:30] So that's Dutch pinball. Dutch pinball X has Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. That game is coming

[14:36] out in just a few weeks. We shall see that. That's going to be an interesting market to see if

[14:42] Melvin nailed it and there's enough people to buy 500. If it were up to me, I would have cut that

[14:48] number in half just to have a sell out and make DPX a brand that's not for everybody. But you know

[14:53] what? He got talked into 500. Melvin, sometimes you just got to tell the boss man, no, and say,

[14:59] look, we're going to make this scarce. We're going to make this limited and we're going to come out

[15:03] of the gate with something that not everybody can have. Now look, 500 seemingly is not a lot,

[15:09] but then again, it seems like a lot. I don't know. There's something weird about 500 and Alice that

[15:14] seems like more than enough because we all got so used to J-POP's numbers and it was like, I'm going

[15:19] to make 16 magic girls. I'm going to make 200 razes. And all of a sudden when someone says they're

[15:24] going to make 500 of a J-POP inspired game, it feels like so many, but in the world of Stern

[15:30] and Jersey Jack and spooky, that's nothing. Oh, I forgot to tell you guys, first of all, thank you

[15:36] for being a subscriber to Canadian pinball podcast. We broke a new record, 741 at one point

[15:42] yesterday, then somebody left. We're back to 740. We have well over more subscribers to this show

[15:49] than every other pinball content creator combined on Patreon. So thank you so much. And as a thank

[15:56] you, and I'm going to remind you why you subscribe, and I'm also going to remind you that I'm taking

[16:01] the first two weeks in October off. I have to have a little surgery and a recovery. So I just

[16:07] want to focus on that and getting back to 100%. So I do ask each and every one of you, please

[16:14] just stick it out. Just stick it out with me. You don't have to like unsubscribe. I think I've

[16:19] given you way more content over the last few months that you can just give me a two week break

[16:25] to come back better than ever. And as a thank you for not leaving because I want to get to 800

[16:31] by Christmas. That's my other point. If just 60 of you invites a friend to a show, gives the gift

[16:38] of Canada to a wife for her birthday or Christmas. If just 60 of you brings in another one of your

[16:44] pinball friends, we're going to hit that milestone of 800. My overall goal is 1000 subscribers.

[16:52] We'll see if I keep doing interviews like I did with George Gomez, we're going to get there.

[16:56] And everyone on Facebook complaining that I'm not giving everything for free on Facebook,

[17:01] will eventually migrate over because you know, there's no substitute. You can put on fake Versace

[17:07] glasses and put on a fake show when the camera's on. But you know, Canada is the real deal both on

[17:13] and off the screen. All right, so here's the deal. As a thank you, I'm going to give you an exclusive

[17:19] on today's show. I'm going to end this show by telling you exclusively 100% confirmed what the

[17:28] next title is going to be from Play Mechanics. Play Mechanics is the partnership with CGC,

[17:35] which is Mr. Sharp and Mr. Richie, Mark Richie, who made Pulp Fiction. I'm going to tell you what

[17:41] their next title is. I'm going to end the show with it. You can take it to Jason Knapp. You can

[17:46] take it to freaking Pinside and you can't remove this watermark baby boy over there with my fake

[17:52] glasses on because you don't have any scoops ever. Oh, he said it. Okay, so let's keep going though.

[17:58] On what's coming out in the pinball world. So we talked about Jersey Jack, talked about Stern,

[18:03] we talked about Dutch, we talked about Spooky, a lot of interesting titles coming out from those

[18:10] people. The companies to me that are going to struggle, and I mean, they're going to struggle

[18:14] and walking the halls at Stern and seeing the halls at Jersey Jack, there's just not going to be,

[18:20] I think, like much viability anymore. If you don't have a great theme, there's also not going to be

[18:27] much viability anymore. If your strategy is solely to remake old games, the new games are so good.

[18:35] They're so deep. They have so much replay value. I'm really confused why so many of you just keep

[18:41] buying more new and box because once you buy a modern game like Jaws, it's so satisfying, so deep,

[18:49] so rewarding. There's so much in one single game. It almost makes it ridiculous and redundant to own

[18:57] like eight games when you have a game like that. All right, so we look at companies like CGC, they've

[19:03] got Pulp Fiction. I don't even know where the LEDs are. Like we're almost at the end of September.

[19:08] No LEDs are shipping. And then their next game is going to be Medieval Madness. And they've already

[19:14] made Medieval Madness two times before. Sure, you're always going to sell them. It's kind of an

[19:19] evergreen game, but it's boring. Just more Medieval Madness games. And then after that,

[19:25] they're going to remake Twilight Zone. Now, what's crazy about when they do that?

[19:30] Twilight Zone is arguably the most loaded game of all time. And if they come out with Twilight Zone

[19:37] and it's less than 13 and less than 15, it's really going to be hard for Jersey Jack and Stern

[19:45] to sell games that are going to be seemingly very barren next to a game like Twilight Zone.

[19:51] So I'm excited. I'm excited to see Twilight Zone come back. I'm also excited because it's going to

[19:57] be a CGC remake and not a Padredy remake. Funhouse and Padredy just don't have the same quality as

[20:06] CGC. So more Twilight Zones in the world. Crazy, because there's already thousands of them. So

[20:14] if you own a Twilight Zone and you love the game and you want the best, most modern version of it

[20:19] or with all the new bells and whistles, because it's going to have better lighting, it's going to

[20:23] have a better screen, it's going to have better sound, it's going to have better everything. And

[20:29] I think the mechs will be like Valley Williams mechs. So it's happening, people. It'll have a

[20:34] better clear code. Everything about it will be sexier. So that's what's coming from CGC. I'm

[20:39] trying to think who else I'm missing on this list. So I don't know what Jerry's got coming after the

[20:44] Princess Bride. I think those games should be trickling out. But again, it's like when you're

[20:49] in one of these companies where you're making like four games a week, four games a week.

[20:55] Stern Pimball is making like 800 games a week. Again, like I just don't get how you survive

[21:01] anymore when you can barely trickle the games out. Jerry has more licensed themes coming.

[21:08] And you know, we'll see. We'll see. Every time I see that platform up for sale, it's like people

[21:15] are trying to like bail for like 20 grand, then they slash the price to 19. I'll take 18, I'll

[21:22] take 17, 5. I mean, these people are like 25,000 in on all these modular kits. And then if you try

[21:29] to sell it, like good luck. I mean, now the big Lebowski's are selling used for like 11, 11, 5.

[21:35] Like it just happens. Like there's just too many of them out there. So I think that's where we're

[21:39] at everybody. That's where we're at. So let's do this right now. Let's end this podcast with a

[21:45] Canada exclusive. This is the next game from Play Mechanics and Mark Ritchie. I knew that it was a

[21:52] science fiction theme. I'd heard that many, many times. I was hoping it was going to be Blade Runner.

[21:58] I was hoping it would be something like the fifth element. I was hoping it might be something like

[22:03] Space Odyssey 2001. There's a lot of really amazing science fiction movies, total recall. But now,

[22:10] knowing what it is, and knowing that they've been working on it, it makes total sense. It's a license

[22:17] that Raw Thrills also has. So here you go. And I don't think this is going to work in pinball.

[22:23] I don't think the pinball buying demographic wants this theme. And I don't think the fans of this

[22:28] theme are into pinball really. So I think this is a little bit of a misstep. And I think they

[22:34] should have done more market research. And I think they should have called up Canada. Because I'm

[22:38] telling you right now, as big as this property is, you'd sell more gremlins, you'd sell more goonies,

[22:46] you'd sell more big trouble in little China, you'd sell more of Akira than you would of this title

[22:53] in pinball form. Everybody, thank you for being a club member. It's always a fun ride. And enjoy

[23:00] a Canada exclusive. Just make sure you give Canada credit when you say Canada is confirming

[23:05] that the next game from Play Mechanics and Mark Ritchie is the following. Have a great Friday,

[23:11] Canada out and join me tomorrow. Maybe for the spectacular. Brenda is in Miami. I am working

[23:18] on both kids all day long tomorrow. So we'll see if I can get it done. If anyone can't, it's

[23:22] Canada. Everybody, the next game from Play Mechanics. Peace out.

[23:53] A man walks down the street. He says, why am I soft in the middle now? Why am I soft in the middle

[24:01] of the rest of my life? It's so hard. I need a photo opportunity. I want a shot redemption. Don't

[24:07] want to end up a cartoon in a cartoon graveyard. Bone-diver, bone-diver, dogs in the moonlight.

[24:14] Far away in my well of the world. It's the beer, man. Beer, man. Get these butts away from you.

[24:22] I don't find this stuff a music anymore. If you see my body guard, I can see your long lost bow.

[24:33] I can call you Betty. Betty, when you call me, you can call me Addo.

[24:44] California, here we come.
