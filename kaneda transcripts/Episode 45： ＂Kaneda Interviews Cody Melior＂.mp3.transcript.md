[00:00] I think you're due to have gotten your ass in. It's you back there.

[00:02] Canada?

[00:04] I wouldn't talk down to me if I were you.

[00:14] Alright kids, on episode 45 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, we have a very special guest.

[00:20] We have Cody Miller from 904 Pinball Zine who joined me in a great conversation last night.

[00:27] I just want to let it air. It was a great talk. We talk about stuff like Ghostbusters, Ghosted Inserts.

[00:33] We talk about the Pinball price pulleys. We talk about whether or not there's a bubble.

[00:38] We talk about John Papaduke. We talk about Kevin from Skid B. We sort of cover the gamut.

[00:43] And it's just a really, really good conversation.

[00:45] So without further ado, I want to let you guys hear it. It's about an hour, but it will be well worth your listen.

[00:53] So ladies and gentlemen, let me roll the tape.

[00:56] Alright, I want to welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, a new guest to the show.

[01:00] And I know you guys are excited to hear interviews because that means it's not just me rambling for 30 minutes to an hour about Ghosted Inserts.

[01:08] I want to welcome Cody Miller, who is also sort of like the Godfather of his own Pinball Media Channel 904 Pinball Zine.

[01:18] You might have seen Cody's interviews. We're going to talk a bit about the man who interviewed John Papaduke before that whole thing blew up.

[01:25] But Cody, welcome to the show.

[01:27] Thank you very much.

[01:29] So Cody, for the listeners of this show who know nothing about you, give us a quick sort of just synopsis of your relationship to Pinball and how you are part of this hobby.

[01:41] Okay, I'll give you the BingBing Boom. I grew up with the 74 sky jump in the house that my dad kept from his arcade and Wyoming had in the early 70s.

[01:54] Eventually broke. I eventually played PC and console games. And basically, you know, I want to play Ninja Turtles and Bugs Bunny Pinball Party trash.

[02:08] I'm trash like Bugs Bunny Pinball Party and some other garbage. I wrote a plot.

[02:13] And then I stumbled upon Pinball again. When in late 2007, I moved to downtown Seattle and four blocks away from my apartment was this Kony Island themed pub called Shorties.

[02:31] First game was Spider-Man after the first game. I was addicted again to Pinball in my adult life.

[02:39] And I stumbled upon this scene called Skill Shot. And it's this treasure map. If you pick up one, if you never picked up one, pick it up.

[02:49] It's a treasure map and you just go around town. And when I, before I left, I was like, I never bought a game when I lived there because they were everywhere.

[03:00] And I just did the math in my head. I'm like, if I have a certain amount of games making a certain amount of money, I can live off this shit.

[03:07] So I moved back to, you know, Jacksonville 2009 and found all the Pinball machines. I took two years off just to do what I wanted.

[03:17] It's a burning man. Just travel coast to coast because I was just over IT stuff and eventually bought a Pinball machine, Terminator 2 and Batman Forever and then tell us from the crypt.

[03:28] And I stumbled on a record skateboard shop in 2011. I instantly connected with the dude in the store. I said, do you want a Batman forever Pinball machine here? And he said, yes.

[03:44] And I was like, that was easy. And I've been a collector operator since.

[03:49] Okay. So you went from being a player to a collector to an operator, sort of all a little bit simultaneously, it sounds like.

[03:57] And so this is what you do now for a living, right? You are a Pinball operator slash collector.

[04:04] Right. It took me three and a half years to figure it out. My second game I bought at a convention in Orlando and I drove it straight to my next location.

[04:16] And at that location, I called other operators and I was like, do you want to place games here and there? I was placing games for them because, you know, they're not creative.

[04:25] So it was the Spice got a Foddett Crip. There's like a body jewelry got the store and they this operator had Adams family there. I said, and he wanted to move his game out. I'm like, whatever. And so I said, I delivered my toast from the crypt as he pulled out his, his Adams family. I got 100% there. So I was like, win, win.

[04:46] Right. So what break it down? So I know there's always a lot of sort of speculation on what the relationship between establishment and operator is. Is it like a 50 50 deal? You go to these guys and you say, look, I want to put a pinball machine here.

[05:01] You take half the cut. I think have to cut or is it what's the split for like an operator these days? I love that question because you don't get what you want in this world. And you do not get what you need.

[05:14] You get what you negotiate. That's life. So each deal is different. Any operator that's giving 50 50 unlike new pinball machines is a moron.

[05:24] That because there's out there's a freeze out that get 100% on a brand new game because if you think about it, pinball is the entertainment and many aspects in the location. It's boring. A bar is boring. It's it's it's a it's some chairs. It's tables. It's a generic sports on TV like you haven't seen a touch down before. And pinball is the entertainment at a lot of venues and I think operators kind of they don't get that.

[05:53] It's a unique thing that should get it should get top earnings. Right. Well, that makes sense. I mean, especially with the prices of pinball machines these days, you're dropping a $6 to $8,000 device inside a bar that's going to get pretty beat on. You know, it's kind of doesn't make much sense to allow the bar to take half of that cut.

[06:17] So how many games do you currently have right now out on location and how many do you have in your personal collection right now?

[06:24] Almost every single game I own is out. Okay.

[06:27] 18 pinball machines out and 20 video games. I never wanted to do video games. I I I called everybody I knew I said, hey, this anybody who can route video games. I'll give you a location. I'll help you deliver the games. Nobody wanted it. A free business.

[06:45] Everybody said no. So I found a street fighter to an attack and an of this in an inventory was I just Simpson's I started buying that stuff too because it's.

[06:57] I mean, there's not much to it. You know what earns better pinball arcade.

[07:03] Pinball all day every day, but bang for buck. I mean, you get a $400 street fighter. Ooh, just buy them spy street fighters by mortal combats.

[07:15] Right. You know, I mean, they just even if you said to Godly hard like I have a street bar 250th anniversary kind of proud of this.

[07:24] They programmed it to be on Godly hard after the first one or two.

[07:31] You know, characters you fight and people don't care. They you know after a minute, they're pleased with their 50 cents. It's kind of funny. Whereas pinball they're like, well, I didn't get to play for 30 minutes on on 75 cents.

[07:47] You know, it's that's really obscene that people think that they should get half an hour of enjoyment out of the dollar on a new game.

[07:55] That's my only beef like about the new Ghostbusters and like modern games on route.

[08:02] It's not about all time. It's about it's about earnings man. It's not.

[08:08] And if you suck at pinball, you're not going to get your money's worth. You know, but if you're decent, you know, you still might not get your money's worth, but the games are flash.

[08:18] You know, you know, right. We heard a lot when when Ghostbusters came out and it was pretty apparent that it was a brutal game.

[08:25] A lot of people were saying operators are going to hate this game because people are going to get frustrated and not play it.

[08:31] But it sounds like it's a complete opposite, right? I mean, you want to game that's a little bit immediately gratifying, but also doesn't have like someone sitting on the habit for 45 minutes on one ball, like trying to unlock 40, you know, 31 modes.

[08:46] Well, like Lord of the Rings, historic has been a very I have one right. It earned very well. How I had it.

[08:52] I was magically gathering card shop that was really hip on it. Very long ball times. Some of my customers said, oh, I got to destroy the ring. I'm thinking, well, they sure got their money out of 50 cent.

[09:04] But Ghostbusters, every single operator, collector operator, I know.

[09:10] It's their best owner of any game they've had in recent memory.

[09:16] So let's let's talk about Ghostbusters and the issues that are plaguing it right now from an operator standpoint, right? Because we've heard so much about the issues with ghosted inserts and the issues with, you know, the ball jumping over the railing on the sides and the center drain issues.

[09:34] Do operators really give a crap about ghosted inserts or some of these other things that, you know, the collectors sort of freak out about?

[09:44] Operator now operator only cares about earnings collector operators are kind of twisted in the head because they they want the game to work right, but they understand that.

[09:56] I mean, if it's a new game, it should work 100% on charging a buck, right?

[10:01] Right. You know, but we have we have one locally at a bowling place in St. Augustine and since about, I mean, about two days in, the slimer doesn't work.

[10:14] Well, this operator does not fix it and it's still a buck.

[10:19] So what do you do to say what make it 50 cents or do five cents? Do you eventually like fix it?

[10:27] But another operator I know has I can attest that didn't once come out now do work out of the box.

[10:34] A friend of mine bought a pro slimer work day one out of the box is close to 100% as the met can.

[10:43] That was a production date of a week prior to that. But there's other ones on route and played and they work.

[10:51] But yeah, they should work right. Right. Well, what's your right right now out of your variety of pinch have out there?

[11:00] Like what are your top earners on location right now? Super Mario brothers.

[11:05] Really? All day every day. It's a me Mario. He says more money please. He's so fucking polite.

[11:14] You know, whereas it gets most unfortunately a lot of customers doing not hit star.

[11:20] He talks to any operator or any collector operator they're they're gonna attest to that.

[11:25] You know, whereas more is like it's a me give me your wallet.

[11:29] Right. Right. Back in.

[11:32] Okay, AC DC pro. I mean anything like modern pretty much burns.

[11:40] X files just fine. But but for me it's bang for buck.

[11:46] Like I don't have much I don't have much in Mario.

[11:50] I don't have much in X files or I mean how I have a big house. I don't it.

[11:56] It's the only one around the universe.

[11:59] Founded some don't place in Tampa and brought back from the dead.

[12:04] I don't really have much in it but bank bank for bucket or it earns better than like a new game would.

[12:10] Right.

[12:11] Almost new game. So it's like if you have a cheap game you know to me that's what it is.

[12:16] Like if you have a new game it better earn because if it plummets and it earns what like a $2,000 game should earn proportionate.

[12:24] It's all relative. Sure.

[12:26] It's just like you're doing you know you're doing a favor to pinball players but you know.

[12:34] Right. Well it's interesting so like when you look at new inbox machines now like are you looking to put.

[12:44] You're so you seem like you're looking to find games to put on location that you could probably get for like a good price.

[12:50] But that will be enough of a good theme to attract people to jump on it right so it's super Mario Brothers earning great.

[12:56] I mean why would you even bother you know with these new prices of $7,000,000 like you're going to have to work five times harder in terms of getting your ROI on those kind of games.

[13:09] Right. Do you even like look at new inbox now or do mainly look at stuff that's just used and available at a good price.

[13:15] Right. So I only have one like I only got ever got one new inbox game. I traded a routed Lord of the Rings for a new inbox ACDC about three years ago.

[13:27] Is win win. I mean the guy sold it instantly for like $5,500.

[13:33] And I intend on getting a good spusters pro. I'm trying to wait out the.

[13:40] I guess the slimer Mac problem. I don't call it ghosting because ghosting is already in its firm for LEDs. I call it separation anxiety.

[13:50] That's what I call because it looks like that and it happens on Spider-Man, which is a Genesis game called separation anxiety.

[13:58] But yeah, I would get a ghost fusters pro. I have a movie theater location. I just talked to them today about I intend on doing it.

[14:08] I just I would sell older games to facilitate it because all my research of other operators telling me that it earns like no other game.

[14:18] I mean, hands down. Right. It's a me. It's a hit. Right. Because I put you know I helped my friend pick it up and I played it. Play for four hours straight last week. Right.

[14:29] It's yeah, and it's I think that's why people are probably so frustrated with the issues is that on the other side of the coin.

[14:37] The game is so much fun and addictive to people right. So it's like nothing worse than I love the game.

[14:44] But every time I stare down at the play field, I'm you know, I'm frustrated because I'm seeing ghosted inserts and clear coat chipping.

[14:52] So have you been following are you on your own pinside code and you've been following all the drama around ghost busters and and stern sort of lack of response to the collector on the machine.

[15:04] Yeah, I watch it. I'm high protein on the inside and I kept an eye on it.

[15:14] What do you think they're going to do? I mean, what do you think if you were if you bought an $8,000 new box ghost busters, Ellie, right.

[15:22] And you were having some ghosted insert issues or separation anxiety issues. What what do you think their response is going to be?

[15:31] I mean, we can't fix it. So you have to throw them a new play field.

[15:39] I mean, if they're fortunate enough to live in that like a city, there's always tax. And what happens with this is from my experience and I've seen of other people is when they have a problem, stern has been good about sending parts or played populated play field.

[15:59] When the AC DC premium play field was just mud. Right. They sent new ones. I've known people with a trauma. I know people with Metallica and problem. And to me, some of these things are not like new play field new game worthy.

[16:19] I have seen people get new gate. I don't want to say for every instance, but sometimes new games or popular pay fields. I have seen that happen for certain things.

[16:30] Talk into a local dealer. He believes that it's not it's not all of them. And it's not a lot of them. And it's something that they'll be able to narrow down.

[16:44] How mad would I be if I bought a good spusters of Ellie that's got insur problems. I don't know. Like I would have an route right now still earning. That's for sure.

[16:57] Right. Well, it's going to be interesting because I know Gary Stern actually has started to respond to some of the the owners individually.

[17:07] And it sounds like Stern is going to have some sort of play field program that they're going to set in place with distributors to sort of let people know what their fix is. So I think this is sort of become the most prevalent dialogue and dramatic situation all summer and pinball.

[17:26] And it's going to be interesting because I think that these collectors they're not operators right and they spend so much money there. I feel like people are going to demand populated play fields because we know that most of the guys who own these things couldn't possibly do the service themselves.

[17:42] So we'll see how that plays out. But are you in terms of like so everything you buy pretty much goes on location like you're like I'm going to buy something to put it out there to make money off of right. I don't have do you have any machines in your home at all or is it all out.

[17:59] Yeah, I've got a jokeers that's a it's just a chambles. I got to eventually fixing that for route. That's that's it. I mean that's really about it.

[18:11] Right. Okay, so like is it what's the market like right now for as an operator like is business booming right now. Are you seeing a resurgence in Pumball we keep hearing about that on Pinside and I always wonder like is it as big as Pinside says it is or you know I definitely see more barcades popping up in New York City. I see more pinball going on to location.

[18:34] What's business like in 2016 compared to when you got started. Okay, I'm going to kind of throw a Seattle under the bus here. So when I moved there in 2007 I got hooked October November and went everywhere in 2008.

[18:52] And for this being one of the mecca's for Pimball I would play the tech from ours with half half for all the GI out I play medieval manises that are just just just total black play field just dirty and people would accept that.

[19:10] I know you were thankful that the attack from Mars or medieval mass on a route but I mean back then you could put anything out in like the hot spots and it earned and I ever how they are now I've been there since 2010 it got a little better but we're playing a Dracula and half the lights are out.

[19:31] That's not acceptable in that in this is like one of mecca's and now it seems like coast to coast because in 2014 I had a IT troubling gig I did servers routers switches and all that jive at a bank and I went to like set New York City you know I was in LA you know I was in Texas you know I was like everywhere I went to every barcade I could and the quality is there.

[19:58] And people are playing games like you know people put games out because they love Pimball and they want to get back but if it doesn't earn it's not going to be out and most of the games I I I know I say it's but I think most games are out right now they're used we're not on route 10 years ago they were like in someone's house in an operators warehouse they might have been broken on route so we're at this point where you lost stuff around now.

[20:28] It's not on route and then there's new games and so it's it it is an upswing I don't I mean I as it's not as one.

[20:38] I'm getting you locations every year like I'm preparing for new spots I'm not thinking well I'm going to start dealing games if I ever get the board I'm thinking about being a dealer yeah then we're hitting a peak in the market in general but I'm certainly not.

[20:55] What do you mean by that like so explain what is me being a dealer mean for games like you like flipping games or restoring games.

[21:02] Let me all that drive I mean that there's still a market for that see there's more collectors than there are people that'll flip and and um basically it's you know this applied a man factor there's scarcity in the market for all games even if it's a

[21:24] turd like wipe out where is it I mean like if you a lot of these games you can't find like used to be at all times you can find you know again away you can find I don't know common stuff yes right but now it's like these common games are like a thousand more than they were two through years ago and they're being they're being collected more than flipped and all games are becoming harder to find.

[21:54] So what are we doing a lot of people are buying new games because they can't get what they want why not like why not this is the time to just buy what you want if you can afford it and not wait for oh I'm going to wait to get it used from some collector later I mean that people everybody's buying everything like we're it you know dealers I know like that cell stuff for a living.

[22:23] They've set for the past year it's hard to find pinball to flip to sell.

[22:27] Right now do you let's let's talk about that because do you think we're getting to a point where you we've got like I would say the most of the pins that people are collecting whether either you go new in box but you've also got just you know tons of games from the 90s and early 2000s as well that are restored or home use only do you think it's going to get to the point though where there's just a lot of things that are going to be good.

[22:52] Where there's just oversaturation of games that are for sale or are there just are collect the amount of collectors is growing each year where you know if you take a game like tells the Arabian nights there's not that many available for the collector but you know is it going to are we going to get over saturated because there's also so many new games coming out I mean I think I counted like six new in box titles are going to be coming out in 2016 alone and who knows what the future holds.

[23:21] With all these new boutique companies popping up like are we going to reach a point where the bubble is going to burst I mean everyone's been speculating about that like what are your thoughts.

[23:31] This isn't a stock.

[23:33] This is a real item. This is there's no stock options up and down for pinball machines so it's a it's a very very very very finite market for restored stuff.

[23:47] That's a niche market if anybody is in that market they're like walking on egg shells because it's not easy to get someone to pay seven eight nine 10 grand for restored 15 grand for a restore game that's a finite market but anybody wants a Bobo 2000 dollar DMD game.

[24:08] There's a lot of people out there that haven't bought a pinball machine yet.

[24:12] Decent eight titles are no you know for four or five six thousand dollars there's still people out there that want it that they could sell to so there's more people out there.

[24:26] That don't own pinball machines and do and there's there's a I would say there's more people out there that would would buy pinball machines if they got it if they understood it and if they they thought it made sense or at least tried then then probably own them now so this this theory of a bubble is kind of ridiculous I mean I've heard this about 10 years ago or seven years ago and you know these you know it's it's not really a theory that's holding up.

[24:55] Especially because stuff I want I can't find you know if I if it's hard for me to get a duplicate of a game then it's like it's getting you know it's there's a there's just really fiery scarcity right but once I can get stuff really if I can get five more years tomorrow it's deflating but I can.

[25:17] Right I think it's true you know I know I noticed that in the even in the arcade world you know there's like everyone always say and you see this in on pins I like the price police like they always try to say what something's worth but something's only worth what something is worth what it takes to pry it from the hands of another collector I would always I'd always go on the arcade forms and be like I really want a neo geo like a restored one what's it worth it.

[25:46] What's it worth and everyone would be like 800 bucks so I'd be like all right I'm offering a thousand dollars to a for a mint neo geo like you know for slot nobody would want to sell it from their collections right because they're still hard to find and then I'd be like all offer 1500 bucks and they all be like

[26:04] canada you're a fucking spoil Brad asshole who's ruining this hobby because you're trying to inflate prices but still no one would sell it so I'm like that it's I think the same is kind of true you know in pinball I think what I think the games are going to sort of be maybe on their own sort of bubble are just the new inbox games because I think on some level you're gonna it's I think there's gonna be an inability for so many new inbox titles to hit within a year and all good

[26:34] get like 10 grand from collectors right because those games are not going to go on route you can't tell me Cody that like the big Lebowski or hobbits or you know what else thunderbirds if it comes out I mean these games are now causing I mean people are not putting go especially on route really some people might but for the most part these premium price pins it's going to be interesting to see if they all can sort of find homes

[27:03] with them all hitting within such a short period of time I mean what are your thoughts on that I mean it's at the time it's at the point now where three pinball machines new inbox are going to cost you 27,000 dollars.

[27:16] Okay, Stern knows what they're doing whether Jack's doing more right than wrong because games are being made I think that the philosophy of shipping them to operators first was smart.

[27:33] No comment on how they're holding up on route from my experience big Lebowski there might someone might route it side funny side note I I threw down 250 bucks on predator when it they said he said he was going to make it before like they they showed anything and when they said oh give us more money I'm like no I didn't play it so I only had 250 and because I yeah that that's as much as it was worth to me you dodge the ball

[28:03] I also lost 250 on predator because I went into and I offered to buy a guy spot from him for 500 bucks and he sold it to me and I was like 250 that's non-refundable and the same thing happened I was like uh and I mean did you see on I know we're sort of side trick a little bit but you see the the court documents on that that just hit this week.

[28:25] Yeah, I've gotten letters about hey he's in from miscellaneous lawyers like hey it's in chapter seven I'm like it's 250 dollars and the grand scheme I life big deal to you know I just want my shirt this is I survived predator gate you know but like number 81 that was my number on the back and he referenced me in like two or three whoever else is going to route it and the interview says well there's people that are going to upgrade on you know I'm like oh yeah that's me I was going to put that in a movie theater.

[28:54] So he has a chopper a chopper is going and I was like what's the joy is it like are you okay.

[29:01] Uh chopper give my 250.

[29:04] Well there was like someone someone someone shared the basically the bankruptcy files that was really interesting because I mean basically what Kevin's trying to do is declare bankruptcy and not let people know where the million dollars went and it's just kind of crazy.

[29:24] I mean there's like these you know there's like these instances where like he he took out like 97 thousand dollars from skippies account into you know and wrote it like gave it to him personally I know he tried to buy his white or he bought his wife a house for like 30 thousand dollars went to that.

[29:43] The speculation is he went to some offshore islands a few times and you know people are wondering if you set up accounts there.

[29:52] I mean that'd be I don't know if that guy is smart enough to do that but it's just crazy that he is waking up every day with all those people's money and not a penny has been retrieved.

[30:05] I think that is along with J-pop and I know Cody you actually you interview J-pop right before he brought his empty cabinets to to expo what what was that like talking to J-pop.

[30:19] It was interesting because I usually I typically do a video interview and I had to send him questions beforehand when I was emailing him back and forth online and he said how is this going to be done I said a video.

[30:34] He says oh I I don't do video so I had to run to radio shack and get a mic tested on the way there and but yeah it's it's an interesting thing I was thinking today about it and a nutshell that he's kind of Willy Wonka pinball but with no loop of loop of us to build the games.

[30:56] So I mean he just Willy Wonka he just a dude and it's kind of creative. They got really great art from Zombie Eddie and he had other people working on audio and things.

[31:10] He didn't say this is off the record so I'll just say it he said that when I was talking to him that at one point he was offered to do Avengers at Stern I don't know whether that's true or not but that's what he said and he declined.

[31:25] So then he kept doing you know magic girl and things like that and he was let's just say he was working on other stuff in the back so he kind of was working on what far too many things at once even he focused on one game.

[31:45] You know when I asked him in the interview I said so you're making the game you want to make and he says no one making the game that people want I should have known at that point I'm like no like I listen to all his other interviews I'm like at that moment I'm like no he's it's no right this isn't going to work out right.

[32:04] I mean I think it was a really good assessment I mean I actually I mean I took a lot of flack because I started talking to John.

[32:11] Shush like I remember he was supposed to reveal magic girl to the world I think it was like in December I don't even know what year it was I think it was like 20 it was a 2014 I think it was to be the reveal and so I started talking to him probably in like October of that year and I was like look John like I've been hearing so much about magic girl.

[32:33] I really want to you know I think we should reveal to the world in a better way because at that time all pinball reveals were just the biggest the I'm a marketer they were like the shittiest reveals I've ever seen of like an exciting product and we were going to get John a big exclusive with wired.

[32:53] And we had all the wheels ready but you know the editor would just be like well is can we go shoot it is it finished and it would just be like month of the month of no no no no no no.

[33:04] But talking to John like you know it's it is a little sag because I do think in his head the guy is a pretty much a design genius when it comes to pinball but like you said he needs the oompa loompa to sort of make everything and he had he had nobody and he was and he just got lost in his own web of.

[33:22] Trying to in you know reengineer the entire thing whether or not you should all the way down to like the bolts on the freaking legs to make them spikes you know just it just he couldn't and he couldn't finish anything and and I think it's a shame and he probably should have taken that avengers job with Stern and who knows we maybe would have seen a ghost busters designed it is pop a Duke machine from Stern with zombie Eddie on it.

[33:50] He had people help along the way and it's it's cognitive dissonance it's like he did just didn't know like he really believed.

[34:01] Like it gets somehow magic magic work and that's insane.

[34:07] And honestly I would I just have to say like I can always be for myself I won't give anybody a lot of money without a guarantee and even guarantee writing all my deal my dealings I only do handshake deals honestly if I if I don't if I don't if I need a contract I don't trust you I just do handshake deals in my business but I'm not giving someone 10 15 20 30 grand that hasn't made a pinball machine.

[34:37] In X amount of years that doesn't have a company behind him that it's it's you know it's it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's an interesting question so who's the bigger fool right J pop or some of the guys who gave him who paid for all three games and full before it's not even that it's not even that because if you can afford it you'll do it that you know and even if you can't you know you'll you know you'll eat the right you know the result of that but I'll

[35:07] Most most people that that put money down that was extracurricular that was you know spending free you know fun money right and it wasn't fun you know it's socks but you know you know it's it was a gamble it was an option and just like the people are buying new in box games if this is going back to that I met people to have like boxes of of the injuries out of the house or other games in their house they thought it was an

[35:37] investment it's a product right you know it's a game I think that's that's fading away that was the hype for that is fading away outside of like a specialist Ellie is is worth you know well what's

[35:54] you have that in the box if you have to right yeah what's so interesting so I have a ghost bus is Ellie on order luckily mine has not

[36:02] shipped with any issues and and right now the line is frozen so I'm kind of excited because I might get one of the few that has the

[36:11] Kerr the we're stirring correct the issues before they ship so it's getting to the point where like maybe a late run ghost

[36:19] busters Ellie new in box will become the rarest and the most sought after right and look what confused me too is and I

[36:26] agree with you Cody's a lot of people were speculating on a lot of pins and I often hear that like Avengers Ellie was the one

[36:32] that burned everybody transformers continued the burn but you know because people were still chasing the next

[36:40] tron Ellie they were tracing like the big him you know big him back him the B.I.B. ACDCs so but but you know what when I when I

[36:49] went in on ghost busters it was so easy to reserve an Ellie you could just send any distributor or hundred bucks

[36:55] that's all they that's all Trent required I could have bought five I could have given a check for five

[37:00] hundred bucks and had five new in box and flipping them has you know has been super simple I mean I

[37:08] got a guy on the hook to buy mine for 9500 I paid 8000 for it now I'm still not sure I'm gonna

[37:16] sell it just because I just might want the pin I mean I think it might be worth just keeping that pin and

[37:20] just waiting on it but it's going to be interesting you know to see what the future is for these Ellie's and if

[37:29] it can be a sustainable you know sort of short term investment for people because I because I when I look

[37:35] at the habit especially people are flipping those things I just saw some guy put a habit S.E. up for sale today

[37:40] for 7500 it's like people are losing money on these things in short term sort of emotional purchases and

[37:48] they're not all gonna hit I don't know about losing money if you pay eight grand and you pay any

[37:55] plate 500 times at a buck of play you're not really losing your butt and you know that they're kind of like

[38:03] that's true you want a game and you've owned it you're like cool you got it out of your system

[38:09] you know it's what is that worth is that worth five hundred dollars that you owned it is it worth a

[38:13] thousand is that worth a hundred like the value like everything has a value right so like once I've

[38:21] had games I'm like cool I'm over it now I don't have that kind of suspense in the back of my head like

[38:26] oh I'm looking for it and I want it I don't know I don't like what you know wondering when I'm going to

[38:31] get this game and yeah it's they're gonna keep making you know they're making them well I mean

[38:39] like it's it's it's what's fun about this era of pinball is we've never had the the amount of

[38:47] companies making new pinball machines like they were there there was always what just like you had you

[38:52] had stern you had belly Williams your data east but Capcom but got Lee but they there was never

[38:59] the volume of companies that there is now all jockeying for collector dollars right I mean right now

[39:05] you've got I'm gonna try and count them so you got spooky you've got JJP you've got stern

[39:12] you've got Dutch pinball you've got highway pinball you've got home pin with their thunderbirds

[39:20] you've got I'm at six right now I'm missing any who am I missing you've got oh you've got planetary

[39:27] pinball with the remakes right that's seven plus you got the pinball circus guys that they ever make

[39:35] that I mean so you know so my point is all these companies and some of them are are structured

[39:41] right now where they're gonna have factories that should be able to pump out more than one title

[39:47] per every few years so I'm excited because I I love the fact that you know we could have a

[39:52] Star Wars I the rumors that toy story is gonna be JJP's number four Pat Lawler is gonna be JJP's

[39:59] number three you know there's me a Batman re-themed sounds like coming from Stern there's just so

[40:05] many games coming out that every you know every six months we're gonna see you know a pinner two

[40:11] available I mean that's exciting I mean if you said that 10 years ago people would be like you're

[40:16] crazy yeah it was it was I mean you've even been looking at the early years of Stern it was rough it

[40:23] was all like striker extreme Hyrule or Casino I mean it was yeah I mean they were I would never

[40:34] bought like if I was an operator I wouldn't have bought that stuff like I would have kept Adam's

[40:38] family out I would have kept like a South Park like South Park's still earned but yeah volume wise

[40:47] it has been a lot higher and pinball you know with a you know you had catcom you had say you got

[40:55] Williams but I think you know the unique games coming out like Big Lebowski would not have come

[41:04] out 10 years ago Ghostbusters see a lot of these games like Ghostbusters you say well you could say

[41:13] it could have happened in the 90s but why not wait why not let the nostalgia build like they didn't

[41:23] have to happen in the 90s right so ACDC could happen the 90s 2000 early 2000s you know it's uh I

[41:31] mean my question is how many good themes are left like good themes that could sell like ACDC like

[41:40] maybe Ghostbusters I don't know I mean Star Wars but that's not that's I mean it's kind of a rehash

[41:47] right I mean like I think there's like I think there's a good amount of nostalgic themes that

[41:54] Stern could go after JJ I mean like I mean you can go into like Ninja Turtles you can go to

[41:59] Thundercats you go to He-Man you know you can go through all the 80s cartoons that people loved

[42:05] and make amazing machines based on the you know the freaking smurfs and I'm there's just something

[42:10] about if you look at the buyer of these machines now especially the collector who's in their 40s

[42:16] and 50s if you look at the error that is nostalgic to them it's right in that sweet spot right and

[42:23] I mean there's a reason why even like a show like Stranger Things is so popular right now on Netflix it's

[42:30] this like 80s 90s like resurgence is is gonna be around for a while and I think Stern is

[42:38] learning that I mean even with like the 66 Batman re-themed that is the rumored to happen I mean

[42:44] the fact that Stern now can make money a second time over on on machines that have already been

[42:51] R&D and just you know reskin it is I think you know genius move on Stern's part

[43:00] it's happened in Pimball and it should have happened more by now family guy with Shrek I mean

[43:06] family guy why why wouldn't that be remade they made like 400 of it um right yeah yeah it's uh

[43:17] I know you know Stern knows the demographics I don't know if the other companies know what their

[43:22] demographics are but Stern knows knows what they're doing they know their demographics

[43:29] it's people in their 50s it's people in their 40s um I think X factor is are people in their 20s

[43:38] and 30s gonna buy Pimball machines as much as people in their 40s and 50s I have no way of telling

[43:43] they can't afford it they can't unless you're rich and then you have your iBanker there's no way

[43:49] people in their 20s are dropping like eight grand on a machine you just can't afford it I mean

[43:54] believe in five I mean like you you know if you have good credit I mean the you know bubble you know

[44:00] the the next we are in the credit bubble right now we are the biggest credit bubble in the history

[44:06] of man and I don't know I mean if you have it use it if you have it uh utilize it and build up the

[44:15] best you can and that's X factor two of of of Pimball is people on credit and I don't know how many

[44:21] people are buying people in games on credit but I'm sure they are um why not right why not

[44:30] I mean most of the people I know who are in the Pimball like the the concept of even owning a

[44:35] machine to them is so foreign I swear well especially I'm in New York City too because it's like

[44:40] they don't have a room and secondly it's you know they're they're just working hard to pay their rent

[44:45] and so the notion of of an 8000 on a machine is super surprised into them uh but you know

[44:53] throughout America though and I've been to all the different conventions and expose there's

[44:58] plenty of multi-millionaires out there that if you know collecting Pimball is a lot cheaper than

[45:04] collecting cars and collecting watches and you know and other other areas of entertainment it's

[45:11] not that bad um you know one one Mercedes S class it's not even a collector car is like 120

[45:20] thousand dollars now so you could slice that up into an amazing game room of new and box Pimball

[45:24] machines but what what Cody what gamer are you most excited about that's currently like new and

[45:31] what game like looking forward are you really hoping comes out that is a theme you've been waiting for

[45:38] um i guess buster's is great i'm i'm i like playing in tournaments um i run tournaments in Jacksonville

[45:48] it's a players game i really enjoyed i played the le shortly at the at a southern fried it's

[45:55] the first i plunged the ball and the first thing to it was to hit one the madness links

[46:00] and through through the ball up the left out the left loop again and it's a very dynamic game there

[46:08] isn't anything quite like that there really isn't there's not a game quite like uh good spacer's

[46:14] premium alley or even the private pros neat um alien i wonder because it's tennis norm i mean i

[46:25] it's tennis norm and makes uh great flow uh unique shots in games uh shopping out a

[46:33] demolishment for a customer uh right now and it he really makes uh unique shots in his games

[46:40] so he had worked on that um but uh you know you got to wonder like why he left so early on i mean

[46:46] that whole that whole thing was kind of sketchy if you're asking me i mean he kind of just like

[46:50] jump now now i mean he he's a higher gun and he works on what he wants to work on that's i mean to

[46:58] me that that's that's what's up with him because he's he's worth another games too um you know

[47:05] with the p3 and this and that and like why are you gonna hang out after you did your part

[47:12] and i mean there's there's a lot more to it i mean designing uh

[47:17] that's saying it's simple but you know you designed the layout of a game the rest of it's like the

[47:22] mechanics they're not gonna have them around for mechanics and things like that um you know we

[47:26] eat you and now you can do stuff with uh with sternum which i'm really excited about i know he's

[47:33] been working on uh he's all he's been working on play fields right you constantly on his talk

[47:40] what have you played p3 what are your thoughts on multi morphec and if it can you think it's a viable

[47:47] technology for this hobby i'm sorry this you know these these um caught David buttholes it's a scam

[47:53] all these all these big fec's where they're glorified ipad games um fruit ninja and garbage like that

[48:02] and and they earn and they earn and and that that factor of having a screen um it's it's

[48:10] or you know the you know flashiness is a big deal i mean that's why you have to have LEDs and a

[48:15] pay them all the same now do you know it's you know um you know hobbit and with the vaz and stuff

[48:20] in that looks like visually like it um most people play you know care more about the play field what

[48:28] what's going on with the ball but um yeah i mean i i look at people play my games and i even play them

[48:34] and i think like a customer i'm like this this isn't it's a ball sometimes i just think like it's a

[48:40] ball like i know the rules i'm like all right cool on shoot for this this that that you have to have

[48:46] you know sometimes you have to have that wow factor but fcs aren't going to be barian p3

[48:51] you know i mean that that to me would be the place to sell it that's that would be the place to show

[48:56] it off and to kind of hustle it would be like you know david bosters and um if you give them a chucky

[49:03] cheese they would earn they'd probably would earn because so as an operator you know game like that

[49:09] that just looks like it's so much different and has so much more visual sort of pop to it

[49:15] is gonna do well no it has neat mechanics and um it's like visually pleasing but i wouldn't i don't

[49:24] think it would earn on ral really because but but you think like at those locations you mentioned

[49:30] they would do better because that type of location so right right like i mean a movie theater like

[49:35] at a movie theater i have a doctor who in a revenge of Mars or a revenge of Mars is very sci-fi

[49:40] people play a doctor who i mean there's so many who beins out there you know even if you don't

[49:45] know doctor who it's a good looking game um i would like to see what the earnings are i i really would

[49:56] right so i you know what's just around it right well hopefully like

[50:00] hopefully it comes out soon i mean i mean we we were talking a little bit about this on an

[50:05] an episode a like a week ago but you know i was just going to run down of all the machines that

[50:12] should be out by now and i think p3 has done the the tour of the country five times over

[50:19] and it's at the point now where we're we're gerry uh just needs to start shipping them i mean if it's

[50:25] you know i think enough people have seen the technology now it's time to just see if there's

[50:30] actual demand for it so hopefully we see that in the next like six months um so star wars are you

[50:36] big star wars fan like that's a rumor stern title that's supposed to be somewhere down the line

[50:44] it makes sense um i watched the the good three movies once or twice uh then uh not to get ones once

[50:52] i won't watch the new ones um yeah but it the demographic is perfect they're gonna sell

[50:59] a lot of the le the premiums you can sell like hotcakes when i talk about star wars to um just

[51:05] you know casual pinball players or collectors they get googoo and gargoyle about it so it's it's

[51:12] money in the bank and it's gonna sell uh i don't even think has to be good like it like it could

[51:19] just be like my thing is it how it should have toys in it you know like if you have a game like

[51:25] wwe which frankly uh that fan base can afford a beer and maybe order paper review a year so that

[51:32] they that's not a good demographic uh for pinball but if they were gonna do it to me wwe right it

[51:39] would have had toys in it like transformers did or champion pub like something like that something

[51:44] very you know george goma stuff um but like star wars at ease has that element you know it has the

[51:52] the toys in it that there some stuff to look at um it really should have a lot of flow like

[51:58] steve richie flow to me um why think richies doing it is that the rumor that richies doing it and

[52:05] i've heard everything here there but to me like if you're gonna if you're gonna have star wars you

[52:11] have to have a video screen you can't do dots again three games with with well that's that's right

[52:18] thoughts that's confirmed that's confirmed already um jody um they're ahead of marketing already

[52:25] said the next game is LCD moving forward so what what to me what it needs and if doesn't have this

[52:31] i'll just be forever disappointed in life it needs to have like kyle rin grabbing the ball like

[52:37] like he's forced grabbing it and and and like moving it because it's if they don't use magnets heavily

[52:44] in a star wars game then i think it's gonna be a miss like i don't want to see it just like a

[52:50] game of throwing kind of flowy game i also want to have some uh i need to see the ball doing some

[52:55] magical Jedi shit or else i think they've sort of missed an opportunity at j pop is pretty good at

[53:03] kind of doing them like the magic type field of shots and games um you know miss multiple is a

[53:10] very great gimmick but it doesn't really like transit is like well that's missed no it's it's a

[53:16] ball going across the the play field and it looks cool but doesn't really convey the you know miss

[53:21] no one says like oh that's missed it's just a ball going across it looks cool but if yeah they

[53:26] did stuff like that like the force like it grabs the ball and then you have to knock that ball out

[53:31] to like continue the mode or something like it has to have something like that or it's you know

[53:36] yeah i mean it has to have something solid totally totally well Cody like any any advice you have

[53:45] the people that are sort of looking at their maybe their home collection and realizing shit why

[53:51] do i have 20 pins just sitting here that i never turn on maybe i should put some on location if

[53:56] anyone's thinking of becoming like an operator and testing the waters what are some tips or advice

[54:02] you can give those people no number one is like everything starts with thought thought create so

[54:08] you have to visualize this like i visualize this in my head before i even bought one game um if you

[54:13] don't visualize having a game out don't then you're not going to do it but if you if you visualize like

[54:18] oh i could put a game in this shop or you like you visualize like hey this bar could use a pinball

[54:23] cheater my friend store um that's that's the first step and then and then also um i thought the

[54:32] operators too about this and um about like the negotiation strategy you go in you say hey uh if

[54:39] you've ever had pinball in here and they say um yes or no whatever they say they say nah and then

[54:45] they say um would you like one and see everybody's life is ruled by two words

[54:52] interest level interest level goes from zero to 100 it's a quantifiable thing so if you go into a

[54:58] place and they say they say hey uh you want to pinball machine there you go what walk or they say

[55:04] i don't know walk maybe walk they say hell yeah now you can negotiate and i'm new to operate

[55:11] as it put games out like operator operators you know and they're like well i put these games in here

[55:16] and i said well how did negotiation go well they said they didn't mind i'm like then that you're

[55:21] doomed but if you if you can find a place it's hot and they'll give you the best cut possible um

[55:28] you know i mean parts break but to me that's like you know when you when you if a part if a part breaks

[55:35] and you put a new part in it it's you're you're still getting value back in a game so i'd say

[55:41] you know just do it if it's a place you like it's a place you frequent already you know and you

[55:46] you already have rapport with it i mean i put games in places i don't get a bars i don't even drink

[55:50] but i put them in like hipster bars die bars and i go in there and um you know but they welcome it

[55:58] that's the expiter and just um i mean heck i'm i'll place games for other friends you know why not

[56:06] like you know now i got to ask a question um for our good friend wise snow over on pinside

[56:12] our dollar bill acceptors like a requirement for location based games depends if there's a change

[56:20] machine like right next to it um not writ not so much but if there isn't you should whenever possible

[56:29] um if i don't have it if i do not have a change machine in a location because that's the locations

[56:36] duty if they care they're gonna have a change machine if they don't they're not

[56:40] right now locations that don't put a change machine there um it is a big it is an expactor

[56:46] like i have to have a bill except they're possible and that's the problem is some of these games

[56:50] when most of my games like the if there's a change machine um you know there is a change

[56:57] but if i have a game out and i can't put a bill except on it and there isn't a change machine

[57:01] that's a quandary right there right like uh i shouldn't have done that like i you shouldn't do that

[57:08] right well kody um this has been a great chat and i hope you can come on the show again

[57:15] sometime soon i know that the listeners always enjoy interviews uh it gets me off of the soap box

[57:23] and i always try to keep the episodes within in hour so we're around like 56 minutes minus

[57:30] well in addition to my little intro i'll do but i want to thank you for coming on any last

[57:36] comments you want to make before we do this again sometime in the near future

[57:41] to be continued um yeah yeah just have fun play some pinball uh my philosophy uh the

[57:49] psychology pinball one-on-one is um pinball puts you in the now it puts you in now status where you're

[57:56] not uh think about your work or bills or you're not you know looking at your phone you know it puts

[58:04] you in a now uh now status if it doesn't you you're not doing it right but um you know put

[58:10] you in the now so just to keep playing pinball um putting you in the now and just uh and have fun

[58:17] if you're having fun getting another hobby right i think it's some great advice and actually

[58:21] know that now that i think about it i do my my my my mind never wonders when i play pinball it's always

[58:27] on what's going on on the play field so i think that's uh it's it's a unique quality it's probably

[58:32] you know one of the hard to describe reasons why so many people do love the hobby and enjoy pinball

[58:38] as uh as an entertainment device so kody thank you so much for joining canators pinball podcast um

[58:46] you can send all the hate mail you get after joining canators pinball podcasts to my apartment in
