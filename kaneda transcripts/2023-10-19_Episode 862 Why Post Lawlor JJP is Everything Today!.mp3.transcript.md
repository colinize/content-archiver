[00:00] Rockin' man, burning out of things I've heard along.

[00:05] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:09] Ah, the moment is here. I've been waiting years for this.

[00:13] We are at the Postpat Lawler Error of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:17] Today is gonna be the day, everybody. This is it. This is the moment of truth.

[00:21] And I am so excited. I'm gonna talk all about why I think the Postpat Lawler Error of JJP is everything.

[00:29] Today we are going to see which direction this company is going to go in.

[00:34] We're gonna see not just Steve Richie's Elton John.

[00:37] And look, I'm turning a page on this thing. I think this thing is gonna blow people away.

[00:41] And then we know that moving forward, if Postpat Lawler Error Jersey Jack Pinball is back with loaded games,

[00:48] filled with toys where we can actually see the value, none of this barren toy story crap and barren Godfather crap

[00:55] where distributors are trying to tell us that shots are the new toys.

[00:59] No, today we're gonna see something that we haven't seen in a really long time over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:05] We're gonna see where toys are actually toys. We're gonna see some speed, some flow.

[01:10] We're gonna see what we haven't seen before in the history of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:15] And for you people out there saying that dialed in was a fast game with a lot of flow packed with toys.

[01:21] Take your dialed in's and shove them people because there is no way that dialed in has a lot of speed.

[01:28] I've played that game. It suffers from the old Jersey Jack sluggish flipper feel that all of those games had.

[01:35] It feels like you're playing the game underwater.

[01:37] Alright, so here's what we're gonna talk about on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:41] We're gonna talk about the Postpat Lawler Error and what today means for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:46] We're gonna talk about how these goblin fanatics, I've kicked the hornet's nest for all of you barrels of Tupperware fans out there.

[01:53] All of a sudden all these freaking labyrinth fans are coming at Canada.

[01:57] Oh my gosh, we're gonna talk a little bit about that and how I think this game is gonna do over the next few months.

[02:03] And then we're gonna talk about what is gonna be the biggest game at Pinball Expo.

[02:06] It's not gonna be any of these games we've been talking about.

[02:09] It's gonna be Ninja Eclipse by Turner Pinball.

[02:12] Quite possibly the most anticipated game in the history of Pinball.

[02:15] Alright, but before I do this, I gotta give an extra special, Raise the Roof.

[02:19] This person didn't just raise the roof, they smashed through it.

[02:23] And now they're not just part of the Omokase Club, they're part of the Omokase Club and the Raise the Roof Club.

[02:28] I wanna give a huge shout out to Leaderboard Arcade, who is now donating $50 a month to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[02:37] Leaderboard Arcade, thank you so much.

[02:40] And I need to do a special apology for one of my greatest fans of all time.

[02:45] He knows who he is. He's listening right now.

[02:48] He's been waiting forever for me to make a correction here.

[02:52] So Mr. Steve Jablonski, you are one of my greatest followers, one of my greatest subscribers,

[02:58] and you donate also $50 a month to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[03:03] Now here's what's funny.

[03:04] I read a few episodes ago that Steve wrote to me,

[03:07] Don't insult me with $30, I'm gonna pay $50.

[03:12] And I attributed that like snarky remark to Steve.

[03:15] And then I didn't realize it.

[03:17] That was Canada's own description of the $50 tier.

[03:21] Now I had done these descriptions like three, four years ago, so I did not even remember that.

[03:27] So Steve, I'm sorry that I put my sarcasm onto your name.

[03:32] You are a much more civilized gentleman than Canada.

[03:36] And that is why you are so successful and you're one of my top donators on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:41] Now the one thing we don't have, we don't have one of these tiers.

[03:44] We don't have one person doing $100 a month.

[03:48] And I have to say, get a little jelly.

[03:51] I know another show that's got a few people donating $100 a month, and they don't even do shows anymore.

[03:56] You barely get a show.

[03:58] Maybe you're gonna get a polo shirt, but here's the new offer from Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[04:02] If you go to $100 a month, you're gonna get one of those awesome Canada hoodies.

[04:06] And not just the simple one, the one with all of the Akira patches all over it.

[04:10] So we'll see who goes to $100 a month.

[04:12] We'll see who joins that club.

[04:14] Alright, let's talk about today.

[04:15] Let's talk about the post-Pat Lawler error of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:19] Now look, I know for a lot of you out there, you've been waiting to hear Canada's episode 500.

[04:24] You've been waiting to hear a lot of the stories that I heard from people who were part of the move from New Jersey to Chicago.

[04:31] Pat Lawler is the reason why the company moved.

[04:34] Pat Lawler took this company over from Jack Guinari.

[04:37] And for a lot of you out there, you don't want to believe it.

[04:40] For a lot of the people at the company now, they don't want to go back and revisit some of these stories.

[04:44] But that is what happened.

[04:46] Pat Lawler is the reason why Butch Peel is no longer at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:51] Pat Lawler is the reason why there were so many mess-ups over at Jersey Jack Pinball back in the day.

[04:57] Pat Lawler was the reason why there were so many delays.

[05:00] Do you know that Pat Lawler was supposed to make dialed in in a year?

[05:04] And it took him three years to finish the game.

[05:07] Three freaking years.

[05:09] And all of those delays are what hurt Jersey Jack Pinball.

[05:12] All of those delays are the reason why Jersey Jack Pinball ran out of money.

[05:17] Like they literally had hobbits on the line and they had to turn off production because they had no more money.

[05:23] And Pat Lawler is the reason why the Abbas family had to come in and save this company.

[05:28] Now look, it's still on Jack's shoulders.

[05:30] He picked Pat Lawler.

[05:32] There's a reason why other companies didn't want to work with Pat Lawler.

[05:35] Pat Lawler used to work with Stern Pinball.

[05:37] But this is not about Pat Lawler anymore because it's over.

[05:40] The man's retired. He's moved on.

[05:42] But I will say this. Pat Lawler was a lot of the reason why Jersey Jack was yanking stuff out of games.

[05:49] He's the reason why there's not the triple spinning disc in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:53] He didn't really want to help other designers at Jersey Jack Pinball learn the trade of Pinball.

[05:59] And he had his shot.

[06:00] And that's the thing, ladies and gentlemen.

[06:02] For these like legacy designers, they had their chance.

[06:05] They had their moment.

[06:07] They had the money.

[06:08] They had the resources.

[06:09] They had the opportunities to blow us away.

[06:12] And Pat Lawler had three opportunities to blow us away at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:16] And he failed on every single one.

[06:18] And so now we got Steve Ritchie.

[06:20] These guys are tight ends.

[06:22] These guys are like legends in the world of Pinball.

[06:24] And we didn't get it from Pat Lawler.

[06:26] This is why I am excited because I think we're going to get it from Steve Ritchie today.

[06:30] I really do.

[06:31] I think Steve Ritchie, I think he left Stern Pinball and he wasn't happy.

[06:35] I think he was unhappy with a lot of the decisions that were made over at Stern Pinball.

[06:39] And can you blame the guy?

[06:41] And I think he's learned a lesson because we know he has it.

[06:44] Like we know he has it when you stand over a game like ACDC.

[06:48] When you play a game like Star Trek, you know he's capable of making an amazing Pinball experience.

[06:53] And he's made amazing Pinball machines over the years.

[06:56] So you know he has it.

[06:57] And we also know that Stern was in a real cost-cutting place.

[07:01] And Steve's like a legacy designer.

[07:03] I don't think he was able to really understand how to work with a modern bomb the way Keith Elwin was.

[07:09] Because Godzilla was only $100 more in bomb than Led Zeppelin.

[07:13] But a lot of that Led Zeppelin bomb probably went to the license in the game.

[07:17] Now look, I'm still mad at Steve Ritchie for what he did with Star Wars.

[07:21] I don't think he designed Star Wars from the ground up.

[07:24] I think Star Wars looks like a reskin of something else he was working on.

[07:28] And still to this day, when I look at Star Wars, I don't see the creativity.

[07:31] I don't see the imagination.

[07:33] I don't see the film I love represented in a world under glass in that game.

[07:37] So I've been harder on Steve Ritchie than anybody else.

[07:40] I don't think he's earned the title of the king over the last few releases.

[07:43] But he left.

[07:44] And he left.

[07:45] And he's angry.

[07:46] And he's mad.

[07:47] And he wants to prove himself again.

[07:48] And he wants to come back and show everybody what he can do when he's unshackled, when he's unleashed.

[07:54] And if Jersey Jack Pinball is to be believed and they unleashed Steve Ritchie,

[07:59] then what we are about to see today should be something that is magnanimous, that is creative,

[08:05] that is over the top, that is like something we haven't seen in Pinball in a while.

[08:09] And it has to be more than just visual.

[08:11] Jersey Jack Pinball has dazzled us with visuals.

[08:14] Guns N' Roses was a dazzling pinball machine.

[08:18] We all fell victim to the video.

[08:20] And then when you played the game, it wasn't there.

[08:22] The game plays not there.

[08:24] You're chopping wood with all these multi-balls.

[08:26] And there's no way around it, right?

[08:28] It's like you've got this beautiful game.

[08:30] But after playing it for like 200 times, you kind of get tired of it

[08:34] because the pinball playing experience is not in Guns N' Roses.

[08:38] And you have to look no further.

[08:40] I just saw a Guns N' Roses CE4 sale today, new in box for $13,500.

[08:46] That's insanity people.

[08:48] That's cheaper than a new in box Godfather CE and a new in box Toy Story CE.

[08:52] And there's half as many Guns N' Roses machines in the world.

[08:56] Jersey Jack is at the lowest it's ever been.

[08:58] I mean this. This is the lowest the company has ever been.

[09:01] They have absolutely no mojo going into this release.

[09:05] And that is why so many people, it's more than just people being like,

[09:09] oh, we don't want Elton John.

[09:10] It's like you don't really want Jersey Jack Pinball anymore.

[09:13] And Jersey Jack Pinball hasn't done anything to make you want them.

[09:16] Jersey Jack Pinball hasn't been hyping their products properly.

[09:19] They haven't been speaking to the community.

[09:21] They've been doing absolutely nothing.

[09:23] They've released two games in a row that are absolutely underwhelming.

[09:27] And you could see the vibe of them at the shows.

[09:29] You could read it in the body language.

[09:31] Like I'd be at a show and I'd see the Jersey Jack employees

[09:34] and they've got their arms folded and they're in the corner

[09:37] and they don't really feel excited about the product they're putting in front of you.

[09:41] You could see it in the promotional videos they made for Toy Story and for Godfather.

[09:45] You could see it in all their eyes.

[09:47] Like Eric Minier is not a fan of the Godfather.

[09:49] He made a game that he had to make, not a game that he wanted to make.

[09:53] And that's a very big question about Elton John today.

[09:56] Is this a game that Steve Ritchie wanted to make?

[09:59] Or is it a game that he had to make when he came over to Jersey Jack Pinball?

[10:04] All of these questions are going to be answered today.

[10:07] But I think what we're going to see is this.

[10:09] I think we're going to see a game that is packed with toys.

[10:12] And I think we're going to see the most visually stunning, spectacular,

[10:15] light show game of all time.

[10:17] But I also think we're going to see the best shooting Jersey Jack machine ever.

[10:22] I think we're going to see a game with speed.

[10:24] I think we're going to see a game with flow.

[10:26] I think we're going to see a game with mechanisms that are really cool and connected to the theme.

[10:30] And I think this thing just from a distance, and you can see it in the trailer video.

[10:34] It is going to pop like nothing else.

[10:37] It is going to be like New Year's Eve sitting in a box, sitting in your living room.

[10:41] And I think it's going to make other pinball machines.

[10:44] It's so funny that this thing is coming out the same time as the labyrinth, which is all brown.

[10:49] And it's kind of boring looking visually.

[10:51] And it doesn't sparkle.

[10:53] Like you're literally putting a disco ball next to a brown brick.

[10:57] That is what it's going to look like when you put Elton John next to labyrinth.

[11:01] And look, a pinball machine is supposed to be something that just visually grabs you in.

[11:06] And then you're supposed to go up to it and know what to do in the game.

[11:09] And there's supposed to be a world under glass that makes you want to shoot and see what happens as the ball interacts with all the fun toys underneath the glass.

[11:17] And then you're going to get great sound, great music, great lights.

[11:21] Is this going to be the game that gives us everything we've wanted in a Jersey Jack pinball machine?

[11:25] Now, here's the thing, and I'm hearing a lot of you screaming at like,

[11:28] Canada, what are you talking about?

[11:30] Because nobody wants the Elton John theme.

[11:33] Look, and I understand that point.

[11:35] Like this is not a dream theme for most of you.

[11:37] It's not.

[11:38] I don't want to say this.

[11:39] This music is not music to sleep on.

[11:42] This is a man that sold over 300 million albums globally.

[11:46] This is a man who could sell out an 80,000 person stadium.

[11:50] This guy could have a residency and sell out an 80,000 person stadium day after day after day.

[11:56] I mean, Billy Joel does it in New York.

[11:58] Elton John is bigger than Billy Joel.

[12:01] He's bigger than Foo Fighters, Aerosmith, and Guns N' Roses combined.

[12:05] I mean, it's Elton Freakin' John, people.

[12:08] It's Elton Freakin' John, and from what I'm seeing in this teaser trailer video,

[12:12] I think it's going to be Christopher Franci artwork as well, which could be freakin' awesome.

[12:16] Finally, he's going to get back on a hit game, I think.

[12:19] So I'm just saying today is the day.

[12:21] And if you want to watch my reaction as we see the video drop at noon Eastern Standard Time,

[12:27] join me on Facebook, and I'm just super excited.

[12:30] Look, this is it.

[12:31] This is it.

[12:32] This game's terrible, and they fumbled this, and it doesn't blow us away.

[12:36] I will be the first person to call it out,

[12:39] but I'll also be the first person to congratulate them on proving me and many of us wrong.

[12:45] So I want to implore each and every one of us,

[12:47] let's keep an open mind as we go into today, because now is the day, right?

[12:50] All the speculation ends today.

[12:53] Now, look, I don't think the game is going to be on the line, so ordering one right away,

[12:58] I encourage each and every one of you, you're going to see a beautiful, sexy, two-minute video.

[13:03] That's all you're going to get until later tonight.

[13:05] And it's going to be so beautiful that you're going to want to order it right away,

[13:08] but I would wait to see when these games are on the line,

[13:11] because I'm a little bit worried here that order banks are opening before the panel discussion.

[13:18] And if order banks are opening, I think every single distributor needs to be honest with everybody

[13:23] and let us know when is the game on the line.

[13:26] And if the game's not on the line now and they don't know when the game's going to be on the line,

[13:30] I tell you what they're going to say, oh, Q1 production, that's what you're going to hear today.

[13:33] I guarantee you, they're going to be like, send your deposit in today and Q1 production

[13:38] and just be worried people, because that could be like four to five months before you see your Elton John.

[13:43] Oh, can you tell I'm excited? I love New Pimball Day. I love New Pimball Day.

[13:47] I do want to give my condolences. I've had some friends who are at Pimball Expo right now

[13:51] and they're like, man, the show's pretty small. It is very small.

[13:54] And I think a lot of newbies that are traveling there for the first time

[13:58] who are going to Chicago Pimball Expo for four days.

[14:02] Some of them are going for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

[14:05] They're going for four full days. And I think some people might even stay over for the Pimball Olympics.

[14:10] Maybe that's five days. I'm just here to tell you right now, it's a lot.

[14:15] It's a lot of days for not a lot of square footage to cover.

[14:19] You see the entire show in like an hour. And then it's a lot of catching up with people.

[14:24] You know, did you see the photos last night? I was laughing so hard.

[14:27] There were photos of people starting to gather at that arcade where the media mixer is.

[14:31] And look at the photos. It's on NAPS Arcade.

[14:34] Look how miserable everybody looks.

[14:37] It was also interesting to see all of those galactic tank forces lined up at that arcade.

[14:43] I heard a little rumor, right? We saw the new American Pimball facility.

[14:47] We know they've got maybe He-Man, right? They've been teasing He-Man and 300 as possible titles.

[14:54] And I think with American Pimball, they're not in a position to be making cheeky jokes about what their next title might be.

[15:00] Because their current title is a total failure.

[15:03] The company's been pretty much a failure since its inception.

[15:06] And I don't think this company can get cute with anybody.

[15:09] Because I don't think they have a fan base or a community that's really following them with much excitement.

[15:15] Now I'm hearing that the person who's least excited about American Pimball is Mukesh.

[15:20] And here's a rumor I heard that he's given David Ficks until January 1st to sell all of these galactic tank forces or else.

[15:28] I don't know what the or else means, but it's not a good thing I hear.

[15:32] And now it makes total sense, like the desperation to line up all these galactic tank forces.

[15:38] The bottom line is this. David Ficks made a bet with Dennis Nordman.

[15:43] Dennis Nordman screwed over American Pimball.

[15:46] He brought them a game that had no commercial appeal.

[15:49] And it's not me saying this, the market is saying this.

[15:52] And I think we need to stop being like, oh, because we like him and he's a nice guy, it doesn't matter.

[15:57] If you want your company to survive, if American Pimball needed to survive by choosing the right theme that people wanted,

[16:04] and they went with Dennis Nordman's game, Dennis Nordman would have bankrupted American Pimball.

[16:10] If it wasn't for Mukesh bailing out another failure over at American Pimball, the company would be done.

[16:16] And I'm sorry, but there needs to be more accountability and responsibility on behalf of these designers who bring themes to these companies.

[16:25] Like when Joe Balser, he could have made any game he wanted to for American Pimball, and he decided to make Oktoberfest.

[16:33] And him and Josh Cougler got that artist to make the art package on the game that was absolutely horrendous.

[16:39] And when you don't have any accountability for the decisions you make like that, and then sales aren't there, who takes responsibility?

[16:46] Well, they let Joe Balser go, and that's the right move.

[16:49] In my business and any business, if it's all on you, if you're going to make the call that's going to make or break a company's ability to make money,

[16:56] and they need to make money to survive, if you get it wrong, you gotta go.

[17:00] Alright, so look, I want to make a little bit of an announcement to all of you labyrinth fans.

[17:05] I know you guys are busy getting your tattoos of barrels of pencils on your body.

[17:09] I know you're all in love with barrels of lollipops.

[17:12] I know they brought 10 games to Pimball Expo, and that's good.

[17:15] I'm glad they're showing up with games in boxes.

[17:18] Jersey Jack Pimball is not even going to accomplish that with Elton John.

[17:22] And I just want to say this, if you saw the movie and you like it, I'm happy they made a game for you.

[17:27] It's not the theme for me.

[17:28] Look, this movie is niche.

[17:30] It's a very, very niche movie.

[17:32] It made $12 million at the US box office.

[17:36] You know what movie it beat?

[17:38] A little movie that I think would be a much better Pimball experience called Big Trouble in Little China.

[17:44] Big Trouble in Little China is another cult classic.

[17:47] It made $11 million at the US box office.

[17:51] But are you telling me that the 40 to 60 year old Pimball buying demographic would be more into labyrinth

[17:59] as they are older men than Big Trouble in Little China?

[18:03] I don't want to get into this debate, right?

[18:05] Because it's like debating people's childhoods and their nostalgia.

[18:08] And nobody's right. Nobody's wrong. It's all nostalgia.

[18:12] I will say this.

[18:13] There's another movie that I think is a much better game to make than Freakin' Labyrinth.

[18:18] And it made $50 million at the US box office.

[18:22] And it is probably even easier to get the IP and the license for this movie than Labyrinth.

[18:28] You know what that movie is called?

[18:30] You know what movie Pimball Machine I would buy instantly if they made it?

[18:33] A little movie starring a little guy called Jean-Claude von Damme.

[18:37] The Muscles from Brussels. Bloodsport.

[18:40] $50 million.

[18:42] Way bigger at the box office than Labyrinth.

[18:45] And way more of a movie that men who buy Pimball Machines would be into.

[18:49] Look, in the end, I think $1100 at $10,600.

[18:53] You got to add the topper in because who's not going to get the topper?

[18:56] We're basically at almost $12,000 for this game.

[19:00] I think it's going to be easy to get one.

[19:03] I don't think there's 1100 people out there.

[19:06] And look, I think the hype on Labyrinth is going to die down big time when we see Elton John today.

[19:11] And here's why.

[19:12] Because I think you're going to see what Jersey Jack will give you for $12,000 next to what this company will give you for $12,000.

[19:22] And one is still going to look like a glorified, sort of nicer polished version of a spooky homebrew machine.

[19:29] And one is just going to be on such a different level.

[19:33] And you're going to look at both of them and say, wait a minute, how can these two machines be so close in price?

[19:38] And it's going to be crystal clear which one gives you a lot more value.

[19:43] All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

[19:45] That's me just pleading with all you goblin lovers.

[19:48] Just leave me alone.

[19:49] I get it.

[19:50] I lived a little bit of a different life than you.

[19:53] I didn't love pinball when I was a kid.

[19:55] I love Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat, Sega Genesis.

[19:59] I love Mario Kart 64.

[20:01] I wasn't running to the arcade to play pinball machines.

[20:05] I became a pinball fan later in life.

[20:07] But let's be honest, the cool kids were not on pinball.

[20:11] They were learning how to use guile to beat Dacim in Street Fighter II.

[20:15] I mean, that's just the reality, everybody.

[20:17] All right, canada stop before you lose your entire audience by making fun of pinball.

[20:21] Let's talk about Turner pinball, the mystery secret, the big thing that's going to happen at pinball expo.

[20:27] Is this fool going to bring back the pinbar from Raza?

[20:32] Why did this guy buy all of the assets from Deep Root Pinball?

[20:36] This is going to be the biggest joke of the show.

[20:38] Look, whether or not we like Labyrinth or Elton John, we're all going to agree what a joke Turner pinball will be

[20:45] when they show what that is underneath that like secret photo to come underneath this box is something of a mystery.

[20:51] It's not going to be a mystery.

[20:53] I bet they bring back the pinbar and I bet everybody's going to laugh their butts off because we don't want any of this stuff.

[20:59] Take every single idea from Deep Root Pinball and put it in a dumpster and light it on fire.

[21:05] Why would anybody associate it with Deep Root Pinball think they have a future in pinball?

[21:11] It's never happening ever, ladies and gentlemen.

[21:14] Are you ready for Elton John?

[21:16] Are you ready for some I'm still standing?

[21:19] Are you ready for Goodbye Yellow Brick Road or is Jersey Jack going to flop and be a candle in the wind after this release today?

[21:26] I don't know, but we're going to watch it together.

[21:28] Join Canada on Facebook Live at 11.45 a.m.

[21:32] I will be live.

[21:34] I think that's 15 minutes before their video is supposed to drop and we can watch it together.

[21:39] We could either be cheering and celebrating or we can be consoling each other.

[21:44] Everybody have a great day.

[21:46] It's going to be an exciting day in pinball.

[21:48] It's so rare that we get a new game from Jersey Jack Pinball and it's been almost three years since Jersey Jack Pinball has even excited us.

[21:56] So please get excited.

[21:58] Steve Ritchie, it's your turn, man.

[22:00] It's your turn to wow us.

[22:01] Do you got it?

[22:02] Is the king back?

[22:03] We shall see.

[22:09] I got a taste of love in a simple way and if you need to know why I'm still standing, you just fit away.

[22:16] Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?

[22:22] Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.

[22:28] I'm still standing after all this time, making up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.

[22:38] I'm still standing.

[22:40] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[22:43] I'm still standing.

[22:45] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
