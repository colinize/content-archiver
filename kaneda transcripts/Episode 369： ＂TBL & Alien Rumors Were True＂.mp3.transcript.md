[00:00] You're everyone's problem.

[00:02] That's because every time you go up in the air you're unsafe.

[00:05] I don't like you because you're dangerous.

[00:07] That's right.

[00:08] Nice.

[00:09] Man.

[00:11] I am dangerous.

[00:13] Remember boys.

[00:15] No points for a second point.

[00:17] There are no points for second place.

[00:19] And that's why the world's number one pinball podcast

[00:22] tried to tell you months ago this was gonna happen.

[00:26] Because when you put ice man and canada in the same cockpit

[00:32] you best believe the rumors are going to be true.

[00:36] And this one, this bomb was all ice man.

[00:41] And I should have believed him.

[00:43] I should not have taken down the podcast.

[00:45] But there was so much pressure.

[00:47] There were so many doubters out there that didn't think

[00:51] the rumor that the air a games of the big Lebowski

[00:56] would make their way back and be shipped to new buyers of the big Lebowski.

[01:02] And now we have it confirmed.

[01:05] And I'm here to tell you on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast

[01:10] which I don't even have to do.

[01:12] I am simply going to air the old podcast that I put up that I took down

[01:18] in all of its glory because everything I said in that podcast

[01:23] will happen.

[01:25] The only thing that won't happen is I won't be getting

[01:28] a tattoo of Hilton on my butt because everything that we said

[01:33] would occur will occur.

[01:35] Now maybe our dates were a little off.

[01:38] But who cares about that right?

[01:40] It's still gonna happen.

[01:42] And so what does that mean?

[01:44] You get to hear that podcast and it's in its glory.

[01:48] Now I must warn you, it's explicit.

[01:50] There are a lot of curses.

[01:51] So if you have children who enjoy Canada's pinball podcast,

[01:54] you best not let them listen to it.

[01:58] But here's the deal.

[02:00] Not only is the big Lebowski coming back.

[02:03] And there are 38 games, maybe 40, going from air a to coin taker

[02:08] to be sold to new buyers for $12,500.

[02:13] I'm doing stuck on this $12,500 price.

[02:17] They could have charged $15,000 for all 40 of those games

[02:21] and they would have got it.

[02:23] And we saw all the news today.

[02:25] Barry and Yop.

[02:27] Yop is not doing well.

[02:28] We wish him well.

[02:30] But Barry's taken over the reins and he's going to figure it all out

[02:35] apparently.

[02:36] Now here's what I'm about to tell you.

[02:38] And look, you could dismiss this.

[02:40] Wouldn't you rather hear this new exciting stuff

[02:43] versus you know, constantly talking about how Joe Katz has removed

[02:46] all the assets you want from Willy Wonka?

[02:50] You know, look, I could do another Wonka podcast.

[02:53] I could tell you how silly it is that the final wizard mode

[02:57] in Willy Wonka is pure imagination.

[03:00] Why is that the final wizard mode?

[03:02] Isn't the final scene in the game when you crash through the ceiling

[03:06] in the walkivator?

[03:08] Why isn't the walkivator the final mode?

[03:11] Pure imagination happens at the beginning of the movie.

[03:14] That's like having, playing Lord the Rings

[03:17] and having destroy the ring happen early on in the games code

[03:20] makes absolutely no sense, but no.

[03:22] I'm not going to go off from that tangent on how they put your game.

[03:26] Here's the other thing that's going to happen.

[03:29] Alien Pimbal is also coming back.

[03:32] So for all of you out there trying to sell your aliens,

[03:35] I wouldn't try to get 15 or 20,000

[03:38] because you know what's about to happen?

[03:41] A sleeping giant is building momentum in Europe.

[03:45] And you know them as the Pimbal Brothers.

[03:49] These men have a lot of money and a lot of resources

[03:53] and they are not dead.

[03:55] And what you're about to see happen is going to blow a lot of you away.

[04:01] It is going to throw more games into the mix.

[04:04] More games into the fire.

[04:07] And so good luck to all the Pimbal companies out there fighting for market share.

[04:13] It's not just deep root, it's not just stern, it's not just JJP,

[04:17] it's not just Chicago, it's not just spooky.

[04:20] Pimbal Brothers are coming.

[04:22] Enjoy this podcast and never doubt Canada and Iceman again.

[04:26] Kanita, you've always been a pain in the ass, you know.

[04:31] You've been telling me what to do since we were kids.

[04:33] You always treat me like a kid.

[04:36] You always show up and start bossing me around.

[04:39] And don't you deny it.

[04:41] And now you're a boss too.

[04:43] Of this pile of rubble.

[04:45] Kanita!

[04:46] That's Mr. Kanita, do you?

[04:48] I'm not in the tank!

[04:50] Are you not in the tank?

[04:54] Is this not what you're here?

[04:57] The streamers, streamers, how many...

[04:59] Okay, you stream.

[05:00] Who's the best streamer?

[05:01] Who's got the most?

[05:02] I guess that's the best.

[05:03] Yeah, but that is.

[05:05] And I guess that's already like, that's a popular already contest that's already happened.

[05:09] Because if you have got the most viewers, you're the most popular.

[05:13] That's what I'm talking about.

[05:16] It's making the whole thing.

[05:20] It's making the whole thing.

[05:23] It's just...

[05:26] It's not fair, Kanita.

[05:45] Go away, Kanita.

[05:46] Stop spreading those pinball rumors, Kanita.

[05:49] Here what all you are saying.

[05:50] And that's why you're tuning in to Kanita's pinball podcast.

[05:53] Because I'm not going to stop with just one major bit of news.

[05:57] I'm about to drop.

[05:59] Probably the biggest fucking bombshell of the year on this episode of Kanita's pinball podcast.

[06:04] Are you ready for it?

[06:05] Are you sitting down?

[06:06] Drum roll.

[06:07] Here's the bombshell.

[06:08] Neil McCrae is going to come on for three fucking hours.

[06:11] Yeah, that's what's going to happen.

[06:12] Okay, Neil, take it away.

[06:13] No, I'm fucking kidding.

[06:14] Look, here you are listening to Kanita's pinball podcast.

[06:18] And they hear you people out there.

[06:19] Kanita's lying.

[06:20] Kanita's making up rumors.

[06:21] Kanita's spreading false stuff.

[06:22] It's fake news.

[06:23] Jonathan, Justin, whatever, whatever, whatever his name is.

[06:26] Talk to Barry and Barry said the big Lebowski rumor is false.

[06:29] Let me tell you something.

[06:30] Let me tell you something.

[06:31] You're going to believe Barry?

[06:33] You're going to believe Barry?

[06:34] You're going to contact ARA?

[06:35] Look, I heard from a very, very reliable source.

[06:38] This thing is happening.

[06:39] It is happening.

[06:40] And look, look, why do you think all the big Lebowski's are going up for sale?

[06:44] Why do you think all of these people woke up this week and said,

[06:48] you know what?

[06:49] Today's the day that I'm going to let go of this big Lebowski.

[06:52] I've been holding on to for two years and I'm going to list it for $25,000.

[06:56] So all of these games going up for sale is just serendivitous.

[06:59] It's just coincidence.

[07:01] It's not related to anything happening with the big Lebowski production.

[07:04] Look, just wait and see.

[07:06] Just wait and see.

[07:08] I might be right.

[07:09] I might be wrong.

[07:10] But I'm hearing from a very, very reliable source that the big Lebowski pinball is coming back out.

[07:16] Now, here's the deal.

[07:17] I don't know all the details.

[07:19] I don't know whose manufacturing it.

[07:21] Is it ARA?

[07:22] Is it Zentech over in China?

[07:24] Look, all I know is that this game is supposedly coming back out.

[07:28] And you can take it for what it's worth.

[07:30] Now, here's the other thing.

[07:31] Nobody's stopping from burying Yacht, from giving you a statement,

[07:34] from coming out of hiding and telling you the realities of the situation.

[07:39] And maybe they don't have all the details figured out.

[07:42] But here is why I exist for you, the pinball listener,

[07:46] because there is a little circle of people that know a lot about what's going on behind the scenes at pinball, in pinball.

[07:53] And they keep that information from you.

[07:55] Now, let me ask you a question.

[07:57] How fucking pissed off would you be if you spent $25,000 or $20,000 or $18,000 on a big Lebowski this week,

[08:07] only to find out in a few weeks that the games are going to be a lot easier to get for a lot less money.

[08:14] So I am trying to help out the people from not getting fucked over on those sort of deals.

[08:18] And you can ask those guys why they think those games are worth that much

[08:21] and why they're selling them all of a sudden, like they don't know.

[08:24] Like they didn't catch wind.

[08:25] It's such bullshit in this hobby.

[08:28] There is an inner circle of people that know so much information that allows them to make decisions

[08:36] based on the info that they know and they won't share it.

[08:39] They won't go put it on the forums.

[08:41] And you know what you're going to hear it?

[08:42] You're going to hear it on Canada's pinball fucking podcast.

[08:45] So Marty, do your research.

[08:47] Remember how to pronounce the name?

[08:49] CUTNADA is the one who gave you the bombshell you're about to hear on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast.

[08:56] Now, look, maybe we should call this like the five days of Canada.

[08:59] Like I'm dropping all these fucking bombshells the week leading up to T.P.F.

[09:03] Like this was supposed to be the week of deep route.

[09:06] It's looking like it's more the week of Canada's rumor mail.

[09:09] But this one today, I'm telling you, this one's even bigger.

[09:12] And this one, I am so confident in that I will do, I will promise you this.

[09:19] If this doesn't come true, I will shut down my pinball podcast.

[09:23] How about that for a guarantee?

[09:25] So if this doesn't happen, there will be no more Canada's pinball podcast.

[09:29] That's how confident I am in the information I have about this.

[09:33] Now, where did I get this information?

[09:35] Well, some of the people that own the game, one guy owns two of them,

[09:39] and other people who own the game and other distributors that are out there,

[09:42] there's a whole bunch of people that are talking.

[09:44] I actually got three to four emails after I put up my big Lebowski news saying,

[09:49] hey, did you hear about this?

[09:51] And here's what's fucked up.

[09:53] Here's what's fucked up.

[09:54] Is these people obviously know something that's really important and people,

[09:58] and could help people out?

[10:00] They could help people out not lose money.

[10:03] Because something major is about to happen in the pinball hobby.

[10:06] And a lot of people have been spending a lot of money on stuff that they could have saved

[10:11] if only they knew this information.

[10:13] And I think it's totally fucked up that members of this community know this stuff

[10:19] and just watch people from the sidelines run in and fucking get ripped off.

[10:25] Now look, I'm not like rarer here, I'm not gonna say fuck all you rich guys,

[10:29] but he has a point.

[10:31] He has a point.

[10:32] If anyone's gonna rush in and buy a big Lebowski for $25,000,

[10:36] when you know that there are at least 40 to whatever game sitting at ARA,

[10:41] you're kind of stupid.

[10:43] They're out there.

[10:44] It isn't like this is all that's ever gonna be made.

[10:47] There is a very good possibility that this game was gonna be remade.

[10:51] And so who do you believe?

[10:52] Do you believe Barry, who's denying it?

[10:54] Do you believe Canada, who's saying it's gonna happen?

[10:57] Do you believe ARA, if you reach out to them?

[10:59] I don't know.

[11:00] Here's the thing.

[11:01] Time will tell on that one.

[11:02] But I feel really, really good.

[11:03] I feel really, really good about the odds of big Lebowski coming back.

[11:07] But that is not the bombshell.

[11:09] I've got two more bombshells to drop this week.

[11:12] And this one is the big one though.

[11:13] This is the one.

[11:14] This is the one where they should throw fucking rose petals at my feet when I walk in the T-P-F

[11:19] because you heard it here first.

[11:20] You heard it here first.

[11:21] You didn't hear it anywhere else.

[11:23] I don't really care if this pisses off the company.

[11:26] I don't care if it spoils their plans because again, people are losing money

[11:31] because they don't know this info.

[11:33] And I think you should know the info.

[11:35] Are you ready for it?

[11:36] Are you ready for it?

[11:37] Canada's the five days of Canada day number two.

[11:40] Day number two.

[11:41] This is fucking, I can't believe I'm saying this.

[11:44] I really can't believe that I'm about to say the words that are coming out of my mouth.

[11:49] I can't believe that I'm about to resurrect something that I just never thought would be resurrected.

[11:56] So are you ready for it?

[11:57] Are you ready for it?

[11:58] Are you ready for it?

[11:59] Should we get Hilton in here?

[12:00] Hilton.

[12:01] Hey boy, hey boy, go grab your drum.

[12:02] Get the drum roll going.

[12:03] And let's play your little drum beat as we announce what the next bombshell game is going to be in the pinball world.

[12:11] Hilton, you're here.

[12:12] Okay, but he parked the Subaru man.

[12:13] It doesn't matter if people hit it.

[12:15] The thing's a piece of shit.

[12:16] Okay, here.

[12:17] He's going to start his drums.

[12:18] Hold on everyone.

[12:19] Here we go.

[12:20] Hilton, hit it.

[12:21] I really don't appreciate it when you make fun of me soon.

[12:25] I'm working as hard as I can and people at work have stopped paying attention to me.

[12:29] But since I'm off inside, I don't have really much to do anymore.

[12:33] Alright, Kilton, I don't care, man.

[12:35] Are you guys ready?

[12:36] Are you guys ready for the biggest fucking bombshell?

[12:38] I can't believe it.

[12:39] I'm about to say this.

[12:40] I really can't believe I'm about to utter the words that are coming out of my mouth.

[12:45] But you are about to experience the return of a game that we thought was dead and gone forever.

[12:51] I know I'm not talking about big libouski.

[12:54] Coming back to you into the pinball world and this one's coming real soon.

[12:58] You're going to be able to buy brand new the following game.

[13:15] Hey Ripley, don't worry.

[13:24] Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you.

[13:38] Check it out.

[13:40] Independent like targeting particle beam failings.

[13:43] Wow.

[13:44] Right after city is this property.

[13:48] We got tactical smart missiles.

[13:50] Base plasma pulse rifle.

[13:52] RPGs.

[13:53] We got sonic electronic.

[13:55] Pull break.

[13:56] Oh, shit.

[13:57] Area football is coming back.

[14:01] It's confirmed 100%.

[14:06] Are you ready to get the return of highway pinballs, alien machine?

[14:12] This is the craziest fucking news story I have ever covered on this show.

[14:18] You know me.

[14:19] You know how close I was to the highway debacle, the alien debacle.

[14:25] It is the thing that I called spot on.

[14:28] But what I did not anticipate is what is about to happen.

[14:33] And it's going to blow all of you away.

[14:36] Now this is 100% confirmed and happening.

[14:42] It is done.

[14:43] The deal is done.

[14:45] You are going to be able to buy the alien pinball machine that you have always wanted.

[14:53] And it is the same game that was designed by highway pinball.

[14:56] But there is a huge fucking bombshell deal that I'm about to reveal to you on Canadian pinball podcast.

[15:03] So here is what is happening.

[15:05] Remember the gentleman who bought highway pinball out from underneath Andrew highway.

[15:10] Remember what happened.

[15:12] They were making, you know, they were going to try to remake the game and they ran on to hard times.

[15:17] And they basically cut their losses and said it's over.

[15:20] And they went away for a long time.

[15:22] Now remember we haven't heard from these gentlemen in a very long time.

[15:26] And we haven't even speculated what happened to the so called pinball brothers.

[15:31] Isn't that what they became the pinball bros?

[15:34] Well here is what they've been doing behind the scenes.

[15:37] And here is what is about to fucking happen.

[15:40] I'm so excited to say this because it actually, it makes total sense now.

[15:45] And two mysteries will be solved with one major news announcement from Canadian pinball podcast.

[15:52] Are you fucking ready for the best part about this whole thing?

[15:55] The thing that would make you feel good about going in on a highway pinball alien?

[16:00] The thing that like would, would ultimately, ultimately like erase all the fear of fears?

[16:05] What's the one thing that you really want to make sure with this whole announcement?

[16:09] That someone who knows how to make the fucking game will make the fucking game.

[16:14] And here is the news.

[16:16] Chicago gaming company is making this game.

[16:21] This is the original game from Chicago gaming company that is a license theme.

[16:28] So the pinball brothers have contracted Chicago gaming company to make alien pinball.

[16:35] Let that sit in for a minute.

[16:37] Let's do a Christopher Frenchie moment of holy fuck silence on that.

[16:41] Holy fuck, I cannot believe that Chicago gaming company is going to manufacture alien pinball.

[16:48] And here is the best fucking part about the whole fucking thing.

[16:52] It is not going to come out in a shitty highway pinball cabinet.

[16:57] This game is going to be a wide body.

[17:00] It's going to retain the same game.

[17:02] But it is going to be in a standard Valley Williams, it's not standard, a Valley Williams wide body cabinet.

[17:08] So it will have a normal pinball cabinet.

[17:10] And they're going to remake the game using Valley Williams parts.

[17:15] And they're going to fix a lot of the shitty stuff that was in the highway game.

[17:20] It is now going to be in a traditional pinball cabinet, which is fucking incredible.

[17:25] So the only thing that will work on the sides will not be the lighted artwork like in the alien cabinet from highway.

[17:31] It will be rad cows that will be on the side of the cabinet.

[17:35] Holy fuck.

[17:36] So now you've got the company that people have faith in that brings credibility to the whole story.

[17:41] Look, I hear the ambulance coming.

[17:43] Andrew Highway is probably racing right to my apartment right now.

[17:46] But Chicago gaming company will be making alien.

[17:49] Are you sitting down? Well fucking sit even lower.

[17:52] There's the next fucking thing. I hear this game is 30 days away.

[17:57] I hear like a month from now, they're going to start running alien machines and you're going to be able to buy them.

[18:02] I mean, it makes total sense. They don't have to fucking do much.

[18:06] All they have to do is get the game.

[18:09] You know, it's been designed. It's been coded.

[18:11] Everything, they just have to like get the parts and make the game.

[18:15] And apparently that has been happening behind the scenes.

[18:18] And this news is about to drop in the next month that alien pinball from Chicago gaming company,

[18:24] which is they're being they're being asked to contract manufactured this game on behalf of the pinball brothers.

[18:30] And that is fucking crazy to me.

[18:34] It is crazy to me that in a couple days, the two titles that I thought had no chance in hell of ever seeing the light of day are actually coming out.

[18:44] But I do feel a lot more confident about the Chicago gaming alien pinball news.

[18:49] That is happening 100% you again, I will shut this show down.

[18:54] I will shut this show down. I will tattoo the name Hilton on my butt if this does not occur in the pinball world.

[19:01] All right, that's how confident I am in this news. Holy shit. Holy shit.

[19:05] So see, you see what I'm saying?

[19:07] The Royal Rumble for your dollars continues to get even more interesting potentially LaBousky,

[19:13] alien for sure from Chicago gaming company, Willy Wonka, Steve Richie pin.

[19:18] And I know more, I actually know more about Stern's next titles.

[19:21] And I'll reveal that on another exclusive bombshell episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[19:28] I'll probably do it tomorrow. Why not just do like one every day?

[19:31] Well, eventually I'll run out of actual things to say leading up the T.P.F.

[19:35] And then I might just start making up shit.

[19:37] And we might even get Neil McCray on here to do like a four hour show like fuck it.

[19:40] You know, let's just do like a six hour show. Let's fucking go for the record six hours.

[19:44] All right. So look crazy, crazy, crazy news. Now let me settle down and let me think about this a little bit.

[19:52] So in terms of the artwork, I don't think they've changed orcs artwork on the play field.

[19:57] I don't know if they're going to use Brian Allen's hand drawn artwork on the back glass.

[20:01] That is the one thing I hope they would have done is just improve the art package.

[20:06] If I were them, I would have reached out to Brian Allen and actually had him do the cabinet.

[20:10] Now that might still be the case. I'm not sure what the art package is.

[20:13] What's also interesting, if you think about this, is highway pinball had that big screen on the back glass.

[20:20] And will that big screen be in the Valley Williams cabinet?

[20:23] And how do you do that? Because those weren't made for that.

[20:26] But they could easily engineer that. That's not too difficult.

[20:29] I'm really excited that we're going to see an alien pinball machine.

[20:32] A game that a lot of you have loved. A lot of you have sworn by as being one of the most immersive, incredible pinball games you've ever played.

[20:39] We're finally going to get it built to a quality standard that will make people excited.

[20:46] And here is a thing. If when this happens, they're going to sell a fucking ton of these.

[20:51] A fucking ton. I would hate to be October fest right now.

[20:56] Let me see what should I get. Alien or October fest. This is why theme matters.

[21:01] I mean, Andrew highway's smartest move was getting the alien theme.

[21:06] You know, he just couldn't do it. He couldn't manufacture it.

[21:09] But I know that there are so many alien fans out there.

[21:13] And the people who play this game, when it's working, they swear by it.

[21:17] Now, the reason why I think it's important, all of you know this.

[21:20] And I'm sorry if I've spoiled some of their like reveal is that people are like,

[21:25] that people are paying a lot of money to get the highway pinball versions of these games.

[21:30] And it's bullshit. And it needs to stop. And it's also why we've seen a lot of alien pinball machines trade hands recently.

[21:38] Why do you think you've been saying that game up for sale recently?

[21:41] Because people know that this is happening. And again, it's like little inner circle, good boys club of pinball that can eat is going to fucking blow up.

[21:50] So you can see me at tpf and you can shake my hand because I gave you this information when nobody else would Jeff print it on this weekend pinball.

[21:59] Marty put it up on head to head slam tilt.

[22:03] Come at a retirement guys do it. Ryan, I know you've left the show.

[22:07] That's the other bomb show Ryan is leaving head to head pinball.

[22:10] That's like, actually leaving guns and roses. Marty needs Ryan.

[22:13] Marty can't survive without Ryan. You got to get him back.

[22:16] You got him getting back, but we do wish Ryan all the best. I know he's going through it sucks. Ryan hope you get better bro.

[22:22] But look, this is fucking crazy. We finally have like news that came out of nowhere.

[22:27] Everybody this is fucking incredible. So take this to pin side.

[22:33] You can call me all sorts of names, but I am 100% sure this is happening.

[22:38] Chicago gaming company is making alien pinball fucking unreal. Have a great day everybody.

[23:08] We can pull it off to one another then try to get away into the night and let it pitch our own ceramic.

[23:19] And we're almost to the right. Let me say I think we're alone now.

[23:24] I can tell some seem to be anyone around. I think we're alone now.

[23:31] To be my boss is the only thing.
