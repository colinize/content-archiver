[00:00] A simple thing, where have you gone? I'm getting old and I need something to rely on. So tell me when, you gonna let me in? I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin.

[00:30] I'm Ada and I wanna talk about on this episode one simple thing. I wanna talk about pinball marketing and how I think that if the only strategy in all of pinball marketing is FOMO, right? That's the only thing they're gonna rely on to try to get us to buy a $7,000 to $15,000 item is the fear of missing out. That's the only thing they do.

[00:56] Companies don't confirm their themes in advance. They don't slowly show you the game being made. And the one thing they don't do is they absolutely don't ask the community, do you want this theme? Should we make this game? And here's why I think FOMO is the biggest problem right now in pinball because a pinball company cannot spend two years developing a game that people just don't want to play.

[01:26] And no pinball company should, right? Nobody should fall into that trap. Nobody should ever spend two years of development, of coding a game, of designing a game, of working with an artist, spend two years making a product for a niche community and then that niche community doesn't want it.

[01:48] And how did it end up like that? How did we end up with themes like Barrios' BBQ Challenge, Galactic Tank Force, Toy Story 4, The Godfather, Elton John? When you think about all of the effort that goes into these games, why are these companies missing the mark so poorly? And I think it's because this entire hobby has been marketing itself with FOMO.

[02:16] And you hear it from distributors. I mean the most famous phrase of bye bye bye. A game gets revealed and on the day it's revealed, this is how pinball companies do it. They develop a game in secret, nobody knows exactly what it is, then they reveal the game to the world and you're supposed to buy it instantly, instantly pay $7,000 to $15,000 on a game and do it all in one day.

[02:43] And that's what this hobby was built on over the last 10 years. And that was the prevailing way, right? That we were going to just pull the curtain off the thing and we were going to surprise and delight you and we were going to take your money instantly.

[02:58] And think about how that's worked now over the last few years as pinball prices have become this expensive and that's the only way they're going to market. And here's why I think more than ever, companies need to do market research before they even begin developing a game.

[03:14] I mean before they even start designing it, they should be asking the community and I saw Stern did this yesterday, they should be asking the community not just like what themes do you want to see, here's what I think a pinball company should be doing.

[03:29] If they are to succeed and win in the current pinball landscape, what they need to do is just secure a bunch of themes that they want to make, like just start there, secure the licenses to a few themes and then ask the community and say to them, hey look, we've got the following themes.

[03:50] Which ones would you like to see most? And then you could just tell people what you have. Why does it have to be this highly guarded secret? Because if you've secured the theme, much like we know now that Jersey Jack has secured the theme to Harry Potter because Joe Kamikow like told everybody.

[04:10] Okay so we know that. We knew Guns N' Roses was going to be made before they confirmed it. We knew it was going to be Elton John before they made the game. We knew it was going to be the godfather a year out. Like we know all this stuff, yet these companies don't ask us.

[04:25] And think about it like this. Imagine if Jersey Jack said to everybody like four years ago, we've got the following themes that we can make into a pinball machine. We've got Toy Story 4, we have Elton John, we have the godfather, and we have Guns N' Roses.

[04:43] Like if they said those are the four themes that we have secured, what are your interest level in those games? Guess what would have happened? There would have been almost no votes for games like Elton John and the godfather and Toy Story 4.

[04:59] And they would have heard that feedback and guess what? If they heard that feedback and they knew where consumers' minds were at, then they wouldn't have made those games. And I just think we need to stop with this like the only thing we're going to do is keep everything we have a secret and then pull the curtain off it and then we're going to try to get like all these shills and all these content creators that are shilling everything we make to try to get you to buy it instantly.

[05:26] That's the only approach to pinball marketing. And if they were smart, even if they wanted to make a game like Elton John, let's take Elton John for example. And this is just another example of how the way they launched that game is one of the reasons why the game is not selling.

[05:42] Because you really do only get one chance to make a first impression, especially if you've decided that FOMO is going to be the way we're going to go. All these pinball companies are doing it the same.

[05:53] So you know what that means is that your sales window is very short. So you need to nail it because if you're going to go all in on FOMO, then you need to make sure it's a take my money now theme. What you can't do and what won't work if you sign on for that FOMO approach, what won't work is slowly warming people up to the game.

[06:14] What won't work because you're not doing it is you're slowly telling people the story of why you landed the plane there. Why we're making Toy Story 4. Why are we making Elton John. Why you're going to be excited about Elton John. Why in six months time are you going to want to buy the Elton John game that we're making.

[06:33] See if they turned off the FOMO crap and actually marketed Elton John the right way and talked about for a few months the fact that it was going to be Elton John. That Steve Ritchie was going to design one of his best flowing games of all time.

[06:48] You start to do two things, right? You remove the mystery of what the theme is because everybody already knows it but you won't confirm it. So just remove that mystery and get people excited about it.

[06:58] Get people excited about why you're making that game, all the passion that went into it and then all the skeptics and all the cynics. Here's what they're going to do. They're going to get angry six months before the game comes out.

[07:09] So they're not going to spoil the release of the game and then you can actually make the release of the game something magical and special because it's not all shrouded in mystery.

[07:19] It doesn't only just become some three minute stupid sizzle reel video. It's much more. You've given it much more life. You've given it much more of a narrative than just here it is. We want to take your money now kind of video and they didn't do that and they didn't talk about it that way.

[07:36] And I'm not saying that would have saved Elton John because I think at the end of the day if they did market research they never would have made Elton John.

[07:42] So what I think these pinball companies need to start doing is they need to stop guessing. They are guessing what consumers want. They are guessing there's going to be enough interest in an $11,000 labyrinth.

[07:55] They're all guessing that there's going to be enough interest in Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Looney Tunes and sometimes they guess right but what happens when they guess wrong?

[08:06] And I think over the last few years we've seen more companies guess wrong about what people want to buy. And I don't want that. I don't want to do a podcast over the next few years where I'm just like scratching my head.

[08:19] Why are these companies getting it so wrong? Why are they going down a two year journey to make a product people don't really want? Why can't they all wake up and just behave a little bit differently?

[08:31] Back in the 90's they just used to put the games out on location. They would just put the whitewoods of a game and development out on location. It wasn't a big mystery.

[08:40] All the sales teams and all the distributors knew what was coming down the line. Why can't it be more like movie releases?

[08:46] I know what every single movie coming out over the next year and a half is. I know what every single car coming out over the next year and a half is.

[08:54] But I can't know what pinball machines are coming out. We have to keep this a closely guarded secret. Like out of all the things happening in the world it's pinball that has to be protected.

[09:04] It's pinball that has to be classified information. I think it's absolute garbage. I mean think about it because the whole approach is just like we need to create FOMO for the game on the line and that's it.

[09:15] Why is that it? Like if Stern Pinball came out and said hey look we're going to make Foo Fighters it's not going to be like you think. It's going to be a crazy adventure starring the Foo Fighters.

[09:25] Think about like Scooby Doo meets the Foo Fighters. It's going to be awesome Jack Danger's game you're going to want it. Not only are you going to want that game but then George Gomez and James Bond.

[09:35] We've put more assets into this James Bond game. If you're a James Bond fan you're really going to want this game and then we've got Keith Elwin Jaws is coming out and wait you see what he did with Jaws.

[09:46] But we're just going to tell you right now the shark is not going to eat the ball but you're going to understand why when you see this Keith Elwin Jaws machine. Why can't they just do that?

[09:54] Why can't we just know the next three titles for every company. The next titles for every company coming out this year.

[10:00] We already know it's Alice in Wonderland but DPX won't tell us and we can see the translate. We can see it right there. We all know it's Alice in Wonderland and I'm asking them for assets and I keep telling Barry over there.

[10:11] Guys you got to do more than just this. Like this is just so stale to me. So the only thing we know how to do is keep the title a secret and then we'll just show you the underside of the play field and then we'll reveal the game and take your money instantly.

[10:27] That's it. That's the only thing they're doing. We know it's Alice in Wonderland. What Melvin should be doing right now is just confirming it's Alice in Wonderland and start to walk us through how they went from a foam core of the game to the game that's going to be available to you very soon.

[10:45] You don't have to show the whole game. Why can't we see like once a month like a new aspect of the game leading up to it being for sale.

[10:55] Like why can't we see somebody even try that. We're not seeing any of that. And I'm just over this whole world of like bye bye bye on day one non refundable deposits and games where these manufacturers are guessing what we want because I think what's happening right now in Pimbal is actually good because now they're all realizing they guessed wrong.

[11:20] Like Steve Richie's name is not big enough to sell 4000 Elton John games. It should have sold more than it did and it would have sold more than it has if they would have marketed it better and they didn't do a good job marketing it and they have a marketing team over there and they know who they are and they don't try anything new.

[11:39] And that's the other thing about marketing. Imagine if I went to my clients on a daily basis and I just gave them the same exact tactic on every single assignment. They're not treating these games differently. What did they do differently when you think about the launch of guns and roses.

[11:58] The launch of Elton John the launch of Toy Story 4 and the launch of the Godfather right for radically different themes. Did they get creative with the way they launched them. Did they put Elton John machines in piano bars around the world as a way to just get it out there in an exciting way.

[12:17] Did they do anything unique. Have they done anything unique with any of these properties. Godfather takes place in New York City. There is not even a single Godfather pinball machine to play in New York City. They did absolutely nothing and you can't get away with it like this anymore.

[12:37] A company like American Pinball should be out of business. David Fix is making games for David Fix. The only problem with that is David Fix because he has the worst taste in the history of pinball and I would say that to his face. He has made decisions with Moukess's money and maybe he knows where the bodies are buried or something because the amount of bad decisions he's making.

[13:00] And then every time I see photos with Steve Bowden and Ryan McQuade and David Fix and they're all smiles and all smug. It just makes me scratch my head. What are they thinking Moukess. Someone should play this for you. You are running the worst pinball company right now.

[13:18] And it's embarrassing to you and your family that's financing this company and you've done no market research and this is what happens when you do no market research and the next game is going to be another failure because it's going to be Cuphead. And I get that a few of you like Cuphead but most of us don't. And again most of us don't want these themes.

[13:38] And we saw this week it might not be the Matrix it might be the Muppets and here's the thing. I'm not saying Muppets is a terrible theme for pinball but if it is the Muppets it's not going to be one of those games where you're going to be able to just pull the curtain off and sell 5,000 units. It's not that kind of theme and it's another game where if it is that you should get people to warm up to that theme because you have to be smart.

[14:05] You know even a game like Back to the Future. Barry's got Back to the Future. It's not a mystery. We all know that Dutch Pinball has Back to the Future. That's not going to stop people from buying the big Lebowski. And I think with a game like Back to the Future Barry should be spending more time getting people excited getting people hyped.

[14:22] Now you could argue he doesn't have to do anything but I disagree with that. You want to give some nuggets to people over a period of time. Like even if he just told us we're going to reveal our next game October whatever Back to the Future day is.

[14:33] Like October 21st or something like that. Like just start to get people excited. But we live in a pinball world now. At the amount of money these games cost. The fact that they don't pull us in more to their theme selection and don't ask the community for their advice.

[14:49] I think it's an insult to each and every one of us. I think every time a game comes out like ABBA and you're like oh you know like do we really want ABBA like as a community. And now did you hear what he said already the pinball brothers founder after he launched this game this week and said we're only making 800 units.

[15:06] He went on a podcast and said well if there's interest we'll make more. So think about that for a minute. We have a hobby now. We have manufacturers that are relying only on FOMO and then now they're lying about their own FOMO. It's like when Jersey Jack launched the Yellow Brick Road edition of Wizard of Oz.

[15:25] Remember what he did. Well these are limited. And then you ask Jack how many are they limited to. And he didn't have an answer. And he didn't know how many they were going to make. He's like well we're going to make about like 500 this year and then we'll go from there. That's limited edition. That's what's hard about.

[15:40] You know me even listening to like the content creation out there and all the people talking about pinball because nobody talks about this stuff. And you have to ask yourself why. Why is a community are most of the personalities and content creators not talking about these things.

[15:56] Is it because they want to remain friends with the manufacturers. Maybe it's some of that. Are they friends with the distributors. Maybe it's some of that. But I just don't get it. I don't think I've been in a hobby like this. That's so niche that misses the mark as hard as pinball misses the mark.

[16:12] I mean and here's what I mean by that when spooky pinball announces a game and they say we're only making eight hundred and eighty eight like that's not a lot of games for the amount of potential buyers of pinball and the fact that you're not even able to sell out on day one of eight hundred and eighty eight.

[16:32] That means you got the theme really wrong. Like you got it really wrong. If I was spooky pinball and I was planning to make just a thousand of a game. I would be picking themes where I know three thousand people are going to want it. Three thousand. Right. You always want to make one less than demand. And when you don't sell out you're making more than there is demand.

[16:57] And that's failure in the world of marketing. And so yeah I want to make a game where three thousand people want it. We're only going to make a thousand and it's priced right. I want every one of those people who buys one of those thousand games to own something that two thousand people couldn't have that wanted it.

[17:17] That's how you bacon value and second hand value to the customer. That's how you make someone feel good about getting your product. And that's how you create a great brand. But spooky pinball has for the most part just been making games for themselves. Alice Cooper Rob Zombie Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[17:38] Like the best theme they've made with Scooby Doo but they overmade that even you know nineteen hundred and sixty nine Scooby Doo's it's too many and none of these companies none of them not spooky not stern nobody nobody is putting out there the games they're thinking of making and seeing if you really want them.

[17:56] And I'm just saying for this niche community and this niche hobby to survive much longer. I think these people need to start thinking about a different playbook. I think if you have the licenses secured. Don't just rush and develop all those games if there's not the demand and it's so easy.

[18:12] It is free and that's the part that kills me is the market research will cost them nothing but the cost of getting it wrong will cost them millions millions people not a few hundred thousand a few million dollars and it's a domino effect when they get it wrong.

[18:31] It doesn't just cost the manufacturer millions you're costing all of your distributors who have to buy a game nobody wants like that's costing them like they're going to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars locked up in games nobody wants that's not good and it's just too small of a hobby to constantly be getting it wrong.

[18:51] So to summarize on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast what I would like to see is a company have the courage to stop only using FOMO as the only tactic to sell your product bring the community into the themes you're thinking of making reach out to license holders on themes and see if they're available maybe lock up a few and then take those to the community and say which one of these would you like to see

[19:18] and do that before you start development and for those companies out there that already have games in development try a different approach if you're going to release Cuphead to the pinball market you need to get people to warm up to that you can't just pull the curtain off of it because you know why and this is the mistake that they're all making is that Ryan McQuade might love Cuphead but 5000 people who are potential new and box pinball buyers do not

[19:46] and what Ryan McQuade needs to do is get those people to be as excited about Cuphead as he is and to do that you're going to want people to play Cuphead for a few months you would have wanted people to listen to Elton John music for a while before revealing the game you would have wanted people to understand like how cool the mechs are going to be and how this and that's going to happen in the game and the LED piano you're going to want to warm people up to these themes but they're not even doing that

[20:13] and you know what that shows me there's a level of delusion and arrogance at these pinball companies that they think were so stupid as buyers that anything they reveal anything they release and anything they put in a box we're going to buy and there are some people out there that are just enthusiastic about everything happening in pinball the reason why canadis pinball podcast is number one the reason why this show got voted the favorite pinball podcast every time there was an award show is I think I'm the only one that's going to win this game.

[20:43] I'm the only one out there that doesn't love every single pinball machine that doesn't just blindly say all pinball is good pinball and if you think that you should unsubscribe because that's not how we get to better product but it's not that hard to make good pinball it's not that hard to make great pinball even from like a design level how can you design a crappy game in 2024 how there's so many great games where you could just steal ideas from them and make it good I don't understand it's just geometry right you can't take a key fell win game.

[21:13] I mean look at Barry O's barbecue challenge design it's garbage and like three designers worked on that it's absolute garbage look at galactic tank force it's garbage it shoots like garbage and Dennis Nordman should know it shoots like garbage because every time you play one it shoots like garbage it's just the way it is I would have loved it when Eric Minier was making guns and roses like at Whitewood stage like let some people bang on it.

[21:43] Get some advice get some feedback they don't do that he designed that game clearly without any feedback why didn't Pat Lawler help Eric Minier design a guns and roses with better flow the game looks amazing the flow is not there it's not good there's not a lot of combos the shots are not great the geometry is not there why you've got one of the greatest pinball designers in history Pat Lawler his games flow great his games shoot great and how come he didn't help Eric Minier design a better flowing game is there internal competition at these pinball companies it's time for everybody to wake up.

[22:13] You know as far as I'm concerned all that's in the past but now we're thinking about pinball's future and I think the companies that start to act differently start to launch games differently I think the stupid error of bye bye bye those people look stupid right now they look really stupid I don't want to be talked to like that don't scream at me don't make goat noises at me like I work really hard for my money and I want a toy that I don't even need I'm about to buy a toy I don't even need and you're going to scream at me and make stupid sound and act like we all should be celebrating the fact that we're going to be doing something that's going to be done.

[22:43] We're just making distributors money no that's over like it's over I want to support my distributor friends I don't find it funny that all these companies are just guessing at everything and then they want me to like bail them out I mean that's what we're doing people when we buy these games that don't have a lot in it and they're $15,000 and it's not a theme you want you're bailing out their bad decisions and I think each and every one of us I'm telling you this just say this with me no more FOMO no more FOMO I am not going to run and buy.

[23:13] I'm not going to buy a new inbox like this anymore I'm not going to wake up and think I need another game I want to see these companies start to treat me with more respect I think they should show us the themes ahead of time I think they should slowly launch the games to get us excited and I think this era of like everything's a mystery and they're just going to pull the curtain off it and then blitz me over 48 hours with a bunch of stuff trying to get my money and that's the window I have to make a decision I think that's stupid and the moment you free yourself from that behavior.

[23:43] The moment you stop bailing out these companies is the moment we're going to get better pinball because then they're going to have to think oh shoot we need to do this differently we need to make games they want we need to ask them their opinions it's their hard-earned money we're in servitude of them do you feel that way from these companies do you feel that way from Jersey Jack from Stern from any of these companies do they pull you into their process at all do they do focus groups raise of hands have any of you ever been invited.

[24:13] To a focus group there are people who are listening to this right now who have spent a quarter million dollars on stern machines have you ever been invited to a focus group where you signed an NDA even and we're told potential titles they were thinking of making no they don't give.

[24:33] Two craps about what we think they don't or they would pull us in everybody I want to thank you for listening to the world's greatest pinball podcast and it's only the world's greatest pinball podcast because of you and the canada army the canadiens as we call them now we collectively I know at least probably a thousand people listen to each one of these shows I know my haters listen to these shows here's the thing we're going to do it together and more people are going to hear this message from me.

[25:03] I want to create the right kind of change in pinball and the way we do it is by not running at new and box games trust me on this let's make these companies pull us in more and reveal these games differently and enough of the BS it's over people if you run at it on day one you're going to regret it everybody have a great Friday canada out.

[25:33] So what don't we know

[25:48] This can't be the end of everything
