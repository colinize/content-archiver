[00:00] What a weird day for pinball people. We're gonna talk about it right now. I've been thinking

[00:07] about it, I've been mulling it over, and I want to talk to everybody here about what

[00:12] we witnessed today by American Pinball, what it means to have this final game and this

[00:18] March Madness blitz sort of come out of the gate in such a weird way, and we're gonna

[00:26] talk all about it right now. Let me just turn it off the TV. So here's the thing.

[00:35] Here's the thing. I absolutely, like many of you, would suck, let's get this camera up a

[00:43] little bit. Let's do this, let's do this. Okay, that's better. Alright, like most of

[00:51] you, I was absolutely so surprised that after all of this time, after two years, two and

[00:59] a half years in the making, American Pinball launches a game in a way that just feels like

[01:09] they tripped out of the gate. And I want to talk about that. I want to talk about, thank

[01:18] you, Cliff. Yeah, my podcast was fire, and it was 10 minutes long, but I think the main

[01:23] issue I have with all of this is you can't launch a game like this and then have your

[01:28] distributors knocking on everyone's door for our money. We are either gonna stand united

[01:34] as Pinball buyers and stop with this nonsense. It's not even American Pinball's fault, they

[01:39] just did not even show clearly enough to even warrant game is on sale today. What they showed

[01:47] us two weeks ago before order banks even opened up. And this pathetic practice needs to stop.

[01:53] And I mean it. It's just getting absolutely pathetic. Is the screen frozen? Is my screen

[01:59] frozen? Or not? Am I frozen? Can you guys see me all right? Can you? It's not frozen. Okay,

[02:22] I just want to say this. This is absolute. It's at the point now where it's over. There's

[02:29] just been there's been too many good launches. Foo Fighters was launched tremendously well.

[02:36] Pulp Fiction was launched tremendously well. Godfather was launched tremendously well. And

[02:42] my what I mean by tremendously well is this. Everybody saw, I think enough information from

[02:51] the streams to the the the featurettes that Zach and Greg did for straight down the middle. I

[02:59] mean Pulp Fiction just won the best launch of the year easily hands down. And now you're gonna

[03:06] come out with this game with no gameplay with a weird theme with a weird who am I as the player

[03:15] like what is that a tank or is that a spaceship and what's with all this 90s porn acting going on

[03:20] and is this a 1950s game is this a 1990s crappy video game game is this a game where I'm a tank

[03:27] what what's the deal with ice cream what is going on all of this and then all of it just feels like

[03:34] they wanted to make something different but they also needed to to to bring us into this galactic

[03:43] tank force universe get us into the storyline get us into everything that you can't launch like this

[03:50] you can't just show up and drop a game on a Wednesday at one with a crappy two minute video

[03:58] and then ask people for 11,000 and then and then ask distributors to tell people with a straight

[04:05] face that you want $17,500 for this signature edition of the game when I heard that I literally

[04:11] hung up the phone as fast as I ever could on a distributor not rudely but I'm like I gotta go

[04:17] I gotta go the fact that they think they could charge 6000 more than the le

[04:24] for a freaking translate and a lunchbox and I'm just gonna say this when you do that American

[04:31] pinball you're treating this community with absolutely no respect and I think these pinball

[04:37] companies think these pinball buyers have no self-respect because no self-respecting man who

[04:42] works hard for his money or woman who works hard for her money would ever look at that signature

[04:47] game and and write a check for $17,500 they didn't even go over what this signature game had in any

[04:56] videos they didn't show us the translate that's 3d they didn't do anything where's my freaking

[05:00] thermos I don't even know where the thermos is and you get one chance to make a first impression

[05:10] this game stumbled out of the gates everything leaked the leaks did more to get people excited

[05:16] than their own content think about that for a minute the leaks of this game got more people

[05:25] excited than their own content they don't have a marketing department they don't know what they're

[05:34] doing from a marketing standpoint American pinball is rudderless in that department

[05:44] clearly they were rushing this at the 11th hour something's up their plan is not going according

[05:52] to plan they canceled John's game at jack bar he didn't get it nobody is getting the games dropped

[05:59] off on location the week of tpf this is going to be a very make or break moment for this game

[06:08] at Texas pinball festival I I was excited about this game I'm no longer that excited about the game

[06:17] I didn't see anything in the video they shared that showed any really great

[06:21] mechanisms or toys or anything so it is what it is and they have nobody to blame it's not

[06:28] canada being negative Nancy being toxic they gave us what they wanted us to react to I am reacting to

[06:37] their content their inability to market this thing right all these campy things franchise

[06:43] been putting up like these 1950 ads this game feels nothing like that they could have made the

[06:51] the lcd images these campy 1950 like characters that are illustrated and animate them somehow

[06:58] instead of this live action thing going on you know another game is live action in it Batman 66

[07:06] godfather willy wonka do I need to keep going and mention every star wars every single game that

[07:13] uses actual live action assets that were shot by professional directors with multi-million

[07:18] dollar budget movies is going to look much better than getting in a bunch of c and d list actors

[07:25] in a green screen in your chicago studio wherever you did it it doesn't work you can't work like this

[07:35] I'm going to go back to the first one Bill said how do they not read the room Bill I'm absolutely

[07:41] flabbergasted that they did not read the room that they thought what they had in the can would be

[07:47] good enough after what we saw and with with so many games available right now and so much money

[07:57] getting tied up in all these new launches I thought american pinball really was going to launch strong

[08:03] the video didn't show us really how the tank folds they didn't show us how the topper works

[08:12] do they even do they even have a gameplay video there is there's absolutely no

[08:18] where's I thought there was going to be this gameplay video from this arcade guy this Hollywood

[08:23] arcade or whatever

[08:34] you

[08:39] you know David Fix is a nice guy and he's been at the helm of this company for a long

[08:43] for a long time but it's it's enough already it's enough already like if I move cash and

[08:53] like what are you doing man what are you doing like how is this what we're doing

[09:03] it's it's not it's not the way you do things

[09:09] I'm I'm absolutely blown away by that $17,500 price tag I'm insulted by that price tag

[09:17] how dare you how dare you charge $6,500 more for nothing that is an insult to how hard we all work

[09:30] it's an insult to the value of things why are you becoming the greedy a-holes

[09:36] american pinball this is not the american way you're you're a boutique company you're not supposed

[09:42] to try to out price stern and jersey jack pinball you're supposed to give us value for the money

[09:49] and you just treated us all like a-holes you didn't why did you do that why did you make this

[09:56] signature edition why didn't you just make 500 tank additions charge 11 or 11 5 and everyone would

[10:04] have been happy but now everyone who buys that one they're always going to know there's a 3d

[10:09] translate out there somewhere october fest and houdini have way more from what I can see

[10:16] way more mechanically going on in it too okay way more and I'm sorry but like I don't even think

[10:24] there's anything mechanically wow in the game and that's like been one of the trends of all of

[10:31] these games to be honest like there's nothing mechanically wow in scooby-doo there's not really

[10:37] anything mechanically wow in poof fighters there's not anything mechanically what the most the

[10:42] the most interesting mechanism that has been made I'm just going to be completely freaking candid

[10:46] people the most interesting mechanism that has been made in all of these games has probably

[10:50] been the final resistance tank okay that multi-morphic made I mean isn't it crazy it's like multi-morphic

[10:57] is probably making some of the best mechanisms in modern pinball with the stuff in weird owl

[11:03] with the stuff in heist and the stuff in final resistance the irony of it all the guy who's

[11:09] freaking 80 percent of his game is a damn screen is putting more mechanical wow in his games and

[11:14] all these other companies that are just relying on artwork and and what lights that's it shots are

[11:22] the new toys in pinball it's so easy to avoid all of this now I have not bought anything other than a

[11:31] $1,000 deposit on pulp fiction because I'm not an idiot of course pulp fiction is going to be a keeper

[11:37] for everybody who gets one pulp fiction is that is a monumental move in our industry

[11:44] quentin tarantino's only pinball machine executed perfectly for their vision and that's the thing

[11:51] it's like they executed what tarantino wanted perfectly that's why he's quentin freaking tarantino

[11:58] if collected tank force is supposed to be some 50s sci-fi campy bubble gum movie

[12:04] they executed it from what we can see so far poorly and the only reason we're saying the word

[12:12] poorly is they haven't shown us anything more and I can't imagine right now they're feeling good

[12:20] reading pinside and the other thing is this well there's no way Tony that's going to be the case

[12:27] there's a thousand pulp fiction le's and 80 batman sle's I'm telling you right now looking at all

[12:34] these inane prices and ridiculous prices and bill don't even say it I know you don't like the way

[12:40] batman shoots but batman sle is just going to keep going up in value trust me trust me to be a $40,000

[12:47] game one day because of how few they made and it's the prettiest game stern's ever made and it's the

[12:53] master piece of lineman sheets and it's got the greatest use of clips and code and call outs and

[13:00] sounds and it's such a good game shoots like a dog though I get it shoots like a dog

[13:09] Greg Colton's in the house now like I just think they executed this thing poorly I think they

[13:18] I think they executed the release video poorly and I think Elvira is a great game too I think that

[13:27] the weirdest part of like this game is how we're now promoting wire form ramps as like a like a crazy

[13:34] feature when we start promoting wire form ramps as a crazy feature in a pinball machine you know

[13:43] they've got nothing to sell you on and also these wire forms for Dennis Nordman a guy who's you know

[13:50] did some amazing things with plastic ramps and and crazy directions of ramps how disappointing are

[13:58] these wire form ramps they're so basic go look at the wire forms in Godzilla and Avengers and see

[14:05] Zambietti blows these wire form ramps out of the water and when they when they promoted Godzilla

[14:12] they didn't even have to talk about the damn wire forms okay I mean think about it Godzilla they

[14:20] actually had legitimate things to talk about that were awesome that were exciting that were cool

[14:25] features that were toys and mechs that fit the theme perfectly I just I really I really believe

[14:35] that if we're gonna see stuff like this we are gonna start to see some of these pinball companies

[14:40] just cease to exist um very sloppy launch I don't know who's accountable I don't know how it ended

[14:50] up being this way it feels like they were on a rush to get the tpf and they weren't ready nothing

[14:56] about this game feels like it was like like the the marketing around it nothing feels ready to go

[15:03] um they the animations I don't know what to tell you they don't look good so I get you did a

[15:10] public relations story about the young girl from college you did your animations but it looks like

[15:14] you got what you paid for you probably got some very junior level person working on your animations

[15:22] and then look at what Stern put into Foo Fighter animations and you're charging just as much money

[15:29] just as much money as the animations that are in godfather and as I said I think pulp fiction has

[15:35] better animations than galactic tank force quote canada on that and I don't mean to be down on this

[15:43] stuff I'm about to go to Texas and and and rub elbows with all these people but I really expected

[15:49] more from this game I don't know what they were thinking and I think Dennis Nordman David Ficks

[15:56] all of them franchise over they they need someone like me they need someone like me in the room

[16:04] like they're like everyone's stuck in their own vacuum they're like they're like their own inside

[16:08] joke that no one else is getting and it's not working if you launch a pinball machine with a

[16:15] captive audience who's highly engaged with your product and look read the pin side thread everyone's

[16:20] just like ragging on this thing I mean if canada was working at american pinball I would never

[16:28] greenlit this thing to begin with I mean let's just start there I probably would have been able

[16:34] to help them hopefully like secure something better than you know not they lost sonic the hedgehog

[16:40] then they do this what are we doing here guys like go get the last starfighter dudes if we're

[16:47] gonna be boutique and we just need to sell 1500 games let's go get some damn movies like labyrinth

[16:55] last starfighter and make them like at least there's like some nostalgia some audience to these

[17:02] games if we can't afford the big games then how did deep root get the goonies license okay so we

[17:08] need to stop with this it's not gonna work you can't follow look this is like I don't know how

[17:16] they're gonna they need to turn people back on to this game somehow and and if they just get up there

[17:22] at tpf and start mumbling about ice cream and tanks it's not gonna work and I'm sorry but like tpf

[17:31] and watching people play this game over the shoulder is not gonna be good either they needed to have

[17:37] given this game to like a greg and a zack or a jack danger to actually make some content

[17:44] so that's that you know I mean you know they know this all too well I don't have to tell them

[17:52] these guys are fully aware of how to really launch a game in 2023 it's embarrassing thank you for

[18:00] the stars it's embarrassing franchise my guts now but you know if you're everybody on that team

[18:09] everyone who's on that apron card everybody who worked on this game

[18:15] should have had more accountability and responsibility to make sure we launch this thing right

[18:22] all of your hard work comes down to your execution of this stuff

[18:29] but more than that I'm still absolutely disgusted that that they want our money after showing just

[18:41] that that they want our money that they want to like all these distros want to come at you with

[18:46] buy this thing now I don't know what world the rest of you are living in all right we just let

[18:54] it's not going to be a good year for people at work

[18:59] numbers are tough times are tough clients are pulling back budgets you know how like

[19:05] you know how easy it is when I hear that from the business side of things

[19:10] watching a half a million people in the tech industry get laid off

[19:14] watching all my friends who went on crypto broke you know how easy it is knowing that you know

[19:20] I'm in the market for a house for killing and brandy you know how easy it is

[19:25] when someone says to me yeah galactic tank force is 17 500 get the out of here with that

[19:34] gtfo with that bs and you know what it is too they didn't have the balls to put the price on it

[19:43] themselves and I'm going to get really strident right now okay and if you have kids in the room

[19:50] turn them off or get turn them off get them out of the room I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna go off

[19:56] the handle a little bit I haven't been drinking but I want I want to I want to tell you how I

[20:01] really feel inside right now with all this call for price bullshit because I'm gonna call it what

[20:06] it is it's bullshit if you're a company and you want to price something then stand behind your

[20:15] fucking price stand behind your fucking price don't bullshit hide like a coward and have your

[20:23] distributors tell everybody to call for price so as a company you can distance yourself from the

[20:30] bullshit because it's bullshit and the bullshit you're trying to play because we're not f in stupid

[20:37] is this is you want to hook some early adopters and screw them over by getting them to pay full

[20:44] price for your bond for fucking 20 grand and your galactic signature for 17 5 and some idiots bought

[20:51] at those prices and then you know it's gonna happen just like James Bond 60th you're giving

[20:57] the reason why you don't want to advertise the price or put it in writing because your cowards

[21:02] about it is you want to allow the distributors to keep lowering the price until they sell all of them

[21:09] everyone freaking loses I just think it's bullshit I haven't had a single drink tonight

[21:17] I'm sick of this practice I don't care what you want to price your effing game at but stand behind it

[21:25] price it like a man like a grown adult look me in the eyes and tell me you think galactic tank

[21:31] force signature edition should be 17 500 before tax and shipping look me in the eyes David fix and

[21:41] set that price call for price bullshit call for price we all know what's gonna happen you set it

[21:51] that price so everyone would go in and buy the le's thinking it's a bargain at 11 you're using that

[21:56] as a sleazy tactic to sell all 500 le's call for price imagine if I went into a room and told the

[22:04] client here's the idea they're like Chris how much is it gonna cost I'm not gonna tell you call for

[22:09] price every time we see that stupid phrase it means they want to fuck with you they want to

[22:18] mislead you they want to see how how much they can get you to bite at the top of that

[22:25] ladder and they'll keep lowering it every month just to get rid of the inventory call for price my

[22:31] ass bullshit get this call for price shit out of our hobby get it out it's an asshole move

[22:41] it's a cowardly move it it's fucked over everybody in alvira 40th okay because you know what happened

[22:51] stern didn't want to price that game so people call for price and the dealer's colluded and charged

[22:56] 25 000 my friend just got offered an alvira 40th new inbox you ready for it for 15 grand 15 grand

[23:08] 10 000 less than people were buying that game for a brand new call for price my ass

[23:17] stupid stupid we need to get back to more transparency we need to get back to understanding

[23:26] that these things are not fucking automobiles and again I don't mean to curse I'm just in one of

[23:32] those moods they're not fucking automobiles guys they're not they're not Rolex watches

[23:38] all right what the hell and and what's gonna happen when everyone wakes up from this hangover

[23:44] of just running at everything and and and buying everything in sight you're all gonna start losing

[23:50] two to three thousand at the minimum at the effin minimum that's what you're gonna start losing on

[23:58] every single game you buy at these high prices because the prices have nowhere to go but down

[24:03] we used to buy a fucking stern le just a few years ago for 7500 fucking Godzilla was 10 500

[24:13] dollars and it has way more in it than Beatles and Foo Fighters combined 10 5 and that was pushing it

[24:23] and we all said 10 000 was the freaking that was it like that was our limit

[24:29] now you guys are writing checks for 16 500 for an empty godfather

[24:37] congratulations you just lost four thousand dollars in one year I hope you put four thousand plays on

[24:44] it these jerkeys are gonna sell it for less than two in her plays and take a bath and I get it you're

[24:50] so rich you guys are so rich but I thought people became rich because they were fucking smart

[24:57] isn't that how you get rich because you're fucking smart did you get rich by overpaying for

[25:02] fucking everything do you get rich by going to mcdonald's and offering them 50 bucks for a

[25:08] quarter fucking pounder because it's tasty I wish more of you rich guys would stop making stupid

[25:17] moves I'm all for high-end pinball this ain't high-end pinball guys it's one of the most barren jersey

[25:26] jack games there's way more toys in like older sterns than these modern games this isn't what I

[25:34] was talking about when I said there is a high end of the market what's happening now in pinball

[25:41] is these are like priced like a bugatti with a fucking inline four inside it with just 200

[25:48] horsepower cargument you're welcome having had a single drink see I don't need drinks

[25:56] you just don't want me to curse all the time I don't like cursing it's been a family show

[26:01] it's been a family show for all these years if you agree with what I'm saying kick your brother for

[26:06] some stars but that's how I feel and I and I feel like our hobby can really

[26:16] I feel like our hobby could really suffer if this just becomes the new norm

[26:25] if this is the new norm what you're going to see is more and more people exit the hobby than enter it

[26:33] that's just the way it's going to be

[26:37] I I because it's not fun because it's not fun the pricing is out of control the greed is out of

[26:44] control the you know the lack of triple-a themes is not even there I mean think about it like I was

[26:51] just thinking about you're telling me someone said this is the greatest time ever to be in pinball

[26:55] this is the greatest month in the history of pinball you're fucking telling me that the greatest

[27:00] that the greatest time to be in live in pinball is foo fighters scooby-doo

[27:05] final resistance galactic tank force the godfather are you I mean like what like what happened people

[27:13] where's where the a themes out of all of these games obviously I feel like foo fighters was the

[27:20] one that was executed the best I think foo fighters and pulp fiction are the two games when the dust

[27:28] eppin settles the two games that were executed the best were those two absolutely those two

[27:38] pulp fiction and foo fighters to me are the ones where if I'm in on them and many of you are

[27:45] I I think you you made the right decisions I think it's too early to see what the deal is with godfather

[27:52] I think godfathers are all I think they're overpriced I think everybody knows that everyone saw how

[27:58] toy stories lost so much money you're going to see the same thing happen to godfather it's just

[28:03] not going to hold value jersey jack is pricing these games as if every game is pirates of the

[28:09] caribbean in hot demand and yet these games have a third of what pirates had in it mechanically our

[28:16] our eyes work you're not going to fool us with just light shows it's just not going to work guys

[28:23] we see it there's no toys in the game other than that spinning disc name me one toy and godfather

[28:30] a toy name me one toy and godfather

[28:37] and I'll wait here all night and yet you're going to charge 15k because you stuck on some

[28:43] tacky gold things to the legs of the machine I mean like it's kind of the theme right sticking

[28:47] tacky things onto the legs of a pinball machine now allows you to charge a lot of money colactic

[28:56] tank 417 5 godfather's 15 thousand dollars they don't want me in this hobby game I'm not going to

[29:05] get a warm reception by a lot of these companies at Texas pinball festival I don't care I don't care

[29:12] I love pinball I love what pinball can be I love so many games that have already come out

[29:19] I'm not in love with this new system of just buy before plan everybody just give a little

[29:26] sizzle and then ask for so much money and we're all supposed to just like jump on board without

[29:32] even like questioning whether or not we need another game in our collection whether or not there's

[29:37] enough value whether or not there was enough engineering or creativity that went into this

[29:42] game I mean look I love what they did with food fighters yes I would have liked a little bit more

[29:47] toys in the game I don't think it has that many toys but I I think the execution of it was done

[29:53] really well I think the execution of pulp fiction was amazingly done well you know amazing like

[30:02] they nailed it they nailed it we all were skeptical now we all want one perfectly done everything else

[30:09] that's come out scooby is definitely spooky's best game it's not saying that much some of the

[30:16] spooky games have been meh but it's their best game to date and spooky doesn't play games they

[30:23] tell you transparently what they're going to do and they deliver on their on their transparency

[30:29] and and they're they're part of us you know lover hate spooky I don't care those guys are in the

[30:35] community they talk to us directly they're not hiding like cowards they're not assholes asking

[30:42] us to call for price I mean it when I say it if you say call for price in this hobby that's an

[30:51] asshole move it is a coward move it is not what should be in pinball because I call for price

[31:04] you tell me 17 five why the f can't you just put 17 five on your facebook for sale ad

[31:12] why does everybody have to call you and then if I write that in the comment section you're going

[31:17] to delete my comments because what you want to do is you want to sell to asshole number one for

[31:25] 17 five on monday and then realize nobody else wants it at 17 five and then you want to go and

[31:32] you want to sell it for 16 five a week later and you don't want the guy who bought it for 17 five

[31:38] to call you up and ask for a thousand dollars back that's why it's an asshole move and is nobody

[31:45] smart enough to understand that is it just my private school education that allows me to analyze

[31:51] these asshole moves in pinball and then when the guy stops buying at 16 five you're going to be

[31:58] unloading those signature editions for 15 five another week later and when these assholes buy it

[32:05] at 15 five now the asshole who bought it at 17 five is super pissed off because why if he just waited

[32:11] two weeks he would have got it for two thousand dollars off but you don't want anyone to know that

[32:17] you don't want anyone to know who got it for what this is not some fucking airline ticket guys with

[32:22] variable pricing based upon date time and availability it's a fucking singular pinball machine

[32:29] where everyone has the same fucking experience and i'm cursing again you're never going to get

[32:34] me cursing again like this but i'm just and i'm sober you i have not had a single drink cross my

[32:41] heart on my soul on my mother's soul i have not had a single lick of booze

[32:49] it's an asshole move and why aren't more people complaining about call for price

[32:56] i don't know maybe it's because

[33:01] maybe it's because so much of the content creation is getting kickbacks

[33:06] i think brenda might be home brenda oh welcome home you're you're interrupting a very strident

[33:20] facebook live i've actually started cursing on this one but i'm not i'm sober you look great

[33:38] killing went down great like a champion um yeah guys i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap this up

[34:40] are coming to this convention i hear i've never met pinball people i haven't been at this restaurant

[34:45] during this convention and i was like i was like curb your enthusiasm curb your enthusiasm get ready

[34:55] for some cargo shorts and some some t-shirts anyway everybody look have a good night i'm just

[35:05] trying to get rid of some of this crappy stuff happening in pinball i don't like the greed that's

[35:10] permeating pinball lately i don't like seeing my friends priced out of a hobby that they love so much

[35:17] and i think we need to start standing together on this and i don't think we should all be on a mission

[35:23] to just put money in the pockets of manufacturers and distributors without without even like

[35:30] analyzing what they're doing without even asking questions call for price is the biggest bs move

[35:38] in pinball and it needs to be eradicated it is a cowardly move by all parties involved and the

[35:44] reason they're doing it is they want to be able to keep lowering that price every week until they

[35:50] get rid of their inventory but everyone who goes in early is going to get screwed and they don't want

[35:55] you to know what other people paid and that's not how pinball should be i should know what everybody

[36:00] paid for their game because we all should pay the same f in price and i mean it when i got into this

[36:07] hobby a little dirty secret all of these major stern distributors you know how they were becoming

[36:11] the major distributors is they were selling the games for much lower than stickered to their good

[36:15] old boy circle and all those guys were paying less than everybody else and that is why they were

[36:21] buying everything that is why they got all the allocations of all the le's because they were in

[36:27] that good old boy little circle i never got that i never paid less than anybody else i always paid

[36:34] exactly what everybody else paid i haven't gotten a single special privilege ever ever i could i've

[36:41] never got a kickback i've never got and nothing because i'm one of you all right and the other

[36:48] people i'm telling you there's a reason why i don't hear this much because a lot of the other

[36:52] people making your content trust me they're getting kickbacks and they're getting a thousand dollars

[36:57] off on every game they buy a thousand dollars off on every game they buy so of course they're not

[37:04] going to want to talk about this stuff or start to you know kick this can down the road because

[37:08] i'm not getting a thousand dollars off it's a lot easier when you're getting discounts you know to

[37:14] shut up about this stuff and just keep pushing that buy buy buy mentality you know and and call for

[37:20] price bs so canada's the only dude like i'm standing on an island here just trying to be like this

[37:28] isn't right who thought i would be it the guy wearing all the gucci is the one trying to stand up for

[37:33] value the most overpriced clothing in the world well not the most expensive but you know what i mean

[37:39] but this is something that we should stick up for okay i'm not saying it i'm not saying it again
