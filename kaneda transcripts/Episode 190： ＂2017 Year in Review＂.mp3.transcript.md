[00:00] It's the moment you've been waiting for,

[00:23] with Chris at 10!

[00:53] always great to have a distributor who hooks you up and is there for you. I think that's part of

[00:59] owning Pimball and part of having Pimball peace of mind is having great distributors out there.

[01:04] All right, so here's what we're going to do. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to go

[01:09] down the list of manufacturers and we're going to talk about how we feel their year went in 2017.

[01:17] Then I want to give you sort of my picks for this week in Pimball's annual awards. So the

[01:24] Twippy awards, I'm going to go down their list of all the different things they have nominated

[01:29] and I'm going to say which I would pick for those. And then I'm going to leave you as we close out

[01:34] 2017. I'm going to leave you with 10 final thoughts that I think are the key to Pimball happiness

[01:42] because I know that's what you're all searching for on a weekly and daily and hourly basis

[01:47] in this hobby. Okay, now look, I could easily, I was thinking a lot about how I wanted to position

[01:54] my thoughts on these Pimball manufacturers. And it's really hard. It's really hard to sort of

[02:01] give an opinion about these Pimball manufacturers and be fair and balanced and remove myself from

[02:08] the equation and just look at it objectively because Pimball is a 100% subjective thing.

[02:15] Some people look at this hobby and they're always cranky about it, they're always down and out

[02:20] about it. Other people look at this hobby and they think all Pimball is great. They're the

[02:25] forever optimist. No company out there in Pimball can do any wrong. I think I fall somewhere in the

[02:31] middle. So what I'm going to try and do on this podcast is to give a fair sort of balanced

[02:37] opinion about how I think all these companies did in 2017. So you might see some stuff that's

[02:43] optimistic, some stuff that's pessimistic. But I ultimately try to give those two things to add up

[02:49] to be realistic. Okay, let's do it. And let's start with the top. Let's start with Stern Pimball,

[02:56] the Juggernaut Stern Pimball. What kind of year do we think Stern Pimball had? Just to remind

[03:02] everybody that titles that Stern really produced in 2017 were Batman, Star Wars, Aerosmith,

[03:12] ACDC Vault Edition, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Now these were the new titles that were coming

[03:19] off the line that Stern. They still were shipping out some of their older titles as well. So what

[03:24] kind of year do I think Stern had? I think Stern kind of had a little bit of a mixed bag year.

[03:29] And if you look at the titles, if you look at the titles that came out, there was a lot of

[03:34] inconsistencies, primarily in code and getting a game to consumers and shipping a game to consumers

[03:42] in a format is acceptable. Right? So Batman 66 probably the glaring pain point for Stern Pimball

[03:51] because of how long it has taken Lyman Sheets to get the game to where it's now a good game.

[03:59] But it took a full year. And it's easy for me to put Batman in my apartment right now and say

[04:04] the game's great. Game wasn't great back when it was shipping in December, January of 2017.

[04:11] So it's been a long painful ride for people on Batman. And after Batman, Aerosmith came out.

[04:19] And Aerosmith came out with pretty complete code. Amazing art package by Dirty Donny.

[04:26] Great LCD implementation into the game. Great toy box mechanism that is on every single model of

[04:32] the game. Aerosmith, I think Aerosmith may have to go down as the best bang for the buck

[04:40] game of 2017. I think Aerosmith Pro at $5,200 is the, I think it might be the best bang for the

[04:48] buck. And as much as people want to complain about how expensive football is becoming this and that,

[04:54] this and that, the fact that you get all of that in Aerosmith Pro, I think is a phenomenal package.

[05:01] Right? I also think it was a, it was a win for Stern as they brought LCD technology to Stern Pimball.

[05:09] Remember we've been waiting for this technology to arrive for a long time. And I do think Stern's

[05:15] implementation of the LCD screen is done really well. I think it's the perfect size. I think it

[05:22] looks good. I think their games still look like Pimball machines without too much of it being

[05:27] digital. I don't think Stern relies a lot on screens to tell the story as much as, you know, well,

[05:36] we're going to talk about that with Star Wars, but I think the screen looks good. Now, I think

[05:41] where Stern is sort of figuring it out and has had some misses is how to sort of implement the LCD

[05:48] at times. And certain games are hit, certain games are a miss. You know, there's just,

[05:54] it just seems like the, like if I look at Star Wars, for example, the graphics on it just,

[05:59] they look really sort of old. They look like 1996 sort of, you know, Gateway Computer graphics.

[06:07] They need to go further with making the LCD programming as good as it could be considering. It's

[06:14] going to be 2018 in a week. But for the most part, for the most part, I think we all can consider

[06:20] the LCD screens and the new Stern machines as a win. Now, let's talk a little bit about the

[06:27] spike system and that being Stern's new sort of operating system for Pimbal. I have to say,

[06:36] I'd be concerned, I'd be concerned if I were buying new Stern machines about the long-term

[06:42] reliability of spike system and these node boards. And they're prone to fail over and over and over

[06:49] again. Like, you know, it's like, there's no fuses on these boards. The boards just blow. And I think

[06:54] that's, that's got to have a lot of people nervous about did Stern, you know, did they engineer

[07:00] these things too cheaply and not with long-term reliability in mind? And I know there's a lot of

[07:08] videos out there. There's a lot of people saying like, Stern node boards and this new Stern spike

[07:12] system is going to be a long-term nightmare. And if I were you and I own Stern Pimbal machines,

[07:19] I would stock up on replacement node boards for all of your games. I plan to do that for Batman.

[07:28] Okay, so the big, I think Stern's entire year. I think their entire year, sort of the center

[07:34] of gravity. The big moment for them was Star Wars. It is without a doubt the biggest theme in

[07:42] the entire world. We would just look at how the whole world is arguing back and forth about the

[07:47] merits of the last Jedi, right? And Star Wars Pimbal was probably the most anticipated Stern Pimbal

[07:56] machine of all time. I think the hype and the excitement around it was unparalleled, unparalleled.

[08:03] Distributors all over the country were sold out. They had so many people on a wait list to see it.

[08:10] We kept hearing it was two years in the making. Steve Richie, it was going to be the game that

[08:16] was going to be worth waiting for. And I have to say, I have to say, I get that Star Wars is fun.

[08:24] I still think Star Wars is one of the biggest misses in Pimbal history. And solely because of the

[08:31] source material and everything they had to work with to create that Star Wars universe under glass,

[08:39] to me is a big fat miss in this Pimbal machine. And look, I get it is fun. I get it is fast. I get

[08:47] it has flow. But you have to step back and put all of the elements of those movies we love. And then

[08:56] look down at that play field and tell me, tell me that that was worth two years of waiting to get

[09:04] that. I have nothing personal against Steve Richie. I think he designs games the way he wants to.

[09:12] I think he has ideas that he's been recycling for a long time. And I think it's time

[09:18] Stern found new blood to approach engineering these games because there was just nothing

[09:24] truly original or magical about Star Wars Pimbal. But look, if you own one and you're enjoying it,

[09:33] let me make a final point on Star Wars. If you own it and you enjoy it, that's all that

[09:38] freaking matters. I'm happy you do. So, Aerosmith is interesting, though, too, because

[09:44] Aerosmith is a beautiful game. I think people who own it have to be fans of Aerosmith, though.

[09:51] And that's the thing with all music pins. I've always felt that either you're a huge fan

[09:56] of the band or it's going to be really unlikely that people are just Lukewarm on it.

[10:03] We'll go in because the game is so good on a Pimbal level. I think ACDC has a broader,

[10:09] probably a broader fan base. Or it's just even a cooler band to have a Pimbal machine based on.

[10:14] And ACDC has a Pimbal machine has been celebrated. I've always found ACDC to be somewhat confusing

[10:22] and just too much going on. And it's kind of game where I really can't talk to it to Brenda or

[10:29] my casual friends and explain what they need to do and stacking this, stacking that and all that

[10:34] stacking. It's not for me, but I understand why people love it. The Vault Edition came out,

[10:41] Stern made some improvements to the lower play field. They made some additional improvements to

[10:46] the game. Not too many. I wish Stern would have made a new art package for ACDC Vault.

[10:54] I do think ACDC Vault Edition could have been more. You've got Dirty Donny, you've got Christopher

[11:01] Franchi, you've got Zombie Eddie on board, you've got ACDC that you're going to remake as a Vault

[11:07] Edition. And you could put a new art package on it to just drive some new excitement, right? And

[11:13] make like, we saw how people got excited with Lucy Edition. I think they could have gone much

[11:18] further to sort of make, to sort of, to me, a Vault Edition is like a farewell. It's like a

[11:25] final swan song for a theme. And I think when you vault, I think you should make it special. I think

[11:31] you should take it up a notch and sort of improve upon the design as much as possible. And the art

[11:37] package can easily be improved upon when you look at the art package on that premium. So,

[11:43] you know, then we got, we got Guardians of the Galaxy. So Stern's year, we're crashing into

[11:52] Guardians of the Galaxy. It just came out. The code is at .81. It's another game. It's another

[12:00] game that Stern released in this sort of weird way. It wasn't ready for release. They released it

[12:05] anyway. It had really bad code at the beginning. All right, who cares, right? Like a month or two

[12:12] later, who cares? If you buy the machine now, you're going to get much better code. The game is

[12:18] going to be there. I think Guardians of the Galaxy and I'm not being down on it. I need to play it.

[12:24] I haven't played anything other than a pro. I think that this is going to be a game that

[12:32] is not going to become one of those highly desirable titles. I think the theme does not appeal

[12:41] as well to pinball collectors and pinball fans as well as Star Wars, Batman, Ghostbusters,

[12:50] ACDC. So stuff like that, I think, is going to pull people in more emotionally. I also think,

[12:58] you know, the whole inability to get actors from the movie, to have to do voice overs on the film

[13:06] scenes in the game. I think integration issues are going to continue to be a red flag for people

[13:13] as they look to spend this kind of money on pinball. I think Stern is learning. I think

[13:19] Stern is learning that you know what? If we can't really theme integrate the right way,

[13:25] maybe it's not worth going after these newer properties, especially if those newer properties don't

[13:31] even have the sort of the fan base or the nostalgia associated with it. I'm going to do another

[13:38] podcast about my predictions for 2018. But if we look at a title like maybe Jurassic World coming out,

[13:44] can you imagine Jurassic World where you're not going to get Chris Pratt to be doing the voice overs

[13:50] or doing the call outs? You got it. You got to get him. You got to pony up the money. And I think

[13:55] with the amount of money, people are spending on these machines and the millions of dollars at

[14:00] stake, getting someone to do voice over work for a day, maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars,

[14:06] maybe a hundred thousand dollars. And that's for the AAA talent. If you're just going for

[14:13] someone else in the film who's recognizable, nowhere near that much money. And I think people

[14:18] are going to want to see that because if you look at Batman 66, I think the people why owners of

[14:22] this game are really loving it is the theme integration is brilliant. The call outs are brilliant and

[14:29] it's only going to get better. And I say, if we look at Stern and we say what was the greatest

[14:35] Stern title right now as of December, what is it? 29th. I think the best game that Stern put out

[14:45] last year right now is Batman. And I'm not just saying that because I own it. Maybe I am saying

[14:53] that because I own it. But to me, Batman is the one that integrates the theme the best, that has

[15:00] the best sort of I think coder in the business making it. Lyman is going to make the game so awesome.

[15:09] I think Batman is fun because it appeals to both the casual player and the diehard.

[15:15] Because Lyman knows how to make a game approachable but also with depth. When I walk up the

[15:20] Star Wars, it is completely a complex code it mess to me. It's like learning chess. You just can't

[15:29] figure it out. There's so much going on with multipliers and stacking and I just don't feel like

[15:35] I am progressing through the three Star Wars movies that I love so much where when I play Batman,

[15:41] I totally feel like I'm Batman putting the different villains in jail. I love the way the music

[15:47] changes with each mode. I love the way you stack all the villains at the end of capturing them all.

[15:53] I love the mini villain modes. It's all coming together beautifully. And so that is why my pick for

[15:59] best Stern is Batman 66. All right, but overall overall, I think it was a little bit of a mixed

[16:06] bag year first, and I think they are learning that people are not going to run and buy these games

[16:13] when the code is so incomplete. I also think they are learning that theme integration is super

[16:18] important for the price they're charging. I also think they're learning that the limited edition

[16:25] number is important to get right. And I think they've been off on it, especially with Guardians

[16:33] of the Galaxy. 600 of them was way too many. And I also think recycling WWE armor on Guardians of

[16:42] the Galaxy moves like that. When they make moves that are clearly and visibly cheap, it will come

[16:51] back to bite Stern. And I think they understand that. And I think we're not going to see more of that

[16:55] shenanigans as we go into 2018. All right, but Stern's still dominating by far. I love the fact

[17:03] that if you want a new pinball machine, Stern's got a bunch of them that you can go get new in box

[17:08] tomorrow. Let's talk about Jersey Jack Pimball and the kind of year Jersey Jack Pimball had. So Jersey

[17:14] Jack, interesting year for them because they had dialed in. Pat Lawler's return to Pimball

[17:23] was shipping in 2017. And dialed in, I think is one of the greatest sort of pinball machines on a

[17:32] pinball level that I've ever played. There's no arguing that that game gives you so much for your

[17:39] money that there's so much going on in it. There's great mechs. There's great magnets. There's great

[17:45] shots. There's great flow. There's great LCD integration. Everything about dialed in on a pinball

[17:52] level is absolutely phenomenal. And are we surprised? It comes from probably one of the, if not,

[18:00] the greatest pinball designer on the planet. And the problem is you add up all of the pinball

[18:08] greatness that is dialed in. But the theme and the call outs anchor that game down. And that is the

[18:19] issue that I think plagues dialed in is that there's something about the game that when you play it,

[18:27] you enjoy it, but it just doesn't push you over to that level where you're laughing out loud,

[18:35] or you're really feeling the personality of the machine. I think that's the best way to put it.

[18:39] It's almost like it's too much pinball and not enough personality. And they need to dial up

[18:46] the personality. Now the good news is they could change a lot of that as dialed in begins to publish

[18:52] itself adding in more personality into the call outs and into the game and getting your sort of

[18:59] adrenaline going and getting the humor dialed up. I think that would make dialed in a long term

[19:06] classic for people. But what was confusing about Jersey Jax year for me is as dialed in with selling,

[19:15] they go and announce pirates of the Caribbean at Expo. And by doing that, they've sort of created

[19:24] this, I think they have to have created somewhat of a hesitation or a stall on which Jersey Jax

[19:31] machine to buy. Should I buy a dialed in or should I wait for pirates of the Caribbean?

[19:36] Now, look, I think Jersey Jax pinball machines are by far a level above stern machines. There's

[19:45] no denying it. I know Jack, I know Jen, I know the people over there, they're putting a lot more

[19:54] than anyone into pinball machines in 2017. They are the modern version of Valley Williams.

[20:01] And pirates of the Caribbean, when they revealed it, was like a wow moment. I don't think I've

[20:07] ever seen a pinball machine be so universally applauded for having so much cool stuff in it.

[20:16] And I think it's not, you know, I think it's easy to understand why you juxtapose the stuff that

[20:21] Jersey Jax puts into a game versus the stuff that Stern puts into a game. And then you say,

[20:28] well, these are both Ellie's. Look at Star Wars Ellie next to Pirates of the Caribbean Ellie.

[20:34] And you tell me which one is attempting to give you the most it can under glass. Okay. Now,

[20:42] here's, and here's a thing. And this is going to be an interesting, I don't know, I think Jack,

[20:49] I'm trying to be like nice and honest at the same time. I think so much effort went into stuff.

[20:57] But I think Jack keeps missing on theme. And I think theme is the final frontier for Jersey

[21:04] Jax pinball. When they finally get the theme to click with the kind of pinball we know they can make,

[21:11] then Jack's going to see the debt water shed moment, that moment in his company when the

[21:18] orders don't start to peter out at like a thousand or two, or like it's going to excel and

[21:24] sell strong for years. I'm probably right when I say that Wizard of Oz is probably still his best

[21:32] selling pin by far. And the reason why is a timeless theme that everyone can relate to and has

[21:40] mass appeal across generations. Dildin has comes with absolutely zero fan base. So you're really

[21:48] only going after Pat Lawler fans. And Pat Lawler fans are just maybe like a couple thousand,

[21:56] where Wizard of Oz fans could be in the millions. The Hobbit as we all know, the movies didn't do well,

[22:03] the movies aren't, people don't collect stuff around the Hobbit. It just, the movies fail to

[22:08] deliver. And Jack didn't know that. Jack got the license before he realized that the movies weren't

[22:14] going to be home runs. Now you could argue that why then why give this new young engineer the

[22:23] gold and put all this put all the blood sweat and tears into engineering a beautiful game. But then

[22:30] wrap it up in the theme of pirates of the Caribbean, which is a theme that has already been made.

[22:36] It's not a movie franchise that people are currently in love with. It's actually sort of long

[22:42] winded it right now. Johnny Depp is like a social outcast. And then on top of it all, you can't even

[22:48] integrate that theme into the pinball machine with the theme song with it. This and that. And that

[22:54] has become also part of Jersey Jack's story for 2017. It feels like he's getting the cadence right.

[23:03] But one game is always stepping on the foot of another game. And I don't think it makes any

[23:10] marketing sense to have people basically pause on buying the only new game you have to wait for

[23:20] the next new game. Because the issue now for Jack is I know people, a lot of people that are

[23:26] also even saying, well, I'm not even going to buy pirates because I'm going to get toy story.

[23:31] And so he's sort of create this climate where you're always sort of waiting for the next Jersey

[23:36] Jack machine because I think people are just waiting to fall in love to really fall in love

[23:44] with the Jersey Jack machine that gets the theme and the pinball game right. And I don't think

[23:48] we're there yet. And I'm not sure pirates will take people there. I really, I have a hard time

[23:56] believing it. If Pirates of the Caribbean comes out and it's it's it's it's it's amazingly engineered by

[24:02] Eric, which we know it is. And then Stern is like, Oh, here's jaws. Tell me tell me which direction

[24:09] the money goes. And that's the thing. That's the thing. And I look I want Jack to hit it out of the

[24:15] park. And I look forward to playing pirates. I'm still in on my pirates deposit. I we've only seen

[24:20] 20% of the code. So there's a long way to go. But I'm wondering if they can get the magic there

[24:25] knowing the hurdles they have with the theme integration. So we'll see what happens there.

[24:29] But overall overall for Jersey Jack pinball a good year. I'll tell you why it's a good year.

[24:35] They're still in business. And they have the right investor backing them. And they're they have

[24:41] a cadence of games now. Like I think we have to stand up and applaud and bow Jersey Jack for saying

[24:48] he's going to deliver dialed in at a certain time of year. And he did it. He hit his mark. The games

[24:54] are out. People are playing them. The first two title people waited for years to get those games.

[25:00] Jack got dialed into people when they when they when they said they would get them. And I think for

[25:05] that we have to consider 2017 as a major turning point for the positive for Jersey Jack pinball. So

[25:12] Jack and team congrats on that. I think you guys are headed in the right direction. Now just get

[25:17] the themes where they need to be. All right. Let's go into Chicago gaming. Chicago gaming very

[25:23] interesting. So I think Chicago gaming has probably one of the hottest games of the year. I think

[25:28] attack from Mars remake definitely could be considered also the best bang for the buck pinball

[25:34] machine of 2017. It's not an original title. So I always consider remakes to be a little bit

[25:42] cheating in terms of of making a game that sells well or excites people because you you already know

[25:48] it excites people and it's a game people love that being said. I see nothing but positive

[25:54] and excitement happening from people who are buying attack from Mars remake L.E.s. I remember

[26:01] the initial bitching about the green armor when the game was revealed. I see more people buying

[26:06] the green and the green looks incredible. I know there are some mechanical issues with the game

[26:12] that people are having. There's some some issue with the skill shot. The ball doesn't go all the

[26:16] way around. There's issues with the top er people are having where it doesn't really come with

[26:21] any instructions on how to hook the top er up and not all of them are fully functioning. I think

[26:26] there's something with like shooter lane ejectors and all this stuff. Look there are going to be some

[26:31] issues. There's going to be some issues. If you think that Chicago gaming manufacturing their first

[26:37] pinball machine is going to get it perfect out of the gate. I think you're fooling yourself. I think

[26:42] for the most part though they've done a great job. I think they've won the skeptics over when it

[26:48] comes to remakes. The new display they have. The new sound in the game. The top er it's a better

[26:56] package than the original and I think the diehards who are who want to try and pretend that the

[27:04] originals are going to be more desirable in the future. They're just fooling themselves and

[27:09] there's no greater sign of that than all the people right now that are trying to bail on their

[27:14] monster bashes. It's a fire sale for monster bash. That was the other big moment in 2017 for

[27:22] Chicago gaming was them prematurely announcing the titles they're going to remake. They didn't

[27:30] have to do this. They didn't have to come out and say hey look speculation aside we're remaking

[27:36] monster bash cactus canyon theater of magic and big bang bar so if you own those four titles

[27:44] you have to have to realize your games just lost a lot of value maybe not all of them right

[27:52] you know games like theater of magic and this and that I mean look theater of magic with a modern

[27:58] display and a topper and a better sound and maybe they might even add some code updates to some of

[28:05] these games like cactus canyon. You know brand new toy box you know they got the magic box brand

[28:11] new everything in it brand new plastics brand new play field brand new lighting better lighting

[28:17] why would you want the old one why would you want the old one you know so that's just really

[28:24] uh if I'm stern if if I'm stern these guys these are the guys I'm worried about. I think Chicago

[28:32] gaming is going to have an amazing year. I think monster bash is going to blow people away and sell

[28:39] out like hotcakes. I think Chicago gaming you know is doing something that as a collector I'm like

[28:49] you know they're kind of like ruining the rarity and the desirability and and and this whole sort of

[28:56] uh you know maybe a little bit the specialness of tracking down a good condition version of

[29:02] a classic game that's amazing but I don't think people care. I really don't. I think people are

[29:09] happy. I think people are excited. I think what people are enjoying too is it's so much better

[29:16] and there's so much more peace of mind opening up a new inbox pinball machine that is sent to your

[29:22] door inside a cardboard box versus taking someone else's word for use machine and spending an

[29:29] arm and a leg to get it. You know a year ago you're and a half ago people are spending $12,500

[29:35] for a restored monster bash. Now you're going to be able to get like a new one for eight brand new

[29:40] everything and all these guys with their monster bash is not only that the game is going to be

[29:44] better the game is going to be better on every level and so I think 2017 was a huge year for

[29:52] Chicago gaming. I think 2018 and beyond is going to be ridiculously good for these guys and the

[29:58] fact that they're also talking about making original titles Chicago gaming to me they're going

[30:04] to be Stern's biggest competitor in a year. I think more than Jersey Jack I do. I think they have

[30:11] nothing but a roster of hits and I think they're going to keep cranking them out and if they can get

[30:15] if they imagine they can release two of those a year in in beautiful packages. I think they're

[30:21] going to see nothing but sales happen. All right let's go to spooky. What kind of year did

[30:27] spooky pinball had? So spooky pinball I think made one of the smartest decisions of any manufacturer

[30:33] this year and that was producing and manufacturing Scott Denise's total nuclear annihilation

[30:41] because spooky was heading in a pretty bad direction with Rob Zombie and I'll say why? Rob Zombie

[30:50] is just a mediocre game and I think the consensus in the pinball world is that that spooky pinball

[31:00] is you know it's a small company they got things going by making a limited number of their first

[31:06] two titles and that limited nature is what drove people to buy the games but the games themselves

[31:12] they just weren't as good as a Stern pro and so a lot of people went in on Rob Zombie speculating

[31:19] that it would have a great resale value there would only be 300 it was truly limited and what happened

[31:25] Rob Zombie just sort of came out a lot of people dumped them because they realized there wasn't

[31:31] going to be money to be made on flipping any of those pinball machines you never even hear people

[31:36] talk about America's most haunted anymore you know spooky was sort of like in this position where

[31:42] they had four games that they had made all of them were kind of like eh to people who loved pinball

[31:49] America's most haunted Rob Zombie Jetsons and Dominoes four machines that if you love pinball and

[31:56] you're a pinball player you do look at those titles like it's just you know it's just the minor leagues

[32:02] like they haven't made a game that I think can hold its own in the major leagues of pinball okay

[32:09] so that's where spooky was income's Scott Denise brings this game total nuclear annihilation

[32:16] to different shows people love it people love it George Goldman says if there's any pinball

[32:20] machine he could buy he would buy that it's it's got a light show it's got sound it's a different

[32:25] take on pinball it's fast it's furious it's challenging it's easy to understand what to do you

[32:30] just got to blow up the reactors you do it over and over again but it gets harder and harder

[32:34] it's got an interesting ball lock it's got a light show like no other right it's just and

[32:39] Scott's like this great guy that that is like awesome to talk about like so everything about it

[32:44] like makes people feel good so spooky says look we're not we're not like people aren't at our booth

[32:51] like super excited like they're kind of crowding around Scott's game let's let's make it and I

[32:56] think it was a beautiful marriage and I think it's a great game and it's nothing personal against

[33:01] spooky I think it's a smart decision I spooky pinball is a pinball manufacturer they are learning

[33:07] how to make a great game they haven't made it yet they'll get there I'm fully confident they'll

[33:12] get there um total nuclear annihilation is a fun game I hear nothing but positive things from

[33:20] people who own the machine and I think why it's taken off and and and in terms of like you know

[33:26] within the hardcore collector community I think the reason why people love it is it breaks up

[33:31] them and not me it's not your traditional fan layout if you're good at pinball you're not going

[33:36] to sit on that machine and have a 25 minute ball like you're probably not going to do that there's

[33:41] nothing more boring in pinball than watching a good player get on a machine like spider man

[33:46] and sit on it for like a half hour of ball there's nothing more boring in pinball um and you know

[33:52] he teamed up with mad answers to do the art on the machine and it has like that retro vibe look

[33:58] again I'm gonna give you the pros and the cons I do think the art could have been so much sweeter

[34:02] but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter people are in on this game they loved it when it was a

[34:08] whitewood they loved it when there was no artwork so the art that's on it is suffice for what

[34:14] the game is all about and I'm glad to see it being successful you know I think when it's done

[34:20] when all is said and done I I think they will probably end up selling more total nuclear

[34:24] annihilations than rob zombies I think that's a great thing I think that Alice Cooper is a big

[34:31] moment as we go into 2018 for spooky but overall as a year as a year another positive year for

[34:37] spooky and I'll tell you why spooky pinball will always get an a rating for me because they never

[34:46] lose people's money they give people the product they pay for when they say they're gonna get it to

[34:52] you they're good people and and they're they're they're people of their word right and and I think

[35:00] they're the only ones they're the only boutique that did it right that built their company slowly

[35:07] and and bid off as much as they could chew and never made pinball consumers be their investors

[35:15] they invested in themselves and they invested in their capabilities and I think those

[35:20] capabilities will improve over time because they know they know they have to they know they have to

[35:25] it's a very crowded space and competition will force everybody to make their product better but

[35:32] it's Charlie spooky Scott guys congratulations I think on on a successful 2017 all right let's go

[35:41] on to this now see this is where we we hit a little bit of a a little bump in the road you gotta

[35:50] talk about highway pinball okay now no highway pinball what kind of 2017 had have they had they've

[35:58] had in a bismill nightmarish year there's no other way to slice and dice it and your highway the

[36:05] founder of the company was forced to step down from the company and the the investors the original

[36:12] investors and highway pinball who had already lost hundreds of thousands of dollars how to sink

[36:18] hundreds of thousands of dollars more into this company to try and salvage alien pinball there was

[36:25] a really good chance that everyone in on alien pinball was going to lose their money in 2017 a very

[36:32] very good chance of that happening the new investors are not the new investors but the new

[36:37] money that these investors have pumped in are the only chance people have of getting their games now

[36:43] look that's the that's like the first half of the year they came out in in with June July they

[36:51] said they were going to get things back on track it's been slow going it's been slow going here we

[36:55] are it's December 29th it's almost 2018 and I don't think a single Ellie has gone out the door

[37:05] so they are well behind schedule on where they want it to be they still have not given so many

[37:12] people their refunds it's clear they can't afford to do the refunds you know the story you

[37:18] know highway pinball isn't a bad place they're in a very bad place the games are shipping

[37:24] but the games have issues it's clear they're simply following through on on Andrew's design which

[37:32] had a lot of design issues and for those of you in on alien all I want to say is I hope you get your

[37:39] games and I hope you're satisfied with the game that arrives and I hope you have no issues with your

[37:45] games and that's it I really you know I think there's just a few companies that drag this hobby down

[37:53] I think there's just a few companies that suck the life out of pinball and they haven't done anything

[37:59] good for the hobby intentions mean nothing if you lose people's money okay let's go to the other

[38:07] company I want to get these out of the way because I don't want this to be a negative I think it's

[38:10] been a good year for pinball the other companies Dutch pinball these guys are sort of in a similar

[38:16] boat as highway in the sense that they're in trouble they're in trouble they've got people who

[38:22] want refunds who can't get their money back people went in on the game years ago the big Lebowski

[38:28] and we keep getting these weekly updates about trying to make the game in China we talked about them

[38:34] on the last episode 2017 was another abysmal year for the big Lebowski in the entire year of 2017

[38:42] not one big Lebowski pinball machine shipped from Dutch pinball to consumers a game hasn't shipped

[38:50] to consumers I I think since something like summer of 2016 so it's been an absolute nightmare for

[38:59] these guys about 50 games went out 40 games are still held hostage at a Ra and they have yet to

[39:06] figure out a way to really get the train back on the tracks for those of you who are in on the big

[39:13] Lebowski you probably have already considered the money gone you might have a little bit of hope

[39:21] left but you are not happy and it's moves like this it's companies like these that do make people

[39:29] want to get out of the hobby okay so 2017 was an abysmal year for Dutch pinball and I hope they can

[39:38] get it back on track but if you look at the whole situation I just don't know how you manufacture

[39:47] money I don't know how you get that lost money back I think they're going to take new money

[39:54] to pay for old orders and I think it's really hard for them to crawl out of the hole they're in

[40:00] we'll see what happens but I don't think you're going to see anything shipping anytime soon from

[40:05] from highway pinball all right let's turn the corner because it's more positive news let's go to

[40:11] American pinball and Houdini American pinball is on the eve of shipping Houdini Houdini was supposed

[40:18] to come out in December of this year I think when I talk to Josh Kugler he said we will definitely

[40:24] see it by the end of the year we haven't seen the machine by the end of the year doesn't matter

[40:29] absolutely not I'll tell you why because nobody paid in full everyone just has money at distributors

[40:36] it's refundable deposit they're taking a little bit extra time to get the game right can't blame

[40:41] them smart thing to do don't rush the game out until the code is far along you these guys know that

[40:48] they need people's first impressions of Houdini to be super positive they can't ship a game that

[40:53] has incomplete code or has mech issues or this or that they need to make sure this thing is out of

[41:00] the box as rock solid as it can be and they're working on it okay so 2017 for American pinball you

[41:08] know it's been an interesting year for them it's been an interesting year they you know Houdini

[41:13] it's a miracle how fast they've brought this game the other part of American pinball's year

[41:19] is also is the elimination of John Papaduke was it this year or last year it's hard to it's hard to

[41:23] even keep track of it all but they basically they got the magic girls out to people in incomplete

[41:30] form but as they said in their letter they built it to Zidware specifications I I'll never know

[41:38] I'll never know why Dovel or anyone would ever think working with John Papaduke would be a good

[41:43] idea or would have a positive outcome but they got rid of him they turned the corner on him they

[41:49] bit the bullet and kicked him out and I think because of that it's a long distant memory

[41:57] J. Popps association with American pinball it'll have no residual effect on them everyone's

[42:03] looking at this as a as a as a company with their inaugural title being Houdini and we look

[42:09] forward to seeing it ship so 2017's been a it's been a year of figuring out how to get Houdini out

[42:15] and I think we're going to see Houdini out very very soon and I'm I'm excited I think Houdini

[42:20] does give people a lot for the money I think it's it's good that they didn't do a pre-order model

[42:26] and I think for that we should applaud American pinball for doing it right and focusing on one

[42:31] title and making what I consider to be a pinball machine right they're not trying to reinvent

[42:37] everything they're not trying to redo it I think the things they have done in terms of where they

[42:41] place the LCD screen was very creative they have some really cool mix in the game you know but I

[42:47] think they they they went about it right just make a freaking good pinball machine and people will

[42:53] buy it don't have to reinvent pinball to get people to line up at your door all right speaking of

[43:00] reinventing pinball p3 multi-morphic is next on the list so here's the thing um I don't know how

[43:09] many multi-morphic p3 units have shipped I think it's just like 25 and I haven't really seen

[43:16] the thread anywhere on pinside and so I think you know if we're if we're looking at how are these

[43:21] companies doing in 2017 you know Jerry's shown this thing now for like five six years and to date

[43:32] I mean I have to feel like the platform's not taken off and he needs a title to get people to see

[43:41] the potential in the platform I would love to know how many are out there if you have one maybe

[43:47] come on the show tell me how it is playing the game are you are you enjoying it are you enjoying

[43:52] lexelite speed are you playing the games the side games or the the mini games that it comes with a lot

[43:58] what's it like owning a p3 I just again it's hard for me to like actually give much an opinion about

[44:04] p3 multi-morphic just because I don't see a lot of conversation happening around it I think there's

[44:09] so much else going on in pinball that this platform starting to be forgotten and I think he needs

[44:15] something to put it back on the map in 2018 all right let's go next to circus Maximus these next

[44:22] we're going to go pretty quickly so circus Maximus what have they done in 2017 absolutely nothing

[44:28] absolutely nothing the whole pinball circus the prototypes nothing haven't seen anything nothing

[44:35] they I think they took a huge break and then they're like we're putting our shirts back on okay so

[44:39] there was that they're also remaking kingpin and I think they redid the artwork on a translate that

[44:44] I think ah looks pretty bad but again circus Maximus to me is one of these boutiques that I would

[44:50] never give them money until I saw a final product so I think it's been a dead year for them

[44:57] and maybe they'll show something in 2018 but as far as I'm concerned there's just there's so many

[45:02] more real pinball companies making stuff that these guys that are on the fringes unless they have

[45:09] a finished game I would I would stay clear of them all right deep route what was deep route year

[45:17] like in 2017 a weird one right it it it was like they were like this unexpected entity that just

[45:25] popped up out of the blue because John pop it Duke was on their website they sort of they made a lot

[45:31] of weird decisions a lot of weird decisions they were trying to do a lot of sort of backdoor deals

[45:38] and behind the scenes deals with lawyers and owners of zidware games and then they just came out

[45:45] recently and put up a a website that was a whole bunch of legal speak about how they're they're

[45:52] going to handle zidware buyers and how they're going to make Ferraris for the price of kias and

[45:58] even though they've never made a pinball machine before they've figured out how to make amazing

[46:03] pinball games for cheap which is something no one else is able to figure out so a lot a lot of

[46:09] promises a lot of hot air a lot of ridiculousness from deeper at this year again like it's like

[46:20] giving airtime to these companies is sort of silly because they haven't really done anything

[46:25] all I know is this whenever you expect to work with jpop but get a positive outcome this time around

[46:34] I don't know how you expect that to be what happens I mean every time john touches something it just

[46:42] turns to mush and I just saw this past week john put up on his zidware page this like ridiculous

[46:49] statement about pinball and the spiritual journey it is between the ball and the 25 cents it's

[46:56] just a bunch of gobligook bullshit I mean it's like the guy needs help he really he's he's lost

[47:04] touch with reality and I thank frolic for reminding people how remember when john saw the big labowski

[47:12] craze and because of that bowling alley that john came up with that pussy cat doll bowling game and

[47:18] he actually had like zombie Eddie draw art for it and it's just like that's john pop a duke he sees

[47:24] a light and he moves in that direction he sees another light he moves in that direction he literally

[47:29] is just like just a mess he's a mess he can't and and the fact that deep root thinks they can focus him

[47:37] let's see if they can do it but we haven't seen anything in 2017 that that indicates that anything

[47:43] real is about to happen from these guys all right just a couple more skippy news uh here's here's

[47:49] a news in 2017 nobody's getting any money back except for Keith the lawyer if you bought a predator

[47:56] your money is all gone you have nobody to blame but helped in for keeping you in on predator when

[48:01] you could have got a refund blame him your money's gone all right let's talk about the last company

[48:07] home pin I left them last because they are least in my book of companies that made good moves in

[48:14] 2017 uh Mike stuck his foot in his mouth multiple times with his anti-American sort of racist comments

[48:24] socially unacceptable commentary about certain individuals and in in lifestyles he then goes off he

[48:32] he jumped into like all these other manufacturer threads and talk smack all the time he then has his

[48:37] chance to show his game thunderbirds and it looks like a leftover throwaway game from the Sega

[48:44] data east era pinball good job Mike spending all this time and investing all this money and making

[48:51] a pinball machine and you you fail to deliver I think 2017 was a year where home pin did nothing

[48:57] but turned people off to the company I don't think anything Mike has said or anything he has shown

[49:03] has made people feel excited to go in on thunderbirds pinball all right so that's it that's it that is

[49:12] me going down an exhaustive list of the different manufacturers in pinball in 2017 okay

[49:21] oh where are we at now we're at like oh we're at the 50 minute mark all right you know what we're

[49:24] going to do I am going to do my top 10 things that I think I've learned in this hobby over the past

[49:33] year and over the past couple years I will save my 2018 predictions for next episode I will also

[49:41] save my trippy awards for next episode as well we'll get to it okay now here's what I want to say

[49:49] ultimately ultimately if you only see the bad in the hobby it's time to get out if you are a

[49:57] person who goes on to pinside and is always complaining about pinball and and you you really are always

[50:02] angry it's time to let go of pinball okay these aren't my top 10 yet you know I'll start

[50:08] numbering them but that is how I feel about this hobby I've been in a place in pinball where it's

[50:13] sucked I own a magic girl wasn't working it was my only pin I was frustrated I used to be the

[50:18] troll on pinside that would just like be a cry baby about games I would never even own if you're

[50:25] like that if you're that guy it's time to just call it quits it's it's there's no point why do you

[50:32] want to wake up every day and allow something as silly as pinball to stress you out okay if you're

[50:37] also one of these people that only sees the good in pinball every pinball is good pinball every

[50:43] pinball company is great pinball company I think you also need a little bit of a reality check

[50:48] because we all shouldn't just be blindly cheerleading everybody because people who did that

[50:55] they made people lose a lot of money and there's a lot of companies in this hobby that have no

[51:00] business even being in business let alone trying to make a very complex game like a pinball machine

[51:06] so I think everyone out there needs to learn how to enjoy the hobby but also be a realist and don't

[51:12] be a fool and for for the love of god cherish the hardworking money that is in your wallet don't

[51:18] just give it away freely because of someone's pinball intentions okay so there's equally as much

[51:24] to love about pinball right now as there is to be concerned about and I can't tell you how to

[51:31] feel about it okay but I've learned a lot over the past few years and I want to share with you some

[51:35] advice okay these are canadas top 10 things I've learned in pinball that if if you all adhere to

[51:43] these I think you'd enjoy this hobby as much as as you can all right so number one never buy a

[51:51] game before playing it if if I could give any piece of advice this would be it never buy a game

[51:58] before you play it there is so much about a pinball machine that can turn us on or turn us off

[52:05] there's there a game could might not look in the part but could be fun as hell to play

[52:11] and there might be a game that everyone loves but you get on it and you don't like it at all

[52:16] we're all different we all will respond to a pinball machine differently

[52:20] some people like flow some people like games where they're trapping the ball more some people

[52:25] like magnets some people hate them some people like ramps some people don't you know each their own

[52:31] so make sure before you buy anything play it play it number two if you buy a game before the code

[52:40] is done it's your fault not the manufacturers okay because that also means you didn't play the

[52:51] game before you bought it when I keep reading about people going in on games buying them opening up

[52:57] the box and then complaining about the lack of code those people have nobody to blame by themselves

[53:03] right you shouldn't buy something until it's complete or near complete the days of being the beta

[53:09] tester guinea pigs for pinball it's coming to an end and it should come to an end because

[53:14] it's absolutely ridiculous there is nothing else in our lives where we buy something and it

[53:19] doesn't work right out of the box do I buy a coffee machine and it's like oh it doesn't it doesn't

[53:24] heat up the water yet but it will in six months do I buy a car and it doesn't come with a steering

[53:29] wheel but it will in three months anything you buy do I buy a jacket and it only has one sleeve well

[53:34] the second sleeve is going to be ready chrysanan in nine months absolutely stupid that people spend

[53:39] this kind of money on stuff that doesn't function properly all right number three only pay

[53:45] when your game is inside a box almost every pre-order model out there has burns people so don't

[53:53] ever buy something unless it's in a box and can be shipped to you immediately number four

[53:59] all pinball shots will get old but a theme you love will last forever okay just remember that

[54:10] when when deciding what to buy when deciding where to put your money every game's going to get old

[54:16] at some point but it never gets old for people to look at a theme they love and to hear the theme

[54:21] song of maybe Batman or Star Wars or Indiana Jones theme is so important in pinball I can't

[54:30] underscore that enough you will want to own the theme that makes you smile even when the game is

[54:37] off all right number number five never buy any machine to impress anyone else but yourself

[54:46] and I felt victim to this other people fall victim to this don't chase stuff that you think collectors

[54:53] will be impressed by don't just buy a bunch of new inbox games because you want to have a big

[54:58] collection thinking other collectors are gonna be impressed by how many games you have only buy a

[55:04] machine if it really personally makes you happy and is what makes you know is not there to show off

[55:14] and I know that's always hard because a lot of what drives collectors and drives forums is here look

[55:20] at what I have look at all my games look at this look at that so you know as long as you're content

[55:27] and look you might be content with one game the way I am right now or you might be content with

[55:32] 150 games the way Rotor-Dave is I can't tell you how many is your level of contentment

[55:39] but just do it for yourself is what I'm saying don't do it for other people

[55:43] number six do the opposite of what Hilton says if you do that if you just listen to whatever he says

[55:51] and do the opposite you will be very happy you will be making the right decisions in timble

[55:58] number seven without stern this hobby would be dead so give them a break on some level I get it

[56:08] there is so much stern vash that happens on a weekly basis but without stern pinball and without

[56:14] those hundreds of people every day who wake up to make pinball machines in stern factory there

[56:21] wouldn't be a pinside there wouldn't be a jersey jack there wouldn't be Chicago gaming there

[56:26] would be nobody this hobby would be dead and stern pinball has its faults but stern pinball also

[56:33] makes some of the best pinball out there and I think everyone out there gives them more of a hard

[56:38] time than they deserve because remember when stern ships thousands of games yeah 50 people might

[56:46] get some lemons when highway pinball ships only 50 aliens and 20 of them are lemons think about

[56:54] that for a minute think about that all right number eight not all pinball is good pinball

[57:02] some of these companies will lose your money and that's money that you could have taken your

[57:08] family on an unforgettable vacation it's money you could have invested in other things it's money

[57:15] you could have put into your kids college fun whatever I think there are companies in pinball

[57:22] that are nefarious that have no business being in pinball that started pinball companies without a

[57:29] real plan in place and they didn't know what they were doing they scaled up too big they lied to you

[57:37] a lot of the companies that are failing now if you go back and look at their histories they are

[57:43] where they are because they lied to consumers they lied to their investors they set false expectations

[57:51] about how many games they could make when they could make those games and the problem with the pinball

[57:56] community is a lot of you out there decide it not to listen to those lives you just forgave

[58:03] these people time and time again you drove me off a pinside and Andrew highway still has an account

[58:11] think about that for a minute all right number nine 99 percent of players will never get to a

[58:18] wizard mode if you can't enjoy a game without one something is wrong with you let's stop with the

[58:26] nonsense games should be fun in the first 20 seconds you don't have to get to some incredible

[58:33] to reach mode to make a game a keeper if you if you know if you're one of those guys it has to

[58:38] sell a game once you beat it god bless you you're going to be losing a lot of money if that's how

[58:44] you enjoy pinball all right and number 10 number 10 is my ultimate sort of understamin of this hobby

[58:54] owning more games equals more headaches remember you can only play one game at a time I think it's

[59:02] better to own a game explore it beat it and then move on to the next versus hoarding tons of

[59:09] pinball machines because in the end every game will get old and so will we and our love of

[59:16] fair with everything it weans over time these are just toys and I think that's my ultimate advice

[59:24] as and when I when I got to that place where I just don't care about chasing after every new game

[59:31] or or finding a space that's big enough to house all my machines and you know when I see people's

[59:36] homes and there's like pinball machines in front of windows that's number 11 never put pinball

[59:42] machines in front of windows or blocking doorways or it looks stupid it doesn't matter if you

[59:49] have a curtain behind it it looks terrible just from a zen aesthetic Feng Shui never put a pinball

[59:58] machine or any piece of furniture in front of a window you would never put an arm-worn front of a

[01:00:05] window but that's what this hobby does it makes people think they need to find more room and I'm

[01:00:12] saying piece of mind and happiness it is when you get rid of having too many machines in a room

[01:00:20] and you have just the right amount of pinball machines in a room my room looks great I love it I have

[01:00:26] one machine and I'm happy all right in the end ladies and gentlemen we are at the end of a pinball

[01:00:33] it's just pinball it's not meant to be nor should it ever be the center of anyone's life on a

[01:00:40] daily basis unless it's your job unless your job is to make pinball machines I get it but too many

[01:00:47] guys are on their computers all day long while they're at their job on pinside too many guys are on

[01:00:54] the forums when they're at home when they should be doing other things pinball is a lot of fun it's

[01:01:00] fun to turn on a pinball machine it's fun to go to tournaments for a lot of you guys but when

[01:01:04] it becomes too much the center of your universe you start to get jaded and you start to put an

[01:01:10] unrealistic importance on this box of blinking lights take care of yourselves in 2018 a lot of

[01:01:20] people use like the New Year's resolution to eat better to work out I implore all of you as I've

[01:01:26] said in the past you should spend more time at the gym than you do playing pinball how many of you

[01:01:33] do that because I want to see you guys around for many many many more years I want you guys to live

[01:01:40] long enough to see jaws super limited edition and our health and feeling good that's all that

[01:01:46] really matters in life way more than pinball so I'm wishing all of you out there a very happy and

[01:01:53] healthy new year I think all of you who listen to this show on a weekly basis for tuning in without

[01:02:00] you without your support without your emails I don't know if I would do it it's it's always fun

[01:02:06] to see that no matter what I put up when I put up it there's usually over a thousand people that

[01:02:12] enjoy the show which is really cool I really appreciate that if you want to send me an email I'll

[01:02:18] read out the emails on the next show it's canada pinball at gmail.com but again have a happy and

[01:02:24] healthy new year be safe if you're gonna go out drinking make sure you have a designated driver don't

[01:02:30] do anything stupid I've had too many friends ruin their lives during New Year's Eve celebrations so

[01:02:36] be safe everybody we'll talk to you in 2018

[01:02:48] you
