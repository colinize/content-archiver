[00:00] You all have nobody to blame but yourselves.

[00:04] All these years you wanted to expand Pimbal.

[00:07] Bring in all your friends to Pimbal.

[00:09] Get them to see why you love Pimbal so much.

[00:13] So here we are, this is the result.

[00:15] You've brought in all these people with all this money, who now love Pimbal as much as

[00:20] you.

[00:21] And the Mandalorian.

[00:23] Brian Eddie.

[00:24] They now, your friends, not just you.

[00:27] They now want that Ellie just as much as you do.

[00:30] And so now, because of all the hype, all the momentum, all the manias surrounding the

[00:35] Mandalorian, what are we seeing?

[00:38] Prices are going through the roof before people have even seen the game.

[00:42] This game is sold out long before the game is even revealed.

[00:46] Stern knows what's going on.

[00:47] I was talking to George Gomez last night and he said, Chris, I'm so busy, the sales

[00:51] guys are going crazy and you're really going to love this game.

[00:56] So it's all your fault.

[00:58] You all wanted to expand Pimbal.

[01:00] This used to be a nice little hobby in which you could go get an Ellie, Tron for 5700

[01:05] bucks and it wasn't crazy.

[01:08] You invited everybody in.

[01:09] This is the expansion you wanted to see.

[01:12] So don't blame Canada because we are at a new dawn of Pimbal.

[01:18] The enthusiasm for this hobby has never been higher.

[01:21] And I love seeing.

[01:22] I love seeing this frenzy to get a Mandalorian Ellie and people are crying because they

[01:29] can't get on distra lists and they're realizing the ultimate thing in life is loyalty.

[01:35] These distributors are loyal to the customers that have been buying for years.

[01:40] So let's talk about Mandalorian mania that is sweeping the Pimbal nation this week and

[01:45] it's only going to get even more frenzy as we get to Tuesday's reveal.

[01:50] And Canada was right, May 11.

[01:53] Spot on right.

[01:55] Who's bringing you the news now?

[01:57] No tombstones, no drama, no interviewing other podcasters.

[02:01] We're just giving you the Pimbal information you want to hear.

[02:04] Let's kick it right now.

[02:08] Alright, so Mando Mania is here.

[02:13] There is no escaping it.

[02:14] There's no denying it.

[02:16] There's nothing you can do other than witness.

[02:19] What I said would be one of the biggest launches in the history of Pimbal and it's upon us.

[02:25] And because there's a few reasons why right now.

[02:27] And I know we haven't seen the game.

[02:29] But if you've been following this industry, not seeing the game doesn't matter.

[02:34] What matters is one thing and one thing only.

[02:39] Theme, theme, theme.

[02:41] The other thing that matters is scarcity.

[02:43] So you have those two things together.

[02:45] Human scarcity and you have a feeding frenzy.

[02:49] Now you add a third element in which is Brian Eddy.

[02:52] And let me list all of Brian Eddy's horrible games.

[02:56] And there's nothing on the list.

[02:58] So you put those three things together.

[03:00] And you have what is happening right now, which is a perfect storm.

[03:05] And I'm loving this.

[03:06] I love watching this.

[03:08] And I mean it when I said it at the beginning of the show.

[03:10] That all of you have nobody to blame but yourselves for what's happened to this hobby.

[03:15] I've all been saying for years we need to support Pimbal.

[03:18] We need to expand Pimbal.

[03:20] We need to get more people in the Pimbal for Pimbal to survive.

[03:22] And I've been telling you for years, Stern doesn't need your help to expand Pimbal.

[03:26] They're doing just fine.

[03:28] And now we have way more people who are in the Pimbal who have deep pockets who want the

[03:33] best version of every new release.

[03:36] And don't get me wrong.

[03:37] It's not just Mandalorian.

[03:39] Most of these L.E.'s have always been spoken for.

[03:43] Because most of these distributors have a long list of people who say to them, I will

[03:49] take every single L.E. that you have.

[03:53] I don't care what the theme is.

[03:55] And if you're on that list, then why would you ever get off that list?

[03:59] Because how many times did you lose money?

[04:02] You'll never really lose money if you're on the list for an L.E. unless the game is

[04:07] Black Knight.

[04:09] Unless the game is maybe Monsters.

[04:11] Unless the game is maybe, I don't know, Led Zeppelin, but those people don't even lose

[04:16] money the first week or month of having the game.

[04:19] Because someone will buy it for you at MSRP for the most part.

[04:22] But this new climate is different.

[04:25] The world has changed over the last year.

[04:29] And I've been saying it over the last six months or so that this industry is headed

[04:34] to the moon.

[04:36] And you might not like it.

[04:37] You might hate Canada for putting shows out there like the ADM show where I'm basically

[04:42] saying to people, if you're a small distributor, why would you give away something that the

[04:47] market value is way higher than $9,200?

[04:51] I already saw that Bettson, you know, Bettson, the big distributor who has games, who sells

[04:56] games for more than sticker, Bettson's price for the Mandalorian L.E. before it even comes

[05:02] out.

[05:03] But aside from them, their price is $13,000.

[05:09] So they're charging almost $4,000 over sticker on day one for the Mandalorian L.E.

[05:15] Now as I read Pinside and I see all these guys scrambling to get an L.E. who can't find

[05:20] one.

[05:21] Gentlemen who probably have expensive homes and expensive cars, you know what they're

[05:24] not used to hearing?

[05:26] No.

[05:27] Or no is the greatest motivator to get rich people to part with their money.

[05:34] They don't want to hear no.

[05:36] These men will pay the $13,000.

[05:39] That's what's going to happen.

[05:40] They will sell every single one at $13,000.

[05:44] And then the price will go up from $13,000.

[05:47] Now there are $750,000.

[05:50] You could probably think Canada.

[05:52] If you think about it, there was absolutely no buzz for this game until I'm going to

[05:57] buy it.

[05:58] I created it.

[05:59] You have to understand this.

[06:01] Nobody was talking about Mandalorian.

[06:04] Nobody confirmed it was Mandalorian and I am telling you right now.

[06:07] Canadian Spinball Podcast saw the press release of the Mandalorian and on the press release

[06:13] it said 600 L.E.

[06:16] Why did Stern bump that number up?

[06:19] Because of what we've been doing the last three weeks, it's created this frenzy and

[06:24] I love it.

[06:25] If you think I'm a jerk, call me a jerk.

[06:28] But I also just got you almost 50% more games.

[06:32] They put another 150 into circulation.

[06:36] Normally it's 500.

[06:37] So this is a 50% increase on the normal 500 L.E. number.

[06:42] But what are we learning here?

[06:44] Stern has 45 European distributors.

[06:47] 45.

[06:48] So the lot man of L.E.s with the amount of distributors out in the world is really

[06:53] still low.

[06:55] There are way more than 750 people globally who would love to have a Mandalorian L.E.

[07:03] pinball machine.

[07:04] If you're on the list and you're getting one, then congratulations.

[07:09] You're one of the lucky few.

[07:10] If you've been told by your distributor, sorry, but we're not going to have one for you,

[07:15] my condolences, but this is the new reality.

[07:18] This is what happens when a hobby like this explodes like this.

[07:23] When you sell 500 guns and roses, collectors additions in one hour at $12,500 and you sell

[07:31] out of all of those in one hour.

[07:34] People wake up.

[07:36] This is the new reality.

[07:37] They could have made 1,000 and sold them all out.

[07:40] They could have charged 15,000 and sold them all out.

[07:43] I'm even going to say it right now.

[07:45] If they charged 18,000 for those guns and roses machines, they would have sold every

[07:50] one.

[07:52] Every one.

[07:53] I know people think I'm a jerk for saying this, but you have to realize that this hobby

[07:59] is now in the collectible realm.

[08:02] This is now something that people collect like artwork, like watches, and like bottles of

[08:08] wine.

[08:09] And it's more fun than all of those things.

[08:12] That's the problem.

[08:13] Is the sky is the limit.

[08:14] The moon is the limit on where pinball pricing will go because these things are fun.

[08:19] This thing is fun.

[08:20] Is it more fun to own crypto or own a pinball machine?

[08:22] It's more fun to own a pinball machine.

[08:24] I'm sick of the crypto rides up and down.

[08:26] I know Dogecoin, 74 cents.

[08:27] My God, we all would have had the entire pinball world collection if we had just put money

[08:31] in Dogecoin two years ago.

[08:33] But I don't want to talk about crypto because it's so much silly.

[08:35] Here's what I want to talk about.

[08:36] I want to talk about the fact that Mando Mania is here and I have not seen this hype since

[08:40] the Ghostbusters.

[08:42] And I mean that.

[08:43] There's only one other game that had this kind of hype going into the reveal and that

[08:46] was Ghostbusters.

[08:48] And Ghostbusters, I believe, was $8,000.

[08:50] It obviously sold out immediately.

[08:52] And I think there are only 500 Ghostbusters.

[08:54] L.E.'s.

[08:55] Do I think 750 is too much?

[08:57] No, it's not.

[08:58] It's going to be almost impossible to get one at $9,200.

[09:02] If you have one and you're thinking of flipping it, congratulations.

[09:06] You'll be able to flip it.

[09:07] Do I think you'll be able to flip it on day one and week one?

[09:10] Absolutely.

[09:11] Now here's what I'm curious.

[09:13] Where will the price net out for the speculators of the Mandalorian L.E.?

[09:17] How much do you think it will be?

[09:18] It's only a Canadian Pimbal at gmail.com.

[09:20] Let me tell you where I think it's going to go.

[09:22] And I'm watching this community.

[09:23] I'm watching this hobby.

[09:24] I'm watching these people say, oh, I don't really need it.

[09:26] I'm good with a premium.

[09:27] Sure you are.

[09:28] Sure you are.

[09:29] No, you're not.

[09:30] No, you're not.

[09:31] For many of you out there who are getting rejected.

[09:33] And I mean this.

[09:34] For those of you out there who are getting rejected, you don't like to feel rejected.

[09:38] You don't like it.

[09:39] Think about it like this.

[09:40] This is a first world problem like no other.

[09:42] But think about how funny it is that someone won't take your $9,200 to buy a Pimbal

[09:47] machine.

[09:48] I'm not going to sell you one because we don't have one for you.

[09:51] But what do you mean?

[09:52] I've got $9,200.

[09:53] Think about it if you told all of your other friends out there.

[09:56] If you told people in the world, hey, I can't get the $9,200 Pimbal machine I want.

[10:00] They'd be like, you're a moron.

[10:02] But that's why I love this hobby.

[10:05] Because if you have been a part of this hobby for many years and you've been supporting

[10:09] your distributor, there's a good chance they're supporting you.

[10:13] But the a lot then is the issue.

[10:15] It doesn't matter if Zach Manie's an amazing guy.

[10:18] It doesn't matter how many fans he has.

[10:20] It doesn't matter how many customers he has.

[10:21] Zach Manie would like to have 10 times more at least and he's going to get the same thing

[10:25] with all these distributors.

[10:27] They would love to get way more than they're being allotted.

[10:31] And because you've been in with a distributor now, it doesn't really mean much anymore either.

[10:37] There's just not enough games to go around.

[10:40] Now it begs the question, should Stern sell the LEDs moving forward directly?

[10:46] Should everyone have a fair shot to get one?

[10:49] Via the internet.

[10:51] Like first come first serve sales of these games.

[10:54] That would cut out the distributors which they won't do because here's the other thing

[10:58] I'm hearing.

[10:59] To get a Stern LED now, it's very much like the Beatles diamond.

[11:04] To get a Stern LED allotted to you, you have to agree to buy a certain number of

[11:10] pro and premium machines.

[11:13] This is why the LEDs exist people.

[11:15] They don't exist to make Stern money only on the LEDs which they are making a handsome

[11:20] amount on each one.

[11:22] These LEDs exist to get distributors to commit to buying the pros and premiums of these

[11:28] machines.

[11:29] So let's say you've got to buy 10 premiums and 10 pros to get one LED.

[11:34] And these distributors have to buy these games.

[11:37] Remember that.

[11:38] You have to buy them.

[11:39] It becomes inventory for these distributors and Stern is paid.

[11:44] This is the genius of Stern Pimbal.

[11:46] This is why Stern Pimbal clobbers everybody.

[11:50] They're not just smart with the themes they choose.

[11:53] Look at how their sales works.

[11:56] For every LED distributors have to commit to other product.

[12:00] And it's sold through.

[12:01] It's sold through.

[12:02] So that means every time they announce an LED there's millions of dollars that these

[12:07] distributors have to commit to Stern.

[12:09] And Stern can't lose money because you have to now commit to Stern.

[12:14] If you want to get the future LEDs that will be coming from this company and let me tell

[12:18] you, if what's been in the rumor mill and what I've been hearing from people that have

[12:23] seen behind the curtain over at Stern Pimbal, this is just the beginning of a new found

[12:30] Stern Mania that is going to sweep over Pimbal.

[12:33] And if you're American Pimbal.

[12:35] If you're Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[12:36] If you're Chicago gaming company.

[12:38] If you're deep root.

[12:39] If you're spooky.

[12:41] It's going to get a lot harder.

[12:43] They're not going to stop coming with this stuff.

[12:46] They're going to improve their mechanical stuff.

[12:48] They're going to get more engineers in there.

[12:50] I've heard that the stuff they've seen in the studio.

[12:52] This is people who have played these games.

[12:54] The stuff that's in the studio is stuff like they've never seen Stern do before.

[12:58] So I'm super excited.

[12:59] I know George Gomez is excited.

[13:01] I know all of you are excited.

[13:03] This is what we want.

[13:04] This is why you want to turn on a Pimbal podcast.

[13:07] And here me be excited about what's coming from all these companies.

[13:10] This is when it gets interesting.

[13:12] It's been like slow motion out there in the Pimbal podcasting world.

[13:15] It's like when will people just step out of interviewing each other?

[13:19] I told Ed Robertson.

[13:20] Really another hour and a half show.

[13:21] Ed great.

[13:22] What a cliche.

[13:23] More talk.

[13:24] More talk.

[13:25] You want news.

[13:26] You want rumors.

[13:27] And you're going to get it here.

[13:28] Next week I'm going to tell you about American Pimbal's launch plans.

[13:30] Like when they plan to launch their games.

[13:32] I'm going to tell you about a Christopher Franchi rumor about a title he's working on.

[13:35] And where he's working on that title, which is going to be really interesting.

[13:39] I'm going to give you the news rumors and speculations because that's what's exciting.

[13:42] But let's get back to Mando madness.

[13:44] So Mando madness is here.

[13:46] So where do I think this price is going to net out on a second hand Mandalorian elite?

[13:49] I'll tell you right now.

[13:51] I think these games are going to trade between 13 and 15 thousand dollars pretty immediately.

[13:56] And I think people who spend that are going to be fine with it.

[13:59] And I think people who sell it are going to be happy.

[14:01] And you're never going to be able to end speculation on these games.

[14:04] You can't stop people from flipping even if Stern were to sell directly.

[14:09] It still couldn't prevent anybody from buying one and selling it.

[14:12] Look, we can't shut that down.

[14:14] It's inevitable.

[14:15] It is inevitable.

[14:16] The only way it would stop speculating is if the manufacturers continue to drive their

[14:22] prices up and Stern's done this.

[14:24] Stern L. Lee's used to be five to six thousand dollars sixty five hundred bucks.

[14:28] They just kept inching up seven grand eight grand nine grand.

[14:31] They kept baking in the flip price into the game.

[14:35] But now they're learning that that's not even nearly the top right.

[14:39] So Batman's SLE at fifteen thousand dollars.

[14:42] They could have charged twenty.

[14:43] It doesn't matter.

[14:44] It doesn't matter as long as there are way more people who want these games than games

[14:50] available.

[14:51] Then it's going to be hard to get one and money's going to talk.

[14:55] And all the people crying and moaning are going to have to walk with their hands and their

[14:58] pockets and be dejected.

[15:00] Now I know for a lot of you out there, I want to say this, a lot of you out there are

[15:03] going to get rejected.

[15:05] And a lot of you out there are very frustrated with your distributors.

[15:08] And a lot of distributors who are my friends are also very frustrated because they have to

[15:13] tell more people that they're not going to get one.

[15:17] And I know distributors don't want to do that.

[15:19] They don't want to be bad people.

[15:21] It's like telling people, oh, your kid can't come to our school.

[15:25] You know, we're full on the enrollment.

[15:28] And that's what it feels like for a lot of these distributors.

[15:31] And it bums them out.

[15:32] And it bums out their customers.

[15:33] And it's not why they're in business.

[15:35] They're in business to make people happy.

[15:37] They want you to have the game that you want to have.

[15:40] Problem is everybody wants that best car steel armor.

[15:43] Everyone's going to want to have that best car steel, Ellie version of the game.

[15:47] And there's only 715 in the world.

[15:49] And you start to slice and dice it amongst Europe and the US and Australia and all of

[15:53] the sudden there's not many.

[15:54] So prices will continue to go through the roof.

[15:56] Now what do I think is a solution to this?

[15:58] There is no solution.

[15:59] Here's why I'm excited.

[16:00] Here's why I don't really care that these prices are going through the roof.

[16:03] Because prices only go through the roof when it's games that people want.

[16:08] Let me repeat that.

[16:09] The only reason we're seeing prices skyrocket is because people are enthusiastic about

[16:13] these themes.

[16:14] That's what we want people.

[16:16] I don't want more dud themes.

[16:17] I don't want more lame themes.

[16:19] I don't want more like two old-cremogen themes.

[16:21] I don't want more like old classic rock.

[16:23] I want themes like this.

[16:25] I want games that before they're even revealed, everybody wants it.

[16:30] Isn't that what we've always wanted from pinball?

[16:32] The matrix would be sold out, site unseen.

[16:35] Back to the future, site unseen.

[16:37] Right?

[16:38] There's so many things that if we got them, Big Trouble and Little China is another one.

[16:41] I'm telling you, it is.

[16:43] It is Big Trouble and Little China would do the same thing.

[16:47] People just want the right kind of theme for a pinball machine.

[16:51] And if you don't think that's the case, I really don't know what to tell you.

[16:53] You know, it's funny to me because when stuff like this happens, and this is really what

[16:58] is keeping pinball alive, this kind of enthusiasm and energy for new and box pinball machines,

[17:03] I love it because this is the ultimate divide.

[17:05] This is where the collectors are going crazy.

[17:07] And the tournament players, like the guys who are obsessed with gameplay, they're like,

[17:11] this is so stupid.

[17:13] We haven't even seen it flip.

[17:15] What if there's no flow?

[17:17] What if the code is terrible?

[17:18] What if this?

[17:19] What if that?

[17:20] What if it's not even fun to flip?

[17:21] And I'm here to tell you right now.

[17:23] If you're not wrong, you're not wrong in saying these collectors are being pretty stupid.

[17:27] And who knows, this game could be a turd.

[17:29] So let's talk about what we think could be the Achilles heel of this game.

[17:32] I think the number one thing we all agree could be the Achilles heel of the Mandalorian

[17:38] is the code.

[17:39] And if Lonnie is doing the code, there is a big question mark over this game.

[17:44] Is he going to do it where it's like interesting?

[17:46] If it's deep, is he going to integrate the theme the right way?

[17:49] Hopefully he doesn't mash it up the way Dwight mashed up the original trilogy.

[17:53] I'm still devastated by how stern butchered the original Star Wars trilogy.

[17:58] Unbelievable.

[17:59] So is Lonnie going to be the hero and the savior of this game?

[18:04] Or is he going to be the executioner of the Mandalorian enthusiasm?

[18:08] I don't know yet.

[18:10] Is it just going to be like start mode, shoot the same shots twice, and then progress

[18:14] through the mode and that's it?

[18:15] I don't know.

[18:16] We'll see what he does.

[18:17] And is he even the coder?

[18:19] He might not even be Lonnie.

[18:21] That's what I'm hearing.

[18:22] It kind of makes sense.

[18:23] He did stranger things with Brian Eddie.

[18:25] They've worked together before.

[18:27] And I've heard that the stranger things code now is really good.

[18:32] I haven't played one now.

[18:35] Stranger things is starting to turn the corner and people are looking for that game now.

[18:39] But you know what?

[18:40] I don't think stranger things will ever, ever, ever, ever be the game.

[18:45] That the Mandalorian already is.

[18:47] Isn't that crazy?

[18:48] Stranger things, pinball, will never get this excitement.

[18:51] It will never get it back.

[18:53] It doesn't matter.

[18:54] It could even be a better game in the end, but it doesn't matter.

[18:57] It will never sell as well as the Mandalorian.

[19:00] This is marketing.

[19:02] This is hype.

[19:03] This is how it works.

[19:04] And I'm telling you, you could either be upset by it or be enthused by it.

[19:09] I love this.

[19:10] This is what I live for.

[19:12] I love seeing products come out that drive consumers crazy that they're willing to claw

[19:18] over each other to get one.

[19:20] This is what David Fix needs to create over at American Pinball.

[19:23] David Fix, are you watching this?

[19:25] All that big talk.

[19:26] He still won't interview on this show.

[19:28] I've reached out.

[19:29] Nothing from David Fix.

[19:30] They're going to watch this launch.

[19:32] Deep root pinball, 130 games, Roberts talking to customers now.

[19:36] There's no games coming out in May.

[19:38] 130 total games sold.

[19:40] They're going to sell 130 Mandalorians in less than a second.

[19:45] In less than a second.

[19:47] It's more than Deep root can sell in five years.

[19:50] This is great.

[19:51] This is great.

[19:52] I love this Mando madness.

[19:54] The other thing is, code is probably the biggest Achilles heel that people want to see.

[19:58] But here's what's working for it in its favor when it comes to code.

[20:02] Is they have all of the assets.

[20:04] When you have all the assets from the show and you have that to work with and all the

[20:08] music, you have so much to go with that.

[20:11] If you fumble that, then you really suck at coding pinball.

[20:15] I mean that because you don't have to do all this like on the screen.

[20:18] You don't have to create graphics or animations.

[20:21] It's all right there.

[20:22] Disney has spent millions and millions and millions of dollars to make this amazing

[20:26] content that you can now work with.

[20:29] If you f that up, you should be fired from coding a pinball machine.

[20:32] I mean that.

[20:34] When you screw up the original trilogy or you screw up having all of the assets and all

[20:39] of the actors and all the callouts from Carl Weathers that are going to be in this game,

[20:43] if you screw that up.

[20:45] You don't get a second shot.

[20:46] Because there's no second shot at making a great Star Wars pinball machine.

[20:50] Well this is the fifth shot at making a great Star Wars pinball machine.

[20:54] That's the other part people are forgetting.

[20:56] It's like finally we might get a great Star Wars pinball machine.

[20:59] That is why there's so much hype here because I've seen your game rooms people.

[21:03] I've seen some of you out there of these shrines to Star Wars and rightfully so because

[21:07] it's an amazing franchise.

[21:09] For those of you who say the show is lame, no, you're lame.

[21:13] Okay, let me repeat that.

[21:14] If you think the Mandalorian is lame, you're lame.

[21:17] It's great.

[21:18] If you have no joy left in you if you think this shows, someone said like, oh the bad guys

[21:22] keep missing and where have you been?

[21:24] That's been Star Wars since day one.

[21:26] The Stormtroopers couldn't hit the side of a barn and yet we love Star Wars.

[21:31] It's just the way it is.

[21:32] You're supposed to be in a sort of state of suspended disbelief when you watch this thing

[21:36] and just let it be.

[21:38] Enjoy it.

[21:39] I mean everybody was blown away.

[21:40] We'll keep forgetting too.

[21:41] We keep saying Mandalorian, Mandalorian, Mandalorian.

[21:44] But here's the real magic.

[21:46] Here's the real pull towards this game.

[21:48] It's Grogu.

[21:49] It's Baby Yoda is the thing.

[21:52] Baby Yoda is the thing that just took over the world.

[21:55] Baby Yoda is the thing that everybody loves.

[21:57] Baby Yoda is going to be in this game.

[21:58] I know his name is not Baby Yoda.

[22:00] It's Grogu.

[22:01] I still don't get that name really.

[22:03] But that's going to be the part that like every kid, every wife, everyone who loves Star

[22:07] Wars.

[22:08] In a way, ironically because it's a baby, it gave us rebirth, renewal.

[22:13] It rejuvenated our love of Star Wars and it's going to be in Pimball form available

[22:18] for you to buy on Tuesday, May 11th when Canada said, that's amazing.

[22:22] That is amazing that we're going to be able to have this fun show as it's at the peak

[22:26] of its popularity.

[22:28] We're going to be able to have a Pimball machine.

[22:30] This is what you've been asking for.

[22:31] This is what you've been waiting for.

[22:33] We keep saying like stop looking back, stop making old stuff, stop making things from

[22:37] the 60s, stop making stuff from the 70s, make something contemporary.

[22:41] They listened and they did it.

[22:43] Who else out there is not shocked that it also has season two in it.

[22:47] That's amazing.

[22:48] The song you heard at the beginning of this podcast was Luke's entrance.

[22:50] It's so good.

[22:52] The music is amazing.

[22:53] The scene is amazing.

[22:54] I can't wait to see how they implement that into the Pimball game.

[22:58] Are you excited?

[22:59] I'm excited.

[23:00] Okay, so what else could tank this machine?

[23:01] Well, what about the design?

[23:03] Could Brian Eddie let us down?

[23:05] Does Brian Eddie ever done a bad design?

[23:08] I would say no.

[23:09] I mean, most of his stuff is fan layout, but we love the fan layout and we also love the

[23:14] shadow.

[23:15] I think this is going to be more like the shadow, but Brian Eddie, if there's one thing

[23:20] he doesn't mess up, he doesn't make a clunk fest.

[23:22] Stranger things isn't clunky.

[23:24] He knows how to make games that shoot tremendously well.

[23:27] That's why I don't think Brian Eddie is going to be a weakness here.

[23:31] What about the art package?

[23:32] Could that be a weakness?

[23:33] Will Randy Martinez' artwork work well on this game?

[23:37] Or will it be to sort of lunchboxy?

[23:39] I'm on the fence.

[23:40] I want to see what style he goes with because I hope it doesn't look like the Star Wars

[23:45] comic book edition that he did because Mandalorian is a little darker.

[23:49] It's a little grittier.

[23:50] It's a little more brown.

[23:51] It's a little bit more like earthy and tone.

[23:54] So I hope that it's not this like lunchbox bright game.

[23:58] And I'm curious how the best scar armor is going to work on the game.

[24:02] Is it going to look shiny or have some of that best scar waveiness to it?

[24:07] But here's the thing, man.

[24:08] I can't get over how excited I am to see this best scar edition Ellie.

[24:13] How will they do the art?

[24:14] How will they do the armor?

[24:15] I just can't wait to see this game.

[24:18] Upper playfield, magnets, toys.

[24:20] You got a ship.

[24:21] You got rotating targets.

[24:22] You got six drop targets.

[24:24] It sounds like it's going to be a blast.

[24:27] And I hope it is a blast.

[24:28] And I hope Brian Eddie is redeemed.

[24:30] And I hope this game kicks ass.

[24:32] And I hope this game puts Stern back on the map in a way in which we want it to be back

[24:36] on the map.

[24:37] Not for nothing, but Stern's last few releases really haven't done much for me.

[24:41] They haven't done much for you.

[24:42] They've been good.

[24:43] Avengers was a good game.

[24:44] It was a really good game.

[24:46] But it's just like it's a little soulless.

[24:47] I mean, Avengers doesn't have this kind of hype.

[24:50] When Avengers was revealed, it's like, yeah, it's a great shooter.

[24:54] It's really hard for a lot of people.

[24:56] And it's too deep in a lot of ways that we don't want it to be deep.

[24:59] It just doesn't.

[25:00] It just didn't grab you.

[25:01] It just didn't.

[25:02] And I know that Keith L.

[25:04] When has his huge fan base.

[25:05] And I even think Keith L.

[25:07] When he knows that he's got more things coming that are going to be the things that blow

[25:11] you away.

[25:12] Now I'm hearing rumors that like Keith L.

[25:13] When might be doing back to the future.

[25:14] I don't know.

[25:15] I was like, I don't think so.

[25:16] I want to end this show though.

[25:18] I want to give a different perspective on the show.

[25:20] And I want to read an email I got from a friend of the show Craig Johnson.

[25:24] I want to read you what he wrote me because I think a lot of you are feeling this.

[25:28] And as much as I'm excited and I'm giddy about this game.

[25:31] I want to read what he said.

[25:32] This was in response to my ADM show and how I've been telling everybody like listen to me.

[25:37] Get on a list for an alley and he said just listen to your recent podcast.

[25:41] I think you need a little perspective.

[25:44] I don't think you mentioned it enough or at all that there is a good old boys club in

[25:48] Pimbal to find it as you will.

[25:50] But a part of it consists of being on these lists with distributors permanently.

[25:56] For people like myself, I'm not in the club.

[25:59] And I have no access to being high up on any of these lists in order to secure any of

[26:04] the highly sought after alleys.

[26:06] I think G&R is the perfect example.

[26:08] I was on the list through several distributors long before your daily lectures about securing

[26:14] a game.

[26:15] I was told by all of them I wouldn't be getting a game of course.

[26:18] I really hope that in the future, JJP continues to sell directly through their website because

[26:23] that will be the only way a non good old boy will have a chance at getting one of their

[26:30] alleys.

[26:31] I think he means CES for JJP.

[26:32] Whoever is the quickest to the keyboard wins seems more fair from where I'm sitting.

[26:37] This now brings me to Star Wars.

[26:39] I contacted many distributors long before your predictions on the next title.

[26:43] There is just no chance in hell me and anyone else will get on a list for an alley.

[26:49] These lists are etched in stone with all the insiders getting the hot titles no matter

[26:54] what.

[26:55] Some distributors say they don't do lists, some don't respond to any emails, some just

[27:00] flat out tell me their lists are too long and have permanent members at the top.

[27:06] So as proud as you are that you are warning us beforehand about getting the next hot title,

[27:11] it does guys like me no good whatsoever.

[27:14] Sure, I could have got a Led Zeppelin ELE probably because the game is terrible enough

[27:19] of the insiders dropped off the top spots on the list to make room.

[27:23] What I'm really talking about here are the hottest titles that everybody wants most will

[27:28] never in a million years have a shot at an alley going forward.

[27:32] I wouldn't be so proud of warning everyone ahead of big popular releases because for

[27:37] these ultra hot titles it does no good to warn anyone.

[27:41] We won't be getting in ELE only the insiders will.

[27:45] Craig.

[27:46] First of all, thank you so much for this and for those of you out there.

[27:50] If you email canadapimbal at gmail.com and you say something thought provoking or interesting

[27:55] like this, I will read your comments on the air from now on.

[27:58] I've stopped doing it but I'm going to do it more often.

[28:00] So Craig, I feel your pain and your right.

[28:03] Craig is absolutely right and I'm sorry that I get so excited about games and tell you

[28:08] to do what you need to do to try to get one.

[28:10] Here is what I think is the only way forward here and Craig is right.

[28:13] But mostly everybody out there who's not on an ELE list, added distributor who hasn't

[28:18] been on that list for years, is there a solution to the problem Craig has?

[28:22] There is none.

[28:23] So should canada stop saying go get on a list.

[28:26] Here's the reality.

[28:28] Craig is right.

[28:29] These lists are too full now and they've been filling up for years.

[28:32] This isn't just because of Mandalorian.

[28:34] It has been super easy to get on these lists.

[28:37] But there are also there are also distributors out there who do not, who do not,

[28:43] have a standing list.

[28:45] I think you need to find out which distributors are those.

[28:48] Some of those distributors are going to start charging more than sticker and maybe the

[28:52] only way in is you're going to have to pay over sticker on day one and become a consistent

[28:58] buyer with some of those distributors who are selling over and you might have to get

[29:02] on their list.

[29:04] Here's what I would do if I were some people.

[29:06] I would, I would find the distributors who are charging over for Mandalorian who don't

[29:11] have a list.

[29:12] I would find them and I would try to get in their good graces and maybe buy the game

[29:17] and say, hey, look, I know you're going to charge a little bit over on every hot title.

[29:21] Can you just come to me first?

[29:22] Tell me what your price is and give me a shot at it.

[29:25] That just might be one way in.

[29:26] Okay, it's not the only way in.

[29:28] The other thing I would do is this.

[29:30] I would buddy up with some pin ciders that are on these lists and ask them, hey, if you

[29:35] pass on this game, can you just stay on the list and let me know and I would take the

[29:40] game if you're not interested in it.

[29:42] Again, I'm just telling you reality.

[29:44] These are things you could do.

[29:46] These are not ideal things that you have to do or want to do, but I'm just telling you

[29:51] in life, if you want to get a difficult reservation at a restaurant and a repeat customer knows

[29:57] the mater D, then maybe ask him, hey, can you help me get a reservation?

[30:01] This is it.

[30:02] This is where we're at and I've said it.

[30:03] Being on a distro's Ely list is the brand new season ticket holder to the New York

[30:08] Giants.

[30:09] That's how it works and I think that distributors also should think about this and I'm talking

[30:15] to all you distributors out there who are listening to this right now.

[30:18] What Craig says is fair and I think Stern should listen to this.

[30:22] What Craig says is fair.

[30:23] What should they do to make sure more people have access to these things when they launch?

[30:28] Now I don't think Stern cares.

[30:30] Why should they care that they made something that the market considers to be way more

[30:34] valuable than they even priced it at?

[30:36] That's great for them because remember these Ely's.

[30:39] They're only selling 750 of them.

[30:41] The rest of them they'll make to the cows come home right?

[30:45] They'll make premiums for years, pros for years and these distributors have to buy so many

[30:50] of those premium and pros to get an Ely.

[30:53] Think about that strategy.

[30:55] Stern actually doesn't want you all to get Ely's.

[31:00] They want some of you to be disappointed because you need to walk away from that Ely and

[31:05] go buy that premium that that distributor bought or that pro that they bought.

[31:10] They need those customers and those customers become more plentiful the more people get

[31:15] rejected from the Ely.

[31:17] I mean it's just crazy that Stern, even though they disappoint, they're not really going

[31:21] to disappoint you because you also can have the same exact game in the premium.

[31:27] It'll be the same exact game and so this is actually genius marketing by Stern.

[31:33] It's something that the other pinball companies can't really figure out.

[31:37] The other companies can't figure out or do it successfully and the reason Stern can do

[31:41] it this way too is because of volume.

[31:43] They can make these games fast enough.

[31:45] Jersey Jack couldn't do this.

[31:47] They couldn't do it this way because no one wants to wait another like eight months

[31:50] to get a single Ely from them.

[31:52] They just can't do it.

[31:53] Stern will have thousands of Mandalorians made in the time period in which Jersey Jack can

[31:58] probably only make 500 games and so that's the huge difference.

[32:02] You know there's really not much you can do Craig.

[32:05] There's not much you can do and I do feel bad that so many people out there feel like

[32:09] they're shut out of this.

[32:11] But this is life.

[32:12] It's a weird lesson in life is that the people who have been in this hobby from the very

[32:16] beginning have a distinct advantage.

[32:19] The people who have been buying games for years and years and years are being taken care

[32:23] of.

[32:24] The people that have friendships with distributors are being taken care of.

[32:27] It's not fair but it's life and you just have to accept it.

[32:32] And I know people come at me too like every once in a while like I'll get a game or I'll

[32:36] be able to buy a game and they're like why do you get to buy a game canator like you

[32:40] don't buy tons of games and I love when I get that criticism because are you telling

[32:44] me that I've given no value to distributors that I haven't helped hype games for them

[32:50] that I haven't given them amazing awareness and exposure and enthusiasm for these distributors

[32:56] that I talk about frequently.

[32:58] Are you telling me that after doing 578 podcasts about pinball that canada should have no more

[33:05] clout than you someone who's done nothing but just read Pinside or be a keyboard commando

[33:11] and has some money.

[33:12] I'm not bragging here but me, Zach many, Jeff Patterson, Jack Danger, the people who actually

[33:20] do things and add value and there's a lot more names I'm not mentioning.

[33:24] But of course we have a little bit more clout than just the average Joe in pinball because

[33:29] we're out there and we're spending so much time and energy keeping this enthusiasm going.

[33:35] I mean for all the pinball podcasters out there who have been giving you free content during

[33:39] all these months when there's nothing going on.

[33:42] It has been the staleest five months of pinball in such a long time and are you contributing

[33:47] to my Patreon page?

[33:49] Are you giving us like support?

[33:51] How are you supporting all of us?

[33:52] And we're doing all this to keep you guys enthused and keep you excited about pinball

[33:57] during all these months where there's nothing going on.

[34:00] And so you don't think any of those people, Marty Robbins, you don't think Jeff T. Oles,

[34:05] you don't think any of these people should have more clout than just the average guy who's

[34:08] a buyer.

[34:09] You're wrong.

[34:10] Some of us have a little bit more influence, some of us have a little bit more power than

[34:14] other people because we deserve it.

[34:17] We put in the work.

[34:18] This is like this weird thing is everybody in the modern world just thinks they're entitled

[34:21] to getting that reservation just because they can afford the food.

[34:25] There's something called relationship building.

[34:27] There's something called putting in the work and the time and that might bump you to the

[34:32] front of the line.

[34:34] And maybe, maybe like figure out a new way to sort of become more valuable within the

[34:40] eyes of the pinball community and you might find yourself with a little bit more clout

[34:45] and a little bit more pull and a little bit more leverage in pinball.

[34:49] Okay.

[34:50] I apologize.

[34:51] I put in a lot of hard work here and so I love it when people come at me and say that

[34:55] they think that like it's wrong that I might be able to get access to these games.

[35:00] Okay.

[35:01] Because I put in the work.

[35:02] All right.

[35:03] Well, this has been a fun one.

[35:04] I can't wait to Tuesday.

[35:05] We're going to do the Saturday morning spectacular today and for all of you out there, thank

[35:08] you so much for tuning into Canadian pinball podcast.

[35:11] Has it been fun?

[35:12] Has it been fun?

[35:13] You know, I took a lot of arrows in the back.

[35:16] Other shows saying like, oh, we were the one for the news.

[35:19] We're the one for the, come on.

[35:20] You all know deep down inside that if my biggest competitor, if they had this information, if

[35:25] super awesome pinball show had this information that the Mandalorian was the next stern machine,

[35:32] they would not have done what I did.

[35:34] They would not have spoiled the reveal date.

[35:36] They would not have told you details on the game.

[35:39] They would not have told you Randy Martinez is the artist.

[35:42] They wouldn't be able to do it because they want to interview George Gomez and they're

[35:45] going to interview George Gomez and it makes me laugh though because you know, I'm

[35:49] talking to Gomez last night and he still talks to me because you know what?

[35:53] He's so busy running the greatest pinball company that's on planet earth right now and

[35:58] they are.

[35:59] They are the greatest pinball company on planet earth right now.

[36:02] Do they always make the greatest games?

[36:03] No, but man, what they do at the efficiency they do it is just incredible.

[36:09] And this is what Canadian pinball podcast does best.

[36:11] This is why we won four twippies and this is why we will win hopefully a fifth twippy.

[36:15] We're already starting campaigning for number five, but I love it.

[36:18] I love it.

[36:19] I love being back in the saddle and after all that trash talking I got and look, no hard

[36:23] feelings, man.

[36:24] I'm still trying to bury the hatchet with these guys.

[36:26] They still won't congratulate me on the victory.

[36:28] I don't get it.

[36:29] I don't get it.

[36:30] But everybody have a good Saturday.

[36:31] We'll talk to you soon.
