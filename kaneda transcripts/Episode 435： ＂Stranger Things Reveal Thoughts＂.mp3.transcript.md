[00:00] We've written on the pages, the answer to our never-ending story.

[00:10] Ah!

[00:13] Sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba, sibba!

[00:17] You see how exciting it was to hear dusty, sing never-ending story in season three of Stranger Things.

[00:24] I swear to God that 10 seconds beginning this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcasts was more energetic and exciting than watching them stream the pro version of this game tonight.

[00:37] And I'm going to talk about this on Canadian Spinball Podcast tonight and I'm just going to level sit with all of you out there.

[00:43] I don't care if you vote for me, I don't care if you think I'm a negative Nancy, I don't care what you think about Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[00:51] I'm not going to be negative Nancy on this show. I'm going to give you my constructive feedback on this Monday in which the world was finally revealed by IGN Entertainment, the new Stranger Things Pinball Machine by Stern Pinball.

[01:10] Now somebody forgot to tell IGN that Canadian Spinball Podcasts already revealed this game on Friday night.

[01:18] But let's talk about this game today. Let's talk about what we're seeing in the DeadFlip stream. It's going on right now. I've been watching it, I've been watching it played over and over and over again, and I've watched people in the chat, do what they always do in Stern Chats in which they just congratulate and Pat Stern Pinball on the back for whatever they do.

[01:43] That's always what happens, you have to do that or they'll kick you out of the chat, but they can't kick Canadian Pinball out of his own Pinball Podcasts. So what do I think about this game? Here's the thing, here's the thing.

[01:55] I want to break it down first on a macro level and I want to break it down like this. It's real simple to me, it's real simple to me. Stern Pinball came out today and got a bunch of great media coverage around their Stranger Things Pinball Machine.

[02:12] We had Gizmodo telling us this was the most technologically advanced Pinball Machine of all time. We had the Verge, we had IGN, we had all these great media outlets tell us that this Pinball Machine was going to do something that no Pinball Machine has ever done before with its projection mapping onto the game.

[02:37] I'm excited, you read this stuff and you're like awesome, we made a Pinball Machine that's never been done before and then you want to stream the game for me without that feature shown.

[02:50] I'm just like throwing the mic over my shoulder, it's so stupid, how are you going to get people so excited for this feature and then stream the game and not show it? It's just a dumbest thing to me.

[03:03] You get people's expectations up about that feature and look, I'm going to be totally honest here. To me this game lives or dies by that feature.

[03:14] That feature is what this game is bringing, that's different because there's nothing else in this game that's different at all.

[03:23] In fact, it's so basic, a fan layout and you know if you listen to this podcast, nobody knows fan layouts better than Canadian Pinball podcasts.

[03:35] But my god, you could pretty much drop any theme onto this kind of layout and it works.

[03:42] Eight shots, all going in an expected direction. I mean it's basically like a tack for Mars, but instead of the Martian ship,

[03:52] you have the demigorgan and you have the screen there and that's it, there's nothing different.

[03:59] So I just want to start out this podcast by saying, I think streaming this game and not showing off the technology that everybody wants to see is a total fail.

[04:12] It's a total fail. Nobody cares about the pro version of the game. Nobody. I mean they're highlighting this projector as being the thing and then they can't show it.

[04:25] And I don't think they know how to show it. I really don't. I think they're backtracking. And here's why I think as a customer, I think this is BS.

[04:34] Because if you want to buy an L.E. version of this game and the company won't show you how that feature works before you have to lock in your order for your L.E.

[04:47] Do you know stupid that is that you have to commit to something that the company themselves won't even show you before the order banks are closed.

[04:57] And I'm hearing from people like the game selling well. Of course this game is going to sell well. It's strange or freaking things.

[05:04] When you hear that theme song, when you see the characters from the show, without a doubt, I think they're going to sell a ton of these games.

[05:12] But that doesn't matter. They were always going to sell a ton of these games. The real question is, is the game worth the hype?

[05:20] Is this game? It doesn't feel like Brian Eddie's return to pinball. Is this magnanimous moment in which we're all saying to ourselves, wow, did you see what they put into this game?

[05:32] Wow, look what they did there. Wow, look at all the stuff that's in stranger things pinball.

[05:38] And pause for a moment and think about that for a moment. Are you saying that to yourself?

[05:44] Let me ask you another question out there. If Jersey Jack pinball released this game as it is, as their version of stranger things, what do you think the response would be?

[05:57] Do you think they would burn Jersey Jack to the ground? Put this next to dialed in, pired to the Caribbean, Willy Wonka.

[06:04] What do you think? Do you think this shows that level of detail and attention to the world they're trying to bring to life?

[06:13] I don't know. I don't know. Part of me is just like I feel like forced and pressured into loving every single thing Stern pinball does.

[06:22] There's just this overwhelming army of Stern pinball fanatics. I get it. I mean, I love Stern pinball. I think Stern pinball makes some phenomenal games.

[06:34] But I want to look at this game on its own. I don't want to look at this game with the pressure that what I say about this game is representative about what I feel about all Stern pinball games.

[06:48] I want to just step back and look at it and be like, does this game make me feel as excited as I did the first time I saw Ghostbusters?

[06:58] Does this game make me feel as excited as the first time I saw Jurassic Park? Is this game going to shoot as good as that?

[07:05] Those are the things that I think about. Otherwise, I think you just get stuck doing what people do. They're just like everything pinball.

[07:13] I'm not one of those people. There's good in this game. There's bad in this game. There's a lot to talk about in this game.

[07:22] I definitely think my contact who played this game and he said to me, he said the next game is going to be one in which you have a ton of content.

[07:31] It's a little bit of a head scratcher. There's good in there's bad. Let's talk about it. Let's talk about what we like about Stranger Things.

[07:37] Let's talk about what we don't like about Stranger Things. Let's talk about the day in which Stern pinball proved to everybody that they could do everything.

[07:45] They could make a game. Let distributors have it. They could put it on location. They could sell it to you all in one big glorious day.

[07:54] Now here, let's start with that because it is incredible that this company can manufacture, ship to distributors, put on location,

[08:04] have it in people's home by Christmas all in one day. Absolutely amazing. Incredible. I mean, no one else can do that. Nobody else.

[08:13] So Stern deserves credit for that. But let me play Devil's Saved a Kid a little bit on Canadian pinball podcasts.

[08:19] The game's not even close to being done. It's unfinished. It's 0.64 code. So as much as they want to beat their chest and say, we did this.

[08:30] We got this game to the world and we got, you know, it's available. It's not done. Do you serve people a steak that's not cooked yet?

[08:40] Do you ship a car that doesn't have all the parts assembled onto it? What other thing in life do we buy that's so incomplete?

[08:47] And I know this is pinball. You buy the game and you wait for the code. But 0.64, that's not even close to being done.

[08:55] And you can see it in the stream. The game looks really incomplete. And so I just don't understand why Stern chose this game at this moment, right?

[09:06] Right before Christmas, we're all getting ready for the holidays to sort of make this statement.

[09:12] They would have been much better off making a statement like this, backing a game like Jurassic Park, a game that shipped with pretty much complete code, a game that had creative layout, again, that had like a really many cool toys in the game.

[09:30] Let's go back to the toys in the game. Let's go back to the toys in the game. So here's a question I have for everybody because you know, I like I'm dealing with an army of people giving me feedback.

[09:40] And I'm going to read some of your feedback from my Facebook page on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast, but I like to just step back because in these moments of hype, you people start to see things with rose colored glasses and they see what they want to see.

[09:56] And I'm guilty of that. We're all guilty of that. If this is a 100% subjective journey for all of us, some of you might love this game.

[10:07] Some of you might hate it. Some of you might think it's exciting and you can't wait to put it in your house. Some of you might be bored as hell by what you're seeing.

[10:16] And let me tell you something, nobody is right and nobody is wrong. We all have to make our own opinions about this game. And also, we've never shot the game. Most of us have never played it. Do I think it's going to be fun to shoot yes.

[10:31] But that's not what this hobby is about anymore. Every game, almost every game is fun to shoot. The real question is this, is this the stranger things game that sort of showcases Brian Eddie, one of the greatest designers of all time.

[10:49] Do we feel like this game possesses enough magic and enough wow because with you were to tell me Brian Eddie is going to make stranger things.

[10:59] That's a wow expectation, right? So let's talk about the toys in the game because here is something I just can't figure out. I just can't get over this hump a little bit. What is in this game that brings the stranger things world to life?

[11:14] Like what is physically in this game that takes elements from stranger things and physically brings them to life in this game? What what's in this game?

[11:25] So let's start there. Let's just ask that very simple question. You got the demogorgon bash toy that's in every version of the game. And obviously that's the villain in the game and that is there.

[11:36] Now after that toy can someone please tell me what is physically in this game that's part of the stranger things universe? I'm just going to wait. I'm going to wait for you guys out there to email me to text me to tell me what's what's in this game? What else is there?

[11:54] Because I'm looking at this game and I'm not seeing anything else physically in this game that is part of the stranger things universe. Am I wrong? I mean I get you've got the telekinesis magnets which you can't see but physically on the game itself physically there is no real estate that pays homage to anything else in the show at all.

[12:19] It is like they were working on this projector technology and they thought it was neat and they wanted to put it into a game and so they just put it into attack for Mars and they made it stranger things with a bash toy behind the drop targets.

[12:34] I mean seriously what else is in the game? What are the toys are there? What else is going on? Am I am I missing something? So then it all hinges on this projector and then the other thing I keep I just keep hitting my head. What about the stranger things world? What about that world is a projection screen thing like there's nothing in the stranger things world.

[12:59] That's a drive in movie that is all about being projection mapping in the world. I just I don't get it like where are the physical Christmas lights in the game that light up? Why isn't there like an area of the game in which it's like an 80s arcade?

[13:16] Like where's the dungeons and dragons I get it's on the screen and it's a shooter knob. Where's like where's anything physical that the ball interacts with?

[13:26] So let me give you an example what I mean by this where I think the game is just doesn't really have much from the theme. All right so if I look at Pirates of the Caribbean physically in that game physically in that game I've got an upper play field that rocks like Jack Sparrow's ship.

[13:41] I've got a cannon that shoots out a ball across to another physical ship in the game. I've got a treasure chest in the game that locks the ball.

[13:51] I've got a whirlpool in the game. A maelstrom that that's in the game. All right I mean that's like four or five things I've got a spinning distance like the map four or five six things in the game that are physically bringing to life.

[14:05] What's in that theme you got wonka vision you got the gob stopper machine you got the wonka Vader and that you know what I'm saying is I look at this thing and there's nothing in it.

[14:15] There literally is nothing in it from stranger things other than the demigorgon bash toy and let's talk about the bash toy because people are like my god like I mean yes it does look like a piece of an ad and I don't know what an ad I mean I don't know women you guys are have been sleeping with but people have been saying it looks like a certain part of the game.

[14:34] It looks like a certain part of a female anatomy I think it looks like already choke are you telling me that stern pinball with all of their engineering power they couldn't design this thing where it at least opens up the mouth of the demigorgon so that it doesn't just stay static like that.

[14:53] Am I nitpicking am I I don't understand this hobby anymore I don't understand why for the same price Dutch pinball could give you a bowling alley right it could give you an upper play field where the where it opens up in the car swings out becomes a bash toy it could give you the rug that rolls out.

[15:14] I'm just saying like where is that stuff where is that stuff and and I get it like the other big thing is the projector and so this whole game to me it hinges on how well they use that projector and they're not showing it to us.

[15:29] I mean other than that I mean you've got like your little vertical up kick on the left side that shoots the ball into the targets in the middle and then you've got the telekinesis lock on the upper left of the game and that's all you got you got nothing else.

[15:43] No other toys so Brian Eddie the king of toys and mechanisms and all this stuff I just feel like he ran into the one thing everybody runs into at stern and he ran into like a low bomb like this is the best they could do with the money they had and I just don't I don't know how you look at this and you say man they packed this game they they gave this game every

[16:12] thing that they could I see a million inserts going up the game I mean I don't even know what to do with inserts anymore I don't even know like is that normal is it not normal I mean some people say it's like you're playing a board game it looks like a poster with a bunch of inserts there's there's 15 vans in the game I don't know I don't know like what to expect anymore in pinball I really don't I want a physical world under glass as much as possible and are you

[16:41] telling me when you look down at this game you see the physical world of stranger things like the 1980s world of stranger things you're telling me you see it come to life.

[16:51] So then I ask you a question like what's the biggest wow thing going on in the game I mean it's just it's just a basic question is it the big ramp coming down and shooting the

[17:01] bash toy is that is that it because there's really nothing else unless the projector really adds a ton you know the art package let's talk about that let's talk about the

[17:11] art package you know the art package is okay is it as good as Yeti and and franchi no I mean it's it's all right it feels a little bit like we've gone back to the

[17:22] Photoshop drag and drop I mean none of the translates are like wow like none of the packages are wow the purple armor looks great I love the purple armor I think the music is cool the music is cool it's very

[17:34] 80s you know fits the theme perfectly you know but what's what's missing for me and this is what's hard it's hard it's like it's like I'm reviewing a game

[17:42] that's not done but can you blame me because it's like Stern's showing us this game incomplete but they're taking our money right now

[17:52] and you have to make up your mind on an incomplete game I just look at it and I don't feel like wow wow wow wow like oh my god like it

[18:02] doesn't matter like if I flip it or not like I just I just don't feel like we can judge this game yet until they show us the game with the projector working I don't feel like we can judge this game until the

[18:16] code is further along and I don't think this game was ready to be released that is my final statement today I just don't think like stranger things was ready this is not

[18:28] showing the game and it's best possible light no pun intended because we didn't get any light from the projector but why was Stern pinball in such a rush to launch

[18:38] this game like two days before Christmas and not have it further along it just feels like they continue to treat us like we will buy

[18:48] these things regardless of what they give us regardless of what they show us regardless of how far along it is so you have to buy this

[18:56] game and you've got a long long wait for Lonnie to finish the code but you have to already commit to buying an LE and you don't even know what you're getting why are we accepting this crap why are you sick of

[19:09] Canadian Spinball podcast I mean you can go listen to a bunch of other pinball podcasts I'm sorry like I don't know I just this is just how I feel like I just I

[19:17] love stranger things I love stranger things I mean I think season three not being a part of it is also like a huge issue for me you know we don't talk about this but there's a reality is when you make a pinball

[19:29] machine that is based on a TV show there are certain TV shows that lend themselves nicely to pinball machines and there are certain TV shows that might be problematic if those

[19:41] aren't complete yet game of thrones being one of them so now you've just captured a little bit of that shows narrative but not the whole thing and season three a lot of

[19:52] people love season three of stranger things to me that was like the most fun season I mean yes the first season is much darker but season three man that was

[20:01] like oozing with nostalgia and fun and was so much so awesome so awesome like we're not going to get that we're not going to get never

[20:09] any story we're not going to get any of that narrative and and so it's weird to me you know it's better to me when you pick a TV show like the

[20:16] Simpsons or Rick and Morty where it's episodic so you're not missing anything right imagine making or the rings pinball when they were only through

[20:25] the two towers and you don't get the final movie I mean that's kind of what it's like now because it's probably just can be one more season of stranger things and then we're done but the pinball

[20:35] machine will always be just the first two seasons so here's my final my final take on this game the game's not done they're asking us to give

[20:45] our opinion and buy a game that's not complete they've done this before but I just don't think they should have gone all in and made such a big deal

[20:54] about a game that was so incomplete be like launching Batman 66 you know and trying to get everyone to buy it that day which we know they did I

[21:03] think next to other games especially like Jersey Jack games like around the same price I just think these games are starting to look

[21:12] embarrassingly bear and they're really looking like Stern is not putting nearly enough into these games and I'm sorry but I that's just how I feel

[21:22] and I think that they're relying so much on theme so much on the LCD and so much on you know things like animations and inserts to

[21:34] tell the story of these properties when they should be doing more to put physical things into these games that bring these

[21:42] properties to life and again you go around this game I'm just not seeing a lot physically in it other than a

[21:49] bash toy and a magnet grab and a projector that nobody's really seen work effectively but they want you to buy the

[21:56] Ellie before you can actually see it work effectively and I just I just don't agree with that I just don't agree with that I

[22:04] mean we haven't even talked about how silly the game looks when it's off when you have the premium or the

[22:10] Ellie and there's just those big white pieces of real estate on the screen and on the ramps that nothing is there it looks

[22:20] it looks bad I mean common sense like who walked over that is like this is what it's going to look like when the games turned off and then

[22:27] people on the inside are like you know the stern apology just being like well it doesn't matter what a game looks like when the

[22:32] pin is off and that's a total BS these games have always been artwork there is no other pinball machine ever in the history of

[22:41] the pinball that when you walk over it you see stuff like that on the play field I mean it's it's it's I give stern credit for

[22:49] being ambitious I give stern credit and Brian Eddie credit for taking a risk but if you're going to take that

[22:56] risk and you're going to be ambitious and you're going to blitz the world with your launch and you're going to

[23:02] brag about putting something that's never been done before in pinball and then you stream the game from your own

[23:08] company and you don't show us that technology that you're boasting about that is a total fail total fail I think it's

[23:19] lame I think you need to show people everything you've got and so we can make up our mind I mean this podcast I

[23:26] haven't played it you have to make up your own mind I just wanted to see the best version of the game on the day

[23:34] in which they're asking people to buy the L.E.'s show us what you got you're bragging about this thing show us it is

[23:42] unfair of me to ask for that all right so let's end this episode where again we don't know how we're going to like this game in the end I'm just

[23:52] giving you day one feedback but I asked you out there listener of the show I asked you guys out there on my

[23:59] Facebook page to tell me what your thoughts were on stranger things and I would read some of your

[24:05] feedback on the air so let's do that right now Carl Lutz he said the game is uninspiring a man of very few

[24:14] words Tommy batson said definitely one I'm letting mature before I touch it I think the premium could be

[24:22] great 18 to 24 months from now but no way I'm jumping into it as it is today all right let's keep going

[24:31] here we've got Mark Nellis said I'm watching the stream right now and I wish they would have shown the premium in

[24:39] the stream triple magnet lock on the backboard and the projector are not on the pro that is what everyone really

[24:47] wanted to see that turned in this stream stern kind of took the safe and easy road for this stream however the pro does

[24:56] look like it's going to be fun lots of shots six modes from season one six modes from season two they had the

[25:03] main show music but none of the 80 songs from the series so yeah I mean we knew stern was never going to license

[25:10] like license the 80s music like a haz take on me and other 80s songs that was never going to happen the music does

[25:17] sound good you know I do think that everyone wanted to see the premium and elite tonight all right so

[25:24] jame guyer says I'm not a fan of the drive in movie screen in the middle of the play field well actually had

[25:31] they used it as a drive in movie screen it might have been more interesting a missed opportunity with

[25:37] a viral or a mystery science theater 3000 theme I agree I mean I just think it's like it's so weird that they

[25:46] just sort of put this gimmick into this game when it has nothing to do with stranger things Kelly Daniel says

[25:52] drop the new podcast already Kelly your part of it right now Chris Pellis says fantastic

[25:58] theme great colorful art proven fun layout code will mature once the premium comes out this is going

[26:06] to be a fun immersive pin looking forward to it Daniel donnell says pretty sure no one wanted to see the pro

[26:14] tonight but take what we can get I guess thanks stern for showing us a snippet of badass innovation to only

[26:22] let us look at a still image in the middle of the goddamn play field besides on route I really can't see anyone

[26:30] buying the pro Lenny lipkin says my wife wants one probably in for a premium hopefully there won't be play field

[26:39] issues I'll be so pissed if there are you know Lenny you bring up a really interesting point because the

[26:45] play field issues I'm still not convinced we ever got an answer and that they solve that problem Greg

[26:51] Creech says I put money down on a pro the premium features don't add to gameplay rather merely cosmetic add-ons

[27:01] and operator doesn't need also with the additional one to two months of wait time for the premium the pro is the no

[27:09] brainer for operators well Greg I do agree that operators should just go with the pro I don't think the

[27:15] projectors gonna work well for operators I really don't but I will say that the magna the telekinesis

[27:22] magna save in the upper left corner the ball lock is really cool I mean that's that's something that people are

[27:28] going to I think be excited by Steven Callister says the theme isn't for me but the play field and cabinet

[27:35] art looks absolutely amazing Donovan G says it's met to me and I hate the price increase on it it's just not

[27:44] justified so Donovan we haven't talked about this but Stern is raising the price by a hundred bucks I believe

[27:50] on every version of the machine Stern does this they slowly start to increase the price of their

[27:56] machines I mean the L.E. is now ninety one hundred dollars and they sneak this in you know you think about that

[28:03] that's one hundred bucks on top of five hundred machines an extra fifty thousand dollars on the L.E.s

[28:10] did they put a lot more into the games I don't know Tom Grav said not impressed at all pretty

[28:17] average layout Jeff Davis says the dark theme mixed with the flashy pinks and laser noises aren't mixing

[28:24] well it doesn't look fun to play attack from Mars part two Brian Costner says looks like the code is

[28:32] very early things look unfinished and I heard very little audio hopefully more will be added soon

[28:39] Cody M I dig all the vans on the play field outrun style color palette is groovy hype that some machines are already

[28:47] on location the day of the official announcement well Cody that was cool Tim Siden said I have a feeling it

[28:55] was ranked in the top five pinball machines of all time on pinside by owners in two weeks or less

[29:01] or it will be ranked in the top five no there's no way this game is going to be a top five machine in two weeks

[29:07] uh... birdo moon says I'm going to play it later tonight at my parents basement in Atlanta how do you parents have this already

[29:15] virtue but you're lucky boy Adam B says good effort not buying this one Joseph P says Jack needs to be the one doing the talking

[29:26] these two guys are putting me to sleep Greg Jones said saving my beaver pelt's nickels for the next JJP drop

[29:34] Elroy Jenkins says please cover the back of the drop door all right we got a lot there's a lot you guys have a lot of

[29:41] feedback here you know Michael Jones Michael buddy he says love the theme want to see how it shoots and where the

[29:48] code is at before making a decision leaning towards a premium the projection is innovative and can add a lot to the game

[29:56] if done well well Michael I agree but we haven't seen it you know that's the big question mark today where is it

[30:02] all right Travis merely says I'm having mixed feelings I was in for an Ellie my district of choice was already sold out

[30:11] so I've decided to get a pro for now with the intention of upgrading to a premium in the future

[30:17] theme is solid Brian Eddie is a proven winner when it comes to design code is woefully underdeveloped at this point in time which will not

[30:28] shock it is a surprise and considering how this release was handled kudos to stern for getting this to market early

[30:35] but after watching a stream earlier today it seems to be way too early and I'm still cautiously optimistic since they have assets from the show

[30:45] all right well Travis you know it's interesting because you're like well the Ellie's are sold out and nobody has seen the Ellie in action

[30:52] and it just goes to show like stern pinball you know they really don't have to do much you know they sell out of an Ellie of a

[30:59] machine that no one has ever seen and no one knows what this projector does and yet and yet you're saying your

[31:05] distributor is sold out I mean it's it's kind of like it doesn't matter if they just slapped stranger things with some

[31:12] purple armor and limit the number of LEDs are going to sell every single one Drew I'm going to miss some of

[31:18] you guys with this the way it is Drew B said seems to be a lot of guys who are saying my wife my girlfriend my

[31:24] kids etc want this game I think that's good for stern and great for the hobby prices keep creeping up and we are

[31:31] allowing it to happen by voting with our wallets but with that being said stern does seem to be listening and trying

[31:38] new things and putting more in their games last three offerings were much better in my honest opinion

[31:45] I'm in on Jurassic Park after I said I wasn't buying new inbox so prices will continue to rise because of people like me

[31:52] Oh man Drew I mean everyone is it's got the same problem you do bro we all say we're not doing it we're not

[31:58] doing it we're going to stick it to the man and then they show us something and we buy it regardless of

[32:03] whether or not we know it's great or not let's see John Christie said to early code the pro looks fun

[32:09] Edwin P said cool innovation just not my theme of choice Lucas said pro is the way to go

[32:16] all right so here's the thing here's the thing I mean nobody knows which way is the way to go yet until we see

[32:22] all all two versions of this game how do you know which way is the way to go how do you Ellie guys how

[32:29] do you feel confident knowing what you went into there is going to be a lot more discussion of this game

[32:34] I would love to see what the projector is and you know what it's still the verdict is still out on

[32:40] Stranger Things I just think as it is now as it is now I think everything for me hinges on that projector

[32:47] creating some amazingly new way to play pinball and creating an amazing effect we haven't seen before

[32:54] because other than that I just don't see this game having a ton in it that is making me like need to have it

[33:02] or need to have it now and that's just the way I feel okay and you might feel different and that's okay

[33:08] all right before I sign off this episode of can you just pinball podcast I want to officially on air apologize to Chris the

[33:17] pin turn in my pinside babies rant I said that he was an a hole for flipping a Rick and Morty spot that he had and

[33:26] he told me the whole story he reached out to me we had a nice conversation on Facebook and he explained to me what was going on

[33:32] and you know he is flipping in and he's making a little bit of profit but he's also getting one for himself

[33:37] so Chris I am sorry but I'll say this I am disappointed in you and I'm going to tell you why because you reached out to me on

[33:45] Facebook you told me why you were upset we had a cordial conversation we talked like two grown adults about it

[33:53] and we left that conversation in a really good place and I went back and I read it today and we were talking about

[34:00] whether we were traveling for the holidays I had apologized and we we left it in a really good place

[34:06] and then I wake up this morning and you do another podcast in which you go go off on me after we already like basically shook hands

[34:16] and said we're cool like we're cool and then you blocked me on Facebook so I don't know what it is with this hobby

[34:23] and I don't know what is with people in in which like you have a conversation like two grown men and you reach a

[34:30] resolution and you move on and everyone's feeling good and then you go back and you do that so I don't know what it is

[34:37] I don't know what it is about people's inability to accept apologies in this hobby okay so that's that's that

[34:44] so Chris if you're listening thank you for reaching out I apologize for calling you an A-hole but I did tell you

[34:51] when you flip a game for a profit it doesn't matter what your story is it doesn't matter people are going to think we are A-holes

[34:59] when we flip a game and make a profit it's just it's just the way it is and it's not a big deal

[35:04] you don't have to take it personally it doesn't have to ruin your enjoyment of pinball it doesn't have to keep you

[35:10] from dressing up at shows and having fun and and and and being friends with people okay in the future

[35:16] when you do come to a resolution with somebody and you do walk away accepting their apology

[35:23] you then don't go on a show after the fact and go slam them because that that's not cool all right so again I

[35:33] I just I don't get it I don't get it right and I just want to say congratulations to John and Morgan on their

[35:40] engagement it was real on my last show it's just some people hit me up like was that real like yes it was

[35:46] real it was awesome I was not expecting it and I know that she was just over the moon when he

[35:53] asked her the question yesterday and so I was just so happy to be a part of that so everybody look enjoy

[35:59] enjoy all the new pinball machines we have coming out I love I love this time of year when new games

[36:05] come out because we have so many opinions right where we're so like fired up but it's also like

[36:12] Christmas in two days and part of me is just like ready to enjoy the holidays and not care about this

[36:18] and that and what's happening and when is Joe Newark gonna give people their Rick and Morty numbers

[36:24] and and what's the projector like and stranger things and you know when are the twippy voting is going to open up

[36:31] January 1st and and what is Canada rambling about and he's such a negative Nancy doesn't do anything for

[36:37] this hobby come on I just keep you guys entertained on a weekly basis and I think we touched on some points

[36:43] that you probably agree with on stranger things some of them you might not but I would love to
