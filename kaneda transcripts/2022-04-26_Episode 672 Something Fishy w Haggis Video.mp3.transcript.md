[00:00] You know it's not the same as it was, as it was.

[00:06] CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA

[00:10] Welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast. I'm your host, Kaneda. Welcome to a second show in just two days.

[00:17] Now, this is a hard show for me to do. And the reason why this is a hard show for me to do is I know that many of you out there in the pinball world,

[00:25] you just want to believe. You want to believe in every single new company. You want to believe in every single pinball venture.

[00:33] And for the most part, you want to celebrate and cheerlead everything that is pinball. And I understand.

[00:39] Like, I love pinball just as much as you do. But I've also been a podcast that's been around for six years now.

[00:46] And in those six years, I've seen many, many pinball companies come and go.

[00:50] I've seen very, very few pinball companies actually be introduced into the pinball marketplace and be successful.

[00:57] It's one thing to make a game. It's one thing to make a prototype. It's another thing to make a pinball manufacturing company.

[01:05] And then it's even harder to make a pinball manufacturing company that can be profitable, that can be successful,

[01:12] that can have games on the line more days than there are no games on the line.

[01:17] Now, over the last 24 hours, I've had the ability to sort of analyze and take a look at the Haggis video.

[01:24] Now, on yesterday's show, I was glowing about how beautiful the game is.

[01:28] I was glowing about how amazing it looks, about how the attention to detail is really impressive.

[01:34] And I don't change my mind on any of that. I still think this is one of the most beautiful machines put into a box.

[01:40] But I did a show yesterday. I recorded it. And then I had to re-record the show because I saw the Haggis video.

[01:47] And now that I've had a full day to analyze this Haggis video, I need to do another show.

[01:52] Because I looked a lot closer at that one minute and 20 second video.

[01:57] A video in which they are showing us, seemingly, the testing of these Haggis games, putting them into a box,

[02:04] Marty putting his seal of approval on the game in dramatic fashion, and then we see two people boxing up the game,

[02:11] and then we see, like, no words, right? Hashtag no words because there were no words in the video.

[02:17] There was no video tour. There was no tour of production. There was no explanation on why it's taken so long to get to this point with Fathom production.

[02:27] Now, I want to do a show right now in which I analyze what we see in that one minute and 20 second video.

[02:34] And the reason why I think it's important to do this is simply this.

[02:38] I've seen this before. You've seen this before.

[02:42] The ability for a pinball company to create content, to convince everybody out there that everything is A-OK, never ceases to amaze me.

[02:52] Now, look, I don't know how to make a pinball machine.

[02:55] I don't know how to manufacture a pinball machine.

[02:58] But I do know, and I have seen, video tours of all the different pinball companies who are successful.

[03:06] And I've seen videos of their factory. I've seen videos of their production line.

[03:12] And we've heard from people on this show many, many times what it takes to turn production on for a pinball company.

[03:19] And so I want to take a look at this one minute and 20 second video.

[03:24] And I want us to ask ourselves, what are we actually seeing in this video?

[03:29] Are we seeing proof that production of Fathom has begun?

[03:33] Are we seeing enough proof that this game is on the line?

[03:36] Are we seeing enough proof that they can get multiple Fathoms out a week?

[03:40] And what is this video actually conveying to us?

[03:43] OK, now that's all I want to do.

[03:45] I want to take the content that they put out in the world and I just want to analyze it.

[03:51] Because I don't see many people analyzing it.

[03:53] I think this video makes people feel great.

[03:56] I think it makes people feel confident.

[03:58] I think it makes people see the sizzle.

[04:00] I think it makes people see the beauty.

[04:03] But what I want to do is I want to separate some of that sizzle from some of the substance in the video.

[04:08] And I want us to sort of ask ourselves, what have we seen?

[04:11] Like, that's it.

[04:11] I'm not going to do anything else other than say, what are we seeing in this video?

[04:16] I'm going to start playing it right now and I'm going to timestamp when we see stuff.

[04:20] So the video starts out right away at the nine second mark and we see the back of cabinets.

[04:25] Interesting when you think about that for a minute.

[04:27] Why are we shooting this video coming from behind the games?

[04:31] I want you to keep that in mind as you look at this video.

[04:34] There is a reason why they start this video shooting from behind the cabinets.

[04:39] You know what that reason is?

[04:40] Is there are eight cabinets in this video?

[04:43] Eight, okay?

[04:44] Now, only two of them have actual games inside.

[04:49] Actually have a play field that's populated.

[04:51] Actually have coin doors.

[04:53] Six of the eight cabinets are empty people.

[04:56] Okay.

[04:57] So that is like a huge point that I think everyone is missing.

[05:00] And also what's interesting is I keep counting the number of people in the video.

[05:04] Now you can't see their faces, but pause the video at the nine second mark.

[05:08] It's really funny.

[05:09] You can see two gentlemen leaning against the wall with their hands crossed and we see four feet,

[05:15] which means there's two people there.

[05:16] There's a pair of red shoes and a pair of black shoes.

[05:19] And it's almost like they're just trying to stay out of frame as someone is filming coming around the corner.

[05:24] Now, I also think the reason they start from behind is you see some of the beautiful details

[05:29] of these cabinets, right?

[05:31] You see the Haggis logo cut out on the back box and on the back of the game.

[05:35] And it looks beautiful.

[05:37] This detail of the back box of the game is a really nice thing to start out with.

[05:41] So that's another reason why I think they come from behind.

[05:44] Then it pans down a little bit and we see the beautiful chrome armor of the machine.

[05:48] They keep panning around or going around.

[05:50] Now at the 16 second mark, this is where we see that only two cabinets have coin doors.

[05:58] Now the question I have is this and I'm just going to ask this right now.

[06:01] We know that Haggis Pinball had built one prototype game.

[06:06] So my question after looking at this video, the entire month of April has gone by.

[06:12] How many more games have they built?

[06:15] Is this two new games were built or is this one new game next to the prototype game?

[06:22] We don't really know, but we do know is that one game is completed.

[06:27] Now the question I have when I look at this video and I think about all the other videos

[06:32] I've seen from Jersey Jack, from Spooky Pinball, from Stern Pinball, from every other boutique

[06:37] pinball company that has made games.

[06:40] Where's the line?

[06:41] Is this how you make pinball machines like one at a time?

[06:46] You know, because we don't see any production line.

[06:48] Like we don't see a video of people making games.

[06:51] And here's the other thing that just has me scratching my head.

[06:54] When they made Celts, they did daily updates showing video and footages and talk to us

[07:00] every day about what the Celts production line looked like.

[07:04] Now, why is nobody asking for any of that?

[07:07] Why didn't they show any of that?

[07:09] None of the production of these two machines that are seemingly in working order, ready to go out to customers.

[07:15] How come we were not taken on the journey to show us how these two machines were made?

[07:21] Why were they able to do that with Celts?

[07:24] And why was that nowhere to be seen with these Fathom games?

[07:28] So they pan around and we see underneath the game.

[07:31] And it's beautiful in there, right?

[07:32] We see this gorgeous sort of electronic package with Haggis Pinball on Plexiglas.

[07:39] And then the camera goes inside the cabinet and it looks absolutely gorgeous.

[07:44] Okay.

[07:45] There is a section in the back where the speakers are and the amplifier is.

[07:49] It's got two subwoofers.

[07:50] It looks like two.

[07:51] So this game is like loaded and it says in the back, play me loud.

[07:56] Now, look, I love all of these details.

[07:58] I love it.

[07:59] Now, look, I'm also going to say something right now that is absolutely accurate.

[08:02] I talked to someone who makes games at one of the top three pinball companies out there and they said, Chris, after looking at this video, there's no way they're making money.

[08:11] The bomb on these machines must be so much higher than they're charging for the game.

[08:15] And simply because of, like, look at it, like all of these custom parts, like all of what they're putting into this game is amazing.

[08:21] But the question remains, like, are they going to make money on these games?

[08:25] But I'm not going to take anything away from what I'm seeing inside these games because these games look damn impressive inside.

[08:32] I won't lie.

[08:33] The other thing I heard from someone at one of the major companies is there's a reason why we don't put the electronics in the bottom of the cabinet.

[08:40] Because if a screw falls, you can imagine how that can create trouble.

[08:44] But looking down at this haggis game, it does look like there's clear plexi covering the electronics.

[08:49] So I think that's their way to protect this game in case a screw does get loose and fall underneath into the electronics.

[08:56] We then pan up and see underneath the entire play field.

[08:59] Marty is looking over at the gentleman who's closing the play field with some very stern look.

[09:05] He then walks over with a very serious look on his face and puts down approved by Marty Robin's sticker on the apron of the game, on the metal rail by the apron.

[09:14] Now, here's the part that's really interesting.

[09:17] Right after he puts the sticker down on the game, and I want you guys to pay attention to this, right after he puts the sticker down on the game, the lights go out.

[09:26] We then see this beautiful light show of Fathom, but what don't we see in this video?

[09:32] We don't see any of that glow-in-the-dark reflective cabinet artwork that I thought these games had, right?

[09:39] When they showed this game and they revealed it to the world, it was supposed to have this foil reflective artwork that was sort of like glow-in-the-dark.

[09:46] I'm not sure if it has it, but you can see on the cabinet to the left of the machine Marty just approved that the cabinet is absolutely pitch black.

[09:56] So, not sure again, just going off of what I see in the video, I just don't see that reflective material that was shown in the initial teaser video of the game.

[10:06] But we then get a really cool under-cabinet lighting feature that looks like the ocean, which I really love.

[10:12] I mean, that is really cool.

[10:14] There's like a hole in the bottom of the cabinet.

[10:16] You can see it when they open up the play field that is being projected onto the ground.

[10:21] Again, all of this is really cool.

[10:23] I don't want to take away from the aesthetic beauty of this game.

[10:26] This is innovation.

[10:28] This is really amazing stuff to look at.

[10:31] This is very, very beautiful.

[10:33] This is one of the most beautiful minute and 20 seconds of a game we have ever seen.

[10:39] My question still remains though, like has production begun or is this video more of a staging of the sizzle of the game?

[10:47] And yet we're not seeing a line of play fields being assembled.

[10:51] We're not seeing a bunch of play fields go into cabinets.

[10:54] So then we zoom out, we're back in the room.

[10:56] We're still seeing the backs of all the cabinets.

[10:58] We never get to see the front on view.

[11:00] And then we see two individuals sort of like wrapping up this machine, putting the glass on, putting on the maid in Australia.

[11:07] And sort of they're getting this game ready to go into a box.

[11:10] And we get this like time-lapse video of them doing that.

[11:13] And again, just two people.

[11:15] There is nobody else in this video.

[11:17] There is nobody else we're seeing at all.

[11:19] And you could see like all these rooms, this big factory.

[11:22] They then wheel the game out into another area of Haggis Pimbal, this big room, right?

[11:27] This big room with absolutely again, nobody in it.

[11:31] Nobody in it.

[11:32] We're seeing rotisseries that have nothing on it.

[11:35] I'm looking at the room more than I'm looking at them because again, once again, I think this is a staging of what seemingly looks like production has begun.

[11:45] But we are seeing no people, no production.

[11:48] And here's the part that just kills me because, you know, as these gentlemen bring over a forklift and then they lift the game up, they're strapping it down.

[11:55] They put a box over it, then Marty walks over and beautifully puts the fathom, revisited mermaid edition model sticker onto the box.

[12:03] And he gives us the thumbs up and then it goes to hashtag slowly spells out no words.

[12:10] Okay, no words needed, right?

[12:12] We've shown you everything.

[12:14] The proof is in the pudding.

[12:15] Look at what we've created.

[12:17] We're not going to say anything.

[12:19] We don't need to talk.

[12:20] And I'm here to tell you on this episode of Canada's Pimbal podcast, I don't agree with that.

[12:24] I still think there are plenty of questions that we need to ask.

[12:28] I think the game is beautiful.

[12:29] I think what Damien created is a work of art.

[12:32] I want to put that over to the side for now because I still have this very fundamental question.

[12:38] How many people are working at Haggis Pimbal?

[12:40] How come we have not been shown a video of what production looks like?

[12:44] Why are we as a community so easily convinced that everything is going according to plan,

[12:50] that production has begun because we saw two out of eight cabinets being worked on.

[12:57] Two out of eight.

[12:58] I didn't see eight coin doors.

[13:00] I didn't see eight play fields on rotisserie is getting ready to be put into those cabinets.

[13:05] I didn't get a factory tour.

[13:06] I didn't get introduced to the people that are working there.

[13:09] So what if, right?

[13:10] Let's just play devil's advocate.

[13:11] What if Duck Pimbal flew over from Argentina and they spent the entire month just making these two games?

[13:19] Because where are the other games?

[13:21] Where's the line?

[13:22] If you really wanted to convince us that these games were on the line,

[13:25] that they were being built, that new games are going to be going out each week,

[13:29] they easily could have shown that.

[13:31] So then you got to ask the question, why didn't they show us any of that?

[13:34] Why was there no tour of the factory?

[13:37] Why was there no daily updates on them putting these games together?

[13:42] Why wasn't there?

[13:43] Look, and I'm just going to say it.

[13:45] I've seen these kinds of factory tours before.

[13:48] I've seen these kinds of videos before and you know the kinds of companies that have made these videos before.

[13:54] You know the videos I'm talking about, the videos to convince everybody that everything is going A-OK,

[14:00] that games are going into boxes, but that's not the real challenge for Haggis Pimbal.

[14:05] The real challenge for Haggis Pimbal is not their ability to make a game or two.

[14:10] The real challenge for them is to turn on a production line that can be profitable.

[14:16] I don't understand why nobody gets this.

[14:18] I don't understand why Canada's got to be the bad guy pointing this stuff out.

[14:23] We've heard from many people in the Pimbal world what Pimbal manufacturing looks like,

[14:28] what it requires.

[14:29] Now someone said to me like, not every Pimbal company creates a line to make their products.

[14:35] And I get that maybe not every Pimbal manufacturer has the traditional line, if you will, to make their products.

[14:41] But if they're going to build these things in more like a white glove bespoke fashion,

[14:47] is that big factory required?

[14:49] Like why all of that space?

[14:51] Why all of that room?

[14:53] But the one thing we've always seen whenever we see Pimbal production in motion,

[14:57] we have seen a line of games in which at each station more stuff goes on to the game.

[15:04] We've seen it at Spooky.

[15:05] We've seen it at Stern.

[15:06] We've seen it at JJP.

[15:08] We've seen it at CGC.

[15:09] So that's just the question that's burning inside of me right now.

[15:14] Is was this minute and 20 video enough for you to see to make up for nine months of delays?

[15:21] Was this video created specifically to show you just enough to get you still confident in handing over your money?

[15:30] Because remember, the next thing that's going to happen

[15:33] is many of you are going to be called up and asked to pay in full.

[15:38] Now, I'm not saying you're not going to get your game, but what I am saying is this.

[15:42] I still think we all should see more of what's happening over there from a production standpoint.

[15:50] I still think we deserve a tour of what is happening at Haggis Pimbal.

[15:55] You have to remember, this is a company that did that when they built Celts.

[16:00] So why are they not doing it now?

[16:02] How is that not a red flag for people out there?

[16:05] You saw two games out of eight.

[16:08] Two games.

[16:09] So what I don't get is this.

[16:11] If one game is completed and then the next game next to it, okay, what about game three?

[16:16] All right, four, five, six, seven, eight.

[16:19] Those are cabinets that are pretty much empty.

[16:21] There's nothing in them.

[16:23] So is that how they're going to do it?

[16:24] Like they're going to build one at a time or they're going to build five at a time or 10 at a time.

[16:30] Again, I don't know these things, but from what I'm seeing with the no words hashtag,

[16:36] I mean, the only thing I'm asking each and every one of you out there is you have to look at this stuff.

[16:41] You have to look at this stuff with a little bit more balance.

[16:44] And I wasn't able to do it yesterday because I was rushing to get the show out.

[16:48] And now that I've had more time to look at the video,

[16:51] I'm seeing stuff that still feels eerily similar to some of the videos Andrew Highway would put up.

[16:57] And again, I'm not saying this company is going to end up like Highway,

[17:00] but I'm seeing some of the eerily similar things.

[17:03] A lot of room, a lot of factory, a lot of parts, a lot of machinery and not many people.

[17:11] That makes me the most nervous.

[17:13] It really is the lack of personnel that makes me nervous.

[17:17] Like are just five people making these games?

[17:20] And here's the thing.

[17:21] Damien tomorrow could come out and say we have this many people on staff.

[17:26] Damien tomorrow could do a walkthrough of the factory, but he didn't.

[17:30] I'm going to tell you right now what's going to happen.

[17:32] They're going to ship that game to a customer and that customer is going to open up the game.

[17:37] And they're going to say, look, fathoms are shipping.

[17:39] I got my fathom.

[17:40] You don't need to worry.

[17:41] You're going to get your fathom.

[17:42] That's what's going to happen.

[17:43] You are not going to see a factory tour probably.

[17:46] You're not going to get answers to a lot of these questions.

[17:48] They want to control it like this.

[17:51] I think it's going to be very controlled.

[17:53] I think it's going to be very orchestrated how they release content around the creation

[17:57] of this game.

[17:58] And all I'm asking of Haggis Pimbald is this, just give us the same level of transparency

[18:04] that you did with Celts with fathom.

[18:07] Is it unfair of me to ask for that?

[18:09] They set the precedence on how they were going to be transparent and walk us through the

[18:14] production of each of their titles.

[18:16] And we're not getting at people a one minute and 20 second sizzle reel of two gorgeous

[18:22] and sexy games on the line with a bunch of empty cabinets surrounding them.

[18:28] That's all we need.

[18:29] Like that's all we need in 2022 to be convinced that everything is going A-okay.

[18:34] I don't know.

[18:35] Let me know if you think I'm being a jerk.

[18:37] Let me know if you think I'm raining on their parade, but I'm just seeing something that

[18:41] is just a little fishy.

[18:43] And I know pun intended, but I've seen this before people.

[18:46] Oh my gosh, you got to go back and look at some of the older videos that some of the

[18:50] companies put up when they wanted to convince us that everything was okay.

[18:54] And even in those videos, I mean it when I say it, Andrew Highway even showed way more,

[18:59] way more production than what we've seen yesterday.

[19:02] And yet yesterday's video is being applauded as like everything is great.

[19:07] Everything is going well.

[19:08] Nobody has anything to worry about.

[19:10] I don't know.

[19:10] I would have felt better if I saw eight cabinets fully populated.

[19:14] I just want to see more.

[19:15] All right, everybody, I know this is unpopular.

[19:18] I know some of you out there are going to be upset.

[19:20] You think I'm just being a negative Nancy, but I don't know.

[19:23] Go look at the video.

[19:24] You tell me that that factory looks like everything's turned on and manufacturing has

[19:28] begun and we're about to crank a bunch of fathoms out the door next week.

[19:32] You tell me you're seeing that when you look at the video.

[19:34] All right, everybody later put your comments in the comments section.

[19:37] Send me emails.

[19:38] Let me know what you think.

[19:39] I really want to know what you think on this one.

[19:42] Everybody have a great day.
