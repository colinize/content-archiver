[00:00] I can't believe what I'm looking at right now.

[00:09] I'm here to tell you right now I'm looking at the production line Arasa and games are

[00:13] shipping today.

[00:20] It's a beautiful sight.

[00:23] This game looks incredible.

[00:27] I wish I ordered one.

[00:34] Alright I was kidding.

[00:35] It's April Fools day.

[00:36] There are no Rasa shipping today.

[00:39] There is no imagery of the production line.

[00:41] Did I get you there for just a little bit?

[00:44] Now we should have heard and update by now and I want to go back and I want to read what

[00:50] we were told by Deeproot Pimball at the end of February.

[00:55] This is the line that has some of you who pre-ordered Rasa starting to feel a little

[01:02] nervous.

[01:03] They said we thank you again for your patience.

[01:09] We plan to update customers again by the end of March.

[01:14] Now it is April 1st.

[01:16] It is April Fools day or is Deeproot making fools of everybody who pre-ordered this game

[01:22] back in December.

[01:24] It is starting to look like that or will all of the haters in the thread be made to look

[01:29] the fool if this game comes out and skyrocket in price and becomes this amazing title.

[01:35] Everybody wants but only 150 people have.

[01:38] That's what people like Yulobird are hoping happens.

[01:41] That's why he paid in full for 2 back in December 20 thousand dollars.

[01:46] He gave Deeproot Pimball Yulobird back in December.

[01:50] He paid in full for the game to cut the line and be the first to get his Rasa.

[01:55] Imagine if Yulobird had bought Bitcoin back in December or had bought Game Stock.

[02:00] It goes on and on and on.

[02:01] They regret some of these gentlemen must have but if you have a lot of money I think these

[02:06] are the people who took the risk on this game.

[02:08] Here is the part that really doesn't make much sense to me.

[02:12] If you are going to say you will update your customers by the end of March did you forget

[02:19] that you said that and this is where it gets worrisome.

[02:23] If you are out there and you invested in this you really have no one to blame but yourself.

[02:27] This isn't some new company with a new person.

[02:31] Everyone knew what happened with Jpop.

[02:33] Everyone knew what Deeproot's delays were.

[02:35] It wasn't like you just stumbled into Pimball and put it a positive down because if you

[02:40] would just ask anybody right?

[02:42] If anyone asked the community is it a safe bet to invest in this game and should I pre-order

[02:48] it?

[02:49] You would have had like 80 people jump on your back and say what are you doing man?

[02:55] Don't do it.

[02:56] So look, end of March no update came.

[02:59] Now what I'm curious is what the reaction will be from the buyers of this game.

[03:04] I went into the Deeproot thread and I started to see some people in the owners thread that

[03:10] were saying they were going to get upset and be mad if they did not get an update by the

[03:15] end of March.

[03:17] So let's see if these gentlemen finally start to lose the patience that Deeproot Pimball

[03:24] has thanked them for in the past.

[03:27] Has the Suez Canal issue created a delay for Deeproot?

[03:31] What delay is around the corner for them?

[03:34] There have been many excuses but there are no games.

[03:37] I think people just want to see games but I think this is very indicative of what we've

[03:44] seen in the past.

[03:45] Isn't it starting to remind everybody of what went on with Highway Pimball?

[03:49] At least we saw a production line at Highway Pimball.

[03:53] At least we saw a production line at Dutch Pimball.

[03:57] Out of all the boutiques sort of not I won't even say like they're failures but they are

[04:01] failures out of all the boutique companies that really struggle to make Pimball product.

[04:07] At least we saw they had manufacturing.

[04:10] They ran out of money all those companies and they couldn't quite get it done.

[04:15] But with Deeproot we know they've spent a ton of money.

[04:19] We have never seen any manufacturing but now we think this outcome will be better this

[04:25] time around without even seeing any manufacturing.

[04:28] I don't understand how you come to that conclusion.

[04:31] I don't understand how you pre-ordered in fall, you low bird.

[04:35] I hope you get your games.

[04:37] You know someone said something to me.

[04:39] Someone said something to me.

[04:40] Some very prominent figure in the Pimball world said Chris you need to stop saying

[04:45] I hope they get their games.

[04:47] He said we should all be saying I hope they don't get their games because these people

[04:53] need to learn a lesson is what this person told me.

[04:56] And until people actually get burned and say it's over like you're not getting your

[05:02] razas ever.

[05:04] You're never getting your magic girl.

[05:06] John Papaduke has destroyed millions of dollars from this hobby and until people finally

[05:13] put the nail in the coffin and stop saying I hope you get your games people will never

[05:19] learn.

[05:20] So I don't know there's something to be said for that.

[05:22] Maybe that is what we all should be saying to these buyers of this game.

[05:26] But nobody wants to see anyone get ripped off.

[05:28] But there's nobody to blame but the buyers this time around.

[05:31] There's nobody to blame.

[05:33] We didn't know better in 2000 what what 2013 or 14 when John wheeled out and magic girl

[05:40] and raza and the trans lights we all got blinded by zombie Eddie's artwork.

[05:45] It was so beautiful how what possibly could go wrong.

[05:48] This was the great J pop and now we know now we know what kind of designer he is.

[05:55] He can't get it done.

[05:56] All right.

[05:57] Let's move on to a news item of the day.

[06:00] This is now the only pinball.

[06:02] No it's not the only pinball podcast giving you news.

[06:04] But here is something that I'm hearing that I think will excite you because the thing

[06:07] I've been thinking about as we get into this period of April is this it's been a while

[06:14] since stern revealed Led Zeppelin.

[06:17] So we definitely know he stern title is coming up in the next month or so.

[06:22] Now I can't help but think this would have been a great window for the other companies

[06:27] to release something if you're American pinball if your Chicago gaming company if your P3

[06:34] multi morphic if you're anybody anyone else out there who has a pinball product if you're

[06:40] a deep repim ball this would have been such a great window to release a product release

[06:46] it with non refundable deposits and get people games during this great spring window

[06:53] of pinball and guess what who's releasing a game right now when there's no stern games

[06:59] that are new nobody nobody and now I'm worried that when stern's next game comes out

[07:04] that's when the next companies are going to try to drop their products and I think it's

[07:09] silly because we all have such confidence that stern will get you the game quickly but man

[07:14] what a missed opportunity for all these other companies to take advantage of this window.

[07:20] Now speaking of what's next from who here is the news I'm here to tell you on canadus

[07:25] pinball podcast please attribute this to me if you go on pinside or if you have your show

[07:31] please say canada saying this so here's what I'm hearing spooky pinballs next game will

[07:37] be revealed in June of 2021 the new game that they will reveal in June of 2021 will not

[07:45] be tna 2.0 it might be part of it but it's not going to be the big reveal and I am hearing

[07:52] that it is a mainstream title and it is also based on a movie so spooky has learned

[07:58] its lesson it's not going to go after some obscure horror thing anymore this chuck and bug

[08:04] have seen the light with rick and morty sales they know where the excitement lies now what's

[08:10] exciting about this is this will be spooky pinballs first mainstream movie game and if you're

[08:17] going to try to create a pinball machine that excites people by the theme alone this is

[08:23] the way you do it like there's a reason why the majority of stern's games are movie

[08:28] related pins the majority of games over at jersey jack pinball are movie related pins

[08:34] they just sell really well because there are so many fans so what do you think the mainstream

[08:41] movie is that spooky pinball will make their game based on email me at canada pinball at

[08:49] gmail dot com and tell me what your thoughts are on what this theme could be is it night

[08:56] of the living dead is it still going to have some horror theme to it is it going to be

[09:00] Friday the 13th I don't know they're going to stay in that spooky realm I don't think

[09:04] so I really don't think so I think it's going to be something else but this also rules

[09:09] out future rama which is a theme that we've heard over and over again now I know spooky

[09:15] would have loved to have made a Godzilla movie themed game now here's the thing how bad

[09:23] did stern miss releasing godzilla right now because if you look at the world right now

[09:29] king Kong versus godzilla or godzilla versus king Kong this movie is huge the excitement

[09:36] for it is huge the box office numbers are huge the media coverage and the fanfare around

[09:43] this movie are huge these king of the monsters fighting it out are everywhere in pop culture

[09:49] they're everywhere in the media and it would have been such a smart move by stern pinball

[09:54] to release godzilla right now because they would be part of all this excitement because

[09:59] it's like godzilla mania is sweeping the globe and hey there's also even a new godzilla

[10:05] pinball machine available for all you godzilla fanatics it wouldn't matter that it's not

[10:09] based exactly on this movie because it's godzilla and the godzilla fandom is everywhere

[10:15] and so it's silly that if stern is making godzilla that they would delay it until sometime

[10:21] in the summer or the fall now I've been hearing that Brian Eddie's title is next but they

[10:26] might flip it and that and don't be surprised if stern does flip it we know that Brian

[10:31] Eddie's game is going to be a contemporary theme we know that zombie Eddie I believe

[10:36] is doing the art package for that game with Brian Eddie I don't know who the coder

[10:40] is on the Brian Eddie machine we know that it's going to be a layout more like the shadow

[10:45] that's what we know we know that Keith L one is working on godzilla and it's supposed

[10:49] to be packed it's supposed to be packed but you know what I'm not really sure now because

[10:55] I spoke to someone over at stern pinball after the twitties and they were saying like yeah

[11:01] if we have the bomb that jersey jack does it would be a different story now is like well

[11:07] what about godzilla they're like they're like we still design for profitability and that's

[11:12] the reality over at stern is profitability is the main thing they're trying to hit and

[11:18] they always hit it they're always making money on these games but they don't design to

[11:23] passion as much as they would like to and I'm hearing that from multiple people inside

[11:29] the walls of stern okay happy April fools day people sorry about that raza thing at the

[11:34] beginning hopefully you don't hate me and you still listen to canadus pinball podcast what

[11:38] else is going on in pinball so Chicago gaming company we continue to wait for cactus canyon now

[11:43] I was talking to mister ben heck a few days ago and I said Ben how's your game coming along and

[11:48] he's never going to tell me anything real about it but he's like and he said he doesn't think

[11:52] it's coming out to maybe late twenty twenty two now because of where things are with Chicago

[11:57] gaming company he said there is a remake next and then there will be an original game that

[12:04] is a licensed IP from Chicago gaming company and then Ben hex game so if you look at this

[12:11] it's almost like two years between launches I don't know if Ben hex game is even coming

[12:16] out in twenty twenty two to be honest I think we could see it in twenty twenty three which

[12:21] is unfortunate that Chicago gaming company is taking so long to remake a game that's already

[12:28] been made now when I was talking to Ryan white I got this sense that cactus canyon was

[12:33] sort of ready to go and they weren't quite happy with it and what I mean by that is not

[12:39] that there was any problems with it but they knew they could make it even better and

[12:43] even sweeter so I think that's what's happening I think what's holding it up now if you

[12:48] were to ask me will be stuff like can we make the top or better can we add any better

[12:52] scopes to this game sort of like they did with monster bash and obviously the code like

[12:57] I know they're improving the code on this game so are they looking at the code and saying

[13:02] can we even add more new stuff to get people excited with this game I do think when cactus

[13:07] canyon gets revealed and people see all the mechs in that game I think people are going to love

[13:12] it I think people are going to buy it I think this game is packed I think it's got a ton of toys

[13:17] and gimmicks which people love even though it's an original theme they're only trying to sell

[13:22] you usually like a thousand or fifteen hundred L's I think they'll sell everyone the real

[13:28] question I have is where do they price this game at right because if Jersey Jack Pimble just

[13:34] increased all of their prices by a thousand dollars if you're a Chicago gaming company and

[13:40] you're giving people this amazing topper as part of the game if you're doing all this

[13:45] stuff if you're redoing the code if you're redoing scopes how do you charge only what like

[13:50] nine thousand dollars for the game I fully expect to see a price increase of at least a thousand

[13:57] dollars by Chicago gaming company they be silly not to do it they must be looking at these

[14:02] medieval madness royal editions which they made four to five hundred of they're selling

[14:07] for fifteen thousand dollars and they're selling out immediately at that price they must be

[14:12] looking at pirates of the Caribbean selling for thirty forty thousand dollars and they're

[14:17] probably going to say like why are we leaving so much money on the table you do see this this

[14:21] new inbox pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition sold confirmed sale for thirty eight thousand

[14:29] dollars let me repeat that pirates of the Caribbean new inbox which was twelve five new just sold

[14:36] for thirty eight thousand dollars it might have been thirty eight five now let's let's deconstruct

[14:41] this for a bit thirty eight thousand dollars for a pirates of the Caribbean this is not an April

[14:48] full joke people I don't understand how anyone and I mean this anyone could value that game at

[14:55] that much money I don't get it it's indicative of where we are in this NFT culture of overpaying

[15:02] for everything right now people are overpaying for homes people are overpaying for video games people

[15:08] are overpaying for artwork people are overpaying for a lot and I hope all of these people who drive

[15:14] these prices to the moon understand that when you pay this much money for stuff I really have a

[15:21] hard time understanding how it would bring you satisfaction like how could you be satisfied knowing

[15:27] that you spent thirty eight thousand dollars on a pinball machine that two years ago was sitting

[15:33] at automated pinball in a box and nobody wanted it for an entire year they were sitting on

[15:39] pirates of the Caribbean C.E. for it twelve months and nobody wanted any of them you could have

[15:45] picked one up from Mike it automated any day for a twelve month period now if people didn't like

[15:52] the game then and the game sat then for an entire year why is it now thirty eight thousand dollars the

[16:01] game's not different the game's not any better all it is all it is is FOMO and rich men flexing and I

[16:10] am so happy that I don't feel any of that anymore in pinball I don't care I don't care to like try to

[16:18] show you that I have enough money to buy something for three times what it's worth no I don't care

[16:23] about that I don't care to own something at that price because think about it if you bought this game for

[16:29] thirty eight thousand dollars new in box right here's the one thing you can't do now you can

[16:34] unbox it if the moment you unbox a thirty eight thousand dollars new in box pirate C.E. you lose the

[16:41] real value of it that it's still in a box and then here's the sad part we're all gonna die so in

[16:47] a world in which we're all gonna die and the only reason to own any of these pinball machines is to

[16:53] play them and enjoy them how can you unbox it how can you play this game and how can you put

[16:59] wear and tear on something that you spent thirty eight thousand dollars on and someone said this it

[17:04] was Mr. Rare Hero he said that this company right now is experiencing its Tron Ellie moment and I

[17:12] believe him remember when Tron Ellie came out and all of a sudden they only made four hundred with

[17:18] the daft punk multi ball and and people didn't realize at the time that there would be such demand for

[17:24] the game so it sold for fifty seven hundred bucks okay and so what happened like a year later

[17:29] everyone realized how good Tron Ellie was and there were no more and they weren't making anymore

[17:34] and they weren't putting that daft punk multi ball mode into the premiums and what happened the

[17:39] prices of Tron tripled and the same thing you saw new in box trons were selling for fifteen thousand

[17:46] and everyone was trying to like cash out at such a high price and nobody would sell them okay so

[17:51] it seemed like a goodbye but then the bottom falls out and here's why the bottom falls out because

[17:56] more and more new games will come out that are better more and more new games are gonna come out

[18:01] from Jersey Jack Pimball that are better than Pirates of the Caribbean people are buying this game as

[18:06] if Jersey Jack Pimball is going away tomorrow they're not toy story will probably be a better game

[18:13] guns and roses is a better game Jersey Jack Pimball moving forward will continue to make better games

[18:20] so do I think Jersey Jack Pimball will remake Pirates and I've been thinking about this and the more

[18:25] I think about it it almost doesn't make any sense because I think never remaking Pirates again

[18:32] is actually the greatest marketing tool this company can have it does nothing but create more hype

[18:39] and enthusiasm for every new game they have coming out because this is what happens and this is

[18:44] what happened with Tron is once Tron Ellie established itself as is have to have game then everyone

[18:51] went in on the next Stern Ellie's and they started to sell out instantly remember everybody ran

[18:56] towards Avengers Ellie and said this is going to be the next Tron Ellie and what happened the game

[19:01] was kind of a dog and that's what happened at Stern is like people started to speculate on every

[19:07] single Stern Ellie and gobble all of them up and then you had games that just fell flat I don't

[19:13] know I don't know if Transformers was after that it might have been but you got this point where

[19:17] people realize this is not really sustainable we can't really do this we can't just buy up every

[19:22] single game and say this is the next collectible that everyone's going to want and it's going to keep

[19:27] going up and up and up in price and so now a Tron Ellie opened up with plays on it you're probably

[19:32] talking about 10 grand maybe nine grand and so the same thing will happen with pirates of the

[19:37] Caribbean CE as more great games come out from Jersey Jack Pimball and from Stern and from CGC

[19:45] and from American Pimball as more and more great games come out you are going to see these prices

[19:51] slide and the fools who paid the most I mean the fools who paid 35 or 38 or 30 for these games and

[19:58] 25 for an Ellie or 20 for an Ellie they're fools they're fools it is April fools day and

[20:03] congratulations you are fools because your prices those prices have nowhere to go but down there's

[20:09] no way these prices are going to continue to climb if you bought at that price okay but I don't

[20:15] think Jersey Jack will ever remake it now because think about it now everyone's going to run and buy

[20:21] out guns and roses CE everyone's going to run and buy out toy story CE Jersey Jack Pimball is the

[20:28] hottest pinball company right now they just took home nine twippies there's a reason why every new

[20:34] Jersey Jack Pimball release is the biggest moment in pinball each year because they just put more

[20:40] in the games and the excitement level around what JJP is doing is much higher than what's happening

[20:47] next at Stern because we know we know as great as Keith L. Wynne is as exciting it is to have Stern

[20:53] make so many games we all know that Stern will cut corners financially and won't put everything that

[20:59] they could into these games and Stern games for the most part are usually mechanically somewhat

[21:05] underwhelming considering what could be done if they really let their designers go crazy and over at

[21:12] JJP they invest more in their designers they invest more in the games and they had varying degrees

[21:19] of success with that some of the games have been hit some have been misses but no game is worth

[21:25] $38,000 no pin is even worth $20,000 I would say the ceiling for me of a pinball machine that's

[21:32] fully decked out that's limited I would say 15k is as much as I ever would want to spend on a pinball

[21:40] machine and I know I spent $23,000 on magic girl and I learned my lesson and I'll never do it again

[21:47] and I wish I had put that $23,000 into a million other investments other than a pinball machine

[21:53] because the other part is the only thing that makes it exciting owning these rare games is thinking

[21:59] about what their value might be when you sell it and then again you're gonna die you're not gonna

[22:04] want to play it when you look at these games through the lens of well what will the resale value be

[22:09] that's just the wrong way to look at this stuff it's really is it's not how we should look at

[22:13] anything like you should drive your car you should wear your nice Rolex every day you can you

[22:18] should put on your nice sports blazer every time you can because again we're gonna die so we

[22:23] should look as good as we can each day we should take care of ourselves and we should enjoy

[22:28] and drink that rare bottle of wine because if it just sits there what happens when you cross the

[22:33] street and you get hit by a bus tomorrow right enjoy all this stuff so when's the next game from

[22:38] American pinball gonna be this would have been a great window for American pinball to release

[22:43] their next game and nothing happening yet over at American pinball I'm a little bit confused

[22:48] because apparently this is from a junior designer and I think this has to be a game that was

[22:54] in development sometime before this year so when will we see the next game I write an interview

[22:59] with Michael Grant and I know that I always pick on this company because they're easy to pick on

[23:03] like Michael Grant said they're still getting orders for Houdini and October Fest let's deconstruct

[23:08] who the hell is still ordering Houdini and October Fest nobody he knows this you know it there's

[23:14] no reason anyone would pay new inbox prices for either one of those games because they're they're

[23:19] available all over the place for much less money so there's no way orders are flying in for those

[23:24] games at all I think hot wheels orders have also dried up there must be hardly any orders coming in

[23:31] at American pinball right now they need a new title they need to get excitement going David

[23:36] fix came out and said all this stuff on the super awesome pinball show where are the fruits of all

[23:41] of those statements are we gonna see it anytime soon where is he gonna go what podcast will David

[23:47] fix turn to now that saps is gone I was thinking about that between him and the pinball brothers

[23:53] now they might have to come to canate his pinball podcast hey and they should because you will reach

[23:58] the largest audience if you come on this show David fix and I would love to have David fix on

[24:02] the show I am going to invite David fix right now to come on canate his pinball podcast anytime you

[24:09] want David to talk about what the plans are over at AP I will be nothing but respectful and you will

[24:15] reach the largest audience I think it is the right move to make so let's see if David fix hits me

[24:21] up and takes me up on this offer okay the other thing I saw was that they are going to make Joe

[24:28] ball serves game number six still and I think it's a mistake I explain why am I last show if this

[24:34] company is moving forward and they moved away from Joe ball sir why would they still make a Joe

[24:39] ball serve game now you could argue like maybe it's an amazing game maybe but but but but still I

[24:44] think they need to make this company feel like it's the new American pinball not the old American

[24:50] pinball and so I want to see stuff from Dennis Nordman I want to see stuff from these junior

[24:55] designers I don't want to see stuff from Joe ball sir if Joe ball sir is no longer part of this

[25:00] company so let's see what happens over there they need to make license themes they need to utilize

[25:06] Roger sharp and get themes that people want they can't make these original games and be successful

[25:13] David fix Michael grant go get Akira go get Akira and make a thousand Akira's and charge 12 five for

[25:23] those thousand Akira's Akira and watch what will happen I guarantee you American pinball I challenge

[25:29] you American pinball I bet you I'll buy it right now I'll bet you $10,000 $10,000 if you make a

[25:37] cure a pinball American pinball if you make a cure a pinball you will sell out and you will sell

[25:43] everyone but you got to make a good like don't sandbag it like hot wheels if you make it they will

[25:48] come and it's one of those themes like Rick and Morty were I get it's Rick and Morty's more

[25:52] mainstream but people have no idea Akira's got 30 plus years of fandom all over the world people

[25:59] in Japan you would sell them all to the Japanese fans of of Kattoshiro Ultimo you would all the

[26:04] Akira fans in Japan alone would gobble these things up and the amount of Akira collectors out there

[26:09] in the anime space would gobble them up that's the kind of fandom this this property has I'm

[26:14] I'm gonna stop talking about it but you know how I feel without Akira my name's Kaneda that's where

[26:18] it comes from if you haven't seen Akira you should go watch it it's an amazing movie it's a work of

[26:22] art and this pinball machine would be a work of art okay so what else is going on in pinball anything

[26:26] from anywhere else nope here we go would have been a perfect time to release king pin not happening

[26:31] what's happening with that company I think we're gonna see king pin through American pinball I do

[26:36] I think that's one of the titles they're gonna make I think it would be smart again limit it run

[26:40] old game that had a lot of value remake it hey someone should be going after King Kong why is nobody

[26:46] making king Kong look how much people love king Kong this week right where is king Kong the

[26:52] daddy East King Kong sells for fifty thousand dollars that would be another great property to go

[26:57] get if Stern's got Godzilla then who's got King Kong I bet Stern also has King Kong I would it

[27:04] would be smart if they're talking to the you know to the folks who own these properties but that

[27:09] would be amazing I would love to see a king Kong based on the old black and white Kong movie and I

[27:15] would love like of like a sort of a throwback like nineteen twenties looking black and white gray

[27:22] scaled King Kong with the old school empire state building and just have it like all the airplanes

[27:27] going around the top of it and that's like a spinner that you hit how cool would that be I mean

[27:32] the mix would be amazing and it would just look so gorgeous and again King Kong King Kong can't

[27:37] be the most expensive thing to go get so if I'm American pinball I think there are so many things

[27:42] that they could ask Roger Sharp hey could we get this let's go get this let's go get this film

[27:47] that people love that everyone recognizes okay I think this has been it for my little April first

[27:53] version of Canadian pinball podcast everybody thank you again for all your votes it was really

[27:58] nice hanging out with you guys on Saturday and I will say this I will say this I think as I said

[28:03] in my last show I think we need the energy level of these shows to get up another notch I do think

[28:09] that Zach and Greg brought an energy to the twippies that most of us are missing and I've told

[28:15] this to Greg like they were great hosts and they had great chemistry and I missed that in Saturday

[28:21] evenings show and I think we need to figure out how to get that energy into the show and here's why

[28:27] because a lot of people a lot of people who are not die hard like us watched the show family members

[28:35] friends co-workers that we invited to check out the best in pinball and I don't care if there's

[28:41] feuding behind the scenes with all of these personalities ultimately if we want to be ambassadors

[28:47] to pinball and bring new people in and also just make pinball award show moments that are celebrating

[28:54] this thing that is so creative and so much fun then we need to put the best people forward to do it

[29:00] and if Zach and Greg have the best way to carry an award show because of their chemistry and banter

[29:04] and the way they do it then that's what I want to see more of it's not an endorsement of the pinball

[29:09] industry awards per se because I still believe that the best way to hand out awards is the public voting

[29:17] so that's the dilemma now is the twippies have the best mechanism the public votes is the best way to

[29:23] celebrate this industry because then all of us are part of it all of your votes count and we saw

[29:29] in the twippies that it matters more when these votes are coming from everyone and you've got

[29:34] thousands of people who love pinball and they get to determine what they feel is the best and I

[29:39] think that's the best system but how do we wrap that in a thing that's just as entertaining as

[29:45] the product itself and people have said you know canada you should be hosting some of these things

[29:49] and that's just me saying it but you know the energy on this show this is the kind of stuff you

[29:55] need to get people excited and carry them through a two hour show and that's all I'm going to say in

[30:01] the matter is I'm going into 2021 with it with an outlook like this I don't want to see all these

[30:07] major personalities continue to be at odds with each other I know sometimes I'm in the middle of that

[30:12] I know sometimes I create some of that drama I know sometimes as fans of this hobby it's annoying to

[30:17] see content creators like at odds with each other but here's the thing it's over right it's over like

[30:23] the twippies are over the pinball industry awards are over for last year it's a new year we have a

[30:29] vaccine there's new optimism there's new hope in the world we're all going to start to live new

[30:35] again so I hope moving forward we all can bury these hatchets and I'm going to let go of my anger

[30:41] I'm going to let go of some of my hostility towards people because you know what it's not going to

[30:46] get me anywhere I'm not going to wake up any happier if if I'm still mad that some of the people

[30:51] that talked smack about me didn't congratulate me winning the twippy that did eat me up for the

[30:57] last few days I'm like you talk so much smack about canada and then you won't even congratulate him

[31:03] on the victory you mean even Conor McGregor the biggest jerk in the world when he gets knocked out

[31:09] the first thing he does is he gets up and he shakes the hand of hobby he shakes the hand of Justin

[31:14] Portier he shakes the hand of the person who beats him and congratulates him so I was a little like

[31:19] annoyed by that that there still has been zero zero correspondence from from the super awesome

[31:26] pinball show to me and saying hey Chris congrats like well deserve nothing nothing but I have no

[31:31] bad blood moving forward I'm just saying I'm just saying April 1st as we move into the future I have

[31:35] absolutely no bad blood or hostility towards anybody let's figure out a way to all get along

[31:41] life is too short this hobby is too much fun and we have so many great personalities in this hobby

[31:47] that we all should find a way to get along and may all of the great energetic personalities start

[31:53] to work together on some of this stuff and I think it would be more fun for everybody okay everybody

[31:58] have a great April 1st we'll talk to you soon
