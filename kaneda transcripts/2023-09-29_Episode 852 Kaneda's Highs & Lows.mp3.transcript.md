[00:00] You want it all, but you can't let out the flow.

[00:06] I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said up.

[00:10] Aw, welcome everybody. Happy Friday. It's a rainy day here in New York City, and I'm the only guy on planet Earth that knows when pulp fictions are actually gonna get onto the line.

[00:20] Everybody, here's what we're gonna talk about. Never done this before.

[00:23] We've all been speculating about pinball prices. Have they gone crazy? Have they gone nuts?

[00:29] And you know how I always say, the numbers don't lie. 615 subscribers, six trippies.

[00:34] But the real numbers that don't lie are pinball prices and what they've sold for over the years.

[00:41] There's a lot of newbies in the hobby. You might be one of them. You might have been introduced to pinball during COVID.

[00:46] You might have been home. You might have had some money burning a hole in your pocket.

[00:50] You might have made some money with Dogecoin, and then you got into pinball.

[00:54] You spent a bunch of money on pinball. And to some of the newbies, they don't really understand why the rest of us are sort of pulling our hair out when we see these pinball prices.

[01:06] And the biggest thing is for most of us, the tragedy that every single new Stern LE is now 13K, the tragedy that every new Jersey Jack CE is $15,000, the tragedy that the mass produced premium is now $10,000.

[01:24] Now, what I'm going to do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I'm going to create a new segment no one's ever done before.

[01:29] It's going to be called Canada's High Low.

[01:32] We're going to look at some collectible games, and we're going to look at the prices in which these games sold for their highest prices on the pinside marketplace.

[01:42] And then we're going to look at the low price.

[01:44] What was the most affordable you could have got the game for other than MSRP?

[01:50] Now, before we do this, I want to cover off on a few news items.

[01:53] I saw the news that a magic girl or two is going to be sold at pinball expo.

[01:59] And as someone who's had the unlucky pleasure of owning a John Papadook magic girl, if these games are truly new in box, I would stay as far away from these two machines as you possibly could.

[02:13] I don't know if these things are going to have the update from our friends over in the Netherlands where they sort of made the game somewhat playable.

[02:21] But let me tell you this right now, as someone who's owned a magic girl, it's beautiful to look at.

[02:27] It's terrible in bed.

[02:28] And I've seen the videos of what they did to the game over in the Netherlands.

[02:33] It is still nowhere near a completed pinball experience.

[02:37] They made the stuff work, but it's not really a game, right?

[02:41] There's not like a storyline that's developing.

[02:44] There's really nothing to do.

[02:45] It's sort of like they figured out a way to make all the crazy stuff that John put on the play field.

[02:50] They figured out a way to turn it all on.

[02:53] But even when you turn it all on, it doesn't really make much sense.

[02:57] And now we know that these things are selling for like $25,000 to maybe upwards of $50,000 if you have the repair kit that's been installed over in the Netherlands.

[03:08] And I just want to say this.

[03:09] You got to really look in the mirror and you got to ask yourself, why do I even want to own this thing?

[03:15] The only reason to own a magic girl, the only reason there's only one is you want to be somebody that has something that nobody else has.

[03:23] But let me tell you right now why that's not even fulfilling.

[03:26] Because when you do have a magic girl and you show other people you have a magic girl, they're not impressed.

[03:32] They will never find much enjoyment out of the machine itself.

[03:36] And we could never really forget how many people John Papadouk burned just to make those magic girls that American pinball spit out into the world.

[03:45] And it's still crazy to me that David Fix is promoting this game.

[03:50] You know, this company just keeps making every boneheaded move one after another.

[03:54] How are you going to promote a magic girl and celebrate its arrival at your pinball show when you know all too well what a boondoggle this game represents?

[04:05] What this thing did to you financially over at American Pinball?

[04:09] And once again, it just reinforces for me how clueless they are over in the marketing department across the board with so many of these pinball companies.

[04:18] Now, I did get a nice note from Luke over at Spooky.

[04:21] He said, Chris, I heard what you said on your last podcast and you may see some of that stuff come to fruition when we reveal our next game.

[04:30] So, Luke, thanks for reaching out.

[04:31] I've always said it.

[04:32] These are good guys.

[04:33] It's a good company.

[04:34] It's a good family.

[04:35] And whether or not you like Spooky's games or not, you can't deny the fact that they're just really good people.

[04:40] So, Luke, love you, brother.

[04:41] Thanks for reaching out.

[04:42] All right.

[04:43] So we've got magic girls going to Expo.

[04:45] Oh, man, what an Expo it's going to be.

[04:47] Magic girl and a new game from Pinball Brothers.

[04:49] So what do we think that game is going to be?

[04:51] I think there's a high likelihood that Pinball Brothers game is going to be Dracula.

[04:56] Brian Allen is doing the artwork on the remake on Brian Allen's website.

[05:01] He says that Dracula Translight is coming soon.

[05:05] So that's the next thing he's going to drop into the world.

[05:08] Is that his way of teasing in plain sight what the remake game is going to be over at Pinball Brothers?

[05:15] I don't know.

[05:16] I don't know.

[05:17] You know, Dracula, how well would it sell?

[05:18] It's not really the most popular game.

[05:20] It has one of the coolest features in the history of Pinball.

[05:23] When the magnet grabs the ball and carries it across the play field.

[05:27] Isn't it crazy?

[05:28] Like 30 years ago, they could do creativity like that.

[05:32] And now we're spending $13,000 on pinball machines that don't even do anything nearly as magical as that in the gameplay experience.

[05:41] We need to wake up everybody.

[05:43] And you're going to get a wake up call right now when I do this high low thing because you're going to see how inane it's been over the last few years.

[05:51] All right.

[05:51] What else is going on in pinball?

[05:53] I'll tell you what's not going on just yet.

[05:55] Pulp Fictions.

[05:56] Now they're supposed to go on the line in October.

[05:59] Guess what next week is October?

[06:02] What do you think the odds are that we're actually going to see Pulp Fiction Machines rolling off the line at Chicago Gaming Company?

[06:10] For some reason, Chicago Gaming Company just went from this company that used to execute pretty efficiently into this delays after delays after delays.

[06:21] And I know for a lot of you out there, what's interesting about my last show, I was thinking about this.

[06:26] Imagine if seven new games actually do come out between now and the end of the year.

[06:32] And then you get hit up to pay for your maybe Cactus Canyon or you get hit up to pay for your Scooby-Doo or you get hit up to pay for your Pulp Fiction.

[06:41] It's like a lot of us have some deposits down on games that were revealed a very long time ago.

[06:47] And some of you just had to write a check for Godfather, Collector's Edition, My Condolences, You Just Lost $2,000.

[06:54] But do we really feel like Chicago Gaming Company is going to execute on the timeline?

[06:59] And the timeline was this.

[07:00] The standard edition versions of this game were supposed to go on the line in October.

[07:05] Will we see that?

[07:06] And then the le version of the game is supposed to be on the line in February.

[07:11] Now my question is why?

[07:13] Like why is there such a delay between the standard edition and the le's?

[07:18] And it's basically the same game.

[07:20] Like if you were to yank out a Pulp Fiction playfield from an le machine and a standard edition machine, it is the same exact thing you'd be holding in your arms.

[07:29] So why wouldn't they just make the le's first?

[07:31] Just get those thousand le's out the door, get the toppers ordered.

[07:36] My big fear is that stuff like the topper is going to get delayed.

[07:40] We saw this with Cactus Canyon.

[07:42] It only takes one part to be delayed and then they can't make any of the games or ship them to customers.

[07:48] Alright, are you ready for the first ever original segment by Canada's Bimbal Podcast in a very long time?

[07:54] Canada's High Low.

[07:55] Let's look at some collectible games.

[07:57] Let's look at the date in which they sold the month and the year.

[08:02] And then let's look at the price.

[08:04] Now I just want to do some caveats here.

[08:06] I tried to remove games that were just being sold by distributors for MSRP.

[08:11] You know, that doesn't really count.

[08:12] I'm trying to capture prices over the last like two to three years.

[08:16] And I think almost all of these games came out before like the COVID bubble started.

[08:21] And you're going to see something interesting.

[08:23] It's really that year in 2021, right?

[08:26] End of 2021 into early 2022 is when the insanity hits this hobby.

[08:33] And the moment it hit, it hit like a tsunami and it washed over everything.

[08:38] I'm just going to give you about maybe like 10 pinball machines, maybe a little bit less.

[08:42] And we're going to go into the prices.

[08:44] But that tsunami washed over more than just these games.

[08:47] Everything was going up in value.

[08:49] Every single old Valley Williams machines.

[08:52] People were spending like four or $5,000 on Baywatches.

[08:55] That banning auction was really the lowest point in the history of pinball collecting

[09:00] because people were spending fortunes on machines that weren't worth anything.

[09:04] Like people were buying Flintstones machines for like $8,000 and the world just went bonkers.

[09:10] So let's start out right now our journey with Godzilla Limited Edition.

[09:15] Now look, I'm going to say this Godzilla Limited Edition was the last great buy you will ever get from Stern directly.

[09:23] It was loaded.

[09:24] It had all the assets.

[09:25] It was Keith Elwin.

[09:27] It's got everything you want in a pinball machine and they deemed the price of Godzilla to be $10,500 and they made a thousand L.E.s.

[09:37] And if you got one for that price, you might as well just hold on to it because at the peak, as you're going to see at the peak,

[09:44] you made a fortune on this machine and now it's coming back down to earth.

[09:48] So the high for Godzilla sales.

[09:51] Are you ready for this?

[09:52] A game that was new in box $10,500.

[09:56] The highest sale for this game was the 25th of November of 2022.

[10:02] A new in box example of Godzilla L.E. sold for $24,000.

[10:09] Now look, I know some of these prices.

[10:11] I don't know the final sale price, but right around here, $24,000.

[10:17] Someone spent $13,500 more on a new in box Godzilla and this was after the game was out.

[10:25] Now what's crazy about this is that's the price of two Godzilla L.E.s.

[10:30] Now the low for Godzilla is still going to be the price Stern sold it to you for.

[10:35] But the lowest I can see for a Godzilla L.E. that traded hands on the secondhand market was in November of 2021.

[10:44] See, this was right before the COVID madness hit and right before that someone sold a Godzilla L.E. for $12,000.

[10:53] Not a bad deal, right?

[10:55] The guy made $1500 profit.

[10:57] That feels like a quick flip, right?

[10:59] Someone made $1500 and someone bought it.

[11:02] I flipped my Godzilla L.E. I got $16,000 for it.

[11:06] I made $5,500 selling a Godzilla L.E.

[11:11] Those were the good old days, people.

[11:13] All right, here we go.

[11:14] Ready for some craziness?

[11:15] We're about to get crazy on Canada's Pinball Podcast with special guest, Canada.

[11:19] All right, here we go.

[11:20] In February of 2023, a Stranger Things L.E. sold for $18,900.

[11:30] $18,900.

[11:33] Now, are you ready to cry?

[11:35] Are you ready to wish you had a DeLorean to go back in time?

[11:38] In August of 2020, the year the game came out, the cheapest you could get a Stranger Things L.E. was $7,500.

[11:48] And there were a lot, and I mean this, a lot of Stranger Things L.E.'s to be had in the $7,000 range.

[11:57] This game, I think, was like $8,500 or $9,000 new, new in box, and nobody wanted it because the code was so bad.

[12:06] The projector didn't show well at CES.

[12:08] I was there.

[12:09] I remember it.

[12:10] And this game has done a 180.

[12:12] The UV kit wasn't available yet.

[12:14] But man, think about that for a minute.

[12:16] This is the same game.

[12:18] People are willing to spend $11,400 more than you used to be able to get the game for just three years prior.

[12:29] More like two years later, right?

[12:32] From 2020 to 2023, Stranger Things has gone up $11,000.

[12:38] That's insanity, people.

[12:40] All right, are you ready for another game?

[12:42] Ghostbusters Limited Edition.

[12:45] In a minute edition, I was there too when Ghostbusters came out.

[12:48] I bought one.

[12:49] I flipped one.

[12:50] It was like easy to make a couple thousand dollars, and that's the part people forget.

[12:54] When we scalped machines back in the day, we took our $1,500 or $2,000, and it was a win-win.

[13:01] I was happy.

[13:02] The buyer was happy.

[13:03] We didn't buy a Stern L.E. for $8,000 and then listed for $16,000.

[13:09] That's what's changed about the pinball market now.

[13:13] Everybody is so crazy greedy, and the freaking manufacturers saw that, and now they're pricing everything like they are the scalpers.

[13:22] So Ghostbusters L.E.

[13:24] This is crazy.

[13:25] In February of 2022, the middle of the COVID madness, someone bought a new and box Ghostbusters L.E. for $26,999.

[13:38] $27,000 for a Ghostbusters L.E.

[13:42] New and box.

[13:43] What a stupid buy.

[13:44] I'll tell you right now, because everybody knows those Ghostbusters L.E.s all had playfield issues, and Stern had to replace all of those playfields because of ghosted inserts.

[13:55] But if you bought it in 2022, there's no way Stern was going to sell you a fully populated new Ghostbusters.

[14:03] And the person who bought this was clearly a newbie, because anyone who was around long enough knows that you don't even want to touch a Ghostbusters L.E. new and box.

[14:12] You would have wanted someone to unbox it, change the playfield out from Stern fully populated.

[14:19] That machine has much more money, and this one for $27,000 didn't even come with the freaking topper.

[14:25] Okay, but now are you ready to cry?

[14:27] Because three years prior to that, in June of 2019,

[14:31] guess what a Ghostbusters L.E. sold for?

[14:34] A home use only one.

[14:35] Are you ready?

[14:36] Not $27,000, a home use only Ghostbusters L.E. could be had for $6,600.

[14:44] Let me repeat that.

[14:46] $6,600 in June of 2019.

[14:51] And you're telling me here we are, now people want $18,000, they want $27,000.

[14:57] It's absolutely ridiculous.

[14:59] If this doesn't make you feel like what has happened to our hobby, I don't know what will.

[15:05] And remember when a Ghostbusters topper was $500, that's how much it was brand new.

[15:10] In January of 2021, this is when the scalping was crazy, it was COVID time.

[15:15] Someone sold one for $2,500.

[15:18] And if you go look at that pin side thread in 2021, when someone listed it for $2,500, it was like 39 downvotes.

[15:26] Everyone was just shocked that a topper could cost a third the price of a game.

[15:32] And here we are people.

[15:34] How much do you think a Ghostbusters topper would go for today?

[15:37] You couldn't even get one for $2,500 now.

[15:40] Now people would put it up for $5,000.

[15:43] And you know what's nuts is these rich newbies would actually consider it.

[15:48] They actually would consider it.

[15:50] All right, let's move on to the craziness.

[15:52] How about Batman Super Limited Edition?

[15:56] You know, if you were around when I was around this game came out around like 2016, 2017, it came out in 2016.

[16:04] And when Stern launched it in 2016, and a little lesson for all these newbies out there who think they know what's going on in Bimbal,

[16:11] Stern priced it at $15,000.

[16:14] And there was a lot of uproar that Stern would sell a game for that much money.

[16:19] And they were selling it directly.

[16:21] They were cutting out the distributor.

[16:23] And the way you had to get one was you had to submit a video on why you deserve to own one.

[16:29] It was a crazy time and everybody lost their minds.

[16:33] Everybody was like, how dare you first ask me to spend so much money?

[16:37] And how dare you make me beg for the ability to give you $15,000?

[16:42] And this was the first time too when Stern pulled the fast one.

[16:45] They said there was only going to be 50 of them to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Batman 66.

[16:51] And then what happened?

[16:52] They saw the crazy demand for it and they said, hey, we're actually going to make 80 of them.

[16:57] We're going to celebrate 50 years of Batman and 30 years of Stern Pimbal.

[17:02] And that is it.

[17:03] 80 machines exclusive with the topper and the beautiful art package by Christopher Franchi.

[17:08] So right now we are living in the height of Batman SLE collectability.

[17:14] And it's not surprising, right?

[17:16] Because as all of these mundane alleys come out where there's a thousand of them and there's $13,000,

[17:22] they're not really special.

[17:23] And with only 80 out there and Stern has the largest collector community,

[17:29] you best believe that the shiniest and most beautiful game Stern has ever made,

[17:34] which is Batman SLE, is going to go up and up in price.

[17:38] So the highest recorded sale I can find for a Batman SLE is in January for $32,000.

[17:46] Now, if you could take a time machine and go back to August of 2017, this is after the game's been out.

[17:53] The cheapest Batman SLE that was sold was for $12,999, $13,000.

[18:02] So you went from being able to get a game for $13,000.

[18:06] And now if you want that same game, you've got to spend $32,000.

[18:12] Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition.

[18:15] The highest recorded sale, and I feel bad for whoever bought this game for this price,

[18:19] was September of 2021.

[18:22] And remember again, December 2021.

[18:25] We're in that COVID period.

[18:27] The game just got released, right?

[18:29] It came out in 2021.

[18:31] People went ape for this game.

[18:33] All they needed was the internet to get people excited.

[18:35] The highest recorded purchase for this game is $25,000.

[18:41] Now, that was a new in-box game.

[18:43] Nowadays, you can easily get a Guns N' Roses CE for $14,000, right?

[18:49] $11,000 less, and you have the same exact game.

[18:53] That's the thing I didn't mention at the beginning of this.

[18:55] All of these people, whether you spend $27,000 on a Ghostbusters,

[19:00] or you spend $6,600,

[19:03] all of these people are having the same exact experience with that game.

[19:09] Nobody who spent more is having more fun.

[19:12] Nobody who spent more is getting loaded up with all these mods and exclusive toppers.

[19:17] No, this is what's so weird,

[19:19] is people are spending so much more and not getting anything more in return.

[19:24] And again, it's another reason why I don't like these high MSRP prices.

[19:28] Is Venomeli at $13,000 a 25% better game than Godzilla for $10,500?

[19:36] Is it 30% more fun?

[19:38] No, this is why more and more, we should just keep hitting pause.

[19:41] Just wait, this dust will settle.

[19:43] Yeah, so Guns N' Roses in April of 2023, $13,000.

[19:47] I think GNR is just a falling knife.

[19:49] I think Jersey Jack has cut bait on it.

[19:52] And I think maybe way down the road.

[19:54] The only way Guns N' Roses is ever going to go up in value is if Jersey Jack pinball goes out of business,

[20:00] and then everything will go up in value.

[20:02] All right, speaking of Jersey Jack and machines,

[20:04] in December of 2021, again, the COVID craziness,

[20:08] someone paid for a new inbox,

[20:10] hired to the Caribbean Collectors Edition.

[20:12] They paid, wait for it, they paid.

[20:15] And before I tell you this price, I got to tell you one story.

[20:18] When this game came out, it sat at distributors for a year.

[20:22] Nobody wanted it.

[20:24] These things sat at automated for a year.

[20:27] They were $12,500 from Jersey Jack.

[20:30] Everybody listening right now could have bought three of these machines,

[20:34] and you still would have saved money on what one unit went for in December of 2021.

[20:41] Someone paid $39,000 for a Pirates of the Caribbean new inbox.

[20:48] In July of 2019, two years prior to that, basically,

[20:53] someone bought one for $14,775.

[20:57] Wow.

[20:58] Look at that.

[20:59] $25,000 more for the same exact game just two years later.

[21:08] Canada, you shouldn't be doing this.

[21:10] You shouldn't be reminding people that all of our hysteria is documented

[21:15] and real and validated by these numbers.

[21:18] Pinball has lost what made it so special.

[21:21] The greed is everywhere.

[21:23] It is absolutely everywhere.

[21:25] There is no way a Pirates of the Caribbean is a $39,000 pinball experience.

[21:29] And there is no way you should pay a premium for a new inbox one,

[21:32] because once you open up that cardboard box,

[21:35] that box is now a $9,000 piece of trash that you're just going to throw away.

[21:41] This isn't like some woman you're going to marry who's a virgin.

[21:44] It's a freaking pinball machine, people.

[21:46] Let's keep going.

[21:47] This is fun.

[21:48] I love doing this.

[21:49] So the next one is Tron Limited Edition.

[21:52] I feel like Tron LE was the game that started it all.

[21:55] It was the game that back in the day, when it came out,

[21:59] you didn't have to pull the trigger right away.

[22:01] You didn't have to go nuts.

[22:03] You had the crappy Stern Photoshop artwork,

[22:06] but it had something almost no Stern has had since.

[22:09] It had no premium.

[22:11] So you had an LE that had the fiber optic lights on the ramps and everything.

[22:16] You had the Daft Punk multi-ball that the pro did not have.

[22:19] So there was a real reason why if you bought an LE,

[22:23] you actually had a different pinball experience.

[22:27] And for that reason, I think Tron came out.

[22:30] It was like $5,700.

[22:32] And this was really the first game that after it came out, slowly over time.

[22:37] It didn't happen overnight.

[22:38] Slowly over time, people started to realize what an awesome game it was.

[22:43] And then they started to trade for like $7,000, $8,000.

[22:47] And then once it hit that $10,000 period,

[22:50] for all you newbies trying to create pinball media,

[22:53] this is where like 10K by Christmas came from.

[22:56] Everybody started to realize, oh my gosh, I could buy a pinball machine,

[23:00] play it, and double my money.

[23:03] This is the very origin of all of this.

[23:06] And it's fascinating.

[23:07] And it's also fascinating because Tron did it with no premium.

[23:11] And now everybody's trying to do it,

[23:13] even though there's the premium of every single machine.

[23:16] Like why would you spend so much money?

[23:18] Same thing with Batman SLE.

[23:20] I'm not going to defend it even though I own it.

[23:22] It's the same exact experience.

[23:23] Like some dude who is buying a Batman premium for like 9K

[23:28] is having just as much fun as someone who buys that machine for $32,000.

[23:34] So a new in-box Tron LE sold,

[23:37] and remember this was like 5,700 bucks new,

[23:39] sold in September of 2022 during the COVID period,

[23:43] new in-box for $26,000.

[23:47] In May of 2018, you could have got a Tron for $8,800.

[23:53] That's the lowest price I could find on Pinside Marketplace.

[23:57] And that's a huge, huge difference of almost $18,000 more.

[24:02] I want to bring up this game.

[24:03] The next one is Lord of the Rings LE.

[24:05] Because as much as we've been looking at these crazy spikes and jumps and prices,

[24:10] there still are some deals out there.

[24:12] There still are some games out there that haven't gone through the roof,

[24:15] even though those games are far superior games.

[24:18] Lord of the Rings LE is a much better game than Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition.

[24:24] It's a much better game.

[24:25] I even think Lord of the Rings is a better game than Tron.

[24:28] It's a way better game than Ghostbusters, which shoots like a dog.

[24:32] I don't think you can have a better pinball experience other than long ball times,

[24:36] but just remove the outlaying post.

[24:38] You cannot have a better experience than Lord of the Rings.

[24:41] It's got the best mechs, the best toys, the best theme integration.

[24:45] It's got everything you want.

[24:46] It is super easy to understand how to play it,

[24:49] but it also has a lot of depth in the game.

[24:52] I owned that game for two years and I loved every minute of it.

[24:55] Lord of the Rings LE, November of 2022, sold for $13,000.

[25:02] That was kind of like the high.

[25:04] There have been some other ones where people like Gold played at their machines

[25:07] and engraved them and sold them for $20,000,

[25:10] but I don't want to count those because that's kind of unfair.

[25:13] I need to remove those from this data analysis.

[25:16] Then the lowest I could find for Lord of the Rings LE, June of 2016, $6,300.

[25:24] That's a good deal.

[25:25] $6,300. That's cheaper than a freaking Stern Pro right now.

[25:30] That game actually had a real mirrored back glass that would break if you dropped it,

[25:36] not like the new crap you get.

[25:38] Let's do a few more.

[25:39] Then I'm going to go have lunch with my beautiful wife.

[25:41] She's saying, wrap it up, Chris.

[25:42] We got to go get some Iron Chef, more Modos, ramen from Momentsan.

[25:46] Let's do a few more of these.

[25:48] Let's do Oktoberfest, everybody's favorite game.

[25:51] The highest price ever paid for an Oktoberfest, April of 2022, $8,300.

[25:57] The lowest price for an Oktoberfest in the middle of COVID, right at the beginning of COVID,

[26:02] 2019 of November, $5,300.

[26:05] Well, it just goes to show you though, with American Pimball games, they never really move anywhere.

[26:10] They didn't go anywhere up.

[26:11] They just kind of stayed in this, do I really want one?

[26:14] Not really.

[26:15] I think it's testament.

[26:16] If you're going to start a Pimball company, you need at least to make a game that goes somewhere north.

[26:21] The demand just keeps building and building and building because people realize it's a great game.

[26:26] Let's take Houdini, for example.

[26:28] In April of 2022, Houdini was $8,000 firm from a distributor.

[26:34] That's the most amount of money Houdini has ever cost.

[26:37] A Houdini has never, ever, ever gone up in value.

[26:41] You know where it has gone?

[26:43] It's gone down in value.

[26:44] In June of 2020, right, 2020 in June was like right around that COVID period, Houdini sold for $4,800.

[26:53] $4,800.

[26:55] $8,000 new.

[26:57] You bought it.

[26:58] You just lost $3,200.

[27:01] Doesn't that make you feel good?

[27:03] Doesn't that make you want to buy a Galactic Tank Force?

[27:06] We're going to see that game lose even more value eventually.

[27:09] Here's the one where it just annoys me.

[27:11] I'm going to end on this one because I think this is so indicative when we look at the timeframe.

[27:16] We look at the game.

[27:17] We look at who's buying these things.

[27:19] It's just ruined this hobby.

[27:22] This is just more proof that this hobby has been soiled a lot.

[27:26] There's a black cloud hanging over Pimball.

[27:29] So remember when Jersey Jack announced the Yellow Brick Road edition of Wizard of Oz?

[27:35] I was there.

[27:36] He did it at TPF.

[27:37] He took out the monkey mechanism.

[27:39] He announced he was making another edition of Wizard of Oz after the Emerald City, after the Ruby Red edition.

[27:46] And now we've got a third limited edition game.

[27:49] And it was the worst market it released ever because he goes, this game is limited and we are not going to tell you how many we're going to make.

[27:57] And right there, you're like, wow, Jack Guinari is kind of like a snake oil salesman to release a game like that.

[28:04] How are you going to say something is limited and then not say what the limit is?

[28:08] And that's the kind of BS that has been given to the Pimball buying community.

[28:13] And that's why Canade is number one because when he says something like that, nobody pushes back.

[28:18] Everybody just like, oh, let's interview Jack.

[28:20] Let's just say how great he is.

[28:21] Let's just say how great the next games are going to be.

[28:23] And you're like, wait a minute, that is disingenuous marketing.

[28:27] And I called him out on it.

[28:28] And so did other people as I started to call them out on it.

[28:31] And remember, like people laughed this game off the stage.

[28:34] They laughed this game off the stage because he removed Mechs from the game and then he charged more money.

[28:40] He put a $12,500 price tag on it and these games sat.

[28:46] And then what happens?

[28:47] COVID happens.

[28:48] Everybody's stuck at home.

[28:50] Everybody's just discovering Pimball.

[28:52] Do you think someone who was in the audience when Jack Guinari released this game for 12-5 and laughed in his face?

[29:00] Do you think someone who witnessed that in April of 2021, April Fool's Day for all these newbies,

[29:06] a Wizard of Oz Yellowbrick Road edition sold for $19,000?

[29:12] Sheld out for a game that we laughed off of the stage when we had the right context of what a ripoff the game was.

[29:20] And this is really indicative.

[29:22] And look, in January of 2020, right before COVID hit, right?

[29:27] January 2020, right?

[29:29] This is the year before a Wizard of Oz Yellowbrick Road was sold for $9,300.

[29:34] And that's it in a nutshell, people, in just a one-year period of time.

[29:38] A one-year period of time we go from something being $9,000 to $19,000.

[29:45] What has happened?

[29:46] Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

[29:49] And I hope these numbers are sobering.

[29:51] I hope they wake everybody up.

[29:53] This isn't fun.

[29:54] This isn't what Pimball should be.

[29:56] These games shouldn't be having this kind of quick explosion because what goes up must come down.

[30:03] And now we've got all these companies in 15 games a year and everybody thinks they're going to be getting $10,000 to $13,000 from us from every single new game.

[30:13] The problem is all these wankers over at the Pimball companies, they're now pricing all of their games after they've gone through the crazy COVID price inflation.

[30:22] And they think they're going to sustain that?

[30:24] They think they're going to sell thousands and thousands of games at $13,000 a pop, $15,000 a pop?

[30:30] It's never going to happen.

[30:31] So all of this, all of this, and all of this analysis, you know what this just makes me want to do?

[30:37] Just wait on the sidelines even more.

[30:39] And that is the one thing they don't want you to do.

[30:42] Because think about it, if you wait, what's going to happen?

[30:44] The prices are going to come down.

[30:46] The markets are going to get softer.

[30:47] People are not going to be able to sell their used games.

[30:50] And hey, if they want to sell them, they're going to have to lower the prices.

[30:53] And why can't the manufacturers feel some of that pressure?

[30:56] If you want to sell me a Godfather's CE, you think I'm going to give you $15,000 for a Godfather's CE when a stranger things with 7,500 bucks?

[31:06] When a Ghostbusters LE was $6,600.

[31:09] All these games are better than Godfather's CE.

[31:12] You think I'm going to give you that when Batman SLE was $12,999?

[31:17] Guns N' Roses CE was $13,000.

[31:19] Pirates was $14,000.

[31:22] You want me to give you that when a Lord of the Rings LE was easy to get for $6,300?

[31:27] You want me to spend $9,000 more on a Godfather's CE?

[31:33] Everybody, I love you.

[31:34] Thank you for being a club member.

[31:36] Time to take the beautiful wife to a nice lunch.

[31:38] Everybody, have a great weekend.

[31:40] Reminder, no Saturday morning spectacular until Saturday, October 21st.

[31:47] Alright, Canada and his special guest, Canada, are signing off.

[31:51] Everybody, have a great day later.

[32:17] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:19] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:21] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:23] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:25] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:27] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:29] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:31] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:33] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:35] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:37] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:39] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:41] I'm going to get my money back.

[32:43] I'm going to get my money back.
