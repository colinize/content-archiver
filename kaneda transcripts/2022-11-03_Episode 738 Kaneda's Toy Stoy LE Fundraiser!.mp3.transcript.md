[00:00] Oh, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:14] Okay, so we're going to do a fundraiser.

[00:16] We're going to do a fundraiser this Saturday morning during the spectacular.

[00:19] Our goal is to reach $201.

[00:23] Here's the reason why we're going to raise $201.

[00:26] I'm going to give that money to all of these people listing their Toy Story LEs for $10,200.

[00:35] I'm going to give them $201 so they can list Toy Story LE for $9,999.

[00:42] What is it with this game?

[00:44] What is it with this game where people are afraid to actually drop the price below $10,000?

[00:51] We're going to talk about that.

[00:52] We're also going to talk about an email I got from Peter G. asking if I think the three-tiered

[00:57] model is dead in pinball or dead for everyone else but stern pinball.

[01:02] Let's start with this Toy Story LE.

[01:04] But before I get there, I forgot something.

[01:06] Ed Robertson hit me up.

[01:08] Ed reminded me on the show before the last show, I said something during the end of the

[01:14] show that as I was speaking, I said, Ed, I know you're about to text me right now to

[01:18] hang it up.

[01:19] You're not having fun anymore.

[01:20] And that's all he texted me.

[01:22] So I forgot I said that and he reminded me yesterday.

[01:26] He said, Chris, I simply texted you what you said I was going to text you.

[01:31] Ed, I love you.

[01:32] I love that I have you fact checking Canadian Pinball podcast.

[01:36] But it's super awesome that we got people like Ed Robertson as members of the Canada

[01:40] Club, people like Jack Danger, members of the Canada Club.

[01:43] Okay, everybody, are you ready?

[01:44] Let's talk about this game.

[01:46] What price do you think Toy Story LE will sell for in the near future?

[01:51] So we've got this game now listed at $10,200.

[01:55] One of them is listed by Greg Bone.

[01:57] One of them is listed by another individual.

[01:59] I just want to say, I don't have a problem with Greg listing this game.

[02:02] Like it's weird that thread that he's listing this game on for a sale.

[02:06] He got into it with Flinnie Bus and it's just like, don't even listen to what Flinnie Bus

[02:11] is saying.

[02:13] He's just a man trying to sell a game.

[02:15] The real story here is not who's selling this game and whether or not he got preferential

[02:20] treatment from Zach.

[02:22] That's not the story.

[02:23] The story here is nobody wants it.

[02:26] Nobody wants to buy this game from one of the dudes who's one of the most reputable guys

[02:29] in the entire hobby.

[02:31] And so let's talk about at what price do we think a Toy Story LE will sell?

[02:36] See here's the problem.

[02:37] Here's the problem.

[02:38] It's at $10,200 right now and nobody wants it.

[02:40] But here's the real problem.

[02:42] You're still making more of these games every single day.

[02:46] You know what's on the line right now at JJP?

[02:49] It's not even Toy Story Collectors editions.

[02:52] It's more Toy Story LEs.

[02:54] The reason why the CEs are delayed is they're waiting on the mirrored back glasses for the

[02:59] CE machines.

[03:00] There's a scoop coming at you from Canada.

[03:02] But here's the thing.

[03:03] They're flooding more games into the marketplace and the games are not even selling for $10,200.

[03:10] So that means these games are going to keep going down in value every single week.

[03:16] And it's sort of like catching a falling knife.

[03:18] And we're seeing people in like the threads say, well at $9,000 I'm a buyer or $9,500

[03:24] I might consider it.

[03:26] Here's what I think is going on with this game.

[03:28] The problem is when you have a game that's just not clicking with people, when you have

[03:34] a game that people aren't falling in love with, it doesn't really have much value at

[03:39] all.

[03:40] And the only way to justify buying it is by the discount you're going to get on what

[03:45] the MSRP was.

[03:47] But everybody knows this was the worst MSRP game in the history of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[03:54] They charged way too much for this game.

[03:57] And so where is the real starting point?

[04:00] Do you remember when Guns N' Roses Ellie came out?

[04:03] How much was Guns N' Roses Ellie?

[04:05] It was $9,500 and it's a better game than Toy Story 4.

[04:11] And that's the issue right now.

[04:13] Is this game is sliding simply by market demand.

[04:18] It is sliding back down to where Jersey Jack games need to be.

[04:23] They priced it all wrong.

[04:25] But we're going to do a fundraiser and I hope you all contribute.

[04:28] We're going to raise $201 and when we get there, we are going to send that money either

[04:34] to Greg or the other seller at 10-2 and we are simply going to ask them, could you please

[04:40] change the listing on your Toy Story Ellie to $9,999 and when that happens, the next

[04:48] stop for this thing is going to be $9,500.

[04:51] The next stop is going to be $9,000.

[04:54] I am telling you right now.

[04:56] There's only one way for Jersey Jack Pinball to keep these prices somewhat stable.

[05:01] They need to announce they're done making Toy Stories and they're not making any more.

[05:06] That is the only way they are going to stabilize the price on this game and they're not going

[05:10] to do it.

[05:11] There's too much ego.

[05:13] There's too much pride.

[05:14] There's probably also just too much logistical problems on getting to their next game.

[05:18] But they need to get to the next game.

[05:20] So I just keep seeing this Toy Story 4 sale and it just makes me laugh.

[05:23] But okay, so I think we're going to see Toy Story Ellie's in the next few months be around

[05:27] $9,000 to $8,500 and you heard it here first because the more games they pump into the market,

[05:33] the more these games are going to go down in value.

[05:35] Now is the three-tier model dead for everybody else but Stern Pinball?

[05:39] Let's talk about this because nowadays you've got everybody trying to model their sort of

[05:44] strategy and their marketing approach after Stern Pinball.

[05:48] Let's think about how Stern makes the three-tier model work.

[05:51] Each game has a different art package.

[05:54] Okay, now let's look at the three-tier model over at American Pinball.

[05:57] Do they have a different art package for the three different models of the game?

[06:02] No.

[06:03] Are the games any different mechanically?

[06:04] No.

[06:05] Okay, so American Pinball's three-tiered model, it's absolutely ludicrous and once again it

[06:11] shows that American Pinball doesn't really know what they're doing.

[06:14] There is not enough demand for a game like Legends of the Hala to have a three-tier model

[06:21] of the game and it's just David Figg sort of looking at what Stern's doing and say,

[06:26] hey, we can do it too but they're doing it all wrong.

[06:28] Let's look at Spooky Pinball and their three-tier model.

[06:32] They offer you a chance to get the collector's edition, the bloodsucker edition and the standard

[06:37] edition of the game but the Spooky model is also sort of wonky and everyone is shooting

[06:43] themselves in the foot on the value of their Spooky machines because the majority of the

[06:48] people are ordering the collector's edition.

[06:51] So then the greatest volume of machines is also the one that's supposed to be the most

[06:56] expensive and the most collectible.

[06:58] The most collectible should be also the rarest.

[07:01] Like Stern has always made the least amount of LEDs out of the three models that they

[07:07] offer.

[07:08] So Spooky does it all weird.

[07:09] Like Spooky's kind of smart though.

[07:11] Think about how smart Spooky's move was when they did it because they were looking at all

[07:15] the babies, right?

[07:16] All the pin-side babies crying that they couldn't get their Stern LE and Spooky was like, hey,

[07:22] you want the LE version of our game?

[07:24] We're going to make as many of them as people want and then we'll move on to the next version.

[07:28] Like we'll make as many of the nicest version as people want.

[07:31] Well they did it, they were successful and guess what?

[07:34] Now it's not limited.

[07:35] Now it's not rare.

[07:36] Now it's not hard to get.

[07:37] So look Spooky's always figured out a way to benefit Spooky but in the long run, in

[07:42] the long run, Spooky's moves will always benefit them but they will always come at a cost to

[07:49] the consumer.

[07:50] We are not seeing Spooky games go up in value other than Rick and Morty because that theme

[07:54] is so damn popular and in hindsight everyone is kicking themselves.

[07:58] They didn't just order a Rick and Morty, put it in a box and wait a few years because it's

[08:03] one of the hottest franchises in the world and there's only 750 of those games ever because

[08:09] of the most boneheaded move by Spooky marketing.

[08:12] I heard Spooky Luke is not a huge fan of Canada.

[08:14] Luke, come on, I love you guys.

[08:17] I just want you guys to take some of my advice every now and then and hedge multi-bob baby

[08:23] hedge multi-bob.

[08:25] Wow it's Thursday, I'm pretty hyped up on this show.

[08:27] So look, the three tier model is not dead for stern.

[08:31] It's not going to be dead for Spooky because the way Spooky does it, it's to their benefit.

[08:36] It's not going to work for American pinball.

[08:38] It wouldn't work for multi-morphic.

[08:40] It wouldn't work for Dutch pinball.

[08:42] It wouldn't work for Haggis pinball.

[08:44] Let's talk about Haggis for a minute.

[08:46] Damien went on the record and he said he was going to make all of the Fathom mermaid additions

[08:52] by the end of the year.

[08:55] So do you think over the next two months that Haggis pinball is going to have made 250

[09:04] mermaid additions?

[09:05] I go into the thread like every week or so just to see what the vibe is and more and

[09:10] more people are being asked to pay in fall.

[09:13] The going timeframe between paying in fall and getting your games is at least eight weeks.

[09:20] Some people have waited much longer than eight weeks.

[09:23] But look, there's a lot of confidence in them because games are shipping.

[09:28] Now look, this is not about whether or not they can make the product, but I still think

[09:32] there are some stark realities about the long term viability of a company that just won't

[09:40] be transparent.

[09:42] Because if they need money this far in advance, what does that signal?

[09:47] It signals this.

[09:48] They have a cash flow issue.

[09:51] Why else would they need your money three months in advance to make a machine?

[09:56] Now I've said it and I'll say it again.

[09:58] I think everybody that orders this game is going to get it.

[10:02] I think they're still going to be making fathoms into the end of next year because after the

[10:07] mermaid additions, they have to make all the other additions they sold.

[10:11] I think they sold over 500 of these games.

[10:15] They can't make 250 in a year.

[10:18] We know that.

[10:19] I also think they're not going to be any more transparent.

[10:22] I think we are going to head into a global recession.

[10:26] And I think those people who bought series tickets that enables them to the next four

[10:31] to five titles of Haggis Pinball, there is no way this company is going to get to another

[10:35] two or three titles over the next two or three years.

[10:38] So you're going to be what?

[10:39] Waiting five years to get your games.

[10:41] I think it's a wake up call.

[10:43] I think Pinball is about to go through a very interesting year.

[10:47] I think with where the prices are at, where use game prices are at, and where your checking

[10:52] account is at, as more and more people are going to run into like harsh career realities,

[10:58] it's coming people.

[10:59] I know that all of you out there are not just high on the hog.

[11:02] I know a lot of us out there rely on our paychecks.

[11:06] We rely on our investments.

[11:08] We rely on the economy going north, not south as a means to buy pinball machines.

[11:14] Look, and I've always said this, I think people buy pinball machines with their excess money,

[11:19] but it's also a psychological thing.

[11:22] Even though I'm not going to use my investments or my savings to buy a James Bond or a Guns

[11:26] and Roses, if I see my investments losing six figures, I might say to myself, well now's

[11:33] not a good time to buy a pinball machine, because what I'm going to do with my cash

[11:37] now is simply this.

[11:39] I'm going to wait for all of these stocks and all this other stuff to go on sale, and

[11:45] that's what I'm going to buy.

[11:46] I've always said this to people, if you bought Tesla 10 years ago, if you put $10,000 into

[11:51] Tesla stock, it was worth $1.8 million at the height.

[11:55] As I look at companies like Amazon and Meta and Netflix and all of these major tech companies

[12:00] that are not going away, go look at their stock prices.

[12:04] It's like 75% off what they were a year or two ago.

[12:09] Where are you going to put your money?

[12:11] You're going to invest your money in James Bond LE, which might make you a grander too.

[12:15] It might not lose you money, but really, is that the smartest thing to buy?

[12:19] I think as we head towards this period, if you're an intelligent person, you're not

[12:23] gobbling up $12,000 to $15,000 pinball machines.

[12:27] Now, speaking of $12,000 to $15,000 pinball machines, I went on Pinside today and I looked

[12:33] at the marketplace for games that were over $15,000.

[12:38] A couple years ago, there would have been maybe just one or two games for sale for over

[12:44] $15,000.

[12:46] Do me a favor, go look at the Pinside marketplace, over $15,000 and see what pops up.

[12:53] There are tons of games on the marketplace being listed for over $15,000.

[12:59] These are games that are like Deadpool and Stranger Things and Monsters.

[13:04] These are games where every single one of these games, all of these games were half

[13:08] that price when they came out and they sat in box, most of those games.

[13:13] That's the thing.

[13:14] It's like this market is so inflated.

[13:17] It is so overpriced right now.

[13:20] The only people that want to convince you the prices are where they need to be are the

[13:24] manufacturers and the distributors.

[13:27] Of course, they want you to believe these are where the prices should be at because they

[13:30] see what's coming down the road.

[13:32] These distributors are going to need to sell you $13,000 Venoms and $15,000 Godfathers and

[13:39] you know deep down inside, you know when you look down at a pinball machine and you pop

[13:43] the hood on it, you're not seeing that in the game.

[13:46] And look, I get it.

[13:47] It's a crazy world.

[13:48] It's a short life for everybody.

[13:50] Do what makes you happy.

[13:51] I would never tell you not to buy something.

[13:54] You do you.

[13:55] Everybody, you do you.

[13:56] If this makes you happy and dropping $15,000 on a pinball machine makes you happy, by all

[14:02] means, don't let Canadian stop you from this happiness.

[14:05] But I was doing the following.

[14:06] I asked myself, how much is a stern premium if I buy it in New York State?

[14:11] So let's put this into the calculator right now.

[14:13] A stern premium without shipping, this is just if I want to buy it, it's $9,700.

[14:19] If I include sales tax, a stern premium cost me $10,560 for a stern premium, a machine

[14:28] they will make for years to come, a machine that won't be complete for at least a year

[14:32] or two, a machine in which they're going to make an unlimited amount of them.

[14:36] People have forgotten this.

[14:38] Premiums have no limit.

[14:40] They will make these premiums for years.

[14:42] There will be thousands of these premiums in the marketplace.

[14:45] Let me add shipping.

[14:46] I have $400 in shipping, $10,100.

[14:49] To my door, a stern premium will now cost me $10,996, $11,000 for an unlimited game they're

[14:59] going to make for years.

[15:01] And this is the big issue.

[15:02] I think the premium is going to be the product that dies because buying a new and box premium

[15:09] right now is going to be the silliest place to stick your money.

[15:13] It's not rare, it's not special, and it's just going to go south in price.

[15:18] And we're not used to this.

[15:20] Everybody remembers when a stern premium was $7,500.

[15:23] You'd buy it for $7,500 and usually it stayed around there.

[15:26] You might lose a few hundred bucks, but you put a few hundred plays on it and you got

[15:30] your money's worth.

[15:31] Now, you're going to buy it for $11,000.

[15:34] What's it going to be worth used?

[15:35] It's not going to stay near $11,000.

[15:37] It's probably going to slide down to $9,800.

[15:40] Are you going to put $2,500 plays on the game to get your money out of it?

[15:44] And this is the other part.

[15:45] All these new games are going to keep coming.

[15:47] This market is going to be so oversaturated with such expensive inventory.

[15:53] It's all going to just crash into the wall at once.

[15:56] And guess who's going to be there to sort of laugh as I'm sipping my cognac, wearing

[16:00] my Gucci slides, being like, I told you guys, just wait.

[16:04] This is like the worst time to invest in new and box pinball machines.

[16:09] And again, nobody wants to say this to you.

[16:11] Absolutely.

[16:12] I'm the bad guy.

[16:13] It's also the worst time to buy used games.

[16:16] Look at these inflated used prices.

[16:18] I guarantee you, if you wait two years, every game you want will be available for less than

[16:26] it is now, every single game.

[16:30] And that is something nobody else wants to tell you.

[16:33] Canadian Pinball Podcast, $5 a month.

[16:36] Welcome to our new club members.

[16:38] This is how we do it.

[16:39] I love pinball.

[16:40] I'm trying to get these prices down.

[16:41] I know that I've always said over the years that they could charge more, but I always

[16:44] thought they would put more into the games if they charged more and they're not.

[16:49] You pop the hood on these things and it's so apparent that less is going into these games

[16:54] and they're charging us almost twice as much.

[16:57] Canada is the number one consumer advocate in all of pinball and you know it.

[17:01] And that's why we got the Twippies.

[17:03] Everybody have a great Thursday.

[17:04] We'll talk to you soon.
