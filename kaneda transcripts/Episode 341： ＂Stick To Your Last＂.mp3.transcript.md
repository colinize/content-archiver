[00:16] Alright, we're gonna do things a little bit differently on episode 341 of Canadian Pimball

[00:21] podcast because I woke up this morning and I felt like we were getting just a little

[00:25] bit soft on this show and here's what I mean by that. I've been listening to all these

[00:30] other Pimball podcasts out there recently. There's a lot of them. There's a lot more

[00:35] of them coming up every single day talking about Pimball and I think it's awesome. But here's

[00:41] the thing. Here's the thing. When I listen to some of them, I can't help but feel like,

[00:46] you know, they spend five minutes during the podcast talking about how their podcast is

[00:51] gonna be different and how they're gonna do this and how they're not gonna be negative.

[00:55] And they're not gonna be DJ produced and I can't help but feel like they're throwing

[01:00] so much shade on some of the best Pimball podcasts that are out there. And here's the thing.

[01:06] You know, I'm sitting up here in New York City by myself doing this podcast and I want

[01:11] to break it down for all you other Pimball podcast out there that are wondering why Canadian

[01:16] Pimball podcast has such a loyal following. I'm gonna make it real simple for so many

[01:21] of you to understand. Are you ready? Are you waiting for the secret? Here it is. And

[01:26] this ain't no Christopher Franchie tip. This is just the way it is. This Pimball podcast,

[01:31] you know what I'm playing that they're not playing? I'm playing singles tennis. All right.

[01:37] There's nobody else on the court. It's just Canadian. Hit in the ball back. It's faster.

[01:42] It's quicker. It's immediate. And that's why people like it. We're not talking for five

[01:47] minutes about our approach to Pimball podcasting. We're not talking about how we entered

[01:52] a tournament. We're not talking about how we fixed our Pimball machine over the weekend.

[01:56] We're not talking about anything else, but we're giving you the Pimball news immediately.

[02:01] All right. And I'm not saying you have to steal like me. I'm not saying you have to listen

[02:06] to me. But come on. All you new guys to the Pimball podcast world show some damn respect

[02:12] when you want to say how you're going to do it better. Let me tell you something. Okay.

[02:16] The reason why we're here, the reason why we have all these listeners is we don't hold

[02:20] back. We are straight shooters. And you know what? You know what? Sometimes we get stuff

[02:25] right. Sometimes we get stuff wrong. I'm just saying this. Do your thing. But if you want

[02:30] to start talking about how you're going to do it differently and you're not going to

[02:35] be that and you're throwing shade on what we do, you want to throw shade on what's

[02:39] special when it does saying it to DJ produce. Come on, guys. Wake up. Wake up. There's

[02:46] a reason why people are listening. All right. So let's get right to it before I talk

[02:50] about my weekend for 15 minutes. All right. Here's what here's the deal. We're just going

[02:53] to go down on this episode. I haven't done this in a while. Just straight shoot about what's

[02:57] going on with all these companies. And we're going to do it. You know, I I'm tired of

[03:01] talking about wonka. You're tired of listening about wonka. So let's get right to what's going

[03:06] on the Pimball world. Where should we start? Let's start like where some help is needed.

[03:11] Where are the monster bash remake L. These where are they? I don't understand. People

[03:17] who paid for this game in October when the game was first announced have still not received

[03:24] their title. Now here's also when I'm hearing a lot of these guys are not even getting any

[03:28] feedback from C. G. C. or from their distributors on where the ETA of their game is. My God.

[03:36] This thing has kind of been a little bit a bit launch a disaster for Chicago gaming company.

[03:43] And I'm hearing stories where people are just canceling their orders and they're ordering

[03:46] black night where they're ordering willy wonka. And that's where we're at. I think if Chicago

[03:51] gaming company really really really wants to sort of like compete. They need to get the

[03:57] games in the homes faster. And that's just an evergreen theme in Pimball. You have to

[04:02] ship your game close to reveal. All right. Now because I just talked about that let's

[04:08] talk about willy wonka in that aspect. I'm not talking about the game anymore. God. Some

[04:13] of you guys are just never going to be satisfied with Pimball. I have to do a little bit of

[04:17] attention of so many people who are just always disappointed by everything. I'm just here

[04:21] to say on Canadian Pimball podcast. I think there's a silent. It's not even silent. There's

[04:27] a tiny little minority of people. They're on Pinside and no matter what new game comes

[04:32] out. They cry like babies and they're cranky about everything. And here's the thing about

[04:36] mostly all of those people. They're never buying anything anyway. And that's the great deception

[04:43] of the internet is that it gives a megaphone to people who can chime in about how disappointed

[04:49] they are in the new release from Ferrari. But these guys can't even afford a Honda Civic.

[04:55] And they're crying about the Ferrari design and the Ferrari features of Pimball. Get out

[05:00] of here. Get out of here. And yet the majority people are satisfied. Okay, but the big thing

[05:05] is this. The game that willy wonka is competing with is not even black night. The game that willy

[05:12] wonka will compete with is Jurassic World. The reality is this. We do you think do you expect

[05:19] this game to ship in 60 days, which is what Jack is saying? Here's the thing. I hope it

[05:24] does. I really do hope it does. History has shown us that that is very, very, very unlikely.

[05:33] And what has changed this time from the past? And I don't know, but I think a lot of people

[05:40] are very, very cautious. If they think they're going to get their game in like 60 days. Okay,

[05:46] I was over there. There wasn't willy wonka's on the line being made. There were pirates

[05:52] of the Caribbean's waiting for parts. Okay, if I go over to Stern today, what am I going

[05:56] to see? I'm going to see black night on the line. Every time Stern reveals a new game,

[06:03] the game is already on the line. It's normally already on a boat headed to Europe. And so it

[06:09] does beg the question, well, why did why did they why they reveal it if it's not on the

[06:14] line? Now, Jack was very proud that when they revealed the yellow brick road edition of

[06:19] Wizard of Oz, it was on the line already. Now, I did kind of say to Jack, yeah, but Jack,

[06:23] this game's seven years old. I mean, it's not like you've got all the parts. You're just

[06:27] waiting for stuff to come and paint it, right? So you can't really take credit that that

[06:32] is indication that all of your problems have been solved from previous launches and launch

[06:37] delays. Now, do I think this is going to be pirates of the Caribbean all over again?

[06:41] Absolutely not. They have to get this game out. They have to get this game out by early

[06:46] summer. People just will not forgive them again. This needs to be the game that shows us that

[06:54] they really have learned and they know how to do it right. I still am anxious because I'll

[06:59] tell you why I just would not reveal something until it's already on the line. It's not like

[07:04] they didn't know people would want a pat-law or version of Willy Wonka. So why even show

[07:10] it so early? That's just the thing, man. That's, you know, everyone's doing thing their

[07:15] way. But I'm still in online and you're not going to hear much about it until I get it,

[07:19] all right? All right. So that's what's happening at Jersey Jack. They're going to be competing

[07:23] though, not with Black Knight. Jersey Jack will be competing with Jurassic World and Brian

[07:29] Eddie's Jurassic World. Okay. Because by the time I think Wonka is actually making their

[07:35] way into people's homes, I think we are going to see Jurassic World from Brian Eddie. And

[07:41] that is going to be the title that it goes head to head with, not really Black Knight.

[07:46] Okay. Let's talk quickly about Black Knight. Then we're going to go on to Stern's Jurassic

[07:49] World. Because those are the next two Stern titles. We won't even talk about monsters. You

[07:54] know, it seems like monsters is being quickly forgotten. How quickly are people to sort of

[07:59] given up on talking about monsters? And why is that? Now here's what I know that people

[08:04] just won't say. And I wish people would say this more often because people know this stuff.

[08:09] And if they said it, and if more people heard this, I think it would actually improve the kinds

[08:15] of products we got from Stern Pimball. You know what I heard? I heard that John Borg while he's

[08:22] proud of the game, he's also bummed out by some of the stuff he had to remove from the game to

[08:27] get the price point down, to get the bomb down on the game. So he wanted more magic in the game

[08:33] and the stuff got yanked out. And that is why we never see this stuff. We never hear about the

[08:39] things that these designers really want it in the game. And the final version of monsters that we

[08:44] get is not really the dream version and the aspiration of that designer. It's just basically what

[08:53] they were willing to give them in terms of budget. And I think it shows on every single Stern

[08:59] machine. I definitely think you look over a game and you can see where there could have been more,

[09:05] whether there could have been drop targets or could have been another mechanism or toy. There could

[09:08] have been something else. And I don't want to see these, I don't really get that excited anymore

[09:17] when I hear that Stern has a theme that I'm really excited about because I know that's always

[09:21] going to be the case. Does it ever look like their games went above and beyond and pushed the envelopes?

[09:28] It's a little bit why I was just annoyed when people are complaining about what's in

[09:32] Willy Wonka because it has so much more than what's in monsters. Now the real killer from

[09:38] monsters though because I think Stern got a lot of, they got away with a lot in that game in terms

[09:44] of like feedback because I think the game shot really well. All right. So I think it had really fun

[09:49] ramps to hit. I think the game was one of the most gorgeous games of all time. You know,

[09:54] Christopher Franchi blew it out of the park. You know, I'll say it right now. Monsters art

[09:58] blows Willy Wonka out of way. It does. There's no way around it. It's a gorgeous machine.

[10:03] The black and white is really cool. So they had a lot. They had a lot of visual stunning things going

[10:08] on. But ultimately what is going to kill the monster's pinball is the code. Now here's why the

[10:15] monster's code is never going to be the code you want it to be. And here's another sort of

[10:21] ugly truth of pinball that you're not going to hear about on the other pinball podcast who just

[10:26] know how to do it better than Canadian pinball podcast. Are you ready for it? Are you ready for

[10:30] the truth? The honesty behind the scenes that gets shared amongst the inner circle. And I didn't

[10:36] pay no 30 bucks to Stern to get a t-shirt to hear this. So here's what happens. And this is

[10:41] something that George Gomez and Christopher Franchi were battling back and forth on is passion.

[10:46] And so when you look at pinball, if you do not have a passion for the project you're working on,

[10:53] it is going to suffer. It's going to suffer if you're doing the artwork and you're not passionate.

[10:58] It's going to suffer if you're doing the layout. And it sure as hell going to suffer if you're

[11:03] doing the code in a pinball machine. So you want to know why monsters is so mediocre when it comes

[11:09] to the coding department. I'll tell you why. There's only one reason why they really made the monsters.

[11:15] It's because John Borg is super passionate about the monsters. He loves the show. It's one of his

[11:22] favorite. And he'd been asking Stern for years to make the monsters. And so when he designed it,

[11:28] of course he designed so much into the game. Some of it didn't make it into the final version,

[11:34] but his passion was there. Okay. You know who wasn't passionate about the monsters? Who didn't

[11:40] grow up loving the show? Who didn't know the show that well was Dwight Sullivan. And so the guy

[11:46] coding the machine doesn't share the passion in the guy who's designing the machine. And I think if

[11:52] you look at the game and you play the game, you're going to see that. That is just like it's got like

[11:56] just basic code that gets you through it, but he doesn't understand the franchise or have the same

[12:02] level of enthusiasm. And I think that's why you're not seeing all the different fun sort of little

[12:08] nuance ways to code that machine that make it as magical to flip as it is to shoot. Right?

[12:15] The experience of flipping it because the code is not as much fun as the shot geometry. And that's

[12:21] monsters. And it's never going to change because you can't install passion in someone if they don't

[12:27] really care about something. And Dwight just watching the show to catch up before coding it.

[12:34] That's not the same of someone who's like super passionate about Star Wars and has thought about it

[12:39] for 30, 40 years. And it shows. And then we sell franchi and gomas debating Beetlejuice.

[12:46] Where George Gomez is basically saying we're not making this game because nobody over here is

[12:51] passionate about Beetlejuice. And you know what? I think that's the right decision. If none of

[12:56] their designers care about Beetlejuice, don't freaking make Beetlejuice. And as they have so many

[13:03] other a list properties they have to work with. Why would you make Beetlejuice? And Beetlejuice is

[13:09] another one of these like yes, it's a Tim Burton movie. Yes, it was popular back in the day. Yes,

[13:14] I do think it hits the pinball demographic nicely. But would it sell that well? Well, here's the deal.

[13:20] It would weigh out sell black night. But again, passion wasn't there. Black night is Steve Richie's

[13:26] passion project. So they let him make it after all the years. They let him make it. All right.

[13:32] Now let's talk about black night quickly. Then I want to move on to Jurassic World. So black night,

[13:38] you know, it was at MGC. I didn't hear as much feedback. I hear it's fun to flip. I hear it's fast.

[13:42] It's like every single Steve Richie game has the same feedback. And this one is pretty similar.

[13:48] I think if you want that sort of like heavy metal rock concert pinball machine in your home or at

[13:52] your bar, you're going to be satisfied. I think the night mechanism is cool. The animation is

[13:57] definitely a little great. But here's one thing. And I heard Marty at head to head pinball say this

[14:03] on his podcast. And I think this was the smartest thing I've heard. Almost anyone say in pinball

[14:09] podcasting in a long time, I think it's smarter than anything I've said in a long time. So if you

[14:14] know Marty, you should say, Hey, hey, man, Kaneda gave you a shout out on his show. And I think what

[14:20] he said about the black night is not just genius, but I think it's very indicative of what we need

[14:27] in more of pinball. And it's definitely the biggest problem I see in Willy Wonka right now. He said

[14:33] we need more orchestration. We need more orchestration in the game where it just feels like repetitive.

[14:41] Like you've got the heavy metal music, you've got the balance scoring, you've got the monsters

[14:46] battle in it. But when you play the game, there's just not the orchestration where it all comes

[14:52] together and tells this narrative. You just sort of feel like you're dropped in to the middle of

[14:58] of this experience without any context of any of it. It's almost like it's just here you go,

[15:06] heavy metal music, here you go, battle monster over and over and over again, the same sort of

[15:09] philosophy, you know, hit the shots and the monster gets hit. And then you're on. It doesn't feel like

[15:14] you're on this journey to defeat the black night and it like you're dropped into a storyline. And

[15:19] that's where I think these pinball coders need to stop. And it's one of the problems when you have

[15:25] tournament guys guys who are obsessed with tournaments are the ones coding these games is they don't

[15:31] understand that concept that there's more to pinball than just a pathway to score that so many

[15:39] people who love pinball, they want something more of a story they want an inexperience where it's

[15:45] about the emotional connection to the machine. And they want to see the machine do things really

[15:50] unique and cool and different. And man, I just interviewed Josh Kugler. I'm going to air that next.

[15:56] It's amazing the stuff that they're putting into octoberfest from a code standpoint that is just

[16:00] unique. And I'm just not seeing other people think about that when they orchestrate the design of

[16:06] these games. It's just very repetitive. And it just feels like it's we've seen this before a

[16:11] million times. And it's it's like they're relying so much on the animation quality to be the

[16:17] differentiator when I think the orchestration of how they tell the story in the game and how they

[16:22] use the physical things in the game. Okay. Let me give you an example of what I mean by orchestration.

[16:28] Like the game should start and imagine the game starts and it's like I am the black night. I dare you

[16:35] to defeat me and then all of a sudden his flail goes and his shield goes up and down. Do you have

[16:40] what it takes pinball player to defeat me? I don't think so. Like there's none of that. There is

[16:47] absolutely none of that. It's just like you turn the game on and it's like heavy metal music blasting

[16:53] in your ear and you don't even understand like what to do. That is the problem with pinball.

[16:58] There's too much of these old people who know too much about pinball just dropping us into games

[17:04] and they don't understand how to orchestrate it in a modern way and no one's thinking that creatively

[17:11] about it because they're just doing it the way they've done it as if we're still playing games in

[17:15] 90s arcades and we don't want more. We do want more. All right. Okay. So that brings us to Jurassic

[17:21] World a game coming out in summer of 2019. I don't understand the timing of that. The Jurassic World

[17:27] movies have come and gone. There is no Jurassic World movie on the horizon. The Jurassic World

[17:32] movies were not that popular. The popular movies were still Jurassic Park. Look, they were okay.

[17:38] The first Jurassic World. But for the most part your pinball buying person still has much more of a

[17:44] love affair. Much more of an nostalgia with Jurassic Park not Jurassic World. Now we already have a

[17:50] Jurassic Park game by Daddy East which you know doesn't have modern COVID. It has a lot of fun stuff

[17:56] in it and a lot of people love that game would stern even be able to put as much in that game

[18:03] as the old Jurassic Park. And here's the thing we all know the answer to that. No way would modern

[18:09] stern give you as much mechanical and physical stuff in the game and design it so uniquely

[18:16] as the old Jurassic Park game. So I don't even think they can make it better. We'll see. This is

[18:21] Brian Eddie. Man, this is this is medieval madness guy. There's one of the guys who's known for like

[18:25] big mechanisms, big toys and big excitement and pinball. And this is his return at stern pinball.

[18:32] And I think this is going to be such an important launch, right? Because you're going to take a guy

[18:37] who all he knows how to do is give pinball magic to the world. And now you're going to have to pull

[18:42] him through stern pinball. So this game comes out and this game does not have tons of mechs and

[18:50] innovation and doesn't have like Brian Eddie is like signature stamp on the game. Then we will know

[18:56] once and for all the reality is stern pinball is just not giving these guys enough budget and

[19:01] money to make the magic happen. And they're kind of cheaping out on it all. And you see it and you

[19:07] feel it. So I think my eyeballs are in Jurassic World. I got to say with black night not being an

[19:12] inexpensive property, there's not that much in the game. You know, there is not that much in the

[19:17] game. So like I was expecting more considering that they didn't have to spend as much on a license

[19:22] and I don't think you got it per se. All right. All right. Let's go on to let's go on to American

[19:29] pinball October fest. It's coming out. We talked to Josh Kugler. The competition is stiff. They've

[19:36] changed some stuff on the geometry of the game. There's a lot of unique coding things in the game.

[19:41] I think everyone is gripped on long enough about the LCD, the artwork and what else has people

[19:46] been complaining about like the music at times. There's a lot to complain about. I see in the game.

[19:51] I told us to Josh they have worked to be done. They are not at the level of where other companies are

[19:57] right now with artwork. They're not at the level where other companies are with the animations. They

[20:01] are not where other companies are with the theme selection. So those are the big three things that

[20:07] some people might say three strikes in their out. But here's the thing after talking to them,

[20:10] they're not going away. This won't be their last game. They are prepping for the future. They are

[20:16] prepping for titles three, four and five, which is, you know, I guess you have to do that. These guys

[20:22] are not going away. The investment will be there. They have money backing this company that is not

[20:28] coming from the pinball sales itself. So apparently they will probably take a loss on their first few

[20:33] titles to keep going. But I'm here to tell you that, you know, these guys, their theme approach is

[20:39] that they want to do timeless themes that are evergreen that are not based on an expensive IP. We'll

[20:45] see. We'll see. There's work to be done though at American pinball and October fest probably

[20:50] would have been better coming out against the monsters coming out against Willie Wonka and Black

[20:56] Knight. Not as easy for them to generate those sales. So, but the game is on the line. The game

[21:03] will be shipping the customers very, very soon. So it is going to be the summer in which October

[21:08] fest is one of the titles you can go buy. You know, do I think it's going to sell a lot? I don't

[21:13] think it's going to sell that many because of how many other games are out there. But I'll say this.

[21:19] They are packing a lot into the game. They are giving you a lot for the money. I think if they can

[21:24] get those other areas improved, which they should easily be able to do on the next title. I think

[21:31] American pinball has a shot at creating hit games and selling a lot in the pinball world. All right.

[21:37] This isn't the theme I would have chose. That's not the art package I would have put. I would have

[21:41] approached the LCD a little bit differently. But when Josh does talk to me about the stuff that's

[21:46] coded in the game, I do think they are trying to be much more creative in their offering. And I think

[21:51] when you hear the interview, you're also going to come away feeling the same way. All right. Who else

[21:56] is out there? Spooky pinball. Alice Cooper's are shipping. Alice Cooper's are making its way to people.

[22:02] The spooky story for a while is going to be Alice Cooper. The feedback on the game

[22:07] won't change dramatically. It's a beautiful looking game. The animations are incredible. The sound

[22:14] effects and everything are really amazing. The shots are still really tight. The shots are tight.

[22:20] You need to be a good pinball player to make your way through it. But again, I think Spooky once

[22:25] again has kept getting better and keeps improving. And they needed to. They needed to. There's

[22:31] no denying the fact that some of the earlier spooky offerings left a lot to be desired. Now where

[22:37] they're at with their price point, they got to keep getting better. They got to keep putting more

[22:42] into the game. They got to keep hiring more talent to stay competitive. But Charlie, you know, sold

[22:48] off 500. And I think you're going to see unboxings this summer. And I can't wait to play it some more.

[22:54] And that's where we are. We're not going to see much new news from Spooky. That's the other thing.

[22:58] This podcast, I'm like, man, there is going to be a low in news between now and Jurassic World.

[23:03] But we'll, you know, me. We'll figure some way to talk to you guys. All right. What else?

[23:07] Who am I missing here? Let's see. Let's talk about deep route. So deep route, where are they at?

[23:13] And so he was the new news on deep route. If you can even call it news, is that Robert chimed in

[23:19] and said they have more than 12 white woods being worked on at deep route. More than 12 white woods.

[23:26] And look, I've been really, really good at sort of being silent. I haven't really chimed in.

[23:33] I haven't really said much about deep route. And they haven't taken anyone's money. They hired

[23:38] Jay Pop. We know the story, right? It would be so annoying if I just belabored a company that really

[23:45] hasn't done much, hasn't shown much, hasn't revealed anything. They've grabbed the mic a few times

[23:51] and said some ridiculous stuff about how many games are going to ship and how game changing it's

[23:57] going to be and how, you know, just wait, Steve Bowden bragging, all these people bragging. We've

[24:02] seen absolutely nothing. There's tons of pages on Pinside talking about deep route. And yet,

[24:07] there's not a single, even like a post that we've seen that manufacturer. Here's the thing. Here's

[24:13] the thing. I just don't like when you brag about something that you aren't showing anybody. It is

[24:24] like me telling people, I have 12 girlfriends, but you can't see any of them, but trust me. You

[24:31] know, people like that, and we all grew up with people like that. Nobody likes people like that.

[24:36] You don't win people over with your behind the scenes bragging. And so, and also, I just can't even

[24:44] understand why that makes sense. Like, why would you be making 12 pinball machines? That seems like

[24:52] a waste of resources. It seems like you're putting the cart way in front of the horse. You don't know

[25:00] how game one is going to sell. And yet, you're making game two through 12. And you are planning to

[25:08] basically inundate the pinball marketplace and also just cannibalize your own product. Now,

[25:15] I want to tell Robert something, you don't need 12 games. You don't need 13 games. You need three

[25:22] or four great games within a year or two. And you will be a dominant player in pinball if you can

[25:28] get people those games in time. The real solution in pinball, the real answer, the way you succeed in

[25:35] pinball. And Robert should know this by now. It's not with volume. It's not with promising games.

[25:42] The way you succeed in pinball is one thing and one thing only. It's manufacturing. And manufacturing

[25:50] isn't sexy. Manufacturing isn't easy. Manufacturing doesn't happen overnight. But there are so

[25:57] many pinball dreamers out there who have made prototypes of games and have got people together and

[26:03] created something. But when they go to make it, when they go to ship it, when they go to collect all

[26:09] those thousands of parts in one place and screw it together, that is where everyone is falling down.

[26:14] And I'm sorry, but deep root hasn't shown us anything when it comes to manufacturing. Right? It went

[26:20] from quad manufacturing to octo manufacturing. But deep root is not a manufacturing company. And so

[26:27] it doesn't mean I don't think they can pull it off. But I haven't seen anything to believe, to make

[26:33] me believe that they can pull it off. And then when they come out and they say that they are going to

[26:38] have the ability to manufacture and get games out faster than Stern with more volume than Stern,

[26:44] when Stern is making 10,000 pinball machines plus a year in that ginormous factory with 200 workers,

[26:51] how are you going to do it? How are you going to do it? And I've lost a little bit of patience with

[26:58] this company. I think they're all talk right now. I think everything is going to hinge on their first

[27:04] title. And I think they're stalling. I think they're definitely stalling. And this is not me.

[27:08] You know, it's not like they have to prove me wrong. They don't have to prove anything to Canada.

[27:13] They just have to deliver what they said they're going to deliver. And if anything happens, see,

[27:18] here's the problem. If anything goes wrong, people are not going to be forgiving because of how much

[27:23] they boasted about what kind of player they were going to be in the pinball world. And if history has

[27:29] shown us anything, delays will happen. And here's what's going to happen is like it's always the delay

[27:35] you could never see coming in a million years. It's just it takes one major part to be delayed in

[27:43] manufacturing from a vendor, Robert, that you have to rely on. And maybe those parts come in.

[27:49] And maybe they're not satisfactory. And you have to wait. And then the line is frozen. See, what do

[27:55] you they haven't encountered any of this? They are sitting in deep root for the most part, probably

[28:00] having a lot of fun designing pinball machines with investor dollars. Think about it. They're paying

[28:06] people every day, every month with investor dollars. No money's coming in. And they're making 12

[28:11] games. I can't even I can't just make one good game. Get it out. Are we going to see it on June 30th?

[28:21] That is the new deadline for this company. And if Raza doesn't come out on June 30th and absolutely

[28:28] blow everyone away, what what happens? What's the future hold? And if people love it and they order

[28:34] it, they better get it soon. Because that's what the expectations have been set. Now it also makes it

[28:39] really interesting. Because June 30th, if you think about it, that's right when like Willie

[28:44] Wank is about to come out. It's right when we're on the eve of Jurassic World. It's going to be

[28:49] ridiculously oversaturated soon. And I can't wait. All these companies think there's all this room

[28:55] money and and and like buyer and demand out there and pinball. It's it's not it's just it can't

[29:03] all survive. There's just no way. What we really just need is one to two magical games a year

[29:09] and one or two games that are great for all location play. And I don't think they're the same.

[29:14] I think location pinball strategy would be different to me if I was making home use games as well.

[29:21] I would have a different strategy for home collectors than I would for all location. And I think

[29:25] Stern gets that right with the pro and the LE. They know exactly how to make sort of different

[29:30] variations of the same game and at radically different price points. All right. And I'm missing

[29:35] anyone. Multi more thick. I mean Jerry just got he's got to get that thing out. There's got to be

[29:40] the theme. He keeps he's saying this. He needs a theme that makes people want to buy it years later.

[29:45] We still don't have it. Maybe it should be beetle juice. Jerry that seems like one that no one's

[29:51] picked up. All right. What else is going on? I think that's pretty much it. You know, we cover a lot

[29:56] in that short period of time. It's just a half hour. It's not three hours. I just want to say this.

[30:01] I want to say this. There's been a lot of like push for people to be like overly sensitive in this

[30:07] hobby and be like a polygenic and this and that. And it's just like, look, you can speak your mind.

[30:12] Give us your opinions. Everyone needs to have a little bit thicker skin in the pinball world.

[30:18] And in the pinball hobby, we don't need to personally insult people. But we also don't need to have

[30:23] like our tail between our legs when we're discussing pinball. If you want to sell me something for

[30:28] five to fifteen thousand dollars, I'm allowed to give my opinion about it. And I don't have to be

[30:33] like so sensitive all the time. You know, I even saw like people complaining about how people on

[30:38] the Twitch stream are talking when they're revealing a pinball game and there's like, oh, it's

[30:43] freaking twitch. Like nobody knows better than the twitch streamers themselves. How enane and

[30:50] asinine the chats are. Nobody ever takes a twitch chat seriously. But I got my hands slapped for

[30:57] like just play the game now when Tim Sexton was showing the game and I apologize to Jack for doing

[31:02] that. But come on, like it's like it's a twitch chat. Like go any single like twitch stream in the world.

[31:09] And it's everyone just being a jackass and we're there being jackass is just to have a good time.

[31:15] I just feel like there's like this push where we all have to be like overly sensitive and I just

[31:20] don't want to see the political correct over sensitive world that we live in elsewhere in

[31:26] this society and in the world make its way to pinball where it's just a bunch of people enjoying a toy.

[31:33] And we're like we're kind of jackasses to each other all the time and we're kind of like sarcastic

[31:38] and enane and it's just we're just taking the piss out of like each other at times and out of the

[31:44] hobby at times. And I think that's part of the fun of this hobby and I don't want to see us all just

[31:48] be like you have to say something nice about every single game and you have to respect every single

[31:53] game designer or if they're talking about their game on the internet you are not allowed to say that

[31:58] their game looks bad and you're not allowed to say like come on just play the game and you're not

[32:02] allowed to say get on with it. Come on we're not I don't want to live in a world like that where

[32:07] there's like all these like rules around how we can engage the pinball hobby. Everyone needs to light

[32:12] in the f up all right I don't even I don't think I even curse on this show but lighten up everybody

[32:17] it's just pinball all right and you give your constructive criticism do it your way but we

[32:23] also just also like at the end of the day put this stuff in context of what it is we're actually

[32:28] caring about and nobody nobody should take it too far nobody should get too personal no one should

[32:34] threaten people get into like attack mode don't do that it's a pinball game at the end of the day

[32:40] all these games no matter how great they are that no matter how crappy they are here's what's

[32:44] gonna happen I can tell you how every single pinball machine will go every single game no matter

[32:49] what it is a year from now nobody will care about it regardless of how great it is regardless

[32:55] of how amazing it is that is just the way this hobby is you're all searching for the next great

[32:59] pinball game when games come out that they're like they're super exciting to you guys you guys talk

[33:06] about them for a few weeks a couple months the games ship and then no one talks about them again

[33:10] and then nobody cares and that's pinball it is this very quick immediate satisfaction toy it's

[33:16] super expensive and you guys are just you guys are really just chasing the human connection these

[33:22] things give you that's what you're chasing you love the fact that you have something new to talk

[33:27] about with your friends and with your buddies and the game is just the catalyst to all that excitement

[33:33] in your life it just is you could put anything out in the world and we would have a connection point

[33:38] like we could get together over the Jetsons and like we're all railing on the Jetsons today and that's

[33:43] a lot of fun right and yes you want great pinball machines for your home but for so many of you guys

[33:48] you have pinball collections in your homes you barely play the games you barely turn them on you don't

[33:52] need 20 games you know that you know you have a disease you know you have a problem you know you

[33:57] don't need that many you know it's a ridiculous thing to have so many of because just a few great

[34:02] games is all you really need and what you really want is for them people come over to be impressed by

[34:07] your pinball collection and the happy man wakes up and says you know what no one really cares the few

[34:12] guys that actually care about having a big pinball collection aren't worth it have a few great

[34:16] games in your life be happy be nice to each other be good to each other dudes and you'll have a lot

[34:22] more fun in this hobby and if you want to do a pinball podcast great do a pinball podcast but man I

[34:28] can't wait I can't wait to someone else comes out and does a pinball podcast where they're playing

[34:36] singles tennis I want someone else to just name the podcast after them and it's their show I mean

[34:43] it was like Nate shivers canada but it was coast to coast I want like be the Christopher franchy

[34:48] podcast for all the talk franches done he can't just do your own podcast bro you've got enough to say

[34:55] now you're just gonna be like a recurring segment unlike the slap save pinball podcast all

[35:00] these guys they need to like they need to work together to take down Superman known as canada later guys
