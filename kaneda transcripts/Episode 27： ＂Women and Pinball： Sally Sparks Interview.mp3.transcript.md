[00:00] I'm just a girl in the world

[00:04] That's all that you let me feel

[00:09] I'm such a girl living in captivity

[00:13] You're the only one that before I go

[00:24] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to episode 27 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[00:29] It's a rainy gloomy Monday here in New York City

[00:33] But all is great in the world

[00:37] Because guns and roses have officially reunited

[00:41] They put on an amazing show Friday night at the Trubidor in Los Angeles

[00:46] I got my tickets ready

[00:48] I'm super psyched, going to see them at NetLife Stadium in July

[00:52] I'm also going to Vegas this Friday to see them

[00:54] So all is good, we're in a good mood

[00:56] I want to share with you an interview I did

[01:00] We did this interview, I want to say a week and a half ago

[01:04] The genesis of this interview with Sally Sparks was real simple

[01:09] Wysnow sent me a link to a little, there's like a 15 minute documentary called Player 2 about female pinball players

[01:17] And he wanted to know my opinion on it

[01:19] And so I watched a documentary and actually hit up one of the women in it

[01:24] Her name was Sally Sparks and I asked her if she wanted to talk about pinball

[01:28] And her role in the league and she's also an operator

[01:32] And she actually got right back to me and said, you know Chris, I haven't played pinball in a while

[01:38] I sort of gave it a break

[01:39] And I thought to myself like that was, it seemed like a really interesting story

[01:44] The ability to talk to someone who had been super into pinball

[01:47] To the point where it consumed a lot of her personal life

[01:51] And a lot of her daily hours had that she gave it up

[01:54] And I think that's a story that a lot of us can relate to

[01:57] Who do spend in an ordinate amount of time playing pinball, talking about pinball in the forums

[02:04] And I told Sally, I don't want to just talk about women playing pinball

[02:08] I think that topic has been discussed a lot

[02:11] And we are going to share some opinions about what it's like being a woman in a pinball league

[02:16] She's going to talk about that, what it's like being on the forums

[02:19] But for the most part, this is just an interview where we're going to chat pinball

[02:25] Talk about why Sally sort of took a break from it

[02:28] And what the future holds for her when it comes to pinball

[02:31] So I hope you enjoy it

[02:33] And if you want to be a guest on Kineda's pinball podcast and have an interesting story yourself

[02:45] Let's roll the tape

[02:47] All right ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Kineda's pinball podcast

[02:51] Sally Sparks from San Francisco

[02:53] Who is a former pinball diehard who is still a fan of pinball

[02:59] And Sally has a really interesting story that I wanted to talk and bring to the podcast

[03:06] Sally, welcome to the show

[03:08] Hi

[03:10] And we got connected, I actually got connected

[03:12] Someone sent me a link to the

[03:14] This sort of, I think it was like a 15 minute sort of mini documentary on bells and chimes

[03:19] And I watched it and it was really interesting and

[03:21] Player 2

[03:22] Player 2

[03:23] And I saw you in that

[03:26] And I was watching it was like you know it would be really interesting to get Sally's point of view on pinball

[03:32] And when I reached out to you, actually let me know that you weren't as heavily involved in pinball

[03:38] As you were during that sort of documentary

[03:41] Yeah, no it's weird because I've been approached like when I go out to play pinball now

[03:45] Which is very rarely

[03:47] And people in the pinball community recognize me from that video and it sort of strange because I'm not

[03:51] That person anymore kind of

[03:53] Right

[03:55] Well let's start from the beginning

[03:57] So when did you get into pinball?

[04:00] Like what year were you into pinball when you were young or did you sort of get bit by the bug at a certain age when you were older

[04:06] And then when did you become like a super diehard?

[04:09] Well I've always liked pinball so I've always been around but I guess I really got into it

[04:15] Maybe like four or five years ago

[04:18] Just playing in bars and playing around with friends and the more I played the more I wanted to play

[04:25] And I started going to events and I started going you know I went to the last specific pinball expo

[04:30] And it was the first time being in a space with hundreds of machines on free play and I kind of freaked out

[04:36] That was probably the turning point I got hooked and I started spending all my free time

[04:42] Thank you.

[04:44] Did you get introduced to it through bells and chimes or did you know?

[04:49] Now I met Eka of bells and chimes through other events

[04:53] We had met at a couple of tournaments and we always we just struck up a friendship because we were some of the only girls there

[05:01] We instantly formed a connection and I had already been in the San Francisco pinball department league for a couple of seasons

[05:09] Before she started bells and chimes

[05:13] But yeah she asked me when she was forming it

[05:16] If it sounded cool and I thought yeah let's do this it's awesome

[05:20] Right

[05:22] So there's something interesting so I wasn't really into pinball when I was younger and I was more like an arcade dude

[05:29] And I sort of like the arcade scene for me was like the early 90s when street fighter was coming out and all these fighting games

[05:36] But when I built a little arcade in my New York City apartment and I ended up getting one pinball machine

[05:44] I think I got bit like just a couple of years ago by the pinball bug

[05:48] And what do you think it is about pinball though that does sort of when it when it grabs you you do get like really really into it

[05:58] It's sort of tried to compare it to another sport but you know the satisfaction of playing basketball and sinking a ball into the hoop or playing golf you know and making par

[06:08] Just the feeling of you physically did something with the ball to you know score

[06:15] Right

[06:16] It's like this innate human pleasure to sort of like to have to do that pleasure center like yeah ball in whole

[06:22] And the more you learn the games and the better you get it it's just it's more satisfying the better you do

[06:29] So it's it's I compared to golf all the time actually because you can learn the course you can learn all the rules

[06:36] You can learn all the etiquette can learn everything about it but it comes down to every single hole every single stroke every single swing

[06:43] You can have the greatest game in your life on one machine in the next second just fail miserably

[06:49] So it's it's addictive because you just want to keep getting better and keep getting that fix

[06:55] And unlike arcade games where it's a lot of just like memorizing the patterns

[07:00] I mean that is I think the chaos of pinball right just keeps it fresh and rewarding every time you jump on

[07:05] Right well I mean each machine itself is so vastly different you can have the same program from a arcade perspective on any console

[07:12] But the machine itself is a different tilt and a different you know height and different surface and everything is

[07:20] Could be slightly different so you could play the same game on a different machine and have a different experience

[07:25] Right and you guys so you got really into it so you sort of got picked by the bug and you you wanted to become a better player

[07:32] But you also got into becoming an operator like talk to us about how you got into that part of the hobby

[07:40] Well Sean is one of the busiest operators in the Bay Area right now

[07:47] And he was just a friend of mine that I met through playing and through the league

[07:50] And just through hanging out and watching him just sort of being amazed at how he could fix something that seems so mysterious to me

[07:59] I just sort of lined up at one point where I was looking for a job he was looking for help

[08:06] And it worked out that he was sort of sort of training me

[08:10] I mostly was just doing things like collecting coin and fixing coin jams and replacing bulbs

[08:18] And little minor things like that but I was slowly learning the intricacies of keeping that mechanical beast going

[08:25] And it's just it's really amazing to me I didn't learn a fraction of what Sean knows but it was definitely really fun

[08:35] Right and so I think for a lot of people to in the hobby there's part of it is the playing of it

[08:43] You definitely have to learn how to work on machines if you want to own one

[08:49] Did you ever own machines when you got into it?

[08:53] No, unfortunately I've either never had the space or the finances that you can get a small crappy one

[09:00] The goal is someday I'd really love to just buy a really really janky one or build one from scratch and restore it

[09:06] Because that's kind of my speed but I'm nowhere close to being able to afford anything

[09:14] I've been offered people have offered to loan me their games or whatever

[09:18] But I also just don't have a space in this tiny San Francisco apartment

[09:21] And I think for those of us who live in urban dwellings a pinball machine takes up a lot of that real estate

[09:29] Because I had someone come over tonight and I only I like to say I have room for one machine

[09:35] And what I mean by that is I have room for one where it still looks like a decent apartment with one inside it

[09:44] I had someone come over tonight and they looked at my living room and they're like oh there's room for like four in here

[09:49] Yeah I could make the most cluttered looking living room imaginable and have four pinball machines

[09:55] I think that's when you kind of know that you've gone over the edge

[09:58] I have a lot of friends that just they don't have any more space possible in their house or in their apartment

[10:03] Because everything is machines and good for them but I don't think I could live that way

[10:09] But once you start, once people start having like machines in their kitchen

[10:13] I saw some guy like sleeps underneath the machine in some city

[10:17] I mean in San Francisco I think a lot like New York has a really robust pinball scene

[10:23] So the point of even owning line is kind of mute you don't need to

[10:28] I think at the risk of pissing off a lot of people I think pinball arcade on was it sunny

[10:36] Placation or whatever it is

[10:38] I think that's sort of the urban answer because it's a great way to learn a rule set

[10:42] I think that's really the one reason I would ever want to own a machine is to learn it really really well

[10:48] And to have the luxury of not caring about your quarters and just trying one shot over and over and over again or trying one mode over and over again

[10:57] And that's that's the why I would want to own one but I think with pinball arcade

[11:05] It's a great way to do that same thing without having the space taken up

[11:09] So I haven't really gotten into that I don't have a TV or any game consoles but at friends houses

[11:16] It's really this can be quite fun

[11:18] And when you were sort of going head on into pinball and it's sort of like to start taking over or just sort of start becoming something you thought about a lot on a daily basis

[11:30] How many hours a day do you think you were thinking about pinball and dedicated to pinball?

[11:36] That's a question

[11:38] Well I mean it depends on the day but for example on a league day I would be spending I would get to the arcade really early to work on the machines

[11:47] Make sure there are league ready and clean and sometimes I wouldn't clean them but wax the surface to give some people a hard time

[11:55] So I spend all day doing that and then it'll be a league night and then we'd probably go out after league to play some more

[12:01] And either day before and after league I'd be thinking about pinball all day because league was coming up or league was just over

[12:07] And then I did that twice but I had two leagues

[12:11] In addition to that I had a sort of like an online presence, social media presence centered around pinball

[12:16] So I don't know how to answer that all the time

[12:20] So all the time it almost becomes part of you right?

[12:24] I mean if you're not playing it you're thinking about playing it if you're not thinking about playing it or not playing it

[12:30] You're sometimes you're online talking about pinball

[12:32] Right exactly

[12:33] And anytime it would go out it would be going to a bar specifically the had pinball

[12:37] I stopped going anywhere that didn't happen ball around

[12:40] Right

[12:41] Because that was just what I did

[12:43] And do you feel like it sort of got to the point where what point did you feel like it just

[12:48] Did you feel like it just became too much of your life or what what happened it made you sure you have to give it up for for a while

[12:54] I think I got kind of overwhelmed at some point I was investing a lot of my energy not only working it

[13:01] Which I had loved and and playing with friends and stuff but again like the online thing I started taking it really seriously and taking it really personally

[13:11] There were like fights and weird dramas and like any sort of community

[13:18] There's always going to be some of that kind of stuff going on

[13:20] But when you expand that to the online community, oh yeah, yeah, I just couldn't take it anymore

[13:25] I was just really I was thinking talking about it basically

[13:28] I was just sort of like all right, it's you know, I can't it was my it was my whole personality

[13:32] It was my job my social life

[13:34] Right

[13:35] Everything

[13:37] And yeah, what I've loved it but it just got to be too much

[13:40] Right and what I've noticed too is when because there's like that fine line when it's a hobby and you're having fun

[13:47] And then when it also starts to take over like your you're free time and you're on forums

[13:53] You start to think that pinball is like a really really really important thing in the world

[13:57] Like as important as it becomes yeah

[14:01] If you focus on anything and

[14:03] But it comes in obsession then that's your world kind of shrinks

[14:07] Right and and let's talk about the online forums for a little bit if we can

[14:12] Because I'm I was on pinside for about two years and probably a really polarizing figure on there

[14:21] Because I was sort of like a new guy to the hobby and I remember when I first came on like I was brand new

[14:27] And I would just be like hey, I'm looking to buy one pinball machine and

[14:31] Right away like I had a couple guys I was I didn't know what to buy right if you can have one machine

[14:37] I think it's hard to decide like which one so I really want to get a lot of different feedback

[14:43] And and all of a sudden I started to be labeled as a tire kicker

[14:48] Because I just wanted people to send me pictures of games they had for sale

[14:52] And people were like mad at me for asking for photos

[14:54] It's like you want to know you're selling something for like $8,000

[14:58] Right yeah

[14:59] And you're selling it like the buyer should be able to see like what they're buying

[15:04] And if I don't want it I'm not to blame that I didn't jump and buy it

[15:09] But it was like there's a lot of like I don't know I just noticed like you know people really

[15:13] There were friendly people there were not so friendly people and it just it's it's and I realized though that

[15:19] There was just like always like a group of like 50 people that would just post like every day

[15:25] Like a thousand times a day it seemed like and I got to and I almost became one of those hyper users too

[15:31] And it turned me into like a different person where I was just constantly

[15:35] Embroyed in these conversations and now looking back on a lot of them I'm like why do they even care?

[15:43] Right yeah

[15:44] It's amazing what what it's just amazing what forums and and trolling and it just it seems like such an innocent thing that you can handle

[15:54] But it turns into something it can be really nasty

[15:57] Right

[15:58] And so for a while I think part of the reason I was getting really consumed with it was

[16:06] The sort of I want to say well the struggle for female players such as myself

[16:16] I sort of get recognition and validation I guess

[16:21] And it was something that I started becoming really passionate about because of the backlash that I was receiving

[16:29] And it was really shocking to me that outside of the circle of friends that I gained here in the San Francisco Bay Area community

[16:37] There was this whole it felt like this whole country or world of pinball enthusiasts who were not just like dismissive of female players

[16:46] Like openly antagonistic and aggressive and right

[16:51] And so I started getting really into that and pinseye is probably the worst place in the world if you're if you're trying to investigate that phenomenon

[17:03] Because it's filled with just nasty spiteful hateful people apparently

[17:08] Right and one like so I think it's it's interesting because I think pinseye is evolved since the days of just scantily clad women filling every thread when guys were just bored

[17:22] And there was nothing left or no news left in a thread and it would just become like this

[17:28] You know boys club I think Robin has sort of realized that he he has definitely made an effort to try and make it more of a female friendly site

[17:36] But the problem is and you probably experience this is the second you even say that right like we want to make this a place that's open to more people

[17:45] It almost like fuels the opposition to be even more strident in their approach of being like no like this should just be like a boys club and this is like pinball and they should just accept that

[17:57] So I think it's like it definitely uphill battle and even when you go to the I just came back from the Texas pinball festival

[18:05] Yeah, you have a blast

[18:07] Yeah, it was I mean it was I say it was fun I just want to play pinball what what what what was interesting about I loved it

[18:15] Like I thought that Stern just knocked it out of the park it's so cool like I'm just glad that Stern is doing their thing right

[18:25] Because I think so much of the drama and so much of like leads people to do ugly things and say ugly say ugly things on the inside and other forms

[18:34] Is that people have been burned like for three years straight by like so many boutiques and miss miss release dates and pre-orders

[18:43] And yeah and because what I think creates a lot of the hostility to is you get a lot of these guys are so used to like being in control

[18:52] Because you know I'm going to spend $10,000 on a toy so they have to be financially in a position of power and other areas of their lives

[19:00] So when they get jerked around waiting for like a pinball machine for three four years they like can't handle that lack of control

[19:08] And it comes out in all these ugly ways but Stern you know I just love the fact that they just keep they reveal the machine and they ship it

[19:15] So there's no real true the only drama they always face like the code's not ready and the artwork sucks or whatever people complain about that always is the same argument

[19:24] But it's a great machine they've already like sold out of the LEDs and people are really excited about it

[19:30] And zombie Yeti who's the artist who was working with Jpop is I'm just glad to see him finally get his artwork out into the world and onto a machine that people can buy

[19:40] I just can't wait to play it

[19:43] Yeah I think it's I'm trying to think like when it's going to be in the world there are so many games there that I'm so jealous of my friends got to go

[19:51] Just all these wonderful new titles or unique titles too

[19:55] Yeah Rob Zombie was a lot of fun

[19:57] It's going to be so so so yeah Lebowski is there

[20:03] So this so so like this year is going to be an exciting year for pinball with all these new titles

[20:09] And so are you you took a break right so you sort of said all right like this is taking over a lot of my life

[20:17] I'm getting emotionally invested in the forms like it's there's just a lot of there's a lot of negativity that just isn't healthy for me

[20:26] So I want to just like hit pause on this so how long have you sort of like take stepped away from pinball and sort of are you inching back into it now like what's

[20:35] Oh no it's I it's I

[20:37] I

[20:39] I've been to two league nights this season as a guest

[20:43] Um those recently but before that it was six months

[20:48] That's a long time yeah yeah

[20:52] Um and six months without bells I just I called her here the same time I just I just lay down the gauntlet and say that

[21:00] Not going with the wrong word

[21:02] Sorry motorcycle yeah that sounds like a nice heartily yarn by stop working with Sean and I just really just sort of become became MIA

[21:15] Like really just stopped going around stop going to other events and launches and tournaments and just yeah just completely really just shut it out

[21:26] And were you were you were you happier when you sort of turned it off did you miss it like what was the course I mean I really

[21:34] It was my it was my social life it was my world any free time that I had I was you know with my pimo friends and of course I missed that aspect of it tremendously

[21:45] Um there are the personal factors involved too with that decision but I just I just found like I couldn't spend my time

[21:55] Doing that anymore so I don't know if I've kind of been going out a little bit recently in my free time I've meeting up with a friend or two just to play a little bit but I don't know

[22:08] It's I still love it I still think it's amazing and I just I don't want to do it competitively I think that's probably one of the keys is I just don't really like to do it competitively anymore

[22:19] I like going to the arcade at night when there's not anybody there like playing by myself like I when I first started getting to pinball just playing by myself and yeah

[22:29] Like when I go to expose and stuff I just really like walking around playing just by myself my headphones in and I'll probably I'll probably start doing more of that I just I'm just not into the tournaments and leagues right now I get just sort of overwhelmed

[22:46] Right and I understand that you know I when I got into it and I want to become a better player and then I was getting lessons from the folks at modern pinball and it was having a lot of fun

[22:57] But then I noticed too I have a bunch of friends in New York City who they they're they're in a league and they play pinball and we have like a like a group text that we have it's a I think they're the name of the group is balls of steel

[23:11] And these guys like they're great they're all great guys and I know some of them personally before joining the pinball they play probably every night though and it's so competitive and I I'm on the team but I always feel like I I all this pressure to like win right

[23:28] I think like it's it's at this point there's a tournament at least to a week probably here and league every other week and there's several leagues you know there's quite a few leagues in the Bay Area right now

[23:41] And there's launch and there's just there's so much to do and if you're I was going like every trying to get to every single event and I don't I can't I just don't have the energy to do that anymore there are people that every single night there's something pinball related and I think that's awesome

[23:56] But I have a kid I have you know I work really early in the morning like I just I can't I can't do it anymore and it gets to the point where like you I started feeling left out not left out but like once you stop being in that circle all the time and hearing all the news and all the gossip and all the scores and all the you know who beat who kind of things it's just yeah

[24:18] Yeah out your out and it's hard to sort of dip your toe back into that right and I sort of like I kind of have the opposite experience where I sort of never really wanted to get to into that part of it and I'll tell you why because I would go to work and I would find I would find myself being more stressed out during league night then I would be like at work with like

[24:45] under yeah like I'm like I'm like I was telling my friends I'm like I don't understand like I have all these client pressures but I was more worried about hitting a skillshot and I'm like something's wrong here like this is it's just a game

[25:02] like and I get I get why people love the competitive play and I think what was fun about Texas pinball festival is they have a tournament going on and I actually joined it for the first time and you know those guys are like waiting around for hours and the

[25:18] series business and I was like well how much you know is just a winner get and was like you know it was like decent it was like 2800 bucks if you want and but they kind of like the people who dedicated their time to that like really miss the rest of like the show and they

[25:35] oh yeah totally a little breaks but not really especially the better you do in the tournament the less time you have to really

[25:42] right and I was talking to you but you got to get those points man you're right and if you don't get those IPA points yeah those IPA points yeah if you don't get those like points it's what is life worth it's not with living if you don't have those points it's funny because I was talking to Jerry who's who's the founder of multi morphing the P3 the Lexi lightspeak game that uses the the play field as like a big LCD screen and he was talking about if you look at pictures of people playing pinball like they're never

[26:11] smiling right and there's a good insight he's like you know I just want and he wants to just he's making like these like more sort of some of these games are just going to be simple like many games that kids love and adults love and you know has more of like the joy of playing angry birds but in a you know in a through a pinball machine yeah versus you know this just ultra focus sort of I got to for me what I could never get over was like I

[26:41] just couldn't find the time to memorize the code and what to do in each machine and when I would walk up to a machine like yeah my teammates were like yelling it like you got to do that and doctor who like pick the seven I'm like I don't even what what and then like the ball and I said I can't take it like I'm done I just want to play and I and I kind of like being kind of shitty at pinball but I love playing it and I'm

[27:06] saying here I would never say that I'm a good pinball player I'm a pretty shitty pinball player I just love playing it and I find most collectors like fall into that category they they can enjoy the machine for the beauty of it for the art the art they the shots the callouts the music yeah it's like there's so much it's I still consider a pinball machine to be one of the most amazing pieces of furniture and artwork you can put in an apartment let alone the fact that you're going to see

[27:36] you can interact with it it's it's great so do you still follow like what new pins are coming out it sounds like you know you've heard of Ghostbusters and Rob's

[27:47] I mean honestly it's sort of at this point just through friends Instagram or whatever you know like I'm not I'm definitely not up on everything at all I look at used to be

[27:59] and I think I'm aware of those titles are titles that I'm like really interested in I think those are cool I can't

[28:05] well I've been hearing about the last year for a while now obviously and hobbit but Ghostbusters I just love Ghostbusters as a theme so

[28:14] right and it's yeah that theme that's like one of the themes that history forgot to make a pinball for right

[28:23] there think of all the there's a lot of those yeah there it's it's amazing that it never became one

[28:30] considering it just hits the demographic so perfectly but it's here you know I think we're going to

[28:36] start to see a lot of those like you keep hearing things like big trouble a little China in the months

[28:42] to all these things that that the community's into I assume will eventually get major you know because

[28:47] there's so much volume coming out on the next few years so you you have you have you said you have one is it a

[28:55] son you have Sally yep do you want him to get into pinball are you sort of hesitant to introduce him to this is he

[29:01] it's funny like I'd bring around the arcade and he would play a game or two but he's not one of those

[29:07] kids that just got sucked in at all I've taken him to friends houses that are have tons of games and he would

[29:11] rather play outside in the dirt like he's just not just nothing into it I wouldn't ever block him from it

[29:18] I mean I've always encouraged we've gone to Alameda quite a few times for the Pacific pinball museum

[29:24] because I had a family membership pass for a while and so we would go there as a little mommy sun date

[29:29] every once in a while but he just was never was more for me than for him right or for me to play and it's

[29:35] he just never really took to it but in the future if he wants to of course I will gladly

[29:42] schlep him around to tournaments and whatever he wants to do how it could be a lot worse is he

[29:47] does he how old is he does he get into the machines is it do you feel like the machines are too complex or

[29:53] uh he's six he that I mean it's still sort of like flashing lights and

[29:58] slapping both both buttons at the same time kind of for him but

[30:02] right um yeah he's just not really doesn't seem to really care

[30:07] all right i'm not different well that's what when when um when I was looking at the when Jerry was

[30:13] showing the multi morphing he actually brought up um three kids who are around that age and

[30:20] had them jump on and the the the mini games he's working on and it was amazing to see kids like

[30:26] eyes light up when they can actually figure out what to do and it's he's actually engineered the

[30:30] buttons on the side you can swap him out for like really big buttons are almost like the size of

[30:35] like a softball on each side you you can press and and yes because I think that you know a lot of people

[30:42] are interested in broadening pinball to the next generation and and sometimes I look at the league

[30:48] and i'm like man this is not going to be the way to do it like this hyper competitive stressed out

[30:52] environment is is not what I remember from going to the arcade and discovering these things for

[30:59] the first time so I think one person that's really doing that well is not as um oh my god

[31:06] Nicole up in Seattle with the pinball outreach program she's reached a lot of kids and

[31:12] brought pinball into a lot of lives and I think that's a really cool way to do it

[31:17] yeah it's I mean it's it's definitely getting passed on and I think it's in today's digital

[31:24] world it still remains like one of the only things that you you still need an analog version of

[31:30] it for it to really work and and feel right so it's you were mentioning something salia I think

[31:35] when we were chatting about was it like a comic book around pinball or something you're it

[31:40] am I making this up or no it's um it's kind of one of those it's always had to happen someday kind

[31:48] of projects for me I um I've always been a big comic collector and fan and um the past few years

[31:58] being obsessive pinball has definitely been reading a lot more pinball related comics or RFU out

[32:03] there and I've always known I've always sort of worked on small comics for myself but I know that I

[32:10] I need to sort of channel my story and my energy and comics and the love of all of that

[32:19] so do you do are you an artist you make your own comics or yeah oh cool and so you're thinking that

[32:26] you might sort of combine your love of comics with pinball and sort of have as an outlet for

[32:32] correct project yeah have you gotten started on that yet or is it something we might see in the in

[32:37] the future someday tentative plans and rough sort of sketches have have surfaced but um no real

[32:47] work has been done yet I think it's one of those I just got to buckle down and do it kind of

[32:53] thing so are you do you have plans that go see is it super members is bad men or bad members

[32:59] I always forget the order of the film I don't know which one goes first but

[33:04] I'm right waiting for that to come out on the small screen right yeah I'm

[33:09] those bussards though ladies go bussards I will definitely be there opening weekend

[33:13] yes so let's talk about that so like when that so I I don't understand why there is such a I

[33:18] mean a hoopla yeah I mean it looks it looks really fun I mean the trailer like just should have

[33:25] been edited better someone actually made a new trailer with the same exact footage but they edited

[33:30] a little bit differently yeah it was just it was just such a better trail I mean trick making

[33:35] trailers is just an art form in itself um but I think it's great that there's a reboot and I think

[33:40] the those the women in that cast are great and they've all made awesome movies independently of

[33:46] each other so I have no reason to think that that movie is not going to be hysterical and then be

[33:50] fun and bring ghost buses to new generation I agree um and I think that you know when we look at

[33:58] sort of what can be annoying about the forums right as the feedback was just like like a blanket

[34:05] thumbs down and it's like before before even seeing it I mean and if it's not for like that movie

[34:10] too I like I've been hesitant to say this but if you go back and rewatch the original ghost busters

[34:17] it does it's definitely like a culty classic but it doesn't hold up as well as some of these guys

[34:25] say it does well I don't know about that I mean there are you know it's a whole little topic yeah

[34:30] like it but here's the thing you never see it's like look it's still a great movie but you never

[34:35] really see ghost busters on TV frequently like it's never really airing right that's true right it's

[34:43] I don't know if that's that's true so but what I'm always like why is that like is it like ghost

[34:47] busters cartoon those around the 90s yeah like Ninja Turtles survived like the you know through so

[34:54] many different variations of it even to the point where like I mean once Michael Baytouches your

[34:58] childhood dream is over but ghost busters need it like a something to be relevant again and

[35:04] and like they've been trying to make this movie for for many many years I know Accurator was

[35:08] trying to get Bill Murray to be in it for like years there was always that like controversy where

[35:14] Bill Murray just wouldn't join the project but I like I I think if you're in the ghost busters yeah

[35:21] you got to see that movie I mean it it it looks like a modern version of what everyone loves about

[35:28] ghost busters yeah so I was trying to do this project I typed out this painstaking in painting

[35:35] detail a list of every pinball machine that either was based on a movie or had the same name as a

[35:41] as a movie and I was trying to go down a list or pick off a list by playing the game and watching

[35:47] the movie that it correlated to I didn't get very far because a lot of machines are based on

[35:53] really crappy movies right but maybe it's a project I'll return to someday like Judge Dread Demolition

[35:59] yeah Demolman was looking to mind action oh my god well it seems like licensed pins are almost

[36:08] becoming necessary to sell to the oh yeah I don't think that's definitely at that point yeah and

[36:15] I mean it's a little bit of a shame but it's going to be interesting to see what Pat Lawler's

[36:21] original theme does with Jersey Jack pinball because you know everyone always says we want an

[36:28] original pin we want an original pin you make an original pin and they don't buy it right exactly

[36:32] I understand the need to sort of appeal to it the larger that that's see that's a challenge as you

[36:37] want to appeal to the largest demographic possible of of buyers and the largest demographic is older

[36:44] white men and they want boobs and rock and roll and that's cool I like boobs and rock and roll but

[36:51] you can only make so many acedices yeah nothing against acedices but I was just thinking about the

[36:57] backlash but you know what I mean like I totally support the idea of I don't really love the idea

[37:05] of licensed themes she machines when there are so many great things out there to pull from but

[37:12] I understand the need for it from a business perspective I just I just wish there's a way we could

[37:16] figure out how to have it can't please everybody I know you can't really but I also don't need to

[37:22] offend people either on the main the person that could have done it successfully and it's I'm

[37:28] I still feel sad that his his venture failed was J-pop I mean I think he knew like if you look at

[37:35] John pop it looks like theater of magic and tells the Arabian Knights you know he knew how to put

[37:44] magic under the play field and and and create an original IP experience that you know I circus

[37:53] Voltaire like his game sort of aged really well and and I think even to this day when I play one

[38:02] of his games I think he got the fundamental down that pinball needs to be super fun at the moment

[38:08] you plunge and even if you don't know anything about pinball if you don't know anything about like the

[38:13] rules you you go and do a J-pop game and you know it to shoot like I got to shoot the trunk I got

[38:19] to shoot the genie lamp I got to shoot the ringmaster and his games have been criticized for for

[38:25] being a little bit shallow and not have the deep code but I much prefer that I don't like the deep

[38:30] code I'm sorry that's just for people who really can invest all much I my portal a break and not

[38:37] keep track of all that I'll admit it I can't yeah like simple I like old wood reels I like

[38:43] here is objective knock down these things in this order and it's a simple like here a couple layers

[38:50] but when it gets so deep when there's like what I I'm not gonna get into it I just yeah no I'm

[38:57] I'm this I feel the same way I mean when I'd rather jump off a bridge than listen to someone explain

[39:01] to me what to do in AC DC like I just don't understand like AC DC tonight but I mean

[39:07] well it's like you know it's funny to just like there's people where a game will come out like

[39:12] the walking dead and people are dissatisfied with the code and then like two years later everyone's

[39:19] like now the game's amazing and I don't know apart of me is just always like don't you just get

[39:24] like one chance to launch them like release a movie like I it's just right yeah isn't the hype over

[39:30] with and then you know I'd rather like these companies just finish it and release it the way it's

[39:38] meant to be and then let everyone experience it the right way at the same point in time I really

[39:44] know how that industry works in time in terms of timing when they announce the title but the

[39:50] amount of time it takes between when they announce the title and it's actually finished right versus

[39:55] when it's pre-order like well the way Stern has done it and it's it is definitely like there's

[40:05] two sides of this coin so to make sure that they have pinned shipping pretty consistently they

[40:13] often ship them with with incomplete code it's enough code to put it on location where 95% of people

[40:21] who walk up to a pinball machine wouldn't even know that it's not complete that the that all the

[40:29] code is not there but the home collector the guy who has it like in his house in his game room

[40:37] he is like immediately frustrated because he quickly realizes there's nothing there's not much

[40:42] to do if the code is incomplete and then yes the wait like six months I mean sometimes Sally they've

[40:48] taken up to three years before they've like finalized the code on a game yeah so that's just like

[40:54] I don't know that's like an annoying part of the hobby that it's starting to get better though like

[40:58] Ghostbusters has a decent amount of code where you can play the pinball machine and have fun with it

[41:05] on day one and it'll only get better which someone said to me tonight it was interesting like well if

[41:11] you buy a pinball machine and you're waiting for code it's actually kind of fun because every time

[41:16] there's a major code update it's like you're getting a whole new game right that makes sense yeah so

[41:21] it's fun to watch its progression but you know it's it's it's it's it's gonna be an interesting

[41:30] year though because you know you said you got into the hobby of few years ago yeah so that was

[41:37] sort of right like two thousand like twelve two thousand thirteen like that around them yeah um

[41:43] trying to think of what the newest title was when I I can't remember so that I mean that's sort of

[41:49] like Rowan I mean 2011 was like I think when Tron came out and then you started to get like

[41:55] spider man AC peace oh man Tron came out was so exciting and that title is funny because when

[42:03] it first came out it it went through the same criticism of like the artwork and it and now

[42:09] Tron a Tron is like one of the most the LEDs especially is like one of the most sought after

[42:14] pinball machines you can get I think someone just sold a new inbox one for fifteen thousand dollars

[42:20] which is crazy um but we're we're definitely like in this period now in 2016 where in 2016 there

[42:31] is something like eight new inbox pinball machines that are slated to ship which is kind of incredible

[42:38] there hasn't been I mean yeah the past I guess when you first get into it was like maybe one a year

[42:45] yep pretty much I can't remember it was like one a year and it was just like I could talk about

[42:51] it was like that one eight that's insane well Stern so Stern's gone to the level now where they're

[42:59] they're sort of pumping out three to four now where whether it's a vault edition where they're

[43:06] remaking something like spider man um Stern's rumored so Ghostbusters is confirmed finally

[43:13] they're rumored to have something like I think it's Aero Smith or Iron Maiden is gonna be the next one

[43:18] yeah I don't think Aero Smith I thought it was a rumor yeah I don't really care Aero Smith is like one

[43:24] of those bands for me personally where I'll like listen to some of their music if it comes on

[43:29] but I wouldn't like have it ahead of other bands yeah it's like a it they're kind of like a

[43:37] I don't know for me they're kind of like a little bit like corny rock and roll but whatever I mean

[43:42] I get why they have a following and um I mean Guns and Rose this is my favorite band of all time

[43:48] so I'm looking forward to going to video they're finally reuniting I think if anyone should

[43:52] get another pin it should be them as they that's a pretty good pin too I haven't played that much but

[43:57] yeah people love that pin I mean as I I I should have if I have one pin I should have a Guns and

[44:04] Rose this pin because of how much I love that I have a lord of the rings which I I've loved it

[44:12] it's a great game it's it's I love the movies it's a it's a deep pinball machine but I am I am

[44:17] sort of tired of just like the really long ball times on it and when people come over to play you

[44:22] almost can't play this with three friends who are decent at pinball because you sit and watch

[44:27] someone play a half hour ball yeah I think there's another thing about getting really deep into the

[44:32] pinball community hanging out with pinball geeks it's like it's so much fun but at some point you're

[44:37] playing as good players that you're just sitting around waiting yeah it's not fun to watch

[44:42] I guess you can watch them play but like you play with Andre Mazenkov and it's like okay I'm

[44:46] just gonna go leave have a beer he's gonna eat you come back and still be playing your ball

[44:52] yeah I think I think you're gonna love Rob Zombie because no matter how good you are pinball that

[44:58] machine will just kick your ass and it's and it's fun because it's fast yeah it's it's it's the

[45:04] game just sort of plays you you don't really play the game and I kind of like that about it it's

[45:09] yeah so um yes I have the lord of the rings and you know I'm actually I just bought my second

[45:17] pinball machine I'm I bought a tail of the Arabian Knights just because I always sort of love

[45:24] J-pop game and I'll be honest too when I when I put a pinball machine in my apartment I have to

[45:30] take into consideration the the aesthetics of it sure it has to fit with my decor and

[45:37] machines that have to have more like gold and brass sort of just work better

[45:43] uh as much as I'd love to put like a ghost busters Ellie in here the the the bright green armor on

[45:49] it I just I just it just would look terrible so yeah so um some some trying to think if if I always

[46:00] ask people that are interview Sally if I if I gave you like 10 grand they go by like one machine

[46:08] which would be the one that you would want to just go get um it could be it could be one of the

[46:14] ones I love anything it could be it changes you know it changes for a while there it was spring

[46:19] break I love spring break well heck that's not 10 grand um I know well I don't I'm not I'm

[46:26] in fancy I just like having fun oh uh Jolly Park I really like Jolly Park okay um I would probably

[46:34] I'd probably spend my money on like a really weird rarer like European pain that you can't play

[46:40] anywhere else that's cool yeah I mean that's that's cool I mean it's it would be fun to have one

[46:46] right that people would come over and they did it's not something they see on location everywhere um

[46:51] I feel like if I see another Adam's family I'm just like you know it's like these pins that you

[46:55] see everywhere they yeah it's I if I had a home collection I probably wouldn't have the machines

[47:00] I guess to answer no I just thought about it to answer your question if I had $10,000

[47:03] just find a machine I'd make a custom machine interesting so like you like maybe

[47:08] rethink one or re-skin one with something yeah probably skin one and what what what what would

[47:14] you love to theme it I have always had dream of having a labyrinth machine

[47:22] that just seems to go blend itself really well to different modes for different characters

[47:26] and different parts of the adventure and I'm a big bowie fan of course you know mage now

[47:33] um I mean there's a mil there's seriously I've thought about this question a lot and there's

[47:38] just so many great things out there that I would love to see and play but I wonder if you could

[47:43] do that for 10 grand you know when I watch these guys I don't know I'm always curious I mean you

[47:49] probably could because most of it's just the hours right so the material cost you could

[47:56] probably do it I mean I'm watching I do love watching um threads where these guys will

[48:04] re-theme and make custom pinball machines and and with the p-rock system out there I think the hardest

[48:09] parts the coding so just getting the the actual like game code in there with the call outs and the

[48:15] clips but I I want to guess inside I think you could do it if you're here and it's someone 10k to

[48:23] I don't know though it's I think so let's just say yes you can do it yeah it's done um

[48:31] that mean well I think let's just let's try yeah well that's that's gonna be definitely something that

[48:36] I think we see we see more of and I love seeing when people just do like the one-off

[48:41] re-themed or they they like re-skin Johnny new monarch to be the matrix and oh yeah that was

[48:46] awesome yeah I actually I actually tried to get like one winner for sale and talk this was probably

[48:51] the worst part of like my obsession with the hobby is I the guy want like 20 grand for it and I

[48:59] actually thought that was like a good price and was like getting to trying to get the funds together

[49:04] and I'm and I'm like Chris what the f are you doing like that is it's a pinball machine like

[49:10] there's a point where I can't possibly that fun if your bias is worth like more than a you know

[49:17] several car I don't know yeah I don't want to judge anybody you can spend your money however you want

[49:21] I just I'm so broke perpetually I have I'm that I can't even imagine spending like kind of money

[49:27] on people's shame well it's I think whether you're rich or poor or whatnot like there's a point where

[49:33] it's just it can't be that much like it's it's just pinball you know I always use carguments

[49:40] whenever I talk about pinball people hate me for it because I also enjoy cars but even like

[49:46] the guys who have the nicest cars never want to park him anywhere they're always stressed out

[49:50] about driving them I'm like I'm scratch you want anybody else to drive them and I'll never forget when

[49:54] I was I was like probably in my early 20s and we'd always go to yonkers in central avenue where

[50:01] all the guys with their cars would meet up and there's just like a kid there with like the the

[50:06] most beat up old car ever and he's just doing like donuts in the parking lot and my friend turns me

[50:11] is like you see that kid he's having more fun than all of us here we are at he's right like in

[50:17] the same thing I think it's like with pinball too I mean how many guys like buy pinball machines have

[50:22] them for years and they're like I played it 50 times you know like how did you only play I put

[50:29] like 50 plays on my lower the rings in a weekend when I'm trying to like get through the game and

[50:35] attempt to get to like Valor which I'll never do and

[50:41] but yeah I mean so all right so you'd re-theme it to be labyrinth do you do you ever want

[50:48] the first answer there's many answers but yes the first one comes to mind so based upon the let's

[50:52] let's just let's imagine I force you into having to pick one of the new games between aliens

[50:58] Ghostbusters the big Lebowski um trying to think what else is supposed to be shipping this

[51:05] this year that Rob Zombie which one of the new ones like are you most excited to jump on?

[51:10] if someone's like here's a free machine yeah here's a free machine I uh you know um

[51:15] Kyle Lebowski have you played it yet at any of the rug the rug is really cool it's a

[51:21] composite rug oh the rug and yeah well give me the rug underneath okay yeah I'll take

[51:25] with Valsky I think those guys you know it's either them together yeah it's a really

[51:31] it's a beautiful pin and I hope they can get it shipped soon because they they came out and

[51:36] revealed that two years ago and I think they blew everybody away right I mean yeah I just

[51:41] remember everyone was shocked and I thought I was a rumor for the longer so like yeah no way

[51:46] that's over getting made right and they they were they rocked in the expo like like rock stars I

[51:52] mean they rolled out the rug they've got this huge area and they and the pinball machine looked

[51:57] finished and then it was like well we don't exactly have the license to use all of this and then

[52:04] it's become like a two-year process to get it um to get it official and get it approved but

[52:10] it sounds like this is the year for Lebowski I think what's interesting about this year and

[52:15] just as you know Sally is a spectator even if you're not buying a pinball machine just to watch

[52:20] what happens when all these expensive machines come available at the same time oh yeah it's there's

[52:27] going to be there's I don't think the market can sustain all of them so it's going to be interesting

[52:31] to see what happens and well I'm sure a lot of machines are going to be on Craigslist for cheap now

[52:36] too which should be awesome yeah I would imagine so I keep saying and I think used prices are going

[52:42] go down even further because people need to free up space and this notion that you can just buy a

[52:48] pinball machine and it doesn't lose any value and you just flip it for another one I think that's

[52:52] going to end if there's a constant influx of new machines interesting I mean they don't lose a lot

[52:59] of value but I mean I it's once it's open so I think there's always going to be that the machines

[53:07] that are always be coveted and in classics and nostalgic and all kind of jazz so that's

[53:14] interesting oh yes so if you could change one thing about the hobby what would you change

[53:22] who if I could change one thing about the pinball hobby shit man I guess I would change myself

[53:30] how so I would either be able to be a lot more competitive and join myself or

[53:43] or man that's a good question I don't know I

[53:48] no that's it that's it that's I mean I think that's a really great answer I mean it

[53:52] the hobby itself right is sort of like this I mean it's it's it's it's it's it's great I think it's

[54:01] I mean it's it's fun it's a game right and I think if adults want to spend a time playing I think

[54:08] that's fantastic because I think that's what a lot of us are missing in our lives is just sort of that

[54:14] joyful the camaraderie and the silliness and it's fantastic but I think I got to the level where I

[54:25] just couldn't handle it anymore so maybe the one thing I changed about the hobby is just how I

[54:30] interact with it and is that something that saw you feel like you want to work on sort of changing

[54:35] some of those parts of your personality that's made it hard to ensure that I found a lot of

[54:40] things to them as well right my relationship with pinball isn't as big a priority for me as

[54:47] it used to be so right well I think the good news is it's it's not going anywhere right I mean

[54:51] it's only getting bigger and expanding and I think I think it's going to become a I think

[54:59] there's going to be more room for like the casual fun nature to come back in a bigger way than it

[55:05] had I think I think the competitive sort of hardcore players sparked the resurgence in it

[55:11] but I do think that the the majority of collectors and people who enjoyed pinball and get together

[55:16] and talk about it and play it aren't that serious to the point where it's no longer fun right I think

[55:22] just the enthusiasm of the community has sparked at least sometimes go like more spaces opening up

[55:30] to have arcade and pinball and just a more of an awareness in like sort of the bar culture here

[55:37] so asking more players in sort of a snowball effect so I don't know what will happen but

[55:44] I'm glad that people are having fun right if you could if you could go back two three years ago

[55:53] would you change anything about the way you approach pinball um hmm

[56:05] probably I don't know I think I started out playing and I was sort of like anti competitive I was sort of like

[56:14] thumbing my nose at people who took it so seriously and then I started taking it really seriously

[56:20] so I don't know what change maybe I would go back and remind myself to have fun

[56:29] if you could give the um the forum like one piece of advice

[56:38] that is the story about the forum so I wasn't really I didn't have my own account I would just

[56:43] go on to look at threads and there was one particularly nasty like really just I think it was about the

[56:51] girls of pinball calendar or something like that I don't know but it was I just got sucked in and

[56:56] it was just so horrific that I couldn't keep my mouth shut so I signed up I got an account just a

[57:02] post on this thread and I posted something like completely like I don't even remember I said but

[57:08] I just it wasn't aggressive it wasn't antagonistic it was just like here is my opinion and like

[57:15] instantly I got ejected from pinsoid booted because someone called me a troll and thought that I

[57:20] was like a duplicate account or something like that and got like all these letter no got a couple

[57:25] emails from pinsoid saying that I was reported as I don't even know like I literally post one

[57:32] one post on a thread and was just met with such antagonism that I couldn't believe it

[57:38] so I just have such right it's not respects it at all anymore I think there's other forms that

[57:45] have opened up because of the grossness on pinsoid which I think is really cool like people actually

[57:53] just want to talk about the game and just want to talk about the hobby and not the side stuff yeah

[58:00] and there's so much politics and that's like well I what I learned when I got banned and I got

[58:05] to so we're that makes two of us that's my first post ever that's insane what what what what happened

[58:13] what can happen on that site is there's like this I there is like this calamity of like

[58:22] people like small group of people that run to the moderators and rile them up and the moderators are

[58:29] doing this as like charity work like they're not getting paid and moderating that site is is a nightmare

[58:38] for them because it's like yeah it's like all these grown men acting like little babies all the time

[58:44] when I say that I mean the people who cry to the moderators and be like you have to eject this

[58:48] person you have to like really like you're a grown man talking about pinball and you just can't

[58:55] if you have a problem with someone either PM them or or say it back to them but it's funny it's like

[59:00] these little it's like this like like childlike behavior where you're gonna run until the teacher not

[59:05] just deal with the issue that isn't front of you but yeah they're like very quick to it

[59:11] threat eject and ban people and especially if you if they you have to feel like you duplicate

[59:18] account but it's not it's not I just don't think it's worth it I mean I I got banned my permanent

[59:23] banan was because I played the hobbit or played the hobbit for a day and my friend was playing

[59:28] and he sent me a picture where the hobbit ramp broke at the bar and so I posted a picture of the

[59:34] broken ramp and just said hey like anyone who's ordering the hobbit this might be something you

[59:40] might be worried about that it just broke one of the test games and I've been sort of critical of

[59:48] the Jersey Jack model for a few threads just because I'm critical because you're allowed to have

[59:55] an opinion yeah and like one and the things it's like this mentality where you're not allowed to

[59:59] have an opinion unless you're actually buying the game but that's that's BS like I can have an opinion

[01:00:03] about them about something going on in the world even if I'm not buying it and there's enough to

[01:00:10] formulate an opinion right it's not like I play and I think that was a thing so I played that

[01:00:15] game more because it was a New York City than people who were telling me to shut up it was a great

[01:00:20] game they never played it right um it just gets like annoying too because I just reached I'm actually

[01:00:25] happy now that I'm off the site and I'm well it's like I find this podcast to be my outlet and I

[01:00:36] can sort of say things on it that no one can moderate no one can thread eject me for my own

[01:00:43] statements and I don't have to politic and and play nice all the time either like I can put people

[01:00:50] in their place and I do it on some of my podcasts without the fear that I'm going to be banned

[01:00:56] because when you do get addicted to the online forums and you you almost have like your online

[01:01:02] avatar becomes like a separate part of your psyche and your personality it it can be devastating

[01:01:08] when they remove that from your life I mean I have other friends too like they're so into the forums

[01:01:15] that if they lost that they they couldn't they wouldn't know what to do with those hours they got

[01:01:20] back in their day because they had dedicated so much of their free time to it and I sometimes

[01:01:25] think that people look at I I love Pimball Sally but it's not all I have going on in my world

[01:01:32] like when I when I go to Texas Pimball Festival that's not like them event I've been waiting all

[01:01:38] year to go to like it's I have a lot of fun at it I love talking to the people but there are people

[01:01:44] where this is like this is the thing like and they will this is the thing that matters the most

[01:01:51] more than politics more than religion more than their families it seems like even like it's like

[01:01:56] they talk about Pimball more than they probably call their moms you know and it's like yeah

[01:02:00] it it can get to that level of obsession but it's it sounds like Sally like you're in a good place

[01:02:06] where you're sort of our in control of what the future has with with with your relationship with

[01:02:13] Pimball and I do hope you let it in a little bit and have fun with it again because I think it

[01:02:20] when you can when you can enjoy it as the game that it is it's fun to as you know to play it every once

[01:02:25] in a while I always yeah I I know that it's going to be in my life probably forever I got I met

[01:02:34] Rudder Sharp at the Pimball Hall of Fame in Vegas a year ago like this month I went there from

[01:02:42] my birthday and we struck up a correspondence the nicest guy ever and I got a card from him

[01:02:52] and this right when I was quitting Pimball and I emailed him saying like I thank you so much I

[01:02:59] I don't you know I'm stepping away from Pimball right now got a lot going on and all this kind of

[01:03:03] stuff and he said that he found that no matter what is going on in his life good or bad or stress

[01:03:08] or anything he there's just always Pimball that there's always that sense of escape and fun and play

[01:03:16] and I really cherish that idea that regardless of the people involved regardless of all the politics

[01:03:24] all that everything that there is just like this thing that exists out there that I get joy

[01:03:29] and pleasure from that will always be there for me even if I don't play it every single day I can still

[01:03:35] know that is there I think that's very well put and well said and you know and once you learn how to

[01:03:41] play Pimball right it's like riding a bike you can you can spend six months I didn't play for like six

[01:03:49] months and I came in like kick people's butt so yeah well it's not great too when you step away

[01:03:54] and you're actually you're better it could just more relax and not think about it too hard

[01:03:59] that's like yeah that's like golf for me like I suck at golf I've never really played it much and

[01:04:05] when you know if I take a break I'm really good but then when I try to play it every day I'm

[01:04:09] shank in the ball like this sucks I'm not playing anymore but um yeah yeah definitely um well

[01:04:16] still I really you know thank you for coming on the show and and talking to us about I mean I'd

[01:04:20] love to every once in a while you know strike up a dialogue if if you're yeah I check in

[01:04:27] yeah I'd love to I mean I think you know as you even play some of the new games coming out of

[01:04:32] life did you get your feedback on it I hope you can um share some of your opinions on this podcast

[01:04:39] and it's it's it's it's it's not a judgment zone and we can just talk sort of casually about

[01:04:45] Pimball and and and and get your back in new it a little bit without getting you like she had the

[01:04:50] chance to talk about it without feeling the pressure yeah that no it's what we don't worry I'll

[01:04:57] never be talking about like tournament play and I have PA points and and pop up rules and all that

[01:05:04] stuff um I think it's I think you know tournament play is great for the people who love it and

[01:05:11] I I will probably always finish last and in every tournament I ever enter so it's and it's

[01:05:17] as long as you're having fun trying to smile lightly then that's what exactly and and I think

[01:05:23] um you know what what we've been talking about tonight is a good reminder for everybody out there

[01:05:27] that at the end of the day these things were designed to make people have fun and they were

[01:05:34] they were put into our kids to give people quick moments of of pleasure not long drawn out moments

[01:05:41] of stress and you know finding that balance is not always easy um but uh I think Sally you've sort of

[01:05:51] you're on your road you're on the road to flying that right balance and I think we've we've given

[01:05:56] people a lot of interesting stuff to think about as they approach the hobby because I think

[01:05:59] everyone has their own personal relationship with it and it it affects us all in different ways so

[01:06:05] I appreciate you sharing your story with us and we will definitely check in periodically and see

[01:06:09] how things are going all right we'll have a great yeah have a great night and I hope you get

[01:06:15] to play Ghostbusters and I think you're gonna love it yeah yeah okay cool all right thanks

[01:06:21] sorry thank you all right well that was Sally Sparks ladies and gentlemen I hope you enjoyed the

[01:06:27] interview with Sally um really interesting story that I think a lot of us can relate to uh in

[01:06:32] terms of how consumed by Pimball we can get and I think for most of us out there Pimball is a

[01:06:39] game that we love it's a game that should always be fun to play when when things get too stressful

[01:06:44] or we get too invested in it and it loses it's fun it's time to to hit pause and take a break right

[01:06:50] so without further ado I want to say happy Monday people and by the next time we talk which will

[01:06:56] be soon I got another special report uh and my tales of the Arabian Knights should have arrived it's

[01:07:03] it's in New Jersey right now so look forward to getting at game and telling you how I feel about

[01:07:09] the tales of the Arabian Knights goodbye everyone
