[00:00] Do you know what it feels like? Love it someone, but see we're rushed through you way

[00:07] Do you know what it feels like to be the last one?

[00:12] To know the love on the door has changed

[00:16] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit

[00:20] Ah, I love it, I love the energy, I love the screams of the Canadian theme song

[00:24] Somewhere out there all the Canadian haters are screaming

[00:27] And because here we are, we've got 620 episodes of the main show

[00:33] And now we're on episode 14 of the Canadian Club

[00:36] Welcome everybody to Club Canada

[00:38] If you're brand new to Club Canada, a very special welcome because we surpassed 200 Patreon contributors last night

[00:47] We are now at 203, I want to welcome Eric, Aaron and concrete hard tea to the party

[00:54] Ken, Eric, Aaron, all the new members

[00:57] And all of you out there who have been a member since day 1

[01:00] Thank you so much

[01:02] Here's what I want to talk about on this Club episode

[01:05] I want to deconstruct the David Fix interview

[01:08] If you haven't listened to it yet, I recommend you turn off this Club episode

[01:13] And you go listen to the David Fix interview

[01:16] And then come back here

[01:18] And I want to give you sort of like my true feelings about that interview

[01:22] First I want to say thank you to David Fix for doing the interview

[01:25] If you heard that interview and you've heard my show over the years

[01:28] Every time I do an interview, it always

[01:31] And I mean this, 100% of the time

[01:34] It always makes the person I'm interviewing come out looking great

[01:39] They come out talking to the largest pinball podcast audience

[01:44] I give them a very respectful stage to talk about their vision and what they want to talk about

[01:49] And I know I've talked to guys like Robert Mueller and Fools like that

[01:53] Who got to spew all their garbage

[01:55] And I just wanted guys like Robert to talk so you could hear how ludicrous their plans were

[02:00] Now I want to talk about the David Fix interview right now

[02:03] Because David Fix said some stuff that I think was really interesting

[02:07] And I think it's stuff that I want to tell you how I feel about it

[02:10] Ultimately, I want to tell you what I think their opportunity is

[02:13] And I think their major challenges moving forward for American pinball

[02:18] I didn't want to challenge him on the show and on the interview

[02:22] Because here's why

[02:24] I have not seen the fruits of their labor yet

[02:27] Until they show us what they've been working on, not just the junior designer stuff

[02:31] But the Dennis Nordming game, until they show this stuff

[02:35] If I were to criticize it at this point

[02:38] At this point, I would be a bully

[02:40] Now, now I've got on the record and I've publicly said that I do not think

[02:44] Legends of Vahala will be a good theme

[02:47] I don't think it will sell

[02:49] Now he didn't tell me it was going to be Legends of Vahala

[02:52] But if it is that, hmm, you know, I don't know how that's going to do

[02:55] But let me get right to what I think the big challenge for this company is going to be

[02:59] And it was on the show and he said it

[03:01] And he confirmed for everybody out there

[03:03] The next two titles from American pinball are going to be original IP games

[03:10] Now here's why I think this is going to be super difficult for American pinball

[03:15] First and foremost, when I heard that, it made me feel like they really haven't learned their lesson

[03:22] Now, Houdini and Octoberfest were both original IP games

[03:27] They're not like original, original IP games because both of those IPs are based on stuff in culture

[03:34] That they did not create

[03:36] Like they didn't create Houdini, they didn't create Octoberfest

[03:39] So if they make a game like Legends of Vahala

[03:43] You could argue that that's also not original original IP because they did not create Vikings

[03:50] But here's the main question I have for everybody listening right now

[03:54] And this is what I was thinking about when he said that

[03:56] Have you ever seen a pinball company in modern times be successful selling back to back original IP games

[04:07] And we haven't seen it, we haven't seen it from anybody

[04:11] In fact, if you were to ask another question

[04:14] How many original IP games have been successful even on their own in the pinball marketplace?

[04:22] David used an example of the dialed in launch at pinball expo as a moment in which people celebrate it in original IP game

[04:33] Now I didn't challenge him on this

[04:35] But if you watch the expo reveal of dialed in when they pack that room and he was right they pack that room with 300 people

[04:44] But I was watching online like a lot of you and I had friends in the room who were there when it happened

[04:50] When they pulled off those sheets and they revealed dialed into the world

[04:55] You could hear a pin drop in that room

[04:59] People were not excited, people were sort of like shocked at what they saw

[05:04] They didn't really warm up to it

[05:07] If that had been anything else like the matrix or big trouble or transformers there would have been a standing ovation

[05:14] To welcome Pat Lawler back to pinball because you got to remember right

[05:18] This was Pat Lawler's like three to five year in the making opus title that he was going to put everything into this jersey jack machine and blow us away

[05:27] And then it was dialed in

[05:29] And to this day dialed in has not been a sales success for Jersey Jack pinball

[05:35] A dirty little secret about dialed in is the amount of time and money Jack Winari invested in this game

[05:41] And it flopped when you look at it through that filter

[05:44] Pat Lawler took three years to make this game and X amount of money and Jack was expecting the game in like a year to a year and a half in development

[05:52] It took twice as long to develop and it sold half as much as they needed it too

[05:57] Not only that, what Pat did by forcing Jersey Jack into a new cabinet he basically messed up everything they had going with Hobbit and Wizard of Oz

[06:08] You went from a wide body company, you went from all these parts that were designed to be wide body to a standard body game

[06:15] And now they had a completely retool everything and that is another big reason why Jersey Jack pinball sort of ran out of money

[06:23] Okay, but that's not my main point so dialed in kind of not really a success

[06:27] Okay, then we go over to TNA now arguably TNA is the most successful original IP game I've seen since I've been covering pinball

[06:38] TNA was a game in which spooky pinball acquired Scott Denise's home brew game that he made in his basement

[06:46] And they sold roughly 550 of them which is a success when you consider the fact that this was a completely original game

[06:55] That spooky pinball's goal and target was right around there this was an absolute success

[07:01] But remember success at 500 units is good for spooky that's not the target of a company like AP that's surely not the target of a company like JJP

[07:13] So then let's look at the other original IP game that's stern made black knight sort of rage

[07:20] Another game another game that was basically a commercial flop

[07:25] And so then you have to look at all of these original IP games and how hard it is right?

[07:31] How hard it is for them to sell in a marketplace that's giving you themes like Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Guns in Roses, Willy Wonka, Batman,

[07:42] Jurassic Park, Godzilla, right? The list goes on and on and on, Alien, the Big Lebowski, everything that has a license attached to it comes with a fan base in the millions

[07:56] So how do you launch a pinball machine in a market like that where it's based on a theme that nobody really knows

[08:04] Where it's based on a theme that doesn't have a built in following

[08:07] See then what you're banking on is one thing you only have one fan base to emotionally connect you and that's just pinball players

[08:16] You need a game that's actually like amazing to a pinball fanatic

[08:21] And every time we see original IP games like Cosmic Carnival is a great example

[08:27] Why did that game flop? Keltz, another example, why did that game flop?

[08:32] Because these aren't games that are even good on a pinball level

[08:37] I would argue that TNA, that TNA is a little bit of an anomaly

[08:42] It was a game that Scott Denise brought around to different shows for a long period of time

[08:49] He built a following around the game

[08:52] He made everybody feel good about supporting the game

[08:55] I would also argue that TNA came out at the right time in which people were just looking for something unique and different

[09:03] And his game definitely was that the light show, the music, the fast paced nature of that game

[09:11] It was like a different flavor of ice cream to people who love ice cream

[09:17] And it was a flavor that was very delicious to a lot of pinball fanatics

[09:21] Now TNA could not sell to just casual people who want a pinball machine

[09:26] Because those people are going to put something in there that they connect with

[09:29] TNA sold to fans of Scott, it sold to fans of pinball

[09:34] It didn't sell to a broader audience

[09:37] And so let's take it back to American pinball

[09:40] For them to be successful for this to work

[09:43] And again, I don't know yet what the games are

[09:46] For this to work, a few things have to happen

[09:49] First and foremost, the games themselves have to really click with the pinball enthusiast

[09:56] Which means there needs to be stuff in these games that feels unique

[10:00] It feels like you're not getting it anywhere else

[10:03] And it feels like something that breaks up the monotony of what the other manufacturers are providing

[10:10] It almost needs to be so good on a pinball level that you are willing to forget the fact

[10:16] That there is no license theme

[10:19] That's a really big challenge

[10:22] And that's a really big hurdle

[10:24] Will they be able to do that?

[10:26] Now if it's legends of Vahala

[10:29] And we've seen this game, we've seen this game you can google it, it's on YouTube

[10:33] If it's that game, I can tell you right now

[10:37] That I don't believe that game has enough of that to really win people over

[10:43] I don't

[10:44] The other thing too, it's not just gameplay right, does the art package, does the music, does the callouts, does the code

[10:51] Have enough in it that makes people say this is worth purchasing

[10:57] All of us out there will play anything right

[10:59] If I see a new pinball machine at a show, I'll jump on it, I'll enjoy it

[11:04] Almost all pinball is fun

[11:06] But for them to launch a game that makes you want to own it

[11:10] There needs to be something special now

[11:12] It's clear from the interview that American pinball will be competitively pricing their machines

[11:17] So I do not expect their deluxe edition of this original game to be anywhere near $10,000

[11:25] If I were to guess, I think the classic edition of an AP game is going to be $6,000

[11:32] And the deluxe edition is going to be $7,500 to $8,000

[11:36] And that's it, they're not going to go over it

[11:38] They know that, they can't charge as much for an original IP game as a game that requires an expensive license

[11:46] And so they are going to try to use price as a way to incentivize people to buy

[11:51] And that's going to work in their favor because if you look at the prices of machines right now

[11:56] They're astronomical, the prices are pushing more towards $15,000

[12:00] And less towards $5,000

[12:03] It sounds incredible to say that, but we're getting closer to $15,000 for the kinds of machines people want

[12:10] Then we are to $5,000, which is what all of these machines used to be just a few years ago

[12:16] When I was talking to David, the part that really did confuse me

[12:20] And this is something that we'll see

[12:22] You know, we'll see because I'm still like, I'm not quite sure

[12:25] I'm not quite sure, they quite get it, like they get the marketplace

[12:29] Is that I think he did legitimately feel that the dialed in launch was a success

[12:35] And he said it, and I thought he was going to say something like, oh you know, like it was mixed results and lukewarm response

[12:42] But no, he said people jumped on the game, they loved the game

[12:45] And here's the danger in marketing

[12:48] Sometimes when you know, I've got to market this thing

[12:52] So he knows deep down inside what the next game is

[12:55] Maybe it's Legends of Bahala, maybe it's Sherlock Holmes

[12:58] He knows what his cards are, right? He knows what hand he has

[13:03] And sometimes in marketing, the biggest challenge is you can get tunnel vision

[13:09] You can start to see things the way you want to see it

[13:12] Because you need to see it that way to feel good about what you have

[13:17] Because you still want to win in the marketplace

[13:19] And so I think he looks at that dialed in launch

[13:22] And a little bit with rose colored glasses that hey look that worked, we can make it work

[13:28] I just don't see AP coming out with an original game that has nearly as much in it as dialed in

[13:34] I also don't think a game coming out from a brand new designer will bring you a fan base like Pat Lawler's or Steve Richie's

[13:43] And that's the other major hurdle here

[13:45] If you're an iconic pinball designer from yesterday's years

[13:48] There's a good chance that you have a legion of followers that have loved you for decades

[13:53] So what happens when you bring out a brand new game from a brand new design team

[13:58] There's almost no fan base

[14:00] Again, Scott Denise built that fan base by going around to all those shows all those months

[14:07] And that is why I said the way to market a game like this

[14:11] American pinball's next game

[14:13] It's not to do what they're gonna do

[14:15] It's not to just pull the curtain off at one day

[14:18] They really need to bring this game around to shows they need to win people over

[14:23] They need to win goodwill with the community

[14:26] They need to convince you and it's gonna be a longer convincing if it's an original IP

[14:31] Then if it was matrix then if it was like top gun right it's gonna take a while

[14:37] To sort of build up enthusiasm for something brand new

[14:41] I'm not saying it's not gonna work but that's such a more difficult pathway to success in pinball

[14:48] Than doing what Stern does, then doing what Jersey Jack does, then doing what even spooky has done

[14:54] And the other part that's just crazy is I've never seen someone go back to back on original IPs like this

[15:02] Normally, normally you've got your original game and then you've got your big license game ready to go next

[15:08] The fact that Dennis's first title is original that has me worried

[15:13] It has me worried because what happens if the first game doesn't sell really well?

[15:19] What are you gonna do? What if the line's not really jammed with orders?

[15:23] What do you do then? Do you quickly bring Dennis's game out?

[15:27] But what if that game doesn't do well? I don't think in this industry there is any room to survive

[15:34] If you have two flops in a row now the only company that's really survived with two kind of flops in a row has been American pinball

[15:43] But there's gonna come a point where Mukesh and the aimtron money that is obviously being funneled into American pinball

[15:51] He's gonna get tired of it and it does feel like Mukesh hit up David to steer the ship in the right direction

[15:58] And this is his shot, but the part that I just can't get over if you do market research

[16:04] And you know what it takes to sell pinball machines and sell pinball machines sight unseen

[16:09] This is not how you do it and I just wish after all this time of being able to evaluate the marketplace

[16:16] I think they needed a title that was just a take my money now kind of title that at least had a fan base

[16:24] So we shall see we shall see if they can pull this off the good news is this

[16:29] We're gonna be able to see what their thing is in just a couple weeks

[16:32] I mean David said the game will be at expo and we might see it before expo

[16:37] So they've got a really steep hill to climb

[16:41] They've got a strategy that is proven not to really work well for pinball companies

[16:47] Will they be able to do it?

[16:49] Will AP be able to come out with an original IP game or two that really impresses people and gets people to buy it

[16:57] We'll see we'll see and it's gotta be appealing to the home buyer right they can't expect to win at the operator level

[17:05] Every time someone tries to compete at the operator level they're competing with Stern

[17:10] And now Stern's got their insider connected which makes their products even more appealing to operators

[17:16] And AP doesn't have anything like that

[17:19] Jersey Jack has nothing like that nobody else has anything like that Stern owns the operator pinball market

[17:26] There's no way to beat Stern at what they're doing there so time will tell

[17:31] Time will tell what else is going on club members?

[17:33] I always try to be a little bit more candid with my club members about things going on

[17:37] You know I'll be honest I never heard back from Ryan White and it was really disappointing

[17:41] And this is not a personal attack but it was just a really weird thing he did

[17:45] It was really weird that he called me up told me he was gonna do all this stuff for me

[17:49] Then completely ignored me and then completely went against the things he said he was gonna do

[17:55] And it's strange because even after all of that right even after he avoided giving me the information when he said he was

[18:00] Even after he put up the press release I mean I just texted him and was like look man

[18:05] It's cool like whatever no response tried to get him to sort of respond

[18:09] And I don't get that the reason I don't get it is he reached out to me

[18:14] That was the funny part he reaches out to me

[18:16] Says he wants to work with me says he wants to give me exclusives

[18:20] Then Dale's doesn't communicate and then he stops and he goes me now

[18:25] And that's that's my relationship right now with Ryan White

[18:28] Pinball drama is so boring doesn't it suck? I hate talking about like the pinball personalities

[18:33] The pinball this the people want to talk about the games and let's finish on a game

[18:37] This is a game where I think right now and I mean this

[18:41] I think this game right now is getting more excuses made for it

[18:46] I absolutely respect spooky pinball

[18:49] I respect spooky pinball I think they were very smart

[18:52] I think they launched their games at the right time

[18:55] I think they've made the best playfields in all of pinball

[18:58] I think they've improved their product with every single new game they've had

[19:02] Absolutely

[19:03] Spooky pinball is how you build a company slowly and how you build it up

[19:07] I'm concerned about Halloween

[19:09] I think Halloween is a game every time I see the video every time I play it

[19:14] Every time I see what's going on with the code in that game

[19:18] I get really concerned

[19:21] And I think there are a bunch of owners who are getting very delusional about what should be in a pinball machine

[19:28] And I'm afraid to talk about it

[19:30] I really am

[19:32] It's like if Halloween is supposed to be a scary pinball machine

[19:36] The only thing that's scary is what happens when you actually are honest about it

[19:41] Because when you're honest about what you're seeing

[19:44] You get absolutely attacked by the owners of this game

[19:48] And they don't want to hear it

[19:51] It's the weirdest thing ever

[19:53] I've never seen a more vicious group of people than spooky pinball fans

[19:58] Who will defend everything about their games regardless regardless if there's any merit to your concerns

[20:05] I mean I've seen it with like Rick and Morty

[20:07] I mean my friend Rare Hero if you say anything bad about Rick and Morty

[20:11] The vitriol of defense that comes at you is unbelievable

[20:15] But I can't understand how anyone who appreciates the way a pinball machine should shoot

[20:20] Would ever like Rick and Morty the game doesn't shoot good

[20:24] And everybody knows that

[20:25] Even people over at spooky know that

[20:27] The game doesn't shoot good even Scott Dinesi admits that there were some design mistakes

[20:31] When they moved that upper right flipper

[20:33] They didn't move everything else on the left side

[20:35] So he created a lot more of a clunky gameplay experience

[20:38] But don't tell that to spooky owners who have it

[20:40] They'll tell you you just gotta dial it in and then it plays so smooth

[20:44] No it doesn't

[20:45] No it does not

[20:46] But here's my concern

[20:48] Is that the real issue with Halloween is all the code

[20:52] It's the code and the animations and those things can be fixed

[20:57] But my concern is that people are not accurately expressing how they feel

[21:04] Because they are afraid they will be attacked

[21:07] And I'm seeing it go on in the thread right now

[21:10] And I'm seeing it go on not just about the code

[21:13] But the animations in that game really people

[21:16] You're really gonna spend nine to ten thousand dollars

[21:19] And think that those animations pass in a pinball machine in 2021

[21:24] You look at the LCD right you look at the clips

[21:26] It's just not coming together very well

[21:29] It really isn't and look that's my opinion

[21:32] Here's the thing and I'm just gonna say this

[21:34] And here's my real feeling on this

[21:36] And I'm just gonna say this and I mean this

[21:38] I don't ever want to buy something like a pinball machine

[21:41] And I don't want to play something that's ten thousand dollars

[21:44] That's made by experts who get the focus on that machine for years

[21:48] Like they're developing these things for years

[21:51] The moment I jump on something like a toy like this

[21:55] And I start playing it and I feel like this should be different

[21:58] That should be different

[21:59] Those animations aren't good

[22:01] Where are the call outs?

[22:02] How come I don't know what to do?

[22:04] I don't want to have to give feedback to fix something

[22:09] That a company that is focused on this

[22:12] That should be experts on it

[22:14] They shouldn't make you want to change their product for the better

[22:19] I'm sorry

[22:20] The moment the community has to get together and solve your issues

[22:25] That's a problem

[22:26] Nobody jumps on a lime in sheets game

[22:29] And it's like hey lime and here's the ten things you need to do

[22:32] No! And at these prices

[22:34] You should get close to perfection in pinball

[22:38] And I know there's people who will continue to make excuses

[22:41] There's people who will continue to accept washed out LCD screens that don't have true black

[22:46] Yeah, they're still using the same screens that they did in Rick and Morty

[22:49] The same screen they did in TNA

[22:51] These are not better LCD screens

[22:53] So if you want a pure black screen

[22:55] You're gonna have to replace it the way Canada did when he replaced his Rick and Morty screen

[22:59] It's like a $5 part

[23:01] Can't change that

[23:02] But I want to be able to have like a discussion about this game without being attacked

[23:06] I know Charlie and company have thick skin

[23:08] I know inside those company walls they wish they had a little bit more assets than they do in the game

[23:13] But building a ship in the ocean like this

[23:15] It's dicey, it really is dicey

[23:18] Like you could do it when you're stirring and it's Batman 66

[23:22] Like you could put out a game that doesn't have much in it

[23:24] And you know it's lime and sheets

[23:26] You could do it with Jersey Jack and you know it's Keith Johnson

[23:29] But can you do this with a spooky game?

[23:31] I don't know, I don't know

[23:33] Ken Fosma

[23:34] Figure out both Ultraman and Rick and Morty

[23:37] Two games at once, it's twice as much on his plate

[23:40] I'm just not convinced they really have the resources to take this game to the place it needs to be in 2021

[23:49] And I'm afraid to say it and it's terrifying because I don't want to be attacked

[23:53] Because I don't even like the Halloween movie

[23:55] I'll be honest, I don't even like this franchise

[23:57] It doesn't matter that much to me

[23:59] But even so, if I don't even like Godzilla that much

[24:03] And I look at the Godzilla pinball machine

[24:05] I see so much amazing Godzilla stuff on the screen and I see amazing code

[24:09] Same thing with guns and roses

[24:11] If I don't like guns and roses

[24:13] I can really appreciate what they're doing with the guns and roses code

[24:16] Even if I don't like Halloween

[24:18] I should be able to look at what's happening in that game

[24:21] And appreciate the effort that went into what's on the screen and what's in the code

[24:27] And the callouts and everything

[24:29] And I just can't yet

[24:31] And no it's early, don't crucify canada

[24:34] It's not my fault that companies want to sell you stuff way before it's done

[24:38] And that all I can critique it on is the unfinished product

[24:41] That was their decision

[24:43] It wasn't mine, it was theirs

[24:45] And I think we're at a point now where a Chicago gaming company is going to drop cactus canyon remake completely finished

[24:52] And then they're going to have a Lyman Sheets version that enhances that

[24:55] But it's going to be done, a complete game with new code

[24:58] The Lyman thing is all new additional code

[25:00] So I just am worried about Halloween

[25:03] Which means I'm a little bit worried about Ultraman

[25:05] Which means I'm a little bit scared that we can't give feedback without getting attacked

[25:09] Do you guys feel the same way?

[25:11] I feel this way about when I give spooky feedback

[25:13] I feel like these owners are like angry

[25:16] It's like they're angry

[25:18] How dare you insult the game that I've never played

[25:22] This is them, they've never played it

[25:24] They've never flipped it, they've never seen the code

[25:27] And if you've played it, like I've played this game more than most of these owners

[25:31] I've been the jack bar, I've played the game

[25:33] If you say something negative

[25:35] Don't reign on the thing that I already ordered

[25:38] I mean it's too late for these people

[25:40] They've already bought the machine

[25:42] And 1,250 Halloween people have put down deposits that are non-refundable

[25:48] And that's why you're seeing so many pop-up for sale

[25:51] Again, it's a dirty little secret

[25:53] Nobody wants to talk about is that people can't get out

[25:57] They can't just get a refund

[25:59] Imagine if they offered refunds when people saw what was up on that screen

[26:04] How many refunds do you think people would ask for?

[26:07] Spooky did the smart thing, they locked everybody in

[26:10] I'm just terrified, canada can't say how he really feels about Halloween

[26:14] But I'll say to them when I see them

[26:16] This is not how I see this movie coming to life in code format in a pinball machine

[26:21] Does anyone disagree?

[26:23] Like email me at canadapinballadgmail.com

[26:25] Email me if you've seen something that's really blowing you away

[26:29] If it's really blowing you away

[26:31] I also saw on the thread too some guy came in and was like

[26:34] G&R sucks, G&R has no mechs

[26:36] And then someone's like

[26:38] Where the mechs in Halloween and Ultraman

[26:40] I mean think about it

[26:41] True mechanisms, true things that the ball interacts with

[26:45] That really changes the gameplay

[26:47] There's not much in either game

[26:49] I mean I would argue that there is no outstanding mechanism in Guns and Roses and Spooky's Halloween and Ultraman

[26:56] I think both of them do not have an amazing mech

[26:59] To me an amazing mech is the T-Rex in Jurassic Park

[27:03] An amazing mech is the building in Godzilla

[27:06] An amazing mech is like the disappearing magnet in Tales of the Arabian Knights

[27:11] An amazing mech is the castle in medieval madness

[27:14] Those are amazing mechs

[27:16] Don't look at G&R or Halloween and look for an amazing mech

[27:21] I would love there to be amazing mechs in both games but there are not

[27:24] Everybody thank you so much for contributing

[27:26] This has been a nice little Friday morning sitting on my soapbox

[27:30] Talking to just my club members about pinball

[27:33] Hopefully, hopefully Cliff Albert feels like this show was different enough from my main show

[27:40] Because otherwise, otherwise Cliff is going to yank his $5 a month

[27:43] And I'm not going to know how to feed my kids

[27:45] So come on Cliff, I hope you enjoy this

[27:47] I just gave you a shout out

[27:49] And an extra special shout out to Ed Roberts and Ed

[27:52] Thanks for the contribution

[27:53] I know how much money you make Ed

[27:55] You can bump it up buddy, you can bump it up

[27:58] Anyway guys, have an amazing weekend

[28:00] And we'll talk to you soon, Canada out
