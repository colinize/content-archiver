[05:38] I'm lonely.

[05:40] I can't think it all.

[05:45] Gonna live my life.

[05:48] I'm lonely.

[05:49] If you need a friend.

[05:59] You'll look to a stranger.

[06:23] You know in the end.

[06:27] I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the ride.

[06:51] I'm lonely.

[07:01] I'm lonely.

[07:11] I'm lonely.

[07:14] I'm lonely.

[07:24] I'm lonely.

[07:34] I'm lonely.

[07:44] I'm lonely.

[07:54] You're an idiot.

[08:06] If I had a silence looking down the path of blue.

[08:14] I'd find myself alone again, all alone with you.

[08:22] I can see behind your eyes the things that I don't know.

[08:30] If you hide away from me, I can alone.

[08:37] I want to know what you're thinking.

[08:41] There are some things you can't hide.

[08:45] I want to know what you're feeling.

[08:49] Tell me what's on your mind.

[09:20] You're all of a sudden.

[09:29] I can't sleep by your obsession.

[09:33] I'm hoping that you'll feed.

[09:35] There's no balance.

[09:37] You're a quality.

[09:39] You still, I will not accept defeat.

[09:44] Yes, I will have you.

[10:38] Kasite Go Units

[10:40] Your city boy

[10:43] Notin' right, but some pizza

[10:48] They took him me, and that didn't even go away

[10:54] Every time I think of you I feel a shot right through the ball all through

[11:18] There's no problem in mine but it's a problem I find

[11:22] Living a life that I can't leave behind

[11:26] There's no sense in telling me

[11:30] The wisdom of a fool won't set you free

[11:34] But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows

[11:38] Well, everything's my confusion growth

[11:42] When I die, but you tell me that you build a time machine

[11:46] If you're gonna build a time machine, why not do it some style?

[13:06] Everybody is looking for something

[13:10] Some of them want to use you

[13:14] Some of them want to get used by you

[13:18] Some of them want to abuse you

[13:20] Some of them want to be abused

[13:38] You know, there's gonna be sex, drugs, rockin' life

[13:40] Fuckin' with rockin' life

[13:44] I just died of your arms tonight

[13:50] Must have been something to say
