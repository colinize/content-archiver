[00:00] If I could turn back time, If I could find a way, I'd take back those words that'll hurt you and you'd stay.

[00:30] I'm going to give half of you out there who are not a member of the Canada Club this show for free, then I'm going to stop it.

[00:42] If you want to hear the whole show, you're going to have to sign up for Canada's Pinball Podcast because I want to reward my club members for their loyalty.

[00:50] So here's what I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about how this company has really had an interesting ascension in the pinball world.

[00:58] And here we are on a Thursday. They're going to reveal a game and I have detailed information on what I'm hearing is the number of games they're going to make.

[01:08] But more interesting than how many games they can make because Spooky Pinball has never been a company that's ever been questionable when it comes to manufacturing.

[01:17] And they have a lot of goodwill there. Remember, this company's never taken anyone's money and then not delivered.

[01:23] They've never promised something and then not delivered. So there's no concern about whether or not you're going to get your game.

[01:30] This isn't Haggis Pinball where you're going to pay in full and then wait like eight months to maybe get your game.

[01:37] Has anyone even noticed that there's no shipment container going from Australia to America?

[01:43] Like only people who are paying for the air freight are getting their fathom pinball machines.

[01:48] There's no excuse for that, but I haven't been like beating on those guys because it's not even fun anymore.

[01:54] But here's the thing with this game. Scooby Doo. It's a great theme. It's a great theme for pinball.

[01:59] It's a great theme for a company called Spooky Pinball.

[02:02] But what I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast is simply this.

[02:07] As a pinball community, I think we usually approach a new game with a certain number of questions.

[02:14] I want to talk about how after all of these years, Spooky Pinball still is getting special treatment or is approached in a different way from every other pinball company.

[02:26] And I understand why at the very beginning we approached Spooky Pinball a little bit differently.

[02:31] They were a tiny boutique company in Benton, Wisconsin. They made only 150 of their first title and their games were cheap.

[02:39] They were like $5,000 to $6,000. Now, fast forward to today. This company is now cranking out 1,750 games in an 18 month period.

[02:50] And now you can option out a Spooky game with tax to be near $11,000.

[02:57] And also Spooky Pinball has turned on what I think is one of the worst practices in all of pinball, the non-refundable deposit.

[03:05] And that is what's going to happen probably on Thursday. They're going to ask you for your money and if you want a game and if you want one, you're going to be locked in with that money.

[03:15] And for many of us out there, if we could turn back time, we probably would not have pre-ordered both Halloween and Ultraman if we knew the way the market was going to go on both games.

[03:26] So what I want to do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, I want to talk about Scooby-Doo.

[03:31] And have we forgotten all the lessons we learned with Ultraman and Halloween? Or are we simply delusional because we're excited about a new theme?

[03:39] And here's what I want to do on this podcast. I don't want to indict Spooky Pinball because I don't blame Spooky Pinball for anything, really.

[03:47] There's simply a company making a product. Whatever decision I want to do with my money is my decision.

[03:53] What I want to do on this podcast is I want to encourage everybody in the pinball community to think about these things as you go into a new pinball purchase.

[04:03] And this isn't just a new pinball purchase with Spooky. This is how we should really approach our decision-making in pinball in general.

[04:11] Now, there are going to be some specific things too spooky that you need to consider because this is a unique company and they ask more of you than most pinball manufacturers out there.

[04:22] And there are also more question marks and more things you need to think about when you buy from a smaller company like Spooky.

[04:29] Okay, so where do we want to start? I want to start here. Normally, when we get enthusiastic about a pinball machine, there are two things that usually rise to the top that make us want the machine or not want the machine.

[04:43] These are the two things where like if this happens, I'm excited and if this happens, I'm excited. And normally those two things are this.

[04:51] It's normally the theme of the game and then who is designing the game. Those are the two most important factors before you really jump on a machine.

[05:02] Those are the two things that are going to give you confidence. And I would argue that a very close third place to that is who is coding the machine.

[05:11] I've been following this hobby for 10 years and I didn't know who Pat Lawler was when I started in pinball. I didn't. I didn't know who John Borg was.

[05:20] I had no idea who Keith Elwin was and a lot of people out there in the world don't know that. It's easy to sell a game on theme alone to an absolute newbie who has no clue.

[05:32] But for everyone else in pinball, any educated pinball buyer, that is going to be what really carries weight.

[05:40] And pinball designers become sort of like movie directors. You trust them. You know who's really good. You know who's mediocre and you know who's not that good.

[05:50] And when you have a series of hit games in a row like Keith Elwin, he's like the Quentin Tarantino of pinball. You don't have to worry.

[05:58] You'll never be nervous buying a Keith Elwin machine. At this point, you don't need Keith Elwin to prove to you.

[06:05] He knows how to design a good pinball machine. And look, the hardest thing in pinball is to be consistently good as a designer.

[06:13] I mean, you could look at guys like Steve Ritchie. They have some games that people absolutely love. And then they have games like Led Zeppelin, which people are absolutely bored of.

[06:23] Now, look, Steve Ritchie has a reputation for making games with great flow. So if you buy a Steve Ritchie game, you're not going to get a game with a lot of stop and go.

[06:33] You're going to get a game that's fast, right? Star Wars is fast. Game of Thrones is fast. Led Zeppelin is fast. Black Knight is fast. AC DC is fast.

[06:41] Like, you're not going to get a sluggish game with a lot of toys. If you buy a game from Eric Manear, who's only had two games so far, you're going to get a game with a lot more like Mechs.

[06:51] A lot more stop and go. He doesn't have a reputation for being a designer who designs flow. His designs are more stop and go. His designs are more multi-ball heavy.

[07:01] And then you get a designer like Keith Elwyn, who arguably is number one for a reason. Because the guy not only has like incredible flow, he has really unique shots.

[07:11] He can put a lot of interesting design elements into a single standard body pinball playfield. He also can put a lot of fun toys and interactive mechs into his games with games like Godzilla and Jurassic Park.

[07:24] And he also knows, and this is the greatest thing about Keith Elwyn, when he's designing his game, he also has the rule set and how the player's journey is going to be in one of his games.

[07:35] And so when you play a Keith Elwyn machine, for the most part, there's a lot of cohesiveness to it. Although I would argue that Avengers is still the most confusing game on planet Earth, but for the most part, Keith Elwyn doesn't just design the layout.

[07:48] He's really thinking about the rule set and the player's journey through the game, and that's why Keith Elwyn is number one.

[07:55] Okay, so let me ask you right now. On the eve of Scooby-Doo, who's designing Scooby-Doo? Do you even know the answer to that question?

[08:03] Now the answer to that question is most likely going to be Bug. So this is the junior team over at Spooky Pinball.

[08:09] Now Bug designed Halloween and Ultraman. Charlie's basically handed the company over to like the younger generation at Spooky Pinball, and so this is his soft, more title Scooby-Doo.

[08:21] His first designed game was Halloween and Ultraman. Now look, I've played a lot of pinball machines.

[08:27] And I will tell you right now, those two machines are not the greatest shooters, right? They're not the best designed games. They don't have great flow.

[08:36] They're an improvement over Spooky's previous titles, but if we're to be honest with everybody, Spooky's previous titles, they've been indicted for being very clunky.

[08:47] If you ask anyone who's a real great pinball shooter about Spooky's earlier titles, the best shooting game is America's Most Haunted.

[08:54] After that, they became a little bit of a brick fest, like really tight shots. And so I think what people did like about Halloween and Ultraman is it opened things up a little bit.

[09:04] But I would also argue that, you know, there's not the best flow in the game. You lose sight of the ball all the time in those games.

[09:11] And look, some people like these games because they are different. So when it comes to Scooby-Doo and what will the game design be, I think it's a big question mark.

[09:20] We have no idea what they're going to deliver from a design standpoint. Now, here's the thing I think everybody needs to make sure before you buy this game.

[09:30] You need to make sure you're going to enjoy shooting it. I can guarantee you nobody out there can really raise their hand and say, hey, like I love shooting bug designed pinball machines.

[09:41] Because Spooky doesn't have the pedigree of games that make you feel confident, I just think you need to be careful that this is going to be a game you're going to enjoy shooting.

[09:52] Are you going to be able to determine that by a video of the game? Are you going to be able to determine that on Thursday when they show you gameplay elements and then they ask you for your nonrefundable deposit before you flipped a single ball?

[10:07] I just think you need to be cautious. I'm not telling you not to buy it. I also want to say this. I absolutely believe everybody should get a chance to wow us.

[10:17] Look, I was not impressed with his first effort. I was not impressed with their first effort in the design standpoint, but that doesn't mean that the sophomore effort from these guys won't be great.

[10:29] And so we have to wait and see. I would be the biggest jerk in pinball media if I got up here right now today and told you these games are not going to be good.

[10:40] I have no idea how much fun it's going to be. I have no idea what the design is. I have no idea what the mechs are.

[10:46] So I'm going to have to wait and see like the rest of you. But as someone who got burned on Ultraman in Halloween, there's no way I'm going to buy before I actually jump on one of these machines.

[10:56] I mean, that's just me. And I encourage each and every one of you to do the same. And you can tell I do have an agenda. And my agenda is this.

[11:03] I want to get rid of nonrefundable deposits. I think it puts the entire onus on the buyer to make up their decision in a short amount of time.

[11:12] And it puts absolutely no onus on the pinball company to make sure they make a great game. And I mean that.

[11:18] But look, the power is in our court. As consumers, if you don't go in on a nonrefundable deposit on day one, think about it for a minute.

[11:27] The only reason you would need to go in on a game on day one, if you think the game is going to sell out and the only way to get one is to have to pay more money for the title.

[11:38] I'm here to tell you right now, the other rumor I'm hearing is that spooky pinball has increased the number of Scooby-Doo's they are going to make because they saw the difference.

[11:47] Because they saw the demand, they saw the hype, they saw everybody on pinside saying it was a dream theme.

[11:53] I'm hearing the rumor is that they are going to increase the number of Scooby-Doo's from 1200 to 1500 games.

[12:03] Do you really think you're going to have a hard time getting an order or getting a game if they're going to make 1500 Scooby-Doo's people?

[12:12] Wake up everybody. Look, it's a good theme, but it's also a property that we probably haven't watched in like 30, 40 years.

[12:21] Rick and Morty is a cartoon for adults. Like kids are not watching Rick and Morty with all the cursing in it and all the violence in it.

[12:29] So you got to remember that. And so here's my point. I think everyone should have some calmness going into Thursday.

[12:37] We don't like calmness. We like hype. We like FOMO. We want to feel like we were lucky to get one of the few machines.

[12:45] And because spooky pinball doesn't really limit their collector's addition to a certain amount and they're going to make as many collector's additions as people want to order,

[12:54] and we know the distributors are going to order a ton of them. I don't think there's any FOMO around this game.

[13:00] I don't, especially after the last two titles. I don't think there's any FOMO.

[13:05] Okay, so then what's the next question we should be asking? Who's coding this game? Because the software and coding in pinball is so critical.

[13:14] I mean, we've seen it before, right? Software can actually save a game that's not the best shooter. Hello, The Walking Dead. Hello, Batman66.

[13:25] There are so many examples of how the right coder and the right software engineer can step in and take a mediocre game into a masterpiece realm.

[13:36] It's just the way it goes, right? I'm also hearing a rumor that the code team on Scooby-Doo, this might also be the first game that they're working on.

[13:45] And look, we need young talent in pinball. We need fresh ideas in pinball. I'm not saying the game's not going to be great.

[13:53] What I'm saying is we're going to have to see more. You absolutely have to see more of something if the people working on it are brand new.

[14:01] It's the same way at work, right? If I've been doing what I've been doing for 20 years, my bosses don't need to see what I'm going to put in front of a client.

[14:11] They don't. They trust me because I've been delivering the goods for so long.

[14:16] With these new designers and new coders over at Spooky Pinball, I implore each and every one of us, we have to see what they're capable of.

[14:26] Again, if they knock it out of the park, they are absolutely going to sell this thing like hotcakes.

[14:32] But here's the hard part. Here's the hard part. I think on Thursday, they're going to show us what they want to show us.

[14:40] And this becomes the tricky part. How do you know you're going to see enough on Thursday to pull the trigger on a nonrefundable deposit?

[14:49] The other part is this, and I'm just going to say this because I've got to keep them accountable to their word.

[14:54] When they sold us on Rick and Morty, they said they were going to continue to put new seasons into the game.

[15:02] That they structured the code in a way that they could put new adventures from future seasons of Rick and Morty into the software.

[15:10] They've never done it. They've never added more. They've never added stuff from future seasons into the game.

[15:17] So look, what does that mean? That means you also have to take what a pinball company will tell you on sales day with a little bit of a grain of salt.

[15:28] Of course, there will be things they intend to put into the game, but they might run into complications and they might need to start working on the next title.

[15:37] Alright, so what else do we know about this game? Should I do what Knade does best? Should I give you a rumor?

[15:41] Should I give you another rumor I'm hearing around Scooby-Doo? I'm hearing that this game has four flippers, four full-size flippers in the game.

[15:49] I'm also hearing that there is a major sculpt, sort of like a building that takes up the whole back of the game.

[15:56] I'm hearing that the Mystery Machine van is inside the game as well. So we shall see. So I don't know. I mean, come on.

[16:03] I mean, there's only so many ways you can even describe a pinball machine you've never seen.

[16:07] Like, it has a lot of toys. It has a lot of flow. It has beautiful artwork and it's got great call-outs.

[16:13] Okay, so here's how I want to end this podcast. I want to just end this podcast by saying, on Thursday, if Scooby-Doo is a dream theme for you and you're going to buy it regardless,

[16:24] then it doesn't even matter what I say. If you're on the fence and you want to see more about the game, I encourage you to just wait a little bit.

[16:33] And I know what people are saying. They're going to say, like, Knade is trying to sell against Spooky Pinball's effort to sell you games with non-refundable deposits.

[16:42] And I want to be completely candid. I am absolutely doing that. I am absolutely encouraging you not to give a non-refundable deposit until you play the game.

[16:53] This game is not going to be hard to get. It's not. You're going to be able to get one and you're not going to have to pay over MSRP.

[17:03] I'm almost willing to guarantee that, even though I won't, the market will dictate that. Everybody needs to wake up from the fog.

[17:10] This isn't tiny little Spooky Pinball anymore. These aren't cheap little mom-and-pop shop made games anymore.

[17:18] These games are going to cost you, if you fully feature it out, more than a stern premium. These games are going to cost you more than a Keith Elwyn machine.

[17:28] And I'm not saying that's a bad thing. Spooky is keeping up with the Joneses and they're keeping up with the times of where Pinball is going with pricing.

[17:36] But I think it's completely fair for me to say, as someone who got burned on Ultraman, and let me talk to you real quick about my Ultraman burn, it wasn't their fault, but here's the reality.

[17:45] If I went in on a $2,000 Ultraman deposit and I actually took possession of the game, so I lost $2,000 on my Ultraman number 500 with Butter Cabinet.

[17:57] So that game with taxes is about $10,500. You can go get an Ultraman with Butter Cabinet for like $5,500.

[18:08] So if I had continued to go in on that game, I would have lost another $3,000. If I had simply waited, think about this for a minute.

[18:18] If I had just waited, I could have bought Ultraman for 40% off of MSRP.

[18:25] Now look, Ultraman was Charlie's decision. It wasn't a great theme selection for Pinball. It wasn't a great move. They didn't need to do it.

[18:35] Obviously the Halloween's are holding a lot more value than Ultraman. Obviously Scooby-Doo is a far better theme for Pinball than Ultraman.

[18:44] Scooby-Doo, it is a good theme and I don't know which way the market's going to go on it, but I don't think it's going to go over MSRP.

[18:52] Because MSRP at Spooky now, when you get the Butter Cabinet and you get all the bells and the whistles, it's super expensive.

[19:00] It's also not going to be rare because they're going to make so many of them. I also think now that Spooky is at this price, the next move they need to make,

[19:09] if they really want to create first day FOMO, you know, non-refundable deposit, take my money now, the next move they're going to have to make,

[19:18] they're going to have to limit the number of collector's editions they make.

[19:23] They're going to have to say, if we're making 1500 Scooby-Doo's, only 500 of them are going to be able to come with the Butter Cabinet and those are the CEs and they come with a topper.

[19:35] The other 1000 are like our premiums and we will make those premiums for as long as we want.

[19:41] I mean, I think they're going to have to go that way because I just don't think they're going to hook so many people with these non-refundables

[19:48] and then every single game can be the same collector's edition. It doesn't create the scarcity. It doesn't create the FOMO.

[19:55] It's crazy that we're in 2022 and when you tell people in the pinball community, maybe you should test drive the game before you buy it.

[20:03] People are going to be mad at me. They're going to say I'm rooting against Spooky.

[20:08] They're going to say like I did this podcast to try to prevent them from getting sales. I'm not.

[20:13] My new position in life is this with Pinball. The distributors and the sales forces, they should be the people absorbing the risk because they are profiting on every game sold.

[20:25] Why should you be taking the risk as a consumer? Why shouldn't you just let the distributors buy the allotment?

[20:32] Let's just play this scenario for a minute. Imagine Spooky's making 1500 games. Why do you want to buy direct?

[20:39] The only reason why you'd want to buy direct, if that was the best price possible, but that's not the case, right?

[20:45] Now the best price possible for almost every new machine in 2022 is if you buy used. You can get Rush for cheaper than new.

[20:52] You can get Toy Story for cheaper than new. You can get Halloween for cheaper than new. You can get Legends of Ahala for cheaper than new.

[20:59] You can get Ultraman for cheaper than new. Think about it. Like 80% of games that just came out are now cheaper than they were brand new.

[21:07] But think about it like this. Imagine if they make 1500 Scooby-Doo's and all of them just get allotted to the distributors.

[21:14] Think about that for a minute. You don't have to buy it right now. You don't have to lock in your money.

[21:19] And then when you go to buy a game, you pick the distributor who's got one available when you're ready to buy it.

[21:26] Imagine that, right? Like car dealerships. Like I'm going to go buy a car and then I'm going to buy it from the dealership that has one available.

[21:32] At the end of the day, aren't these just boxes getting loaded into trucks and arriving at your house?

[21:37] Are we always hearing that from distributors? Like they want to have inventory?

[21:41] So imagine a world in which consumers aren't absorbing most of the inventory. That the inventory is going to a distributor.

[21:48] So a distributor sells a game. How much money are they making on a game? They're making money on every game sold. Are you?

[21:54] You're not. If 2020 has shown us something, if you bought every single new game, 80% of them you lost money on. And that's just the way it is.

[22:01] See, I think there's a big change coming to pinball people. I think there's a big change coming. And I think we're going to see it in the next couple of years.

[22:08] I think you're going to start to see more inventory sitting with distributors and they're going to have to start discounting these games to find homes for them.

[22:16] Think about if you have an Ultraman Neuin box right now. Just think about that for a minute.

[22:19] Imagine if you have an Ultraman Neuin box and you're a distributor and it's got a butter cabinet on it. How the heck are you going to find someone to buy it for like $10,000?

[22:28] How are you going to find that person? Same thing with Toy Story LE. You have Neuin box Toy Story LEs. How are you going to continue to find people to buy it?

[22:36] If everyone on the secondhand market is selling them for $10,000. So all I'm saying everybody is this. Be cautious.

[22:43] Make sure you play these machines. Make sure you see enough before you sign on the dotted line that you can't get your money back.

[22:53] That's all I'm saying. I hope Spooky knocks this game out of the park. I hope all of our concerns are unwarranted.

[23:00] I hope they don't make boneheaded mistakes like hedge multi-ball. I hope the quality is there on these games as well.

[23:07] We've seen some really concerning quality issues on the new TNAs. Just drilling extra holes in people's games when you messed up the apron alignment.

[23:17] I hope they figure this all out. I hope they slow down. I hope success does not make them run too quickly.

[23:26] And I think ultimately this company will be better off if they take their time and they get it right and they don't rush things.

[23:35] I'm glad to see it's just going to be one theme. I think the big problem with Halloween and Ultraman, they were not staffed up to code two different themes at the same time.

[23:45] They were overly ambitious and it didn't really work out. It didn't really work out for us. It worked out for them.

[23:52] They secured all the money on day one and we shall see what happens on Thursday. It's going to be really interesting to see what direction it goes in.

[24:01] Will it be a day one sellout? Will we see games available for a while? My feeling is this game will sell really well for them, but they're not going to sell out.

[24:11] I think distributors are going to have them for a while and I think if you wait to buy one, you might be able to get it for less than new.

[24:19] I don't think you're ever going to have to pay more than new for a Scooby-Doo.

[24:23] And I think that's a good thing. I think we're going to start to see more and more of that in the pinball world.

[24:28] For many years it was like you can make money on everything. Those days are over. Those days are over.

[24:34] The only way you can make money on stuff now is if the game is a masterpiece.

[24:39] And I've said it and I'll say it again. At these prices there is not a lot of room for mediocrity.

[24:45] If you come out with a mediocre game, your game is going to lose thousands of dollars because the base price is so much higher than it was three, four years ago.

[24:54] We're talking a 40% increase on a lot of these titles over the last three to four years.

[24:59] Okay everybody, thank you for tuning in to Canadian Spinball Podcast. We are now officially back into the Twippy Hunt. We'll talk to you soon, later.

[25:29] Thank you.
