[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canade's Pinball Podcast.

[00:56] We're going to be talking about the current list prices for the creme de la creme version

[01:01] of a lot of games that have come out across the pinball universe over the last few years.

[01:08] Let's look at what they were new.

[01:10] Let's look at what they are at right now.

[01:13] We're waiting on Pokemon any day now.

[01:17] Maybe it's this week.

[01:18] It's going to be within the next week or so.

[01:21] There's nothing else really happening other than Beetlejuices are going to start to go

[01:26] out the door in just a few days.

[01:29] Spooky's introduced tokens which I like.

[01:32] You can play the game and do achievements and get tokens which unlock different wizard

[01:39] modes later on in the game.

[01:42] It is now January 12th.

[01:44] There are a lot of people that love pinball around the world.

[01:48] A lot of us have been in this hobby for a long time.

[01:51] Some of you have been in this hobby just much more recently.

[01:55] I know what it's like when I got into arcade collecting.

[01:58] I know what it's like to not know what things used to go for.

[02:03] I also know what it's like to remember this used to cost that and now it costs this and

[02:11] how that triggers so much anger.

[02:13] These little Neo Geo cabinets I have, they used to sell like 20 years ago for like 1500

[02:20] to $2,000.

[02:22] Now they're more like 8 to $10,000 if you can even find one.

[02:27] Now the thing I like about what I'm about to do is every single game I'm about to list

[02:32] is available for sale today.

[02:36] No waiting, no having to put pre-order money down on a dune topper 8 months from now.

[02:42] Everything that I'm about to say you could reach out to the seller and make an offer

[02:48] and maybe have the game by next weekend.

[02:52] This is all real tangible pinball.

[02:55] No speculation here and the numbers don't lie.

[02:59] Love that phrase because they don't.

[03:02] So let's start right now with Stern Pinball, a company that is really making the most pinballs

[03:09] out in the world.

[03:10] I think everybody out there has a little bit of a love-hate relationship with Stern.

[03:15] We appreciate everything they've done.

[03:17] We appreciate the fact that they make four machines a year, some cornerstone, some remakes,

[03:23] more like four to five if you think about the anniversary editions and the remasters

[03:28] and the cornerstone games.

[03:30] But I think universally everybody's just struggling with Stern's new price point.

[03:37] It just hasn't really worked out for anyone who's gone in early on any of these Stern

[03:43] games.

[03:44] An analyst.

[03:45] Star Wars.

[03:46] Fall of the Empire.

[03:49] A $13,000 machine just a few months ago, a couple months ago.

[03:56] There is one that just sold for $9,900.

[04:01] So that just sold.

[04:02] That seems to be the price where these things will move at, which is over a $3,000 lost in

[04:08] just a couple months.

[04:10] And there is one unsold right now for $10,500.

[04:16] There are a lot of these things new in box, not even opened up for around $11,9 they are

[04:23] asking.

[04:24] I don't think they're going to get that, especially with an open one being worth around

[04:28] $10.

[04:29] There's no reason why anyone's going to spend $2,000 for the cardboard box because none

[04:35] of these games have any plays on them.

[04:38] As we all know, Star Wars just was an abysmal failure.

[04:42] It doesn't mean it's not a fun pin.

[04:44] I should have said that at the very beginning because I can hear people be like, well, I

[04:47] jumped on it and it's fun.

[04:49] And it's a great game for operators.

[04:51] This is not what this podcast is about.

[04:53] It's about if you were to buy one of these, new in box, this is what you can now get it

[04:57] for in pretty much perfect condition.

[05:00] And so Star Wars didn't do well.

[05:03] There is no data right now on the walking dead remastered Elise.

[05:08] I think we saw some self around like 11.5.

[05:11] I think some dealers and distros were making some deals.

[05:14] But right now I tried to look it up.

[05:16] I didn't find anything on pin side.

[05:19] Let's go to King Kong, man.

[05:20] King Kong, Ellie, Ed Robertson's favorite game on tour.

[05:25] King Kong, Ellie, another $13,000 game.

[05:29] There is one for sale right now that you could have for $9,800 or best offer.

[05:36] You know, what does that mean, right?

[05:38] The good old OBO, which basically means shave at least $500 off the price and you'll have

[05:45] a deal.

[05:46] So we're looking at Kong, Ellie, another game, a Keith Elwin game, right?

[05:50] The King and the Monsters didn't hold, didn't do very well.

[05:54] Let's go to the next recent game, Dungeons and Dragons, Ellie, the Tyrant's Eye.

[06:01] Seth Davis's Eye.

[06:03] He's got his eye on the market.

[06:06] Another $13,000 stern available today if you want to buy it for $9,800.

[06:16] Do you see the pattern here, people?

[06:18] That the world considers stern Ellie's to be worth around $10,000.

[06:26] Remember when Godzilla came out?

[06:29] It was $10,500.

[06:34] Everything is sliding in the stern world to $10,000.

[06:39] Nothing is sliding from $13,000 to $15,000 anymore.

[06:42] Let's keep going because there's a game here now, which I think some people are like, no,

[06:47] it's not true, Canadian.

[06:48] There are some games that have gone up in value.

[06:50] Metallica remastered, Ellie.

[06:52] I remember when this game came out.

[06:55] People were spending over to get one.

[06:57] They only made 500 of them.

[06:59] New art package, new code, sexy game.

[07:03] People dropped 18 on this game.

[07:05] It is now for sale if you want one today for $12,950.

[07:12] Look, it hasn't gone up.

[07:14] It went down 50 bucks, but it's holding.

[07:17] It is holding, but you see, this is more of the anomaly than it is the everyday occurrence.

[07:24] We go to Jaws Ellie, another game that has been bolted to the floor.

[07:29] There's one available for sale right now for $11,995.

[07:35] Not a big loss.

[07:36] Not a big loss.

[07:37] We all know what happened to Jaws Ellie.

[07:39] The damn 50th anniversary with the nicer play field is the reason why these Ellie's are

[07:45] now going to keep going down.

[07:49] Stern keeps burning its own customers.

[07:51] They did it again on Jaws.

[07:53] We're seeing people with Ellie's swap in the 50th anniversary play field because they love

[07:59] the theme so much.

[08:01] Stern needs to just really reevaluate this strategy.

[08:05] You just never want to make people who love the theme so much ever have to feel like a

[08:10] nicer version of the thing they love has come out after they bought the top of the line version

[08:18] from you.

[08:20] There are some deals out there though, people.

[08:23] Let's keep going.

[08:24] The Uncanny X-Men, another $13,000 game.

[08:29] How much do you think you can go get in Ellie for today?

[08:33] How about $8,500 is the best price you could offer?

[08:39] Again, with all of these prices, remember, none of these things are sold.

[08:44] You could always negotiate more money off unless it says firm, but nothing's firm in

[08:49] this hobby.

[08:50] Not even your ding-dongs, people.

[08:52] Okay, so X-Men, huge loss there.

[08:55] That is a, whoa, whoa, I'm trying to do the math right here.

[08:58] That's $1,500 on top of $3,000.

[09:00] That's a $4,500 loss on an X-Men, Ellie.

[09:05] Now here's the crazy one.

[09:07] This game got made fun of more than anything Stern's done recently.

[09:13] People made so much of a big deal that there were no guns on the artwork.

[09:19] And yet when you go and try to find a John Wick Ellie, guess how many are up for sale?

[09:29] Zero.

[09:30] Zero, and there are wanted ads.

[09:33] This is nuts.

[09:34] So out of all these games, you can go get everything else I just mentioned.

[09:38] There's Godzilla Ellie's for sale.

[09:39] There's Elvira every edition.

[09:41] There's even a Batman SLE up for sale right now.

[09:43] A Super SLE Batman is up for sale.

[09:47] But yet John Wick Ellie, impossible to get.

[09:51] Crazy.

[09:52] Which means that game's gonna hold decently if that is the case.

[09:56] Now I think the reason why there's none available is they were all selling for around $8,000.

[10:03] So don't think like for a minute, anyone who bought an Ellie new is happy because you are

[10:07] not getting anywhere near $13,000 for this game.

[10:11] And the reason they all got gobbled up is I think that John Wick's were selling for

[10:15] even less than X-Men.

[10:17] So a lot of these things were sold in trading hands for almost a $5,000 loss.

[10:24] Alright so let's go on to James Bond.

[10:27] Ellie another $13,000 game.

[10:30] Right now James Bond Ellie $8,950.

[10:34] A beautiful $4,000 loss.

[10:37] The 60th anniversary game.

[10:40] Originally $20,000.

[10:41] You can go get it for $12,500.

[10:43] That is the single biggest loss of any stern in the history of stern machines.

[10:49] Even if they won't admit they originally priced it at $20,000.

[10:52] The biggest loss ever.

[10:54] Food Fighters Ellie sold out quickly back in the day.

[10:58] $13,000 new.

[10:59] Now $8,250.

[11:03] Godzilla Ellie baby went up a little bit.

[11:06] Still the greatest game maybe of all time.

[11:09] Is it number one?

[11:10] Is it number two?

[11:11] Is Jaws number one right now?

[11:13] Godzilla Ellie $12,500 firm for that game.

[11:19] Is it worth it?

[11:20] $12,500.

[11:21] I don't know.

[11:22] I never really loved the Ellie package of Godzilla.

[11:23] I actually think you'd be happier with maybe the black and white edition.

[11:28] But you know what?

[11:29] We gotta give credit where credit is due.

[11:31] And again it just goes to show you.

[11:33] When Stern had an Ellie at $10,500 and made a great game it went up in value.

[11:39] And when they stopped doing that everything's crashed in value.

[11:43] And these are crashes people.

[11:44] These are not normal depreciations.

[11:47] Every single game losing $3,000 to $4,000.

[11:50] And that's your collectible version of the product.

[11:54] Talk about then the collector part of the market is dead.

[11:57] Like it is dead but it is not.

[11:58] We are gonna see some games that are maybe the only ones worth collecting these days.

[12:02] So kiss Ellie I was curious.

[12:04] Cause now that the rumor is that Kiss is coming back.

[12:07] This is a game that with a topper people wanted like $16,000 and $19,000.

[12:14] Now there's a kiss Ellie for $13,500.

[12:17] See that's like right at the price the new Ellie is gonna be.

[12:22] If you have a kiss Ellie right now I hate to break it to you.

[12:26] But your game is now worth $8,000 or $9,000.

[12:30] Because if they make the new one nicer.

[12:32] Again I'm just going off of what happened to stuff like the walking dead.

[12:37] What happened to the old Metallica's.

[12:39] It's kind of over and unlike Metallica where they really redid the art so that the other

[12:46] one felt almost completely unique.

[12:49] I think they're gonna make this look exactly like the game you have just better in every

[12:54] single way.

[12:55] And also the kiss topper remember when this thing was going for like $5,000 it was unobtainium.

[13:01] Now there's one for sale for $2,500 and they know that most likely they're gonna make it

[13:08] again for all the new remasters of Kiss.

[13:13] And Jason Napp says he's pretty much 100% certain it's happening and I really do trust

[13:18] him when he gets this certain about something.

[13:20] Alright let's go to Jersey Jack.

[13:22] Has Jersey Jack done any better?

[13:24] Well you know yes and no.

[13:26] There's some games in the Jersey Jack portfolio that have held nicely and then there's some

[13:31] that have just been like way bigger losses than anything over at Stern other than James

[13:37] Bond 60th.

[13:38] So we gotta start with Harry Potter.

[13:40] Harry Potter CE I'm really really surprised that not many of these games have gone up

[13:46] for sale.

[13:47] In fact there's not a single Harry Potter CE for sale on Pinside for less than 15 which

[13:54] means people are just selling the game brand new.

[13:56] And what this means is it's a great game.

[14:00] People don't want to get rid of it and this is the new trend in Bimbal.

[14:03] Just buy a great game you love and then you never have to worry about the resale value

[14:08] of it.

[14:09] I'm never selling my Dodge Demon.

[14:11] I'm giving it to Killian later in life when he's like responsible enough to have a car

[14:16] with that much power but I'm not selling it.

[14:18] I don't care about the money.

[14:19] It's gone up, it's gone down, it's kinda held value.

[14:22] I don't really care.

[14:24] I don't look at the values of demons cause I'm keeping mine.

[14:27] It's got my name on it.

[14:29] It's got my name on the vent.

[14:30] It's got my name on everything.

[14:31] Okay.

[14:32] So Harry Potter CE but I did see on Facebook there was a dude selling one with low plays

[14:38] for 14.5 which if I were you I would just buy a new one.

[14:45] Saving 500 bucks is not enough.

[14:48] I'd much rather get a brand new, that new pin smell.

[14:53] It arriving at my house in a brand new box versus someone's used game where something

[14:59] could happen cause also remember people the warranties are non-transferable.

[15:04] So if you buy a new game for 15 and it arrives and it's damaged and something happened you're

[15:11] protected.

[15:13] If you buy a used game from someone for 14.5 you know I have a hard time believing you're

[15:18] gonna get the same help and protection as if you bought it new.

[15:23] So Harry Potter holding strong Elton John collector's edition.

[15:28] Another $15,000 CE game.

[15:31] How much do you think Elton John?

[15:33] Now look Elton John is a great shooter and so because of that it's held decently.

[15:39] It is at $12,500 is the cheapest you can get in Elton John 4.

[15:45] A loss of $2,500.

[15:47] Okay alright that's a pretty decent appreciation but also like $12,500 is not exactly like giving

[15:55] the game away.

[15:56] We're gonna see some other of these $15,000 JJPs that have absolutely plummeted.

[16:01] Alright Avatar's CE not as popular as Elton John.

[16:07] Not as good of a shooter but it is a somewhat interesting pin if you ask me it's still very

[16:13] beautiful.

[16:14] $15,000 new.

[16:16] The best price you can get in Avatar CE 4 today is $12,000 or best offer.

[16:22] Again on that OBO you're looking at probably 11-11.5 someone would take it.

[16:29] Because remember at 12 or OBO it's not moving.

[16:33] These games are still for sale.

[16:35] Alright now we get to the real difficult sort of pill to swallow if you bought one of these

[16:41] two games.

[16:43] Godfather's CE originally $15,000.

[16:50] Jack Winari's dream theme in a box.

[16:54] Right Godfather's CE today 9 grand firm gets you on a loss of $6,000.

[17:07] Is that the biggest loss in the history of JJP?

[17:09] No.

[17:10] There's another game that is a much bigger depreciation.

[17:15] Toy Story Collector's Edition.

[17:18] Instead of doing Andy's room we did Forky and Bonnie and that is why Toy Story CE in

[17:26] great condition $8,000 firm and you can get one.

[17:32] Now this is where it's nuts people like think about that for a minute.

[17:35] It's not a terrible game.

[17:37] It's still a beautiful Jersey Jack machine.

[17:40] It comes with the topper and everything.

[17:43] 8 grand.

[17:44] That's $7,000 off the MSRP of a Toy Story.

[17:49] One of the biggest IPs in the world.

[17:52] It's a Pat Lawler game.

[17:54] Are you telling me you're going to go buy a brand new Stern premium for like $9,500 when

[17:59] you can get a Toy Story CE for 8?

[18:04] Just goes to show you how badly they missed the mark on that game.

[18:09] And then I had to throw Guns N' Roses CE in here.

[18:12] The game I own.

[18:14] Now look there's only the cheapest you can get it for on Pinside right now is $12,000

[18:20] or best offer.

[18:23] I am not going to pretend.

[18:25] I have not seen Guns N' Roses CE sell for around $10,000 to $11,000.

[18:32] They have.

[18:34] So this is a game that is very polarizing.

[18:37] They made so many of them.

[18:39] And I think if you really want to move your CE quickly, you're around like 10 to 10,5

[18:45] and you'll get a buyer.

[18:46] But I don't think much more than that will make the game move.

[18:49] All right, let's go to Barrels of Fun.

[18:52] Labyrinth.

[18:53] How much was Labyrinth new?

[18:54] I think it was around the same price as Dune.

[18:56] I think it was like $11,600 around that price.

[18:59] Maybe I don't know.

[19:00] Maybe it was a little bit less.

[19:01] I'm not sure if they had a price increase.

[19:03] But you can go get a Labyrinth right now.

[19:05] There's a few of them for sale.

[19:07] The cheapest price is $8,300.

[19:10] Another game that really didn't catch on.

[19:13] And there is a decent amount of Labyrinth games for sale.

[19:16] What there is not for sale, there are no Dunes up for sale.

[19:21] So they did the last call and I went on Pinside and nothing.

[19:24] There's just no numbers.

[19:26] There is no secondhand Dunes for sale.

[19:29] There are also no secondhand spots being traded for Winchester's Mystery House.

[19:36] So we all know Winchester is going to go for a pretty penny the moment people start speculating

[19:42] in the market.

[19:44] I would say right now you could easily get $5,000 to $7,000 over for your Winchester spot.

[19:54] And I am very proud of this community where not a single person is doing that.

[19:59] I don't understand.

[20:00] I would take the money.

[20:02] I'm telling you right now, the reason I would take the money.

[20:05] I would take like $5,000 to $7,000.

[20:07] Sell your spot because a year from now when all these games are out and Barrels moves

[20:14] on to their next game, I don't think Winchester is going to go above, much above like $11,600.

[20:20] And so think about that.

[20:22] If you sell your spot for $7,000 over and then a year from now when the code is done,

[20:28] let's say someone even wants $12,000 for it.

[20:30] All right, so you just got a $12,000 Winchester for $5,000 because you just sold your spot

[20:39] and then you bought back in when the game was finished, when it was coded and you made

[20:43] such a smart move.

[20:44] Are you telling me nobody out there is thinking this way?

[20:48] What happened to you guys?

[20:49] Get some guts.

[20:50] Do some scalping.

[20:51] It's fun.

[20:52] All right, let's go to Spooky, baby.

[20:55] Spooky Pima.

[20:56] I kind of want to go from the bottom up.

[20:57] I want to go from the bottom up with Spooky.

[20:58] So Scooby Doo, I looked at.

[21:00] And maybe that's not the bottom up, but Scooby Doo right now, they made a lot of them.

[21:04] I don't think they made all of them.

[21:05] They said they were going to make 1,969 of them for 1,969.

[21:10] The year the show came out, way too many.

[21:12] They know that.

[21:13] They've changed their strategy wisely.

[21:15] You can go get a Scooby Doo collector's edition for $6,600.

[21:20] I mean, that's crazy.

[21:21] Price of a Stern Pro, it's a wide body.

[21:24] It's got a lot more in it than a Stern Pro.

[21:26] I think the code is pretty fun.

[21:28] It might be too easy for most people.

[21:30] And so, yeah, but that's not the worst, man.

[21:32] The worst is Ultraman.

[21:33] I got out of my Ultraman deposit.

[21:35] You can go get an Ultraman today for $4,900.

[21:39] I mean, even that, man.

[21:41] I've seen some Ultraman go for like high threes to get rid of it quickly.

[21:48] Halloween, the platform that shared itself with Ultraman, $5,800 or best offer on Halloween.

[21:56] Right?

[21:57] Good prices out here.

[21:58] It's a buyer's market.

[22:00] Now this is where it gets bad.

[22:02] Think about that for a minute.

[22:03] A $5,800 Halloween.

[22:06] Guess how much?

[22:07] The only Evil Dead for sale is right now on Pinside.

[22:11] There's only one available.

[22:13] $19,000.

[22:17] $19,000.

[22:18] That is almost $14,000 more than what you can go get a freaking Halloween for.

[22:26] Is it really worth $19?

[22:28] I mean, supply and demand.

[22:29] I don't think so.

[22:30] I wouldn't pay that for an Evil Dead.

[22:32] I don't know how you stomach paying that for an Evil Dead.

[22:35] I think Beetlejuice is going to end up being an even better game, but man.

[22:39] But man, talk about a company now.

[22:40] Both Spooky and Barrels are really the only two companies with these like crazy appreciating

[22:48] collectible items.

[22:50] They're the only two.

[22:51] Name me someone else out there that has anything headed north like this, nowhere.

[22:57] So speaking of that, if you want to go get a Beetlejuice spot, there actually is a spot

[23:02] for sale and it is $4,000 over the deposit.

[23:08] So if you give the guy $4,000, you then pay full price for the entire game.

[23:12] That $4,000 does not include the $2,500 deposit on the game.

[23:18] Okay, so yeah.

[23:20] Beetlejuice, as I said, Beetlejuice is going to be another game much like Winchester, much

[23:25] like Evil Dead.

[23:26] These games are not going to come up very often.

[23:29] They're going to be bolted to so many people's collections and if you ever get a chance to

[23:34] get one, they're going to be very expensive.

[23:37] So good job on Spooky.

[23:39] Good job, Barrels boys.

[23:41] You now have done what you want to do.

[23:43] You've created a lot more demand than supply.

[23:47] That's not the case over at Stern.

[23:49] And like I've been saying with these boutiques, the reason why the value holds so well is

[23:55] there's never going to be another run of any of them.

[23:57] And that is the number one reason Stern Pinball has lost all the confidence and all the trust

[24:06] between the collectors and Stern.

[24:09] They just kept remaking stuff and they're doing it again.

[24:14] Because imagine if Spooky did another run of Beetlejuice during an anniversary year

[24:19] or another Evil Dead or another Rick and Morty.

[24:22] They absolutely then send everybody packing and they will never buy from you again.

[24:27] I still don't think Stern understands that very simple concept.

[24:31] Alright, let's keep going baby CGC.

[24:34] Attack from Mars.

[24:35] You don't see these games come up very often and there's not many for sale.

[24:39] If you want to attack from Mars LE, the cheapest one is $14,550.

[24:45] $14,550.

[24:47] You know I think Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness are the two most popular CGC remakes.

[24:53] Monster Bash LE is $11,500.

[24:57] That's a little bit over what it was brand new.

[25:00] Remember CGC games were around $10,000 so again they all went up a little bit but one

[25:05] that has not is Cactus Canyon.

[25:09] The Cactus Canyon LEs, I think they botched that whole thing.

[25:13] The wait to get one, the upgrade kit, the wait for the code, all of it made people sort

[25:19] of not really love the Cactus Canyon return.

[25:23] It's also the worst out of all their games by far.

[25:27] Even though it has a lot of toys in it, it's not considered the best gameplay experience.

[25:31] So a Cactus Canyon LE, $8,475 or best offer which means I bet you could sneak one out

[25:39] for like $7,900.

[25:43] So they had the LE which is $11,000.

[25:46] They've got the Royal Edition, the cheapest you can get it for is $15,000 or best offer

[25:52] and then they've got the new Merlin Edition which the cheapest you can get it for is $11,000

[25:58] OBO.

[25:59] Remember again around $10,000 new, they keep remaking Medieval Madnesses to the point now

[26:05] where I don't think any of them are really worth more than around $10,000 or $11,000.

[26:11] I would never spend $15,000 on a Royal Edition and there's just something off with CGC lately.

[26:18] I think they've lost a lot of the goodwill with the community and I think because of

[26:23] that people just don't care as much anymore about these CGC games.

[26:28] Dutch Pinball, the Big Lebowski, remember the Big Lebowski, the only game they've made

[26:35] next to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[26:38] So the Big Lebowski, I want to say this game was like $13,500 when they remade it and they

[26:44] brought it back, wasn't it around that like $13,000?

[26:48] You can now go get a Mint Condition Lebowski for $10,500.

[26:53] I mean, hasn't held value, not a huge loss but you know, you see the way the market's

[27:00] going.

[27:01] The next stop for the Big Lebowski especially if they get to Back to the Future is definitely

[27:07] going to be in the $9,000 to $8,500 range.

[27:11] I went to see if there were any Alice machines for sale and there are not but I did see some

[27:18] sell for like around $11,500 I think, new in box so it's not going up in value.

[27:27] It's not crashing in value but I don't think Alice will ever go up and I think again, once

[27:34] things start to slide, they're going to keep sliding.

[27:38] The more time goes on, the more these games become yesterday's news especially if these

[27:44] games are not great, right?

[27:47] That's really what it comes down to.

[27:49] If Alice was amazing and the code was phenomenal and the mechs were incredible and the gameplay

[27:55] experience was talked about with accolades and praise, it'd be a different story but

[28:01] it's kind of the opposite.

[28:03] It's a beautiful game, they made J-pop's vision work but next to modern games, it's

[28:10] not going to be a rewarding gameplay experience for most of you out there and because of that,

[28:17] the price will reflect that and people just don't care.

[28:21] They really don't care anymore to walk in and see one of these J-pop brain fart games

[28:26] in your game room does not telegraph anything anymore.

[28:31] People just don't care.

[28:32] Alright, so speaking about not caring, P3 Multimorphic, let's see, Princess Bride at

[28:37] 9500 or best offer, Portal at 10,620 which is basically like a new and box game that's

[28:46] $1,000 off.

[28:47] It's really hard with Multimorphic P3 because they've got all of the kits and one of the

[28:55] biggest financial losses you'll ever take is if you buy one of these things and all

[29:00] the kits and then try to go sell it.

[29:02] You will literally lose at least 10 Gs if you bought all the kits.

[29:09] Nobody wants all of that.

[29:11] It's just such a weird strategy.

[29:14] He's never going to change it.

[29:15] I'm not even going to discuss it anymore.

[29:18] Padredy Funhouse Remake, 7200 or best offer.

[29:23] Nobody wants that game.

[29:24] Dragon Ball Brothers Alien, 7500, Turner Ninja Eclipse which was once going, I think people

[29:31] were trying to fluff this thing up to around 10 Gs once, 7200 or best offer and the new

[29:38] one Merlin's Arcade at 8500.

[29:40] Alright, so look, the key takeaway is this people, all of these games, all of these games

[29:46] now except for just like two or three are losing money and some of them are just normal

[29:52] depreciation which is fine.

[29:54] I don't think anybody has a problem sort of like buying an Elton John, enjoying it for

[29:59] like two, three years and you go to sell it and you lose like two grand, 2500.

[30:05] That seems a little normal.

[30:06] I mean, you don't love that but whatever, it is what it is.

[30:09] It's the stern machines that are the most concerning for me because they're losing

[30:12] so much instantly and that instant depreciation, I don't know how they like convince people

[30:19] to keep buying and you know that their customer is not even you and me.

[30:22] It's the distros.

[30:23] How are they going to keep convincing these distros to put in orders to get their allocations

[30:28] when no one wants them?

[30:30] Like just nobody wants them at these prices and you know a lot of dealers and distros

[30:35] are doing the backdoor deals.

[30:36] They're taking the money on the table, right?

[30:38] Their margin might be like 2500 on the game or a little bit more than that and they're

[30:43] willing to cut that margin in half just to get the game out the door because now they

[30:48] got to go sell all those premiums and pros they also committed to.

[30:53] And so I love seeing the way the market is dictating this hobby when it comes to buying.

[31:01] Now you know me.

[31:02] You know me.

[31:03] I think it's still a wait and see market.

[31:07] It will always be a wait and see market now forever.

[31:10] I like what Jersey Jack is doing where their new emphasis is on just making the greatest

[31:15] games they can make and they're not going to do any FOMO shenanigans and they're just

[31:21] going to like if you want the nicest version of Sonic will make it for you.

[31:25] I like that because you pair that with spooky and barrels, two companies making very limited

[31:32] runs of games and never making those games again.

[31:36] That's going to scratch the itch of the collector.

[31:39] And then I look over at Stern and I'm like what's the strategy?

[31:42] What really is the strategy here when your ellies instantly are worth the price of the

[31:46] premium, which means your premiums are not worth anywhere near $10,000.

[31:51] And then you just look at it like well maybe I'll just play Stern pros on location and

[31:54] have fun because the code is exactly the same.

[31:57] That's what I love about this hobby is you had a company like Stern that was dominating

[32:02] with a strategy that was working so well and then they priced themselves out of their own

[32:08] strategy and now it doesn't work at all in my honest opinion.

[32:12] And I do think that this hobby is going to start to see the enthusiasm and the momentum

[32:19] happening around JJP more and the boutique space more.

[32:24] And now that all these companies are making phenomenal products, I mean you put these

[32:28] games next to the Stern machines and they make the Stern machines look so cheap.

[32:32] And I know there's people out there that are like, Canada, you become anti-Stern.

[32:35] I haven't.

[32:36] I haven't.

[32:37] I'm just observing what a Stern Star Wars looks like for $13,000 next to a Beto juice

[32:44] for $10,000 next to a Dune for $11,600.

[32:48] It doesn't look nearly as good.

[32:50] It doesn't look like they put as much effort in.

[32:53] It doesn't look like the value is there.

[32:55] And if it was just me saying it, I wouldn't be able to do a show like this that just showed

[33:00] you if you bought every Stern LE over the last like three to four years.

[33:05] On average, you're losing $4,000 a game.

[33:09] A game.

[33:10] And so if you buy three Stern LEs a year from now, you just lost $12,000 on just three games.

[33:18] This has never happened before in the history of pinball buying.

[33:21] And for those people that say it's normal, it's like a car.

[33:24] No, you need a car to get from A to B. Do you need all these new machines?

[33:29] And also like I just proved to each and every one of you, if you just wait, if you just

[33:33] wait it, you could march in now and go get all of these games and save that $12,000.

[33:41] That's the smart move.

[33:42] You know, I've noticed the reason why a lot of the content creators in Canada, the ones

[33:45] we used to have issues with, we all get along now because they all see it.

[33:49] They all see it.

[33:50] The drum I was beating, they've all felt it now.

[33:53] They got bit by the pinball bug.

[33:55] They came in, they were excited, they were enthusiastic, they were buying every LE.

[33:59] And then they realized, wait, what just happened?

[34:01] How did I just lose all this money?

[34:04] This little guy over there in Connecticut, Canada saying, wait and see, and you will

[34:08] be able to march in and get everything.

[34:10] And I think that's still the case.

[34:11] I'm really excited to see what happens in pinball this year.

[34:15] I don't think Pokemon is going to be one of these games that skyrockets in value.

[34:19] I just don't think there's the overlap, enough overlap between the Pokemon fans and the pinball

[34:25] buying demographic.

[34:27] I just don't see it.

[34:28] And I don't think Gomez is going to design a Pokemon game that's going to blow us away.

[34:35] We shall see in just a week or so.

[34:38] Everybody love you.

[34:39] Happy Monday, Canada Out.
