[00:00] Excuse me, you look like you love me, you look like you want me, and want you to come on home.

[00:12] Soda, Soda, Soda, Soda, Soda, Soda, Soda.

[00:16] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast. I am in such a good mood.

[00:22] Do you ever have that day after feeling, you know, the day after a great concert or a vacation,

[00:28] or you fall in love for the first time? No, I'm not saying I'm falling in love for the first time,

[00:32] but what I'm saying is this, in the 10 years I've done this pinball podcast,

[00:37] I have never really been invited to a pinball company to check out what went into making their brand new game.

[00:44] And I really, really, really had an amazing time in Chicago, not just visiting Jersey Jack Pinball,

[00:52] not just hanging out with pinball personalities, because what yesterday did in just a small sliver of time,

[01:02] it reminded me why we all love this hobby. And you know the answer, it's the people, right?

[01:07] It is the reason why we love pinball. You get together with some cool people, you have a good time,

[01:13] and you play a toy, and you enjoy life in the short amount of time we have.

[01:17] And what's interesting about going there and seeing the game, and seeing the people,

[01:22] and seeing the response, and seeing the workers, seeing the factory, seeing everything,

[01:27] is then you go and you read on pinside all these opinions about something people have never seen,

[01:32] they've never played. And it really did remind me that all of us fall victim to this,

[01:38] where we get overly negative, overly angry, and overly triggered around pinball,

[01:44] and maybe if we all just took a trip and hung out with our pinball friends more,

[01:50] and got together and had some whiskeys and beers, and put a few games on these machines,

[01:55] we wouldn't be arguing about them the way we do on the internet. And I know, and I lead a lot of

[02:00] this discussion on a weekly basis, right? These games are expensive, we want to look at them with

[02:05] discerning eyes, and I am going to look at not just Avatar with discerning eyes, I'm also going to

[02:11] give you a little bit of feedback on X-Men because I was able to sneak over to Stern Pinball for a

[02:16] little bit, there was a two hour gap in the day with JJP, and they're literally right down the

[02:21] street. And I will say this, they're totally different companies. I've been thinking a lot

[02:25] about how I want to do this show, because there are some people out there, they're like, you're

[02:29] gonna go, and you're gonna become a shill for Jersey Jack Pinball. That's not what you're gonna

[02:34] hear on this show. And look, it's not lost on me that I read pinside, and a few things have happened

[02:39] over the last few days. When X-Men got revealed, everybody was saying it was great, and then they

[02:46] did a stream which didn't show the game in the best possible light, and then everybody turned on X-Men,

[02:53] got a beautiful 18 minute video about the making of Avatar, which was really well done by Jersey

[03:00] Jack Pinball, and then all of the vibes went from being pro X-Men to sort of like, oh, screw X-Men,

[03:08] Avatar is amazing because of the sizzle video. And I'm just here to tell you, these are two games

[03:15] where you really need to jump on both of them. You need to play them and make up your mind. I

[03:21] don't think you're really gonna have to order either one before Pinball Expo if you really want to get

[03:27] like a CE or an LE. If there's any game you have to order sooner than later, it would be the LE

[03:33] of X-Men because they're making it now. They're not gonna make the Jersey Jack Avatar CE until

[03:39] November, but both games are different. And I'm gonna explain my feelings on both of them. Obviously,

[03:45] I spent a lot more time on Avatar, but before I do that, I want to talk about how I wanted to

[03:51] structure this show. I wanted to talk about some of these things before I go into the games themselves.

[03:57] And I broke it down. I don't know why I did this, but I broke it down with words that all start with

[04:02] the letter P. And one of them is not podcasting. I want to talk about the people. I want to talk

[04:08] about the product. I want to talk about the passion. I want to talk about the pride these people have.

[04:14] I want to talk about the pathway of these companies. I want to talk about play. How do these games

[04:19] play? Ultimately, that's a really important thing. And then also talk about the price because you

[04:24] can't avoid it. And you have to look at all these things. Are we getting what these companies are

[04:30] charging us for these machines? So when we start with the people, and I'm going to weave these things

[04:34] into everything as I talk about today. So I get to Jersey Jack Pimbal. Jason Napp is there. Vic is

[04:41] there. Ken Cromwell is there. I walk into the room. There's Scott from Loser Kid. We all shook hands

[04:47] and had a good time except for one person. And look, that's on them. You know, I had a great time.

[04:52] I wasn't going to let anybody spoil the mood. And so we all had a really, really amazing walkthrough

[04:58] of the Jersey Jack facility by Eric Minier. Really great guy. Eric is awesome. He gave a great tour

[05:05] and Tom Capara, who came from Stern Pimbal and is now over at Jersey Jack Pimbal, did an absolutely

[05:11] phenomenal job walking us through not just the new game, what goes into making the new game,

[05:18] all the different ways they have to approach a brand new product and bring it to market. You

[05:23] know, it's really easy, right? At the end of the journey for us to just critique the final product,

[05:29] and we still should. But when you do get to see behind the curtain and what goes into making these

[05:36] games, some of the obstacles they might have had with Light Storm production, the production company

[05:41] for Avatar, I met mechanical engineers, we met Keith, the coder, we met a really large portion of the

[05:48] Jersey Jack design team that has worked on Avatar. And so that was really awesome to sort of hear in

[05:56] their voices, their enthusiasm and their pride and their passion for making this game. I will say

[06:02] this, nobody is making Pimbal between Stern and Jersey Jack. When you go into these companies,

[06:08] nobody's going into this who's not really enthusiastic about what they're doing. And I think, again,

[06:15] it's really easy for the internet to just tear everything down and say everything sucks. And

[06:21] these companies are destroying Pimbal and they're ripping us off. I get it, I get it, I hear it all.

[06:26] Also heard and he was in town from Brett Abbess was there, really awesome guy, I talked to Brett

[06:32] for a while, you know, and his vision for the company and his pathway forward for Jersey Jack

[06:37] Pimbal. And what was exciting about talking to Brett, this is a company that is full steam ahead.

[06:42] They've got the capital, we know they got the capital. It's weird for me to talk to a guy like

[06:46] Brett, because I'm like, this dude could just like pay off my house and he wouldn't even feel it

[06:50] tomorrow. It's like, but he's such an awesome guy. And we talked about the pathway forward and the

[06:54] vision for Jersey Jack Pimbal. And I was very honest with Brett, I was very honest with Brett,

[07:00] I mean, I told him like, look, man, you got to get the CEs out first, they're working on that. I don't

[07:04] know why that is hard work. I don't get it. You know, if you're going to make one game first,

[07:11] you got to make the CEs first, more to come on that with Avatar, why I think the CEs is really

[07:17] the only version to get. And we had a good conversation, Ken Cromwell, amazing guy over there at Jersey

[07:23] Jack, their marketing guy, and Ken tried something new with this, you know, we talked about marketing,

[07:28] we talked about the launch of this game, we talked about whether or not teasers worked,

[07:32] are we going out too early, should we have waited a little bit, but I really, really,

[07:36] really do give Ken a lot of credit for trying something new. And that is how marketing should

[07:41] be. You got to keep trying some different stuff until you get it right. And the one thing they

[07:45] really nailed was that 18 minute sizzle video. It was great. It was a great way to see the product

[07:51] for the first time. Now that being said, it is still a Pimbal machine, and you can't just go off

[07:57] of a sizzle video. And I know people are going to watch it, and it's meant to make you want to buy

[08:02] a game. I mean, remember, this is marketing, they want to sell you a game. Everything they're doing

[08:08] is to create a little bit of FOMO and a little bit of urgency and get you to order one. And I get it,

[08:13] that's the job of marketing. So yes, I do think when Jersey Jack talks a little bit about their

[08:18] product, you got to take some of it with a grain of salt because they do in a very like animated,

[08:24] hyperbolic way, they're selling the sizzle of what they created. It's always funny to me when

[08:28] Pimbal companies talk because they could say stuff like, we couldn't get anything more into this

[08:33] game, right? I mean, I've heard people say this, there's nothing more that could go into this game.

[08:36] And we know that's not true, but it sounds good. It's like if I told Brenda, I couldn't love you

[08:43] any more than I do. I probably could. I probably could. It just sounds really good to make a very

[08:49] dramatic proclamation. I saw in their press release, when they talk about the collector's edition,

[08:54] it is labeled as the highly sought after collector's edition. It's like, really guys,

[08:59] you can get one. So the people are there, they're great. We do the factory tour with Eric. The

[09:04] avatars are there. We didn't jump on them right away. We did about an hour factory tour, then they

[09:09] brought out lunch. They asked us if we had any questions. And then we played the game. And they

[09:14] had four avatars set up. They were all using Ellie playfields. Two of them were inside CE

[09:22] cabinets. And I'm just going to say this, yes, it is beautiful. When you walk up to this game,

[09:28] it is stunning. And Jersey Jack has a polish and a presentation to their games that are

[09:36] unrivaled by anybody else in Pimble. There is just nothing like walking up to a JJP game for the

[09:42] first time. It is absolutely stunning. The CE armor, they do this thing where they dip it in

[09:49] two different color blues to simulate the Navi skin color. It is stunning in person. I have never

[09:56] seen any armor like this. And when they talk about how it's made, this is not something that anybody

[10:02] could go do. You're not going to be able to have like the mod community recreate what you're going

[10:08] to get with that CE armor. I'm going to get to the game, but I just want to talk about walking

[10:12] up to the machine for the first time. The topper is not repurposed screens from Toy Story 4.

[10:19] It is a hologram topper. And it is absolutely stunning. It is huge. I'm looking at my G&R

[10:26] topper right now. It is a good like four inches taller than the G&R topper. It's encased in this

[10:32] box. And it's absolutely stunning. And it actually communicates what's going on in the game. It was

[10:38] cool. Like people were tilting the machine. And the topper would say tilt on it and shake. And what

[10:44] you're seeing is like this heads up display that the characters see in the movie. And it's exactly

[10:51] from those heads up displays from the movie. And then you get to the game. We saw the game on the

[10:56] line. Games are being made. We saw all the sub assemblies. We saw all the parts. And then you walk

[11:03] up to the game. And there's Avatar. And it's interesting walking up to a Pimba machine for

[11:08] the first time. We've seen photos of it. We've seen the video. And when you're standing over Avatar,

[11:13] it is a really pretty machine. It really is. Like there's no denying the fact. I think the artwork

[11:19] is perfect for it. I didn't have any complaints about the way the game looks aesthetically.

[11:24] Those two lower playfields, you know, when you're standing over it, that first one that's closest

[11:29] to the major flippers at the bottom of the game is a really big window. And then there's one above it.

[11:34] And then you've got most of the action in the game. Like most of what your eye is going to be

[11:38] drawn to are the wire forms and the ramps. And a lot of that is happening sort of further back

[11:45] in the game. I think a lot of the action in Avatar, when you play it, is going to be happening at the

[11:52] top of the game. I forgot to mention the CE Translight is absolutely stunning. Here's the thing.

[11:59] I'm going to talk about gameplay. I'm going to talk about the UV effect. I'm going to talk about a

[12:03] lot in this game. We did not get to see the CE playfield, which by the way, ladies and gentlemen,

[12:11] is not being made by Mirko. It is being made by Bader. And Bader is who makes the best playfields

[12:18] in the world. They make spooky pinballs, playfields. And that is the greatest news, maybe in the history

[12:25] of Jersey Jack pinball, that their top of the line game is going to get a top of the line

[12:30] playfield. Just on that alone, I don't know how you buy anything other than the CE.

[12:38] Making the CE even better is the fact that they are using three different types of UV ink on the

[12:46] CE playfield. And Tom showed us what that looks like. In the LE, you're just going to get blue

[12:52] UV ink. So that means that only the color blue is really going to light up when the UV hits that

[12:59] game. In the CE, you're going to get blue, green, and red. And trust me, it is insanely cooler

[13:08] when all three are lit up. And here's the thing. And it's a little strange. I'm going to talk about

[13:12] why, again, I think the CE is the only way to go in this game. Because the lighting effects in

[13:18] Avatar is the most, I think, impressive wow thing happening in the game. I don't think that's a

[13:24] negative, but if you're going to want the most impressive wow, like as that solar eclipse is

[13:30] happening, you want that bioluminescent world of Pandora to come to life, you're going to want the

[13:35] full effect. And I am a little bit surprised that they took the full effect out of the LE of the

[13:42] game because man, how can you spend 12 grand and know that you're not getting the full effect?

[13:50] So there's that. The other thing is this, there are no additional, I've seen this on

[13:55] Pinsight and people are wrong. There's no additional UV lighting in the CE over the LE. So you are

[14:04] going to get the same amount of UV hitting that game, but you're not going to get the same amount

[14:09] of colors that are going to pop. All right, so then you get to the game. And this is Mark Siden's

[14:15] first game. And I want to stop before I get to the game. I want to talk about Mark for a minute.

[14:21] Mark is one of the nicest and coolest and friendly people I have met in Pimbal. He is

[14:28] impossible not to like the moment you start talking to him, the moment he starts talking about his

[14:36] game. And if you haven't met Mark, I can't wait till you meet him because he is a great ambassador

[14:42] for Pimbal. And when you meet the designer and when you get in front of them and you're hearing

[14:48] their passion, it's impossible when that happens to then separate the people who make this game

[14:56] from the game itself. And when you then start to play it, you actually play the game differently

[15:03] because you're playing it understanding why they made the game the way they made it. And I think

[15:10] that's a really important thing. And I think every Pimbal company should take a note on this.

[15:16] This helps people connect more with your product. If you just walk up to the game, this is a little

[15:22] bit of a mistake with X-Men, right? If you just walk up to the game and you just start playing it

[15:27] and you're not really letting us in on why the game is this way, like why is this over here?

[15:34] Why is that over there? How did I engineer this sort of ramp that can also flip up and turn into

[15:41] the dive so you go under the ocean? It can also propel you up the ramp into a wire form? Why is

[15:47] the tree over here? Why isn't there a tree sculpt because Lightstorm, the production company,

[15:52] didn't want to approve a sculpt for that area? We maybe could have done it. Hey, the mod community

[15:57] is probably going to make that. We know that. You hear about how we watched the movie and how he

[16:02] got inspired by it and why he put this into it and that into it. And then you can never unlearn

[16:08] that. And you can never erase that connection you have between the designer, his intentions,

[16:14] and the game itself. Now, look, all that being said, like let's be honest people, you know,

[16:18] Canada is still going to be Canada. I mean, all that being said, does it work out? Does the game

[16:24] deliver on what they're excited about? That's my main struggle over the last 24 hours is I've

[16:30] heard a lot. I've heard a lot of hyperbole from a lot of people. I talked to a lot of people that

[16:35] worked on the game and you know, Brett's enthusiasm, Ken's enthusiasm, Jack came on camera. Everyone's

[16:42] very enthusiastic telling me that they've created, you know, in their minds, a masterpiece, a modern

[16:49] marvel in pinball that has stuff in it that's never been done before in pinball. And all of that

[16:54] hyperbole is subjective. And that's the thing about pinball. And that is why I want to be fair

[17:00] I want to tell you what I like about the game. I want to tell you what I like about how it shoots.

[17:04] I want to tell you what I like about the moments that really impressed me. I want to talk about a

[17:08] few things that I think Jersey Jack needs to continue to work on. And there's some things now

[17:12] that I've seen over the past few games that I think they need to address. Let me start with what I

[17:18] think is going to be the most important thing you need to think about whether or not you want to

[17:24] own this game. And that is the theme. Because there's just no way around it. I mean, they made

[17:31] avatar based on the first two movies. And this is avatar. And so are you a fan of avatar? And that

[17:39] is something you really need to think about because there's moments in this game and I was

[17:44] thinking about it or like if it was another movie where a major battle is happening like the battle

[17:49] for Helms deep. When you hear that it instantly like teleports you to like that moment in Lord

[17:57] of the Rings. The horse and the rider ride out with me for Rohan. You know all that stuff. All

[18:02] those moments in the battle for Helms deep that you remember. And then when you hear the battle

[18:08] of Awaa Atlu you know you're like huh. And that's it. And look just to be fair I mean look they put

[18:16] all of the major moments of the first two films into this game. But that's the thing. It's like the

[18:22] avatar stuff. You need to ask yourself do I want to have avatar because this is such a polarizing

[18:30] theme for a lot of people. I think it's perfect for families who love the films. I mean this is

[18:36] definitely a theme that I think a lot of people who are not on pin side are not cranky men drinking

[18:42] whiskey are going to keep an open mind about because there's millions and millions and millions of

[18:46] people who love the world of Pandora. Who love the movies. Who love the rides. Who love the

[18:51] attractions. So this game is a Pandora attraction. And this is why I do think you need to jump on

[18:59] this game and see if going through the world of Pandora sort of gets you going emotionally and

[19:05] gets you excited. I think everybody needs to start there with avatar. It's not a home run theme for a

[19:11] lot of people that I've been talking to in the world of Pimbo. All right so then you get over the

[19:16] game and how does the game play. Right because that's the other thing people are always like well

[19:21] I didn't love Iron Maiden music but I played Iron Maiden as a game and that's what won me over.

[19:27] You know I played this game a lot. I played this game for at least I want to say 40 minutes.

[19:33] Lots of games. I put up the grand champion score of 200 million because I was the first one on that

[19:40] game. I watched Jack Danger later in the night at Interium. I think he put up like 1.4 billion.

[19:48] He just destroyed the game. And you know talking to Jack at Interium who's a really good player

[19:55] he loves Mark's game. You know he's like I love this game. So I just wanted to report that too.

[20:01] There's a lot of mutual love and mutual respect between these companies between the designers

[20:09] and even though they might have different strategies and even though they might have

[20:13] different philosophies on how to make Pimbo and they do people and they are radically different.

[20:19] Variety is the spice of life but when you remove all the division that happens on the internet

[20:24] and on pin side Mark Sidon and Jack Danger are two amazing men and if you're hanging out with them

[20:32] and you're having some drinks and you're playing Pimbo with them and they're standing over their

[20:38] own creations I don't think you could have a better night in Pimbo than I had last night.

[20:43] And I mean that like I'll remember that for a really long time and I think it's important that we

[20:48] all realize we need to get out more hang out with our friends. If you hit up Jersey Jack and say you

[20:53] want to tour they'll give you one. If you hit up Stern say you want to go see every they'll give you

[20:57] one like you can get the access to these companies that we had yesterday. Well maybe not as much as

[21:03] Canada because I'll go into that later. All right so how does the game shoot. The game is pretty

[21:08] wide open. It's pretty wide open and I want to talk about the second thing that I've heard from

[21:12] everybody and I want to confirm for everybody when we saw the game on the line. The game has a lot

[21:18] in it. Like there's a lot more in this game than is in Elton John. Just from underneath the play

[21:25] field Mark has put a lot of stuff in this game but then when you look at the other side right when

[21:31] you're standing over the game and you ask where is the major toy in avatar. I'm going to tell you

[21:39] right now it does not have a major toy in the game. And what I mean by major toy in the traditional

[21:48] sense of pinball is a mechanical thing that the ball interacts with that is not a ramp. It's not

[21:57] a diverter. It's not something that flips up. A toy is a toy. The genie that you bash is a toy in

[22:04] Toten. That's a toy. The T-Rex that eats the ball is a toy. The building that goes up and down in

[22:12] Godzilla is a toy. Heck even the boat that you bash with the captive ball where you then hit the

[22:17] shark Brucey in Jaws is a toy to me. Avatar doesn't have that. Even the things that you do semi-bash

[22:25] you're not really bashing. You don't bash the marine robot in the game. You hit the sling underneath

[22:31] them. You don't bash the crab in the lower play field. You hit the target underneath them. That is

[22:37] an area at Jersey Jack pinball where I do think they need to work on that. I do think in any game

[22:44] you make I don't care what game it is. I don't care what the theme is. There needs to be a central

[22:49] toy that everyone can walk up to and really get excited about. When you go see X-Men and I'm going

[22:57] to talk a little bit about it later. The Sentinel toy is insane. It is awesome and it is everything

[23:04] we love about pinball. Avatar doesn't have that kind of thing in it and that will lead to a lot of

[23:11] people debating why isn't something like that in the game if these games are so much money. And when

[23:17] we were at Interium I couldn't help but look down the row of Jersey Jack games and when you look at

[23:25] dialed in was there. It was like man it was glaringly obvious that dialed in is loaded with toys.

[23:34] Loaded. There's so much in dialed in where you interact with the ball. You hit stuff. You bash

[23:40] stuff. The big female mechanic comes down with the wrench as a diverter. All those are toys. Even the

[23:46] theater with the holographic display. All that's a toy. A scoop is not a toy but that other stuff.

[23:52] Man it's toys. Slimer in Ghostbusters. The crane in Batman. And I do think that almost every single

[23:59] pinball machine is just more fun when you have at least one amazing toy that is super fun to hit

[24:07] time and time again. So I think you know as I look at Avatar and I think about the game

[24:11] and I think about the world of Pandora I do think there was a missed opportunity to have a toy in

[24:16] there. Whether it was like a bow and arrow that fires. We saw one in Walking Dead. The Banshee

[24:22] right flying around like you had a flying monkey and Wizard of Oz grab the ball and bring it up to

[24:28] the upper play field. Was there an opportunity to have a Banshee magnetize and carry the ball up to

[24:34] the Hallelujah Mountains. I mean it was right there right. You know so I think that is something

[24:39] that people will point out. They will not be wrong when they say that. And I do think you know as

[24:46] Mark makes another game at JJP and JJP sort of finds its way again because remember they got

[24:52] really empty with some of their games recently. I think they need to continue to put more in.

[24:57] And especially at these prices the customers and the fans of pinball are going to demand it. And

[25:04] if Stern is doing what they're doing with X-Men and it's loaded with toys and magnets and all this

[25:08] fun stuff. You know you're going to have a hard time justifying the prices at Jersey Jack if your

[25:15] games aren't equally loaded. And here's the thing. You can't hide from the word loaded. When you say

[25:22] your game is loaded people are either going to believe you or they're not. And so I would not

[25:28] say Avatar is loaded. I wouldn't. In fact it's just not loaded. You might have taken up a lot of real

[25:34] estate with those lower playfields but it is definitely not loaded. Now look much like Guns

[25:40] and Roses though. And I will say this. I don't even think GnR has many toys if any. The main thing

[25:45] happening in Avatar is the atmosphere. And it's one of these games again where the entire machine

[25:51] itself is designed to sort of create the vibe of Pandora and transform the pinball machine into

[25:59] this like unique experience unlike anything else. And a lot of that has to do with the lighting.

[26:06] Before I talk about the lighting I want to get to the shots. A lot of the shots are more up the

[26:11] middle. There's a really challenging shot. It's a fun shot but it's hard. It's the upper right ramp.

[26:17] It is the eclipse spinner shot. You need to hit that shot to cash out your eclipse jackpot. It is

[26:25] not easy. And I know Mark was even wondering did I make it too hard. And I don't think he did. I

[26:31] think it is perfect the way it is because you want that risk reward moment to happen. And what's

[26:37] really cool about this game is like when the eclipse starts to happen and when the lighting

[26:42] switches over it is really really cool. And as you're hitting the shots and you're building up your

[26:48] jackpot there's this great sense of urgency as the eclipse starts to fade away and you realize

[26:56] like you got to hit that spinner jackpot and cash it out before the game goes back to full daylight.

[27:04] It is awesome. Like I really love that. Now I have a gripe. You wouldn't be canada without a gripe.

[27:11] Jersey jack. You invited us to play avatar for the first time ever. 15 or so media personalities

[27:18] the major real feature of this game and you know it. It's all about that transformation right the

[27:24] twilight the daylight to twilight the eclipse the UV that is the main thing in the game. You don't

[27:34] show the game to us in a pitch black room where we can get the full effect of the lighting in the

[27:41] game. I was like what how did they miss that opportunity. I told it to Ken. I told him at

[27:47] Expo I think they're going to do this. They need to pipe and drape. That's all you need. Even if you

[27:52] couldn't find a pitch black room just pipe and drape it. So we're walking into a completely dark

[27:59] environment to experience the game. They didn't do it. It was a missed opportunity because I wish I

[28:05] could tell you how bright the UV works in the game. Part of me is like is Carrie Hardy right.

[28:11] Are they manipulating it in the video. Maybe because even when Tom showed us the CE he was

[28:18] using a handheld black light to show us how much it lit up. But I don't know. I can tell you the

[28:26] UV in the game is not going to be as strong as holding a handheld black light at the play field.

[28:32] So at Expo I hope they display the game that way. But otherwise like the game was fun to shoot. Like

[28:38] I had a good time shooting the game. I think there's a lot of really interesting shots off

[28:43] those upper flippers that send the ball into unique directions. I was still learning the

[28:49] shots when it comes to flow. There were some times and this is what happens when you don't have like

[28:54] a major toy to keep hitting or bashing. There were some times where you know you're not really

[28:59] quite sure what you should be shooting at. I was still learning the rulesets when I was playing

[29:03] the game. What else do I want to talk about. I want to talk about the animations. They're stunning.

[29:08] They got so many assets from the production company. They're absolutely amazing. It might be

[29:13] Jersey Jack's prettiest work as far as animations go in a game. The music is great. They nailed it.

[29:20] And you got to remember Avatar is a tricky one music wise for pinball because you can have like

[29:25] very slow almost to like an aura happening with the music that really makes that bi-illuminescent

[29:33] vibe come to life. You got to go from that to like more energetic music when you get to some of

[29:38] the multi-balls in the game. Good news is you're not going to be bombarded with multi-balls the

[29:43] way you are in some other Keeper games. This is not a one switch multi-ball game. So you're going

[29:49] to have to work to start your multi-balls which is good. The flippers feel great. Flippers feel

[29:55] absolutely fine. I didn't feel any flipper fade. It wasn't hard getting the ball up any of those

[30:00] ramps. The lower playfields people are going to talk about them. They're going to wonder whether it

[30:05] was worth it. You know lower playfields are very polarizing in pinball. I didn't love them. I didn't

[30:11] hate them. I actually found the upper lower playfield to be more satisfying which is the smaller

[30:17] window. I think the flipper buttons are actually activating. I think it's a pop bumper down there.

[30:22] When you press the button it's activating it and knocking the ball into the targets. I actually

[30:26] found that one to be more rewarding than the one below it which is a mini playfield down there

[30:31] where there's two flippers. It's not using a full-size pinball down there. It is a smaller

[30:37] pinball and I never really loved those kinds of lower playfields because the kinetic satisfaction

[30:43] in shooting one of those non-steel balls is never that rewarding. It's not bad. It's just not like

[30:49] oh I can't wait to get back down there. I think most lower playfields are like that for people

[30:55] which is why not having an upper playfield in Avatar with the Hallelujah Mountains. It was

[31:01] right there guys. I'm a little surprised that Jersey Jack didn't do anything upward. I really

[31:08] would have liked to have seen that. I think there was a missed opportunity to have a Hallelujah

[31:14] Mountain upper playfield that just sent the ball up there in a magical way. Was is got two upper

[31:19] playfields where you got Guns N' Roses upper playfield, the Pirates of the Caribbean upper

[31:23] playfield. This game is not one-dimensional because of the lower playfields but I do think it's

[31:28] easier to make upper playfields more satisfying than it is to make a lower playfield satisfying.

[31:35] When it comes to the lower playfields I also would have liked there to have been and I don't know

[31:39] how to do this per se but just some sort of effect that made it look like you were looking underwater.

[31:46] I didn't feel that. You know how could we do something really unique there that looked like

[31:50] the ocean waving back and forth and you're seeing down underneath. Again, I'm not an engineer. I'm

[31:57] not a designer but if you're going to do something to bring Pandora to life, how could we simulate

[32:02] the ocean a little bit more in a wow way? Okay, so two more things and I'm sorry this is a long

[32:09] show but you know just I'm excited and I want to talk about a lot of this. Keith is putting a lot

[32:13] in this game. It's almost done. I think you know we're waiting on the final wizard mode and I made

[32:17] a joke to him about it. I'm like really? Here we are again Keith. Final wizard mode not done.

[32:22] There's so much in this game. It's almost like no one can ever get to his final wizard modes

[32:27] so that's what buys him time maybe to never finish them but it's coming he said there's 22 modes

[32:34] and there's a lot and again this gets back to theme. When Keith started talking about avatar and how

[32:40] you play the game and what the objectives are it's another moment where like your head starts to spin

[32:46] a little bit because who amongst us like really knows the avatar universe very well. Collecting

[32:52] sound cords or arrows or beads for necklaces like all this stuff is like it's not stuff we remember

[33:00] really it's not stuff that I don't know if it's exciting to do that stuff and that's why again

[33:06] you're gonna need to make sure that avatar is a theme for you. The callouts they've got the actor

[33:13] from the movie they've got some callouts from other actors in the movie as well. There's still

[33:19] moments I'm just gonna say this there's still moments and I think Jersey Jack needs to work on

[33:23] this a little bit. There were still moments like when a multi-ball was about to start and I'll use

[33:28] like the battle for Hallelujah Mountains right. When they articulate that that multi-ball is about

[33:36] to start it's sometimes delivered in a voice that's not as animated and not as excited as I think it

[33:44] needs to be to really get you going in the mode. It's spoken in the navi sort of the way they talk

[33:52] in the movie but I think you need to do it in like more of like a rally cry moment to get people

[34:00] going like it's like showtime's about to start. Are you ready for the battle for Hallelujah Mountains

[34:06] people? You don't have to add the people in there but I just think some of the callouts can come

[34:10] across as pretty monotone and I think they need to work on that a little bit. The music is phenomenal

[34:18] great music in the game. My final feelings on this game is also something that I've been feeling

[34:24] on quite a few recent Jersey Jack games and this is the one thing I think they need to work on because

[34:30] I was talking to the code team here's the problem I'm noticing with Jersey Jack games and I've seen

[34:35] it in Toy Story. I'm seeing it again in Avatar. I think they fixed it in Godfather. They keep saying

[34:42] they have all the assets they have voices synced up with the actors and I'm watching the game

[34:49] I'm watching people play I'm watching multi-balls I'm watching sequences unfold in the game and

[34:55] I'm not seeing when the clips from the movie are playing and characters are mouths are open

[35:02] they're saying stuff they're either cheering or they're talking to each other you don't hear them

[35:08] and I think Jersey Jack needs to work on this I just don't like muted clips I think they need to

[35:15] if they really want to bring the movies to life we don't watch a movie scene if actors are talking

[35:22] or screaming or yelling or crying or singing we don't want those scenes brought to us when we play

[35:30] the pinball mode of that moment with muted dialogue I think it has something to do with how they layer

[35:37] the sound over the callouts over the clips they need to figure this out because I think it's the one

[35:43] thing that is hamstringing them truly integrating these themes to the best of their ability I mean

[35:51] that and I and I also think it removes a lot of the energy from those moments in the movie because

[35:56] like you've got these epic battles and I'm looking at the screen and stuff's happening people are

[36:01] firing guns and arrows there's like helicopters and exoskeleton fights and you don't hear them

[36:08] you don't hear those characters and I think they need to work on that does it ruin the game no but

[36:15] I think it's what's keeping these games from really elevating and connecting with you the player

[36:22] because the thing is this when you remove that and all you have is like orchestra and callouts where

[36:28] the energy isn't always there there's moments you can be playing a jersey jack game and this is not

[36:34] just avatar there's moments you can be playing a jersey jack game and even though it's beautiful

[36:40] even though everything is coming at you in such a visceral way it can still leave you feeling

[36:46] somewhat numb and it can still come at you in a somewhat sterile way I think it's a fair assessment

[36:54] and I think they need to work on that because I think if there's one thing missing from a lot of

[36:59] these beautiful jersey jack games they need more soul and personality I think that goes all the way

[37:05] back to a game like dialed in dialed in should have been one of the biggest hits ever and the

[37:11] reason it's not it just lacked personality and soul like it just didn't come at you right and so

[37:16] that's the thing I think jersey jack needs to think about that it's not just clips it's not just

[37:21] orchestration it's also like how do I feel when I'm playing this moment I think there's work at

[37:29] JJP to be done by Kiefer in that aspect too because I do get the sense that he codes a game

[37:36] where he's like mapped it all out but I'm not sure he's mapping it out in a way that's like

[37:42] how is the player gonna feel versus like this is the rules and this is how the game unfolds

[37:49] and I heard that Joe Katz does it differently and that is why Joe Katz's games are really starting

[37:56] to get a lot of appreciation because I think Joe codes it more like in real time like they play

[38:02] the game and they figure out what would be most fun and that's what becomes the code so maybe it's

[38:08] different approaches maybe it's different strokes the way they do it but that's just what I think

[38:13] you know as Brett and Jack continue to drive jersey jack pinball into the future I think they

[38:19] need to work on some of those things and I think what would help them is maybe bringing in some

[38:25] outside people to give feedback and this is what's hard with all these companies right if

[38:30] their marketing strategy is secrecy and FOMO I'm not sure who's giving them feedback and you

[38:35] could see when you go over there it's hard not to get stuck in a bubble like staring at your product

[38:41] and you're not getting like a fresh perspective okay so that was a lot that was a lot but in the end

[38:48] should you buy an avatar is avatar gonna blow you away is avatar gonna be competitive is it

[38:54] worth the money right is it worth the money and I just have to say you know I think you need to

[38:59] play it do I see $15,000 in a game next to a game like dialed in which looks like it's got

[39:07] twice as much stuff I don't I don't you know I can see where the money went with avatar but I'm

[39:13] not sure it's translating for me and I see that much money in the game but this is pinball now

[39:20] right you do get a lot for your money I mean trust you do get a lot when you buy that CE that is

[39:25] absolutely stunning so it's really gonna come down to whether or not it's for you now I keep

[39:32] seeing people on pin side saying I ordered one I'm buying one I think you need to jump on this game

[39:39] what I worry about with Jersey Jack is this because I do worry that the Ellie is kind of

[39:43] pointless in this game because there's just so many more reasons to get the CE and if you have

[39:49] 12 you have 15 let's be honest I worry that they're making the Ellie's first which is a mistake

[39:55] they're gonna make the CEs in November which is not that long to wait but it's still a wait

[40:01] Stern will have made every X-Men le by then by next week probably by today probably and I don't

[40:08] want to see this happen to people I don't want to see people continue to buy these $15,000 games

[40:13] and lose a lot of money because they bought it not knowing they enjoyed the game not knowing they

[40:20] like the shots not knowing it's for them and anyone who's ordered this game already has never

[40:28] played it and I don't think anyone is really like die die die hard avatar fan where you're just gonna

[40:33] order it like that and so I just encourage each and every one of you to jump on Mark's game to play

[40:40] it make sure it's the game for you when you go to expo bring headphones plug into the game hear the

[40:47] sound don't play it in a bad environment you won't have a hard time getting one and I think that's

[40:54] a good thing I think this is a really fair review of the game I think the game does stuff really

[41:00] well I think it presents very very nicely I think they need to get some more toys into these games

[41:06] and they need to figure out how to get those clips to be more integrated with the moments we

[41:12] remember from those clips in the films and movies they're bringing at us because they got this beautiful

[41:17] screen but it's just feeling a little disconnected and again if you watch even the greatest action

[41:22] movie of all time if that scene becomes muted you lose everything and I think Jersey Jack needs to

[41:29] make that a focus moving forward we can't have these muted clips anymore it's just not working

[41:35] at least not to canada okay so I spent most of my time at JJP I had a little bit of time

[41:41] George Gomez says let me pick you up picks me up in his 9-11 Porsche him and Jack Danger gave me

[41:47] the most VIP tour of stern pinball I'm gonna give you a little something special from George

[41:52] you'll see soon and I just have to say like Stern's facility is insane like it is insane

[41:59] like it is humongous it is so clean it looks like you could eat off the floor they have so much

[42:05] going on and talking to George and talking to Jack and talking about their strategy for pinball

[42:13] hearing true stories about the Costco games you know Costco went to them and said hey we want to

[42:20] sell pinball in Costco and the games are selling really well they're gonna sell out by the holiday

[42:26] like and then here we are on the internet slamming stern pinball for selling in Costco insulting them

[42:33] I just gang I mean this when I hung out with the JJP people and I hung out with Gomez and I hung

[42:39] out with Jack and I hung out with Mark and Jack together all of you angry people on the internet

[42:46] you need help like you really need some help if your life has distilled down to a place where

[42:52] you can't even enjoy the very thing that you're here for uh you know maybe it's time for a new hobby

[43:02] you could say canada you're being a hypocrite you critique these companies and yeah I do what I just

[43:06] did with avatar is you know kind of how I want to look at these games you know I want to give you

[43:11] a balance and fair opinion about the game and look there's moments gang where I might just flat

[43:18] out I don't want to meet the creative team behind you know company I will not mention

[43:22] new game I don't want to meet the I don't care because I can see what is there is not good

[43:27] it's not creative it's not worth buying and I don't see any passion in that game whatsoever

[43:33] but I respect Jersey Jack pinball and so should you and I respect stern pinball and so should you

[43:39] these are the top two companies in pinball they're making the two best products in all of pinball

[43:45] and so to have the privilege and it was a privilege to be invited after all of the stuff I've said

[43:52] to have the privilege to see both of those operations people at both organizations jump on

[43:58] their two latest creations was amazing it was amazing and it meant a lot to me because remember

[44:03] I've done a lot of work 10 years of this I've never had that experience I haven't seen either

[44:07] company's Chicago facilities and so going to stern getting the VIP tour with George and Jack was

[44:15] awesome and then I jumped on X-Men and I just want to say this I'm not going to go into it in a lot

[44:20] of detail X-Men is epic it's absolutely epic they should change the name from the uncanny X-Men to

[44:27] the epic X-Men it shoots it is maybe one of the best shooting stern pinball machines ever and after

[44:33] playing avatar all day long you know stern still has the edge they still have the edge with the

[44:39] flipper field but my gosh the ball pathways in X-Men are so amazing they are so rewarding to hit

[44:49] the way the ball like flies around that game is so much fun the lower left play field is awesome

[44:58] the danger room is incredible and then the sentinel up the middle I love it and when you see this

[45:05] game and you stand over it zombie eddie's artwork is incredible the le art package is incredible I

[45:12] love how like one side of the cabinet is present day and then the other side is the future where

[45:18] like all the nightmare is happening it is so good and you know and reading on pin side and you know

[45:25] what was sad to me is I walk up and Jack is deflated because he's been reading all of your negativity

[45:31] on pin side all of you like slamming him and the stream and I get it it wasn't the best stream it

[45:37] didn't present the game the best and they have some work to do there but my gosh this game is so

[45:43] much better than foo fighters it is awesome he has no reason to hold his head lower than it should

[45:51] be and his head is a lot higher than mine he has created I think one of the best shooting stern

[45:56] machines ever and I think you're gonna feel the same way now is the code gonna be the best ever

[46:00] and that is a big question mark I don't know but I am gonna tell you even without code you're gonna

[46:05] love this damn game you're gonna love this damn game and zombie eddie's art package I love it it's

[46:11] so different it's so unique everything about it so I just want to say I've been reading this weird

[46:16] vibe of like well X-Men's dead now and because there was an avatar video for 18 minutes that's now

[46:22] the new king and X-Men's over and it's all everyone's gonna go buy avatar you guys honestly

[46:27] everyone needs to just like chill out like go make love to your wives you know go buy your kids

[46:32] some toys go drink a beer but just relax like these are pinball machines meant to bring people

[46:39] together I mean I was hanging out with Colin you remember Colin and I arguing fighting destroying

[46:43] the Twippies we're hanging out having a beer having a good time a scott from loser kid hanging out

[46:48] having a good time real men know how to walk across the aisle shake hands and bury hatchets

[46:54] and one person wouldn't do that and that is the sign of a very small man everybody everybody in

[47:01] awesome time to be in pinball you gotta play both of these machines yes the prices are crazy

[47:07] but you're gonna have to make up your minds on your own and the good news is go to the shows play

[47:13] these games and I'm just gonna tell you this right now the one thing the other thing that's not gonna

[47:17] help avatar right now Harry Potter is coming out in six months it is ready it is coming out in

[47:25] February and I'm gonna tell you this he didn't tell me the title he didn't confirm it but that's

[47:30] my rumor Eric Minier admittedly has made some games that haven't been themes that he personally

[47:37] loves this is the time where we're gonna get what he personally loves with something he can

[47:44] professionally make and I think it's gonna be awesome needs to have toys though it needs to

[47:49] have toys and it better sync up those clips everybody thank you for being a canada club

[47:55] member I haven't done an hour long show in forever but I think this trip warranted that I think this
