[00:00] Happy Monday morning Columbus Day!

[01:57] I thought about how much I love Lord of the Rings and how much I love Batman 66 and

[02:08] I love Batman 66 will never change.

[02:10] They're great games.

[02:12] There are always going to be great games that come out in Pimball and no one machine,

[02:17] no one machine.

[02:18] I don't care how new it is, I don't care how innovative it is, I don't care how it transcends

[02:22] the Pimball experiences we've known.

[02:25] It doesn't really diminish a great game.

[02:29] A great game, it's like a great movie, right?

[02:32] There's new movies with great new special effects that come out every year, right?

[02:36] That doesn't make back to the future any less great of a movie because Avatar has like

[02:42] this 3D technology in it.

[02:44] I think that's the greatest metaphor or example I can give for why I think that that was

[02:49] just a stupid thing for me to say.

[02:51] I'll come out and admit that, especially right now because I think what's happening right

[02:56] now and this is rare.

[02:58] It is really rare that we've experienced something like this.

[03:01] What if Stern and Jersey Jack Pimball both just released great games?

[03:08] They're completely different games and here's the thing too, there is so much conversation

[03:12] going on right now about guns and roses versus Avengers.

[03:15] But here's the stupidest thing about all of this debate happening.

[03:18] I'll tell you right now.

[03:20] Most people have not played either one.

[03:23] Most people have not played either one.

[03:26] We are almost looking at these games like political parties and we're just choosing one side

[03:32] or the other and I think that's stupid.

[03:33] I really do.

[03:34] I do think that's stupid.

[03:36] Here's the thing, I've played one of the two.

[03:39] One of the two.

[03:40] I haven't been able to find an Avengers Ellie or pro or any Avengers game out on location.

[03:45] Now I have a few friends locally that are about to get an Avengers Ellie and I will

[03:50] say this.

[03:51] I will say this.

[03:52] What I can do is I can read about what people are saying about Avengers and I have to say

[03:56] it like the overwhelming consensus is that this game is an incredible shooter.

[04:01] It's an L win pinball machine.

[04:02] Of course it's going to be a shooter and I can tell and I'm just going to say this.

[04:06] I can tell by looking at both guns and roses having played guns and roses and seeing

[04:10] Avengers, these games are radically different.

[04:13] They're radically different pinball experiences and that's okay.

[04:18] It is okay.

[04:19] Obviously guns and roses blows it away in a lot of areas, right?

[04:22] But I will say this, I think Avengers is going to shoot way faster than GNR.

[04:27] Way faster than GNR.

[04:28] It's going to feel more like a race to get through the, you know, like a fast paced pinball

[04:34] race with tons of shots and flow.

[04:37] Guns and roses is not at that speed.

[04:39] It's not going to give you that sensation.

[04:41] But the sensation you do get at guns and roses, which is that of being at a guns and roses

[04:47] concert is unlike anything I've ever experienced before in Pimball.

[04:51] And I'm not sure if Avengers will give us that experience unlike any other ever.

[04:56] That's my point is I think Avengers, what it's going to do really well is going to be really

[05:00] amazing.

[05:01] I just don't think it's going to do anything like first time ever kind of experience and

[05:04] that's okay, right?

[05:06] That's okay.

[05:07] Now I also think that like a game like Avengers is going to make you a better Pimball player

[05:11] because L win makes games like that.

[05:14] It's not going to be the easiest, but once you get the shots dialed in, once you start

[05:18] to understand L win's layout, like it will make you a better Pimball player.

[05:22] Will guns and roses make you a better Pimball player?

[05:25] Probably not so much.

[05:26] Not so much just a different kind of game, but it's a good thing in Pimball that we do

[05:31] have these options.

[05:32] So I don't think that like it has to be this way or that way and that's it.

[05:37] Now the thing I'll say is this, the other part that is inescapable and I have lots of great

[05:42] conversations with my friend Ed Robertson about this is just value.

[05:47] Value is such an interesting topic that we always bring up, but there's no denying

[05:51] the fact that if you have $9,500 and you look at GNR Ellie and look at Avengers Ellie,

[05:58] it's really hard to say that these games should be the same price.

[06:02] You're just getting more in your guns and roses machine.

[06:06] Now I get it.

[06:07] I get it where that value argument falls apart is if you're having more fun on one or

[06:13] the other, then it doesn't matter.

[06:15] And I would agree with that to a certain extent, but it's hard for me to look at a game

[06:20] any Eastern game lately and just be like these great games and they do make some great

[06:24] games, but the even the best Stern machine just feels like it should cost $7,500 because

[06:31] you're just not getting anything more in the game for their Ellie.

[06:35] My debate's always been around the Stern Ellie's and how you're just not getting what

[06:39] you're paying for.

[06:40] You're not.

[06:41] You're not.

[06:42] And with the amount of machines they make every year, the Stern Ellie's just don't even

[06:46] go down as being like hard to find hard to get games.

[06:49] They just aren't.

[06:51] And that's just been my point is that I think legitimately you have a $2,000 price increase

[06:57] in a Jersey Jack machine because there's $2,000 more in the games and it shows.

[07:01] It definitely shows.

[07:02] Okay.

[07:03] Now here's why I think it's a win-win.

[07:05] So win-win for Pimball because with Guns and Roses having the success it's had.

[07:10] You can't tell me that Stern Pimball designers are not looking at this launch.

[07:15] I mean, I heard John Borg was at Great American Pimball playing Guns and Roses super excited

[07:20] to see that game out in the wild.

[07:22] If you're a designer of Pimball, this is a great moment for you because I think this gives

[07:27] you some leverage to go to your company and say, hey, we need to keep raising the bar.

[07:32] We need to keep putting as much as we can in these games because look what the people

[07:36] want.

[07:37] Look what the people are excited about.

[07:38] Look what's selling.

[07:39] I mean, they sold out of a $12,500 game in just two hours and they sold 500 of them.

[07:47] That's incredible.

[07:48] And a thousand people lined up to get it.

[07:50] I mean, if they made a thousand Guns and Roses to see ease, they would have had a home

[07:55] for everyone.

[07:56] Now, look, some people would have dropped off because they would have said that's too

[07:58] many.

[07:59] It's not going to be that rare.

[08:00] I'm not jumping in early on.

[08:01] It is that fear of missing out that plays a role in getting that many people to order

[08:05] on day one.

[08:06] But if you're over at Stern, you best believe that you're walking into Gary and George's

[08:11] office and saying, unshackle me.

[08:14] Unshackle me and let me give you what I'm capable of.

[08:17] And I think that's going to happen.

[08:19] I mean, I already heard from the people who worked on Avengers that Elwin's next pin

[08:23] is going to be one where there were no restrictions.

[08:26] Okay, no restrictions.

[08:27] So I'm here to tell you right now.

[08:29] And can he just spin ball podcast that Elwin's next one is going to have even way more in

[08:33] it than Avengers.

[08:34] I mean, look, even when I look at Avengers with the wire forms and the shots, it still feels

[08:38] to me like Keith can design a game like that in his sleep.

[08:41] I know that he's, he can put even way more sort of toys and gimmicks into his games and

[08:47] fun stuff.

[08:48] I know he can and he's going to this is not the end of Keith Elwin.

[08:52] This isn't the best Keith Elwin can do.

[08:54] This isn't even the best Eric Minier can do.

[08:56] We know that these guys have to actually, you know, design to a cost as well.

[09:00] Like as much as it, it seems like everything went into guns and roses and then some, no,

[09:05] there was stuff taken out.

[09:06] There was stuff taken out.

[09:08] Now you best believe next time Eric makes a game, Pat Lawler is not going to be able to walk

[09:12] over and start yanking stuff out.

[09:14] You know why?

[09:15] Because Eric's a bankable guy.

[09:17] Can we talk for a second?

[09:18] Do you think Pat Lawler's feeling the pressure?

[09:20] I mean, if Pat Lawler, he's seeing all this.

[09:22] He's seeing the frenzy.

[09:24] He must be feeling somewhat stressed out that Toy Story does not deliver.

[09:28] Are you ready for the first Canadian rumor of today?

[09:31] I've got a bunch of them.

[09:32] It's why you listen to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[09:34] Canadian will not get the interviews.

[09:36] I just won't get the interviews, but I'm here to tell you stuff that no one else is going

[09:40] to tell you on this show, right?

[09:42] So welcome to episode 520.

[09:43] So here's the first rumor that I've heard and this is from another inside source over

[09:48] at Jersey Jack Pimball, okay?

[09:50] So I'm hearing that you will not see Toy Story, that the earliest you're going to see Toy Story

[09:55] and the next game from Jersey Jack Pimball is nine months away.

[10:00] Nine months, like this thing's not coming out in March, I think the next you're going

[10:03] to see it is in June of 2021, okay?

[10:08] So nine months.

[10:09] I mean, they have so many orders for guns and roses.

[10:12] It kind of makes sense that they can't even think about making another game with where

[10:17] the orders are for GNR.

[10:18] So you're heard it here first on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[10:21] Nine months from now is when we will get Toy Story.

[10:24] So if you're thinking about waiting for Toy Story, that's a long wait.

[10:27] So it's not happening right around the corner, all right?

[10:30] Now speaking of guns and roses orders, here's the big question I have.

[10:33] Obviously, thousands of people want this game.

[10:35] I mean, this game is a sales success.

[10:38] Now here's the real issue.

[10:39] So the real difference between Jersey Jack and Stern isn't just this.

[10:43] It's not just like making a sexier game, making a game with more in it.

[10:47] Can you make the game?

[10:49] I mean, Stern makes 50 games a day.

[10:52] 50 games a day, Stern can just crank out.

[10:55] They can get everyone their Ellie isn't just two weeks, right?

[10:58] That's 250 a week.

[11:00] Every Ellie of Avengers will be out in two weeks.

[11:03] And we're seeing it right now.

[11:05] Everyone is unboxing their Avengers Ellie at the same time.

[11:08] There's no months and months of waiting.

[11:11] And so how can Jersey Jack Pinball now make the games they took orders on?

[11:17] And how can they make these games fast enough to satiate a community that is pretty used

[11:23] to getting stuff, you know, quickly?

[11:25] Because to me, the big question is they made a big statement with having 100 games ready.

[11:30] 100 Ellie's were ready on launch day, which was awesome.

[11:33] But the real question is this, how long did it take them to make those 100 games, right?

[11:39] Did it take them a week or two or three?

[11:42] And so then you start to do the math on the amount of orders they got, 500 collectors

[11:48] additions.

[11:49] God knows how many Ellie's I'm sure they might have got almost 2,000 orders for Ellie's

[11:55] with the amount of hype and attention this game has.

[11:58] So I asked them, you know, how many are you making a week?

[12:00] I officially went out and they're not going to tell you like it's confidential information.

[12:05] But some of the rumors are 60 games a week.

[12:07] I think it's got to be more than that.

[12:09] But having talked to people back in the New Jersey factory, the most amount of Willy

[12:14] Wankas they ever made in a single day when they were at their capacity and at full efficiency

[12:20] was 20 a day.

[12:22] So that would be 100 games a week.

[12:24] But this factory is bigger.

[12:26] But I'm not sure if they're staffed up to the same level that they were in New Jersey

[12:31] when New Jersey was running at full efficiency.

[12:33] So it's a brand new company in Chicago with a lot of new people.

[12:37] So they obviously are having a ramp up period.

[12:40] But it did look like there was a lot of people in that picture.

[12:42] But I'm not sure how many of those people are on the assembly line and how many of those

[12:46] people are in the design office and all the other offices at JJP.

[12:50] But the question remains is how many can they make a week?

[12:53] And if it's too slow, what will that do to the excitement around this game?

[13:00] Are people going to want to wait for months, three months, six months to get their games

[13:05] if their orders are in?

[13:06] Now I'm here to tell you right now.

[13:08] After playing guns and roses, I do mean it when I say I would wait an eternity for this

[13:14] game.

[13:15] This game is really that good that you should just get your deposit in, go to bed at night,

[13:21] know that you're going to get one of the coolest pinball machines ever made if not one of

[13:25] the coolest.

[13:26] And don't worry about it every day.

[13:29] Don't stress about it every day.

[13:30] You're going to get your collector's editions when they make them.

[13:33] They're going to make them right.

[13:35] They're waiting on playfields I heard.

[13:37] And so yes, you're not all going to get them probably by the end of the year.

[13:41] I mean, I've just already chalked it up to that.

[13:43] Like it's already November in a couple of weeks.

[13:46] There is no way I think they get all 500 made by Christmas.

[13:51] I would love to see that.

[13:52] I just don't think they're going to be able to do that plus the L.E.s plus the S.E.s.

[13:58] It's just hard for them to make these games fast enough right now just because the demand

[14:03] is so high.

[14:04] Each Jack Pinball has never had this issue before.

[14:07] There has never been a launch of a Jersey Jack game that saw this kind of frenzy.

[14:13] Remember, like this is special.

[14:15] This is new and this is new to them.

[14:17] And best believe there are going to be some stumbles along the way as this company figures

[14:24] out how to now satiate the incredible demand that came to their door.

[14:29] It's not just going to be roses, right?

[14:31] There's going to be some issues with them trying to figure this out.

[14:34] And they're still a small company and they're still growing and they're still learning.

[14:39] But I will say this, the product is worth it.

[14:41] The product is worth it and you're going to need to have some patience.

[14:44] Now this is not going to be a spooky pinball where there's 18 months to wait on the game

[14:49] if you're at the end of the Rick and Morty line.

[14:51] And I do want to say yes, I am sorry that I said guns and roses makes Rick and Morty

[14:56] look kind of crappy.

[14:58] But look, some of this is true though, people.

[15:00] Look, some of it just is true.

[15:02] Like if you put a $9,700 Rick and Morty next to a $9,500 guns and roses, I mean it's

[15:10] hard.

[15:11] It's hard to look at them and say how could these cost the same amount of money?

[15:16] How on planet earth could these be the same amount of money?

[15:18] All right.

[15:19] But again, spooky sold out.

[15:20] So it doesn't matter.

[15:21] Spooky pinball kind of showed JJP how to do it.

[15:24] Like how to create a sales frenzy.

[15:26] Now the other question that still continues to sort of hang over this whole thing and I

[15:30] think, you know, they don't have to tell us how many they're making a week, but I think

[15:34] what they do need to start telling people is how does it work with direct order versus

[15:40] ordering through a distributor because you could still direct order your Ellie on JJP.com

[15:47] or you could go to a distributor.

[15:49] And I still think people have no clue which one is the better way to go, which one will

[15:54] get you your game faster.

[15:56] And I think Jersey Jack Pinball needs to figure this part out because this is not right.

[16:00] Like if you could directly order from Stern and cut the distributor line, you would.

[16:04] Stern does not sell you games directly at all.

[16:08] There is no direct sale.

[16:10] JJP I think needs to decide it's one way or the other.

[16:13] They can't do it this way.

[16:15] There's just too much consumer confusion as to which way they should go.

[16:20] And I think they need to go with distributors.

[16:23] Those are your sales force.

[16:25] Distributors are the people that are building their relationships with your customers not

[16:29] just on this game, but on all future games.

[16:32] And also distributors are just amazing people that help you out when you need help, right?

[16:37] When the going's good, it's so, it's so, I think it's kind of a moral when the going

[16:42] is good to cut out your distributors because that's not fair.

[16:45] They're also there for you when the going is bad.

[16:48] Who do you think are the ones picking up the phones when people are having problems with

[16:51] their pie or to the Caribbean or people's play fields are having issues with Willy

[16:55] Waka.

[16:56] It's your distributors that are calming your customers down to keep them customers for

[17:00] life.

[17:01] So I just think maybe a moral is too strong of a word, but I just think it's a little

[17:05] bit like a it's bad business practice is I think the best way to say it.

[17:09] All right.

[17:10] So you ready for the next rumor?

[17:11] I think I've been dropping this rumor.

[17:12] So I'm hearing a rumor that Stern Pimball is not going to take this line down that Stern

[17:18] Pimball is going to reveal a new game in the next couple weeks.

[17:24] That's what I heard.

[17:25] Now is it Led Zeppelin?

[17:27] Are they going to drop a music pin and show people what they've been working on with

[17:30] Led Zeppelin and Steve Richie?

[17:32] I heard this game is 16 months in the work.

[17:35] So it's going to be a game that's full featured.

[17:38] It's going to be a game that is three models pro premium Ellie.

[17:41] It look, it's either Led Zeppelin or Queen.

[17:43] I keep saying this.

[17:44] It's either Led Zeppelin or Queen.

[17:47] It's one or the other.

[17:48] There's the debate raging on like is Zeppelin more popular than this more popular than

[17:53] Guns and Roses.

[17:54] The problem with bands and album sales and then translation to Pimball, it doesn't really

[17:58] add up and I'll tell you why.

[18:00] Number one, number one album sales Beatles beats everybody like beats everybody and look

[18:05] how the Beatles Pimball sold.

[18:07] Now you could argue it was because it was a reskin, but still if you wanted Beatles music

[18:11] while you're playing Pimball, they did it.

[18:13] They made it for people and that's like the number one act ever and it didn't sell

[18:17] well.

[18:18] Obviously Led Zeppelin is a bigger band than Guns and Roses.

[18:22] They almost have I think three times the amount of album sales globally.

[18:25] They were around for a lot longer as a band.

[18:27] They made nine albums, but they're older.

[18:30] I mean Led Zeppelin came out, I believe in 1964 I want to say.

[18:35] I might be 1964.

[18:36] That's 20 years before Guns and Roses even formed.

[18:40] Guns and Roses appetite came out in 1986.

[18:43] So the question is, is the demographic for Led Zeppelin, the primary Pimball purchasing

[18:48] audience right now?

[18:50] And I don't think so.

[18:51] I think it's a generation earlier.

[18:52] I really do.

[18:54] I don't think Led Zeppelin has the same sort of like frenzy as GNR does in the current

[19:00] Pimball marketing landscape.

[19:02] If we say that most people 4260 are primary target, I would argue like it's more like 35

[19:10] to 55 is probably the primary target base for new inbox Pimball purchases.

[19:17] And I think Zeppelin's just a little too old for the sweet spot there.

[19:22] GNR hits the sweet spot perfectly.

[19:24] I mean, I'm 44 and Guns and Roses was like the biggest band when I was growing up.

[19:29] I mean, they were, they were it.

[19:31] They were it.

[19:32] The late 80s, early 90s, it was them.

[19:34] Like they hit, they took the world over.

[19:36] So we'll see.

[19:37] So I think everyone is like, they're never going to get the assets that Slash gave them.

[19:42] And that's true.

[19:43] Like we know that.

[19:44] So I just think it'd be crazy for Stern though to release a music pin on top of Guns and

[19:48] Roses.

[19:49] But here's the thing and here's what Stern's strategy might be.

[19:52] They might be looking at this thing and like, yeah, yeah, that's great.

[19:55] All these people think Guns and Roses is amazing.

[19:57] But Jersey Jack Pimball is not going to be able to make those pins.

[20:01] And Stern might be making a move here to flex their manufacturing muscle.

[20:05] And they might say, hey, you know, that's cool.

[20:07] But if you want to lead Zeppelin, Ellie, you can have it like in a week.

[20:10] We're going to get 2000 games out by the end of the year if we may start making it on

[20:14] our other line right now.

[20:15] And so that might be the move.

[20:17] They might look at what's happening at JJP and they might know because they know about

[20:22] manufacturing that this company and the size they're at, they're going to start to like

[20:27] sink underneath the demand of this game because I can't manufacture them fast enough.

[20:31] And I think Stern might do a manufacturing sort of flex right here.

[20:35] And I think they might try to show JJP.

[20:37] Yeah, that's cute.

[20:38] You got, you finally got one hit like welcome to the party.

[20:41] We've been making hits for years, right?

[20:44] I think they might do some of this and I think they might try to show them but really

[20:47] where the wins are, really where the championship lies is in manufacturing and we're going to

[20:52] show you how it's done.

[20:53] So we'll see, we'll see, but you're heard it here first on Gunnage Spinball Podcast.

[20:57] In a couple of weeks, is there going to be a new Stern machine?

[21:00] Now the great news about these rumors, if I just say rumor and I'm wrong, then you can't,

[21:04] you can't yell at me, can't yell at me.

[21:06] Before I go on to my final rumor, which is a big one, which is my final rumor, I want

[21:10] to say this, I was speaking to someone who got the cruise men playfield on their Rick and

[21:15] Morty, Jeffrey Jones, I believe it was.

[21:17] He got the cruise men option on his Rick and Morty game from spooky pinball.

[21:22] It's a $700 I think option.

[21:25] And supposedly, you know, cruise men playfields, they're great.

[21:28] I mean, he does an amazing job and cruise men, usually you go to cruise men when you're

[21:33] restoring an older game and he brings it back to life and makes it look better than it

[21:38] ever did.

[21:39] I mean, his clear coat is insane, but it's weird to clear coat a new game, right?

[21:43] It's like no one normally does that, like sends a brand new game to cruise men to clear.

[21:48] And I talked to Chuck and he was like, yeah, you know, you don't need to.

[21:51] He's like, personally, I wouldn't do it.

[21:52] Like our clear coat's amazing and he's right.

[21:54] Like the Rick and Morty clear coat is still the best clear coat on any new inbox game

[21:58] right now.

[21:59] And my friend got his cruise men, Rick and Morty and I asked him like a couple weeks later,

[22:04] did you see any dimples?

[22:05] And he's like, Chris, I hate to admit it, but I saw some dimples in the game and I'm

[22:10] like, there you go.

[22:11] So for those of you out there who are thinking of spending the extra money, I don't know

[22:15] if you need to.

[22:16] I think you're going to be happy with what you get right from spooky.

[22:19] All right.

[22:20] All right.

[22:21] Anything else going on in pinball?

[22:22] Oh yeah, the El Vira topper was shown.

[22:23] Zach, many put up a video of this thing and, you know, I don't think you'll ever get the

[22:27] time back in your life if you watch the video of it.

[22:30] The topper looks cheap.

[22:31] It doesn't look like a thousand dollar topper.

[22:34] It's just stupid.

[22:35] It's stupid.

[22:36] Like, she pops up in screams and that's it and the lights up on the gargoyles and a thousand

[22:41] dollars.

[22:42] That costs more.

[22:44] Twice the price of a PlayStation 5.

[22:46] It's stupid.

[22:47] It's an absolutely stupid topper.

[22:48] I mean, and for the amount of money people spent on those signature additions, they should

[22:52] get that topper for free.

[22:54] They didn't offer it to those people.

[22:56] You think steering would at least, at least, been like you 50 people who spent 15 grand,

[23:02] you get it for free.

[23:03] No, now that game is now $16,000 with that silly topper.

[23:07] And look, when we had nothing to talk about, these toppers were news.

[23:10] I just want to say that I watched the video, Zach, and I'll never get that time back in

[23:14] my life.

[23:15] That thing sucks.

[23:16] All right.

[23:17] It does.

[23:18] It sucks.

[23:19] All right.

[23:20] Here's the final rumor I heard.

[23:21] Now, I don't know if this is accurate or not, okay?

[23:23] But the only reason I'm going to say this on my show is I've been wondering what's been

[23:29] taking this company so long.

[23:30] And when I heard this rumor, and the person said it's from a reliable source of someone

[23:35] he knows in there, as you know, it just starts to make a little bit more sense as to why

[23:40] there's been such a delay.

[23:42] Now, I still, again, even as I'm about to say it, I'm still just like, oh, I don't know.

[23:48] So the rumor I'm hearing is this, that the reason why there's been such delay over

[23:53] at Chicago Gaming Company is because Cactus Canyon remake is not the next game from them.

[24:00] And it's not the next remake that's coming out.

[24:02] I'm hearing that the next remake from Chicago Gaming Company is going to be the theater

[24:09] of magic or theater of magic, J-Pops, game from back in the day.

[24:14] Now take that with the grain of salt.

[24:16] Do you think Chicago Gaming Company's next title will actually be theater of magic and

[24:21] not Cactus Canyon remake?

[24:24] Now I don't know.

[24:25] I mean, I've heard, but I haven't heard theater of magic ever be mentioned as being next.

[24:30] So let's just hypothetically play this out.

[24:34] Is theater of magic more in demand than Cactus Canyon?

[24:36] Well, it's more of a complete game.

[24:38] I think a lot of people put theater of magic down as J-Pops best game.

[24:42] Did they possibly do this to sort of release a J-Pop classic while John's trying to get

[24:47] his Raza out the door?

[24:48] Was that a strategic move?

[24:50] There is no Raza going out the door as we know now.

[24:53] I don't know.

[24:54] You know, theater of magic is a really cool game.

[24:55] It's a beautiful game.

[24:56] When you see a theater of magic with all brass plating, I don't think you can look over

[25:02] a game that's much more beautiful than that game and circus full tear and totem.

[25:06] I mean, old J-Pop Valley Williams games are amazing.

[25:09] But again, they're amazing because Valley Williams made them amazing.

[25:12] I'm tired of giving John credit because it's clear that he didn't make this stuff magical

[25:16] other people did because look at what he does without them.

[25:19] The theater of magic is incredible.

[25:20] And if they made a brand new theater of magic, I think they would sell well just because

[25:25] the game itself has so many toys.

[25:29] It's such a fun shooter.

[25:30] It's such a fun pinball machine.

[25:32] I love theater of magic.

[25:33] That trunk is still one of the greatest toys and gimmicks in pinball history.

[25:38] It almost would make more sense to do theater of magic because I think there is more excitement

[25:42] for that game than Cactus Canyon.

[25:45] But both of them are classics.

[25:46] Both of them are highly sought after by collectors.

[25:49] So we'll see.

[25:50] The question is when now, right?

[25:53] Chicago gaming company, it just feels like they never release anything.

[25:58] It's just there's never any news going on.

[26:00] There's never any momentum with this company.

[26:03] And I really want them to jump in the ring.

[26:05] I just think they waited a little too long because I do think a lot of people, a lot of

[26:09] people just committed to spending $9,500 or $12,500.

[26:13] And a lot of those people also might be getting in Avengers.

[26:16] So Chicago gaming company, you waited too long.

[26:19] People have too much money tied up in other games.

[26:22] It's just they're not going to cancel their ordering and just go right back to an older

[26:26] game because anyone who really wants a theater of magic right now for 9 grand can go get

[26:30] one.

[26:31] Like can go get the game.

[26:32] And I just think that like they need to figure out a better system here over at CGC because

[26:37] they're getting left behind.

[26:39] They're getting left behind.

[26:40] Now they don't need to come out with games ever as I said because Churchill makes so much

[26:44] money.

[26:45] This company doesn't treat Pimball like the priority and it shows it's not.

[26:49] It's not the priorities.

[26:51] Churchill and what they make that's the annuity.

[26:54] This is like Amtron and American Pimball like Amtron is a multi-million dollar company.

[26:59] American Pimball can't even sell like a thousand games right.

[27:01] So it's just different when it's not the priority.

[27:05] Over at Stern Pimball is the priority at Jersey Jack Pimball is the priority.

[27:09] It's just so much different.

[27:10] We just heard Bubba scuffle in.

[27:11] All right, anything else on this episode of Canatus Pimball Podcast?

[27:14] No, that is it.

[27:15] This has been episode 520.

[27:17] You got some good rumors.

[27:19] It's an exciting time to be in Pimball for everybody.

[27:21] I will say this.

[27:22] Let's not kill each other over two amazing games that have just come out.

[27:25] I think there's room for both these games.

[27:28] And I think this is just a win-win for Pimball because it's going to push not only these designers

[27:33] to keep improving what they create.

[27:35] It's going to push these companies to put more in machines if they see.

[27:39] This is where the money goes.

[27:41] Like I will say this.

[27:42] Stern's going to feel it.

[27:44] And it's good that they're going to feel it.

[27:45] It's good that they're going to hear, hey, some people cancel the Avengers because they

[27:49] went and wanted guns and roses.

[27:51] We want Stern Pimball to hear that so they can start to put more into their games and

[27:55] they can and they will.

[27:57] I mean, Stern has always stepped up when pushed and challenged to step up.

[28:01] They've delivered.

[28:02] So it's a good time for all of us as customers to see this happen.

[28:06] So thank you to JJP and thank you to Stern for two great games.

[28:10] And I've said it, everyone else out there that's sort of dragging their feet in Pimball.

[28:14] It's going to be hard.

[28:15] There's not much money and room left for everyone else in this hobby.

[28:20] It's going to be brutal unless you have a magical game that people want.

[28:23] All right, everyone.

[28:24] That was episode 520.

[28:25] Have a good day.
