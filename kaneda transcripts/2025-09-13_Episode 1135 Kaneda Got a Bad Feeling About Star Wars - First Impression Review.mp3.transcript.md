[00:00] You got the biggest company in pinball, you got the biggest theme in pinball, stern and

[00:26] star wars.

[00:31] To release something that would wow us.

[00:33] Would they be able to justify a $13,000 le?

[00:38] Was this going to be John Borg's masterpiece?

[00:41] Or was it going to be just another stern?

[00:45] How could they not put their greatest designer in all of pinball in Keith Elwyn and Jack Danger?

[00:51] Both of them are equally amazing.

[00:53] How could they not give star wars to those guys?

[00:56] We get a two-flipper game, eight shots, one after another, we get an adat that is the

[01:02] size of my pinky.

[01:04] And this is the biggest pinball company making the biggest theme in history.

[01:08] And I'm just here to tell you right now, I have never in my 12 years of reviewing pinball

[01:15] machine launches, I have never been so underwhelmed as I was yesterday.

[01:23] And I'm just going to be fully candid on this episode.

[01:26] I think stern pinball needs a hard reset.

[01:31] Everything about what this game is to me is like telegraphing.

[01:36] That stern pinball has sort of lost the narrative.

[01:39] They've lost the mission.

[01:40] Right?

[01:41] If this is like, if this is the rebels trying to defeat the empire, I mean, I hate to say

[01:45] this, but ironically, this game is labeled appropriately for stern pinball.

[01:51] The fall of the empire.

[01:53] This is what a company that has become as big as stern, that has as much ability to send

[02:00] thousands of pinball machines out in the world in just a few months.

[02:05] This is what it looks like when your empire has lost creativity.

[02:11] When you design an adat mechanism in the movie, you are harpooning around its legs.

[02:19] And that is what causes the adat to fall down.

[02:22] Sturmbinball has you looping the ball over the adat, over it, like literally over it.

[02:28] And you're telling me this is the best you could come up with.

[02:31] And then the adat is super tiny.

[02:34] I mean, I like the way it falls down, but the scale is horrible.

[02:37] It should have been huge.

[02:38] It should have been really big.

[02:40] It should have walked a little bit.

[02:42] It should be firing the cannons from its head.

[02:45] Firing these tiny little tinker toys.

[02:47] And worse than that, they used shooter rod handles from the old Star Wars game, the Vader

[02:54] one and the freaking stormtrooper heads.

[02:57] And they just dropped them.

[02:58] They just dropped them on each side of the game.

[03:01] It looks terrible.

[03:02] Oh my gosh.

[03:03] When I saw it, I was like, this is cake toppers 2.0.

[03:06] Cake toppers 2.0.

[03:08] And you know why those pop bumpers are on the side of the game?

[03:11] You know why they really put them there?

[03:13] That's because they thought that would be a fun gameplay element.

[03:16] I heard this game, like you could go on for hours and it never drained.

[03:19] So they had to put them there to create some drains.

[03:23] And then you got Yoda looking at you the whole time creeping you out.

[03:27] I just think everything about this game when I watch it, and I just watched an hour of

[03:31] all the different gameplay footages that are out there on the internet.

[03:34] So thank you to all the media guys who went over there and wasted your money because you

[03:39] seriously wasted your money to go there to see that game.

[03:43] I have never been so unexcited watching gameplay, watching clips, watching what I love.

[03:52] And look, it's still jumping all over the place.

[03:55] It's weird to me.

[03:56] And I know Stern does this with movie clips, but it's just lacking style.

[04:00] It's lacking taste.

[04:01] You know, I got this bigger screen and I was just looking at this.

[04:05] I couldn't believe this because I was like, wait a minute.

[04:07] I don't remember when you watch the opening crawl to each movie, you know, when the text

[04:12] is sort of slowly fading into space.

[04:16] I don't remember the text ever being cut off.

[04:19] And so I'm looking at the Stern crawl.

[04:21] You've got this bigger screen in Spike 3, a bigger screen for the first time ever.

[04:26] And I'm looking at it and the text is cut off on the words as it's starting to crawl

[04:31] into the background.

[04:34] And I was like, wait, was it always like that in the movie theater?

[04:36] I don't remember it being like that.

[04:38] And then I went and watched the movie clip, the actual crawl from the movie and it's not

[04:42] cut off.

[04:44] And this is it, man.

[04:45] This is it for me.

[04:46] I'm just saying this right now.

[04:47] I'm really upset.

[04:48] Stern fanball just doesn't get it.

[04:50] Like they literally don't get it anymore.

[04:52] Like nobody saw that and said, hey, on the crawl, we're cutting off the text and that's

[04:58] going to be really noticeable to all the people that remember this as the iconic opening to

[05:05] the movie.

[05:06] And it's just weird to me.

[05:08] And the other part that's really weird is it doesn't say a long time ago in a galaxy

[05:13] far, far away, which is the most iconic way to start the game.

[05:16] Anyway, I've watched a lot of gameplay and the gameplay itself seems like a total snooze

[05:21] fest.

[05:22] How do you go from Keith Elwyn?

[05:24] How do you go from Jack Danger to this?

[05:27] And it's just got like nothing interesting in it.

[05:29] Like nothing.

[05:30] I kept watching the Mechs, the Rams, the Death Star, Jabba, the Balls saved from GoldenEye,

[05:37] like recycled ideas, recycle, recycle, recycle.

[05:40] I just feel when I look at this game, the whole thing looks like it was designed in

[05:43] a weekend.

[05:44] It looks like it was designed in a weekend.

[05:46] It looks like I could have designed this game.

[05:48] And that's a bad thing for me to ever say.

[05:49] If I ever see a pinball machine and say it looks like I could have done that, yeah, we're

[05:54] in a bad place.

[05:55] I got a bad feeling about this.

[05:57] And after an hour of watching all the clips, seeing the media people's footage, it's never

[06:02] been easier to tell Melissa over at CoinTaker, I'm out.

[06:07] I'm out.

[06:08] I'm not buying a $13,000 LE and let's talk about the LE.

[06:12] Like it is blue and its empire strikes back.

[06:16] The artwork on the cabinets.

[06:18] I just don't like it.

[06:19] I don't like anything about it.

[06:21] Like nothing excites me.

[06:23] And again, Stern pinball has destroyed the very thing it created, the three tier model

[06:30] system that always historically made you want the LE.

[06:36] I have not felt the desire to really want a Stern LE in about five years.

[06:43] They have absolutely destroyed it.

[06:46] And so when you destroy the LE being anything important to have, then everything else just

[06:51] feels like why bother?

[06:52] And then knowing they're going to make a 50th anniversary of this game, which will most

[06:58] likely have all of the spike three upgrades, which will most likely be the one to get.

[07:05] Why?

[07:06] Why would you pop down $13,000 on an LE?

[07:10] I actually think the premium art package looks better than the LE.

[07:14] I'm just over this.

[07:16] Stern, you need a hard reset.

[07:19] You need to look at this stuff differently.

[07:23] This game just doesn't feel like this is the best Stern pinball could do.

[07:27] It doesn't in any way, shape or form.

[07:29] Does this game actually excite you more than Ghostbusters?

[07:33] Does it excite you more than Tron?

[07:36] Does it excite you more than Godzilla?

[07:38] Does it excite you more than even Rush?

[07:40] It just feels like, eh, eh, you know, it's like a shoulder shrug moment.

[07:45] And you know, I'm here to tell you right now, exclusive to the world.

[07:48] And for this, I don't think anyone else knows this.

[07:51] Stern pinball, I'm confirming it, is making Transformers.

[07:55] Now, that was a rumor, but here's what you don't know.

[07:58] I'm confirming for you that the designer on Transformers, which might come out before

[08:03] Pokemon because they're having some issues with Pokemon licensing, Transformers will

[08:10] be designed.

[08:12] Not by Keith Elwyn, not by Jack Danger, not by George Gomez, not by Brian Eddy, not by

[08:19] John Boer.

[08:20] You're like, wha-who?

[08:21] They're giving Transformers to Elliot Eisman, the dude that did John Wick.

[08:28] Alright, so again, Stern pinball, lost the narrative.

[08:32] Transformers should have been given to Keith Elwyn.

[08:35] You're gonna give fallout to Keith Elwyn and not Transformers?

[08:38] It's funny to me watching what is really the fall of the pinball empire.

[08:43] I mean, this is it.

[08:44] They are making it so easy not to buy their product.

[08:48] Does anything about this game make you feel like I have to own this?

[08:52] I have to own this game.

[08:54] And I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and I don't think I ever, ever thought I'd be watching

[09:00] the hobby I love, pinball, and a theme I love.

[09:03] Think about that.

[09:04] I'm putting two things together that I absolutely love.

[09:07] Star Wars and pinball.

[09:09] And then I'm watching all of the footage, and I don't think I could be more unimpressed,

[09:14] unexcited than I was yesterday and this morning, and I have zero regrets about not even wanting

[09:22] one.

[09:23] I will play it on location.

[09:24] This game is an operator's dream.

[09:27] It's an operator's dream.

[09:29] Nothing's gonna break.

[09:31] Nothing's really in it.

[09:32] And it's Star Wars, and it's gonna pull people in.

[09:35] But owning one, no one's gonna feel like, wow, you got one, you got an LE.

[09:40] Nobody cares.

[09:41] I was talking to distributors.

[09:42] The phones are not ringing off the hook to get one.

[09:46] This game is gonna be here today, gone tomorrow in terms of community excitement.

[09:52] It's also, it's not exciting.

[09:54] Eight shots, two flippers.

[09:57] They're not even like creative.

[09:58] Like the fact that they put a pinball where the Magna save is really, why do you have

[10:02] to put a pinball there?

[10:03] The whole point of like using the force and Yoda like magically saving your ball.

[10:08] It should feel like magic.

[10:10] But when you put a pinball there, you ruin the magic.

[10:13] You telegraph what's gonna happen.

[10:15] What's wrong with you people?

[10:17] Stern, seriously, you know my number.

[10:19] Hire me.

[10:20] Hire me.

[10:21] I've never asked anybody to hire me like this.

[10:23] You need help.

[10:24] Is nobody walking around these games being like, really, really?

[10:28] The ad-at's gonna be that big.

[10:29] That looks kind of small, guys.

[10:31] I gotta tell you.

[10:32] In the movies, it's ginormous.

[10:34] Are we really gonna recycle all these ideas?

[10:36] Are we gonna recycle shooter rods in a $13,000 product?

[10:41] Are we gonna, in our Spike 3 system, the best we can do on our new platform is recycle

[10:48] the expression lighting?

[10:49] We're not gonna innovate the way the lighting can be in our games.

[10:53] That is lazy.

[10:54] I think that's gonna change in the like next version of Spike 3.

[10:58] And even when they were like releasing this game, they were talking how all this more exciting

[11:03] stuff is about to come with Spike 3.

[11:06] Thank you.

[11:07] Thank you for making it easier not to buy this game.

[11:09] You just told me you're gonna make better improvements to the platform, and now you're

[11:14] also asking me to invest in this version of the halfway version of the platform.

[11:19] What a terrible marketing idea.

[11:21] Again, CMO, chief marketing officer.

[11:24] If we are coming out with Star Wars, and we're coming out with our new platform, and

[11:29] Spooky Pinball is looking that good, and Harry Potter is looking amazing, we cannot go to

[11:34] market with something that doesn't showcase the greatest potential of our organization.

[11:41] That is the brief.

[11:42] That is the brief on day one.

[11:44] When we know we have Star Wars, we are giving it to you, Keith.

[11:47] It is yours.

[11:48] You are getting the biggest theme.

[11:49] You are gonna get everything, all the horsepower, all the ammunition that we have in Spike

[11:55] 3 is going to you, and we need you to crush it.

[11:59] How was that not the brief for Star Wars?

[12:02] No.

[12:03] Go make King Kong.

[12:04] Go make Illustrated King Kong.

[12:05] Don't use the iconic movie posters.

[12:08] Go animate it.

[12:09] Go make an unexciting King Kong game.

[12:12] This is Stern Pinball.

[12:13] We are in trouble, people.

[12:15] The Empire is falling.

[12:17] It is weak.

[12:18] It is strong because now all of us, think about it, all of us are the rebels.

[12:22] We are the rebels.

[12:23] We are rebelling against Stern Pinball charging this much for this kind of product.

[12:29] When I looked at these games yesterday, it is the first thing I said to all of my friends,

[12:34] this looks like a really fun $8,000 LE.

[12:38] It is an embarrassment.

[12:40] They think this is $13,000.

[12:43] No, I am not buying one.

[12:45] No, I can't flip one.

[12:47] Is that the reason why I am not buying one?

[12:49] Maybe.

[12:50] I want it to own the game.

[12:51] I don't even want to own the game.

[12:52] I will go to automate it.

[12:53] I will play it on location.

[12:54] I am sure it is fun and fine, but it is not worth owning.

[12:59] The 50th is going to be an improvement over everything.

[13:02] Easy pass.

[13:04] Easy way on September 13th.

[13:06] Hang on to $13,000.

[13:07] Isn't that amazing?

[13:08] It is September 13th and we can all save $13,000.

[13:13] Beetlejuice is going to destroy this.

[13:15] I have seen the new Raza.

[13:17] It is way more exciting than this.

[13:19] This just feels like another stern.

[13:24] That is becoming the punchline of that company and they need to wake up.

[13:29] They need to wake up.

[13:30] I don't think they are going to wake up.

[13:31] Steve Bowden, what are they doing?

[13:34] Why is Steve Bowden invited to stern people?

[13:37] I will tell you why, because he is buddies with Zach Sharp.

[13:41] Is that the visual you want?

[13:42] I am watching this video of John Borg playing and Steve Bowden there just moving around.

[13:48] I am like, it is just so weird to me.

[13:50] Everything matters.

[13:52] How you launch a game matters.

[13:53] Who you invite.

[13:54] They invited all the shills.

[13:56] I was looking at all the people at the media day.

[13:58] You won't recognize any of them.

[14:00] They are not pinball media.

[14:02] These are just shills that are invited by stern who have YouTube followings and none

[14:08] of these people.

[14:10] None of these people built their followings with pinball.

[14:14] It is all ancillary to pinball.

[14:16] Arcade one of people, gaming people, but they are not pinheads.

[14:20] They don't want people like you and me to give honest reviews and honest opinions about

[14:25] these games.

[14:26] To me, it is real simple.

[14:28] Don't run after this game, new and box.

[14:31] This game is easily going to go down in value.

[14:35] It is not going to be hard to find an LE.

[14:37] Finding an LE is not going to mean anything.

[14:40] The pro looks like the way to go.

[14:41] You are not losing that much.

[14:43] And again, it is not even the full spike 3 system.

[14:47] They are going to follow this up with the walking dead.

[14:51] It is just so funny to me watching stern pinball, watching this empire fall.

[14:56] Everybody look.

[14:57] We are at a new period in pinball.

[14:59] You either come out with something that makes you go wow.

[15:02] Like Harry Potter, wowed people.

[15:05] Like the hedgehog is going to wow people.

[15:08] We know that Beetlejuice is going to wow us.

[15:11] They are going to sell 999 in 9 minutes.

[15:14] You are going to be wowed by Raza.

[15:16] There is not that many of them.

[15:17] Those are going to sell out instantly.

[15:19] You are not going to care about Big Bang Bar.

[15:21] You are not caring about Predator.

[15:24] Medieval Madness, the new Merlin Editions are going out.

[15:27] Okay, cool.

[15:28] Looks great.

[15:29] Seen that game 18 times.

[15:30] Don't care anymore.

[15:31] You got to wow us.

[15:32] What stern forgets is that people that love stern, they have great stern machines.

[15:38] They know what stern is capable of.

[15:41] And every new stern launch needs to feel like this is everything we know so far about pinball

[15:47] and it needs to be an improvement.

[15:49] And there is nothing about this game that feels like it justifies the cost.

[15:54] There is nothing about this game that feels ultra creative.

[15:57] There is nothing about this game that says hey, in 2025, this is the best pinball.

[16:03] In the whole universe.

[16:04] It's not.

[16:05] Sturmb pinball now is not making the best pinball anymore.

[16:08] They are looking dated.

[16:10] They are looking recycled and they need a reset.

[16:13] And that is why they need Canada as the CFO.

[16:17] Let's get it done people.

[16:19] Let's get it done.

[16:20] I want to say it has been a really rough week for a lot of us.

[16:24] A lot has happened in the world.

[16:26] A man was assassinated in front of his wife and children.

[16:29] I mean, you got to think about that for a minute.

[16:31] A man is sitting there just having a dialogue with college students and has his neck blown

[16:37] off in front of his wife and two children who are the same age as my two children.

[16:42] Four year old and a one year old with their mother.

[16:45] And I just want to say this.

[16:46] I don't care what side you're on.

[16:48] And I had people saying insensitive things about 9-11.

[16:52] From this community about 9-11, Glenn, whatever his name is, blocked.

[16:57] You mix the lack of creativity and star wars with all the personal stuff, stuff happening

[17:01] in the world that's been very tragic.

[17:03] And it makes it even easier to put everything this week, especially this week.

[17:07] You put everything in perspective and you think about it.

[17:10] What are we doing here?

[17:11] What are we doing here?

[17:12] Where should my efforts be applied?

[17:14] Where should my thoughts and feelings go?

[17:16] And as I see people cheering the assassination of a father, cheering for the assassination

[17:22] of a man.

[17:23] A beautiful young girl from Ukraine stabbed to death on a train 9-11.

[17:30] We're all in need of a reset of humanity and a lot of wave.

[17:34] And I just want to say as I close out this podcast about pinball, life is also happening

[17:39] around us.

[17:40] The world is happening around us.

[17:42] And I think a lot of us are starting to put all of this in a different perspective.

[17:47] And look, pinball is the escape.

[17:49] It's always that.

[17:50] It's always been that for us.

[17:51] And we don't get political and we don't indict people and I respect all people, but we're

[17:56] also people.

[17:57] And this is not a week where I want to buy anything.

[18:00] This is not a week where I would have released anything.

[18:02] And I'm going to say this.

[18:03] Another job of the chief marketing officer is reading the room.

[18:07] They were originally going to reveal the game on September 11th and then out of respect

[18:13] for 9-11.

[18:14] They moved it to Friday.

[18:15] But in the end, in the end, after everything that happened this week, all of the horrific

[18:19] stuff going on, I would have held it.

[18:21] I would have held it.

[18:22] I would have said, you know, it's not the right week.

[18:24] I would have pivoted it.

[18:25] I would have held it.

[18:26] I'm going to put out the teaser so soon, but I just want to say everybody look, life is

[18:31] very short.

[18:32] We have a very finite amount of time and I'm going to tell each and every one of you, do

[18:37] me a favor.

[18:38] If you haven't done this in your life and I mean this and I love each and every one of

[18:41] you and I want you to have a better life, your life will never be better if you buy

[18:47] Star Wars pinball.

[18:49] What will make your life better?

[18:51] And if you haven't done this before and to me, it's the only culture that really

[18:56] reset its humanity and I mean this and we need it.

[19:00] And unfortunately, I'm starting to think like the world is never going to reset itself

[19:05] the right way unless the bomb is dropped again.

[19:08] And the only country that really reset and put the community first instead of the individual

[19:13] is Japan.

[19:15] Now do me a favor, take the money that you are going to use to buy any pinball machine

[19:21] and go to Japan.

[19:24] If you've never been go bring your family, bring your kids, go spend 10 days, split it

[19:31] between Kyoto and Tokyo and really just enjoy what will be the greatest trip of your life,

[19:40] the greatest food of your life, the greatest city of your life, the cleanest city of your

[19:45] life, the best subway of your life, the best trains of your life, the best bite of steak

[19:51] in your life, go to Japan.

[19:54] You know when I think about $13,000 and how that money could alter your life and then

[20:00] I think about this is what they think is worth 13 grand easy pass everybody.

[20:06] Look, I'm thinking about each and every one of you today, not as pinheads but as people.

[20:11] It's been a really rough week and we really need each other and we need a reset.

[20:15] We need a reset.

[20:16] Everyone needs a reset.

[20:18] Society needs a reset and it's not going to happen if we just keep putting our head in

[20:22] the sand and buying products like these where the creativity is not there, the wow factor

[20:28] is not there and I don't care what anybody says, this is not.

[20:33] This is not what Star Wars pinball should be in 2025.

[20:37] Canada out.
