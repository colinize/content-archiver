[00:00] You know, I'm really tired. I'm exhausted. You know, I've been trying to get in pinball podcast in between

[00:06] crazy amounts of work,

[00:08] personal things I've been going through and I turned on the pinball show tonight because I just wanted to hear

[00:14] Zach and Dennis talk about pinball and cover the news and sort of just take my mind off everything else going on in my world

[00:20] But I was also really curious to see how they would cover the Jersey Jack pinball play field issue

[00:26] Because as you know and I know this is a really important issue and making sure that the games were paying a lot of money for

[00:33] Have really good quality and I said in my last show

[00:37] I think the pinball media have a true responsibility to not brush this under the rug to not make light of it

[00:46] To not pretend like it's not news. It is news

[00:50] Collectors editions which we were told would be a better quality than the initial early run are now having the same issues again

[01:01] So I want to just play for you

[01:03] The reason why I think the pinball media and this entire industry is just getting to the point now

[01:09] We're like I've lost kind of interest in it

[01:12] Because you don't get people telling you the truth anymore

[01:16] You don't get people looking out for you in the community

[01:19] It's just people looking out for these companies

[01:22] cheerleading these companies and looking out for their friends and I understand why I get it

[01:28] Your friends with people that work at pinball companies

[01:31] But what I don't get is how you can do a podcast and I mean this Zach you do a podcast in which you say

[01:39] That this isn't really news

[01:41] You're kind of making a little bit light of it

[01:44] But then you say you're not even sure

[01:47] That Jersey Jack officially came out and said the problem was solved

[01:51] Because I want to play for you what Zach said today

[01:54] About the play field issue and listen to how he talks about it

[01:58] How he says it's not really news like and also how they don't really think jjp has ever really

[02:04] Confirmed that they solved the problem a lot of discussion over the forum social media right now have been discussing

[02:11] The collector's edition guns and roses some of the owners are showing some play field chipping again

[02:18] Chipgate chipgate again 3.0

[02:20] Around some of the posts and it's making it rounds again on social media

[02:25] We didn't know that it was happening to the CES I guess I don't know what the the news is here

[02:30] Probably the same issues they were having with the early run standard and ellies or

[02:36] You know the stern was having with theirs or that I guess even

[02:39] 12,500 can't protect you from chipgate

[02:42] That's what people's arguments are and not even

[02:45] I don't know they thought well I think jjp

[02:52] I don't think they ever formally said is resolved. I don't recall hearing that it was fixed

[02:57] But you know all of these companies have always been super cagey about

[03:01] When they what the issue is and when they and when it's been fixed

[03:06] Now there's only one problem with that and Zach and Dennis saying that they never said the problem was resolved

[03:12] And they've been super cagey about all this the only problem with that

[03:16] Is that jersey jack actually did tell us

[03:20] Way back

[03:20] December 28th right before the collector's editions were going on the line

[03:26] They did confirm for us that the problem was fixed and the other problem is the place they confirmed it for us

[03:34] Was on

[03:35] Zach's show when Zach interviewed Ken Cromwell now you tell me did Zach forget that Ken said this let me play that clip

[03:44] I can your best friend. I love you buddy, but um, I'm gonna ask I have to ask a lot of new pinball machines

[03:50] In the last couple years I've been in

[03:52] I've been showing some clear coat issues on play fields

[03:55] Is jersey jack aware of any play field issues that have happened on any of their titles before and are they doing what they can do to

[04:03] Remedy any issues that do oh sure. I mean for my I think of myself right because I'm a collector and

[04:09] I'm an enthusiast and when I get a game the games cost a lot of money

[04:13] And I'm probably one of the people that really go over my game with with a fine comb so to speak

[04:19] I'm looking for any imperfections. I have a very very picky so when something like that arises

[04:24] I can put myself in anybody's shoes and you think to yourself

[04:26] All right, I want to make sure that that this isn't something that I need to be concerned about with my game

[04:31] So I can confidently say that like any isolated issues that have been brought to our attention or our currently happening are have been or are being addressed

[04:40] Okay, we obviously care about the quality of the play fields and the games and and exceeding the expectations of the customers

[04:46] Is what we want to do we want we don't want to just come in and meet expectations

[04:49] We want to exceed those those expectations

[04:52] But I want people know I carry about like the same exact things that our buyers care about

[04:56] So none of that gets swept under the rug where I totally respect your question and

[05:01] I don't blame you for asking it. I can confidently say that everything's good to go

[05:04] Everything is good to go that sounds like a confirmation from Jersey Jack that the play field issues have been resolved

[05:11] Let's hear those two statements quickly together because I think just the last two parts put together of

[05:18] Zach saying

[05:20] That Jersey Jack has never sent anything about this and then is saying like they're cagey about it

[05:26] And then Ken saying we never put it under the carpet and we're confidently here to say we're good to go

[05:32] I don't think they ever formally said

[05:34] Is resolved I don't recall hearing that it was fixed no either

[05:37] But you know all of these companies have always been super cagey about

[05:41] When they what the issue is and when they and when it's been fixed

[05:46] So none of that gets swept under the rug where I totally respect your question and

[05:50] I don't blame you for asking it. I can confidently say that everything's good to go

[05:54] Look, we don't want Kineated to start doing journalism in the pinball podcasting world and look I understand what's going on here

[06:01] I understand that Zach and Ken are friends and this is a real nightmare situation for Jersey Jack pinball

[06:08] And the only reason I bring this stuff up and the only reason I bring attention to it is I just think we need to stop

[06:14] We need to stop trying to have all this revisionist history

[06:17] We need to stop blaming customers. We need to stop acting like what's happening isn't happening

[06:23] And I think we need to all get together and figure out a solution to this problem

[06:28] And this doesn't help though it doesn't help when we do pinball shows and we sort of ignore it

[06:34] Or we say we're not sure that they ever said the problem was fixed and make light of it and say it's not news

[06:39] Because it is news and there's people that are spending

[06:42] $12,500 on games and they're looking down at their game tonight and they're all bummed out

[06:49] And I'm telling you right now there is no solution that anyone has in place yet

[06:53] And so what I'm hoping comes out of this is a few things

[06:58] I'm hoping and I am hoping that this might just be an issue that those of us who have guns and roses machines that have issues

[07:07] You might have to live with it and I mean that you might just have to live with it because the reality of swapping out your play field for a better one

[07:15] Is not a likely reality

[07:18] Nobody wants to see Jersey Jack pinball go under

[07:21] I'm friends with Ken I'm friends with Eric I'm friends with people over that company

[07:27] But they need to figure a solution out and it's been three times in a row now

[07:31] But the other thing they need to do is this they can't go radio silent

[07:36] This has been happening now for years. This isn't just an isolated incident on a couple games

[07:42] This is happening over and over and over again

[07:45] And what they also need to do is they need to have a standard

[07:49] Communication to everybody because I already heard as of today

[07:53] Jack is calling people up

[07:55] Personally and asking them what can he do for them?

[07:59] But that's not a solution

[08:01] You can't go one by one by one and offer different solutions to people

[08:07] You can't offer one person washers the next person a play field the next person might get a refund

[08:13] The next person might get a fully populated play field because that's gonna blow up in their face too

[08:18] Because you have to have a standard of giving all of your customers

[08:24] equal

[08:25] quality

[08:26] Equal assurance that if something goes wrong, they're all going to be taken care of the same way

[08:33] And I really hope they figured this out. I hope they figured this out

[08:37] But I also hope the pinball media out there just take a little bit more responsibility that this isn't a joke

[08:43] This isn't news item and you heard it on your own shows act that they said the problem was solved

[08:51] And I believe them and everybody believe them and that's why people are having such a big issue now

[08:58] And that's why this needs to be more of a news item and taken more seriously

[09:03] And I know you could pull up a bunch of my shows in which I say things incorrectly

[09:07] And I do say things incorrectly

[09:09] And I do sometimes change my mind on things and I do sometimes forget what I say

[09:15] But this this is this is something that we have to get right and we can't brush this under the rug

[09:21] And canada might be wrong and rumors news and speculation at times

[09:25] But just remember that I might not have as many friends in this hobby as other people on the airwaves

[09:33] And I might not know people inside these companies

[09:36] And they might want to protect those relationships more than anything else because that access to those friendships means a lot

[09:44] They also might want to sell you games and that's important. They can't lose that

[09:48] But I'm here to tell you right now

[09:50] I all this could go away and the only thing I'm really here to do for this podcast and since day one

[09:57] Is keep these companies honest we're spending a lot of money on these games the quality should be there

[10:03] The mechanisms should be there the magic should be there and nobody's putting more magic into their games than Jersey jack pinball

[10:11] And that is why people aren't such pain over this they buy your games to collect

[10:18] They buy your games to hold on to forever

[10:21] They don't want to look down and see these issues and I need a solution

[10:26] Your customers need a solution and for the pinball media out there we need to

[10:32] Band together on this and not not criminalize anybody

[10:36] And it's not exact fault. It's not Ken's fault

[10:39] I know they want their things to be you know of high quality over a Jersey jack pinball

[10:44] But we just need to stop saying like it's not news

[10:47] We need to stop saying that Jersey jack never said the problem was solved because they did

[10:52] And we've got to hold them to that and guess what they need to hit stop on the production line probably

[10:57] Until they have a solution to keep making games when you know

[11:02] You haven't solved it yet because clearly you haven't because we're seeing it again on the cees

[11:07] That's where I have an issue

[11:08] That's where we all should have an issue and and I want to buy every single Jersey jack game

[11:13] I want to buy toy story. I want to buy the matrix. I hope it's the matrix

[11:17] But you know what I mean, but we just can't have this we just can't have

[11:22] You know the pinball media protecting

[11:25] Protecting the companies over the customers. That's not the way it should be

[11:28] All right, everybody. No music. It's so late. I'm so tired. I gotta go to bed

[11:34] Peace
