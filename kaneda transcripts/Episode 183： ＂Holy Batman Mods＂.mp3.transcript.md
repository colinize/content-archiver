[00:00] Play that song, the one that makes me go all night long,

[00:07] The one that makes me think of you, that's all you gotta do.

[00:22] Welcome to Episode 183 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:27] I'm your host, Canada. Happy to be here in the driver's seat.

[00:31] The only person on planet Earth in possession of the Stern coffee table book.

[00:37] And let me tell you something. It's everything you anticipated to be and more.

[00:43] I hope you guys get it one day soon. It's the greatest coffee table book I've ever seen.

[00:47] On this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast, we are going to talk a little bit about

[00:51] Guardians of the Galaxy feedback that I got from you guys.

[00:55] We're going to talk about what's going on at some of the other manufacturers.

[00:59] We're also going to close the loop a little bit on all the different deep root news

[01:04] that's been circling the hobby.

[01:07] But I want to jump in at the beginning of this podcast by saying,

[01:12] I probably had one of the best days ever in all of pinball this Saturday.

[01:18] And I want to walk you through my Saturday.

[01:20] So I wake up, it's about eight o'clock in the morning.

[01:24] And I'm staring at all these boxes in my room.

[01:27] And it's all these mods for Batman 66.

[01:30] And I said to Brenda, I said, babe, I'm going to get a car and I'm going to go drive one place.

[01:36] I'm going to go drive to Cointaker in Pennsylvania, in Sunbury, PA.

[01:43] And I'm going to put these mods into a Batman game.

[01:47] And we're going to get this ball rolling.

[01:50] And I texted Chris and I said, hey man, how about today?

[01:54] Can I swing by? And he said, absolutely.

[01:56] And so I left here, took about three hours in chains to get there.

[02:01] I was driving, I wasn't driving the Hellcat.

[02:04] I made the ride there in the Hellcat in like two hours.

[02:06] It took me about three hours in a Volkswagen Golf to get to the Cointaker sort of warehouse showroom.

[02:14] It's under construction. I got there on 1130.

[02:19] Chris and I worked on putting mods into a game all the way up until about like seven o'clock at night.

[02:29] Maybe a little bit early, I left around like 630.

[02:31] But that'll just give you a sense of what we did to this game.

[02:36] Now I'm not going to tell you which edition of Batman I got, it's not really that important.

[02:41] They're all the same, right? You'll see it soon enough.

[02:44] I will reveal all of it to the world.

[02:46] I want you guys to see it with everything in it that I put in the game.

[02:51] But the reason I went to Cointaker, and the reason I wanted to sort of hang out with Chris,

[02:55] partially because I wanted to give him a bottle of whiskey as an apology for all the crap we went through recently.

[03:02] It's all under the bridge. He's the nicest guy.

[03:05] I mean, we're two sort of pig headed dudes sometimes.

[03:11] And I'm so glad that all that's behind us.

[03:15] I also want it access to all of his amazing pinball tools and pinball expertise because for those of you out there,

[03:24] when you're modding a pinball machine, and I think I speak for a lot of people in this hobby that are sort of casually into pinball

[03:31] and aren't super familiar with a machine itself.

[03:35] And I'm one of those people. I mean, you asked me to solder a part of a game,

[03:40] and all of a sudden I'm like, there's hot solder dripping all over the place.

[03:43] I don't really understand how to do it and do it well.

[03:47] And I think a lot of people out there, when it comes to taking your games apart,

[03:51] it's not always an enjoyable journey.

[03:54] You do learn a lot. Like you learn a ton.

[03:57] But the main thing that we were going to put into this Batman 66 was a play field protector.

[04:03] And I wanted to put one of those great play field protectors that comes from Germany into the machine on day one,

[04:10] partially because if you do that, you'll never have any dimples in the game.

[04:16] And I hear people, some people like them, some people don't.

[04:20] I don't really care. I'm not making this machine for tournament use.

[04:25] If the game plays a little bit slower, I'm probably never going to notice it.

[04:29] And putting a play field protector into Batman 66 requires some disassembly of the game.

[04:35] You have to take out both of the ramps. You have to take off some switches.

[04:39] You've got to sort of loosen the flaps where the ramps are.

[04:44] I said ramps like the habit trails. You got to take those off.

[04:47] So there's some assembly required.

[04:50] And I'll say between Chris and I, it took about a good hour and a half to sort of get this thing stripped down and getting the play field protector in.

[05:02] And it's not easy. It seems a lot easier when you look at the pin-side photos.

[05:07] But in actuality, there's a lot of like nervous moments where you're sort of pulling at or bending the play field protector to fit into like the upper orbits and getting them over the crane.

[05:19] And all that stuff. So we spent a while just doing that.

[05:23] You got to remove the flipper badge. You got to do all this stuff.

[05:26] And look, I haven't disassembled flipper bats before. I haven't done all this stuff.

[05:31] I was watching Chris do it. I was learning how to do it.

[05:34] But that was just the beginning. That was just the tip of the iceberg.

[05:37] When we were done with that, then we moved on to all the other mods that I brought with me.

[05:43] And it was just like this big sort of magic box of parts. Everything from the mod couples, you know, the new bat phone to the atomic pile.

[05:54] I'm trying to think I've got like the Eagle Moss helicopter. I've got Eagle Moss figures. I've got all this stuff.

[06:02] Now, I say this when you put in like the atomic pile, you've got to do the, you know, disconnect the connectors inside that big rotating mac.

[06:11] And luckily for me, I've got tiny hands. I got really small hands.

[06:15] But that doesn't mean I have everything small. No. So it was great.

[06:19] And I think the thing too that was awesome about doing it at CoinTaker is whenever you're taking a game apart.

[06:25] Do you ever have that moment where you look down at the table and there's, you're like, yeah, I'll totally remember where all this stuff goes.

[06:31] And then you look down and there's just like 25 screws and washers and nuts and all these things are everywhere.

[06:39] I usually try to take photos and label stuff and, you know, but, but luckily for us, luckily for us, when we went to put everything back together, the godsent is that we were right next to another Batman 66.

[06:53] So if we ever were confused, we could simply walk over and look at what was there and put it back in.

[07:00] One of the things that we changed, which just makes the game look so much better is we took out all of the black rubbers and posts and, and slings and, and everything that was like a black rubber or post became purple.

[07:14] It looks so much better. The color scheme goes much, much nicer with, with the game itself. So long story short, we wrap it up, we slit a piece of Stern's anti-glair glass.

[07:28] And I got to be honest, I didn't really, didn't really seem as, as good as the PDI glass that I have. So I might swap that out with the PDI glass that's in my tails of the Arabian Knights.

[07:39] But when we were finally done, an entire day spent working on a pinball machine. It was so satisfying.

[07:46] And I just want to say, thank you so much to Chris. Thank you so much to Melissa. Thank you so much to CoinTaker. They have a really amazing facility.

[07:55] And what's cool about when you go into the warehouse, it's just this unassuming building from the road. There's not even a sign-up yet. He's working on all this stuff.

[08:04] But you open up the door, and there's just rows and rows of pinball machines. And that's how it should be when you go to buy a pinball game.

[08:13] There should be like 6 to 10 to 12 games lined up, and you can spend all the time you want playing them, and then decide which game is for you.

[08:24] Which game do you want in your house? It's really, really an impressive facility. And I can't say enough for those of you out there.

[08:31] If you're anywhere near Sunbury P.A. It's definitely worth a trip to see all the great machines they have there, and to pick up a game or two if you want.

[08:42] So again, Chris, thank you so much. The date at which Batman 66 will enter my home is going to be sooner than later.

[08:51] I'm hoping to do it possibly this Friday, maybe Monday.

[08:55] So this is all really exciting, exciting times for me. Remember, I've been living solely with a magic girl machine that doesn't work.

[09:04] So I am super giddy to finally get a working pinball machine. Speaking of Batman 66, I keep hearing from people over there.

[09:14] We're at code 0.83, and I keep hearing from multiple people over there that the code is you haven't seen anything yet.

[09:22] I know George Gomez said that, but other people have said there are so much more that's going to be going into this machine that I think Batman 66.

[09:31] And this isn't me showing the game. All right, others are saying this. I think there's going to be a late run on this machine.

[09:38] I think this machine is going to be one of those that was a ginormous disappointment at launch. It had a horrible first year.

[09:46] It's going to end up being a great pin. And I think it's going to go down in history as one of Stern's greatest theme integrated pins.

[09:54] And I think because this machine is sort of like Stern's 30th anniversary, the 50th anniversary of Batman, I do feel that there is a passion and a commitment to make this game go down as one of Stern's best games ever.

[10:10] Some people out there might not like the shots. I get it. I get it. But Lyman Sheets and George Gomez and the folks at Stern, I think they're going to put everything and then some into this game.

[10:24] I mean, I kind of feel like I'm a little bit of a testament to that or I'm the world's biggest hypocrite. You could decide which one I am.

[10:31] But I went from being so down on this machine to going to play it with code.81 walking away saying I need to have one.

[10:40] And what I like about this machine is not just the incredible theme integration compared to everything else coming out now. It seems like one of the best theme integrations ever.

[10:49] What I like about it is simply from a collector standpoint, is there aren't that many if you go in on an LE or an SLE.

[10:59] This is like not 800, not 600, not 400. So they are still quite rare too. So it has that special element too that if you're a collector, you don't really see them come up for sale very often.

[11:12] Now speaking of that, someone just listed their Batman Super LE on Pinside for sale for 15,500. So if you're in the market for one, there's one there.

[11:27] Now I do know of a Batman LE that is still new in box that is for sale. And if you would like more information on that machine and where to go for it, you can email me at

[11:39] www.cunyativepimbal.com. But very excited. I hope you can hear it in my voice. I'm sort of coming out of my zidware depression and learning that, you know, Pimbal can actually work and you can enjoy it.

[11:52] Alright, what else is going on in news? So Stern, Guardians of the Galaxy Feedback.

[11:59] Sorry, I'm coming out a little bit of a cold. I asked you guys to email me whether or not you thought Guardians of the Galaxy would be a hit or a miss.

[12:09] And I got about like a thousand listeners. I got two to three responses. Partially because I'm trying to think why. I mean, maybe it's just like CanadianPimbal at gmail.com is really difficult to spell.

[12:22] Maybe it's because I don't always read out enough consumer feedback or have like a mail section. You know, we're going to the mailbox. I don't do that on this show. So maybe people don't really care. But let me read the responses I did get because if you do send me a response, I'm going to read it. I said I was going to read it and let's read some of them right now.

[12:43] Alright, so Joe Perino said, talk about the worst callouts ever. I feel like when one guy has an idea at Stern, everybody just goes, oh yeah, that's a great idea instead of being honest.

[12:59] I mean, you take voice actors and you repeat the lines from the movies. It sounds so terrible. I know it's really early code, but the screen is just as bad. All they're showing is movie clips. I'm just super glad I bought a dialed in. Good choice on Batman, bro. That game is a lot of fun. Well, Joe, thank you for the response. It's definitely early on in the Guardians code. And it's hard, right?

[13:26] We're going to talk a little bit about this after I go through all the feedback. But let me read everyone's feedback. And then I want to sort of summarize, I think the commonality of what people are saying. So I also got an email from Zach over at the straight down the middle pinball show. Love the show, Zach, Zach, thank you for writing in. He writes, I went in with tempered expectations regarding game playing code. People are freaking out about callouts while I'm over here having a blast playing it.

[13:56] Tough shots blazing fast, plenty of modes and things to do. Multi-balls difficulty getting to wizard mode, exceptional art package and beautiful LCD video. Will it be a hit for once? I don't care. Right. So he's saying he's loving it. He doesn't really care. People don't think it's going to be a hit or not.

[14:16] I also thought it was interesting that Zach said like he thought the LCD screen was beautiful. And yet our previous reviewer said they didn't like the LCD at all. And I think it just goes to show that everything we review for the most part in pinball is 100% subjective. All right.

[14:34] I got a nice email from Simon over in the UK. Simon, thank you for listening to his pinball podcast. He goes by the boxer. He writes quick analysis, lovely artwork, shoots smooth. It can't really fail being a Metallica Ironman clone music call out steam integration at the moment. It is a confusing totally lackluster cohesion. Marvel actors are a total miss code. Oh boy.

[15:03] It's a copy of Erasmith, which is a copy of kiss. It's really similar to Erasmith. No way would I want both games. And of course we will be waiting and waiting to know when if it will be finished and quality control.

[15:18] No board issues and there is no reason on planet earth to buy a premium or Ellie now wait, wait, wait. But pro will probably do well on location, which is why they are built as who cares if it ain't perfect. If just chucking a few bucks in it.

[15:33] But with zero originality or anything special for collectors or players, I see nothing to suggest anything other than an average run of the mill title better to wait for a virus three with lineman or iron maiden.

[15:46] L win question mark or buy total nuclear annihilation now with linear rules gives longevity though dialed in is just me and is it just me that it seems overrated as the humor is so dry as and the theme so weak see you later.

[16:05] Okay, so Simon, thank you. I'm sorry. I mean guys like sometimes I butch maybe people don't write in or email me because I can't read. I'm always I'm sorry. I'm like I'm sitting here like I'm looking down and sometimes like people might have a grammar mistake.

[16:18] And then I just get hung up on stuff. Okay, so I kind of am with the boxer on this one. I think guardians of the galaxy. I think there was, you know, there was like mediocre hype around it.

[16:32] I wasn't like the same hype that surrounded Star Wars and I think people were curious to see what was going to happen with guardians of the galaxy. I think where we're at now is that the game is beautiful.

[16:44] I think Stern has learned its lesson with art packages and for the most part we're going to get some really pretty games from from Mr. Franchie from dirty Donnie from zombie Eddie.

[16:54] I think the layout was very familiar people I'd seen it before. You know, I don't think there was anything in it that was just like wow like felt like completely new.

[17:03] So you couple that with the theme that doesn't really emotionally grip the demographic of pinball and then you sort of have no songs originally then you just add two songs and you've got the voice actor issue.

[17:20] You know, it's just really hard to know what this game will end up being and I think people are just tired of being there right. It's I don't know if the game is going to be that good or not.

[17:33] There's no urgency and I think that's the big thing. Stern was spoiled by having a lot of people run after Ghostbusters, run after Batman, you know, run after Star Wars.

[17:45] They must have known from day one like the distributor lists of names for people waiting for Star Wars far exceeded the 800 Elise that they were going to make.

[17:55] You know, Star Wars again, Lukewarm sort of release still not the game that's like blown people away, but people are having fun with it.

[18:03] You can play Star Wars in a mostly complete game and make up your mind on it. So I think Garden to the Galaxy coming out with such a spartan code is going to really struggle.

[18:16] I think to ever get traction or win people over and I think a lot of you guys agree and I think the biggest mistake that I've said this before is there's absolutely no reason to get the limited edition.

[18:28] There's not a feature that's limited, there's not a top or that's like limited, there's not an armor package that's limited, there's not artwork that feels better than the pro artwork.

[18:40] So they literally have made a limited edition that just doesn't feel very special.

[18:47] And whenever you're in that game of like trying to tailor a product for the collector community, you need to go further now and we're seeing that.

[18:56] We're seeing, you know, Jersey Jack go further with what he's putting into his collector's editions.

[19:01] You know, so if you want to play the Ellie game and not everybody does and I understand why they don't, but if you want to play the Ellie game, you got to play it right.

[19:10] And I think Stern, I think Stern's whole Ellie strategy is starting to backfire big time and I don't think 600 guardians of the galaxy Ellie's are going to move.

[19:23] And I think that WWE armor is still going to be hanging out in this Stern factory for a long, long time that they're not going to get rid of it.

[19:33] It's like, it's like the curse of the WWE armor, anything you put it on is going to sit around for a long time.

[19:40] Other Stern news right now, more and more speculation about the Walking Dead Vault Edition.

[19:47] The reason why is we just saw a code update, right? What code update?

[19:51] I thought Lyman was only working on Batman 66. What is he doing making code updates for the Walking Dead?

[19:57] But he just made one and it's a nice update. And it's incredible that he continues to polish the Walking Dead. He is the savior of the Walking Dead.

[20:06] And it's nice to know that Lyman in his own time continues to look at his projects as never finished, that there's always a little bit more that can make these games special.

[20:17] And I think that's great.

[20:18] As far as the Walking Dead being the next Vault Edition for Stern machines, I will just say that speculating about the next Vault Edition is an exercise in futility.

[20:29] Everyone is always wrong and everyone is always right. No one really knows. Nobody has really called it accurately.

[20:37] And it's even hard to determine what a Vault Edition even is, right? Because was Batman 66 a Vault of the Dark Knight?

[20:46] No, that was like a re-themed. Spider-Man was at a Vault Edition. They called it a Vault Edition, but it was all new sculptures and new artwork and new dots.

[20:57] So, you know, they changed the focus of Spider-Man from the movie back to the comic book.

[21:03] And that is what the rumor is for the Walking Dead that it will go from being about the show to about the comic book the Walking Dead.

[21:10] Some people are saying, well, they have to redo the dots. And other people are saying, no, the dots are very...

[21:16] They already look cartoonish to begin with, so they won't have to do that. So there's a high possibility of that.

[21:22] A lot of people are still calling for Lord of the Rings to be the next Vault Edition. Tron, how many years are we going to hear about Tron Vault Edition?

[21:30] How many years? By the time it happens, no one's going to care. No one's going to care.

[21:35] I think the only thing that would make Tron cool, I wouldn't Vault Edition it, I would make a new Tron Machine based on the original movie with an LCD and just redo the game.

[21:49] We know that Tron is a theme that people love. I would make the cabinet look more like the arcade machine cabinet.

[21:56] Imagine that, like all black, the neon colors and black lights and all that stuff to light it up so that when you put it next to a Tron arcade cabinet, it looked like that.

[22:07] Can you imagine that big beam in the middle, that's in the upper part of the arcade cabinet that you're always staring at? How cool would that be?

[22:17] And you could make it now with an LCD that you could actually have a video mode where you actually start playing the classic Tron arcade game as part of the pinball machine.

[22:28] How cool would that be if you went into a scoop that was sort of a fling arcade and you go into it and then you start playing the classic arcade game?

[22:38] I mean people don't realize the ability now to integrate video game playing with pinball playing in the right kind of way with the integration of LCD and pinball is so untapped.

[22:52] We're just seeing the beginnings of that integration.

[22:55] Alright, so let's move on to home pin. So there is a rumor going around. I just wanted to spell this rumor that Mike was going on to Aussie arcade as another user who was pretending to be someone else and he was posting stuff.

[23:13] And that was sort of like debunked and then people went on and said that that was actually me, that it was Canadian going on and somehow I found this roundabout way to make it look like I was using a VPN that was from a Starbucks in China.

[23:28] I don't even know what the story is. I just want to set the story straight. I am done with home pin. I don't care enough about home pin to follow them.

[23:39] I don't care about their updates. I know all I need to know about Mike from what Mike has said. I don't support them. I wish them the best of luck.

[23:51] I think they have a tremendous uphill battle. I think they created their own PR crisis. I don't think the game is any good. I don't think it's worth anyone's wild to care.

[24:04] I think Mike has been through a lot. I think he shoots from the hip. I think he says stuff before he thinks. And I think he is going to learn the hard way that pinball is a very small community and people need want to rally around and they want to support people that they like that you don't create a business with animosity and with threats and with sort of bold,

[24:32] bold, branch behavior. If I was trying to create my own pinball company, I don't think I would have much support because of how polarizing of a figure I was.

[24:45] But I think I've become better. I think I have some redeeming qualities. So I just want to say that I think if anyone is going to bring Mike down it's going to be Mike. It's not going to be me and being an imposter or trolling him. I have no involvement in anything going on with home pin.

[25:01] All right. All right. American pinball. Who Dini is on location and it is in Chicago. It's not in Chicago. Chicago. No, it's not even in Chicago. It's in Shao. I don't even have to say the Shao.

[25:16] It's not in the city of Chicago. It is quite a distance away from downtown Chicago. This is good news. We're happy to see who Dini out on location. I believe this is where Jack put dialed in as well for testing.

[25:36] The fact that who Dini's are out there there in the wild, it means we're one step closer for machines to ship to consumers. Exciting news. Exciting news. I still think the big question marks I have are just around how much production can they do on a weekly basis.

[25:54] I do think this game needs to get into consumer hands before the holidays. People are caching in some of those holiday bonuses and what better way than to have a new pinball machine from a new company shipped to your home.

[26:09] I'm not even clear like how they're going to do distribution because there's a lot of distributors that are carrying American pinball products and it's going to be all over the place.

[26:19] I mean who they're going to I don't know how allocation is going to work at all. So I don't know like what number you know you are. You just won't. And I think that could create some issues with people getting impatient with them.

[26:34] I think it would be nice if you knew what number you were. But as we know it's always hard for these games to be built in order for some reason.

[26:42] But we want to say congrats to getting the game out there. The only issue I've been hearing is like sometimes the ball goes straight down the middle.

[26:51] Everything can be adjusted on a game. So I'm sure they'll figure that part out. And that's why it's out there for testing. Okay, because to catch feedback like this as well.

[27:02] Speaking of out there. Have you guys seen on eBay lately the amount of cactus canions that are popping up for sale. I saw it in the last week three mint beautiful cactus canion continues or continued up there on eBay.

[27:20] It is indicative of the reality of the remake part of the hobby. People who own a cactus canyon and a monster bash right now are freaking out.

[27:31] They are freaking out because especially the cactus canyon people because cactus canyon they made a lot less of them than monster bash. It's really hard to find one in beautiful condition.

[27:43] The ones that are in beautiful condition are worth a lot of money. Right anywhere they were going anywhere from like 12 to $15,000 for a while. I think one sold like new in box for almost $20,000 a year or two ago if I remember correctly.

[27:57] If they remake this game with new software a great topper and brand new brand new you know you're and then they sell it for like attack from Mars prices or $8,000.

[28:10] Good buy your $14,000 or $12,000 machine because the problem is when they remake it brand new I mean that almost negates even these like hepp restored machines I get it I hear the hepp people being like hepp makes it better than you and that's probably true.

[28:28] But I also believe when you hepp a machine you then don't want to go play a machine because it's going to take a beating it's it's the problem when you over restore a pinball machine and then you kind of don't want to use it.

[28:41] That was one of the reasons why I put a play field protector on Batman is I just want to play it I don't want to worry about dimples and chips and all this stuff so I can just throw play field protector on and play it and have fun and then when I'm done with that play field protector I can just pull it up and put a new one in and game look brand new.

[28:57] Why don't people just do that if if they're OCD about play field issues so it's fun to see people speculating on what's going to be next I thought for short was going to be monster bash then people are telling me it's going to be cactus Canyon I'll tell you because these three appeared all at once I am going to change my prediction I think it's going to be cactus Canyon first I think so because I feel like this stuff happened.

[29:26] This stuff happens when people tip off when they tip off their friends who have these high end collections on which game they should probably dump right about now and usually that comes from people who are working on the remakes the other game that I'm hearing you know we heard about king pin I'm also hearing big bang bar is on the table for another remake as well so if you have a big bang bar and you want to get big bang bucks for it you probably should sell it right now right now.

[29:55] All right now should you know I'm looking at magic girl and I want to talk I want to end this show with deep route because I got a lot of people emailing me saying like what are your thoughts on deep route like come on like Chris like go further into what what they've said they had a new update today on this week in pinball which by the way I mean I can't give Jeff enough shout outs for this website this week in pinball now we're going to be able to do that.

[30:25] He's got his Twippy awards this guy to me this guy to me has done something that I never thought would be possible he's made it absolutely irrelevant going to pin side every day I mean you go you go to pin side like the discussions normally like all this drama back and forth the club the club threads are great on pin side but for those of us in the pinball media for those of us who do podcasts for those of us who have been in the game

[30:55] you have to like go find the news this guy is like our ultimate resource in fact he might put all of us pinball podcasters at a business because you don't need to go to me anymore to find out what the news is because you can get it all right from him now the difference is this is you're going to get more of a point of view on the podcast versus his site.

[31:18] And for example I reached out to Robert from deep root pinball and he said he'd come on my show remember I said I wasn't going to go too deep into it I want to see if he would talk at first he said sure I'll do the show Chris and then he got back to me and said he wasn't going to do the show and something you know I don't want to read what he wrote word for word because I think that was personal communication but just basically saying that

[31:47] you know after listening to my podcast you didn't really see the benefit he's not really into PR spin. He kind of said one thing that he said that I'll just call out was that illusions of arrogance and stupidity are very useful tools that you know people are sort of ragging on them and then I'm right you know I'm calling them like are they naive are they stupid is it ego everyone speculating and I'm going to get it all right.

[32:17] You know Robert sort of saying like what will use that to our advantage and the way look at this whole thing right because when I looked at the first time American or this week in pinball cover the news you got to look at the headlines it's john pop it is back is the headline now I would argue that john pop it is in back I would argue that john pop it you never went away I would argue that john pop it you.

[32:44] Being back or being gone or being whatever john pop it is supposed to be for this hobby is irrelevant I think everyone at this point right now is just sort of beyond the myth of john pop it you.

[32:59] And as an owner of magic girl because only like 19 of us or 20 of us have magic girls only at handful of us are able to lift up the play field and see what john pop it you created over a five year period I want to talk about that for a second because and I'll get back to deep rooted in a minute or two.

[33:21] But the whole reason why people are so enamored by zidware and john pop a duke and what he'd been sort of you know slowly revealing over the years was because he put in front of people what is still the most beautiful looking pinball machine of all time and that is all because of zombie Eddie it's all because of mad Andrews but if you actually did this if you actually stripped all of that from the game.

[33:48] And you just stared at a white wood of magic girl and you started flipping it you would realize immediately that john pop a duke isn't magical that john pop a duke doesn't know how to make a pinball machine it's it's that laughable when it comes to the mechanisms and the geometry within the game.

[34:10] Now of course he hit all that by creating a mountain of beautiful artwork that rises all the way up almost to the glass of the machine itself and the center mechanism looks like the most amazing mechanism in all pinball it even blocks half of the screen and none of it really works you see it's all this illusion this deception of of there's greatness there you just can't find it.

[34:35] And so you know we're back into the storyline of john pop a duke again right and and you know people are people like just don't even know what to think.

[34:47] And I'll say this I'll say this because I don't want to go down the same road with deep route that I did with Andrew highway and highway pinball and I'll tell you why and I want to explain why.

[35:00] I went after Andrew highway and highway pinball in in in very targeted way because Andrew highway was taking a lot of money from people he was taking a lot of money for people he was making promises to those people and then he wasn't delivering he was stalling and as 2016 2017 progressed Andrew highway was going to take a lot more money from people potentially losing.

[35:29] Hundreds of thousands of dollars from new buyers if he wasn't exposed okay the he would have sunk that company deeper and deeper and deeper into dead which would have made the investors more and more unlikely to bail it out and exposing him for what he was doing it was necessary and it was the right thing to do okay people were going to lose money.

[35:55] Deep route pinball hasn't taken anyone's money they are partnering with john pop a duke now you could argue that they're absorbing his debts or his responsibilities to get games to zidware customers and they are they are jumping into the zidware ring like it is ww w dot zidware that dash deep route dot com I mean this isn't you know this isn't like an American who do you play American who do you American pinball play remember American pinball it was like.

[36:24] Zidware cabinets but they removed the zidware name and they were really trying to sort of distance themselves from zidware deep route is a complete opposite they are basically you know their mission is to bring zidware's games to life and to fruition but no one has pre ordered any of these new games if you pre ordered a zidware game from john pop a duke their mission is to make you whole now you've read the terms and conditions of how they're going to do that.

[36:54] You've read the language they've decided to use to build confidence in the company now what do I think about it all what do I think about it all I you know what I don't want to get to involved and I'll tell you for the following reasons Robert and his team are you know they're on their mission these are men who clearly have a desire to sort of prove everyone wrong by any means necessarily.

[37:24] They're also men with money and legal powers and legal abilities and I don't care to be in the middle of a stressful like legal battle with a pinball company that I don't even want to buy a game from.

[37:38] I've seen people go too far in terms of slandering and saying how you know poor they think a company is and you know it's impossible for not to get too personal and look I do I think they're going to succeed right now with no manufacturing background with john at the helm of design with the company.

[38:08] You know it's it's it's not looking great it's not looking great they they have two years basically to prove people wrong and that's a long period of time I know that they've been trying to hire people in the industry they clearly have assembled some people to work for for them the black night chimed in and he knows a lot of people in this industry and he's saying that a lot of people have decided not to work with them.

[38:38] You know I can tell by the tactics of deep route that they're not going to be for everybody that they will probably get people to work for them probably because the money's good I don't but I just for the life of me I just have a hard time feeling that the origins of the organization come from passion right come from the desire to make pinball great.

[39:07] You know when you read on their website it's like every family needs a pinball I just I you know I read that and then I read a website that's full of legal speak and plaintiffs and testimonies and people are lying and spend like this has nothing to do with pinball it has nothing to do with what this hobby should be about.

[39:31] And I was the first and I you know person to run towards the drama run towards John's promises run towards John's lies and I got burned lots of people got burned it's not an enjoyable place to be and it can easily destroy your ability to enjoy this hobby.

[39:55] Bubba is barking I don't know why Bubba I will be there in a second we're wrapping this up Bubba so in closing you know deep route whether you like it or not is now part of this hobby and nobody knows what the outcome will be but let's not focus on two years from now you don't even know where your health is going to be in two years there's so much good pinball to enjoy here and now.

[40:25] And I think two years from now again I've been saying on this podcast all along I've always had there's going to be less pinball manufacturers and two years not more.

[40:35] And if they can pull a rabbit out of a hat and they can make it work then so be it then so be it and it'll be up to you the pinball buyer to decide whether or not you want to go in on it.

[40:49] Okay but I'm not going to I'm not going to go on any crusade after deep route I'm just not I'm actually just trying to get rid of magic girl I want it to be in in the home of a collector who's got a lot of pinball machines because that's where magic girl belongs it doesn't belong in my apartment where I can only have one game.

[41:10] So I think all of us have will realize this like when you remove yourself from the negative side of the hobby you'll enjoy it it's a toy and I I think less is more like the less machines you have the better like all these people just like hoarding machines like need all this like life is better when it's simpler and and that's that's how I'm approaching it even if I had all this room.

[41:36] You know when I had all these arcade machines barely turn them on you barely play but you have one you really appreciate it you play the hell out of it get rid of it and then get a new one play the hell out of it beat it get a new one and just rotate through it.

[41:49] No one's impressed because you have 10 pinball machines or 20 pinball machines and you know you might think your friends are impressed but they're really not they're like this guy's got something wrong with him anyway now that's you know God bless you guys you have big collections I you know some of my best friends have big collections and

[42:04] you know I wish I had their their checking accounts as well. That's it that's episode one I believe 83 will be back we're going to get some interviews going soon I'm going to go on the head to head pinball at some point I know they they did a mocking interview with me I good friends with those guys I found it funny but I think we're going to do a year recap and our prediction for next year so I think we're going to just try and get that on the books someday soon I think that I think that I'm going to do that.

[42:33] I think that we should just combine our year in shows together and do like a two hour.

[43:08] I'm going to go on the one that makes me think of you that's all you gotta do.
