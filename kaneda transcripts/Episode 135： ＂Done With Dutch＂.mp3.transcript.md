[00:00] We will never stop and be one person new

[00:20] I would say the chances of you knowing what song that was in the intro

[00:25] are the same chances we are ever going to see the big Lebowski go back into production

[00:31] Now that song was the Dutch National Anthem which I think is only fitting on this episode of Knadis Pimbal

[00:39] podcast where we are going to discuss the Dutch Pimbal live from the Netherlands webinar that occurred today

[00:48] I don't know about a lot of you out there but I didn't even know what time it was happening

[00:52] People were sort of hitting me up saying it's going on at noon eastern time which was weird because when I went to the site

[00:58] it said it was going live at 6 p.m. eastern standard time

[01:02] So I watched it

[01:04] I watched it and I want to give my thoughts on what I saw on the webinar

[01:10] I want to give my thoughts on something else that I thought was really strange after it was over

[01:16] and then I just want to give my overall thoughts on this whole situation

[01:20] and how I think this situation has continued to be in anchor that is just pulling down the enjoyment of this hobby

[01:31] and my overall feeling

[01:34] I will share at the end of this podcast about these guys

[01:37] I think summarizes what most of you are probably feeling

[01:41] a lot of my friends are feeling the same thing, a lot of my friends are in on the Big Lebowski

[01:47] and I hate how frustrated they become

[01:51] So first of all the whole reason for this live webinar is it's another medium for these individuals to utilize

[02:01] to communicate to us what's going on with the Big Lebowski production

[02:06] The problem is this, it doesn't matter what medium these guys use

[02:11] whether it's a phone call or an email or a newsletter or a webinar

[02:15] if they're live, if they're recorded, if they send a pigeon with an update, it doesn't matter

[02:21] because they never have any good news

[02:24] they never have any of the news people really want

[02:28] and so all they do every week is come up with new ways to spin no news

[02:35] new ways to stall and buy time

[02:39] and tell us the same old sob story over and over and over again which is in summary the following

[02:47] ARA screwed us, ARA gave us a bill that was more than we could afford

[02:54] we can't bow down to ARA now because then there's no telling what they'll do next

[03:02] and we know that you all love the Big Lebowski pinball but instead of just wanting your games

[03:09] we know that you guys want us to fulfill our dream and we have this dream

[03:14] and all of you want to see Dutch pinball survive

[03:17] and because we know that's what you want we are not going to give in to the demands of ARA

[03:23] and we are going to and then that's the part right we are going to do what?

[03:28] It's been a year already with these guys and now they're saying the options are

[03:35] to find a new contract manufacturer okay?

[03:39] Let's talk about something now and this is before I get into what Yop said

[03:44] well you know what no I want to start with this stuff that he talked about

[03:48] and it was just a lot of it was just a reiteration of what we already knew

[03:52] right nothing new was learned here on this at all, at all

[03:56] so if you're going to go tell people to tune in live

[04:00] and we're going to answer all your questions and then you only answer about

[04:05] a third of the early achiever questions that were put out there

[04:10] they didn't answer everything they should have they didn't

[04:14] it reminded me of Al Capone's safe

[04:18] do you ever remember that when Geraldo Rivera had this live special

[04:22] where they were going to open up Al Capone safe and everyone was watching for hours

[04:28] and after they were done and they finally get to it

[04:31] it was empty with like a beer bottle inside

[04:34] that's what this whole thing felt like you know you're watching them watching

[04:38] him talk I think Barry's off camera and they just keep telling the same story

[04:46] but one thing became abundantly clear and I think finally everyone is

[04:51] can admit one simple fact they are out of money

[04:55] they don't have the money to give the refunds they said it

[04:59] we cannot afford to give people their money back

[05:03] so the money is gone the money is gone

[05:07] now the question becomes where did the money go

[05:11] did the money go to R&D? did the money go to continue development

[05:16] remember these guys traveled around to a lot of different shows

[05:20] brought the prototypes with them

[05:23] kept getting orders because of all the traveling

[05:26] it's very similar to Andrew Highways model of spend the money

[05:31] before you have production figured out

[05:33] and then when you go to do production

[05:37] a lot of the money is gone because you spent it all

[05:40] both of these companies should be ashamed of themselves

[05:44] and I'm not going to be nice on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[05:48] because I'm really annoyed

[05:50] I'll tell you why because I just want these companies to go away

[05:55] I think what these companies have done

[05:58] and I'm going to go off on some tangents there I'm sorry

[06:01] it's a little bit of old Canada my thoughts are a little bit all over the place

[06:05] but I'm really annoyed that these boutique companies came in

[06:08] they swooped into the Pimball hobby and all of them collectively

[06:13] have taken millions of dollars out of the hobbyist pockets

[06:17] millions of dollars out of people's pockets

[06:20] and delivered nothing

[06:23] okay? Hardly anything

[06:25] hardly anyone who ordered these games got their games

[06:29] hardly anyone who ordered alien got it

[06:33] hardly anyone who ordered Lebowski

[06:35] hardly anyone who ordered a Zidware game

[06:37] hardly nobody who ordered a predator game

[06:41] and it's just you add up all of these boutique companies

[06:45] one after another after another after another

[06:48] after another flying to shows bringing prototypes

[06:51] renting out pen house apartments

[06:53] you know how many different shows that Andrew Highway bring full throttle to for years

[06:58] how many different shows did Dutch Pimball go to for years

[07:02] showing everyone their precious game

[07:05] and now when they get a bill by their manufacturer

[07:09] they don't have money to pay it

[07:11] and people are scratching their heads being like where do my 85 hundred go

[07:14] well we know for sure that your 85 hundred didn't go to the materials to build your machine

[07:20] it went to something else

[07:22] and so they're out of money

[07:24] and we're right there if you're in on the Lebowski

[07:26] and you listen to these guys talk

[07:28] they're out of money

[07:30] okay? So what do you do then if you're an early achiever

[07:34] how do you not panic

[07:36] and how do you not just start to see the forest through the trees here

[07:41] that the outcome is not going to be good

[07:44] it is not going to be good

[07:46] so they can't afford to give refunds

[07:48] you start to have to do the sequential questioning

[07:51] right? If they can't afford to give people their money back

[07:54] they couldn't afford to pay a array

[07:56] to basically save their company in the court of a public opinion

[08:00] then where are they going to get the money

[08:03] to retool a new contract manufacturer

[08:06] and start over again

[08:08] one of the most hilarious answers that Yop gave was how they know how to build the Lebowski

[08:14] they know how to manufacture an engineer

[08:17] because they were there with a array doing it

[08:20] okay do you really believe that Yop and Barry have the institutional knowledge

[08:27] on how to build a Lebowski now

[08:30] that they could do it

[08:32] that round two with a new contract manufacturer

[08:35] is going to go faster and smoother than before

[08:38] we know for a fact that

[08:41] array engineered a lot of the parts of the big Lebowski

[08:44] they engineered tooling to make the big Lebowski

[08:48] we also know that array

[08:51] took about wasn't it over a year

[08:54] two years to ramp up their manufacturing capabilities

[08:59] to suit the specs that Dutch pinball gave them

[09:04] so going to a contract manufacturer

[09:07] and getting them ready to make your game

[09:10] that's not something that happens in just a few weeks or a few months

[09:13] that takes a really long time

[09:16] and where are they going to get the money

[09:18] who's going to give them money now

[09:20] see the climate has completely shifted

[09:22] before remember

[09:24] these guys were still considered rock stars

[09:26] people were still fully confident in their ability to deliver

[09:30] the big Lebowski

[09:32] so they were still getting orders

[09:34] I don't know how many total orders they received for the big Lebowski

[09:39] but it was probably more than 50, 60

[09:43] right?

[09:44] who's going to go in now

[09:46] and people want their money back

[09:48] so you've got to be an idiot to go in now

[09:52] in this climate

[09:54] it just wouldn't be wise to do that

[09:58] so we are nowhere forward

[10:02] and I think we are a few steps backwards

[10:05] now the other part of what I

[10:08] when I was listening to Yop talk

[10:10] I mean there were just

[10:12] there were certain moments

[10:15] that I really

[10:17] it really just rubbed me the wrong way

[10:19] the way they were talking about this

[10:22] one thing that they mentioned on this webinar

[10:26] was that they were going to cease production

[10:29] of bride of pinbott 25th anniversary

[10:32] well duh

[10:34] that was probably the silliest announcement ever

[10:37] I've been

[10:39] I've been banging that drum

[10:42] since they announced it how idiotic that was

[10:44] and how a company that could announce that

[10:47] how you could have any confidence in any moves

[10:50] these guys make now

[10:52] after that announcement

[10:53] so I'm glad to see they said no more that

[10:55] but there's questions now right

[10:58] there's questions of will the quality

[11:01] of the game be the same

[11:03] if the engineering of it shifts from

[11:05] ARA to someone else

[11:07] okay what happens to people who bought the

[11:10] ARA version of a big Lebowski

[11:13] if a new contract manufacturer comes on board

[11:16] is every part going to be the same

[11:18] are the specs all identical

[11:20] will support be there

[11:23] maybe maybe not

[11:25] right it's a

[11:26] has this ever happened before

[11:28] right has a pinball company

[11:30] ever made 40 games with one contract manufacturer

[11:34] gone belly up

[11:36] and then had to go find another contract manufacturer

[11:39] to finish the production line

[11:40] I don't think this has ever happened in the history of pinball

[11:43] so one thing that's

[11:47] really the end takeaway

[11:50] of how dutch talks about

[11:53] the next steps

[11:55] is that you have to be patient

[11:57] and we I kept hearing them say

[11:59] our dream our dream like

[12:01] this and that this and that

[12:03] I'll say this

[12:04] I'll say this and

[12:05] and this is something that I noticed

[12:08] after the semif the webinar was over

[12:10] and so I don't know if you guys caught this

[12:12] but after the webinar was over

[12:15] they uploaded a link to YouTube

[12:17] or the YouTube link that went to it

[12:19] actually had all of the footage

[12:22] of them setting up and preparing for the webinar

[12:26] I don't know if they knew that would happen

[12:29] I don't know if they understood how it works on YouTube live

[12:33] but you were able to watch

[12:36] them talking to each other

[12:38] in dutch

[12:39] them setting up

[12:40] their body language

[12:41] the way they were communicating

[12:42] and I'll say this

[12:44] I'll say this

[12:45] when I look at Yop

[12:47] I don't see a man

[12:49] who is stressed out

[12:51] I don't see a man

[12:53] who is

[12:55] really like this is eating away at him

[12:58] I don't see a man

[13:00] who is going to do whatever it takes

[13:02] to make this work

[13:04] and I say that

[13:05] because when you look at his body language

[13:07] on the video which is now been taken down

[13:10] he seems really confident

[13:12] almost a little arrogant

[13:14] almost a little like

[13:16] too calm

[13:18] and too laid back

[13:20] for someone who is like

[13:22] whose company is in this situation

[13:25] it's in

[13:27] and I think he's

[13:29] he's not going to be

[13:31] the savior

[13:33] and fight

[13:35] to make this thing happen

[13:37] I think there's a lot of stubbornness

[13:39] I think there's a lot of ego

[13:41] I think there's a lot of greed

[13:43] and I think there's a lot of cockiness

[13:45] that is occurring

[13:47] between Dutch and R.A.

[13:49] and I don't know

[13:51] why that is the way it is

[13:53] but I really think at this stage

[13:57] these guys should be apologizing profusely

[14:01] and they should be looking for any solution

[14:04] they can possibly do

[14:06] to resolve things with R.A.

[14:08] and that's not going to happen now

[14:10] all they're doing is

[14:12] they're just publicly going on the record

[14:14] and talking poorly about R.A.

[14:17] and they've almost

[14:18] I mean it's at the point now

[14:19] where R.A. it's a dead deal

[14:22] it's a dead deal

[14:24] and then you have this question of

[14:26] what happens to the games that R.A. made

[14:29] and Dutch is telling us

[14:30] well R.A. legally can't sell them

[14:32] because they are

[14:34] because they are universal property

[14:36] they don't have the license to sell them

[14:38] okay that doesn't get anyone

[14:40] they're game

[14:41] so then what happens

[14:42] R.A. just gives those games

[14:43] to R.A. employees

[14:45] as bonuses or something

[14:46] for making them

[14:47] what happens to all the parts

[14:49] that R.A. made

[14:50] for the Big Lebowski Pimball

[14:52] you know and the part that really

[14:54] again it annoys me

[14:55] because

[14:56] almost a year has gone by

[14:58] and these guys have accomplished nothing

[15:01] so what's going to happen

[15:03] right they're not going to get some

[15:05] investor bailout the way

[15:06] highway Pimball did

[15:07] who's going to swoop in

[15:08] and save these guys

[15:09] you know they don't even

[15:10] have a really

[15:11] company per se

[15:12] and it just feels

[15:15] you know I'm trying to

[15:17] think of the best way to

[15:18] put this

[15:19] because I'm upset

[15:21] I'm really upset

[15:23] because I have a lot of friends

[15:24] who are in on the Big Lebowski

[15:26] and I think what sucks is

[15:28] this game is now

[15:30] just another game

[15:32] on a list of games

[15:34] that are tainted

[15:36] games that have brought

[15:38] nothing but

[15:39] unhappiness to the majority

[15:41] of people who are supposed

[15:43] to be getting joy

[15:44] from these games

[15:45] the fact that the majority

[15:47] of early achievers

[15:49] are bummed out

[15:51] are having sleepless nights

[15:53] are stressed out

[15:54] feel their money might be gone

[15:56] they can't get their money back

[15:57] and then you've got

[15:59] yop up there and berry

[16:00] you know

[16:02] cool as can be

[16:03] cool characters joking

[16:04] around even laughing at times

[16:05] I mean there was a time

[16:06] where I think they were

[16:07] saying something like

[16:08] everyone's happy

[16:09] everyone's happy right

[16:10] yeah everyone's happy

[16:11] nobody's happy

[16:12] yop and berry

[16:13] nobody's satisfied

[16:15] your answers aren't

[16:17] winning people over

[16:19] at all

[16:20] you know and this whole thing

[16:22] of like our English

[16:23] isn't so good

[16:24] it's just there are no excuses

[16:26] this is not a language

[16:28] barrier thing anymore

[16:30] it's bullshit

[16:32] what you've done

[16:33] is that you're

[16:34] gone

[16:35] is bullshit

[16:36] you've led people

[16:37] you've brought people

[16:39] who had confidence in you

[16:41] to this place

[16:43] you selected a.r.a

[16:45] you picked them

[16:46] it was your job

[16:47] as responsible business

[16:49] leaders to vet

[16:50] your contract

[16:52] manufacturer

[16:53] and yet here we are

[16:55] so what a.r.a. is just

[16:57] the big devil

[16:58] the big you know

[16:59] the big enemy

[17:00] and meanwhile

[17:02] I don't believe that

[17:04] because the ones who

[17:05] have lied to us

[17:06] are the Dutch

[17:08] pinball folks

[17:09] and all of a sudden

[17:11] all of a sudden right

[17:12] who is waving the flag

[17:14] that these guys

[17:15] they're not to be trusted

[17:17] these guys are not

[17:18] businessmen

[17:19] that you should

[17:20] put your money behind

[17:22] you should get out

[17:23] while you can

[17:24] who refunded you money

[17:26] because he saw that

[17:27] their business dealings

[17:28] were shady

[17:29] remember fill gate

[17:31] remember that

[17:32] what two years ago

[17:33] when fill who was

[17:34] heading up Dutch

[17:35] pinball

[17:36] USA tried to sound

[17:38] the alarm

[17:39] what happened

[17:40] everyone told them

[17:42] shut up

[17:43] everyone said he was

[17:44] crazy

[17:45] everyone said big

[17:46] Lebowski was such a good

[17:47] game

[17:48] that it didn't matter

[17:49] what he was saying

[17:50] it was going to happen

[17:51] but here we are

[17:53] here we are

[17:54] the thing is

[17:55] these guys

[17:56] Andrew Highway

[17:58] it's the same story

[18:00] just different ways

[18:01] of getting to that story

[18:03] it's the same conclusion

[18:05] people starting

[18:07] pinball companies

[18:08] who have no right

[18:10] and don't understand

[18:12] what it takes to get you

[18:15] a game

[18:16] they take your money

[18:18] they go around the world

[18:20] they accept business

[18:22] awards

[18:24] they love all the attention

[18:26] they get

[18:27] they grab the mic

[18:29] at seminars

[18:30] and panel discussions

[18:31] they talk

[18:32] smack about other manufacturers

[18:35] they think they've got

[18:36] the greatest new pinball

[18:38] machine

[18:39] and what have they done

[18:40] what have they done

[18:41] but cause more pain

[18:42] and suffering

[18:44] than anyone else

[18:45] in the hobby

[18:46] and so my final

[18:48] conclusion I come to

[18:50] on these companies

[18:52] is I just wish they

[18:53] would go away

[18:54] I'm fed up with them

[18:56] and I'm fed up

[18:57] I'm fed up with them

[18:59] I'm fed up with my friends

[19:01] who have to wait months

[19:02] and years for games

[19:04] and they're still stuck now

[19:06] with these organizations

[19:08] and look I don't think

[19:10] highway is out of the

[19:11] deep end either

[19:13] you know

[19:14] when Andrew Highway

[19:15] went away

[19:16] his farewell note

[19:18] and you know he said

[19:19] something like

[19:20] they're going to be making

[19:21] hundreds of games a month

[19:22] and here we are

[19:23] all over again

[19:25] how is highway

[19:27] pinball going to make

[19:28] hundreds of games a month

[19:29] is that really going to happen

[19:31] anytime soon

[19:32] but the expectations

[19:34] see it's so easy to set

[19:35] expectations

[19:36] it's so easy to say stuff

[19:38] but it's so much harder

[19:39] to back it up in pinball

[19:41] and is this the final

[19:44] BS boutique company

[19:46] that we're going to have to deal with

[19:47] or more going to pop up

[19:49] you know it's just

[19:51] I'm angry

[19:52] I'm angry

[19:53] I invited Barry and Yop

[19:55] on the show

[19:56] like a month and a half ago

[19:58] two months ago

[19:59] and they declined

[20:00] they declined because you know what

[20:01] because I would ask them

[20:02] tough questions

[20:03] I wouldn't let them

[20:04] do what they constantly are doing

[20:07] the sort of

[20:08] like have pity on us

[20:10] this is our dream

[20:11] like it's all

[20:12] ARAs fault

[20:13] and you know

[20:14] you don't understand how the

[20:15] law works in the Netherlands

[20:16] it could take years

[20:17] no how about this

[20:19] how about you just say

[20:20] it's over

[20:21] sorry

[20:22] we ran our company

[20:24] into the ground

[20:25] I mean that's what Andrew

[20:26] highway

[20:27] that's what happened to him

[20:28] he ran highway

[20:29] pinball into the ground

[20:31] and I

[20:32] there's no other way to look at it

[20:35] and as much as people want

[20:38] these games

[20:40] because they love these two

[20:42] themes

[20:43] look how these two companies

[20:45] ended up

[20:46] go back

[20:47] and listen to Canadian

[20:48] pinball podcasts

[20:49] where I predicted

[20:50] like a year ago

[20:52] that highway pinball

[20:53] and Dutch pinball

[20:54] wouldn't make it

[20:55] and what's happened

[20:56] they haven't made it

[20:58] no and

[20:59] and in those things

[21:01] coming to fruition

[21:02] I don't feel satisfied

[21:04] or validated

[21:06] I feel pissed off

[21:08] because

[21:09] it's sucked the life

[21:11] out of the collector

[21:13] new and box part of the hobby

[21:14] it's sucked the life out of it

[21:16] so much so

[21:18] that you know

[21:20] I'm just going to be honest

[21:22] for the first time in a long time

[21:24] like I don't even like

[21:26] want to read

[21:27] pinside anymore

[21:29] I don't want to go into

[21:30] these threads anymore

[21:32] I don't want

[21:34] to do anything other

[21:36] then just go play some

[21:37] pinball

[21:38] at a bar

[21:39] every once in a while

[21:41] with five bucks

[21:42] with ten bucks

[21:44] and then not give a shit

[21:46] about following

[21:48] all of these new games

[21:50] coming out

[21:51] just so like

[21:53] I can have some information

[21:55] or

[21:57] or basically going on a title

[21:59] just to

[22:01] just to grab something

[22:02] because I have a fear

[22:03] of missing out on something

[22:05] and there's a good chance

[22:07] that you know

[22:09] get the game

[22:10] and after a few months

[22:11] I'll just be bored

[22:12] with it and want to sell it

[22:13] or there's a chance

[22:14] the game won't even come out

[22:16] it sucks

[22:18] 2017

[22:20] the year that was supposed to deliver

[22:22] so much

[22:24] has like really been the year

[22:26] where everyone but

[22:28] JJP Stern and Spooky

[22:30] has just

[22:31] collapsed

[22:32] sooner than I thought

[22:34] I really did

[22:35] I thought these companies might hold on a little bit longer

[22:37] but it's happened sooner than we thought

[22:39] so

[22:41] you know look

[22:43] have we learned a lesson

[22:45] are people going to

[22:47] not pre-order

[22:49] somebody bought

[22:51] rare heroes

[22:53] Big Lebowski spot

[22:55] somebody gave him

[22:57] $85

[22:58] for his spot

[23:00] after they knew all of this

[23:02] shit show going on

[23:04] so there are

[23:07] just people out there

[23:09] absolutely

[23:11] willing

[23:13] to again

[23:15] forgive and enter into the cycle of contempt over again

[23:19] look Greg's

[23:21] Greg is the fact that Greg got that

[23:23] I love it

[23:25] my friend is out of it

[23:27] his hands are clean

[23:29] and he walks away without losing a dollar

[23:31] a dollar

[23:33] the person who bought his spot

[23:35] do I think that person is an idiot

[23:37] absolutely

[23:39] it would be like buying

[23:41] a rasa spot right now

[23:43] from someone

[23:45] it would be

[23:47] you know it would be like buying

[23:49] I don't even know

[23:51] it's not like there's more chance to get an alien

[23:53] LA

[23:55] but why even bother buying someone's spot

[23:57] just wait

[23:59] wait

[24:01] it doesn't make any sense

[24:03] if Big Lebowski's actually make it back into production

[24:05] you'll be able to get him

[24:07] so let's say they go for a little bit more than

[24:09] 8500

[24:11] let's say you can get one for 10 or even like 11,000

[24:13] 12,000 whatever it is

[24:15] at least you know you're getting a game

[24:17] instead of

[24:19] oh I'll just accept the fact that I can lose

[24:21] 8500

[24:23] I mean look

[24:25] I get a lot of you guys out there have a lot of money

[24:27] but how stupid is it

[24:29] how stupid is it to speculate

[24:31] and be fine

[24:33] with losing

[24:35] 8500 on a pinball machine

[24:37] I mean you guys that rich

[24:39] is this a billionaire

[24:41] boys club pinball

[24:43] doesn't that make you pissed off

[24:45] to no end

[24:47] how can you

[24:49] not think about all the things you could do with that money

[24:51] and also

[24:53] aren't you just disgusted that you gave your money

[24:55] to these individuals

[24:57] who were irresponsible with it

[24:59] and then still

[25:01] even in the end

[25:03] they're still in the end

[25:05] they're never really that sorry

[25:07] because these guys

[25:09] are they have egos

[25:11] they're cocky about it

[25:13] and they if you listen to all of them talk

[25:15] through the years

[25:17] they all thought

[25:19] manufacturing it would be the easy part

[25:21] because once they had a prototype

[25:23] why would it be hard to manufacture

[25:25] pinball machines

[25:27] and now we know

[25:29] that they

[25:31] that they

[25:33] put the cart in front of the horse

[25:35] time and time again

[25:37] you know it doesn't stop

[25:39] you know like these threads

[25:41] like I was in the alien thread

[25:43] the other day and there's

[25:45] David Teo like

[25:47] shillin alien saying it shoots better than

[25:49] dialed in

[25:51] alright

[25:53] I've played both these games

[25:55] many times

[25:57] to say alien

[25:59] shoots better than dialed in really

[26:01] objective thing

[26:03] I don't even think it's close

[26:05] the question I would have for

[26:07] David Teo is

[26:09] is he getting paid

[26:11] like oric is he getting paid

[26:13] a percentage for every game sold

[26:15] because it seems like that was the deal

[26:17] that Andrew highway

[26:19] was inking out

[26:21] with everyone on the US team

[26:23] their contracts

[26:25] give them a percentage of games sold

[26:27] so here these gentlemen are

[26:29] selling the game again

[26:31] and it's just like the whole

[26:33] thing it's just

[26:35] I don't know I'm

[26:37] I'm just feeling like

[26:39] these threads

[26:41] just drain them

[26:43] drain them all

[26:45] drain them all

[26:47] if alien pinball goes into production cool go buy one

[26:49] but being in these threads

[26:51] toxic

[26:53] toxic wastelands

[26:55] what would I do if I was in on dutch pinball

[26:57] but why waste your money

[26:59] I might just say

[27:01] lesson learned move on

[27:03] forget this

[27:05] it's a joke

[27:07] the whole thing is a joke now

[27:09] we're gonna wait months and months

[27:11] and months

[27:13] no it's not it's not gonna happen

[27:15] your dreams of big Lebowski pinball

[27:17] are not gonna come true

[27:19] the best thing you can do if you really want one

[27:21] you know go buy one that's out there

[27:23] you have to pay a huge premium

[27:25] those are the only ones i'd be confident

[27:27] you know that you'd get

[27:29] so this a little bit of

[27:31] can't or rant it in raven right

[27:33] I'm usually trying to be

[27:35] positive I'm usually trying to

[27:37] look at the you know the good stuff

[27:39] going on in the hobby

[27:41] dialed in is shipping star wars

[27:43] is about to go out

[27:45] but I have to say

[27:47] the more I read

[27:49] pinci lately the more I just keep

[27:51] seeing this stuff and

[27:53] it's it's dragging my enthusiasm

[27:55] for the hobby down and I know it's doing it

[27:57] for a lot of you out there as well

[27:59] some good news

[28:01] we got to see what the artwork

[28:03] on thunderbirds is

[28:05] did you guys check out that

[28:07] that's the good news

[28:09] why Mike is showing stuff like this

[28:11] like just a cabinet on its side

[28:13] and just random pictures from the factory

[28:17] you know again

[28:19] has he not learned the right way

[28:21] to market a game

[28:23] all that's a thing

[28:25] again sorry guys I'm just

[28:27] I'm in a mood tonight I'm in a mood

[28:29] because I'm just

[28:31] I'm growing tired

[28:33] of being in a hobby

[28:35] where people lack common sense

[28:37] tired of being in a hobby

[28:39] where people don't learn from others mistakes

[28:41] tired of being in a hobby

[28:43] where so many people are tone deaf

[28:45] tired of being in a hobby

[28:47] where even after presented all the evidence

[28:49] in the world

[28:51] you get idiots

[28:53] who still just blindly support manufacturers

[28:55] you know I'm tired of it

[28:57] I mean I'm tired of

[28:59] of looking back

[29:01] and realizing oh look

[29:03] Kym Mitchell was right

[29:05] all those companies

[29:07] Andrew Highway started

[29:09] and that failed

[29:11] they were actual failures

[29:13] and here's another

[29:15] failure

[29:17] Kym Mitchell at the stake

[29:19] and drove them away

[29:21] you know it's

[29:23] these Dutch guys

[29:25] they've been pulling these

[29:27] shenanigans now for a really long time

[29:29] and why don't we do this

[29:31] why doesn't Robin

[29:33] just lock the big Lebowski thread

[29:35] and kick those mother fuckers

[29:37] off a pinside

[29:39] why don't you ban those guys

[29:41] why don't you stop them

[29:43] ever just preemptively strike them

[29:45] don't nothing but hurt the pinball hobby

[29:47] get out of here

[29:49] get out of here

[29:51] the next time you communicate with my

[29:53] my readers and my members

[29:55] is if you say games are back in production

[29:57] but until that's the news

[29:59] I don't want Dutch pinball

[30:01] anywhere near this site

[30:03] because you've hurt this hobby

[30:05] remove their thread tag

[30:07] you know their little

[30:09] icon Dutch pinball

[30:11] and get rid of them

[30:13] the purge, the purge of pinball

[30:15] the purge that needs to occur

[30:17] is all the BS companies need to go away

[30:21] and they need to

[30:23] they're ticket to get back in

[30:25] right they're marker to get back in

[30:27] to this hobby

[30:29] and this community

[30:31] and to this pinball universe that we all love

[30:33] is a game in a box

[30:35] without that

[30:37] I don't want to hear

[30:39] anything I don't want to see how the sausage is made

[30:41] I don't want to hear about your intentions

[30:43] I don't want to hear about

[30:45] how many you plan to build a month

[30:47] I don't want to hear about any of that stuff

[30:49] I want to know

[30:51] where I can go get the game

[30:53] when it's on a shelf

[30:55] like every other toy I buy

[30:57] like every other entertainment thing

[30:59] I enjoy

[31:01] there's none of this shit

[31:03] you know nobody takes my money

[31:05] to go develop the video game

[31:07] nobody takes my money

[31:09] to go make the clothes I wear

[31:11] before the clothes are even

[31:13] nobody takes my money

[31:15] to develop the car I drive

[31:17] but all these people took your money

[31:19] to develop a pinball machine

[31:21] before they knew what they were doing

[31:23] before they knew what you were doing

[31:25] and everyone just kept doing it

[31:27] and we still got idiots

[31:29] buying people spots out

[31:31] as of June what

[31:33] June 19

[31:35] I can't believe it

[31:37] no one is nobody learning a lesson

[31:39] and the other thing they need to do

[31:41] with the purge is you need to

[31:43] kick the damn shills off the sites

[31:45] you need to kick the health

[31:47] ins off the sites

[31:49] you need to kick the wicker man's off the sites

[31:51] you need to kick all the guys

[31:53] that shield for these manufacturers

[31:55] for all these years

[31:57] and then when they go belly up

[31:59] and everyone loses their money

[32:01] what do these guys say?

[32:03] I just love pinball

[32:05] I just love pinball

[32:07] I just love pinball

[32:09] for all these guys

[32:11] that is all pinball

[32:13] I just love pinball

[32:17] to put a new pinball

[32:21] I just love pinball

[32:23] to put all new pinball companies

[32:27] forget this bullshit

[32:29] it is going to come to a point

[32:31] where

[32:33] And I hope it's enough pinball for you.

[32:35] Because it's so idiotic to think that

[32:38] there would be eight pinball manufacturers in 2017.

[32:42] If you think that a man for that much pinball is there,

[32:46] you're dead wrong.

[32:47] It's not.

[32:49] People need to stop thinking that this industry

[32:52] is like thriving.

[32:55] It's not.

[32:57] If you look at the margins of what these boutique companies

[33:00] make per game,

[33:02] if you look at the margins of what they make,

[33:05] they are not making a lot of money.

[33:09] All of you out there, most of you,

[33:10] most of you out there who buy every new LE,

[33:13] you guys make more than designers of pinball machines.

[33:18] I can tell you this,

[33:19] I don't make more than Cliffey B,

[33:22] who designs video games.

[33:24] I don't make more than the head designers

[33:27] of the best video games in the world.

[33:28] Those guys are making multi-millions of dollars

[33:31] because they're billion dollar franchises.

[33:34] All right, I went to the bar this weekend,

[33:37] dialed in there, pioneers bar, bars packed,

[33:40] nobody's on it.

[33:42] Nobody's on it.

[33:43] Everyone's drinking, having a good time,

[33:45] games just sitting there.

[33:48] We look at this hobby in a vacuum,

[33:51] we look at it under a microscope, and look,

[33:54] we love pinball.

[33:56] I love pinball, you love pinball.

[33:58] This podcast, it's about pinball.

[34:00] It's not, I'm not here to like make fun of the fact

[34:02] that we love pinball.

[34:03] I love that we all collectively love a very niche

[34:08] and a very tiny, tiny hobby, right?

[34:12] This is a very tiny group of people

[34:15] that are into something that should be dead 20 years ago.

[34:20] Pinball, this is like a drastic part.

[34:22] Pinball was predetermined to be obsolete by 2017.

[34:27] It's a gaming device.

[34:28] The digital world should have selected pinball,

[34:35] nature selected pinball to be extinct.

[34:39] And the fact that it's still around is a minor miracle.

[34:42] The fact that we have so many options

[34:44] is another minor miracle.

[34:46] But the fact that we got so many charlatans

[34:49] to swoop in and think they knew what it took,

[34:52] it's unfortunate.

[34:54] But let's all do one thing.

[34:57] As of today, for all you listeners out there,

[35:01] just say never again, not doing this shit again.

[35:05] Okay, I'm not doing it again.

[35:06] I'm not chasing after new machines

[35:10] just so I can have something that even though I love the theme,

[35:13] you gotta admit a lot of what the drive to buy,

[35:16] the hype to buy right away, is that I just wanna,

[35:19] is the fear of missing out.

[35:20] I don't wanna miss out on getting the Ellie

[35:23] because the Ellie is gonna go up in value.

[35:25] None of these machines are going up in value anymore.

[35:28] None, only the, yeah, maybe the ones that are associated

[35:31] with failed companies because they're so few of them,

[35:34] but those don't even make people feel good.

[35:36] Like when you own a magic girl or you own a libousky

[35:39] or you own an alien right now, you don't feel great

[35:42] because the majority of people who also should have them

[35:45] because they're not supposed to be,

[35:48] they weren't intended to leave other people broke

[35:51] or pissed off or, or, or, or, or steal other people's money.

[35:56] Everyone in those games comes attached,

[35:59] a whole other group of buyers that got shafted,

[36:02] that hate the fact that they don't have one

[36:04] and you have one, that sucks.

[36:05] I don't wanna own stuff like that.

[36:08] You know, I hate to, I hate to feel that the thing that I have

[36:12] is I solely have it in a way that angers other people

[36:16] because they got screwed out of having theirs too.

[36:18] It's just a game, it's just a toy.

[36:20] Nobody gives a shit that you have a little bit

[36:23] different art package or trim.

[36:25] And because of that, again, I've woken up.

[36:28] I really feel like this is a new,

[36:30] I'm looking at this hobby differently.

[36:32] Because of that, I'm, I'm baneling on Star Wars LE.

[36:37] I want out.

[36:39] I sent an email to JJ asking how refunds work

[36:42] on the deposits I put down for two.

[36:44] And the reason I'm out is simple.

[36:46] Is I just don't think Stern is giving enough

[36:49] for the LE version of the game?

[36:51] And I don't even, if I'm honest,

[36:55] I don't even like what I see.

[36:57] I don't like what I see.

[36:59] I don't like the way the games rolled out.

[37:01] I don't care what the gameplay is.

[37:03] There's nothing I will see in gameplay

[37:07] that will change my mind, that I don't think Star Wars LE

[37:11] is worth what Stern is charging.

[37:13] And I sort of, I can simplify it in one way.

[37:17] When you remove a shaker motor from an LE pinball machine,

[37:21] but you charge me more money for it,

[37:24] a shaker motor which is designed to enhance the gameplay

[37:29] and bring certain elements and certain modes to life.

[37:33] You remove that.

[37:35] Okay, so all I kept thinking about was this.

[37:37] So I blow up the death star.

[37:39] All right, I blow up the freaking death star

[37:42] and the game doesn't shake.

[37:44] And that's it, I'm out.

[37:46] I'm out.

[37:47] You're gonna make me pay extra for it.

[37:49] You're gonna make me pay extra for this, for that.

[37:51] I'm out.

[37:52] I'm not paying $8,500, $9,000 for something that has features removed.

[37:59] The art package on it is just whatever.

[38:03] It's not great.

[38:05] The game itself, again, I don't care how it shoots.

[38:09] You know another thing I looked at was the,

[38:11] the Dwight, you know coding the game.

[38:15] What the button does on the apron, right?

[38:18] You hit it.

[38:19] There's a list of all the different things

[38:21] that the button is used for and there's like 10 things.

[38:25] And I'm like, this is stupid.

[38:27] This is absolutely stupid.

[38:28] It's over complicated.

[38:30] It reminds me of Game of Thrones.

[38:31] You're just gonna code the thing to be so complicated

[38:35] and have a button do like 10 different things.

[38:37] Why?

[38:38] Why?

[38:39] It's a pinball machine.

[38:42] You know, and I just, I look at it

[38:44] and I can't help but feel that just dropping an LCD screen

[38:47] in front of over the top of targets

[38:51] isn't the laziest thing I've ever seen

[38:53] or putting a tie fighter on a spring.

[38:55] And I'm just, I'm not gonna justify it.

[38:58] If you want it, cool.

[39:01] If you want a Star Wars Ellie,

[39:02] if you think the money's there, great.

[39:05] I can already hear Iceman saying how

[39:07] it's gonna be the greatest shooter ever, whatever.

[39:09] It's gonna be another richie pin with flow.

[39:13] I don't see the magic there.

[39:15] I don't see the world in their glass.

[39:17] I don't see the value for the money.

[39:20] And I just, I'm out.

[39:22] I'm out.

[39:22] And I love Star Wars and I'm out.

[39:24] I'm out.

[39:25] All right, I'm gonna stay in with Dial then

[39:27] because I think Dial then is amazing.

[39:28] I've played it a lot and I see the value there

[39:32] and it's unique and it's quirky.

[39:34] And I'm in.

[39:36] I'm in.

[39:37] I only want quality.

[39:38] I only want quality.

[39:40] I don't wanna feel like when I'm getting

[39:42] it's just, you know, a little bit of a cash grab.

[39:45] I don't.

[39:46] I don't and doesn't mean I won't get another Stern, I will.

[39:49] If Stern gives me a game that has everything in it

[39:52] that I think it should have for the money,

[39:54] I will be a buyer.

[39:56] I will be a buyer.

[39:57] But 800 Star Wars Ellie's to me doesn't feel limited.

[40:01] It doesn't feel special.

[40:03] There's nothing else other than a different art package

[40:06] and this art package doesn't stand out

[40:09] the way Slimer Edition stood out.

[40:12] It doesn't make much sense to me.

[40:16] It doesn't.

[40:17] So I'm out.

[40:18] I didn't hear back from JJ so hopefully we'll connect tomorrow.

[40:22] But I'm gonna put my money elsewhere.

[40:23] I'm gonna wait.

[40:25] I'm not chasing after everything.

[40:27] There's no more of that happening in my world.

[40:30] I will buy games that I know I'm gonna love

[40:33] and I feel good.

[40:35] I know this has been like an angry sort of

[40:37] canada podcast, but I'll say this.

[40:40] I want more balance in my life and pinball.

[40:44] It became so much the center of the universe

[40:47] that I started to realize, you know, yeah,

[40:50] there's multiple ways you can spend money,

[40:52] but I mean a lot of it just had to do with taking Brenda out

[40:56] for our anniversary, going shopping with her the other day,

[41:00] seeing all these people adding about having a good time,

[41:03] realizing that, you know, I could spend money on pinball,

[41:06] but I also could do something that would be just as magical,

[41:10] if not more, and actually be a memory

[41:14] that would be much better than just a pinball machine.

[41:18] Now, like a lot of you out there, you do both.

[41:20] And that's great.

[41:21] Like that's what I want to strive for

[41:23] and that's what everyone should strive for

[41:25] where there's a balance in your life

[41:27] between the pinball machines and making sure

[41:30] you're adding culture to your life

[41:34] to make sure you're trying those nice restaurants,

[41:36] to make sure you're saving for the future,

[41:39] to make sure your kids have what they need, your family,

[41:41] to make sure you're taking care of your health.

[41:43] I've always said it, you should spend at least

[41:48] as much time exercising and eating healthy

[41:52] as you should playing pinball, but I know people don't.

[41:56] And, you know, I don't, look,

[41:59] everyone lives the life they want to live,

[42:02] but I know for me personally, feeling good,

[42:05] feeling good for me starts with how I physically feel

[42:10] and how I physically feel can be attached

[42:12] to the material things in my life.

[42:15] And I know that getting ripped off by Dutch pinball

[42:17] and getting ripped off by highway pinball

[42:20] physically takes its toll on you.

[42:22] It physically takes its toll on the individuals

[42:24] at those companies.

[42:25] Again, look at the pictures of Andrew Highway

[42:27] when he started the company.

[42:28] Look at the pictures of him now.

[42:30] See, Yop, Yop, Yop doesn't look like he's aged today.

[42:33] Yop, that's the thing.

[42:34] I know Yop is too comfortable and doesn't care

[42:37] as much as Andrew Highway.

[42:39] And I know that it ate away at Andrew Highway.

[42:41] You know, I'll say that about Andrew.

[42:43] I know he cared more than Yop cared.

[42:46] And I don't think Andrew, you know,

[42:50] I don't think he was, he fought.

[42:54] He fought to try and get it as far as he could,

[42:57] but he just couldn't, right?

[42:58] At the end of the day,

[42:59] it's just, you're out of money, right?

[43:01] The map doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.

[43:04] But Andrew Highway, I felt like had a lot of sleepless nights.

[43:08] Right?

[43:09] And I don't think Yop, I mean, I feel like,

[43:13] I just have an image of him like having nice dinners

[43:16] and going on life is normal, you know?

[43:19] I just don't feel like this is killing him.

[43:22] I don't, it should be.

[43:23] It should be.

[43:24] When you start a company and you take people's money

[43:26] and they didn't get their products,

[43:27] it should be eating away at you every day.

[43:31] So that's this little impromptu edition

[43:34] of Knit is Pinball Podcast.

[43:36] I want it rare here to come on the show

[43:38] and talk about him selling his spot.

[43:41] You might do it at a later date.

[43:43] But I think, you know, sometimes I gotta get this out.

[43:46] I gotta vent.

[43:47] And I already feel better about it.

[43:49] I feel better about the hobby.

[43:51] I feel better like letting go of Star Wars.

[43:53] Let someone else have it.

[43:54] I don't need to be in on everything.

[43:56] I don't need to chase every game.

[43:59] You know, I wanna get my magic girl fixed.

[44:00] That's still frustrating me, but we'll get it fixed.

[44:02] It's just a game.

[44:05] And, you know, and Pinball guys, we're all in it together.

[44:09] We're all in it together.

[44:11] I think it's a great hobby.

[44:12] I love all the friends I've made in this hobby.

[44:15] I love the daily conversations I have with people out there.

[44:18] I'm looking at you Blake.

[44:20] I'm looking at you Greg Colton.

[44:22] I'm looking at you Ryan over in Australia, right?

[44:26] I mean, I love talking to these guys every day.

[44:28] Bill Brandis, you know, PDX Monkey every once in a while.

[44:34] You know, it's the daily conversations

[44:35] that we get to wake up in this world

[44:38] and connect with people from all over the world

[44:42] and share our love of Pinball and talk about

[44:46] what's going on in the Pinball hobby.

[44:49] I mean, that's why I love this hobby.

[44:52] And that's why I get so mad when individuals come in,

[44:56] and they put our enjoyment in jeopardy

[44:59] because they know where, they know all of us

[45:01] deep down inside, are vulnerable to their promises, right?

[45:07] And we just have to work harder not to let them

[45:11] make us into suckers, right?

[45:13] My friend like Charles Thomas,

[45:14] Charles, thank you for listening.

[45:16] You know, these guys are great.

[45:18] They love Pinball.

[45:19] Sean McDermott, Jared, it's Thurne,

[45:22] I talked him all the time, you know?

[45:24] Jonathan Juustin, he finally has conceding

[45:28] that he's not gonna get his big Lebowski.

[45:30] You know, Chris Thompson, The Black Knight,

[45:33] Jeff Rivera, Scott Denise,

[45:35] I'm just gonna list the people on Facebook.

[45:37] But man, I love talking to all these guys.

[45:40] So that's it.

[45:42] Let's all buy games that are inboxes

[45:48] and let the rest of the bullshit just dissipate

[45:53] and let them all go away.

[45:55] May they all disappear and we will only let them back

[46:00] when they come bearing games in boxes.

[46:04] Have a good night, eat healthy, work out,

[46:08] take care of your loved ones before Pinball

[46:11] and we'll talk to you real soon.

[46:13] Pray and live a 해, the Lord.
