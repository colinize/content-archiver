[00:00] You're the only one who really knew me at all.

[00:07] So take a look at me now.

[00:14] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that won't lose you any money.

[00:20] This is going up in value, people.

[00:22] I want to thank all of our new club members.

[00:24] We are well over 700 club members.

[00:27] We now have 710 who believe in Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:31] Welcome, Daniel, Stacey, Brian, Scott, Matthew, Joe, Mike, Ken, another Stacey, Mr. Victor's in the house, Ian, Corey.

[00:42] Guys, thank you so much.

[00:44] We have blown by my target of getting to 700 this month.

[00:47] And here's what I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:50] I want to talk about one word.

[00:53] And I think this word is everything.

[00:56] And this is going to be the word that really, like, I feel like Elmo, like the word of the day, this is going to be the word that is really going to define where pinball goes in 2024 and well into the future.

[01:09] And they say that Canadian doesn't have new topics to talk about.

[01:12] You know what the word is?

[01:14] Demand.

[01:15] I want to talk about demand because I've been thinking about something for a while.

[01:19] Ever since George Gomez said this line, he said,

[01:22] As long as there's demand, we will make the game, right?

[01:26] He talks about that a lot.

[01:28] He talked about demand when he talked about why a foo fighter topper is $2,000.

[01:35] He said they priced it there because of the demand.

[01:39] And look, I just want to say this, if you get it right and you supply what the demand is asking for, you will be a very successful company.

[01:49] And as I look at pinball in 2024, here's the big issue I'm seeing.

[01:53] There is not demand for either the themes we're getting and then is there demand at these prices.

[02:01] And I think the big issue is this.

[02:03] Do any pinball companies do any market research whatsoever?

[02:09] Like, did Stern do market research to figure out that if they price these games between $7,000 and $13,000, there will be demand for 1,000 LEs at $13,000.

[02:23] Did Jersey Jack Pinball do any market research to figure out if there's demand for 1,000 Elton Johns at $15,000?

[02:34] Did American Pinball do any market research to figure out if there's even any demand for galactic tank force?

[02:42] And so then you have all these pinball companies.

[02:44] I mean, there's so many of them and you add them all up.

[02:47] Is there demand for 1,100 labyrinth machines?

[02:51] All these decisions are being made that greatly impact this hobby we love.

[02:56] And I think the answer is there's none.

[02:59] There's zero market research going on anywhere.

[03:03] And I think that's a very dangerous thing.

[03:05] And in my profession, I work in marketing so much of what we do before we make a single move is we do market research.

[03:13] We do analytics.

[03:15] We look at the data.

[03:16] We look at the numbers.

[03:17] We go to consumers.

[03:18] We find out what they want, what they're willing to pay.

[03:21] All of this matters so much.

[03:24] And I think the reason why there's none of it in pinball is for the longest time everything was selling, right?

[03:30] There's like this arrogance now by these companies that if they make anything, we will buy it regardless of the price, regardless of the theme.

[03:39] It's crazy to me that we live in a pinball world now where John Wick has more supply than Star Wars.

[03:47] I mean, think about that just for a minute.

[03:49] Stern really thinks it could sell more John Wick LEs than Star Wars.

[03:55] Does Padredy gaming really think there's 750 people that want a funhouse for $10,000, right?

[04:04] A game that you could buy for $5,000.

[04:07] All of a sudden, they're going to bring it back, charge twice as much money, and then make 750 of them.

[04:14] How did they land on that number?

[04:16] How did Andrea Padredy say, we're going to make 750 of these?

[04:21] How does Dutch pinball X figure out that 500 people are going to want to buy Alice in Wonderland for $14,000?

[04:31] All of this is a guessing game.

[04:33] They are 100% guessing on all of this.

[04:37] And that's the problem I see in pinball.

[04:40] These companies are all making crazy guesses and assumptions about what we want.

[04:45] And before they know what we really want, they're supplying it left and right, right?

[04:50] It's all over the place.

[04:51] They're supplying tons of games.

[04:53] They're supplying tons of themes.

[04:55] And all of it is like, well, maybe this will work.

[04:58] And what I love about the pinball market right now, like I'm looking at this galactic tank force LE that was like almost $11,000 new in box just a year ago.

[05:08] And now it's selling for $7,500.

[05:11] You know why?

[05:12] Because there's no demand.

[05:14] And as I've always said, a bad game has like no demand.

[05:18] Like there's almost no price in which you really want it because to a lot of us out there, we've got to make room for a pinball machine, right?

[05:26] You've already got like almost all the pins you can have in your house.

[05:29] And so for something to go out of your game room and something to go in, it has to be a game that you demand that you really, really want.

[05:36] And I was wondering like, why do pinball companies keep operating like this?

[05:40] Like why are they operating with tons of secrecy?

[05:44] They don't do any market research.

[05:46] They start on a two year development of a game and they don't really know how many people want it, how to price it properly.

[05:53] All of it is just a big guess.

[05:56] And all of it is making a huge assumption that we want it.

[06:00] Now, what would I do if I were at a pinball company?

[06:02] Well, I would stop with all this like secrecy, right?

[06:05] Why? Why?

[06:06] Think about it like this.

[06:07] We all know Dutch pinball is making back to the future.

[06:11] It's not a secret.

[06:12] And we know that Barry is working with Bob Gale and Joe Kay and we expect great things.

[06:17] We all know that, right?

[06:18] Is that hurting sales of Big Lebowski?

[06:20] No, because there are two separate themes that both have a lot of demand and they're going to be separate games and they're going to be fully featured.

[06:28] And they're going to be designed from the ground up by a team that loads their games with amazing stuff because they built a reputation on their first game,

[06:36] even though it took 10 years, of a company that's really, really creative when it thinks about how it can mechanically make a world under glass.

[06:44] Not a world on the screen, which is Stern's new approach.

[06:47] Like, look at John Wick.

[06:48] That's not a world under glass.

[06:50] It is a world on the screen and people don't want it.

[06:53] But we know that Barry is making back to the future.

[06:56] So what if Barry said, hey, look, I've got back to the future, I've got blood sport and I've got die hard.

[07:04] We're going to make those three pins in the next three years.

[07:08] What would happen?

[07:09] You know, and think about it like this.

[07:11] Imagine if blood sports like that outlier, right?

[07:13] It's a cult movie.

[07:14] Some people like it.

[07:15] Some people don't.

[07:16] He could actually do market research.

[07:18] Do you guys want blood sport?

[07:20] Do you want it?

[07:21] And then he could hear the feedback and that might save him from making a mistake if there's not enough demand.

[07:27] It also would help Barry know how strong the demand is.

[07:31] It would help him know maybe how many to make.

[07:33] It might help him where to price the game.

[07:36] We can't live in this pinball world anymore, people, where every single game, every single Stern and Jersey jack machine, all of them are all priced exactly the same.

[07:47] And they're going to make the same volume regardless of demand.

[07:52] That is stupid.

[07:53] That is so idiotic.

[07:55] And I know they used to get away with it when the prices were much cheaper and we saw the value in everything.

[08:02] And now we're seeing everything lose so much value, they need to start doing it differently.

[08:08] They can't rely on FOMO.

[08:10] It's not working, right?

[08:11] What do you do now with the thousand John Wick LEs where there's no demand?

[08:16] If you bought one, you just lost $4,000.

[08:19] And why did they make more John Wick LEs than Star Wars?

[08:23] It's stupid and they're going to get punished and they're going to learn a harsh lesson in marketing because all these pinball companies, and you know this, they've been very lazy in the marketing department.

[08:32] They haven't had to do much marketing.

[08:34] In fact, it's people like me and Jack Danger all those years, like all these content creators are doing the job for them.

[08:41] But now they have to actually turn on educated marketing moves and I don't think they know how to do it because to really do it right,

[08:49] you're going to have to give up your only marketing strategy, which is this stupid FOMO approach where you try to force these people to buy these expensive products on week one with not enough information

[09:03] and you think you're just going to sell out of everything just because you unveil a game.

[09:08] It doesn't work.

[09:09] It didn't work with Elton John.

[09:10] It hasn't worked with the last few stern machines.

[09:13] It's just not working and yet they're still going to do it.

[09:16] And look, every once in a while, I mean this, every once in a while, you're going to have a banger.

[09:20] You're going to have a Harry Potter or a back to the future.

[09:23] And yes, when you have something so popular, the demand is through the roof where you don't need to really do much.

[09:31] You don't need to do much.

[09:32] In fact, you're always going to have more demand than you can possibly supply.

[09:36] And then it gets tricky, right?

[09:38] How many Elis do I make of Harry Potter?

[09:42] Am I only going to make a thousand, right?

[09:44] There's so much demand and the answer is probably yes.

[09:47] You got to still create some sort of FOMO and scarcity for those limited versions of the game that are for collectors.

[09:54] But then you can start to play around a little bit.

[09:56] A Harry Potter collector's edition would absolutely sell easily for $15,000.

[10:02] In Elton John will not.

[10:04] A godfather will not.

[10:06] A Toy Story 4 will not.

[10:08] It's just the way it goes.

[10:09] And so, you know, Barry sitting on Back to the Future right now demands through the roof and imagine if he makes only 88 special limited edition versions of the game.

[10:19] Like a really, really high end collectible version of the game.

[10:22] What do you think he could price that at?

[10:24] And look, they secured the theme.

[10:26] They should be able to have some fun with it because there are people in this hobby who live in $8 million homes.

[10:32] And there are enough millionaires, multi-multi-millionaires in Pinball to absorb 88 Back to the Future games that are $20,000.

[10:41] What there is not in Pinball are 500 idiots willing to spend $20,000 on a BS Keith Elwyn 60th anniversary James Bond.

[10:52] There's not.

[10:53] And look, Stern tested the waters there.

[10:55] That was the most expensive game Stern has ever launched people in the history of Stern Pinball.

[11:00] That is the most expensive MSRP they've ever put on their website for a Pinball machine.

[11:06] And look how it turned out.

[11:08] Look how it turned out.

[11:09] And that just goes to show me they don't know marketing.

[11:12] They don't know what they're doing.

[11:14] And as I watch them right now on this apology tour and now they're going to invite all the Pinball media to shield John Wick.

[11:22] Trust me, people.

[11:23] Don't buy it.

[11:24] Don't buy it.

[11:25] There is not demand for this game.

[11:26] And of course, you're going to go on location and play it and it's fast and it's brutal and it's fun.

[11:31] Every Pinball machine is fun.

[11:33] That is not what we're talking about.

[11:35] It's a toy.

[11:36] It's supposed to be fun.

[11:37] I'm so tired of that being the fallback on everything in this hobby.

[11:40] It needs to be more than just fun for this much money.

[11:44] It needs to be something that you love.

[11:46] It needs to be a theme that you want to put in your home, that you want to wake up.

[11:49] And when you walk by to put a smile on your face, something that has some emotional connection to you.

[11:54] Something that has some nostalgic value to you.

[11:57] If it doesn't, it's not going to work.

[11:59] And that's where it gets really interesting in Pinball because I just put up a theme and I said,

[12:03] which one of these three themes excites you the most?

[12:07] It was Harry Potter.

[12:08] It was the Matrix and it was Pokemon.

[12:10] And coming in in third place is Pokemon.

[12:14] Even though Pokemon is easily the biggest IP out of the three, it goes Pokemon, then Harry Potter, then the Matrix.

[12:23] And even amongst those three, you want to hear the results?

[12:26] The least valuable IP is actually the one with the most excitement.

[12:31] And this is why market research matters.

[12:33] The Matrix has 47% of the votes.

[12:36] Harry Potter has 34% and Pokemon only 19.

[12:40] You got to do this research.

[12:42] You got to ask the community.

[12:44] It's so stupid to me that nobody's doing this.

[12:47] And I mean it when I say it, picking a theme like Labyrinth fine.

[12:50] If you want to make Labyrinth fine, but don't make 1100, you're not going to sell them.

[12:55] They're 400 short.

[12:57] They're not going to sell 400 more.

[13:00] You know, how did they land on 1100?

[13:03] And they probably did it because they're looking at the other games selling during COVID.

[13:07] And they're also probably maybe doing it for business reasons.

[13:10] And it's cheaper to make that many games because they can order more parts in volume.

[13:14] But maybe it would have just been smarter, right?

[13:17] If your barrels of fun to only make 500 of them, just come out of the gate with your first game.

[13:23] Make it more limited.

[13:25] Get excitement building for your brand.

[13:27] Make it so not everyone's going to have one.

[13:29] And then everyone who gets their hands on a Labyrinth has something that holds value and will go up in value.

[13:35] And now they love your company.

[13:37] It's all part of marketing.

[13:39] And it just pains me to see that we're in a hobby in which the company that's just pumping out really the cheapest

[13:46] mass produced product in all of Pimbal, it's Stern.

[13:50] Everybody, they have the lowest bomb in all of Pimbal.

[13:53] They have the cheapest manufacturing because of all their efficiencies.

[13:57] And yet look at where they are priced.

[14:00] It saddens me that they've pushed their prices so high and they're not doing market research.

[14:05] They do the same rinse and repeat.

[14:07] But man, like look at the prices.

[14:09] It's absolutely bonkers.

[14:10] And here's what I want to see happen in Pimbal.

[14:12] I want them to stop with the FOMO launches of every game as being the only way to communicate with us.

[14:18] The only time they can take our money, I would much rather them let us know, here are the games coming out next year.

[14:26] Why can't we know that?

[14:28] Why does it have to be a big mystery?

[14:30] Now maybe Canadian would be out of business.

[14:32] I think it would be more fun for us to know what's coming, to dream about it, to build up our expectations.

[14:38] Then these companies could actually do a longer marketing window to get us excited.

[14:44] This is what's stupid.

[14:45] It's like you're trying to jam in all of it into like a one week period and it doesn't work.

[14:52] I mean, think about how excited each and every one of us are for Back to the Future, right?

[14:57] I've been thinking about Back to the Future for a really long time.

[15:00] And here's the thing, knowing that Back to the Future is down the road is absolutely keeping me from buying

[15:07] what's available right now.

[15:09] Now that's why they don't want you to know what's down the road.

[15:12] But there's a solution to that.

[15:14] Just pick bangers.

[15:16] Only make bangers.

[15:17] If you only make bangers in the pinball world, then you're not going to have to worry about people passing up the current game.

[15:24] Because if the current game is Back to the Future and the next game is Die Hard, guess what?

[15:31] You're going to sell out of all of them.

[15:33] If Stern Pinball made Star Wars A New Hope as a separate game and we knew they were going to make A New Hope and they were going to make Empire Strikes Back and they were going to make Return of the Jedi, all three of them separately, do you think they would have to keep that a secret?

[15:49] If they just had three bangers like that, we're going to buy every single one.

[15:53] And I think that's what it is about pinball lately.

[15:55] It's like there's no market research.

[15:57] Everything's a secret.

[15:58] We have to pull the trigger without enough information and we're tired of it.

[16:02] We're just exhausted by it all and it's not working because when we do pull the trigger now on day one, you're losing like three to four thousand dollars because the only game you need to pull the trigger on, this is also the bonkers part.

[16:15] The only game you need to pull the trigger on on day one is the LE.

[16:19] Why would you run at a premium or pro right away?

[16:22] Unless you're an operator and you need the game to make money off of it, why would you run and buy a John Wick premium when the code needs a year to be complete?

[16:31] And if you just wait like six months, you'll be able to get for the price of John Wick premium a John Wick LE because that's what the LE is going to sell for when it slides down to that premium price.

[16:42] So the whole thing is designed.

[16:43] All of pinball marketing is designed to sell these LEs and CEs and that is why, you know, they destroyed it all.

[16:51] Like all these companies collectively have destroyed the FOMO at these prices and where does it leave us?

[16:57] I think it leaves us in a new territory for all of them.

[17:01] Like looking at George Gomez do this panic attack tour is so funny because they're not used to this.

[17:07] He'd never had to do this before.

[17:09] He has to do it now.

[17:11] And I think every single pinball company should hear this podcast and start to understand marketing now matters and understanding what the true demand is matters more now than it ever has before in the history of pinball.

[17:25] And I think most of these companies are getting it wrong and we can see it because the numbers don't lie.

[17:31] When you see a game that is listed for $11,000 and a year later it's $7,000, you got the demand wrong.

[17:40] A Batman SLE was $15,000.

[17:43] I just sold mine for $28,000.

[17:47] They got the demand right on that game.

[17:50] They got the demand right on Ghostbusters LE, on Tron LE.

[17:55] Now look if they make more of them and they vault all of these valuable games, yeah as George Gomez wants to,

[18:01] best believe Seth Davis and George Gomez wanted to remake everything that was selling for over sticker.

[18:08] They want to.

[18:09] That was their strategy.

[18:10] They were going to keep making anniversary editions just like they did with Jurassic Park,

[18:15] just like they did with Elvira until we said f-off stern, we're not going to take it because you're going to lose all of your loyal customers.

[18:22] The fact that we had to tell them that, it shows me their arrogance.

[18:26] It shows me they're not confident in their future titles and it shows me they think they can do whatever they want regardless of any market research and they got it wrong.

[18:36] So yeah, I want everybody to think about this.

[18:38] I think, you know, I've been thinking a lot about my show and why people listen and how we have over 700 subscribers.

[18:44] I just want to put thoughts into your head that make you think about this hobby differently.

[18:49] I heard someone say recently that wait and see is a toxic message in pinball and I just want to respond to that.

[18:56] If you think waiting and seeing and being patient and using your mind is a toxic thing, then you sir are the problem and anyone who thinks that way is the problem.

[19:08] And I mean it when I say it.

[19:10] The people screaming bye bye bye, they are the problem and they've been a problem for a really long time.

[19:18] And it just goes to show you that the one guy that's telling you not to do that, to think differently, has 710 subscribers and everybody else who's telling you to bye bye bye, all of them added up don't even come to like 400 subscribers.

[19:33] Like it's so funny and it's because what we're saying here is the way we should be thinking about this hobby.

[19:39] It doesn't mean we don't love pinball, it doesn't mean we're not going to buy bye bye, but it means we want to see these companies operate differently and why is that a problem?

[19:47] The only people that should be rooting for Stern to charge as much as they can and make as many games as they can are the investors at Stern.

[19:55] It shouldn't be us.

[19:57] Like anyone acting like an investor at Stern who's not is a moron.

[20:02] Everybody happy Monday.

[20:04] Canada's on paternity leave.

[20:05] You're getting tons of canada content.

[20:07] I love doing this show for you.

[20:09] We're going to be back this week with more to talk about.

[20:11] I'm going to try to go to Jack Barr and actually play this John Wick.

[20:14] Getting some time off is difficult.

[20:17] Cassie is literally sleeping 10 feet from me right now and that is why Brenda's taken a nap.

[20:22] This is how it's going to be for the next like eight weeks.

[20:24] So get ready for a lot of great content.

[20:26] Thank you everybody for the support and you know, if you want to join the raise the roof club, if you feel like you just feel like you're getting more of a support.

[20:33] If you get in more than five dollars worth a month, I would happily love to see more people join the raise the roof club.

[20:40] You know, it's really easy to do.

[20:42] But thank you everybody.

[20:43] I'm never raising the price of this show.

[20:45] It will always be five dollars like 20 years from now.

[20:48] You're still going to be paying five dollars a month for canada's pinball podcast as they wheel me out in a wheelchair.

[20:54] Be like, I remember when pinball was cheap at 15,000 dollars kids.

[20:59] Everybody have a great day.

[21:00] Goodbye.

[21:03] I'm

[22:03] you
