[00:00] I

[00:23] Welcome to episode 252 of the world's greatest super duper extra awesome

[00:29] I'd put a logo out but can't do a podcast in a month head to head coast to coast this weekend pinball

[00:36] Straight down the middle podcast. I'm your host canada. This is gonna be a fun episode

[00:40] We've got a lot that happened this week in the world of pinball

[00:44] We're gonna have maybe a special guest captain obvious Marty from head to head pinball might be joining the show

[00:50] Every once in a while to chime in with some obvious statements

[00:54] So wait for those but we have to talk about the fact that we are at the end of July in the world of pinball and tomorrow

[01:04] Mark's August first now here's what's interesting and we talk a lot about the amount of pinball machines in the pinball market place

[01:13] All right

[01:14] Tomorrow is August first and come August in the entire month

[01:18] I want to read for you the list of pinball machines that are gonna be vying

[01:24] for your

[01:26] Pimball dollars and let's let's not say this industry is not saturated so we've got Alice Cooper's nightmare castle

[01:33] We are going to see and I'm giving you this here on canada's pinball podcast dead pool will be revealed in the month of August

[01:43] That will happen

[01:45] Pirates of the Caribbean is on the production line

[01:49] Monster bash remake is going to be revealed finally iron made and is still hot on the presses the pinball mafia

[01:58] From pinball team pinball that I don't know if they're gonna sell a single one of that

[02:04] Who Dini pinball is still on the line at American pinball

[02:08] Total nuclear annihilation and

[02:10] Thunderbirds and that's not even mentioning all the other new and box games you can go buy from stern

[02:16] And then all of the use games are out there in the market. So what does that mean?

[02:20] It means one thing your game has to be pretty god damn good to find

[02:27] Pinball buyers in 2018 all right

[02:30] But let me back up a little bit because there's a lot of games and it's a good time to be in pinball

[02:34] I mean, I think we're all excited that there are so many pinball machines

[02:38] Available in the pinball world and look if you're gonna buy one of these games

[02:43] What are you gonna buy hey Marty? Which one are you gonna buy you gonna buy a stern if I want to stand?

[02:47] Oh, I'll get another stone. Okay, cool. Marty. It's your prerogative man

[02:51] All right, so before I go into the main news item this week

[02:54] Which is Alice Cooper's nightmare castle Jack Danger and dead flip they went over to Benton with continent streamed it for us last night

[03:01] I'm gonna give you my thoughts on the good the bad and the ugly of what I saw yesterday

[03:05] I just want to say that on my last podcast. I seem to have ruffled some feathers when I said that there aren't many

[03:11] Unbiased pinball reviewers out there in the world and that when people have to go buy a machine

[03:17] We really don't have a lot of information to go on if we haven't played the games at the show now

[03:23] I want to do a little Miyako pin say look I I didn't mention straight down the middle

[03:29] Podcasts and and YouTube channel that does great pinball reviews and Greg and Zach over there you guys know who they are

[03:36] I didn't attack them personally and what I was saying was

[03:41] Basically in all other entertainment industries right movies video games you name it automotive

[03:47] There are usually a lot of

[03:51] Media channels that will give us a review before we have to go

[03:56] Hand over our money and it's really hard to get that in pinball and I didn't mean to take anything away from that show

[04:01] I watched that show. I think the show is great

[04:04] It's probably the best in-depth review of pinball machines that we get the challenge in pinball

[04:10] Is this and this is the reality?

[04:12] It's really hard to be unbiased because if you're gonna slam a game and you're gonna say the honest truth about a game

[04:20] There is a very good chance that a lot of manufacturers will just stop talking to you that they won't get back to you

[04:27] So you know, it's one thing if you're gonna say something you know somewhat

[04:31] Constructively criticizing stern games. I think they'll still communicate with you

[04:35] But when you get a company like American pinball and you say like in a you know, I'm

[04:40] I'm down on Houdini. I don't think it shoots very well. I don't think the layout's great if I say that

[04:46] You know what happens Josh Kugler and an American pinball people they stop responding to my emails

[04:52] They don't want to come on the show they simply just ignore

[04:56] My entire podcast the same thing happens with Stern. I mean look at me. I think I'm pretty

[05:02] I'm pretty fair on all of my pinball assessments and Stern just blacklist me yet

[05:08] They'll let everyone over there go on to the other podcast and that's that's simply because this is the only one

[05:14] That doesn't hold punches and and and that's just the way we do it

[05:18] So but look I appreciate what those guys do and I just wish we could get more

[05:24] reviews of games

[05:26] Before people are asked to pay for their money now. That's a good segue into

[05:31] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and the dead flip stream because for a lot of people out there

[05:36] This was the first time we've actually seen extended gameplay footage of this game and we saw the reveal of this game at Tp app

[05:45] Which was a few months ago and now we're finally seeing more and more of the code because when the game was showing at Tp

[05:52] After really was no code it was very Spartan

[05:55] It was actually a really weird time to reveal the game

[05:58] I don't think Chuck should have revealed it then I think it makes no sense to pull the curtain off of a game when your code is so early on

[06:05] But for some reason he wanted to do it

[06:07] I think he was trying to get ahead of a lot of other games that were supposed to be revealed at the same time because he would have got lost and

[06:13] Iron Maiden and Monster Bash remake, but anyway, that's all water under the bridge

[06:18] So July 30th we finally get to see extended footage of

[06:24] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle now. Let me give you my thoughts on the stream

[06:28] The good the bad and the ugly alright, so here let's start with the good

[06:33] I think the animations on this game are

[06:37] Stellar I think spooky and team have done an amazing job

[06:41] creating animations this sort of cartoon

[06:44] comic book style artwork that actually reflects the artwork that is on the cabinet and the play field

[06:51] I just want to say I think that's great and I think it looks really good and I think it's one of the best

[06:59] Animations I've seen on a new pinball machine so kudos for all the hard work that went into that

[07:04] I think the light showing on the game is also awesome. I think during the different modes

[07:09] I was loving the visual light show effect that takes place on the game and that also

[07:15] Leath me to the art and the sculpts and the overall appearance of this game

[07:19] I mean if you look down on this game if you were to put

[07:23] America's most honoured Rob Zombie and then Alice Cooper's nightmare castle

[07:28] I think it's hard to deny that they are progressing significantly in

[07:35] creating a visually stunning game and I think this is easily the best looking spooky game by far

[07:42] I would put this game next to any other

[07:45] Manufacturer games out there and it does it does hold

[07:50] You know it's own when it comes to art and display so that I think is another awesome thing

[07:56] The music in the game the music in the game is really great for pinball

[08:00] I mean I am not the biggest Alice Cooper fan, but I have to say there were so many songs in this game

[08:07] That were just fun and campy and have the perfect energy for pinball and I can see why they wanted to make an Alice Cooper pinball machine

[08:15] There was this one song. I don't even know the name of it. It was so quirky like

[08:19] Bowen was like holding the flip when they were all just like dancing for like 25 minutes or like 20 minutes do it

[08:25] It was awesome like it was like that kind of fun campy music is exactly what pinball needs

[08:30] All right, I actually think this music is much better than iron maiden music. I still can't

[08:34] Warm up to iron maiden music. I can't the magnets save in this game is freaking awesome

[08:41] Like the ball goes down the outline and then the magnet grabs and throws it back up

[08:45] I just thought that is exactly what more and more pinball machines need

[08:51] It's not the first time it's been done in a game. I think it was in golden eye

[08:55] But also a very very cool thing to watch all right, so I thought the game you know that's the good that is the good

[09:01] Let's get to the bed. I

[09:03] Think the call outs in this game still to me are really head scratching because it just sounds like Alice Cooper is

[09:10] Talking in this boring fashion and I know that

[09:12] Shucking company said well, that's how he like talks when he does certain things

[09:16] I know that but you've got a direct him better

[09:19] You've got to tell him like look this is a pinball machine and pinball machines need call outs are much more energetic

[09:26] And what to me the the biggest issue was like his mundane way of doing the call outs

[09:31] Just clashes with the high energy of his voice when he's singing and I really think they should have had him be more of an

[09:38] Energetic MC throughout the game and not such a mundane sort of style, but that is that

[09:45] The other bad I have here and this is probably the thing that I will talk the most about

[09:50] It's just the layout of the game and I still think that this game

[09:56] Has a lot of tight shots. I mean we see it in the stream left and right

[10:01] These are some of the best players out there in pinball and it's just brick brick brick brick brick

[10:06] You know and you know, I don't know is it just me or is it maybe it's because the shots are not where I expect them to be

[10:14] Marty are the shots where you expect them to be you need to adjust your play style because these shots aren't where you expect them to be

[10:30] But there's no denying that this opens the door for probably one of the biggest debates about this game

[10:36] And it's not just this game. I think this game and Houdini have really got people debating on

[10:44] tight shots

[10:46] Versus fun tight shots versus frustrating and tight shots when it comes to long-term playability of the game

[10:53] And here's where it's always breaking down for me is I keep hearing people like Roto Dave on another one of his who gives a shit

[11:00] Odyssey's always saying the same thing is the shots are tight, but they're makeable

[11:05] We always hear that they're tight, but they're makeable and I'm so sick of that freaking freeze like okay

[11:11] What shut up like when people say that?

[11:13] I just wish we could slap them in the freaking face. They're tight, but makeable. Here's the reality as I want you guys to ask

[11:19] Yourselves the best pinball machines of all time the best pinball designers of all time the best pinball games of all time

[11:29] Do they have a lot of really tight shots?

[11:32] Does George Gomez design games with tons of tight shots that are frustrating does Pat Lawler do that?

[11:38] Right did John Papa Duke do that? No, we go on the list of like the best games like Monster Bash medieval madness

[11:47] You know Twilight Zone, you know these games Adams family the shots are makeable pinball is hard enough

[11:53] It is hard enough that you don't need to put

[11:57] Tight shot next to tight shot next to tight shot because I really do I really do think when you make a game

[12:03] Where it's just brick brick brick brick brick brick and the feeling when you play it is that you got more lucky

[12:10] Then you did you know then you utilize your skill

[12:14] You're not gonna enjoy it. You're not gonna enjoy it now. Look. I'm not saying that this game is like a

[12:20] Brick fest that you won't enjoy because I haven't played it

[12:23] I just have an observation from watching the stream that they designed the game too tight

[12:29] And I think if they had eliminated one shot and

[12:32] Opened up each shot just a little bit more you'd get much more flow because that's the takeaway

[12:39] I got when I was watching the stream is it feels like this isn't a game with flow because the game the balls always

[12:45] Bricking back at you or rattling around in the in wherever the shot is you're trying to hit

[12:51] And there's not like it's not like a trap and shoot kind of game and that to me is like when you're designing a pinball machine

[12:59] I think you need to make a decision like what kind of game do you want to be and

[13:04] I just I don't know the solution. I'm part of me looks at the game and and I kind of felt this way when I first played it

[13:11] Was there so many post

[13:14] Instead of targets where each shot is and so when you miss your shot

[13:18] You don't hit a target you just hit a post

[13:21] Which is not rewarding and that's the other part is at least they should have made those posts into targets and at least had

[13:29] Misses still means something and and and and and it just doesn't all right

[13:35] But look look if you're someone out there like

[13:38] Rodo Dave who's so goddamn good and he'll get rid of a pin if it's too easy because then it's moving on to the next home

[13:44] He really likes it tough and hard and you know tight shots

[13:49] If you're someone who wants a game to be really challenging

[13:53] Then you'll like this game. I mean it's not easy. We saw some of the best players on it

[13:58] You know struggling to get through at certain times

[14:01] Yes over time you will learn how to shoot a game

[14:05] I mean on your first plunge you're not going to be a master of this game

[14:09] But I think that for the most part and I think most of you out there

[14:15] Pimball is hard enough to keep the ball alive to get through the game to get through the code

[14:21] You know you've got to get to all these monsters in the castle

[14:24] It's hard enough that you don't want the game to constantly be punishing you

[14:30] Because the shots are overly tight and that's just my assessment on pinball

[14:33] I don't like games that are way too tight and are always breaking the ball back all right

[14:39] All right the other thing in terms of this is not bad

[14:42] This is just an observation is the castle covers like a third of the play field

[14:46] I always feel like the ball is disappearing in this game like it's going underneath this monstrosity castle and all these

[14:53] plastics and you're always losing

[14:56] Your ability to see where the ball is

[14:59] And you know if you look at a game like monster bash or a game like any this you know

[15:03] Iron maid is a good example

[15:05] You never lose where the ball is like you're always watching it and it's trajectory

[15:09] I think that losing sight of the ball does break up

[15:13] Some of the enjoyment all right. Let's go on to the ugly the ugly was there were technical issues at the beginning of the dead flip stream

[15:20] And apparently they had just put new code into the game and I hear that machine was built that day

[15:26] So not only was the machine crashing when they first did the stream

[15:30] But there was also a problem with one of the flippers that kept cutting out and and I heard I see it was weird to me because I

[15:38] Almost forgot they were streaming this and I went on later at night

[15:41] I think it was like almost like 9 9 30 and I was shocked to see it was still live

[15:46] So apparently there was almost like an hour delay

[15:49] So for those of you who tuned in at the very beginning you were met with nothing but technical difficulties

[15:55] Which has now led them to not upload the stream because they don't want people to see the technical difficulties that occurred

[16:04] Now look this is a brand new game brand new code

[16:07] They probably should not have put up a game that they didn't test

[16:12] You know for a few days to make sure everything is kosher with it

[16:16] I talk a lot about pinball marketing. You know me and again like this is just like a rookie mistake like you don't

[16:23] Put something out there in the world that you haven't tested if this is gonna be people's first experience

[16:28] With seeing your hard work

[16:31] But again, I don't fault them. I don't think it's like a big deal

[16:34] I don't think people out there will fault them. There was like 400 people watching this stream live

[16:39] Okay, 400 which is a little bit less than the amount of games

[16:43] They're actually gonna make and we know like 399 of those people are coming from pin-side

[16:48] People know pinball they know this company. They know this is still a prototype

[16:53] They know this game is not gonna go in a box. They know Charlie's not gonna ship you broken machines

[16:58] Spooky's had a great track record of shipping games that work

[17:02] So I don't think anyone is gonna is gonna be like oh no like their quality's gone to shit

[17:07] I don't think any that's gonna happen. I'm also sad they're not uploading the stream because they they had a lot of fun

[17:12] They had a lot of fun playing this game. There's a lot of great moments that outweigh the bad moments

[17:18] So I think it's unfortunate that people who missed it aren't gonna be able to see that all right

[17:24] All right, let me give my overall opinion about the game my overall opinion is this

[17:28] This is the best looking best looking spooky pin by far

[17:31] I still think design is spooky's weakest point. I think they now have

[17:37] Rit like raise the bar on their animations on their artwork

[17:42] I still think the design is the Achilles heel of this company and I still think Charlie should take a back seat to design and let

[17:49] Someone else design games because I just don't think the design is on the same level of the rest of the games and

[17:57] It's almost like the design is holding these games back from being great

[18:02] And I know that's hard thing for him to probably do

[18:06] But I just think they need to get better design to complement the rest of the stuff

[18:11] Which is really in my opinion advanced over at spooky and

[18:16] artwork this my other opinion artwork continues to be

[18:20] Almost like the most important thing you need to sell a pinball machine

[18:23] Oh even more than design and I think my overall assessment of this hobby is that's that's unfortunate and that's kind of tragic

[18:32] That these games are now

[18:34] Being sold simply because they're beautiful even if they don't shoot well and I'm sad

[18:39] I'm sad that that's the case. I'm sad that

[18:42] Whitewoods and making sure the whitewood shoots buttery smooth before you ever even put art on it before you ever

[18:50] Even reveal the game to the world you should have a buttery smooth whitewood game that is just an amazing game to shoot

[18:57] I don't think we're I think we've like gone in a different direction

[19:01] I think it's like you know who cares like we'll figure all that out

[19:05] Just put some nice artwork on it and people will be like, you know

[19:08] They'll be visually blown away and they'll buy the game

[19:10] So that's unfortunate

[19:12] I also think like one of the options this game should come with that would guarantee it's fun

[19:18] Is if when you buy it in a box?

[19:20] There's four dudes that stand behind you drinking beer saying whoa

[19:25] Every time you hit a shot because when you were watching this stream

[19:29] I just couldn't help but laugh. It's like

[19:31] Plague Pimble for most of us is not like that. They were all crowded around like cheering like crazy every time like

[19:38] All the ball was locked or a mode started you remove all of that surrounding fanfare and it will the game be as exciting

[19:46] But whoa

[19:48] We'll see we'll see

[19:50] All right, what else okay? So my final opinion about this game is

[19:55] You know it couldn't come out at a worst time and what I mean by that is

[20:02] Monster Bash remake is literally going to be revealed

[20:07] The same month this game is going to start shipping and I I

[20:12] Literally don't think I've seen two themes that are pretty much exactly the same you've got monsters

[20:18] You've got castles

[20:20] You've got this spooky theme the only difference is in monster bash

[20:27] You are physically interacting with all the monsters and you're bashing them and it's there's so much more

[20:34] Happening in the toy department than there is an Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[20:39] We're an Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[20:41] Most of the interaction with the monsters is all taking place on the LCD screen and monster bash is one of the greatest Pimble machines of all time

[20:50] And so now they're both coming out at the same time now I hear people I can already hear people saying well Chris

[20:56] What are you talking about like spooky only has to sell 500?

[21:00] They're probably already all spoken for and that's that and I think those people are wrong

[21:07] I don't think they're all spoken for and when both games are available at the same time

[21:14] I don't think people are going to buy both and

[21:18] Which game is better is where I think the money will go and I think it's gonna be really tough for this game

[21:26] To be better than monster bash remake and

[21:30] It's and I know the prices are a little bit different

[21:33] But when you start adding in all the stuff that you can get on your spooky machine

[21:38] The price starts to get really close together

[21:40] So we'll see how it goes and and then throwing another monkey wrench into this is that we all know that monsters is coming out

[21:49] In October November and monsters looks incredible

[21:54] So you've got three

[21:56] Very spooky themed games coming out all at the same time

[22:00] I really am curious to see what happens with people's spooky deposits and whether or not

[22:06] Everyone is gonna stay in on it some people are gonna want to get out and we've never had an experience where people are locked in with their

[22:14] $1,000 non-refundable deposits so it's gonna be interesting

[22:18] I don't think Chuck would have wanted this game to come out in August against monster bash remake

[22:24] I just don't think that was the ideal time now look

[22:28] It's also interesting to me that all these games are coming out in August like I said

[22:31] August is a terrible month to bring any product to market it's the summertime people have been spending money all summer

[22:38] They've been traveling it's not a time when people get tax returns

[22:41] It's just a really kind of like a dead time of year to launch a product like no one else launches

[22:48] Halo products or milestone products in August except you know pinballs just a little bit of an odd world kind of device

[22:55] So we'll see all right. Let's go on so the big Lebowski

[22:58] The big Lebowski on pinside now has a private

[23:03] Early achiever owner thread and what that means is all the early achievers now can go talk amongst themselves in a private place

[23:12] Where no one else can chime in and and distract them and so what this means is I can't see what they're saying and neither can you unless you are in on this

[23:21] They do this so that these guys can actually have

[23:25] constructive

[23:26] Dialogue without having all the other trolls chiming in every day and just making fun of them

[23:33] So we'll see what's gonna happen. You know how I feel about this whole thing

[23:36] I think the big Lebowski is as dead as it gets and these guys will keep giving each other

[23:43] hopeful hand jobs trying to get their games, but I don't think they're gonna get anything anytime soon all right

[23:49] Also in the alien threads which it's funny to me that the big Lebowski and alien threads keep popping up to the top of

[23:56] Pinside and both these games are as dead as they get

[24:01] Alien threads are all the same. This is what everyone is like it's basically the following hey guys

[24:07] I've got my alien it breaks every single day

[24:11] But it's still the best game ever and when it's working. It's awesome, but it's never really working

[24:15] I love it. You know like that's all it is. It's just gonna become a troubleshooting thread forever

[24:23] All right, let's talk about JJP and pirates

[24:26] Pirates is on the production line. There's nothing else to say we're waiting for the game to come out and

[24:31] It looks like it will ship very soon and I look forward

[24:35] To hearing what people think about pirates the Caribbean

[24:38] I would love for someone who gets one early on to come on the show and talk about their experience with the machine

[24:43] I would love that so if you are getting a pirates early on

[24:47] Email me at canada pinball at gmo.com and let's talk all right. Let's see. I want to congratulate

[24:54] Keith L. Win for winning at pinburg now

[24:58] We don't talk about tournament play. We don't care about tournament play

[25:01] But he won and I think it's awesome that he took the title

[25:05] It's great to see the guy who's one of the best pinball players in the world is also designing

[25:09] What is being heralded as probably the best pinball machine of 2018 so

[25:14] Congrats Keith and for those of you don't know

[25:18] Pinburg is the pinball tournament

[25:20] That takes place at replay fx now if you don't know what replay fx is let's ask captain obvious Marty Marty

[25:29] What is replay fx replay fx is a gaming?

[25:33] Conventions

[25:39] We can do the whole team

[25:47] All right a gaming convention. Thanks Marty um, okay, so that happened over the weekend and it just awesome to see all those pins all those

[25:54] Arcade games lined up everybody has a good time at these shows and

[25:59] Speaking of replay effects and pinball it was actually one of the first times a lot of people got to hop on

[26:05] Thunderbirds and I was reading the thread and I have to say you know

[26:08] I talked to Joe and he gave his assessment of how well built thunderbirds is

[26:13] But I man the reviews I got from people the unbiased reviews of people who have no skin in the game

[26:21] We're not good. We're not good. I mean when people say a pinball machine is like a dog

[26:26] They don't mean it like in a cuddly dog that's man's best friend. They mean it like a dog

[26:33] You know and so

[26:35] It just sounds like even though it's the same price point as a stern pro

[26:40] I'm not hearing people say they want one or that it holds up to the fun factor or even the build quality of a stern pro

[26:47] So uh not looking good not looking good for a game that people have waited five years for all right

[26:55] All right, let's see we're like a half hour

[26:57] We're like a half hour and look how much

[27:00] Pinball stuff we've covered they just ridiculous these podcasts have to go like an hour and a half two hours

[27:06] To talk about pinball because I don't have someone next to me just repeating everything I say I just give it all to you straight

[27:13] In conclusion because I got to run new a meeting

[27:15] I want to say that

[27:17] It is a really exciting time to be in pinball. There are lots of games out there for your money

[27:21] I think sometimes when you go down a list like I did it's kind of scary to see how many games are available

[27:26] Neal inbox that you can go get

[27:28] I think people are also realizing that there's so many good use games that they can go get

[27:33] But it's a great time to be in pinball and in

[27:37] August we are going to see Deadpool we are going to get pirate to the Caribbean

[27:43] It's gonna be a good time to hop on machines and see if you like them in closing because I know we you know

[27:48] We we talk about these games looking at machines through you know twitch streams and YouTube videos

[27:54] Ultimately everybody everybody knows this you got to jump on this machine and play it if you if you play

[28:00] Out of this Cooper's nightmare castle and you love it and you buy it and you enjoy it

[28:05] That is all that matters if you like a game with really tight shots. That is all that matters

[28:10] There is a lid for everybody's trash can right there is a game for you out there and it's it's what makes pinball great

[28:19] You know different strokes for different folks. We don't have to personally attack each other

[28:25] If we have differences of opinions about pinball machines all right for me personally

[28:30] I think this is a good year

[28:32] To just hold on to your money and wait to see where these games all net out because there are so many machines coming

[28:40] That I just don't want to go run and buy any of them and I also have the advantage of living in New York City where I can go play almost everything

[28:48] On locations so I don't feel the need to own these things

[28:52] Um, but for those of you out there

[28:54] I hope you get time on pirates and Alice Cooper's nightmare castle pretty soon

[28:59] And I hope you make sure you want this game before you buy it because there there is just a lot a lot to consider

[29:07] With buying pinball nowadays because of how many machines are coming out in 2018 all right everyone
