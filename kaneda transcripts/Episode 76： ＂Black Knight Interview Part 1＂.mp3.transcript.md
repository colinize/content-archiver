[00:00] No one ever told me when I was alone they just thought I'd know better, better

[00:16] Welcome to episode 76 of Canada's Pinball Podcast and I chose the song for this podcast

[00:25] to be Guns and Roses better off of Chinese democracy and the reason why is we're going to interview the black night on this episode and the next episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:38] It's gonna be a two-parter because we talked for a while

[00:42] but better

[00:43] is such a fitting song because

[00:47] Christopher Thompson, Chris Thompson the black night

[00:50] He's been in this hobby now for almost three decades and for so many of us out there

[00:57] I think he has so much valuable information to share and we take a look at this hobby and what's been going on over the last six months

[01:05] And we talk about it. We talk about price increases

[01:08] We talk about what we think is gonna happen with all these different manufacturers

[01:12] We talk about what 2016 delivered and what we expect in 2017

[01:17] And I'll say this I'll say this the

[01:21] the words he he uses and the information he has is something everyone should listen to because

[01:28] History does repeat itself and in any collectors hobby things go in cycles and you know

[01:35] I always love watching the black night on pinsob because he's often

[01:39] Ignored in a way. He has all this great information and people don't take the time to read what he's saying

[01:45] So I think the podcast is a great format for him to articulate his wisdom

[01:49] for all of you out there

[01:52] You know say this

[01:53] The hobby might seem like it's going through this period of super high prices and and if you can look at this hobby through the new and box

[02:01] Lens or as we do in this interview

[02:04] You can start to see that pinball is still alive and well and pinball can still be heavily enjoyed

[02:10] Without a lot of money and that's gonna be a key takeaway as you listen to this interview

[02:15] So without further ado sit back get some whiskey

[02:20] light the fireplace

[02:22] Relax put your feet up and enjoy this great two-part interview

[02:28] All right ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome back to canada's pinball podcast the black night

[02:34] Uh, it was his birthday a few days ago

[02:38] So we want to say happy-blaided birthday Chris welcome back to the show

[02:41] Cool as you should have called your first episode like you know life beyond pinball

[02:46] probably

[02:49] It works really well because I think he had some good wisdom and and if people kind of took that step back

[02:55] They definitely have a

[02:57] Happier well, I think they have a happier life. That's me. Yeah, it was it was good to take a break

[03:02] You know, I think I mean I love the hobby but but taking a break from especially from the forum

[03:08] I've been just reading up a lot too about

[03:10] Internet addictions and the endorphins that are released when we you know, it's it's an addictive

[03:15] Behavior going on to forms and just getting excited when you see people respond to your comment

[03:20] And it's never ending cycle and it was good. They just turn it off for two months. Especially for trolls

[03:26] Trolls love that. That's they did a site. You're right. They did like some psychological

[03:31] Analysis for online trolls and stuff. I think I got everybody pegged though

[03:35] I'm a much happier guy on pinsoid now. Yeah, no, it's good

[03:40] So for the listeners of the show we you know and the black night and I we've gone back and forth and over different topics in pinball

[03:48] Some great history lessons we went in deep into the the big bang bar

[03:54] But we we wanted to talk on this episode about the market over the last six months two year and a lot of interesting stuff has been going on

[04:02] And Chris, let's just kick it off like

[04:05] What what are your thoughts on what's been going on? You know, we've seen stern cell 15,000 dollar machines. We've seen

[04:13] A lot of manufacturers out there

[04:16] Some of them are hitting their dates some are missing their dates. There's also just the whole world of

[04:20] Of titles that are just out there that are that are used you know, the market has begun to stall a little bit. I'm seeing titles

[04:27] You know, even like people trying to sell Game of Thrones LEDs or not even moving for $6,000

[04:32] What do you think is going on in the market right now with pinball?

[04:36] Well, we can break this into two parts because part of it is what you've already covered

[04:41] Several times and the light I haven't fully caught up with all your episodes

[04:45] There's like a flurry since the first year and so I mean

[04:49] I just don't have the chance

[04:50] But I did catch a few of them and one was the last one you did with the special guest

[04:54] I believe we're no the one before that and I can kind of capture because my perspective is more from the older

[05:02] More senior collector perspective and of course a lot of us are kind of like chuckling and stuff

[05:06] But it this will kind of summarize some of the things that you

[05:12] We're talking about from the perspective of

[05:15] Man new manufacturers or how we stood

[05:19] Up to this point in 2016 because it white it started off really is a really good year

[05:24] You know being the shining star was Ghostbusters. We all know that right and then it kind of the at the end

[05:29] It just you know the the balloon popped because you just didn't see any of the

[05:34] You know revelations that they were coming about to so when you look at the new manufacturers

[05:39] I've wrote some articles some people liked them some people didn't

[05:42] But if you look at all the manufacturers minus p3

[05:46] This is a really quick summary and it kind of supports what you've already done because your observations are accurate

[05:52] So you basically have one manufacturer that's trying to monopolize them

[05:55] I'm not going to use names

[05:56] Well, let the you know listeners figure it out. They they probably will

[06:00] I mean this is kind of important

[06:02] But one manufacturer's trying to monopolize the market and force out competition order retainer supremacy

[06:08] Okay, and that doesn't mean there are like odds from like there are war

[06:12] But they don't really want competition because if they have competition

[06:17] That means there's no real benefit to the the industry from the market standpoint because you basically get continued higher prices

[06:24] A less a less of a new title selection and eventually a quicker stall to the current market

[06:29] That's what happens

[06:30] But it mac and maximizes the financial benefit and profit for an individual company which hey it

[06:37] I'll just give you hint the the manufacturers name starts with s. Okay, so

[06:42] Sticky pinball

[06:44] Yeah, well, there's only a couple but I'll let you figure it out

[06:47] But then you know then you've got the next manufacturer is trying to capitalize exclusively the high end buyers

[06:53] And there's only a limited market for that

[06:55] But that's that market they're trying to capture

[06:58] The the problem with that is a there's only a living to a number of buyers

[07:02] be

[07:03] There's no

[07:05] long-term health that comes from building these in terms of expansion

[07:10] I'm looking at it from this expansion of the industry right the health of the industry

[07:14] When you have sell such low numbers of games

[07:18] You and you can't get that reach out towards the general population and you're and you're tailor fitting it to

[07:25] You know wealthy people that buy these machines for their house and you never see them out in the public eye except maybe example for the pinball mecca's

[07:33] Because for example, we have two Batman LEs

[07:37] One is in Portland and one is in Seattle already

[07:41] But they're in a location that supports the one dollar play

[07:46] Mm-hmm. She can't get that everywhere else or you can't get that market that interest in the people

[07:51] So that's a that's the second manufacturer

[07:54] Then you have the next manufacturer is trying to develop machine titles that are original

[07:59] In order to find its place in industry, but still maintain them to be affordable

[08:04] Now yeah, that's spooky. Okay, that's spooky and then okay

[08:08] So now you have another manufacturer that's trying to produce enough machines to remain profitable at all

[08:15] And unlimited numbers and we're not even sure they can do it

[08:19] You know hint their name starts with a D

[08:22] You know, so and then we have another manufacturer that's trying to simply not the clear bankruptcy is a struggle financially to build their second machine

[08:31] Which is not entirely ready

[08:33] Okay, we I think you've talked quite a bit about them and their name starts with H

[08:38] See I'm not gonna use names anymore because that way I don't get all like everybody's like oh

[08:42] You're just wrong and these are all these predictions

[08:45] Yeah, I mean we know who we're talking. I mean if you it's

[08:49] So that that's that's sort of yeah, I mean that's sort of where we're at

[08:52] So and then there's the last one it doesn't have any footing whatsoever

[08:56] They went back to the drawing board with premature they're not ready and they don't have to develop them for machine

[09:00] Unless they build one that was already designed poorly which we know doesn't entirely work anyway

[09:06] So it that that if you look at that what I'm trying to say is if you look at them

[09:10] The industry not the market

[09:13] That's kind of where we stand as we move into 2017 and out of those what one two three four five six companies not counting

[09:21] P3 you've got two that have the potential to be gone

[09:26] Within the middle of the year could if they're not successful because we all know

[09:32] Other than stern there really isn't any other company that can absorb

[09:37] The if if they're next title fails

[09:40] They can't absorb the losses very easily. Do you Chris do you have a number?

[09:45] Is there a ballpark of how many machines the company has to sell

[09:49] Oh, I have to solve least a thousand and or if they're in order if you're gonna do the development of a machine today

[09:55] That if you're gonna actually do a design of a game from from scratch would still take so over a year

[10:00] And you put the development dollars into the game properly

[10:04] You've got to sell at least a thousand machines to even get a marginal basis of profit

[10:09] Because I had another discussion with people which of course everybody wanted to like prove it

[10:14] You know, I get so tired of prove it prove it prove it prove

[10:17] I mean if you go into all sorts of nauseating detail they say too long didn't read so

[10:22] That's like right once again, how do you how do you win? You know my point is is

[10:26] Learn to read and that equals education if you don't want to read then you're not gonna be educated

[10:31] But you know the baseline for the for the construction cost of a pinball machine

[10:37] In a premium nature is somewhere between 45

[10:41] hundred and five thousand dollars for I mean everything included and that includes if they're you've got a license theme

[10:48] And all those provisions and overheads and parts supplies, you know, and so whatever you're charging for it

[10:55] Marit minus any type of like

[10:58] You know oddities like overheads or or cost that are not anticipated such as well. I don't know rejected playfields

[11:05] Um, you know all that stuff has to be considered in so if you're not selling at least a thousand games

[11:11] You're not making hardly any money. You're just not now unless now here's the caveat

[11:17] Unless you sell a super le or le for an extraordinary more money than it was originally built

[11:24] That's how you get around it right so someone like John pop it is initial intent

[11:29] To sell something for 16 grand a title if you can get the button right if you can get the

[11:34] Bomb around

[11:36] 4,000 I don't think how I don't know how he could do it

[11:38] I mean we all know that that you know American pinball is gonna lose money

[11:41] I mean, this is just another kind of like big bang bar over again, right?

[11:44] Because the parts alone in the cost or the redesign to make that machine work

[11:49] It's not gonna work if there's only 25 bill right yeah, and that machine will never

[11:55] Make anyone any money it will never they in a true economy. It's failed. It's failed for six years in a row

[12:03] um

[12:03] It's a good status symbol for American pinball to say hey that I mean that's

[12:08] Probably one of the reasons they considered you know obviously taking it on because

[12:12] It's a it's a it builds a good name for himself if they can pull it off they can say look

[12:16] We did what he couldn't do and look at the quality of this product and you know

[12:21] That's not a flagship model their flagship model of course would be the game after that which we know is the redesign of you needy

[12:27] Right, I mean, that's how you make it work. I mean you're marketing you know that how it's like they they did it

[12:32] When they talk about the company it put them on the map right everyone knows who they are not exactly the way I would have

[12:39] So they put them so

[12:42] Uh, yeah, we're associated with John poverty. Yeah, well also they amount of money they pumped into it

[12:48] They could have taken out a full page ad in the New York Times

[12:51] Yeah, probably five five full page ads, so

[12:55] I'll put it down worked in a market see the the biggest challenge and the reason we talk about numbers of of construction is that

[13:02] Everybody keeps forgetting if you take your step outside of this world we call pinball

[13:08] And you say it all the time. It's like what's pinball

[13:12] It's it's still niche even though and this is a little fact for people who don't know this since 2010

[13:19] The the hobby of pinball every year is grown in average between 25 and 30% of new buyers

[13:25] Every year since 2010 it's been on the growth

[13:29] And and that's huge for a niche industry to back in the 2000s or even the 90s nobody had a pinball so

[13:35] You know, but if you you can put shit in and you know the New York Times you can put it in magazines

[13:42] But for the most part the general public is gonna say we don't care. They still don't and they won't

[13:48] It until until you have a chicken in every pot. That means like a pinball machine in every house

[13:53] It's probably not gonna happen. It's gonna remain niche

[13:57] It I couldn't agree more. I mean I I think what a lot of people who are in the hobby and in on the forums

[14:05] They think it's so much bigger than it is and every once in a while someone to be like guys

[14:10] Yes, like 20 of us get together and play pinball at a bar

[14:15] But go to a cars and coffee

[14:18] In around around America and there's hundreds and thousands of people every weekend

[14:22] Engaged, you know, so it's it's it's well

[14:26] People that like to play pinball, but that doesn't mean they own pinball there. That's that's it's apples and oranges

[14:32] I mean it I mean granted there's a lot of people that would like to own a pinball

[14:37] But the problem is is you know and we'll get probably into it some more as we talk about pricing

[14:42] You know not not prices of machines. We don't need to really go entirely into that unless you've got a you know question

[14:48] But yeah, it the reality is of course, you know, and I'll talk about the market and in regards to price rising and so on and so on

[14:56] You want to get into that or whatever other question. Yeah, let's talk about that. I mean because this year in particular

[15:02] And especially at Expo we saw a

[15:06] price increase like never before across the board. I mean stern as the mass market producer

[15:12] You know, they really I mean right now right now stern pinball

[15:16] We'll let you buy a machine all the way from $5,200 for an Aerospace Pro all the way to $15,000

[15:24] For a batman SLE

[15:27] ostensibly the same product really. I mean there's a

[15:31] I like the pro you talked about the pro

[15:34] Aerospace versus the premium with the mini playbook that reminded me of just as a shameless plug

[15:40] It kind of reminded me of the Simpson Spinball party couch with the elevator because I'm sure the balls get locked in there

[15:46] But the pro had the one that goes up and down the big one and I kind of like that one better

[15:50] I mean, I'm an Aerospace fan, but I'm not gonna buy it, but I kind of like the pro

[15:55] Let me say to greet it's a great with where everything's going

[15:59] 5200 for a machine with that kind of artwork on it

[16:03] And LCD screen is standard, you know, it's standard. It's it's a great buy

[16:10] I I think it seems to be I mean I did like the art package and I think most people will I mean I I think once again

[16:17] I don't hate stern. I mean I'm not

[16:19] I'm not an anti-stern person. I mean, I'm even wearing a stern t-shirt right now, but it's it's the the biggest problem that people get wrapped into is and I and I this is kind of goes under the same thing that you've talked before when it comes to stern my biggest quom

[16:36] As a senior collector in an old guy is bang for the buck and when they remove features from a game

[16:43] Because people they can get away with it and then they charge more that's a problem. I mean, let's look at it

[16:49] People did not realize this I went on to one single Batman thread

[16:55] I think a wall back ago and I said did you know and this is like right after the features were released

[17:01] Because people weren't paying real close attention to the you know that massive spreadsheet that stern does and they're not even getting a real back glass on a super elite

[17:09] Now they got trans lights. They didn't even get a real button. No no mirrored back glass

[17:15] I mean not even a back glass at all they just get their three trans lights. I'm sorry

[17:21] Three plastic trans lights. I don't care if the artwork is different or not does not equal a proper

[17:28] mirrored

[17:29] Back glass it just does it and it's just another cost saving measures that stern can go as well. We can reduce the cost because it does cost a lot of money

[17:38] I mean ask classic play field reproductions

[17:40] Making real back glasses is not a cheap process. It's not never has been fact. It's kind of a dying process and only a few people know how to do it

[17:49] But you know that that to me is cheap if you're gonna do a $15,000 game

[17:53] You don't even guy give a guy a back glass. I mean what the fuck? I mean

[17:57] Doesn't make any sense to me

[17:59] So well you also get a standard piece of glass. They didn't even give you it in busy glass or pdi glass

[18:06] That's where you know you Jersey jack pinball's got kind of that leg up because he's got some other things like the rad cows and in

[18:12] Visiglass and and some other things that kind of make his stuff stand apart and I just I

[18:18] You know, I'm not making fun of people once again that buy thing by their machines or whatever but bang for the bucket

[18:23] You know if you're gonna buy a machine you might as well go backwards

[18:28] Okay, because you're gonna get more and you're gonna get less unless stern turns a dime

[18:33] Outside of their cookie cutter formulas in the reuse of mechanisms and toys and and stuff like that because like I just said

[18:40] The mini playfield and erosmith to me looks like the simsons pinball party couch, right?

[18:45] It just it does it's not the same. I'm but it's very similar

[18:48] Yeah, I mean, it's it's funny because when um when someone from

[18:52] Stern came over my apartment

[18:55] Well Jared came over and people knew he came over and he looked at my tails of the Arabian Knights

[18:59] And it's everything's brass plated everything on there is just mirror blades and

[19:04] You know CPR gold playfield

[19:07] um, he's just like oh my god like it's and and I paid I think

[19:13] 7800

[19:15] For it and I put another maybe thousand into it with upgrades

[19:20] Still still so much cheaper than a super early, but much much much more going on much more quality in there

[19:27] Yeah, and it's just you know, I do I've I've turned into someone who I someone is selling on

[19:34] Pinside right now 14,000 dollar. Yeah, look like good games. They look like good games

[19:39] But I mean I we can get into that hole you say have worth it and the answer of courses

[19:43] Well, it is if it's the you know your your dream title

[19:47] Dream title. I mean I wouldn't have out every single game I own or I'm doesn't seem to make a lot of sense

[19:51] But that that's up to the individual

[19:53] But don't expect it go and flip it on a market and say well clearly it's worth

[19:58] All this extra money that I put into it because most of the time you're not gonna get it back

[20:02] No, and I think you're not just can't and I think hepp owners always try to get back what they put into it

[20:08] They try. I mean that doesn't I mean just because something listed that's the you know the famous

[20:13] You know miss no more just because it listed at a certain price doesn't mean it was sold at that price

[20:18] So Chris, let's go back to pricing like what did you think when you saw where everyone was netting out at expo with

[20:23] With pricing across the board. Oh, I mean we my my personal prediction of that you know the other companies had to raise the bar in terms of pricing to offset for stern was completely true

[20:34] especially with jersey jack

[20:36] Um in terms of their 15,000 game we all I mean from a standpoint that we briefly talked about this in less than we interviewed

[20:44] But the $15,000 price tag is absurd for what you're getting. I mean it's I mean it's art if there's to me

[20:51] I'm gonna say so now that that that will make sense to most viewers

[20:55] artificial

[20:57] scarcity is okay if

[21:01] The value of what you're receiving is is equitable right that's the challenge because you when you have like a classic car company

[21:10] And they and they make a limited edition model

[21:12] I mean that thing is like seriously hawk, you know high-end

[21:16] You get your money's worth. I mean they're not gonna cheap on the leather

[21:20] In the in the car seats be I mean they just won't I mean because they know that the buyer will screw

[21:26] Denize it and go I will not accept that and unfortunately do the the the young nature of the industry in terms of new buyers

[21:35] They're willing to accept that

[21:38] But you know

[21:41] They got yeah, and they got 400 people who were banging on their door. That's a lot of people. I was really surprised and I didn't think they're

[21:48] Not many but I mean hey, you know

[21:51] I mean why do you why do you think that is? I mean is it just the neo-fight

[21:55] Collector is sort of just driven by I want the game that other people don't have and finally there's one that's very limited

[22:03] Well, we had that phenomenon back in their late 90s and 2000s because I I tell people like the pinball market is a circle

[22:11] Just like history if you know that past history you can you can

[22:16] You know see what's going on in the present and predict the future and what happened like in the 2000s and 90s

[22:21] You had that that famous cookie cutter collection thing and I talked about and in this case

[22:26] It's it's new collectors predominantly

[22:29] That do want to stand out from their you know fell collectors and friends and so on and and and that's fine

[22:36] I mean, I hope they got their money sort of but I don't think they did but I mean you know

[22:41] I remember my perspective is different because I'm looking at it for that bang for the buck

[22:45] And you know, I really hammer down because after you

[22:48] Owned so many pinball machines and I've owned like 620 if it bull machines and close to 30 years

[22:54] You know you you really start to go design features

[22:58] Gameplay. I mean you're it's not purely about art, but don't get me wrong. I love art too

[23:04] So I think that a lot of it is purely based on the

[23:09] lack of knowledge of what a pinball machine can provide in terms of entertainment

[23:16] Or just the lack of understanding and what the market is in the world that that's truly being

[23:22] Tested in the used market

[23:24] Where buyers just certainly just don't know that a game isn't worth $8,500 and maybe worth $5,000 or $6,000

[23:32] But they're gonna pay it because that's what the dealer says it was worth

[23:36] And they don't know well, there's so much going on to that

[23:40] I mean it's to me it just feels purely

[23:43] A hype driven race well to get something will Stern's model right now of

[23:50] You know Ellie's like they did it with ghost busters, you know

[23:54] They they plant these rumors like 250 are going overseas only 250 will be in America

[23:59] And there's just this race to get it

[24:02] Right i got good luck with that because i'll tell you what right now the market when it comes to overseas

[24:07] Socks because it's dropping like a fly well, I don't think they're going toward the machines right no

[24:13] They can't and Canada can't afford them and I don't I think look I think stern is

[24:17] That rumor is placed out right stern

[24:20] They may be selling them to the home market, but i'm telling you they're not shipping 50% of their games to Europe anymore

[24:26] They can't they can't do it

[24:28] They're just not enough buyers New Zealand Australia, you know they they just people in that people over there like will screw this

[24:35] I mean, I'm not going to spend 16 or 18 thousand dollars for a brand new game

[24:41] I mean they that's just I mean there's but most of these guys have been collecting for a while too a lot of them more new

[24:46] Right they're just not in bed away remember pinball in Europe even today

[24:52] Is not anywhere near as popular as it is in the United States

[24:56] I mean i remember i lived in central and south america and that was a mecca of pinball in the 80s

[25:03] You know you had taedo you had LTD you had all these you know copycatted cloned

[25:09] Valley game manufacturers and they made tons of games and they were they're still floating all around

[25:14] But if you go down to that part of the world now, I mean what's pinball

[25:19] Yeah

[25:20] So it it it it's just it's a very

[25:24] It's an interesting market test by stern, but it's dangerous because once they pushed that envelope too far

[25:31] As they have done with many senior collectors who are basically thumbing their noses and looking like okay you serious

[25:38] We bought your games in early 2000s and they were turds and we are supported pinball and we kept it alive when you were struggling to sell games

[25:46] And then and then now in

[25:49] 2016 when you're riding the wave

[25:51] You decide to say that games are now worth you know whatever you want to charge i mean 10,000 12,000 15,000 dollars

[26:00] I mean that's

[26:02] It's it's it's it's it is it's you know it's the cash cow and i don't want i don't i don't want to beat on stern

[26:07] I mean

[26:08] Well, we have to get i have to make money when the market is here because when it isn't here they're gonna be suffering right

[26:14] It does pull it's it's it's interesting when you see people respond and i know there's been threads like

[26:20] We need to tell stern stop right and we're gonna we're gonna tell them with our wallets and we're not gonna go in and buy

[26:27] Yeah, well you hear it every time and then star wars le announced if it was announced tomorrow

[26:31] It would it's it's already sold out. I know for a fact sure

[26:34] We'll every distributor i've talked to has a list for star wars le's that are approaching a hundred people per distributor

[26:44] And each distributor might get 10 or 15

[26:47] games um

[26:49] So i repeat yeah, i'm gonna repeat myself though the danger with this is you can look at it from the standpoint of reducing your number

[26:58] If from the standpoint of being a boutique manufacturer

[27:01] But if you do that you cannot have industry growth

[27:04] It doesn't work you shrink the number of manufacturers dry up you usually end up left of a one or two

[27:11] Because you can't hold because if you have too much machine choice in a boutique world

[27:16] People

[27:18] Yeah, i got to choose their games and then like i agree and i also think that the prices are too high

[27:24] That's the key with it. I mean, yeah, I mean it's it's almost like ludicrous to think that in a niche market like pinball

[27:30] You want it broke volume volume sales is the right

[27:35] Well, it's it's ludicrous to think that we even need though like six or eight

[27:40] Titles to come out in a year. That's a lot. Yeah, it is there for one year

[27:44] That's a lot because that's part of the reason why in the in the 94 95

[27:50] I mean there was a lot of choice

[27:53] But they were in pinball was already starting to suffer

[27:57] And because of its decline in interest and then you have six or eight titles and then guess what?

[28:03] Bye, right the manufacturer close up because they and they are kids and was still alive. Yeah, I mean you what?

[28:10] Operators would shuffle machines it out. That's not the case absolutely

[28:14] I mean they were thriving but once again they're competing against their own games

[28:18] That was the other problem the operator would say why do I need to buy a new game for an x number of dollars because now you've raised the prices by another two or three hundred dollars sound familiar

[28:28] Um this year from last year when my games are now only year old and i'm still trying to pay them off

[28:34] See the biggest problem with like the situation with Jersey jack even because he's catering to higher market

[28:40] He is basically completely eliminating operators

[28:44] Operators can't afford to buy the games

[28:47] No one can

[28:48] Put I shouldn't say no one but a large percentage of operators that are left cannot put a nine or ten thousand dollar game on a more on a route and make money

[28:59] They just can't they they have to they have to be in a high traffic region and there's just not that many there

[29:05] Yes, they're there's Chicago. There's New York. There's Portland. There's Seattle and there's a few more areas

[29:10] In the country, but for the most part it's just not big enough and that's a problem

[29:16] And as a result if you don't get enough sales

[29:20] What happens to the manufacturer? We already know well if you yeah, I mean if you look at

[29:25] And i'm just gonna do some crude math but nine thousand dollars and

[29:29] Let's say

[29:31] I you know the cost to an operator does the operator get a better price than yes

[29:37] At consumer bias and volume. I mean remember if the old operators what they would do is they would buy in volume

[29:43] Hey, there's a keyword again volume. Okay, they would buy multiple titles or mightable multiple copies of the same title

[29:49] And then as a result that they were get a reduction from the distributor of choice that usually you know

[29:54] And then of course that distributor would get better offers and considerations from the manufacturer

[29:59] So it all goes uphill. I mean everybody kind of wins and and as you know

[30:05] The market for pinball dried up because you know operators were buying it because of the amount of technical

[30:12] Work that's required to keep them running and the profit margin they've been back because you you talked about

[30:17] This recently with the other operator of whomever and you like you can't do a 50 50 split anymore

[30:23] Particularly for a brand new machine because that's insane. I mean

[30:28] If it's split on a batman le you know, I mean you did take like 10 years to pay off your your dad

[30:34] So yeah, they do get better deals

[30:36] But the problem is is that operators cannot afford that and and even at a reduced price the question

[30:42] It should be asked right now in 2017 to a manufacturer. They're going to come back and say why

[30:48] Why should I give you a discount when I only sell a thousand machines anyway

[30:54] They're not going to do it because they they can't make any money either that that's what I'm saying if you keep

[31:00] Games reasonably priced in line with the economy and

[31:06] You continue to grow your outreach to new collectors and maintain a sense of viability for operators

[31:13] Then the industry continues to thrive otherwise it shrinks

[31:18] And that's what's going on right now, right? The the the industry is going to shrink

[31:24] It has to because you I mean, I know everybody wants like well you're full crap

[31:28] Well, you know what most of my prediction is in the last 30 years of you should have been right

[31:32] That might be pompous

[31:33] But I'm sorry that's the reason why I don't lose money in this hobby because I just don't do some of these things

[31:41] But it's it's gonna shrink. I mean there's no way

[31:45] It is gonna become more of a collector's market. Yeah, well, yes. We're already in it right in it

[31:51] It's already in it 70 80% of all of my sales are private sales so these new companies popping up

[31:57] Are well they're trying to cash in and but they can't even compete with me on a manufacturing level

[32:04] Don't get their game out

[32:07] Well, that's why you talked about home pins. I mean, that's interesting. I mean they you know Mike is

[32:14] Really I do think it's the most ambitious effort being lawns. Please do it. He's doing it right

[32:20] I mean he's going to a foreign country where the the cost of labor is lower the production lower or the cost are lower

[32:25] It makes total sense it does because he can make a better price competitive product

[32:30] That's the reason why personally I'm cheering American pinball on because they know

[32:35] That if they can break into the market and their first pin is a success

[32:39] And they were able to do it at a lower price and people will gravitate of course to their machines

[32:43] I mean and and and guess what stern has to counter and go oh shit now we got a lower the prices

[32:49] And it works competition as we know is a good thing in any industry

[32:55] So what's interesting is you know some of the other companies and where their prices are falling

[33:00] Because when you look at even alien pinball with the le and and the screen

[33:05] What you got everything on it? It's close to $9,000. Yeah, well, it's you just don't see it because you look at the base model

[33:11] And it's like buying a car. It's like oh and if you add this in people won't think about it

[33:16] It's like buying something for you know

[33:19] $9.99 it's really $10 but they try to make it you know sound or marketing it's $9 but it's not

[33:27] Well, it's so it's it's gonna be interesting because no one has really figured out how to make a

[33:32] A machine that's as good as a stern

[33:36] For around five six thousand dollars. Yeah, it's tough when you're starting because you just don't have access

[33:41] I mean you mentioned it and it's totally true stern's got parts manufacturers locked up under their thumb

[33:47] And I would too if I was stern because you're basically saying no no no competition

[33:52] You're gonna have to go find another source

[33:54] Right and and and you know what they I mean they've been doing that for years

[33:58] But if you want to turn the table and just a little bit and kind of diverge from that

[34:03] This year this is kind of like a happy news because I don't believe in being negative. I believe in being realistic

[34:09] Okay, dealers had a wonderful year this year

[34:13] Holy crap use pinball machines were the highest they have been since in their early two thousand's

[34:20] Like 2001 and 2002. I am talking everything from wood rails to modern machines

[34:28] They have I mean they couldn't keep up with the does with the need

[34:31] Christmas was incredible

[34:33] I talked to ten different dealers they they were selling e-m's they were selling solid state they were selling everything

[34:40] They couldn't get enough games out the door

[34:43] And have already and and that's incredible unfortunately of course the byproduct is the prices

[34:49] We're high up right and but that's okay because there's actually some added benefits this and I want I wanted to share this

[34:57] Some little notes that I wrote down that I think that the viewers would enjoy okay

[35:01] I call it the current future of pinball in two thousand something this is completely unrelated to new manufacturers

[35:08] Hit me okay, so I have the term

[35:12] Pinflation

[35:13] Okay, that's that's artificial inflation of pinball machines due to market. That's called inflation

[35:18] I call it so continued inflation in quotes will drive new owners with limited funding options

[35:25] To learn to repair use machines and potentially increase the need for reproduction parts and the desire to find old or titles

[35:34] New inbox games will continue to move further and further away from the reach of the average consumer

[35:40] Okay, this is an historical repeated cycle

[35:43] But never a bad thing for the hobby the same owners compete against dealers and brokers and you can see that in the private market from

[35:53] Private sales that aren't from collector to collector

[35:55] There was a mystic here that came up on Craigslist that had been in storage for 20 years

[36:01] And the guy was selling it for $775 and

[36:07] It didn't completely work. It was sold in two hours. All right

[36:11] Wow, they're they're private people are competing against dealers and brokers

[36:16] What that means is too is that because of the interest in use games all these dealers that have these

[36:23] Games that have been sitting in warehouses. They're starting to move again

[36:27] Instead of collecting dust now you have access to more titles and more games that otherwise would be sitting in storage in a warehouse

[36:37] Because nobody wanted them because the the dealers can't make any profit

[36:42] There's nobody because they can't sell the game they people say why don't you want new games now people are saying oh wait a minute

[36:48] Where are all these other games? So you got people exploring the world of pinball and discovering the older titles

[36:55] So the caveat that continues beyond it more good news the more that people restore

[37:01] The more games are saved rather than being parted out or destroyed

[37:06] As they are recognized to have some value

[37:09] However, they are not necessarily classified as gold

[37:13] When they can't fix what they have

[37:16] See now the the biggest problem with that is on the short term while you have a short fall of parts

[37:22] You have games that are cannibalized for the same reasons that should make sense and that happened in the

[37:28] 2000s during the re-import era because there wasn't any

[37:33] WPC and system 11

[37:35] Board sets to replace the games that didn't work so other boards got games got parted out

[37:41] Okay, so how does this affect in the long term?

[37:45] In the long term pinball game manufacturers will continue to push

[37:49] Potential owners further away from buying new machines until industry stagnation

[37:55] This is not a new revelation at this point

[37:59] This really needs to happen to get people to recognize realities and manufacturers to stop you know step on

[38:05] Themselves and put a halt to it

[38:07] This remains what what some people in the market call a bubble which is not that's the stall now

[38:14] If you look a little further back if if this is interesting is game manufacturers did not survive

[38:20] Is that we're talking about the past unless they diversified both in coin-operated devices beyond pinball and include used games

[38:29] That's what's important otherwise these mom and pop places

[38:34] That are thriving right now as like a hobby side or a side business right they shut her to their doors

[38:39] Because they don't have any stock they have to have inventory in order to do that

[38:44] And that's exactly the reason why right now we only have in terms of the the big guys

[38:51] The the heavy hitters

[38:53] You know game room guys you know people like the old bettsin

[38:58] Why you only have a small number of dealers that have you know

[39:03] Been selling games since the 1980s like TNT amusements for example taught talking

[39:08] Okay, some of these I mean there's not that many out there that have been operating for more than 30 years

[39:14] And there's a reason for it because they know that when times are good you got to sell sell sell

[39:21] But they're also hoarding games at the same time

[39:25] They're stalking their inventory for the bad times

[39:29] So they can in business right so the the long term and the what I call the summary on it is is if you learn from

[39:37] Collectors that are willing to teach

[39:39] Which they're not going to be around forever

[39:42] Okay, you're there's more games that are going to be saved and the market of pinball and the collectors

[39:49] Will thrive because here's the problem dealers as we mentioned earlier

[39:54] They don't consider older games useful for profit unless it's a good time in the market

[40:01] Or they don't have any more stock

[40:03] Because they'll say that they can't fix them or they can't find parts

[40:08] And every single one of these comments that I just said

[40:12] Has happened before

[40:14] So when you look at this cycle you know, we're getting ready to move into this cycle that I just explained again

[40:23] Right and then and then it would repeat itself now. I hope that manufacturers the new manufacturers

[40:31] Aren't purely looking at things as let's ride this wave as quickly as as much as we can

[40:36] Because in the long run it makes everybody suffer including themselves

[40:40] But I can't guarantee you that when they develop a new pinball machine if the cost of parts and construction or coding and programming and everything continues to rise

[40:51] Which I'm not directly tracking at this moment

[40:54] I don't know what their current profit margin is for these smaller companies

[40:59] I can get a gauge from Stern, but I can't do it for these other smaller ones that only produce a game every two years

[41:07] Yeah, I mean I I always I mean I make the I'm much more profit are you gonna make I mean I make the guess too and the assumption and I think I'm probably right is

[41:15] Every day you're not shipping your losing money every day right and paint for that heat in that warehouse

[41:21] And that's the thing that

[41:23] And I think we both agree is we're gonna see

[41:28] Companies failing there you can't go on ill I don't know how to feel but if you go two years if you go two years right and you don't have

[41:37] A high volume title and then your two years delayed on the next title

[41:43] Every day every day you're burning money so by the time that second title that's supposed to get you out of the hole actually ships

[41:51] It can't save you you've lost too much blood

[41:54] Now you asked a question about why does Stern

[41:57] What you know they they don't let the hype you know like they're they just introduce Batman

[42:02] But they just you know all they are suddenly they reveal they're on today's next yeah

[42:05] They have to because they rely pinball as a niche industry relies on hype

[42:12] The only way you can sell enough games is hype because as soon as the game gets six months old

[42:20] Unless it's incredibly popular and successful such as Ghostbusters has become and Matt already is and

[42:27] It fades right and people want something new and it's just the market is too small

[42:33] So they rely on that hype that's why you're seeing them turn a dime on titles so quickly

[42:39] Right and they don't they don't even see like a game

[42:44] In its by its own theme they just see if if something's on the line we're making money

[42:50] So it doesn't matter if it's WWE or

[42:53] Keep it smooth or Ghostbusters or Batman like keep keep it moving and look when you go to Stern.com

[42:59] It is impressive when you look at the games we have available for you to buy today and there's like

[43:04] There's like they still keep producing it certain games and that's and that's the awesome part where they are

[43:11] Been successful and learn the lessons that Ballion Williams and well even Stern did by Dade East and so on

[43:18] That they they stopped doing the one run and done

[43:22] Okay, that that was a terrible thing

[43:24] But it that you know the industry was not set up for it that was not the mindset of management

[43:30] I mean that's not how they did business

[43:32] So in Stern had to do that when they changed their they you know they changed their ways

[43:37] But they didn't change their ways immediately. I mean this didn't happen in like

[43:42] 2001 it didn't even happen in 2007

[43:46] This is only a something they kind of redesigned on their assembly line in the last six years

[43:51] Because I mean they still thought they could survive by doing the ones he twosy titles a year

[43:57] But it didn't work so they had to do something particularly because that's when they also changed their mindset to say hey

[44:04] We need to kind of like market to the home

[44:07] Versus operator, I mean that's the other thing it's scary for 2017 because honestly

[44:14] I don't see a lot of titles being targeted

[44:18] Exclusively for operators other than Stern's you know potential aero smith or whatever they're still gonna produce this year

[44:25] Which we all will hope is jaws

[44:28] I

[44:31] I've always like I'm almost be I'm almost feel like jaws already came out. I hear that title so much

[44:37] Shit, I liked it so much. I made my own flyer and in using the original

[44:42] digital version that someone created using

[44:45] Visual pinball and or future pinball which was incredible, but that's a different story for it. So anyway

[44:52] Well, it's it's gonna be interesting so

[44:56] So you're saying Stern is really the only one who does have a machine that caters to operators

[45:01] Yeah, right now. I mean you Jersey jacket. It just does it. They're they're pricing model doesn't work with the average operator

[45:07] No, and it just doesn't work and then I mean you do have exceptions, but I'm sorry if they sell

[45:13] I'll be I'll be in shock if Jersey Jack sells more than 3500 machines total of all types

[45:20] I'll be in shock. I don't think you'll sell that. I think it'll sell 2500

[45:25] I think you will because I think his prices are too high one dialed in is gonna be the real test too because

[45:30] It's like the theme itself is not knocking people socks off and yeah, I mean a collector price point

[45:39] But it doesn't have any that ain't I mean it's it's not something I mean I'm not hey

[45:43] I don't I like the game. I thought it was cool

[45:46] But you know, I look at and go is it really worth that much money? Nope

[45:49] But the other thing is like you'll remember people were remember 2016, you know we recapped it

[45:55] You know, they'll remember

[45:58] 2016 is a turning point in the market where basically it's hey

[46:04] The standpoint of the home market is the way ahead

[46:08] the pricing model

[46:10] It completely blew everything out of the water and we're never really gonna go back

[46:15] We're always now gonna be looking at these things in a different light

[46:19] Because of the price model that was offered by this Batman Super Ellie

[46:23] And they're gonna gauge against it in the future

[46:25] And they're gonna continue to cater against the home market and operators will continue to say well screw this

[46:31] And they're gonna get out and it's gonna accelerate problems

[46:35] Because kids what happens when when the market stalls and

[46:41] And there's no operators to buy games what happens to manufacturers?

[46:45] All right, we're gonna end

[46:47] Interview part one right there on that cliffhanger what happens to manufacturers

[46:53] tune in

[46:55] To episode 77 to hear the conclusion of the greatest interview ever between canada and the black knight
