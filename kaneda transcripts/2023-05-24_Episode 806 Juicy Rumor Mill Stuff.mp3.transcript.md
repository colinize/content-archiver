[00:00] Up in the whole light, yes, it's just good.

[00:04] Get em' miss, get em' miss, get em' miss, can't be dropped.

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:11] Wait, back-to-back Canada shows?

[00:15] I'm not even charging $10.

[00:17] You guys are paying most of you $5 a month for Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:21] Here's what we're gonna do on this little short version of Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:25] I wanna do a little bit of a follow-up on Canada's collector's corner.

[00:29] I got some interesting information I wanna pass on to each and every one of you

[00:34] about a really shady practice I'm hearing happens in some of these high-end collectible games for sale.

[00:40] I wasn't even aware that this is something people do.

[00:43] It's kinda like rolling back the clock on the odometer Ferris Bueller style.

[00:48] We're gonna talk about that.

[00:49] Gonna talk a little bit about American Pinball and Galactic Tank Force.

[00:54] I heard a little bit of a rumor why these games are taking such a long time to get out to people.

[01:00] And I'm also gonna talk about the latest video they just put up like a few minutes ago.

[01:05] It's a seven-minute video that they probably should have put out at the very beginning of this game,

[01:10] but we're gonna talk about that.

[01:12] And then I'm gonna make a quick guess on what I think might be the game coming out from Fast Pinball.

[01:19] So a couple people hit me up and let me know something they saw.

[01:23] And we're gonna pass that information on to you and maybe this is one of the mystery games coming out into the pinball space.

[01:31] Alright, so let's start this episode with a shady practice that is happening in the high-end collectible space.

[01:37] So you know how you see these like high-end games and it's like 87 plays and less than 200 plays?

[01:45] I heard a practice that people do that is really shady.

[01:48] People will take high-played LE games.

[01:52] So maybe some LE games that were on location or LE games that were in a home of someone who put a few thousand plays on them.

[02:00] They will acquire these LEs for less money because they've been beat on.

[02:06] And then they will switch the main board on the LE machine with a board from a premium machine that hardly has any plays on it.

[02:16] So if you do that and you cycle through the game, it will tell you the total number of plays on the machine,

[02:24] but it's really reading the premium board, not the limited edition game.

[02:29] I don't even know how you get around this because Stern, Pinball, and Jersey Jack, they both use the same exact driver boards for both like the LE and the CE or the LE and the premium.

[02:41] So what do you think of that?

[02:43] So that's really shady.

[02:45] Now, if you're someone who does this, I don't understand the world of a scammer like someone who's willingly doing something that is basically lying to the new customer so they can make more money.

[02:57] Like how do you wake up and live with yourself on a daily basis if you're someone who's doing this just to make a couple more thousand dollars because you want to sell the game as a low-play limited edition game?

[03:12] And there's a lot of effort that you have to do to do this.

[03:15] Like you have to buy a new premium.

[03:17] You have to find an LE with a lot of plays for a good deal, make the swap happen, and then list the game and ship the game and then live with yourself knowing that you lied to that buyer.

[03:30] Wow.

[03:31] Now look, the manufacturers could help out with this if they simply marked the boards as specific boards for LE machines.

[03:39] And maybe serial numbered the boards with the game itself.

[03:43] But that's a lot of work and they also don't care.

[03:45] Like why would Stern Pimbal or Jersey Jack Pimbal care about any of this?

[03:49] I don't think this happens very often.

[03:52] I think the easiest way to see if this is going on with your LE game, this is why you kind of have to stand over a machine and not just buy off of internet photos.

[04:03] If you stand over a machine and it's been played a few thousand times and the person's listing it as a low-play LE with like 87 plays, you'll be able to tell by the wear and tear on the play field if that game is really a low-play game or if it's a high-play game.

[04:21] And look, raise of hands, how many of us have bought a Pimbal machine sight unseen, which means we never stood over it?

[04:28] And it's really a gamble.

[04:30] I just bought a $25,000 Batman SLE and I never walked around the machine.

[04:35] I never looked at the machine.

[04:37] I'm just going off of the photos.

[04:39] I'm taking their word for it that the game is perfect.

[04:42] But I don't know, there could be a nick on the cabinet that would reduce the price.

[04:45] There could be something broken on the top.

[04:47] I mean, when you really think about all of the different things that are part of a Pimbal machine, there is a lot that can go wrong if you don't walk around the machine.

[04:57] When I was at Texas Pimbal Festival, they had a Batman SLE there and it was beat to crap.

[05:03] I mean, totally beat the crap all over the machine and you could easily take photos that hide the damage on the machine.

[05:11] So look, just be careful when you buy these super expensive machines.

[05:15] I think for anyone out there buying a machine that's over $10,000, I would try to find someone local to the seller.

[05:23] And I think you can find people local to the seller that would happily go over there and inspect the machine for you.

[05:30] And we know a lot of us are bank wiring money for these games and you're never going to be able to get a refund if the product arrives and you're not happy.

[05:39] So just be careful.

[05:41] There are scammers everywhere in Pimbal.

[05:43] Disgusting behavior.

[05:45] And I think anyone who scams anybody in this hobby should be ashamed of themselves because I do believe in karma people.

[05:52] All right, so let's talk about Galactic Tank Force.

[05:55] I just saw this eight minute video.

[05:57] I saw Christopher Franci was posting about this yesterday and this video is much better than the initial launch video of this game.

[06:06] I mean, they should have this video ready to go in March.

[06:09] It explains the storyline.

[06:11] It explains the gameplay better.

[06:13] It explains what you have to do in this game.

[06:17] And we see the employees over at American Pimbal dressed up in character.

[06:21] And it's a much better video than what they launched the game with.

[06:25] Now that being said, after watching eight minutes of this game and them explaining what's happening in this game, I'm going to be completely candid.

[06:36] It's still such a weird storyline.

[06:39] It's still all over the place about ice cream and milk and tanks and UFOs and cows.

[06:47] It is so damn weird.

[06:50] And also, when you stand over this game, a lot of the different targets and elements happening on the play field, a lot of those things are kind of hidden when you're actually standing over the game in a player's position.

[07:04] You know, that's the thing about Pimbal is that you could easily have ideas, but if the player can't really see or read where things are happening on the play field, it does get a little bit confusing if things are kind of hidden shots.

[07:18] Because hidden shots and targets that aren't really rewarding to shoot, it doesn't really make the game a lot of fun.

[07:25] And so look, this is the best marketing material they've put out to date.

[07:30] The marketing on this game has been terrible.

[07:33] They worked on this game for three years.

[07:35] And I'm still wondering where the heck is Dennis Nordman?

[07:39] Like, why isn't he even talking about his own creation?

[07:43] It's just weird to me.

[07:45] It's like you have Ryan McQuade, who's not even the designer of this game, working harder to sell a game that was made by a guy that's an iconic designer in the Pimbal community.

[07:57] I don't get it.

[07:58] And it just feels like something weird is happening behind the scenes on this game.

[08:02] And it does feel a little bit like a day late and a dollar short.

[08:06] Like they're trying hard to get new interest in this game.

[08:10] And look, I've been speaking to people at Pimbal shows.

[08:13] It's not that people don't walk up to this game and don't want it, but I'm still hearing from a lot of distributors that these games are barely being made.

[08:22] Like there's not a lot going out.

[08:23] I don't think any L.E.s are really going out to customers right now.

[08:27] Now, I did a little digging and I was asking around, why is this?

[08:31] Like, why is American Pimbal a company that has made games before?

[08:35] Why is this launch so shaky?

[08:38] Like, why is this launch all over the place?

[08:41] Like, why aren't games on the line?

[08:43] Like, what is happening over at AP?

[08:45] Now, look, I heard a story from someone who works in the industry about why the delay is happening over at AP.

[08:52] And I'm going to deliver this to you with a caveat that obviously they're not going to

[08:57] confirm this is going on, that obviously I can't overly investigate this because no one's going to tell me if this is true or not.

[09:05] But here's what I heard from a little birdie.

[09:08] I heard that American Pimbal, when they were making this game or developing this game,

[09:13] American Pimbal buys a lot of its parts from Terry at Pimbal Life.

[09:18] And what I heard happened was this.

[09:20] In an effort to save money and increase their profit margins on this game,

[09:26] I heard the team over at American Pimbal tried to go around Pimbal Life and go directly to the vendors who make the parts

[09:36] that Pimbal Life supplies American Pimbal.

[09:39] And I heard that Terry caught wind of that and that created a huge issue with

[09:45] American Pimbal getting all of the parts it needed to make these games.

[09:50] And once Pimbal Life caught wind of it, they put a stop to it.

[09:54] And then also I heard they were charging more money for American Pimbal to get the same exact parts because that is not a good business

[10:02] practice to go around your supplier and go directly to the vendor.

[10:08] So whether or not this story is true or not, I don't know.

[10:12] So remember that I'm delivering this with a caveat.

[10:16] It doesn't matter.

[10:17] All that matters now is that they get these games made and they satiate the orders for these games as soon as possible.

[10:26] I have friends who are in on a tank version of this game and they have no idea

[10:31] when they're getting their game.

[10:33] That's not a good business practice.

[10:35] You don't want to take orders from people and then leave them in the dark.

[10:40] And I think almost everybody who bought a Galactic Tank Force LE or a signature edition game,

[10:47] they have absolutely no clue when they're getting their game.

[10:51] And it's only a matter of time before people get a little bit fed up with the weight.

[10:56] And I'm just saying, look, American Pimbal, you have been in the game long enough.

[11:00] You know how this hobby works.

[11:02] You know how marketing works.

[11:04] You know how generating excitement for a product works.

[11:07] And you've done everything backwards.

[11:10] And I don't care if Franchi wants to say, oh, this is a podcaster being negative.

[11:14] We're not going to champion and cheer lead efforts if they're done poorly.

[11:19] It's time to wake up.

[11:21] It's time to act more professionally.

[11:23] And it's time to have more respect for your own product and your own marketing.

[11:28] This is your company and you had every chance to do it right.

[11:32] And I know that you put up a YouTube video trying to get people excited about the game.

[11:36] But here's the other thing they're doing wrong.

[11:38] They turn the comments off on their YouTube video.

[11:42] In my industry, the moment you turn comments off on your YouTube video,

[11:48] that signals to everybody you're not confident in what you just uploaded.

[11:53] And you're afraid of what people are going to say about your own product.

[11:58] It's 2023, American Pinball.

[12:01] Wake up, grow up.

[12:03] You have a captive audience that wants to engage with your brand.

[12:07] It's time to start acting like marketing professionals and its amateur hour.

[12:12] And of course, I'm going to call you out on this because this is what I do for a living.

[12:16] I could have marketed this game 10 times better.

[12:19] But look, if I was working over at American Pinball as a marketer,

[12:22] I never would have green lit this game.

[12:25] There's a reason why this game was sitting in Dennis Norman's garage for 10 years

[12:29] and nobody else would make it.

[12:31] Can you tell why?

[12:32] Because if you make a good theme pinball machine,

[12:35] you don't even have to make eight minute videos explaining to people what UFOs are

[12:39] doing here and cows are doing here.

[12:41] You don't even have to do an eight minute video trying to explain to people what

[12:44] the damn storyline is.

[12:46] They already know what the storyline is when it's the godfather, when it's Godzilla,

[12:50] when it's Ghostbusters, when it's Batman, when it's Venom.

[12:54] They know what the storyline is.

[12:55] All right, so we'll see what happens.

[12:57] I can't wait to see someone unbox a 17,500 dollar signature edition of Galactic

[13:05] Tank Force. Now, speaking of unboxings or showing us something,

[13:09] I offer $250 to a charity of Damien's Choice over at Haggis Pinball.

[13:16] If he would open up his door and show us live what production looks like over at

[13:23] Haggis Pinball, no word from him yet.

[13:26] I don't think he's going to take me up on the offer.

[13:28] I'm going to keep increasing the amount of money.

[13:30] This is funny now.

[13:31] Like if you're a pinball manufacturer and you're afraid to open up your door

[13:36] and show us randomly on a random day of the week, what's going on each day,

[13:40] you owe people that.

[13:42] I'm sorry, you do owe people that.

[13:44] And I heard from John over at Jack Bar.

[13:46] John, I'm going to call you out right now.

[13:47] He wrote on Facebook, he goes, when a guy is successfully cooking,

[13:52] why does he have to show you what's going on in the kitchen?

[13:55] And I responded to John and I said, successfully cooking.

[13:59] Imagine if you're at a restaurant and the chef tells you your meal is going to

[14:04] be out in eight minutes and your meal doesn't come out for eight hours.

[14:09] OK, that's what's happening over at Haggis.

[14:12] Am I being a jerk? Am I being unkind?

[14:14] And am I being a bully?

[14:15] No, because what's about to happen next is this.

[14:18] Haggis Pinball is going to announce another title.

[14:21] And I don't think we should be giving deposits until they do a walkthrough

[14:25] of how many people work there.

[14:27] How many games a week are you making before you ask people to give money on

[14:32] Centaur because you've taken so much money on Fathom and you told people you were

[14:36] going to have your game in eight weeks and it's been more like eight months.

[14:40] And it's been complete radio silence.

[14:42] So yeah, I'm challenging Damien and Marty to live up to your word.

[14:46] And just because you're trickling a few games out every week,

[14:50] that is not a good sign that people should throw more non-refundable deposits

[14:54] at your business. Come at me.

[14:56] I got lawyers lined up and believe me, I've captured all of Haggis Pinball's

[15:01] promises throughout the years.

[15:03] So if they ever want to say I'm saying something I'm not allowed to,

[15:06] I'll simply let them hang themselves by their own words.

[15:09] Canada, you can't do this.

[15:11] Canada, you're never going to be able to charge $10 a month if you go after

[15:16] a pinball company and challenge them to show us how they're even making their own

[15:20] games. What are you doing, Canada?

[15:22] You got to cheerlead every single pinball company.

[15:25] You're never going to get mentioned on Naps Arcade now.

[15:29] So speaking of pinball companies, people,

[15:31] so here's the other rumor I heard.

[15:33] So we all know that Fath's Pinball is providing boards to build some new game,

[15:38] some mystery game coming out in pinball.

[15:41] I've also heard that it's a licensed game.

[15:44] Now, does that mean it's a new licensed game?

[15:48] Does that mean it's an old game that's a license?

[15:51] We don't know, but I'm about to make a guess.

[15:54] So if you go on Fath's Pinball's website, you see the boards they make,

[15:58] and they're making boards that drive classic pinball machines.

[16:02] So older Valley Williams stuff,

[16:04] you can put the fast board into the older games and it can now both drive the

[16:10] original code of the game and these 2.0 kits.

[16:15] Now, I've been hearing from a few of you, you sent me emails.

[16:18] Nobody is loving these 2.0 kits.

[16:20] The Toten one is terrible.

[16:22] The Funhouse one is like, eh, and the World Win one is just atrocious.

[16:27] So these 2.0 kits are not working out.

[16:30] All right, but you don't care about that.

[16:31] Nobody cares about the 2.0 kits.

[16:33] So here's my guess on what the fast pinball machine might be.

[16:37] And here's how I came to this guess.

[16:39] There was someone who attended the pinball show in California and they saw an

[16:44] older game that was built from the ground up and it was running off of the fast boards.

[16:50] And this is an interesting game to consider as a remake because it is a licensed theme.

[16:56] It's also a game that is super expensive.

[16:59] It's a game where there were not many made back in the day,

[17:03] but it's also a game that is unique.

[17:05] Right. When you think about like, what's the white space in people's

[17:09] game rooms, we haven't seen anyone remake this game ever before.

[17:14] And it's also a game that's a different way to play pinball.

[17:18] It is a player versus player game.

[17:21] So my fast guess on what fast pinballs remake machine might be is they are going

[17:28] to remake joust joust is a game where I think only like a hundred or so were made.

[17:33] It's player versus player.

[17:36] It's a super cool experience.

[17:38] A good conditioned joust game will cost you like 15 to 20 thousand dollars,

[17:44] depending on who's selling it.

[17:45] And so is that going to be the game?

[17:48] Is that the amazing game that's coming?

[17:50] And they've been saying stuff like their game has been out in the open.

[17:55] So maybe it is joust.

[17:57] I can hear Aaron right now texting me.

[17:59] You're wrong. You're wrong.

[18:00] Well, if I'm wrong, so be it.

[18:02] But that is my guess.

[18:04] There was a joust running off of the fast boards.

[18:08] And I haven't seen that before.

[18:10] Why would there be a joust using the fast boards unless they were testing a 2.0 kit for joust?

[18:18] So you heard it here first on Canadian pinball podcast.

[18:21] I know you love the news, rumors and speculations.

[18:24] I know that's why you're here.

[18:26] And don't worry, I'm not going to charge you more money.

[18:29] I'm not going to change the tiers of Canada's pinball podcast.

[18:32] Someone said to me, you should make Canada's collectors corner a separate tier for Patreon.

[18:38] I'm going to tell you right now, I will never slice up this show.

[18:42] You're not going to get more Canada if you spend 15 or 30 dollars.

[18:46] I don't care if I ever feel like this is not worth my time and I don't enjoy this.

[18:50] I'll stop doing it.

[18:51] And I'm super thankful for everyone who's a club member.

[18:54] I'm super thankful if you give more than five dollars, but I'm not going to slice and dice the content.

[19:00] If you give more than ten dollars and you want to have a private screen time chat with

[19:05] Canada once a month, let me tell you right now, I will privately chat with each and every one of you.

[19:11] Even if you just give five dollars, if you want to do a private chat with me or a phone call,

[19:16] I will happily do it.

[19:18] Just hit me up at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[19:21] I don't think Patreon tiers should be sliced up like that.

[19:25] I think it's extra work.

[19:26] I don't think it's worth it.

[19:27] You shouldn't have to pay 25 or 100 bucks a month just to have a personal phone call or video chat with Canada.

[19:34] Everybody, I love being the podcaster for the people.

[19:37] Nobody gives you news rumors or speculation like this.

[19:40] And now that we've called out American Pinball, you think we might be able to get

[19:44] Christopher Franchi to do a podcast?

[19:46] I mean, he really has no medium to respond now because he's never doing a podcast again.

[19:50] Trust me, he's going to do a podcast again because we're going to get him triggered later.
