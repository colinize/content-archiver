[00:00] Oh ho ho it's magic, you know, never believe it's not so much.

[00:20] I woke up this morning and found an email in my inbox that I never thought I'd see.

[00:26] It was an email that I had waited months to receive about five or six months and it's also

[00:33] an email that I know many of you out there have waited years to get.

[00:39] And the subject line of that email was four words.

[00:43] Four words that people have long to hear for six years now.

[00:49] And those four words are magic girls are ready.

[00:55] Now we all know the story.

[00:57] We know the story of magic girl and I've been teasing the fact that I thought magic girl was on the horizon for a few weeks now.

[01:08] And I want to come clean now.

[01:11] I want to come clean now to you the listener of my show.

[01:16] Why I've been so interested in magic girl as a game.

[01:21] I want to come clean about some of this stuff I know about this whole American pinball,

[01:28] Zidware creation of magic girl that happened over the last year.

[01:35] And I can't share every detail but I want to give you as much as I'm willing to say without feeling like I'm in breach of any confidentiality agreements I have with people.

[01:49] Or simply just out of respect for individuals that I've been dealing with over this matter.

[01:55] I want to sort of give you guys a top line podcast on magic girl and what happened today in that email that went out to all 25 magic girl owners.

[02:08] First things first, let's read the email that landed in my inbox exactly how I got it.

[02:15] It was from Scott Goldberg over at American Pinball.

[02:20] It says, Good evening and Happy Sunday.

[02:24] I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you in person and have spoken to others on the phone over the last few months and I'm happy to report magic girls are complete.

[02:35] While I know many of you have been waiting for years and may have given up hope, the truth of the matter is,

[02:43] John, along with the team at American Pinball have made that dream a reality.

[02:48] American Pinball has been involved as a third party contract manufacturer through this process.

[02:55] It's important to be clear here that the machines were built to the original Zidware specifications.

[03:02] These are 100% Zidware machines, so any questions should go directly to John and myself.

[03:10] The machines will be ready for pickup or deliveries later this month.

[03:14] Please respond to this email with how you'd like to coordinate efforts and will go from there as there may be some accounting details to be figured out.

[03:24] Please also see the attached letter from John with a few more details.

[03:28] Thanks again and talk soon.

[03:31] Scott, I want to stop there and discuss Scott's part of this communication first and then I'll read John's letter about magic girl.

[03:42] First things first, some of you may be asking, why did you get this letter from Scott explaining that magic girls are ready?

[03:53] I want to let you guys out there know that I have a spot for magic girl.

[04:01] In Opportunity opened up months ago, back when American Pinball first shared photos that they were resurrecting the project.

[04:10] I had an opportunity to get a spot on magic girl and I debated, I went back and forth and I took the spot.

[04:19] It was a gamble, it was a risk.

[04:21] Remember, at that time all we knew and all we saw were more empty cabinets.

[04:26] There was nothing else to make me feel like this was really going to happen.

[04:33] And I'm going to go into further detail about my decision to get in on a magic girl, why I did that later on in this podcast.

[04:43] But I went in on it.

[04:45] And before I go through the whole story, I want to let you guys know that it has not been the same type of pain and frustration that many of you who have waited years have felt.

[05:00] But I'll say this, when they missed bringing it to Expo, when they didn't deliver by end of the year and when there were legal issues with the IP, I was really, really nervous that it wasn't going to happen and my money was gone.

[05:18] Because it was that kind of deal.

[05:20] I bought a spot and if it didn't happen, my money would be gone.

[05:26] I would assume the same risk as the person who went in on magic girl years ago.

[05:31] So when I got this note, I'm excited to get this note.

[05:36] And I'll explain in this podcast that a lot has transpired between when they first revealed they were making magic girl to February of 2017.

[05:45] And I'm going to share some details on what I know.

[05:47] But I'll say this, I was relieved to get this note from Scott because it has been an arduous journey to get to this point.

[05:58] More so than anyone really knows out there.

[06:02] More so than I don't even know most of the details about the actual physical making of these machines.

[06:09] But I do know that nothing about getting magic girl to market or into the hands of its buyers has ever come easy or has ever been a rewarding journey for anyone involved.

[06:24] And I'll explain a little bit more about that.

[06:26] But let's go to Scott's note and there's a few things I want to pick out of his note that are just interesting.

[06:32] So they've done a job of, you know, they've done, they've positioned themselves recently as being a contract manufacturer that was hired by Zidware to make these games.

[06:42] And an American pinball has tried to distance themselves.

[06:48] And we've seen it multiple times. It started at Expo. It started when they brought Balsar back to do Houdini.

[06:54] They've really tried to position themselves away from Zidware.

[06:59] But as I've said before, that will never fully succeed. And it doesn't really make sense trying to distance themselves.

[07:07] Because even in the same paragraph, as they say, these are 100% Zidware machines.

[07:12] So any question should go directly to John and myself. Now, Scott is a, he's a member of the American pinball team.

[07:19] So why would questions about the machine go to Scott?

[07:25] Now, I don't say that sentence and be like, oh, see, they're, they're the same company.

[07:30] I think Scott said that and I appreciate Scott saying that because those of you who know John, that you know that communicating with John is an impossible, impossible task.

[07:41] You want to have a middleman who physically is in close proximity to John frequently enough to get you an answer on your question.

[07:50] So I'm glad Scott put that in there because I'm glad Scott is going to be that liaison between American pinball, Zidware, and the buyers.

[08:00] If you left it all up to John to coordinate, picking up, and shipping of these machines, I think it would be a nightmare.

[08:09] And those of you who have talked to John over the years, you know what I'm talking about.

[08:14] The man cannot stay focused. The man can't complete conversations.

[08:19] You will have a text chain going with him and he'll be talking to you, talking to you, talking to you.

[08:26] And then you just ask one basic question and it'll disappear for weeks. I don't mean hours. I mean weeks on a basic question.

[08:34] And that's how John is. He's scatterbrained. He can't stay focused for very long.

[08:39] And he's not good at details and coordinating communication to owners.

[08:46] And so I'm happy that Scott is helping see this through.

[08:51] So another line that people are picking up on, you know the machines will be ready for pickup later this month,

[08:57] which I think is really interesting because you know a lot of people were emailing me like two weeks, two weeks.

[09:04] That was just bubble barking. Sorry guys. So two weeks, right?

[09:07] So could it be, could we see Magic Girl go out by the end of this month?

[09:13] And if that's the case, I do find it fine and funny that Magic Girl will actually ship before alien pinball.

[09:19] That seems like the whole universe has turned upside down.

[09:23] But the line that people were picking up on was this line here, which says,

[09:28] please respond to this email with how you'd like to coordinate efforts and will go from there as there may be some accounting details to be figured out.

[09:36] Okay. So what I think they mean by that, and I know people were like, was does that mean they're going to ask people to pay more?

[09:42] No, because if we remember, people went in on fall with Magic Girl. This isn't something that people only had like slight deposits.

[09:50] There may be some people that have that, but I don't think that's the case. I think what Scott means by that line when he's talking about some accounting details is probably payment for shipping,

[10:01] how that's going to work and what the cost is going to be. And there may be some additional things too that they offer with the games themselves.

[10:08] We don't know. So that's the communication from Scott.

[10:12] Now, I want to go to the communication from John, John's attached letter, which is dated February 6.

[10:20] I do find it funny that this letter was written a few days ago. They didn't even market today's date, but it says hello.

[10:28] At this time, I would like to announce that your Magic Girl custom pinball machine has been built.

[10:34] It has been assembled by hand utilizing the highest quality material design in parts and is in final testing and packaging now.

[10:43] It can be picked up or shipping arrangements will need to be made. The games have been made under my design, direction, and oversight with many custom features all standard.

[10:53] We have tried to make a really finely crafted original theme pinball with mostly USA made parts.

[11:00] Starting a boutique pinball company and trying to manufacture a truly innovative product has been the most challenging thing I've ever undertaken in my life.

[11:09] It is not as easy as my mind conceived and certainly more than my WMS days.

[11:16] That is the simple truth and as a pinball designer, I've learned a lot of life skills like humility.

[11:22] But I'm pleased to be able to send this letter out to you and proud of the new games we have made here in Chicago.

[11:28] I'm endeavouring to work hard and continue to finish the other games on my drawing board at this time.

[11:34] Please email me or Scott Goldberg with any questions and to make arrangements.

[11:39] John Papaduke.

[11:42] So, what do we think of John's letter?

[11:46] It's crazy to see 2017 on this letter because we have to go back in time to when he first took payments on Magic Girl and that was 2011.

[11:57] It's been six years of past but it looks like we're finally at the end.

[12:02] Both of John's letter and Scott's letter indicate pick up arrangements or shipping arrangements can be made shortly.

[12:11] Now John's letter I did find it because Scott said they're ready and John says that they're still in final testing and packaging now.

[12:23] I would assume that they know that when you say this, this is it.

[12:28] Games need to go out by the end of this month. There is no way there can be another delay.

[12:33] And as I say that, I'm like, wait Chris, what are you talking about?

[12:36] This is all this project has ever been.

[12:39] His statements of words and nothing has ever backed up.

[12:44] But what we hear from this is that this is it, right?

[12:48] I mean, this is John saying I got in over my head. I built something original and unique that I didn't really know how to do.

[12:57] And it's a fully custom made original theme.

[13:00] And it's been a labor of love.

[13:03] And I'll say this. I was texting with John today and he was telling me that the build quality on these machines is absolutely phenomenal.

[13:14] That there's nothing cheap. No corners were cut.

[13:17] I also have heard from John over the past few weeks that this is the machine as he intended it to be.

[13:25] That nothing was left out that no mechs were scrapped.

[13:31] That this is the magic girl that he always wanted it to be and that he considers it to be his finest game.

[13:38] Now, what is he going to say, right? That things were, you know, I don't know.

[13:43] I don't know and you don't know the reason why we don't know because we haven't seen anything.

[13:47] And I think if there's one thing that's missing from today's announcement of a pinball machine being ready.

[13:52] If there's one thing that's missing from a pinball machine that is done.

[13:56] If there's one thing to show buyers what they're about to get.

[14:01] It's not a letter. It's not an email. It's not communication. It's a picture. It's a video.

[14:08] It's some sort of visual proof that what they are saying is true.

[14:13] And I'm not saying that I don't believe them. I'm not saying that at all because I do believe them.

[14:18] And I have talked to Scott frequently and I do consider Scott to be someone who is responsive and tells it kind of like it is.

[14:28] I say kind of like it is because it is impossible. Scott works in the same industry I do in communications and marketing.

[14:35] And it is impossible when you're trying to communicate on behalf of someone like John.

[14:40] Communication is just not a strong skill. It's not where he thrives or excels.

[14:46] And it's impossible because John will tell you one thing. And then if you go out and communicate it.

[14:51] And then John goes and does something else. You constantly look like you don't know what you're talking about.

[14:56] But so if we were to just say like, okay, this goes out and all of a sudden the pinball world gets this news and how does it respond?

[15:06] I mean, I think everyone sort of is in the same boat where first of all just disbelief.

[15:12] Like I can't believe they did it. I can't believe Magic Girl is going to finally come out.

[15:18] Magic Girl has been a sort of running joke, a sort of white whale, a mythological game that has existed only in the mind of John Papaduke.

[15:28] Right? It's a game that could not be resurrected. When Bill tried with Pentasia, it looked how hard it was, it looked how difficult it was.

[15:37] He assembled some very talented pinball people to get on board and they quickly jumped ship after just two weeks of seeing how far John was along.

[15:46] And so I've always curious about how it actually happened and I'm going to get Scott on the show. I'm going to try and get John on the show to actually talk about how they physically went from what we saw with Pentasia to what people are going to get in the box in a couple of weeks.

[16:05] But I'm still curious and I want to go back to why didn't they share just a picture of the game. It's still this mystery, it's still this like clandestine title that nobody can see.

[16:19] And part of me, part of me, like the marketer in me is like, that's still kind of awesome that like they've kept it so secret.

[16:29] I think in a world where like everything leaks and we have such immediate gratification, it's kind of fun to wait to see what someone unboxes.

[16:40] The flip side of that though, I'm like, Chris, you idiot, this isn't like how they plan to roll this thing out. This isn't like one big long marketing tease.

[16:51] This is a project Chris that people have waited six years for and owners haven't seen shit and they deserve to see what they're getting before they make arrangements for shipping or for pickup or for all this stuff because the questions that they have are the questions I have as an owner are the questions just pinball fans have.

[17:12] And those questions are simple question number one, like what is the game look like? What is the game look like? Can we see the final game?

[17:22] Question two is what's the code like? How is this game going to play? Like is there like decent enough code that makes this game entertaining and enjoyable?

[17:34] Now knowing it's a J-pop game guys, you're not going to see like ACDC level coding but we heard from the guy himself who coded this machine. He's in the pin-side thread that he hasn't touched the game in a really long time.

[17:49] Okay, really long time. And so where's the code at? I do know and you're hearing some of this stuff exclusively on Canadian pinball podcast but I do know and what I heard is that John Locke the code recently before saying it's done.

[18:06] So I know he had a sign off on where the code was at but here's the thing. The game's got to have enough code where the stuff works and it doesn't it?

[18:15] Like part of me is like yeah, of course it does. Chris like he can't ship a game and not all the mechs work and not all the magnets work. Then it wouldn't be a game that was the vision John intended it to be.

[18:27] So will all the bells and whistles work on this machine? I think that's a question mark. We haven't seen a gameplay video, right? We haven't seen anything.

[18:35] We know the play field is a little bit different than the play field that was shown by Pentasia, right? They lost the gradient coloring that went behind the artwork. I actually like that. I think the details pop more now.

[18:50] It does look a little bit like a skateboard deck though when you have bare wood next to the colored art.

[18:56] I haven't really seen many machines that have done that. Normally it's all filled in. But I've never also seen a play field as busy and colorful and jammed pack with stuff as I've seen with magic girl.

[19:10] So what does it look like? What is the code like? What else is there? What are the other questions? How does it shoot? Right? How does it shoot?

[19:19] Gameplay video is really on everyone's mind because last time we saw this thing even just shoot without even much of them anything really working.

[19:30] We saw one thing glaring is that the ball could never make it up the ramp. And that has been my question. Did they ever make any changes to the layout to make that shot easier or to make it even possible?

[19:47] A lot of what we saw by Pentasia, how is it corrected? And I know that Zambietti was talking to John but never came back onto the project to make any changes to the artwork.

[20:02] So I'm really curious too because that indicates to me that not many physical changes happened to the play field because no one came in to redraw stuff.

[20:14] And it's always been the question mark with this whole pin is John never really did things in order. He didn't do a white wood. He didn't finish the game mechanically and then handed to the artist to have fun and fill in the art. He did the art first.

[20:30] So I think those are the questions people have about magic girl. The other question immediately becomes what about Raza and Alice in Wonderland buyers? What about the remainder of Zidware customers that have no game that had money with John?

[20:48] How are they supposed to feel about this moment? And I've thought a lot about what these people are going through. I saw frolic is on there because I knew frolic would jump into the thread and go nuts and be like a hyper poster because he is in on Raza and Alice in Wonderland.

[21:05] And there is no real answer yet for those individuals. The only thing we can say is if John successfully delivers magic girl and says that he's going on to his next games, that that definitely will buy him some time with the legal system. It just definitely will. He'll be able to show the judge that hey look game one shipped. It took way longer than I expected. And now moving on the game too.

[21:30] The question for games two and three simply becomes where does the money come to build them? Who's going to be his backer? Is American Pimball interested in partnering up with John or helping John to be John's contract manufacturer for those remaining titles? That I don't know. I don't know what the future holds. It doesn't look great that they took John off of Houdini and gave it to Balser knowing that John that's not the best.

[22:00] When it John's dream themes and knowing that his Houdini was probably one of the reasons why they helped finish the magic girl to get some good will back between John and the community.

[22:10] So I don't want to speculate any further than that. But I think if Raza gets worked on next, I still think you're going to look at a few years before that game will be complete based upon how long it took to get magic girl finished.

[22:26] I could be wrong. Magic girl could be and this this might be accurate people. Magic girl could be in over produce convoluted machine where John just tried to put everything in his head onto one game.

[22:40] And that's why it just took forever because it just didn't work and it may not work. It may not work. Well, it may be the Chinese democracy of Pimball right. It just might be this over produced just too much jammed into one cabinet.

[22:55] And it's sort of like the final you know the final sort of I don't want to say skits of frenic but I you know of a crazy mad designer right.

[23:08] It's like his mad dream when when no one's keeping him in check when he's not surrounded by people at Bally Williams when he's not on a timeline when he has no one to run engineering concepts by you basically let John run his own workshop make his own game.

[23:23] And this is what happens right he kind of spiraled out of control with his creative mind and couldn't land the plane anywhere for years.

[23:33] So to the rasa Alicin wonderland people this is like bitter sweet news for a lot of them but I've said this to many people the only other option would be to just sink the whole thing and then nobody gets anything.

[23:48] So I don't understand how people don't want to see step one being magic girls get made and go out right.

[23:56] This notion of and because it wasn't one game right like you can't just like take magic girls as assets and then like sell them and then deviate those assets to everybody.

[24:07] So you can't do that because like you people bought magic girl like why they should get what they bought and this is like a lesson in life.

[24:14] If if if anyone says they're selling something to you and you pay for that thing and then they sell say they're selling three things and you pay for thing two and three and they say look I built the first thing but I haven't built the other two.

[24:30] You might lose money on two and three. I mean it's just you know I don't know any other way to look at it other than things can go really wrong with pinball manufacturing and everyone I see who goes in and trying to make boutique pinball reality.

[24:46] 90% of the companies have struggled and failed to deliver and ship games. So I don't know I hope Rosic gets made I hope John like figures figured out through this whole process the key to making a game now like he went from knowing he went from being surrounded by people who know how to do it to doing it all on his own.

[25:07] So we'll see what happens there we'll see what happens I don't think of frolic and the other guys who are in on the other titles are going to be extremely excited to see magic girls being unboxed but I also think a lot of people on titles two and three are also in on a magic girl.

[25:23] So it's such a complicated minefield to try and make everybody happy or whole at once it never was going to happen in terms of why I went in on a magic girl why did I make that idiotic plunge as people would say.

[25:39] I really don't have that much of an answer other than the following this is just coming straight from me to you this is the god honest truth I have room for one pinball machine I have physical room for one pinball machine in my life yes could I jam three four machines into my apartment I could do I want to look like those guys who have cluttered spaces filled with games at the age of 40 no I don't I love the way my living room looks.

[26:09] I love that toad in is this great work of art I see pinball machines as works of art I love collecting works of art I love collecting things that visually pop I love pinball machines that are world under glass that when I look down at the machine I see stuff that just makes me smile even before it's turned on I get so much enjoyment out of all the little details that are in the machine whether they're toys or toys.

[26:39] Whether they're mechs whether they're ramps whether it's artwork to me a pinball machine went off should be a world under class and you should look at it and get immersed in the details now when I when I looked at magical for the first time years ago I immediately I immediately want one and I knew I knew they were all already sold out and I knew of the troubles and I knew it wasn't going to happen you know I was working with John in December of and nobody was going to be able to do that.

[27:09] I remember in December of 2014 I started talking to him about magic girl and when the game finally ships all released the full magic girl deck that I created for him on how I thought he should launch it and that was right when like people's patience was truly beginning to run out right but look I don't know how this game is going to be but I do know this I love zombie yeties artwork on it and I love the I love the fact that it is just this like creative mad scientist dream.

[27:39] That might actually come true that's what drove me to that project for me I've always had a you know desire to get connected to projects that become like these mythological things many of you may or may not know this but the reason I can afford to buy pinball machines and the reason my career has been successful is my biggest marketing campaign of all time was was getting actual rose to release Chinese democracy you talk about waiting a long time.

[28:09] For something I waited 17 years for Chinese democracy to come out 17 years I've been on the message board following all of guns and roses movements since 2001 right so I seven years straight I'd been on there by the time I was able to convince one of my clients to do something to get Chinese democracy released and my idea was very simple to offer everyone in America

[28:38] free doctor pepper except for two people if Axel would release Chinese democracy and those two people were slash and bucket head so I'm always drawn to projects that are sort of these later in their career labor of love creations where the artist who's had early fame in life like Axel is very much like John pop a Duke like they early fame in life they hit home runs on their you know their first few titles and then they are going to be a real man.

[29:08] They went into years of doing nothing and this is like their comeback moment right that magic girl was supposed to be John's comeback moment into pinball he saw that pinball was having a resurgence he wanted to be part of it the man has an incredible ego and an incredible flare for feeling that he is one of the greatest pinball designers ever and here's the thing I think John is right in that he is one of the greatest pinball designers of all time I think he does.

[29:38] He does look at pinball in a way that nobody else does the ghost busters that you love so much would not be the ghost busters you love so much if John did not bring zombie Eddie into the pinball world don't fool yourself the artwork that was in machines before John started upping the game with artwork was all garbage for the most part just total garbage and people were spending all this money on stuff that didn't even look nice

[30:06] and artwork is the easiest thing in the world when it comes to applying great artwork to pinball there are so many talented artists out there and you know look I said it before there's a reason why alien Ellie is still not sold out because Andrew didn't put a real artist on the game Gary Sterns finally realizing what hand drawn artwork will do for you but go back and look at tails of the Arabian night go back and look at theater magic but tails is a great one because look at the hand drawn artwork on that machine.

[30:36] Tell me how we got from that to the artwork on let's say tron Ellie or the artwork on a cdc or the artwork you know all the photoshop drag and drop stuff that's that is out there but stern learn looks turns got dirty donny working on something that zombie Eddie on stuff and they're going to keep offering more and more artists on the machine so I think John approaches pinball with a creative flare that nobody else does.

[31:06] As much as people love to shit on John and all the reasons people do shit on John are normally valid John is way more creative skills when it comes to the way he conceptualizes a pinball machine that I think anyone out there I really do I believe that show me any other person who really tackles pinball creativity the same way John does I think John you know even even if he is repetitive

[31:36] his repetitive creations I still think show he is able to think outside the box like nobody else now the problem is this is his outside the box thinking when it comes to pinball is also how he lives all of his life and when I talk about my experience in getting a spot for magic girl I tell you like it is it has been nothing but five six months of hell for me since I put my money down on this machine because

[32:06] trying to communicate with John has been an absolute nightmare every step of the way and I don't I you know it's just like you know it though going in like I knew it going in I knew it from two years ago that you have a conversation with john let me give you an example like what a conversation with john is like it is very simple you'll be talking to him let's say this is November of 2016 John how's it going great working hard on pinball right that I'll be what he says

[32:32] and then John how's magic girl coming and the next statement will be like oh you know they're done like we're done we're just finalizing them I say cool cool so they're complete and then the next sentence will be like well there's you know there's still some more tweaking to be done on it and it's like here we are all over again you know the game is always been ninety five percent done so that is why the letter today

[32:56] means so much if it's true and I'm going to take it at its face value but again we haven't seen anything so that's what it's like communicating with john and I think

[33:06] AP didn't fully realize what they were getting into I'm not sure they fully realize the deal that john had signed with them and I'm not sure john was 100% honest about the penteja part of this whole thing so let's talk about that for a little bit because if you remember penteja

[33:25] when they came on board to help john and by penteja I mean Bill Brandis and his team they acquired the IP rights to magic girl now when Bill decided that it wasn't worth any more time and money and decided to walk away from the project Bill contractually still own the IP now that's that was a smart move by Bill

[33:53] Bill is a very smart man I also consider Bill to be a friend I've been in close communication with Bill for months and him and I have talked at length about everything going on I will not disclose the details of our conversation but the part that people fail to realize is Bill protected his money and if you own the IP rights to magic girl and raza and what not and someone goes to build that machine

[34:22] without checking with you there's a problem and that is what the legal problem became with this whole situation you know to use a different example if I own the rights to make Batman movies right I buy the rights to make Batman films I own it and I just decide you know I go on to the set one day and john pop it is the director of a Batman movie and he he's like a mess and I say look john I'm not going to make your Batman movie it's just it's it's just there's too much

[34:51] uncertainty here and you're burning through money and close up shop like this is done this Batman production is not happening and that doesn't mean that like I don't still own the rights to Batman right I still own them and then but here's the here's the interesting part let's say I hear that someone a year later has decided to start filming another Batman movie or finishing the Batman movie that john started without contacting me that's the way I'm going to do it.

[35:21] That's what they do they don't have legal permission to do that and so that that was like the big hurdle and when that hurdle occurred I was again having money I had money down at this point and at the beginning I really didn't want to disclose any of the details about why I was so interested in magic girl I didn't even tell Bill I had a spot and Bill from day one Bill and Iceman and everybody I talked to was like dude don't buy a spot like don't go in on magic girl just don't.

[35:51] Like this we've been through this.

[35:53] Shtcho before like we've been in this rodeo and like don't get involved like save your money don't get involved and I told him I was an in you know I'm just I'm talking to someone I might do something and I you know I I didn't fully disclose that I it was already too late for me like I already gone in and it was a deal that I you know I was nervous about making but it was a deal that was a deal that was a deal that was a deal I thought it was going to be a deal that was like I'm just going to do something.

[36:15] And it was a deal that I was nervous about making, but it was a deal that was good for both parties involved.

[36:22] I'm not going to disclose what the deal was. I'm not going to disclose who it was with.

[36:27] I'm not going to disclose the price of what I paid.

[36:30] But both parties were happy when the deal was signed.

[36:35] Now after the deal was signed, that's when I started to worry.

[36:38] My first big red flag was expo.

[36:41] So there I am. I had done the deal. I'm at expo.

[36:46] And before, I'll say this, before I went to expo, I was told by American Pimball that Houdini was absolutely flipping.

[36:55] I mean, Houdini was ready to be shown at expo.

[36:58] And I use that information.

[37:00] I use that information to feel good about their ability to make magic, girl.

[37:05] And so I then hear that they're going to bring Chris from Coin takers, Magic Girl, to expo.

[37:13] Remember that famous Facebook post?

[37:15] Like, here are the cabinets and Chris, guess what?

[37:18] You're going to be able to take yours home from the show.

[37:21] So I was excited because I did my deal in September.

[37:25] And there I am thinking, OK, come October, the Magic Girls are going to be done.

[37:30] And then the rest of them are going to be by the end of the year.

[37:32] But Chris is going to have it.

[37:33] And it's a real thing.

[37:34] And they figured out how to solve the puzzle that is Magic Girl.

[37:38] And then we know what happens.

[37:40] They all of a sudden games aren't done.

[37:44] Nothing comes to expo.

[37:46] They came to expo.

[37:47] And I listened to them at expo.

[37:49] And when they said, they started to talk.

[37:52] And they were really distancing themselves from John and Balser's up there.

[37:56] Talking like, Houdini needs to be re-hauled.

[37:59] I just like sunk down in my seat and said, shit.

[38:03] I was with Brenda.

[38:05] And my other friend, I said, fuck, I think I just lost my money.

[38:09] I really do.

[38:09] I think these guys are now seeing what everyone else has seen

[38:14] and that they inherited Magic Girl.

[38:17] And John told them it's 90% done.

[38:20] And it's going to be 90% done for the next 90 years.

[38:22] And then it's over.

[38:24] They're just going to lose patience and boot them out of there.

[38:26] And that was how I came away from that show.

[38:30] And so then between that period, between expo and December, right?

[38:35] December 31st, being the date they said they were going to have all Magic Girls out the

[38:40] door, I really got involved.

[38:42] I got involved with Bill, with Scott, with John, trying to get all parties to see eye to

[38:48] eye on on what could the possible solution be.

[38:51] Now let me tell you something.

[38:52] I'm not going to go into details.

[38:54] I can't.

[38:55] But trying to coordinate a conversation between John and Bill or John and me and John and

[39:02] Scott, just John and anybody.

[39:04] It's the most impossible thing in the world.

[39:08] I mean, I laugh because I have a text message to John that basically said something along

[39:13] the lines of John.

[39:15] Need an answer today for something that had to pertain to like getting all the legal parties

[39:21] together, right?

[39:22] I need an answer today, John.

[39:23] Can you just tell me today?

[39:25] He responds, yes, let's chat next week.

[39:29] Right, so like, right there, like, John, I need it you today and you said let's talk next

[39:33] week.

[39:34] And that's what it's like dealing with John.

[39:35] The man doesn't know time or space or deadlines or schedules.

[39:41] You can't schedule stuff.

[39:44] So so much of it is on the fly.

[39:47] But it was finally able to get John and Bill talking and all the parties involved and

[39:52] call my heads prevailed and everybody worked everything out.

[39:56] That's all you're going to get from me.

[39:58] I'm not going to go into any details on legal issues or what not or what was what or who

[40:04] gets what or what was signed over.

[40:06] No, none of that is going to be disclosed.

[40:09] But they they came to an agreement on I'm getting the magic rolls out.

[40:14] And so I hear that, but I say this every day, every single day was a roller coaster.

[40:21] It was like it was like an accelerated condensed kind of pain.

[40:25] I'm sure the rest of the owners have felt over the last six years because basically nothing

[40:31] is ever nothing is ever spoken about in terms of finality.

[40:37] And even when we get the letter today, you still don't get a picture.

[40:40] You still don't get a video.

[40:41] I asked I asked many times for Scott.

[40:43] Just send me a picture of the play field.

[40:45] Like what's being worked on John?

[40:47] Can you just send me a picture of what you're working so hard on?

[40:50] Nothing.

[40:51] Still it's still secrecy.

[40:53] And even today on February 13th, after getting this letter, I say this with all honesty, I

[40:59] say this that I still think it could collapse.

[41:03] I still think it could not come out.

[41:05] I still think something could go wrong between now and the time people are supposed to pick

[41:10] it up.

[41:11] And I'll always feel that way because this whole thing has always been a state of insecurity,

[41:19] a pressure cooker scenario and storyline.

[41:23] But I hope I'm wrong.

[41:24] I hope I've turned to my right in a few weeks and there's a magic girl there.

[41:29] Now let me talk hypothetically about if they are done, how am I going to get the machine?

[41:36] I'm absolutely going to go pick it up.

[41:38] There is no way I'm going to let a shipping company handle magic girl.

[41:43] Simply because I don't even care if you can ensure it, you'll just never get another

[41:47] one.

[41:48] This is it.

[41:50] This is really it.

[41:51] You got one chance to get this thing home safely.

[41:54] If it gets destroyed or fucked up, a good luck trying to deal with them on a replacement

[41:59] machine or replacement parts.

[42:04] So my plan was to fly out there and drive it back.

[42:10] I might make the trip with Chris from CoinTaker.

[42:14] I might make it with some other people.

[42:16] I'm not sure.

[42:17] I mean, everyone's just trying to figure it out.

[42:20] It's been hard because they haven't told us anything specific yet.

[42:24] I emailed back today.

[42:26] I'm waiting to hear.

[42:27] But I need a date.

[42:29] It's really, if you can hear the frustration in my voice, the frustrating thing is this.

[42:35] I have work.

[42:37] Everyone else out there probably has a job.

[42:39] To go get a magic girl and take time off from work to go pick up a machine is just something

[42:45] I would like to have at least a week or two notice to let people I work with know I'm

[42:50] going to be out those days.

[42:52] I don't want to have to just drop everything I'm doing and go fly out there and take two

[42:58] working days to go pick it up.

[43:00] I don't want to burn a weekend.

[43:02] I can't burn it this weekend because Brenda's parents are coming.

[43:06] I'd rather just get it over with as soon as possible.

[43:11] So it is what it is though.

[43:14] I've heard this in the thread.

[43:16] I got to be honest.

[43:17] I don't really care what condition the code is in.

[43:19] I don't really care about anything other than getting the machine.

[43:24] I really don't care.

[43:28] You pay a lot of money and you want a rare pinball item, a work of art.

[43:33] I think magic girl will be that.

[43:35] What condition it's in?

[43:37] We'll see.

[43:38] Will fans be able to unlock the code and have someone program it to its full potential?

[43:44] Who knows?

[43:45] I saw people saying no one's going to do that because there's only 25 machines and

[43:49] I say bullshit.

[43:51] That's not true.

[43:52] When is the pinball hobby been known to shut down working on something?

[43:58] Because I think there's a lot of pride and glory to be the guy who codes John's masterpiece

[44:03] to its full potential.

[44:05] Will that happen?

[44:06] I don't know.

[44:07] It just seems like a ginormous amount of work.

[44:10] If you're coding it, you then have to add music and sounds and call outs and all these

[44:15] things that aren't there currently.

[44:17] I think the best bet would be for the owners to get money together and pay the original

[44:23] coder to finish it.

[44:24] That's what I think would be the smart move.

[44:28] If everyone just threw in, think about it like this.

[44:30] If everyone just threw in a thousand dollars, that guy would get twenty-five thousand dollars.

[44:37] I didn't even mention there's a lot of questions about is everyone going to get a machine that

[44:43] was promised a machine?

[44:44] Again, I covered this before but I don't really think all those handshake deals are going

[44:50] to come through.

[44:51] I think it's a learning experience for everybody.

[44:54] You've got to do work.

[44:55] You've got to get paid for your work upfront.

[44:57] We ask Ork how he feels about working on the alien all this time.

[45:00] He hasn't seen a buck.

[45:02] That sucks.

[45:03] Zombie Yeti didn't get what he was promised.

[45:07] That sucks.

[45:08] I hope everyone learns.

[45:09] Get paid.

[45:10] This is...

[45:11] Come on.

[45:12] Everyone's got to put on their adult pants and not let the stars of Pimball cloud their

[45:16] better judgments.

[45:18] I've been very critical of pre-ordering.

[45:21] I've been down and out.

[45:22] I've got to say this.

[45:23] I've been a little down and out over the last few months with this hobby.

[45:29] This is why Brenda will tell you I've had many sleepless nights.

[45:34] I've had many periods of ajada and just hair pulling moments because I've been waiting

[45:41] and waiting and waiting for good news about magic girls.

[45:45] I think we're there.

[45:46] I think we're there.

[45:47] I'm trying to think if there's any other details that I want to share with you about

[45:51] this that you just don't know.

[45:54] I'm going to go into further detail.

[45:56] I want to get Bill on the show.

[45:58] If he'll talk about it.

[46:00] I want to get Chris on the show.

[46:01] I'd love to interview other magic girl people and rods of people.

[46:04] But here's the thing.

[46:05] Nobody wants to talk yet.

[46:07] Nobody wants to talk.

[46:08] I understand why.

[46:11] Everything just feels like it's not real.

[46:13] It just feels like we got an email and a letter.

[46:16] But until we see stuff, it just doesn't feel real to me.

[46:19] I mean, I'm half excited.

[46:22] I'm half excited.

[46:24] Nobody wants to jinx it either.

[46:26] Nobody wants to come on and start celebrating a moment that still hasn't happened.

[46:33] It's not the most feel good moment either because you still know that there are people

[46:38] that lost and are waiting and are in pain.

[46:43] That's not good either.

[46:45] I hope John realized his mistakes and can figure out a way to make those other buyers whole.

[46:52] I know that's what he plans to do.

[46:54] Whether or not he can do it, I don't know yet.

[46:57] I really don't know.

[46:58] I'll say this.

[47:00] I chased.

[47:01] I chased.

[47:02] I bought the hype.

[47:03] I ran to put my money into a magic girl.

[47:07] The second I saw, those cabinets from American Pimball.

[47:10] And I did everything that I tell you guys not to do.

[47:15] I behaved in a way that is contrarian to the advice I give on this show.

[47:22] And the reason I start to give more and more of that advice is I've hated every single

[47:27] day waiting in limbo for a response.

[47:31] This hasn't been fun.

[47:33] This hasn't been enjoyable.

[47:35] This hasn't been worth the money.

[47:39] And I know that the game won't be worth it.

[47:42] See that's the thing.

[47:43] Yeah, it'll be cool.

[47:45] Like having a magic girl will be cool.

[47:47] But it will never erase six years of pain for people.

[47:51] It just won't.

[47:52] Because at the end of the day, magic girl will be like Chinese democracy.

[47:56] It'll be something that is complex.

[47:59] It'll be something that will never happen again.

[48:02] You'll never see so much going to one album or one Pimball machine.

[48:08] And it'll never be worth it.

[48:11] Because the pain and suffering of the weight has made the expectations for it so high.

[48:18] And there's no way around it.

[48:19] There's no way around letting your expectations run wild, especially because both artists,

[48:27] both Axel and John have delivered experiences that were so magical and so memorable.

[48:34] And how could they not, after taking so much time, recreate that or do something even

[48:41] better?

[48:42] And that's really what we're investing in is the dream that that thing will be recreated

[48:48] and that feeling we got when we first played those machines by John or we first heard

[48:52] Sweet Child of Mine or welcome to the jungle.

[48:55] Like we're going to get that same feeling and excitement all over again.

[48:58] I mean, we're chasing nostalgia.

[49:01] We're chasing magic.

[49:02] The problem with magic and nostalgia is that it's lightening in a bottle, folks.

[49:08] It happens serendipitously, not because they tried or not because they had too much time

[49:13] to think about it, because they just did it.

[49:16] It took 17 years for Axel Rose to put all the pieces together for Chinese democracy.

[49:22] And in the end, it still didn't feel like a complete album.

[49:26] In the end, songs still had issues with sound mixing.

[49:29] In the end, it was a cohesive opus.

[49:33] I love it.

[49:34] I tell people it's like a fine cognac.

[49:36] You have to really study each track to hear all the different notes going on.

[49:41] But at the end of the day, it's not nearly as much fun or as accessible as Sweet Child

[49:47] of Mine or welcome to the jungle or Paradise City.

[49:51] In all intents and purposes, it's a failure when you compare it to his earlier material.

[49:58] And the same true will probably happen with magic girl.

[50:00] You don't have little bits and pieces that remind you of why John Papaduke is such a

[50:06] celebrated figure in Pimbal.

[50:09] But in the end, it will probably be overproduced.

[50:11] There will probably be too many layers to the game to truly appreciate any one or two things.

[50:17] And there might almost be too much going on that distracts the game's ability to just

[50:22] have flow.

[50:23] Right?

[50:24] The simple things that people like in Pimbal machines, like flow and simplicity and understanding

[50:29] what to shoot at and what to do.

[50:32] And that's the reality of these things.

[50:36] And then why do I do it?

[50:37] Why am I gluttony for punishment?

[50:38] Why am I chasing after this thing?

[50:41] I don't know.

[50:42] I really don't know.

[50:43] It's part of life.

[50:45] It's part of life.

[50:46] It's part of the reason why I just put my money down.

[50:49] And I'm number one on the list to get a Dodge Demon.

[50:53] Because in any hobby where you're collecting something or you're into something, you get

[50:58] addicted to the next thing.

[51:01] You need the next thing.

[51:02] It's like chasing that high.

[51:04] For me, again, I'm just going to be honest.

[51:06] And maybe some of you guys can relate to this.

[51:08] Maybe some of you guys can't.

[51:10] But my philosophy on life is simple.

[51:12] That life is really short.

[51:14] I've lost friends in tragic ways.

[51:17] I've lost family members to cancer.

[51:20] My mom has been handicapped for many years.

[51:24] She lives in constant pain.

[51:26] My father worked in corporate America for a long time and was basically forced into

[51:30] early retirement.

[51:32] And I've seen so much in my 40 years.

[51:36] That has taught me a few things.

[51:37] One thing is life is short and you need stuff to look forward to.

[51:42] You need stuff to get excited about and to look forward to.

[51:47] Sometimes those things that we're chasing after are bring us joy.

[51:51] Sometimes they bring us pain.

[51:53] Everyone has their vices.

[51:55] For us, it's pinball.

[51:56] Pinball is just such a niche within a niche within a niche thing.

[52:01] And I'm really excited about looking forward to my next pinball machine.

[52:05] I know most of you always feel that way.

[52:07] And magic girl has always excited me because it's just such a mystery.

[52:12] The number one emotion.

[52:13] And I work in marketing so I know that dumb stuff like this.

[52:16] The number one emotion.

[52:18] The number one emotion that draws our attention.

[52:20] That makes us aware.

[52:21] That makes us engage.

[52:22] The number one emotion is curiosity.

[52:26] When something makes us curious, we're drawn to it.

[52:29] And no game out there makes me nearly as curious as magic girl.

[52:33] I'm not curious to see what Stern's going to really do next.

[52:37] I am.

[52:38] I lie.

[52:38] I'm a little bit curious.

[52:40] But you kind of know what you're going to get from Stern.

[52:42] I was really curious about dialed in.

[52:44] And I was really surprised and excited about what Jack showed.

[52:50] I'm not really curious about at the same level that I am with magic girl because so much

[52:56] of it has been shrouded in secrecy.

[52:59] So life is short and we need stuff to look forward to.

[53:03] And sometimes it is healthy to have those things be years out.

[53:07] Now look, a lot of people look forward to having kids, look forward to seeing their daughters

[53:12] get married, all the different things, all the different elements of life that we have

[53:16] to look forward to are important in life.

[53:18] And most of the things that we should look forward to should not be like materialistic

[53:23] things, right?

[53:24] They shouldn't be good.

[53:25] They shouldn't be toys.

[53:27] And I've said this, if the main thing in life you're looking forward to is a pinball machine,

[53:33] your life is broken.

[53:35] You need to reevaluate your life.

[53:37] If this is the thing that brings you the most pleasure in life, I think you need to reevaluate

[53:42] your life.

[53:43] If you're spending most of your free time on pin-side, you need to reevaluate your

[53:48] life.

[53:49] There are far more important things on a daily basis that we should look forward to than

[53:55] pinball.

[53:56] We should look forward to friends and family and things that actually love us and care

[54:00] for us.

[54:01] But when you have those things in order, then it's really fun to look forward to pinball.

[54:07] Then it's really fun to go on to pin-side and shoot the shit with your friends.

[54:12] Then it's really fun to go to shows and tournaments and do all the things that make pinball fun.

[54:19] But if it is the center of your universe, then you've gone too far.

[54:22] I mean, I see so many tournament players.

[54:24] It's all they do every night.

[54:26] And the rest of their life, it's like they have nothing else to talk about and know

[54:29] their interests or know they're like, nothing else going on.

[54:34] And I just think balance is the key.

[54:37] And Magic Girls put my life out of balance.

[54:39] But I look forward to one day getting married to Brenda.

[54:43] I look forward to our apartment where I can actually have more than one pinball machine.

[54:47] And I look forward to every day with Bubba.

[54:50] I look forward to going to the gym every day and working out.

[54:54] These are the things that are like on my mind.

[54:57] I look forward to my next big case study at work that will bump my career up.

[55:02] How do I get higher in my career?

[55:05] And I look forward to showing my bosses just what I'm capable of.

[55:10] So there's so much in life that we look forward to.

[55:13] But the entertainment things that we look forward to are so much fun.

[55:16] Pinball is so much fun to look forward to.

[55:19] So that's why I got into it.

[55:21] And I do feel like I dodged a bullet because the other game I was going to consider getting

[55:26] was Batman Super Ellie.

[55:28] And I'm not knocking that you guys who own it.

[55:31] But at the end of the day I'd much rather have a Magic Girl than a Batman Super Ellie

[55:36] as my like premium collectible item.

[55:39] I'd even rather have that Big Bang bar that's on Pinside.

[55:42] Someone needs to go buy that.

[55:43] You guys are all such fools.

[55:45] Like seriously, how can people legitimately buy three Stern Pinball machines versus that

[55:56] Big Bang bar?

[55:57] I mean, Sterns are like a dime a dozen and they should be.

[56:00] They're the mass produced company.

[56:02] And that's sort of how I justified Magic Girl to Brendan in my own head.

[56:06] I was like, look, at the end of the day, there's only going to be 25 locations on Planet

[56:13] Earth where you can stand in front of a machine and experience Magic Girl.

[56:18] Only 25 places on the entire planet.

[56:21] There are thousands of places on the planet where you can experience Batman or Ghostbusters

[56:26] or Tron.

[56:27] You know, so it's just going to be that special pin.

[56:31] And I hope they keep it at that number.

[56:33] If they remake it, I swear to God, I'm just quitting this hobby because we need Grail

[56:39] games.

[56:40] We need items to chase after.

[56:42] We need items that should feel special when you see it out in the wild for the first

[56:48] time.

[56:49] If we remove that from this hobby and just replicate and reproduce everything, I think

[56:53] you lose a lot of what makes the collectible side of the hobby fun.

[56:57] And let's face it, this whole hobby is only going to be a collectible hobby or collectors

[57:04] hobby in the near future.

[57:06] So that's it.

[57:07] I talked for an hour.

[57:09] I gave you guys, I'm tired.

[57:11] I don't know if you can hear it in my voice, but it's only 5 o'clock and I'm exhausted because

[57:16] I know how long this journey's been and I hope it's over and I hope you guys can see video

[57:23] and images of Magic Girl.

[57:25] And if you're ever in New York City and I do end up getting it, I hope Canada's Arcade

[57:31] becomes a destination for some of you guys to just hang out, see a Magic Girl and drink

[57:36] a beer.

[57:37] And I think it's time.

[57:39] Miracles have happened.

[57:40] If Magic Girl comes out, that's a miracle.

[57:43] You know what the next miracle needs to be?

[57:45] Robin needs to let Canada back on Pinside.

[57:48] You guys who listen to this show, you need to hit up the moderators and be like, is it

[57:52] a timely let Canada back on Pinside?

[57:54] I mean, what else have I done since getting banned?

[57:58] I've stayed true to this hobby.

[58:00] I've given you guys a year's worth of entertainment.

[58:03] I've done everything I can to show that, you know what?

[58:07] I'm not this like crazy troll that they tried to paint me into.

[58:11] You know, I'm not that guy.

[58:15] I don't think so.

[58:18] So that's it.

[58:20] Will we see Magic Girl within the next couple of weeks?

[58:23] It's Valentine's Day tomorrow, people.

[58:25] So love your significant other.

[58:28] Don't waste any of her time talking about the news around Magic Girl.

[58:32] I actually have to go to, go get Brenda something really nice.

[58:36] She's been such a sport through this whole process.

[58:38] I can't believe, you know, you talk about, and on this, you talk about a woman who you

[58:42] know is a keeper.

[58:44] It's a woman who, who sticks by your side and still loves you when after dating her for

[58:52] over two and a half three years, you haven't put a ring on her finger.

[58:56] She's living inside an arcade and she sees you spend enough money for a beautiful ring

[59:03] on a Magic Girl.

[59:05] And she stays with you.

[59:07] That is a keeper.

[59:08] And because of that Brenda, she's not, she doesn't listen to this show.

[59:11] Your ring is going to be much nicer than Magic Girl.

[59:14] That's it everyone.

[59:15] Much love.

[59:16] Canada.

[59:17] Magic Girl.

[59:18] Miracles do happen.

[59:20] Good night.
