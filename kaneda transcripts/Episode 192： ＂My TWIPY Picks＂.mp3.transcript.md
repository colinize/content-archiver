[00:00] One five day, you look at me, and you will know about us.

[00:08] Miss will you be me?

[00:11] One five day, you're gonna want me for your birth.

[00:24] Welcome to episode 192 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Canada, coming at you from the holiday in Express in Santa Barbara, California.

[00:34] I'm here on business. I'm a little tired. Yesterday when I came in, I missed my connecting flight.

[00:40] A lot of time in airports in the sky to come out for a meeting on Thursday.

[00:46] That's only gonna be an hour and a half, but it's what I do for a living, and I go where they tell me to go.

[00:52] Because I love my job, and I respect my bosses, and when they want me to go in and travel the world, I'll go there.

[01:00] Let's talk pinball. So on this episode, what I want to do is talk about the Twippy Awards.

[01:05] I want to give my picks for what I think are the winners, or should be the winners.

[01:10] In each of the categories, Jeff has outlined in the Twippy Awards. Now, I have to give Jeff some advice.

[01:17] I can't go back after voting. I can't go back and see which games were nominated for each category.

[01:25] Because once you vote, you vote, and there's, and nowhere on his website does he list the nominees.

[01:30] And I think that's kind of a mistake, and I hope he changes that next year, because I was so planning to go down each category and tell you which nominees there were, and who I picked as the winner, but I can't.

[01:40] I can't find it anywhere. So I'm just gonna say which games I think should win each award.

[01:44] Alright, we'll do that at the end of the show.

[01:47] Let's start off the show. This is gonna be a little bit of a news recap show.

[01:51] Let's start off with talking about the man, the guy, the reason why there are even pinball podcasts out there.

[01:59] The man is back. And you know him as Nate Schivers, and I was happy to see Nate put up a new pinball podcast, a new coast-to-coast podcast.

[02:06] He has such a perfect voice for podcasting, and you know, he's been doing it for years.

[02:12] I mean, four years ago, it was pretty much just Nate, and I think Spooky had pinball podcasts, and there was like, you know, a couple arcade podcasts out there.

[02:21] But now we have like so many pinball podcasts. I can't even keep up with all of them. I mean, I can only really listen to mine, because it's by far the best, right?

[02:29] No, I'm interested to see who wins the Twippy. It's probably gonna be Nate, even though he's done just a few shows like all year.

[02:36] But what's interesting about Nate when he came back is he kind of gave us a reason why he hasn't really been up for it.

[02:43] And one of the reasons was just like the election that happened last year, and then it sort of bummed him out, and I know he's living overseas, and I'm sure over in Europe looking at the United States and the political things going on, and the social things going on.

[03:00] It's always a lot more difficult. Sometimes when you step back from America, and you see how people perceive us, because I'm not gonna get political. I'm not. I said I wasn't gonna do it, but I'm just saying, I can see why that puts people in a bad mood.

[03:14] I mean, so many people I've been working with, it's really hurt them and impacted them too, because people just don't feel inspired and motivated by the current leadership or political systems, right?

[03:25] And I'll say that for both Democrats and Republicans, as I think the world needs to be inspired again. I think it needs to happen in all areas of life, not just politics, but even Pimball, you could say, has a lack of inspiring work going on.

[03:40] No, let's go to Pimball. So Nate is back, and it was great to hear him talk about Pimball. He doesn't really have access to much Pimball.

[03:49] And I think because of that, it makes it hard for him to give a point of view that is based on firsthand experiences with games.

[03:58] You know, he reviewed Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy recently. He's like, I really like them. I really like these two games. And I know a lot of us, we get really hypercritical about games, and we tear games down, and we're always bitching about games and this and that.

[04:13] Go on a magic girl for a year, and then every other machine seems incredible. And I think what Nate's experiencing is when you step away from having such access to games, and you don't play so much, and you don't care so much, or like read about it every day in and day out, you can actually enjoy Pimball much, much more.

[04:36] There's something to be said about sort of stepping away from this hobby and giving yourself enough time to recharge and rethink about all these games.

[04:47] Now, I'll say that with a caveat. I do not believe that all Pimball is great. I do not. I do not think you can have a commentary on Pimball and just say you love all Pimball.

[05:00] And that every Pimball machine that comes out is a great thing, because it's like saying all movies are good, or every meal you get is a great meal, because food is good. Films are good.

[05:13] I think Pimball is a subjective product. I think it's a work of art. I think it's a toy. But I also think it's open for criticism, and the criticism is fair and valid.

[05:24] And I don't think we should just celebrate every single machine that comes out. I don't. I think if stuff comes out, and there's corners that are cut, and the quality is not there, and it lacks inspiration, it lacks creativity, I think we're in our right to criticize it, because these things are for sale, and they are asking for our money.

[05:48] So it's okay if we criticize them every now and then. All right. So let's go down what's going on in the hobby. I've got some notes actually on this podcast, and then we are going to do our Twippy Awards. I'm really excited. I don't even know what I'm going to pick. I'm going to do it live. I'm going to give you like my gut reaction. All right. So let's start with this news first.

[06:10] There is new Batman code out Batman code 0.85 came out. I was able to install it pretty easily. It took a while. I was surprised how long it took to download to the USB stick, and then download to the game itself took about.

[06:27] I want to say like an hour, maybe a little bit more. It depends how fast your internet connection is. So what do I think of Batman code 0.85? So the major changes in the new code is that the minor villains are now. There's two more minor villains. There's the mad hatter. And I think it's shame the cowboy. I believe that's his name. And their modes are in there. Now what I really like about it is the cowboy mode. You're like hurting hurting these like cows, and it's a two ball multi ball. That's starting.

[06:57] And I think that's a really, really, really smart thing for Lyman to put a multi ball into the game. That's not as hard to unlock as the other multi ball, the three ball multi ball because that right orbit shot. It just continues to be the most frustrating shot on the game for me.

[07:15] Sometimes I can hit it smoothly, but I think the issue with it is the crane blocks the access to that shot. And I think because of that, you're kind of always guessing. It's at the end of that left flipper. You need to hit.

[07:28] But it's never doesn't feel as smooth as when I hit the left orbit shot. So that there's a two ball multi ball. They fixed a lot of the sound sort of inconsistencies. So when Batman's like, let's get to the bat pole. Like it comes through properly.

[07:43] The mad hat or mode is really great. The sheer volume, the sheer volume of clips in this game is incredible. I know that some people are starting to speculate that this will go down as Stern's best theme in a great at pinball machine of all time.

[08:01] And I think in terms of clips, music, call out to someone, someone hit me up and they said, you know, Chris, I heard you say that, but you're a hypocrite because you've been saying that LCD screens don't equal theme integration that and and they're right. I don't think Batman is like the best theme integrated pin because of video clips.

[08:25] It's awesome that they're all in there and the way they're used is great. But I think Batman is one of the best theme integrated pins because it has call outs from Adam Ward, Adam Ward, Adam West. I'm tired. Adam West and Bert Ward. So it has the original actors calling out pinball terms throughout the entire game, which is incredible. And the fact that Adam West recently passed away.

[08:49] And one of his last projects makes it even more special that sort of this game is like immortalizing him and is one of his last sort of complete times like the last time we'll hear his voice will be in a pinball machine is incredible.

[09:03] The music is like perfectly aligned with the show and that's the thing to me about Batman and I love so much and I think the music of this game is one of the most underrated things that's discussed. So whenever you start a new villain mode, the music track changes so drastically to fit to fit each villain and not just the major villains, the minor villains and it's like there's so much going on from an audio visual level.

[09:32] That makes this game so much fun to play and again, you have to play one. You have to really start to play one. The other part that's really exciting people is this is only 0.85.

[09:45] And there's a lot more coming. I still haven't seen like the TV seasons coded in. I think the minor villains, you might actually battle them through all three seasons.

[09:57] So like season one season two season three. So the depth of this game is going to be super super incredible. It really is and I mean, you can tell I'm excited because there's more to come.

[10:09] But I finally think that Batman is is a game worth owning and I think it's going to go down as one of Stern's best theme integrated pins in a long time. And I think the lesson here just to take away from it is that Stern should look to properties where they can get similar as the game.

[10:26] Similar assets, they should look to properties where they can get it all. They can get the clips. They can get the actors. They can they can use the music. Everything that you would want in a pinball machine. You have because when you read the Batman owners club when you read people talking about this game.

[10:46] You don't have any bitching about the code anymore. You don't have any bitching about I wish there was this music or which they got better actors or voices. No, no, you don't hear any of that.

[10:58] There's literally just people enjoying the game, which is always a sign that the pinball machine is is doing things right. All right. So Batman 8.5 code lots of excitement there. What else is going on in pinball? So I'm going down my list.

[11:14] Okay, so there's an image that was starting to be passed around on Aussie Arcade form. And it's an image of a very beautiful and seductively sort of airbrushed artwork version of Wonder Woman.

[11:30] And I had a bunch of people send it to me via Facebook. Now it was her face and it was on and then there was a stern logo underneath her face sort of like near her neckline. And it was on a computer screen. And so it's being passed around Aussie Arcade forum as a new stern title.

[11:50] And everyone is saying Wonder Woman. And then Ryan from head to head pinball hits me up and said, I don't know. I looked for 20 minutes. Chris and I couldn't find the image anywhere. So it must be. It must be a new pinball machine. Yeah, because that confirms it. So what I did is I went on Deviant Art and I typed in Wonder Woman. And I found the source image in less than two minutes. And I sent it to Ryan. And I said, see, here you go. Now make sure you tell all your cronies on Aussie Arcade.

[12:19] Aussie Arcade forum that it was Canada who debunked the mystery of Wonder Woman pinball. Look, I don't know. I have not heard Wonder Woman in any of the rumored titles coming out from stern. In fact, I've I know a lot of titles coming out from stern and Wonder Woman is not on any of those lists. So I think we can finally put that that rumored to rest. Now speaking of new titles.

[12:47] This week in pinball, you know, they'd have their whole list of like there's going to be two new pinball games coming out or not, not maybe because there's these are two themes that have been secured to make pinball machine. So there's a difference right you can you can secure the license to a game, but the game might never come out. And those two themes I want to give my opinions on them are Pulp Fiction and the Beatles. Now what do I think of these two titles? I got some information on on on.

[13:17] On the Beatles for people. Okay, I'm going to confirm for the world right now that the Beatles pinball is coming out. I'm also going to confirm for the world that the Beatles pinball is not yellow submarine based. I keep seeing that rumor going all over the place.

[13:36] So that's all I'm going to say on the Beatles. Now it's coming out. I'm not sure, but I think it's going to be the Kapow title that is rumored to be in the works. I haven't seen anything on it. I haven't seen any artwork. I have no idea.

[13:49] The rumor release date for the Beatles is we should see it at expo this year. So that's what I'm hearing. So do I care? Absolutely not. I am not a fan of the Beatles. I don't hate the Beatles music.

[14:05] I'm just not a fan of the Beatles. I'm allowed not to be. I always was always curious as to like beat Romania. And it sort of like skipped me or something. I don't know. I don't like the Beatles that much. I don't know any friends who like the Beatles that much. I don't go to parties and hear the Beatles ever. It's sort of just a generation earlier.

[14:24] And I don't see the appeal in a Beatles pinball machine. But again, I also understand that Beatles are humongous that there is incredible appeal for the Beatles as a band. Now do Beatles fans and pinball fans do they crossover?

[14:45] And that's the question I have is will it be a big seller? Is it a take my money now kind of game for you guys out there? Now hit me up. Email me. Let me know what you think because I'm curious to see what people's reactions going to be because you know it's coming out. We'll see how it does.

[15:03] Pope fiction as a theme for pinball. I think is I don't know. I don't like that. I just I just think pinball should be more campy, more fun, more like upbeat and colorful themes. Pope fiction is a phenomenal movie.

[15:21] But I don't really want to Pope fiction pinball machine. I just don't. I mean it's it feels like the sopranos. It just feels like these sort of you know like good fellows is a great movie. You can make a good fellow's pinball machine or the godfather. I just don't think pinball lends itself to that kind of theme. I don't. What are you going to do? You're going to like give the syringe shot. You got to you know you got to eat.

[15:50] You got to get like escape from the game. I'm just trying to think of the different things and goals for the game. I don't know. You got to clean up the car. You know and when the guy blows his head off. I don't know. It's because it's all about the dialogue in Pope fiction. Like the conversations are so awkward and weird and incredible.

[16:14] And I just think like it's just not going to translate well. And if they get the Pope fiction theme. Are they going to have John Travolta, Samuel Jackson do callouts for pinball. I don't know. Maybe they get Harvey Kitelle's probably the most affordable who would be great. But I still just think it's it's not an exciting title. I would much rather have big trouble in little China. Then Pope fiction. I would much rather have another back to the future. I would much rather have the last star.

[16:44] I would much rather have transformers the G1 movie with Unicron. I would much rather have a he-man and the castle grayschool game. I would much rather have you know any of that nostalgic stuff from like the 80s and even the 70s. You know imagine like I rather have like an old school dukes of hazards pinball machine where the ball like jumps over to the dead and you know so much more fun and colorful.

[17:11] Then Pope fiction so that's my take on it so speaking of niche music themes and do you like them or not iron maiden we all know iron maidens coming out it's like this big kept secret what people probably don't know is when iron maiden is coming out.

[17:28] Well let's see I am hearing I know I'm going to confirm I'm going to give you an exclusive on canators pinball podcast it's no mystery that this game is coming and it's the only question is when I'm just going to say like iron maiden is the next term pinball machine.

[17:46] It makes sense it's been worked on for a while it wasn't a John Trudeau game so they didn't have to go and like reduce stuff on it. It's coming out and we also know that like zombie Eddie's doing the artwork it's just it's like these secrets are not secrets and it's going to be released probably before Texas pinball festival and you're going to see it.

[18:08] I'm also hearing the rumors that this is probably going to be Keith L wins game so if you're wondering what is Keith L wins working on that is the rumor I'm hearing so I haven't seen anything I haven't seen anything I don't know for a fact that Keith is working on it I'm just these are the rumors are here but I hear pretty solid confirmation that it is the next term pinball machine.

[18:33] Now iron maiden is another one of these musical acts that I just I just for the life of me I couldn't name a single song from them and so if you love iron maiden I think you are probably going to get really excited now the other thing I'm hearing is people are really excited for this game who have seen it because

[18:51] you know L win is bringing some new flare to stern which is much needed so I again like I don't even know like guys this this cycle and we always go on this cycle that the next game is going to be incredible and it's going to blow our expectations away and it's always like yeah but the next one the next Jersey Jack machine the next

[19:12] one is going to be the one and it never materialize it's like what's the last of you actually like saw a new game and you're like holy shit you're blown away by it like blown away by like what's in the game not the artwork because the artwork isn't like the pinball stuff that's designed by stern

[19:29] and it's it's not the hardest thing to find incredible artist to put art down it it's it's really hard to make a pinball game below you with what's in the game I would say the last one that probably had that effect was pirates the Caribbean by Jersey Jack at least people are like holy shit this is really cool like you really engineered and put some thought into this game

[19:50] and I don't think we see that with most new machines that come out but we'll see we'll see so that so iron maiden is next that's the confirmation so speaking of what's next and are we going to be blown away there are pictures

[20:04] from spooky pinballs Alice Cooper's a nightmare castle that are starting to be teased out there's one that looks like like a skull like sort of with its mouth open looks like a sculpture from one of the the buildings or the castle itself and then there's another image that looks like a ball is over a switch and there's like a spider web behind it so and then there's one that looks like there's a habit trail

[20:34] and then there's like a looks like a corpse or some sort of figure like screaming like howling with this chest bursting open looks like a demon so we're getting some teasers so this game is going to be revealed at tpf

[20:51] and that's exciting you know there's not much else to go on I think that Charlie and company know that this game is going to really you know put them on the map and I hope I hope they deliver something that really blows people away from just looking at the artwork I hope they I hope they nail the art I hope they know the art because I wasn't blown away by the translate I thought it looked a little bit like a scholastic kids book cover

[21:20] and look I see the art that's coming out like on on some of the new stuff and it's like you know you got zombie Eddie got franshy you've got dirty donny I mean look at these guys are putting out there they've raised the bars so I think there's going to be no more excuses for sort of mediocre artwork so hopefully they blow it out the park but again there's there's nothing to go on I have nothing but these little images and I'm not going to speculate anymore I look forward to seeing what spooking company come out.

[21:50] I'm not giving you guys some really good information buried into this podcast so do not do not say you never hear anything on canada's pinball podcast I'm actually scooping see I know sometimes I know more than Jeff at this weekend pinball sometimes I know more than Ryan and Marty had head to head but it's cool we all sort of share information and look everyone's in a while like they know stuff I don't know I know stuff they don't know and a lot most of the stuff we know we can't share on the show.

[22:20] So that's that's always the big problem is we can't share the stuff that is the juicy stuff. All right so what else is going on in pinball so did you guys see great American pinball is making a black and white fully black and white gray scale version of the twilight zone it's it's great American pinball gap it's on their Facebook page it's super cool I was following this project years ago and they like stopped when they were doing the play field and I just never saw what happened.

[22:50] And I and now it's back I wonder if they're going to sell it what's cool about this game is they're going to make every I think every part is going to be black and white too all the all the scopes all the plastics all the toys how a pinball will how you'll be able to track a pinball machine as it rolls across a black and white play field is going to be interesting could be kind of hard but also super cool because that game is based on an on TV show that was always in black and white so it's always a little weird to see black and white.

[23:20] And white shows be colorized for pinball I think it actually I don't relate to a color version of the twilight zone on any level so excited to see if they sell that game what they asked for it.

[23:34] All right another bit of news is there is another magic rope for sale it is on eBay it is game number seven it is my friend Roberts Robert how's it going and he is asking 22,000 five

[23:50] hundred dollars for magic girl and if you're interested in a magic girl you you now have another one available I will say that's around the price I sold mine for there's also not many for sale if any other than Roberts right now and you know Robert sort of like me I think he owned it is Robert's got a collection he's got a nice collection and you know so he I think for many of us I think for many of us we

[24:19] really we're expecting to be a little bit more effort around coding the machine and getting the machine working again and I think what's happened is there's just been maybe just a realization that this game you know it just might be too tall of a mountain to climb

[24:37] and they mount an effort to climb it might not be worth it and then you've got these these guys deep root over over somewhere in Texas claiming they're going to remake it not just that they're going to remake it and charge you the price of a Kia and then they're going to remake Rosalind remake Alice and you're not remaking Rosalind you're not remaking Alice you're just making them because they were never made in the first place

[25:01] so there's a lot of uncertainty now still I'll still say this I looked at photos of magic girl the other day on my phone and it's still one of the most visually spectacular pinball machines of all time and why the other pinball manufacturers out there can't accomplish what John did is beyond me and what I mean by that is this and it's ironic that I'm saying they can't accomplish what John did you're saying what are you talking about because John made a broken machine that doesn't work that doesn't

[25:30] so far that functions properly what do you mean like eating accomplished anything what I mean is from from a purely visual standpoint magic girl still blows anything else away that has come out in pinball ever and why they still can't understand the way John approached it with hand drawing so much of the play field the plastics did everything on it just had such detail and had such color and had such vibrancy

[26:00] and then he's got these mechanisms and these areas that you know just like the balls doing weird things and going into weird places and that is why people like J-pop games and they were expecting another one of those and they didn't get it but it was just there just a different approach just different things going on in pinball and I think that's what people want they want stunning game where the ball does magical stuff

[26:27] okay and good code and good artwork you could go down the list at this and that isn't it funny how like the joke 10k by Christmas used to be a joke and now that's like the reality of the pricing of games so if you want to magic girl it's available let's do it what I let's do what I do sometimes when I'm like up late at night I go on eBay I'm typing in eBay right now and I type in pinball and I search by highest price

[26:56] because I like to see what do people really think is the most valuable stuff in the pinball industry right now and I wish you could arrange pin side by price I don't know if you can maybe you can so magic girl is the number one and it's 22,500

[27:14] number two is a rock cola army navy pinball machine from 1935 that some guys asking 21,000 for number three a stern pinball the Simpsons pinball party for 15,000 dollars okay that guy is like smoking crack he doesn't have any idea what pinballs are worth then you have someone trying to sell a pirate to the care being for 14,000 I mean these people like do they that games worth $4,000

[27:41] then there's an ACDC back in black limited edition for 14 grand that's never going to sell oh these are my favorite the cactus canians for 13,300 and 12,500 oh yeah hey everybody they just announced that cactus canians going to be remade and probably be $8,000

[27:59] so cool by buying inferior one for $6,000 more I love that there's an alien Ellie for sale for $12,500 and what else anything else interesting here you got to laugh when people are trying to sell like these beautifully hepp restored or beautifully restored attack from Mars is in monster bash is because they're getting remade and it's a hard pill to swallow

[28:24] but if you have one of those machines you're not going to get anywhere near those old prices anymore for the games it's the ship is sailed the new games are going to be far superior I'm sorry I there's just no way around it

[28:37] all right what else is going on so I'm seeing in terms of like you know people are getting their gardens the galaxy I I have no opinions about the game right now

[28:48] I it's not for me I need to play it haven't played it but again yeah you know I don't think it's setting the world on fire I think people are really liking their Star Wars pinball machines I'm glad you guys are I still think it's a theme integration mist I've said that a thousand times cool fast game it's not really Star Wars in in my book but anyway that's fine Batman's getting to where it should have been a year ago no one talks about owning arrows Smith ever

[29:17] go spusters brutal game designers a pedophile DMD what else right when you go through a quick late spotty how quickly you could just be like yeah this is what's really happened in pinball in the last like a year and a half let's see what else we got so we got we got iron made and probably coming out next we probably got Deadpool in the horizon we keep hearing about monsters beetles pulp fiction I don't know you know are you excited by those games over a Jersey Jack dot

[29:46] in so shipping and the question that on my mind is how many dialed in do you think they've sold and I'm not sure I know that Ryan hit me up and said I think he the last playfield number was in the 800 realm but it's always hard with Jersey Jack because they don't do things in numerical order so I don't know if he's sold 900 I don't know if he sold 2000 all I can do is guess but I have a

[30:15] guess but I have to guess the dialed in sales are probably not as big as Jack thought I mean you have to you have to if I'm Jack I have to think about it like this I have hired Pat Lawler the guy who has made the best selling pinball machine of all time one of the he's the best pinball designer of all time I've hired him to make his game I've given him no restrictions I've given him like four years

[30:44] four years like all this money and when his game comes out I'm gonna have it and you know and I'm and if you're Jack you gotta feel like when that happens you're gonna have one of the best selling pinball machines of the modern error that you're gonna have machine that flies out the door and what what happened is you let Pat do everything but it's a theme that nobody really wants and that is a problem and that's the sad

[31:13] part about this whole thing is you know I get Pat wanted to make dialed in but maybe you should have had Pat make back to the future maybe you should have had Pat make big trouble in

[31:27] little China maybe you should have had Pat make transform yeah I'm just listing off the titles I think would would sell like hotcakes and that's the problem it's that's the problem is they really I think made it almost

[31:40] impossible to create a game that would be a huge hit and like look I know in Jackson's like everyone says they want original themes but the reality is is they don't they don't people lie about what they really want what

[31:55] people really want are the things they already really love they want a pinball machine that's based on things that they love

[32:02] primarily the things they loved when they were younger primarily the things that make them smile and make them feel good when they think about it

[32:11] Star Wars transformers Indiana Jones big trouble in little China keep saying it like you know they want they want those sort of like goose bump feeling movies and properties to be in pinball

[32:28] when I say the words dialed in even like anything happening inside you and that's sort of like I don't know it's sort of the problem with the game it's one of the best pinball games ever but it just doesn't move people emotionally and then that is what separates a decent game or a good game from a masterpiece or a classic is exactly that and it's not just the lights and the sounds and the mix and the shots and all that

[32:57] BS it's the theme as well it's the theme as well so I think Jack is going to get pirates the Caribbean out earlier than expected and I think he has to see the rumors of them

[33:12] re-thieving dialed in to something else possibly stories toy story I mean I think we have to give those rumors some weight and I think the reason why is if you're Jack and you're ordering parts for dialed in and you expect to sell 2000 units and you only sell 1000 you can't afford to have 1000 left over of anything sitting in that factory and keep a company in business so you know what I do with these parts

[33:41] we've got this whole game design we and it's not selling should we redeem it it doesn't seem like a crazy scenario when I think about it do I want them to re-themed it to toy story absolutely not because I think every theme deserves a blank slate and the game should be designed to bring the theme to life

[34:00] and you shouldn't just re-themed stuff and I think that's also another reason why I think Stern gets it wrong when you look at Guardians of the Galaxy and it's basically like Metallica it's you know a big group okay so let's talk about like this a big group like just hovering over the game does not bring the theme of Guardians of the Galaxy to life

[34:23] and it's much like the same complaints I had with Star Wars it's kind of like Borg had his pinball layout and just dropped the Guardians of the Galaxy theme onto a pinball layout and he started with a pinball layout that he was very familiar with and that is sort of time and time again I think the problem with a lot of these modern machines is the the themes are not brought to life

[34:52] with a lot of creativity or imagination when it comes to how these games are designed and I think a lot of you feel that way and it's a shame you know just telling your friend I said look if you look like the best pinball machines of all time so the Adam's family medieval madness monster bash you know attack from Mars like the games that always rise to the top is being the best pinball machines ever

[35:17] I think it's fair to say that I mean from a from a design and mechanism and a creativity standpoint we haven't made games better than those in almost 30 years 30 years of technology innovation and the reason why it's like the same dudes making the games we need new blood and pinball we need Eric we need Scott Denise's we need Keith Owens we need new people

[35:47] that just want to do new stuff and make a name for themselves when you've been doing it for 30 years you sort of like rest on your laurels no matter what you do in this world after 30 years of doing it

[36:00] you know are the is anyone give a shit about the new rolling stones albums that have been coming out or you two albums that come out no it's because the good stuff is in the past

[36:11] but the new acts that come out that want to become famous they put everything they have into those first few albums to make it and the same is true of pinball designers don't don't ever think differently all right what else is going on this is like going in a different direction than I want to let's get to the trippy awards so this weekend pinball bomb bomb bomb this is my pick for the

[36:40] these categories now I'm going to read them I got the link open right here he's even got like trophies made up he's gonna so the show just so you guys know the award show itself is Friday January 19th which is if like what is that next Friday it's not this Friday is it no it's next Friday so next Friday at 7 p.m. our friends

[37:05] and then we'll be talking about the Zacken Greg over straight down the middle pinball are going to be the host of the first annual twippy pinball awards it's going to be live on Twitch which is fun so we can shout and heckle them in real time I will be there I'm clearing out my schedule for this and let me tell you I think I think my name is

[37:22] 23 on Twitch so if any of these imposters come out don't fall for it so I'm going to be there rooting for for being the best pinball podcast all right so here's the categories best theme best theme integration best sound call out best artwork best rules code best light show best toys gimmicks best playfield layout and gameplay best display animation shit there's a lot I maybe

[37:50] had done this earlier in the podcast favorite pinball podcast whoo favorite pinball twitch streamer favorite pinball YouTube channel favorite new mod and game of the year wow there's a lot okay so let's jump right into it so what is the best theme for pinball now if you're

[38:11] just going to say like well what's the best theme now this wasn't theme integration so I am just going to say immediately off the bat the best theme for pinball machine is star wars it just is like star wars is the biggest theme in themes of themes of themes it would it's it should have been the best pinball machine ever so right

[38:31] there I think best theme goes to star wars in terms of best theme integration right stars is the worst the integration in terms of the pinball machine that has come out and this is this year okay the stuff that's been integrated this year or the 2017 sorry in terms of theme integration I need to think about

[38:50] this okay because I'm I'm just going to say which games are probably in the consideration boats you've got alien you've got Batman you've got Star Wars you've got

[38:58] erosmith you've got dialed in dialed in really be a theme integration that's kind of weird right let's see see you can't like original themes don't really count because you can't get the integration wrong can you

[39:14] I'm an interesting question we could spend centuries debating that I think the best theme integrated pin in 2017 drum roll

[39:25] mmm hard I'm going to say huh I'm stomp pausing because I'm like I'm on the fence about two of them well look can I say can I I want to give it to the big

[39:44] Lebowski I don't know if the big Lebowski is even on here and I know it sounds great but I think the big Lebowski is the best theme integrated pinball machine in terms of bringing the world to life

[39:57] under glass of that theme and I can you consider the 2017 title I don't know my second place runner up to that in terms of theme integration

[40:07] would be Batman 66 solely solely because of where where the game is now I think the games got everything you would want it's got the actors it's got the music it's got the video clips it's got the you know it's got the artwork it's got

[40:22] everything and you don't look at that game you're like I wish there was you know more of this so I got to give it to Batman okay so best sound and call out

[40:30] that's an interesting one because you know this is one where you know if we go to like you know you got you know you got the callouts and the music is music it's

[40:48] the same thing here no so in terms of sound and callouts I mean I know alien gets praised a lot for like the music and and the callouts in that game but you don't have to go any weaver so you can never win best callouts and a pinball machine if the main character of that theme is not

[41:04] about on a pinball level I think you know I got to say best sound this is another one where I'm like I'm on the fence I I mean I want to just pick Batman for sound to because I think the batman you know

[41:22] because then you can get into sound quality but I got to give it to Batman and then I'll explain why because Batman again like it's got so much different music going on it's got the theme song it's got the callouts from

[41:33] Bert Warden Adam West and I don't think you can beat that how do you beat Batman actually talking to you about pinball how do you beat that like what else beats that I mean am I am I being too biased right now am I being too biased on Batman but I'm like okay I'm not it's not going to win everything don't worry best artwork all right I've said this from the very beginning and this is going to upset my friend Christopher

[41:55] Frenchy but I do have to say I think the best artwork of 2017 by far was erosmith and I think dirty donny if you look at that game I mean it's just gorgeous there's just detail everywhere in that game and I think he knocked it out of the park and I mean I love Batman's artwork I love you know I'm not a fan star was artwork I'm not a fan of the alien artwork I'm the dialed in artwork doesn't do anything for me

[42:25] you know so I just think that the artwork on erosmith it's just it's just so incredibly detailed and so beautiful and so colorful and look you know I mean Frenchy pulled Batman at you know out of a hat in two weeks if he had like two months to do we might have been it might have been a closer battle there

[42:47] all right so best rules and code in a game now that's an interesting one because rules and code I mean it's it's such a it's such an important part of a pinball machine and you know we hear it all the time like when when code's not done this not where where's the code and so who's got the best who's got the best rules and code

[43:07] this is another this is another tough one because you get games like Star Wars where you know some people like it I think it's a complex mess I think that you know guardian's code is was nothing I don't think you can give it to Batman because people suffered for the entire year like you you can't win an award by just showing up at the last minute so I can't give it to Batman so best rules and code I mean what's the game that people are just

[43:37] excited by the rules and code you know I'm gonna say I'm gonna give this one I know this is weird but I'm gonna say I think the best code at machine

[43:51] it's gonna be dialed in and I think dialed in you know because the game is got like a lot going on and the game is deep and you know it does have like a deep rule set it does have a lot to achieve and go for and so I think dialed in wins my award for best rules and code okay so best light show lights camera action so I have to say that the best light show

[44:20] when you when you just turn a game on is magic girl even part of this because that should win the best light show because it does have it I would say the best light show pinball is alien it's just really cool whenever I watch alien I am always I'm always say to myself like wow like it really really like looks cool like the way they do the lights no actually I'm gonna change my mind I forgot about a pin I forgot about a pin

[44:50] aliens runner up I think the best the best light show has to be total nuclear annihilation I'm sorry I totally forgot I make that light show I watched it for for like minutes on end super impressed by the light show in that game okay so best toys and gimmicks in a pinball machine

[45:07] huh well Batman you got the rotisserie thing going on Star Wars you got the tie fighter on the spring you got the hyper loop which is cool

[45:18] arosment has the toy box which is super cool so I don't know if like it's on the list because I can't see the nominees but I'm gonna say the best toys in terms of like a game that has like the coolest toys overall

[45:35] I'm gonna give it to Houdini and I and again if I look at a toy as a toy as a toy you know Houdini to me like that that one toy that fires the ball

[45:48] you know the milk can thing that fires it isn't a milk can I think I just made that up but anyway fires it like almost three feet back through the air is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in

[46:04] pinball and then you have the disappearing stage of all the magnets in the game see what the reason why I give Houdini best toys gimmicks is also because I don't think it has like any weaknesses that make me look like they just have asked it you know see see I

[46:20] think the hyper loop could be considered one of the coolest things in pinball but then you got a tie fighter on a spring and then a shitty like LCD screen to with targets in front of it like I just

[46:32] think that is crap the Batman rotating tables cool and the toy the toy box in erosmith is the other one like if I were to pick one that's like wow like that toy box that opens up is another like wow

[46:45] moment and again like think it's really cool I think the xenomorph head in alien is is like looks kind of flimsy and not really that impressed by it the funny thing is when you take away that alien head there's nothing else in that game there's nothing else there's nothing

[47:01] that there's absolutely it's the void of any other magical like mech or toy that's really cool I

[47:06] this is not christian supposed to give you like awards for the best not to start right on stuff are the best play field layout and gameplay

[47:16] now those are two different things which is interesting to layer in layout and gameplay together is interesting because you can have the best layout

[47:28] but the gameplay I don't know maybe they go hand in hand okay so what do I think is the winner here I think that there's a few that come to mind

[47:40] immediately but the winner for this here is a pinball gameplay is dialed in I think dialed in just shoots great I

[47:54] mean I love flipping that pin I again I wish it moved me more emotionally I but I think the layout is phenomenal and I think that's what pat

[48:01] Lars gets pinball I think none of the shots you have to hit or that frustrating it's not clunky it's smooth but there's a lot going on I think you know Batman's kind of clunky I think Star Wars is got is fast but you know it's got fast gameplay

[48:21] so just to know the annihilation fast gameplay but I wouldn't say like the layout on Star Wars or to know the annihilation these are like honorable mentions I just I just wouldn't say they're that like creative and I think the dial dialed in like I love like when you shoot a ramp and the ball goes where you don't expect it to go or like the magnets are unexpected places and you know it's just it's got like for a standard body game the amount of stuff that wall are put in that machine is phenomenal again such

[48:51] a shame that the other parts don't move me as much okay best display animations all right this goes to animations well who's even animating right so you you could you could throw into this like the remakes of medieval madness and attack

[49:15] from Mars you could throw into this so you got Star Wars we got Ghostbusters we've got now I don't know if Ghostbusters 2016 we got Batman kind of the best display I mean it's hard right when you think about this it's hard to think about pinball on this level like who actually animated the coolest stuff I'm going to say here if I look back and I'm looking at a pinball display I think the coolest one

[49:45] hmm I mean this one to toss up for me but I'm gonna give this one I'm gonna give this one to um to alien because I do think that when you look at the alien display and the

[50:04] graininess in it and I I don't know it feels it feels right and I think it's cool I like the way that they used the display to have like the alien

[50:14] tracker and stuff like that so I I definitely think that the runner up for me on this would be I do like the dialed in I do like how they created that city

[50:24] and like all the work that went into that is incredible they didn't just use clips they like they animated it so those two are my favorite so

[50:32] favorite pinball podcast oh who could it be that narcissistic sociopath troll he's never gonna have a

[50:46] successful pinball podcast he's a loser he sucks in life all the negative things people used to say about

[50:53] me but I'm also gonna say that I think my favorite pinball podcast is head to head pinball over there in Australia I love listening to Martin Ryan talk about

[51:06] pinball that's my favorite other than the one you're listening to right now I also like but I like you know I also like what it

[51:17] slam tilt I love those guys I love coast to coast I mean I love them all I mean I really there's there's a few

[51:25] weak ones in the bunch don't get me wrong you know there's I want to name names but there's some ones out there that I

[51:32] really can't listen to for more than like a couple minutes but you know anyone who picks up a headset and does a

[51:37] podcast about pinball is okay my book all right so favorite pinball twitch streamer I will have to give that one

[51:46] let's see you know I'm gonna give this one isn't it unlikely and Jack you're gonna get the runner up everyone

[51:53] thinks it's gonna be like Jack from dead flip and he does a great job but I'm gonna give it to the crazy

[52:02] dude waspinator on pinside because I'll tell you why he's my favorite and this is it says favorite twitch

[52:09] streamer was pin here's my favorite because he's like so honest and funny and hysterical and the only part

[52:17] about like and that's why I love it I mean it's just so like I love what he does I love what Neil McCray does

[52:23] on the twitch stream and he he does about games like he like helps you learn these games Neil awesome

[52:29] twitch stream of course Jack you are incredible I love everything you do here's the only thing that that sucks for Jack

[52:35] it's like imagine this imagine being a movie reviewer and you have to like do your live movie review sitting next to the guy who

[52:44] directed the movie like how do you do it how do you review Star Wars sitting next to Ryan Johnson and be like oh

[52:51] yeah this is great great Star Wars movie Ryan you really did a lot of great stuff with Luke that's the

[52:59] problem is Jack is like at Stern with the people who made the game and he and he's got to like be like this is

[53:07] fun and even if the game is playing like shit he's in the belly of the beast he's got that access and

[53:13] that's sometimes like why it's hard when you have too much access and you're too too friendly with the

[53:19] people who make these games because you can't be honest and give a real assessment of the game do you

[53:24] hear that like annoying clipping that was happening there oh my god like I finished the podcast it was

[53:29] like a little bit over an hour and I go back to play it and I start to hear that I'm like oh shit

[53:35] did the whole thing record like that and actually it was just like the last like five minutes so we're

[53:39] gonna we're gonna go back to where we were and I'm gonna finish off the Twippy Awards do the quick

[53:46] email read the user emails that I've got and then we're gonna call it a day all right so let's go

[53:53] from the best uh we were at twitch streamer so the my favorite pinball youtube channel I don't

[54:01] really watch much pinball on youtube I have to say I think planet earth's most boring thing you

[54:07] can do with your time is to actually watch pinball being played but I have to say I do enjoy the

[54:12] stuff uh that Neil does on youtube new McCray I know he also says the twitch stream I also enjoy

[54:19] um watching some videos but I say the best I think is is Zach and Greg uh straight down the middle

[54:27] all right so they're gonna win it I mean they have to they're also hosting the show um my favorite

[54:32] new mod of the year so in terms of like favorite new mod so what we mean by mod for you those you

[54:37] out there uh this is something that someone outside of the pinball company makes to put in the game

[54:43] and I think the best way to sort of judge a mod is by saying that should have always been in the

[54:50] game to begin with I think the best pinball mods do that they sort of they sort of bring the games

[54:56] theme to life in the way it should have come from the factory uh so that could be a topper it could

[55:02] be a new sort of like action figures that you put on the game it could be artwork in terms of

[55:07] side blades it could be a whole host of things um we've got different companies out there that do all

[55:12] those sorts of things the measle mods we've got we've got blazerific we've got the mod couple

[55:17] but I have to give my vote for favorite new mod to um a modder out there who made a bunch of mods

[55:25] for one game because I think he transformed the game with his mods and that is the mod couple

[55:33] aka yellow bird uh on pinside because their mods for batman 66 are my favorite new mods they have

[55:42] taken every element of that turntable and made it better the new bat phone is so much better the

[55:49] atomic pile so much better the new bat cave so much better uh everything that he's done to that

[55:56] is how it should have come from the factory from stern and so for that I want to say to everyone

[56:03] out there who owns a batman 66 you have to buy this guy's mods and I also want to say I'm so happy

[56:08] that yellow bird and the mod couple are out there because they now are a resource for all of us out

[56:17] there to make all these new titles even more uh special and bring the themes to life in in an

[56:23] even better way so thank you yellow or yellow bird uh all right so game of the year so this one's

[56:30] really hard really hard it's like how do you it's like saying what what's your favorite unicorn how

[56:36] do you pick the game of the year and I and I think you have to look at it like this I think game of the

[56:41] year you have to look at it as the sum of the parts of the game it's not just like the artwork it's

[56:48] not just the design it's not the music it's not the lights it's not the you know it's also goes into

[56:54] how far along was code when you got the game how enjoyable has it been owning the game how fun is

[57:01] the game now that you have it is the play field dimpling like there's so many different variables

[57:06] that we we belabor day in and day out on pinball um but I think the way I look at game of the year

[57:13] is quite frankly like this which game are people having the most fun playing which game

[57:21] hasn't disappointed people in some level on some level like like is is the game has a game in

[57:27] polarizing like to some people like like the theme integration some people hate it um which game

[57:33] is trying to do something new and be creative with pinball um which game is the result of passion

[57:40] and talent coming together and you know which game to me have I heard nothing but universal

[57:49] positive sentiment around that shows me that everyone who gets this game is loving it and for

[57:55] that my pick for game of the year is total nuclear annihilation and the reason why is is is because

[58:02] of all the things I just mentioned this game is scat deniesies passion he brought it to life

[58:09] spooky helped manufacture it and it is a game that I've heard nothing but glowing remarks from

[58:16] people that have humongous pinball collections and they are telling me how much fun they're having

[58:22] playing total nuclear annihilation the process the buy one was easy the process to to to order it

[58:30] the the game arrived with complete code the game arrived with amazing light show the game is held up

[58:38] it's not your typical game it breaks up the monotony of all these other games that seem to be cookie

[58:44] cutter recreations of everything we've seen in the past so for that I think scat should take about

[58:50] I think he did something that hopefully others will follow and there will be more young talent

[58:56] that enter into this hobby but that is my pick for game of the year I'm going to stop this and make

[59:00] sure it's not clipping and then finish the podcast all right it sounded good to me so let's

[59:06] go to user mail right now and then we'll finish this show up so all right let's see I've got an

[59:13] email let's see from David now David Falgrin and me are are gonna talk on the show and David I want

[59:25] to tell you that I'm sorry it hasn't happened yet I've been traveling for work I know I put out some

[59:30] dates but it's gonna happen real soon and I really look forward to having David come on the show

[59:35] he's a long time listener pinball fanatic so David we're gonna do it probably next week if you want

[59:41] to be a guest of the show you know how to get to me canate a pinball edgmail.com I got an email this

[59:46] is funny from this guy didn't give his name but he wrote turned off your last podcast you sound

[59:52] it like a prick constantly criticizing cutting off your own guests don't drink when you record

[59:58] these you just sound like a bully and an asshole who doesn't want to hear anything but your own

[01:00:03] shit wow did you guys feel that way after you listen to my podcast with Ted I mean I didn't think

[01:00:09] I was like rude or disrespecting Ted he's a great friend I think Ted is one of my favorite guests

[01:00:17] and I'll tell you why because I think Ted represents most of you out there you love pinball you

[01:00:22] enjoy it but it's not everything to you you can still get into other things you still have other

[01:00:28] interests you don't spend like your entire year traveling traveling around the world like seeking

[01:00:34] out new pinball I love it when people like go to like another city and there's all these things they

[01:00:39] can do in that city and they try to go find pinball machines to play that they can play anytime I

[01:00:45] don't get that I don't get it like I know Rodo Dave has his Odyssey adventures that he puts up

[01:00:51] on Pinside and you know the heart attack food and traveling to play pinball and that's cool man

[01:00:56] like it's his prerogative like people can live the life they want you know there's guys like crazy

[01:01:00] level who play all the time every day like the league player guys who play every night to the point

[01:01:05] where like I'm not even sure if they enjoy it but you know what I think balance is important

[01:01:10] and I think Ted represents the kind of right kind of balance I want to have especially as I grow

[01:01:16] older in life we're on I'm jovial and I'm surrounded by things I'm into but I'm not overly into

[01:01:22] things where I can enjoy them and I think that's why I love having Ted on the show all right let's

[01:01:28] see a couple more emails here and we'll be done I got an email from Simon now Simon said I hate

[01:01:35] saying this but why are there a ton of rob zombies for sale he says I sold mine he said code code

[01:01:42] code I don't think I think the name is fowlsma knows how to code great pinball shame as he is a nice

[01:01:50] guy if lineman had coded rob zombie these games would not be selling less than retail while Simon

[01:01:57] look I think rob zombies issues code might be one of them I haven't spent much time on the game

[01:02:04] from the very beginning from the very beginning I think rob zombies just always been a headscratcher

[01:02:08] to me because Charlie showed his other zombie game and everyone railed on the design layout and he

[01:02:14] basically just re-themed it to rob zombie with very little design changes and then sold all 300 so

[01:02:22] that that went to show the power of theme and limited production but that was like years ago it

[01:02:28] doesn't sound like that anymore right and I don't know you know rob zombies just gonna go down is like

[01:02:33] I don't know people have spoken on it those who own it those who are trying to sell it the community

[01:02:38] has given it it's opinion about rob zombie I don't think it's gonna go down as like a game worth

[01:02:43] owning in the future but that's that's not even me like that's people's opinions like people are

[01:02:49] dumping them all right I got an email from Michael Michael Fisher in Australia is going to

[01:02:54] join the show Michael owns a P3 Jerry at Multimorphic was nice enough to ask Michael to come on the show

[01:03:02] Michael we're gonna do it real soon I think we have a time tentatively scheduled for Saturday he's on

[01:03:07] Australia so the time difference as you can imagine is always really difficult but I'm really curious

[01:03:11] to see what owning a P3 is like in the in the home environment all right what else is going on I got

[01:03:17] an email from Parnell Parnell said he enjoyed the interview with Ted but he also said that Ted

[01:03:22] said he doesn't like movie based pinballs but Ted also owns a Transformers Austin Powers and

[01:03:27] scared stiff which is kind of funny because those are movie based pinball machines Ted but he's at

[01:03:34] CES and he said Stern has Batman Star Wars and Guardians there not much new stay classy well
