[00:00] Intro

[00:28] Everybody thank you for listening to the world's most negative and controversial pinball podcast

[00:34] Canada's pinball podcast. This is episode

[00:37] 245 of

[00:39] Canada's pinball podcast. I hope all of you out there had a great fourth of July kind of sucked that it was on a Wednesday

[00:45] Right, it was like just broke up the week. I always feel like it's a nighttime holiday where you want to have the next day off

[00:51] It's so silly that the world's most powerful country can't even celebrate in a way that is meaningful

[00:57] It's like one day and done anyway. I did say the world's most negative pinball podcast because I did find it funny that there are so many

[01:05] New pinball podcasts popping up left and right and what I find funny is when they articulate their reason for existing

[01:13] I love it because they like they can't even say the name of this podcast

[01:17] They always say like well, there's other pinball podcasts out there that are you know

[01:21] They tend to focus on the negativity and we want to make it about the fun stuff

[01:26] And I'm referring to the new pinball podcast which goes by the name of

[01:31] What is it special when lit pinball podcast and they're pretty much taken the same approach we are where it's they're not tournament players

[01:38] They're gonna talk about the news and the hobby and collecting pinball machines

[01:42] The only reason I called them out by name is because I just wish they would have said my name if you're gonna say that the other

[01:48] Pinball podcast that are negative just say canada's pinball podcast. I did find it funny to that in the pin-side thread

[01:56] You know the one that's the definitive list of pinball podcasts the one where they won't even say or list my name

[02:04] Somebody went in there and wrote canada's back and you know what they did the pin-side moderators

[02:09] They deleted that comment immediately so that nobody could even say that I was back on the air

[02:14] But here's the good news. There's a there is there is no

[02:18] Fallout from my hiatus. I still have the same amount of listeners

[02:22] From my last episode then when I left so this is great

[02:26] I'm happy you guys are still enjoying the show so on this episode a canada's pinball podcast

[02:30] I interviewed Jerry Stellenberg from P3 multi-morphic had a good talk with Jerry

[02:34] I'll talk a little bit about that before we air the interview

[02:37] Just a few pinball news items that I want to bring up

[02:41] Not you know look there's not a lot going on in the summertime you guys know it

[02:45] I know it we're not gonna

[02:47] Manufacture drama out of thin air, but there are a few things that I've noticed have been going on in the pinball world

[02:52] And we're gonna talk about it. So number one spooky pinball

[02:56] spooky pinball is having some

[02:59] Owners who have a rob zombie machine

[03:02] There seems like they're complaining that the code is not done and they're fear now of

[03:06] Waiting two years for the code to be completed for rob zombie is that the attention and the focus will now be put on

[03:13] Alice Cooper's nightmare castlin

[03:15] I was just reading up in the thread and

[03:17] Apparently there's been 23 software releases from

[03:21] 2016 to 2018 and there's still our bugs in the game and I think what are the modes people are complaining about is there supposed to be a mode where

[03:30] The flippers reverse that was promised to owners and that's not in the game yet

[03:35] Look, it's this isn't the first time we've seen a pinball machine be out there in the world with incomplete code after a couple of years

[03:43] I think every single diamond sheets game that has been released has gone through the same

[03:49] multi-year

[03:51] Wait to get to final code

[03:53] Will spooky and company address these issues? I would think so I don't think Charlie

[04:00] I don't think any complaints fall on deaf ears with those guys

[04:04] So I just think you have to be patient and I think it is unfortunate that a new game is coming out

[04:09] I also just you know, let's be honest here

[04:12] There is like nobody who care nobody cares about Rob zombie right now

[04:17] Other than the 300 people who own a Rob zombie pinball machine

[04:22] I mean the the excitement and the attention around that game is dead right it's just not a great game

[04:29] It's an okay game. I still think spooky would consider it to be one of their sort of like you know

[04:35] It it falls like in the middle of their evolution to go from like

[04:40] Completely like basic game like America's most honoured. I think they're they're learning as they go

[04:46] But I still think Rob zombies just gonna go down as one of the spooky games that you know, it's just an early attempt

[04:52] It's not gonna go down as a great game that people want to own. It's not gonna go up in value

[04:57] If you love Rob zombie music, that's probably the only reason to own a Rob zombie pinball machine because as a pinball experience

[05:04] It's not amazing and that's not saying anything against the game

[05:07] I mean it's it's you know, these aren't super expensive games

[05:11] So I'm also reading in the iron maiden thread people are learning they want to figure out how to change the music in the iron mating game

[05:17] Now some people want to change out iron mating completely some people want to put other iron maiden songs into

[05:24] The game itself

[05:25] We know that was it pin sound there. There's there's the

[05:30] There's the company that allows you to adjust the music in games or switch out the tracks

[05:35] I'm sure that will become available for iron maiden. I'm always I'm always curious as to how you can own a

[05:43] Pinball machine based on a band if you don't like that bands music. I just couldn't do it

[05:50] Personally and I've tried I've tried really really hard to get into iron maiden music over the past

[05:57] Six months and I have to say without a doubt

[06:00] I think iron maiden and this is just me personally this is you you can like it all you want

[06:05] I think it's some of the worst rock and roll music out there like I don't know if I had to pick between listening to like guns and roses

[06:13] Metallica ACDC Red Hot Chili Peppers you two

[06:18] You know the Beatles

[06:21] The doors I just I think iron maiden music to me it just sounds like a cat is dying like his voice my god

[06:29] It's just it's just not good. Let me run for the hills. It's just so I can't I won't even get into it anyway

[06:37] If you but if you love iron maiden God bless you

[06:40] It's nothing personal like everyone has their own taste in music

[06:43] I just never was in iron maiden music

[06:46] But you know that being said a lot of people are and I get why they've sold I'd probably like a hundred million albums

[06:53] All right, and I've sold zero album. So so take that for what it's worth all right. Let's go on to home pin

[06:58] So what's interesting in the home pin thread is and this is just in pinball in general

[07:03] There's always like that breaking point where people are tired of waiting for a game and for those of you out there

[07:10] I want to read something Mike said when he first announced

[07:14] Home pin back in

[07:16] 2013 right this is amazing when you actually go back and look at the amount of time that it has

[07:24] Elapsed in these companies when they

[07:28] Between when they announced and when they promise games and when games actually ships

[07:32] I want to read this is what Mike said back in 2013

[07:36] He says I open the website for sales at about 9 30 this morning and I must say I have been overwhelmed with a positive

[07:45] Response and the purchases made let me just stop there in

[07:49] 2013 before Mike had made anything he was selling a product he was selling

[07:56] Something to people he was taking people's money when he didn't even know how to do it yet

[08:01] So that's that's incredible. He then writes

[08:03] Thank you all for having the faith in my ability to deliver let's let's let's repeat that line

[08:09] Faith in my ability to deliver which is ironic because he goes to then say what his delivery will be

[08:15] He says I said the website would be updated on the 18th and I stuck to it

[08:21] I also want to have a prototype at next year's pin fest and I intend to do my very best to meet this time frame a

[08:29] Condition of my license is very strict in that I must meet a mid

[08:36] 2015 deadline because the licenseer has a massive campaign for the 50th anniversary of thunderbirds and

[08:45] This pinball is part of that

[08:48] Can we should we stop there and add in should we should we read that again?

[08:53] Let's read that last line and let me put in the Marty and a

[08:58] Ryan Laptrack right after I read the line hold on a second a

[09:02] Condition of my license is very strict that I must meet a mid

[09:06] 2015 deadline because the licenseer has a massive campaign for the 50th anniversary of thunderbirds and this pinball is part of that

[09:15] Okay, all right, so like look the the thing is this

[09:25] This is just the reality of all new pinball companies that don't know what they're doing that want to remake every single part want to make games in China

[09:35] Home pin has just been off the radar for most of you right

[09:39] I know that most of you don't even care about the thunderbirds license to begin with

[09:42] It's also funny to me because they were supposed to hit the 50th anniversary of

[09:48] Thunderbirds what wasn't there another company that was supposed to hit a very pivotal anniversary of a movie

[09:54] Didn't that company go by highway and alien? I love how both companies

[10:00] Completely failed to meet the

[10:02] Anniversary of the themes that they were making pinball machines around and then might just update it this yesterday

[10:09] I want to read something this is 2018 now. This is the latest he writes

[10:13] I mentioned a couple weeks ago about something delaying our cabinet production

[10:17] But I didn't want to say much until we had resolved the issue the shang zhen government is chasing all factories

[10:25] Out of the city as they want the city to become an IT hub

[10:29] We were stopped from cutting any cabinet wood and painting was 100% out of the question

[10:35] We least an additional premises that is only three kilometers door to door from our original factory, but it is an enaboring

[10:44] Don gawan where the there's not so much restrictions on factories in the end

[10:49] We really need it more space anyway, so the second factory is now the home pin cabinet shop

[10:55] We will cut and paint all cabinets in the new place and move them across to the original factory for fitting and finishing

[11:02] We have yet to move the CNC and other wood cutting machinery as we have plenty of parts to get on with the moment

[11:08] We'll move the other machine in a week or so. All right

[11:12] Let's just stop there for a bit it so Mike is in China

[11:17] Where all of a sudden the government has now determined that he can't cut wood or paint wood in one of his factory

[11:23] So he has to go into another

[11:25] Neighborhood to do that

[11:27] Can we just stop for a moment and say

[11:31] Wow sounds like building pinball machines in China was a great move. I mean what a joke

[11:38] What a joke? How do you read this stuff as buyers and say you know what I'm staying in on this

[11:45] I feel good about this. It's just such a joke

[11:49] These companies, I mean I can't even with the the promises that we will definitely ship by 2015

[11:57] That the fact that now like we have to start another factory to just do the cabinets in

[12:03] You know another pinball company that kept having to get new factories was also highway pinball

[12:08] You know, maybe Andrew highway should join Mike and they should just together together we can make the biggest

[12:16] Laughing stock pinball company of all time like they should really combine forces like you could have Mike

[12:22] He could go off on like all of his tirades and it is is like racist rants

[12:26] And you could have Andrew promising 600 games a month and you could combine efforts

[12:30] Why don't they just make it the new pinball game from highway and home pin

[12:35] It is the new game you'd never wanted. It's called alien pinball meets thunderbirds

[12:41] Arriving sometime soon in 2039. I love it. Let's just make it happen. All right, whatever look if you got no one is really in on thunderbirds

[12:49] Let's be honest

[12:51] Nobody only probably the diehard Aussies are right on this game the fact that this game just looks so dated

[12:59] I mean the orange DMD's whatever it's up to you

[13:02] I'm not even gonna go on about the game

[13:04] But I just think it's funny that that's happening to that game. It's like karma is biting them in the butt right now

[13:09] All right, let's see what else is going on in the world of pinball

[13:12] So Jersey Jack pinball and pirates production so this always happens too is whenever there's a delay

[13:20] Or you're waiting to hear when your game is gonna go into production

[13:24] People get bored, you know, it's sort of like pinside is sort of like people

[13:29] Who are waiting for something to open up?

[13:31] You know when you're like waiting for a store to open and you're kind of just like walking around the mall for 15 minutes

[13:37] With your hands in your pocket just wondering when they're gonna lift the gate

[13:40] That's what it feels like and you know when like you're outside the store

[13:44] And it's supposed to open at like 10 o'clock

[13:46] And it's like 10 o' 3 and you can see the employees in there

[13:49] But the gate still down and you're like looking in like hey man. What's up?

[13:53] It's like three minutes past like open this thing up

[13:56] That's what's happening in the Jersey Jack pinball thread right now the guys are walking around being like hey man

[14:01] It's July you said this thing was gonna be in production by now like what's up?

[14:06] And the reality is nobody really knows the last we heard is

[14:11] They're waiting for parts um and look I've said it before

[14:16] Excitement for this game is just

[14:19] Waning it it someone said this great word that it's just slogging along

[14:24] Um, you know the problem the problem is

[14:28] For Jack is this and this is something that I also just thought a lot about on my break

[14:33] But you guys have to admit that all pinball purchases are an impulse buy and by that

[14:39] I mean you don't need it you it won't

[14:43] It's unnecessary. It's a toy. It's an impulse like

[14:47] Almost every toy we buy is an impulse buy like you don't need an expensive watch it's usually impulsive

[14:52] Normally when you buy stuff that's an impulsive toy you also want to you know

[14:56] Make sure that it will have some resale value because you know you also will get bored of it

[15:00] That's the other part of of people who collect things is I also know the other side of the coin is

[15:06] boredom easily comes after the excitement of getting something and then they want the next thing to fill the boredom so

[15:12] The thing is an impulse buy requires

[15:16] That you grab people's money when their impulses are the strongest and you remember when we saw this game for the first time at

[15:23] Expo I think everybody remembers it you could go back and listen to my podcast

[15:27] When we first saw pirates of the Caribbean how excited we all were remember people were putting up

[15:32] Pinside threads. It's a dark day for Stern like even I was like it's over for Stern

[15:38] And we all were so ready to own the pirates of the Caribbean

[15:42] How do you feel now? Be honest? How do you feel now? Like I feel like people could care less

[15:48] About owning the game right now. There is like no excitement because we feel like we've seen it forever

[15:55] It's isn't it weird to like it almost feels like a game's already been out

[15:58] Because you've been watching videos of it for nine months

[16:02] And and I think that's the problem and also

[16:06] From a marketing standpoint the last month you want to try and sell your pinball machine in is August

[16:13] I mean august is a terrible month to sell someone in impulse buy unnecessary item people are going on vacation

[16:22] People are out and about more they're traveling. They're spending money in other areas

[16:26] It is the reason why you will never see a big launch of anything in august like the reason why

[16:31] Movie big movies don't come out in august new products don't launch in august

[16:35] It is a dead sales month. So it's unfortunate

[16:39] But when the distributors start calling of people to actually go in on these nine ten and twelve thousand dollar games

[16:46] in august or september

[16:49] I think people are gonna wait and and my whole thing is this

[16:53] Because we've waited a year now to get pirates of the carabin and we already know

[16:59] That monsters is right around the corner that deadpools right around the corner that beetles is right around the corner

[17:05] That um see just sees new game is right around the corner and you know that unless you buy

[17:11] Unless you really really really want to collectors edition of pirates of the carabin

[17:17] Tell me why you'd want to own this game now

[17:20] Like really email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[17:24] Why would you want to buy pirates of the carabin at launch the code won't be complete

[17:30] Um a lot of new games are coming out that you might want to spend your money on and I also think jack is gonna show

[17:38] Willy Wonka

[17:39] Probably by tps

[17:41] So I would just wait and the reason why I would just wait

[17:44] Is unless you want the collector's edition

[17:47] They're gonna make pirates of the carabin limited edition

[17:51] Forever like you could buy it when it's done

[17:54] And we also know if you watch the sales the resale of was and of hobbit

[18:01] You'll be able to get a limited edition

[18:04] Pirates the carabin game for a couple thousand dollars less than it is new

[18:10] If you just wait and so I don't know part of me is just like

[18:14] The smart man now just waits

[18:18] He waits to the game is done and he plays it complete and knows he loves it

[18:22] Um this silly pinball collector he runs after everything new has to have it

[18:28] buys it then you know usually is left with like an incomplete game or or you know

[18:33] Sometimes that you you get a game and you you love it you know you don't know

[18:37] I mean look and for some of you guys like the guys out there who have

[18:41] Six seven figure balances, you know in your accounts maybe eight even

[18:46] It doesn't matter to you. I get it. I get it some of you guys are taking home paychecks and taking you know every month

[18:53] You see checks for tens of thousands of dollars some of you may be even like a hundred so thousands of dollars

[18:59] It means nothing all right and those people god bless you. I hope to get there one day. All right. I really do

[19:07] But you know, I just think it's smart to wait

[19:10] You know, I was laughing because I was reading

[19:12] Um iceman keeps sort of throwing me out there is like this idiot guy who will just buy anything expensive like

[19:18] I'm gonna go buy the big Lebowski for twenty one thousand dollars like let me let me just save for some

[19:22] You know look I bought magic girl for twenty three thousand dollars. I sold it for twenty

[19:27] I feel lucky to get out at twenty when I bought magic girl. I thought it worked

[19:32] Anyone now who buys a twenty one thousand dollar big Lebowski

[19:37] Game is

[19:38] Is problematic anyone who buys an alien Ellie right now and more alien than Lebowski alien pitball machine is a piece of shit

[19:49] It will break. It's terrible every owner who has it is having nothing but tons of problems

[19:56] So ice I'm happy you bought one. I think it's the dumbest game to buy. I don't you know, I I don't know you

[20:02] You always go in on everything

[20:04] I don't know maybe play your games you own more and just learn to enjoy them

[20:11] Uh, but pardon me feels like some of these guys on Pinside

[20:14] It's like they they only it's like they almost need to create their own ration now for why they can they should be on that site

[20:21] Every day hyper posting because they're always in the market for a new game and they always have to be acting within the hobby

[20:28] And I just think it's stupid

[20:30] I mean we all know that ice has has has enough games now

[20:33] To satiate his pinball itch

[20:36] But we all know that it goes deeper and it's more about like cloud on the fucking stupid site that these guys are chasing

[20:44] But here's the thing

[20:46] You're just chasing your tail guys because ultimately nobody out in the real world

[20:51] Things it's cool that you're you're you're some like known guy on a pinball form like it. It's absolutely

[20:57] The most meaningless existence to have anyway, but look

[21:01] I hope your alien Ellie arrives in one piece because coming from Australia

[21:05] That game is going to be thrown around like a rag doll

[21:08] So let's see what happens there anyway

[21:11] Is there anything else going on in the pinball world?

[21:14] Not really not really so let me air this interview with Jerry

[21:17] It was a good talk you know, I think that the climate in which Jerry is releasing his game is a difficult one

[21:23] He knows that we'll talk about that on this interview

[21:27] Look, I think that p3 multi-morphic definitely as people talk about pinball innovation

[21:33] It's probably the biggest leap forward in envisioning what a pinball machine can be

[21:39] Um people have seen it for many many years, you know, and and I've said it before like it is hard to keep the hype going when you've been around for a really really long time

[21:48] Um and ultimately when you listen to Jerry talk about p3 you know

[21:53] He doesn't see it as a pinball machine like a pirate like it's a platform

[21:58] But you know the platform is only as good as the games that are on it

[22:01] And so you know, I would like to see newer games come on to the p3 platform that actually like show me everything it can do

[22:10] You know and if I were to give Jerry some advice

[22:12] I you know, I think there's areas too that aren't even part of the tech

[22:16] That um could be improved upon you know stuff like the artwork on the cabinet

[22:21] You know sturnas raise the bar on the artist they're using for their machines

[22:24] And you know art is not as expensive as people think and I think there's an ability to make you know

[22:31] every part of the of the p3 multi-morphic cabinet um

[22:35] You know look as good if not better than what else is on the market because that's that's the thing and that's the big hurdle

[22:42] For Jerry's when you're charging $10,000 regardless of it of it if it's a platform or if it's a game

[22:48] It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money and people are gonna naturally cross shop you with what else is out there for $10,000

[22:55] And so you have to stand back and say visually

[22:57] Does my product look as good as these other products are asking $10,000 and can I improve it?

[23:02] And I think you can and then you know all the artwork on on multi-morphic is

[23:05] Replaceable it it pills on and it gets put on you know pills off and on so um they can do that

[23:12] What I do respect about Jerry a few things is this shows not always friendly about p3

[23:19] And and Jerry is is a good guy and he hits me up and he wants to come on and talk about it and we do that and

[23:25] And I respect the fact that Jerry

[23:28] He took money from people he took pre-orders and he delivered a game to everybody who paid in full

[23:34] Now look this podcast can get really stride in and we can get really like uh, you know

[23:40] opinionated on titles

[23:42] But ultimately if you look at where I really go off the handle and what what really irks me

[23:49] Is simply people taking money for something and then not delivering the product

[23:55] If people play p3 multi-morphic at shows and they want to buy one and they give Jerry their money and they get their game

[24:02] What what is there to complain about if those people are happy with their game and Jerry delivered on what he promised

[24:09] That is how the world should work okay. Yes. We can have discussions and talk about whether or not we like the games or not

[24:16] But ultimately

[24:17] Everyone who buys a pinball game should get their pinball game and this hobby

[24:23] Has been

[24:24] Inundated and infiltrated by many many companies have that have done the complete opposite

[24:30] So I think you have to give Jerry credit for that and he's building this thing slowly

[24:35] And he's doing what spooky did which is the only way to launch your pinball company which is you need to bite off as much as you can chew

[24:43] So let me air the interview because we talk a lot about it

[24:46] um

[24:47] Everyone I want to thank you all for coming back to the show. It is exciting to see that we still have as many listeners as we did before

[24:55] The other pinball podcasts that are out there. Let me tell you guys something do your thing

[24:59] Just do your thing, but if you want to call me out call me out. It's cool. We're all adults

[25:05] There is infinite amount of room in the airwaves for a thousand pinball podcasts

[25:10] You guys are you canada's canada. We love what we do here

[25:15] You know do it do it you guys want to do my only advice. I'm not gonna give you franche chips

[25:20] franche chips

[25:22] Christopher franche potato chips um franche chips

[25:25] It's just get right to it. Everyone always starts talking about their weekend and how they first fell in the

[25:31] Love with like an earth shaker game at the mall and they were a kid

[25:35] News flash nobody gives a shit get right to the pinball news and then right to your point of pinball because

[25:44] When you tune into a pinball podcast

[25:46] You already are like the point oh oh oh one percent of people that are into pinball

[25:52] So you don't have to give us background on anything just get right to it have a good day everyone here's Jerry from p3

[25:58] All right ladies and gentlemen

[26:00] I want to welcome back to canada's pinball podcast Jerry Stelanberg of p3

[26:06] Multi-morphic and Jerry I want to apologize for the delay because we were supposed to do this like six weeks ago

[26:12] But we're finally doing it you're my first guest back after my

[26:16] Hiatus so welcome to the show

[26:18] Thanks Chris have be to be here always for the chat

[26:20] Yeah, yeah, and you know, I'm really I'm really looking forward to this chat because it's been a while

[26:25] And I know that a lot has happened in your world since we last spoke because I think we probably spoke

[26:31] You know jeesh like maybe four or five months ago

[26:34] So tell me just what's been going on in the p3 multi-morphic world since we last spoke

[26:40] Yeah, gosh, I think it was a lot longer than that it was probably a year ago because we didn't chat months before tpf

[26:46] Yeah, so

[26:47] Let's take it back like

[26:49] You were at tpf and I know that I think it was around 60 days ago

[26:54] I saw the communication from multi-morphic about the pinball evolution and you guys finally sort of reach that point where games

[27:02] We're going out to consumers. So let's start there because I think people know the story

[27:06] What did it feel like to finally have production games in box going out to people?

[27:11] I'm supposed to probably say it's super exciting and you know

[27:15] The culmination of tons of work and the reality is that shipping games to consumers is probably the scariest thing

[27:22] I've ever had to do in my business career because

[27:26] That's the point where it gets real and you've built this thing you put your

[27:31] Passion into it for years and you've spent all this time and money and gotten all these people to help you

[27:37] You've made promises to tons of people you've you've put this thing together this brand new thing that no one's ever seen before

[27:44] And

[27:45] If they get it and it doesn't work or it falls apart or they have issues with it then it's terrible

[27:50] Right, right so it's super exciting

[27:52] Of course to to get the game out to ship these machines to fulfill promises to make our

[27:59] Start making our place in this industry, but at the same time it's super scary because you wanted to work

[28:04] And you dread every email you get from a customer. You're hoping it's hey, I love this game

[28:07] But it might be I love the game, but only when it works because three screws fell off yesterday

[28:12] Right and and in terms of the sort of the amount of years you were

[28:17] Putting into into p3

[28:19] How many was it from beginning to game going in box was it like seven or eight or am I just me that up?

[28:26] You're totally making that up

[28:27] We founded the company in 2012

[28:30] Prior to that we were basically just doing the p-rock stuff is pinball controllers.com

[28:36] You know shipping p-rock 36 I wasn't that far off. Okay, so it's it's six

[28:41] But then we found the company we announced Lexi light speed in the p3 and started taking pre-orders in tpf 2013

[28:48] And we shipped a game in

[28:51] September or no it was September or October of 2016

[28:56] So it took about three and a half years to ship a game

[28:59] Okay, so game number one went to customer in 2016

[29:03] I'm sorry. No, that was 2017. Okay, so four and a half years. It was yeah, basically seven eight nine months ago

[29:09] And and and I think we've always said it you know Jerry like you you

[29:13] sort of you took a few pre-orders

[29:15] But you weren't like selling people these games for full price like a lot of the other boutiques that popped up

[29:21] You know over the years so

[29:23] Remind us again like how it worked in terms of getting your name on the list or pre-ordering one of these machines

[29:29] Okay, no we did actually take fully paid pre-orders at least for a little while

[29:33] So our deal going back to the beginning was that we were building this you know this revolutionary new

[29:38] Concept this platform machine with modularity and ball tracking and super cool features

[29:44] We wanted we hope that we would convince some big investors to help us out and fund the company and you know

[29:50] Give us the ability to to live out these dreams making making this you know a full-time job and things we could

[29:56] We could sustain our our lives and our families and things with um

[30:00] So what we did early on after we announced the project

[30:03] Was that we brought Dennis Nordman on board to design lexelite speed and then we started pre-ordering

[30:08] And we got we got a good number of people to do fully paid pre-orders way back when

[30:14] But our goal wasn't to take that money and spend it

[30:18] Because to me that's to me that's on ethical. It's it's not my money to spend

[30:22] It's money that customers have spent on machines

[30:25] My goal was to take that money and leverage it to investors and say hey listen

[30:29] We've got x number of people that have paid and full for this machine

[30:32] So the risk of investing in us is a lot lower than it could be if we didn't have any you know

[30:38] Any customers right it didn't work out that way we never really actually convinced any big name investors

[30:43] We've kind of had to bootstrap this and work for free and do all the things that a startup has to do to survive

[30:49] Right we've done that on our own but early in the beginning we took fully paid pre-orders

[30:53] But I was just actually thinking about this a couple days ago

[30:57] The p3 pre-orders the guys who paid it full

[31:00] In this land this pinball land of fully paid pre-orders and and the drama that it's been over the years

[31:06] The p3 p-... pre-orders they hit the jackpot because we offered

[31:11] We offered a lot of incentives to get them on board. We offered

[31:14] Early on to all of our early paid, fully paid pre-orders. They've spent $9,000 to get a p3

[31:20] The p3 came with the five game package. We've talked about before Lexi lightspeed

[31:25] Secret agent showdown escape from earth cannon lagoon rocks in barnyard

[31:29] They got a promise for cosmic heart racing when it ships and

[31:33] And the kicker is that they got $50 of credit to our store for every month after they

[31:40] pre-ordered until we started buying parts for their games.

[31:43] So a lot of them got essentially $3.5 or $4 years of $50 coupons every month.

[31:49] Do you ever regret giving that a bad incentive?

[31:54] Kind of, but not really because the white structure is they get a discount.

[31:58] They get a 50% discount for $100 worth of merchandise.

[32:05] So essentially, to take advantage of their discount, they have to spend money with us.

[32:10] So it's kind of a wash at that point.

[32:12] It's money we're not going to make from those people, but we're happy that they signed

[32:16] up early and we're happy to get them more products and more games and more things and

[32:21] not make a lot of money on them.

[32:22] We hope to grow the business and bring on a lot more customers to help us fund the

[32:26] future.

[32:27] I definitely want to talk about the game and the feedback you've been getting from

[32:31] the early adopters.

[32:32] But you brought up something interesting about the pre-order model and taking money because

[32:36] I think everyone has witnessed over the last couple of years, even the last year, the

[32:41] stories of Dutch, of highway pinball, of John Papadu paying himself a salary.

[32:48] What was it like when you were trying to get investors and walked me through the process

[32:55] of how do you continue to go to shows, continue to develop the platform, travel, you've got

[33:02] employees, a lot of the, I'm sure people are volunteering time because they believe

[33:07] in the vision and in the dream.

[33:09] But how hard was it?

[33:11] If you could go back, would you do it the same way or is there anything like you've learned

[33:16] now that you're like, oh my God, I can't believe we did it that way.

[33:20] The whole hindsight is 2020 and regret thing.

[33:23] I live by a philosophy that we make the best decisions we can at the time.

[33:29] We have all the information we need at the time to make a decision and it's the right decision

[33:32] then.

[33:33] So looking backwards and saying, I don't know what I've done it again, it doesn't matter

[33:37] because at the time it was the right thing to do.

[33:40] It was a struggle in the sense that all startups, bootstrap startups are a struggle.

[33:46] I didn't do it totally on my own.

[33:48] I had some help from friends and family.

[33:50] And then of course, we kind of built the company on the backs of the community and people

[33:56] that were excited about our vision and our side about the product.

[33:58] Most of our software developers are people who helped us with art, people who helped

[34:02] us with game design.

[34:03] They were people who believed in the product David Thiel signed on early because he loved

[34:07] the potential of the platform he wanted to be involved.

[34:11] We had Dennis Norben in early working on early game designs.

[34:13] We had a lot of people volunteering.

[34:16] We still have people volunteering.

[34:17] I still haven't made a salary in five, six years because we're not to the point yet where

[34:23] we're selling a thousand games a year and can afford to take that profit and feed it

[34:28] back into the company and pay people.

[34:30] But the process for startups is, I'm sure it's different for everyone.

[34:36] A lot of people can build a startup because they know a friend with a lot of money or

[34:40] somebody's done really well to previous business and can afford to bootstrap a company for whatever

[34:45] it takes, a million dollars, two million dollars, which is what these things really need.

[34:50] We had a little bit of help from friends and family.

[34:52] They got us started, but it's been a struggle the whole way through.

[34:55] We would not have survived without people working for free.

[35:00] When I say free, I don't mean no incentives.

[35:02] These are people that agreed to share the risk in order to share the reward if we ever

[35:07] can afford to pay every reward.

[35:09] That's through stock options and things like that.

[35:12] So how has it been when you say friends and family, what's it been like at the Stummanburg

[35:17] Thanksgiving table?

[35:18] Have people been like, Jerry, come on.

[35:20] When are we going to see some return on this?

[35:23] Has everyone been still very supportive knowing that it took years to finally get games out

[35:29] and get money coming in the door?

[35:32] Obviously everyone wants to see a return of their money and they're afraid if they don't

[35:36] have their foot in the development cycle.

[35:40] If they're not day-to-day active in the company, they don't really know what's going on.

[35:43] But I've always been pretty good about being honest.

[35:47] It's who I am.

[35:48] It's what I do.

[35:49] I'm an engineer.

[35:50] I like to tell it how it is.

[35:52] If things are going great, I'll tell them it's going great.

[35:54] If things are going poorly, I'll explain why and what we're trying to do about it.

[36:00] Every year we showed progress.

[36:03] Every year we took new machines or new prototypes or started showing off new games.

[36:07] Yeah, I'm sure my aunt and uncle who were the first investors in the company, they've

[36:12] been a little bit scared probably.

[36:15] But the same deal started at the beginning.

[36:18] I was honest at the beginning.

[36:19] I'm not taking anyone's money who can't afford to put money into it.

[36:22] Just assume that this money is gone.

[36:26] If we can pay back a nice return at the end of the day, then we're all super happy.

[36:30] If you can't afford to put money into this company, if it's going to hurt you at the end

[36:34] of the day, then I won't accept it.

[36:36] I won't take it.

[36:37] Right.

[36:38] So is everyone who prepaid and full, have they all got a P3 yet or is there still a list

[36:45] are they still in the second wave or third wave of games being built?

[36:49] Where are you guys at in terms of fulfilling those orders?

[36:52] We, geez, it's been three or four months since we filled the last paid pre-order.

[36:58] And now we are.

[37:00] So what happened was in the early days we took paid pre-orders about a year ago, a year

[37:05] ago TPS.

[37:06] It was March, which is a year and a few months, 2017.

[37:10] We stopped taking, well, we stopped taking pre-orders long time before that.

[37:13] But in March of 2017, we put out a deal that says we're now taking partially paid pre-orders.

[37:25] You can put in a reservation for a game and you can decide if you want to buy a Lexi

[37:31] light speed and get the five game package or you can decide to just get Lexi as the only

[37:36] game and wait for CCR that was our incentive.

[37:39] And we have a bunch of people sign up for that.

[37:40] We're literally one week away from finishing the last order from that.

[37:44] So one week from now by the end of next week, we'll have fully shipped every period or

[37:49] P3.

[37:50] Which in this hobby, you need to take it about for that because there, well, we see what's

[37:56] been going on with some other companies.

[37:57] There are a lot of people out there who paid for games they will never get.

[38:02] So it's good to hear that everyone who's paid is going to have the game arrive and in

[38:07] their home very, very soon.

[38:09] So Jerry, I'm curious, and you talked a little bit about it earlier on, how anxious and

[38:15] nervous is it to put that first game in the box?

[38:17] Like what kind of quality testing are you doing on these early games?

[38:22] You know, we've heard stories from American Pimball where Joe Balls was playing every game

[38:25] 40 times.

[38:26] Like what was it like going through the quality control before you felt comfortable

[38:31] letting these things out of your sight?

[38:33] Yeah, and it's still a process, but we started out our first game.

[38:37] We sold to a friend.

[38:40] He was a guy in Austin who's been a supporter of us.

[38:43] He'd come to my house every time we had a pinball party even before we started the company.

[38:47] He was a good friend of mine and became a good friend of the company.

[38:52] So we had a chance, essentially, to ship our first game under the conditions that if

[38:57] it's too early and if there are things that are broken, he's right down the street and

[39:01] we drive there and fix it.

[39:02] And we had one or two issues that we had to deal with for him and we did that.

[39:06] But it's more of a, it's more of a, you know, a tense situation when you put a new

[39:12] inbox and when you put a machine in a box and ship it across the country or across the

[39:16] world to someone who you know you can't literally drive out to their house to help.

[39:21] Some of our first games went to Europe, went to Australia, went to New Zealand, a couple

[39:26] went to Canada and that's nerve-wracking every time.

[39:30] But what's really strange and I don't know if this is just luck or the draw or what or

[39:36] some kind of a, well, I don't know.

[39:38] But every machine we've shipped overseas has arrived in completely perfect open-the-box

[39:43] and play at condition.

[39:45] We've had issues, we've had to work through with some domestic people.

[39:50] I'd say about 50% of the games we've shipped so far in total, 50% have worked perfectly,

[39:56] nothing wrong out of the box, maybe 30 or 40% had minor issues, loose screws, loose cables,

[40:01] little things like that.

[40:03] And five or 10% just took super rough, heavy shipping and had some pretty major problems

[40:08] that we had to deal with.

[40:09] But you know, it's a process.

[40:12] Every time a customer calls with an issue, whether it's a loose screw or something more

[40:16] significant, we figure out what it is.

[40:20] We help them.

[40:21] We're on the phone with them as often as they need to to get it fixed.

[40:23] We send them technical documents to show them how to do it.

[40:26] We make videos to show them how we would do it.

[40:28] We have machines in the shop that we literally, you know, we recreate the issue or we put

[40:33] a part in a machine in the shop incorrectly so we can show them what their machine looks

[40:37] like and then we can work through the fix.

[40:40] And then we feed that back into manufacturing.

[40:42] And you know, we're never going to be perfect and we're always going to have real people

[40:45] working on these things.

[40:46] So they're always going to make mistakes.

[40:48] But our QA checklist now is super long.

[40:53] And that's also a bad thing because if you're checking 100 things at the end of the day,

[40:58] then there's 100 things that you need to improve your assembly on.

[41:03] But it's a huge process.

[41:05] I mean, you know how many parts are in these machines.

[41:07] You know how many opportunities there are for mistakes.

[41:09] If you take a thousand parts and you screw up any one of them, the customer is going

[41:13] to have an issue.

[41:15] So you can do 990 things correctly and 10 things wrong and the customer is going to hate

[41:19] it because it's not going to work right.

[41:21] So, and pinball is tough.

[41:23] Yeah.

[41:24] And when I always tell people about pinball, the unique thing about it is if just one switch

[41:28] fails, you don't want to play.

[41:32] You've got thousands of parts and one thing goes down and then your fun factor goes to

[41:36] zero.

[41:37] So it's difficult.

[41:38] Well, there's no such thing as perfect pinball.

[41:40] I think, you know, from the community standpoint, as people just want to feel like there's

[41:45] someone on the other end of the phone that will help them out.

[41:48] And I've been following the thread and you've been in there and helping people out.

[41:51] And I think, you know, right now it's a small owner base that is all sort of helping each

[41:57] other, sort of talking about certain things and it seems like everyone is getting the help

[42:03] they need.

[42:04] So are there any major changes that you've experienced from the early adopters, Jerry, or is there

[42:09] just sort of small tweaks here and there that you're sort of implementing on games going

[42:12] forward?

[42:13] Yeah, definitely no major changes.

[42:15] But yeah, we have had 20 or 30 tweaks to things.

[42:18] We've made things go together easier for the assembly process.

[42:21] We've always tried, also tried to address things that customers, it's too hard for a customer

[42:28] to tweak something or it's too hard for a customer to adjust the way something works.

[42:33] So we've changed some things.

[42:35] We're looking into some more major changes.

[42:37] For example, one big example is that our WallSkoop assembly is this, you know, the super cool

[42:44] feature of the machine that allows us to do a lot of cool things, but we have to individually

[42:48] level 12 raising features, just like you would level a drop target on a traditional game.

[42:56] There's usually a set screw or something or a, you know, a leveling screw that you tweak

[43:00] until you get the thing at the right height.

[43:02] We've got 12 things, six wall targets and six scoops behind them that have to be level

[43:06] with each other.

[43:07] They have to be level with the play field in front of it and they have to be level with

[43:10] the module or play field behind them.

[43:13] Tweaking those things is a super pain in the butt.

[43:16] It takes us way too much time and manufacturing.

[43:19] And then if the screws or the nuts that hold the screws in place aren't tight, then doing

[43:23] shipping, they'll readjust and they'll get to a customer's place and they'll be out of

[43:27] level again.

[43:28] So we have assembly instructions and we have technical documents to instruct people how

[43:33] to tweak those levels, but it would be super great in the future as if we switched from

[43:36] coils to something like a servo and then we can run through a software algorithm to

[43:40] calibrate those and to get them level and all that stuff.

[43:42] So there's ways of improving things moving forward, but the reality is we're still bust

[43:49] in our butts in manufacturing, getting machines out to customers.

[43:55] And we're a small team.

[43:57] We have two mechanical guys full time and one mechanical guy who helps us part time.

[44:02] We have just a couple of software guys.

[44:04] We have just a couple of audio and video guys.

[44:08] And if the mechanical team is in manufacturing, fixing issues or helping manufacturing get

[44:13] going or working on process, then they're not developing these new and improved assemblies.

[44:18] So it's an interesting trade off.

[44:21] We would love to have a million dollars that we can pull out of the bank and pay people

[44:25] and hire people and build a big team and grow fast, but that's not the way we're doing

[44:30] the business.

[44:31] We're growing slowly.

[44:32] Organically, we're bringing in money from hopefully more and more sales so we can grow.

[44:38] Right.

[44:39] So Jerry, on a weekly basis, so right now, is manufacturing happening on a daily basis

[44:46] or is it, are you guys doing it in batches as orders come in and you order parts for

[44:52] a certain number of batch of games to go out?

[44:55] So both of those things, we are working with a contract manufacturer to build the machines

[45:00] for us.

[45:01] And what that really means today is that we're paying to sit in somebody else's building

[45:07] and help their people make our games.

[45:10] In the long term, we want to just be able to send the contract manufacturer an order for

[45:14] whatever it is, 20 or 30 or 50 games a month and say, hey, we got orders or we want to

[45:19] inventory these machines, build them and let's move forward.

[45:22] But the reality is today, the machines don't get built properly and they don't work at

[45:28] the end of the day unless we're sitting there helping the people fix problems, helping

[45:32] the people fix parts, testing the parts, finding whatever deficiencies are in the assembly

[45:37] instructions or the testing process.

[45:39] So we, I don't know if you know Les Pitt, he's been working with me for years.

[45:43] He's the tall guy that goes to all the shows with us and he's literally living, not living,

[45:48] not literally living, but he's in the manufacturing site five days a week, 10 or 12 hours a day,

[45:55] working with the assemblers.

[45:56] TJ, our mechanical engineer is sitting there in the manufacturing site three days a week

[46:02] going over whatever issues they have so he can tweak the part designs or tweak the testing

[46:07] procedures or do whatever.

[46:09] And I'm there three days a week as well, three and a half days a week working at the logistics

[46:14] of shipping machines, working with the freight companies, dealing with the management of all

[46:18] these people and making sure everyone's working well together and figuring out how to slice

[46:21] up their time between the projects that they have to do.

[46:24] We have parts that come in from our suppliers and I would say 30% of those parts aren't

[46:30] right.

[46:31] So we either throw them away or get the vendor to spend three months making new ones or

[46:35] we fix them and make them work.

[46:37] So a lot of the stuff that Les does every day is fixing parts, whether it's making holes

[46:43] bigger or making the bends 90 degrees instead of 87 degrees or whatever it is.

[46:48] It's a, it's a crazy thing.

[46:50] There's tons and tons of work to do every day.

[46:52] And I mean, I've heard this story, not just from you Jerry, but from other people I know

[46:57] in the industry, that manufacturing, Dimbal is a nightmare to get it all right and to

[47:04] get everything going, which is why when the machine actually is playable in your home,

[47:10] it is a small miracle.

[47:12] It is a small miracle that it arrives and everything is working.

[47:16] Let me ask you a question because I was on Multimorphic tonight and I was reading the

[47:20] site and I was following the page.

[47:23] I scrolled down and I bought into the whole evolution and it said, buy now.

[47:30] And I clicked and it said out of stock.

[47:32] So I couldn't even buy it.

[47:35] So what talked to me about someone who is in the market for one two day, they see the

[47:41] out of stock.

[47:43] Where are they on a, like how far down a list are they?

[47:47] If I were to order today, when do you think I would get a game?

[47:51] Order game today, I'll ship in four or five weeks.

[47:54] So like I said, we're one week away from finishing our last, what I call paid pre-order, which

[48:00] is the orders we took about a year ago for the people who got the promotion to buy early.

[48:07] Now there are in the last few months, we've gotten a bunch of orders from TPS, people

[48:11] who just put deposits down, basically people who clicked on that link and said they want

[48:15] to put a thousand dollars deposit down and get a game.

[48:17] So we have two to three weeks worth of those customers to fill orders from and then after

[48:20] that, we're building to ship immediately and we're hoping to build up a whole bunch

[48:26] of games and ship them to distributors and also fill orders immediately on the website.

[48:31] So order today, you'll get a machine in four or five weeks.

[48:34] Great.

[48:35] And are there any main distributors, Jerry, that you want to call out on the show that

[48:39] people should be aware of?

[48:42] So we've been talking to tons of them.

[48:44] We work with Rob Anthony.

[48:48] He's been driving around the country going to show, showing the machine off for us, but

[48:52] I've held off on all the conversation with distributors because they all want machines

[48:56] and we haven't had them to sell.

[48:58] We've been backordered for a long time, obviously, no.

[49:00] So when we get two or three weeks farther, that's when I call distributors and say, hey,

[49:06] listen, let's work it out.

[49:08] How much allocation do you want?

[49:10] We're going to build X number games this month and we'll have some dissent to you.

[49:13] But until we can do that, it doesn't make any sense.

[49:16] I can work on relationships and I can tell someone that they'll be, they'll be the go-to

[49:19] distributor and we'll get all the machines to them or whatever.

[49:22] But until we have machines, none of it matters.

[49:24] That said, I get literally three emails a week from distributors saying, hey, we want

[49:28] to work together.

[49:29] Right.

[49:30] And I'm like, we're almost there.

[49:31] We're almost there.

[49:32] I'll talk to you in three weeks.

[49:33] Right.

[49:34] And that's smart because I think we've seen some times with new companies, distributors,

[49:40] I'm just going to say it.

[49:41] I saw this, I think a lot with American pinballs.

[49:43] They had so many distributors selling Houdini's, but they just didn't have manufacturing

[49:48] really ready to go to have that many orders coming in because then you just have a lot

[49:52] of people who get upset that they, you know, they bought it, they, they ostensibly feel

[49:56] like they bought a game early and they expected soon.

[49:59] But if you spread your allocation too far and wide without enough manufacturing to supply

[50:05] that allocation, you know, no one satisfied, right?

[50:09] We just have to wait a really long time.

[50:11] So I think you've controlled expectations by not going out like that.

[50:15] Well, part of it's that, but there's more to it because the P3 is this machine that some

[50:20] people still aren't sure what it is or why they'd want it or how it's going to be different

[50:26] or maybe it's too different.

[50:27] I mean, I've seen, so we sent a machine up to Jack Danger a few weeks ago and he streamed

[50:32] it for us.

[50:33] We recently sent a machine to Buffalo Pinball to stream it for us.

[50:36] And every time I get on these streams and watch people play it, the same thing happened

[50:40] at the Buffalo Billiards.

[50:41] They did the best city open last weekend and they were streaming it.

[50:44] And there's probably 50% of the people on the streams are like, what is that?

[50:47] I've never seen that before.

[50:48] That looks really neat.

[50:49] And I, you know, so we still have a huge potential market, but all these people that are buying

[50:57] machines today for shipments tomorrow of whatever they are, who deans from American Pinballer,

[51:04] as Cooper's from Spooky, they're people who are used to traditional pinball and they know

[51:09] exactly what they're getting or they think they know exactly what they're getting.

[51:13] And they're not so willing to pre-order to buy this concept that we've been pitching.

[51:22] They're waiting to see machine shipping and to see games for it.

[51:25] So part of it's because we want to manage growth and we don't want to, you know, sign up

[51:29] a lot of people to buy it until we have machines to ship.

[51:32] But it's the flip side too.

[51:35] People need to see this game.

[51:36] This is a game where people walk up to it a show and they're like, oh, this isn't nearly

[51:40] as bad as I thought it would be.

[51:42] Right.

[51:43] Well, and at the price point, at $10,000, when you look at the rest of the hobby, I mean,

[51:49] at that price point, you know, that is like the Ellie Collector's Edition price point

[51:55] where people usually will only spend that much when they're emotionally pulled into

[52:01] some theme that they just have to have, right?

[52:03] That'll be like nail to the floor and they're willing to splurge.

[52:08] The P3 is a platform.

[52:09] It's not trying to sell you one game.

[52:11] It's trying to sell you a platform that can play multiple games for years.

[52:15] You don't have to keep buying, you know, another box, another box, another box.

[52:20] And that's just a, there's a level of education.

[52:22] And to your point, there's a lack of awareness of how that might work and to what they're

[52:28] used to within Pimbal.

[52:29] Now, let me ask you a question, Jerry, because I'm curious about this because you've also

[52:33] invented Piroc, correct?

[52:35] Yes.

[52:36] And Piroc is the engine that has actually pretty much opened up the boutique Pimbal world.

[52:42] So I want to let you know that I get a lot of emails from people when I do give you,

[52:48] I think sometimes I give you some shit on my show, right?

[52:52] I get emails from people being like, you do realize that like Piroc is the reason why

[52:57] we have X, Y and Z and they're right.

[52:59] So I want to let you know that you should be very proud of the engine you built.

[53:05] So when you see a game like total nuclear annihilation running on your engine, Scott

[53:10] Denise's game, you know, he took a much more simple approach and unique approach to

[53:15] Pimbal.

[53:16] And it's been a phenomenal success for Spukia.

[53:19] I think now there are over 300 games have been ordered and I think are off the door almost.

[53:24] Do you ever, like, couple questions, like how do you feel seeing your engine sort of drive

[53:30] so many games people are excited by?

[53:33] And also do you ever ask yourself, why didn't I just go that simple route and sell 300,

[53:39] 400 games and get some revenue in the door and then maybe, you know, take more of the

[53:44] innovative leap?

[53:45] Yeah.

[53:46] Two different, very different questions there.

[53:48] So obviously anyone who creates something new, they have their own motivations for doing.

[53:56] So I personally like creating new ways of using technology to do cool things.

[54:02] And originally actually I created the Piroc because I had this vision for a P3 and I need

[54:05] the controller for it.

[54:06] But along the way we started pitching it to the community and seeing what people wanted

[54:11] to do with it and kind of grew organically into this controller that people could use for

[54:15] custom games.

[54:17] I spend probably 30 or 40 percent of my day every day, even when I'm at the manufacturing

[54:23] plant at I'm sitting there online talking to developers of projects using our boards.

[54:30] I talk to we have a Slack channel where developers hang out and we talk them through design

[54:35] questions.

[54:36] We talk them through problems they're having.

[54:37] We talk them through the software configurations or the software tools.

[54:41] I still love that.

[54:42] I love helping people take their passion, take their ideas and implement it into games.

[54:48] I mean people like Scott Denese and Josh Kugler and Michael Ocean and you know, Jippy

[54:52] Lippum people who are becoming very high profile in this industry for pinball software development

[54:59] and pinball game design.

[55:01] These are people who we all kind of grew this community together.

[55:05] They bought Piroc's way back when for personal projects and they are the names of this industry

[55:10] now.

[55:11] And it's super exciting.

[55:13] I mean, we're all super proud of each other.

[55:16] It's neat that we've all kind of created this community.

[55:18] Even more so, we've created these software and hardware tools.

[55:21] The Piroc and the frameworks that were developed around the Piroc are what these companies

[55:26] are using to get their products out.

[55:29] And we've got active developers.

[55:30] Michael Ocean is still on there every day solving problems.

[55:33] Framework problems are adding new features to the framework to help people like spooky

[55:37] and people like American pinball get their machines out the door.

[55:42] So I mean, it's a community feel.

[55:43] It's fun to be a part of that.

[55:45] It's obviously fun to create the project that has, I don't know, it's spurred on a lot

[55:51] of this boutique development.

[55:52] It's been the foundational piece for a lot of these people to start their businesses.

[55:58] Sorry.

[55:59] Now that I talk so much, I forget the other part of the question.

[56:02] I guess the point to the thing I was asking is, you've blood-swedding tears for years

[56:09] innovating and making a completely new platform on how to envision pinball.

[56:15] And you put your P3 next to TNA with no ramps and cool sound system, cool lighting.

[56:22] Are you ever just like, come on.

[56:25] I've did all this work.

[56:27] These guys are selling this thing left and right.

[56:29] It's like going in the other direction.

[56:31] It's simplifying pinball where you're innovating.

[56:34] And clearly there's a market for TNA as the sales have shown.

[56:40] Have you ever just kind of been like, maybe we should have just gone a little simpler first

[56:46] and then taken more of the leap to where we're at?

[56:50] So in retrospect, like I said before, I don't like to play that game, but the answer is totally

[56:55] no.

[56:56] I had these discussions six years ago.

[56:58] We had people that are like, dude, what are you doing?

[57:00] Why don't you just make a game?

[57:02] Get a game out the door.

[57:03] Fund your company through the development of a game.

[57:07] And you know, this whole process leading up to me starting a company, I used to sit there

[57:11] and talk to people and come up with ideas.

[57:13] I've always been this guy with ideas I want to do something.

[57:17] And I kept trying to find the idea that I wanted to do.

[57:20] And there's a whole backstory here that I started the company to do something else and

[57:24] kind of drifted away.

[57:27] And while I was doing that, I got more into pinball.

[57:29] But I've always been somebody who gets these ideas or talks to people about ideas.

[57:36] And I don't care about the idea unless it's something that I feel something for.

[57:40] It's got to drive me.

[57:41] It's got to be something that I'm passionate about.

[57:43] And building another pinball machine with a different theme or a different layout or

[57:48] whatever and selling it as a one-off game just never interested in me.

[57:51] I had zero interest.

[57:53] People still, I mean, I heard you say it on a podcast a few months ago or a couple months

[57:57] ago.

[57:58] And I was like, no, I don't have that regret at all.

[58:01] I don't want to do that.

[58:02] It's not what I want to do.

[58:03] I want to create something new and cool and exciting.

[58:06] I want to give people the ability to enjoy it pinball in a different way.

[58:11] I want to give people different value for their money.

[58:13] I want to give developers this platform that they can develop cool games on.

[58:17] I don't care that it's been a struggle because I love what I'm doing and I love what

[58:21] we're creating.

[58:22] And the people who get our vision, the people who come to us at a show and they see this

[58:28] platform machine for the first time and they stay on our booth for four hours watching

[58:32] people play and thinking about all the cool ideas they can do with it.

[58:36] Those people justify all of it for me because it's super awesome to create this thing

[58:41] from scratch, designing something from the ground up that enables so much more than

[58:45] existing products.

[58:46] Right.

[58:47] So yeah, I mean, it'd be nice to have a lot more money into a cello game and to have

[58:50] 300 machines sold under our belt and shipped and be able to sustain the business.

[58:56] The flip side is we're leveraging that anyway because we're selling p-rocks to spooky into

[59:01] American pinball and hopefully to circus Maximus for kingpin and of course we sold them to

[59:05] Dutch pinball for the big Lebowski.

[59:07] We're making money on the sales of boards to companies building machines.

[59:13] So we're still able to help fund our business that way.

[59:17] But ultimately the answer is no.

[59:18] I want to do the P3.

[59:19] I want to create this machine.

[59:21] I have no interest in another and another single theme game.

[59:24] Jerry and I totally respect that.

[59:28] Walk me through P-rock and how it works with other manufacturers.

[59:32] So is there a licensing fee for them to use the software or are they just, is it the

[59:37] cost the purchasing of the boards?

[59:40] How does it work?

[59:41] If I found my company and I want to use your system.

[59:45] So the P-rock itself and most companies, so the original P-rock board is a board that

[59:50] was backwards compatible with WC and WPC and Stern machines.

[59:55] People use that for re-themed and stuff.

[59:56] Most of the new companies designing new machines are using what we call the P3 rock which

[01:00:01] is a next generation version of the P-rock which coincidentally is named because we're

[01:00:06] using it in the P3.

[01:00:07] So it's the P3 rock.

[01:00:09] It's a set of driver boards, a set of switch boards, it's a set of LED boards and all

[01:00:14] together it's a hardware system.

[01:00:17] There's some firmware running on the boards that handle a lot of the low level circuitry

[01:00:21] and logic that controls switch matrices or actually there aren't switch matrices.

[01:00:25] We use direct switches but there are coil controls where you can issue a command to

[01:00:30] pause the coil and the hardware does all the timing for that and you know, lamp schedules

[01:00:33] and LED fades and all that stuff.

[01:00:36] The hardware system is something people buy.

[01:00:39] It's a product you go to our website, you say I want to buy one or I want to buy a thousand

[01:00:42] of them.

[01:00:43] Or you talk to me directly and we work at a deal and we ship you a bunch of boards for

[01:00:47] your machine.

[01:00:48] The software frameworks, I was a part, we had a couple other people that were a part

[01:00:54] of developing the software frameworks but we developed those as open source community

[01:01:00] projects.

[01:01:01] So we don't own the software framework, something like Pypro game which is the original

[01:01:06] Python framework people used to develop games using the P-rock has been software term

[01:01:12] it's called forked people have copied it and then extended the functionality of it.

[01:01:16] Michael Ocean developed with some help from Josh Kugler.

[01:01:20] They developed an extension of Pypro game they call it skeleton game.

[01:01:23] It can now do HD graphics and a lot of additional functionality to help people get started.

[01:01:29] But those software frameworks are open source, free to download, free to use.

[01:01:35] Another one is the mission pinball framework that was developed as an extension originally

[01:01:40] of Pypro game and then they kind of fought it off completely and now it's a different

[01:01:43] animal.

[01:01:44] But those are two software frameworks that people can download and use for free.

[01:01:49] So we make money on selling the boards.

[01:01:51] Software framework guys usually make money by offering their services to help companies

[01:01:57] add features or whatever to their machines.

[01:02:00] Okay got it.

[01:02:01] Well that's good.

[01:02:02] I mean you've got money coming in from P-rock.

[01:02:06] We've got orders coming in for multi-morphic P-3.

[01:02:11] Four to five weeks people if you're listening to the show and you're checking out information

[01:02:15] on it four to five weeks if you order today.

[01:02:19] Question let's see I have some listeners to write in some questions.

[01:02:23] Someone wrote something and I just wanted to ask you if you felt responsible for this.

[01:02:27] But they said now that spooky has switched over from the pinhex system that Benheck developed

[01:02:33] to the P-3 rock system for Alice Cooper for TNA.

[01:02:39] They wanted me to ask you if you felt responsible for Benheck leaving the pinball.

[01:02:45] The answer is no.

[01:02:46] Benheck makes his own choices.

[01:02:47] He's a grown ass adult.

[01:02:49] But no the heck board's cool actually.

[01:02:51] It's just I think they had some features in Alice Cooper that it wasn't powerful enough

[01:02:57] to use.

[01:02:58] So they were struggling before TPS so they switched over and we got them running and

[01:03:02] we helped them get their demo going.

[01:03:05] The P-Rock is interesting because it's not tied to a CPU and we did that on purpose.

[01:03:10] It's a USB controller that connects to any kind of CPU element.

[01:03:15] So for example in a traditional type of game you can run a pretty low powered CPU like

[01:03:21] a Raspberry Pi or I think spooky using a thing called an upboard or a small Intel processor

[01:03:28] or something in a small motherboard.

[01:03:30] Whereas on the P-3 we're using the exact same P-3 rock control system but we're driving

[01:03:35] it with a big computer motherboard with a high end graphic card and all that stuff so

[01:03:40] that we can push crazy dynamic graphics on the screen.

[01:03:43] So more or less I mean I don't know what happened between Benheck and Charlie.

[01:03:47] I assume it was a friendly breakup and Ben just wanted to move on.

[01:03:50] I know he didn't stop doing his show too.

[01:03:52] So I think he just wanted to make a change or whatever.

[01:03:55] It's taking a break.

[01:03:56] Like a Canadian break.

[01:03:57] You never know.

[01:03:58] I don't think anything is like a Canadian break.

[01:04:02] It's like hours of therapy in alcohol.

[01:04:04] No, I joke.

[01:04:06] Yeah, I don't know.

[01:04:07] He's kind of in MIA.

[01:04:08] I've been trying to get Ben on the show to talk about what happened.

[01:04:11] I think if I were to just speculate I think what happened was the success of TNA sort of

[01:04:17] allowed Charlie to push Alice Cooper back more to let them develop it with more over a

[01:04:23] longer period of time which then I think push Ben's game out indefinitely and I think

[01:04:28] that's when it was like you know what I'm not going to stick around not knowing when

[01:04:31] things are going to move on his title.

[01:04:34] So it happens.

[01:04:35] You know, look, I think Charlie's probably happy TNAs are flying out the door.

[01:04:41] So it is what it is.

[01:04:43] There's always reasons people walk.

[01:04:45] I don't pretend to be inside the man's head.

[01:04:48] So let's see Jerry, I got another question.

[01:04:51] Someone asked me if you could money aside, if you could put your dream theme on the P3

[01:04:58] that you think would really show off its ultimate potential, what theme would it be?

[01:05:03] And you can say Lexi Lightspeed, Ken and Lagoon or Cosmic Cart Racing.

[01:05:07] I can say this now because we're not doing it.

[01:05:11] I wanted the Incredibles.

[01:05:15] I wanted especially now that the Incredibles two just came out.

[01:05:18] I wanted the Incredibles.

[01:05:20] So three years ago I started talking to people about how much it would cost to get something

[01:05:24] like that.

[01:05:25] And obviously we just don't have the money to be able to afford something like that.

[01:05:28] But that's what I wanted.

[01:05:29] Incredibles.

[01:05:30] Before that I wanted Firefly.

[01:05:31] And I don't even know if Fox is willing to talk to people about Firefly.

[01:05:40] That show never happened.

[01:05:42] I talked to them in 2012 actually about getting the show Firefly.

[01:05:47] And I talked to their licensing people and talked about money.

[01:05:50] We were a brand new startup and obviously we didn't have much money and they didn't want

[01:05:54] to put a license in the hands of someone who didn't know an experience so that just didn't

[01:05:58] work out.

[01:05:59] But first Firefly and then the Incredibles, if I had money that's what I would have done.

[01:06:02] Okay.

[01:06:03] I got to ask you a question.

[01:06:05] Speaking of money, there has been a new pinball player that has appeared of the last year

[01:06:09] and that is deep root pinball and Robert Mueller.

[01:06:13] And Robert's, you know, he's been assembling a team and he sort of paints himself as someone

[01:06:18] who has been talking to a lot of people in the industry and exploring many different

[01:06:23] ways in which to bring pinball out and innovate and change the game.

[01:06:28] Have you ever been approached by Robert or talked to him about potentially becoming an

[01:06:33] investor in your platform or making a game?

[01:06:37] You know, seeing if there's any synergies between your vision and his vision at all because

[01:06:44] I think he's talking to a lot of people.

[01:06:46] Sure.

[01:06:47] I think Robert's probably talked to everyone in the industry at this point.

[01:06:50] He works and lives right down the street from us.

[01:06:52] We're in Austin, Texas.

[01:06:53] He's in San Antonio, Texas.

[01:06:55] So of course we've talked, we've talked about money, we've talked about business, we've

[01:07:00] talked about visions.

[01:07:02] We don't see eye to eye, I think, on a lot of things.

[01:07:07] We're very different people with different goals.

[01:07:11] Very specifically, and I don't want to get into a lot of details.

[01:07:14] He's doing his thing and we're doing his, we're doing our thing.

[01:07:17] But I'm an engineer.

[01:07:20] What I do, what I did in my life was build products.

[01:07:23] I like coming up with ideas and then implementing them.

[01:07:26] I like doing the low level implementation and you know, making things work and testing

[01:07:30] them and fixing them.

[01:07:32] That's what I do.

[01:07:33] I tell people the truth about what we're doing.

[01:07:35] I tell people the truth about what our plans are and that's just the kind of person I

[01:07:40] am.

[01:07:41] I'm big on saying what you mean, doing what you say and working your butt off to

[01:07:47] make your customers and your employees, you know, respect you and you respect them and

[01:07:52] everyone kind of works together.

[01:07:54] Well, I'm not big on talk.

[01:07:55] I just want to, I just want to build a product.

[01:07:59] The flip side is he's coming into this industry with tons of money, right?

[01:08:04] He's spending money.

[01:08:05] He's paying for people.

[01:08:06] He's who knows they may be perfect.

[01:08:09] They may be, they may be super successful.

[01:08:11] They might bring in these super new ideas and create something amazing.

[01:08:15] He's certainly spending the money to make it happen.

[01:08:18] But on the flip side, you're nothing until you ship a product.

[01:08:22] Right.

[01:08:23] And you can say whatever you want, you can tell people they suck and you're awesome.

[01:08:27] You can tell people that you're going to do something amazing.

[01:08:29] And frankly, a lot of the stuff that he's saying are things that we've done.

[01:08:32] This innovation, all these things, creating this system that's different, changing manufacturing,

[01:08:38] changing control systems, doing all these things.

[01:08:40] We've already done all that.

[01:08:41] We have patents to protect all that.

[01:08:43] So I'm actually curious to see what they're planning.

[01:08:46] I hope he's successful.

[01:08:47] I hope he grows the industry.

[01:08:49] I hope he brings a lot more people to the industry because then we can sell to them too.

[01:08:54] Right.

[01:08:55] Right.

[01:08:56] I'm just a purely, this is just a basic question.

[01:09:00] Are you bored by like just the same, when you see Stern just releasing the same type

[01:09:05] of game over and over and over again?

[01:09:07] Am I bored?

[01:09:08] I'm not bored.

[01:09:10] I am excited that no one's stepping into our space yet because we're doing this new and

[01:09:18] different thing.

[01:09:20] And the longer it takes anybody else to innovate, the longer it takes anyone else to break

[01:09:26] into these new and cool features like ball tracking and modularity, the longer we have

[01:09:32] to build our brand and create this catalog of games.

[01:09:39] I kind of enjoy the fact that nobody else is innovating.

[01:09:43] And maybe I'm the stupid one.

[01:09:45] Maybe no one else is innovating because customers don't want innovations.

[01:09:48] Well, that I was going to play Devils Advocate and say, so you're Stern and you're selling

[01:09:53] thousands of games a year, right?

[01:09:55] And they're pretty much making the same game over the last 30 years with just better artwork

[01:10:00] and better displays now.

[01:10:02] For the most part, the game hasn't changed much, right?

[01:10:06] And do you ever worry, Jerry, that maybe the buyer just won't change either?

[01:10:13] That pinball might be stuck like where it's at and this is as this is this is all people

[01:10:20] need to get excited by pinball is like what's going on?

[01:10:23] Jersey Jack is putting out and maybe you leaped too far.

[01:10:27] Yes, that's certainly a risk, although at least right now, like I said earlier, we're still

[01:10:33] backordered.

[01:10:34] We're still unable to fill all the orders that we're getting and we have plans for leveraging

[01:10:39] distribution growing.

[01:10:40] So I don't think that we've developed a product that won't be super successful every time

[01:10:47] we bring out a new game every time we bring out a new feature, we're creating more interest

[01:10:52] in the product and we can't build them fast enough yet.

[01:10:57] That said, I mean, looking at the other side of the street, the grass is greener.

[01:11:04] It'd be nice if we saw this community of people, if we saw a thousand people that are like,

[01:11:09] you know what, if you had a machine out there today that we buy it, we buy it right now.

[01:11:13] Yeah, it's always nice to look at that, but the reality is we're doing what we like,

[01:11:18] we're creating a product we enjoy, we've got people that are passionate about it and

[01:11:22] we're growing into that market.

[01:11:25] People are learning about it, people are understanding it, people are buying it.

[01:11:29] And I say this all the time.

[01:11:32] While someday maybe we'd like to be as big as Stern, I mean, some people say they don't

[01:11:37] want to be as big as Stern and I don't know if that's just them trying to talk themselves

[01:11:42] down or explain why they're not growing super fast.

[01:11:46] But there's valid reasons to build a lifestyle company and just, you know, build enough for

[01:11:54] to keep you happy and to sustain a small community of people.

[01:11:57] But while someday we might want to grow and be that big, we can't just, you know, wake

[01:12:03] up tomorrow and if we had a million dollars, go spend it on 10Xing our manufacturing

[01:12:11] capabilities.

[01:12:12] You have to manage your growth, you have to start small, you have to build a product,

[01:12:16] you can work out the bugs, you can ship products to customers.

[01:12:19] You know what, if we sold, if we sold a hundred machines a month, 1,200 machines a year

[01:12:26] and we had a manufacturing issue because we haven't had enough time to sort out everything,

[01:12:31] then we have to fix 1,200 machines.

[01:12:33] If we're selling one machine a month, we only have to fix 12 machines and of course those

[01:12:37] are both extremes for us right now.

[01:12:39] We're somewhere in the middle of that.

[01:12:40] But you have to manage your growth, we have to, I am growing as a manager of a company,

[01:12:46] we're learning how to interact with our manufacturing people, we're learning how to support

[01:12:50] customers and it's a process and we have to learn to do that and we have to manage our

[01:12:56] ability to grow into that.

[01:12:58] So yeah, be nice to sell a thousand machines a month or whatever, stern selling these days.

[01:13:03] But we just want to enjoy what we're doing and grow in a way that we can sustain ourselves.

[01:13:11] Right.

[01:13:12] Have you sort of looked at spooky in the way they've grown gradually as sort of insurances

[01:13:16] and inspiration for where you want to see your company go?

[01:13:19] Yeah, I have a lot of respect for Charlie.

[01:13:21] He's done this a similar way to how we have.

[01:13:24] He essentially bootstrapped his company and he started out very small.

[01:13:28] I think they sold about 150 America's most honoured and have grown their production line

[01:13:33] every game since or at least their big title since then.

[01:13:37] Yeah, I mean, I'd love to follow in his footsteps.

[01:13:40] I'd love to sell 100 or 150 games or get 150 games out the door our first year and

[01:13:45] grow to 250 or 300 a second year and 500 to the third year.

[01:13:48] That'd be fantastic.

[01:13:49] That's maintainable, manageable growth and that's the only way to be successful long-term

[01:13:53] unless somebody drops two million dollars on your door.

[01:13:56] Right.

[01:13:57] Jerry, you've seen the plethora of pinball manufacturers.

[01:14:03] Some of them have been nothing but words.

[01:14:05] Some of them have had a few games get out there then collapse.

[01:14:10] Knowing the market and knowing there's only a finite amount of people in America and

[01:14:14] in the world who will buy a pinball machine.

[01:14:17] Do you think there's too many companies now?

[01:14:20] I mean, there's a lot more now than when you started or do you think the market will

[01:14:26] sort of have winners and losers and it'll be less people a year or two from now but only

[01:14:32] those who know how to manufacture will survive.

[01:14:35] What's your take on where the hobby's at with the amount of people that are trying to sell

[01:14:39] games these days?

[01:14:41] So there are a lot of players in the industry right now, yes.

[01:14:45] And not all of them will survive and we've already seen a couple of them kind of to give

[01:14:50] it up.

[01:14:53] I see this industry.

[01:14:59] It's not going to disappear.

[01:15:00] I mean, there's going to be a market for pinball machines all the time.

[01:15:03] There's new technology that's coming out.

[01:15:06] People are starting to put more exciting things on their machines.

[01:15:08] The market's going to exist.

[01:15:09] In fact, the market's still growing right now.

[01:15:11] It's been growing.

[01:15:12] They'll ask for five or maybe even six or seven years.

[01:15:14] I think it hit a law in the 2009, 2010 area and then Jersey Jek started and we've kind

[01:15:21] of been growing since then as an industry.

[01:15:24] I personally don't think traditional pinball can sustain five or six manufacturers but

[01:15:32] I think that's great for them because they're all traditional pinball companies and we're

[01:15:35] different.

[01:15:36] And creating this thing, we don't want to sell five P3s to a customer.

[01:15:43] Stern needs to sell five of their pinball machines to everyone or they want to.

[01:15:47] They want to sell as many as they can to every person.

[01:15:49] We want to sell one P3 to everyone.

[01:15:51] We want to come up with this platform that is cool enough that it's a big enough library

[01:15:55] that everyone likes it enough to buy it but we don't need to sell more than one to them

[01:16:00] because it's a platform machine.

[01:16:02] People don't own two Nintendo's or two PlayStation's.

[01:16:04] A lot of people buy one of every variation of a gaming console but people don't usually

[01:16:09] buy two of each one and that's where we want to be.

[01:16:12] So I think even if the market shrinks a little bit as long as we create a platform that interests

[01:16:18] people enough if we create a platform that interests every single person.

[01:16:22] If we come out with three games that interest you and three completely different games that

[01:16:26] interest somebody else and they all run on the P3, you'll both buy a P3.

[01:16:30] Right.

[01:16:31] So, Jerry, how far away are we from a networked P3 platform?

[01:16:35] We're there.

[01:16:38] We just haven't shipped the games yet.

[01:16:39] So we have heads up which is the game we showed off at TPS 2017 which is an online networkable

[01:16:46] game.

[01:16:47] Two P3s can talk to each other.

[01:16:49] We showed off Cosmic Cart Racing this year at TPS.

[01:16:52] It's our newest game.

[01:16:54] It's not shipping yet.

[01:16:56] It's in production.

[01:16:57] We've started to get parts in so we can build them.

[01:16:59] The Cart Racing is a game just like any video game Cart Racing game.

[01:17:04] It's networkable.

[01:17:05] So you can get online.

[01:17:07] You can play games, three of your buddies, each with your own P3s or there can be some

[01:17:11] computer cards in there if you don't have four people that are all playing at the same

[01:17:15] time.

[01:17:16] But we're sitting here developing the network engines for those now.

[01:17:19] So as soon as we ship CCR, I don't know if the network capabilities will be on day

[01:17:24] one, but we're developing them now.

[01:17:26] So the idea is you'll get a P3.

[01:17:28] You can log on to your Cosmic Cart Racing game.

[01:17:31] It'll connect to the server and say, hey, I want to play with him.

[01:17:34] He's over out there.

[01:17:35] Is anyone else there?

[01:17:36] Do you want to play?

[01:17:37] And it'll connect machines together and that's it.

[01:17:39] We're there.

[01:17:40] Are you ever surprised at how far behind the pinball hobby is with regards to technology

[01:17:49] like connectivity and internet?

[01:17:52] And it still is very archaic the way we're sticking USB sticks into games to update them

[01:18:02] when why can't it just be like Wi-Fi connected and update?

[01:18:06] You know, it's like the things are we're still living decades in the past with a lot of

[01:18:13] the game.

[01:18:14] Well, so you as a consumer of pinball, you want cool stuff.

[01:18:18] You want your life to be easier.

[01:18:19] You want cool features.

[01:18:22] But now, if you're going to keep buying games that don't have those features, then there's

[01:18:26] no reason for manufacturers to create them.

[01:18:28] There's no reason for somebody to go spend a few hundred thousand dollars to put a team

[01:18:33] together to go develop features that are going to create zero more sales.

[01:18:38] It's return on investment.

[01:18:39] There's no point.

[01:18:41] The only reason a company is going to create those features is because they want to enter

[01:18:44] the market.

[01:18:45] They want to create something and carve out a niche that they can sell into.

[01:18:49] And that's what we're doing.

[01:18:51] So now that we're doing it, here's the interesting thing about this industry back to your other

[01:18:56] question.

[01:18:57] Well, we've got five or six players in this industry now.

[01:19:00] And as you mentioned, well, we both kind of discussed, we don't think necessarily that

[01:19:05] the industry can maintain all these manufacturers.

[01:19:08] So at some point, there'll either be someone who just wins, you know, stirns big enough.

[01:19:13] They can maybe survive long enough to watch all these companies start drifting away.

[01:19:20] Or if companies start consolidating and taking these ideas from each other and combining

[01:19:26] them into a platform, let's say, let's say company A sells, you know, 2000 machines a year

[01:19:31] and company B sells 3000 machines a year.

[01:19:33] If they combine, they're selling 5000 machines a year.

[01:19:36] And that's a lot more to a single company's bottom line than if you split it up.

[01:19:40] So the fact that we have this technology, we have this multi-game platform, we have these

[01:19:45] high tech features, ball tracking, and that we're gaming capabilities and profile systems

[01:19:50] and all this stuff that's kind of new technology for pinball.

[01:19:54] If somebody wants to, if a big player wants to differentiate themselves, they don't have

[01:19:57] to develop it.

[01:19:58] We have it.

[01:19:59] They can just buy the technology or work with us to make it happen.

[01:20:03] Right.

[01:20:04] A couple more questions, Jerry.

[01:20:06] Yeah.

[01:20:07] Next, new games coming out for you guys.

[01:20:10] Like, anything in development that you're super excited about that.

[01:20:13] Yeah.

[01:20:14] The tentative release date that is going to be, is it going to be expo, TPS, like what?

[01:20:19] No.

[01:20:20] Oh, yes.

[01:20:21] There's a lot in development, but the ultimate, but we are past the point of pre-announcing

[01:20:32] games.

[01:20:33] We don't need to do it anymore.

[01:20:34] We are a couple months away from shipping Cosmic Heart Racing and we're not just going

[01:20:39] to ship a game and then start a new project.

[01:20:41] So, I mean, obviously we've been working on projects throughout the process.

[01:20:45] We have a few mini games in development.

[01:20:48] But we still haven't shipped heads up or wizard or Grand Slam rally yet.

[01:20:54] So we've got to get those off the door in a few months.

[01:20:57] We've got to get Cosmic Heart Racing out.

[01:21:00] And we already have people working on new mini games.

[01:21:02] We have third party developers who are using our dev kit.

[01:21:05] I got an email which is it.

[01:21:07] It was out of the blue, is about three or four months ago from a person I'd never met

[01:21:12] before.

[01:21:13] And he emailed me and he said, hey, I think your pinball machine is really cool.

[01:21:16] I'm a game developer.

[01:21:17] I want to make a game for it.

[01:21:19] And I'm like, that's awesome, but that's weird because he doesn't have a machine and he

[01:21:26] doesn't know the market.

[01:21:27] He just saw a cool platform and he, I emailed him in early versions of the dev kit and literally

[01:21:32] he emailed me last week.

[01:21:34] He said, hey, my game's ready for beta.

[01:21:35] How do I get it out to people?

[01:21:37] Right.

[01:21:38] Like, that's super cool.

[01:21:39] That just completely, we didn't have to support him.

[01:21:41] We didn't have to tell him how to use the dev kit.

[01:21:42] He figured everything out on his own.

[01:21:44] He built his entire game and he's ready to test it.

[01:21:47] And that's awesome.

[01:21:49] We have three games in development from people close to the team, three mini games.

[01:21:55] And we started on the next game that comes after CCR as well.

[01:21:59] But no, I'm not going to go and announce dates or timelines or anything else because

[01:22:04] we just want to work on games and get them out when they're ready.

[01:22:06] There's no six days of multi-morphic coming at TPS, so I can't report that.

[01:22:11] I mean, hopefully there's a few thousand days of multi-morphic coming out.

[01:22:14] We'll see.

[01:22:15] Well, Jay, I really appreciate you coming on.

[01:22:16] I mean, the hour goes fast.

[01:22:18] It's been an hour.

[01:22:19] We've been chatting.

[01:22:20] Any final words you want to say to the, if I still have some listeners left, they'll

[01:22:24] hear it the next week when I, when I revived the show, but any, any final words?

[01:22:29] Yes.

[01:22:30] So multi-morphic.com is our website.

[01:22:32] Check out what we're selling now.

[01:22:34] We are trying to revolutionize.

[01:22:37] Well, we're not trying to revolutionize the industry.

[01:22:40] We're trying to bring revolutionary products to the industry.

[01:22:42] We're trying to bring new ideas.

[01:22:44] We're trying to give people more value for their money.

[01:22:48] We have shipped machines.

[01:22:50] We're shipping machines.

[01:22:51] We're finishing up the pre-orders.

[01:22:54] And what I want you to know about me is that I live my life in the minds of customers

[01:23:04] in the lives of my employees.

[01:23:06] And I don't feel right unless they're getting what they deserve.

[01:23:10] If somebody gives us money, they spend money.

[01:23:12] They buy a $10,000 pin-mo machine.

[01:23:14] Then I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure they get what they deserve.

[01:23:19] They get the value they deserve.

[01:23:20] They get the machine they deserve.

[01:23:22] They get a functional machine.

[01:23:23] We can resolve any problems that they have.

[01:23:26] And that's just the type of person I am and that's the type of business I want to create.

[01:23:29] So if you invest in our machines, if you want to participate in development of games,

[01:23:36] if you want to be a part of this, this called an evolution of pin-balls that we're trying

[01:23:41] to push forward, then we'll do it together.

[01:23:44] We'll be passionate about what we're doing and we'll make it happen.

[01:23:48] I think that's very well said, Jerry.

[01:23:50] Well, Jerry, thank you for coming on.

[01:23:52] Again, I apologize for the delay.

[01:23:54] I'm happy to hear that orders are coming in.

[01:23:57] It's exciting to see that it's sold out on the website.

[01:24:00] So for those of you, four to five weeks, as we said, if you're looking to get into P3

[01:24:06] multi-morphic, I would encourage people to.

[01:24:09] There's a lot of good videos online of the platform in use that you can check out, check

[01:24:14] out like stuff like Lexi Light Speed, P3 multi-morphic.

[01:24:18] And if you're at a show, I think ultimately though, the most fun I've had, I'd never really

[01:24:22] have fun to be honest watching pinball videos.

[01:24:24] It is going and playing the machine at shows.

[01:24:28] I think that is where you really will get what the platform is about.

[01:24:32] So yeah, and the P3, it's proved itself over and over again that it's a machine that

[01:24:36] you have to play.

[01:24:37] You have to touch it.

[01:24:38] You have to feel it.

[01:24:39] You have to understand the fact.

[01:24:40] It looks like virtual pinball sometimes.

[01:24:42] It's not.

[01:24:43] It's physical pinball.

[01:24:44] It's a real ball rolling around a play field hitting physical things and interacting

[01:24:47] with virtual things at the same time.

[01:24:49] But it's this product that a lot of people look at videos and they think it's not something

[01:24:53] that will relate to them and then they go play it and they're like holy crap, this is

[01:24:57] cool.

[01:24:58] Right.

[01:24:59] Well, Jerry, thank you so much.

[01:25:01] Have a great 4th of July.

[01:25:03] This is going to probably air just a little bit after because I think my revival show

[01:25:07] is that day.

[01:25:08] So this will be up probably that Thursday, Friday.

[01:25:11] But thank you again for coming on and I hope to talk to you soon and see you at a show

[01:25:14] in the near future.

[01:25:15] Yeah, thanks Chris.

[01:25:16] I also appreciate it's always fun chatting in a best look to you on your show too.

[01:25:21] Thank you.
