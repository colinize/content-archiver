[00:00] If you walked into a restaurant and ordered their most expensive steak on the menu,

[00:28] the waiter came over to you and said, I just have to inform you that the steak is not finished cooking,

[00:34] the way you'd like it, but I can give it to you now. Would you tell him to bring the steak out?

[00:40] That is exactly what has occurred with Batman 66, and all of the stern people out there that are

[00:47] continually upset and angry that their Batman isn't ready yet, that there's no code available for

[00:55] their game that finishes off the game that they spent so much money on. And it is a year ago today.

[01:00] It is a year ago August 2016 is when stern took deposits on Batman 66 and what did people do?

[01:08] They basically said, take my money, stern, take my money. They sold out of a $15,000 pinball machine

[01:15] before anyone had even seen it. They sold out of 240 LEs before people had even seen it.

[01:24] And so in a climate like this, what do you expect? Who's the blame? Is stern to blame?

[01:30] Or is the pinball collector to blame who clearly showcased absolutely no self-control over their money

[01:37] and over their expectations from stern pinball? And we all know by now, and I've said it at this point,

[01:44] at this point, how can you even expect stern pinball to give you a game with finish code upon

[01:50] release? If you know when they first showed the game, the code is not even close to being done.

[01:56] And like Ghostbusters was pretty much done when it came out. So I think people thought

[02:01] Batman would be further along. But the reality is when they showed Batman at Expo 2016,

[02:07] it wasn't even playable because there was hardly any code in the game then. So it has been

[02:13] almost a year since then. And the game is still not that amazing game. And I really think people

[02:24] who are now saying like, Stern's not going to get my money anymore and stern this. And I can't

[02:30] believe they're crapping on their customers with this game and how could they do it?

[02:36] The reality is this, you knew what you were getting into. You really have nobody to blame but

[02:44] yourself. Once you pay someone for a job done, before the job is done, what do you expect is going

[02:50] to happen? Do you really think Lyman is working 20 hour days to get this thing together for you?

[02:57] Maybe he is. Then is Lyman the most inefficient and slow coder on the planet?

[03:04] I've spoken to some friends who have friends who code for a living and they are just saying it

[03:09] should not take this long. It just shouldn't. You have people saying that Lyman is spread too thin.

[03:15] So which one is it? Because George Gomez tells you that he's only working on Batman. And then we

[03:21] hear he's spread too thin. So at some point, at some point, I think people need to realize one

[03:30] other thing is that there are a lot of people out there with Batman 66 that are just enjoying the

[03:35] machine that don't even know or realize all the nuances of code and wizard modes and Lyman

[03:44] polishing the game. They're just playing the game and enjoying it. And if you think that

[03:49] everybody who buys a stern pinball machine is waiting for code to be complete, I think you're

[03:55] absolutely wrong. I think a lot of people who buy these machines who play them on location,

[04:00] they are unaware of the game's lack of code and the fact that the game isn't finished.

[04:07] But look, look, it's a broken record. Do I wish you guys had your code? I do wish you had your code.

[04:14] But you basically, I mean, I'm doing a renovation in my apartment. If I paid my contractor in full,

[04:20] before he even did anything, do you think he'd be here? Do you think he'd be slaving away? No,

[04:26] I paid him one third of the job. And so he doesn't get paid the second third of the job until

[04:32] they demo the entire kitchen. They do all the floors in the living room. And then he doesn't get

[04:36] the final third until I'm completely satisfied with the job. You paid stern and fall before even

[04:43] seeing it, before even seeing it. So part of me is like, I don't even want to hear people complain.

[04:49] They're fed up and that they're closing their checkbook to stern. I was reading on Pinside

[04:55] Taz. He says, well, I do know now and my checkbook is closed when it comes to stern sadly after

[05:02] eight new inbox and about $50,000 in revenue to stern in as many years. For the first time,

[05:08] my growing bitterness about it is causing me to root against them and hope one of the new manufacturers

[05:14] supplants them. I hate that I feel that way, but it's the only reaction I have left at this point.

[05:20] See, it's stuff like this. You've spent $50,000 on pinball machines and now you're rooting

[05:27] against the company that took your money. Stern made machines. All those years, Taz, that you want

[05:35] it new pinball. Who are you going to give your money to? Nobody else is making machines.

[05:40] Now we have a lot of machines coming out. I think a lot of people are starting to second guess

[05:46] where to spend their money and what to do with their money. If you're burned by stern, you can go

[05:51] get it dialed in. You can go put money down on a Houdini. You can go get an attack from Mars remake.

[05:57] You can go get a P3. You can go get maybe alien. There's a lot of options out there. It's not just

[06:04] stern, but it is what it is. Batman is what it is. My hunch on Batman is very simply. I think

[06:14] Lyman is having a really hard time coding a game that's based on 120 TV episodes of Batman.

[06:22] I think this pin would have been a lot easier to code had it been the Batman movie and that's

[06:29] what the game was based on versus all those episodes. I think this is the first time that he's

[06:34] had a code machine using the new LCD. First time he's had a program machine using all these clips

[06:40] and going through them and all these different things. I think it's a lot more difficult for him

[06:45] than ever before. He might just be learning as he's going how to do it with this new format.

[06:52] I think that's what's slowing him down. It's been a year. I hope you guys get your code,

[06:59] but I also think that people need to stop complaining and blaming stern. You bought it and they

[07:03] told you it wasn't ready when you bought it. No one said it was going to be complete. I do understand

[07:10] when George Gomez says we're going to have code updates every two weeks and that was 180 days

[07:17] ago or whatever it was. That's never should have been spoken. With Zach Sharp on board and this

[07:24] new way to communicate and new way to talk to their customers, I really hope stern can figure

[07:31] out a way to at least tell people what you're working on. Tell us what share some video of Lyman's

[07:36] one of his new modes that's not quite ready yet, but let's show you what's coming. Do something to

[07:42] keep people excited. I think you have a large group of people who bought Batman who are just

[07:48] really frustrated. If you're a stern and you're the financial guy, do you even care? You sold all

[07:53] your Batman's. The money's in the bank. You're selling Star Wars. You're selling Aerosmith and you're

[07:59] moving on to Guardians of the Galaxy at Expo. Who cares? You've got the money. Again, that's the

[08:05] problem. That's the problem. You gave them the money. Speaking of stern communication, I want to

[08:11] say that I am extremely happy to see Zach Sharp's response to the John Trudeau arrest. I think stern

[08:19] took a little bit longer than I would have liked, but you know what? No harm, no foul. They came out.

[08:25] They had a remark that basically said how disappointed and upset they are and they will not tolerate this.

[08:33] They also are donating money to an organization that raises money to fight the human trafficking

[08:41] issues that plague the world. I think that is a really amazing move on Stern's part. I think

[08:46] universally everyone is glad to see Stern responding in such a manner. I will also tell you,

[08:53] gentlemen out there who are listening to this podcast, all 800 to 1,000 of you that get excitement

[09:00] by this podcast. You guys probably need some mental help because yeah, it's a pinball podcast. But

[09:06] anyway, so here's something that's that is going to happen or not going to happen. You are not

[09:11] going to see John Trudeau's name on another Stern pinball machine moving forward. So for those of

[09:17] you out there who are worried they were going to, they were too far along with his next title.

[09:24] The team of people working on the game will refuse to launch a game or release a game with John

[09:29] Trudeau's name on it or John Trudeau's signature on it. So you are not going to see a John Trudeau

[09:34] design game be the next game from from from Stern, okay? Or any game from Stern moving forward. So

[09:42] and by that, I don't mean they're just going to take his name off and that was his design and we're

[09:46] all going to see his design. I believe they're going to redesign the game he worked on. And you know,

[09:53] as much as Stern is profit driven, they know and everyone out there knows that it's just the right

[09:58] thing to do and every once in a while a company will experience a crisis and it has to pivot and

[10:03] I think Stern is pivoting properly here. So I give them kudos as well. Okay, what else is going on

[10:11] in the pinball world? So I, you know, here's the thing. I have some news of my own and I've been

[10:15] talking so much about this game and how excited I was to get it and a lot's been going on in my life

[10:22] and I know like a lot of you. It's really hard. It's really hard sometimes when you have other factors

[10:28] going on in your life, other expenses, other priorities and even just your own taste might change,

[10:35] right? Your enthusiasm might change for where to spend your money. I have some news and I want to

[10:41] explain why I'm doing this. So I have decided to back out of getting dialed in collector's edition.

[10:49] Now the way I want to talk about this, I want to give you the the real reason why I'm doing this.

[10:55] And first and foremost, it's not about the money. Okay, not 100% about the money. It's a little bit

[11:02] about the money in this sense. I'm spending a lot, a lot of money this year. The most money I will

[11:09] ever have spent in one year is this year between a renovation, between a new car, between vacations,

[11:19] between Brendan and I getting obsessed with dressing better because it's not cheap.

[11:24] It's not cheap when you want to look this damn fly. That's right guys. I got to testify. Anyway,

[11:29] it's not cheap. Other stuff that I've planned for this year. So a lot of money going out and

[11:36] not as much money coming in. So when I look at pinball purchases, well I could easily go get it.

[11:42] I'm just wondering if it's the right way to spend my money. Okay, but it's not the money really.

[11:47] The main issue I sort of said, you know what? Let me just wait. I'm going to wait and see

[11:53] what to get next. I think the main issue is this. I think dialed-in is an amazing pinball machine.

[11:59] I really do. I think it's one of the greatest pinball machines to come out since I've been

[12:04] following this hobby. I think it's probably the greatest value pinball machine you can get for

[12:10] your money right now. Considering where prices are at, I think if you put a dialed-in next to a

[12:15] Star Wars le, it's a joke. I think if you put a dialed-in next to an attack from Mars remake,

[12:21] I still think dialed-in is the better buy. So I think it's an amazing pinball machine.

[12:26] Everyone I know who has one absolutely loves it. I'll say this though. As much as I love it,

[12:32] I still, there's like something, there's like one little thing missing between me loving it

[12:38] as a pinball machine and being infactuated with it as a gameplay experience. And you know, I just,

[12:44] I want to, I want to emotionally be pulled into the game a little bit more than I currently am.

[12:50] And I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's because destroying the ring at Mordor or,

[12:56] or putting the Joker in prison or, you know, getting, getting the Guardians of the Galaxy

[13:04] to their ultimate quest. Like those kinds of things emotionally will pull me into a game or

[13:10] then collecting SIM cards and saving Quantum City. Now that being said, it's not like I don't

[13:16] enjoy playing the machine. I actually, I really do enjoy playing the machine. And I think dialed-in

[13:20] is created a little bit of that dilemma for people where you can love the pinball so much,

[13:26] but the theme in what you're doing is hard to fall utterly in love with because we don't come to it

[13:33] with a, with, with an emotional background of the theme. And then that's the advantage Stern has

[13:39] with these themes that we bring so much of ourselves to the game itself. So there was that part of it.

[13:46] Then there was the part of it's a $12,500 machine. And the collector's edition out of all the,

[13:53] sort of, more expensive premium versions of a machine. So dialed-in is in $8,000 machine at standard

[14:04] cost. It's a $9,000 machine at LE cost and it's a $12,500 collector's edition cost. So that's

[14:13] what $3,500 more than an LE. Now if you look at the matrix of what you get in the collector's

[14:22] edition, you get purple trim, different back box art, a topper, and then there's stuff like lunch

[14:30] with Pat Lawler, a jacket, some other, I think there's a plaque with, you know, John, Yosey,

[14:38] Pat Lawler, and Jersey Jack sign it. You know, so there's some things in there. But man, you can't

[14:43] find $3,500 in value, right? So there's the other part of the value has to come down to the fact that

[14:51] they're only making $150, which is not a lot. So you could argue that, well, that's, that's why

[14:57] you're spending that extra money. But here's the thing, as I, as I thought about it,

[15:02] and I thought about it like this. Look at the difference in what you get from Batman 66 LE

[15:10] to Batman 66 Super LE. And I know that was a $5,000 difference. But even if you look at the

[15:15] difference you get in Star Wars LE from Star Wars premium, here's the thing. Whenever you make that

[15:22] jump from an LE over a premium or that, you know, I see the jump from a LE dialed in to a collector's

[15:30] additions should be a similar jump. And so what I think is missing is this for me because I really

[15:35] want it to be like fully unique collector's addition. I think it probably should have had

[15:41] different cabinet artwork. I think the entire cabinet artwork should have been different. You should

[15:45] look at it as a collector's addition. And even from a distance, it should look like a completely

[15:52] special game. I think it should have a topper because I think the topper is just flat. I mean,

[15:57] look at the topper you get with Attack from Mars LE, the remake LE. That topper is incredible.

[16:03] That comes included. It's not even extra. And that game is only $8,000. So dialed in is $4,500

[16:11] more. Think about that. Dialed in collector's addition is $4,500 more than Attack from Mars remake LE.

[16:20] That's almost the price of a Star Wars pro and an Attack from Mars remake LE. So I start doing

[16:26] this math in my head. And I start to realize I'm not quite sure it's all there for the money.

[16:34] Other things like it should have mirror blades. It should have every single thing that makes it feel

[16:40] ultimately special. And when I looked at the purple armor too, they just put a photo up on Facebook.

[16:46] It's very dark. It's a very dark purple. It's almost like a like a black purple. I was expecting more

[16:52] of like a purple that would pop. So I just couldn't justify the cost. And I also, my big concern was

[17:02] this. My big concern is I think if you go in on dialed in collector's addition right now and you

[17:07] spend $12,500. I get it. It's not supposed to be an investment. I think that pin cells for

[17:15] $9,500, $9,000 in a year. I just do. There's so many beautiful dialed in LEs that will be out there.

[17:23] Jack is backordered on them. I mean, I'm so glad to see he's selling so many of them. But all of that

[17:29] will chip away at what the collector's addition will be worth. And it's so hard. There's no

[17:34] effort to go north. Like it's never going to be worth more than $12,500. In my mind, the collector's

[17:39] addition with what you get should be maybe $1,000 more than the LE. So $10,000 would have made me

[17:46] feel better about it. But $12,500, I'm out. And I'm also out because I just they asked me to pay

[17:55] and fall before I could see it. And part of me just is over that. I'm so tired of this approach of

[18:03] you're going to take my money before I know what I'm getting. And I get that you had the design

[18:09] matrix laid out. But look what happened to Alien LE buyers who paid and fall before they saw

[18:14] what the fall LE package was. Now they don't even know what the LE package is going to be. Now they

[18:19] are going to get screwed. Their money is locked in with the company that has now changed the

[18:24] feature matrix on them. That's not happening at JJP. So and I'll say this. My last point is

[18:32] the collector's addition for dialed in is targeting just one person and one person only.

[18:37] It's targeting the person who is absolutely in love and infactuated with Pat Lawler games.

[18:46] That is who this machine is targeting. It is the person who has waited years and years and

[18:51] years for a new Pat Lawler machine. Now it's available and they want to have lunch with Pat Lawler.

[18:58] I think there's a bunch of those people out there. Do I think they're going to legitimately sell

[19:06] all $150 at this price? I don't think they got $150 orders. I think distributors have ordered them.

[19:12] You'll still be available. That's the other part. I was like just wait. Just wait. If you want it

[19:19] six months from now, I guarantee you I will be able to find a dialed in collector's addition that's

[19:24] still in a box six months from now. That's my ultimate learning and that's my ultimate feeling

[19:29] lately in the hobby. I know this is not so much of a news podcast. It's just my thoughts on the hobby

[19:35] and what I feel is going on. The other part I feel is going on is now is the time to just wait.

[19:42] Now is the time to wait and hold on to your money and see what's coming down the line.

[19:47] What have been my frustration has been this? I pretty much know that Guardians of the Galaxy

[19:53] will probably be the next Stern Pimball machine that will be shown at Expo this year. We don't

[19:59] have to take a huge leap of faith to guess that. Stern has not done a great job of controlling the

[20:06] titles that are coming out next. Guardians of the Galaxy Iron Maiden. There's another

[20:11] Compound title that will probably come out because they already said that. They're remaking ACDC.

[20:18] My problem with Pimball is this and this is just something that I'm having a hard time with.

[20:22] I talk to a lot of my friends about this and I love when I talk to Greg Mr. Rare here about this.

[20:29] Here's the issue I have. Pimball is a toy. Pimball is a game. It's an entertainment game that we

[20:35] want to buy so we can experience a new game. It's a game. In every other area of entertainment,

[20:41] you know what games are coming out a year from now, two years from now. If you want to go buy a

[20:47] video game, the list of video games that are going to be coming out are it's already determined.

[20:52] Like I know when the new Red Dead Redemption is coming out, I know when the new Fallout is,

[20:57] I know when the new like Grand Theft Auto is being worked on. It's not like I'm not going to buy a

[21:02] game today because there's a new game tomorrow that is also a game I want. Now the reason they can

[21:07] do that is because it's 60 bucks, right? Same thing with movies. I know what movies are coming out

[21:14] for a really long time. The problem with Pimball and the fact that it's a game is they launch Pimball

[21:19] machines like automakers launch cars where they don't tell you what the next model is or what the

[21:27] because they want you to buy what's here and available today in the showroom, right?

[21:32] So I don't, if I'm going to go buy a Dodge Demon, I don't know if they're working on a

[21:37] thousand horsepower Dodge Angel that's going to come out next year that's going to make me save my

[21:42] money. So that's what we're all up against is this whole I only know what's available today and

[21:49] I have to decide with my money today. But the problem is this is I just think that it's a losing

[21:56] it's a losing way to chase Pimball machines. I think the new inbox chasers are all like kind of

[22:04] getting raked over the calls and I don't think it's a satisfying endeavor. It's not satisfying for me.

[22:11] It might the only people who I think can actually play the game the way that Pimball new

[22:17] inbox game is played are super rich people. I think super rich people can go buy

[22:23] $6,000, $8,000, $9,000 machines without a problem. I think to them it means nothing. They could buy

[22:32] 10 machines and spend $100,000 on Pimball and it means nothing and because they're rich and I

[22:40] love rich people and I would love to be in that place one day where I can just spend $100,000

[22:46] on Pimball machines in a year and not have to think about it. Now I don't think the majority of

[22:51] people who collect Pimball machines are that wealthy. I think a lot of people are addicted to getting

[22:58] new pins and want to experience that new pin feeling and for many people out there they don't have

[23:03] access to Pimball machines on location close by so the only way they can really fully experience

[23:09] Star Wars LE intimately is the buy one. It creates this environment though where you buy your

[23:16] machine, you sink your $8,000, your $6,000 in new machine and by the time it's done and by the time

[23:23] you might be happy with it the hype is passed and everyone's already talking about the next game.

[23:29] Take Star Wars case in point. Take the Star Wars threads. Hundreds of pages, a few hundred pages

[23:35] talking about Star Wars before Star Wars even comes out. Now that Star Wars LE is inside people's

[23:41] homes. Look at the volume of conversation around it hardly any. It's like people don't care.

[23:46] It's all of the hype and all of the energy and all the frenzy takes place before the games ship.

[23:53] It's because you know why? Because Stern has done a great job creating a marketing landscape where

[23:58] the best Pimball machine ever is always the next Pimball machine. It's never the one that we're

[24:03] selling you today and they get you hyped up and they get you super excited. Remember Star Wars

[24:09] LE, Steve Richie, the King of Pimball. It's been in development for two years. It's going to be

[24:13] amazing. It's going to be everything. It's going to be this. It's going to be that and then there's

[24:16] a tie fighter on a spring. There's an uninspired layout. There's crappy code with complexities times

[24:25] 10 with stupid stacking and all this stuff. It's not the Star Wars Pimball machine anyone really

[24:30] want it. It comes out and you buy it and no one's talking about it because it makes me laugh so

[24:38] much when like Beasel Boob gets his machine. He's been defending it for so long. He gets it and then

[24:43] he has to openly admit that the game is just brutal. The game's not like shooting perfectly. I love it.

[24:49] He's like it's done. I have to dial it in. I say right now the game's at 80%. What is that mean?

[24:55] You get a new in box Star Wars. You spend like $8,500 on a machine and you have to now spend

[25:03] weeks trying to level it properly and get it to play right. No, maybe it's not playing right

[25:07] Beasel Boob and for those of you out there the reason why it's probably not playing perfectly

[25:13] is because Stern doesn't put their games on location and let people test it. I think most

[25:18] new Sterns come out with geometry issues with gameplay issues and the reason why is because

[25:25] they would rather keep it secret than to put the games on location for testing. They used to put

[25:31] games out on location for testing back in the 90s and get tons of feedback and make alterations

[25:37] before the games were finalized. They don't do that anymore. You know why they don't do that anymore

[25:41] because they're more concerned about creating that marketing hype bubble than they are about

[25:47] getting you the best possibly engineered game. You see that's the problem I have.

[25:54] So right now in September or is it September 1st, I'm thinking to myself, okay, Dildin is available.

[26:02] It's in boxes. Attack from Mars is available. It's in boxes. But why would I buy a game today?

[26:08] When I know that come October, mid-October, I am going to see Guardians of the Galaxy.

[26:14] And I'd rather have Guardians of the Galaxy as a theme if I'm honest than Dildin.

[26:20] But what sucks is I'd rather have J.J.P. quality and build and the premium materials they use versus

[26:28] Stern because at the end of the day, I always feel like a Stern is just going to be a Stern.

[26:33] I haven't seen them improve their materials that they use. I haven't seen the quality be where it

[26:40] should be for the money. But from what I'm hearing in terms of Guardians, I think it's going to be

[26:46] a home run. But again, I always hear that because that's what Stern does is they leak out hype.

[26:52] Right? Jared or the people or the people you talk to, everyone's got a friend at Stern.

[26:56] Anyone who collects at this level has a friend who has someone they know at Stern.

[27:01] And they're always hyping the game. It's going to be amazing. It's going to be this. It's going to

[27:04] be that. It's going to be incredible. It's going to be epic. You know, so by the time it comes out,

[27:09] they've got you so worked up that the next Stern's the best Stern. You know, no one's talking about

[27:13] Batman 66 gameplay. Nobody talks about playing that game. Nobody talks about playing Aerosmith.

[27:19] Nobody's even talking about playing Star Wars very much. And so that's who we are if we're a new,

[27:26] that's who you are. If you're a new inbox collector, you are more excited about the moment the box

[27:32] arrives. It's like creating that Christmas morning experience for you. And that's what you're chasing.

[27:39] Most of these guys who collect a new inbox pinball machines and I'm going to say it. I'm going to

[27:43] say it and you might disagree with me. They suck at pinball. They're not good at pinball. They

[27:50] literally just like to have the shiny new item in their house. These aren't like the best pinball

[27:55] players. The best pinball players I know, they think that the new inbox collectors are a bunch of

[28:01] morons who just keep wasting their money and aren't even good at the game that they're chasing

[28:07] after. So you know, because it's the that's the collector mentality. It's like people who would

[28:12] buy baseball cards and they just want that rare baseball car that no one else has. But I think

[28:17] I think we're at a point now where everyone should wait. I don't think Ellie's mean anything

[28:21] anymore. They're not rare. You know, it's a limited edition game is Magic Girl. There's 25 on the

[28:26] planet. Most of them are still in boxes. If you want to play a Magic Girl tomorrow in the world,

[28:31] there's probably only 10 that are actually set up in the world to play. And it plays. You can

[28:37] experience it. You can hear the music. You can hear the callouts. You can make you can score some

[28:41] stuff. Some stuff doesn't work. But you know what? That's why playing a Magic Girl is still more

[28:46] special than me. Owning a Magic Girl is more special to me than owning one of 800 Star Wars

[28:52] L.E. So I'm waiting. I'm waiting to see what Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be at Expo.

[28:57] I'm waiting to see if Jersey Jack shows pin number four at Expo. I don't think they will because

[29:02] dialed in is selling well. There's no way Jack is going to you know, move dollars or make people

[29:08] wait for the next J.J.P. I think Jack's always got buyers. I do. I think Jack always has a following

[29:16] and always has people waiting to buy the next Jersey Jack machine because Jersey Jack machines

[29:20] are phenomenally built now. They've gotten past some of the old issues. But dollars to dollars,

[29:28] apples to apples, their machines look much better than anything else on the market. I think

[29:33] Attack from Mars Remake is a great buy. I think people who are buying that are having a great

[29:38] time with it and don't have to justify spending that much on that machine. I'm so happy to see

[29:44] what came with that package. I have absolutely no interest in Thunderbirds at all. I think Houdini

[29:51] is an interesting theme at the price. I think my question with them is Ken American Pimbo actually

[29:57] produced the game. Do they have the chops and the ability to set up an assembly line and

[30:03] something they've never done before? I remember Magic Girl was built like in the back room with

[30:07] John and a couple of guys hand-screwing the thing together. This wasn't an assembly line project.

[30:14] P3, I don't know, you know, can't really take 25 games, 25 games here, 25 games there.

[30:21] It's not putting a dent into the market. But it's available and I'm happy to see Jerry's

[30:25] game shipping. I don't think the Big Lebowski will be at Expo. Dutch Pimbo is not going to get

[30:32] their shit together by October. There's no way that's going to happen. But keep dreaming people.

[30:38] The only way you can experience the Big Lebowski Pimbo in 2018 is if you go to bed and dream about it,

[30:43] you ain't going to physically feel nothing when you're up. Sorry, Barry, the op. I got to keep

[30:47] digging at you guys. I got to. You guys should not go to Expo. You should say we listen to

[30:52] Canada's Pimbo podcast and we realize that spending money on a trip to Expo was stupid and we're

[30:57] going to use that money to re-engineer the boards and get you your games. Nobody wants to hear you

[31:02] with Mike in hand, dude. Nobody. Show of hands in America, people who want to hear Barry and Yop talk

[31:08] on the microphone at Chicago Expo 2017. It's ego. It's ego that drives these guys to think that

[31:16] they need to have a seminar again, that we need to hear their explanations again. They can communicate

[31:22] everything that they need to communicate via an email or newsletter or YouTube video. Save

[31:28] your spending your customers money. I can't go off on these guys enough. You're spending your

[31:32] customers money to go to Chicago. What the hell's wrong with you guys? Were you like born yesterday?

[31:38] Talk to Bill Brandness about how to run a business. He knows and give him his money back while

[31:43] you're at it. Either give Bill his money back or give him his game. But don't spend Bill's money

[31:47] to fly over to talk to us about all your excuses. I'm tired of these guys. Or come on the show,

[31:54] explain yourself, but do something. But don't spend money. Engineer the game, put it in a box.

[32:00] You know, alien elite, these guys. Who knows what's going on? His coin takeer is going to get these

[32:04] games. Who knows? But I'll say this. I'm just waiting. I'm on the sidelines. Canators dialed out.

[32:09] I've dialed out. I'm spending money on pinball for a while. I'm going to see what happens. I think

[32:14] the next six months is the greatest six months to wait and see what happens. I think between now

[32:19] and Texas pinball festival, it makes sense for everyone to hold onto their money and just see what

[32:24] comes out. See what comes out. If you really have the desire to go play one of these new machines and

[32:30] go find a friend you have one, go on location. I saw that Star Wars LE is inside Blooming Dales.

[32:37] So it was dialed in. Pinball Owl has put machines inside the Blooming Dales men's section. So I'm

[32:43] going to just go to Blooming Dales today and play Star Wars LE. And then you know what I'm going to do?

[32:47] I'm going to go to the bathroom for like 20 minutes and think about it. How I didn't have to spend

[32:53] $9,000 on the machine. Brenda's like, that's the worst joke ever. She's like, you're reaching and

[32:58] she's right. I'm out. I'm out of material. 33 minutes and five seconds into this podcast. It's over.

[33:05] Have a great weekend everyone. Enjoy your pinball but hold onto your money and wait. Wait,

[33:10] unless you absolutely love the game and have played it, I would wait. Have an awesome weekend.

[33:17] 156 out.
