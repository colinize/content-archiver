[00:00] I've got a lonely Starbucks lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane, but I've got a blank space baby, and I'll write you next.

[00:10] Oh, we're just three days away from Texas Pimball Festival. Can you feel it? Can you feel the energy?

[00:23] We're gonna see Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle. I saw Charlie had it backstage at an Alice Cooper concert yesterday.

[00:31] We're gonna see not much else new, that's it. But anyway, we're excited. We're excited for Texas Pimball Festival.

[00:39] I'm so excited that Blake Dumas-Nill joined the show. Blake did all the amazing artwork for Texas Pimball Festival.

[00:47] The graphic designer artist works on all this amazing stuff with NASA, lent his artistic skills to Domino's Pimball.

[00:57] But all around, great, great Pimball fanatic. And we interviewed Blake on episode 215 of Canatus Pimball Podcast.

[01:05] And because there is no news, we're gonna air that interview right now.

[01:09] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canatus Pimball Podcast. One of my favorite guests, Blake Dumas-Nill from Texas, artist, graphic designer, good friend of the show.

[01:22] Blake, was it me announcing on my last episode that you had to come on that made you come back on the show?

[01:29] Yeah, sure. We've been playing this for a little while, but yeah, that helped convince me a little bit.

[01:37] So that should be my new strategy. So ladies and gentlemen, on my next podcast will be Mr. Steve Richie. No, I'm making that up. He's not gonna be on.

[01:46] But maybe I should do that. I should just announce people are gonna be the guests and then they magically appear. But Blake, I'm excited to have you on the show.

[01:53] I know both of us are excited for Texas Pimball Festival that is happening this coming week. And I want to just, let's talk about the show and what we think is gonna happen at this humongous Pimball event.

[02:07] Sounds good.

[02:08] All right. Now, Blake, you are connected to this show. And before we start talking about the different manufacturers and what we think is gonna happen, I want to talk about the artwork for this year's Texas Pimball Festival because you, my friend, provided, right?

[02:23] The artwork and the logo, right, for the show itself?

[02:27] Yeah, yeah, it's been, I've kind of been the art director for the show this year after I worked with Ed and Kim on the kind of official logo for the show last year.

[02:39] You know, they got back in touch with me pretty early on right after the show last year and said, hey, you know, we'd, we'd be interested in working with you on our marketing materials and, you know, fleshing out a theme for next year.

[02:54] And I told them sure. So we got to talking and one thing led to another and we came up with this idea to use Cosmic Chaos, which was a concept by Mark Richie and Ed to kind of run with that and flush it out more for the show.

[03:11] So that's kind of how it came to fruition.

[03:14] All right, so I want to talk about that because I've heard rumors and you can say I can't comment that this Cosmic Chaos theme might actually be a Pimball machine in development.

[03:30] Is there any truth to that Blake?

[03:34] I think it's not actively in development, but I will say that I think there's some interest in possibly making it a real machine.

[03:43] You know, we, when I went into this working with Mark on kind of coming up with more ideas to build the artwork around for the show.

[03:55] We talked about, you know, a storyline for the game and what types of toys might be on it, what types of little gimmicks here and there.

[04:03] And so everything that we've done as far as marketing the show and the merchandise around this theme, we've done it with the idea that it could be a game, you know, that it could be a real theme that could be turned into a game.

[04:19] I think that I know Mark has some ideas as to what he would put in the game.

[04:27] But I think there's also a little bit of conflict of interest with his employer as far as really being able to flesh it out for some other manufacturer to make.

[04:39] But, but yeah, I mean, I think that there is interest in taking this a step further and I'm very curious to see, you know, how people react to the stuff that they're going to see this weekend.

[04:52] You know, not just in the t-shirts and all that stuff, but, you know, we're going to have cosmic chaos kind of front and center and it's going to be.

[05:01] It should be a really neat theme integration for the show itself.

[05:06] But where's Mark right now in terms of employment?

[05:09] So he is with raw thrills slash play mechanics.

[05:14] I'm not sure, I'm not really sure if play mechanics is owned by raw thrills or if they're like a subsidy area or what, but basically he's associated with raw thrills and he's been doing a lot of work over the years on games like Big Buck Hunter and stuff.

[05:30] Is one of the sharps over there? Am I just making that up?

[05:34] So, I believe Josh Sharp is over at raw thrills and Zach Sharp is who is with Stern now.

[05:44] Right, right, because I think I hear Josh and interview is talking about making stuff like new crews in USA games and I believe it's raw thrills who puts out some of the more elaborate new arcade machines that actually make their way out into the world.

[05:58] So that's pretty cool stuff.

[06:01] All right, so Blake, you're also working on and nobody knows this yet.

[06:07] Another piece of artwork that would be unveiled at the Texas Pinball Festival.

[06:13] I myself have commissioned Blake to make the official advertisement for a Canadian Pinball podcast that all of you will see in the show brochure.

[06:25] And I have to say Blake, I've seen it and you blew me away.

[06:30] I've done these ads myself, Brendan, myself have done them before.

[06:35] And even Brendan this year got a little upset because she wanted to make the ad with me and I'm like, well, here's what Blake created and it's amazing.

[06:44] And I think people out there are going to be pleasantly surprised.

[06:47] Now Blake, you've been working with Ed and Kim on the brochure for Texas Pinball Festival, right?

[06:52] And you said that my ad features somewhere up front in that brochure.

[06:57] Yeah, I've seen the whole program.

[06:59] It is the largest program that they've produced for T.P.F. today.

[07:04] I think there's like 56 pages or something like that to it.

[07:08] Wow.

[07:09] Yeah, it's going to be a really great document.

[07:12] I think that's also a testament to how many vendors and manufacturers and distributors are all realizing how big of a deal the show is and they're all getting their ads in there.

[07:23] But yeah, you got some really good real estate.

[07:26] I think you're within the first like 10 pages of the program.

[07:30] There we go.

[07:32] And it pays to know people.

[07:34] It pays to know people in this world.

[07:36] And I'm super excited.

[07:38] I mean, for those of you who haven't been the Texas Pinball Festival, it's one of the best shows.

[07:44] And Kim and Ed, they throw such a great show and there's so many awesome people there.

[07:49] And it's one of these shows where it has everything you need.

[07:53] It's got all the games you want to play.

[07:55] It's got a great tournament.

[07:57] And it's big.

[07:58] And sometimes we go to shows and there's not as much going on in the free play room.

[08:02] But I think Texas, much like the state itself, does everything bigger and better.

[08:09] And this is a big year for Texas Pinball Festival.

[08:12] And Blake, let's talk about who we think the big winners and possibly losers and even talk about some of the no shows and the impact we think that's going to have on this show.

[08:22] How does that sound?

[08:23] That sounds great.

[08:24] So up to a few weeks ago, we were expecting all the big players to come to Texas Pinball Festival.

[08:31] And I think we got some shocking news.

[08:33] And I know Ed was kind of bummed out when we learned that Stern was not going to be coming to Texas Pinball Festival with Iron Maiden, which is probably the worst kept secret in Pinball.

[08:47] What were your thoughts, Blake, when you heard that Stern wasn't going to come with anything new?

[08:52] I was surprised to be honest with you.

[08:55] Mainly because they skipped Expo this past year and didn't show anything.

[09:01] I mean, I think Guardians was revealed only maybe three weeks later after Expo.

[09:05] And okay, I understand they didn't want to show it with the lackluster code and all that stuff.

[09:12] I think that I think it's also kind of a testament to maybe Stern still feeling like they're very confident in their products.

[09:21] And that they're still the largest manufacturer and that they don't need to rely on these shows to give a sneak preview.

[09:28] However, with that said, I personally was very disappointed that they're not going to have a new game.

[09:35] And I'm also feeling like it's kind of a mistake.

[09:40] You know, you've mentioned on your show a few times recently that there are a lot of the players providing games nowadays.

[09:49] There are a lot of options for buyers.

[09:51] And even though the Pinball hobby is grown, there are still only so many buyers to go around for how expensive some of these games are.

[09:58] And to not give people a chance to try these games out or at least at the very least see the game.

[10:06] That might make people want to hold on to their money a little bit longer, even if they saw a game that they really were impressed with and they liked.

[10:15] So I expect Iron Maiden to have a beautiful art package if if Zombie Eddie truly is the one doing the artwork on it.

[10:24] And I think it's probably going to be a great looking game that people are going to want to set their money aside.

[10:29] But I mean, come on, Texas is a huge show.

[10:32] There are more people probably traveling from all over the world to this show this year than ever before.

[10:38] And it would have been a great opportunity to let people see that.

[10:44] Yeah, I think there was a collective sort of disappointment that sort of permeated through the Pinball universe when we learn this because I just don't think Stern cares about these shows anymore.

[10:59] I mean, it's hard. I mean, it's not that they're not going to show up because we know they'll be there.

[11:04] They'll be there with their games that are currently on the line, stuff like Batman and Star Wars.

[11:11] What am I missing?

[11:12] It's Guardians of the Galaxy Ghostbusters.

[11:15] You know, they'll show us what we can order today.

[11:18] They'll probably have an ACDC Lucy there and all that stuff.

[11:22] But I agree.

[11:23] I think that it's a missed opportunity.

[11:26] And I do also agree that the competition is heating up.

[11:31] People are going to want to buy games that they can play.

[11:35] And I think Stern has had the luxury of selling so many games to people sight unseen.

[11:42] And nowadays, I really do think people are going to want to get more hands on time with these games.

[11:47] And even if people can't make it to shows like T-P-F, I think the feedback from the shows about how the game played and what the experience was like is stuff that people are looking for before they rush in and buy.

[12:02] I could be completely wrong because they could just announce Iron Manin and X amount of L.E.s and they could sell out overnight.

[12:10] You never know with Stern.

[12:11] It's kind of how to miss on how successful these games are.

[12:15] But we sure know that showing up at the big shows seems to be not their priority when it comes to marketing these games.

[12:25] Yeah, I mean, I am disappointed that what we're going to see.

[12:31] And I've heard that, you know, Marco is going to have a larger booth than they've ever had that there's going to be 15 plus games in their booth this year, all of which will be Stern's, I imagine.

[12:44] So you're looking at roughly at least about three games per title.

[12:51] But everything that we're looking at, we've been playing on now for the last, you know, anywhere from four to four months to a year or more.

[13:02] I mean, yeah, I mean, there's new code and all this stuff, but really personally, I feel like and I'm lucky I'm in a big city.

[13:09] I have access to a lot of the new machines as soon as they come out.

[13:12] But I was ready to see something new and I think a lot of people are I think Guardians has kind of it hasn't really gone over that great with a lot of people.

[13:22] I know that my distributor here in Houston has not sold a single pro model Guardians of the galaxy.

[13:29] He's sold a few of the LEDs that he has still has a few LEDs, but has not sold a single pro model.

[13:37] And I don't think Guardians is a bad game, but I just don't think that it lit a lot of people up in terms of there being a whole lot of innovation or anything to it.

[13:46] Right. No, I mean, I agree. I mean, I think a lot of people saw that game and it reminded them very much of just a combination of Metallica and Iron Man.

[13:56] Nothing sort of like completely new in the design department.

[14:00] The artwork was nice. Christopher Franci always delivers.

[14:04] Definitely, but the game was it was another one of these like, are you really kidding us?

[14:09] You're going to ship this game with this code.

[14:12] And look, I know there's a lot of debate about this, but Stern was not going to put music into this game.

[14:18] They heard the feedback initially and ponied up some more dollars to throw some songs in.

[14:24] But even though they got the music, it's just not integrated. That game to me feels like it's still just sort of like they're building the ship in the ocean.

[14:33] Like they didn't really have it ready to go.

[14:36] And I think John Trudeau's departure really created a ripple effect through Stern Pimball and things got moved around.

[14:45] And Guardians feels like a rush job to me.

[14:48] Yeah, I mean, I think in the long run, I expect the code will probably be fleshed out in that game a year from now.

[14:57] I think it'll probably be a fun game. I don't think it shoots that badly.

[15:00] And I do think it's got some interesting shots.

[15:05] But at the same time, it's also a good example of taking a really good theme overall, in my opinion, between the characters and the music and all that stuff,

[15:16] as well as the art direction from the films.

[15:19] But it still doesn't quite feel like it was brought to its fullest potential on a pinball machine with the lack of some video and especially the callouts, even from the movies.

[15:33] But the movable, yeah. I mean, that sort of became the narrative of the movable, right?

[15:38] Like, you really don't want, you almost don't want people to focus on what's missing in the game when the game is launched.

[15:46] You want people to be excited about what's in the game.

[15:49] And that was the main thing for me was like all the feedback was about what people wished the game had.

[15:56] Nobody was like, oh my god, I'm so happy with what I'm getting.

[16:01] And I think the other big thing that was missing from that game for me was it didn't have the second movie in it.

[16:08] And it just felt really like that's like an incomplete way to bring out this franchise, especially when the second movie was just in theaters and people loved it.

[16:18] And it just felt like a half baked version of the franchise.

[16:23] So Stern is not going to be there. And the other major player Blake that we heard who pulled out was Chicago Gaming Company.

[16:32] And we still don't know what game number three is, but what kind of impact do you think Chicago Gaming not showing up is going to have in the industry or at the show?

[16:42] Their announcement that they weren't going to show up was probably an even bigger surprise to me than Stern not showing a new game, honestly.

[16:50] Especially because they had come out and said, hey, we're going to be showing our third game at T. P. F this year.

[16:57] And I don't know if it has much to do with their confidence and how well attack from Mars has done because it has done very well.

[17:07] I know the people that about that game have been extremely happy with it and it has been selling well.

[17:12] They got a great price point on it too.

[17:15] But I still think that this would have been a great opportunity just like they made a really big splash at T. P. F last year with attack from Mars.

[17:24] This would have been a great opportunity to kind of follow that up and said, hey, we really are we're in this for the long haul.

[17:30] We are really, I don't want to say reinventing these games, but we're certainly reinvigorating them and bringing them back out to the forefront and showing just how amazing the design and creativity was for games that are already, you know, 20 plus years old.

[17:46] So it's a shame that they're missing for sure.

[17:51] I don't doubt that whatever reason they decided not to show the game was probably a good one.

[17:57] I'm sure they don't want to show something that's incomplete or something that people are going to criticize heavily.

[18:02] But I really hope that whatever changes and adjustments they're making that they're going to make it count.

[18:07] Right.

[18:08] It's a little strange, right, because nothing they're going to show us for the most part hasn't been seen before because it's a remake.

[18:18] And we know their approach, right.

[18:20] It's to improve upon the display of the game, put a nicer topper up there, slap some colorful armor on it and call it a day.

[18:30] But they're feedback on why they're delaying this game has led to a lot of speculation in that they're doing more to improve upon the game that they're remaking.

[18:43] And so that's led people to speculate that it's not monster bash, which is a pretty fully flushed out game that it might actually be either Big Bang Bar or cactus Canyon, which were two games that really needed more improved code from what made it out into the world back in the day.

[18:59] What's your guess, Blake, on what game three is? I mean, it's anybody's guess. I feel like at this point.

[19:06] Yeah, I, you know, initially when they when they first started talking about game three, my gut was that it was going to be cactus Canyon.

[19:15] I felt like that was the one that naturally was kind of next in line because they just didn't make nearly as many of those games.

[19:22] And I felt like the demand would be there. If they took the time to polish the game out more.

[19:30] I've played cactus Canyon. I've played both the continued version and the normal version. And I got to say, even with what's there, it's a great game.

[19:38] It's a lot of fun. The shots are fantastic on it. So I think that that will be a really successful game for them when they get to it.

[19:45] But you know, then then all the rumors started weighing more in favor of monster bash. And so I kind of felt like, okay, well, obviously that's there more and more people talking about it.

[19:55] I guess that's what's coming down the pipeline. But as far as Big Bang Bar goes.

[20:03] I don't know. My gut tells me that that's not the next game. I don't really have a reason why I feel that way. I just I just think that they're probably going to get another one of these

[20:14] Valley Williams games out of the way before they dive into the Capcom ones like Big Bang Bar.

[20:20] I'll say this. It was a genius move what they did. The more I think about it, it was a genius move on their part to list all the potential games they're going to remake at once.

[20:32] At first, I was like, what are they doing? They're spoiling it. But here's why it was such a smart move on their part.

[20:38] Because nobody is going to go buy a monster bash, a Big Bang Bar, a cactus canyon, a circus Voltaire or a theater of magic. Nobody is going to pay top dollar and want to buy a second hand game right now. They're going to wait.

[20:55] They're going to wait in the money is going to go to Chicago gaming company because they're going to make it. And we know that they're going to enhance the games. I mean, attack from Mars remake.

[21:05] I know they're having some issues with some people's machines here and there, but for the most part, you can't deny that the improvements they're making to those games are delivering a nicer package than the original.

[21:20] That's that's my opinion.

[21:22] No, no, you're absolutely right. And I feel the same way. I've got a, I've got to kind of eat crow here and say that, you know, a year ago, the week that we were leading into, into T.P.F.

[21:35] I really didn't care at all about attack from Mars being unveiled. It didn't, it really didn't excite me. There wasn't anything to it that I really looked forward to seeing at the show.

[21:47] But man, when that weekend rolled around and we saw that game for the first time and played it, I was amazed at how nice of a job they did just, you know, adding little details here and there that really stepped the game up tremendously.

[22:01] And the wider LCD display looked fantastic in it. And it made me feel the absolute opposite way this year going in the T.P.F.

[22:12] And their third game was one of the most anticipated games that I was looking forward to seeing at the show this year. And, and that was a testament to how great of a job I feel like they did on attack from Mars.

[22:25] So now moving forward, I mean, I, I feel like they're in this to stay and I certainly am interested to see what they're going to do. That's, that's why it's all the more disappointing that they're not going to have a game there this weekend.

[22:36] Right, right. Well, and I think for them, I know they want it to be there. I mean, they're not, their approach is not like Stern. I mean, I think these guys, they are selling machines to people who are very familiar with the classical pinball machines.

[22:53] Where I think Stern is trying to sell machines, not just to pinball enthusiasts, but to a broader audience. And when you license a theme like Iron Maiden or Star Wars or Ghost Busters, you know, you're trying to reach that broader audience.

[23:07] But unless you're a pinball nerd, like nobody knows what monster bash is. Nobody knows what you know, Big Bang Bar is. But people know a licensed theme is.

[23:16] So I, I feel like they would only delay if they weren't ready to show something that was truly special about this game. And I think it just begs the question, what's the next place they could possibly unveil it? Is there a show coming up after TPF anywhere that would be big enough for these guys or would they just put out a video or something?

[23:39] Well, correct me from wrong because I know you go to the show, but isn't Alan town like in April and then isn't Midwest gaming classic in either April or May?

[23:49] Let's see, Alan. What is it called? Alan. I've always just known it as Alan town, but if it has a real name, I don't know.

[23:58] I'm googling it right now while we talk about this. So pinfest is Alan town.

[24:04] Um, pinfest 2018. Let's see. I don't think it's that early. I always remember driving there with Ted and it's never that nice out.

[24:15] Pinfest, Alan town.

[24:18] Um, I think it's in July to be honest. Let me see.

[24:25] Oh, okay. Well, then in that case, I would say that Midwest game classic would be.

[24:30] It's in, it's in May. So it looks like it's May 4th and May 5th this year.

[24:35] That would be probably the next best opportunity.

[24:38] So March. Okay. Well, it's not too far away, but I guess you know, when they're, I think when they're ready to make the game, they'll unveil it.

[24:47] And again, I think as much as people want to jump on these machines and Texas is such a good place.

[24:53] I mean, that's the reason why I think we get bummed out when nothing's there because.

[24:57] And this has sort of become my new point of view is people want to play these things and you know, the remakes, we've all played them.

[25:05] We've played the originals probably many, many times.

[25:08] But we do want to get the feel for what these remakes are like.

[25:13] So, okay. So those two guys are not going to be there. Let's talk about the people that will be there.

[25:19] Okay. So we know and I'm just going to list them. The big players that are coming will be spooky pinball will be Jersey Jack pinball will be American pinball.

[25:29] I think if there's like, you know, those are the three, right? I mean, those are going to be the three big ones.

[25:37] So those are the three big ones and you know, then there are multi more.

[25:41] One or two smaller ones. Then yeah, you've got multi morphic which they'll be doing. They'll be showing cosmic heart racing and then the circus Maximus guys will be unveiling kingpin, which has been kind of hush, hush up to this point.

[25:55] Really.

[25:56] All right. So let's do this. Let's let's work our way up to the top three because I think that'll be a fun way to do this.

[26:03] So let's talk about is it circus Maximus guys who are unveiling kingpin.

[26:09] I think so. Yeah. Okay. So I brought these guys up on my last show and they were supposed to be making Python, Angela's pinball circus.

[26:19] A few years ago, they announced they were making like 12 prototypes. No clue where those games are. I think those guys took a break for like a year and a half.

[26:29] And now we are hearing that they are going to remake probably one of the most expensive rare games of all time kingpin.

[26:39] And we have a photo they put up of them working on the game in like a garage with looks like a messy garage.

[26:46] What are your thoughts on this Blake? I mean, and this new art package. Is that going to be the art package? Are they going to re-skin the game with that?

[26:53] I call that artwork. It looks like it's from a menu in Times Square is like Italian restaurant menu doesn't I just don't feel like that artwork is an improvement.

[27:04] I mean, but you're the artist. So I was I was trying to place where I felt like I had seen art like that before.

[27:10] And I think that your description of it being a Times Square menu is pretty accurate. Yeah. And you know, it's surprising because I mean, it's done by Dave Christensen who's who is a well known artist who's been in the game.

[27:22] And artist who's been in the industry for many decades, but what is he done? What's his claim?

[27:26] From a front art. So from an arts standpoint, I I hate that back glass artwork. And I know hates a strong word. I I just don't like it at all. I think that it it's just lacking personality on so many levels and it looks amateurish.

[27:47] Look, I'm an amateur. I don't I don't put myself on a pedestal by any means and I'm happy with the work I've done so far, but I feel like I've got a long ways to grow as an artist too, but but I don't know there's just something about that art that I just feel like does not work well.

[28:02] It's like it's like what are colors I'm looking at it now it looks like Bert Reynolds wearing like a Kermit the Frog suit.

[28:10] And like nothing about like with with this he's got his arm around this girl and it just looks really I mean when we think about the fact that we've got incredible artists now right raising the bar on art packages from zombie yedi to Christopher French to dirty donny.

[28:29] Blake you've worked on our packages. Games are looking sexier than ever and then I saw this and I was like no now.

[28:38] So so here's my understanding about this artwork and it made me feel a little bit better about the situation after I heard this assuming that it's true.

[28:47] That that art package could possibly be an Ellie model art package for the game that they might do a small run of games that have this art package but that the whatever you want to call the standard game basically would be the traditional you know pulp comic art style of the game and that right there is was what I want to see with the game you know that's the that sort of

[29:16] AC style artwork is what was so gorgeous about the original game and why was such a shame that the game never got produced as well because it supposedly not only was a fun game to shoot but I love that artwork on that game and well you know here's here's a thing the Ellie art package is supposed to be the nicest art package I yelled at Christopher French you for this you fucked up on gardens the galaxy you should have put the.

[29:46] The pro artwork is the nicest art package and you put freaking group on the Ellie and he's like well you know I thought more people would see the pro and my bro.

[29:57] The Ferrari puts the nicest trim package on the top of the line car not the entry level and I think pinball Ellie art packages should be the best looking it's not always the case it's not always the case but.

[30:13] I think i think that's a mistake I don't also like so that means we're going to get a limited edition of king pin and then another edition of it.

[30:23] That's my understanding of it now I don't know if that's true that could be strictly a rumor but I've heard that.

[30:30] That the most games that will be out there will be the traditional art package everybody wants to see and it makes sense so.

[30:37] What I think these guys are doing you know there are guys that are on the inside right now that are criticizing circus max mis for.

[30:43] Stopping work in their tracks on pinball circus after so many years of development and jumping tracks over to this other game that also wasn't ever fully complete but.

[30:53] Part of me also feels like it was a smart move you're probably looking at a game that has a much lower bill materials necessary for it's probably got.

[31:02] Mechanisms and parts that are more standard to the majority of games that are out there and on top of that they know that that's a game that will be in high demand if they can find a way to mass produce it right i mean look i'm looking at.

[31:17] Dave Christiansons art and in the last game he worked on was 1981.

[31:24] I mean that probably sounds about right i mean i just think the industry has moved art to a whole new level and it's nothing against Dave personally but.

[31:36] I mean if you're going to remake one of the rarest most expensive games of all time i think there's far more accomplished artist that probably should have been tapped but look.

[31:46] It's not even about the art for me i just i can see these guys making this game i mean they were whose manufacturing it like what's the plan for production.

[31:55] How many that's how many they can make.

[31:58] Yeah i mean i'm i'm quite sure they're going to be getting asked that question this week this weekend and you know i kind of get the feeling that what they're going to be showing off in Dallas is.

[32:08] Very much going to be a prototype game like it's like they have been scrambling to get this game built in the garage.

[32:16] To be able to show it and i think that this is a this is an effort to get a cash injection into their overall operation because.

[32:25] I don't think there's any money left to spend on pinball circus and god knows that's been a very difficult game inexpensive games develop so.

[32:35] You know but who is who the right mine i mean we've all been burned in the pre order world i mean they've got to realize like showing up asking people to invest in a company that's never made a single thing.

[32:49] And and sort of holding over people's heads the promise of one of the rarest most expensive games of all time as as a reason why i just think like.

[32:59] That to me sounds like pinball business model sort good 2014.

[33:05] All right it's been yeah i just think 2018 there's so much real stuff happening that if these guys come out and have no real production schedule and ask for any deposits.

[33:19] I i i think people are going to move right right past them so let's go on from these guys because i again like i don't want to spend too much time because i actually don't think they're going to get anything made this year at all.

[33:29] I want to move on to multi morpheck and p3 and and Jerry's going to be at the show again cosmic heart racing is going to be one of the new titles they show on the platform.

[33:40] I probably had some not the nicest things to say about here we are at another show and another another moment to get people to play the platform and.

[33:52] I guess the question I have for you Blake is do you think time is just sort of.

[33:56] It's running out on getting people to buy this platform at what point has it been around the block enough times yeah i think the excitement has certainly dwindled on the p3.

[34:09] I think that when they first unveiled their platform it was at a time when you had stern machines being produced and you barely had jersey jet games being produced at that point and it was quite honestly a very refreshing platform to see at that time five six years ago.

[34:29] I don't I still don't think that the the innovation of the game as far as the way they have the flippers and all that stuff is lost it's luster but I do think that they've just.

[34:43] They haven't really been able to sell people on the the swapable playfield stuff it's a concept that nobody's clamoring for except for maybe a handful of people.

[34:53] And I also think that.

[34:57] And not to sound like a snobbish artist you know or anything like that but I think that the the art direction of the games.

[35:07] Leaves a little something to be desired and I think that that's you know when you're looking at putting these games in your homes as just as much a static piece of artwork as a toy to play with.

[35:18] You you want to have something that looks really nice and presentable and i'm just not sure that they've quite gotten the design of the games on our direction up to that level you know I can see potential for how.

[35:34] The playfield you know animations and all that could tie in to the surrounding artwork on top of the playfield but I think that.

[35:43] You know there's just more that needs to be done there and so I think people I just don't think people were that interested in more especially when you've got.

[35:52] Games like who Dini and attack from Mars that are out there for a considerably cheaper price point and as well spooky games and they offer more bang for the bucket seems like.

[36:04] I sound like i'm going to the toilet I mean the the thing with the platform that is selling customers on.

[36:13] Future swap ability of of new games right so more like a video game council less like a pinball machine where if I buy this they're going to be many titles to come down down the line that i'll be able to pop in and play.

[36:31] And I think people are probably worrying that where is that going to come from because who's going to develop and design for the platform if there isn't a large enough user base to support the R&D cost that has to go into making new titles for the machine and.

[36:51] You know look I think the games fun I mean I think we're Jerry if I were him I would really focus on the connectivity and get those games to be internet connected I think that is his sort of.

[37:06] Polar rabbit out of the hat sort of Hail Mary way to get more people in on the platform because I think it's so much fun when you're playing against somebody in competitive pinball I love that game where you like you you like have to hit the red or the or the green boxes and it sends balls over to the other person's game like that game at shows is so addictive and so much fun.

[37:32] I just think but you get the game home you can't play it like that yeah no I mean I think the game is a blast and I play that game at every show that I that I see that and I've had a great time playing it but you're right the head to head certainly proved to be even more.

[37:51] I think it's just a great time and I think we're.

[37:55] Effective and fun than the single game by itself in fact I could even see there being a great redemption value.

[38:02] To two of those games in a dayven buster is connected to each other you know I could I could also see there being a lot of potential for the platform being used.

[38:11] In ball virtual pinball tables they build you know those guys have managed to get some great licenses that they've turned into virtual machines and what if they were able to kind of meet in the middle and work with multi morphic on using the LCD for a partial virtual game.

[38:29] But also have some actual physical elements involved as well that could be a great cross over opportunity for people that want to have that modern LCD you know a video game feel but as well as the physicality of pinball right I totally agree now I heard about a bark now I'm my fingers across he's staring towards the door hopefully I don't have to hit pause but if he keeps ripping his barks.

[38:57] And he's heading in that direction.

[39:00] Oh man I he's not he's not yet at the door so we'll keep talking if he goes again like what I'll do is I'll just leave skype on and leave the record going and then I'll just pick it back up when I come back into the apartment house that sounds.

[39:13] No it sounds fine no problem.

[39:15] He's such an amazing guy I mean I literally like I just cater to him. Brenda's in Brenda would normally be walking and while I'm doing the podcast but she's in Boston for work.

[39:23] Well look I think that at the shows P3 and multi morphic it is a fun game to jump in on but to your point I mean look 10 grand when you're asking for $10,000 you have to sort of fall in love with the game and see the long term playability of it.

[39:46] And I think you know it's just really competitive there's just so much out there asking for people's money and newness and sort of freshness will always sort of rise to the top in terms of like what people want because I think pinball people are they're fickle like they fall in love with something and then they're on to the next they fall in love with something they're on to the next the majority of people you know they're never fully satisfied and it's hard to get people it can be a good thing.

[40:15] People excited for the first time again when they've seen something for so very long but absolutely you know it just is what it is you know I mean everyone who's making pinball machines it's not just Jerry it's Gary Stern it's Jersey Jack it's Charlie everyone has to be nervous that the market is getting oversaturated and it's going to make it harder and harder for them to sell so what other so we talked about multi morphic we talked about

[40:43] this pinball circus was there a third one that was on the fringes that we want to talk about I don't think so not this year.

[40:54] Well we know that highway pinball is not coming and Dutch pinball is not coming right and their absence is we don't even have to explain why I probably would expect coin taker to bring an alien machine I think so too.

[41:09] Yeah I think there's still taken orders I mean they're making the game I mean there's a big difference between what's happening at highway pinball right now and what's happening at Dutch pinball.

[41:19] Oh absolutely.

[41:21] What is slowly being made and one is still trying to figure out how to remake it.

[41:27] I am glad that we're not seeing anyone from either one of those companies spend money to travel to Texas because nobody wants to see him nobody.

[41:37] Yeah at this point I don't think there's well I'll say this if the highway guys the new highway guys had come over here people would have listened they would have gotten their attention just because I'm not sure if those guys have been at a single show yet you know to really explain what are they doing but you're absolutely right about the Dutch guys there's nothing that they could come you know that you're very come over here and tell everybody and make them feel at ease that they're not going to lose their money.

[42:06] Yeah well yeah I mean at this point every every dollar spent is some pre order guys money going to their plane ticket going to their meal going to their bottle of beer and nobody wants to see those guys spending anything other than manufacturing games.

[42:29] I'm seeing Bubba move like let me let me walk them yeah yeah I will be back in like five minutes and we will continue so we're going to get on to the top three okay no no worries take time.

[42:40] All right we're back all right Bubba has been walked he did number one and number two I'm a single daddy tonight maybe I should feel that like ten minute gap with with the head to head pinball lap track.

[42:57] And we're still we'd still come up we'd still come up a good hour shorter than a normal episode oh my god I've been laughing my ass off at that at work since you've been thrown in there.

[43:08] I'm sorry.

[43:14] I'm just making it a whole team.

[43:16] Thank you.

[43:18] Thank you.

[43:21] Okay pay good money for you we're going to we're going to hear it a lot we're going to hear it a lot.

[43:25] You need to get them to record some new sound bites for you this weekend.

[43:29] Well it's funny well I can just grab new new laughs from every time they upload a new episode on Monday is it great there's like two hours of Marty just going nuts.

[43:40] Oh so fun yes there'll be new lap tracks coming for sure.

[43:44] All right so let's move on to the top three right so there this show it's almost like the seas have parted and.

[43:53] Charlie Jack and you know our friends over to American pinball they they probably couldn't have got better news than stern's not going to be there and Chicago gaming's not going to be there so the floor is theirs to dominate the conversation so out of those three Blake we've got Alice Cooper's nightmare castle we've got

[44:17] a higher to the Caribbean and we've got Houdini right who do you think's going to sort of if you had a rank how do you think people are going to respond to those three titles I know it's we've seen two of them so it's maybe it's an unfair question but yeah maybe that is an unfair question that I think about because we haven't seen Alice Cooper.

[44:37] Right well but that's got to have the house Cooper's got to have the most excitement because it's new right I think so and I mean for me personally.

[44:46] That's the game that I'm absolutely looking forward to seeing the most this weekend but you know I've also seen the other two machines I probably would be equally as excited for pirates had I not seen it already but I think that this weekend is it's all going to be about spooky I think I think that this game I think it's going to hopefully be the winner of the show for them.

[45:14] You know people have been critical about their games over the years and I think that they know that they could continue to grow and do more and more things with their games and it sounds like this is their opportunity to show that they do have what it takes to do that and everything I've heard and what little I've seen really makes me think that this is going to be a special game for them I think it's going to be an excellent excellent game and I think people are going to kind of look at it.

[45:43] We're going to kind of look past the fact that it's an Alice Cooper game and see this is more of just a really fun atmospheric game like you know Adams family or Monster Bash.

[45:55] Right. Have you seen anything more than what the rest of us have seen with some of the teasers?

[46:03] I have seen very little all I have actually seen is the cabinet artwork and the play field artwork and we haven't seen that yet we've seen no you've seen a little significantly.

[46:19] You don't have to go into detail but what are your thoughts I mean you've seen everything coming out from an artistic standpoint is it does it hold its own in the in the art department I think it hold I think it holds its own you know you're you're not going to see the the minute level of detail that you see like in dirty Donnie or zombie yet he's artwork but what you're going to do is you're going to see it.

[46:47] He's artwork but what you're going to see on that game I think is the best artwork that spooky is had on a machine today and I got to say it's just the cabinet especially just looks freaking amazing and the play field artwork is very elegant it's it's not overly complex with you know little elements and every nook and cranny and I think part of that is because

[47:14] the physical castle takes up so much of the back of the game from what I understand but why are you really excited now like what I love about it is the style because it really reminded me of that that sort of old school ghoulish illustrative feel that you see on games like haunted house or that you see in some of the old like horror comic books from the 60s and 70s.

[47:44] That's what it really reminds me of and it's not like it's nothing that's like grotesque but it's still horrific if you know what I mean it just has that it really has that old school vibe to it and that really resonated with me I thought that was such a great approach and you can see how they were inspired with that with that style in the the brief glimpse that we've seen at the animation so far

[48:12] and the teaser video and I think that that's really going to blow people away and do you think you think you're going to wait the Saturday night.

[48:22] Oh you're long wait it is a long wait and and I see it's kind of a catch 22 for them because you know they want to.

[48:33] They want to make a grand unveiling just like you know jack has with his games recently but at the same time it's so late in the weekend that you don't want to miss that opportunity either so Charlie said something to the effect of they may try and do something special to let people have glimpses of it over the weekend so I'm wondering if.

[48:55] You know do they put it out for really brief periods of time and maybe move it you know I mean I feel like they should get top billing and I think top billing.

[49:05] This is the only like new reveal that we're getting I mean for the most part like this is real this is a real game it's going to be made this isn't some like king pin like wish or intention this is a real game that Charlie and company are going to start making very shortly so.

[49:24] I think people are going to be throwing money at this thing I really do it just seems to me to make sense to bump it up the Friday night and make it the big Friday night moment because you're going to want everyone coming through the doors of Texas pinball festival on Saturday early on like new dawn to buy the game.

[49:45] If you wait to what it was like four o'clock on Saturday. Yeah believe so like that's too late so I think I think Kim and Ed should just bump it I think they should bump it you know because everyone who's really there for the show like the pinball die hard.

[50:03] They're all there Friday they're all there and so you want to get more of like your larger customer base I think in all throughout Saturday and then make just Saturday night your victory lap because come Sunday morning everyone gets the fuck out of there.

[50:18] Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah I mean you know I have no idea if there are any discussions about the scheduling and if they're going to get bump you know up or not I really don't know.

[50:31] We're going to schedule for TPS by the way is it on the website because I've been trying to find it the whole time we've been talking.

[50:37] So I believe that they did post the agenda to the Facebook page for TPS but that was like last week so you might have to do a little digging.

[50:47] I think it is somewhere on the website but I'm not entirely sure I can take a look and see.

[50:54] Oh no but okay so but it has been publicly posted. It's not a secret.

[51:02] No it's just it's great that it's really hard to find that on the website for the damn show itself I'm glad they buried it somewhere because it's not when you click on events it's not nothing comes up.

[51:13] You would think there would be like here's a schedule of events.

[51:17] Nope the only thing I see when I go to their web page is is your face Blake immediately at the top of the page.

[51:24] So here's who's going to be there and then we'll go back to the other two manufacturers so there is going to be Blake is going to be a special guest George Gomez is going to be in the house Dennis Nordman is going to be in the house Steve Richie is going to be there.

[51:40] Boeing Burns is going to be there. Lou Ferigno I mean why not.

[51:47] That's kind of cool actually.

[51:49] He's sure why not.

[51:50] He's just did everything. He did all those like chiller events.

[51:53] The guy makes a living now just going around we get Jerry at multi Morphex going to be there Charlie and the team at spooky.

[52:00] Let's see.

[52:03] Anyone else on missing Jersey Jack and company color DMD's going to be there.

[52:08] Jerry elsewhere is going to be there Mark or she's going to be there Joe Balser.

[52:14] Mark Ritz then Scott Denise he's going to be there.

[52:18] John Borg is going to be there.

[52:20] Yep. Oh Lyman she says going to be there even though they haven't formally announced him.

[52:24] Dirty Donnie is going to be there. Christopher French is going to be there.

[52:28] Can Chris Christopher French you get a more intense photo of himself than the one he has where he's like.

[52:35] He actually he actually asked me to swap out that picture with the picture I was going to put in the program pages.

[52:43] And it's a it's another great photo with maybe slightly less intensity but almost the same.

[52:52] You know, it's actually going to be Chris.

[52:54] Yeah.

[52:55] It's actually told me that he's going to have two limited edition prints that he'll be selling for Batman 66 and for Guardians of Galaxy at the show.

[53:07] How much?

[53:08] I don't know.

[53:10] He's fleecing us.

[53:11] He's fleecing us.

[53:12] I know what he's doing.

[53:14] They're they're they're I don't know if he said how much they're going to be actually but they're they're cool.

[53:21] It's mostly artwork derived from what what's on the games.

[53:24] Right. Now there I jab at Chris. Chris is a great guy.

[53:28] I talked him all the time. I mean he's his artwork is beautiful.

[53:32] I stare at Batman every day and I still think it's one of the nicest looking Pym on machines ever.

[53:38] All right.

[53:39] So I agree that this is going to be a big big show for spooky.

[53:44] And if they announce that Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is going to go on the line in late March early April and they're only making 500.

[53:55] I used to think you know what there's no way they're going to sell 500 and the more I think about it knowing that spooky like has production down and people get their games and people are getting their total nuclear annihilations and their lovenum.

[54:09] I think they're going to be just fine. I think they're going to absolutely be just fine with this title now.

[54:14] I think what you're going to find with this game just from my understanding of how they've explained sort of the rules and the modes.

[54:23] I think this is going to go well beyond just being an Alice Cooper game and I think it's going to be it's going to have an atmosphere in a real cool vibe to it that.

[54:34] That I don't think people were originally expecting I think that they were just expecting another music pin and I don't think that that's what you're going to get with this.

[54:43] I know it sounds like I'm kind of shilling for the game and yes, I have a history of working with these guys.

[54:48] But you know, there's just everything that we've seen has really peaked my interest on it and I think the approach it sounds like they're taking.

[54:57] To telling a story with the game is a lot more compelling and it sounds like it's going to be more fun than your average music pin.

[55:05] Right. And when they said that from the beginning is that this isn't a music pin.

[55:10] Right. It is a horror game in the you know, with Alice Cooper is like the caretaker of this castle and there's these monsters you got to battle.

[55:18] But this isn't like your Alice Cooper's Roating you're trying to get through like 12 songs off his albums and that's like the goal of the game.

[55:27] Like it's nothing like that and I think that's a smarter approach is I've always felt that a lot of music pins.

[55:34] There's no real storyline you know, you kind of just like you play him but it doesn't have like the kind of narrative that you want in a pinball machine.

[55:44] All right. So it's I think it's spooky show to lose and so let's go to Jersey Jack because Jersey Jack they showed Pirates of the Caribbean way back right expo feels like an eternity ago.

[55:57] It does I was there right. I mean and it just feels like it's been six months right I mean pretty much.

[56:04] How does Jersey Jack going get hype now that we're heading into Q1 of 2018 and I'm not sure pirates is going to shipping Q1 because there's not many more months in Q1 left so how do you think the reception is going to be this time around and do you think they're going to get games off the door.

[56:27] I'm soon. I feel like because of the complexity of this game that this probably is not going to start shipping until late May maybe early early June.

[56:37] I think it's going to be a summer game honestly which when you think about it it's like man that's that's a long ways from when they first unveiled the game and that's that's exactly the time frame that they started making dialed in too was in the early summer but as far as the game goes.

[56:53] It is a spectacular game I do look forward to playing it again the game absolutely lives up to the hype and I think it's by far the best game that they've made so far.

[57:04] But for the people that have played it I'm not sure if the excitement factors really going to be there I mean I'm looking forward to playing it again but it's it's not going to be the go to game for me at the show this year not like dialed in was.

[57:21] But I do I do think that it's going to resonate with people that are attending that may have families people that might be looking for just one pinball machine I think it is going to catch fire with them very very easily right.

[57:37] Yeah I mean I'm looking forward to playing it I I didn't go to expose so I sort of saw all the fanfare happened from a distance and I haven't been able to play it on location I know there's been some out in the wild in Chicago and in some other places but I'm just looking forward to jumping on it I mean I've always I've been someone critical of the hobbit I feel like was was a little bit of like not my cup of tea.

[58:03] But I've heard a lot of positive stuff about pirates the Caribbean and I think for me and I'm currently in on a collector's edition of it just because I was like well why not it's a $1,000 refundable deposit and and I do stupid stuff like like by really expensive pinball machines that play exactly the same as a game that costs $4,000 less or in Batman's case it plays exactly the same as one that cost this is scary to say this it's $7,000 more than a batman.

[58:32] Yeah what the fuck Chris yeah that was I thinking I've got a wedding to pay for but I'm really excited to play it because I do think this is going to be it just from the looks of it it looks like it's got more going on and is a better shooter than anything you know I keep forgetting dialed in because I that is an amazing game.

[58:57] It is a great game but I'll say this pirates pirates is it's a game that you're not going to be disappointed in at all and you know you and I talk a lot about theme integration we have over over you know many episodes and I feel like for as many people that want to complain about you can't use Johnny Depp's likeness in the video content all that this is one game where it almost doesn't matter there's so much

[59:26] else going on in the game and I will say that they were truly innovative in the mechanisms and stuff they put in it that it doesn't matter I mean this thing shoots equally as smoothly if not even more so then dialed in does I mean Eric just did a phenomenal job on it right and and that's what I'm hearing I mean I'm hearing nothing but good things and you know

[59:51] you know theme integration aside I think what is the silver lining in all of this is that people don't really like the pirate to the Caribbean movies that much I mean they like the first film but like there's been for them and like the last three have been like kind of like just mediocre so I think they actually works to their advantage because just pirates in general just the world of pirates and ships and cannons and gold and you know sea creatures and crack ins it's just a really good thing to do it.

[01:00:21] It's really cool world to put under glass and the fact that it's it's based on the popular film franchise doesn't hurt because I don't think people are like going to be complaining that much that they're not seeing clips from the movies because I don't think there's that many clips from the movies that are that iconic other than the first film or two that people would want to see integrated and look people forgave you know alien for not having so go on lever is the main character so I don't think I'm going to be playing with the movie.

[01:00:51] We get a pirate out Johnny Depp.

[01:00:54] Yeah I mean and as far as the animations and stuff go the animations that were in the machines at expo were top notch I mean they were very very well rendered they were beautifully detailed and well done almost too much to the point where you could not even you could even tell what all was going on on the screen or focus on all the little details while you were playing but I will say the games got one of the absolute coolest

[01:01:21] toppers I've ever seen you know the attack from Mars toppers fantastic the Batman 66 toppers fantastic but the ship in the bottle that's on the collectors edition is incredibly well done and you just have to see it in person to see all the little the little subtleties to it it's it's very cool.

[01:01:40] And one feature I'm looking forward to seeing that I assume will be functional at the show is the led constellations that are in the backboard.

[01:01:52] They were not programmed at the time of expo but you you could see them just on like in an attract mode and they looked very cool there's the way that they they kind of set it up they made the backboard very very dark in the back of the machine.

[01:02:08] And when those LEDs are lit it actually looks like there's depth to those stars like it's it's more than just a flat board with LEDs on them and I thought that was very effective so I'm very interested to see what the programming looks like on that because that was a cool feature.

[01:02:25] And then of course the the rocking ship and stuff was just spectacular.

[01:02:30] Yeah and I heard it doesn't shoot like a wide body which is which is always good because no one ever says man I wish this fast game would shoot more like a wide body.

[01:02:40] It makes the habit look it makes the habit look incredibly boring I'm going to be honest it really does.

[01:02:47] Well that game has always been a little bit of a flirty mess but I heard it's I heard you know I heard I hear from some people that own it that you got to get into code number 37 my only concern with pirates though I mean I think aesthetically it looks amazing I think the mix are awesome I think eric didn't incredible job.

[01:03:04] I'm a little worried that they're going to go way overboard on the complexity of the coding and 125 chapters and 22 characters to select from.

[01:03:15] And you know if you hit this target at this point it's worth half a point then it's worth a fraction of a point then it's I don't want to do math when I play pinball.

[01:03:24] I just want to know what to do I don't want to have to do calculations in my head and I don't you know I'm a little worried I'm worried about with the randomness of the code is like what if you like know the modes you really love the most like you can't select them you have to like randomly wait for them to appear.

[01:03:44] So are people going to like that I'm we haven't had a game ever liked that before where it's random selection of all your modes to break up yeah I'm not sure how I mean I guess there's going to be so much to the game.

[01:03:59] That maybe it won't bother people too much but you're right especially for people that have it in a home environment after they play it a number of times they probably are going to have favorite modes that they want to be able to replay and.

[01:04:12] I'm not sure if there's going to be an easy way to do that okay well interesting show for Jersey Jack as I think he's going to he's going to do we know how many he's bringing probably it is he going to bring to or for or I mean he showed up with dialed ends up the was you he had like six or eight when he when he unveiled that game if I had to guess I would say that they're going to have quite a few I mean he had I think they had six machines.

[01:04:41] Six machines six pirates at expo so and that was you know before the game was was fully done really so I would expect that they're going to have at least that many at this show.

[01:04:56] Well we know we know spooky is only bringing two hours Cooper's and in Texas gets crowded yeah it's going to be you know I'm online already to play out Cooper and we're like we're like five days out.

[01:05:10] I'm already online I'm at the show right now I think that's that's that's one I'm going to I'm going to see if they'll let me get a sneak preview of that one to play it early because the lines are going to be really long for it.

[01:05:22] Right I might bring a boom box and have like the head to head pinball lap track on it and just like it play and maybe that'll clear out some of the line it didn't add a little bit I got it to it I like I got I got to get my money's worth with this thing.

[01:05:35] All right so the last game in this sort of triumvirant these three new games sort of jockeying for people's dollars is going to be who Dini.

[01:05:45] And what makes who Dini's presence at this year's tpf I mean it's a miracle in in 12 months we went from you know sort of like a race against the clock to just get something at tpf to show people that American pinball wasn't going to be you know jump hop adooks mistake it was going to be a whole new company and they had a whole new design team.

[01:06:06] And here we are a year later and customers are getting their machines and now people are going to be able to play the final version of who Dini for the most part there's still some coding tweaks Josh will do but it's going to be at tpf and people can order the game from many distributors so.

[01:06:23] Like what it would what how excited are you to play who Dini again and and how do you think it's going to do at the show.

[01:06:30] You know I think it's going to go over well with a lot of people because I don't it doesn't seem like a whole lot of people have had a chance to play the game for me personally i've gotten a lot of time in on the game already we've had one here in Houston for a little over a month now and i've had.

[01:06:47] A little ample time to just play it with no one else around the work in here the sounds and stuff i'm the game is a lot of fun actually i think the game is considerably better than the the early iteration of it that they brought to the show last year.

[01:07:02] I think Josh and Joe and everybody American pinball have done a really great job pulling this game together and making it something special they they have every right to be proud of this game and i think that there are going to be people.

[01:07:17] For the price point that it's at that are going to be very seriously interested in it.

[01:07:24] How does it shoot and all that kind of stuff well i think it shoots fine overall i i agree with you that there are a few tight shots here and there that you might not be able to repeatedly hit that frequently but overall i think it's a really good game i like it i like it a lot i was.

[01:07:45] I was very impressed with it when i played it in Chicago in October and i think that it's held up really well and i think they made the game even better now that it's shipping right yeah i mean i'm really looking forward to playing it again i couldn't you know the game i played it wasn't set up right i couldn't hear it it's like watching a movie with no volume you know and so.

[01:08:11] Pinball is a physical and audio experience and so i'm really looking forward to getting the right kind of experience with who do you need the game is seven thousand dollars and it's jam packed with stuff.

[01:08:26] Right and you know when we look at the prices of these games we haven't really talked price much but Houdini and Alice Cooper's nightmare castle are coming in around the same price it sounds like both of them are going to have a hell of a lot for your money you know jersey jacks the leap up but i think people see the jersey jack games and they definitely see the value in why they're spending more i would say the company that's still.

[01:08:53] You really have to sort of scratch your head at an Ellie from Stern for nine thousand dollars i still think Stern has some ways to go to justify where they're at with the price of these machines but they're they're winning on theme and they're winning on their ability to manufacture quickly you know you don't want to wait but it's man it's all these companies like it's it's so.

[01:09:23] It's like pinball is alive pinball is flourishing there is it's a buyers market it is a buyers market absolutely and i mean i'm hearing of more and more pinball leagues and barcades and opportunities for the general public to get exposure to pinball again popping up all over the country i mean i think it's it's truly amazing.

[01:09:53] And i don't think that we would see as many of these companies coming out of the woodwork and more of them than not succeeding if the hobby and the industry wasn't doing well i think that it is i said this last year and i'll say it again it's a spectacular time for pinball and being a fan of this hobby to see how many options that we've got out there and to see that the new companies are starting to to get production you know damn it.

[01:10:23] They're going down pat and they're they're figuring out how to to get these games out a little bit more quickly.

[01:10:28] It's incredibly exciting i mean to think that that it's doing so well that you know we can see so many companies making a variety of themes and then companies like spooky take somebody's whitewood prototype game that people just fell in love with the show and turn it around into their most successful pinball machine up to this point.

[01:10:51] I think that's awesome and it makes me wonder you know what else can be done in a boutique manner that maybe we don't need to crank out thousands of units but still make a really spectacular game and in a more limited manner it still is getting some really good imagination and creativity out there.

[01:11:11] Right and i mean i agree i think that you know for boutique manufacturers out there there's not a lot of white space but if you want to come out with a very limited run game there's the market for it.

[01:11:26] There is the market for it because as much as there's so many options right now there will always be a market for the collector or the you know the guy who wants something that not everybody else has.

[01:11:39] And that will there will always be a pathway to sell that to people if the game is good though we're we're past the point of just rarity equals consumption.

[01:11:50] I think spooky got off the ground that way but i think they know now that they just can't announce well it's limited so we're going to sell everyone i think people are going to demand the games or worth the money.

[01:12:02] But i think it's a great time to be in pinball something i'm curious about.

[01:12:07] I wonder if this is going to happen in pinball Blake where you know how there's a lot of car dealerships and there's a lot of car manufacturers and ultimately after a car has been out for a year the manufacturer will offer you discounts on that new car to move the car off the lot.

[01:12:29] We've never really seen that in pinball but i'm wondering you know like as we head into year two with dialed in and it's lost some of its hype.

[01:12:39] Do you ever think a company like Jersey Jack who can make dialed in forever because he owns the IP of dialed in that we're going to start to see maybe some discounts on titles that are year two old just to keep people from bought you know keep people buying it because he doesn't see a penny when those games sell used in the second hand market.

[01:12:58] Right that's a really good point i actually had not thought about that.

[01:13:03] I guess the question is what's their profit margin and are they willing to take in less profit off of each individual machine by lowering the price.

[01:13:15] Are they making enough of a profit above and beyond the bill of materials that they feel like they can reduce that profit margin a little bit.

[01:13:25] And if they are making a substantial amount of money that's going in their pockets in addition to the cost of the game then maybe they would be willing to do that but i don't know i mean the only time i've seen the price is come down on these new games is really just with the distributors that are doing that exact thing they're basically saying.

[01:13:50] I've already got this many games new in box they're not really selling that well i have no choice but to lower the cost a little bit to be able to move them out of my show room you know right.

[01:14:02] Yeah it's interesting because i probably just feels like all these new games coming out coupled with the the tons of games are just always for sale in the used market.

[01:14:15] Something's going to give soon we talk about the bubble burst and i think we always speculate that but i think we're really at the point where we're at we might be at the saturation level of they're just on enough new in box buyers to support all of these companies hitting their target estimates on these new games because i mean we heard from from Josh kugler when we were talking him about who deany is they jam packed because they need to sell a lot.

[01:14:44] Right so their projections for sales i would have to imagine has to be north of a thousand games which is a lot for a new company to find that many buyers of a title when you're competing against so many other options out there.

[01:15:02] Yeah i mean they they need this game to be successful and and i understand why they're not coming back to tpf this year to unveil yet another game and that they really want to make sure that who deenys going to stick around and that it's going to be a successful game for them before they.

[01:15:21] I have too far into committing to a second game i mean that's that's smart business and not you know overexerting themselves as a company because they they are still small you know they're they're simply happy.

[01:15:34] You know what happened it was going to probably be October fest and i've i've single handedly destroyed.

[01:15:41] That theme in the pinball world they can't make October fest like i just.

[01:15:47] No that you're soft you know of all people i'm a firm believer in anything could be possibly made into a good pinball machine however with that said i agree with you from a marketing standpoint i just don't see the.

[01:16:07] The sellability of of an October.

[01:16:12] The devil's advocate people are like what are you talking about it's got women scantily clad it's got music it's got beer that's that equals fun pinball and i'm just like you know what.

[01:16:22] Go make October fest and see what happens and then don't make me say i told you so it should have been big trouble in little china i'm going to keep beating that dead horse.

[01:16:31] People can play about hearing the same songs on the music pins over and over again and these are by.

[01:16:36] Pretty much a list bands what do you think people are going to feel like after they keep hearing polka over and over and over again.

[01:16:42] I'm gonna.

[01:16:44] Look Josh we should talk Joe ball sir devil give me a call guys give me call let's figure this out together well Blake i really appreciate you coming on the show i'm also grateful because i'm.

[01:17:00] Crashing in in Blake's room again this is like become a thing of us like Blake books his room way in advance i waver and i waffle on and actually committing and then by the time i want to go it's too late to get a room in the hotel.

[01:17:16] And then Blake lets me crash with him and then i you know i pay half my way and i buy a bunch of drinks and a bunch of food and when we we have a good time.

[01:17:25] And i mean hey you know if it helps get you to Texas then it's totally worth it i mean it's a you know it's a great show and i was looking forward to hanging out with you and i think there's going to be more people to hang out with this year so.

[01:17:38] Yeah it's going to be good it should be a great time well we will report from the show so you'll probably hear.

[01:17:45] At least me maybe Blake will join the show will get some more people on there we should do like we should recreate what is happening in barry in yops room over in the Netherlands at the same time like we should be how far they fall in from their penthouse parties and telling you know how stupid stern was we we should be like and now we're going to cut to barry in yops in the Netherlands and it's just like maybe.

[01:18:14] It's just like maybe it's just the lap track from head to head pinball for like three hours i don't know we'll figure it out well i like your idea of doing a full blown podcast manasery with all the podcasters that are going to be present at the show.

[01:18:28] We know like a lot are going to be there right it's we should just do a podcast real rumble we got Ryan see we got myself i know like bro do even talk straight down the middle is going to be there the flipping they're all going to be there they're all going to be there i'll take this though only one only one.

[01:18:43] How's a twippy award boom boom you get you get your airtime based upon your your your your twippies.

[01:18:51] Oh there you go based on the amount of votes that you got i should bring the twippy with me i think it's plastic i don't even have to go through the me i could i could carry it in my hand like like it's the the the the holy grail as i walk through the metal detector i'm like don't worry this thing is plastic.

[01:19:10] Well they probably still be afraid that you can stab somebody with it and it looks like it does look like a weapon it does like a weapon.

[01:19:18] Can you imagine trying to explain that to a tsa agent i swear it's just it's just my twippy award yeah i mean i'm not a man yeah like every week i record three pinball podcasts for no money at at the risk of losing my relationship and have all my co-workers look at me like i'm a freaking idiot but yeah it's worth it thanks guys for.

[01:19:39] Toon it in.

[01:19:41] Oh and by the way i'm actually on my way to a huge pinball show yeah i should so you know what funny part and then and then we'll end this chat is i'm i'm going to be an Atlanta on Monday after the show and i got to go down for a big piece of business a big business pitch.

[01:19:58] And they're like can you fly in Monday and you got to fly sundaim like well i don't know i'm like already pre committed to something and they're like what i'm going to a pinball show in texas and they just looked at me like are you fucking kidding us right now like it works out for me though so they're actually now going to pay for me to fly from.

[01:20:21] From Dallas right to Atlanta which is actually a shorter flight than i probably from then right it's only a two hour flight it's a piece of cake yeah so it's simple and then i'll go to the pitch.

[01:20:33] Man they probably should have worn them that spending two days with a bunch of pinball guys i'm going to be in pretty rugged like ragged shape for this pitch but it'll be good it'll be fine well you know that's that's one of the fun things about texas.

[01:20:51] Yes it's kind of become a bit of an industry show but it's very much a party show it's a it's a really good time.

[01:20:59] Like once you like i barely play pinball at these pinball shows yeah i mean i'm literally like just hanging out with people talking about pinball watching people play pinball.

[01:21:12] I get my kicks from the people i really know i'll jump on the new machines but for the most part i played almost everything that's out there but i as i said it's the only time you can turn to the person to your left and to your right.

[01:21:28] And actually not have them on a punch you in the face when you start talking about pinball code and vertical up kicks and orbit shots like nobody nobody in my normal day to day even understand what language i'm speaking if they were to listen to my podcast so.

[01:21:46] I got the same reaction at work whatever i told him what i was going to do this weekend to so yeah they're like you're not actually spending money to go to the show are you i'm like yeah.

[01:21:57] I'm actually one of the guests i upgraded like i upgraded the first class.

[01:22:02] I'm a twippy award winner i'm going first class i mean it's not it was like a cheap first class flight to is like it's only like 200 bucks like just to get to Texas like with regular like see and i'm like you know what i'll treat myself i'll treat myself.

[01:22:19] I should have got two first class tickets me in one seat the twippy in the other seat with the seat belt around it ordering it drinks and everything you know and then i have the boom box with a lap track going the whole way there.

[01:22:32] The whole way.

[01:22:33] Oh next year.

[01:22:36] Yeah there's only maybe and maybe you can have a seat for two twippies.

[01:22:40] Yeah maybe i imagine going two for two i don't know man i feel like i feel like i'm always i'm always anxious who knows.

[01:22:47] All right well Blake this has been incredible we will we will i will see you in a few days for those of you out there in the world i would go to pin side as the best place to sort of catch all the reveals that are happening at tpf there's always a lot of people at the shows taking photos and sharing them on pin side so that's your best bet.

[01:23:08] To almost like the carousel be at the show so we look forward to reporting from the show as well and yeah it's a great week for pinball a lot of fun stuff comes from these shows.

[01:23:21] Yeah absolutely it's it's going to be a great time and i'm certainly looking forward to seeing everybody and it's it's a highlight every year.

[01:23:29] With Blake the last point i'll make is would you take the hilton hoodie as payment for the hotel room.

[01:23:36] Oh man you know that is a tempting offer it's it's value we should get everyone to sign it sort of like the the apron of destiny.

[01:23:47] I really I really hope now see we don't have a plan yet for when you're going to unveil this to hilton now he's going to be at the show.

[01:23:56] I should like I know I should sort of I should sort of like rig it so it's up in the raptors and when he walks underneath it I should slowly lower it down so it just like it just falls onto his body it'll fit like a glove it's because it's destiny i mean this this is like a four year in the making hoodie i mean well you know i probably know the right person that could arrange to just have it put with his registration packet.

[01:24:25] Oh my god i need to make yeah i need to make multiple versions because i feel like he's going to destroy them one by one as we leave them around the show.

[01:24:36] I actually have to go to the printer this week because the damn like Zazzle website like wooden print the Homer Simpson's image because it's copyright protected i'm like you want to fuck her.

[01:24:46] Yeah yeah i'll go to a local printer we'll get it we'll get it figured out it's it's really my number one priority this week is to get the hilton hoodie ready for Texas more than more than my clients that pay for me i need to get this hilton hoodie ready.

[01:25:00] Well we don't want to have one less reveal at the show you know we've already lost enough of them right.

[01:25:08] If if if canada pulled out revealing the hilton hoodie to tpf they might just cancel the show.

[01:25:14] Oh wow you know who knows maybe i'll start my own Texas show like pinball polusa and just we'll just have competing shows every other week in these major cities who knows.

[01:25:23] Yep well all right bud well we will see on Friday looking forward to it.

[01:25:30] All right everyone have a great night.

[01:25:32] All right you too.
