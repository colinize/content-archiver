[00:00] YMCA, it's fun to stay the food.

[00:03] YMCA, they have everything.

[00:08] From your mental enjoy, you can hang out all over.

[00:13] Cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars, cedars.

[00:17] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:20] Happy Friday.

[00:21] We are what?

[00:23] It is December 13th, and I'm here to tell you right now,

[00:27] with 100% confirmation and certainty,

[00:32] we are gonna see a new Stern machine in less than a month,

[00:37] in about three weeks.

[00:38] If you go back in history, where does Stern always go

[00:43] early January?

[00:45] They love to rock up at CES.

[00:48] They've been there many, many years.

[00:50] Jaws was revealed there.

[00:52] It was revealed there.

[00:54] I believe Jaws, the teaser, was on a Tuesday,

[00:57] and then the game was at the show on a Thursday,

[01:00] and they've revealed games like Stranger Things at the show.

[01:04] I think even Venom was there.

[01:06] Or no, Venom was sometime in August.

[01:08] I think Venom was so sorry about that.

[01:10] Scratch that one.

[01:11] But we are now at that period where the year is over.

[01:15] We've got Metallica, we're gonna talk about that.

[01:18] We got some X-Men issues that never go away.

[01:21] We've got people speculating about Spike 3.

[01:23] I've got some news on that for everybody out there.

[01:28] I think everybody's got to sort of simmer down a little bit

[01:31] about what their expectations of Spike 3 are going to be.

[01:36] And we're about to close out the year.

[01:38] And I think whenever a pinball year closes out,

[01:40] there is a moment of reflection.

[01:43] We think about the games that came out.

[01:46] We think about what all these companies have achieved

[01:48] in the last year.

[01:50] Have we seen pinball go forward?

[01:52] Which pinball companies are making the right decisions?

[01:56] Which pinball companies seem to be taking some steps back?

[02:00] Which pinball companies don't seem like

[02:02] they're gonna survive much longer?

[02:04] Let's go around the horn on this episode

[02:06] and just see where they're at in pinball right now.

[02:08] I'm not gonna do a recap of the year show right now,

[02:11] but let's just go around and see where everybody is currently

[02:13] at in the state of pinball and what the news is out there

[02:16] in the pinball world.

[02:17] Let's talk first and foremost about timing

[02:20] around this next stern game.

[02:22] So CES this year is Tuesday, January 7th

[02:26] through Friday, January 10th.

[02:28] That works out really nicely for a stern pinball.

[02:31] So then I would sort of step back a little bit

[02:34] and I would expect stern pinball to release a teaser

[02:40] on the Friday before that January 7th moment

[02:44] because I think they're gonna wanna have the game

[02:46] on the floor when CES opens up.

[02:49] If we look at the calendar,

[02:51] then I would expect stern pinball to tease reveal

[02:55] the title of its next game either on Thursday,

[02:59] January 2nd or Friday, January 3rd.

[03:03] Will they do something at the end of December

[03:05] like a New Year's celebration

[03:07] and give us a little holiday treat?

[03:09] I don't know, but it is coming.

[03:11] Is it gonna be Dungeons & Dragons

[03:13] or is it gonna be King Kong?

[03:15] Now here's the thing.

[03:16] I've learned a lot of new information about Spike 3.

[03:20] You've already seen some of Spike 3, everybody.

[03:23] If you open up your new Metallica and you're noticing,

[03:26] there's a new power system in the game.

[03:29] That is part of Spike 3.

[03:31] What if I told you that Spike 3

[03:34] isn't gonna be a new platform?

[03:36] I think everyone's thinking about it like that.

[03:38] I think everyone thinks that stern pinball

[03:41] is gonna go from head to toe

[03:43] and make all of these significant changes to their platform

[03:47] so that when you see a Spike 3 stern machine,

[03:49] you're gonna be seeing something radically different.

[03:52] I think a lot of us thought there might be a bigger screen

[03:55] in the machine itself.

[03:57] I think when I interviewed George Gomez,

[03:58] he might have alluded to that,

[04:00] but maybe it's just a better quality screen.

[04:03] Maybe it doesn't need to be a larger screen.

[04:06] Maybe they're not gonna make the speaker grill area smaller.

[04:09] And so I'm here to tell you right now

[04:11] that with utmost certainty,

[04:13] I think everybody should now sort of lower their expectations,

[04:18] lower their expectations of what their Spike 3 feelings are.

[04:22] And that doesn't mean you should lower your expectations

[04:26] of what stern pinball is gonna put into market

[04:29] because the other thing I heard

[04:31] is that on the next two releases from stern pinball,

[04:34] they are really going to push the envelope on creativity.

[04:39] And you're gonna see a lot more creativity

[04:43] in their next two releases

[04:45] and they can do more things creatively

[04:48] because of the power of Spike 3

[04:51] and what Spike 3 will allow them to do

[04:54] from a design standpoint.

[04:56] And that's really all that matters.

[04:57] I think everyone needs to think about Spike 3

[05:00] more as processing and less as a platform.

[05:04] And I think, for those of you out there who think,

[05:06] like, oh, stern's gonna start to look

[05:07] like a Jersey Jack machine.

[05:09] It's not gonna happen.

[05:10] Now, if you think about the things you want

[05:12] in a stern machine, we want more advanced lighting.

[05:15] I don't really think like a better display

[05:16] is anything that really matters at all.

[05:18] To me, it's not the display.

[05:20] It's just, I would love to see stern be able

[05:22] to power more interesting stuff underneath the play field.

[05:26] We know when they did Spike 2,

[05:28] they did a major overhaul to the board systems in the games,

[05:31] the node boards.

[05:33] We might see more innovation there.

[05:35] We know that Insider Connected

[05:37] is a big initiative for stern pinball.

[05:39] So I expect maybe more seamless integration

[05:42] with the internet, maybe a better internet experience.

[05:45] You're holding your phone with the QR codes

[05:47] is very old and pedestrian,

[05:50] and maybe they're gonna advance that.

[05:53] There's no camera in a stern machine

[05:54] like there isn't a Jersey Jack machine.

[05:57] I don't think there will be, but it'd be nice to have one.

[06:00] I'll tell you where I would love to see pinball go

[06:03] is with better internet connectivity.

[06:05] I would love to really feel like I'm playing against

[06:09] the other friends of mine in the pinball industry.

[06:12] And if we're playing against each other on the same game,

[06:15] it would be cool to have an outwardly facing camera

[06:17] so I could see them and they could see me

[06:20] as we are playing each other.

[06:22] And we could even talk to each other through the machine.

[06:24] It's kind of crazy that you've got this ginormous

[06:28] seven to $13,000 piece of technology

[06:32] that's hooked up to the internet.

[06:34] And we can't use it to sort of communicate video and voice,

[06:38] which is the easiest thing to do

[06:41] when you're connected using the internet to somebody.

[06:43] But look, this stuff is not what we really, really want.

[06:46] Like at the end of the day, what everybody really wants

[06:49] and what everybody is really craving

[06:52] is something that is magical.

[06:55] We want a theme we really want.

[06:58] We want to look down at a game

[06:59] and really see something special

[07:02] and we want something that justifies these high prices.

[07:05] Whether or not there's a price increase,

[07:08] we shall see.

[07:09] I was hearing it was gonna be $600, we shall see.

[07:13] Look, if that doesn't happen and I'm wrong,

[07:16] all of you are gonna be happy.

[07:18] And I hope I'm wrong and I hope you're happy.

[07:21] I don't wanna see price increases.

[07:23] Will it be D&D or King Kong?

[07:25] Now that I know that Spike 3 isn't gonna be launched

[07:29] with a title that you're gonna see it sort of slowly rolled out

[07:34] across the 2025 releases,

[07:36] that's the other thing, people.

[07:38] You might just see bits and pieces of it,

[07:40] like a running introduction of it.

[07:43] And before you know it, it's just the guts

[07:45] of what's gonna be in Stern machines moving forward.

[07:48] And they might just slowly put in one organ at a time.

[07:52] And so now knowing that, I don't feel nearly as confident

[07:57] that it's gonna be King Kong

[07:59] because they need the big gorilla

[08:01] to show us the big new platform.

[08:04] Because there's no such thing as a big new platform now.

[08:07] I do think it is gonna be Dungeons & Dragons

[08:10] and King Kong as the next two titles.

[08:13] If the rumor is that they're working on something

[08:15] truly ambitious for Dungeons & Dragons

[08:19] and it wasn't ready yet, then maybe it is King Kong.

[08:23] Look, it's a 50-50 thing.

[08:24] There's no third mystery title.

[08:26] The only third mystery title that it could be

[08:29] might be Fallout.

[08:31] Now look, is Dungeons & Dragons just a codename for Fallout?

[08:37] I was thinking about that.

[08:38] Because Fallout is a show about a video game

[08:41] and a post-apocalyptic future

[08:44] in which they all live underground.

[08:46] So you could maybe think that's a metaphor for Dungeons.

[08:50] Maybe, right?

[08:51] Just maybe.

[08:52] It's the same way we thought Pokemon,

[08:54] Gotta Catch em All was maybe a metaphor for X-Men,

[08:58] that you gotta catch all the X-Men

[09:00] if you're Professor Xavier.

[09:03] So that is all happening really soon.

[09:05] The good news is this everybody, if I were all of you,

[09:07] let me just give you some advice.

[09:08] Don't buy anything right now.

[09:10] Don't buy anything.

[09:11] There's no point in buying a Metallica remastered premium.

[09:13] They're gonna make those for years.

[09:15] There's no point in going in on an X-Men now.

[09:17] Those prices continue to go down.

[09:20] Jack has been missing from the thread

[09:22] and that's bumming people out, right?

[09:23] It's almost making it look like

[09:25] he doesn't wanna be a part of the conversation on pin side.

[09:28] I know he cares more than anybody about this game.

[09:31] He is tirelessly working behind the scenes

[09:34] to make this game as good as he can.

[09:36] And I almost understand why he's not on pin side.

[09:40] It's just gonna be relentless and he can't win

[09:44] and he can't make changes to the game fast enough

[09:48] to satiate a real time forum

[09:51] that has all these anonymous people,

[09:53] many of which don't even own his game,

[09:55] complaining about his game.

[09:57] So there's that.

[09:59] Now as I look at this Metallica remastered

[10:01] and these Sparky heads are flying off

[10:04] because they are glued on.

[10:07] And you know, that visual of just a headless,

[10:10] decapitated Sparky on the play field,

[10:13] on these expensive Stern machines.

[10:16] It's another thing that just makes me feel so deflated

[10:19] for the company because you never wanna see that.

[10:23] You never wanna see with all the money,

[10:26] all the engineering, all the time to make this game,

[10:29] how John Borg thought that it was a good idea

[10:32] to use a hot glue gun to attach the Sparky head.

[10:36] The other game it was engineered

[10:38] so it was screwed into the body.

[10:41] What this shows everybody, again,

[10:43] it just shows that these games,

[10:45] like they're really not doing

[10:48] the quality control testing that they should.

[10:52] I was just in the Metallica thread

[10:54] and now everyone's talking about

[10:56] how to fix the drop targets.

[10:58] Like you gotta fix the springs on them

[11:00] to make them operate right.

[11:02] The hammer in the game.

[11:03] If you love that hammer in Metallica

[11:06] and the original game, the whole point of that hammer,

[11:09] the whole magic of the hammer is the hammer

[11:11] is supposed to come down

[11:13] and smash the ball through the play field.

[11:16] That is why the hammer is so cool

[11:18] and it creates that magical illusion

[11:21] that it has smashed the ball through the play field

[11:24] but it's actually holding the ball inside the hammer.

[11:27] Now, that magic trick, that whole moment of wow,

[11:31] doesn't happen in the new game

[11:33] because the new hammer, the new hammer sculpt is too thick

[11:37] so the hammer doesn't go all the way down to the play field,

[11:41] it doesn't even go close to the play field

[11:43] so it stops short.

[11:45] And so how did that even become a thing?

[11:47] How is that improving upon the old game?

[11:50] And I think that's a major, major mistake

[11:54] on the part of John Borg.

[11:55] How can you say you improve these mechs

[11:58] if you remove some of the magic from the mechs?

[12:01] And so the lesson for all of this people

[12:04] is if you buy right away, I mean, look,

[12:06] the Metallica LE buyers were smart.

[12:08] Your games are worth a lot of money.

[12:10] At the height, they were going for $18,000, $19,000.

[12:14] They won't stay that high.

[12:15] Everybody knows that.

[12:16] They will not stay that high.

[12:18] As more and more Metallica premiums get out there,

[12:21] it's the same exact game.

[12:23] People are gonna add the expression lighting.

[12:25] They're gonna add better translates.

[12:27] They're gonna make their premiums look nice.

[12:30] And in the end, everyone's got the same game.

[12:32] Just something about the newness

[12:34] and that's got everybody excited,

[12:36] but it's gonna hold value.

[12:37] Absolutely, Metallica LE will hold value.

[12:39] I don't think you'll ever see one for below $13,000

[12:42] the way things are going,

[12:43] but I don't think you're gonna have to pay $18,000

[12:46] now that they're gonna be opened up.

[12:47] And look, there's always gonna be people who buy the game

[12:50] based on the hype and the FOMO

[12:52] and Metallica is not their favorite band

[12:55] and they will look to move on.

[12:56] So that's Stern Pimball.

[12:58] Lots happening.

[12:59] I've spent too much time talking about Stern.

[13:02] All right, let's go over to Jersey Jack Pimball.

[13:04] Not a lot of news with JJP.

[13:07] Avatar continues to be a game

[13:09] where every time I talk to people about playing it,

[13:12] everyone's like, eh, it's kind of just

[13:14] like a shoulder shrug experience.

[13:16] I think the game is a total miss.

[13:18] You know how I feel about it.

[13:20] The UV light doesn't really work.

[13:22] It absolutely does not work on location.

[13:24] Everyone who ordered a $15,000 CE,

[13:28] you've all lost $5,000.

[13:31] You do know it, right?

[13:32] I always say like, you don't know it yet,

[13:34] you should know it.

[13:35] You're not gonna get anywhere near $15,000.

[13:37] And I don't think it's a game

[13:38] that's gonna be bolted to your game room floor.

[13:40] And here's why.

[13:42] The game's not gonna make you feel great.

[13:43] I mean this.

[13:44] The game is just soulless.

[13:47] It just has no emotion, no energy.

[13:51] There's no passion when you play that game.

[13:54] It's not gonna excite you.

[13:55] And if you love Pimball,

[13:57] there are much better Jersey Jack Pimball machines

[14:00] that are much more exciting.

[14:02] I think there's much better JJP machines

[14:04] that shoot better, that have better modes,

[14:07] that get you going.

[14:08] So you have to be the most die-hard Avatar fan

[14:11] on the planet.

[14:13] And again, the movies themselves

[14:15] have turned into sort of soulless journeys.

[14:18] Like we don't care about them.

[14:20] Those films really don't make you dream.

[14:22] You're not repeating lines from those movies.

[14:25] It was a bad theme selection.

[14:27] The game has been integrated poorly in my honest opinion.

[14:30] I saw the new code.

[14:31] The clips still do not sync up with the movie.

[14:34] And the UV moments in the game just don't work well.

[14:38] So all eyes will be on Jersey Jack's next game.

[14:42] The two rumors are we're gonna see

[14:44] Eric Minier's Harry Potter sometime in February, March,

[14:48] which would be really big for this company.

[14:50] And it's gonna be a wide body.

[14:52] And we're also gonna see Steve Ritchie's The Matrix,

[14:55] which will also be a wide body.

[14:57] It will have guns on the slings

[14:59] like Star Trek The Next Generation.

[15:01] And so I think Jersey Jack is gonna get back on track.

[15:05] Right now, the last few games, they've been barren.

[15:08] The games have been empty since Toy Story.

[15:10] You could argue the games have been empty

[15:11] since Guns N' Roses, I mean that.

[15:13] Like lift a Guns N' Roses play field.

[15:15] There's not a lot underneath it.

[15:17] Guns N' Roses does a good job of deceiving you

[15:21] that there's a lot in it mechanically,

[15:23] but there's really not a lot of toys.

[15:25] There's like no toys either in Guns N' Roses.

[15:28] And yes, it shouldn't have a lot of toys.

[15:30] I think Guns N' Roses executes perfectly for what it is,

[15:33] but it's still the moment they were like taking a lot out.

[15:36] And then you get to Toy Story empty.

[15:38] Godfather empty, Elton John empty.

[15:41] And so I think we're gonna get back

[15:44] to a lot more stuff being in these games.

[15:47] I think they've heard the feedback.

[15:49] But the one thing missing from Jersey Jack games,

[15:52] now that they've got the flipper feel good.

[15:55] They've got great artwork.

[15:56] They've got the most beautiful lighting,

[15:58] the most beautiful display,

[16:00] the most beautiful cabinet decals.

[16:02] The one thing all of their games are missing.

[16:05] And everybody over there should sit down and hear me out.

[16:09] And I mean this, I think this is a Keith Johnson,

[16:12] Joe Katz issue.

[16:14] These games are missing soul.

[16:18] They are missing soul.

[16:19] I know it's hard to explain,

[16:21] but there's something about the way they code their games

[16:25] and the experience just being too numb for the player.

[16:29] And I think they need to figure out,

[16:31] and I mean this, from the moment you hit the start button,

[16:34] how to put more soul and energy

[16:37] and moments of wow into these games

[16:40] and how to make it so the journey to get to those moments

[16:44] that showcase the soul and the heart of a game,

[16:48] they need to figure out a way to do it.

[16:51] That's not overly complicated.

[16:53] That doesn't throw too many multi-balls at you.

[16:56] So you're just randomly flailing to try to activate

[17:00] some of those moments of wow.

[17:01] They need to really figure that out.

[17:04] Cause even on my guns and roses, I have to be honest,

[17:06] I'm not a terrible pinball player.

[17:08] When I had Batman, I saw the entire game

[17:12] and I saw it like at least a few times a month.

[17:14] On three ball, guns and roses with all the out lane drains

[17:18] and all the patches and all the things you have to do

[17:21] and all the qualifying of all the albums

[17:23] and all the spinning of the slash record,

[17:26] there's just almost no way you can see much in that game.

[17:29] If you're only on three balls

[17:32] unless you're throwing your machine around the room

[17:34] and you're really, really good at pinball,

[17:37] and I'm gonna tell you this,

[17:38] I put my guns and roses on five ball

[17:40] and I lower the out lane posts

[17:42] and I'm having so much more fun playing the game.

[17:45] On every level, I'm seeing so much more of the game.

[17:48] And even on that, it's still really difficult

[17:51] to get far into the game.

[17:52] All right, so that's Jersey Jack pinball.

[17:55] Let's go over to Spooky pinball.

[17:57] Spooky's having a great week.

[17:58] They had a great stream.

[17:59] I believe it was last night.

[18:01] I looked at some of it.

[18:03] The Insanity mode is the one they've been hyping.

[18:06] Where everything goes crazy, it's really cool.

[18:08] All the mechs are laughing at you.

[18:10] The doors are flapping up and down,

[18:12] making fun of Canada, watching them play that mode,

[18:15] really fun.

[18:16] Again, as I watch the stream of Evil Dead,

[18:18] if you love Evil Dead, you're gonna love this game.

[18:21] If you don't love Evil Dead, I can't see you buying one.

[18:25] I mean, it's all in on the theme and they do it so well.

[18:28] There is just nothing about Evil Dead I really want.

[18:32] And if Spooky pinball has around the corner,

[18:35] Goonies pinball with a humongous pirate ship

[18:39] and it has the original Goonies movie

[18:42] and all that fun and campiness and nostalgia, yes,

[18:45] that's the kind of game that I would be much more likely

[18:49] to call them up and say put Canada at the top of the list.

[18:53] Right now, I think everyone's just excited

[18:55] to get their Evil Deads.

[18:57] The showing of the game has been great.

[18:59] The vibe in the thread has been terrific

[19:02] and the communication between the company

[19:05] and its customers has been stellar.

[19:07] Now thinking about terrible communication

[19:10] between company and customers,

[19:12] let's go to Chicago Gaming Company.

[19:14] I understand the L.E.s are finally making their way overseas.

[19:18] I still think that it's just a day late and a dollar short.

[19:23] The game is what it is.

[19:25] Yes, maybe I was blowing out of proportion

[19:28] the issues with the topper and the speaker grill.

[19:31] Maybe I am holding a grudge against this company

[19:34] and I don't care.

[19:36] I will never buy a game from Chicago Gaming Company

[19:40] solely based on how they treat their customers.

[19:44] That's it.

[19:45] That's where I draw the line.

[19:47] With so many pinball companies,

[19:49] I would like there to be much better treatment

[19:52] between company and customers.

[19:55] And I think you respect your customers

[19:57] when you don't reveal a game

[19:59] that you can't get to them for two years.

[20:01] You respect your customers when you have monthly updates.

[20:05] I mean, just think about it for a minute.

[20:06] Canada gives you, and I'm not even a pinball company,

[20:08] I give you updates about what's happening

[20:11] in the world of pinball three times a week,

[20:14] maybe four sometimes.

[20:16] Now imagine if I had a pinball company

[20:18] with millions of dollars on the line

[20:20] and I've got your money

[20:22] and you're waiting for the product

[20:23] that I'm supposed to deliver to you

[20:26] and I go radio silent, not for days,

[20:28] not for weeks, not for months, for years.

[20:31] I absolutely do nothing to talk to you.

[20:34] I mean, what is Josh Sharp doing?

[20:36] Like what are the folks over at Play Mechanics doing?

[20:38] Where's Mark Ritchie?

[20:39] Nothing to say?

[20:41] And if they think they're gonna march in

[20:43] with their follow-up game, which is Halo,

[20:47] and anyone's gonna care or go in on it, I don't think so.

[20:51] I think a lot of us are starting to feel

[20:54] like all these games are overpriced

[20:56] and now the intangibles matter a lot.

[20:59] The variables, like communication, like transparency,

[21:04] you wanna buy from a company you feel good about supporting.

[21:07] Do you feel good about supporting Chicago Gaming Company?

[21:11] They make so much money through Churchill cabinets.

[21:14] They seemingly act like they don't even care

[21:17] nor need this money.

[21:18] And when you buy a game from Spooky Pinball,

[21:20] doesn't it make you feel like

[21:22] you're putting Christmas gifts under the tree

[21:25] for these great gentlemen over there?

[21:28] All the hardworking people at Spooky

[21:30] that they show us that we meet,

[21:32] that when you buy from them,

[21:34] you're making their dreams come true

[21:36] and they're trying to make your dream come true

[21:38] with a great pinball machine.

[21:40] That's a really good relationship to have.

[21:43] It's a really good vibe to have.

[21:45] And it's a really good reason

[21:48] why these pinball companies should take notice

[21:51] in a world of all this parody

[21:53] and all these expensive games and so many pinball companies,

[21:57] it's gonna be the company that makes you feel good

[21:59] about supporting them that survives

[22:02] what's about to happen in pinball,

[22:05] which is the oversupply of everything,

[22:07] the collapse of pricing which is coming

[22:10] and everyone's at a room.

[22:12] So the only things that are gonna win

[22:14] are truly magical machines or companies

[22:18] that make you feel truly good about supporting them.

[22:21] And right now I honestly don't think CGC

[22:24] is understanding any of that.

[22:26] All right, wow, Canada, happy Friday, Canada.

[22:29] Are you in a holiday mood or what?

[22:31] All right, let's go on to the next company, Dutch Pinball.

[22:34] So as of today, the deal between Dutch and stern pinball

[22:37] on Back to the Future is not dead.

[22:39] Before we get there, I have heard that Alice's Adventures

[22:42] in Wonderland is still on track to be made in January.

[22:47] So we should see that line going in just a few weeks.

[22:50] So hopefully that happens.

[22:52] That's what I've been told, we shall see.

[22:54] As you know, I'm friends with Melvin,

[22:57] I'm friends with Barry, I would love for them

[22:59] to get this game on the line

[23:01] when they said it's gonna be on the line

[23:03] and I won't go after them until I see otherwise.

[23:06] Now, Back to the Future, the deal is not dead.

[23:09] Stern Pinball still wants this machine.

[23:11] They wanna help Barry make this machine.

[23:13] They wanna create a win-win with this title.

[23:17] Here's the latest, everybody.

[23:19] I'm here to tell you right now.

[23:20] If Stern Pinball and Barry can reach a deal,

[23:22] Keith Elwin will make this game.

[23:25] You will get a Keith Elwin Back to the Future

[23:28] and you will get all of Stern's best coding team on it.

[23:32] They will make the art package look much better

[23:34] than Barry's art package looks right now

[23:36] with just the logo on the side.

[23:38] You know, the way he just slapped

[23:39] the big Lebowski logo on the side.

[23:41] But no deal is done.

[23:43] And I know Barry wants as much money as possible.

[23:46] But also, Barry, come on.

[23:47] You can only make like 10 or 15 games a week, Barry.

[23:50] 10 or 15 a week.

[23:51] These guys can make five to 800 a week

[23:54] and you can get some money on every single one.

[23:56] And I think if you know Barry, I mean this.

[23:58] If you know Barry and now you know

[24:01] that Back to the Future could be a Keith Elwin game

[24:04] and Barry and Dutch Pinball

[24:06] could be the executive producers on the game.

[24:09] Their names would be on every single unit.

[24:12] Everybody would love them forever.

[24:14] Barry, I mean it.

[24:15] If you want people to love you,

[24:18] they will love you because you saw the greatest way

[24:23] to give the community the best version

[24:26] of Back to the Future possible.

[24:27] Now look, I know there's people out there

[24:30] that think Dutch Pinball, you know, looking at Lebowski

[24:33] can make a better version of Back to the Future than Stern.

[24:37] I understand why you would think that,

[24:39] but here's my thing.

[24:41] I would tend to agree with you if,

[24:43] and I mean this, if Barry has made more

[24:47] than one machine in 12 years, right?

[24:50] And then we've got Keith Elwin as the alternative.

[24:53] The best pinball designer maybe of all time,

[24:57] especially of modern times.

[24:59] And we know that Back to the Future is a dream theme.

[25:02] We know that George Gomez regrets

[25:04] not just securing that license

[25:07] because he listened to a Gen Z focus group

[25:09] who probably wanted to make Hannah Montana.

[25:12] And so here we have the greatest designer of all time,

[25:15] wants to make what would be the greatest pinball theme

[25:18] in the last 20 years,

[25:20] and Barry would make a bunch of money

[25:22] for not even having to do much other than getting paid

[25:25] for securing such a good contract.

[25:28] To me, that's a win-win.

[25:29] To me, that's a win-win.

[25:30] To me, where things fall apart

[25:32] is Barry wants to make it on his own,

[25:35] and I get why you want to do it, Barry,

[25:37] but then what happens, right?

[25:38] The game's not far enough into development

[25:40] as it is right now.

[25:42] And then the real issue is this, and Barry, you know this.

[25:45] What happens when you get,

[25:48] what happens when,

[25:50] what happens when 8,000 people want the game?

[25:53] We know what the only way out is.

[25:54] The only way to lower that much demand

[25:57] is to raise the price.

[25:59] And if he only wants to make a few thousand,

[26:01] because he can only make a few thousand in like five years,

[26:04] you know you're looking at a 15,000 plus game,

[26:08] and is that really a win-win

[26:10] to get back to the future into the hands

[26:12] of the pinball-loving community?

[26:14] So we'll see what happens there.

[26:16] I think he's gonna have to make up his mind sooner or later.

[26:20] Next year is the anniversary year of Back to the Future,

[26:23] the 40th anniversary of the movie.

[26:26] So whoever's doing something,

[26:28] hopefully is doing something now.

[26:30] All right, who we missing?

[26:31] Turner, pinball.

[26:32] I don't know if games are going out yet.

[26:34] I think they might be.

[26:35] Turner, nothing to say other than, you know,

[26:37] Chris sold his 100 games,

[26:39] and we look forward to seeing what he does next.

[26:42] Barrel's a fun.

[26:43] Let's talk about them,

[26:43] because I played Labyrinth, okay game.

[26:46] Theme did nothing for me.

[26:49] You know, it's kind of like one of those games

[26:50] where you play it, and if you don't love the theme,

[26:54] you're sort of not really sure what you're doing there

[26:57] in front of the machine.

[26:58] I mean it.

[26:59] It's just not a machine that's gonna pull you in

[27:01] if you don't love the theme.

[27:03] Yeah, and I think that's it.

[27:04] I mean, that's my feelings on it.

[27:06] I like the guys over there.

[27:08] I like that they did this as their first game.

[27:11] They now need a theme that people want more.

[27:13] They now need a theme that gets people much more excited,

[27:16] and this is just not the theme for me.

[27:19] And this is another company

[27:20] where there are new games coming out sometime soon.

[27:23] I mean, we're looking at early spring,

[27:25] so I think you're gonna see this game right around TPF

[27:29] or right after TPF.

[27:31] And I thought it was Goonies.

[27:32] I thought it was Goonies,

[27:34] and I don't think it's Goonies now anymore.

[27:36] Maybe it is Gremlins.

[27:38] I don't know what it is.

[27:39] I hope it is something that really is nostalgic

[27:43] and gets people excited.

[27:45] All right, who else are we missing in the world of Pimbal?

[27:48] American Pimbal, Cuphead.

[27:50] Are we gonna see it?

[27:51] Nobody knows, nobody knows.

[27:53] There's no momentum around this Cuphead launch.

[27:55] I don't know, at this point,

[27:57] it's just never gonna be able to live up

[27:59] to any of the expectations,

[28:01] which are almost non-existent to begin with.

[28:03] Again, there's just too many people

[28:05] executing too well right now, and it is a shame.

[28:09] They've had like four years now under new leadership.

[28:13] They should be much more successful by now,

[28:16] and that's all I'm gonna say.

[28:18] You know how I feel.

[28:19] You only get so many swings at the plate

[28:22] before you need a hit, and they need a hit.

[28:25] And so if this game's a hit, they need to get it out,

[28:27] and it's just that simple.

[28:29] All right, Multimorphic.

[28:30] Are people getting these Princess Brides

[28:33] with the swords attached to the cabinets?

[28:35] I still don't think people have them.

[28:37] I still don't think people have them.

[28:39] They're trickling games out.

[28:41] Jerry's gonna keep doing this.

[28:43] I mean, it's like, I don't really have any,

[28:46] I don't have any strong feelings about it either way.

[28:49] When I play this game at shows, I have a good time,

[28:52] but the reason I have a good time,

[28:54] I'm just gonna say this,

[28:55] the reason I have a good time playing Multimorphic games

[28:58] is because I know I'm not gonna buy it.

[29:01] It's like my holiday party last night.

[29:03] I went to our company holiday party,

[29:05] and I had a good time drinking the two cocktails

[29:08] that were on the menu.

[29:09] I didn't really like them, but I enjoyed them

[29:12] because I knew I didn't have to pay for them.

[29:14] And that's how I feel about Multimorphic.

[29:16] It's like, I always have a good time playing them at shows,

[29:19] but not, not in a million years, if they're like,

[29:21] okay, cool, Chris, do you like it enough

[29:23] to spend 10 to $13,000 on one?

[29:26] Absolutely not.

[29:27] And then every time I see people trying to sell

[29:29] their Multimorphic with all their kits,

[29:32] and they're like $20,000 plus in on all those kits,

[29:36] they can't even get like $13,000 back for it all.

[29:39] No thank you, no thank you, no thank you.

[29:42] And I still can't get over on the platform

[29:45] those two flipper buttons that are just not what you do.

[29:50] Like no other game with multiple flippers

[29:53] requires you to play that way, and it's just awkward.

[29:57] And the reason they do it is they know

[29:59] because like the coils heat up, it's just weird,

[30:02] the whole thing is weird, to me the whole thing is weird.

[30:05] It's like Jerry legitimately could have made

[30:08] millions of dollars more if he just made

[30:12] a normal pinball machine, and he knows that.

[30:14] And he refuses to test that out, and that's just weird.

[30:17] You know, you're in pinball, you have to be in business

[30:20] for profit, I get he has a dream,

[30:24] but at some point don't you just wake up

[30:26] and you're tired of seeing like Scott Denisi

[30:29] just make a basic awesome pin and outsell you.

[30:32] You'll see all these other companies

[30:33] just make basic pins and outsell you.

[30:36] You're not listening to the target audience,

[30:37] like you think you know what they want

[30:40] more than they're telling you what they want,

[30:42] and to me that's multi-morphic in a nutshell.

[30:45] It's also like a solution in search of a problem.

[30:48] Even though people are out of space,

[30:50] nobody wants swappable playfields,

[30:52] it's just not what we want.

[30:54] Because as most of you know,

[30:56] half of what we love about pinball machines

[30:59] is that they are a work of art.

[31:01] And when you walk by your games, even when they're off,

[31:05] they look spectacular.

[31:07] The colors, the playfield, the artwork, the detail,

[31:10] and when you walk by a multi-morphic machine

[31:13] when it's off and it's just a black screen,

[31:16] yeah, not appealing, doesn't look good.

[31:19] It took Jerry almost 10 years to even put artwork

[31:23] on the front of the machines that are pitch black.

[31:26] Right, 10 years, you can't walk by a machine

[31:28] and be like, that doesn't look good.

[31:29] Who am I missing in the world of pinball?

[31:31] Did I cover everybody, Brenda?

[31:33] Who am I missing?

[31:34] Who am I missing?

[31:35] I think I got everybody.

[31:37] You know what I just realized?

[31:38] Like I'm missing all these European companies.

[31:40] I'm missing Padready Gaming, I'm missing Pinball Brothers,

[31:44] I'm missing Home Pin over in Australia.

[31:47] Let me just summarize all these together.

[31:49] Like I'm gonna group them all together.

[31:51] Like if you think about it, Pinball Brothers,

[31:53] do they have anything that's exciting us right now?

[31:56] No, they do not.

[31:57] Padready Gaming, no they do not.

[32:00] These companies, if you ask me,

[32:03] I don't know what the future holds, I really don't.

[32:06] Like they just seem to be in it,

[32:08] but nothing they're making is of the same caliber

[32:12] of what's happening elsewhere.

[32:14] And if there are going to be tariffs

[32:16] on imports of products with this new presidency,

[32:21] I think these companies are gonna be in big trouble.

[32:24] Look, nothing exciting about this Funhouse remake

[32:26] that I wanna talk about,

[32:28] nothing exciting about ABBA that I wanna talk about.

[32:32] I guess the one thing I will mention is this.

[32:34] I heard the Pinball Brothers and this would excite me

[32:38] and this would make me order it.

[32:40] I heard they have Predator.

[32:43] I mean, that's what I'm hearing,

[32:44] that they have Arnold Schwarzenegger's Predator

[32:48] as a title coming out.

[32:50] Now look, I'm gonna tell you this right now.

[32:53] I love that movie, I've seen that movie like a thousand times.

[32:56] If Pinball Brothers makes Predator,

[33:00] that machine will make its way into my house.

[33:03] And I'm looking at Brenda right now,

[33:04] I will put it somewhere, you know, go in the garage,

[33:07] but I am absolutely 100% buying that on theme alone,

[33:10] on theme alone.

[33:11] I don't even care what they do with it.

[33:13] I don't care if they nerf it,

[33:14] I will just buy one and enjoy it,

[33:17] and then move it on if it's got no magic,

[33:19] but I would absolutely buy Site Unseen,

[33:23] a Predator Pinball machine.

[33:25] Please, somebody, look at stuff like Arnold's movies,

[33:28] look at stuff like Jean-Claude von Damme's Bloodsport.

[33:30] I mean, I'm telling you right now,

[33:32] more people would buy Bloodsport than Labyrinth.

[33:35] I'm serious, if they made Bloodsport,

[33:38] more people would have bought that than Labyrinth.

[33:40] These are men, grown men,

[33:42] putting these games into their game rooms, okay?

[33:44] The majority of us grew up on more of von Damme

[33:47] than watching David Bowie with his bulge

[33:50] and these little like muppets popping around this Labyrinth.

[33:54] I'm serious, everybody, have a great day,

[33:56] we'll talk to you soon.

[33:57] I am C.A.

[33:59] And just go to the

[34:01] I am C.A.

[34:04] Damme, damme, I was once in your shoes.

[34:08] Damme, damme, I was down with the blues.
