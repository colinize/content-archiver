[00:00] I remember when this was all far man, as far as the eye could see.

[00:03] O man P body.

[00:04] On all of this, we had this crazy idea about breeding pine.

[00:09] Listen, sorry, I'm not any of those guys. I'm a kid from a trailer park.

[00:12] If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be.

[00:16] This is, this is, this is, my, my, my, my, my, etc.

[00:19] And what you're about to witness is one of the most sinister sounding intros to a trailer

[00:23] to one of the greatest ethics ever produced.

[00:26] Yee-ee!

[00:27] Intruches beware.

[00:29] Good evening.

[00:30] I'm Dr. David Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot at Spine Pine's Mall.

[00:33] Trushing death in grace.

[00:36] It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1980, 1980, 1985, 180 AF.

[00:40] So too, you're the lord of the trespassing fee.

[00:45] This is temporal experiment number one.

[00:47] You don't really know what's happening.

[00:49] Don't you? Well, taste, you don't know shit, but...

[00:52] Fuehler, black stone, black time, fueler, black skull, lift hand.

[00:58] This, this, this, this, this...

[01:01] You've become a man again.

[01:02] If you also loved it to be here, then that would have been a beautiful look.

[01:05] Give yourself a round of applause. You still loved it once again.

[01:08] Anyone?

[01:09] I'd like to give a big round of applause to my band.

[01:10] Anyone? Anyone?

[01:11] Sexual chocolate.

[01:12] Flight 209 or York Lear for takeoff?

[01:15] Roger.

[01:16] Huh?

[01:17] The terminators of infiltration units.

[01:18] Parkman Park Machine.

[01:20] L.A. depart your frequency.

[01:21] One, two, three, point, nine.

[01:23] Roger.

[01:24] Underneath, it's a hyper-aligned combat chassis.

[01:27] Psycho-process of control.

[01:28] Fully armored.

[01:29] Very tough.

[01:30] Request vector over, but...

[01:32] And outside it's living human tissue.

[01:35] Flesh, skin, hair, blood, bone for the cyborg.

[01:39] Flight 209 or clear for vector 324.

[01:42] We have clearance, Pirates.

[01:43] Roger, Roger.

[01:44] What's our vector, Victor?

[01:45] If that's what you think.

[01:51] Then that's all you'll ever be.

[02:23] Don't do it.

[02:24] When you wanna come, be like, don't do it.

[02:28] When you wanna suck, don't do it.

[02:30] Relax.

[02:31] Don't do it.

[02:32] That's all.

[02:34] When you wanna come.

[02:38] When you wanna come.

[02:42] When you wanna come.

[02:47] Come.

[02:51] Huh.

[02:54] Huh.

[03:00] I need you tonight.

[03:04] Cause I'm not sleeping.

[03:08] There's something about you.

[03:12] It makes me sweat.

[03:20] I'm lonely.

[03:24] Can't think it out.

[03:28] Gonna live with us.

[03:32] I'm lonely.

[03:48] If you need a friend.

[03:51] You'll look to a stranger.

[03:55] You know in the end.

[04:00] I'll always be there.

[04:04] And when you're in doubt.

[04:08] And when you're in danger.

[04:12] Take a look all around.

[04:16] And I'll be there.

[04:21] I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the ride.

[04:24] Where's the promise?

[04:26] I know they don't sound the way I plan that to be me.

[04:30] But if you wait around the wall,

[04:32] I'll make you fall for me.

[04:34] I promise.

[04:35] I promise you I will.

[04:42] I will.

[04:46] I will.

[04:50] You were working as a waitress and I can't tell for.

[04:55] When I met you.

[04:58] I picked you out.

[05:00] I shook you up until you arrived.

[05:03] Until you went to someone new.

[05:06] And I'll find you later on.

[05:08] You've got the one at your feet.

[05:11] Success has been so easy for you.

[05:15] But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now.

[05:19] And I can put you back down too.

[05:27] You're acting.

[05:31] You're acting.

[05:40] There are endless silence.

[05:43] Looking round the crowd of new.

[05:48] I find myself alone again.

[05:52] All alone with you.

[05:56] I can see behind your eyes

[06:00] the things that I don't know.

[06:04] If you hide away from me,

[06:08] I can not not know.

[06:11] I want to know what you're thinking.

[06:15] That I'm a sun face you can't hide.

[06:19] I want to know what you're feeling.

[06:23] Tell me what's on your mind.

[06:45] You're all set shut.

[06:55] I cannot sleep by your obsession.

[07:06] I'm hoping that you'll feed.

[07:08] There's no balance.

[07:10] No equality.

[07:12] You still I will not accept it.

[07:16] I love you.

[07:18] Yes, I love you.

[07:20] I'll find you later on.

[07:24] I'll find myself alone again.

[07:28] I'll wait you and capture you.

[07:32] My calculations are correct.

[07:36] This baby is 38 miles per hour.

[07:39] I can see some serious shit.

[07:58] You're the small town girl.

[08:02] Ever in a lonely world.

[08:06] I'm hoping that you'll feed.

[08:14] You're the city boy.

[08:17] Going rain in some pit road.

[08:21] You're hoping that you'll feed.

[08:36] Every time I think of you, I feel a shot.

[08:40] I threw it above all the glue.

[08:43] It's no problem in mind that it's a problem I find.

[08:47] Living a life that I can't be behind.

[08:51] There's no sense in it's hurting me.

[08:55] Listen up and walk.

[09:00] There's no sense in it's hurting me.

[09:04] Listen up and walk.

[09:06] That's the way that it goes.

[09:09] And it's what nobody knows.

[09:12] Well, everything is my duty.

[09:15] When I die, you tell me you go to a time machine.

[09:19] If you're going to build a time machine, why not do it some style?

[09:23] Josie's on a vacation following.

[09:31] Cover it and tuck it over.

[09:34] So many things that I want to say.

[09:42] I just want to use your love tonight.

[09:48] I don't want to lose your love tonight.

[10:18] I'm in my heart.

[10:29] Sweet dreams are made of this.

[10:32] Who am I to disagree?
