[00:00] The whispers of the past are what I've heard about, and that's how we screw you on.

[00:05] A find out about you.

[00:09] A find out about you.

[00:12] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:16] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:20] Did you think you were gonna go a Friday and not get a show from Canada?

[00:24] It's almost the end of the month.

[00:26] May 30th, and all of us are waiting for Harry Potter.

[00:32] And now all of a sudden, after 10 years or 12 years of waiting for this title, we're

[00:39] gonna see the first images of Harry Potter Pinball Cabinet as advertisements within Avatar

[00:47] Pinball?

[00:48] Is this actually how this company is doing it?

[00:52] I'm looking at it right now.

[00:54] It's a picture of Harry and the other kids, and everyone's pointing wands, and it looks

[01:00] Photoshop, drag, and dropped.

[01:03] It doesn't look great.

[01:05] This is like the base level edition of the game, the $10,000 edition of the game, but

[01:10] I just want to say this.

[01:12] Tired of this?

[01:14] These pinball companies who have been teasing us for a really long time.

[01:20] This is the culmination of a dream come true.

[01:24] This is how Jersey Jack unveils the game for the first time in a pedestrian way.

[01:30] I'm just gonna say this right now.

[01:32] And I mean this.

[01:33] This is weird for me to say this, because some people are proclaiming this to be the second

[01:38] coming of pinball.

[01:39] I'm gonna say this right now.

[01:41] And I might have had a few tequila drinks in me, but it's just the way it goes on a

[01:45] Friday in this wealthy Connecticut town in which everybody here works in finance, can

[01:52] spend more money than I got on toys, watches, cars, and homes, and nobody cares about pinball.

[01:59] So I'm gonna say it right now.

[02:01] I think this game is gonna be the kiss of death for Jersey Jack.

[02:06] And what I mean by that is this.

[02:07] I can see it in the artwork.

[02:09] It's already Photoshop, drag, and drop artwork.

[02:12] It's Photoshop, drag, and drop.

[02:13] So you think that the other versions of the game are not gonna be the same sort of art

[02:19] look stylistically?

[02:21] I think it is.

[02:23] And I think this is the best they're gonna be able to do with the hands being tied behind

[02:29] the back of this company, because the license holder is really hard to work with.

[02:33] And this might be why Stern Pinball didn't want to work with Warner Brothers on this

[02:39] title.

[02:40] I think this game is gonna be the kiss of death.

[02:41] We're gonna see it in five days.

[02:43] But I'm just gonna go out on a Canada limb and say that I think when this game gets shown

[02:49] to the world, it's not gonna be like the magic they've been conjuring up.

[02:54] I think it's gonna be just, you know, a little bit more mediocre than you want.

[03:00] I think this game is gonna be like Godfather 2.0 more than it's gonna be like Pire to the

[03:06] Caribbean 2.0.

[03:07] I don't think it's gonna be Wizard of Oz 2.0.

[03:10] I think it's gonna be more like Avatar 2.0.

[03:14] I think it's gonna be more empty than loaded.

[03:17] I think it's gonna have like Photoshop looking drag and drop artwork.

[03:21] I don't think it's gonna look as good as a Frenchie pin.

[03:24] And I think there's not gonna be the level of loaded mechanical magic in this game as

[03:32] you want.

[03:33] Now, I haven't seen the game and maybe I'm feeling this way because I'm tired of this

[03:39] like drawn out launch of this game.

[03:43] This is bad marketing.

[03:45] The first time we're gonna see the cabinet artwork of the game is via an in-game advertisement

[03:55] in Avatar.

[03:57] This is what you've been waiting 12 years for Jersey Jack.

[04:01] I get we're gonna get the CE version.

[04:05] I get we're gonna get like the creme de la creme and this is the $10,000 pro version of

[04:11] the game.

[04:12] But just something about seeing like the older Harry and everybody just pointing their wands

[04:19] and it's more Photoshop drag and drop.

[04:22] I'm just telling you right now if I were a betting man, I would bet that this game is

[04:28] gonna underwhelm you.

[04:30] It's not gonna be the second coming of pinball.

[04:33] And I think it's gonna be an interesting launch in five days.

[04:37] I'm also just like, is this how they wanted to launch like the first images of the game?

[04:42] These are the first images of the game.

[04:45] Literally just popping up randomly as an advertisement in a game that nobody wanted.

[04:51] This ads also appearing in guns and roses.

[04:54] It's appearing on any JJP machine that is somewhat connected to the internet.

[04:59] This is like the teaser.

[05:01] This is what you're doing to get people excited.

[05:04] I'm gonna tell you right now.

[05:05] The reason why I think this game is gonna be mediocre is I think Jersey Jack just doesn't

[05:11] get it.

[05:12] I don't think they get it.

[05:13] I don't think they get how to market stuff.

[05:15] I don't think they have the creative leader over there like George Gomez.

[05:20] I keep saying George Gomez, but I even got to stop saying that.

[05:23] But I just don't feel like this company has anybody over there that's like, no, this isn't

[05:30] how we should be doing it.

[05:32] No.

[05:33] We shouldn't be putting these two lower playfields in Avatar.

[05:36] No.

[05:37] We shouldn't even be making Avatar.

[05:38] No.

[05:39] We shouldn't even be making the Godfather.

[05:41] No.

[05:42] We shouldn't even be doing only Toy Story 4.

[05:44] Why do we think that a company that has made bad decisions for like four to five, six,

[05:52] seven, you could say they've made bad decisions for 12 years in a row?

[05:57] Why do we feel like all of a sudden now is the time?

[06:02] Now is the time they're going to make everything right.

[06:05] They're going to nail it now.

[06:07] They're going to get the artwork right this time.

[06:10] They're going to get the code right this time.

[06:12] It's not going to come with some diner menu from Keith Johnson with 22 song notes from

[06:18] Avatar.

[06:19] This is the time they're going to get it.

[06:21] They're not going to have muted clips this time around.

[06:25] You actually think they're going to get synced up clips with all of the actors from eight

[06:31] movies.

[06:32] They're going to get eight movies.

[06:33] You think they're actually going to get it now when they didn't even sync up clips from

[06:39] one Toy Story movie.

[06:41] They didn't sync up clips from two Avatar movies.

[06:45] Think about this for many people.

[06:46] They didn't sync up clips from two Avatar movies, but they're going to sync up clips

[06:52] from eight Harry Potter movies.

[06:55] Are you actually delusional or do you think this is the one?

[07:01] Now look, I'm being overly strident right now.

[07:05] I'm being overly pessimistic.

[07:08] And again, it's because when I see a company that is apparently supposedly has a marketing

[07:15] plan in place, this could not be how they wanted people to see the game or the cabinet

[07:22] for the first time.

[07:24] And yet it is.

[07:25] And it just goes to show.

[07:26] I just feel like as big as they are, as long as they've been doing this in the pinball

[07:32] world, it's still a company that is kind of rudderless, that doesn't really get it.

[07:39] And so I hope this game proves me wrong, but I'm going to tell you right now, I think in

[07:44] five days or whatever the hours and minutes are, I think when we finally see Harry Potter,

[07:52] it's going to be underwhelming.

[07:53] And I don't think it's going to be loaded.

[07:55] And I don't think they've been conjuring up the next Wizard of Oz or Pirates or a Hobbit

[08:02] game.

[08:03] I think they've been conjuring up Godfather 2.0.

[08:07] And I hope I'm wrong.

[08:08] I hope in five days, whatever, 16 hours, 27 minutes, I'm doing a podcast that is like

[08:16] this game blew me away.

[08:19] Now here's the other thing.

[08:21] So we've got this game coming out next week.

[08:25] And we've got pinball brothers sharing with us nothing but meme teasers of Predator.

[08:32] Jim Hopper's mailbox was put up yesterday, right?

[08:36] Jim Hopper, he wasn't killed, he was skinned alive.

[08:39] These guys waited too long.

[08:41] And I've seen the Jengas video, he's gushing about spinners and drop targets.

[08:47] But how stupid can you be?

[08:48] I mean, just think about it for a minute.

[08:49] How stupid can you be to not get out in front of Harry Potter?

[08:54] And so what?

[08:55] They're just going to put up these teasers and then after Jersey Jack reveals Harry Potter.

[09:01] Look, gang, I could be right and Harry Potter could be underwhelming.

[09:05] It doesn't matter.

[09:06] They're going to sell at least, and I mean this, this game could be terrible.

[09:12] And they're going to sell at least 5,000 units of this game at least.

[09:18] It doesn't matter.

[09:19] The theme is that big.

[09:20] And then you're going to wait until all that money is absorbed by your potential buyer base.

[09:27] And then you're going to release Predator?

[09:30] Idiotic.

[09:31] Idiotic.

[09:32] These guys are idiotic.

[09:34] It is the worst move ever.

[09:36] And look, I've reached out to pinball brothers.

[09:38] I'm like, hey, can you give me something to get my audience excited about your Predator

[09:43] game?

[09:44] And you know what?

[09:45] No email back.

[09:47] No email back.

[09:48] So cool.

[09:49] Just keep putting up your stuff.

[09:51] You don't have a release date.

[09:53] And now we've got a release date for Harry Potter.

[09:56] And you're not going to be out in front of it.

[09:59] And you're going to get clobbered now because thousands of orders are going to go towards

[10:05] Harry Potter.

[10:06] Thousands of people bought King Kong.

[10:09] People bought Dune.

[10:10] People bought all the other games.

[10:12] Like 888 people have to pay for Evil Dead.

[10:16] It's just like, guys, wake up.

[10:19] Wake up.

[10:21] It's not hard.

[10:23] But you don't want to follow Harry Potter if you're the pinball brothers.

[10:28] OK?

[10:29] We're all there, right?

[10:30] We're all there.

[10:31] Now look, I just want to say I don't know what Harry Potter is going to be.

[10:34] I hope Eric kills it.

[10:36] I hope Eric crushes it.

[10:38] I really do.

[10:39] Because when we think about what's happening in pinball right now and who the best designers

[10:44] are, I'm going to say this right now.

[10:46] I think the best designer in pinball, the best designer in all the pinball right now,

[10:52] it's not Keith Elwin.

[10:53] It's not.

[10:54] He's the second best.

[10:56] The best designer in all of pinball right now is Jack Danger.

[11:01] Without a doubt.

[11:02] Without a doubt.

[11:03] I've played every Keith Elwin game many, many times.

[11:08] And Jack Danger's two games, Foo Fighters and X-Men, to me, from a design and layout

[11:14] standpoint, are far more interesting than anything Keith Elwin has done.

[11:21] They're far more ambitious.

[11:23] They're far more unique.

[11:25] And he just hasn't had the banger themes that Keith Elwin has had.

[11:32] Think about it.

[11:33] Jack Danger got Foo Fighters and X-Men.

[11:36] Two themes that before they came out, nobody wanted.

[11:41] Like Keith Elwin has had Iron Maiden, Jurassic Freakin' Park, he's had Avengers, Godzilla,

[11:51] he's had Jaws and he's had King Kong.

[11:55] They've given him way more better themes than they've ever gave Jack Danger.

[12:00] And I'm going to tell you this right now.

[12:01] I think Jack Danger's next game is going to be it.

[12:07] I mean it.

[12:08] I don't even know what it is.

[12:09] We all thought it was Pokemon.

[12:10] But now the rumor is that Pokemon, Napsarcade is saying is that Pokemon is going to be a

[12:17] Keith Elwin game.

[12:20] And apparently Keith Elwin is a big Pokemon fan.

[12:23] I was talking to Jason about this.

[12:25] I'm like, how is that even possible?

[12:27] I'm 48.

[12:29] Keith Elwin is 53.

[12:33] How is he into Pokemon?

[12:35] I'm not even into Pokemon.

[12:37] So he was at an older age, really into Pokemon in the 90's.

[12:42] It doesn't make any sense to me.

[12:44] But that's what I'm hearing.

[12:46] Now I think the next game from Stern Pinball is everything.

[12:51] The next game from John Borg, the Star Wars pinball machine.

[12:57] It needs to be a hit.

[12:58] King Kong's not a hit.

[12:59] I'm in the thread.

[13:00] I get you guys are enjoying the pin.

[13:03] It's not a hit game though guys.

[13:06] It's not.

[13:07] But the L.E.s are still not sold out.

[13:09] That is embarrassing.

[13:10] And that is indicative of the overall demand for the game.

[13:14] I mean sometimes people just forget.

[13:16] In L.E. really needs to be popular to lift the other versions of the game.

[13:24] And if the L.E. doesn't sell out then you're in for a world of hurt.

[13:28] If you A-bought an L.E. and if you think your premium is going to hold value you're

[13:33] in for a world of hurt.

[13:35] And especially because I'm hearing in June we're going to get Jaws 50th.

[13:41] Now here's the rumor I'm hearing about Jaws 50th.

[13:44] And this doesn't make any sense.

[13:46] I'm hearing Stern Pinball is only going to make 750 Jaws 50th anniversary editions.

[13:55] I don't believe this rumor.

[13:56] I'll tell you why.

[13:57] Because George Gomez said they would never make another L.E. of a game that already had

[14:03] an L.E.

[14:05] Now if you make only 750 of Jaws 50th anniversary then that's an L.E.

[14:14] Not only that that's less machines than you made of the first version of Jaws L.E.

[14:21] So if they do this and again I don't think they're going to because I think they're going

[14:26] to stay true to their word but I'm nervous.

[14:29] I think here's what Stern might be feeling.

[14:33] King Kong didn't sell that well.

[14:35] Not as well as they wanted.

[14:38] And so now they've got this Jaws coming out and they're like well Jaws was a much better

[14:44] seller than King Kong and if we have a 50th anniversary edition and we make it unlimited

[14:53] that's not going to create any FOMO and so we need to somehow get that 750 times 11,000

[15:04] or 10,000 dollars because what is it like 9,800 for a premium but that's the thing is

[15:09] like what if they actually charged 13,000 for a Jaws L.E. 50th and then what happens?

[15:21] So I know what would happen is it would sell out like they would sell everyone.

[15:27] They would also burn in the process everybody who bought a Jaws L.E. where they made a thousand

[15:34] units with the white armor and I think what we're going to witness is a few things.

[15:39] I think we're going to witness if Stern is going to stay true to its word.

[15:44] I think we're going to witness if Stern is really in trouble because if they are in trouble

[15:50] and they are a wounded tiger company then they are absolutely maybe going to make another

[15:56] L.E. of Jaws as the 50th anniversary edition.

[16:00] I don't think they're going to do it.

[16:02] I think the rumor is false.

[16:03] I believe George Gomez.

[16:05] I believe him when he said we're never going to make another L.E. version of a game that

[16:10] already had an L.E. and let me clarify what I mean by that.

[16:14] It doesn't just mean that you're not going to make more of the same exact version of

[16:19] the L.E. that was released.

[16:22] It means you're never going to make another version of the theme that is limited the way

[16:27] they did with Elvira, the way they did with Jurassic Park.

[16:32] You can't just change the artwork and have another L.E. of the game because that destroys

[16:39] all of the collectability for all of the editions.

[16:42] I don't think they're ever going to do it again.

[16:44] I don't think so.

[16:45] I think that rumor is false.

[16:47] But I do think there's going to be a Jaws 50th.

[16:50] I think it's going to be a premium trim game.

[16:53] Remember, Godzilla 70th was a premium trim game.

[16:59] Godzilla 70th was supposed to be in L.E.

[17:04] It was supposed to be in L.E. new version of Godzilla.

[17:07] George Gomez told me privately, he said, I wish you could have seen the L.E. version

[17:13] of Godzilla 70th with the foil trim on everything.

[17:18] That's how we intended the game to look.

[17:22] And then they couldn't do it because they just burned so many people with all of these

[17:27] remakes of other L.E.s.

[17:30] So I think it's going to be a really interesting six weeks.

[17:35] We're going to see Harry Potter in a week.

[17:38] I can't wait.

[17:40] I know all of you can't wait.

[17:41] I'm sick of speculating about it.

[17:44] I'm sick of wondering about it.

[17:45] I just want to see the game.

[17:48] We're going to see Predator in the next six weeks.

[17:51] Pimbal Brothers waited too long, but it's still Predator, right?

[17:55] I just feel like in this age demographic, you girly men out there, don't you want Predator

[18:02] more than Harry Potter?

[18:04] I think so.

[18:05] And so we're going to get Predator, I think by June 12th, which is the day that the Predator

[18:10] movie came out.

[18:12] And it's just a lot.

[18:14] It's a lot of money to ask people to buy all these games.

[18:18] We got Dune People are Buying Games.

[18:20] We've got King Kong owners.

[18:22] We've got Predator.

[18:24] It's about to get crazy.

[18:26] Everybody, do me a favor.

[18:28] Wait and see.

[18:30] That is going to be who wins in all of this.

[18:33] Wait to see these games.

[18:35] Pull the trigger when you know you want it.

[18:38] Canada's Pimbal Podcast, thank you for being a member.

[18:41] The month is about to come to an end.

[18:44] And let me tell you, the next two months are going to be crazy.

[18:48] If you're not getting three shows a week right now, it's because there's not a lot to talk

[18:53] about.

[18:54] I'm not going to get on here and complain about tariffs and what's going to happen to

[18:58] Alice owners.

[18:59] We're going to talk all about this stuff.

[19:02] But trust me, next week it's going to be interesting.

[19:05] Canada out.
