[00:00] And the Blessed DJ, because the music they constantly play.

[00:06] Unbelievable sides, did you just slip down, the provincial towns in your crown.

[00:14] Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ.

[00:17] Sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up, sit-up.

[00:30] The Cyprus Hills Sunday night, I got way too much inebriated and I was hungover yesterday.

[00:35] So here we go.

[00:36] Tuesday morning, what do I want to talk about?

[00:39] I want to talk about where we go now.

[00:41] That pinball expo is over.

[00:43] The show came and went and we saw some new pinball machines but we didn't really get

[00:47] a surprise.

[00:48] Like, I thought American Pinball was going to come out and actually show us a little bit

[00:52] more about their new game.

[00:54] We're going to talk about that.

[00:56] We're going to talk about where this hobby is headed as we move into November and December

[01:01] of 2022.

[01:03] So here's the thing, I'm going to go around the horn.

[01:05] We're going to talk about what happened at expo, what we saw, where I think these companies

[01:10] are going to go in the marketplace of pinball.

[01:13] So let's start, obviously, with Stern Pinball and James Bond.

[01:16] I think this game is going to end up winning like all of the trippies for like best theme,

[01:21] best pinball machine.

[01:22] I'm not so sure it's going to deserve it.

[01:26] Most people won't even have a chance to play James Bond by the time the Twippy voting opens

[01:30] up.

[01:31] I think it's through December because we now know the timeframe for James Bond where

[01:35] it's like the pros are going to be on the line in like November and the Ellie's are not

[01:39] going on the line until December.

[01:42] Now this has been a really stretched out launch of this game.

[01:45] They clearly had to get the game out to hit the contractual obligation of the 60th anniversary

[01:50] of James Bond.

[01:52] We still don't know what the key to that one game is.

[01:54] We don't know how much it's going to cost.

[01:56] But here's my take on James Bond.

[01:58] I don't think because of its slow rollout, this game is ever going to really land in

[02:04] the pinball world the way Godzilla did.

[02:07] And I think Stern with Godzilla showed us all that they could do it, right?

[02:11] They could design a game and they could launch it for us so that the first week everybody

[02:16] is unboxing Godzilla's, everybody fell in love with the game.

[02:21] And there was so much in that game on day one that this feels like the old approach

[02:27] that Stern used to do where they would launch a game.

[02:30] You don't know it's great yet.

[02:32] You know how it shoots but you're not sure about the final code in the game.

[02:37] And this is going to be very much like Stranger Things.

[02:39] I think James Bond is going to come out and I think you're going to have to wait a very

[02:43] long time for the code to be mature.

[02:45] And I think the days of living with that, right?

[02:48] The days of building the ship in the ocean.

[02:50] I think people have moved past it, especially at these prices.

[02:55] Who wants to spend this much money and not really know if the game is great or not?

[03:01] And look, do I think Stern's going to figure this game out?

[03:04] Yes.

[03:05] How long will it take?

[03:07] It's anybody's guess.

[03:08] There's a lot of content they got to work with.

[03:10] And we know that when you're dealing with like movie clips from like seven films, it's

[03:15] not easy to code a game with that much content.

[03:18] Especially since they have the rights to put a lot of that content on the screen.

[03:22] I think it's going to be a much slower burn than people realize.

[03:26] You know, and then so the question is for all of you out there, do you really want the game

[03:31] this early?

[03:32] Do you want to play this game so unfinished?

[03:35] If you ask me, I don't.

[03:36] I don't want to play a game like this anymore.

[03:38] I don't want to play a game that's only like 50% there.

[03:42] I don't.

[03:43] I really don't.

[03:44] I think when a game gets released, we should experience it for the first time the way

[03:48] the game was meant to be experienced.

[03:51] It is like watching a movie in which not all of the special effects are put into the movie.

[03:56] And then you see the movie.

[03:58] You see it again four months later with a little bit more special effects put in.

[04:02] And then a year and a half from now, when all the special effects are put in, you are

[04:06] asked to get excited about it all over again.

[04:09] And I just don't think these slow rollouts like really work anymore.

[04:13] And I don't think they work for this much money because I think the hype is going to

[04:16] move on.

[04:17] I think with the fact that they're making a thousand James Bond LEs at this much money.

[04:22] This is the most expensive Stern LE they've ever put out there next to Elvira and Batman

[04:27] SLE.

[04:28] At this much money, I don't think you're ever going to have a hard time finding a James

[04:33] Bond LE to buy.

[04:35] Do I think they're going to go up thousands of dollars in value?

[04:38] I do not.

[04:40] I really worry about the premium buyers.

[04:42] I really do.

[04:43] Because I think if you're buying premium machines now at 9,700 plus tax, how is a premium even

[04:50] going to come close to holding its value at that much money?

[04:54] It's just way too much money for a game they will make for years.

[04:59] Stern Pinball will be making James Bond for the next five years.

[05:02] So do you want to own a premium right away and buy it in 2022 and it's incomplete or

[05:08] early 2023?

[05:09] You might as well wait to 2024.

[05:11] Because here's the thing, if you wait to 2023 or 2024, you're going to be able to get a

[05:16] used premium for thousands of dollars less.

[05:19] The market is going to get really interesting in Pinball.

[05:22] I don't think the bubble is going to burst, but I do think we're going to see a correction

[05:27] if you will.

[05:28] I was on Pinside last night and I saw a gentleman listed his medieval madness royal edition for

[05:35] $24,000.

[05:37] It's not even new in box.

[05:39] It's opened up.

[05:40] It's a played game.

[05:41] It's a used game.

[05:42] That game brand new just a couple years ago was $10,000.

[05:47] This is where we're going to see a slowdown in the Pinball marketplace.

[05:50] These insane increases in prices, right?

[05:53] This isn't just a gradual increase in price.

[05:56] It's not a game that went from 10,000 to 12 to 14.

[06:00] When you go from $10,000 to $24,000, that is a name.

[06:06] That is bonkers.

[06:07] That is silly.

[06:08] And I think what we're going to start to see more and more of.

[06:10] I think we're going to see games like that sit forever.

[06:13] Now when you price a game like that, you're not pricing it to sell.

[06:17] You are pricing it to the point where you're like only a fool and their money will go after

[06:21] this kind of game.

[06:22] And I'm just looking to hook one really rich guy that doesn't really care.

[06:26] I mean, that's what happens when you price a machine like that.

[06:29] And I will say this, it only takes one person who wants it that bad, who's got that much

[06:34] money, who doesn't really care that they're paying a 140% increase in the price of the

[06:40] machine.

[06:41] And is that person out there?

[06:42] I don't know.

[06:43] If that person buys the game, I'll tell you what they won't do.

[06:46] They won't reveal that they bought the game because it's a foolish buy at that much money.

[06:50] I think we're going to see over the next 12 months, prices come back down to reality.

[06:55] I really do.

[06:56] I don't think we're going to see this crazy inflation continue.

[06:59] I think there's going to be so many games in the marketplace, so many games for sale

[07:04] in the marketplace, and so many more LEDs now.

[07:07] Right?

[07:08] Think about it.

[07:09] Stern's going to come out with three more LEDs in 2023.

[07:11] So speaking of where Stern goes next, so after this game, it's going to be interesting.

[07:15] What game do we see after James Bond?

[07:18] Are we going to see Venom, which we know is pretty much already done?

[07:22] The other game I'm hearing about is Jack Danger's next game.

[07:25] And here's the rumor I heard.

[07:26] We keep hearing people say, he man, but I heard the other rumors this, that Jack Danger's

[07:30] machine is going to be a music pin.

[07:33] And the two musical acts that I'm hearing could be Jack Danger's game are Foo Fighters

[07:39] and Motley Crue.

[07:40] Now between those two, I would rather have Motley Crue.

[07:44] I'm not a huge fan of the Foo Fighters.

[07:47] It's not that I don't get why you like them.

[07:49] I just don't need a Foo Fighters pinball machine.

[07:53] Stern is making it really easy for guys like me.

[07:55] I'm 46.

[07:56] I was born in 1976.

[07:59] James Bond, Sean Connery is not for me.

[08:02] Now Foo Fighters does fall into my wheelhouse, but they're just not a band that I love.

[08:07] I mean, I just don't.

[08:08] I have enough music pins in my life.

[08:10] I have one guns and roses machine, and that's good enough for me.

[08:13] I don't want like a row of music pins.

[08:15] So we'll see if it's that or if it's he man.

[08:18] Look, I would rather it be he man.

[08:20] I think he man would be amazing.

[08:21] It speaks more to me than Foo Fighters even.

[08:24] And I think he man's the right kind of can't be fun for pinball.

[08:27] I know some of you out there are throwing your like computer out the window right now being

[08:31] like Canadian he man's for kids.

[08:33] What are you talking about?

[08:34] But they got to make it based on the original he man, not the new woke version of he man.

[08:39] That wasn't any good.

[08:40] Right.

[08:41] So we've got Venom, which is Brian Eddy.

[08:43] We got Jack Danger's game.

[08:45] And then we got Keith Elwin's game, which is also going to be coming out sometime in

[08:48] 2023.

[08:49] I think Elwin's game is going to be Jaws.

[08:51] I'm going to die on that hill that it is going to be Jaws pinball that they are going

[08:55] to make it like Jurassic Park, make a game inspired by the Jaws movies and not use the

[09:00] actual footage from the movie itself.

[09:02] So I think we're going to see Keith Elwin Jaws.

[09:05] And I don't think Stern does another price increase.

[09:07] I know a lot of us are getting like deflated by the price of pinball now and it is a little

[09:13] deflating right?

[09:14] How can you have a top or go from $1,000 to $2,000?

[09:18] There's not even a gradual increase right?

[09:21] It's just accelerating so quickly.

[09:23] And I think it's accelerating too quickly.

[09:25] And I think a lot of us out there feel this way.

[09:28] And I think a lot of us out there have the power.

[09:30] You are like He-Man in your pinball buying worlds.

[09:34] You have the power to not buy.

[09:36] To just wait and see which ones of these games are going to actually end up being great,

[09:42] are going to end up being masterpieces because I do think for this much money, a game needs

[09:46] to check every box, not just a few boxes.

[09:49] Every single box needs to be checked.

[09:52] If you're going to ask me to spend over $10,000 on a pinball machine, that's not even that

[09:57] rare.

[09:58] I need to just make sure I don't want to sell it.

[10:00] And I think a lot of us are looking at this hobby now like that.

[10:03] It's no longer about investments.

[10:05] It's no longer about trading a game on because you know you're probably going to lose money

[10:10] if you spend these prices.

[10:12] It's not even about that anymore.

[10:13] It's just like we just want to buy games we love.

[10:16] Many of you already have a lineup of games that have so much stuff you love.

[10:21] Now speaking of like gameplay, I heard this about James Bond.

[10:24] I heard that the balltimes are long.

[10:26] And that's making people concerned.

[10:28] I just want to say this.

[10:29] I think the indictment of long balltimes is absolutely silly.

[10:34] I'll tell you why.

[10:35] How many of you out there mostly play your games by yourself?

[10:39] And everybody always wants really deep code.

[10:42] You want a ton of assets.

[10:44] You want all these different mini wizard modes and wizard modes and things to achieve in

[10:48] the game.

[10:49] Well, let me break it to you.

[10:51] You can't achieve a lot in a pinball machine unless you have long balltimes.

[10:57] Like how can you make a game brutally fast and have a lot of draining going on and also

[11:02] see a lot in the game?

[11:04] And so if you want to have a game with tons in it, you're going to have to give the player

[11:09] some time to get through the game.

[11:11] Now personally, because I pretty much suck at pinball, I somewhat enjoy a longer balltime

[11:17] game.

[11:18] I liked playing Lord of the Rings because I could see so much in the game and it also

[11:22] makes you feel like you're a little bit of a better pinball player than you really are.

[11:26] Now for people who are really good at pinball, long balltime games, they upset you and I

[11:31] understand why because you can spend a half hour on a machine and still be on the first

[11:35] ball.

[11:36] But for a home environment in which you are primarily playing by yourself, don't lie to

[11:42] us.

[11:43] Most of you out there listening to Canada's Pinball Podcasts, we're not the best pinball

[11:46] players and we actually enjoy having long games on our machines because we get to see

[11:52] more of the magic.

[11:53] It's just that simple to me.

[11:55] You get to experience more of the wow moments if you can maintain a ball in play.

[12:00] Alright, so Stern Pinball, they're going to have another Stern year.

[12:03] So let's go to American Pinball because I was really surprised that American Pinball and

[12:07] Christopher Francis showed people some images of the new game at the tailgating party at

[12:13] CoinTaker and then we saw nothing, nothing whatsoever from American Pinball in terms

[12:19] of their new game.

[12:21] But we did get confirmation from Dennis Nordman that the new game is going to be inside a

[12:26] completely new cabinet, that he's redesigned the pinball cabinet for this game.

[12:32] And Canada told you many, many episodes ago that this is going to be a cabinet that looks

[12:37] like a tank when it is folded down.

[12:40] So I totally think it's going to be like galactic tank force or space force and whatever

[12:44] that cabinet looks like, I think it's going to look like a tank or a spaceship like the

[12:49] cabinet itself.

[12:51] Now is this music to your ears or are you nervous about this?

[12:55] So I was just thinking about it.

[12:56] It makes absolutely no sense that the cabinet looks like something when the back boxes fold

[13:01] it down.

[13:02] So I hope that is not the case.

[13:04] The other thing is this.

[13:05] What has been American Pinball's biggest problems with their games to date?

[13:10] They stand out in a funky way in a lineup.

[13:14] They don't look good in a lineup.

[13:17] So I'm a little bit nervous that if they get overly ambitious with how the cabinet looks

[13:23] and they make it look too jarring and out of place, that once again American Pinball games

[13:29] are going to stand out of a lineup in a really weird way.

[13:33] Now why I do think it's cool to make a unique cabinet maybe sometimes for a game, the problem

[13:38] is this.

[13:39] Now your American Pinball games just won't look right next to each other.

[13:43] One of the greatest things Stern has done is they have consistency.

[13:48] Stern games look so good next to each other and you can put them next to each other even

[13:53] if it's the LCD, even with the DMD games.

[13:56] There's just something about that standardized cabinet.

[13:59] When you line up Stern games and they're all the same height and you put the Stern Pinball

[14:03] alley sign above them all, it just looks great.

[14:07] It's like matching luggage.

[14:08] It looks terrific.

[14:09] And then when you try to put an American Pinball game into a lineup of Stern machines, it looks

[14:14] horrible.

[14:15] It looks horribly out of place.

[14:16] It just doesn't look good aesthetically.

[14:19] Jersey Jack games look better together.

[14:21] They went through a little bit of a period where they were wide bodies than standard

[14:24] bodies.

[14:25] They changed the back box a little bit.

[14:27] But for the most part, JJP games look great next to each other.

[14:31] And so look, it seems like Dennis Norman and David Fix and Zofia Ryan over there are going

[14:35] all in on this game.

[14:37] I talked to someone who's seen the game.

[14:39] They said it is packed.

[14:41] But the question becomes, where is it?

[14:43] Like Expo is over.

[14:44] We didn't see anything.

[14:46] They didn't tease it.

[14:47] They're still talking to us about Legends of Vahala, a game that has no demand.

[14:51] There's no new demand for Legends of Vahala.

[14:54] It's so weird to me.

[14:55] Like you can go get a used deluxe limited version of the game for a thousand or more

[15:01] off sticker.

[15:02] So why would anyone order the standard deluxe or whatever the different versions are?

[15:06] There is no new demand for this game.

[15:08] And now it feels like American Pinball is not going to get out their new game this year.

[15:13] And there's no real timing.

[15:14] Right?

[15:15] Does anyone know when the new American Pinball game is going to be revealed?

[15:18] I would just have to assume if they're not going to do it in the winter, they're going

[15:22] to wait to like TPF to do it.

[15:25] But here's where the battleground is going to happen, right?

[15:27] Because we know Spooky's new game is coming out this year.

[15:30] I think we're going to see Scooby Doo sometime in December.

[15:34] I wouldn't be surprised if Spooky doesn't tease it on Halloween, everybody.

[15:39] It's called Spooky Pinball.

[15:41] And they've already sold all of their Halloween games.

[15:44] So what a perfect time for them to tease their next Spooky inspired Pinball machine.

[15:49] But I think Spooky Pinball is going to come out with their new game.

[15:52] And American Pinball is going to be caught sitting on their hands again and have nothing

[15:56] new to sell you.

[15:58] And by the time American Pinball releases this Dennis Norman game, they are most likely

[16:03] going to be competing with the next game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[16:06] If that's Godfather, they're probably hoping it's Godfather because if it is Godfather,

[16:10] I don't know who's buying that title.

[16:12] I have to be honest.

[16:13] And they're also going to be competing with the next game from Stern Pinball.

[16:16] Will it be Venom?

[16:17] Will it be something else?

[16:19] But my point is this.

[16:20] This was a perfect window for David Ficks and Team American Pinball to march in with

[16:26] a new game during a great sales window.

[16:29] And what are they trying to sell us right now?

[16:31] A game nobody really wants, Legends of Ahala.

[16:34] They just can't get the marketing down.

[16:36] Ugh, why is it so hard?

[16:38] Why is it so hard?

[16:40] Haven't they been working on this game for years?

[16:42] Just get it out.

[16:43] It's like nobody can stay on a schedule.

[16:46] And I understand there's a supply shortage.

[16:48] And I guess it's a good thing that they didn't reveal something until they actually can have

[16:52] the game on the line.

[16:53] But look, I think everyone's excited to see this Dennis Nordman game.

[16:57] But I'm a little worried that American Pinball from a marketing standpoint just never seems

[17:01] to have any strategy.

[17:02] Alright, so we got American Pinball, we got Stern, Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:07] Everybody is still waiting on their cactus can in L.E.'s.

[17:09] I have not seen a single one unboxed.

[17:12] It is crazy that they brought that game to Expo a year ago.

[17:17] The game is not even eligible for a Twippy because it's been out already for a year.

[17:21] I don't know if the topper is eligible for this year's Twippy, but Chicago Gaming Company

[17:25] is another company that just can't seem to get the games on the line.

[17:31] But if you're a Chicago Gaming Company, aren't you looking at one thing right now?

[17:35] Are you seeing these Big Bang bars?

[17:37] Are you seeing one sale pending for $33,000?

[17:41] Another for sale for $40,000?

[17:44] If you're a Chicago Gaming Company and you have the ability to remake Big Bang bar, why

[17:50] wouldn't you?

[17:52] If you're looking at this marketplace, oh my gosh, I mean this game is selling for hot

[17:56] cakes, but again the devil's advocate is like the only reason it's selling for that

[18:00] much money is people think the game is not going to be remade.

[18:04] If you flood the market with new versions of the game, then you start to really eat away

[18:09] at the value and the rarity of the machine itself.

[18:13] So Jersey Jack Pinball, when's the next game going to happen?

[18:16] Toy Story Demand is also dried up.

[18:18] I don't even think Greg sold his game for $10,200.

[18:22] People are just losing two grand overnight on the game.

[18:26] More and more people have been playing the game and everyone's going to come to the

[18:29] same conclusion.

[18:31] It's a fun game to shoot, it's based on the theme nobody wanted in the Toy Story world

[18:37] and it's a shallow game.

[18:39] So if you spend this much money on it and you bring it into a home environment, there's

[18:43] a really good chance you're going to see most of the game in a month or two and after

[18:47] that wears off, is it going to be a game you're going to want to own for a long period of time?

[18:53] And the problem is, is now that people are seeing the prices go down and down and down,

[18:57] you're going to want to get out of it quickly because if you hold on to it too long, you

[19:01] might be losing like three grand on a brand new pinball machine and nobody wants that to

[19:06] happen.

[19:07] There's going on in the pinball world so let's talk about Haggis for a second.

[19:11] Now look, you know Kaneda, I try to hold everybody accountable for the things they say they're

[19:16] going to do.

[19:17] Now Damian told customers months ago that he was going to finish all of the Mermaid

[19:22] Editions of Fathom by the end of the year.

[19:26] Now that is happening in just a couple months and I think they are making 250 Mermaid Editions

[19:32] of this game.

[19:34] Do you think he's going to hit that milestone?

[19:37] I can't imagine they're at that number.

[19:39] I don't even think they're at half of that number of Fathoms built.

[19:43] I also heard that the duck pinball guy, you know, the guy from South America, from Brazil

[19:47] I think he's from, I heard that he has left Haggis pinball.

[19:51] So we know when he went over there he was all excited to help Damian build these games.

[19:56] It's still one big mystery to me.

[19:58] I have no idea like how many people are making these games.

[20:01] The games are going out.

[20:02] Like whatever they're doing, I don't know if like magical little Australian elves are

[20:05] coming into the factory every night, but someone's making these games and that's a good sign

[20:10] and the quality of the games is there.

[20:13] When people are playing these games at shows it's very impressive.

[20:17] So look, I think you're going to get your game.

[20:19] It's never been about that.

[20:21] I'm just not sure how they're going to make money if their production is so slow.

[20:26] Like how are they going to stay in business in the long run if this is the case?

[20:31] You know, but it's the same problem with Jerry over at Multimorphic.

[20:34] They just can't find the people to make the games.

[20:38] Like even when I was watching the American Pinball Tour that David Fix showed us at his

[20:42] like seminar at Expo, I always noticed how few people are in these companies.

[20:47] Like you've got all of these parts and you've got this assembly line and you just never see

[20:52] many people coming in every day working on the machines.

[20:57] The only company that always seems like it's loaded with people is Stern.

[21:01] No one else.

[21:02] It always feels like more of a skeleton crew that's basically building these things slowly.

[21:08] Like it is not a fast operation building pinball machines.

[21:12] I think the only people that should be a little bit nervous are the Haggis series ticket holders

[21:17] who for some reason ordered the next four or five machines.

[21:21] Like good luck.

[21:22] I hope you get those games, but I think it's going to be a long wait for this company to

[21:26] move on to their next game.

[21:28] Because remember after they build these mermaid additions, they also have to go build all the

[21:33] other fathoms they got orders for.

[21:36] I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I don't think Haggis Pinball is going to

[21:40] build anything other than fathom in 2023.

[21:44] I don't think we're seeing another game, which is a long build cycle.

[21:48] And again, I hope they get it done, but I just think they completely underestimated how hard

[21:53] it is to make pinball machines.

[21:55] All right.

[21:56] So we've just started off on Haggis on spooky.

[21:58] Dutch pinball is slowly getting it done as well.

[22:01] Nothing new to report over at Dutch pinball.

[22:04] Let's talk about the pinball brothers.

[22:06] They showed up to pinball expo with prototypes of Queen pinball.

[22:11] And I want to question this move.

[22:13] Why would you show up with a prototype game that has code that is clearly, clearly in need

[22:20] of work?

[22:21] So you're letting people jump on the machine for the first time to experience the game

[22:26] in a way that is not very satisfying.

[22:30] I was hearing stuff like when the ball would drain, if you were in a song, the song would

[22:35] stop playing, which was really weird.

[22:38] Like that doesn't happen in Guns N' Roses.

[22:40] Like you're supposed to be at a Queen concert.

[22:42] Now that is obviously something they can fix with coding.

[22:46] But again, why would you come to a show and show your product in an incomplete way that's

[22:53] not going to win people over?

[22:55] And I don't get it.

[22:56] I really don't get it.

[22:58] A company like the pinball brothers is not Stern pinball.

[23:01] Nobody's got the confidence in their coding that this game is going to get incrementally

[23:06] better.

[23:07] Stern pinball can show up with something incomplete and everybody will forgive them.

[23:12] You know why?

[23:13] Because they have a track record of making some of the best pinball machines in history.

[23:18] What is the track record of the pinball brothers?

[23:21] They made alien pinball with Andrew Highway.

[23:24] That game was coded by Andrew Highway's people.

[23:28] This game has probably been somewhat coded by the team over at Highway.

[23:33] It's a leftover game from Andrew Highway's period with this company.

[23:37] So who's even coding this game?

[23:38] Like who's making this game?

[23:40] Do you have faith in the code team over at the pinball brothers to really knock this

[23:44] game out of the park?

[23:45] I watched video footage of this game and I struggled to find anything really interesting

[23:51] in it.

[23:52] Like it's okay.

[23:53] It feels like guns and roses light.

[23:55] But my point is this.

[23:56] You really do only get one chance to make a first impression.

[24:01] And for some reason in the pinball world, marketing and marketing basics continue to

[24:06] be a problem with these boutique companies.

[24:10] It's almost like you want to take credit before you should take credit.

[24:13] Yes, going to a show with your product and hanging out with fans and hanging out with

[24:18] the community.

[24:19] That is a reward for the hard work.

[24:23] But you should not show up at a show unless your game is done or your name is Stern Pinball.

[24:29] I mean that.

[24:30] Not even Stern should show up with incomplete games.

[24:32] I don't think showing James Bond in this form is doing anything for them.

[24:36] I really don't.

[24:38] And you could see it.

[24:39] Like the feedback from people on James Bond is like, yeah, it's good.

[24:41] It's all right.

[24:42] I don't know.

[24:43] The ball spends a lot of time in the pop bumpers, but I'm not quite sure where the code is

[24:46] going to go, but it's probably going to be great.

[24:48] I mean, that's it.

[24:49] That's the feedback.

[24:50] It's probably going to be great.

[24:51] Right?

[24:52] I mean, it's going to be about Queen.

[24:53] Like it's probably going to be great.

[24:54] You know, there's some Queen fanatics that will buy this game, but for the most part,

[24:59] how do you put Queen Pinball at over $10,000?

[25:03] How do you put it in your consideration set right now?

[25:05] If you're a pinhead, how do you do that?

[25:08] When are you even going to get your game?

[25:10] Do you remember when they revealed this game?

[25:12] They said they were shipping products to customers in like October, November of this year.

[25:17] They took people's nonrefundable deposits on those orders.

[25:22] Now we're learning the game's not even going to be on the line this year.

[25:26] And so this is it.

[25:27] It's like another failed launch.

[25:29] And I think as a community, and I'm not just being like negative, because I love pinball,

[25:34] when are we just going to say, stop doing this, stop launching your products in the worst

[25:40] way possible?

[25:42] Like just wait, what benefit does it do showing an incomplete game?

[25:47] All you're doing is turning people off to your product.

[25:51] So many people probably walked up to Queen and had an experience with the game that was

[25:56] underwhelming because they're playing an incomplete game.

[25:59] Right?

[26:00] And it wasn't just like the ball draining and the song stopping.

[26:02] I'm also hearing the callouts in the game were horrible, horrible callouts.

[26:06] Like they put you to sleep.

[26:07] How can you have a rock and roll machine with high energy Queen music?

[26:12] And then your callouts are like they're on Kweyludes.

[26:15] And it's like, when are we going to learn this lesson?

[26:17] We learned this lesson with Rob Zombie.

[26:20] After Rob Zombie's callouts, they were the same way.

[26:23] If you're going to do callouts for a pinball machine, you've got to have some enthusiasm,

[26:28] some energy.

[26:29] This is a high energy game pinball, and you can't just be phoning it in.

[26:35] But again, a lot of this comes from experience, and they just don't have experience guiding

[26:41] people on doing callouts.

[26:43] Oh, it's so easy.

[26:44] You know, look, some of this is hard.

[26:46] Like, I get making pinball is hard, but some of this isn't hard.

[26:50] Like it's not hard to get energy in your pinball callouts.

[26:54] It's not hard to get good artwork on a pinball machine.

[26:57] It's not hard to design an orbit that's not clunky.

[27:00] I'm sorry.

[27:01] We are way too forgiving as a community to some of the boneheaded mistakes we see happening

[27:06] over and over and over again in pinball.

[27:09] All right.

[27:10] What else is happening in pinball?

[27:11] Who's going to win the winter?

[27:12] Right?

[27:13] I keep saying this.

[27:14] Who's going to win the pinball winter?

[27:15] I think it's going to be spooky.

[27:16] I'm calling it right now.

[27:18] I think the game that's going to have most of the hype is going to be spooky's new game

[27:23] because I think when they reveal it, I don't know, there's just something about it.

[27:26] It just feels like it's going to be a dark horse.

[27:28] I think there's a lot of people that just don't care about Sean Connery, James Bond.

[27:32] I mean that.

[27:33] And it's nothing against James Bond.

[27:34] It's just there's so many of us.

[27:36] It's just not a theme for us.

[27:39] Now will Scooby-Doo be that theme?

[27:41] Probably not.

[27:42] Right?

[27:43] This old man or little kids that would wear Scooby-Doo pajamas is like, where's the game

[27:47] for just normal dudes like me?

[27:50] Like where's Top Gun?

[27:52] Where's Cobra Kai?

[27:54] Where's Fifth Eldiment?

[27:55] Where's Big Trouble in Little China?

[27:57] Where's The Matrix?

[27:58] Like it's really easy to make a theme where you could see someone aged like 40 to 55 would

[28:05] love this theme for pinball.

[28:07] Everybody, thank you for tuning in to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[28:10] I will be back later this week as we see what happens in this pinball world.

[28:14] I fully expect the Keith Elwyn game to be any day now.

[28:19] Stern's going to have to get this thing out any day now and it is going to be the talk

[28:24] of the pinball world when it drops, but I don't think in the right way.

[28:29] Everybody be good.

[28:30] We'll talk to you soon.
