[00:00] There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there.

[00:03] They're all living in Devil Maker, and I'm just a devil with love and space.

[00:10] Oh, Viva Las Vegas!

[00:12] CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA CERA!

[00:16] Ah, yours truly, Canada, is heading to Las Vegas this evening.

[00:21] I'm on a 9.30 flight, and then I'm gonna be in Las Vegas for one day.

[00:26] I'm gonna be there for the Dodge event to see if I get a chance to buy this thousand

[00:29] horsepower Demon Slayer, and then I'm on a red-eye flight out tomorrow.

[00:35] But I'm so committed to the Canada Club that I wanted to come in on Sunday and give you

[00:38] guys a podcast to listen to, because you're not gonna get one tomorrow when I'm in Las

[00:42] Vegas, because I'm not even bringing any carry-on.

[00:44] I'm just walking onto the plane in my all-black Canada gear, and I'm just bringing like a fanny

[00:49] pack with like my license in it and my cell phone charger, and that's how I'm going to

[00:53] the event.

[00:54] I love traveling light, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:56] Alright, so this is gonna be the week where we finally see Galactic Tank Force, and look,

[01:00] I thought this game was gonna be released this weekend at Jack Bar.

[01:04] Clearly, there's some delay in getting this game out to the world, and here's the weird

[01:09] part.

[01:10] If David Fix is gonna hold the reveal till Wednesday of this week, he might as well just

[01:15] hold it till Friday and reveal the game at Texas Pinball Festival.

[01:21] Like you're just two days away from this huge festival.

[01:24] Why are you going to reveal it on a Wednesday?

[01:27] And I think the reason why is he's gonna have this game on location in a few places, and

[01:31] I think he wants to have this game like in Chicago, in New York, like in different locations

[01:37] while Texas Pinball Festival is going on.

[01:40] So that's what I think is gonna happen.

[01:41] I think you're gonna see this game on location, Revealed Wednesday, and we've been seeing

[01:45] more and more teasers from Christopher Franchi and the people over at American Pinball,

[01:50] and I just want to say this, I've been liking all of the teasers around this game.

[01:55] There's been a lot of idiotic commentary around the tank itself.

[01:58] They put out a poster with a campy line like, fold and fight action or something like that.

[02:04] No, when this tank folds down, you do not play the game while the tank is folded.

[02:10] It is just meant to look really campy and silly.

[02:13] It's a grown up toy.

[02:15] It's so weird that Franchi has to go into the pin side thread and actually argue with

[02:21] people about the game and about the poster.

[02:25] They're just having some fun when they say, for the first time ever, because last time

[02:30] I checked, I've never seen a freaking pinball machine look like a tank.

[02:35] Now the big question is this, how much is this tank going to cost?

[02:40] And how many are they going to make?

[02:42] Here's the scary part.

[02:43] This game is releasing on Wednesday and none of the major American Pinball distributors

[02:48] even know.

[02:49] They don't know how many.

[02:51] They don't know how much it's going to cost.

[02:53] Usually American Pinball gives their distributors three weeks notice before a new game comes

[02:57] out and here's what I think is going to happen.

[03:00] This is just Canadian guessing.

[03:01] I think David Fix is really struggling because I don't think he wants to leave any money

[03:06] on the table, but he's got to find that balancing act.

[03:10] How much do we charge for this thing?

[03:12] We can't overcharge for it, but he's also probably struggling because he's like, I don't

[03:16] want to say there's only going to be 200 or 300 tanks and then 800 people want them because

[03:22] he better not do what he did with Legends of Vahala and that's up the number of games

[03:28] after he says it's going to be this many units.

[03:31] So I really hope on Wednesday when American Pinball says this is how many tank games we

[03:38] are making, they do not go back on their word again and then up the number and here's

[03:43] the pressure over at American Pinball.

[03:45] Everybody remember this.

[03:47] Every single American Pinball game has probably lost this company money and Mukesh who runs

[03:53] AIMtron is not happy about losing money on the Pinball division and I think they know

[03:59] that they finally have a game that has a lot of people excited.

[04:03] They finally have their best shooting game.

[04:07] It is packed with toys or enough toys in this marketplace in which almost every game it

[04:11] doesn't have any toys anymore and I think they're struggling to figure out like how

[04:16] do we make money on this thing and not give a good idea away for free.

[04:22] If you're them and you're seeing what Stern's getting for like their LEs and Jersey Jack

[04:27] is getting for its CEs and you're looking at how much stuff is actually in Godfather

[04:32] from a toy standpoint, it looks like there's more stuff inside of Galactic Tank Force.

[04:38] Now look it's an original IP and that's the problem.

[04:41] You know everyone knows it's expensive to make IP games like Foo Fighters and Pulp Fiction

[04:46] and the Godfather.

[04:47] Like there's a licensing cost that goes into those games.

[04:50] There's no licensing cost that goes into Galactic Tank Force so everything can go into the physical

[04:56] game itself.

[04:57] Now where there has to be incredible cost is making this tank cabinet.

[05:02] And this can't be cheap.

[05:04] People thinking they're going to get this tank for less than $10,000.

[05:07] I think you're crazy.

[05:08] I think this tank is going to cost like $12,000 to $13,000.

[05:12] I also heard that American Pinball needs to make a special box or crate to send this game

[05:18] to customers because this is not a standard cabinet and that also is going to come with

[05:23] a lot more costs.

[05:25] I'm a little bit nervous.

[05:26] I'm a little bit nervous because think about it.

[05:28] This company has never had a ship a game that has all of this stuff on it.

[05:33] I also heard when the back box is up it might stick out from the wall more than a standard

[05:39] pin so we shall see what happens.

[05:41] I mean they're going to have to tell us everything on Wednesday and it's been a very long wait

[05:46] to see a game that we've already seen.

[05:48] I would have dropped the official reveal when all of the stuff started to leak but that's

[05:53] just me.

[05:54] Alright so this is it.

[05:55] So bad and clean up is Galactic Tank Force and now everyone's sights are on TPF.

[06:01] I'm headed to TPF.

[06:02] I'm going to be there Friday.

[06:04] I am super excited to play all of these games.

[06:07] I have not played any of these new games and you know, Canada, I'm not the best pinball

[06:12] player but I really can't wait to jump on each of these machines.

[06:16] I really can't wait to see how angry every manufacturer is at me.

[06:21] I feel like the only place that's going to be nice to me is like Stern Pinball because

[06:24] Jack Danger and I are friends.

[06:26] David Fix will be nice to me because David Fix is a really nice guy.

[06:30] I think Christopher Franchi wants to kill me.

[06:32] I think Jersey Jack Pinball wants to kill me.

[06:35] I think Jerry at Multimorphic wants to kill me.

[06:37] We definitely know Marty and Damien want to kill me.

[06:40] Who else wants to kill me?

[06:41] I think the guys at CGC will be nice to me as well.

[06:44] Ryan White might want to kill me because I've been saying he has the worst communication

[06:48] track record in all of pinball but Ryan White is a nice guy.

[06:51] He's like, Chris, you don't understand.

[06:54] We got to order these like special train pods for the LE.

[06:58] The gang over at Spooky Pinball, they're not going to want to kill me.

[07:00] The Spooky guys are always really nice.

[07:02] I think I've been pretty fair on Scooby-Doo.

[07:04] I haven't really said anything negative about the game.

[07:07] There's been some quality issues but for the most part, I think Spooky Pinball did a really

[07:12] good thing in locking in their money early on.

[07:14] Now speaking of locking money early on, I've been talking to my friend Don over at Don's

[07:19] Pinball Podcast.

[07:20] He's all bummed out.

[07:21] He didn't get a Pulp Fiction Limited Edition.

[07:24] And I'm here to tell everybody right now, you are not going to have a hard time getting

[07:27] a Pulp Fiction Limited Edition.

[07:29] I know it seems like it right now because everyone grabbed all of these spots but there are 1000

[07:36] of them.

[07:37] And this game is like 10 months away from production at the earliest.

[07:41] And we know CGC's record of getting games on the line in time so I don't even know if

[07:46] we're going to see a single Pulp Fiction LE in 2023.

[07:50] And I mean it when I say it.

[07:51] By the time a single Pulp Fiction gets made, you're going to see Venom, you're probably

[07:57] going to see Jersey Jack Pinball's next machine, and there's going to be more new Pinball in

[08:02] the world.

[08:03] And that's not to say like people are going to fall out of love with Pulp Fiction because

[08:07] I do think this is a juggernaut theme.

[08:09] I think this thing is just like an art piece.

[08:12] It is like you are owning a piece of Pulp Fiction memorabilia.

[08:16] And I think this thing is going to stay in people's homes.

[08:19] But we are already seeing someone try to flip a Pulp Fiction LE for $2500 on top of the

[08:25] deposit.

[08:26] And I think that guy has like over 150 downvotes on pin side.

[08:31] What's up with that people?

[08:33] What's up with that?

[08:34] No one's allowed to scalp anymore?

[08:36] And trust me, here's what's going to happen.

[08:38] You're going to see a lot of distributors hold back some of their Pulp Fiction inventory

[08:43] and then all of a sudden they're going to be selling them for $15000 a year from now

[08:47] when everyone realizes this game is going to be bolted to the floor.

[08:51] Time will tell, time will tell, but what an exciting time to be in Pinball.

[08:55] I think that's the main thing.

[08:57] This has been such an exciting month in Pinball.

[08:59] There's more than enough games hitting all at once.

[09:03] We will know if this was a good decision for every manufacturer to hit right now or if

[09:08] it was a bad decision.

[09:09] I definitely feel like there are games that are going to be left in the dust.

[09:13] Game number one that is going to be left in the dust is Stern Pinball's James Bond.

[09:18] Not the Keith Elwin one, but the regular James Bond game.

[09:22] That game is so far behind everyone else's excitement.

[09:26] I don't think that game is ever going to be what Stranger Things turned into.

[09:31] It doesn't have interesting mechs or moments the way Stranger Things does.

[09:35] I think you're going to see James Bond pins selling at bargain basement prices by the

[09:39] end of the year.

[09:40] That's Stern's fault.

[09:41] This game never should have came out.

[09:43] By the time the sausage is made, nobody's going to care on James Bond.

[09:47] I think this final resistance game by Multimorphic, they just stream this game.

[09:53] Scott Denisi, people love Scott Denisi, but the numbers don't lie as my competitors say.

[09:58] The numbers don't lie and they stream this game.

[10:01] When I went on Pinside after the stream, there was like three to four comments in total about

[10:07] the stream of the game.

[10:08] One of those was from Scott Denisi and one of those was from Buffalo Pinball.

[10:12] Those were the two guys in the stream.

[10:15] Nobody really cares about this game right now.

[10:17] At $11,700, nobody's throwing that money at Multimorphic.

[10:23] People are keeping that money for Pulp Fiction.

[10:25] They're keeping it for this freaking tank.

[10:27] They have to spend that if they want Godfather LE.

[10:30] The other one I think is going to be the big loser is just Godfather LE.

[10:33] I think at $12,000, these Jersey Jack games are just too much money for a game where you're

[10:39] going to make $5,000 of them.

[10:41] It doesn't help that people share that letter that goes with every single Godfather.

[10:44] It's basically a letter indemnifying Jersey Jack pinball to the quality of their machines.

[10:50] They want people to believe that you're getting this one-off, bespoke, handmade pinball machine

[10:55] that might have issues with the playfield and warping and ghosted inserts.

[11:00] I don't think people are going to buy it.

[11:02] We don't get letters like that with Spooky Pinball.

[11:05] We don't get letters like that with Chicago Gaming Company.

[11:08] We don't get letters like that with American Pinball.

[11:11] The people who are making quality playfields and the name of the company is Bader.

[11:16] This is such an excuse again for Mirko Playfield.

[11:19] I don't know if there are going to be issues with Godfather Playfields.

[11:22] There is an image I shared on my Facebook page where you can see some of the inserts

[11:26] starting to lift up on that playfield.

[11:29] I hope it's not widespread.

[11:31] I'm not rooting against Jersey Jack pinball, but I have no empathy anymore.

[11:35] They still use Mirko and I don't like Mirko.

[11:39] I think he's a weasel and I can't for the life of me understand why Jersey Jack pinball

[11:43] continues to use him.

[11:45] They told Guns N' Roses owners like they would have the replacement playfields for Guns

[11:50] N' Roses.

[11:51] No, they still don't have both the upper and lower playfields available.

[11:54] I've been asking and you still can't get both.

[11:57] And we're almost at the summer of 2023, so they're missing that milestone by a year.

[12:03] Why is that so hard to do Mirko?

[12:05] And I think Queen Pinball is another one that's going to be dead on arrival.

[12:08] I think the big winners are going to be Foo Fighters, Pulp Fiction and Galactic Tank Force.

[12:13] And I think Scooby doesn't even need to win or lose because they're going to win because

[12:17] they got all of those non-refundable deposits.

[12:19] And I think that's where pinball is at right now.

[12:22] So ladies and gentlemen, Canada will be back with more shows.

[12:25] I'll definitely be back with a show on Wednesday when we start to talk about Galactic Tank

[12:30] Force.

[12:31] But thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[12:33] Know how dedicated I am to each and every one of you to get you the most entertaining

[12:38] and to the point pinball podcast on the planet.

[12:41] What happened to all these shows that were supposed to fill the daily void and now they've

[12:45] all become 90 minute shows with interviews?

[12:47] No, we need more short to the point pinball podcast with energy.

[12:51] Ugh, I can't wait.

[12:53] And so you know my cargo shorts come in this week and we're going to wear them at the Twippy

[12:56] Saturday night.

[12:57] If I win the Twippy for favorite pinball podcast behind the paywall, this will be the greatest

[13:02] achievement in pinball podcasting history.
