[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:20] It's the first of the month.

[00:22] Hopefully you enjoyed your Halloween and your kids went trick-or-treating.

[00:25] You've got a great episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast that I now have to record again.

[00:30] I know sometimes this happens.

[00:32] I'm recording a show and I'm looking at some stuff.

[00:34] I'm looking at the internet.

[00:35] I'm looking at Pinside and then I look down and after I've been speaking for 30 minutes,

[00:40] it didn't record everything.

[00:42] It stopped at the 3-minute mark.

[00:44] This is going to be take two of Canada's Pinball Podcast, but it'll be better now because

[00:48] I'll be more concise in all of my statements because I felt like I was rambling a little

[00:52] bit at 5 o'clock in the morning.

[00:54] Here's what we're going to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:57] We're going to talk about some Jaws rumors.

[00:59] We've been hearing some new stuff.

[01:01] We're going to talk about that.

[01:02] We're going to talk about new code for Halloween and for Elvira that dropped on Halloween.

[01:07] We're going to talk about multi-morphic production.

[01:09] It's now 10 games a month and they're not going to make new games until they fix the

[01:14] old problems.

[01:15] We're going to talk about Guns N' Roses, Ellie's are now 8,500 new in box.

[01:21] We're going to talk about why that is and what that means for this company trying to

[01:26] sell Elton John machines now for 12 to $15,000 Jersey Jack.

[01:32] You really need to hit time out.

[01:34] We're going to talk about barrels of fun and when people are going to get their games

[01:38] and how many games we think they're going to be making a week.

[01:40] I also want to talk about, and this will be the theme of this podcast, is what I think

[01:44] is the sweet spot for what makes a game limited in the pinball world because now we're at

[01:50] a point now where everyone's just wondering why does nothing feel truly limited and we're

[01:55] making so many of each of these games now and what is that doing to both the collectibility

[02:01] of pinball, the second hand market in pinball and just the overall vibe within the pinball

[02:06] community.

[02:07] I think for most of us we've been having a lot of fun in this hobby for a lot of years

[02:12] and I would say if you did a survey, people do not feel like buying pinball machines is

[02:17] more fun now.

[02:18] They don't feel like pinside and the community conversation around pinball is more fun than

[02:22] it's ever been.

[02:23] I think a lot changed in pinball during COVID and I think for some reason this hobby is

[02:29] reluctant to going back to where it should be in some aspects of the industry itself.

[02:36] Some things are never going to change.

[02:37] That's just life.

[02:38] Some things are just always going to become more expensive.

[02:41] It's not just about the price.

[02:43] It's about like, are we oversaturating the hobby itself and what that's doing to pinball?

[02:48] Then I'm going to do, and I haven't done this in a while, I'm going to do Canada's

[02:51] collector's corner and I'm going to pull up some games that are for sale for a ridiculously

[02:55] high price and let's ask ourselves, is this something worth collecting?

[03:00] What do we think about the price and what would I do?

[03:02] What would Canada do?

[03:03] The man with never ending opinions about pinball collectibility, what would I do if I was looking

[03:08] at a machine like this for sale?

[03:10] Would I think about pulling the trigger or would I head for the exit?

[03:13] Let's talk about Jaws pinball.

[03:15] This is probably the worst kept rumor in all of pinball.

[03:19] We know that Keith Owens Jaws is right around the corner and I am hearing that the artwork

[03:23] on the game is not that great.

[03:26] I'm hearing two rumors.

[03:27] I'm hearing that the artist is going to be the artist from Rush and then I'm hearing

[03:30] that it's Randy Martinez.

[03:32] Now I think it's probably going to be Randy Martinez on artwork and here's the hard part

[03:36] about artists and pinball.

[03:38] It's very subjective.

[03:39] We all have our favorites.

[03:40] Some people love Frenchie and Zambietti.

[03:43] Some people don't.

[03:44] We've been spoiled.

[03:45] I would say over the last five years or so, pinball art has been the best it's ever

[03:50] been and we have so much beautiful pinball art that now the problem becomes so much of

[03:56] it is starting to blend in and look similar because we're going to the same artist time

[04:01] and time again and that's a little bit of a good problem to have.

[04:04] It's much better than the old days in which machines were just Photoshop, dragged and

[04:09] dropped artwork.

[04:10] So here's what I'm hearing.

[04:11] Randy Martinez on Jaws.

[04:13] Now if you go look at my Patreon page, I put up a couple examples of what Randy Martinez

[04:18] Jaws could look like and I know that his specialty was Star Wars and Mandalorian and Mandalorian

[04:23] didn't look that bad at all.

[04:25] Looked pretty cool, right?

[04:26] Because it's like his style of Star Wars like comic book kind of artwork.

[04:29] But that's not the style that you should use for Jaws and as I look at these Jaws images,

[04:34] they're just flat.

[04:35] There's just something about them that don't look right if you're trying to capture that

[04:40] Jaws theme in artistic form.

[04:43] The other thing I'm hearing is that Chrissy Watkins who's the character in the Jaws movie

[04:48] who's swimming, she becomes Jaws' first victim, I'm hearing that the L.D.

[04:52] Cabinet artwork is a big image of Chrissy swimming in the ocean and I don't know, like

[04:58] people who have seen it have said, Canada, it's really not going to blow people away.

[05:03] It looks kind of weird.

[05:04] So we shall see what's going to happen with this game.

[05:07] You know, look, if Jaws has artwork, that's not great and Jaws doesn't have many assets

[05:13] in it.

[05:14] Does that mean that Keith Elwyn is going to have a game that's not going to be received

[05:18] tremendously well?

[05:19] My money will always be on Keith Elwyn because the other game that came out with no assets

[05:25] and had terrible artwork was a game called Jurassic Park and that game did just fine.

[05:31] And one of the reasons why Jurassic Park did just fine, it had one of the coolest mechanisms

[05:35] ever in the history of Stern in that T-Rex that ate the ball.

[05:39] Like once we saw that, it was like awesome.

[05:42] Stern has finally engineered a mechanism.

[05:45] It finally made something that interacts with the ball and I think Jaws is going to be loaded

[05:50] with cool mechanical stuff that will win us over regardless of how the artworks and regardless

[05:56] if the game doesn't have all the assets or movie clips.

[05:59] He just knows how to do it.

[06:00] Keith Elwyn just knows how to do it and until he fails, I am never going to predict a Keith

[06:06] Elwyn failure.

[06:07] If I predicted a Keith Elwyn failure, I think I would lose like half of my subscribers.

[06:12] So that is Jaws Pinball.

[06:14] We will hopefully see this game in December.

[06:17] It seems like it's going to be more like early January because nobody was really expecting

[06:22] a blood kiss edition and another run of Stranger Things.

[06:25] And now that we have both of those happening over at Stern Pinball, they might slide Jaws

[06:30] into Q1 2024.

[06:32] Alright what else is happening in the pinball world?

[06:35] Let's talk about Halloween and Elvira had code updates on Halloween.

[06:40] That was super awesome.

[06:42] What a super nice treat for owners of both of those games.

[06:46] It was funny seeing how there's like the blood kiss edition of the code for Elvira.

[06:51] The only problem is nobody owns the blood kiss edition of the game.

[06:56] But it was really awesome that Stern is going back to this game.

[06:59] They've added more animated gargoyles.

[07:01] I love the fact that if you own like a 40th or a blood kiss edition, the game is going

[07:06] to speak to you and recognize that you own that version of the game.

[07:10] That was the one thing I never understood with Batman SLE, how they never got like Batman

[07:16] or Robin when you turn the game on to be like, holy super limited edition Batman.

[07:21] Why couldn't they do that?

[07:23] Why couldn't they do that?

[07:24] And those little touches, I'm telling you right now, those little touches of adding

[07:28] personalized code to each variation of the game is always going to make people want to

[07:33] hold on to the game more.

[07:34] It's going to make a game feel more special when you own it.

[07:37] Alright, so a good Halloween for everybody over there.

[07:40] A terrible Halloween for everybody with a guns and roses.

[07:44] Not only will Jersey Jack never revisit this game, it seems and improve it, which is a huge

[07:50] issue and really destroying people's feelings about Jersey Jack pinball.

[07:54] They're a lack of desire to not stop until they make a game perfect.

[07:58] But we keep beating that dead horse on Canadian Spinball Podcast, but think about it for a

[08:02] minute.

[08:03] What does it mean now that you can go get a guns and roses new inbox from a distributor

[08:08] for $8,500?

[08:11] And that game is way more popular than Elton John will ever be.

[08:15] You know, it's a cooler band.

[08:17] It's a much more popular theme than Elton John.

[08:20] And so a distributor's got an $8,500 brand new inbox Jersey Jack game.

[08:26] And how is that distributor going to sell you a $12,000 Elton John or a $15,000 Elton

[08:35] John?

[08:36] And what this means for Jersey Jack is terrible.

[08:39] It's horrible timing because now that we're seeing all of these pinball prices getting

[08:43] reduced on older models, the scary part about pinball is nothing is really an older model

[08:49] like things just fall out of demand.

[08:51] You know, you can go get a new inbox toy story for new inbox, CE, a collector's edition

[08:58] that if you bought it on day one, you spent $15,000 on the machine for those who bought

[09:05] direct from Jersey Jack with taxes, you're at like $16,500 for the machine.

[09:11] You can go get that game new inbox from a distributor in 2023 for $10,000 now.

[09:19] And so this is it.

[09:21] Like everybody is just watching these Jersey Jack games plummet in price and now it's happening

[09:27] so quickly and the amount people are losing is tremendous.

[09:31] It's getting to the point now where it's feeling like people who buy Jersey Jack games, they're

[09:35] going to start to be like the people who bought into crypto at the wrong time.

[09:40] They're never going to hear from them again, right?

[09:42] They're just going to slowly take their losses and leave the hobby or they're going to be

[09:46] less engaging with the hobby.

[09:48] They're not going to want to interact with people because it's bumming people out.

[09:51] You know, and when they try to get rid of these games, they're just going to take such a huge

[09:55] financial loss.

[09:56] It's hard not to think about what they could have got with that money because they didn't

[10:00] get the pinball experience they wanted or they wouldn't be trying to sell the game.

[10:05] And I think with Jersey Jack and these prices going down and now with the rumor that they're

[10:09] going to have the matrix and they have the license for the matrix and I bet they do have

[10:14] the matrix license and that's what Mark Saden is working on, I'm going to suggest something

[10:19] crazy.

[10:20] This company is run by a billionaire and like when you become a billionaire, can't you make

[10:24] bold moves?

[10:25] Can't you make bold, unexpected moves that nobody saw coming?

[10:29] I think Jersey Jack pinball should walk into a conference room and say, hey, look, we need

[10:33] to do something.

[10:34] We're going to do something crazy that nobody would expect.

[10:37] I think they need to come out and say, hey, look, we're going to keep working on Elton

[10:41] John.

[10:42] We're going to add a few more things to the game that excite us.

[10:44] In the meantime, we're going to bring another game out in front of that game and I would

[10:48] try to get matrix on the line in front of Elton John.

[10:52] I would and it doesn't even matter if you made people wait six months.

[10:55] I just think running Elton John right now after Godfather and Toy Story 4, it's just

[11:02] dead on arrival.

[11:03] And there's no sadder place to see that it's dead on arrival than in Pinsight.

[11:07] And I'm not talking about the height thread where it's just Iceman and pans or freaks

[11:11] circle jerking each other and neither of them ordered the game.

[11:14] I'm talking about the Elton John pre-order thread in which the thread is set up for people

[11:19] who pre-ordered the game to talk about it and nobody's in that thread.

[11:23] Nobody wants to admit they pre-ordered the game.

[11:25] It's really bad people.

[11:26] I haven't seen a game come out in a really long time.

[11:30] We're on day one and week one.

[11:32] The enthusiasm is this low for the game.

[11:35] So I think they need to make a bold move.

[11:37] I think they need to address Guns N' Roses code.

[11:40] I think there's a lot that needs to happen over at Jersey Jack Pinball and it's really

[11:45] starting to feel like a company that doesn't have a strategic vision.

[11:49] They don't really know what they're doing and the community is pushing back and they

[11:53] are in a PR crisis mode.

[11:55] I mean it.

[11:56] They are in a crisis mode.

[11:58] This is not working for them.

[12:00] The pricing isn't working for them.

[12:02] A thousand CEs are not working for them.

[12:05] Their brand is taking such a hit and they seemingly have no answers.

[12:09] It's not going to work spamming people on Facebook that you now have Elton John available.

[12:15] Hey, we know it's available.

[12:17] We know if you buy it right now we're going to lose a ton of money on it.

[12:21] People are not that foolish.

[12:23] They need to rethink everything they're doing over there.

[12:26] Everything they're doing from the beginning when Jack has a terrible idea for a theme

[12:30] to making a thousand CEs at $15,000 a pop.

[12:34] It's just not working.

[12:35] So let's talk about that for a minute.

[12:37] Let's talk about what I think is the ideal number that you should make if you want to

[12:42] make something limited in the world of pinball.

[12:45] And for those of you out there who are like this whole thing is stupid like limited versions

[12:49] of games.

[12:50] Just make one version of the game.

[12:52] Look, it's never going to be that way.

[12:54] Pinball is always going to have a collectible side of the community.

[12:57] It's always going to have buyers that want to have the creme de la creme version of a

[13:01] game or a nicer version of the game because that's just what people want.

[13:05] And the FOMO around Elies has been what's been driving this market for many, many years.

[13:11] I think it's each end of the spectrum that really drives pinball.

[13:14] You got the pros for the operators and you've got the Elies for the collector and for everybody

[13:19] else in between you get the premium.

[13:21] I mean, it's a model that works, but lately hasn't it been feeling like nothing is really

[13:26] limited?

[13:27] Thousand Elies.

[13:28] There's just something about that number that just doesn't work.

[13:32] And pinball was much more fun when there was more of a FOMO and a frenzy to get your hands

[13:37] on one of 500 Elies.

[13:40] To me, that is the ideal number of a machine when you want to create some sort of limited

[13:46] nature around the machine.

[13:48] 500.

[13:49] No more, no less.

[13:51] Well you could definitely have less, but no more than 500.

[13:55] When you make more than 500, there's just something about it that just doesn't feel like

[13:59] this thing is really rare because remember, pinball is a very, very small niche hobby.

[14:06] Very, very small.

[14:07] It's smaller than people think.

[14:08] Let's ask a question.

[14:10] How many people out in the world do you think are actual new in box pinball buyers?

[14:16] How many people do you think are actually in the market to buy a pinball machine when a

[14:21] pinball machine is revealed that have the money ready to go who are also diehards and

[14:26] into this hobby?

[14:27] I would say the total number of like, again, a day one reveal person that is ready to go

[14:33] is somewhere south of 5000 people.

[14:35] Somewhere south of 5000 people.

[14:37] 5000 people that actually on that day are really ready to go and pull the trigger on

[14:42] a pinball machine.

[14:43] Now out of those 5000 people, you know, the theme's not going to be for everybody.

[14:47] Out of those 5000 people, the price is not going to be right for everybody.

[14:50] Now look, when the theme is popular enough, you get everybody excited or it's from a

[14:54] designer people love, you know, you're going to activate a good number of those people.

[14:59] And remember, these are the diehards.

[15:00] These are the people on a daily basis, actively engaged in pinball.

[15:03] You know, these are the people that are joining pinball podcast on a weekly basis.

[15:07] They're on pin side.

[15:08] They're on Facebook.

[15:09] They talk to their friends on a weekly basis about pinball.

[15:11] I would say it's about 5000 strong.

[15:14] In other industries, it can climb into the millions of people waiting for the next video

[15:18] game, way more people into the auto industry, way more people that are collecting watches,

[15:23] you know, way more people into fashion.

[15:25] That's just the way it goes.

[15:27] So it's a small niche hobby.

[15:29] And for so many years, this small niche hobby had a model and a system that really worked

[15:34] really well.

[15:35] You made 500 LE games.

[15:37] You kind of had to have some sort of relationship with the distributor to get your hands on one

[15:42] early.

[15:43] And there was a race to get one.

[15:44] But I remember those days.

[15:45] It wasn't impossible to get one if you were one of those like diehard people following

[15:50] the hobby.

[15:51] And the system sort of worked because the more you engaged with your distributor friend,

[15:56] the more likely you were to get one of the games.

[15:58] It was just like, you scratch my back, I'll scratch your back.

[16:01] And then we also had that BS live from stern pinball that half of the games were going

[16:06] to go overseas.

[16:07] So there was like that built in FOMO that I'm going to have one of 250 of these games

[16:12] in America, right?

[16:13] And that's like, oh, wow, that's only five per state.

[16:15] And I'm going to own one of them.

[16:17] And so it drove a lot of frenzy every time a new game came out, even to the point where

[16:22] people were just buying every single LE, even if they didn't want it, because they knew

[16:27] that the game would have some second hand value and they could flip it for a few thousand

[16:31] dollars and everybody won, right?

[16:33] Because we didn't flip machines back then people for twice the price of a game.

[16:38] We flipped machines for like two to 3000 more.

[16:41] And that's what the market tolerated.

[16:43] It didn't see what's happening right now.

[16:45] Now the sad part now is with a thousand LE's, nothing feels special.

[16:51] A thousand LE's.

[16:53] So you take a great game like Foo Fighters and it comes out and you make a thousand at

[16:57] $13,000 a pop.

[16:59] Remember that game came out this year.

[17:01] It's most likely going to win Game of the Year.

[17:04] It's a terrific game.

[17:05] And now you can go get one new inbox, same year it came out for $10,500.

[17:12] And then you've got these delusional people selling their used Foo Fighters that are opened

[17:16] for like $12,000 when there's a new inbox sitting there, unsold for 10,500.

[17:22] Now they only made 500 Foo Fighters LE's.

[17:25] What happens?

[17:26] I don't think you see as many for sale.

[17:28] I don't think the price goes down as fast.

[17:31] You know and I think people just feel better about owning one of 500.

[17:34] Because what's happening now and you can't blame people is like because they know there's

[17:38] so many out.

[17:40] Even if you get a game and you're enjoying it, in the back of your mind you're thinking

[17:44] well when do I need to move this on because there's so many and I got to get in front

[17:48] of it when all of us who own it might start to get a little bored or there might be a

[17:52] new game coming out and then everyone's trying to free up space immediately.

[17:56] And so what are you going to sell?

[17:57] Am I going to sell this thing that I just paid $13,000 for and try to get some of that

[18:02] back?

[18:03] If I wait too long I could lose $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 on machines.

[18:07] And yes I do believe that people, if Stern keeps making a thousand LEs of all of these

[18:12] games and the art packages aren't radically different and they're really not giving you

[18:16] a ton in the LE packages, you're going to start to see these LEs like lose a ton of

[18:21] value.

[18:22] And all I'm saying is this, I know I talk a lot about prices and limited editions and

[18:27] we don't talk as much about gameplay right?

[18:29] And the reason why is this is what pinballs become.

[18:32] There's so many games you know and I would argue like you know most of them don't really

[18:36] have like the mechanical wow or magic that we want in pinball.

[18:40] It's become more about artwork and code and gameplay.

[18:43] You know I'm more into like the toys, I like the interactive things, I like pinball moments

[18:48] of wow that's really what excites me.

[18:50] And it's a combination of all of it right?

[18:52] It's like the right theme with the right pinball moment, with the right mechanical magic, with

[18:57] everything happening like an orchestra where you just feel so good and when you have a

[19:01] game like that you don't want to sell it.

[19:04] That's the thing about pinball.

[19:05] All of these companies should be aiming to make products you never want to sell and for

[19:10] all of us out there we should be buying things that we don't want to sell.

[19:14] Like I regret selling Batman 66.

[19:17] I love that game so much.

[19:18] I love when you walk up to that game how it puts you into the world of Batman immediately

[19:23] like just another day in Gotham City and in that moment you're into it.

[19:27] I love the fact that it's so easy to understand how to play Batman.

[19:32] You're Batman and Robin trying to jail the villains.

[19:35] The storyline is perfect.

[19:37] It has so many assets.

[19:38] I think it has more assets in Batman than any stern machine of all time and the way you

[19:43] can play the game I could teach Brenda how to play it in two minutes and she can immediately

[19:48] know what she's doing.

[19:50] Try to do that with some other games in pinball these days.

[19:53] Try to explain to somebody how to get into the game and the game itself doesn't pull

[19:57] you in.

[19:58] Like when you start some of these games like Venom it doesn't pull you in.

[20:01] Obviously you crash into this character select screen and you're confused about what's going

[20:06] on.

[20:07] You got to read each character.

[20:08] I mean imagine when you started Batman and it's like do you want to be Batman or Robin?

[20:11] It's like well why do I have to decide.

[20:13] It's like all these things I think a lot of modern pinball has become way too confusing

[20:17] way too complex and I think Batman 66 for me is one of the perfect games ever made from

[20:22] a code standpoint is one of the most immersive games ever made and for those of you who own

[20:27] it and love it you know what I'm talking about.

[20:29] For those of you that get lost on the clunky layout I agree with you.

[20:33] I understand why you don't like the layout but other than the layout everything else

[20:37] in that game is damn perfect.

[20:39] So back to my point like Batman 66 Super Limited Edition my game gets picked up this

[20:44] Saturday I'm super nervous about shipping this game from where it's at to coin taker

[20:49] but I've got the right guy for the job Mr. Derek Musket Derek I love you brother make

[20:54] sure you drive slow put your white gloves on when you pick up the game but take the

[20:59] white gloves off when you are driving your Honda to get this game to coin taker.

[21:04] It is precious cargo and if anything happens I can never replace anything in the game so

[21:08] make sure she arrives perfect but back to my point is we just want games we don't want

[21:14] to sell and I think that's where a lot of us are going to get to especially at these

[21:18] high prices it's easy to just look at your collections and be like hey these games really

[21:22] make me happy and I would probably regret selling any of these when I see these guys

[21:27] like games coming in games coming out and they're constantly losing money I don't understand

[21:32] like how do you enjoy this stuff and when we go to canada's collectors corner you're

[21:35] going to see like a lot of these games nobody plays them what is the point of spending money

[21:40] on a pinball machine you're not going to play everybody we're all going to die we are all

[21:45] going to die we put up a really nice shrine yesterday for day of the dead with everybody

[21:50] we've lost in our family and our friends and our loved ones and our pets and you know look

[21:54] when you really start to stare death in the face and realize that our life on this planet

[21:58] is so short it is so limited why would you buy a pinball machine that is absolutely amazing

[22:05] where there was so much passion put into that machine and you're going to play it 50 times

[22:10] over five years and then just try to sell it for a profit like that is the saddest way

[22:15] to live in my honest opinion and I feel that way about everything the same way like people

[22:20] who buy an expensive Rolex and they won't wear it because they're afraid that it might get

[22:25] stolen or scratch that's the saddest thing ever you know this in the watch collecting

[22:29] world is people don't want to wear their watches because they're afraid they're going to scratch

[22:34] it so they just own a Rolex they put it in a drawer and they stare at it and then they

[22:39] show people it on their wrist on Facebook and then they never wear it out people who

[22:43] buy cars and don't drive them the saddest thing is like these Dodge Demon owners oh I owned

[22:48] a Dodge Demon for five years I'm selling it with 120 miles on the car they didn't even

[22:54] break the car in and then they want to boast about how like oh yeah I've made $50,000 so

[22:59] if you took $100,000 and instead of buying a demon five years ago you put it in the S&P

[23:05] 500 you'd have way more than $150,000 so my point is this buy stuff to keep it forever

[23:12] buy stuff to enjoy it buy stuff because you know you love it and that is the one silver

[23:16] lining for me I like limited edition versions of pinball machines and I'll say this I am torn

[23:22] on Elton John because look I'm not opposed to owning an Elton John pinball machine one day

[23:27] I absolutely love his music now I'm opposed to spending 12 to $15,000 on one and here's the real

[23:35] killer what I would want with Elton John is the Frenchie art package as a collector's edition

[23:41] and then yes I would pick one up one day for like $11,000 but here's the thing is I don't want to

[23:47] own an Elie of anything Jersey Jack I always want to have the best version and now the best

[23:52] version in my honest opinion is the Frenchie version of the game and I think they've absolutely

[23:59] destroyed so many different marketing decisions around this game and I think they need to switch

[24:03] it is it really too late to switch like why didn't they bring in a focus group and say hey which one

[24:09] looks nicer and this is why I'll probably never own an Elton John because I want the Frenchie game

[24:14] I just love it I don't like the way the John Yowsie version looks and so now you know I don't want it

[24:20] I don't want it I absolutely don't want it and you shouldn't feel that way the limited version the

[24:25] collector's edition should always be the nicest version of the game and it's not just me saying

[24:29] that everybody is saying that the Frenchie version blows away the collector's edition as an appearance

[24:36] package that's just my feeling with all these companies we need to get back down to 500 being

[24:40] the number of le's and if you're Jersey Jack you might as well go back to 250 collector's editions

[24:46] you're not going to win keeping parody with stern at a thousand units just nothing feels special

[24:51] all right we're good let's go to canada's collector's corner and let's look at some games for sale

[24:55] at a high price and ask ourselves is this worth it is this a game worth collecting all of this

[25:01] is subjective but I just want to give you my opinions if I saw this game pop up would I feel

[25:05] like oh man that's actually something I would consider or oh man this is crazy all right the

[25:10] first one is kind of crazy so for sale a multi-morphic p3 system with every game final resistance

[25:18] heist weird owl cosmic heart racing and lexie lightspeed all right you ready for this if you

[25:23] want to buy every multi-morphic game this game is being listed for 22 000 I mean this is the problem

[25:29] with the platform jerry 22 000 I mean come on nobody's buying this it's just easy easy pass at

[25:37] that much money all right here's one wizard of Oz yellow brick road number nine for 14 five I'm

[25:43] going to say this right now I would rather own a wizard of Oz yellow brick road than an elton

[25:48] john for 15 000 I'll tell you why even though elton john shoots better even though elton john is

[25:54] probably more fun from a gameplay standpoint wizard of Oz to me is still the pinnacle of jersey

[26:00] jack pinball because it's like the game they made where they really wanted to make a statement and

[26:05] they put everything in it now look the yellow brick road edition does not have the flying monkey

[26:10] but they made a lot of improvements to that version of the game and so that version of the

[26:14] game is gonna hold up the best and this is another game where this game came out years ago and it has

[26:20] 271 games played on it what's wrong with these collectors 271 games when I've bought a new

[26:28] pinball machine I've put that many plays on in a week like what is the point like why like tell me

[26:35] please to you rich gentleman out there who have OCD who can't play your machines what is it about

[26:41] pinball that makes you not want to play it I don't think there's anything more inviting than a pinball

[26:47] machine and if you want to keep your game looking good just put an $80 playfield protector into the

[26:53] game and play it 5000 times like enjoy your stuff people now look yellow brick road at 145 I think

[27:01] that price is a little high but I do think we're gonna start to see more and more people if jersey

[27:06] jack games keep going down this barren road where there's not a lot in it I think we're gonna see a

[27:11] lot of price stability on some of the earlier jersey jack games I mean it is absolutely bonkers

[27:17] the game I would buy easily right now if I were buying any jersey jack game I would go buy a dialed

[27:23] in for like 7500 to $8000 a dialed in le to me is like the greatest bang for the buck in pinball

[27:31] I mean it's crazy to me that dialed in can be had for like two to $3000 less than labyrinth dialed in

[27:38] I mean look at the game it's got so much in it yes I get the theme is terrible but at $7500 it's

[27:45] not terrible now all of a sudden it's almost the price of a stern pro and it's the best bang for

[27:50] buck in pinball here's a game that I think is again gonna keep holding value attack from Mars remake

[27:55] le here's the thing with all these cgc games this one is being listed for $14500 but here's another

[28:01] sad thing this one's coming from Saratoga Springs this one has a hundred and seventy five plays on

[28:07] it 175 plays again what is with these people they don't play their games anyway being that cgc is

[28:14] the disaster and being that cgc can't make anything I think that the older cgc games I saw them all

[28:21] in a lineup the other day someone had like every cgc le lined up in a row with the toppers and the

[28:27] lights and it was gorgeous and I think what's gonna happen is people are gonna realize that these

[28:32] bali williams games were magical they still are magical they've aged very well and nobody built them

[28:39] better than cgc I think they're gonna hold their value as more and more people get into this hobby

[28:44] finding an le of a cgc machine of these remakes is not going to be easy because people are not

[28:50] gonna let them go there's a reason why they remade them is that the games are just amazing

[28:55] and they're classics so a 14 five attack from mars le I don't think is out of the realm of possibility

[29:02] and again I'd rather own this game than an elton john collectors edition I'd rather offer a little

[29:08] bit more on a game like this then spend $13,000 on a venom le here's probably the best thing listed

[29:15] on the pin side marketplace a professional flight simulator for $38,000 I just want to buy this and

[29:22] fly back to the time when pinball prices were normal I mean it is absolutely mind boggling

[29:28] how many games come up now when you look for $14,000 or more there are so many machines for sale

[29:35] and it's just bonkers I also want to fly back to a time when people weren't delusional like this

[29:40] next person this person is selling an alvira premium with a topper and airbrushed features

[29:46] for $15,000 okay so think about that for a minute you have a premium machine of alvira that is

[29:53] unlimited and you're gonna ask for $15,000 and the new black and white only 500 being made for

[30:00] $13,000 just came out and looks far superior than anyone's customized premium this is the delusion

[30:07] that's crazy in pinball nobody is buying this nobody unless this person's mama wants to buy it to make

[30:13] him feel special it's never happening okay so why do these people so delusional why do they think

[30:18] their baby is worth so much more than the brand new baby that's just put in a box that's the nicest

[30:23] version of alvira ever we're starting to see more pirates of the carabines this one okay you want to

[30:28] laugh at this one a pirates of the carabine in charlotte north carolina for $34,900 firm remember

[30:36] this game new in box was $12,500 now here's the best part about it pirates of the carabine

[30:42] has been out now for about like six or seven years this game is being listed for sale with

[30:49] 20 total plays 20 plays okay so think about that for a minute wow wow what was the point

[30:57] what was the point of buying this game and never playing it man the more i read this stuff the more

[31:02] i'm like man being a pinball collector is kind of lame it's kind of lame being a pinball collector

[31:07] that doesn't play your games here's my beautiful wife we're getting divorced i slept with her twice

[31:13] like what why why why not more you know why not more it's just so weird to me it's so weird to me

[31:19] that there's so much ocd-ness in this hobby like really and if you're gonna be ocd about something

[31:25] then collect artwork all right collect artwork think about it when you collect a painting and you

[31:30] put it on the wall and you go to sell it you don't have to embarrassingly say i only looked at it 20

[31:36] times i mean that's like the artistic equivalent of i only walked into this room 20 times and enjoyed

[31:41] it i mean seriously please gang if you're gonna sell a game with 20 plays on it be a man be a man

[31:48] and put another 200 plays on it before you sell it just be like look you know i decided to throw

[31:53] back some whiskies and realize i'm gonna die like the rest of us and i just wanted to enjoy this thing

[31:59] before i let it go but to sell it without enjoying it before you let it go is only telegraphing one

[32:05] thing that you only care about the money but these people don't need money these people selling

[32:10] 35 000 machines that's not gonna do anything for you if you made a 20 000 profit on a pirate to the

[32:17] Caribbean but never played it i still think the person that played it for six years and enjoyed

[32:22] every single game had a more rich life than you do you know let me repeat that people who play

[32:29] their games and enjoy them are living a much better life than people who are afraid to play their

[32:35] pinball machines it's like such an emasculating thing you know i've got it i'm just not gonna jump

[32:40] on it i mean you know because what about the resale value of the same things with guys who own cars

[32:45] i'm not gonna put any miles on it i'm gonna save my wife for the next guy just so sad trust me people

[32:52] i wear my Gucci clothing every day because what's the point it's like the same thing it's like you

[32:56] have a nice outfit wear it all the time okay so a pirate ce for 34 9 would i buy it no i wouldn't

[33:03] i think for me the most i would ever spend on this game is like maybe the high 20 sorry Derek

[33:08] sorry my boy Derek's got one i'm like you should have sold it you should have sold it at the height

[33:12] of covid because to me 35 for a pirate is covid pricing it's not gonna happen right now um here's

[33:18] one that's interesting a ghost fosters ellie in excellent condition for 17 5 doesn't have the

[33:26] topper you know i would consider ghost busters and i don't like the way the game plays but it's

[33:31] ghost busters and there's only 500 so that's not a crazy price for this game now look it says or

[33:38] best offer i would offer like 15 for a ghost busters again i'd rather have a ghost busters for 15

[33:44] than a venom for 13 or an elton john here's another pirate to the caribbean ce for 33 000

[33:51] a ghost busters with the topper for 20 000 or best offer oh guys these toppers are now worth like

[34:00] 5000 it's crazy it's hard to price a ghost busters topper you know how do you even price a ghost

[34:07] busters topper it's the cheapest topper stern is ever made but it has so much value because of

[34:12] its scarcity to me ghost busters ellie is around the 15 000 range it just is it's still a dmd game

[34:19] it's a horrible shooter but it's beautiful right it is beautiful and i would buy one and i would

[34:24] play it every single day but i wouldn't spend more than 15 000 on a ghost busters ellie and i would

[34:29] want the topper on it for 15 000 here's a metallica road case edition signed by the band wow from great

[34:37] american pinball for 1995 get out of here they know like i know that metallica anniversary edition

[34:44] is coming so i would go nowhere near a 20 000 metallica here's a funny one in burlington north

[34:51] carolina there seems to be a gentleman who likes to keep his games in boxes and that's the other

[34:56] thing right i love these guys who have no intent on opening up the game okay so he's got a deadpool le

[35:03] number 007 and a guardians le number 007 the deadpool is 17 9 and the guardians is 18 9 so

[35:12] basically he's asking about nine to ten thousand dollars over what these games were because they

[35:18] are in a box so now you're paying a lot for that cardboard box because both of these games are

[35:23] selling for much less money opened up and then you get number 007 which is also strange to me

[35:29] is that some weird flex like you're james bond playing guardians of the galaxy and deadpool

[35:35] why would anyone want game number 007 unless it was james bond really weird idea here these

[35:43] games are not going to sell i wouldn't go anywhere near them for that price i don't like buying old

[35:48] new in box the only time i like buying old new in box stuff is when the price is cheaper than it was

[35:53] new in box or i'm not spending a tremendous premium on the box itself you know what i'm saying because

[35:59] once you open the box why do you want to take a huge hit and and again because you see like these

[36:03] guys don't play their games like these collectors don't play their games like six years and i put

[36:08] 20 plays on pirates here's an alvira house of horrors 40th anniversary edition for $20,000 in

[36:15] tosa oklahoma that is not going to sell now that the blood kiss edition is $7,000 cheaper new in box

[36:22] another pirate c e there are three pirate c e's for sale right now under 300 plays everybody under

[36:29] 300 well how many is under like one or 299 this person wants the 32,000 or best offer he's not

[36:37] going to get it covet prices here's the saddest one james bond 60th in megwan wisconsin okay remember

[36:46] when this game was $20,000 remember when there were podcasters out there who also are distributors

[36:52] told you that stern priced it accordingly remember those days this person now is selling a $20,000

[36:59] james bond 60th in less than a year for $14,300 it's been on pin side for 20 days it's not sold

[37:08] just funny to me it's funny to me this game was the worst investment in the history of pinball

[37:13] nothing's gone down this much in value in a single year there's been no game that has lost this much

[37:18] value in a single year like not even thunderbirds lost this much value and gang there's a ton of

[37:23] them for sale like it's not even like oh yeah this is just one of one no there are a lot for sale

[37:28] right now all right the final item here is actually one of the most interesting items i've seen for

[37:34] sale on pin side ever so think about it this is a for sale in australia a pirates of the caribbean

[37:42] prototype that has the original software and the original triple spinning discs in the game my first

[37:50] question was how did they even have this it is listed for the very affordable price of $48,000

[37:58] $48,000 if you want to have the original prototype game that has the working treasure trunk

[38:06] and also has the triple spinning discs with the software that utilize those triple spinning discs

[38:13] they're fully functional this is one of those are like wow like how do you really put a price on a

[38:18] game like this right there's been no other prototype sales of pirates the problem with this kind of

[38:24] game like this it's a unicorn it's absolutely a unicorn like there's no other one out there there

[38:29] might be two prototypes in existence that they brought to the shows the problem with it is the

[38:34] code wasn't completed so there's that like you're not going to get the final code of the game and

[38:40] the most polished version of the game the problem is like pirates it's just like weird games like

[38:44] owning this version of the game the game was a failure like the game was a total failure people

[38:50] didn't want it and they only wanted it when they couldn't have it and now you've got this like one

[38:55] of one rare unicorn version of the game and it really is only going to have value to someone who

[39:02] maybe this is their favorite game of all time I mean that's really the market for something at 48,000

[39:08] you're speaking to someone who like wants to have the one-of-one thing and just will make them sleep

[39:14] better at night knowing they own Eric Minier's original version of the game right his original

[39:20] vision for this game and then the question is like does that person even exist right and I don't know

[39:25] right I don't know would I buy it at this price absolutely not could I see why someone would want

[39:32] this game sure I could absolutely see it at this price that's a lot of money I mean that's a lot

[39:39] of money 48,000 and you're still just going to roughly have the same game everybody else has and

[39:45] I would say like the triple spinning disc isn't enough right it's not enough of a difference or a

[39:51] major difference to absolutely warrant this kind of premium over the other games but yeah just an

[39:58] interesting game for sale it's something that like I'm not sure like I'm not sure if that one person

[40:03] exists that would want to buy it at this price everybody thank you for being a member of Canada's

[40:07] pinball podcast I know this episode went a little longer if it felt longer for you it was longer for

[40:12] me because I had to record the show all over again yeah so I'm gonna go hit the gym now remember

[40:18] take care of yourselves more than your pinball machines take care of your families and play your

[40:24] games and don't worry about all these like high priced limited flexing pinball machines at the

[40:30] end of the day when all this said and done the person having the most fun in this hobby only

[40:35] owns one machine that person saved up to get it they've got one machine in their home and they

[40:42] play it every day and they love it that is the person who's winning in pinball it's not the person

[40:47] with 15 games who doesn't want to play them it's not the person who has a $30,000 pirates and is

[40:54] boasting about 20 plays only we have such a short time on this planet you should only buy something

[41:01] that you never want to sell you should marry a woman you never want to divorce you know you

[41:06] should have kids because you want them you should live in an area of the world because you love it

[41:11] you know people get me grief all the time they're like oh why don't you move out of your shoebox

[41:14] why don't you move out of New York City I am looking but you want to know the truth the reason I

[41:19] don't move out of New York City is I love it I love what this city has I love the fact that I can

[41:24] walk to work I can walk to a Michelin star restaurant I can walk to Gucci I can walk to go play pinball

[41:30] I can move it keeps me active there is an energy to this city that is absolutely amazing and for

[41:36] those of you who don't live in New York City and you read about New York City in the media of course

[41:41] you're gonna hate New York City but I'll tell you when I go anywhere else yeah it's cleaner yeah it's

[41:45] this yeah it's that doesn't have the energy it doesn't have the vibe doesn't wake me up the way

[41:49] New York City does which is ironic because right now I'm just trying to be put to sleep more in

[41:53] New York City and get some rest but that's my final thing people enjoy your games and you know you

[41:57] don't need more and this is the thing that's really funny about the hobby right now at these high

[42:02] prices none of you need another game unless it's a dream game that you never want to get rid of and

[42:08] that's my only advice is wait and see wait until that game comes out we're gonna get back to the

[42:13] future we're gonna get matrix you know of course we're gonna get shiny boxes of lights like Elton

[42:18] John put in front of us but if you don't really want it it's an easy pass if you don't really like

[42:23] labyrinth you don't have to get one if you're a grown adult who hasn't watched Scooby-Doo in 40 years

[42:28] yeah you don't have to have one you can go enjoy one on location everybody thank you for being a

[42:33] member of Canadian Spinball podcast the only show that talks to you like this it's like everybody
