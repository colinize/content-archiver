[00:00] You know, I was trying to get an Nintendo Wii.

[00:07] See, that's how tired I am.

[00:09] A Switch 2.

[00:11] We were just talking about the Wii.

[00:12] And wondering whether or not the Wii launch is...

[00:15] I think the Wii 1 launch is going to...

[00:18] It's not going to be the same, the Switch 2 launch.

[00:20] Like, it's not going to have the same fanfare to get one.

[00:24] But see here.

[00:27] This is so impromptu.

[00:29] Let's go on YouTube right now.

[00:31] My people know we're here.

[00:32] We are on YouTube.

[00:33] See how tired I am?

[00:34] Let's go to Facebook.

[00:36] Let's let these guys know.

[00:40] Dan a little late night.

[00:45] Ah, doing a little late night.

[00:49] Impromptu.

[00:55] Okay.

[00:59] See if anyone comes in.

[01:00] We usually get a few people here.

[01:02] What's up?

[01:03] Potter next week.

[01:06] Stabbing that.

[01:07] That's the word is...

[01:11] You know, probably will be Harry Potter day.

[01:14] You know, Jersey Jack was, I think, testing its new website.

[01:19] And they usually do that before...

[01:24] See, come join.

[01:32] Okay.

[01:36] How's everybody doing?

[01:38] I was...

[01:39] The reason I'm up late, believe me, I fell asleep at 9.30, 10.

[01:47] And this midnight Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order thing happened.

[01:56] So I joined my friends to go try to get one on Best Buy, on Walmart, on Target, and

[02:03] was unsuccessful.

[02:04] Let me see.

[02:05] Well, I'm in a cart here.

[02:07] I'm in line still on Best Buy.

[02:13] But I don't really care that much.

[02:15] But they're going to be so easy to get.

[02:18] They're going to be stacked to the ceilings at all these retailers come June 5th.

[02:22] I'm not that concerned.

[02:26] Who's in the house right now?

[02:27] We're going to just for a little bit.

[02:28] This is not going to be the longest show.

[02:30] This is going to be a little late night.

[02:34] What's on my mind, Pimbalwah?

[02:36] It's Harry Potter next week.

[02:38] I mean, Harry Potter next week would be a good time to drop it, I think, especially with

[02:43] all these people that just ordered Kong.

[02:45] I don't think people are going to regret ordering Kong.

[02:47] I do think people are going to regret ordering Kong Ali right away.

[02:51] Because I do think Kong Ali is not going to be hard to get.

[02:54] Nor will it be over $13,000.

[02:59] Or even $13,000 for very long.

[03:02] Yeah, I'm not usually up at this time.

[03:09] It is so the currency of adulthood.

[03:12] Is it not?

[03:14] Sleep in peace of mind are the two currencies of adulthood.

[03:21] What is sleep?

[03:24] It's Thursday there and Wednesday here.

[03:30] What's the major mech in Puder?

[03:37] If I were to guess, I don't know what the major mech in Puder is.

[03:42] I think the moving staircase ramps are going to be one of the major mechs.

[03:47] I think just going off of the films themselves, I would expect there's going to be some

[03:56] quiddage, upper play field with maybe with wire forms, like looping around Hogwarts.

[04:04] I mean, if there ever was a moment for Richie to be like, I don't know, I made something

[04:10] in Star Wars that would be perfect for a match of quiddage.

[04:19] I think that would be awesome.

[04:22] A lot of speed as you're going around with Harry and friends on the broomsticks.

[04:27] The synced clips.

[04:31] You know how I feel about this whole thing?

[04:34] You know what's funny is I was just talking to some dude on the Patreon page and he was

[04:40] like, what do you mean Willy Wonka has no assets?

[04:43] It's got all the assets.

[04:44] I'm like, bro, have you ever seen the Willy Wonka movie?

[04:49] It's a freaking musical.

[04:51] Every room of the chocolate factory is a different musical song in which each song is connected

[04:57] to each of the kids.

[04:59] One of that is in the game.

[05:02] The pinball machine does not recreate the Willy Wonka movie at all the way it should

[05:07] have.

[05:10] It would actually make sense in Harry Potter.

[05:12] Yep, it would.

[05:17] I helped you out by posting a proper link to chat.

[05:23] Did I post a broken link in my, I don't even, gang, I've been so busy at work, I probably

[05:28] did.

[05:35] Let's see.

[05:40] I posted the right one.

[05:45] Let's see if it's still down.

[05:47] No, it's my link works.

[05:53] I'm going to be popping back and forth with my best buy switch to order.

[06:04] That's why I'm up this late trying to get an antenna switch to.

[06:08] It'll be easy to get one.

[06:09] I'm not worried, I don't care.

[06:10] It's one of those things where I get a rather just $100 more and just get it.

[06:17] Did you trust Jack to let Eric do his thing?

[06:21] Yeah, I do.

[06:24] I do.

[06:25] I don't think Eric is going to release a game that's going to be empty like Godfather and

[06:33] devoid of toys like Guns of Roses.

[06:36] It's a magic, it's a magic theme.

[06:37] It needs toys.

[06:43] Let's see.

[06:50] A switch and switching games.

[06:55] I know.

[06:56] Well, it's crazy gang.

[06:58] I'm on with my friends from some of my geek friends.

[07:03] These are kids that are all having good careers.

[07:08] We're talking about video game prices.

[07:10] They're like, it's $450, it's $5.

[07:13] I'm looking at this thing.

[07:15] This is what Pinball does to you.

[07:18] Completely desensitized as you do.

[07:21] What normal people spend for entertainment in the gaming realm.

[07:25] It's like, I'm looking at the cart and it's $480.

[07:30] I'm like, what is this?

[07:33] This is a quarter of the price of a cheap plastic Mandalorian topper.

[07:39] It's the bundle with Mario Kart World.

[07:42] I'm like, I can't even tell you guys, this is so cheap.

[07:48] I don't even know how to process being able to like.

[07:54] For people to think that's expensive.

[07:57] Most people are complaining about Nintendo charging $80 for a game for the first time.

[08:03] $80 for a game.

[08:06] The dumbass is in our hobby.

[08:07] We'll drop $200 on a plastic sculpted, not even sculpted, probably 3D printed, shooter

[08:15] rod handle $200.

[08:21] When millions of dollars went into arnding that game made by thousands of people and it's

[08:28] like two dudes make a 3D sculpted shooter rod handle for $200.

[08:35] Yeah, it's not a wide body.

[08:46] I know that.

[08:50] You know, I think, I don't know how you guys feel, but I do feel there's a point.

[08:58] Everybody reaches where, you know, buy what makes you happy and all that is true.

[09:04] But I don't think modern pinball pricing is satisfying most people.

[09:11] Like they're just not seeing the value in these mass produced, overpriced.

[09:21] And yeah, it's like, because a pinball experience game, I don't understand.

[09:28] If you'd buy a $15,000 pinball machine, then you better get everything and it better

[09:37] be one of the best things ever made.

[09:42] You know, I mean, I'm looking now like it's crazy.

[09:44] I'm seeing a lot of Godfather's CES go up for sale because, I mean, these guys now know

[09:50] like, not only is it, I got to be completely candid.

[09:55] A Godfather's CES now candidly, a price which will move your game is eight.

[10:06] Like nothing's something, no one's buying a $9800, no one's buying a $10, no one's buying

[10:10] at, you know, $92, no, eight, eight on the table, eight.

[10:18] That's how like, nobody wants it, nobody now.

[10:23] So if you bought Godfather's CES, you just lost $7,000.

[10:33] Yeah, you know, people forget Nintendo Entertainment System was $200 when it came out in 1985.

[10:49] I don't know, man, like back then that would have been like $800 for the system.

[10:58] So I don't know.

[11:01] If you sell Guns and Roses, what are you going to replace it with?

[11:07] You know, it's a good question.

[11:11] I sigh like that because I don't want to ever have to lift another pinball machine up

[11:18] those stairs.

[11:20] But it was tantamount to suicide trying to push that GNR up those stairs and we finally

[11:28] got it up the stairs, you know, so it's like, I almost don't ever want to have to, like,

[11:34] I'll happily slide.

[11:35] I almost only want to replace it with a stern because stern's are so much lighter than

[11:40] Jersey Jack, so much lighter.

[11:48] Wait, who just said, JJ pinnines are rethink, no, they don't, they don't need to re-theme

[11:58] the Godfather layout.

[11:59] They need to just never make a game like that again.

[12:04] No one's like, no one's like gushing about Godfather's layout or it's, you know, or

[12:10] it's gameplay.

[12:11] It's just, it's not worth ever revisiting anything with that game.

[12:18] Yeah, I mean, look, it's, you know, I'll say this.

[12:32] I'm very happy for my beautiful wife.

[12:34] She, she's been working her ass off.

[12:37] She just got a really nice bonus and she could go buy like a couple of things.

[12:41] Little high and pinball machines after tax is easily, you know, and I'm like, so proud

[12:46] of her.

[12:48] And that's the last thing she would do with that money.

[12:50] So it's like, because she's smart.

[12:58] Guns and roses has one of the most unbalanced scoring ever.

[13:02] Like the problem with Jean R is like, it's like, you don't, the pathway to

[13:11] points is so imbalanced.

[13:13] It doesn't even make sense to even care about the songs because once you get to like the,

[13:21] the, the album modes, there were so much more points like you get, if you do the Chinese

[13:28] democracy and you do it right and you do five consecutive shots when you're in the Chinese

[13:35] democracy mode, you know, shall we play a game?

[13:38] You can get like 600 million points with one mode.

[13:44] So there's, it's like what they see the thing that sucks about Jean R is they may, is

[13:54] it, it should be more about getting to sympathy for the no sympathy for the devil.

[14:02] It should be like the reason you play and there should be different ways to get there.

[14:08] You'll like never get there with the outlaying drains.

[14:12] There's not enough extra balls.

[14:14] There's too many multi balls, but it doesn't matter.

[14:16] It's like you're just, you're never, you have to go through, you have to start four albums

[14:22] to go through four songs, also play your encores.

[14:26] They see what Jean R did, what they did wrong in Jean R instead of all these multi balls

[14:30] what they should have done is encores should have been like a free ball victory lap mode,

[14:39] which by that what I mean, if like, if you're on, you know, your first ball and you get

[14:46] through a song and you get to encore, then you shouldn't lose your ball if you drain

[14:53] during the encore of the song.

[14:56] And it should just, it should just let you keep going in encore.

[15:00] But like, it's just weird to me that like, it's, it just feels like you get punished for,

[15:08] you don't even need to get to the encore, then you get punished.

[15:11] If your ball drains in encore, then you've lost your first ball.

[15:14] Like, it's, I don't know, I just think they should have, to me, Jean R is a game where

[15:19] if we, if they got all the fans of that game, well, they had a subway in Jean R and Pat

[15:26] Lawler yanked it out.

[15:27] You know where the subway went, the subway was the backstage.

[15:30] So if you went up through the flippers, that's where the subway was.

[15:34] There was one there.

[15:36] And then there was another one.

[15:38] So they did, there was two.

[15:41] The thing with the thing is, I still think gang and I mean this, like if Jersey Jack called

[15:46] together like 10 guns or own his owners and got them in a room and said, hey, how can

[15:52] we like just make this game software wise so much more fun than play, they could do it,

[15:58] they could do it, they just refuse to like revisit it.

[16:04] Yeah, I think the soft plunger is a huge mistake.

[16:10] No doubt about it.

[16:13] No doubt about it.

[16:16] And the soft plums, like just so many times it just plunges right down the middle,

[16:20] right down the middle, right down the middle.

[16:23] Anyway, but that's the past.

[16:26] So where's everybody getting this rumor from that Harry Potter is next week?

[16:30] I keep seeing people say that.

[16:32] Is that true?

[16:34] Is that true?

[16:35] Is how good do we feel about that?

[16:40] Let's see.

[16:42] I'm just curious what the vibe is on the inside.

[16:52] Man, I like, I worry, I'm worried about, you know, people sending in their full payments

[17:05] for Alice, for Pulp Fiction, for Evil Dead, for King Kong, for D&D, for, you know,

[17:17] these people who buy everything are there and they're in for a rough, rough beginning

[17:20] of the year.

[17:21] All right, let's see.

[17:33] I think where, I mean, it has to be soon.

[17:44] And that's the thing about, I'm looking on the pin side.

[18:00] No, I don't know.

[18:01] I don't know why people are saying May 2nd.

[18:03] I mean, I mean, it's International Harry Potter Day, like that's the guess.

[18:15] Alice is a bust.

[18:17] Well, Alice isn't a bust, Josh, for Melvin.

[18:20] He sold them all.

[18:23] Is Alice just a bust for the buyers?

[18:27] You know a game is, I think, just not going to recover as Mel is a Merlin's Arcade.

[18:34] Do you hear anybody talking about Merlin's Arcade?

[18:36] I mean, I feel bad for Chris Turner, because I think he just like, I mean, dude, he showed

[18:42] the game like so early.

[18:46] And then he opened up orders on it, guys.

[18:48] Like, let me see, I'm trying to find the Merlin's Arcade.

[18:58] It's all M and M, when you type in Merlin, Merlin's Arcade, where's he?

[19:06] Let's see.

[19:22] I can't even find like where is.

[19:29] What the problem with like Merlin's Arcade now, too, is like the terms and conditions.

[19:44] It was like a non-refundable deposit.

[19:47] You'll get your game within two years.

[19:49] It's like, come on.

[19:51] And the game's like 9 grand.

[19:57] There is no American Pimmel gang.

[19:59] They're done.

[20:00] Like they'll come out with Cuphead because of licensure agreements.

[20:04] And then that's it.

[20:05] They're never going to make another game.

[20:08] Cuphead is going to bomb gang.

[20:09] It's going to bomb.

[20:12] Raise your hands.

[20:13] Have any of you even ever played Cuphead?

[20:16] Like who's into Cuphead in this demo?

[20:18] Anybody?

[20:19] I don't know.

[20:20] Not me.

[20:21] I've never met anybody who's ever like talked to me about that game.

[20:27] Look, I get it's a good game.

[20:42] But like it's, and you want a Pimball version of Cuphead after playing Cuphead on like the

[20:49] Xbox.

[20:50] You want it on a, you want to spend 10 grand on one?

[20:57] Yeah, exactly.

[21:01] So enjoy your $20 Cuphead and save yourself 10 grand.

[21:10] It's of course going to have the loop to loop.

[21:18] Here's my advice to all of you, my late night advice.

[21:26] I don't buy anything until, okay, hold on a second.

[21:32] Let me just turn off this near-gear.

[21:37] Oh, tired.

[21:44] You go to bed.

[21:53] I got a better haircut today.

[21:59] You know, it's funny in this town.

[22:05] It's barbershops and these like Darien's and these wealthy neighborhoods like $80.

[22:11] Look at this barbershop.

[22:13] $80 for one haircut for a man.

[22:18] A point man only, right?

[22:20] The pretentiousness of a now man are making appointments for haircuts like that.

[22:28] So I was like, Brenda, where did you take Kylian?

[22:31] She's like, well, just just, you know, in South Norwalk, it's called the Family Barbershop

[22:38] or the Neighborhood Barbershop.

[22:39] And it's like these amazing like Latino guys, playing music, like walk right in.

[22:48] I get like the best haircut I've had in years for $30.

[22:56] And like I could tell too, like, because you can tell when you get a haircut, right?

[23:01] Like who's actually putting in the work and who's just like, it's lazy.

[23:04] Anyway, here's my advice for all of you.

[23:08] I would, I think there's going to be, you know, some fun games that really do come out this year, right?

[23:17] I still think I kind of have an update for you guys.

[23:23] I'm back to the future.

[23:25] I'll give that to my Patreon subscribers, though.

[23:29] So, but my thing is this, if I were you and, you know, you don't expect to die in the next like year,

[23:39] I think the smartest thing to do would be to wait until October of this year to make your next

[23:55] pinball purchase.

[23:58] I know that's going to require some willpower.

[24:02] And come October, you'll be able to get, you know, any version of these King Kongs for much less money,

[24:10] you'll be able to get Harry Potter CE for cheaper than 15 because they're going to make so many of them.

[24:16] It's funny because, and all the code will be done on these current games.

[24:20] Also, you'll be able to see the next game from Stern and the next remastered from Stern.

[24:27] And, you know, if, and if you make it there, right, because here's the thing, if you make it to October and you're ready to buy,

[24:36] you're going to have like all these options, finalized code, everything, you know, everything, the world's going to be your oyster.

[24:44] And then, if nothing tickles your fancy, you'll get peeled juice in just a month or two, two months.

[24:54] Well, I mean, there's a new Stern game every four months.

[24:57] So if we're looking at King Kong and April Mayish.

[25:08] Yeah, it's always August, September is the next Stern.

[25:13] I mean, I hope it's going to be walking dead.

[25:21] I have update on back to the future.

[25:31] I'm not 100% sure of anything, this hobby.

[25:37] The only time I'm 100% sure of anything is if I've seen photos myself, and I've heard it from the horse's mouth.

[25:47] Whether it's Beetlejuice or Goonies, they're both instant day one salads for spooky.

[25:56] But I would, the reason why I would wait is this. Here's why because I.

[26:03] 90, how much? Okay, has anyone bought a King Kong premium? How much is a King Kong premium out the door for a customer right now?

[26:14] Who can 90 500 or 9700? What is a, what is the street price on a Kong premium?

[26:22] All right, okay, so, all right, and we all know that King Kong code won't be done until the fall, right?

[26:32] I guarantee you, come fall.

[26:37] King Kong premiums will be closer to 7,700, not 9700.

[26:42] Now, what Stern is, I think, kind of trying to say they're going to do is like they're just doing one run now of Kong, and that's it.

[26:49] For a while, like that's they're going to try to do that.

[26:59] So, and here's what's going to happen. I think I don't look, I don't think Kong L.E.

[27:05] I think everyone's finally realizing that King Kong L.E. has like basically the same exact look and art package as the premium and pro.

[27:15] So, like they really messed up and not making the L.E. like super unique looking. I'm sorry.

[27:21] And then you know Stern's going to come out with the official armor and other accessories to all make it look exact.

[27:27] I'm still in line for an Nintendo switch, too. This is so stupid. I'm never getting it.

[27:33] I don't even care. I'm just closing all these windows out.

[27:38] Let's go on Pim's side right now. I'm looking at Kong L.E.

[27:41] If it's sold out yet.

[27:45] King Kong.

[27:48] King Kong L.E.

[27:54] I mean, this is this is not a good sign, gang.

[28:00] This is like not a.

[28:06] It's not a good sign.

[28:12] When was the last time? I mean, I mean, all of a sudden.

[28:20] What I'm noticing is.

[28:26] You know, those Florida ones have been up forever. I don't know, like, but now more getting added to this list.

[28:32] What's going to happen next is.

[28:36] Because remember when they make like 932.

[28:40] There are a lot of distros and dealers that hold a few back.

[28:45] Then all of a sudden they have more.

[28:48] You know, you notice that like, oh, sold out of all of our allotments.

[28:52] All that means they bought their.

[28:55] They're testing the market. Zach does that, too. He holds a few back.

[28:59] They all hold a few back.

[29:02] And.

[29:04] And then what happens is this.

[29:08] Oh my god, like everybody like.

[29:14] Look, they're going to sell more Nintendo switch to in one day than all pinball wheel in the next decade.

[29:24] Right. It's funny.

[29:28] But.

[29:31] You guys know, like what's fun about watching the L.E. market is this.

[29:35] It's like when it doesn't catch fire.

[29:38] And it's still available.

[29:41] Then all those ones are still still being held back for speculative reasons.

[29:47] Then they all start to pop up for sale.

[29:50] And you know, I get I just don't think there's enough.

[29:54] I just don't know if you're interested in the L.E.

[29:58] This time around.

[30:00] And like.

[30:02] Yeah, you might as well just because remember, like premiums $3,300 cheaper.

[30:07] I mean, no brainer.

[30:11] Gang, it's it's a all original king Kong story.

[30:22] Test printed that only six developers.

[30:27] Okay.

[30:29] So the main part is that one of fiveends to ...

[30:34] I mean, the other thing I wanted to express ONLY the best is kind of it already.

[30:39] A really auspicious comment in the recent break.

[30:43] Whether you like anything else.

[30:47] I don't know.

[30:48] I think that's it.

[30:50] Sorry, like this code wise, this game is gonna be more like Avengers and less like Godzilla and

[30:59] and you know and jaws.

[31:04] And I think that's why if this game had way had like King Kong assets and looked a lot more

[31:13] like you know like I don't know but when I see the animations on King Kong is a love story

[31:21] the anime you know his facial expressions his emotions you know the beauty in King Kong and I'm not saying

[31:30] really

[31:32] any of that in the any of the clips I saw from Stern so far like it's like there's the

[31:39] there's the moments that that needs balance out his fury that make the King Kong story so romantic

[31:47] and I and when I look at the Stern game it's just it's the it's a kid's Netflix

[31:53] Kong it's not Kong

[32:00] No but gang jaws is about the humans trying to hunt

[32:08] while they're being hunted right jaws is about humanity and it's fear of going in the water

[32:15] and it's you know it's it's desired to like conquer like the habitat that's not its own right and

[32:22] and that's jaws isn't about the shark it's about the humans but King Kong

[32:29] okay so if you say King Kong is about the it King Kong is about the relationship between

[32:35] Kong and Ann and that's not really happening in this game at all

[32:40] let me let me show you um let's do this

[32:51] and this was always my favorite scene

[33:11] how about

[33:13] before we start

[33:23] sure

[33:38] Because like, I just...

[33:42] Let me share something with you guys.

[33:55] Just look at the romance of this.

[34:02] And tell me this isn't what you'd rather have on the screen

[34:05] than those childlike animations.

[34:08] Oh.

[34:12] How good this would be, you know,

[34:15] in an unapimbal screen.

[34:17] The lighting, the atmosphere, the music.

[34:32] Look at that.

[34:38] The music.

[35:01] They could have just made this movie.

[35:03] Just get the license for this King Kong.

[35:08] My point being, you know, you see what I'm talking about though.

[35:31] They're like, oh, but, you know, there's this...

[35:37] Now, keep this visual in mind.

[35:42] Right?

[35:45] And then...

[35:56] Let's look at what we get in Pimbal.

[35:59] And I'm like, I get it.

[36:01] It's like, it's the direction they went.

[36:06] But it's just...

[36:29] We're in Moussa, John Bondo.

[36:35] Here, X-Tar, we just...

[36:36] On these platforms.

[36:38] It's one of them twice.

[36:39] Look how chaotic this looks.

[36:41] You hit that?

[36:42] Alright.

[36:43] We're lifting a log.

[36:44] Now there's a lizard.

[36:45] Now there's a spider.

[36:47] Now we're...

[36:49] I'm so lucky to have this funger screen.

[36:51] You're using a lizard.

[36:59] You gotta punch the...

[37:01] Punch the...

[37:03] Or these are like, skill shots.

[37:06] Hey, who could see? Listen.

[37:08] Oh, look at this.

[37:11] I just want to look at the animations.

[37:15] Yeah, I should've just lost some of the...

[37:17] Two...

[37:19] One...

[37:23] One for the rabbit's hands, like me.

[37:28] I'm seeing now the giving out my email address was a terrible idea.

[37:30] Thank you, internet.

[37:32] Keep them coming, I guess.

[37:40] It's just so jumpy.

[37:42] Like, I don't feel...

[37:48] We're hungry now.

[37:54] Nice.

[37:57] Nice.

[37:59] That was a solid four-player game, yeah.

[38:02] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for tuning in.

[38:06] Keep you having any final words to share.

[38:18] Oh, man.

[38:27] I'm just like just watch all the...

[38:30] Like...

[38:35] He's throwing a car in the city.

[38:39] He's throwing the same car again.

[38:43] Now he's back in the jungle.

[38:45] Now he's got the car again.

[38:47] Now he's got the same car again.

[38:51] Now we're back at a jungle.

[38:53] Now he's punching it.

[38:55] Now there's a taradactyl.

[38:56] Now there's a taxi cab.

[39:00] Now he's back in the jungle.

[39:02] Now we're back in the city.

[39:08] Now we're back in the jungle.

[39:10] Now we hit a calm zone.

[39:16] Now we've got a hurricane.

[39:18] Now we're in a cave.

[39:20] Now we're back outside in a hurricane.

[39:26] Now...

[39:28] Now...

[39:30] This must unlock the trigger.

[39:34] Well, I hope it's not disjoint it when it's finally done.

[39:42] That's...

[39:46] But that's my point, gang.

[39:48] It's like...

[39:50] Am I still in line?

[39:52] My point is...

[39:54] Then why buy it now?

[39:55] Why buy it now?

[39:57] Why?

[39:59] Why buy it right now?

[40:01] The game has a lot to go code wise.

[40:13] But why would you want to play it

[40:15] in such a disjointed way right now?

[40:17] That's my point.

[40:19] Why would you want...

[40:21] Name me another product that you buy.

[40:23] Where you...

[40:25] Where it's not complete.

[40:31] Name me another...

[40:33] Entertainment property.

[40:35] Do you buy a movie?

[40:37] That's incomplete.

[40:41] You buy wine and it's not complete.

[40:45] Do they send you a bottle of wine, Josh?

[40:47] With half of it in the bottle?

[40:49] Yeah, I know it's a joke.

[40:59] Yeah, but how much you pay for a video game?

[41:01] How much you pay for a video game

[41:03] that might need some stuff added to it?

[41:05] Yeah, how much you pay for a video game?

[41:09] How much you pay for a video game that might need some stuff added to it?

[41:21] Right?

[41:22] And you know what the difference is with video games?

[41:27] Like you're not losing your shirt on the price.

[41:33] Anyway gang, look, let's hope we get Harry Potter next week.

[41:37] It'd be fun to talk about it.

[41:38] I'm going to go to bed.

[41:39] It's like 1.20 in the morning.

[41:40] I'm like, I literally just want to pop on and say hi.

[41:43] Thank you guys.

[41:44] Today's podcast, if you're not a subscriber to Canadian football podcast,

[41:48] it was a great one.

[41:49] It was 40-minute show.

[41:51] We ran around the horn.

[41:53] See how many subscribers we now got.

[42:00] We've dipped below 700 for a while.

[42:02] It's fine.

[42:03] The monetary amount hasn't dipped at all because as some people have left,

[42:09] some people have given more money.

[42:10] It's 685 subscribers.

[42:13] It's not bad.

[42:14] It's not bad.

[42:15] I'll take that.

[42:16] I'll take that.

[42:20] I'm going to start doing more.

[42:21] I got to get my another MacBook Air because I want to start doing some

[42:24] interviews.

[42:25] I want to start doing some other stuff.

[42:28] But I really enjoy where we're at.

[42:32] It balances well with the time I have during the week.

[42:35] Some of these guys, man, I'm like, God bless them.

[42:38] They must have nothing to do during the week that they can do all these interviews

[42:43] and all this content and all this stuff.

[42:45] It's like, wow, and their day job.

[42:47] I don't know.

[42:48] It's a lot.

[42:49] And they're not making any money for it.

[42:51] Just like, damn.

[42:54] Franchi will be the first one to tell you, like you can put in a lot of effort

[42:57] and at the end, it's just not worth it.

[43:00] All right, guys, let's all go to bed.

[43:02] And for those of you in Europe, like have a great day.

[43:06] And for those of you in Australia, like, how is yesterday and tomorrow

[43:10] at the same time?

[43:11] We'll talk later again.

[43:12] All right.

[43:13] I'll do a new show for Friday, usually.

[43:15] Hopefully we'll get a Harry Potter teaser on Friday later.
