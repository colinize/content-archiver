[00:00] Don't try to compare us to another bad little fat on the Mac and on bad.

[00:04] Give us something that you never had.

[00:05] I make your breath, hope we only shake your rope.

[00:07] Cause I'll be keeping up with that makes you wanna choke.

[00:10] How high real hot was I'm just a fly?

[00:12] A young, levelable, hunkable type of guy.

[00:14] Let's...

[00:21] Welcome to episode 256 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:28] I'm not Deadpool, but we are going to talk about the Deadpool stream we saw yesterday

[00:34] from Jack Danger over at Stern.

[00:37] Very, very exciting moment to see a pinball machine for the first time.

[00:41] Now the reason why I didn't get up my opinions about Deadpool right away yesterday,

[00:46] very simple.

[00:48] August 15th is also Brenda's birthday.

[00:51] So I had a whole day of birthday festivities for Brenda and one of them did not include

[00:57] sitting down and watching a pinball machine being played for two hours long.

[01:01] But we're gonna talk a lot about the Deadpool game.

[01:05] I'm gonna give you my impressions of Deadpool pinball after seeing the stream.

[01:11] But before we do that, we are going to go down some pinball news that is happening in the

[01:15] pinball world, right?

[01:17] It's been about a week.

[01:18] It's been about a week.

[01:18] I haven't had as many shows recently, but again, I've been away.

[01:23] I've been traveling.

[01:24] I've been doing other things.

[01:25] But I'm happy to be back in this saddle.

[01:26] So let's get right to it.

[01:28] So let's talk about Monster Bash remake and how I was dead wrong in my last week prediction

[01:35] that we were going to see Monster Bash remake last week.

[01:39] I simply reported on a rumor that someone gave me it was wrong.

[01:44] I think they're still waiting on the life and so approval.

[01:47] But what we do know is that another rumor around Monster Bash remake is false.

[01:52] And that rumor was there would be two games in one that there would be the original Monster

[01:58] Bash that everyone knows coated by lineman sheets.

[02:02] And then there'd be a whole new Monster Bash game that you could select from that was

[02:07] a new code, new animations.

[02:09] And that got people really excited.

[02:11] And you'd be able to choose between playing Monster Bash classic and Monster Bash 2.0.

[02:18] And the people who are making the game said, uh-uh, that's not happening.

[02:23] I don't know where that came from.

[02:24] I'm sorry to burst your bubbles.

[02:26] It came over on that rumor.

[02:28] So I don't know where Monster Bash remake is.

[02:30] I don't know why it's taking so long for the licensor to approve a game that came out

[02:35] 25 years ago that they're simply remaking and enhancing.

[02:40] They're probably holding off on announcing this game so they get a little bit of their

[02:47] own window.

[02:48] I could give them some marketing advice.

[02:50] I would actually just wait and probably release Monster Bash sometime in September.

[02:56] I don't think there's any benefit to doing it now.

[02:59] There's too many games out.

[03:00] It's too crowded.

[03:01] I wouldn't jump into the ring right now with a new game.

[03:05] All right.

[03:06] Let's talk about Jersey Jack Pimball.

[03:08] And I think a lot of people were confused as to the production timeline of Pirates of

[03:14] the Caribbean because when we saw the game on the line, that did not signify that production

[03:21] had begun.

[03:22] It was Eric was visiting Jersey Jack's factory.

[03:26] They're tooling up.

[03:27] They're getting the lines ready.

[03:29] For those of you who have been to Jersey Jack Pimball, it's a cool site to see.

[03:34] They have different stations.

[03:36] And they basically put a game and a play field at each station.

[03:42] And it shows what you're supposed to build at that station.

[03:45] So it's really cool to see the assembly line that happens at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[03:50] So production has not begun.

[03:52] Now what I'm hearing is we're two to three weeks away from Pirates of the Caribbean going

[03:57] out the door.

[03:58] Now when it comes out in September, that will make it almost one year since we first saw

[04:04] this game.

[04:05] Something about 10 and a half months since the game was first revealed, it will go out

[04:10] the door.

[04:11] And beat that dead horse many, many times.

[04:15] What I want to, you guys do, ask yourself this.

[04:17] Imagine after watching the Deadpool stream yesterday.

[04:21] Imagine after it, George Gomez goes up to the camera and says, okay, everyone, you can

[04:26] order now.

[04:28] This game is not going to ship for 10 months.

[04:32] Imagine the excitement and the hype being drained out of the room if that was the case.

[04:38] But that's exactly what's happened with Pirates of the Caribbean.

[04:42] And I watched the stream about a week ago.

[04:45] I think Eric and Keith and they did another stream.

[04:49] I feel like I've seen so many streams of Pirates of the Caribbean being played.

[04:54] And I always tune in and I'm waiting for something to happen that's supposed to just blow

[05:00] me away.

[05:01] And I think here's my issue.

[05:04] And every time I watch Eric talk about the game and Keith talk about the game, they

[05:09] always use like, they always talk about it like this.

[05:12] Like you got to hit this to qualify this to get this multiplier.

[05:16] And like every time they use the word multiplier, I just want to like punch myself in the face.

[05:21] Because I watched this game being played and it's all about like multiplier is in qualifying

[05:28] and understanding what 22 different character like benefits are.

[05:33] And it's just like they're talking to me like I'm some sort of pinball accountant.

[05:38] And I think they don't get what makes pinball great when it comes to the way you code a

[05:46] game is make the story simple.

[05:50] Tell me what I'm doing in the game.

[05:53] Pull me in on the narrative of the game.

[05:57] Not like how to qualify multipliers.

[06:00] Like what I love about pinball games that are great is that you know what you're doing.

[06:05] You know what the story is and you're trying to get through the modes and through the story.

[06:11] And here's what happens when you get through those modes and you get through the story, the

[06:17] points come.

[06:18] Like the points should be secondary.

[06:21] Not the first thing you're talking at people about.

[06:24] All right.

[06:25] When I get to the end of Super Mario Brothers, I usually have a high score.

[06:28] When I get to the end of you know putting all the villains in jail and Batman and getting

[06:34] to Pat Betoosie Multiball, I always have like around a billion points.

[06:39] So it's satisfying.

[06:40] I don't want to know how to like just multiplier this multiplier that you know if I were Jack

[06:46] and these guys came to the table and were like here's here's what you have to do to like

[06:50] you know with this character and this character me no no no no no how much better would it

[06:54] have been if the pirates of the Caribbean story were something as simple as this.

[06:59] Everyone who plays the game you play as Captain Jack Sparrow.

[07:03] All right.

[07:04] That's who you are.

[07:05] In the game your goal is to get the black pearl and then you have to go and battle all

[07:13] of the villains from the different movies and accomplish the you know the five different

[07:18] goals of the pirates of the Caribbean films right and how cool would it have been if to

[07:23] get the black pearl you have to remove it from the little bottle.

[07:27] How cool would it have been if every single pin had a topper with the black pearl inside

[07:33] the bottle not just the collectors editions and in the pinball game that's the first goal

[07:38] you have is to retrieve the black pearl and when you do the black pearl disappears from

[07:44] the bottle and appears in the game and that's when you do that when you retrieve the black

[07:49] pearl only then does the black pearl upper playfield start shaking back and forth because

[07:55] now you're on the black pearl and only then does the ramp up into the black pearl only

[08:03] then can you get up there because otherwise there's a diverter you see I just find the

[08:07] game like it's got all this beautiful stuff but they didn't think about it like that.

[08:11] They didn't create the story like it doesn't make any sense the black pearls just shaking

[08:16] right away like you're already getting rewarded something that you should unlock right

[08:23] and that's what makes pinball fun is when you get to the upper playfield or you get into

[08:28] the lower playfield bowling alley on the big Lebowski it's not just going right away but anyway

[08:34] anyway I digress I digress I think I think that we're learning more more as we go that if you want

[08:43] to design a pinball game to be all be about points and scoring and the narrative is not there

[08:48] I think you're doing it wrong. Wow Alexis turning on music in my apartment.

[08:52] Alexa pause okay look at that you're you're getting Canadian alive all right let's go on from

[08:58] Jersey Jack I just hope the game ships I want you guys to get it but I just I just don't want

[09:02] any more streams I no matter how many times they tell me that the spinning disc makes the ball move

[09:08] I never see it I never see the ball actually move when it goes over that spinning disc I feel like

[09:13] we've been reviewing this game for a year now I know you're sick of it so let's go on spooky

[09:18] uh it's celebrating game number one thousand and I just want to congratulate them I think that's

[09:24] a major major accomplishment we all know that when spooky came out there were a lot of other

[09:30] boutique companies that said they were going to make lots of games and they all failed for the most

[09:34] part but it's great that charlie and company have made one thousand pinball machines and put them

[09:40] into the world and everyone who bought a spooky machine got a spooky machine so that is something

[09:47] that is is is commendable and we should celebrate anything else we're still waiting for Alice Cooper's

[09:53] nightmare castle really to go out the door it's it's it's it's it's close we know that I think one is

[09:59] out in some rock and roll museum but it's coming soon we we saw it being played it's it's not

[10:05] vapor where it's happening real soon all right let's talk about home pin because this thread

[10:10] always just makes me chuckle so uh it appears that Mike has shipped the first thunderbirds not to the

[10:19] people that bought it five years ago you would think that the first people that would get thunderbirds

[10:24] were the Australians who invested in Mike's company initially nope this shipping container is

[10:31] going to Canada to Canadian orders which are clearly new orders on the game not the original

[10:38] orders because remember Mike wasn't even planning to send games to North America so that led some

[10:47] of the early adopters who bought this game to be very upset and questioning whether or not Mike

[10:53] is chasing after new money with this kind of tactic and we've seen this tactic before where the

[10:59] people who pay in full early on sort of they they the line gets cut by new orders and that usually

[11:06] is a sign that companies need new money now I don't know if that's the case but I'll say this when

[11:12] you read the thread what what what jumps out and should jump out is how absolutely enane it is

[11:20] that Mike is inside his own thread arguing with his own customers I mean how silly can you get

[11:29] that you are fighting the your your own buyers people who gave you money um and I think rodo

[11:36] Dave has finally has finally heard enough of of us calling him out for being silent on his gameplay

[11:44] review of of thunderbirds and he has now he has now given a gameplay review within a metaphor or

[11:53] within a within a within a comparison and he says that thunderbirds is the equivalent of the

[12:00] Jetsons and that's a very polite way of rodo Dave saying the game is a complete piece of s h i t

[12:14] when's the last time you heard anybody talk about the Jetsons or say the Jetsons is a good game

[12:19] and I don't think Mike was setting out to make a game for kids that is like a beginner's pinball

[12:26] machine I think he was setting out to make a game that pinball people who love pinball would think

[12:31] is great so uh enough about home pin I think this game is not really on many people's radars and

[12:37] I fully expect people who win in early uh to get kind of shafted and as the line gets cut all right

[12:44] let's get on to Deadpool this is why you're here canate is impressions of Deadpool and the stream

[12:52] that jack danger did yesterday so I want to tackle this from a few angles I'm going to go through the

[12:56] game what I saw my opinions about it all um first and foremost I want to thank jack danger for doing

[13:05] this stream I thought this was probably his best one ever and I'll explain why because they

[13:12] finally put the pinball machine in the right kind of environment it wasn't on the factory floor

[13:17] with all the lights and all the glare uh it was in a it looked like a sort of a different room

[13:22] like look like a kitchen it was there was no lights there was no I mean there's no windows there

[13:27] was no glare so I think that was great it was actually easy to see everyone on the stern team in

[13:32] the background as well so jack thank you and I think they got 6,000 people to watch the stream which

[13:39] is great considering um you know that's probably more games than they will make of Deadpool and if

[13:47] you're trying to sell 500 L.E.s and you've got 6,000 people watching I think it's terrific marketing

[13:54] I also want to thank all the people at stern for doing this you know they let us into the uh the

[14:00] factory to see the game being played and it was great it was great I think Tim Sexton did a really

[14:05] good job of explaining the game before plunging and I think you know I think there's the balancing

[14:10] act and I think Tim did get it right of giving you enough of what goes on in the game um but not

[14:17] spoiling it all because sometimes I think when you go through too much of the game and you show too

[14:22] much of what's going to happen inside the experience you're ruining it for the player because I think

[14:27] when people buy an expensive pinball machine part of the fun is exploring the game on your own and

[14:32] not knowing like what's going to happen not knowing what new music is going to pop up not knowing

[14:38] what secrets lie within the game and so I think they did a good job of not giving too much away

[14:44] and George Gomez said that the fourth wall uh is not in the game yet where Deadpool will speak and

[14:50] taunt to the player in sort of like uh HD like live action sort of way live action and just you know

[14:56] not not animated the way the LCD is right now so I also the first thing that jumped out at me was

[15:02] this when when Tim was introducing all the people that worked on the game I couldn't help but be like

[15:09] wow like there's a lot there are a lot of people involved in making this pinball machine I mean

[15:17] and everything from you know the coder the designer the artist people doing animations it is in

[15:24] army of individuals that are working on a game and and getting this game to market and and it's

[15:32] impressive like you can't you can't look at all those people who are pouring uh tons of hours

[15:39] and passion into a pinball project and not be somewhat thankful that stern pinball is around

[15:45] because nobody else has the level of expertise and the amount of people working on pinball machines

[15:54] so I I was sort of like like a little blown away by by the sheer number of people that that bring

[16:00] these products to life so that that was really cool to see um all right let's jump into

[16:07] the game itself and so they talked a lot about the animations and the LCD and and how you know

[16:15] things were rendered in 3d and then put into this sort of 16 bit uh you know sort of like 90s

[16:21] fighting game style and and the game sort of revolves around Deadpool being inside his den and the

[16:28] different characters are in the den with him there's different pinball machines in arcade games

[16:32] and he's there like playing the Deadpool Ellie pinball machine and I have to say like I really do

[16:39] love that they took this approach because what I what I love about it is stern clearly like they

[16:46] had a vision for how they wanted to tie it all together how they wanted to bring the Deadpool comic

[16:52] book to life within a pinball game and and I think it fits perfectly I do I think the classic

[16:59] retro throwback like 90s fighting style is is a really fun way to approach a comic book character

[17:06] which we know the missions of almost all comic book heroes is that they're trying to battle the

[17:12] villains and so Deadpool you know battling juggernaut you know battling the t-rex like that's the

[17:18] goal of this game and I I love the way that they made it that sort of style like it's almost like

[17:24] pinball machine meets street fighter combined together in this sort of format so and I think it looked

[17:31] really really good to the the graphics on the LCD um you know it's interesting that Alice Cooper

[17:38] Nightmare Castle and and Deadpool both have sort of like a comic book style LCD now I think the

[17:45] the look of Alice Cooper it looks you know it looks like cleaner but again but stern wasn't going

[17:52] for that stern wasn't trying to make it look like a you know like a high definition comic book style

[17:58] of visual they were trying to make it look like a 16-bit graphics I think they they achieve that

[18:04] um so I'm going down my list I wanted they talked they showed the ninja pop bumpers those were

[18:09] cool when you hit the pop bumpers the ninjas pop down uh the katana rama mode when you have

[18:14] it it's kind of cool you get the slice different things uh I love the versus mode when you're fighting

[18:20] uh a villain you can team up with with different characters to battle them remind it reminds me of a lot

[18:27] of like the x-men arcade game where you can tag team against people um let's get to gameplay all

[18:34] all right because we've seen the game before I have to say George Gomez is is like a really really

[18:43] good pinball designer and we know this this is not me making this stuff up and I think the game

[18:47] is great flow I was surprised to see how much flow and how fast this game was I did not get the

[18:56] one word that normally you get with a George Gomez game and that is clonkiness now not normally

[19:03] but there are you know what I'm talking about like Lord the Rings has clunky shots like Batman has

[19:07] clunky shots this game feels much smoother than some of you know those other games and I was I was

[19:15] excited to see the ball whip around a lot without slowing down so I think the game is going to be

[19:21] fast and have a lot of flow for you guys out there who like speed I think this game is going to

[19:27] provide a lot of that um the left ramp is silky smooth every time that thing was hit the ball would

[19:32] just whip around and come right back to the left flipper the other ramp that a lot of people were

[19:38] nervous about you know the right orbit shot into the ramp that's on the left that feeds the katana

[19:43] sword that goes into the sword lock it worked every time I saw it and it wasn't clunky it didn't

[19:51] it slows down a little bit when it goes up the ramp and comes around back to the right uh but it

[19:57] it never failed to get up that ramp and I think a lot of people were concerned that that would be

[20:01] the case um but did you really expect George Gomez to design a white wood of this game and say

[20:09] yep we're done with the geometry if if that shot was going to be problematic especially since it's

[20:14] a really important shot uh in the game so I think from a gameplay standpoint the the game looks great

[20:21] um you know what Stern knows how to do so after I watched about like 30 minutes of them playing

[20:26] the game and I'm not going to go into you guys watch this stream I'm not going to just like keep

[20:30] talking about the stream uh and it like like every minute here's what I saw um Stern knows how to

[20:37] make a pinball machine immediately satisfying right so if you walk up to this machine I think within

[20:44] 30 seconds something's going to happen that excites you and I think that is what makes I think

[20:51] Stern pinball machines a little bit different than other people's attempts is like it's not like it's

[20:56] it's not too complex this game now don't get me wrong Stern has made games in the past before

[21:02] where it's just way too confusing to get stuff going you know like it's way it was so stupid

[21:08] how hard they made it to get balls in the hyperdrive in Star Wars like I still think that is the

[21:15] biggest failed mech ever because of how infrequent it happens and in Deadpool I feel like right away

[21:24] you know you're gonna hit the targets by the the little Deadpool you it's easy to figure out how to

[21:30] get multi balls going you know in fact multi ball happens pretty quickly in the game because people

[21:35] like multi ball you know some of the tournament players don't like it when it comes too frequently

[21:40] but but just in general I think people are gonna walk up to this machine and immediately have a good

[21:46] time with it and I think they're gonna they're gonna be excited by the LCD and and and their ability

[21:51] to feel like they're doing something in the game pretty quickly so I just want to say that I think

[21:57] Stern knows how to do that really well let me talk about the display I think the I know I've said

[22:02] the animations are great I really I just I really like the way it looked I was a little weirded out

[22:09] by one thing and and here's here's you take this for what it's worth whenever Deadpool's like just

[22:15] on screen and like ninjas are dropping down he's kind of just like standing there like it's kind

[22:21] of weird he's like just bopping up and down but he's not like blocking or punching or defending

[22:26] himself as they're attacking him it's like they're just they're waiting you know it kind of reminds me

[22:31] of like a video game when you put the joystick down and like nothing's happening on the screen

[22:36] and the characters just like standing there idle and and it's it like I understand why that would

[22:41] happen in a video game but it's kind of weird in a pinball machine because you're not really physically

[22:46] in control of the characters that are on the screen so I kind of felt like that just looked a

[22:55] little awkward and I don't know if more animations are going to be put in but it's you know it's just

[23:00] sort of strange so you know like in the scene when he's running away from the T-Rex it's kind of

[23:05] running kind of weirdly and like I don't know I when I was watching that it's cool to look at

[23:10] but I didn't get the sense of like you know like in urgency or like there's like is he actually

[23:16] in danger like is it five shots to beat the T-Rex there's a bunch of green lights flashing

[23:22] so just you know seeing the like here's the other thing seeing how the code is going to come

[23:29] through with the animations is something I'm curious about because Teno who's a new coder

[23:36] you know that's really the secret sauce of any coding is is is what's happening right not just

[23:42] what you're seeing but the way it sort of develops or the way a mode progresses and that is like

[23:50] what separates like genius coders like they know how to pull you through a mode in a way that

[23:56] creates excitement in a way that makes it energetic in a way that emotionally stirs you you know

[24:02] it's like it's like in Lord the Rings like to roar when the multi ball starts like that stuff

[24:08] is all the coder is putting that in and we all know that no one does that better than Lyman

[24:13] Sheets so I'm just like interested to see like if these you know if the way the game is coded

[24:19] in the modes if if it has that you know I think it's still too early to tell I hope you're

[24:25] following because I know that might sound a little weird so that gets me to like the code it seems

[24:29] very far along you know I don't think we're getting a game that is going to be like gardens of the

[24:35] galaxy or like Batman was or you know it's not going to be Spartan code it seems like a lot is in

[24:42] the game so I think when it ships probably within a week I'm not sure if the fourth wall stuff will

[24:47] be in yet but usually Stern has a code update between the Jack Danger stream and when games go out so

[24:54] I expect that to be in there um something that you know I was reading on pins I someone said this

[25:00] is what's the narrative of the game you know you heard me harp about narrative with with pirates

[25:04] the Caribbean uh but I you kind of don't get the sense of like I Deadpool should start out telling you

[25:12] hey man like here's what we got to do you you kind of are just there in his den and he's he's at a

[25:18] pinball machine like it doesn't really tell you uh what the storyline is so I'm curious to see if

[25:25] that's going to come through more in the code again early on I don't know I know they worked with

[25:30] the one of the Deadpool comic writers who wrote this story for the pinball machine um so I don't

[25:37] think we got that from the stream but I would like to see more of what's the overall objective of

[25:43] this game and how is the game going to tell us um what the with the story and the point of playing

[25:49] the game is because I think that's something too that uh is is is is important is that you know why

[25:55] you're playing the game from a narrative standpoint not just how to score points all right all right

[26:00] what else have I got here the music the music seemed fine to me it was like a combination of like

[26:06] rock and pop um and sort of like hip hop inspired beats uh very Deadpool like very comic like

[26:13] uh the the callouts in the game were funny uh will they get repetitive I think a lot of people

[26:19] are probably wondering that you know when you go for a sense of humor uh and you hear a joke

[26:24] it's always funny the first time but every time you hear it is it gonna still remain funny um

[26:30] probably not probably not but I do think that this game feels like the Deadpool comic coming to life

[26:38] and and and if you like the Deadpool comic and it's a theme for you I don't see how you're not going

[26:43] to really want to play this pin and possibly own this pin I think it definitely accomplishes that

[26:48] if you're one of the guys out there who loves the Deadpool movies and got used to more of the

[26:54] R-rated humor and Ryan Reynolds's voice and and the gore from that film yes I think that this might

[27:03] not excite you it does feel more like a family friendly uh Saturday morning cartoon version of

[27:12] Deadpool and I and I heard people say that a lot and I definitely agree with that um knowing that

[27:18] the majority of people buying this pinball machine will be men in their 40s 50s and 60s um I would

[27:25] have liked to have seen in R-rated mode worked in but I'll tell you why I'm not surprised

[27:31] there's no way that Disney and Marvel would have let's turn do that and it's that simple which

[27:37] is kind of weird because they let them make R-rated movies so maybe they would have honestly maybe

[27:41] they would have um but I would imagine that a toy they look at pinball maybe as a toy and they

[27:47] don't want a toy to to be R-rated all right what else did I have um going on here um let's see

[27:55] I think we you know I think that sort of captures it my oh my I'm gonna give you my overall

[27:59] feelings on the game in a second first I want to give some free marketing advice to

[28:04] Zach Sharp over at Stern pinball Zach I know you're listening I know you're listening

[28:11] what they should have done is this and it's not too late Zach you should do this for anyone that

[28:18] buys an Ellie version of Deadpool pinball for nine thousand dollars one of the added features

[28:25] they should include in everyone's purchase they should include the Deadpool costume that

[28:32] Jack Danger had on it would have been such a fun item to include and they should have

[28:38] mailed that to all Ellie buyers first before they get their pinball machine so they can have it on

[28:45] when the game arrives how cool would that marketing move have been that costume probably cost like

[28:51] 25 bucks at most maybe maybe 30 you're buying a nine thousand dollar toy and the reason why

[28:57] they should have done that is in the game itself on the LCD it's Deadpool dressed in his Deadpool

[29:04] costume playing the Ellie version of the game so how perfect of a marketing move would that have

[29:11] been to give people the costume now Zach this is just Chris the marketing guy who um who's giving

[29:19] you free advice you know what my team executed this week I was just by the way so you understand why

[29:24] I love marketing and I work with the best marketers on the planet um from my team my colleague came

[29:32] this this marketing thing that you probably have seen in the world um we are putting Bud Light

[29:38] refrigerators in Cleveland bars that do not unlock Bud Light until the Cleveland Browns win their

[29:47] first game and the locks are Wi-Fi controlled so they won't unlock until the win occurs that came

[29:55] from canada's culture tap team and Bud Light team at Weber Chanwick uh how awesome is that I get

[30:03] to I get to do a job like that's why I love what I do and that's why I'm saying when I give pinball

[30:06] marketers some advice I just love it that they never take me up on my free marketing the only

[30:12] company that ever hit me up for marketing help with team pinball on the mafia game can you imagine

[30:19] how like how much of a went went moment that was for me that this is the only company that wants

[30:25] my help uh there's nothing I could do for them there is absolutely nothing I could do to save

[30:29] that title all right let me go on here so um here's my overall feelings on the game I think the

[30:36] game looks amazing I think zombie Yeti crushed it I think the art animators crushed it I think

[30:42] the game is one of the most fun looking pinball machines from a distance that you could you we've

[30:48] ever seen I I think it's Stern's best art package ever uh I think the game is a visual knockout

[30:55] and we'll do absolutely amazing on location I do I think it's an operator's dream it's colorful

[31:01] you anyone it's it's not intimidating to step up to the game um the shots are fast and fun

[31:09] I I think it shoots amazing I think Gomez got the geometry perfect uh I think people who own

[31:14] this game are gonna have fun flipping it um the LCD animations are awesome as well I think when

[31:20] you stand away from the machine uh you know I think it's the it's it's a comic book meets 90s

[31:25] fighting game meets pinball like all good things blended together in a way that works so I think

[31:32] that is there that being said I wouldn't I personally am not gonna buy a Deadpool and the only reason

[31:42] not the only reason but the first in form is because I'm not the biggest Deadpool comic book fan

[31:47] so that the game is not really a theme that I'm hyper hyper in love with but here there's one

[31:52] thing missing for me there is one thing missing maybe two things but really one thing and this one

[31:58] thing to me is sort of everything to me because it's it's what separates pinball from our kids

[32:07] it's what separates pinballs from other forms of entertainment and it's also the main reason I do

[32:13] love pinball and it's the main reason I know you love pinball and it's the main reason uh we

[32:19] still look at games from the ballet Williams error as being the greatest pinball machines of all time

[32:24] and for me the one thing that's missing from this game is the wow all right the W O W Wow like

[32:33] what is going on on the playfield that makes me say wow did you see that and to me that is the

[32:45] the ultimate sort of not in this game thing um it's not in iron made in either like and went

[32:54] but I mean by that is this something mechanical or something physical that's inside the pinball

[33:02] machine that makes me say wow did you see what just happened and I think to me that is the one

[33:13] final piece of the puzzle that stern pinball needs to work on next they have done everything else

[33:21] we've asked them to do right they have upgraded the display they have made the artwork better than

[33:28] any pinball artwork in the world they have given us the best themes on the planet they have some

[33:34] of the greatest designers and the best code ever put into a pinball machine they have everything going

[33:41] they've got a marketing team that's doing a great job they have everything that you could ever

[33:47] ask for in a pinball machine but they don't have the wow like wow did you see that ball get

[33:57] chopped in half like imagine this imagine like a multi ball in which there's actually a physical

[34:03] like Deadpool figure that has like a physical katana and it like comes down like over the ball

[34:09] gets trapped on a magnet and how cool would this been all right the ball gets trapped on a magnet

[34:15] and it's floating there all all like in front of the genie in tails of the Arabian nights and behind

[34:22] that ball is a Deadpool figure kind of like the size of magneto in X-Men pinball and the katana

[34:27] raises back physically and it comes down and it looks like it's slicing through the ball and as

[34:33] that's happening the ball drops underneath the magnet like in toad and like it's cutting the ball

[34:38] in half and all of a sudden two balls pop out of the side like he split the ball into two how like

[34:45] a wow moment like that because when i look at deadpool it's kind of like um it's like

[34:52] imagine lord the rings imagine that game and then remove ballrog and remove the ring from that

[35:01] game and do you still have the magic that is the lord of the rings pinball those two things those

[35:09] two physical things that are in the game um you know there's nothing like that in deadpool

[35:15] and so you know i i i i'm wondering why why and it's pretty i think the answer right now is pretty simple

[35:25] i think the reason why there isn't those wow mechanisms put into these games is that it's a hell

[35:33] of a lot cheaper to make the wow happen on the screen to put money into the animations and into

[35:42] the code because that stuff doesn't break that stuff doesn't need to be replaced that stuff can have

[35:50] physical problems happen and that is why we're seeing more emphasis go to zombie yedi and artwork

[35:57] and more emphasis going to the LCD stuff and it just seems like the physical things on the play field

[36:07] are where the costs are being cut or where the bomb is not happening and and that to me again

[36:16] it's the final piece of the puzzle we know they can do it right but it's just weird to me that

[36:24] 10 years ago like lord of the rings came out 15 years ago 14 years ago all right 14 years ago

[36:32] stern pinball was putting mechanisms into the machines that are far better than any mechanisms

[36:38] going into machines today you know the crane toy on batman how many years old over 10 years old

[36:45] so you know it's like in a lot of ways i think they looked at pinball and said you know for this

[36:52] company to make maximum profit you know we don't want to be overly ambitious with the mechanisms

[36:59] and that's the word i kept thinking about too is where is the ambition on the play field right if

[37:06] you were to say if you were to look at this game and say you know they really went innovative and

[37:13] overly ambitious or or strove to make that thing happen and it's just it's just you're not going

[37:19] to find it as a total package yes great game fun game and i just think stern has one major thing

[37:30] left to do to to in my mind make pinball machines that will go down as classics for years to come

[37:39] because i want them to and i know you want them to and i know they can and that's the thing too

[37:45] is i know they can do it you know it's it's interesting because on one on one side of the fence

[37:50] we've got jersey jack that i think gets overly ambitious and put so much into the game that they

[37:57] like make it crowded at times and like like they have too many things trying to wow you where it kind

[38:04] of all cancels each other out and then you have stern where it's like i don't think they have

[38:10] enough to wow you on you know on the physical play field and it's and the answer is like

[38:17] somewhere in the middle it's like if stern and jersey jack could get together we'd have a company

[38:22] called bali Williams and then we'd have the greatest pinball and a real new golden era of pinball

[38:29] because i still think we're not there i don't think these games are are the same i i don't i think

[38:36] we're still not there i i think we could be i think every manufacturer has something to learn

[38:43] from each other but to me it's like i want to take elements of what each are doing and put

[38:50] them together and then we'd get back to the magic that was bali Williams and and that's that's

[38:57] just sort of how i feel lately and when i feel that way it kind of makes it hard to buy these games

[39:03] it sort of makes me want to just go find them on location and play them

[39:08] because i just don't feel the desire to own one over the other you know you know i don't need

[39:15] to pass on this one going on this one i think every game is like just kind of almost there but not

[39:21] quite there for the amount of money these games are and the fact that people designing these games

[39:27] know that predominantly they're ending up in people's homes i do think every game needs to be

[39:33] almost like an instant classic like a game you just don't want to get rid of that justifies

[39:39] owning it and and has replay value and has the wow factor because when people come over you want to

[39:46] be able to show them something that happens that is really cool in a pinball machine and it's not

[39:52] just lights and art okay so that's my assessment of of of the final hurdle and i hope i hope it's

[39:59] fair i hope it's fair to say that you know i want to see something you know like the milk can shot

[40:05] in houdini in a dead pool pinball machine and i think the idea i gave of slicing the ball into with

[40:11] the katana i think that would have been incredible and i don't think it's because stern doesn't have

[40:18] creative minds that come up with stuff like this i do i think they're overruled by the bean

[40:25] counters who want to make the bomb low and i also think stern understands that we don't need to do

[40:33] it to sell the games because they they they they're the only ones really making games i mean it's

[40:39] comical what everyone else is doing when it comes to revealing and shipping pinball machines

[40:43] so they're allowed to not do it and still get games sold because who else are you going to go buy

[40:51] who else you want to wait a year you want to wait two years you want to never get your game

[40:55] you want to give your money to andrew highway you want to give your money to barry and yop

[40:59] you know you want to give your money to john pop it out you know it's like

[41:02] or kevin coolic you know you want to give your money to mike now you want you want to get a pinball

[41:07] game and they're making the only pinball games in town that ship frequently so i hope you think

[41:12] that was a fair assessment i would love to hear from you guys and what you think about that

[41:15] assessment of deadpool i would love to read your comments on the air please hit me up tell me

[41:21] what you thought of deadpool uh at canada pinball at gmail dot com if you'd like to be a guest of

[41:26] this show i'm going to throw this out there again and i've got some of you who want to come on

[41:30] i would love to talk to new personalities in the pinball world please hit me up at canada pinball

[41:35] at gmail dot com i was supposed to have zombie eddie come on the show this week uh even those

[41:40] zack sharp heard that he was going to come on and said no no no you can't do canada pinball podcast

[41:46] he assaulted a member of our team i am sorry tim i'm sorry to everyone for that incident it's over

[41:52] with um i i hope people will forgive me because i truly am sorry that happens um so i hope i can

[41:59] still interview people at stern i think the the interviews would be good um the reason zombie eddie

[42:03] will now not be coming on the show is that zombie eddie did another interview with this week in pinball

[42:10] he also emailed out to you head to head pinball and look there's so many pinball podcast and i think

[42:17] that's a good thing but when it comes to interviews this isn't like tom kru's doing a movie junket

[42:24] for mission impossible where like he'll go on the today's show he'll go on good morning america

[42:29] when people do two hour interviews with people they've said everything that needs to be said i don't

[42:35] really want to have a guest that was just a guest on another show uh it's just it's just not how

[42:42] you do it it's also i i've got to be a little honest here it's also not cool to say you're going

[42:47] to do someone's show and then they wake up the next day and you're on a competitor's show like

[42:53] either have some sort of you know loyalty to the offer and by that i just mean do one person show

[43:02] and then maybe the next time you do another person show but to go on like three or four shows

[43:07] uh i i don't know like that's that to me as like i consider this to be somewhat of pinball journalism

[43:14] i would like to have a little bit of an exclusive you know time to chat with someone uh just just

[43:20] just again because we're all you know trying to get listeners and get traffic and that just helps but

[43:24] no biggie there's no no hard feelings is on the yeti um i'm glad you did the interview maybe we'll talk

[43:31] in the in the future about just just pinball in general and what it's been like in your pinball

[43:36] tenure um the ups and downs of it so i would love to have that conversation and not just talk about

[43:41] Deadpool artwork all right everybody i hope you enjoy the rest of your week uh we will probably see

[43:49] Deadpool in a few weeks in people's homes that's a great thing i hope this was a fair assessment

[43:54] of the game uh and everybody thank you for tuning in to canada's pinball podcast this has been

[44:00] episode two fifty something we'll see don't know two fifty six wow we're still ahead of Nate
