[00:00] Why? Our expectation so high. Is it the bar I set? My arms are stretched but I can't reach.

[00:07] A fart cry from it or it's in my grass butters. Soon as I grab squeeze, I lose my grip like the

[00:13] flying trap peas into the dark-eyed plummeties.

[00:22] Welcome to episode 179 of Canadian Spinball Podcast. This is going to be a great one. We

[00:28] interview Christopher Fransche artist extraordinaire from Batman 66 and now Guardians of the Galaxy.

[00:36] I love talking to Chris because he's probably one of the most passionate, honest,

[00:41] and cool human beings I talked to you on a weekly basis about pinball and in life and about

[00:46] bulldogs and all sorts of cool stuff. So we're going to air that in a little bit. I think you're

[00:50] going to love it. Before that, a couple news items and then we'll get right to it. Now today's

[00:55] an interesting day because the first thing I want to talk about is the fact that we saw the

[01:01] Jack Danger Dead Flip stream of Guardians of the Galaxy pinball. And this was an interesting thing

[01:08] that they did it today because we got a whole bunch of gameplay footage from the IAPA show in Florida

[01:14] and I was a little bit concerned that when Jack got on the machine, it wouldn't be anything new.

[01:19] And I thought there'd be sort of newer code they would give Jack to play so that we'd get like

[01:25] more of a sense of how the Guardians world would come to life during this Dead Flip stream.

[01:31] And I have to say, like many of you out there who really watch all these Dead Flip streams,

[01:39] I think this out of all of them left me so underwhelmed and simply because it's quite clear

[01:48] that the code is not far enough along to allow media to play the game because there were absolutely

[01:58] no callouts in the game whatsoever. And you could say like yes, they were removed from the code

[02:04] and that's what they were telling us. They were they're going to be in there but they weren't in

[02:08] today. And it's just again, I just say like why do why do you market something in such a weird way

[02:16] because right now, Guardians of the Galaxy is shipping. Distributors are asking people

[02:22] for their money now to lock in Ellie orders and they get people to buy the pro after watching

[02:28] that game today. I don't know how you walk away without saying the code's just nowhere near,

[02:35] nowhere near the point where the game should ship to customers. And now people are looking to the

[02:41] customers who are the early adopters and asking them, hey, can you upload footage to see what kind

[02:47] of callouts are in there? It just doesn't make any sense. There's absolutely no reason why a

[02:51] licensor would want Stern to do the Dead Flip stream without callouts if callouts were available.

[02:58] I mean, I don't know. Maybe they're licensing negotiations with some of the voice actors or whatever,

[03:03] whatever it could be. Then you know what? Then don't do the Dead Flip thing. I couldn't help but turn

[03:09] it off after 10 minutes. And the reason why I came back on like it towards the end, it was like

[03:14] watching Guardians of the Galaxy a silent movie with these characters just like staring at each

[03:20] other, but no one wanted to say anything. It's like somebody say something. Tell me what to do.

[03:25] Give me a single callout. Watching a pinball machine with no callouts is horrendous.

[03:32] Horrendous. And I know Jack didn't want that. It probably wasn't the code he was expecting.

[03:38] But I think Stern is really at a point now where they need to stop with this whole

[03:45] we're going to send consumers something that's not quite ready yet. I mean, are we really going

[03:51] to absorb the role as a beta tester for Stern where code's not done. We haven't seen the game

[03:59] playing properly. We don't really know what's in it. But yet they're selling it to me right now.

[04:05] And I don't have enough information to make a wise decision. So I think at the end of the day,

[04:10] everyone, you need to go find the Guardians and play it before you spend your money on it.

[04:15] Because you can't tell from these videos like what's really there. Speaking of what's really there,

[04:20] but just walked into the rooms. I had to get them out. That's what that pitter-pattering was. All right,

[04:25] what else is going on in the pinball world? So how about this for those of you out there who are

[04:29] pinball designers, a company is looking for a pinball designer and that company is deep-root pinball.

[04:36] And they're willing to spend $75 to $90,000 a year for your pinball design skills. The only problem is,

[04:46] you'd probably be teaming up with Mr. John Papadu Jr., who is their lead game designer over there

[04:52] right now. And what was interesting is a few people sent me this and they said, oh man,

[04:56] this means J-Pop is out and they're looking for a new designer. And I think the news that they

[05:01] would have booted J-Pop would have been good news. But then right after posting that they're looking

[05:08] for this job, they confirmed that their relationship with John has not changed and John is still

[05:14] the lead game designer over at Deeproot Pinball. I don't know what to say. I mean, this is one of those

[05:20] things where whatever, right? We may see something from these guys. It'll probably take years and by

[05:27] the time anything materializes, nobody's going to care. Nobody's willing to give John another shot

[05:33] in pinball. I don't know why these guys are doing it. What else is going on? So the big Lebowski

[05:39] and Dutch pinball had a little bit of an update. Their updates are always the same. It goes something

[05:45] like this. We're not there yet. When we get there, we'll tell you, but we're not there yet. It's

[05:53] always the same thing. I mean, by the time the big Lebowski comes out, we'll be playing virtual

[05:59] reality pinball. It'll be no longer fresh, no longer new, no longer innovative. And who cares?

[06:09] Like four years later by the time this game comes out after they've revealed it. And I think

[06:15] people are just over it. I hope they get it out. I hope people who paid for the game get their

[06:20] machine because that's the part that sucks is that a lot of people spent money with these guys

[06:24] and they have nothing to show for it. Nothing to show for it. What else is going on in pinball? So

[06:32] total nuclear annihilation is the greatest pinball machine of all time. According to Pinsock,

[06:39] that is if you look at the top 100 games, and I'm going to go right now and look in real time

[06:44] at the top 100. And we'll see where it's at right now. Total nuclear annihilation with a 9.276

[06:53] rating is number one. It is better than attack for Mars, Medieval madness, monster bash, Twilight

[06:59] Zone, Lord of the Rings, dialed in, Adams family. Okay. What's so silly about this is with 15 ratings,

[07:07] it can be number one. I mean, it's just it's just comical. I mean, what all happened now with

[07:13] is what always what happens is people who are upset by this will now go in and rank this game

[07:18] is zero just to bring it back down to reality. Like I'm glad Scott's game is out. I think people

[07:24] are enjoying it. I think this is just another testament of the goodwill Scott has with the community.

[07:30] I also think someone needs to figure out a new way to rank pinball machines. There needs to be like

[07:36] a rotten tomatoes aggregator of pinball machines because if I was in person and I was going to go by

[07:44] a pinball machine, it's really hard to figure out amongst the newer titles. Where do these games

[07:50] fall within the larger scheme of things? I almost feel like it's hard, right? Because nothing is

[08:00] weighed properly. Do we have a ranking for games with LCDs? Do we just rank all pinball together?

[08:07] Is there an ability to separate styles of games? What's the best game with flow? Is there a way

[08:14] to rank it like that? What's the best game if toys or what I'm looking for? You know what I'm saying?

[08:19] It's all very arbitrary and these rankings and these reviews, they don't really mean anything.

[08:26] You could go down this list and I can tell you that I find half of these games in the top 10 to be

[08:32] kind of mediocre to me. Some people swear by them. Like ACDC for example, number 10. Some people love

[08:38] that game. Some people hate that game. Lord, the rings. I still think it's turned best game ever.

[08:43] Some people can't stand that game because of the long ball times. What else is going on in the pinball

[08:50] world? So alien pinball, we've talked about highway pinball. The refund requests have not all been

[08:56] settled, but I want to say this. It's what? It's November 20th. Can we all now just stop?

[09:05] Like stop beating these guys up like every day on pinside. I go into the thread and it's just like

[09:14] everybody knows everything by now. There are no new people who are stumbling across highway pinball

[09:21] at this point. If people have money in on the game and they want to stick it out, they'll stick

[09:28] it out. If people have asked for refunds, they deserve a refund. The game definitely has some

[09:34] issues. It has some technical difficulties and but there's just a lot of people. I'm starting to

[09:39] notice. There's just a lot of people that are going a little bit overboard with describing some

[09:45] of the issues with the games. Someone was saying how if a switch goes out, you have to replace the

[09:50] whole board and that's not actually accurate or true. I think people are, a lot of people are

[09:58] rooting against this company. I understand why they have fans and they have enemies. Whenever

[10:05] you do this and you make people wait a really long time and Andrew highway's lies, they don't just

[10:11] go away. You don't just get a pass because you sidestep that investors came in. There's a lot of

[10:18] ill will still floating around this company. Because of that, the environment will always be toxic

[10:26] until everyone is made whole. Until everyone who paid for their game gets what they paid for

[10:32] and everyone who's asked for a refund gets that refund. Right now, I think everyone needs to chill

[10:39] out. It's Thanksgiving this week. Let this company just do its thing for the next few months and

[10:45] it's all on you. If you can't get a refund, those are the people that they need to get those people

[10:51] their money and they need to let them get on with their lives and go buy other machines.

[10:56] Okay. All right. Without further ado, I want to air this interview with Christopher Franchi.

[11:02] I love talking to Chris. He's very honest. He tells it like it is. I think he's a tremendous

[11:08] asset to stern Pimball. I think Guardians is a wonderful looking machine. I think there's

[11:15] elements of that game that are yet to be determined and I think a lot of people are whizing up

[11:21] and want to play these machines and make sure they enjoy them. But one thing is for certain.

[11:26] The majority of time you spend looking at a Pimball machine, you will be looking at the artwork

[11:33] and you will be looking at the layout and you will be looking at Pimball as a work of art and a

[11:38] world in their glass. And for the longest time, we had terrible, terrible, terrible art packages

[11:44] coming from stern Pimball and they know it and they hired three great artists, Zambi Yeti,

[11:51] Dirty Donny and Christopher Franchi who are just killing it. They keep making these machines look

[11:58] better and better and better. And it's hard to deny that when you look at a game like Guardians,

[12:03] you don't get a little bit excited, right? It looks great. And he had four months to do this game

[12:07] versus the Batman 66 job that he just had a few weeks to do. So I hope you enjoyed this interview.

[12:14] I think that having him in Pimball is a good thing and you'll hear. He's going to talk about

[12:21] what's coming in the future and I think that's going to really excite you. So make sure you

[12:24] listen to the end without further delay, Mr. Christopher Franchi. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

[12:32] back to Canadian Pimball podcast. A very, very special guest, Mr. Christopher Franchi, whose artwork

[12:40] is now on game number two. He did Batman 66 and he just completed Guardians of the Galaxy Pimball.

[12:48] Chris, welcome back to the show. Thank you, sir. How are you? I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I'm

[12:53] glad to have you back on. You and I are sort of like friends outside of just the podcast and we

[12:59] talk about Pimball all the time. I believe the proper term is Facebook friends, right? Yeah. Yeah,

[13:05] I don't know if you'd recognize each other walking down the street, but we have very good banter

[13:09] back and forth. And I love I love that you're a geek. I mean, is that fair to say that you're like,

[13:14] I saw your Batman collection and like my god. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Always have been

[13:22] always will be. That's the way I prefer to be. So, right. Well, you know what I always say, like

[13:27] people who are passionate about stuff, they make the world go round and speaking about passion,

[13:33] I know that when you are doing in our project, you want to put your heart and soul into it. And

[13:37] on the last time we talked, we talked all about sort of the 11th hour request to make Batman

[13:45] as special as you could. And I think you pulled off a miracle getting that game to look as phenomenal

[13:50] as it does. How much more time did you have to do Guardians of the Galaxy? I had the luxury of about

[13:57] four months, four or five months from the point where we first started talking about it. And of

[14:04] course, there was a lot of sort of stall time in there because like, you know, I might have had

[14:10] the cabinets in the back glass and done. And then, you know, I think I waited a few weeks before I

[14:16] was able to start working on the play field, you know, but yeah, as far as time goes, you know,

[14:24] there was definitely not, you know, I look back at Batman and I call it Hell Week because

[14:29] it really wasn't much more than a week of time that I had to get that together. I

[14:34] right. It was had the wonderful luxury of having a lot of time to think this one out.

[14:41] Are you happy with the way everything turned out with Batman in the end? I mean,

[14:45] it seems like the game is coming along now with the code. I know it's been a long year, right?

[14:50] You've probably been listening to people complaining that the code isn't where they wanted it to be,

[14:55] but it's starting to get there. What was it like sort of watching people

[15:00] get your product and be sort of unsatisfied with it? It sucked. I don't say be honest because

[15:08] it was my first pinball game. It's, you know, it was my dream thing. You know, obviously,

[15:17] you know, like we talked about my Batman collection. And I didn't have a lot of time to work on it,

[15:24] but from the time that I had and what I did, I thought I couldn't have asked much more of myself.

[15:33] So I thought it was good. And as a Batman fan and as a Batman collector, I would have been

[15:38] thrilled to have that game in my collection. And I do. And then to see, you know, like, it just turned

[15:46] into like the red-headed stepchild of pinball. And it wasn't because of the artwork. I didn't hear

[15:52] any complaints really about the artwork. It was like the, you know, the video. Please send us a

[15:57] video begging us for permission to buy one of our games. You know, the code will have an update every

[16:04] two weeks on a Thursday or whatever. And it didn't. You know, all these different things

[16:09] disappointed people to the point where they just kind of flagged the game as this joke.

[16:15] And that was really disappointed because, you know, I kind of broke into a new market. I've been

[16:20] doing artwork for the entertainment industry for a long time, but, you know, when I got called in

[16:25] for Batman, I'm like, I love pinball. This is great, you know, and I just get hauled in and pulled

[16:32] this miracle off, at least as far as I'm concerned. And everyone just kind of makes a joke about it.

[16:37] And, you know, it really sucked. It's not here the truth. You know, I had sense learned, you know,

[16:43] what pinside is like and not, you know, I don't want to black ball everybody on pinside. But,

[16:48] you know, there is a faction of trolls on there that just, I don't know if they just can't afford a

[16:53] game. So they just bitch about everything or, you know, what their problem is. I've, you know, I've

[16:57] since learned that. But I lately I've been hearing, you know, now that lineman is getting the code

[17:04] around to where he wants it and people are playing it and they're really liking it. It's definitely

[17:10] taken the sting off. And, you know, I'm still proud of it. I don't care what what people say and,

[17:16] you know, about the game. And there are a few people that, you know, made remarks like, oh,

[17:20] Skittles or whatever, you know, this is the same old stupid joke. You know, watch a TV show.

[17:26] You know, Batman was an extremely colorful show. And I think, you know, I'm going to get branded

[17:31] like the Skittles artist or something because Batman was a colorful show. So that's how I designed it.

[17:36] Guardians of the Galaxy was a colorful movie. So that's how I designed it. I think everybody's

[17:40] just going to think I'm going to turn every property into a Skittles game or something. But,

[17:44] you know, whatever. But, you know, the bright colored games in the game room pop. And I think

[17:51] you're right. I think the colors you're using are the color palettes that are coming from these

[17:56] franchises. You're not, you're not making these color patterns up and using, you know,

[18:01] this, it's true to those universes. So it's, I think in the end though, I think what's interesting

[18:07] Chris is you're still not seeing a lot of Batman, whether Ellie's or super Ellie's come up for sale.

[18:13] And I think that's testament that people have a lot of faith in Lyman sheets. And that in the end,

[18:20] he'll make this game great. And so we'll see. I think we, someone put up a timeline of how long it

[18:27] takes Lyman to finally finish a game from beginning to end. It's, it's somewhere in the seven to

[18:32] 800 days. So we have another six months to a year before it's complete, complete. But in the

[18:38] end, it's usually worth it. So you might have the last laugh of all the people who criticized it.

[18:44] Absolutely. Absolutely. I think it's a fantastic game. You know, to tell you the truth,

[18:49] I'm still playing the version that it came with. You know, I got it in February. So I don't know

[18:55] what version it is, but it's a very early version of the code. And I've never updated. I still have a

[19:00] ball. I know I'm missing out. I've seen some cool videos of, you know, like Batman running around

[19:05] with a pinball like it's the bomb. And, you know, are you waiting for it to be done before you

[19:10] update or you just too lazy? A little of both actually. I wouldn't say lazy. I just don't care.

[19:18] You know, I've never been, I'm, this is probably sacrilegious to say into the pinball crowd. But

[19:23] I've never been big into code because I grew up playing games that didn't have any. Right. You

[19:28] know, I mean, I grew up playing Captain Fantastic. You know, we had like, you know, a, you know,

[19:32] a couple of drop down targets and three pop bumpers in the middle. And that was about it.

[19:39] You know, so, so all of that stuff is still kind of formed to me. I watch, like I watch Jack

[19:44] Danures videos on, you know, how to play Batman. And I'm like, wait, hit the computer how many times?

[19:49] And then what, you know, and then I'm trying to do it. And I lose count. I don't know what the fuck I'm

[19:53] doing. I, you know, if I just get a lot of points, I'm like, I gotta do something, right? I'll try to do that.

[19:57] Yeah. But, you know, it's that that that part isn't as important to me. And that's not to say that I

[20:06] you know, don't think that anybody, you know, other players I'm searching for the right word. But,

[20:13] you know, it's definitely valid to be concerned about that or to, you know, make sure that the code

[20:19] is good or whatever, you know, people that are into that, it's a valid thing. So I get it. It's

[20:23] not important to me. Right. I think, you know, I think the community is definitely mixed in terms of

[20:29] look how they look at code and what they want from a machine. And I think, you know, we're going to

[20:34] sort of maybe jump around a little bit tonight. But I think, you know, a lot of people two night

[20:38] watch the Guardians of the Galaxy, Jack Danures stream over at Stern today of the machine.

[20:46] And code is really early on. And I think what the point you just made is something I've

[20:52] been feeling for a long time. And that's so much of pinball now is being critiqued by what's

[20:58] up on the LCD screen. Right. And it's, yeah, it's almost like people are missing the game. And even

[21:04] the games themselves, it's like, are we are we watching something or are we playing something? You

[21:10] can't do both at the same time. When you're playing pinball, you're looking down. So everything that's

[21:14] up there, you can't even watch it. So it's not a, it's not a video game. That's a fucking pinball

[21:20] machine. Right. Whatever's on that screen is for anybody that's around you.

[21:24] Right. Well, there were no, and it was interesting tonight. And I don't know why. And I know

[21:29] you're watching some of the stream. There weren't any call outs from the actors in the movie.

[21:35] And I think that sort of like jumped out as like we're just hearing music. Like you saw the clips

[21:40] from the film and there weren't the actors that was like, they were having like a silent movie

[21:44] staring competition. But I, I guess those call outs are going to go in, but the code is early on.

[21:52] And yeah, I want to talk a lot of a lot about the art. And I think my only thing is, and I know,

[21:57] you know, Chris, you're sort of caught up in the middle of, you've done your work, right? Like,

[22:01] you've completed everything they asked you to do. Right. But a pinball machine when it goes to the

[22:06] public, the art and the design and the layout, that's one thing. And then the software becomes

[22:12] another thing. It just always seems to be this hard to get all the elements completed on day one

[22:18] when consumers pick up the game because people actually have the game in their collection today.

[22:24] At least they're going to get to look at beautiful art. So let's talk about the creation

[22:28] of this game because you had more time. You get the assignment. When did you first hear that

[22:33] Guardians of the Galaxy was going to be the next title and were you excited when you were told

[22:38] that's what you'd be working on? It was about a month after Expo last year. And I was definitely

[22:48] excited because I had kind of hopped on the Guardians of the Galaxy bandwagon late. I did not see

[22:56] it in theaters the first one. And somebody told me, I'm just not really a big Marvel fan. I'm a

[23:02] Batman fan. And someone told me that I should really check it out so I watched it. And it was,

[23:07] it was only maybe a couple months before they told me I'd be working on it. And when I watched it,

[23:11] I fell in love with it. So yeah, I was very excited to get the chance to do that.

[23:18] So you hear about it. And then from there, walk us through the process because I know when you

[23:25] came on the Batman, it was like you inherited the game that needed like quick touch ups and you were

[23:31] able to sort of take stuff out and put your stuff in and make it look great. Here you're working

[23:36] with a blank canvas. Now, how does it work? So John Borg's designing the game, you can get going

[23:43] immediately on the cabinet and the back box. And are you working with the studio in terms of what

[23:49] assets you can use? How did it work for you with this game? Yeah, that's basically dead on.

[23:57] I came in for a meeting and they had a very crude whitewood together. And I'm just looking at this

[24:07] thing and I'm like, okay, and when you look as an artist, when you look at a whitewood, it's

[24:15] extremely intimidating because all you see are ramps and plastics and inserts everywhere and

[24:25] nothing else. Nothing ties it together. So it just looks like a big mess. It looks like a

[24:33] twister, you know, Matt, which is little circle dots everywhere. And then you've got to go, okay,

[24:40] well, I'm filling up this space. I got to make it interesting. There's crap everywhere. I don't know

[24:44] what to do with this. So my first meeting going out there was pretty intimidating because I did not

[24:50] do the play field on Batman. I only did the character art. I did the villains and the Batman

[24:57] and the Robin. I did the artwork of them on the bat poles that go down the side drains. And

[25:04] basically this said, we need this, draw this and send it in. And and Kevin O'Connor did the

[25:11] play field and he just placed my art in there. So coming into Guardians, you know, that was a

[25:17] scary task, you know, doing a back glass and the side cat and it's easy. This is like creating a

[25:23] piece of art, you know, make something interesting. There's nothing in the way. Other than a hinge on

[25:29] the back, you know, back box hinge, you know, do what you want. But so I was really focusing on that

[25:37] whitewood and trying to think of, you know, what I was going to what I was going to do with that.

[25:42] And then basically I got back and put that on the back burner and started out the cabinets and

[25:48] back glass designs as far as assets from Marvel. I got a whole zip drive or not zip drive. But

[26:02] what do you call it? Portable hard drive. Full of logos, background things and whatnot.

[26:10] And, you know, as an artist, you tend to want to not use any of that.

[26:17] It's like, what can I get away with? So I did as much as I could on my own. I tried to ignore

[26:27] the backgrounds and, you know, use as much as I thought that Marvel would be happy with. Like the

[26:36] the hexagon pattern thing that was me and to answer all the critics out there was like,

[26:43] what's with all these hexagons? If you pay attention to the movie, that's how they jump

[26:48] from, you know, all the different galaxies as they're going through these little hexagons.

[26:54] Right. And when they go through it, when they go through it, it kind of pings and you can see

[26:59] all of these hexagons attached to it that make a big hexagon field. So, you know, since it was

[27:06] guardians of the galaxy, you know, I thought, well, what better way, you know,

[27:10] what better pattern to use than, you know, the sort of a web that ties all these galaxies together.

[27:17] Right. And when, I'm looking at the play field now, Chris, and when you're doing the character art,

[27:23] now, is Marvel giving you images or photographs or stills from the film and say,

[27:31] hey, you can draw Chris Pratt like this or are you allowed to freely draw him however you want?

[27:37] Well, what happened was, you know, I don't know what their standard rule is because I don't think

[27:42] it applied to the situation because what happened was I had submitted a pencil sketch

[27:47] very early on and I hate, I really don't like doing pencil sketches for concepts. I'll do them at my

[27:55] house, you know, and kind of rough out what I want to do. Usually not spend a lot of time on it,

[28:00] just so I can get down head goes here, shape goes here, you know, etc, etc. But on the pencil sketch,

[28:08] I had the five characters on the side and Chris Pratt looked a little funky, but it was just because

[28:15] I didn't take a lot of time doing it. I figured, well, they know what my artwork looks like,

[28:20] they know it's going to look like him, but here's where his head goes. And I think they put a little

[28:27] bit too much stock into the quick sketch and went, well, you know, maybe we shouldn't do this,

[28:33] maybe we should just use style guide art, photos or whatever. So then I submitted a drawing of

[28:39] rocket and group that I had done and they were fine with that. So I'm like, okay, well,

[28:46] what I'm basically going to do that is I'm going to draw everything and if they tell me to replace

[28:51] anything, I'll replace it. And that's basically what I did. And when the day was done, they didn't

[29:02] change a thing. I mean, I even got away with, there's an Easter egg on there, we'll reveal one

[29:07] Easter egg right now just for the sake of this part of the discussion. If you're to, if you're

[29:13] cleaning your machine and you unscrew your metal ramp in the shooter lane, underneath it has

[29:18] got a picture of the Milano flying through space and it says, you said it bitch, we're the

[29:23] Guardians of the Galaxy. And they saw that and they let it go, they didn't care. A lot of

[29:32] characters that weren't in the style guide. I used like a, did a drawing of Cosmo and they

[29:39] led through, I did a drawing of the, it was kind of a crew drawing because it's for an insert, but the

[29:47] broker and they let that through. But we were not allowed to touch the collector. Apparently,

[29:54] Benicio del Toro had this deal where it's like, because there, there was representation of him in

[29:59] the style guide and the assets, but they were just like silhouettes or like, you know, it would

[30:04] look like a spotlight was shining on his stomach. You know, but his head was all dark. So that was

[30:10] obviously off limits. But yeah, so everything else I drew and they accept that I even the, I

[30:19] knew we only had the license for the first movie. But around the time that I started working on

[30:25] this, they were advertising the sequel and they had these, I was in Vegas at the time and they

[30:29] had this massive billboard, you know, LED billboard on one of the casinos with, with the advertisement

[30:37] for part two. And I had this big fiery ring around them and like the colors were all really bright

[30:43] and I'm just like, that looks beautiful, but it's not a character. I'll bet I could get away with

[30:48] that. So I recreated it and that's that fire ring that you see in all the art packages that ties

[30:53] all the characters together and that's that's, you know, just basically me trying to milk as much as

[30:59] I can out of it as possible. So all these people who are bitching about this and that it's like, look,

[31:05] I'm on your side, you know, I want this game to be as good as it possibly can be as well and I'm

[31:11] going to get away with whatever I can to make everybody happy. Right. And so when you talk about

[31:18] the style guide with the characters, so for example, like the Chris Pratt holding the gun up with

[31:24] his left hand now, is that they gave you a style guide image of him in that pose or yeah, I had,

[31:32] I had put the poster shots, right. And I just drew from that because that's what I had. Right.

[31:40] I didn't, you know, I didn't have the time to like go through and like, you know, draw from,

[31:46] you know, screen grabs or whatever and pray that they would approve it. Or if not, you know, I've

[31:53] just spent three days on an illustration that's going to get thrown in the garbage can and I started

[31:57] over again. So I knew if I, if I based all the artwork on, you know, pre-approved poses that they

[32:04] had from posters or whatnot, that it would be cool. And so everything worked out like that.

[32:09] What's interesting, Chris, when you talked about seeing the whitewood and how the whitewood

[32:14] is filled with inserts, one of the cool features of this game in terms of integration of inserts

[32:21] and artwork is the star-lord image between the flippers, whereas eyes are inserts. Was that originally

[32:29] planned by, by Borg to have that there and the inserts were put there or is that something you guys

[32:33] worked on together? That is 100% John Borg. When I got the, yeah, when I got the schematic with all

[32:42] the inserts, those two inserts were there and it said in type star-lord mask. So that's exactly

[32:50] what he wanted. When you're doing a play field and as I look at it now, how do, how do,

[32:56] talk to me about the layering to get the effect, right? So we've got all this, you've got the characters

[33:02] but then behind them or sort of what they're sitting on top of is, you know, sort of the cosmos and

[33:08] you have different elements going on, you've got Groot with the vines. How do you map that out?

[33:14] Like what comes first? Well, you know, to be honest, I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do,

[33:26] as far as what I wanted to incorporate into the design and what I basically did was I started off

[33:33] right in the center. I started off with all of the mode icons and built from around there and as I

[33:41] went up, I'm like, all right, I've got to include the villains. Here's a good space to include these

[33:45] guys because there were so many inserts and I knew that, you know, all these things were going to be

[33:49] marked off. They're going to be blocking space. I've got to work around it. So I basically looked

[33:56] at what I had and said, okay, well Groot's head is up there rather than just have it look like

[34:00] Easter Island, like, you know, there's a head sitting on a mound and nothing. You know, we should

[34:06] tie some of those, you know, elements into that area. So, you know, coming out, you know, it's

[34:12] almost kind of like the, where the vines and stuff are coming out around the under his chin. It's

[34:16] almost kind of like his chest, you know, there's a plastic behind him that has vines on it, you know,

[34:22] and that sort of represents his shoulders. And then of course, on the back of the playfield,

[34:28] there are all these vines and all those little glowing embers and it says, we are Groot when he

[34:34] kind of like spread himself out into a big round ball to protect everybody. You know, it's just

[34:42] pulling those things together in the proper areas. Right. You know, to fill out a lot of the sides

[34:53] where the plastics are, I just made a conscious choice that I did not want to use characters for that.

[35:00] I thought if the characters run the playfield, that's all you need. Let's help create this world

[35:06] and this look and the visuals with all the plastics and that's why they all have this sort of

[35:11] like techno, space guard and, you know, whatnot on it because it just kind of builds the world,

[35:17] helps build the world. Right. And when you're doing the art, Chris, and you're laying out the

[35:23] color scheme, and this is obviously very a bright, colorful art pattern here,

[35:30] does John talk to you about the lighting in the game? We're in a full RGB LED and do you sort of

[35:36] try to work with that or is it, is it hard to sort of get a sense of, or does it not even matter,

[35:42] like how the game's going to light up with how the artwork will be? He had literally nothing to say

[35:51] other than Star Lord's Mask goes here. And that's why I was so intimidated because like, I don't

[35:57] know if they just wanted to see what I would do with it, but they gave me no direction whatsoever.

[36:03] You know, there's like Star Lord's Mask goes down here and of course they indicated,

[36:07] you know, like this is the Gamora shot, this is the broker shot. But nothing as far as artwork

[36:14] goes, as far as what was going to be, you know, how things were going to light up or anything,

[36:18] they just said go. Right. So I just started to ask you questions like, can I put faces on these

[36:24] arrows? Because it seems, you know, like it would make, rather than, you know, who's got time to

[36:30] read while you're playing pinball? If you can make an association with a shot, like that's the Gamora

[36:34] shot because there's her face on the arrow, you know, you can't screw that up. It just takes

[36:39] a second to see that. So I asked if I could do that and said, sure, you know, when the where the

[36:47] X multipliers are, they said there's going to be an X on here. Because they said to be like a

[36:50] black X, you're going to make like a really cool look at X, do what you want. So, you know, they

[36:56] didn't really give me any direction. They just let me ask questions and told me what I could do

[37:00] and what I couldn't do. And we ended up what we ended up with. And honestly, they, the changes

[37:08] that they made were so minor, you know, as far as like, I think we had a particular color outline

[37:16] around, uh, Ronin and they said, well, that lane's going to be yellow. So could you put a yellow,

[37:21] halo around him instead of what you have? But that was really it. I think originally that the Yondu

[37:28] shot that goes into that, uh, shoot up the side, the left side. And then it ends and has this little

[37:35] things as impact area. There's like a white honeycomb pattern. I printed over the top plastic. So

[37:42] it would kind of look like it's getting shot into this little cool cage or whatever.

[37:46] They asked me to clear some of that pattern out up at the top so you could see where the balls stopped.

[37:52] And you could see the the insert down in there. But, you know, just mild little tweaks like that,

[37:57] or you know, where all they really asked. And we went with the original design, uh, you know,

[38:03] that I had built from day one. So, so not many changes, which is like really interesting,

[38:11] because I think, you know, when we looked at Star Wars, it seemed like Disney, you know, had a

[38:15] lot of feedback, right? They're really difficult to work with in terms of what they will let you do

[38:20] or get away with. But it sounds like your vision pretty much 98% is what we're getting. Not much

[38:29] altered. Yeah. And I wouldn't attribute that to Disney being thrilled with what they got,

[38:34] because basically Disney had nothing to do with it. It was all the Marvel people. And Marvel

[38:38] people are honestly wonderful to work with when it comes to art, because they're,

[38:44] um, they're much more loose with with what you do as long as you as long as what you do fits,

[38:52] they're happy, but you can bring in a style, you can bring in whatever you want to the table.

[38:57] And as long as they like it and they think it works, they'll go with it, whereas like Warner Brothers

[39:00] with Batman, and they're just like, no, like, you know, they're very cookie cutter on how you do

[39:05] things. The TV show, they're a little bit easier on that. But, you know, as far as handling the

[39:11] the comic book character of Batman, they're, you know, they're, they're not as loose when it comes

[39:17] to artwork. So, so Marvel to their credit. Yeah, they were just, they were happy with what they got.

[39:23] And, and so that was really it. They didn't really have any, they didn't have any, any changes.

[39:28] Right. I mean, I think it looks, you know, obviously, I think it looks great. I think people have

[39:33] given the game pretty unanimous appraise for the art. And I think the inserts especially to

[39:39] are very cool. I think where, you know, we see on some games like just the generic comic sands

[39:45] font, but this game has a lot of character with, with the inserts. And it's, it's, you've got artwork

[39:52] on them. You've got different fonts. You've got things that break up the monotony of, of the styles,

[39:56] which, which in a way comes together in a cohesive fun sort of art package. Now, Chris, when you

[40:02] first saw the whitewood, we're groutons in the original concepts. That's something people, a lot of

[40:08] people have talked about, like his sculpted hands coming out over the play field. The hands, no,

[40:13] I did not see it the hands. I saw the head. And the first thing I had seen with the head was like

[40:19] this kind of crudely done 3D printed head. It kind of had the detail, but it was like there was

[40:27] kind of chunks missing and it was kind of weird. But I could tell, once it was done, it was going to be

[40:32] a really nice piece because a lot of that sculpted stuff doesn't usually come out super nice.

[40:37] The hands were basically described to me the first time I saw the whitewood, the first time

[40:42] there, that there were not there. And there's like, it was going to be, you know, for the, for the

[40:46] premium and the LED is going to be his hands coming up right here. And basically, I didn't put

[40:54] that into consideration at all. I just like, they can't be a roadblock for me as far as design goes.

[40:59] I'm just going to do my job. And then that's going to go in where it goes in.

[41:03] Right. And so we're like, let's talk about some of the Easter eggs. So I know I'm looking at

[41:09] the Walkman. Now, now, now, correct me if I'm wrong, but Sony, right, they've made it hard to have

[41:14] the actual Walkman from the film itself, right? They have their own licensing issues with that.

[41:20] So this is sort of like a, and in very close interpretation of Star, Lord's Walkman, right?

[41:27] Right. Yeah. Yeah. Originally, I had taken the Sony logo and it said, sunny.

[41:33] And yeah, they weren't having that. We're not Sony, but Stern, they're like, no, let's just take

[41:40] the name off. And then they said, you know, while you're at it, why don't you just kind of

[41:45] move it around a little and make it look a little bit different. So the buttons aren't in the same

[41:49] place or whatever. So yeah, I was able to use the tape, but the Walkman, yeah, just changed a

[41:58] little bit. That's not really even an Easter egg. It's just there's so much going on in here.

[42:04] Right. What should we, what should we be looking at that's like a little hidden detail inside

[42:10] this, this art package because I'm just scanning. Yeah. Well, you've got, there's two plastic

[42:17] stepped stacked on top of each other right when the ball comes out of the shooter lane.

[42:21] And it lines up right underneath a ramp. So if you look at the right ramp up at the top, you'll see

[42:30] kind of forgot his name. Who's the dog? There's a cosmo, I might just make it up. Yeah, yeah,

[42:36] it says cosmo. Yeah. Yeah, there's a little cosmo there. So I put him in because he kind of,

[42:41] he just kind of randomly, even in the comic books, he just kind of pops up here in there. So

[42:46] I had to get him in there. You can't really see it when you're playing the game, but if you

[42:52] walked up along the left side and looked at the left orbit, Ronan's up there and you're saying,

[42:58] you dare to oppose me and he's holding his hammer out. That's sort of an Easter egg because,

[43:04] like I said, when you stand there playing with him, you can't see it. You got to walk around and look

[43:08] for it. We talked about the you said it, bitch. Other than that, the only the only other one,

[43:18] well, there's there's another Easter egg and there's not a tribute. The other Easter egg is the

[43:23] on the pro only on the left sling. There is a little like gauge looks like you know oil gauge

[43:32] from an old car or something. And I took the alphabet the the Guardians alphabet for it was one

[43:41] of the foreign language alphabets. I don't remember which one. And it basically spelled my last name

[43:46] with these characters. And if you look at it, you can kind of see my name because the letters aren't

[43:50] that far off from you know regular English letters. I just look kind of digital and funky.

[43:56] Right. Very cool. So that and then the tribute. It's a small little tribute to Paul Ferris who did

[44:04] well numerous games, but in particular the 89 Batman. He had the coming down the I'm still getting

[44:14] used to all these different terms to the the drop lane that comes down to the to the flipper.

[44:21] So there's the outline and then the drop lane. Is that what it's called?

[44:26] Oh my god. It's an in lane. I don't think so. Yeah. What you're asking? I get the pinball terminology wrong

[44:32] all the time and I get chastised. How does it drive? I haven't got time for these terms.

[44:36] Yeah, just a stuff that doesn't drain. The one that goes to the flipper. We'll just call that.

[44:40] Yeah. Yeah. The right in lane. It has one of the the good guy ships. God, I'm not

[44:47] through remembering anything today, but the you know the place where they end up at and they fix

[44:53] the guy you know their ship and all that whatever that stupid planet is. I don't remember.

[44:58] The good guy planes coming down there and the Milano ship coming down the left lane in the Batman 89

[45:05] game. Paul Ferris drew the bat wing flying down the right in lane and the bat will be all driving

[45:11] down the left. So it's kind of like a little tribute to him. Put me there. But that's really it for

[45:19] little sneaky stuff. Right. I had some other stuff that was was going to go in. There was even a

[45:27] change. You know, now might be a good time to address the. Did you have any questions about the

[45:32] total nuclear annihilation similarities? So we heard that, right? The what wasn't even so much of like

[45:41] the art package per se as it was. Yeah. Just stern sort of using 80s. Yeah. It's really just

[45:51] that. The magic in their logo and everyone's like as if total nuclear annihilation owns that

[45:58] art pattern. It's all stuff that's inspired by the 80s art sort of direction looks sort of in

[46:04] that vein. Right. Yeah. Well, the truth on that logo is that number one, I didn't do it. It was

[46:10] done by a gentleman named Stephen Martin, that's stern, who's a he's a production guy in the

[46:15] art department there. And he had no concept of what was going on with total nuclear annihilation.

[46:21] He had even seen the game. He just knew, you know, that there's that retro look out there. And

[46:29] he just did it for fun. And no one else caught it and it just kind of went through. If I had done

[46:34] that, I probably, you know, I wouldn't have thought, well, you know, I'll total nuclear annihilation

[46:39] has the rights on it. I wouldn't have thought that. I just would have thought to myself just best

[46:43] to stay away. Because like, for example, the original slings, and this was like a last minute thing,

[46:50] the original slings on Guardian of the galaxy had those black and yellow warning bars across the

[46:58] the bounce part of the sling, you know, that sort of a barricade thing. And I saw pictures of

[47:05] TNA when it came out and they had the same thing. And I'm like, oh, shit. So I called up

[47:10] stern right away and it said, do I have time to make a change on those plastics? And they said,

[47:14] yeah, but you got to get it in like now. So I went and redesigned new sling plastics in like two

[47:20] hours and sent it in to replace it so that it wouldn't be reminiscent of that.

[47:26] I was, because I thought, you know, like, what dumb luck, you know, I don't think there's ever been a pinball

[47:31] with that on it. And of course, I do it. And then it pops up. Well, the other, the other, I would say,

[47:36] they ripped it off because they never saw my work. The other area to I think in the game, people were

[47:41] comparing is, I guess, by the infinity stone area, the game, the ball gets trapped behind the drop

[47:47] target. And I know, all right, TNA has like, they lock three balls using three different drop

[47:53] targets. But look, it's also pinball on some level. All this stuff is inspired by something that

[47:59] came before it. And I know Star Trek. Star Trek. Yeah, Star Trek. So Chris, talk to me about the

[48:07] cabinet artwork. So you, do you design all three and do you design in terms of like Ellie,

[48:14] Premium, Pro, where you just do three and then you figure out like what, what goes where?

[48:18] I basically design in a package, but I don't, I don't design like, okay, now I'm going to do the

[48:27] Ellie. I'll just design, I'll start with a cabinet. And then I'll follow through that. Okay,

[48:32] what would look good in the front? What would make a good backlash on everything's cohesive?

[48:39] The one direction I was given is that they really wanted the limited edition one to come off as sort

[48:44] of a group and rocket model, which is why the artwork is lean towards them. And then everyone says,

[48:51] Hulkamus is just grunting, you know, rock. It's so big, the backlash. And because it's,

[48:56] because bored kind of wanted a group and rocket model. So that's what he got.

[49:02] But, you know, basically they kind of left it up to me. As far as once we had decided on the packages,

[49:09] obviously the rocket and group one is going to be the, the, the, the, the, the, the, Ellie. But the other two,

[49:17] I just thought, and I know a lot of people hate me for it. And I kind of hate myself for it,

[49:23] because I'm getting a premium myself. But I thought that the best art package should go on the

[49:29] Pro, because that's the one that's probably going to be seen the most. You know, it's in our

[49:36] Cades and things like that. So, well, you know, if we really want this thing to, you know,

[49:40] represent Stern and be a killer looking game. And the pro is going to be the one that's out there

[49:45] at all these arcades. Let's give it the best art package. Whereas now, I'm getting a premium myself.

[49:51] And I'm thinking like, you know, I don't mind the art package on the premium. But I'm like,

[49:54] boy, I really wish I could have that pro.

[49:56] Right.

[49:56] Well, yeah. And I, I, I've yelled at you off, offline or online many times, because I think my

[50:04] argument is always the people who pay the most should get the nicest looking. It should,

[50:09] right. Like, like, you know, it's all like for these collectors, though, I mean, at the end of

[50:15] the day, unless your machine is on the end of your row of games, you never even end up seeing

[50:20] the cabin artwork for the most part when, when people stack their games up. I mean, it's, yeah,

[50:26] it's, I mean, I think between that, and then you also had the whole, the WWE armor leftover,

[50:34] controversy that I pretty much was fanny those flames as that was going down. I think the thing

[50:41] is this is like these games are starting to be really expensive, right, Chris? And I think people

[50:45] are looking at the limited edition versions of anything now and not just stern games, but every

[50:51] manufacturer is people are saying, am I getting what I'm paying for? And at this price point,

[50:59] I think people have a right to sort of demand the best and also to not have to add additional

[51:06] things to make the game look great, because even now, like if you're going on in Ellie for Guardians,

[51:11] you're going to want that laser cut armor, which you then have to buy extra, which means you

[51:18] then have an extra set of armor that you don't even need. So why can you just order it from stern

[51:23] on the game? Well, I can't explain that, but all I can really tell you is everything's

[51:33] based on a bill of goods, like how much does everything cost? You know, Borg is basically

[51:40] given a budget. He says, okay, you can spend $4,000 to build a limited edition. You can spend

[51:48] $3,000 to do a premium, et cetera, et cetera. And he has to work within that realm. Now, it's not his

[51:54] job, and it's not in his best interest as a game designer to go, you know, screw $4,000. I'm going to

[52:00] bring us in at, you know, $37.50, just to, you know, make Gary happy. No, he's pushing it to that

[52:09] foreground and even beyond that, you know, and foreground is not the actual number. I don't know what it is,

[52:14] but you know, he's these guys are milking their budgets for everything they can get.

[52:22] What whether their budget is fair or not to say, you know, again, hypothetically $4,000 for

[52:29] an $8,000 machine, you know, is that fair? That's not on the designer and who makes those calls

[52:36] and why I don't know. It's usually the, the, the, the, the beam counters. But look, I mean, look, we've

[52:44] said it to you. I mean, to Stern's defense, every other manufacturer out there has financially

[52:52] driven themselves into bankruptcy. And so if you want pinball around in 2017, you have to sort of

[53:00] combine getting the best product with the ability to make a profit on it. I mean, there's just

[53:05] a way around it and it becomes more expensive every year to make these kinds of toys. Doesn't

[53:10] become cheaper. Exactly. Well, and there's, there's one more thing to factor in. And for some

[53:15] reason, people don't think it applies to pinball. But I can give you a perfect analogy in that

[53:22] I'm an artist and I sell art prints of my work. And coming out very soon, I did an illustration

[53:29] of Beloligosi as Dracula. And I'm doing a regular color print of like 100 prints. And then I'm doing

[53:37] a limited edition that's like a black and white more or less, but it's got a little bit of gold to

[53:42] it. So it's kind of a warm gray scale. And I'm only doing 20 of those. Now, those are going to

[53:46] cost more to the people who are buying them. However, it doesn't cost me a nickel more to print it.

[53:53] Right. Cost me the same amount as it does the other one. But there's only 20 of those. It's

[53:58] a limited edition. And to have something special and to make it work people's time to do these things,

[54:05] you have to pay for that exclusivity. That's just the way it is. If everything costs the same,

[54:12] then what would be special about it? Right. I mean, I use the cargument all the time. There's

[54:18] a reason why people are paying right now $30,000 over sticker price for Dodd's demons because

[54:25] they're only making $3,000 in America. If they were making $6,000, they'd all sell for the

[54:30] manufacturer's suggested retail price. Right. I would say Stern, a Stern is in a little bit of a

[54:36] guessing game with how many LEs they announced for each title. I think 600 guardians might have been

[54:40] a little bit high. You know, considering like only 240 Batman LEs. I mean, you look at the demographic

[54:47] for pinball buyers. It's, you know, dues in their 50s, mid 40s, 50s and 60s. Right.

[54:55] Guardians is a great franchise, but it doesn't have the nostalgia, right? That emotionally

[55:00] many of these guys just part with their money the way Batman does. Right. So I think, you know,

[55:05] it's a guessing game a little bit. I think in the end, will they probably sell out all of them?

[55:11] Probably when the code matures and gets to the point where it needs to be.

[55:15] But, you know, when the game was revealed, what was it like this time around? Because, you know,

[55:22] you experienced the Batman reveal and this was game two. Just walk me through like your emotions on

[55:28] that day. Soul crushing. For this one too? Well, no. The reason why was that I really wanted

[55:37] in the reveal at Expo because I was a guest there. And basically that would have taken, and I also

[55:44] did an hour long seminar. And that would have made my seminar, hey, look what I just did. But

[55:49] instead it was, hey, look what I did a year ago. Right. You know how the pinball, pinball,

[55:54] people have already forgotten about pirates of the Caribbean. Right. And that was one, only a month

[55:58] and a half ago. And they're already like, huh? What? I don't know. So, yeah, it would have been,

[56:05] you know, when you're making a trip and you're making an appearance, you, you,

[56:09] you know, I hope it doesn't sound egotistical over, but you want it to be celebrated. You want it

[56:14] to be, you, there's a purpose that you're there and you want people to be happy to see you and,

[56:19] and hey, I came out with something new and everything's all, you know, there's a buzz and

[56:23] everybody's excited. And instead I went there and I talked about something I did a year ago,

[56:27] which completely put a different spin on my trip there. And I brought my daughter there like I'm

[56:32] just going to introduce her to pinball world. And it was much less exciting for her than it could have

[56:37] been. So, do you know the reason why Chris was it just like, let's let Jack do his thing? Was it

[56:44] timing? We weren't ready? I can only assume from the bits and pieces I was told that the code wasn't

[56:52] there yet for people to play it. And they didn't want another Batman on their hands, or

[56:57] it's, you have machines roped off and like, look, don't touch. You know, it was already bad enough

[57:03] to tell us why you deserve to buy one of these, but then broke them off and say, you can't touch

[57:07] these. You know, right. So, so to come back to Expo a year later and do the same thing, I just

[57:13] don't think they wanted to do it. I'm sure there's more that goes into their marketing plans

[57:18] than that. But if I had to guess based on the little bit of information that I know,

[57:23] I would say that's what it was. It wasn't ready. Yeah, I mean, it seems to make sense is that they

[57:28] wouldn't want a repeat. I mean, for you too, I mean, to have like this endless like

[57:34] Groundhog Day, right? At two Expos in a row and, and you know, both times like people aren't

[57:40] able to enjoy the game that they visually are enjoying, but they can't flip it.

[57:46] Would be frustrating. So let's talk about it does get revealed though. So it's not exactly the way

[57:52] you would have liked it to, but it goes out there, right? We've got the, I believe it was the IGN had

[57:57] a story up and, you know, like, I'm a marketer and now part of me's just like, does it even, like,

[58:03] who even gives a shit about Expo? It doesn't really matter. I mean, you know, it would have been nice

[58:08] for your daughter to see it, but like at the end of the day, it's like we're talking about a niche

[58:14] hobby within a niche hobby. You know, like there's a few thousand people that are hyper connected and

[58:20] care so much. And it doesn't matter what day you could, you could announce it on like Christmas morning

[58:26] and they would walk away from their families and go watch the reveal, you know? So,

[58:30] right. Yeah. What was it like on that day? It was, I thought they handled it very well. Some

[58:36] people were complaining, but I thought, you know, they turned it into the day of the Guardians,

[58:40] rather than the hour of the Guardians. You had the teaser video the day before, and then the next

[58:49] day you had that sort of almost a teaser gameplay, and then they revealed the art, but kind of in,

[58:54] like a low res. And then later that day, higher res images came out. So it kind of like crept up

[59:01] on you. And I kind of liked that. I thought it made the whole day exciting because you didn't know

[59:06] what to expect next because then later on they revealed the armor and the topper. So it kind of

[59:12] took up the whole day and it made the whole day fun. You know, again, my regret in doing it that way

[59:18] is that, and it's hard to explain to the average person, but these machines that the, and I'm being

[59:27] selfish in, in this, the play field art and the cabinet art looks so much better in person than

[59:33] it does in photos. Right. And that's what I wanted people to see. I went one that was revealed. I

[59:40] wanted them to see the actual art, how it looks in person. Because just the way the colors are,

[59:47] it's really hard to represent and capture and photography. And when I knew that's how it was going

[59:52] to be revealed, I was just kind of like, ah, yeah, right. So that was the only bummer. But I thought it

[59:57] was a very fun day. And Chris, I said, good. No, it's a low res, the low res beginning. Is that a

[01:00:07] strategy or is it just like, because I don't know why do they do that? I don't know. I honestly don't know.

[01:00:14] I thought it was fun just because like I said, it kind of spread the fun out throughout the day.

[01:00:20] You know, like everybody was on the pin side, like, what is that? I can't really see. You know, what's going on

[01:00:26] there? And what, you know, and then later on, they get to see it. But for two hours, three hours, they're

[01:00:31] speculating and guessing. And it just made the day very fun. Right. I couldn't tell, I don't know why

[01:00:36] they do anything that, like, literally, I send them artwork. And if I, if I call, like I had to

[01:00:43] call them and say or email them and say, hey, Greg, did you like show me a picture of this machine

[01:00:48] all built? Because they just take my work and they're like, all right, thanks. You know, and that's

[01:00:53] it. I'm not in on, you know, any meetings afterwards. And hey, drive in here, you know, we've got a

[01:00:58] machine built, you know, that none of that happens. It's just kind of like, thanks for the art. See you

[01:01:02] later. Right. And, you know, because they got a job to do too. They don't want to be messing around with

[01:01:07] the stuff. But so yeah, I thought it was, I thought it was a very fun way to handle it.

[01:01:14] And then of course, I spent the day on pinside and was the static to see that 95% of the reviews

[01:01:21] on the art were 100%. Right. Well, I, and I was talking to you on that day. And I, you know,

[01:01:28] it's hard, right? Because you will get the occasional critic who will say the most obnoxious

[01:01:37] like insult as if he could even draw a stick figure. And it's hard not to take that stuff personally. I

[01:01:45] always tell you like, you do have to have like some thick skin in his hobby because everyone's a

[01:01:50] fucking critic in pinball. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one, I'm used to it. You know, I've, I've,

[01:02:01] I'm new to that. I mean, I know obviously there's the internet trolls and that whole thing

[01:02:04] exists. But I'm new to it when it comes to my work because, you know, I never had that problem

[01:02:11] before. I've worked in the entertainment industry for a long time. And, you know, all the work goes

[01:02:17] out and, and, you know, I did a Batman animated film cover, you know, Blu-ray cover. And

[01:02:26] that went out, you know, and there's no website for like, you know, Blu-ray movies where people

[01:02:30] are going to discuss the artwork. I just get my friends, you know, if you're, hey, I saw it and I

[01:02:34] picked it up, you know, great artwork. You know, so that's the extent of it. But I get thrown into

[01:02:39] this world of pinball and you really experience that firsthand if you spend time, you know, these

[01:02:46] people who, who, you know, there are people on the internet who think that it's clever and they

[01:02:53] try to build a reputation for themselves or just like who can come up with the funniest insult.

[01:02:58] Right. You know, and then you got people trying to trump each other. You know, it's kind of like

[01:03:02] eBay when you bid on something and somebody outbid you and you're like, oh, fuck you,

[01:03:06] fucker. You bid more than you really wanted to just outbid someone. That's what these guys are

[01:03:11] like on Pinside some of these people. It's like, you know, oh, it looks like Unicorn vomit. Oh,

[01:03:15] yeah. Well, how about this, you know, and they throw out their burn. And it just becomes a big

[01:03:19] stupid game of insults. But I don't think anybody, they're not concerned with, in order to give a

[01:03:25] shit that what they say, you know, is insulting to people, you know, someone who will go in my case

[01:03:31] is spent four months on a project to have someone just come on go, what piece of shit? You know,

[01:03:37] make a joke. And they may not feel that way, but they want to say it because they want to get

[01:03:41] laughs. And it's like, you know, go to a comedy club if you want laughs. Right. Well, I think the

[01:03:46] thing too is because the people who work on these machines for the most part are not on Pinside.

[01:03:53] They're it's it's created an environment where people are a lot more critical because they're

[01:03:59] not saying it like in like, in the end of the opera where we're maddened, jeeries like, would you

[01:04:04] say that in the presence of the composer? You know, and that's sort of what Pinsides become. And

[01:04:10] that's why I like interviewing you, Chris, and telling the stories behind these machines because

[01:04:15] if there's one thing I wish Stern would do a little bit more of, it's it's getting the story of

[01:04:20] these machines creation out early on so that people can set their expectations and also just feel

[01:04:28] better about the game itself, you know, hearing about how long it took to make all the details and

[01:04:34] you know, what our plans are for it. And instead there's there's a wall of silence. All they see is

[01:04:40] you want $9,000 from me. Here it is. All right, go like argue debate. And that's sort of like how

[01:04:46] get them out. Yeah, I don't know what to deal with. They used to make these little, you know,

[01:04:51] 10 minute long videos and they'd interview all the people involved and I'm not sure when those

[01:04:56] came out because I didn't see them until after I got into pinball when I was working on Batman and

[01:05:01] I'm watching these little, you know, videos on how they made ACDC and walking dead and all that.

[01:05:06] And I don't know why they quit doing that, but I always thought they should have expanded on that.

[01:05:10] It should have been 20 minutes long and let's really get into it and interview the people and

[01:05:16] answer all those questions that you think people would have about it. Why they don't do that,

[01:05:21] I don't know. I couldn't tell you. A lot of it is just, you know, you become, when you become so

[01:05:28] successful without doing stuff and sometimes it's just like, if I'm stern, you know, I play both

[01:05:35] sides of it where, well, these guys are buying and we're not new in it or we, we'll see how much we

[01:05:41] can pull back in terms of our marketing spend because these people are obsessed. Like this is like a

[01:05:46] drug. They're going to buy it regardless. And I think we're starting to see the pendulum swing the

[01:05:51] other way where consumers are not rushing to go buy out a game before they've played it. And this

[01:05:58] makes sense. Like, yeah, you should play before you pay this kind of money to make sure you enjoy

[01:06:04] the game. And I think we're starting to see more of that now. Now, Chris, let's talk about the future

[01:06:08] because yeah, this isn't the end for you. So you're working on how many more projects for stern coming up.

[01:06:18] Well, for for stern, I'm working on one right now that stern never comes to me and says,

[01:06:27] we've got this, that Matt. So when you know that, you're going to do this. I don't know if they just

[01:06:30] want me to focus or what, but they're just, you know, here's, here's the game at hand go. And

[01:06:36] and that's well underway. And I am to use the parlance of our times balls deep in a game for

[01:06:46] Kapau to which I believe both of these games are scheduled for Expo release next year.

[01:06:56] Wow. So it's going to be so do you will you get your Expo vindication? Hopefully in 2018.

[01:07:06] If there is an Expo, I don't know, this is the last one was pretty weak. Now, so Kapau, obviously,

[01:07:13] Kapau made Batman 66. And yeah, I know you can't tell us what the title is, but are we talking about

[01:07:19] something that will pull on the nostalgia, hard strings of people? Is it going to be something

[01:07:24] people are familiar with? It is something that people are extremely familiar with.

[01:07:36] I think it's also something that some people thought would never happen.

[01:07:44] It's kind of tough to dance around this one. It's very big. It's very big and it transcends,

[01:07:52] you know, it's not like, you know, well, you know, it's Superman and I like Marvel. You know,

[01:07:59] it's not one of those. This is something that crosses many, many cultures.

[01:08:07] It's the Bible. Finally, it's Noah's Ark, super early Noah's Ark. To get it,

[01:08:15] Jody and Gary, you have to flood your home to get the Pimbal machine. You have to walk on water.

[01:08:20] Yeah, you have to wash away all your other Pimbal machines to buy the super limited edition of Noah's

[01:08:24] Ark. It will supply Jesus topper is brilliant. Right. Right. Well, we're excited for that. I mean,

[01:08:32] and I told you know, I'm not going to ask you anything more. I think those nuggets alone will

[01:08:37] will keep people speculating for for an entire year. In terms of the hobby now, now that you're

[01:08:44] in it, Chris, do you do you follow it a little bit more? Are you on Pinside? Are you sort of

[01:08:49] do you read? I'm kind of a turned into a pinball junkie when it comes to this stuff. Pinside,

[01:08:57] not so much. You know, I tuned in when Guardians was released to see what people would say,

[01:09:03] because you can read out, you know, the people who go, oh, it looks like Unicorn Bar, you know,

[01:09:08] it doesn't bother me at all because those people are, you know, they're there and you know,

[01:09:12] they're waiting. So you read it and you're just like almost like, you know, they come off so

[01:09:17] pathetic that it's like the jokes on them. Not that everybody has to like my work, but you know,

[01:09:24] there were people who were like, you know, and they had constructive criticisms about it.

[01:09:29] You know, they didn't say I dislike the whole thing, but you know, maybe this could have been

[01:09:32] this or whatever, you know, and those are reasonable people and reasonable comments. But I'm more like,

[01:09:40] I've come, I've turned into this like pinball podcast junkie like I'll get in in the morning and I'll,

[01:09:46] I've got a couple of pages open like yours is one. And then I've got this one that's like, you know,

[01:09:53] I don't know FM player or something like the best pinball cup podcast. And there's like 10 of them

[01:09:57] on there and then just hit refresh and it'll, you know, of course coast to coast pinball still says

[01:10:04] five weeks because that was their whole last episode.

[01:10:08] Where is me chivers? I mean, I hope I hope he was going to come back more frequently.

[01:10:15] Yeah, the last thing he talked about was pirates at Expo. That's that's been a while now.

[01:10:19] So yeah, I wanted his thoughts on my game. And what I really like about his podcast is he's kind of,

[01:10:26] he's kind of like the calm cool collected voice of reason. Right. He doesn't get upset about anything.

[01:10:33] You know, he's passionate about it, but he's he doesn't fly off the handle.

[01:10:38] I don't know anybody like that. He has a podcast.

[01:10:40] I love what you do with that. It's like I always hope like, you know, I think there's only one one

[01:10:46] that I missed that went up and got taken down before I got to it. I'm like, damn it.

[01:10:50] Yeah, I mean, my my drunk ones are classic. Some guys have them on like auto download and they

[01:10:56] should they should put them on eBay and sell them for for a high profit.

[01:11:03] Well, look, I mean, I think you and I are probably guys who got into pinball a little bit later.

[01:11:09] It isn't interesting. Hobbit. I think what makes pinball so fun is just how passionate the

[01:11:14] people in it are. Like I don't think I've seen a hobby where literally there's not that much news,

[01:11:22] but these people keep it going on a daily basis like no other form I've seen. Yeah. Yeah. That

[01:11:29] that the people involved in doing it too. You know, I was really impressed meeting meeting

[01:11:35] Borg and talking to him about it. You know, there's another thing that pisses me off as people are

[01:11:42] like, oh, just like Metallica, just like this, just like that. It's like, well, why, you know,

[01:11:46] that people ever think that pinball designers would have a style like an artist would

[01:11:53] or a musician would, you know, you hear an ACDC song and you know, that's ACDC, you know,

[01:11:59] if you see a Picasso, you know, it's Picasso. You know, pinball designers, I'm sure are the same

[01:12:05] way. There's things that they like. There's things they're comfortable with. There's things that

[01:12:08] they think are entertaining in pinball. And that's what makes them unique as a designer. And

[01:12:14] and you know, when I compared this to Metallica, you know, there are similarities in

[01:12:21] way it's laid out, but not in the way it's played. But how much do you think you can get away with,

[01:12:27] you know, in this small field where ball rolls around, you're like, wow, we supposed to come out with

[01:12:33] an earth shattering innovation every year on every machine. There's supposed to be some,

[01:12:38] all the ball goes up the back glass, spits out this tube, comes down the side, goes through your

[01:12:43] pocket, you know, it's the people who have that complaint though, they're like the .01% of people

[01:12:52] who that like have memorized every single combo and shot. And like, and it's just like, at the end

[01:12:59] of the day, Metallica is heralded as one of the greatest stirons of all time. And so is Iron Man.

[01:13:04] And if you put the two together, how is that a negative? Exactly. Yeah, if you took the better

[01:13:12] things of both of those and you improved upon them and added more good stuff, you know, you've

[01:13:19] basically got, you know, like a, what do you call it? Like a gene spliced baby, you know,

[01:13:27] of perfect him. So basically, obviously, it's going to be better than the machine that came

[01:13:32] up prior to that. And that's all you hope for. Is this machine better than what's come out before it?

[01:13:37] Yes. Is it light years away? Probably not, but what the hell do you want?

[01:13:41] Well, we're not driving around in space cars, you know, after we drove a 74 grand,

[01:13:46] you know, we're going to have to get there. Right. Right. What's amazing to me too is,

[01:13:52] is, you know, Stern announced this game just a few weeks ago. And when someone sent me a picture

[01:13:58] of guardians going out to a customer today, and I know someone already has it in their

[01:14:03] game room, that's where they're just always going to win because they get people a product. Now,

[01:14:09] what state that product is in will always be the debate on Pinside. But how many other

[01:14:14] manufacturers out there have yet to even give people a game they paid for eight years ago?

[01:14:22] Oh, yeah. You know, there's less than a hundred people even have their alien pinball machine. And

[01:14:26] it was announced in 2014. He started taking money. So, yeah, I think patience goes along with

[01:14:33] pinball now. I think if you want a cadence of games to come out, you're going to know if you

[01:14:39] go in as an early adopter, it's probably not going to be finished. And by now, you know that.

[01:14:44] So if you're going to go in early, I don't want to hear any complaining anymore because it's just

[01:14:49] the way it is. Right. It's just the way it is. And rolling the dice with a, you know, fly by

[01:14:54] night company as well. Right. Yeah. Do people actually think Lyman's not going to finish Batman? I mean,

[01:15:01] do people think that Stern's not going to get to it? They'll get to it. I mean, yes, if the game

[01:15:05] comes out and no one buys it, they might cut bait on some games every once in a while. But

[01:15:11] that's just the way it works with these things. So Chris, you said it yourself as far as Lyman

[01:15:16] goes, his, his average is around 700 days to get code works supposed to be. So he's still got

[01:15:22] well, 300 days on credit. Why would it go another year to go? Like he's at 0.81. And 1.0 is usually

[01:15:30] where, you know, where it's considered done. But then he always seems to go a little bit past that

[01:15:36] and polish the game. Like I think, you know, we all know that he's a big fan of Batman and so is

[01:15:41] George Gomez. And they're not going to stop until it has the Lyman magic in there. And I think

[01:15:49] all the owners are going to be satisfied in the end. Would I want to have owned that machine for

[01:15:54] that year the last year? Probably not. But, but you know what? It still works better than the

[01:16:01] machine I'm staring at right now. So if anyone wants to trade a Batman super early for a magic

[01:16:07] girl and some cash, come over. I'll make you that trade tonight because. Get your box of lights

[01:16:13] right here. Get your box of lights. There's nothing more frustrating than a game that will never work.

[01:16:18] So, yeah. Well, Chris, I really appreciate you taking the time. We're right around the hour mark.

[01:16:24] I enjoy talking to you on a daily basis. For those of you out there, I can tell you this guy cares.

[01:16:30] He's very passionate. I think he poured a ton of passion into this project. I think the game looks

[01:16:35] great. I think now it's up to people out there to play the game. Make sure you like it. If the code's

[01:16:41] not where you want it to be, you can always wait. You're going to have to, you know, if you want an

[01:16:46] L.E., you're going to have to figure out, can you get it before it sells out? Will it sell out? That's

[01:16:51] just something that all of us buyers just have to weigh when we go in on these machines. But Chris,

[01:16:56] I think the game looks amazing. I think it's going to shoot amazing. You know, and I can't wait to

[01:17:03] play it. That's all I can say. I mean, I'm sure we'll have one in New York City soon. Any closing

[01:17:07] words before we talk again on this podcast in the future? Well, thank you to everybody who

[01:17:16] has been positive about it. Those comments don't mean a lot. It's nice to know when you put that

[01:17:23] much time into something that people appreciate it. You don't want to throw something out there

[01:17:29] for that long. I guess it's part of what I do. Shout out to those people and a big thank you for

[01:17:38] the support. Shout out to my brothers in Pinball, Mr. Jeremy, Zambi Yeti, and Dirty Duny,

[01:17:45] as people call us, the trifecta of Stern Pinball art. Right. And to you, I suppose,

[01:17:53] having me on for thank you. And one final question as a DC guy. Yes. Did you see Justice League yet?

[01:18:02] I did not because I tend to avoid the crowds. Well, you should also avoid the movie. It's hard.

[01:18:11] DC, I mean, something's got to get things back on track. Yeah, that's another thing. I'm not really

[01:18:18] too excited to see it. I'm a huge Batman fan, but the whole thing looks so gloomy. And you know,

[01:18:24] I just don't know the whole, you know, what's it does? Gray color palette. That's Batman's world.

[01:18:28] Not everybody's world. Right. Batman's world. They made Superman dark. They ruined his entire

[01:18:34] universe. Like Metropolis is happy, go lucky. And that's what makes it interesting when it collides

[01:18:38] with the darkness of Gotham. But now it's all just dark, psychoanalytical. Yeah. Yeah. So, I

[01:18:45] don't know, I've heard some good reviews. I know there's a lot of stink reviews. I know it's doing

[01:18:48] like shit on the rotten tomatoes, but I'm still going to go see it. I just, I prefer to go see it

[01:18:54] when there's, you know, 20 people on theater rather than 200 because everyone's, yeah,

[01:18:59] fun and cell phones are going off. Right. People are screaming at the screen. And I just want to

[01:19:04] put my feet up on the seat in front of me and take it all in. So I'll win a week or so. Okay.

[01:19:09] Well, we'll talk offline about if you liked it or not. I thought it was horrible. But anyway,

[01:19:15] Chris, thank you for joining us. We'll talk soon and everyone. If you haven't checked, I mean,

[01:19:20] everyone's checked out Guardians and you've seen the gameplay footage. Now I encourage everyone to

[01:19:24] go play the game in the next few weeks and your friends will probably have it soon. So,

[01:19:28] congrats to Stern and to Christopher Franci and John Borg and Lonnie for getting a game out.

[01:19:34] And, you know, it's 2017 and we're all enjoying pinball. That's a miracle. This, this device should

[01:19:41] be obsolete by now, but it is not because of gentlemen like Mr. Franci. So thank you, Chris.

[01:19:46] You got it. Thank you, sir. All right.

[01:19:59] Oh, I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do.

[01:20:04] Cause I'm tell you to let you down.
