[00:00] We're running with the shadows all the night

[00:04] So baby take my hand to be alright

[00:08] Surrender all your dreams to me tonight

[00:12] They'll come true in the air

[00:23] Welcome, it's Saturday night

[00:25] Conor McGregor is gonna fight tonight and I spent a good hour to an hour and a half this morning playing

[00:34] Pimball in New York City at modern Pimball because I saw on Facebook that they actually have modern Pimballs now at modern Pimball

[00:44] They've got a Deadpool they've got a Guardians of the Galaxy they've got an

[00:49] Aerosmith they've got a walking dead they have a missing one of the new ones in iron maiden so I'm gonna talk about

[00:58] my

[00:59] Thoughts on the latest games from Stern Pimball and and I want to be honest on this podcast

[01:06] Do I ever do I ever not tell you the truth about Pimball?

[01:10] Before we go there though we have a few news items I want to talk about on this episode of

[01:15] Canada's Pimball podcast so news item number one

[01:19] Brian Allen you might remember Brian Allen because he is the gentleman that Andrew highway hired

[01:27] To upstage oric loss in and make the alien

[01:32] Ellie back glass image for highway Pimball. Do you remember that fiasco?

[01:37] Went on alien day Andrew revealed the new artwork for alien Ellie and it was a hand drawn artist by the name of

[01:44] Brian Allen and it was really nice artwork well

[01:48] It just so happens that Brian Allen on his Facebook page revealed a

[01:54] Pimball machine project that he was working on that never saw the light of day and that project and the image he revealed

[02:04] comes from queen and it's on his Facebook page his

[02:09] His Facebook handles you know what I'm gonna upload this image as the image for my podcast

[02:14] So you'll be able to see it there

[02:16] But I want to read what he writes he writes this clean illustration

[02:20] I created for an official clean Pimball machine was for something big that almost happened

[02:25] But ultimately fell apart when you've been freelancing for as long as I have you start to accumulate a big pile of

[02:33] Almost it's best not to let those way you down

[02:38] Just keep going and making art every day focus on the projects you do get and don't let the failures overshadow your success

[02:47] All right, so in this image

[02:50] It is really like almost as if

[02:53] Andrew highway told Brian Allen to copy

[02:57] Dirty Donnie or sort of like create a combination of zombie Yeti and dirty Donnie

[03:03] Almost like Brian Allen was becoming his very own

[03:07] Zombie

[03:09] You know zombie Donnie or dirty Yeti whatever way you want to spin the two together

[03:15] I don't like this image at all

[03:19] I don't even think and I ran this by a few other artists out there in the Pimball world

[03:23] And I also heard that this would probably never have been approved by Queen if they saw this I mean Freddie Mercury

[03:31] Looks like a donkey in this image

[03:36] Brian made they both look really weird. I mean I don't know

[03:40] I don't know I think this would have been a huge huge miss and Andrew highway

[03:45] Again once again had no idea what he was really doing

[03:49] He was just trying to follow in the footsteps of things that Stern was doing at the time but ultimately

[03:56] Ultimately, it's probably best that this did not see the light of day now

[04:00] The question still remains are the Pimball brothers the people were whatever the company is the Pimball people that

[04:08] failed to reboot highway they went off and

[04:12] The rumor was they were gonna make the Queen Pimball machine, but we haven't heard anything

[04:19] From these gentlemen since they fold it highway Pimball

[04:23] You know how I feel about the whole venture

[04:26] Nobody is gonna go into support these guys because they basically

[04:31] Cannot release a new game

[04:35] With so many people

[04:37] losing thousands of dollars

[04:39] In highway Pimball and you have to factor in that they had to have used

[04:45] Some of that highway money to restart their new ventures

[04:49] So I just think we're never gonna see a Queen Pimball machine or hear from these gentlemen again

[04:55] All right, what else is going on in the Pimball world? So

[04:59] If you go into the home pin thread on pin side it is amazing. It is amazing how

[05:07] Mike continues continues to battle it out

[05:12] With the very people who are

[05:15] Buying his games and someone had bought a

[05:19] Thunderbirds and they posted on pin side that they were having issues with it

[05:25] Something broke there was some bracket that

[05:28] Broke apart and they went on first to say like they couldn't get in touch with Joe new heart

[05:34] I recommend you read the thread because it was kind of awesome how Joe came back and just bitch slapped this guy

[05:41] Basically saying like yo bro like you didn't buy your game from me

[05:45] You bought your game from someone I sold it to so I have no record of you buying jack shit

[05:52] So when you leave me a voicemail crying like a little baby. I have no idea who you are

[05:58] I also think it's funny watching

[06:02] Wayne and

[06:04] and

[06:05] Mike battle it out. I mean if you thought sort of

[06:10] I'm trying to think like Donald and Hillary if you thought any of the political

[06:17] Shit going on in the world was heated debate you should go read

[06:21] Wayne versus Mike it Wayne from

[06:25] Wayne is the Australian distributor out there and Mike is also from Australia and these guys pretty much they like

[06:34] Legitimately I think on a very carnal level

[06:37] Absolutely hate each other all right. I want to read this. This is too funny. Um, so

[06:44] Home pin rights Wayne the factory and the local distributors and the worldwide distributors are on the issues that have arisen

[06:53] Mostly due to transit damage all parts required have been shipped out and some others will be as soon as we advise of what is needed

[07:01] The home pin team deal with customer issues directly with them not via social media or public forums

[07:08] Do you own a tag and need some assistance?

[07:11] No, I thought not so how about you stop trying to stir up trouble if you achieve your aim of putting home pin out of business

[07:19] How will that help owners? I seriously do not know what your beef is with home pin me

[07:24] But how about you just give it a rest go back to making your own machine

[07:28] Wait, you already found out how hard that is and you were copying an existing machine and using all existing mechanisms

[07:35] Not designing and building one from the ground up

[07:39] all right then

[07:41] Then Wayne chimes in with the following and this is good. I mean this this is like pure

[07:48] Unfiltered just like

[07:51] Bitch slapping so Wayne writes the only person copying anything is you you copied Valley Williams parts

[07:59] Photos of Valley Williams parts and you taking measurements. I didn't copy anything

[08:04] I had all original parts. I have built original games and authorized thousands more

[08:09] You have no idea what rights I retained in the assignment

[08:13] You didn't design anything you copied most from other manufacturers even dad at East pop bumpers

[08:20] And Ben hex boards we have problems with every

[08:23] Hankin table we sold god help distributors with this machine

[08:27] I don't want you out of business. I want you to build the machines you owe people

[08:33] But at PINFEST you were overheard saying you need another

[08:37] 1.5 million to get another factory and more staff and only had parts for 50 games and

[08:45] Once returned to China you would need to order more

[08:48] You need to shut your mouth stay in China and get out what you have already paid for in full

[08:56] Stop spending money that's not yours on flying around the world with two to three people promoting something that needs

[09:03] Quality control and rust and metal fatigue spooky can do it. Why can't you?

[09:08] Oh, this is great, right then Mike responds every bit of your posts is incorrect misleading

[09:15] 100% out of context or just plain wrong

[09:18] No wonder all manufacturers avoid public forums. It just doesn't go anywhere

[09:23] Well, we know that Mike is lying about some of that part being all incorrect

[09:29] We know that he copied the Ben Heck boards. How do we know that because Ben Heck told us himself

[09:36] All right, and if people are buying home PINs games and they're breaking

[09:41] Then those people's claims are totally legitimate

[09:45] All right, so the real question is this is Mike Adam money

[09:48] Is that accusation of him needing 1.5 million dollars to stay in business?

[09:56] Accurate and that he only has enough to build 50 games doesn't this sound

[10:03] EARLY

[10:05] EARLY similar to Andrew highway and highway PINBALL in how

[10:10] Andrew only had enough alien parts to build a small number of them and he could not afford

[10:17] To order more parts because he was out of money and here we go all over again

[10:24] It's the same thing if you build a PINBALL factory and your first game is a piece of shit

[10:33] You will go out of business

[10:36] Midway through your second game or even midway through your inaugural games

[10:44] Manufacturing you will it happened to Andrew and you highway went out of business

[10:50] Because full throttle was a piece of shit and nobody wanted it

[10:55] That is why he announced alien immediately

[10:59] Years before he was even ready to make it he announced it

[11:03] You know why he announced it because he needed money all right

[11:07] It would have been like Dutch PINBALL

[11:10] Announcing that they were gonna make back to the future PINBALL in the middle of their big Lebowski debacle

[11:17] And then all this back to the future money comes in and it you know it saves them some time

[11:23] But that's all it does is buy them time all right, so I fully expect

[11:29] Home PIN I expect home PIN to go out of business not not because I know the finances of the company

[11:36] I expect home PIN to come out of bit go out of business because Mike is probably the worst salesman and

[11:43] Builds the worst relationship between the PINBALL community and his company. So there's that he's absolutely

[11:50] You know shot himself in the foot and then the final product after all these years remember Thunderbirds four or five years in the making

[11:57] At five thousand dollars

[12:00] Thunderbirds even at that cheap cheap price point still still is getting nothing

[12:07] But terrible reviews from people so the word of mouth on the game is

[12:13] Completely negative and so for those two reasons and those two reasons alone

[12:18] I don't care if Mike says he's got two to three more games ready to go

[12:22] Anybody anybody can design a PINBALL machine on a piece of paper

[12:27] Anybody can do that do you have the money to fulfill the orders that people placed for your product do you have the money

[12:35] To stand behind the games you're selling if you go read the Thunderbirds warranty

[12:40] It's really interesting because in their warranty

[12:43] They don't really cover much they really don't cover much and you have to pay as the customer

[12:49] You have to pay for shipping and handling of anything that goes wrong with your machine

[12:55] So when they need to send something new to you

[12:58] Shipping and handling is not covered by home pin and guess what it's not cheap or is it fun to ship stuff to China

[13:07] So on canators pinball podcasts mark my words. I think we will see

[13:14] Home pin out of the pinball game by 20 you know within 2019

[13:19] I was right when I called the highway and Dutch is departure in 2018

[13:24] These guys I don't think they're gonna make it all right

[13:27] So speaking about companies making it. I know I've been sort of down and out on

[13:32] American pinball at times and their choice of octoberfest as a title

[13:36] I want you guys to know that I got a really nice message from Nirmal

[13:40] The sales and marketing guy over at American pinball and I hope to have a chat with him soon

[13:46] I even hope to talk with him off the record

[13:49] Because there's some things he wanted to discuss when it comes to some future plans at American pinball

[13:55] So I'm excited. I'm excited. I will always and and don't

[13:59] Mistake me for a bad guy

[14:01] Because I will always

[14:03] Lend my marketing advice and counsel to any pinball company that

[14:09] Asked me for it. There's only been one pinball company that asked me for my advice and that was

[14:16] Team pinball the mafia game people and they were really nice

[14:20] They came to me and they showed me what they created. They showed me how much money they were gonna charge

[14:25] And I pretty much told them flat out. It's not gonna work

[14:29] No one's gonna buy this game at this price

[14:32] You're kind of dead on arrival

[14:34] But I think American pinball is finding themselves in an interesting position because they have manufacturing capabilities

[14:41] There's a world out there of a lot of different home brew

[14:46] Projects that could see the light of day now. I think if they pick the right ones and they they they're smart

[14:52] They have seen what spooky did with TNA. Let's not fool ourselves people

[14:58] The best spooky pinball game ever made isn't even a spooky pinball game

[15:03] Okay, the best spooky pinball game ever made was made by someone outside the company in his basement in his own time

[15:10] And and it out has outsold all the other spooky games, right?

[15:15] Outsold them all 500 of them. So that's more of that game than America's most haunted and rob zombie

[15:23] Okay, and I and I and I get I think Charlie is overreaching with 500

[15:28] Alice Cooper Nightmare castles. I'm gonna tell you right now the reviews for Alice Cooper's Nightmare castle

[15:34] Will not be as good as the reviews for total nuclear annihilation. I think Chuck knows this

[15:40] I just think he kind of once again

[15:43] You know, it's like just when you don't get the design right

[15:48] You it doesn't matter what else you do it really doesn't all right. Let's go on

[15:53] Um to some other news, but I look forward to talking to the American pinball people about what's going on

[15:58] So here's here's a here's a like are you kidding me sort of it's funny. It's hilarious

[16:03] But it also is so foolish yet it makes me laugh. So Jersey Jack pinball

[16:08] Where are the pirates of the Caribbean's where are they are they are they are they shipping

[16:13] Are they going out like it's October there are no us customers playing the game

[16:19] hardly any some distributors have it

[16:21] But for the most part all the games that we see on the line

[16:24] Who knows where they're headed, but they're not going into consumer homes. So Jersey Jack

[16:29] He made a video for a pinball collector that I know his name's Eric Katz

[16:33] Eric's a funny guy. I think he's got a disease. He buys pinball machines like he buys bagels every weekend for breakfast

[16:41] And it's just like every new game. He's always in the market for it

[16:45] Okay, but here's the funny part. He ordered pirates of the Caribbean one year ago

[16:49] He I think he paid in full a year ago for the game after they revealed it at Expo

[16:55] All right, so he's been waiting a year and so of course anyone who bought the game 12 months ago is impatient and wants their game

[17:02] So Jersey Jack puts up a video on Facebook. You can go see it

[17:07] I think it was on pinball stars page or I think even Jersey Jack's page as well

[17:11] And he says I you know

[17:13] This video is for you Eric Katz

[17:15] I'm making your pirate to the Caribbean and I'm actually I'm standing next to your pirate to the Caribbean right now

[17:22] Okay, and we see Jack in the assembly line. There's only one problem with Jack's video

[17:28] Is all the games that he's standing next to only have one coin slot?

[17:36] So those games are going to Europe which means Jack was effing lion now and look is it a white lie? Does it matter?

[17:45] I'm just saying it's just where the where are the pirates the Caribbean games?

[17:49] Can we get them can we get Alice Cooper's nightmare castles out the door? Where are these games?

[17:56] It is amazing. I can't believe we still don't have Alice Cooper a pirate to the Caribbean's being unboxed left and right

[18:03] They're coming. I don't think anyone is not gonna get their game

[18:07] But it's just comical how long it's taken all right

[18:11] Anything else going on in the pinball world that I've missed

[18:14] um pinball expo

[18:17] So I know on my last podcast. I got very sort of you know like what's the point of going to expo and I have to say

[18:25] I was hit up

[18:27] by a friend of the show a friend of mine

[18:31] He has an awesome podcast. It's called special when lit and we were talking and he's like come on man

[18:39] And you know who this guy is Ken Cromwell can thanks for reaching out and he's like Chris

[18:44] Like I get it that expo has like sucked in the past but when you look at expo this year

[18:52] We're gonna have two reveals monster bash and october fest

[18:56] We're gonna have j pop back in the pinball scene

[19:01] We're gonna have stern and all their people there that if you actually look at what's gonna happen at expo

[19:07] It in context of other expos

[19:10] It's gonna be a good show and the more I thought about it

[19:15] The more I thought he was right and I do agree that this is gonna be a better expo

[19:21] Then years passed and I think people are going to see some new games for the first time

[19:28] But but Ken my my only pushback

[19:31] It's really just one reveal can you really consider monster bash remake to be a reveal

[19:38] Can you consider the pinball mafia gamer that game shouldn't be revealed it it should in it should it

[19:45] I'll stop there

[19:47] And I don't think stern's gonna show anything new in monsters so

[19:51] But october fest is an interesting one you know

[19:54] I'm curious to see if we get a fully art packaged october fest

[20:00] Or if we get the white wood of october fest

[20:04] I don't know how far along this game is I would never reveal a game as a white wood

[20:09] So hopefully it's got all the art and bells and whistles on it all right. Sorry guys. Saturday night

[20:15] All right, let me talk about deadpool and my experience with the game today

[20:22] And on this podcast and I hear it from people you know I talk about

[20:25] Collectors and buying games and where you should spend your money

[20:29] What I don't talk about a lot is actually playing pinball

[20:34] Partly because there are so many podcasts out there in youtube channels that I think do an incredible job

[20:42] Providing you with gameplay reviews and videos and tutorials of pinball machines

[20:50] It is not because I suck at pinball and I don't want to jump on a machine

[20:54] I actually just uploaded a video to facebook today

[20:57] Tonight I finally got to the holy batman multi ball on my batman 66

[21:03] Where you have to complete all of three minor villain modes or seasons and that unlocks that mode

[21:11] Super fun super awesome Brenda recorded it. I'm not as bad as you think at pinball

[21:18] So I went down to modern pinball today and I wanted to play deadpool the most and they had deadpool

[21:24] Galaxy a gardens of the galaxy

[21:27] Iron made in an eros myth where the ones you know the ones that was most interested in were the two newest turns which were iron made in

[21:35] And deadpool and I really wanted to spend as much time as I could on both those machines

[21:40] So I played them for about an hour and they were both pro versions of the machines and I want to give you my

[21:48] Feelings after playing both those games. I also want to talk a little bit

[21:53] About how challenging it is to just review pinball in general and

[21:59] You know there's about 30 40 machines at modern pinball

[22:03] And all of them aren't various states of you know some are some have been around for years some are brand new

[22:10] And when you play pinball it's really hard to get a machine

[22:15] Working 100% because once you're on location and we know stuff happens

[22:19] But I'll say this deadpool and iron made in at modern pinball. They felt brand new

[22:24] So I want to I want to talk about those two games

[22:27] And you know here's how I just want to rip the bandaid off

[22:31] And I want to say that after spending a lot of time on deadpool

[22:36] I just don't understand

[22:39] Why people in this hobby are buying these games. I really don't it's not because it's not like

[22:46] Fun on a pinball level

[22:49] But the lack of stuff in this game

[22:52] Just it's just mind boggling to me that's that people are paying

[22:57] 9,000 dollars for deadpool LEDs

[23:02] When there's just so little in the game

[23:05] It's it's like I literally I can't get over it anymore. I really can't get over

[23:11] Where I think Stern is now at with pinball and I really do I think it's at a level now

[23:17] Where they literally are it's like you're playing a movie poster of deadpool

[23:23] With a few things here and there to do but like there's like there's like zero toys in the game

[23:30] I mean is is the ball lock on the sword consider a toy. I mean there's really not much to hit in the game

[23:39] and I just couldn't help but feel

[23:43] Like this is just I'm just sort of I've given up being excited

[23:50] About these modern Sterns because I just don't see

[23:55] the like any any ambition in these titles anymore at all

[24:00] I really don't I really do I think they've like fallen back

[24:05] On the screen and on the artwork and and especially in deadpool. It's like it's like zombie hidey's art

[24:11] It is amazing, but it's like there's just like so much in this like open play field and I don't know

[24:18] Like do you ever see the ball do anything interesting in deadpool and I have to say like the right orbit shot

[24:25] That's supposed to lock the ball on the sword um, you know the sword habit trail or sword, you know ramp um

[24:34] It it worked like maybe half the time

[24:38] um, you know, but again like it's a cool shot don't get me wrong like it's an interesting shot, but it's not

[24:45] Nearly it's not nearly as satisfying as locking

[24:49] Uh the backhanded shot in Lord the Rings, you know, it's just up, you know, locking on air going sword

[24:55] And there's just I you know, there's there's a disconnect happening now for me too

[25:00] There really is there's just a disconnect between

[25:03] The screen and the gameplay. I just feel like things are just becoming non-sequitor in these Stern games like the I don't know like

[25:13] What world I'm supposed to be paying attention to now anymore either with some of these games like there's all this art

[25:20] But then you're like in deadpools den and you know, he's

[25:24] You're then you just start a mode in your battling people

[25:28] But like you're not really looking up when you're battling people you're the whole time you're looking down

[25:32] And so you're really just you know, you're hitting shots, but I think deep down

[25:38] I just felt like none of these shots are like that rewarding

[25:43] And this would get really old really fast and but then I then I see people on

[25:50] Pinside like saying this game is amazing and saying like how incredible it is and saying how beautiful the Ellie is

[25:58] And how Deadpool is putting iron made into shame and and this is their new favorite pin in the house and the kids are playing nothing

[26:05] But Deadpool and I walked away from the machine and I really just sort of shrugged my shoulders and and was just kind of like

[26:13] I don't really know what you want in this hobby anymore

[26:18] I don't know what compels people to buy these games anymore. I really don't I really think

[26:24] People's expectations and what it takes to get people to buy a pinball machine nowadays is so low

[26:33] That it's it's it's almost like

[26:36] Why would Stern put more into these games? Why would Stern make these games more complex and more mechanically interesting

[26:45] When you're buying this literally this like there is no way that Stern could turn that

[26:52] Deadpool pro into something that would be worth $9,000

[26:58] I'm just sorry there's like there's no other there's not really much else in it. There's like a diverter a

[27:05] A a a little disco ball that a light shines on and and what else like

[27:12] And then just drop targets on the left and right. I mean I I'm not understanding

[27:18] Why we are now running to some of these games. I mean I guess I know why is because nothing else is ever available

[27:28] And a lot of you guys have a lot of money and you get bored of games

[27:32] But I literally don't understand

[27:36] What you saw when you jumped on a Deadpool that made you say like this game is great

[27:42] I'm gonna spend between 5,500 and nine thousand dollars on this

[27:48] Please will somebody like email me at canada pinballadgemail.com

[27:54] Will somebody come on the show who has a Deadpool and explain to me

[27:59] Why you were impressed by this game what about this game made you say take my money now

[28:09] I really would love to know okay, so that being said

[28:14] I kind of walked away from the game just feeling like it's just another like

[28:19] Basic stern like it to the point now to where I don't know about you guys

[28:25] But I'm also getting desensitized to the artwork. I really don't care

[28:30] About all the levels of detail that like zombie Yeti puts into the game anymore because if the game's not magical

[28:38] And the game doesn't have a lot of great stuff going on

[28:42] Who cares that there was like just art sitting there not doing anything

[28:47] You know, I I think art is the final icing on the cake of an incredible design and incredible layout of incredible toys incredible

[28:57] Mechs

[28:57] But when the focus is so much on just like this wide open artistic play field

[29:04] I it bores me it doesn't make me excited. It really doesn't

[29:10] Um, I'm sorry, but it's like so one dimensional too like it's not exciting

[29:15] You know and and so then I went and I played iron maiden now iron maiden is a game that I know a lot of you love

[29:25] I know it's a game that's very polarizing

[29:27] I know it's a game where like if you don't like iron maiden music

[29:30] It's probably a hard game to own and I'd played iron maiden a few times and and I have to say like

[29:37] Going from Deadpool to iron maiden

[29:41] Was was really eye opening really really eye opening because I've been hearing people say on pin side

[29:48] That they consider Deadpool to be way more fun than iron maiden and they also like

[29:54] You know in their house in their home collection deadpools getting all the plays and iron maiden's not and again

[30:00] I think the Deadpool theme for a lot of people is a lot more appealing than iron maiden if you're not an iron maiden fan

[30:07] But here's the thing here's the thing the layout and the design of iron maiden is

[30:14] World's and leagues

[30:17] Above Deadpool

[30:19] I just think the design on maiden is so much more interesting and and what's going on in the game

[30:26] It is a lot more unique and an unprecedented and never been done before with like the shots like it just feels like a very

[30:34] original designed game

[30:36] And it feels like everything is there for purpose. It just it doesn't feel like stuff was just stuck there

[30:42] Like when I played Deadpool all the shots to like the left side of the game

[30:46] They just they just feel like they're stuck there

[30:48] There's like no rhyme or reason to most of it. It just feels like all right. Well, we got some room here

[30:53] So let's put this little loop here. Let's put a scoop here. Let's but it just doesn't feel

[30:58] Like that interesting like they couldn't put like a chimichanga truck that where the doors open up at the back

[31:03] And you shoot the ball in and that's how it locks and the doors open up and the balls come out

[31:07] You know, I just again like there's just like so little in it

[31:10] And then made in to me is like one of the most incredible like designs that we've seen in a long time

[31:16] And I think people will echo that sentiment. It's a really fun game to shoot. It's really uh, you know

[31:24] You can get into this rhythm where you're hitting the loops and I was hitting the loops and you know

[31:29] You got the center ramp and you're you're locking the ball and you're it's kind of intuitive what to do

[31:36] And and I like that about iron maiden

[31:38] I do think my problem with maiden is what's going on on the screen again

[31:44] It just feels so like non-sequitored or what's happening in the game

[31:49] Even even down to like the the art style on the LCD is so much different than the art style in the game

[31:56] And I'm never really sure what to do in the game. I mean I have a big problem with a lot of new pinball games

[32:00] It's like when you walk up to all these games

[32:03] It's not very intuitive what to do on any of them and so you know

[32:09] That's always an issue that I have but I'll say this

[32:13] I think iron maiden would have been one of the greatest games ever what's lacking in it and again

[32:19] It's got almost everything

[32:22] It just needs like a toy or two. I mean the game just needs a toy or two

[32:27] There's just there's nothing in it very much like Deadpool

[32:31] There's no moment

[32:33] Where you see that toy do that thing or the ball goes into that area and then something happens

[32:38] There's just something you wish more in maiden like it just needs like a bash toy

[32:44] It needs something that just makes it come alive a little bit more

[32:50] Something that just has more you know like nothing moves really on the playful

[32:55] I know on the LEDs and the premiums and sorry

[32:57] Coppigus like has some movement where it locks but you know you're in a pinball machine like there's this world below you

[33:04] And what you can't make something swoop from left to right you can't make a ball move from left to right with magnets

[33:11] You can't have like something happening that just

[33:16] feels

[33:17] fun you know and and and and again like

[33:21] That's my takeaway

[33:23] Of like these two machines. I think stern pinball is at a place now where

[33:29] The only thing I want to see them do next the only thing and I hope we see this in the monsters

[33:37] Is I hope we see some mechanical magic make its way back into these games. I mean it's not just me saying this

[33:47] It looks these games are starting to look embarrassingly empty and they're nine thousand dollars

[33:56] I mean it is unbelievable that you could put a pirate to the Caribbean next to a deadpool le and they're the same price

[34:09] And it leads me it's this is why like I walked home with my shoulders shrugged

[34:14] And I'm like I don't even understand this hobby anymore

[34:17] Are people just this stupid and they'll just buy stuff that just like

[34:23] Like I I don't get you I and when I say you I mean you the listener

[34:29] Who runs after all of these new games

[34:33] Like why are we

[34:35] Supporting and why are we giving our hard earned money to companies that aren't doing anything

[34:43] ambitious or really creative

[34:46] We it leads me almost to believe that we should support

[34:51] The alternative to the company that just feels like you know, they're not making things

[34:58] Uh that are like that innovative and look it's hard for me to like say this because it feels like I'm bashing stern

[35:05] Doesn't it it does and I want to play devil's advocate to my own points

[35:12] Is that stern pinball sells thousands of pinball machines a year around the world

[35:18] They bring some of the most incredible themes in pinball

[35:22] Into people's homes into barcades and into countries

[35:26] Around the world and they do it consistently

[35:30] And to do that to keep pinball alive in 2018

[35:35] They've had to you know scale back on a lot of the stuff that breaks and is difficult and expensive and they needed to make pinball machines

[35:46] Much more feasible and profitable to do what they do because if stern win away pinball pretty much goes away

[35:53] It they would it's like the Titanic sinking everyone else is in these little rinky dink robots around the big ship when the big ship sinks

[36:02] You know, it creates that suction in the ocean and everything gets sucked down with it

[36:07] And that's what would happen if stern collapse so the devil's advocate in me is like well, Chris give them a break

[36:13] They're doing what no one else can even attempt to do you know jersey jack can't even get one game built

[36:21] He showed it a year ago, and he still can't get it built and sent out in volume

[36:26] Spooky pinball is not trying to do anything in volume

[36:28] It's spooky doesn't really count in the conversation

[36:31] Nobody the only other people that are like gonna be able to give you magical pins

[36:35] You know they went under highway went under dutch went under

[36:38] You know what american pinball hasn't delivered like the game yet that everyone wants

[36:43] Hopefully they get there jersey jack same thing they haven't really delivered the magic that everyone wants from them

[36:49] So stern's really it

[36:52] And they don't really have to do much more

[36:55] Because no one else has an alternative

[36:58] So that's where I think the hobby's at

[37:01] And I think it's in a I think it's in a weird place like you could look at it like this is the golden age of pinball

[37:07] But I look at it like I don't know like it's the it's the golden age for stern

[37:12] Do you really think these machines are costing stern that much money per machine

[37:19] Stern is making a fortune on premiums and le's now

[37:24] I mean these games now these the pros look like they have less in it

[37:30] Then stern games had in them

[37:33] In 2008

[37:35] 10 years ago stern games had way more in them and we're like 35 hundred dollars. I bet you

[37:41] A stern pro is costing stern somewhere like

[37:45] 2500 dollars to make I or three thousand dollars

[37:49] I would love for them to give a specifics, but I bet you

[37:53] They're making a killing on these games and then meanwhile

[37:58] Everyone else like Charlie and American pinball and Jersey jack they can barely make 500 to a thousand dollars a game

[38:07] And stern's probably making thousands a game

[38:11] And selling thousands of them so it's very very good for them

[38:16] But I think it's not very very good

[38:20] In terms of if we're if we're all the stop

[38:23] And we were to like fast forward 20 years and you look back at these games

[38:28] I just the I just here's here's my wish

[38:31] I just want every new stern to be the best game

[38:35] That they've ever made. I wanted to be like Porsche the way every new car is everything they know to date

[38:42] And they put it into each new 9-11 and so each new 9-11 is better than the one before it

[38:49] And when you look at stern pinball games can you honestly say that every new game

[38:54] Feels like a step forward above the games before it

[38:58] No, it doesn't feel anything like that and I know there's different designers

[39:03] But even so do you feel like Steve Richie's games at stern are they just keep getting better? No

[39:10] They keep getting worse

[39:11] Right George Gomez's games do they keep getting better? Do you know you think Deadpool is better than Lord of the Rings

[39:18] Then monster bash right? I mean

[39:22] Batman 66 is like combination of two games at least they put innovation in the Batman

[39:28] All right, so that's my point is we're at this place now where I don't know

[39:33] I'm like not that excited. I'm only excited. I'm telling you this. I'm being truthful

[39:40] I'm really only excited in the next like six months

[39:45] To see what deeproot does because I just think like look watch it

[39:49] Monsters is gonna come out and if you think it's not gonna look like every other stern with a lower playfield

[39:54] It's gonna have all this magical stuff like I hope it does don't get me wrong

[39:59] I hope it does but what leads you to believe it will

[40:04] Really what leads you to believe it will?

[40:07] Like beetles re-skinned

[40:10] Sea witch they're going to take

[40:13] Something that is not even original and start to charge you like $10,000 for it. There's probably so little

[40:22] R&D time that has to go into a re-skin

[40:26] Versus a blank slate and yet you'll probably buy it and the more I see people buying these games

[40:34] The more I just walk away shrugged my shoulders and say you know what

[40:38] You could just put like

[40:40] sexy art some blanking lights

[40:43] And some stuff on a screen and charge $9,000 and say you're only gonna make 400 of them and people will buy it and that's pinball

[40:51] That's pinball

[40:52] But the door is open

[40:55] Are you listening deeproot? Are you listening American pinball? Are you listening Jersey Jack?

[41:02] Are you listening Chicago gaming company?

[41:05] Are you listening the door

[41:09] To Stern's vulnerability

[41:13] It's kind of open even as I'm about to say it. I'm like well

[41:16] Nobody's gonna be able to manufacture at the volume because everyone else would sink so let's say like

[41:22] Deeproot makes the most amazing back to the future game and like 5,000 orders flying from around the world

[41:29] How are they ever gonna make 5,000 pinball games?

[41:32] Same as true with American pinball. That's the problem. Oh, it sucks

[41:37] It sucks. Why can't you just make better games Stern?

[41:41] Why you've got the manufacturing down to a fucking science

[41:47] But why can't that army of people making these games? Why can't you give your

[41:51] designers more bomb? Why can't you do it? I bet there are so many arguments at Stern pinball

[41:59] Between the designers and the the financial dudes

[42:03] I bet there are so many creative disputes because you can't tell me that Steve Richie's happy with the way Star Wars

[42:11] Looked in the end you can't tell me like Borg is happy with the way Guardians of the galaxy is when he thought he was designing another game

[42:18] Then you flip it on him. You can't tell me

[42:21] Elwin was happy that you yanked out toys from archer. You can't tell me that these designers can't go further

[42:28] When you've got a humongous company that can R&D almost anybody's creative idea into something real

[42:36] You can't tell me that they're happy with where these games are netting out and Stern

[42:41] I'll tell you this right now. I don't mind spending 9 to 15,000 dollars on a Stern game

[42:47] But just make it fucking worth it

[42:50] Make it fucking worth it art and trim and toppers bunch of bullshit and jack

[42:58] Jersey jack. I love you brother. Stop fucking shooting your feet off with every game

[43:06] Fucking get it right

[43:08] You have so much more time to focus on just one title and it's almost like you find new ways to

[43:18] fucking fuck it up

[43:20] Stop

[43:22] Make Willy Wonka and Toy Story

[43:25] And Guns and Roses fucking amazing and make them fucking standard size cabinets jack for fucksakes

[43:34] Stop

[43:35] All right

[43:37] Everyone

[43:38] Have a good weekend

[43:40] But do me a favor take a take a long look in the mirror

[43:45] If you bought a Deadpool or Deadpool Ellie take a long look in the mirror

[43:49] If you're a guy that buys like two new unbox games a year

[43:53] Take a take a deep look in the mirror

[43:56] Look into your own eyes and say to yourself

[44:01] What the fuck is wrong with you?

[44:03] Why are you buying these games so quickly

[44:07] When there's like when there are most of them are going in the wrong direction

[44:12] You know someone put up a a tails of the Arabian Knights

[44:15] Hepp restart for 11,000 dollars and it's sold immediately

[44:19] So go tell me that toad in is a stupid boring game that no one wants to play her own

[44:23] People wouldn't if if Stern

[44:26] Code it toad in if if lineman sheets

[44:29] Coded tails of the Arabian Knights

[44:32] It would be the greatest pinball machine of all time

[44:35] Barnum I think toadans got a more interesting layup than Adam's family and a lot of other games

[44:40] I think it's the greatest like design one of the greatest designs ever

[44:43] If lineman sheets coded it

[44:45] Let's talk let's talk about it all right. Let's talk about that all right all right

[44:51] That's what you want

[44:52] My last point then let you go the most fun I had today at modern pinball and I went to dialed in

[44:58] I went toadans family. I went all over the horn. I went all the sterns. They even have will fortune

[45:04] I had so much fun

[45:06] You know me. I love the world under glass. I had so much fun playing

[45:11] Star Trek the next generation

[45:14] Can we talk about holy fuck world under glass so much in that game

[45:20] Callouts from the actors what I love about Star Trek is they had to bring the Star Trek world to life

[45:27] And they had just a little DMD right they didn't they didn't have the ability to show clips from all the shows and the movies and everything was happening below you

[45:35] But that game with the fucking like the the looping ramp and the and like the

[45:42] The two cannon shots on you know above the flippers

[45:47] That you know you've got like for you. Yeah, like for flippers in that game. It's fucking incredible

[45:53] Incredible imagine lineman sheets coding that game

[45:58] Right then you walk over to stern star Trek. I mean are you fucking kidding me? And here's a crazy part

[46:03] People spend more money people pay more money

[46:07] For Star Trek Ellie by stern then then then a good condition star trek the next generation

[46:13] I mean fuck fuck me fuck us you got everyone like what are we fucking doing

[46:19] What are we doing put the world back under that fucking glass and make it magical

[46:25] I want to see the ball do cool shit. I don't care about scoring in tournaments and all that garbage

[46:32] That is ruined pinball

[46:34] Make the game fun

[46:37] Make it fun to get through the modes and the chapters to get to the final battle

[46:41] That's all I care about I don't give a shit about my scoring Batman

[46:44] I've got goals that I want to achieve and that's when pinball becomes great. All right
