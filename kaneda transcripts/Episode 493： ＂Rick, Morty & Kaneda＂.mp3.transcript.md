[00:00] Yeah, I know it's stupid, but you've got to see it from the film.

[00:08] I'm in Bokona watching your kids, huh?

[00:12] Oh!

[00:14] Settler, settler, settler, settler, settler, settler, settler!

[00:18] All right, well, Kaneda has a pinball machine again, and so I guess we're now a valid pinball

[00:25] podcast, so no one can ever accuse me of not owning a pinball machine, so I'm staring right

[00:30] now in my bedroom.

[00:31] At one of the most gorgeous, gorgeous cabinets I've ever looked at in pinball, and that

[00:37] is the butter cabinet of Rick and Morty Pinball.

[00:40] So yesterday at 8.30 in the morning, I got the phone call that FedEx was downstairs already,

[00:46] so much for the 20 to half hour minute warning before they would arrive.

[00:51] And so I went down, I got the game from the FedEx guys, they put it in the basement, and

[00:56] then the journey to get the game into Kaneda's bedroom began.

[01:00] I'm going to walk you through that real quickly, so if you don't know, old men had an apartment.

[01:06] They were not built or engineered to have coin op devices dragged through them.

[01:12] So the door openings in my apartment are as follows.

[01:16] The front door, I think is something like 29 inches, maybe 28 and a half inches, and

[01:24] then my bedroom door is 28 and a half.

[01:28] And the back box of Rick and Morty Pinball measures 29 inches across, so there was no way

[01:35] I was going to get this game through the door and into the bedroom without figuring

[01:41] out a solution.

[01:42] Now at first, I was going to take the front door off my apartment, which is a pain in the

[01:47] ass, and then I was going to try and maybe just put the game in the living room because

[01:52] there was no way I was going to get the game into the bedroom.

[01:55] It was like an inch and a half to wide.

[01:58] So the next thing that popped into my head was maybe I'll just remove the back box, and

[02:03] I did that with Magic Girl before because that back box was wider.

[02:06] Stern Pinball machines, by the way, fit in and out of this apartment.

[02:10] After a little narrower, a Stern Pinball back box is 27 inches and that two inches in

[02:16] this apartment means the world.

[02:18] So I actually called up spooky pinball, I spoke to Chuck and I was like, Chuck, should I

[02:23] remove the back box?

[02:24] He's like, ah, we don't recommend it.

[02:27] There's a lot of connectors in there.

[02:29] Make sure you take photos of everything, this and that.

[02:32] And as I was looking at all the connectors and Brenda was watching over me and she saw

[02:36] what was about to happen.

[02:38] She saw that I was about to spend the entire day and run my brand new Pinball machine.

[02:44] And so as I was looking at the connectors and looking at the back box, it dawned on me

[02:48] that there's enough slack in the cables in this game that go up to the back box that,

[02:55] what if we just remove the bolts that are keeping the back box on the hinge, the three on

[03:02] each side.

[03:03] So we fixed total bolts and then we can lift the back box up and just tilt it and that's

[03:08] exactly what we did.

[03:10] And it worked like a charm.

[03:12] Now let me tell you something, when you order a butter cabinet from spooky pinball, they

[03:17] don't just ship it.

[03:19] They ship it as if it's coming from a collector to a collector.

[03:23] This thing was wrapped with shipping blankets like furniture blankets, whatever, whatever,

[03:28] moving blankets.

[03:29] All those blue padded blankets, they wrapped this thing in those blankets and so and that's

[03:35] how I usually ship my games to people when they buy them from me.

[03:39] So the butter cabinet had no blemishes, no dense, no dings and you know, if you ding or

[03:45] scratch a butter cabinet, that's it folks.

[03:47] You ain't ever going to get it back to being perfect again.

[03:51] So we get it through the door, we get it into the bedroom.

[03:54] We then I was like, oh man, there's no leg bolts.

[03:57] There's no leg bolts on the game.

[03:59] And so for those of you opening up a Rick and Morty, the leg bolts are actually already

[04:04] screwed into the cabinet.

[04:06] They're not in the box with the legs.

[04:09] So I did not realize that.

[04:11] So I called spooky and said you didn't give me leg bolts and they said check the cabinets.

[04:16] And okay, so this is again, this is Canada, a total newbie, but sometimes you know, companies

[04:22] ship the leg bolts separately.

[04:24] Sometimes they're screwed into the cabinets.

[04:26] I'm learning.

[04:27] I'm learning as I go.

[04:28] So we get the game set up and the first thing you're going to notice, and I just have to say

[04:31] this.

[04:32] And if you've watched my Facebook live video, the first thing you'll notice about this

[04:35] game, if you order a butter cabinet, you're going to want to go butter.

[04:40] And I mean that.

[04:41] I know it's a thousand dollar option.

[04:43] And I know that it's more money than a lot of you want to spend on a pinball machine.

[04:47] And it only makes sense.

[04:49] Listen to me.

[04:50] It only makes sense to spend that money if you're going to see the cabinet.

[04:55] Okay, because if you're going to just slide this game in into a row of games, this either

[05:01] has to be the game on the end of the row or it's not worth it.

[05:04] I'm just going to say it.

[05:05] There's no point in spending the money on the butter cabinet if you're not going to be

[05:08] staring at it every day.

[05:11] That being said, if you are going to stare at this cabinet, it's absolutely stunning.

[05:15] And there's nothing I can do to capture a picture that will show you how amazing it looks

[05:21] in person.

[05:22] I mean, it really does just pop.

[05:24] It's so glossy.

[05:25] It's so beautiful.

[05:26] I do not regret ordering the butter cabinet and the purple.

[05:31] The purple armor looks incredible.

[05:33] And the purple coin door is the way to go.

[05:35] So if you are on the fence about whether or not to have a black coin door or a purple

[05:40] coin door, trust me.

[05:42] And I was one who thought that the black might be better because it blends in with the black

[05:46] of the sky.

[05:48] But trust me, the purple coin door is the way to go.

[05:52] The butter cabinet is the way to go on this game.

[05:55] So if you're on the fence about those two things, I'm here to tell you you will not,

[06:00] you will not regret your choice.

[06:02] Okay.

[06:03] I went with the coin door that doesn't have the dollar bill acceptor because I don't

[06:08] need to have a dollar bill acceptor.

[06:10] And I never played Pimball with headphones.

[06:12] So that's why I went with that.

[06:14] Okay.

[06:15] The top comes attached to the game.

[06:16] Super easy.

[06:17] Didn't break.

[06:18] It worked perfectly.

[06:19] Set the game up, turn it on, game works.

[06:22] I installed the new code.

[06:24] All you got to do is download the file and you put it in.

[06:27] And so what I love about what spooky is done is you can do everything you need to do

[06:31] with the game without removing the translate, which was always annoying in Batman when I always

[06:37] had to take out the translate to put in the USB stick to update the game.

[06:42] I love that every single thing just happens in the panel that's below the translate.

[06:49] And you never really have to remove the translate.

[06:51] So that's really, really smart.

[06:53] And I'm really glad they did that because it's a pain.

[06:56] And this is a real back glass people when I did remove it, I'm telling you it's really

[07:02] night and day between the cheap plastic you get with the stern machine and the real back

[07:08] glass you get with this spooky machine.

[07:10] So it really, really is a solid piece that's up there.

[07:13] So be careful with it.

[07:14] Be careful with it.

[07:15] So I got the the lightest speaker grills.

[07:18] I got everything, every option except for the dollar bill, except there.

[07:23] And my game in total, in total was over $9,500.

[07:29] So yes, I am an insane person to spend that much money on this game.

[07:35] But you know me, I love all the bells and whistles.

[07:37] And I just want my game to be as nice as possible.

[07:42] And I know people have been debating like, oh, you're complaining about a $600 or a

[07:46] dollar dollar from Stern and you spend $1,000 on the butter cabinet.

[07:50] When you look at the butter cabinet, you can see where the money went.

[07:53] You can see it's directly printed, it's clear coded.

[07:57] There's actually some craftsmanship that went into this thing versus that crappy piece of

[08:03] crap topper for $600.

[08:06] I mean, I would happily pay this for this.

[08:09] That's all I've ever been saying about this damn topper.

[08:11] It's like you just, you get what you pay for.

[08:13] If you get the butter cabinet, you will not feel like you got ripped off.

[08:17] You just won't.

[08:18] You just won't.

[08:19] You'll be that happy.

[08:20] All right, so the game itself, let me go into the game itself because then I got to get

[08:22] to work today because I actually have to take a vacation day yesterday because I spent

[08:26] so much time on the pinball machine.

[08:28] Now, I don't know about you guys out there, but when you first get a pinball machine and

[08:33] you set it up and you're going through all the motions with the game, it's exhausting.

[08:38] It takes a while for me to get a pinball machine set up.

[08:41] I don't have anyone to help me other than Brenda and she was amazing in helping me do

[08:45] this.

[08:46] We didn't drop the cabinet.

[08:47] We didn't break any toes.

[08:48] We didn't lose any fingers.

[08:50] But it took a while.

[08:52] It took a while.

[08:53] So we finally get the game up and running.

[08:55] We get the new code in it.

[08:56] The first thing I do when I flip the machine is I hit that orbit shot off the upper right

[09:01] flipper.

[09:02] That's the main shot that everyone's been worried about whether or not they would be able

[09:06] to hit it.

[09:07] Now, there is a shot in my machine that is really, really eroding away at my enjoyment

[09:13] of this game after 24 hours.

[09:15] I'm going to tell you what shot it is.

[09:17] And it isn't any of these shots that I expected to be an issue with this game.

[09:23] And I think I might have fixed it, but I'm not even sure if what I did is right.

[09:27] And I'm going to talk about that a little bit later.

[09:29] But this is a machine.

[09:31] This is a machine that really requires you to dial it in.

[09:34] Look, the first thing you'll notice in this game is the sound system is really great.

[09:40] And the bass and the speakers and the audio of Rick and Morty are phenomenal.

[09:46] So I'm so used to a stern machine.

[09:48] And I will say this, the sound system in Rick and Morty blows away the sound system in

[09:53] my Batman.

[09:54] Now, I'm not sure if the newer stern games have better speakers, but you're getting a really

[09:59] great sound system.

[10:00] And we know Scott and E.C. was going to put a great sound system in the game.

[10:03] And it's got a huge sub.

[10:05] I mean, the sub is like set at like the knob is like barely turned on and it's rattling

[10:12] this game.

[10:13] I have to remove the shaker motor from the game.

[10:16] I play the game with it on and it's really cool.

[10:18] I can't.

[10:19] I can't shake a pinball machine because the woman below me will complain immediately.

[10:25] She used to complain when I have the shaker motor on my load of the rings.

[10:28] So I have to unplug the shaker.

[10:31] But it's in the game.

[10:32] So down the road, if someone else owns Canada's machine, you will have the shaker motor already

[10:37] installed.

[10:38] But for those of you who want to shake the game, this game, I heard from John at Jack

[10:42] Bar that when you have the shaker going, it like rattles the glass on the machines next

[10:47] to it.

[10:48] That's how powerful it is.

[10:49] So there's that there.

[10:51] The one issue I'm having right now with setting my game up is getting the level right.

[10:56] And to get it at six and a half degrees, I've ordered in Amazon leveler because the

[11:01] pin guy app that is on my phone, it sucks.

[11:05] It doesn't work.

[11:06] I've calibrated it.

[11:07] I've put it on the play field.

[11:10] It almost makes it seem like I need to jack the legs up 12 inches to get the six and a half

[11:14] degrees.

[11:15] It doesn't work.

[11:16] I don't know what's going on with that app, but it's just not effective.

[11:19] And so I have my, my, the rear legs in the game are up like three-fourths of the way.

[11:24] So I think it's, it should be around six and a half degrees.

[11:27] And then I've been leveling it left to right to make sure that it's, it's level properly.

[11:33] Now the problem in my apartment too is like my floor is just not flat.

[11:36] And so I'm doing the best I can.

[11:38] And I know if you keep it in the same spot and you use the leveler, it should get to that

[11:42] point.

[11:43] So the, it's playing fine though.

[11:45] I mean, the game is shooting, it's shooting fine.

[11:49] I mean, there are no shots in this game.

[11:51] I can't hit with the flippers.

[11:54] The right ramp is easily hit by backhanding with the right flipper.

[11:59] I've hit tons of shots to the garage from the upper right flipper.

[12:03] I've hit the orbit shot.

[12:05] I think the most loops I've done with the upper right flipper orbit have been two in a row.

[12:09] It flies around there though.

[12:11] Good luck trying to hit like three or four in a row.

[12:13] You'd have to have like lightning fast reflexes.

[12:16] Now, the quality is great.

[12:18] The play field looks like glass.

[12:20] It's absolutely beautiful.

[12:21] I will say this.

[12:22] I did notice a few tiny little dimples appeared.

[12:26] A few tiny ones after a lot of plays, but you barely notice them.

[12:29] Not like the cratering you get on a stern machine, but I will say, I think we might have to

[12:34] just agree that with any clear coat on any wood, there is going to be slight dimples in

[12:40] areas of the game where the ball either falls down on or ricochets or there's a lot of

[12:47] fast action in this game.

[12:48] So if you're expecting to never see a little dimple in a Rick and Morty machine, I stand

[12:54] here to correct you.

[12:55] You will see a few.

[12:57] But again, it's like the play field is such good quality.

[13:01] There's no sinking of post into the clear.

[13:04] It's just when you run your hand over it, it's just it's glass.

[13:07] This game is glass.

[13:08] So I'm happy with that.

[13:10] What else am I, do I want to talk about right now in the game?

[13:14] Here's the shot that's just got me like pulling my hair out.

[13:18] I'm just really, it's such an important shot in the game and mine is just rejecting over

[13:24] and over and over again from both flippers.

[13:27] And the shot I'm talking about is the center scoop shot.

[13:30] It's in the middle of the horseshoe, okay?

[13:32] You know the shot.

[13:33] It's the shot you need to start in adventure.

[13:36] It's the start.

[13:37] It's the shot you need to start a multiple.

[13:39] So it's a really important shot in the game.

[13:41] And for some reason, my shot from a right flipper left flipper when you go straight up

[13:47] to middle with some good velocity.

[13:49] It was just hitting and donking right out hitting and donking right out over and over and over

[13:53] again.

[13:54] And I had Brenda come play.

[13:56] I tried working on the leveling of the game.

[13:58] I also tried to lower the flipper power.

[14:01] And there's just something about it.

[14:02] I even got a response from Scott Denise to try and bend it down a little bit towards

[14:07] the play field.

[14:09] But nothing was really that effective.

[14:11] And so as I was looking at it, weirdly, the scoop, the metal almost sticks up.

[14:17] A little bit past the wood.

[14:19] There's like a lip.

[14:20] You can see the metal lip.

[14:21] And I just talked to John at Jack Bar and his game is that way too.

[14:25] Like it's like when they fully screw in the mech, it has a little lip where, and I don't

[14:30] know if that's meant to protect the wood or if that's how it's supposed to sit.

[14:35] But for some reason on mine, it was just rejecting, rejecting, rejecting.

[14:39] So what I did and it seems to be working much, much better now is I put a few washers

[14:45] underneath the mechanism where the screw goes.

[14:48] So the screw goes, touches the mech and then hits the washers and then the wood.

[14:52] And it's creating a little bit of a gap, which is actually pushing the mechanism down

[14:57] a little bit.

[14:58] So it's sitting a little lower in my game now.

[15:00] And so now in my game, the scoop entrance, the metal part is more flush with the wood.

[15:08] Now I've been playing it a few times and it's working much, much better.

[15:12] Now my only concern by lowering that a little bit, is that going to affect the wood?

[15:19] Am I going to start like chipping away at the play field and I'm not sure.

[15:24] It's working fine.

[15:25] I don't notice any impact on when the ball gets ejected.

[15:30] So it's not hitting the wood there because when it ejects, it goes up and it follows

[15:33] the curvature of the metal hood.

[15:36] And even when it goes into the scoop, it seems to have enough velocity where it's really,

[15:41] it's not really impacting the wood because it's flying into the scoop.

[15:45] So I will show pictures of this on my Facebook page and see if this is a fix.

[15:51] But I'm a little bit concerned because when I looked at John's machine, his looked at

[15:56] the original height that mine was and he wasn't getting rejects and I was.

[16:01] So now I'm a little concerned that I might have done something I shouldn't have and maybe

[16:06] it was an issue with the height of the game or the flipper power.

[16:10] But I tried adjusting all those things and I was still getting tons of rejects.

[16:15] So I think that's my ultimate takeaway right now after only 24 hours of the game.

[16:21] Is the game really needs you to set it up properly?

[16:25] And this game is a game in which you're going to have to dial it in and you're going to

[16:30] have to set it up so that it plays well for you, that it plays well in your environment.

[16:37] And I was talking to Joe Abate.

[16:39] I think that's his last name and Joe has a machine.

[16:41] He's a great guy.

[16:42] And he was saying the same thing is like you really just have to tweak this thing and

[16:46] dial it in so that it works for you.

[16:49] So whether that's adjusting the flipper coil power, whether it's adjusting the ejection

[16:55] coil strength on the dimension shot and the garage, like there's a lot of different things

[17:01] going on in this game where I really think you know there's not going to be just one

[17:05] standard setting that works for everybody.

[17:08] You know some some people might like the flipper power at full strength and I mean it

[17:12] goes around that horseshoe like you blink and it's already back at the flippers.

[17:16] Some people might want to slow that down a little bit so you have a little bit more control

[17:20] in the game.

[17:21] Now here's the takeaway though and I will say this I will say this opening up a new

[17:26] inbox game and playing it is in exhilarating thrill.

[17:30] But to have a major shot in the game be really problematic like the middle scoop was really

[17:37] frustrating and it was really like it started to just eat away at my enjoyment and you know

[17:42] Brenda's like why are you so bummed out I'm like well I mean I I don't feel like I should

[17:46] have to adjust that on a brand new game like a like did they tested did it work well and

[17:53] I think the center scoop it just it's it rejects more than then most scoops in Pimble.

[18:00] And I'm used to Pimble games were some some games like every time you nail the scoop

[18:04] you know it in this game even when you look at the scoop it's like it's not dead center

[18:08] it's turned a little bit it's just it's just part of the game and I think that's my overall

[18:14] assessment and again this is only after 24 hours of owning the game and I've maybe put

[18:19] about 30 to 50 games on it so far for those guys out there who say they I've only played

[18:24] this game 200 times in three years you guys are all such liars when you get a brand new

[18:29] game how are you not going over and over and over again and especially with Rick and

[18:33] Morty because it's a fast brutal game like this is in a game where you're gonna have like half-hour

[18:37] ball times that's the other part you know I didn't really talk about the gameplay is the game

[18:41] tough yes the game is very tough if you are not good at Pimble will you enjoy this game and I

[18:48] think each of you is gonna have to figure that out for yourself I enjoy flipping it but I do

[18:54] think the game is like really really hard I mean the shots are not there it's not like it's

[18:59] obviously not a fan layout the shots require a high degree of learning to find them I love

[19:06] them people say you got to find the shots in the game in a lot of modern games in a lot of

[19:10] stern games they're designed purposely so that most people even casual people can hit every shot

[19:18] Rick and Morty I think requires a higher degree of skill to hit the shots it's gonna make everybody a

[19:25] better pinball player but I also could see how for a lot of the casual guys out there that want to

[19:31] make their way through a game you might get really frustrated by this game you might not enjoy it

[19:38] because you might feel like you're chopping wood trying to get through the game and get through

[19:44] the adventures and it's just too hard and I think you're gonna have to spend some time on this game

[19:49] and determine whether or not you want to put in the time and effort required to learning the game

[19:55] now me personally I've no problem with learning the game I've no problem with a game that just

[20:00] shoots so radically different than any game I've ever shot before and that's just the way it is I

[20:06] mean you've got to get a feel for those shots on the right side and where to where to let the ball

[20:11] go off the left flipper I mean a lot of the game comes down to that like hitting that right orbit

[20:16] hitting the right ramp the right ramp is really easy the left ramp is really challenging it's a

[20:24] really awkward shot there's something about the way the plastic sits in front of it you know the

[20:30] plastic that has the crystal on it it's it's almost like the game creates a lot of optical

[20:36] illusions for you where the shot isn't exactly where you think it is or where your eyes are telling it

[20:42] it is you're gonna have to learn more muscle memory on on where that shot needs to come off that

[20:49] flipper because otherwise I think if you rely on just your line of sight it's deceiving and I

[20:55] kind of like that like it's kind of brutal it's kind of over the top hard in some ways but I

[21:02] definitely enjoy it like when multi balls going it's like all hell's breaking loose in the game I

[21:07] it's like you're I'm just slapping it the concept of like controlling four balls at once in this

[21:14] game is really really difficult so good luck with that now that brings me to one of the things I

[21:19] was observing as I was playing the game is this game is all about two things for me I mean it's all

[21:25] about these adventures it's all about these dimensions and obviously collecting the megacids and

[21:30] those different ways you can play the game and it's a lot of fun and and it's really easy to

[21:35] understand what to do in the game it's really easy to understand what to do but it's really hard to do

[21:41] it and I think one of the things I was noticing as adventures were starting is something I would love

[21:46] to see in this game something I think would be an added bonus for people who aren't incredible pinball

[21:53] players and I know I'm gonna get a lot of flack for saying this but this game would actually benefit

[21:59] from a lockdown bar button I know I'm saying it but here's why here's why and maybe you don't

[22:05] need the lockdown bar button but it would benefit from having the ability when you're in an adventure

[22:11] to somehow press a button and maybe use some of your megacid powers to actually advance through

[22:18] the mode so an easy way to understand this is like I'm so used to Batman when you're in a mode

[22:24] where you could use your gadgets to get through the modes and I really wish this game had that

[22:30] ability because when you're in a mode sometimes it's really confusing to know how many more shots

[22:35] you have to make I think they added something to the display that says that but there's a lot

[22:41] like there's a lot of shots you need to hit sometimes and they've done a good job in some of these

[22:46] modes in making it easier so for example in Pirates of the Pancreas I think at first it was like you

[22:52] had to always hit the I think you always had to hit the ramps and then after halfway counting

[22:59] down the mode or maybe like 20 seconds then they make it easier then like every shot lights up and

[23:05] you can you can advance the mode that way so I think the coding team on this game is going to have

[23:09] to figure out a way in which people can see more of the game if you want to get through the game so

[23:17] collecting 10 adventures seems like almost impossible but maybe that's okay as well maybe the

[23:23] whole point of this game is not to you know to see most of it at once and I think they did want to

[23:29] create a game that's very challenging for those of you out there who own your machines it's okay to

[23:33] have a game that's challenging and hard to get to stuff but look I want to be fair too because I

[23:39] rag on Willy Wonka for being too hard and you just can't get through the game and this and that

[23:45] and I will agree like Willy Wonka in the layout that it is in the movie that it is you just want

[23:51] to see more of it but because Rick and Morty is not Willy Wonka and here's the big difference for me

[23:56] Rick and Morty is a is a television show with a lot of different adventures so it makes total

[24:01] sense to like randomize them and you'll get to see those different adventures in random ways but

[24:06] Willy Wonka is not like that like you won't get to certain modes in the game unless you get far

[24:13] enough into the game like there's no you're not randomly gonna get wonka's office early on in some

[24:18] of your games you know and that was always my issue with Willy Wonka is they buried so much of the

[24:23] game so deep into it and it's really hard to see any of it but what I love about Rick and Morty

[24:28] it's like when they put a new mode in that you really want to see like get swifty uh you're going

[24:33] to see it and it's going to come up randomly every once in a while and you don't get to choose the

[24:39] orders of your adventures which is fun I think you get to choose after you fill out for every nine

[24:44] right Morty gets to choose one or Rick gets I think that's how it works in the in the show but you

[24:48] know what I'm saying so you're gonna see this stuff and I think that's another reason why this

[24:52] game will be of appeal to people is is the the amount of variety in it okay but I'll say this I'll

[24:59] say this I'm still just gonna warn you guys it's a tough machine so don't think you're gonna jump

[25:04] on this machine and feel the same level of smoothness that you do in other machines don't think

[25:10] you're gonna experience the same flow in this game as other machines it's it's a little it's a

[25:16] little clunky I'm not gonna lie I told you can it is gonna give you an honest review it can be very

[25:22] clunky and you sometimes can get the feeling that like the game is a little added your control

[25:29] that it's the ball is just like dinking around and dinking around you hear a lot of like this

[25:33] metallic sound when you're playing the game and it's it's like this tinny sort of metal on metal

[25:39] like donkiness happening and clunkiness that you will hear a lot when you play this game and that's

[25:45] just because a lot of the shots are tight you've got the metal rails going all over the place that

[25:50] are guiding the ball and there's a lot of there's a lot of like left to right action with the ball

[25:56] as well as like north to south and I think there's a lot of just randomness and chaos that Denise

[26:01] put into this game which which creates a lot of that so I'm just here to warn you like if you're not

[26:06] a fan of that and you want a more expected pathway for the ball and you're so used to maybe fan layout

[26:14] so you're so used to stern machines you know if you go off from a black knight to this you're gonna

[26:20] feel like this game is just broken if you go from a flowy Steve Richie game to this you're gonna

[26:25] feel like wait what happened here like what's wrong none of the shots are where you expect them to be

[26:29] they're not they're just it's just that kind of game and I think Scott created a game that breaks up

[26:34] the monotony for people who are used to all those other games but I'm here to tell you I'm here to warn

[26:38] you it's just not going to be for everybody is it for me I mean time will tell I'm happy to have it

[26:44] I'm happy to explore this game I really want to get that center scoop to the point where I'm not

[26:49] getting frustrated with the game because it makes me not want to I gotta be honest it makes me not

[26:53] want to play a game when I need to hit this shot to start the adventures and start the multi balls

[26:58] and it keeps drinking out like I I'm hoping the fix I did makes it better but I also hope that

[27:04] lowering it doesn't mess up my playfield so if you think that would let me know I'm gonna share

[27:09] photos on my Facebook page and let's discuss it but I'm otherwise I'm really loving the game I'm

[27:16] looking at it right now I think it's a great package I think spooky pinball should be really proud

[27:21] of themselves I think they have a home run theme I think it sounds great it looks great it's super

[27:27] fun it has that one more ball kind of feel to it and again it's just it's a really really

[27:34] different kind of pinball the experience and I'm so happy to have variety and pinball

[27:40] do I think this game is worth 95 hundred dollars no I don't I don't think most games are worth

[27:46] 95 hundred dollars but remember a lot of this is cosmetic but you know you won't stand over a

[27:53] brick in morty and see like mechanisms and see a lot of stuff in the game but when you lift the

[27:58] playfield you're gonna see a lot of stuff so you know you know when you lift some of these modern

[28:02] stones and there's nothing underneath it it's not like that like the value in this game seems to

[28:07] a lot of it is underneath the playfield and you'll see that when you lift the playfield but you

[28:11] know it doesn't have that one magical mech it doesn't have that one thing wow did you see what

[28:16] the ball just did it just doesn't it doesn't really have anything like that the ball doesn't go

[28:22] into a portal and then come out mysteriously from another area of the game I mean I get it

[28:26] shoots through the subway out the left and by the flipper but you know I'm saying it doesn't have

[28:31] that magic the of the way the ball like goes through the portal in Lord the Rings when it goes

[28:35] through the ring and and magnetize and shoots out so I think you know for me this game reminds me

[28:41] it does remind me a lot of Batman in the sense that the theme integration is over the moon it's

[28:46] amazing it's the best thing integrated machine along with Batman and in a lot of ways it reminds me

[28:51] of Batman because while there's not the magical mech it's all about the callouts the music the

[28:59] lights the clips from the show that you love I mean it's very similar in terms of like that's how

[29:05] those two games or these two games brought the theme to life neither one of these games brought

[29:11] the theme to life very mechanically or with you know a a lot of the world under glass is mostly

[29:17] and would I like to have seen more stuff in the game that was like physical interpretations of the

[29:23] show absolutely I'm not going to lie to you like the Wurly Derly like why couldn't they make a

[29:29] Wurly Derly roller coaster in the game and we have a roller coaster in October fest it would have

[29:33] been so cool to have a Wurly Derly ramp that like looped around and like spiraled down like that

[29:40] would have been super cool you don't get any of that sensation in when you're playing the game

[29:45] physically but it's still it's it is what it is it's it's Scott and easy soft mark effort I think

[29:52] it's it's a really fun game and I do think you're gonna want to play one to make sure it's for you

[29:57] unfortunately all 750 like mine they're sold so people are are are gonna have to just determine

[30:04] whether or not they want it do I think people are gonna sell their spots after hearing this review

[30:09] no I do not do I think you should take this game and enjoy it absolutely I think you should

[30:14] is this a game I think people are going to regret if they get rid of it I do I do I think this

[30:19] is gonna go down is is a special pinball machine for a lot of the reasons I mentioned I I get that

[30:25] it doesn't have the mechanical world under glass some of you might want but there's something about

[30:30] Rick and Morty and the callouts and the humor and the personality and the music and all the stuff

[30:37] that's in this game it's just a really unique fun pinball experience for those of you with large

[30:42] collections absolutely you're going to enjoy this for some of you like me who this might be the

[30:47] only pinball machine in your home yes I could see why you might be frustrated if this is the only

[30:53] pinball machine you have to shoot because of the difficulty of it but know this about me I I do a

[31:00] lot of different things in my days and in my weeks to entertain myself I don't only need to play

[31:05] pinball every week and so I'm happy to have a difficult game that's really funny it's the kind of

[31:10] game where you'd want your friends to jump on it and be like you'll check it out check out

[31:15] Rick and Morty and hear the cursing and hear this and that will they be any good at the game no will

[31:19] they be able to figure the game out probably not but that's okay because I think they'll enjoy

[31:25] just the light show the music and the callouts of the game all right so that's my initial review of

[31:30] Rick and Morty please please please oh and and for you guys who are wondering yes the game ships

[31:35] with the screws removed on the orbit shot for the upper right flipper so you're not gonna have to

[31:39] touch anything there I'm just a little still I'm just a still a little like concern that I had

[31:43] to touch that center scoop I'm curious to see what other owners are going through there's not

[31:48] many games out there right now and that's another thing I'm not on pinstead so I can't share

[31:54] or discuss my ownership with people I'll do it on Facebook but you know that's where I miss

[31:59] being on pinstead so you can go in the owners club and and discuss this stuff I can't wait to more

[32:03] people get this game I can't wait to see what other people's reactions are and I can't wait to

[32:08] the community can help each other like set these games up so we can all get them playing as

[32:14] perfectly as possible but it is a game in which you're gonna have to tweak it is a game in which

[32:19] you're gonna have to dial in it's very sensitive to how it's set up just know that for you casual

[32:25] guys out there that are used to stern machines being a lot more friendly out of the box I've got to

[32:31] emit a lot more friendly out of the box all right everyone have a good day and we'll talk to you soon
