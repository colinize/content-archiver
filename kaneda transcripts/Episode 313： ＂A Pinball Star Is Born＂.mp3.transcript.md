[00:00] I need to buy the baby, it's the dollar, it's the only man, don't you go, get you buy the

[00:08] baby, baby, he's the only man, don't you go.

[00:15] Welcome to episode 313 of Canadian Spinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that is not too

[00:29] proud to beg.

[00:30] Apparently we're a bunch of beggars on this show, I love it.

[00:34] We're going to beg, borrow and steal your attention with one of the best interviews I've

[00:38] done in a long time.

[00:39] I'm not even going to introduce them because I hear I get redundant when I introduce people.

[00:44] I think you're really going to enjoy this take on the pinball hobby from one of the

[00:49] best distributors in the hobby.

[00:52] And I really love probably the final 10 minutes of this interview when he actually challenges

[00:58] me and my point of view on who I think is buying these pinball games and I loved it because

[01:04] I think I learned a lot from when he had to say and it changes some of my perspective

[01:10] on this pinball hobby.

[01:13] So I know I read a lot of you guys always trying to sort of give your opinions about my

[01:18] passion behind pinball.

[01:20] I think it's real, I think a lot of you can relate to my point of view on this hobby.

[01:24] But I also think when you learn more about this hobby from people who actually sell the pinball

[01:30] machines to people out there, you can't help but grow and change a little bit your opinions

[01:37] about pinball.

[01:38] So I did enjoy hearing what he has to say.

[01:41] So I'm just going to air this interview.

[01:44] It's a great one and I'm going to be back to you maybe at the end of it with some opinions

[01:49] and some thoughts on what we talked about.

[01:51] Here we go.

[01:53] Ladies and gentlemen, you all know him as one of the greatest pinball distributors to walk

[01:59] the face of the earth.

[02:00] Joe Newhart from pinball star Joe, welcome back to the show.

[02:03] Hey Chris, that's a great intro.

[02:05] I like that.

[02:06] Well, thank you.

[02:07] I'm going to start giving people the most glowing introductions.

[02:09] You know, I have to do all I can to get people back on the show.

[02:12] It seems.

[02:13] I don't think so.

[02:15] I think you've had a lot of great guests lately.

[02:17] Well, I appreciate it.

[02:18] I appreciate it.

[02:19] And Joe, the reason I wanted to have you back on, it's been a while.

[02:22] We're now in, what is it?

[02:25] February, mid-February, pretty much of 2019.

[02:29] Year distributor, you're looking out into the pinball landscape for 2019.

[02:33] What kind of year do you think it's going to be?

[02:35] I think it's actually going to be a pretty good year.

[02:40] You know, it's, we're kind of in the middle of what I think is going to be quite a long

[02:46] low at this point in the winter months, P.S.

[02:50] There's really not, you know, Stern just came out with monsters.

[02:53] That was the most recent release.

[02:55] And I don't think we're going to see a lot of reveals of significance until mid year.

[03:02] And then maybe some more later in the year.

[03:05] So I think a lot of the companies have announced what they're going to announce.

[03:09] And, you know, even from a sales perspective with pinball stars, it's a little bit of a

[03:13] nod, you know, situation where a lot of the games are starting to ramp up that we're

[03:19] already announced.

[03:21] You know, we got October Fest that's going to start shipping hopefully at the end of

[03:24] this month.

[03:25] I'm talking to Joe Balser a couple of times in the past week.

[03:29] So they're going to be getting ready to go very soon.

[03:32] Spooky is starting to ship Alice Cooper.

[03:34] We got the first of those going out very shortly with my first customers.

[03:40] And Jersey Jack is still plugging away with pirates of Garvin.

[03:45] And we should see some new stuff.

[03:47] I know you're going to be asking about that.

[03:49] And you know, monster bash is shipping a little bit slowly, more slowly than expected.

[03:53] But you know, that's shipping.

[03:55] So we're not going to see anything new coming from them.

[03:58] I think Spooky is going to have a whole year of production on Alice Cooper.

[04:03] And obviously Scott, the NAC's game is going to be, you know, in development for, you

[04:10] know, the near future.

[04:11] And I don't exactly know when that's going to be revealed.

[04:13] But I wouldn't expect that to be towards the end of the year.

[04:16] You know, maybe they'll prove me wrong.

[04:18] Chicago gaming will see anything new from them for a while since monster bash will dominate

[04:23] most of this year.

[04:24] I would think.

[04:25] And some of the reruns of medieval and attack.

[04:27] We're going to see some stuff coming from Jersey Jack.

[04:30] I don't think it's going to be as quick as some people may think it is.

[04:34] Right.

[04:35] Maybe they'll surprise us.

[04:36] But, uh, well, let's talk to you.

[04:38] Let's talk about this in sort of like the order of what you've been talking about.

[04:41] So, sure, you, we have no agenda.

[04:44] So you were, and we never do.

[04:47] So let's talk about October, so you ended this month is when you're thinking that could

[04:52] be shipping out.

[04:53] Are they going to reveal sort of like this is the final, final, final version of the

[04:58] game?

[05:01] You know, I didn't ask that question.

[05:02] I know there's been changes to artwork.

[05:04] I know there's been some changes to some of the mechanics.

[05:07] Nothing really major.

[05:08] Just maybe some geometry and, and, you know, fit and finish type of things.

[05:15] I'm sure when everything is finalized, they're going to say, you know, here's some professional

[05:20] pictures.

[05:21] And here's the layout of exactly what we're, you know, what we're producing versus

[05:25] what was shown at Expo.

[05:27] You know, it's a good question.

[05:29] I, you know, they definitely released new cabinet artwork.

[05:34] So we saw the changes there.

[05:35] We saw the changes to the back glass.

[05:37] They took the monkey off.

[05:38] What are your thoughts on the monkey?

[05:41] The monkey, I think, is a bunch of, and I don't, I don't usually curse on your, on your,

[05:47] on your podcast, but I think the monkey was just, the whole thing was a bunch of horseshit.

[05:52] I think the monkey's funny.

[05:54] I do get that the monkey doing what the monkey was doing was maybe not, you know, politically

[06:01] correct in this environment.

[06:05] So I don't have a problem with losing the monkey, but the monkey is, the monkey's funny.

[06:10] Let's face it.

[06:11] The monkey is part of American pinball.

[06:14] He's kind of like the run official mascot.

[06:16] I wish he was still on the back glass.

[06:18] I do understand that, you know, doing what he was doing was not, you know, where did they

[06:23] get this mascot?

[06:24] Is it inspired by John Papadiox work there or like, no, you know, here's the story with

[06:30] the monkey.

[06:31] I'm surprised you don't know.

[06:32] It was on Houdini, right?

[06:33] Yeah, he was on Houdini, but, you know, and I never knew the story.

[06:38] And one day, you know, I see that they made the t-shirts with, you know, the monkey with

[06:44] little bandages across his private parts.

[06:48] And, you know, and to make a t-shirt, you know, I asked Joe Balls, or I said, Joe, what's

[06:54] with the monkey?

[06:55] I said, you know, it's funny and all, and these are character on the game, but, you know,

[06:59] is he that integral of a character to the theme to make it, you know, make him with a t-shirt?

[07:04] He said, you don't know about the monkey.

[07:05] He goes, we don't tell anybody, but since you're asking, I'm going to tell you.

[07:09] And he said that, you know, we've been very adept to making sure that we're very historical

[07:16] with a lot of little nuances with Houdini and the history of Houdini on the game.

[07:22] There's a lot of little references that only, you know, maybe Houdini fans or people

[07:26] that research Houdini would know about.

[07:28] And he said, the thing with the monkey, he said, Houdini was kind of a crazy guy.

[07:32] And Houdini had this thing in his head that if there was something with monkey testicles,

[07:38] that if you ate them or extracted something from them, I don't think you're what, but

[07:44] that they would make a man, you know, more, what's the word?

[07:50] You may help me out here, Chris, more, you know, more successful with the ladies.

[07:56] Yes, there's some more more.

[07:58] So there was something that, yeah, vitality, that's the word that, you know, there was

[08:03] something with monkeys, it touched the goals that Houdini actually adhered to and believed

[08:10] and there's rumors that he actually had used, you know, monkey parts.

[08:15] It's like ancient Viagra was monkey plastic.

[08:18] Exactly.

[08:19] Yes.

[08:20] So, you know, the guys, Jeff Bush and the artist and the guys that when they were developing

[08:24] American pinball, just at that, that was a really neat historical little quirk that probably

[08:29] most people don't know.

[08:31] And they put it in the artwork of the monkey with tape on his privates and then, you know,

[08:38] to make a little bit more fun out of it, they, you know, they did a run of some t-shirts

[08:42] with, you know, they put the girls that are on the sling shots on the t-shirts, on one

[08:45] set of t-shirts and they put the monkey on another.

[08:48] So, you know, we all internally had kind of a laugh about the monkey and it was, you know,

[08:53] funny that, you know, and we never told anybody the story.

[08:56] I think it was kind of the thing, even with people from American pinball, they never told

[09:01] anyone the story that didn't ask, but if somebody asked and they would share it.

[09:05] So putting the monkey on a topper fast was just, you know, for the people that knew the

[09:09] joke was kind of funny and then I guess, you know, obviously they, they backfired a little

[09:14] bit.

[09:15] They took it a little bit too far, but, you know, to their credit, it was, you know,

[09:20] nothing's ever fine on a prototype and they did react very quickly once there was, you

[09:25] know, some backlash from it and removed it and hold on one sec.

[09:29] Oh, we're going to go back to that one second.

[09:30] I might food just arrived.

[09:31] I'm just going to grab it and then put it on the table and then we're going to get right

[09:34] back on.

[09:35] Hold on.

[09:36] I'll leave right.

[09:37] Awesome.

[09:38] Alright.

[09:39] So the monkey gets put on the back glass of October fast, but you know, sort of derails

[09:48] the conversation a little bit.

[09:49] I agree that I didn't find it like so offensive.

[09:53] It did spark a conversation within the pinball world, Joe, that it's sort of like this

[09:59] underlying current of like most of the hobbies, man, it's older men.

[10:04] They're a little bit of a boys club.

[10:06] How many pinball machines do you sell to women a year?

[10:09] I'm just curious.

[10:10] Well, let me, let me, there's probably two parts to that question.

[10:18] Games that I sell to women that I'm only interacting with the women is actually on the rise

[10:24] to the point that it's now probably a few a month.

[10:28] Whereas, you know, if we go back five years, it was zero and it could be zero an entire

[10:34] year.

[10:36] Probably over the last two years.

[10:38] It's, I've noticed and I've noticed it's been a little bit of a steady increase where

[10:42] I'm dealing with, you know, women start to finish.

[10:46] It's not a wife calling for their husband.

[10:49] You know, there may be a husband involved or a family situation, but there's a number

[10:53] of them.

[10:54] And the second part of that question.

[10:56] So I do think that there's a lot of women and females, which is a great thing that are

[11:02] getting into the hobby on their own accord, not being pushed into it by their husbands

[11:06] or boyfriends.

[11:08] And then the other part of it is just the growth of the hobby, becoming, you know, opening

[11:16] up to be more family oriented and people looking to put, you know, and they may not be

[11:23] pin-side followers.

[11:25] They're not going to be people they're going to buy and follow every release.

[11:28] But there are people that, if they see a theme where, you know, now with the emergence

[11:33] of barcades and pinball machines getting out there in a wild again, which is also great,

[11:38] we're getting people that really probably had no interest in pinball a few years ago,

[11:43] now getting involved.

[11:44] And a lot of those sales, because they are probably more family driven activities versus,

[11:51] you know, a guy wanting to be, you know, a pinball fanatic or being in tournaments.

[11:56] It's more of a family activity with kids involved.

[11:58] I spend a lot of time talking to new people in the hobby.

[12:01] And I really love these conversations and I thrive on, you know, when somebody says,

[12:06] this is my first game and I just love going through all the different titles, all the

[12:10] different price points, explaining the ones that are good, the ones that maybe won't work

[12:13] for them.

[12:14] I try to take their temperature if they like certain themes, you know, are they into,

[12:19] you know, superhero themes, are they into something for the kids, which means, you know,

[12:23] maybe Wizard of Oz would be a great upkilling theme to them.

[12:26] So I enjoy that kind of stuff and I do find a lot more women, not just as single buyers,

[12:33] but also more involved in the conversation and the decision making process with the husband,

[12:41] you know, as a family purchase.

[12:42] And the hobbies, the hobbies for newbies, Joe, is theme just king in terms of what they're

[12:51] looking for because obviously when you're new, you don't really understand code or depth

[12:55] of code and you might not even understand how to feel what game shoots right for you,

[13:00] right?

[13:01] Because you don't have enough experience shooting a lot of different pins.

[13:03] So do they normally gravitate towards a theme that just, that they can relate to?

[13:08] I think so, yes.

[13:10] A lot of times people and I'll never try to convince somebody to move away from a particular

[13:15] theme that they come to me with first, but, you know, if they do seem inquisitive about

[13:20] what else is out there.

[13:21] Maybe sometimes people call me and say, you know, I played, I don't even want to name

[13:26] a game because it doesn't, I don't want to make it sound like a talking, so somebody

[13:29] got to something.

[13:30] Let's say a family comes in and is like, and I know I don't think you distribute the

[13:34] story on right?

[13:35] Well, I'll pick one.

[13:36] I'll pick because I had a recent example, you know, Star Wars.

[13:40] And somebody will say, oh, I, you know, we played the Star Wars game or were Star Wars

[13:43] fans or things like that.

[13:45] And I'll try, you know, not to dissuade them from a Star Wars, but more so, you know,

[13:51] I'll send them an email that lists all the products we sell, all the different companies

[13:54] that are out there, all the different types of games.

[13:57] I'll ask them where they're located at.

[13:59] I'll try to locate a barcade or better yet if it's a family type purchase, you know,

[14:04] try to find, you know, someplace like a sunshine market in New York City or the modern pinball

[14:11] or in Philadelphia, pinball gallery and ask them to go and these guys have a lot of the,

[14:16] you know, the new games that are out, you could play games from Stern, you could play games

[14:20] from Jersey Jack Pinball, you could play Houdini, for example, you could play the remakes

[14:25] and kind of see what, you know, Succi Best.

[14:28] And it's really across the board.

[14:30] We get a lot of people that decide that the Stern games are maybe because of theme is

[14:35] something that they like.

[14:37] We get probably a majority of the people that tend to gravitate towards the Jersey Jack

[14:42] games because when they do play them, they see the difference in terms of the LCD screen.

[14:49] And that's really a big draw, you know, whether it is or not for the pinball community,

[14:55] but having a fully integrated LCD screen with, you know, scoring and videos and really

[15:02] a good utilization of it and taking up so much real estate on the back glass, that's an

[15:06] attention gather.

[15:07] And it makes people, you know, especially in Newbie say, wow, pinball is different than

[15:12] what I remember it being or what I expected to be.

[15:15] Isn't it just easier to tell them Star Wars sucks, take my word for it?

[15:19] Well, I tell them that, you know, I'm kind of joking, not joking.

[15:24] Ball socks and no pinball socks.

[15:26] Let's, you know, we do it.

[15:28] I mean, that's the way you're not.

[15:30] But there are, but there's better games, you know, there's, Star Wars maybe isn't a

[15:35] game that I think is going to keep someone's interest being new to the hobby.

[15:39] Like, when I saw a newbie, a game, I want them to love it.

[15:43] I want their friends to come over and I want their friends to buy games.

[15:46] I want them to be, you know, more over from a non-selfish perspective.

[15:50] I want them to be happy with their purchase and I don't want them buying maybe a game like

[15:54] Star Wars that just what I think isn't the best play field layout ever made and the best

[16:01] shooting game.

[16:02] I want them to play something, whether it's a Stern or whether it's a remake, you know,

[16:07] and I'll go through all that.

[16:08] I'll say, listen, you can get a remake and these remakes are the top three games.

[16:13] Top three rated games ever made, but in the same respect, they're also 20 year old games.

[16:18] So it's interesting.

[16:20] It's interesting, Joe, seeing like some of the early criticism of the monsters that it's

[16:24] too easy for a lot of the guys who are experienced pinball players.

[16:28] But to your point, if you're a family and you're looking to get your first pin, I think

[16:32] that's, it's always been hard to put people on machines that aren't too difficult.

[16:37] Because I think too, like when you have some games where it's just the shots are too

[16:39] hard, it's going to be really frustrating for a Star Wars fan that blow up the day.

[16:43] And then you have a Death Star and you show them that cool hyper loop when you can't

[16:47] even really like get to it.

[16:49] You know, you have to be a pretty experienced player to get that deep into the game and

[16:52] hit those kind of shots consistently.

[16:54] But let's talk about American pinball and today's news, which were four new titles that they've

[17:01] registered for.

[17:02] I want to get your opinion on what you think about them.

[17:03] How's that sound?

[17:04] That's, that's fine.

[17:06] I did see that.

[17:07] I actually did talk to Joe Balser today and we did not even discuss that.

[17:11] I forgot all about it.

[17:13] I hadn't known about any of that prior.

[17:15] As a district, and I'm not saying that they're a thing or they're not a thing, because I honestly

[17:19] just don't know.

[17:20] But I know I remember Sherlock Holmes.

[17:23] I did see the, this week in pinball, pinball blast this morning.

[17:27] So we got, you got to reverse my memory with the other ones.

[17:29] Yeah, as a distributor, which one of these excites you and when you're thinking about

[17:33] like what do you think people will get most jazz to buy?

[17:35] So we got Sherlock Holmes.

[17:37] We got poker run.

[17:39] We've got Valkyrie and we've got Robin Hood.

[17:47] And by the way, oh, there I lose you.

[17:49] No, I'm here.

[17:50] Okay, because I thought I'd, I thought I'd lost you.

[17:53] And by the way, I learned today too that Sherlock Holmes is an open IP.

[17:58] So this is like a sort of like Houdini where any right up the rally.

[18:02] Yep.

[18:04] Can you explain to me and I know, explain to me Valkyrie.

[18:10] So Valkyrie, yeah, Valkyrie are, you ever see, I believe they're in the Thor movies,

[18:17] but they are the female warriors.

[18:21] And I believe they have wings.

[18:22] And I want to say they ride on horses and they are sort of powerful warriors that enter

[18:28] the battlefield and they're like, they determine who lives and dies on the battlefield.

[18:34] So if you, if you Google image, image sort of Valkyrie, I think that is what you'll

[18:37] come up with.

[18:38] And I think they are part of the Odin Thor sort of mythology.

[18:42] So we're looking at it as sort of like that sort of theme.

[18:46] I'm going to, I'm going to table that one as my lowest choice only because I'm, if it's

[18:53] something, I don't not say I know everything, but if I'm not readily familiar with it, I'm

[18:57] not sure that a lot of people would and were for talking theme.

[19:01] Recognition is going to be the first thing.

[19:02] So if you're asking my personal opinion, that would be one because I'd have to Google

[19:08] it that I would be a little bit of a head scratch around that one.

[19:15] Robin Hood, I'm going to go bottom to top.

[19:20] Robin Hood.

[19:24] I don't know.

[19:25] It doesn't seem exciting.

[19:27] Does it?

[19:28] I mean, you know, I kind of feel like maybe John Papaduke gave them that idea because he

[19:34] built a career in stealing from the rich.

[19:38] So for me, so maybe, well, yeah, I agree.

[19:43] I mean Robin Hood, it could be fun.

[19:46] It's just, I just feel like we've had so many bad Robin Hood movies over the years and

[19:51] interpretations of it that I don't feel like it's carried over in a contemporary way.

[19:57] That's very exciting.

[19:59] So yeah, I, I, it doesn't excite me.

[20:01] I know it's not, but it kind of sounds very tail-ish.

[20:04] I know it's not fairytale, but it's more literature and, but, uh, now this doesn't have

[20:13] an excitement value to me.

[20:16] Um, and what was, I know Sherlock Holmes.

[20:18] Yeah, then we got, we got Sherlock Holmes and then poker run, which, poke cards are confusing

[20:23] enough for people to combine them with pinball, which is really confusing.

[20:26] And so I think you spend, you know, I don't mean to be shitting on all three of them, but,

[20:30] um, I, I think that has promised peace.

[20:33] It could be a fun aspect in terms of achievement of, you know, cars or motorcycles and poker

[20:40] hands and stuff.

[20:41] But in the same respect, you know, when I think of that, I think there's been so much,

[20:46] uh, cards and poker and, and card, cars and cards and poker, uh, done in various iterations

[20:55] on pinball throughout, you know, uh, pinball back to the 1940s.

[20:59] Is a poker, does a poker run imply there's some automotive element?

[21:03] Yeah, I, I think it's kind of like, uh, you know, like a race, you know, you always see

[21:08] organizations do charity things where they'll do a poker run, whether it's for, you know,

[21:14] classic cars or more likely than not.

[21:16] A lot of times it's, it's motorcycles and what will happen is people will go from one location

[21:22] to another, not necessarily a race, but, you know, there could be a racing aspect to it.

[21:27] And when they arrive at each different destination, they receive a, uh, playing card.

[21:33] And then at the end of the race, they try to assemble the best poker hand.

[21:37] And I'll, I mean, I may be foolish.

[21:39] I can't know what I'm talking about, but I mean, that's, I've never done one, but I think

[21:43] that's what it's like.

[21:44] I think the concept will be interesting if during the game, you're collecting things and

[21:48] there's a, you know, but again, it's still playing cards and poker and that's been, you

[21:53] know, done.

[21:54] Right.

[21:55] And that's Bubba barking in the background listening to the show.

[21:57] I don't know what's wrong with him.

[21:59] I just gave him some water.

[22:00] So hopefully he will settle down and enjoy this episode of Can you just pinball podcasts?

[22:04] Um, I'm going to go pet him real quick while we talk, Joe.

[22:07] So, okay.

[22:08] So poker, and so you're saying your favorite is, is then Sherlock Holmes.

[22:13] I think of the four, it would be, you know, most recognizable, similar to Houdini.

[22:20] And, you know, I think they could make, which they really did a nice job on Houdini with

[22:25] the steam pump type of, a, a feaming to it.

[22:29] You know, they made the artwork really cool.

[22:32] And I think they can create character, you know, not that they're going to create different

[22:35] characters, but they can make the Sherlock Holmes characters, you know, maybe unique in some

[22:40] manner with artwork or, you know, humor or the tasks that they're trying to complete or

[22:47] the mysteries they're trying to solve.

[22:49] And I think there's a possibility there to make a game where the rules and the tasks of

[22:55] the game can be storyline based, which I always enjoy.

[22:59] I think, you know, a lot of us think back to, you know, the games of the 90s that were

[23:03] really good.

[23:04] Um, you know, there's, there's some storylines to them, which I think has been missed a

[23:09] lot with more recent games where the, you know, the aspect or the focus is strictly on,

[23:15] here's a theme and we're going to make a ramp and this ramp is going to be this character

[23:20] from the movie.

[23:21] This ramp is going to be another character.

[23:24] This outline is going to be called, you know, I mean, you'll look at something like X-Men,

[23:28] you know, every, you know, and it's common with most games, you know, every shot is a character

[23:33] and it's not really a storyline that you're working through.

[23:35] And, you know, if they do something creative, which I think American Pinball does a good

[23:39] job with, they did a great job with Houdini, showing the history of Houdini and making

[23:43] the tricks and different things that he did and his historical stuff, you know, part of

[23:48] the game.

[23:49] Um, I think there's an aspect of that for Sherlock Holmes.

[23:52] I mean, would it be my first choice for a pinball machine, you know, maybe not, but I,

[23:57] I think what a little creativity, it can continue to be, you know, American Pinball making these

[24:03] games and not just sticking a theme on it and then you can slap different artwork on

[24:08] any different game.

[24:09] Um, you know, it's a new game where they're kind of a little bit more creative with that

[24:16] aspect.

[24:17] So, right.

[24:18] Now, do you think we'll see a game three reveal in 2019, are they going to be pretty much,

[24:25] you know, all hands on deck just making October Fest throughout the year?

[24:29] Uh, I think we'll see another reveal.

[24:31] I could tell you that Joe shared with me.

[24:34] I mean, I'm not sharing any information and I don't think it'd be any surprise.

[24:38] It was a little bit of a surprise to me that this early in the game, but uh, Joe told

[24:42] me today he's already working on number three and number four in different aspects.

[24:46] So, um, you know, the design process starts, you know, much earlier than the game gets

[24:53] revealed.

[24:54] I would think that that process in terms of thinking of the theme and starting to lay

[24:58] out and then starting to get the programming people to think about, you know, rules and

[25:02] concepts and stuff like that has to start 18 months before they get to a point of actually

[25:08] having a reveal, probably, you know, six months later, they've got a white wood and maybe

[25:13] no artwork and then six months after that, they probably got some artwork and a mockup

[25:18] of a play field that they can probably flip and then, you know, you go 18 months out

[25:23] and all of a sudden they've got some prototypes and finished artwork and a game to be revealed.

[25:28] So I think it's conceivable that, you know, Joe's working on, um, you know, number three

[25:34] right now, fairly and deep and probably working on some basic things with the one after

[25:39] that.

[25:40] Having, having seen October, Fast and Houdini now, what's the one area you think they

[25:46] could use improvement on moving forward as they, as they go into games three and four?

[25:52] Uh, improvement.

[25:54] Okay.

[25:56] Integration, you know, this is a hard one for me because I think they do a really good

[26:01] job.

[26:02] Like when I talk to customers, I guess I'll always go back to this piece of what I do every

[26:05] day.

[26:06] Um, I think Jersey Jack has the best handle on integration of the LCD screen with the

[26:14] activity on the play field, um, meeting that the LCD screen is reacting to what's going

[26:20] on during the game and if people want to look up or people that are watching are watching

[26:25] the game, you know, they'll see things going on on the screen whether it's scoring, being

[26:30] highlighted or whether it's video clips or sounds.

[26:33] Um, I know that's not, you know, associated with the LCD screen, but animations maybe,

[26:38] you know, really being reactive to what's going on in the play field.

[26:41] And I think that's the beauty of the LCD screen.

[26:43] It's not just, and I'm going to pick on Stern here and, and I'm only picking on some

[26:47] of their first iterations when an LCD screen, you know, you take Arles Smith, you know, you

[26:51] got the cartoonish band members, you know, bouncing back and forth and that's the LCD

[26:55] animation.

[26:56] Now, obviously what games like Iron Maiden and with Deadpool, you know, they blow nose

[27:00] out of the water and the, you know, it's now more active and integrated, either with

[27:06] the game or more, you know, original, um, then the earlier one, Star Wars was just basically

[27:13] video clips with scores, superimposed on top of it.

[27:17] For American pinball, I think they fall in the middle of those two.

[27:20] I think American pinball does a really good job of integrating, um, for their first game,

[27:27] whereas it took Stern a few games with the LCD screen to actually utilize it properly.

[27:32] I think American pinball did a really good job with that up front.

[27:36] Uh, I do however feel that some of their animation work, not maybe not the animation work,

[27:41] but maybe integrating it is a little clunky and slow, um, in terms of, you know, and I

[27:49] know this was a criticism of Houdini that a lot of the animations stopped gameplay and

[27:55] you had a watch and I know, you know, you can flip the, you can hit the two flipper buttons

[27:59] and bypass stuff, but, um, they have to evolve that a little bit better with October

[28:06] 1st, uh, so that the animation doesn't become the focus and it becomes a snippet that happens

[28:13] really quick and then you're, you're back to the game where the game never gets interrupted.

[28:17] That would be, you know, my only, you know, not necessarily criticism, but something that

[28:23] I think has to evolve and that evolution happens from, with a company from one game to the

[28:29] next.

[28:30] I just mentioned about Stern with Star Wars and Aril Smith and how, you know, they were

[28:37] the way they were on those games and then they evolved to be, you know, better.

[28:41] You look at Jersey Jack.

[28:42] I tell people all the time when, you know, they're looking at, you know, the evolution of the

[28:47] Jersey Jack games, you look at the Wizard of Oz, which is an amazing game.

[28:52] We can't keep him a stock.

[28:53] I can't wait for them to rerun them again so we could sell them.

[28:56] You know, this is eight years later, this game is such a home run sales wise that, um, because

[29:02] of the theme and because of the game.

[29:04] But when you look at the animations, it's rudimentary, you know, it's, here's the scores.

[29:08] We've got four quadrants.

[29:10] Here's the scores and here's the scoring quadrants of what's going on on the game.

[29:14] And then when we want to show a video, we're going to take that away and then we're going

[29:16] to show a video.

[29:17] And then you just see the simple thing they did with, with, um, Hobbit, whereas you have

[29:24] the, you know, the beehive thing in the center that is always showing videos and then

[29:29] you've got the scoring on the exterior.

[29:32] And then obviously with dialed in, it took another evolution because that was, you know,

[29:37] there wasn't really movie clips or things to use there.

[29:40] You know, they created their own sim city and the scores are integrated along with that.

[29:45] And when I say things like, um, integrate it with the gameplay, you know, when I'm

[29:50] going to, when you shoot the phone and you get alien invasion or you get acid rain and

[29:56] you're have to shoot things on the play field.

[29:58] When you shoot something on the play field, you're going to see the reaction in terms of

[30:02] the meteors coming down or the acid rain falling on the LCD screen.

[30:06] And that is a true integration of the gameplay and the usage of the,

[30:10] I guess the question I have though because I, I, I've had this conversation with people

[30:14] many times is, but who's watching that when you're busy keeping your ball alive, playing

[30:20] the pen?

[30:22] And I do, I do see it happening, right?

[30:24] But I'm always curious.

[30:25] There's only so much time you can look up and there is so much emphasis happening now

[30:31] on the screens that I'm like, is this just meant for people who are watching someone plays

[30:37] enjoyment?

[30:38] No.

[30:38] And, and, you know, you have an owned a Jersey Jack.

[30:42] So you maybe haven't gotten, you know, a lot of time to play the game.

[30:49] And you, you kind of train yourself to keep sneaking those peaks up or if you want to

[30:54] watch a video clip, I'll find myself playing the game.

[30:57] And if I know I started a mode, I, I want to watch, you know, if I made the ramp that makes

[31:01] the acid rain, you know, fall, I'll peak up quick and watch that or I'm, I'm looking for

[31:06] scoring stuff.

[31:08] So no, are you watching it the whole time of course not because the game is in the play field,

[31:13] but there is, there is a manner that you'll start to play the game and you, you,

[31:18] get used to looking up at certain times.

[31:20] And it's not just when, you know, a ball gets locked and, and you have time to do that.

[31:25] There will be time during gameplay that if you make a long orbit shop, maybe you'll

[31:29] peak up real quick and it's, it's not that you're distracting yourself in the game.

[31:32] It just becomes a natural part of playing the game.

[31:35] You're, you know, you've got two things to look at.

[31:37] Is it your main focus?

[31:39] No, but I think when you own, you know, a game with an LCD screen where it's integrated

[31:45] like that, even if it's Houdini, there's a, there's a part of you that over time playing

[31:51] the game, you kind of learn to share where your eyes are.

[31:54] Okay.

[31:54] Now, I want to earn, I want to earn, I want to also own a Jersey Jack machine.

[32:01] And I'm excited.

[32:01] I think you will this year.

[32:02] I'm excited for the title.

[32:04] So I talk, let's talk about J.J.

[32:05] P. So first question is, how is Pirate selling?

[32:10] Pirate is actually doing very well.

[32:12] I mean, I'll be honest.

[32:14] Last year was, you know, last year was kind of a shit show with, you know,

[32:18] the spinning disc and the delay.

[32:20] It was hard and, and, you know, it's, it was hard for the company.

[32:24] It's hard for the distributors.

[32:26] And it was hard for, you know, the owners of the game and the buyers to have to wait

[32:30] that long and some of the excitement.

[32:32] Everybody knows.

[32:32] I mean, some of the excitement, you know, dissipated and went to other titles and it felt like

[32:37] the game was already out and it wasn't even out yet.

[32:42] So we had some lows in the action and, you know, some people that decided other games

[32:46] were they wanted something sooner than later and we had some councils and we had a

[32:49] lot of people that came back to Hobbit or I'm sorry, back to Pirate to the Caribbean

[32:54] once it was revealed.

[32:56] When it was in production and starting to ship, obviously we get a really big uptick

[33:02] from that because it's real and it's visible and people can get it.

[33:06] Maybe not readily available.

[33:08] People did want to get in line.

[33:10] The really good thing is that the sales have been really consistent.

[33:18] Very much like, you know, and I don't know that I've seen this with the Hobbit or dialed

[33:23] in.

[33:24] The Wizard of Oz was the same thing.

[33:26] It was very, once you know, you've got that initial excitement of the regular buyers

[33:31] that are going to buy it either a pre-order or the second group of regular buyers that

[33:35] are going to buy it when it's in production.

[33:38] I think the key of a success of a game is after those two groups are satisfied, who are

[33:45] the people that just end up deciding that it's a good game and want to buy it?

[33:50] That's like the third way.

[33:51] The third way for it's been very good.

[33:55] Do you wish Jack would have held back and given dialed in more of a runway?

[34:01] I think he was right about to catch that third wave.

[34:04] I mean, here's the next one, guys, then everyone's like, oh, yeah, we really want it.

[34:09] Not knowing it would be a year away.

[34:11] Yeah, I don't know if it really, I mean, I could tell you my opinion at the time.

[34:17] Yeah, I was arguing against revealing pirates and it had nothing to do with thinking that

[34:24] there was going to be that the later was, because none of us expected that or knew that

[34:27] at the time.

[34:29] Sales perspective were cannibalizing dialed in, which is exactly what you just said.

[34:35] The game is just going to start getting legs.

[34:37] Now that ended up not happening because of the delay with pirates.

[34:41] Dialed in still had the floor for a longer time than we anticipated.

[34:47] The sales of pirates have been good.

[34:49] Over the weekend, I just happened to be looking at some of my orders for the last month or

[34:54] two and they've been strong and they're consistent.

[34:59] Every week we're getting new people, the more, and that's what's going to happen is as

[35:03] the game gets out there in people's homes and friends come over and play as the game gets

[35:07] out there on locations and people play it.

[35:09] They realize what a great play field layout and how much stuff there is to do on the game,

[35:17] the rules, the game obviously is beautiful.

[35:20] I think it's a great title.

[35:22] It's probably my second favorite Jersey Jack game behind Wizard of Oz, which is just going

[35:28] to be special to me just because it's the first one.

[35:31] Is there any truth to the rumor that they're going to stop producing pirates in March?

[35:37] Yes.

[35:38] From what I know, yes.

[35:40] Okay.

[35:41] Now that is to make room on the line for the next title or to make Wizard of Oz rerun.

[35:49] Maybe yes, from a both.

[35:51] I don't know the exact answers.

[35:53] I can tell you that Wizard of Oz is coming and we're going to be doing a rerun of those

[36:00] about, I think Jack announced 250.

[36:03] I don't think I'm sure.

[36:04] Now, is it your own question I have about that because I think there's a lot of excitement

[36:06] that there's going to be a final run of WAS, 250.

[36:10] Don't ever say final because that title is over.

[36:14] It's never done.

[36:15] Well, a question, is it going to be, are they going to go more towards like a pro version

[36:20] of the game or it's going to be more affordable or are they going to make these a more even

[36:24] limited sort of exclusive collectible?

[36:29] I'll answer part of that that I can answer confidently.

[36:33] I don't think you're ever going to see, you know, they may prove me wrong at some point,

[36:37] but I don't think you're ever going to see a Jersey Jack game stripped down, features

[36:42] removed, rules different from one model to the next.

[36:47] So the rumor of the, in terms of pro model, the rumor of like the monkey being yanked out

[36:52] for a more reliable mech is false.

[36:57] There may be things that are going to be changed with the game and it's not for purposes

[37:03] of cost cutting.

[37:04] It's for purposes of reliability and certain mechs that, Chris, this game hasn't had

[37:12] well, other games don't have the opportunity to evolve because they're not usually on

[37:18] the sales block for as long anywhere near as long as the Wizard of Oz is because again,

[37:24] it's a great theme and it's a great game.

[37:29] So as it's just natural that as the game is out there in different iterations and different

[37:34] runs that if there's something that they see, maybe not necessarily that it's problematic

[37:40] that everybody has an issue with this, but if there's mechs that were maybe a little

[37:44] bit more complicated than they needed to be or a mechs that maybe always didn't succeed

[37:49] in doing what they were supposed to do for the player, why not make them simpler.

[37:53] So it's not a cost cutting thing and I've actually gotten this question asked a few times

[37:58] in the last couple of weeks where people are asking exactly what you asked me.

[38:02] Is there going to be a cheaper version, a knock down version, a pro version similar

[38:07] to what Stern does and is that what's coming?

[38:10] And no, no, that's not it's, there are going to be some changes.

[38:16] I'll leave it to Jersey Jack to specify exactly what they are, but whatever changes they're

[38:21] making, it's not cost cutting, it's to make reliability issues better.

[38:27] We've seen this happen with Stern when they vaulted Edition Spider-Man, they made adjustments

[38:32] to the game.

[38:33] Now that the game had been out for years, people forget Wizard of Oz was revealed to the

[38:38] world in 2013, right?

[38:41] Well, yeah, well, well, produced, revealed, well, announced in 2011, revealed sometime

[38:49] after that, but production in 2013.

[38:52] So, you know, this game's been for sale for almost eight years now.

[38:56] Right.

[38:57] So it only makes sense for them to now that they have all the information and, you know,

[39:03] if they've got parts to make it and to improve it, why not?

[39:06] Right.

[39:07] Why wouldn't you improve it?

[39:08] Why wouldn't you make it better?

[39:09] Why wouldn't you try to minimize service calls or things where the customer is saying something

[39:14] doesn't work, you know, the way it should on the game at all times.

[39:20] And I'm not saying there's a failure rate with anything that's excessive.

[39:23] As a matter of fact, I've honestly was a little surprised with some of the changes they're

[39:27] doing that, you know, I can't recall a lot of people complaining that, you know, things

[39:32] weren't 100%, you know, reliable at all times.

[39:36] And by reliability, I'm not saying that things are breaking down, that maybe that the intended

[39:40] aspect of the mechanics of the gameplay didn't happen only because there's certain things,

[39:46] whether it be a magnet or other things that, you know, that they work sometimes and sometimes

[39:51] they don't.

[39:52] Maybe the ball isn't in the exact position it needs to be for a magnet to pick it up.

[39:56] Right.

[39:57] You know, things like that.

[39:58] Which is in hit because there's not a, you know, a proper tolerance from, you know,

[40:03] when Jack said he was going to reveal two new games this year, is this was one of them

[40:11] or no, were you going to see?

[40:12] No.

[40:13] Okay.

[40:14] And so we always talk about and Joe, I know as a distributor, you want to see Jack reveal

[40:22] a game and be able to get people the game as quickly as the excitement is around the game.

[40:28] Right.

[40:29] So do you think he's learned the lesson that you can't, don't show it until you can

[40:36] ship it?

[40:37] Well, let me say this.

[40:40] I'll correct you in one aspect.

[40:44] And I've heard you say this on a lot of the podcast where you use Jack's name.

[40:48] And yes, Jack's the face of the company and yes, Jack a lot of times as the person, you

[40:53] know, up on a stage, announcing things or saying things.

[40:57] But, you know, Jack may not have been the driving factor behind announcing Pirates when

[41:03] it was announced.

[41:04] Well, yeah.

[41:05] And I've said that too.

[41:06] I said it.

[41:07] It was his, was Jack on the, was Jack on the stage?

[41:09] Yeah.

[41:10] No, his investor wanted to go and see, you know, I guess, see what the excitement was.

[41:17] And there was excitement.

[41:19] And I think it was, you know, it was a little bit of a premature ejaculation moment where

[41:23] like, yeah, it feels good.

[41:24] But like, it wasn't, it wasn't the right time.

[41:29] You know, and so I, like, I think I hope they've learned the lesson.

[41:32] And I think it's clear that, and we see this time and time again, when you have the right

[41:38] game at the, with the right reveal strategy, it's, it's a take my money now moment.

[41:44] And with the titles we're hearing, Guns and Rose's Toy Story in Wanka, probably in reverse

[41:50] order of that, people are excited, Joe.

[41:54] Like, I've, I've never seen people, you know, people as excited to see what's next from

[41:58] Jersey Jack as they are in 2019.

[42:02] I think, I think the next titles, you know, the themes at least coming out, you know,

[42:08] let's face it.

[42:09] They've got, they've got the people.

[42:13] You know, you got Keith doing programming.

[42:16] You've got Pat Lawler and Eric, who absolutely did an amazing job with his first, you know,

[42:23] first game.

[42:24] I'm Pirates of the Carrad being just bringing so much, you know, freshness, you know,

[42:29] no different than Keith L. Win did with Iron Maiden, which I think is an amazing playfield

[42:34] layout, whether you're a fan of the band or not.

[42:36] The game just shoots amazing, you know, Iron Maiden.

[42:39] And that's because Keith is fairly new to design and he's got some fresh approaches

[42:45] and it's not going to be, you know, the same game that you're used to be, you know, from

[42:51] I'm not going to name any designer names, but these are all great people.

[42:55] Keith game, you know, when you walk up to a tragedy game, you know, it's Steve Richie.

[42:58] When you walk up to Pat Lawler, you know, it's Pat Lawler because of certain shots and

[43:02] the way it's laid out.

[43:04] You know, you get guys like, you know, Eric and Keith, you know, new designers, it makes

[43:10] it exciting.

[43:11] But, you know, which Jersey Jack with the people and the designers and the programmers and,

[43:18] you know, you got JP, DeWayne on the animations who, you know, from the beginning has done

[43:26] an amazing job with that.

[43:28] I mean, he's got a great team of talented people.

[43:32] There's never any question without, you know, the only things that have always been the

[43:36] question marks and you bring this up, which is, you know, either the theme or the way he

[43:43] reveals the game and you always say if you get so far or the company gets so far and there's

[43:48] always something that keeps it, you know, all the games are home runs in my aspect, but

[43:53] there's always maybe something that keeps it from being a grand slam.

[43:55] And I think you're going to see a few grand slams this year from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[44:02] It's exciting.

[44:03] I mean, I think everyone's excited.

[44:04] I think this is going to be a watershed year for them if they can do it right.

[44:10] And I just hope I hope they just don't fuck up the reveal.

[44:15] You know, those lessons, and you know, and I tried to say what I said, you know, the way

[44:20] I said it in terms of, you know, you kept saying, and I hear you repeatedly on the podcast,

[44:26] saying, has Jacqueline just lessons, Jack?

[44:27] I mean, don't think that, you know, that was Jack's choice to do things with pirates,

[44:33] the way it was done.

[44:34] These maybe, maybe it wasn't.

[44:36] Yeah, yeah, but ultimately, I mean, but that's the, that's the, so there wasn't really

[44:42] a lesson, it wasn't really a lesson to be learned.

[44:44] It was more so of a, I told you so type of thing.

[44:47] Yeah, but it's the benefit and the downfall of, of when investors have control over the

[44:53] company as well, because it is called Jersey Jack, right?

[44:56] It's like Gary Stern's name is Gary Stern.

[44:58] Stern Pimball does something.

[45:00] Yeah, we, do we really think that Gary made that decision, right?

[45:04] And Gary's the one who's calling the shots over there.

[45:06] Absolutely not.

[45:07] It is the investors of the group.

[45:10] So look, for the, yes, I think Jack found himself in a position where as a salesperson,

[45:16] he probably knows that's not ideal.

[45:17] I just hope they learn their lesson this year.

[45:19] I think this could be a big year for them.

[45:21] So do you think, because we don't really know what's coming out from Stern in 2019.

[45:25] We hear the rumors of James Bond, Superman 78.

[45:29] Nothing, you know, a Virat III, nothing truly, I think groundbreaking.

[45:34] And even when I look at Stern's themes recently, I'm not really, you know, I'm not really

[45:39] seeing the same juggernaut level of themes that they've had before of Ghostbusters, Star Wars,

[45:46] Batman, you know, they sort of run into a, I think a thinner period of licenses.

[45:52] But we'll see, because do you think Superman 78 will be huge if that's even real or James

[45:58] Bond?

[45:59] I think it could be from the aspect of, you know, look at Batman.

[46:03] I mean, there's been other, you know, the thing that I don't love about that would be

[46:07] the repetitive nature of more superheroes and, you know, I mean, not that there's been,

[46:13] you know, Atari did the, the Superman game, you know, but it's just the continuance of

[46:21] every other game, you know, and music, and music and stuff like that.

[46:25] And again, there's a draw with it.

[46:28] You know, I do think that monsters was, you know, my personal opinion, I think that was

[46:36] a grand slam theme for them.

[46:40] Right.

[46:41] Well, see, I mean, like monsters is interesting because it is a little bit of a niche show.

[46:47] I think it doesn't have the same mainstream mass appeal.

[46:50] It's not a property that is, I don't want to say has an age to well, but it hasn't been

[46:56] relevant for so long.

[46:58] And so I think you have to love the monsters to want to own one.

[47:02] It definitely doesn't have the same fan base as a toy story or a Willy Wonka.

[47:09] So I think those are bigger.

[47:11] So let's talk about deep route because they are kind of like the, the Valkyrie boutique

[47:16] company coming out of like nowhere with a huge team with, you know, designer, you just

[47:23] use Valkyrie in a sentence.

[47:25] I know, right?

[47:26] Oh, it's impressive.

[47:27] I know.

[47:28] It's like the word of the day, every time I say Valkyrie.

[47:30] But do you like, okay, with Jersey Jack, you're saying two grand slam, you know, pins ready

[47:37] to go.

[47:38] We've now, you know, that's huge news or something to look forward to.

[47:41] Stern will never stop being Stern.

[47:43] They will keep hitting us with four to five titles, which we know they know how to get

[47:47] hype and excitement around.

[47:49] And then you've got Chicago gaming and then you've got American Pimbo and then you've

[47:53] got deep route, right?

[47:54] It just gets kind of crazy when you think about all them trying to jump into the ring.

[47:58] What do you think deep roots going to do?

[48:01] Oh, yeah, that's a good question.

[48:03] I really don't, I don't have, you know, I think anybody does have any insight information

[48:08] or knowledge, I think even other companies have been, you know, curious on what's going

[48:14] to come out.

[48:15] I think, you know, you hit the nail on the head and I don't remember what podcast or

[48:20] foot was you were a guest that said it.

[48:22] But I think these guys are either going to hit a massive home run and flip the table a

[48:27] little bit and make something a little unique and a little different that's still pinball,

[48:32] but a little different, you know, maybe similar, you know, I don't want to say it's going

[48:36] to be similar to like a pinball 2000, like revenge from Mars or, you know, the Star Wars

[48:43] game, but they have the, maybe the possibility to make something a little bit different in

[48:49] terms of what we're used to expecting a pinball machine to be, you know, whether that's

[48:54] with mechanics of the game or design or look at the game or size of the game, I don't

[49:00] know.

[49:01] I've heard some different things.

[49:02] What do you heard?

[49:04] You know, I could tell you the one thing I heard, you know, and maybe this isn't even,

[49:09] I shouldn't even say this because it's, it's nothing I heard about deep root, but I

[49:14] know that at some point in time, some of the people that were involved with deep root

[49:20] had made some, and I mentioned the size of the game that they had made some for other

[49:25] companies had floated some ideas of different cabinet designs that aren't really your standard

[49:32] pinball cabinet designs, and there's some curiosity as to whether some of those ideas from

[49:38] the people that are now employed by deep root are going to be what we're going to see.

[49:43] That's going to be a little bit different.

[49:44] I'm not saying that's good or bad, but I know they were, you know, they were different.

[49:49] They were really out there indifferent and whether that would be accepted or not or

[49:53] whether it would be a really cool thing.

[49:55] I mean, and again, you look at pin 2000, it's a different pinball shape than, you know,

[50:01] pinballs were and continue to be, and it did well, and it was an incredible platform

[50:06] that introduced something new.

[50:07] But it also got destroyed in sales by family guy, came out the same time, and I think

[50:14] Stern learned a lesson then too, because you had all this new tech and innovation, right,

[50:18] and just like a good theme that looked like pinball, like trumped it, right?

[50:23] So I think Robert, you know, his main games and his own collection, his personal collection

[50:29] are Valley Williams games.

[50:30] I think he's, he's not going to go too radical.

[50:33] I think if you've watched anything happen in this pinball industry of the last 10 years,

[50:38] everyone who's tried to innovate too much has failed so hard.

[50:43] The modular system at highway pinball, P3.

[50:45] Am I missing anything else?

[50:48] I mean, you know, I'm saying like, I think Jersey Jack, he did, he made pinball look a

[50:53] little bit more modern, but it was still pinball.

[50:56] Correct.

[50:57] Right.

[50:58] Someone else has done that as well, and I don't think you need to go like radically different.

[51:05] So, and also, you know, for collectors, Joe, you don't want a game that stands out in

[51:12] the wrong way like a sore thumb in your lineup.

[51:16] You know, if you radically change the dimensions of pinball or the cabinet, it's going to look

[51:20] weird when he gets home.

[51:24] I don't know if I agree with that.

[51:26] I mean, if you, if something comes out that is unique and different and it's still a pinball

[51:33] machine, I mean, does it have to be three and, you know, you know, two feet wide and five

[51:39] and a half feet long?

[51:40] I mean, is that my favorite was when Papa do you expect years making the Zidware games

[51:44] and he, he made it a longer cabinet and then he couldn't find class to fit it anywhere.

[51:50] It just like came up short.

[51:53] All right.

[51:54] I think, I think they're going to, I don't think for all the investment and all the energy

[52:01] that, you know, Robert Mueller has put into the company and I commend him for the people

[52:07] that he's hired, the number of people and, you know, also hiring, you know, and, and

[52:14] factoring in people that are doing storyboards and, you know, I mentioned earlier about the

[52:18] storyline aspect to a game.

[52:20] I mean, you know, I think that could be a really cool, you know, aspect of their games

[52:26] if other companies are maybe not, you know, playing on that as much as maybe he is and

[52:32] integrating some, you know, some things that are done with video games and role playing

[52:37] games and stuff like that that are popular now.

[52:40] I think that.

[52:41] Getting you more into the game and whether there's technology in some manner that can be

[52:47] integrated.

[52:48] I'm interested to see what they come up with.

[52:50] I think that's where I don't see innovation is more in how the coding and pinball, the

[52:57] pinball experience happens and what I mean by that.

[53:00] I think we're going to see stuff where you can continue from where you left off.

[53:05] I think we're going to see just maybe some internet connectivity.

[53:08] I think we're going to see some stuff that is long overdue in terms of pinball and, you

[53:14] know, it's even like a pinball game.

[53:16] Why can't you start a pinball game in 2019 and pick beginner, medium, or expert when

[53:21] you start the game?

[53:23] True.

[53:24] Right.

[53:25] I mean, that's all software.

[53:27] Why do I have to go, how old school and sort of arcane is it to have to go into the

[53:37] menu system, go to adjustments and do like each thing individually, you know, like because

[53:42] you can change all that like manually, like it takes this many shots to complete each

[53:46] mode in Batman, but why not just auto program it on different levels for skill level.

[53:53] Anyway, I think we're going to see stuff like that.

[53:54] But when do you think deep root, when do you think they're going to reveal themselves

[53:58] to the world?

[54:00] Because TPS is no longer a no go now.

[54:03] Yeah, I know.

[54:04] And then it's like I was looking, I was so looking forward to it the five days.

[54:08] Yeah, it's crazy.

[54:09] And you know, I probably just say it's crazy even that, you know, it's in their backyard

[54:15] and not to, but if it's not ready, it's not ready.

[54:18] I mean, if they're not done or they're not satisfied, you know, it's big stakes.

[54:24] I mean, you don't want to, you know, come out with the game and not have prototyping or

[54:29] not have, they're coming out with multiple titles and, you know, have one when promising

[54:35] four, you know, three, maybe at first launch, you want to do it right.

[54:40] So I commend them for, you know, I'm sure it was a hard decision, but I do commend them

[54:45] for standing back and looking at, you know, where they were going to be at that point

[54:50] in time and making decision early enough to not hurt the show.

[54:55] And I'm sure they had maybe a lot of boot space reserved and, you know, not hurt the

[55:00] show or not have people purchase tickets specifically, you know, obviously there's other

[55:05] reasons people go, but, you know, you don't want to kick back that the week before the

[55:11] show, they something that was supposed to be big there that maybe people were traveling

[55:15] to for their first time traveling out of town for a show and taking a flight wasn't going

[55:19] to happen.

[55:20] So, you know, I'm, I'm commend them.

[55:22] It was done well, well in advance.

[55:23] And I don't think that hurts them in any way.

[55:26] I don't think it negates anything.

[55:27] Yeah, and it opens the door for the competitors to have a little bit more space to have, you

[55:35] know, have less competition.

[55:36] So, but what's interesting is with deep root bailing out on T.P.F.

[55:41] I'm looking at the show and I'm like, I don't really feel like anything is going to

[55:45] be revealed.

[55:46] I mean, we might get the new Waz game, which could steal the show there because what else?

[55:51] I mean, it really could be October, Fess and Waz are the two new things in terms of

[55:58] real.

[55:59] Yeah, it will be.

[56:00] I mean, October, Fess is going to be, you know, even though people know it's coming and

[56:06] it was shown at, you know, at Expo in October, you know, you're going to get a whole

[56:12] other section of the country and maybe different people that don't go to Expo experiencing

[56:17] that game for the first time.

[56:18] So I think it's going to be a good coming out party and great timing for American pinball

[56:24] in terms of sales and exposure and excitement and there's nothing else new at there at the

[56:28] show.

[56:29] And then obviously, you know, Wizard of Oz is going to have a resurgence, you know, reintroduction

[56:35] there.

[56:36] But yeah, there's, you know, I mentioned it earlier.

[56:39] I mean, there's going to be, which is unusual in this hobby with so many players now.

[56:44] We're in a low period in terms of which is good because it's good that October, Fess is

[56:49] going to have a platform to get legs with.

[56:53] It's going to be good whenever Jersey Jack, which I think will be shortly thereafter, you

[56:58] know, maybe sometime late spring, you know, for their next game reveal.

[57:03] And I think you've got to get away from thinking, because trust me, I hear this from companies

[57:09] constantly is as great as the shows are for our community and the hobby.

[57:15] I don't think the companies and that could have been part of the hang up with pirates.

[57:22] Companies got to start not looking at shows to be the launching pad for a game and rushing

[57:27] something, you know, because there's a show coming.

[57:31] And I think that's exactly what happened.

[57:32] I mean, the car is the car.

[57:33] It happened to Chuck.

[57:34] I mean, well, great.

[57:36] It's almost a year later with that, right?

[57:39] And how I think he would have been much more confident and excited to reveal a game that

[57:45] had much further along code that he, you know, you could sense when they were up there,

[57:51] they knew it was really early.

[57:53] Well, there was also a time frame with Alice and the license with that as well.

[57:59] There were some things going on with Alice Cooper, right?

[58:03] But it's just weird because like you do it and I think you're right though.

[58:06] I think look, this also for a lot of these companies, if their goal is to sell 500 or 1000

[58:12] games, you don't have to spend the money going around to a lot of shows.

[58:17] You've got Pinside, you've got other ways to get people, you reveal, you've got Twitch,

[58:22] you've got things that you're disposal to get the word out.

[58:25] You also have the ability to create high definition, high res images and get people excited

[58:30] and reveal it with the media.

[58:32] You can do a lot and do it when the timing is right.

[58:36] The old way of doing it are the shows because the shows were meant to sell in to operators.

[58:42] And they were scheduled those, you know, it was all expo for the most part.

[58:46] It was like scheduled to be an operator trade show that those days are gone.

[58:52] There's no longer is that what am I buying to put in my arcade next year?

[58:56] It's for the home collector for the most part.

[59:01] Yes, there are still operators for sure.

[59:04] But if I'm American Pimball, I'm showing up to Tpf with 10 games and boxes at my booth.

[59:10] Yep.

[59:11] And they surely will.

[59:14] You look at Stern, Stern doesn't buy by, they're right there in Chicago, they don't

[59:19] buy by the show schedule.

[59:21] They purposely reveal around the shows now.

[59:24] You notice that?

[59:25] It's always like, well, like right after, or right before they know.

[59:31] Why bother?

[59:32] Yeah, and I don't know it's an avoidance per se.

[59:36] You know, maybe in some respect, I do hear some chatter from companies wanting to see

[59:41] what else is being revealed.

[59:43] And if it's a crowded, you know, if it's going to be a crowded field at a particular show,

[59:48] then that can be problematic because you don't want to lose your steam or get lost in

[59:52] the shuffle and stuff like that.

[59:55] Right.

[59:56] You know, you'll be down at Tpf, right?

[59:59] Yes.

[01:00:00] Okay.

[01:00:01] Well, I got a check.

[01:00:05] If I can't make it, I might ask you to represent me at the Twippy Awards of that Saturday

[01:00:10] night.

[01:00:11] Did you vote?

[01:00:13] Yes, of course I voted.

[01:00:15] Okay.

[01:00:16] I don't have that for you.

[01:00:17] You voted for me, thank you.

[01:00:18] I did, of course.

[01:00:19] There's one.

[01:00:20] There's one legitimate vote we can count because he said it on air.

[01:00:24] It'll be a fun show.

[01:00:25] I'm really excited to see Jeff and Zach and Greg put on a live award show.

[01:00:31] I think it's, you know, people are getting like too serious about the whole thing.

[01:00:35] I mean, it's really just a night to celebrate Pimball and everything we love about it.

[01:00:40] And no one's a loser.

[01:00:41] And no, you know, you make the short list of all these games in terms of fan favorites.

[01:00:47] The top three in every category should be proud.

[01:00:50] I mean, there's a lot of good stuff happening in the hobby right now.

[01:00:54] I don't, I don't disagree.

[01:00:56] I think it's going to be a good year.

[01:00:58] I think Stern started off fantastic with monsters.

[01:01:01] I, you know, again, maybe you disagree.

[01:01:03] I think they did an incredible job with the theme.

[01:01:07] I think the artwork from Chris Franci is amazing.

[01:01:11] I absolutely love the black and white version.

[01:01:15] And I'm going to answer your question.

[01:01:16] You posed, which I was really perplexed that you, you know, even asked this question

[01:01:22] and we're curious why they did it, putting the black and white version on the premium versus

[01:01:27] the LE.

[01:01:28] I mean, think about it.

[01:01:30] If that's the, if that's the attention getter and maybe one that people are going to

[01:01:35] think is really cool and want, the LE sell out.

[01:01:39] So once they're done, they're done.

[01:01:41] So why not put something as unique as that on the premium that there's no limit to?

[01:01:47] Yeah, no, but I do think, look, I, I think out of the two options though, it's definitely

[01:01:52] the more polarizing.

[01:01:54] So people, either people either love it or don't love it.

[01:01:59] I don't think people are like, everyone's not universally saying it's great.

[01:02:02] Like, I also think the LE though should always be the most unique, holy cow.

[01:02:07] Like, I get what I spent my money on.

[01:02:09] And I think companies struggle with that because to your point, right, Joe is like, well,

[01:02:14] if you make it too good, you only have a finite amount of chances to make money on it.

[01:02:19] And then you're kind of like screwed in a way, you've left money on the table, but it's,

[01:02:24] it's finding that balance.

[01:02:25] I mean, we know that I hope Jack is the other thing with Jack.

[01:02:29] I hope he reevaluates the way he does his collectors, his limits and his, you know, standards.

[01:02:36] I don't even, because to your point, I don't even think there is like a such a thing as

[01:02:38] a standard Jersey Jack pinball machine.

[01:02:41] We don't sell many of them.

[01:02:42] I'll be honest with you.

[01:02:44] I still haven't think there's anything wrong with them, but it's just like, you, you

[01:02:48] will get operators, you know, we'll sell them the locations that obviously are looking

[01:02:52] to make the money back.

[01:02:53] But for the most part, when you look at, you know, what you're getting, you know, when

[01:03:00] you get the Invisit glass and you get shaker motor at it and you get the powder coated

[01:03:05] trim and a topper.

[01:03:06] It's a no brain.

[01:03:07] You're, you're getting your thousand dollars extra of stuff and then you get the collectability

[01:03:12] aspect.

[01:03:13] Do you think Jack made a mistake?

[01:03:16] Because this is similar to monsters with the, you know, where to put the value, not allowing

[01:03:22] the Ellie guys to buy the topper with the ship in the bottle.

[01:03:26] No, not at all.

[01:03:28] And I will say that there was, I, the, the first phone call I got, I don't even think

[01:03:33] X-Bot was over is I got a call from Jack and Jetsett, I got to take your temperature

[01:03:38] on a couple things.

[01:03:39] One of them is this topper.

[01:03:40] He goes, do we sell it after, you know, do we sell it to the Ellie models?

[01:03:46] There was such a, you know, such an incredible, I think it's probably one of the best toppers

[01:03:50] ever made the ship moving and just a little like straights.

[01:03:54] A little noisy.

[01:03:55] Yeah, a little noisy.

[01:03:56] Yeah.

[01:03:57] But it's just a great design on the topper.

[01:04:00] So obviously there was a lot of clamoring and don't think that the company didn't look

[01:04:05] at it and realize that they can make a boatload of money by selling these toppers.

[01:04:11] You know, look, look, Stern sells there as they do for, they get what are under bucks,

[01:04:15] 500 bucks for toppers that.

[01:04:17] And now, yeah, now getting embarrassingly like, I saw the Deadpool once, 400 bucks are

[01:04:21] just like a piece of plastic.

[01:04:23] I'm like, my God.

[01:04:24] That's that's how much in that PlayStation 4 cost.

[01:04:26] Yeah.

[01:04:27] We could have sold these toppers and made some money and there was some discussion internally

[01:04:32] with the company immediately after that, you know, what do we do?

[01:04:36] And they made what I think is the right choice by the buyers in that the people that are

[01:04:42] spending and it's not, you know, it's not like they spend 500 bucks more.

[01:04:45] They're spending 3000 more.

[01:04:47] They're getting a collector's edition.

[01:04:49] They're buying it and most of those people are buying it because they want to be, you

[01:04:53] say it a lot.

[01:04:54] They want to be part of that exclusive club that they've got something that somebody else

[01:04:57] doesn't have.

[01:04:58] They've got the coolest features on a game that they can get.

[01:05:02] They got things that are limited and I think it would have been extremely disrespectful to

[01:05:06] the people that support that tier of pricing and put that much money down to say then,

[01:05:13] you know, hey, thanks for your purchase.

[01:05:15] But you know what, over here we can make a lot of money by selling this really cool thing

[01:05:21] that we know you like and you're still going to get it.

[01:05:23] But you know, all that intangible stuff that excites you about spending that extra money

[01:05:28] that, you know, you're giving to us, we're going to make, we're going to make that, we're

[01:05:33] going to sell it and we're going to make it a bill.

[01:05:35] And so talking to a guy who, you know, my Dodge Demon wide body, they now slap the wide

[01:05:41] body look on every single model of the challenger like all the way down to the Skat Pack and it's

[01:05:46] just, it loses some of like the appeal.

[01:05:50] But let me ask you one last question, Joe, because we're at the hour point.

[01:05:53] When you look at Jack's games and you look at Stern Ali's and you see how Stern Ali's

[01:05:57] fly off the shelf, do you still think Jack is just underpriced or is Stern just way overpriced?

[01:06:03] Because I just, I can't look at both of those games at 9 grand and be like something's

[01:06:08] off.

[01:06:09] Well, yeah, there's a disparity there in the product for sure there is.

[01:06:15] You know, you look at the size of the LCD, you look at, you know, the toys and the

[01:06:20] little materials and the features and the mechanisms on the game.

[01:06:24] Yeah, they're different.

[01:06:25] You know, that's nothing against Stern.

[01:06:27] I think the games are great.

[01:06:29] But I don't think, you know, what's the price of a Stern Ali?

[01:06:34] I mean, 9 grand.

[01:06:37] And but okay, maybe is that their MSRP or what's their, what's their 8995?

[01:06:42] What's the minimum price is that that's the price now?

[01:06:45] Yeah, I mean, there's no like that.

[01:06:46] The air of like street prices gone now too.

[01:06:48] That's pretty much your penny.

[01:06:49] Maybe you had a couple hundred bucks off, but for the most part, we're looking at 9 grand

[01:06:54] out the door.

[01:06:55] And that's pretty much what pirates Ali is what 9500?

[01:07:00] 95, yeah.

[01:07:01] So I was thinking maybe the Sterns would be around 85 or something like that, you know,

[01:07:06] with their minimum price, which everybody sells out.

[01:07:08] See, what it hurts from?

[01:07:10] We heard from Nick Parks.

[01:07:11] I mean, it sounds like these games are only costing Stern.

[01:07:16] They definitely are costing them much less to make.

[01:07:18] The bomb on a Stern machine versus a Jack machine, that's got to be worlds apart.

[01:07:25] Right.

[01:07:26] And I think Jack's margins can't be nearly as good as Stern's margins on the Ali.

[01:07:30] The Ali's are just gravy train for Stern.

[01:07:34] You know, that's why they want to sell those out as fast as possible, right?

[01:07:37] Get them out the doors as fast as possible before people can change their mind and realize

[01:07:43] that they might not be getting 9k worth in it, right?

[01:07:45] Because that is all hype driven the Ali.

[01:07:50] To an extent, sure.

[01:07:51] Right.

[01:07:52] So, yeah.

[01:07:53] But in the same respect, you're going to get some intangible stuff from Stern, you know,

[01:07:58] how many employees do they have there?

[01:08:00] 300, 400?

[01:08:01] Right.

[01:08:02] Working there every single day.

[01:08:03] I mean, building materials of what goes into the product isn't the only cost that the

[01:08:07] company has to make.

[01:08:09] Make the game.

[01:08:10] It's also the size of their facility.

[01:08:11] It's their employees.

[01:08:12] How many people would get there as a Jack Joe?

[01:08:15] I don't know that number.

[01:08:19] Like 50?

[01:08:21] I don't think it's, I mean, it's not the numbers that Stern has, of course.

[01:08:25] Right.

[01:08:26] Okay.

[01:08:27] And in terms of production, have you, I said that was my last question.

[01:08:30] One last question.

[01:08:31] Do you want Jack?

[01:08:32] Do you feel like production has been slow on pirates?

[01:08:34] Are you expecting to ramp up and get a little bit more efficient as we move forward?

[01:08:37] Because these hot titles are going to, you know, orders are going to be rolling in.

[01:08:40] And do you want, are they going to be able to sort of satiate those orders quickly this

[01:08:44] time around?

[01:08:45] I think it's, I think production has been pretty consistent with pirates.

[01:08:51] I don't know.

[01:08:52] There's been no stoppages or starts with, like on a weekly basis, how many games can that

[01:08:58] factory turn out?

[01:09:00] You know, I should know that answer and I don't, I'd be guessing.

[01:09:05] Because Stern, I think at capacity is like 50 games a day.

[01:09:08] Yeah.

[01:09:09] It's not 50 a day.

[01:09:10] I mean, I, I, that I know.

[01:09:12] It's not 50.

[01:09:14] 50 a week maybe.

[01:09:15] I know it's more than that a week, you know, and again, I hate to even gas because then,

[01:09:20] you know, I don't say the right now.

[01:09:21] I mean, either homework, I want you to find out next time we talk.

[01:09:24] I'll just make a call.

[01:09:25] I'll make a call and ask the question.

[01:09:27] I do have one thing for you before we go.

[01:09:29] Sure.

[01:09:30] I hear you talk.

[01:09:31] I told you when you text me and said, hey, you know, can you do the podcast?

[01:09:35] I told you I was going to challenge you a little bit.

[01:09:37] You always seem to have a reoccurring theme in a lot of conversations about different

[01:09:43] things of a hobby, whether it's pricing or companies and what they're doing.

[01:09:48] You know, I'm going to challenge you on this because I really disagree like from where

[01:09:52] I sit.

[01:09:53] I really disagree with your, you know, and I want to admit, you know, maybe it's not

[01:09:58] your true thinking, but you keep always saying that the hobby is filled with rich people.

[01:10:04] And that's who's buying these games.

[01:10:06] That's who these companies are making the games for.

[01:10:09] That's who's making them successful.

[01:10:10] And Chris, it's not.

[01:10:11] I mean, you know, you mentioned a lot about millionaires and, you know, the number of people

[01:10:16] are there really rich people that do extremely well in life that love pinball and can

[01:10:22] afford to buy the games and can afford to buy the LEs and the collector's editions and

[01:10:27] stuff like that and buy every game or multiple titles a year.

[01:10:30] Yeah, of course, there's a lot of people like that.

[01:10:33] I have plenty of them as customers of mine.

[01:10:35] They're great people, but they're also, you know, they're just pinball people.

[01:10:41] Right.

[01:10:42] And there are, you know, the numbers of games that we sell and the number of customers

[01:10:48] that I have that are not those people far, far outweigh the people that are just buying

[01:10:54] the games because they have the money and it's just money to burn.

[01:10:57] I have so many people that are just love pinball and they make really hard decisions when

[01:11:04] so many titles are coming out, which one that year that is going to be the one game

[01:11:09] that they're going to buy and they're the people that are playing in tournaments or the

[01:11:14] people that are going to shows and they're a real big part of the people buying games.

[01:11:22] The new family is coming in.

[01:11:23] They may not have the intention to buy six or seven games, you know, over time, you know,

[01:11:29] some of them gravitate to that and they get the bug like a lot of us have.

[01:11:33] But a lot of those newbies coming in, they've just maybe drawn into, you know, we want

[01:11:37] to buy one or two games for a family or kids are growing up and, you know, we kind of

[01:11:42] played it and we, you know, we like it.

[01:11:44] We don't think we're going to be nuts about it and they're expensive.

[01:11:48] But, you know, so I kind of wanted to get, right, challenge you a little bit on that.

[01:11:51] Because I hear it repeatedly from you about millionaires and rich people driving this hobby

[01:11:59] and I really disagree with that.

[01:12:01] Well, do you think, well, and Joe, first of all, I appreciate that insight, right, because

[01:12:08] from where I sit in my-

[01:12:09] As a listener.

[01:12:10] As a listener.

[01:12:11] Yeah, no, and from where I sit in my, you know, one bedroom apartment in New York City,

[01:12:15] I'm not interacting every day with pinball buyers.

[01:12:18] I mean, that is why I love having people like you come on the show to provide that kind

[01:12:22] of insight, right?

[01:12:23] And I think sometimes my circle of friends within the hobby are more of like the collectors

[01:12:28] and I get a little bit-

[01:12:29] Sure.

[01:12:30] Probably the jaded point of view because, you know, I know guys who can buy like 10 pins on

[01:12:36] a whim and not have to care.

[01:12:37] But obviously, at the volume they're selling these games out, you know, there has to be

[01:12:43] a more of a middle class purchaser of the pinball machine.

[01:12:46] I would have to say, like, if you're below the middle class and you're buying these new

[01:12:50] games, there probably is something you're doing wrong financially to do that though.

[01:12:55] Even if you love pinball, I do hope people are not, you know, spending a large amount

[01:13:02] of their savings on pinball machines.

[01:13:04] I do think there's just a, you know, and but again, like that, we have one life people

[01:13:08] make their decisions with their money.

[01:13:09] I'm not here to tell people how to spend their money.

[01:13:13] But I guess the thing is then in terms of what's driving it though, I mean, obviously it

[01:13:19] is the more fluent customer Joe that's driven the prices up.

[01:13:25] No, it's not.

[01:13:26] But then who drove the prices up?

[01:13:28] We all did.

[01:13:30] We all did.

[01:13:31] Okay.

[01:13:32] Okay.

[01:13:33] So then I guess my question for you, Joe, then have we all sort of shot ourselves in the

[01:13:38] foot by continuing to buy without really looking at these, some of these games being like,

[01:13:46] is the value there because when I look at the way Stern's elite prices have jumped and

[01:13:51] skyrocketed and yet features are pulled out of games and we're still buying.

[01:13:56] So either we're not rich, then we're pretty stupid on some level to keep the gobbling

[01:14:01] up.

[01:14:02] Right.

[01:14:03] You know, let's face it, we go back in, you know, and I'll go back to a time when Stern

[01:14:08] was the only player and there weren't Ellie models and different models.

[01:14:13] You know, I've been doing this 20 years.

[01:14:16] You know, I was buying new unboxed games from Stern.

[01:14:18] You know, whatever it was, the original piracy, the Caribbean, Spider-Man, you even just

[01:14:22] go back, you know, 10 years or 12 years, there were 4500 bucks.

[01:14:27] That was a new price of a new game.

[01:14:30] I'm going to tell you what happened and what happened is the Ellie model happened and the

[01:14:37] Ellie model was a brainchild of Jack to be honest with you when Jack was a distributor.

[01:14:45] The Stern hit the business grand slam and they said, well, you know, we're going to make

[01:14:51] an Ellie model and it's going to be the same thing that you got before and we're going

[01:14:57] to do something, you know, and the Ellie models weren't what they were today with the powder

[01:15:02] coating.

[01:15:03] Maybe they did like an Elvis and they put some gold trim on and stuff like that.

[01:15:06] But, you know, it was just very slight differentiation.

[01:15:09] It wasn't, you know, drastically there weren't, you know, there wasn't a meered backlash

[01:15:15] you were getting.

[01:15:16] There wasn't, you know, sparkle in the powder coating.

[01:15:19] It was, this one's going to be gold and that's it.

[01:15:22] You know, lower the rings, Elvis, you know, Spider-Man, Black, you know, different little

[01:15:26] things like that that they did on those early games.

[01:15:29] But the Ellie game at that point, and I know people on Pinsite keep track of what the

[01:15:33] price of games for and it be interesting to go back and look.

[01:15:36] I always, and I, from a business perspective, I admire it and I admire that they got

[01:15:41] away with it.

[01:15:42] But what Stern did is they made an Ellie game.

[01:15:44] They were selling games for $4,500 bucks.

[01:15:46] Day in and day out, every game was around that range, $4,000 to $5,000, new in box, titles

[01:15:52] we know, you know, Pirates of Caribbean, Wheel of Fortune, you know, mid 2000 era games.

[01:16:00] And then they came out with the Ellie and the Ellie's all of a sudden became $6,000 or

[01:16:05] $6,500 at that point.

[01:16:07] Then the backside of that, which was genius, is we're also going to make a pro version,

[01:16:12] which is a game that we're going to take stuff off it.

[01:16:16] And this is going to be quote unquote, gear to the operators.

[01:16:19] You know what that game was?

[01:16:20] It was the same game you were buying before, which stuff taken off.

[01:16:23] But you know what the price was?

[01:16:24] $4,500.

[01:16:25] Right.

[01:16:27] They not only they won on both sides of the coin, they ended up taking stuff off a game

[01:16:33] and selling it for the same price.

[01:16:34] And you said this was Jack's idea.

[01:16:35] Was this when Jack was over there?

[01:16:36] No, no, I'm not saying it was Jack's depressing stuff or anything like that with Stern.

[01:16:41] But the whole Ellie thing, all that stuff was Jack.

[01:16:45] And again, I admire Jack for his ingenuity in terms of salesmanship and doing something

[01:16:50] unique and creating excitement.

[01:16:55] I know for a fact that, you know, I think the Elvis thing with the gold was Jack's idea.

[01:17:00] The gold Lord of the Rings was absolutely Jack's idea.

[01:17:03] The Shrek from Family Guy to re-themed that because it was possibly a hard game to sell.

[01:17:10] So basically Joe would happen to summarize.

[01:17:13] And I think Jack as a distributor led to the Ellie movement and Stern started with it slowly

[01:17:20] doing some of his little stuff.

[01:17:22] Ultimately would happen and we're still living in that era today, which is they learned

[01:17:28] that they can make changes that would just cost them a few hundred dollars and charge

[01:17:34] a few thousand dollars.

[01:17:35] And we will eat it up every day of the week.

[01:17:39] So here we are.

[01:17:40] I don't think we're right now.

[01:17:41] I don't think the companies, Stern, Jersey Jack pricing or anybody that priced with their

[01:17:46] game anywhere are doing anything.

[01:17:50] Obviously the first rule of business and marketing is you got to price it in that sweet

[01:17:54] spot where you're going to get a good number of sales and you're going to get adequate margin.

[01:18:01] You price it too low.

[01:18:02] You're going to sell too many for too less profit and that's not good.

[01:18:05] You price it too high.

[01:18:07] You're going to be sent with inventory in a box, which isn't good either.

[01:18:11] The market will find that breaking point for price and thus far there hasn't been a

[01:18:17] breaking point.

[01:18:19] Everybody says, well when's the bubble going to burst?

[01:18:21] I don't think there is a bubble because of the reasons that I mentioned earlier, everybody

[01:18:27] expects that the pinball buying market is the people on Pinside.

[01:18:31] I laugh at that.

[01:18:32] It's not, trust me, I sell the majority of my games to many people that don't even know

[01:18:37] what Pinside is or care what Pinside is.

[01:18:42] They may go there for information once in a while but they don't live on it.

[01:18:45] They're not involved with threads and keeping up with them every day.

[01:18:49] They think or another group of people may think that the tournament players, the circle

[01:18:54] that they're in, that that's pinball and it's not.

[01:18:58] There's so many different aspects of different types of collectors that myself as a distributor,

[01:19:03] I see them because I interact with them because all these groups buy games.

[01:19:08] You got the tournament guys and they buy certain types of games or certain price point

[01:19:11] games.

[01:19:12] You got the collector guys that, hey, they want the most expensive thing that's out there

[01:19:16] that's exclusive.

[01:19:17] You got the families and the new people that want just, they really want to take their time.

[01:19:22] They want to buy the best game.

[01:19:24] They want to go try them out.

[01:19:26] There's people with maybe not a lot of money that are only going to buy a few.

[01:19:29] There's a whole mess of people there and the hobby continues to grow.

[01:19:34] You see it more?

[01:19:35] It sounds like the majority of buyers are more of your casual game room purchaser.

[01:19:46] I think it's 50-50.

[01:19:47] I think you're going to get 50% of the people that are really passionate and it's something

[01:19:52] that, you know, like you and me involved, you know, we're doing something with pinball

[01:19:57] every day.

[01:19:58] We're thinking about it.

[01:19:59] We're Jones and about it.

[01:20:00] We're excited about it.

[01:20:02] And then there's people that buy the games and they may do a single code update.

[01:20:07] Right, exactly.

[01:20:08] No, it happens.

[01:20:09] And they don't know what they're missing because they don't know what they're supposed

[01:20:13] to have anyway.

[01:20:15] There's people that I sell games to and I don't hear from them for three years and they'll

[01:20:18] call me back and say, well, I've had this game for three years.

[01:20:22] What's new has there been?

[01:20:24] Sometimes I struggle.

[01:20:25] Has there been anything else new since I bought the Wizard of Oz in 2015 and I blow their

[01:20:30] mind?

[01:20:31] Well, yeah, I got 50 choices for it.

[01:20:34] So there's people are living the dream, Joe.

[01:20:38] They're not going to curse me every day thinking about it.

[01:20:42] They're not going to zoom by it.

[01:20:43] Right.

[01:20:44] Like I was saying something to a friend today.

[01:20:45] I was like, look, if you just don't go on pin sign, if you just don't go, you won't

[01:20:50] ever wake up and hear any news about a new pinball machine anywhere.

[01:20:55] Unless you're again, like connecting the friends on Facebook who are all in a pinball,

[01:21:00] but if you just don't go to a certain few places and don't, you know, if you get off a social

[01:21:05] media, you're not going to walk down the street and see a new pinball machine in the window

[01:21:09] or read a new story about a new pinball game.

[01:21:11] It just doesn't happen.

[01:21:14] It's so nice.

[01:21:16] It is, but it's, but it's, but it's growing and when you're not going to see it on like

[01:21:22] the Grammys, you're like, you see the celebrity game room.

[01:21:25] It's just, you just don't see it as much.

[01:21:27] But anyway, I think that's a, I think you bring up a really good point.

[01:21:31] Now, look, I guess my question back to you is who is driving the market and is, are any

[01:21:41] manufacturers out there?

[01:21:42] You think, I mean, hitting that market on the head or in the bulls eye, I mean, obviously

[01:21:49] Stern is doing it the best because they do have the, they have something for 5,000 or

[01:21:54] 9,000 of the same theme.

[01:21:57] Doesn't that help them?

[01:21:59] Sure it does.

[01:22:00] I mean, yeah, yeah, Jack is like, you got to spend a ton and then you got to spend a

[01:22:05] ton more if you're like a collector, like 12,500.

[01:22:08] At that point, you've got to be somewhat rich.

[01:22:10] I'm sorry.

[01:22:11] Stern hits all aspects of people with pricing and they develop a client base based on that.

[01:22:19] I think the other thing that Stern does really good is, you know, with, with the marketing

[01:22:25] and, you know, I think Zach Sharp is doing a really good job.

[01:22:31] You know, obviously a lot of the tournament stuff, but look at all the exposure.

[01:22:34] I'm always really impressed when they come out with their launch party list and, you

[01:22:39] know, I saw the one come out last week for the monster, monsters and there's, you know,

[01:22:43] 30 locations on there that are doing parties, not just that have the game.

[01:22:48] That's nothing, but the fact that there's 30 different locations advertising, promoting

[01:22:53] their product.

[01:22:54] That's great.

[01:22:55] That's good for pinball.

[01:22:56] It's a light style brand.

[01:22:57] It's a light style brand.

[01:22:58] Apparently it's a light style brand.

[01:23:02] Somebody say that?

[01:23:03] That's what that sounds like.

[01:23:04] We first do it.

[01:23:05] It's a light style brand.

[01:23:06] That's how they, that's how they talk about it in their own press releases.

[01:23:09] It's not a pinball company.

[01:23:10] It's a light style brand.

[01:23:12] Anyway, I get what they mean.

[01:23:14] You can, you can buy a peril and, you know, I can wear Stern underwear maybe next year.

[01:23:19] Anyway, Joe, always a pleasure.

[01:23:21] We will have you on soon.

[01:23:23] If you're at T.P.F. guys, look out for Joe Newhart.

[01:23:26] Awesome, dude.

[01:23:27] You have a booth there, Joe, for pinball star?

[01:23:30] No.

[01:23:31] I go in attend, attendee.

[01:23:33] There's a lot of my friends and peers that are distributors that are more local to that

[01:23:38] area.

[01:23:39] So that's, that's their home base.

[01:23:42] And there's plenty of companies set up booths there and a lot of distributors sometimes

[01:23:46] are a little bit too much overlap.

[01:23:48] But I do get a chance to meet a lot of my, my customers from both Texas and all around

[01:23:55] the country.

[01:23:56] I love going to shows.

[01:23:57] I try to get it to as many as I can throughout the country.

[01:23:59] California, Chicago and of course the East Coast shows and we got Allentown coming up in

[01:24:05] May.

[01:24:06] So I'm going to have an incredible booth there with all the new stuff that we've been

[01:24:09] talking about and, and, you know, looking to make that show really exciting.

[01:24:15] I hope to see you there this year.

[01:24:16] I'm always there.

[01:24:17] I'm always there.

[01:24:18] Good.

[01:24:19] And you know what I always say this and I go to Texas.

[01:24:23] I go to Expo.

[01:24:25] Everything's always at Allentown.

[01:24:27] Everything.

[01:24:28] It's not as glamorous for sure.

[01:24:30] Wow.

[01:24:31] Of course not.

[01:24:32] Yeah.

[01:24:33] It doesn't have the same kind of like, you know, hang out late at night in the hotel and

[01:24:35] let's get drunk as the wife's not here kind of vibe going.

[01:24:38] But it's just it hasn't pin.

[01:24:41] It's got the pinball feel.

[01:24:42] It doesn't have the, we're here because there's something new.

[01:24:46] We're here.

[01:24:47] It's got the, we're here because we love pinball.

[01:24:51] We're going to see all the same people we see every year.

[01:24:53] And I'm sure a lot of the other non event shows, which again, you know, I'm sure a lot of

[01:24:54] the other non event shows, which again, you know, I'm sure a lot of the other, you know,

[01:24:58] Expo in Texas seem to be, you know, those two that hold the mantle.

[01:25:01] But a lot of the other shows seem to be just local gatherings that friends can see each

[01:25:05] other again that, you know, you haven't maybe connected with in the last year or people

[01:25:09] you just talk to, you know, by email or on Pinside or stuff like that.

[01:25:13] So yeah, Pint, Pint, Pintfest in Allentown is always a lot of great fun.

[01:25:18] And they got a great, you know, the flea market area and a lot of old games and just a great,

[01:25:23] you know, you look at a show like Allentown.

[01:25:25] It blows Expo away in terms of the number of games that people can play.

[01:25:29] I mean, you're literally looking at hundreds versus, you know, you know, one room of free

[01:25:35] play games that something like Expo is.

[01:25:37] It's turning to take Expo over and do it right.

[01:25:39] It's in their backyard.

[01:25:40] Anyway, that's for a later date conversation.

[01:25:42] Oh, the story.

[01:25:43] Joe, thank you so much.

[01:25:45] Always a pleasure.

[01:25:46] We'll talk to you soon.

[01:25:47] And yeah, I mean, I look forward to 2019 and seeing what's new from our friends at

[01:25:52] Jersey Jack.

[01:25:53] Well, we'll have to do this at the end of the year and see if you're opinion of, you

[01:26:00] know, missing the mark a little bit each time is before then we'll get you different

[01:26:04] before then.

[01:26:05] All right, sounds good.

[01:26:06] Thanks for everything.

[01:26:07] And we'll look forward to talking to you soon.

[01:26:09] Yeah.

[01:26:10] All right.

[01:26:11] All right.

[01:26:12] So that was Joe.

[01:26:13] New Heart Ladies and Gentlemen.

[01:26:14] I always enjoy talking to Joe.

[01:26:16] Again, because distributors are on the front lines.

[01:26:19] They see who walks into their establishment and who is really buying these games.

[01:26:24] And we talk a lot on this show about the expansion of pinball, who these companies are

[01:26:30] marketing these games towards.

[01:26:32] And we hear a time and time again, though, for the most part, what really attracts someone

[01:26:37] to a pinball machine is the theme.

[01:26:40] The theme is like the number one thing.

[01:26:43] Imagine if you don't really know much about pinball, how to, how to progress through a pinball

[01:26:48] game, you're really going to gravitate towards a theme that you have a connection to.

[01:26:54] And that is why we do beat the theme drums so much on this podcast.

[01:26:59] The other thing is, you know, how enjoyable is it for people to play pinball machines?

[01:27:05] And I think we hear that a lot.

[01:27:06] That oftentimes these games are getting so complex, so confusing to understand when you

[01:27:12] first flip them, that they can be a little bit of an immediate turn off.

[01:27:18] We also heard a lot from Joe on the realities of Jersey Jack.

[01:27:22] And I'm going to do another separate podcast on just some like news updates on Jersey Jack

[01:27:26] Pinball.

[01:27:27] Probably upload that tonight as well, because I just want to talk about what I think is

[01:27:32] going to happen at Jersey Jack Pinball and set some of the record straight on a lot of

[01:27:36] the speculation that's been going on.

[01:27:37] We've got some info that everyone should just know about.

[01:27:40] And I think it's going to excite you.

[01:27:42] I think it is going to be a big year for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:27:45] The Jack seems to have been forced into some compromising moments in which he had a

[01:27:50] show stuff very early on.

[01:27:53] And I think we're not going to see that again, because I think the people who are or the

[01:27:58] person who is making him do that is no longer at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[01:28:03] Okay.

[01:28:04] And look, one thing I just want to sign off on this show, and I've been asking for someone

[01:28:09] to come on the show now for a few weeks.

[01:28:11] And you can't criticize me for being unfair towards my assessment of a game like Pirate

[01:28:17] to the Caribbean.

[01:28:18] I've been asking over and over again for someone who has the game or understands the

[01:28:25] game for them to please come on the show and have a conversation with me and explain to

[01:28:31] me and my listeners what you love about the game, how you've found the game to be approachable

[01:28:38] and just let's talk about it, because I can't figure out how to get into the game on

[01:28:44] my own.

[01:28:45] And that's not my fault.

[01:28:46] I don't want to plow through rule books and thread after thread after thread of people

[01:28:52] trying to explain the simplicity.

[01:28:54] We all know that the best way to understand how to play a game is to actually spend a

[01:28:59] lot of time on it.

[01:29:01] And there's no better place to do that than in a home use environment.

[01:29:04] I've played Pirates about maybe 20, 30 times down in New York City on Stone Street, but

[01:29:10] again, they offer is there.

[01:29:12] And if you like this game and you want other people to like it, then I think you should

[01:29:16] join us and talk about it.

[01:29:19] I mean, is that fair?

[01:29:20] I think that is me being fair.

[01:29:21] And the same goes true with any pinball machine out there.

[01:29:26] Often times I know I say things about Houdini.

[01:29:29] I say things about Rob Zombie.

[01:29:31] I say things about certain pinball machines that I don't think shoot very well, Star Wars.

[01:29:36] And I always, always open the floor for those people who are fans of those machines to come

[01:29:42] on and explain why I should change my opinion about it and why other people who listen to

[01:29:48] this show should start to think a little bit differently about these games.

[01:29:52] So I just want to let you guys know.

[01:29:53] Canate at pinballadgmail.com is how you can get in touch with me.

[01:29:58] And a point is, you know, when Joe is talking about who buys these games, and often times

[01:30:03] we always like to think that we are the only people that are entitled to this hobby.

[01:30:09] And by that, I would say you've got the collectors and you've got the tournament players.

[01:30:14] And if what Joe is saying is accurate about half of people who buy pinball machines every

[01:30:20] year don't fall into either one of those buckets.

[01:30:24] They don't go on to pinside.

[01:30:26] They don't enter pinball tournaments.

[01:30:29] They simply buy a game because they want something fun for their house.

[01:30:34] And it doesn't mean they're a millionaire.

[01:30:36] It doesn't mean they're super wealthy.

[01:30:38] They just want a nice toy.

[01:30:41] And pinball is something that millions of people are aware of and have fun playing.

[01:30:47] Okay.

[01:30:48] So, I mean, that is a little high opening, right?

[01:30:50] But it's not surprising.

[01:30:52] Because sometimes I think that we fall into a little bit of a vacuum.

[01:30:57] And we see it all the time.

[01:30:58] It's like people on pinside, you get two guys who have issues with their game and their

[01:31:03] screaming and it sounds like every single game is shipping with problems.

[01:31:07] But the truth is probably anything but that.

[01:31:10] That even though a few of us who have megaphone's and constantly can cry about it, right,

[01:31:17] on a public forum or repeat ourselves frequently on a podcast, it can start to amplify the issues

[01:31:24] as if they're more widespread than they really are.

[01:31:27] Now that being said, that being said, I still think that the only company out there right

[01:31:34] now that is successfully marketing games to everybody, right?

[01:31:40] So think about it.

[01:31:41] Which company is making games that the tournament guys can get into, that the home collector

[01:31:45] can get into and that the casual person who just wants a fun theme in their house can

[01:31:50] get into.

[01:31:52] Only Stern Pimble right now has figured that out.

[01:31:56] And that is why they are what they are.

[01:31:59] Because they're hitting every target on, on, on at the, you know, in the middle of the

[01:32:04] bullseye, they are giving everybody what they want.

[01:32:07] Now look, if the one target that they're not appeasing the most is sort of the die-hard

[01:32:14] high-end collector, they don't care.

[01:32:17] Because they also know that the high-end collector is almost more addicted to collecting and buying

[01:32:22] and needs new stuff.

[01:32:24] And they simply win those people over with volume and cadence.

[01:32:29] And they get you four to five new things you can buy a year.

[01:32:32] And they know, even though you're, you know, you're very opinionated, they know you'll

[01:32:36] cave and eventually buy one or two of those games.

[01:32:39] And I see it all the time.

[01:32:40] I've been talking, I don't want to name names here, but I've been talking to some of my

[01:32:43] friends who bought a monster's alley and I asked them, did you play it?

[01:32:47] And they're like, no.

[01:32:48] And it's like, why'd you get it?

[01:32:49] And they just like, they really, they can't really say why other than, I think it's cool.

[01:32:55] And I think it'll shoot well.

[01:32:57] But really, they just have an addiction to getting a couple new pins a year.

[01:33:00] And I understand why.

[01:33:01] I understand why.

[01:33:02] All right.

[01:33:03] But there is a huge audience out there that, you know, is underrepresented.

[01:33:10] It's underrepresented within the podcast world.

[01:33:13] It's underrepresented at the pinball shows.

[01:33:16] I'm always surprised too when you go to pinball shows and you bring up pin side and some

[01:33:19] people are just like, I don't even know what that is.

[01:33:21] I don't even pinball podcasts.

[01:33:23] What is that?

[01:33:24] Anyway, so here's to getting people more representation.

[01:33:27] Here's to more positive podcasts in the future.

[01:33:30] Everyone, love you guys.

[01:33:31] Thanks for tuning in and we will be back with some Jersey Jack episode probably tonight.

[01:33:36] Bye.
