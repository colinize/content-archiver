[00:00] I'm...

[00:02] Tetsuo Shima.

[00:05] Huh?

[00:06] Tetsuo, huh?

[00:08] I'm new here too.

[00:09] My name is...

[00:11] Kaneda?

[00:13] Kaneda?

[00:15] Wake up!

[00:24] I was a little drunk.

[00:27] Plus I was horny.

[00:28] Yeah, that pretty much describes my time down in New Orleans with Tiger Law,

[00:34] Brunda and Pav.

[00:37] Over four days of fried food and sugary drinks will beat a man down, especially at my age.

[00:49] Before I get into tonight's episode, which is going to be an amazing interview I had with Ben Heck,

[00:56] who's over in New Zealand right now, I just wanted to...

[01:00] And you're going to hear it.

[01:02] I wanted to apologize for being fairly stride into my last podcast.

[01:08] I clearly was expressing some strong opinions about the Hobbit and my feelings with that game against Game of Thrones.

[01:18] I heard a lot of you guys, a lot of you J.J.P fans, loud and clear that I should shut up,

[01:25] that it's too early to determine this game and review it against Game of Thrones Ellie,

[01:30] which I was playing in a home environment.

[01:32] And I agree.

[01:33] I agree.

[01:34] I am going to let the Hobbit ship, and I hope to play it in the right environment,

[01:40] and I hope it's set up and dialed in properly, and I will...

[01:44] I will reserve any further judgment on this pin until that happens, and I hope that someone who is close to me in New York City gets one,

[01:51] and I can go experience it in the right way.

[01:55] Okay, so we'll leave it at that.

[01:57] I hope that's fair.

[01:58] I also will not go into any J.J.P. threads about the Hobbit and do any trolling.

[02:05] So you have my word, you heard it here on the podcast, and I look forward to hearing you guys review the pin,

[02:10] which it sounds like will be in the middle of next month.

[02:13] So let's talk about the Ben Hick interview.

[02:16] I had so much fun talking about Ben.

[02:18] We talked, gosh, for almost two hours, mostly about Pinball, but we got off topic at times,

[02:25] talking about the Rocket Tier and Total Recall movie, but I want to keep this interview that you guys hear

[02:32] to mostly about our Pinball conversation.

[02:34] And I'm also going to break it up into two parts, because we cover a lot.

[02:37] We talk about J.P.P., we talk about Spooky, we talk about Ghostbusters, we talk about Alien, we talk about,

[02:45] you know, even Skit B, we talk about technology in Pinball machines, and where that is going.

[02:51] We talk about what it was like to see it, America's most honoured sell for $10, you know, $9,400, almost $10,000.

[02:59] We talk about Rob Zombie and his work on that pin.

[03:02] So we're going to break it up into about, it's going to be about two half hour podcast.

[03:09] So you're going to hear the first half now, and I'm going to upload the second half sometime this weekend.

[03:15] And just keep in mind, in the first about, I think, five minutes, Ben's voice has a little crackle to it.

[03:22] We figured out that technical difficulties, so don't be concerned if you're here, the quality being a little bit subpar at the beginning of it.

[03:32] So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the interview with Ben Heck, this is Part One, and look for Part Two this weekend.

[03:38] Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I want to welcome Mr. Ben Heck to Canada's Pinball Podcast, a place where people come to lose all credibility, and Ben is all the way around the world in New Zealand right now.

[03:52] Ben, welcome to the show.

[03:54] Thanks, I thought I would have lost all credibility years ago though.

[03:59] Well, this is the final, the final nail in the coffin, but we want to just have you on it and talk pinball.

[04:06] We've got a few topics tonight we want to go over.

[04:09] And let's just start things off by one of the most recent things I saw on Pinside, and that is America's most honoured, just sold new in box for $9,000.

[04:23] So how good do you guys feel that this pin is now become really one of the most sought after and collectible pins and is now selling for what $3,000 more than you guys sold it for originally?

[04:35] Well, it definitely makes you feel good, especially after the rough ride we had the first year.

[04:42] And we were at, I want to say it was Expo in Chicago 2014, and this would have been about, I don't know, six months after they started shipping, although we'd only shipped about 40 at that time because it was slower.

[04:54] And someone was selling one already, and they wanted $5,500 for it, which is obviously below retail.

[05:01] And I was like, oh no, because I mean, you know, it's a market thing like if the resell value is too far below the new value, and you haven't fulfilled all your new orders yet, you can lose orders.

[05:11] Because why pay 6 grand when you can get one used? So it was a little worried. I mean, I think it sold in like an hour. Nowadays it would have sold like in a second.

[05:21] Yeah, so it was a little worried early on, but it's definitely changed since then.

[05:27] Because originally you guys didn't have a set number you were going to build, right? And you realize that if we limited it, right, that sort of created a nice sense of urgency.

[05:39] So you guys set a limited number. And once that happened and you said we're only going to make 150, was it at that point that you guys really start to see just people flocking to buy them?

[05:49] It definitely helped. It was actually wise snow on Pinside, who's real name is Hilton, as most people know.

[05:56] He actually is a neighbor of mine. He didn't want to fire from me. He runs our local tournament in Madison. So I know him in real life.

[06:02] And he'd be very opinionated as most of us opinion Pinside are, but yes, that's a good idea. And he's like, hey, if you limit it, if you limit it to a specific number, you will sell more because everyone wants the rare thing that they can't get.

[06:19] And so we, I don't know, spent a couple of weeks trying to figure out the right number. And we settled on 150.

[06:28] I think we probably could have gone well, we definitely could have gone a little higher. And once we did that, then we announced that at Xpo 2014.

[06:36] And the sales definitely picked up. And then once we've once it got past 100, that was a weird thing. It's just like the numbers, the numbers, put people into friends.

[06:46] And once it got past 100, it was like, oh my God, there's only 50 left. And then we sold the last 50 in a week.

[06:54] Wow, even though it took us like a year to sell the first. Yeah. It's insane. It's definitely, you know, people have strange mentality when it comes to things like that.

[07:04] So, so actually, you know, it's great. I mean, Hilton, Wise Snow, that I think that's a brilliant marketing idea. And you said once in an interview that people always want what they say they don't want, they'll never publicly admit it.

[07:17] And I think something we always hear from people is, I don't want it to be limited. I want everyone to be able to enjoy this pinball machine. And I think when it comes to collecting, I think that's totally bogus. I think there's a reason.

[07:29] Yeah, pretty much whatever we realize after about the first year, whatever anyone says inverse it, that's what they actually want.

[07:36] It's quite simple actually. Yeah. So I guess it's like that. It's like that scene in who frame Roger Rabbit raised like drink the drink. I don't have the drink. Drink it. I don't want it. You do. I don't. I do. You don't.

[07:48] People like license themes. And I think license themes also can lend themselves better to games. A stranger's that sounds. I mean, we get into that a little bit more detail later on.

[08:16] I mean, we can just jump to it now. I mean, when you look at you guys had a brain AMH on the road and it took what over a year to sell 150 and Rob Zombie sold out without taking it anywhere in just a matter of days. Right. And I mean, I think that if that is like the ultimate test or just the ultimate proof point that a hot theme that people want, you don't even need to, you don't even need to like play it or see it. Right.

[08:45] People are pre-ordering. Yeah. Look at ghost. Well, I think I think you said, yeah, Ghostbusters exactly Ghostbusters is going to be huge. I see. I don't think Chuck was like eyes. I don't know if it'll be that big. And I say lap nip on pincides. Like that game is going to be effing huge. People do not realize how big Ghostbusters was back in the day. I was a Ghostbuster for like three Halloween in a row. So yeah, it's going to like hit the bullseye of like the, you know, 40 to 50 year old man.

[09:14] You know, which is basically the pinball market. Right. I just had to laugh like all those people in Pincide who thought there was a chance in hell that they would make it based off the new female reboot. Come on. I know that that was just showing stern absolutely no respect in their marketing part. And of course they're going to go with the original. I think someone was saying it'll be like,

[09:35] like, this is a copy who just made a kiss pinball machine for crying out loud. Like, well, they know who their market is. They know better than the market does. Right. I think they were put just wide and I'll fire a three if someone makes it in no other medium would anyone give a shit. But in pinball will be, you know, killing their first four, no for it. Right. And I think, well, I think people were looking at Ghostbusters with the new movie coming out. And some people are saying it was going to be like WWE where you'd have the female characters on the.

[10:05] The pro and the original characters on the Ellie and that just makes no sense that they would do you know two movies or two separate.

[10:12] And I think it would be pointless. Yeah. And I think the license rights would be a lot easier for the new movie. I mean, everything would be packed. It's up in one license versus, you know, trying to do something from 30 years ago where you have to get everyone to sign off on it separately as you saw like with alien. Right. Ghostbusters is the same thing.

[10:34] And start as smart too because you know, and I hear people complain about the new Ghostbusters cast and then it's going to be a comedy. I that's silly because you know as much as Ghostbusters is a classic. You really don't see it on TV very often. It doesn't get talked about as much as it is going to be talked about this year with a new film. And that's going to lead more and more people to go back and watch the originals than ever before. Right. And so I think this is going to hit at the right time because of that. So I personally feel Ghostbusters is a reboot line.

[11:04] That should not have been crossed. I mean, that's not I'll definitely watch the new movie on video. I'm not going to go to the theater and see it. But I don't know. I just I have no faith in remakes. Even though there's been classic movies at our remakes. They've been remakes of movies that weren't classic to begin with. I mean, nobody talks about 1950s fly or the 1950s the thing, which was called who goes there.

[11:28] No one talks about the 1923 10 commandments. You know, those are examples with remakes, actually better, but I don't know. Right. It's just it's well, that's a whole different subject movie reboots. But I mean, there's still a market for that classic Ghostbusters. I mean, you're not excited for the big trouble on little China reboot that has the rock as Kurt Russell's character on it. That's that's already so they signed on for that. Yeah, this may sound sacrilegious, but I didn't see that movie until I was in my 30s and I was like.

[11:58] So fast gentlemen is that too much to ask time to kill him for me?

[12:04] Well, sorry, if too many people around here been dropping like flies already and where's that getting this? Huh? No, we're fast.

[12:13] You know what old Jack Burton always says at a time like this. Cool. Jack Burton me.

[12:19] Here's another one. You're probably going to like hang up and hear this like I don't like the original Tron. I didn't see it when I was a kid. I saw it as a cynical adult and I'm like, I, I, I, I, I didn't agree with you on that one. I even when I watch it when I was young, it just always looked a little weird to me and a little and off. I just, I don't know, I just didn't seem that great is the plot is garbage. It's basically the matrix done really badly.

[12:42] I stand by the shit. I even like the new one better the new one is generic Hollywood BS, but it's more solid. It's solid BS.

[12:53] Well, now I'm going to lose all my friends and pins.

[12:57] Look, I think if they if there's, you know, there's nothing but rumors right now in Pinside because that's all we're stuck in this like speculation vortex right now that past few weeks. It seems like.

[13:08] But you know, you see that rumor pop up around the Tron vault edition might be the throwback artwork from the original film and.

[13:17] You know, we'll see I mean they they now they've shown with spider man that if they're going to do a vault edition and they they might re-skinned it and redo dots and and reduce stuff on it.

[13:28] So I think I was I was in Austin last summer and I was hanging out with lap nip a K Brett and then star trek near universe john.

[13:40] And we were eating this awesome brownie at this bar that has these awesome brownies and Brett brought up early interesting point.

[13:48] This is regarding Tron and we were talking about P three you know because Jerry's another Texas local for those guys.

[13:54] And yeah, Brett was like, you know what he should do is he should make like retro Tron for P three like that would be a perfect theme to fit that.

[14:02] So maybe that's the kind of Tron game this should be made something on P three.

[14:06] So we were just I was just down in New Orleans with with with Tiger law and we were talking arylsons.

[14:12] Yeah, Martin Nolan's I am I got it's just surviving four days of morning. I'm surprised I'm alive.

[14:19] I've never been to Marty Gron. I don't know. I'm probably two old to survive it now maybe like 10 years ago. I would have loved it.

[14:25] Well, I reckon yeah, I mean well you go down there though.

[14:27] Though the it feel like the average age of the person who's drinking down there is like 50.

[14:31] I mean they're I was so surprised at how many people in the my really what their age wise be the whole it's just like no matter the age of everyone is just dressed in carnival gear on fat Tuesday and just wasted.

[14:41] It was pretty incredible to witness.

[14:43] But we were talking about P three because I think P three is a game and I know we're sort of jumped around here and that's fine.

[14:49] This is just going to be guys there's for listener of the show we've got some notes.

[14:53] We're just so we're going to we're going to go off on a bunch of topics.

[14:55] So P three is a game that I think is really innovative and I do want to talk to you about it is a platform.

[15:03] So the platform of having the screen is the play field, the modular you know back of the game that you can take in and out.

[15:11] I don't I don't think P three is going to move at the price point he's at until he gets a license theme now I think that is going to be.

[15:21] It's going to be a test right because they're going to they're going to launch that platform.

[15:25] Yeah I think around 10 grand.

[15:27] And I've been watching you know Lex I go to a lot of shows and so I've seen Lexi lights be evolve over the years and the last couple of times I saw it probably when I was at southern fried game expo although it might

[15:38] be I'm sure it was also a Texas pinball fast which is a really good show of no one listening has been.

[15:46] You know Lexi lights be finally felt like a game.

[15:50] But I see that with fast pinball as well.

[15:54] It seems like Jerry and Aaron both are making games to sell a platform and I think they would have better success.

[16:04] Yeah with something that would really click with people and making a theme that would make that would make the platform sing right so are they is the golden to make the platform then take it to a like a license and so here's what we can do and then they would take.

[16:18] They want people to build systems with their games and that's you know that's what they want to do and that's cool.

[16:24] I just think yeah they need like a hook they need like a really cool game to sell it.

[16:30] I'm saying hey look at this really cool game we made using this platform and you know Jerry's getting there with Lexi lightspeed but again it's an unlicensed theme and people basically don't want those.

[16:44] I just think it's really hard you know I've heard I heard orc recently say he wants to do just an original theme because of the challenges with working with with with a license.

[16:56] Let's talk about like getting a license because I mean I've worked in I've been working in marketing for 15 years and for a bunch of those years I did toy fair and it always seemed like if you want to go get a license.

[17:08] What's the process so I mean is it is it hardest cure license for a pin is it is are some of them just too much money that it doesn't make it worth it.

[17:18] What what was it like like even getting Rob Zombie I mean I know there might might have must there maybe was some personal cash in there but I wasn't I wasn't really involved with Rob Zombie.

[17:28] I mean I can tell you what I know though yeah I mean that way what what do you know.

[17:32] Well I mean the big thing you have to do is pay money they usually want that it's a little bit more involved than calling a number off the back of a DVD cover.

[17:42] But it's also not impossible.

[17:46] So you're saying they this get be way to get the license is not to call the way 100 number on the Fox DVD for predators that what you're saying.

[17:55] Yeah, it's get be but they did some serious damage to the homebrew community.

[18:03] I mean you know Chuck always is like oh Ben you were too much blah blah blah I'm like Chuck these people are evaporating money off the market.

[18:09] It's gone. It's like they can't buy a predator and then sell it and then buy one of your games that money.

[18:15] It's gone. Yeah that's what that's what sucks is money is destroyed.

[18:20] Anyway I believe with the Rob Zombie I think well usually you talk to the marketing people because the marketing people are in charge of marketing brand of you know Rob Zombie or or whomever that you're trying to get a license from.

[18:34] And it's usually not too hard to get someone to talk as long as you're talking numbers.

[18:40] I guess I would call them get out of bed in the morning numbers.

[18:44] I mean so you're usually talking like a minimum of like 50 grand like you know if we make 100 games at what would that be 50 dollars each then you know your company brand will get paid 50 thousand dollars.

[18:58] But that's one of the reasons turning and get better numbers and other people is because they just have a much bigger scale right.

[19:04] Whereas in my cost us you know a couple hundred dollars per game per you know for the license.

[19:10] It'd be less for Stern because they're making more games and you know the license or is still getting you know a good amount of money is just that Stern is able to amortize that across more more titles.

[19:21] Whereas if you go back to predator I hate to bring this up well I don't hate to bring you son of a bitch.

[19:27] If you look at them you know when they're trying to do a Hail Mary pass to save it in the end which of course never would have worked.

[19:35] But you know the amount of you know again you know they would have had to pay like at least 50 to 75 thousand dollars to get the license and then if you divide that over 250 games.

[19:45] It would have taken a huge chunk out of their bill of materials which is already too low and it still would have never worked.

[19:51] So I guess the point is you need to sell a certain amount of games just so you can amortize the licensing cost across all the games to make it worthwhile.

[19:59] Do you think predator because I think we all sort of follow that drama unfold and I kind of feel like they were they would have got away with it if if people who got out didn't go and contact Fox and make them aware of it.

[20:14] There's rumors that he built like ten of them anyway like the people in Michigan who you think would be the most likely to jump on a lawsuit or the one.

[20:23] Allegedly he's he's still built them I mean he doesn't give a shit yeah he's walking around shows seems like he's basically care like that.

[20:31] Allison Detroit.

[20:33] I mean he's putting on arcade games with people's money I mean yeah the whole thing is just it was just terrible I mean I if I had to pick I mean definitely Kevin pisses me off more than John John was like a artistic kind of artsy artsy failure I mean I could have you know you can have you know sufficient luck I could go down to like you know state street and Madison and give some guitar player a million dollars you make I'm going to make you the best guitar ever man and you probably wouldn't get it.

[21:02] But at least at least with John he failed to properly if that makes any sense and how so just that he well he created a business he even though the contracts were ridiculous you know it was all above water like Kevin didn't even have an LLC or anything he was doing all as a private citizen which means.

[21:25] I also see me probably didn't pay taxes on the but he'd be hit with like you know what shit 40% tax on that amount of money as an individual I mean he thought you're right right the top that's right yeah he thought he was I from what I recall he thought he was a non for profit organization that he was going to sell the game for exactly what a cost of the make.

[21:47] And that's how he was going to be exempt from.

[21:50] He sounds like a genius right easy me exempt from like the IP laws that you can't you can't take someone's IP for profit or to sell something so he he just is like well I'll just sell it for this and that's what it cost me to make each one and I know and I'll notice so that yeah so you can be the biggest the biggest like super hippie I love whales I'm going to save the whales and stop global warming corporation blah blah blah blah nonprofit in the world and you'd still have to buy the rights to John Lenin's imagined right.

[22:20] I'm not going to give it you for free right because most nonprofits have lots of money you know it's crazy.

[22:27] People aren't working for no profits you know you know that right and you know it's crazy to is is you know even the community though the fact that so many people are on board and there's like Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness on there there's his voice callouts and I think you know by the time that game was even revealed people knew having seen you know some of the struggles that Stern had with getting the call outs and the likenesses on games it's like it's crazy.

[22:50] I see that we all just thought this guy in the middle nowhere like would be able to secure like the biggest action star of all times likeness and we are and people just gave money I mean it's just it's it's well yeah here's the thing I mean this this is kind of how it was with how well with older films you know they didn't anticipate as many of the ancillary streams revenue that it might now so like there's something we were looking at like another license as game three or four whatever it would be for spooky and I was like okay you pay for it.

[23:19] And I was like okay you pay X amount blah blah blah and you get likenesses of all the actors as they appear in the property their speech as it appears in the property blah blah blah and you can even record them doing dialogue as long as it's in within the character of the property all that was included because it was a modern property so that's all been figured out ahead of time right.

[23:39] You go back to 1979 I'm sure and like hey so you're going to weaver who no one knows you know here's some money be in this movie and yeah I mean they probably didn't have you know all in the ancillary rights worked into the contract which means those are separate like what was it in alien you know how an alien three.

[23:59] They're like all new died bishop died Hicks died you know right and there's an interview Michael being said he got paid more to have his photo his grainy photo up here in alien three and then he did to make aliens yeah yeah.

[24:20] So it's just like just like a picture of someone can be really expensive if it's not already tied into a packaged art deal which if you go back to some like game of thrones you know here are all the stills of the characters these are the stills that are approved as part of a style guide therefore using these is the easiest and quickest way to get an art package done.

[24:40] That's why that happens right look at the adventure is a great example there's two shots of every character like there's like 10 10 shots of scarlet your hands and doing that jump kick thing on that game because it's an improved style asset and it's the easiest way to get it done right and these companies have realized there's there's so much you know if they can their whole licensing merchandising industry that grew up that wasn't available like in the 70s or wasn't even thought of this so that that's an interesting point to because there probably are some themes and we're sort of seeing this with alien.

[25:10] You know they might be awesome themes people love but for to manufacture a pinball machine and have all the elements that you want in it it might be like really challenging and is it worth it right if you can't get all of the actors the likeness is you know how close to that property can you get if you can't use some of that stuff and I think it's going to be interesting to see because I just saw a rumor that Sigourney we've just closed I hope I hope it works out all right for them but I know it's a

[25:39] It can be a real struggle I mean you have to I mean I know yeah it's tough I've gone on the record for saying that I think they should have figured out those issues before even starting the artwork and starting the game because I mean it seems like it common

[25:58] It's a very sensitive to lock down all of your assets and everything you know you're going to have before you start to have an issue with that too I mean sometimes you just don't know right you don't know or you know you but you know you don't know right I think Dutch to the way they've come out and sort of been like well we

[26:15] We didn't really check with John Goodman or we didn't check with the studio if we could put everything on the playfield but it's good that they've Roger Sharp on board because it seems you know if you're going to make a pimp on the machine that has a license theme and has Hollywood actors in it and whatnot you're going to have to check all the boxes or you can't show it I mean in any other industry if you showed something and took money for sale the way Dutch did and it wasn't approved I mean that you can't do that and that's why I think they're that whole thing sort of unravelled for them and

[26:45] with what with still gate talking about they brought a machine to a show that they weren't legally allowed to show and I know because we're a little hobby right then that like not many people are paying attention to in the larger world with these big companies it's still legal still can't do it technically but you know so hopefully that works out I saw that we had to with the Rob Zombie thing I think what was it Rob didn't want it to be shown until it was in its complete form like all assembled

[27:15] you know the game in the cabinet and everything so it was more you know a pretty not too difficult to work with because a lot of times you know chuck to go right to rob for approvals so I I'm sure any licenses that spooky doesn't the future and as you've mentioned on Pinson I believe you're right I'm sure spooky will probably do licenses for the foreseeable future

[27:44] I don't know they probably won't be as easy as Rob Zombie was because Rob Zombie was

[27:50] was

[27:52] my license point of view fairly straightforward I mean there's a I guess you know once we get I guess once we talk about that pin in a little bit more detail I can tell you a few more stories about like design and stuff or the plot I should say yeah I mean do you want to you want to

[28:06] we talk about Rob Zombie now I mean I think what's it seemed like you know it's hearing and I think that but we had to talk about the $10,000 AM age because right

[28:16] I mean I don't have to have some sort of opinion on that yes so what actually I really don't I mean if the guy can get a bunch of money for it great

[28:22] you capitalism well here's the thing with it with a $10,000 America's most honoured I mean it I don't have a problem when people list a pin for high prices and I always get every time I say anything on the forum where it's like great you should ask a high price people yell at me and they almost they take it as a personal insult to their intelligence if you've priced something higher than they think it's worth so that's

[28:45] that's one of the whole reasons to I got kicked off of of clob back in the day besides some other malicious behavior in the PM world but but here's what would happen to me all the time Ben I would I would be looking for a game and I would let's just say and this is our in the arcade world I really really wanted a neo geo

[29:05] for slot that was in mint condition and I knew it's awesome I love them and I'd ask people what's a neo geo for slot worth and I'd always get responses that would say anywhere between $608

[29:21] okay and then so I would say okay but I want one that's really meant possibly restored all I'm offering $1,500 anyone who will sell me one right

[29:31] if that's a lot of money for a neo geo I know I know and those threads exist guess how many people would part with it nobody so all the guys who have like mint ones that were like beautiful they didn't they wouldn't let them go so the same thing happens to pinball I mean a lot of these games end up in someone's basement and they never leave well that's the definition of being a collector is you collect you don't really want to sell you know they're not

[30:01] they're not distributors they're not well you know if you're well off which a lot of the collectors are you don't need to sit on as long as you've got the room and it's not like oh crap I my furnace broke I need a thousand dollars I better sell my pinball machine like most most of the collectors are not in that situation

[30:19] so the game's going to sit there in their basement right I'd love to have a big bang bar I'm not going to pay $20,000 for one so yeah I mean I guess I could if I wanted to go buy one I would

[30:29] but it's I don't know that's ridiculous money I saw I saw is it mister 86 I hope I didn't get the name right but he has one that's a prototype that he said look if you want it 25K 25K for real bang bang bar is actually a pretty good price right well see yeah I mean it's just like what 10 left of the original prototype run right yeah there's not there's like hardly any and but it's just it's just in the middle of the game

[30:57] and any and but it's just it's just interestingly the climate of of remakes and and you know I if you're if you're remaking pinball machines in 2016 and how do you not have like big bang bar king pin heck even king Kong you know how do you not just put the top of that list the games that are selling for astronomical prices

[31:17] and and then go remake them and sell them for a third of of the cost I mean it's it's it's what I would do if I was trying to make a limited number of pinball machines now I would not be surprised if king pin happens big bang bar I wouldn't put anything past happening I don't quite understand attack from Mars now in a trolless fashion I have an attack from Mars that I put way more in the game

[31:47] to then I'll ever get so I am my opinion comes mostly from bias but still I mean that's kind of the problem like with it medieval man is remake it's like oh it's an $8,000 $12,000 game this is a bargain I have to buy it right but it depressed the prices of that exact market so at a certain point the remakes will depress the prices at the point where the remakes are no longer a bargain and I think that's kind of a entropy point that that's going to hit I mean an attack

[32:17] attack from Mars well first of all I think attack from Mars and medieval man is shot wise are basically the same I really cactus can we're probably better bet although it's not as good of a game as attack from Mars.

[32:28] Yeah I just think by and if he does the holy trifecta MMR AFM and monster bash I think by time you got done remaking all those prices be so depressed at the point where you probably wouldn't even know the settlement of profit as often as that sounds right certainly when the 8k for a new win anymore maybe

[32:47] 7 so then for 7k you get a really nice attack from Mars anyway right anyway I I think remakes are silly unless it's a game even if it is a game like kingpin and I'll explain why because in this hobby so much of what fuels it is is finding the pin you know the hunt for something is what makes collecting a lot of fun and if you remove all the grail pins and the hard to find pins from

[33:16] from from that hunt and it's just like oh we're just going to make them until people stop ordering them they I don't they they lose their their specialness in a way yeah the chase is gone like it's like when you're a kid and I think when I was 10 I really wanted to pair walkie talkies and then I got them from a birthday and it's like not a big deal you know like it's the desire in the chase that actually has the value.

[33:41] Well have you actually actually owning is actually not that satisfying right any if you notice and you know in the MMR world and in the threads people just don't really care that people are getting their MMRs it's like because like what what experience are you going to share that is any different than the experience

[34:02] people have had with that machine for what like 20 years now I mean the only thing that I think makes it more interesting is that they're redoing the dots on it and those look incredible but you know who knows when that's going to happen but yes just like oh great I got a newer version of the movie you saw 20 years ago it's been a little touch top here and there but it's still just the same game so I mean I think it's admirable that they got it as close as they did and they're able to make a new version of it.

[34:30] But yeah you're right it's kind of the magic is gone it's like on that episode of the Simpsons where they had the flaming Moe and it was an awesome drink and then once they figured out what was in it it became completely common and no one cared.

[34:43] Yeah yeah yeah so well yeah we'll see I mean especially to like movies they should remake stuff like you know don't remake what are they I don't know what's next remake grumblins don't remake grumblins remake some obscure film they didn't quite work you know or maybe there's some.

[35:00] I mean even like MMR AFM part of the reason they're valuables because even at that time they weren't selling nearly as well as they were in the early 90s and those were both original themes.

[35:10] Hey here's something to think about but go back to the original theme thing look at like a William sales in the early 90s there was sound like gangbusters it was all licenses.

[35:20] Wasn't until like 95 96 it was mostly original titles of that time AFM theater of magic circus full tear tails are maybe nights.

[35:29] I mean really what do they have for licenses in like the late 90s like NBA fast break episode one I mean it's mostly original titles and I don't think that's the only reason why the sales went down but I'm sure there's a connection.

[35:42] But they have like something like you know Star Trek where they may like what 12,000 of them right well look at like certain whole tear right that they couldn't give that game away right when it came out they heard like distributors were selling them for like.

[35:55] We're like 1500 bucks 2000 dollars just to get rid of them at some point like nibb to grand leave that in the box 20 years you get a lot more 9000 dollars yeah right that thing now that came came out today it would it would look like a premium alley machine for people and they go not just because it has a toy that that that was something I was concerned with with.

[36:16] People trying to save magic girl.

[36:18] I mean magic girl was like circus full tear on crack circus full tear on crack well that's going to conclude part one of my interview with Ben Hack when we pick up in part two we're going to dive right into what it was like working with J pop.

[36:35] We're going to talk about.

[36:38] Pimbal innovation where he thinks it's going.

[36:40] We're just have a few other topics are just really exciting so we hope you guys tune in it's was Friday today I think that that one should go up in the next couple days so look for part two of my interview with Ben Hack thanks for listening.
