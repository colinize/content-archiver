[00:00] So I hand you my body and drink down my last one

[00:06] Then he bombed the cigarette and asked me for a light

[00:14] Welcome everyone to a Friday edition of Canada's pinball podcast the only pinball podcast that knows Joe Balser is still

[00:23] At American pinball. Oh my god

[00:25] So I just got off the phone with my good friend Derek who's a big fan of Willie Wonka and he said Chris

[00:31] Can you say something nice about Willie Wonka on today's show?

[00:34] It's actually a great game and then I went on pinside and someone put up a thread that says the verdict is in

[00:43] Wonka is a wonder and

[00:45] Canada is a wonker and then this this person's chasing things goes on this big tirade about how wrong

[00:52] I am about the game and how one man's opinion about this game is meaningless and yada yada yada and here's the thing

[00:59] Here's the thing

[01:00] If you love Willie Wonka I am so happy you love the game. I'm happy you enjoy the game

[01:07] I don't think I've been unfair about Willie Wonka if you listen to what I've said about the pin

[01:11] I think the game is one of the best shooting pinball machines and he's looked the thing is is he's blaming me

[01:18] About the cheap drains out of the pop bumper. Okay, so someone needs to tell this guy to go actually read the Wonka

[01:26] Owners thread that I've been reading and why are so many people

[01:31] Talking about the drains that come out of the pop bumper section like am I making that up or is it accurate or is everyone lying to me

[01:38] And I'm simply reporting the facts incorrectly

[01:41] But here's what I've been thinking about over the last few days other than the fact that I got Joe Balser leaving

[01:47] AP all wrong

[01:48] So thank you for the bad information. You know who you are out there

[01:52] I'm gonna talk a little bit about that and the rumor mail and what I've been hearing and like stern's next reveal and and am I

[01:59] Am I being lied to by more people to try to make the show lose credibility? I'm gonna talk a little bit about that

[02:04] But first let me talk about Willie Wonka because I think

[02:09] That people out there are trying some for some reason

[02:14] To blame me for Wonka and or for the lack of hype around Wonka or getting people's

[02:20] Excitement levels through the roof and then turning around and saying I didn't like the way the game was coded

[02:25] Here's here's a thing and I said this

[02:28] All you have to do is play the game and make up your mind on whether or not you like it or not now

[02:34] What I don't like is this what I don't like is this I don't like being pressured

[02:39] And no one likes being pressured into having to like a game

[02:44] And we saw the same thing with Pirate to the Caribbean if you like Pirate to the Caribbean great

[02:49] If you don't that's fine as well

[02:51] But when people are like it's the greatest game of all time and you have to agree with me

[02:58] Okay

[02:59] No, we don't have to agree with you

[03:01] We might not think it's the greatest game of all time and and pinball is 100%

[03:07] A subjective journey for all of us. Okay now look

[03:11] I do want to spend more time on a willy-wanka machine the last time I went to sunshine to play it

[03:17] It wasn't working

[03:19] But it's been a pretty reliable machine. I mean I read the threads

[03:22] I mean I I used to see Pirate to the Caribbean's broken down every day

[03:26] I'm not seeing that with willy-wanka

[03:28] I think you wonka owners out there are having a game that is probably the most problem-free game out of all time

[03:36] All the Jersey Jack games that are out there so they've been successful in making a game much more reliable

[03:42] Okay, they've made code updates which has made the game better and they've added more speech and more callouts and more clips and more modes and more lights and all the stuff that's going on in that game

[03:54] Here's the thing that I want to say that's very nice about willy-wanka and Jersey Jack Pimball and I've said this before

[04:00] They make the best

[04:02] Premium Pimball product in the world. There's no doubt about it

[04:07] You as much as I love Batman 66 as much as I love the code in my Batman game

[04:12] There is a reason why after playing willy-wanka I came home and I immediately wanted willy-wanka

[04:19] It is just another level of quality that is in these Jersey Jack games without a doubt and I don't think anyone would disagree with that

[04:28] When you hear about

[04:29] Stern Pimball and when you hear about the bomb and Gary Stern's

[04:34] Desired to get every game at a certain cost and they're very successful at that and that is why Stern is a very successful Pimball company

[04:42] But there's no way around a simple fact and it's a fact that a lot of people out there just don't want to face up to

[04:49] Is that Stern Pimball machines are much cheaper to make than a Jersey Jack Pimball machine and it shows

[04:56] It's very clear. It's very night and day

[04:59] Which game has more in it?

[05:02] Which game has more mechanisms has more you know integrated

[05:07] Sometimes I'm using a word integrated. No, what has more going on the on the LCD screen as a bigger LCD screen as more animations in it

[05:15] Well, maybe Jurassic Park has more than than some of these recent Jersey Jack games

[05:19] But you know, I'm saying you can't stand over a Jersey Jack game next to a Stern game and say these games are the same value

[05:25] In terms of cost. It's just not there. I mean I mean cost of materials

[05:30] So Jersey Jack games give you more. Okay, but see that's where it ends for me because at that point

[05:38] Jack is putting more into games Jack I won't say Jack is trying harder

[05:42] But I do think he's trying harder. I will say it. I think Jack allows his designers and his coders and the people over there

[05:49] To put more in the game when I hear stories of Stern Pimball

[05:52] It's more about Gary Stern walking over and telling designers to take stuff out and you're gonna hear

[05:58] I'm gonna interview Christopher Franchi. You're gonna hear stories of what it's like to be a designer at Stern in which you have to yank stuff out of a game

[06:07] But we all know that right. This is not a mystery to us that Stern Pimball is about removing stuff

[06:12] You have to look no further than Elvira

[06:15] We all know that Dennis Nordman a man who designs incredible ramps in his games

[06:21] Would never in a million years

[06:23] Designed those boring

[06:25] mundane ramps in Elvira, okay, and yet what happened?

[06:30] Stern yank stuff out Stern made stuff simpler and what happened all of you ran and bought it like suckers

[06:36] Yes, Zach many suckers go and run and buy whatever is put in front of them without thinking about it

[06:43] And now look at the people who are opening up Elvira look at them

[06:47] They're opening up their game. They spent so much money on their game and the code's not finished

[06:53] And the game has a long way to go and the game has got pretty boring shots and there's not much to do in the game

[06:58] Okay, and it kind of hurts me that I know on the other side of the fence

[07:04] Distributors are sitting on Willy Wonka Ellie machines like they I had a friend call me yesterday

[07:10] He's like distributors are trying to unload Willy Wonka Ellie's so has the demand for Willy Wonka

[07:16] Drive up a little bit and I think it's sad that Willy Wonka is sitting in boxes at distributors

[07:24] With with no home to go do right now and people are unboxing Elvira in unfinished game that definitely had cost-cutting measures put into it

[07:34] There it which would I rather have have you to ask me which would I rather have Willy Wonka or Elvira without a doubt?

[07:39] I would rather have a Willy Wonka the game is much further along. It's pretty much done

[07:44] It's all at a polishing stage now. There's more in the game for sure

[07:49] Absolutely more in the game the game shoots way better has a much more unique layout and yet Elvira

[07:55] Is selling hotter than Willy Wonka is right now

[07:59] Now if you look at the Willy Wonka life cycle. I think

[08:02] Obviously the clear code issue was an issue for them and and without a doubt

[08:08] A lot of people pump the brakes instead. I'm not going to go in on a Jersey Jack game until they figure out this problem

[08:13] And look I was the one who was telling you to do that and I think that was the smart thing to do

[08:18] And no company right now has actually publicly come out and said they found and fixed the problem

[08:25] But we know that they will have to right because there's no way around it. You can't hide this problem

[08:30] It is as clear as day

[08:32] If the clear codes are are pooling and and chipping and all that jazz right?

[08:36] Okay, so Willy Wonka is is it starting to run out of steam already

[08:41] And is it selling as well as Jersey Jack thought it would sell now look

[08:45] I'm gonna agree with this guy on pin sight for a minute say okay

[08:47] Like let's just hypothetically say it is the greatest game of all time and you love it

[08:51] And it's awesome and can it is all wrong and can it is an idiot and why does anybody listen to that show?

[08:55] Well, maybe because we're damn entertaining and we keep going and we stay on topic and we don't make you wait about what I have for breakfast

[09:01] All right, so let's just say hypothetically and let's just say let's just say it is

[09:05] Let's just say Willy Wonka is a great game and you love it and it's so much fun

[09:09] Then why isn't it selling right now? Why isn't it flying off the shelves?

[09:12] I'm sure it's still selling but my question is

[09:16] Why isn't it moving as fast or is it gonna lose momentum soon and the answer is yes

[09:20] And I'll tell you why and I've said this before it's not just about making the product

[09:24] I and this guy also on pin sight like stick to your marketing look look my friend and look everybody out there

[09:29] I want Jersey Jack to be super successful and by the way jack happy belated birthday brother

[09:35] I know you might think I'm a terrible person

[09:36] But I have nothing but respect for Jersey jack pinball and I hope he knows that and I hope you share that with him

[09:42] Happy birthday jack

[09:43] But my whole point with jack has always been one thing

[09:46] You can be standing in front of one of the greatest pinball machines

[09:50] And how you launch that pinball machine it does matter and your strategy by which you put the game into the world

[09:58] It does matter

[09:59] And everything that becomes a creative decision on a pinball machine is also part of the marketing process of that game

[10:08] So let's just remove you know the video clips that aren't synced up

[10:12] Let's remove all that from the the situation of launching willy-wanker pinball machine and wanting pinball and wanting that pinball machine

[10:19] To be as successful as possible

[10:21] You know we've said it before a couple just huge mistakes huge mistakes

[10:26] You don't you don't announce 500 collectors editions and then make people wait

[10:33] Seven months to get it. Okay. I mean it's mid-October

[10:36] We haven't even seen it yet

[10:37] I have friends who are in on it and are getting impatient and are getting ready to bail

[10:42] And the thing now is

[10:44] Some of them are just going to go buy a used le from someone and save themselves a lot of money

[10:49] But Jersey jack won't see a penny of that so you don't make them wait the other thing you don't do is this

[10:54] You don't say we're going to make

[10:57] 5,000

[10:58] Limited edition versions of the game and here's why you don't do that because the moment you say that

[11:04] Everybody who wants to get an le is thinking a few things one

[11:09] They're thinking to themselves. There's no way they're going to sell 5,000 of them or or if even if they do

[11:16] That's not limited so there's no urgency to buy it the other thing that's going through their head is well

[11:21] If Jack's going to make 5,000 of these he's going to be making Willy Wonka machines for a few years now

[11:27] I can just wait and I can wait to see what's next from Jersey jack

[11:32] I can wait to see guns and roses. I can wait to see toy story

[11:34] I can wait to see what's next from deep root and from stern and from Chicago gaming and from spooky

[11:40] You almost create an environment in which you are giving your buyer

[11:46] Too much time to think about it and stern does the complete opposite right?

[11:50] 450 L virus sold within 24 hours and the games are inboxes, you know in people's homes within two weeks

[11:58] Two weeks not enough time right?

[12:00] Imagine if you're a signature buyer right now of L. Vira witnessing the le unboxings all 50 those people must be like

[12:08] What the hell did I just do?

[12:09] Why did I spend 5,000 more for a game that's going to sit incomplete in my home now for two years?

[12:15] It's going to happen. It doesn't matter stern doesn't care. They locked in everybody's money

[12:19] So that's what happened. That's the story of Jersey jack pinball to me has always been they make

[12:25] I do believe Jersey jack makes the highest quality pinball machines. I do

[12:30] I think sometimes they might overdo it and and I mean that I think sometimes they might make the games overly complex for people to get into them

[12:39] And I think some of the design decisions in the games have have really hurt their ability

[12:45] To create the frenzy that they need to create

[12:49] When the games are revealed and shipped to customers and you have to look no further

[12:54] Then the moment in which pirates of the Caribbean was shown to the world does everyone forget remember when they pulled the curtain off

[13:02] On pirates of the Caribbean

[13:04] Everybody want it one everybody. I remember that day like it was yesterday

[13:09] I believe it was at expo everybody wanted one

[13:12] It was a dark day for stern

[13:14] The magic of pinball had returned the game was super amazing had all these interesting mechs

[13:20] You know the spinning discs the the trunk the whirlpool the rocking ship

[13:25] Everybody wanted one everybody would have bought one

[13:28] But what happened a year went by and no games even went out the door a year

[13:33] You know you can't give people time to think about it. So jack has cut that time

[13:38] Into only two months now

[13:39] So we do give jack a lot of credit for Willy Wonka

[13:42] Now look Wonka will live or die will succeed or fail it won't fail

[13:47] I think Wonka will be I think it will be a great game for jack

[13:51] I don't think it will be the smash hit that wizard of Oz was for jack

[13:56] And I don't think jack should worry about it trying to reach wizard of Oz numbers

[14:00] I think if jersey jack can start to get two to three games out every two years

[14:07] Okay, that's that's I think a reasonable goal for jersey jack pinball

[14:11] If they can get two to three games out every 24 months

[14:15] I think they're going to see a lot more success you got to give people variety

[14:19] You got to give people options. I mean right now jersey jack pinball is basically a movie theater

[14:26] That is only showing one movie for a very long time and stern pinball is an AMC movie theater

[14:34] That has like eight to ten options every day for you to pick and choose but which one are you going to go into and

[14:40] Keep going into right and they need to just they need to sort of close the gap a little bit and give people more variety

[14:47] But that's my thing. I mean people want to yell at me and move can it is to blame for all the problems

[14:52] No, I'm not you know, there's no no one's right or wrong

[14:56] See that's the other thing too is nobody is ever right or wrong on whether a game is good or bad

[15:02] It's all up to you what you feel about the game if you love October fest great. Doesn't mean I have to love it

[15:09] So speaking of that let's move on speaking of that. I was wrong that Joe ball sur left AP

[15:15] There are a lot of rumors that swirl around that topic

[15:18] But here's what was interesting when doble reached out to me which I appreciate doble reaching out to me

[15:23] He said something in his correspondence that I would be very happy with the third title now

[15:30] That's an interesting thing because if he's listened to any of my shows recently

[15:36] Uh, we've all ripped on Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes and Valkyrie and Pokerron

[15:41] So does that mean that game three which we have confirmation is being designed by Joe ball sur?

[15:49] Do we have confirmation that this title is going to be something outside of those four titles and it will be something

[15:56] We're going to get excited about so I'll say this and I know maybe I'm just like in a better mood today because I'm going on vacation on Monday

[16:03] That's right. You're going to be able to have two and a half weeks of no

[16:07] Canadian pinball podcast

[16:09] Well, that's not exactly true. I'll explain in a little bit what I mean by that. But here's the thing

[16:14] I think American pinball and I've said this before they give you a lot for the money absolutely

[16:19] I don't like the first two themes

[16:21] I don't like the fact that they had a rush and fixed John poppedooks like Houdini disaster that he put on their lap

[16:28] I was a miracle. They got that game out when they did shots are too tight

[16:32] artwork. Eh, I don't know about steam punk and Houdini

[16:36] October, Fez you know how I feel

[16:38] Yeah, we'll just leave it at that just I just never would have gone down that road with that theme

[16:43] But game three is an opportunity for them to show us something and

[16:48] Clearly they have the resources they have the talent

[16:52] They need to make a few adjustments and I think American pinball could make a hit and you know what I feel like those adjustments are

[16:59] They need better art

[17:00] They need the display to look more professional and that's really it

[17:06] Because I think balsar puts a lot of stuff into the game. I think he gives you unique shots unique layouts unique toys

[17:13] I mean October fest is jam packed

[17:15] Put October fest next to Elvira right now put it next to it. Tell me what's got more in it

[17:20] All right, what's more unique? What's more interesting?

[17:23] Oh, man, it's like it's almost like all that fun stuff

[17:25] Just wasted on a theme that people didn't want and then that horrendous art package so they could fix those things

[17:31] And art is really easy to fix

[17:34] And so that's why I'm confident they're gonna get this thing right now

[17:37] What I would have done if I was Davos I'd be like you know

[17:40] Maybe we should hit up canada

[17:42] Get him to sign an NDA and maybe work with him on

[17:45] Picking an artist and figuring out a way to do it. Come on guys

[17:50] My mother's an artist

[17:52] Providence of Florence, Rostivo. She's an artist

[17:55] She worked in the art department. That's where she met my father at Bristol Myers anyway

[18:00] She know you know, I have some genes in me that are artistically inclined all right

[18:04] Bren is opening the door she might make a noise

[18:07] She said something about needing a brush all right

[18:09] So that's the thing I think game three from American pit malt very interesting now

[18:13] But question becomes when will we see it

[18:16] Because we all know that October fest ironically is probably flatlined and even though it's October

[18:22] And I expect to see a piece third game

[18:25] I would say I don't you know

[18:28] Here's a thing they must have learned the lesson by now that the need they need to reveal the game and ship it in a close

[18:34] Window remember they revealed October fest around October and then it didn't ship for six months

[18:40] They can't do that again

[18:41] So hope I think tpf is where we're gonna see the new game from American pinball

[18:45] Right, it's like this weird thing in pinball like if you miss expo then it has to be tpf

[18:50] It's like the other months don't count in the world of pinball reveals

[18:55] Which is silly because with the internet and facebook and media you don't need a pinball show to get people

[19:00] Excited about your pinball game, but pinball is very analog you do want people to jump on it

[19:07] Enjoy it and play it and give that kind of feedback and that you can't get that

[19:12] Unless you have people physically jumping on a machine

[19:16] All right, okay, so that's American pinball all right

[19:19] What else do I want to talk about spooky pinball scott denisi's throwback 80s retro game coming lots of excitement for that

[19:29] People keep speculating that it's gonna be a spooky themed game, you know like a

[19:33] Nightmare in Elm Street or fried at the 13th or a night of the living dead or something like that

[19:39] You know, I night of the living dead is in Elvira

[19:41] It's because I think it was John Romero or I think that's who directed it

[19:45] He forgot to put the trademarking stuff at the end of that movie

[19:49] And so anyone can use it. It's like it's like open IP for for anyone to put in a game

[19:55] So we will see spooky's next game. Will we see it at expo?

[19:59] I don't think so I don't think so because I think Chuck still wants to sell

[20:04] Every single Alice Cooper and Chuck absolutely

[20:08] Absolutely wants to avoid the delay on getting people of the game and everyone is starting to wake up to the reality

[20:15] That you don't need to reveal early. It makes no sense

[20:20] Just just show the game when games are on the line

[20:23] If that that that needs to be the new part for the course with all manufacturers

[20:28] Don't show the game until games are being screwed together

[20:31] All right, because you know people are gonna buy it. They are gonna buy it unless it's called cosmic carnival

[20:37] All right, we'll see if suncoes comes back. Well, I don't know lots of demand for that to happen, right?

[20:42] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world? I did see a

[20:46] Lord of the Rings Ellie for sale on Pinside for $10,500. Wow

[20:51] Wow, maybe I should have kept mine. I bought mine three four years ago

[20:55] Long ago like five years ago for 7,500 bucks

[20:58] It's like it the listing says it has every mod you'd want it has some of the good mods not all of them

[21:05] Lord of the Rings holds a very special place in my heart

[21:08] I still think it's one of the greatest pinball machines of all time

[21:12] And because I love love love how they brought that movie to life without relying on an LCD screen

[21:20] I love it and and it has all the right callouts all the right modes all the right magic all the right toys

[21:28] It has everything you could ask for in a pinball machine in a lot of ways

[21:34] We've gone backwards with relying on the LCD screen. I mean when the games were all below the glass

[21:41] It's incredible. I do love the screen though, too. I'm not gonna lie. I do love having it

[21:45] I think you know we can we can advance pinball and still have magic above and below the glass as well

[21:51] All right, I'm hearing from people on a game

[21:55] That is getting up just just applaud it across the board for being amazing

[22:00] So I do want to give a shout out to mr. Keith L. Win for Jurassic Park Ellie because I am hearing from

[22:06] From Jurassic Park owners and Ellie owners at this game is phenomenal

[22:11] Phenomenal I mean across the board people are loving this game. They're loving the way it shoots. They're loving the toys. They're loving

[22:18] You know the animations in the game and Keith once again has I think he's building an army

[22:25] Of people that are just like Keith fanatics

[22:28] He's he's gonna become so popular that he could go right his own salary

[22:33] Somewhere else one day if he wants to leave because

[22:37] You know, I will imagine Keith making a Jersey Jack game

[22:40] With his design layouts but having even more money to put into the bomb of his games. Oh, oh

[22:47] Jack did he hear me go call up mr. Keith L. And no, so here's the thing if you're pinball designer

[22:53] You probably want to be somewhere that that makes more games

[22:57] Because your games are going to get out there. They're gonna get distributed the right way. They're gonna get

[23:02] Um, you know, they're gonna get the exposure you want and that's what Stern does so well as you know as much as I give them crap for the low bomb and overcharging which we know they are

[23:13] Um, they have a sales force they have a distribution base. They they they make you famous like Stern could take any game and make it famous

[23:20] Whether or not people like the game or not is up for us to decide but they'll make it famous

[23:24] They'll put it on enough stages to give it the right amount of exposure not not every pinball company has

[23:31] That ability it's gonna be interesting to see how deeproot tries to accomplish that with without a distribution model in place the way Stern does

[23:39] Where is deeproot we're gonna find out in like a month right when is that Houston arcade expo? It's like mid to late

[23:46] November and so come November when deeproot finally shows us something we're gonna be able to actually have an opinion about something tangible

[23:54] That's in front of us. I have to imagine

[23:57] Robert is smart enough to know that he just can't come out. It's weird to me that he already said he's gonna come out with not finished artwork and a not full game

[24:07] And it's they're bringing something out to collect sort of uh

[24:11] Do do a feedback a data analysis on on stuff. They're working on I kind of think that's a mistake and and I do

[24:19] I don't think after all this time

[24:22] Why would you show like incomplete art like why would you show a

[24:26] A work in progress like that's not really

[24:30] Gonna win people over I I can't imagine it will especially when everyone else is showing you final games

[24:38] So I mean unless they show us just like a ball like levitating in mid air on a play field and they're like you know more to come at deeproot

[24:46] I don't know. I don't know what they could do

[24:49] Let's see what else is going on the pinball world so um

[24:53] If you want a big Lebowski my friend Sean goodwin is it Sean good? I think Sean's lesson Sean. Sorry, man

[25:00] I should pull up your

[25:01] Your Facebook page right now

[25:04] Yeah, I was right Sean goodwin Sean is selling his big Lebowski and here's the deal with Sean

[25:09] He's a great guy. He needs to sell his game for

[25:12] Medical reasons for a family member. He sold his Corvette. He's raising capital

[25:18] He will sell you his big Lebowski at $18,000 firm

[25:22] So if you are interested in buying a big Lebowski for $18,000

[25:27] Email me at canada pinball at gmail.com. I will put you in touch with Sean

[25:32] It's he's a no-hassel guy you'll have your game in a few days

[25:36] And you can be flipping the big Lebowski and his game is in great condition and everything's working in his game

[25:41] Okay, so Sean I did your favor. I gave you a

[25:45] 2500 listeners of canada's pinball podcast. We'll now know about your big Lebowski for sale

[25:50] Big Lebowski's you know, I keep hearing people defending Barry and saying he's gonna get it done

[25:56] And like I said, I hope he gets it done. I'm interested to see what the little

[26:00] Trinkets are that he's gonna put into the EA games what's interesting is an EA recently bought a new one

[26:07] So we're gonna see very soon

[26:10] What changes Barry makes to the EA versions of the games because he said they're gonna get something special

[26:16] If they bought their game again

[26:18] It sounds so ridiculous to say that that someone had a buy their game again

[26:23] And but when they do they're gonna get something that's amazing apparently so we'll see what that is as well. All right

[26:29] I will not be going to expo people you know that I've told you that I wish I could go

[26:35] I really wanted to be part of the pinball meet the pinball media thing that Ken Cromwell put together

[26:41] I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. I think the pinball personalities out there are super exciting to hang out with

[26:48] And they all do great shows and then everyone you know, well, you know everybody but some

[26:53] I'm not gonna name names

[26:54] But it would have been fun to be part of that royal rumble

[26:57] I might be going on special when lit this weekend Ken and I are trying to figure a time out for that

[27:05] I also interviewed someone that you're going to love

[27:09] Hearing from and that is mr. Christopher franchi now when I said you would not get canators pinball podcast

[27:15] That you would not get it while I'm in Japan. That's not exactly true. So I will be airing the interview with mr. franchi

[27:24] Look for that sometime after expo. So I think maybe

[27:29] Around like October 20 second might be a good day to tune back in the canators pinball podcasts

[27:35] Hint hint wink wink all right

[27:37] Maybe I'll even do some shows in which

[27:40] I record just nonsense and have them scheduled to go up. No, I'm not gonna do that. All right. So here's the deal. Here's the deal with like

[27:48] You know rumours and and and what people have been telling me and and the quagmire is it puts me and you know

[27:54] This I love to just report on rumors. I hear something. I just say it

[27:57] I don't you know, I don't fact check it as much as I should I don't follow up with people as much as I should

[28:02] I don't go to the manufacturers

[28:04] Because this is always what this shows been it's like I just shoot from the hip and I hear something

[28:08] I say something now there are times in which I should be more responsible because it could

[28:14] adversely affect

[28:16] A company or an individual who works at a company and so I will do a better job at stuff like that

[28:21] And the Joe Balls or thing comes to mind for stuff like that like that was stupid

[28:24] I that was lazy of me. I got that in the morning and I put it up and I should have I should have reached out to see if that was the case

[28:29] Okay

[28:30] now

[28:31] But when I hear like rumored titles and what might be next and what could be coming

[28:36] I'm not gonna go check with the manufacturer because I don't care to check with the manufacturers because

[28:41] They're not gonna tell me yes or no on anything that I asked them

[28:45] So it would be a futile effort to do that

[28:48] If you like me wanting to confirm with Stern Pimble

[28:51] Hey Stern do your games really just cost like less than $3,000 to make you think they're gonna confirm that for me

[28:57] We know it cost that because Nick Parks already confirmed it for us

[29:01] All right, and they're still they're still mad at him for that. They're still mad at Nick Parks for that revelation

[29:07] Okay, so here's the thing. I was telling you how excited I was for the Stern's next title from Brian Eddie

[29:13] And it's like nostalgic throwback theme all right

[29:16] So what happens within a few day period?

[29:18] I'm getting ready to like you know tell you what it is and then all of a sudden

[29:22] All the sudden the people that told me this few sources some of them closer to the project than others

[29:30] People are starting to backtrack on me like saying oh like well

[29:34] I didn't really see it and like that's just what I was told and maybe they told me that to like

[29:39] To try and see who's leaking stuff and maybe I'm being set up

[29:42] So maybe you shouldn't say what it is and that now that's what I'm getting

[29:45] That's what I'm hearing from people and you know

[29:48] Imagine if you're in my shoes right and you have a show and you wanted you want to like get excited about stuff

[29:54] You want to like tell the listener something that nobody is saying and then you get something and people are like

[30:01] Trust me. It's real like I know for a fact that this is happening. I don't know why I'm doing this voice

[30:07] But you know what I'm saying? I get that kind of confidence and I get that kind of excitement from people that are knocking on my door

[30:14] And this is like the nature of

[30:17] Bad reporting because there's nothing I can do

[30:20] But as a listener of can a dispinble podcast

[30:22] I think I've realized that you would rather hear the rumor you would rather hear the speculation right or wrong

[30:29] And I think that's the truth in what you would want

[30:33] Now it does it

[30:35] Eat away at my credibility. Does it make me less entertaining?

[30:39] doesn't make me like

[30:41] I don't know like

[30:43] A fraud or a manipulator or I don't know you know, I don't think so. I don't think it really matters

[30:48] It's freaking pinball people. I mean every time

[30:51] Every time I start to feel like any of this really matters

[30:53] I just have to remind myself that you know your help and your wellness

[30:58] and and and having a a warm bed and a dry house is all that matters in life and and your your friends and family like this

[31:07] Pinball this doesn't matter very much. Who cares if I falsely attribute a title to a designer

[31:13] To a company who cares? What who cares if that if you listen to me and then don't buy a game because you're saving up money

[31:20] Like some guy sent me an email say Chris

[31:22] I love the approaches people take to try to get me to say stuff. He says Chris

[31:26] Come on man. He's like I've got my money like about to be tied up in games and well

[31:32] You just tell me what it is. I swear. I won't tell anybody and it's like are you like? No?

[31:37] Like like I don't care

[31:40] What where your money is tied up in pinball?

[31:43] I don't care like if what I know could like change your mind

[31:48] You're gonna find out you're all gonna find out

[31:52] You're all gonna find out sooner or later

[31:54] No title is ever hard to get if it gets announced you could easily this is the part I never get

[32:01] If you have any relationship with the distributor all you ever have to do is call up your distributor and say

[32:08] I want to be on the list for every new le that comes out

[32:12] Just call me and let me make up my mind and I will I will pay you immediately if it's a title that speaks to me

[32:17] If you're a serious pinball person that doesn't want to miss out just do that

[32:21] It's so freaking easy. I don't understand how anyone ever gets locked out of buying a game in this industry

[32:28] Right see stern wants you to believe it's hard to get these games or have to go overseas

[32:34] I'm talking like an idiot again. No, it's not hard to get any stern

[32:38] It wasn't even hard to get a stern signature edition of Elvira

[32:41] I had like I had like 48 hours to make up my mind on one

[32:44] I just like ass stupid and I love it because because JJ over at game exchange

[32:48] I love JJ by the way. He's so fun. He's like he's like trying to talk me out of buying the signature edition

[32:54] He's like he's like man as he's like I can't I can't see it. I can't see the value and I agreed with him

[33:00] But even so I wanted it. I want that's how bad this hobby has us isn't it that even when you know you're getting ripped off

[33:06] You can't help but like jump right into the stupidity

[33:09] So here's the thing

[33:11] Let me just let me just air for you on the end of this podcast

[33:15] Let me just air for you what I heard the rumor was on what Brian Eddie's game would be and I don't know if this is true

[33:22] I don't know if it's false. This could be a hundred percent false. So don't hold it against me

[33:27] You know, so I don't know. I'll just I'll just say that's how we're gonna end this show

[33:31] So ladies and gentlemen a canada pinball rumored title that I haven't seen most people talk about that

[33:38] I think is probably wrong. I'm gonna say that I am hearing or I heard that Brian Eddie's next title might be

[33:46] This

[33:50] Sweet to look

[33:53] You have problem with that

[33:58] This is it

[34:01] No mercy

[34:08] Oh

[34:16] So you can see why I was so excited does that guy like hey Johnny you're a screen puff like what the hell is

[34:23] I never even heard that when I watch that movie like a thousand times anyway everyone

[34:28] I don't know if it's gonna happen. I just take it with a grain of salt

[34:31] I'm just here to tell you what I'm hearing in the in the hobby

[34:34] So I'm gonna be right sometimes. I'm gonna be wrong sometimes, but I guarantee you I will always be entertaining and

[34:42] Always deliver of the best pinball podcast I can to you on a weekly basis

[34:46] But again remember two and a half weeks starting this Monday the 14th. I'm in Japan for my honeymoon

[34:53] And please do not email me where to go play pinball in Japan

[34:58] I'll tell you why when I travel the world the last thing I want to do is

[35:02] Is find where to play pinball? I never understand when people do that who love pinball

[35:07] They travel around the world and they have to find pinball. No

[35:10] I want to have the most expensive on mokase

[35:13] I can find and shove

[35:16] Michelin star rolls of sushi into my face

[35:19] They're not rolls on mokase that fish is actually on top of the rice if you haven't had it

[35:24] I highly recommend it everyone have an amazing weekend. This has been episode

[35:28] 409 of Canada's pinball podcast later
