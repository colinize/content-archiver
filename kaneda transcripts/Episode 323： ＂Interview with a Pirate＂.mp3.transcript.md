[00:48] Because he once had it before

[00:50] His highway pinball is alien pinball machine

[00:53] So I think you're going to enjoy the chat

[00:55] It's an hour and a half, it goes longer than I normally talk to people

[00:58] But that's because I think it was such a good conversation

[01:01] Before I do that

[01:03] And I want to talk a little bit about the Stern Pro Circuit Championship that happened yesterday

[01:07] I want to give a quick shout out to everyone

[01:28] So Mike Revelle, Dave Sanders, painly, Derek Stutzman, Hans Turnquest, and Tom France

[01:36] Thank you gentlemen so much for becoming patrons of Canada's pinball podcast

[01:40] Alright, so yesterday in Chicago, Illinois

[01:44] There was a Stern Pro Circuit Championship

[01:48] The 40 greatest pinball players from around the world

[01:51] We're going to compete for the title

[01:54] Now, you know me, you know me, I don't cover tournament talk

[01:58] But I just wanted to give a few observations of this

[02:00] Because I did check it out and I did go to the stream

[02:03] And I have to say the stream was great

[02:05] It was awesome to be able to just jump in and watch the tournament happen

[02:09] To have the commentary from Jeff Tielis

[02:12] You had Ed Robertson, I think you had Steve Bowden

[02:15] Someone else from pinball profile was there

[02:18] So there was a lot of commentary, but here's the thing that's crazy

[02:21] Here's, are you ready for this?

[02:23] Round one of this tournament took five hours to get through

[02:28] Five hours!

[02:30] When all was said and done, this tournament lasted over 13 hours long

[02:36] Think about that for a minute, 13 hours

[02:39] And went to about midnight my time in New York City by the time it was done

[02:44] And it was funny because I got to catch the final game

[02:48] And the way the final game worked was the final two contestants

[02:52] They had a chance to pick which machine they would play on

[02:55] And this guy picks Star Wars Pro

[02:58] And so literally the guy who picks it walks up to the machine

[03:01] He plunges the ball and it drains within like half a second

[03:04] Like a nanosecond and that was his ball one gone immediately

[03:07] I was laughing so hard at that

[03:10] There was no ball save

[03:12] Ultimately the winner and we want to congratulate him was Andy Rosa

[03:16] He won 25 hundred bucks and he also won a Star Wars Pro machine

[03:21] And he got a belt

[03:23] Here's what's funny about Andy Man

[03:25] He wears a miner's light on his forehead when he plays

[03:30] Absolutely ridiculous and I absolutely love it because I think pinball tournaments are boring as fuck

[03:36] And they need more personality in it

[03:38] Here's what I'm going to recommend they do

[03:40] I think they need to get canada to be the commentator and the announcer

[03:44] Who is part of the stream next time because to keep people entertained

[03:49] It just gets kind of boring because there's just so much you can just say about the play itself

[03:54] You need to have it more lively

[03:56] And look I give these guys credit 13 fucking hours of air time they have to fill during a tournament

[04:03] I mean who really thinks this is the best way to showcase pinball and to get people excited

[04:08] I just thought it was like I don't know I'd rather have 40 people get on a machine all at once

[04:13] And everyone gets one ball and you just go and that's it and who gives a shit right

[04:18] I'm gonna do my own tournament I'm gonna give someone 251 dollar to see who can finish last in a tournament

[04:24] How few points can how few points can you score when you plunge

[04:28] No I kid or do I not all right okay so here's the deal

[04:32] What else is going on in pinball not much we're all waiting for tpf

[04:35] We're all waiting to see what the news will be one little thing one little thing and you know me you know me I'm a nit picker

[04:41] I look at pinball machines and I look at them and I say hey why can't they just get this right

[04:46] And here's one thing that I just saw people are starting to deck out their monsters Ellie's and their monster premiums

[04:52] No they don't have the premiums yet the Ellie's I'm seeing people put brass plating on them

[04:56] I'm seeing people put different armor their powder coating their railings

[05:00] Here's what kills me for nine thousand dollars

[05:04] This is the little canada bitch point of the day for nine thousand dollars why can't why can't the shooter rod housing

[05:12] Right why can't that line up better with the decal on the cabinet and again

[05:18] I know this is nit picking cosmetics but oh my god Stern Stern

[05:23] You are charging people nine thousand dollars for these games look at the gap between the decal and the shooter rod housing

[05:32] Look at how bad it looks I'm gonna upload as the picture of this podcast how bad it is cut out around the shooter rod housing

[05:42] And yes we are a little bit at the bottom of barrel of stuff the bitch about but you know me you know me

[05:48] I want you guys to get what you pay for and this is put this is just so sad that this is what is leaving these factories for nine thousand dollars

[05:58] And they can't make it look better than that other than that guys enjoy your Monday Sunday beginning of the week

[06:06] We're gonna have more shows coming for you you're gonna love this interview enjoy it if you have any any feedback

[06:13] Email me at canada pinball at gmail.com and I will read your feedback on the air have a great day

[06:19] All right ladies and gentlemen our mission to get as many pirates of the care being fanboys on the show continues with Brian

[06:28] You know him is dealt 31 on pinside Brian welcome to the show

[06:31] Thanks Chris glad to be here I'm glad to have you so it's ever since I reviewed a bad version of the game at sunshine

[06:39] It has been like an army of pirate fans at my door

[06:43] Here's the thing it's like it's like you found the pirates like in a dumpster somewhere and like flip it around and turn it on and try to play it

[06:52] I mean that's the problem it's like the guy who you're with and seem to be a real nice guy he puts his long post saying look Chris is not a bad guy

[07:01] Here's the laundry list of issues with this game I mean it was like the game didn't have legs I mean it you know it was ridiculous

[07:08] So I think the problem is is that you just had one that was so bad but again I'm gonna go in some details to why I don't think well I'll stop there but you know no

[07:18] And and surge was great at listing all the issues with the game and I think you know when you play a game on location like pirates

[07:26] It definitely is a game that needs to be set up pretty properly to get the enjoyment out of it now I'm gonna go back and play it again

[07:35] I feel like the pirate fans won't let me live if I don't find a game that is set up perfectly but let's talk a little bit about Brian

[07:44] You you bought the game and I'm and I'm curious you know what made you want to go in on pirates just walk me through it

[07:52] Yeah, so here's the thing and I think that you know one of the things on pirates that I think you keep on kind of harping on a lot

[08:01] Is the code in the depth right and I'll tell you that the one thing that got me about parts was when you first played it and

[08:09] Because I know you talk a lot about oh well it's got to be enticing enough for a brand new play was never seen it

[08:16] To at least get some type of hook into it and I agree with you like I don't think and this is kind of my whole point like I was hunting guys in the boards

[08:26] Okay, this is gonna be the game of the year or game of you know graceful time all this other stuff the game is amazing

[08:33] Okay, but when we talk about this whole you know graceful time I think one year listeners like sent an email saying like why are we even talking about that

[08:41] To waste everyone's time or once got a tenions I totally agree with that guy I mean technically you can't

[08:46] It's subjective it's objective right saying who's the most beautiful woman in the world

[08:52] Exactly right, but it's still kind of entertaining. It's fun. That's kind of what we're doing here to begin with I mean people want to hear

[08:57] Everyone's opinions as long as you support it, but here's the thing as soon as you get the pirate decision look at it

[09:03] There is an automatic

[09:05] Just attractiveness to that play field because there's so much there that your brain is like oh my this is crazy

[09:12] Like there's just so much to look at so much a shootout that there has to be some level hook from that point

[09:18] And if you look if you look at pirates and if you say well Jesus is kind of a boring

[09:22] You know play field and I'm not feeling it. I'm gonna tell you I don't care how deep the code is forget about it

[09:28] You're just not gonna get into it. So I think personally you you know because you talk about a ton and like as a listener

[09:34] Even as a guy that owns it I'm like wow Chris is still talking about pirates like

[09:38] There's definitely something about that game that draws you in and you're

[09:42] Absolutely yeah and we saw this when they first revealed that if we rewind to

[09:48] Pinball Expo of 2017 when they first showed the game

[09:52] It was it was a wow moment for everybody right there. No you couldn't find a person to say a bad thing about the game

[09:58] We were all in love it was a dark day for Stern

[10:00] The delays definitely did not help taking out some of the mechanisms did not help

[10:06] So I do agree that when you stand over a pirate to the Caribbean it is a visually stunning game

[10:12] Exactly I mean it definitely lures you in right so okay so that's my she was it it visually lures you in but then yes

[10:20] Then he takes over and it's like okay I need a tutorial now to understand how to awaken this visually stunning game

[10:30] But see that's that's a beauty I think you mentioned that your last podcast on the for that that these games

[10:36] We're now in this whole new market which is the you know your homeowner market where you bring the pins in

[10:42] And you're not going to necessarily

[10:44] Required as a as a maker of pinball now to have everything out the table within one shot like it did back in the day

[10:52] You know because you know worried about constantly enticing someone just to have that fun at the bar

[10:58] And the thing with greater pirates is that you can just have fun shooting it and have no idea what's going on

[11:02] But it gives you that depth so that you can learn it if you want to you could take it three four five six layers deep

[11:08] Now I would tell you right now that there's definitely an attractiveness to this game that you have that you want to learn more about it

[11:14] And that in itself Chris is is the power of this game the fact that you're still talking about it

[11:20] The fact that you are still just well there's not but first of all

[11:24] Yeah, it's like yes, there's that on some level yeah, there's also not much else to talk about right now I have to say that we're

[11:34] Going to have a whole new bunch of stuff hopefully coming out of TpF, but yes look I

[11:38] I have said on this show many times that when I stand over modern stern machines I am very underwhelmed

[11:46] I think the games are artwork and I think they're on the LCD

[11:51] I don't get impressed by the mechanical and physical games that Stern is giving us which leads me to the Jersey Jack games which I

[12:01] Think everyone would agree are are are physically and mechanically levels above what we're getting from Stern

[12:09] Right so here's my question because when they put two Jack games next to each other and you tell me which one you think is

[12:15] More impressive when you just stand over it wizard of Oz or pirates

[12:19] Wizard of Oz when you first because we're the vise in my opinion rewrote the book of what a pin book and be the next

[12:25] Quentacle generation so Wizard of Oz still just because when I first saw it it just it left such an imprint

[12:31] And it's left such an imprint on so many people that I don't care what is the next Jersey Jack pin it's like that built in

[12:37] It's almost too quick to say nostalgia, but you almost had that like holy shit Wizard of Oz what is this game right so that is going to

[12:45] Stay now just go like the Jersey Jack though as far as just the magic because you always talk about all is not of magic and

[12:51] Pimble and here's the thing I think you very much enjoy the Stern games but those Stern games they don't have a soul

[12:57] They really don't have a soul right now and I like them

[12:59] I mean I have you know walking desert great game

[13:01] But there's something just missing for Stern and that leads you Jersey Jack now the Jersey Jack pins because they tried to bring that magic back

[13:09] The mechanics are so much for challenging and that's it leads them to break down more which is something you always mention

[13:15] Oh, but Jersey Jack games they don't but you know what good for Jack trying to bring the magic back and taking that risk

[13:21] And having those mechanic issues because it's not for Jersey Jack right you're gonna still

[13:25] And again nothing gets turned I love stirring games but Stern's not playing that that ballgame right now they're not bringing the magic because they don't want to

[13:33] Your point you know caused

[13:35] More issues and problems and they have people come back to them. They know where they're niches right they're gonna look for solid pinball for themes people love

[13:43] Jersey Jack those like wait let's just try step up a little bit and they're taking that risk and that's the challenge they're facing

[13:49] Right and I can't blame for it I really can't

[13:51] Well yeah and

[13:53] Right it's a it's a there's two sides to the coin right so Stern's approach

[13:57] Is let's get the best themes let's make these games at a certain price point and let's design them to be as reliable as we can

[14:07] And I also think Stern's manufacturing is just see this is a thing I I

[14:11] I believe this that if Jersey Jack games were manufactured at Stern the quality would be better

[14:19] I think there's a lot of issues Jack has with getting consistent quality from the people who work the line at Jersey Jack and and you have to look no further than

[14:30] Pires because because my thing Brian is like well what good is it then like to to make a better game but make a game with more quality

[14:40] Issues because as we know in pinball I would actually rather have the game that's trouble free than the game that's complex and has me

[14:48] Constantly frustrated

[14:52] Yeah look I think you have to take because I read the stories and read the messages on the on the former pirates and there's definitely been issues but just to go back to your your statement about

[15:01] Stern being more equipped or just better at developing and then producing games my only concern be

[15:08] Stern's not producing these Jersey Jack games I think you'd be pretty confident saying what you just said if Stern was making a game like pirates consistently

[15:16] If they're making game like Wizard of Oz but Stern deliberately doesn't make these types of games because they don't want to deal with that type of nonsense

[15:23] So I'm not sure I could say that Stern would be equally equipped as they are now if they challenged themselves to make games like Jersey Jack does

[15:31] Let's put it pirates on the line in Stern Chicago and let's see how they do and they come out like roses that I would agree with you

[15:38] Yeah, I think we all wish though by now I mean Jack is on game four and it's it's so much more than that

[15:45] And it's it's like at what point are they going to figure out the quality do you think pirates was rushed out I mean I know it sounds silly because it was delayed a whole year

[15:54] But when you look at some of this stuff in the game or like the wire harness is too tight and it's pulling wires off before the games even get to customers on some level

[16:04] Someone walked around that machine and and re I mean they were it almost seems like some of the stuff was just missed at the factory

[16:12] There's no question I completely agree that Jersey Jack or Jack himself said guys let's get this out

[16:20] We have a schedule because here's the thing Jersey's got or Jack's got the next two games obviously with Willy Wonka and Toy Story and G and R

[16:27] They finally are going to bring the themes right that everyone wants and I'm going to go back to why I think Pirates is struggling

[16:33] It's not because the complex code code but there's no question Jack was the guys get these things out of the factory because we have to like start moving shaken

[16:41] So there's no question I think that there's some what I call just complete

[16:45] Complete oversights from a quality perspective some of the some of the issues of these guys are posted on Pinside

[16:52] I'm not luckily mine didn't have these major issues but they're just bonehead mistakes

[16:57] And that's just from the guys trying to get this stuff out and I look I'll tell you though that if you give them a call

[17:02] And I agree with you you're buying a 9000 10000 dollar machine sometimes you know 13000 again collect his addition

[17:08] You shouldn't have to give Jersey Jack call and be like hey Jack what the hell but at this point that was a business move on Jack's party

[17:15] So let's get them out and again I don't think anyone's seeing they were the brick I mean they these things are working eventually

[17:23] But I agree that there's definitely more than then should be there but I'll tell you from from a why is this game not doing quote unquote well or better than others like

[17:32] Here's the thing you talk about the code but I'll ask you this dialed in do you think dialed in has complex code

[17:40] Not I think it I think it gets more complex as you go through but I think dialed in has an easier beginning because it has story

[17:52] Yeah, it's definitely easier and progressions easier

[17:56] The problem with dialed in we all agree that dialed in didn't so well at this point it's down a theme I mean dialed in steam killed it

[18:03] Pirate theme even for me I'm actually before I don't like pirate steam I don't like the movie

[18:09] I don't like anyone does who owns one which is so weird to me but I okay so yeah but it's like people love it despite the theme

[18:17] Which is a marketing fumble by Jersey Jack

[18:21] That's the thing like I'm looking at it now and I look at the skull and crossbones I like that and the arts cool but like if I just think about pirates

[18:29] Pirates the Caribbean I'm not a huge huge fan and you'll say well why did they even do the why they pay for the license why did you

[18:36] Go for a generic pirate theme which is what I suggested and the thing is it's because they want to have some name recognition

[18:42] Because they still want to have some type of hook for the folks in the bar they go what's this game always pirates the Caribbean I know that movie

[18:49] Let me just try it out that's the only reason why they did this right and that's it right but but guess what that wasn't enough and that's why it's not the challenging code in this game

[18:59] It's not it's just people don't want to give a chance and obviously it's a it's a big time purchase right it's not it's not a stern pro you can walk in at 52 51

[19:09] And you walk away they're talking about 9000 whatever it is right so right and I also think when when the theme is not a theme that people like because I think most

[19:18] People I would say the majority of people are not fans of the film franchise the first movie maybe that film that film franchise has has

[19:26] Each movie that came out less and less relevant worse and worse reviews of the films so you don't have a big fan base right it's not very culturally relevant in 2019

[19:35] 2018 and so you're you're shrinking the people who will just buy on theme alone right I mean I think months is a great example of a game where I mean is the game is not like

[19:46] That innovative but monsters does have a fan base and Stern does a good job of awakening a fan base with theme where this game to me just it's like why like why do you know what I'm saying they spend two years

[20:02] Developing a game around a theme that just didn't have a big

[20:06] Inthusiasm base in it and so I don't even think that was grammatically correct

[20:11] But you know what I'm saying like why didn't they just do something else like it's not agree it like I mean I feel bad for Jack because Hobbit was the same thing where the Hobbit films flopped sort of you know they didn't flop commercially

[20:22] But they've flopped in terms of living up to the expectations of Lord of the Rings right then he follows up with dialed in which is just a real

[20:30] Head scratch or theme right and pirates is I would say probably it's sadly it's probably gonna go down is his worst selling game because they're gonna stop production the fastest of any game they've ever stopped production on so what do you Brian what do you think is the reason why you think Jack just wise

[20:49] Dupin was like we've got bigger stuff coming let's just let's just cut our losses on this and move on yeah I think I think costs again I don't have any inside information on this but I would suggest or I would I would I would I would think it's costs on this game that I mean you just look at this game I mean the I know you mentioned oh there's not a ton of toys like I don't know I got the honest I have no idea how you arrive at that conclusion with this type of game right I mean like you have you have not only the best of the best of the game

[21:17] like you have you have not only the best upper playfield which I don't think you don't even know anything about pinball and you like this playfield this rocking ship is amazing right that things awesome I get let's let's go toy for toy because I'm gonna tell you okay I agree with you it is the best it is the best it is the best upper playfield in any pinball game ever easily easily

[21:38] easily you can be sleeping and you know that right now would I have it rocking the whole time not I wouldn't but it's still I that doesn't detract from how awesome it is okay what's the next toy yeah so I like I guess I know this was something to tip me when you were like oh I'm not sure this circle does the middle when it spins the ball but it didn't spin my ball at all like I the spinner of mine every time that ball touches it it moves and it's a lot some is a moves a little bit but it moves I like the fact that that's the answer

[22:07] because to me I always like magnets and games like the amsa and like that will then ran that middle sweet spot where you don't feel like you're exactly you don't feel like you're getting like exactly but I would I would put it's cool not original as we know this it's been used many times before we also it's hard it is hard for me to look at it knowing what was intended I just feel it happens just like randomly and it doesn't okay but I okay so that's toy too I wouldn't say it's like a break through a wow toy

[22:37] so what's the next one well I think that every game look I think I think as a pimp alone or and maybe this is the way I feel every game needs to have the premier toy right okay and it has it with the upper play field not only to have it it's space it's space right so you look you have the premier toy now we're talking gravy Chris we're talking gravy right anything on top of that I'm not gonna disagree like if we were to look at monsters right you know that these games just came out like what would you say the premier the premier toy it would be the lower play field

[23:07] on the Ellie and the premium which I would not consider even in the same league as the upper play field it's kind of boring it's just a lower play field it's not amazing and then you got a magnet in front of Herman and there's nothing really there's nothing else really that's a wow toy

[23:23] monsters is the most inspired him on machine I've seen Commander Stern I mean again I like the theme monsters is fine but I will talk about monsters and well after we finish our pirates this guy we'll go on to some other stuff in the industry so okay so we got the spinning dish what's the third toy that's your favorite in pirates is also a can into on top of that but I that's part of the upper play field which I think that's why it's just a killer upper play field I wish it looked like a can and I don't understand

[23:53] why it looks like a little tray but anyway I'm on couple that's that's for him to I think he resolved that I got a nice someone someone needs to just buy the mod couple and get them exclusively seriously because the modding companies are legitimate they're making legitimate revenue and if I'm Jack I'm like well why don't we just get an exclusive deal and make it and sell these accessories through J.J.P. but anyway I think stern to that with mezel monster didn't stir and have some

[24:23] contract and the toppers to the topers are you do you do yeah so okay so we got the ship we've got the spinning dish what's three on the toilet I so I do like that left ramp I do like the fact that that thing gets pushed and diverted and it goes you know the only prefer that I would put that's my second favorite more than this

[24:43] spinning dish I think it's a really cool ramp I think it's really awesome when it diverts into the world pool I think it's cool yeah everyone likes that I'm okay so this is one after these three which I I would say look okay that's

[24:55] they've three toys in the game it's really nice it'll it falls off from there though right and that's okay like that's three more innovations than we see in most games the next thing see that

[25:09] there's stuff into that just doesn't serve much of a purpose so like the the starry map yeah what what is that so the star map there's two it don't

[25:18] matter thing in the back panel that kind of like sparkles no one can feel it has like constellations right that are supposed to tell you like what's to shoot or that's right so I can say that almost

[25:27] layer seven of of let's call it the the complexity of this game like I personally you can put together and it tells you kind of what the

[25:36] shoot but for me it's more of the aesthetics and I'm not using that as any type of you know point the game I know it's made for

[25:44] something but beyond me it's like there's so much going on to get it you know okay I like the the left the left

[25:51] scoop that shoots out and then if your game is properly balanced it comes down real fast and you can kind of put the flip

[25:59] rub and the ball rolls right over onto your right and it's not toy but it's such as it's a small just to design this game Chris like you

[26:07] were mentioning although it shouldn't be a wide body what like yeah I get a good idea is going to go on the record for

[26:12] retracting that statement I don't know what yeah you know sometimes I just I make mistakes and that was an incorrect

[26:21] assessment of the game so I do understand now I this would not fit into a standard body yeah there's a

[26:29] couple of I mean look you you doing these podcasts I mean I think you post two or three a week so you're doing

[26:33] a kind of I mean I'll tell you and I enjoy the mall I really do I think we don't agree on everything but I

[26:38] just like the fact that you speak your mind and you know you're not you know you're talking so much I it was funny

[26:44] when someone said I was reading the thread and I'm glad like a lot of people are coming to my defense that I

[26:51] will question whether or not I think it's the best ever and someone was like well Jersey Jack will never come

[26:56] back on the show if you know and oh yeah and people are like well I'd rather someone just be honest and then

[27:02] just ask his to get these guys on and here's the thing I know that Jack doesn't listen to any podcasts because

[27:08] even when I talk to him the first time I'm always ragging on him like and so but I because I care you know

[27:15] I'm like I'm like I really want them to be successful and I bet you if I drove to Jersey Jack headquarters

[27:22] he would happily sit down and have a chat and talk pinball because that's the kind of guy Jack is he's just

[27:29] he's you know he's in it to make the best games and I don't think anything I've said has been completely

[27:33] unfair I've said maybe some stuff has been incorrect so okay so we've got the scoop kick out we've got

[27:40] what else is next I mean I'm trying to think of anything that uh so talking about the this is where

[27:47] sometimes I just this is why you know when I do rag on them a little bit or a lot of it at times I

[27:53] just feel like there's a little bit of like overkill at times and I do think like the compass on the

[27:57] apron to me was like first of all it's like it's a compass is not a rectangle right so it's like

[28:06] either design it so that there's a cover over the phone that makes it look circular like a compass

[28:13] but you don't need it it's you know it's like and this is where I'm like you know what so let's say

[28:18] that part in general what do you think that part costs like 20 bucks or I don't know maybe maybe

[28:24] more you're not significant whatever it's not significant I don't think but this is where

[28:29] stern you know stern looks and stuff and they're like well if it's let's say it's 20 bucks it's

[28:33] probably more a thousand units that's 20 thousand dollars right there on something that's not essential

[28:42] yeah it adds up it adds up I agree quickly um okay so we've let me tell you let me tell you what

[28:48] let me tell you what's wrong with the game because I think that we talked so much about this is

[28:52] what the problem is the pirates and I hopefully the code gets updated to reflect this I mean I

[28:56] mentioned once or twice the boards but and again I love I love the game but the problem is the modes

[29:03] okay this game and it goes back to your point about not not having the assets and kind of tie in the

[29:08] theme the modes at this point are just you qualify for a mode you get a very nice LCD I mean

[29:14] gerdy jack does the best in business with the LCD stuff but then you're just shooting shots

[29:19] there's no tie-in of you know what what makes this mode different than that mode and that's the

[29:24] biggest weakness of this game if this game had those modes tied in very much like the hobbit the

[29:29] hobbit does a great job distinguishing oh this mode feels different than that mode and and the

[29:34] music's great the guy to the music of his name David um deal that guy is unbelievable between

[29:40] this and alien and plus some other ones but anyway the modes though they could just make those modes

[29:45] more individualized it would just be so much better so that's what holds it back yeah and and

[29:50] and Brian I'm hearing that over and over on the thread now because I think what's happening is people

[29:54] have had the pin for a enough time where they're they're loving it I mean don't get me wrong people

[30:01] are loving this game and they're saying you know it's just kind of missing that that that last bit

[30:07] of magic right and they're hoping for it and they they are calling the hobbit as an example of

[30:15] where you get it right when you start a mode you sort of feel like you're entering into that scene

[30:20] and this is where though this is where the lack of assets the lack of callouts from other actors

[30:26] in the movie I just think there's not much more they can do to to bring that into the game the way

[30:33] the hobbit implements and because it is all asset driven and that's my that's my biggest like

[30:41] you know that's where I just like I'm saddened by that because they just they can't

[30:45] they can't inject that into the modes because they're just they have such limited stuff to work with

[30:50] I mean think about Batman right that game has like not much from a physical standpoint but

[30:57] Lyman has like there's like 5,000 different sound clips and video clips from the you know the

[31:04] three seasons of Batman that he has to work with to make every mode unique and different and fun right

[31:11] and then they don't have that unpowered so they've they've done the best they could

[31:16] but they don't have so let's say because here's what I keep hearing like when you start a

[31:20] wizard mode there are everyone's like I want the wizard mode to just be magical the way like a

[31:25] there and back again would be or something in the hobbit and I don't get that like I don't get

[31:30] those chills when I play the wizard modes and that's what I'm craving now is that is that a fair

[31:35] assessment of like where people are starting to feel with with with the game I mean actually tell

[31:41] I feel as far as you know pointing out a weakness to this game and to your point it's an inherent

[31:46] challenge they're going to face due to lack of assets right so that makes perfect sense I will

[31:51] I like the challenge of though and see what else they could do to make up for it because you know

[31:57] can they go back and pull some more let's say non you know scenes without actors and and maybe

[32:03] additional light show effects because I think the light show effects it's good but there's probably

[32:07] more in the table there I'm like my only concern now is with the complete apparent you know stopping

[32:12] a production does that put the code on the shelf a little bit I'm not sure I know that they're

[32:17] supposed to come out the new I think it's 1.0 and they actually demoed it during

[32:24] what's his name Jack Danger his his stream of it that was the new code and I didn't see anything

[32:29] that was significantly different for the modes but here here's a thing the game shoots and the game

[32:34] looks and the game plays it's not like it's an imperative thing for me to say well it's going to

[32:37] break it but to get to that G O A T like the Grasital time I need my modes to be a little more you

[32:44] know so I'm out there yet but the game is just in my opinion you know right and I think that's

[32:50] I think it's I think that's a great point and I and for me that's sort of like what keeps me

[32:56] a little bit away is I'm not arguing that the shots aren't great I'm not arguing that it's not one

[33:00] of the most visually stunning pinball machines of all time because it is I'm just worried that it's

[33:06] not going to have that kind of magic that I look for in the in the synchronization of it all

[33:13] coming together and by that I mean I think the greatest games of all time and the classic pinball

[33:19] machines it's a combination of all those things right the wizard modes the music the callouts

[33:25] the shots it just all comes together in this harmonious way and I think Pirates is going to end up

[33:32] being like 80% there but I think the 20% of you know is gonna that holds it back are the assets

[33:40] and and that's why I've always said it was just a head scratcher and look Jersey Jack learned

[33:44] their lesson Brian I mean they're going back to redo toy story because they had the same

[33:50] asset problem can you imagine toy story without like all the characters and the video clips from

[33:55] movies like and they fired the CEO who inked those two deals because of that yeah no it was a

[34:03] clear acknowledgement of what happened I think for many though this game's firing on so many cylinders

[34:09] and the things it does are so special right that they are that they are valuing those things more

[34:15] in the arrogant right that's that's the end game right and I think that's how you get people to say

[34:19] it's the you know graceful time but you know well if we were to put a little bit of a bubble

[34:25] over the hobby I will ask a few years I do think that Stern games have become pretty I don't

[34:35] want to say like cookie cutter but I will say cookie cutter but I say it like this a Stern is a

[34:40] Stern is a Stern like you just know what you're gonna get like you're not gonna see a Stern Pimple

[34:44] and just see a completely radical like imaginative like imagination running wild sort of creative

[34:50] mechanical world under glass you're just not gonna see it I though they'll put the word world

[34:56] world under glass on the artwork and they'll use all this stuff but if you peel back all the art

[35:02] and look at a Stern game as a whitewood there's not a lot so I think

[35:06] prior to the Caribbean in comparison to everything else we've seen over the last like five years

[35:12] I mean it's what people really want right it's but I think people want a little bit more too and

[35:18] that's why I think Willie Wonka and Toy Story and Guns and Runzes could could really be the you know

[35:26] the the moment in which Jersey Jack Pimball comes into I think the company we always have wanted it to be

[35:33] I completely agree look there's finally the themes that everyone wants I mean Willie Wonka I think in my

[35:42] opinion I think you're a little I know people like it I don't think people like it as much as you

[35:47] you might think they do Toy Story to me is the clear champion for Jersey Jack Willie Wonka God

[35:54] blessed I hope it does well but it doesn't have the mass appeal that Toy Story is the juggernaut

[35:59] and J.D. P's are I agree I look yeah there's a reason why and and I've been really touched on this

[36:06] on the show but there's a reason why Jersey Jack is going back to Warner Brothers which is who has

[36:13] the license for the Wizard of Oz and they had and Jack has worked with them for years now and

[36:22] and look at everything that's in Wizard of Oz Pimball right they have a ton of assets

[36:27] it's only when he went to Disney with pirates that it was a struggle and same thing with

[36:32] Toy Story would have been similar but Willie Wonka is not as big as Toy Story in terms of

[36:38] current popularity it's it is a timeless classic like the Wizard of Oz the reason why I do like

[36:43] Wonka though is I do think Wonka it's it's it's just the gene wilder it's just so classic I think

[36:50] everyone has seen it many many times it probably doesn't get repeat watched as much as the Toy Story

[36:57] movies do for people yeah but it's also a different demo right I'm 42 years old and Brian Howell

[37:03] to you 37 okay so you know not not worlds apart so I grew up I definitely had seen Willie Wonka

[37:12] many times I definitely have seen the Toy Story movies many times I think toy here's the thing

[37:17] Toy Story though doesn't appeal as much as Wonka as you start to get to the older demographic within

[37:24] Pimball so once you know when you get to guys who are maybe 55 plus I think a lot I hear people

[37:32] being like Toy Story stupid you know and it's like what like how you say I still think the first

[37:37] movies were the greatest movies of all time but I think Willie Wonka and Toy Story I think most people

[37:45] are fans of both I think some people like one don't like the other I think they both here's

[37:52] the here's the most important part they both translate to Pimball perfectly I think I think Toy Story

[38:02] will only back up I personally like Willie Wonka more than Toy Story I also remember just you

[38:08] know when I was younger watching the the gene wilder version I mean that there's something special

[38:12] about that movie just the magic around the the chocolate factory and that could translate really

[38:17] well to the magic of Pimball I mean it makes a lot of sense but Toy Story similar to how apparently

[38:24] you know Harry Potter it is like this absolute insane franchise and if it were to get grounded by

[38:29] you know I know that Stern apparently or there's been talks but Stern getting it like Harry Potter

[38:33] has this huge following that I was kind of surprised about I think Toy Story is kind of similar

[38:38] where it's at each level right of young people you have older people you'll people that will

[38:44] make fun of it and then love it because they're kind of concerned about you know embarrassing themselves

[38:48] for some reason I have no idea but I'm telling Toy Story is going to be just an unbelievable if they

[38:54] make it well which you know Jersey Jack they're designs no one's ever questioned the quality of

[38:58] their designs so you know the the table be there and finally the assets finally the theme right

[39:04] it's like this is going to be it right now Willy Wonka I mean Pat Lawyer man dialed in what an

[39:09] amazing computer how's doing both of them it's pat that's right pat's in Toy Story 2 so I mean

[39:15] it's like I just feel so much there's so much going on for Jersey Jack right now that he's

[39:20] got to just knock us out of the park this is the year I think you mentioned this too like this is

[39:23] this this is the year for this guy to just kill it I mean absolutely kill it these two and then

[39:28] Guns and roses forget it right right yeah knowing that he should kill it what do you think could

[39:36] go wrong in this scenario well I think it's all about delivery right and I know that I think

[39:43] it was your last podcast you said well apparently Wonka's done and as soon as they announced it

[39:50] they're gonna you know be able to ship it pretty soon and I think to your point earlier on if

[39:54] pirates was shipping in six weeks from the time that it was released or the time it was shown I

[39:59] mean Pinside and again Pinside it's kind of negative I love the website but like there's

[40:03] all you know it is what it is but people love pirates when it was released that time right and it's

[40:08] like as long as Jersey could give it to them they would buy it and he couldn't do that so as long

[40:13] as Jack can just get this game out for Willy Wonka if he gets it out because you know law is going to

[40:18] bring it you know the assets are there everything is like it's like just deliver it this guy will be a winner

[40:24] now here's here's what he needs to do and someone needs to post this on Pinside the tell LTG to

[40:32] tell Jack this the last LPG yeah right he's like they're lost in a service dude the last

[40:38] smart the last sort of issue this is the issue with production that Stern gets so right that I

[40:47] think Jersey Jack could fumble this again because here's the thing history has shown us that Jack

[40:53] will reveal a game and it's still going to be a long way to get it now Stern does not even reveal

[40:59] a game they don't let you know what it is they don't let you see it they don't tell you the matrix

[41:04] they don't do anything until that game is already on the line and in a box on a ship heading to

[41:13] Europe like they that when they every game they reveal the game's already being produced like they

[41:18] they are super secretive about protecting the leaks and they are making the game by the day you

[41:24] first hear about it what I don't want Jack to do is get caught up in the excitement of revealing it

[41:32] and reveal it and then make people wait you know even like two three months I think he needs to reveal

[41:39] it and have it ready to go like within a month and and I know people will wait but I'm just a little

[41:46] I don't see the point why even reveal it early here's why I think he does it and again it goes back

[41:51] to the two different business models you have Stern who sells the LEDs and the LEDs get

[41:56] gobbled up by the the true people who want them plus the scalpers so they're gone I mean

[42:01] Stern doesn't do anything about those they're already bought then they're selling you the pro and

[42:06] Stern knows that with the cost of that pro somebody is definitely more likely just to pick it up

[42:12] and buy it and give it a chance because it's not that nine thousand dollar price point right I think

[42:17] Jack needs to he needs to build in some level of just drop not once a drama but just like you know

[42:23] hype right because this is not at five k machines it's not a 52 50 this is going to be a nine k

[42:29] another standards but who cares for the standards someone like standards right so you got the LEDs

[42:33] at nine k you got the 13 CE right you got to have some level of hype you have to have some level

[42:39] and as long as that hype is controlled so it's not nine months ten months a year and a half later if

[42:44] it's two months that hype's not going anywhere you're saying yeah so he needs to reveal so he just

[42:51] keeps people from buying other stuff so they though they'll hold their money for him if they know

[42:57] the weight won't be arduously long exactly right and that no I get that and he's showing up

[43:04] more high caliber product so I hope he does it I hope he does it I hope he I think he's made the

[43:10] smartest move ever by pausing production of pirates of the Caribbean and he also is making a smart

[43:18] move by doing another run of wizard of Oz because that's just that's Jack's annuity that's his

[43:25] Honda Civic he's sold over four thousand of them and he's gonna he's gonna sell another

[43:31] however however many yellow brick roads he makes he will sell I mean there's the demand for that game

[43:37] just keeps growing globally so that'll that's good because now he doesn't have like a deadline he can

[43:43] keep the line going till he gets to wonka so we'll see I mean the rest of it we don't really know so

[43:50] I gotta tell you though yeah I gotta tell you though the yellow brick road I'm much as confident as you

[43:55] are as far as people's first and let me tell you why if Jersey Jack it Jack doesn't keep that below

[44:01] 300 400 because you know that will just cause the collector wants just you know limited edition to

[44:07] get it if he makes too many you have people they're dying for wizard for for for wonka dying for

[44:14] toy story they've seen wizard of Oz they played wizard of Oz you can powder coat at yellow blue

[44:18] green red who cares right let's get the new stuff out so I might want to hold my money and not buy a

[44:24] brand new yellow brick road which is a game I played you know 2000 essentially 2013 which stripped

[44:29] down mechanics or at least the the rumor is they're gonna do a little bit less I'm not sure I'm

[44:34] I'm that confident him selling that many if he doesn't have some type of limit on it right to be honest

[44:39] yeah right well the thing is I think he's in a little bit of a sticky situation with how many he

[44:43] makes of of another was run because he's made a thousand emerald cities I think there was a

[44:50] thousand ruby red editions and then the rest maybe there were a little bit more the rest of them

[44:56] were the standards if he makes only 250 yellow brick roads now all of a sudden those become like

[45:03] the collector's edition the rarest version and he's also making some mechanical tweaks to the game

[45:08] as well which will be interesting right are we gonna lose the flying monkey are we gonna keep

[45:14] the flying monkey is is what other changes will happen we're gonna know in two weeks at tpf

[45:19] what the game is all about but then I also heard jack is telling people that he needs to order

[45:26] if he only orders 250 parts it's not worth his while to make the game and that's why we're gonna

[45:32] see closer to 500 to a thousand of those but I do agree you know if if you want a wizard of

[45:38] us so here's the challenge right if you really want a wizard of us you can go get one now a beautiful

[45:45] you know emerald city version with the wood apron with the new light boards for like $7,000 to

[45:51] $7,500 right so why would you go spend 9,000 for like the third limited edition version of the game

[45:59] the only reason you do it is if you have a limited quality and that's my point right so I don't

[46:04] you got direct print too some of those direct print the emerald city right so I mean that's the

[46:08] the nicest one out there and you can get it for like you said 7,75 so unless they limit this

[46:13] quantity exactly what am I going out spending a ton of money to get a yellow version of wizard of

[46:17] us and let me tell you if the monkey's gone if the actual toys are compromised forget it and then

[46:23] I mean I don't know what's going on right so well and the other the reverse problem is let's say

[46:27] you have people there who love the wizard of us and let's say he improves something that is

[46:32] mechanical and new then you're gonna have people selling their old waz is to get the new one and then

[46:38] you have even more of a flooding of the market of wizard of us so all right so 2019 so Jack

[46:46] looks like he's got a lot of good stuff coming down the pipeline storm pinball we don't really know

[46:51] everything coming out the rumors are Jurassic world does that title appeal to you big time so Jurassic

[46:58] Park from Data East I just hate the way Data East feels those games so cheap that but I love that

[47:04] game I mean that and you said game is rising like every time I check pinside versus 28 now it's 32

[47:09] and that's 36 like that game's going up so the Jurassic franchise is a great franchise that that

[47:15] game is going to sell a ton in my opinion as long as they just you know don't compromise too much

[47:21] around just the magic around it obviously it's a stern so you like you said it's going to be built

[47:25] on this foundation that we all know it's like the chassis that they've been using for like eight

[47:29] nine years they just kind of tweaked you know the bells and whistles here and there but that game I'm

[47:33] counting great franchise to do I mean knowing that the Jurassic Park game from Data East had the

[47:40] T-Rex that bent over right and picked up the ball yeah that is the bar and I just hope that stern

[47:47] has something that is awesome and dino magical like that because if it's just like a T-Rex

[47:55] bash head where there's a magnet in front like Herman monster magnet I'm getting a little I

[48:00] feel like stern is they're becoming a little bit of a partspin company for me where they you

[48:05] can see where it maybe the old designer ramp different here and there but for the most part the

[48:11] stuff that the ball interacts with it just feels like it's all the same like when's a lot like

[48:16] what is the last great mechanism that stern pinball designed well look the hybrid maybe I don't

[48:26] I guess that that star wars to get I mean I'm not even sure because it's like they haven't it's

[48:31] constantly they're focused on that's what's not their thing I'm trying to think what's the best

[48:36] recent all of ghost busters I love the madness links I really thought those are cool right and

[48:41] that fit the theme really well that was stern's in my opinion terrible shooting game I tried to buy

[48:45] I bought twice because I love ghost busters so much but it's so it's a shoot so bad but the

[48:50] madness things were great the joke though I'm telling you if stern doesn't bring the toy for this

[48:54] game for Jurassic the joke would be that what I'm not sure when Jurassic Park come out at 91

[49:00] well 90 yeah I'm the first yeah way better and and that's stern right stern was DDE so if stern

[49:07] can't actually beat their own damn toy right because stern was DDE's I think I mean it's embarrassing

[49:13] I mean we could even see them we're on a mechanical level even do anything as interesting

[49:20] as as Lord of the Rings or even I mean even Simpson pinball party I why do they need to why

[49:26] do you think exactly so successful what they don't need to I totally agree I'm just trying to see

[49:31] like what your Jurassic Park was you got me interested in it so I think it's 1993 so that's the

[49:37] thing is this too is I would just rather than make a Jurassic Park another Jurassic Park game a new

[49:44] there it's gonna be Jurassic World I'm always nervous when the newer films like I did like the

[49:50] first Jurassic World some people hated it the second Jurassic World was was terrible so I don't know

[49:56] it's if it's gonna have the same magic as the first if you made it on the first game that's the

[50:02] same thing for Toy Story I would just rather it's easier when you just have one movie like Willy

[50:08] Wonka versus like four or five movies to have to like build it around but you know look stern is

[50:14] gonna do what Stern does Jersey Jack I think has a year where they could steal market share

[50:19] Chicago gaming company is supposed to be coming out with cactus Canyon and then an original

[50:26] licensed theme game so what do you do like do you think there's gonna be a love affair with cactus

[50:32] Canyon coming back and I heard they're getting the original coder to finish the game I love I love

[50:40] what that company is doing I have a Tafram Mars remake Ellie I just bought a monster bash

[50:46] you know older game but just it's beautiful I just love what they're doing I have no idea why

[50:52] in the world they're doing anything original no idea it just it's not it's not in a well it's not

[50:59] an original original game like like Steve Richie's Black Knight 3000 it's an original licensed

[51:05] theme game so it's it's it just means they're not making a remake it this is a licensed game that

[51:10] they're doing from the ground yeah yeah again just keep it these guys are making I think good money

[51:17] with these remakes they're doing everyone a good service that they're priced right I mean that's

[51:22] fine but the cactus Canyon I don't look I think that's a very rare game I haven't personally play

[51:27] it too much although I played the one when I was traveling for business I went to the city and

[51:31] went to that place sunshine you always talk about never been there before and I walk up and

[51:37] there's a cactus Canyon in the corner that's like it's so random like what this game is like a

[51:43] really rare game it's like and obviously you know this because you do there at the time but for

[51:46] someone who's never been there before it blew my mind away this guy's got a game that expensive

[51:50] or at least that rare just sitting in the corner by itself in a dark yeah it just was amazing but

[51:55] down he's got like I think he has like he had like a when I first went there it was just the front

[51:59] of the laundromat and he just had like a big bang bar like next to a dryer and I'm like yeah it's

[52:05] it's how they do he's got a Beatles diamond next to a supreme it doesn't matter how rare the game is

[52:12] I mean he would put a natural location and let people just beat it the shit it's it's just the way

[52:16] Pete does it yeah well I think it's smart it's black and then to do this do you think black night

[52:22] 3000 is gonna be successful terrible idea absolutely terrible idea listen I'm not the I got in

[52:31] this hobby you know I don't four or five years ago I'm not I was never like big big into

[52:35] Pimble when I was growing up but I played the classics like Am's family I have no interest at all

[52:41] on this black night 3000 I love Steve Richie though so I'll give it a chance because I think his

[52:45] games like the getaway as simple as that game is I just love it so obviously give it a chance but

[52:50] this is stern I had no idea I mean this is there their playbook does not include a game like this

[52:56] and so they're really nervous I mean I I know people at Stern and and they're nervous now here's

[53:02] what I think they're gonna do I don't know if I might have mentioned this I think they're gonna

[53:06] have a vault edition ready to go real quickly alongside of Richie's game so if it if it starts to look

[53:13] like it's a sales flop they're gonna be like congratulations Stern vault or Tron vault edition or

[53:19] something else that people have wanted Tron vault there aren't many vaults that they can go

[53:24] do they're right because if you think about it they made a lot of trons like it Tron wasn't it's

[53:30] just a Tron elite people want so it would have to be a vault based with the on the LE with the

[53:35] fiber optic ramps that what would be interesting is if they would put an LCD and Tron yeah which they

[53:44] would I would think but I don't know again someone had good point of pinstead because uh you know people

[53:49] were saying well look it's definitely a game people want below blood but then the cost you think

[53:53] what the cost of a Tron vault and what the pricing structure would be on that it's gonna be pretty

[53:59] expensive um so I just don't know the value unless to your point they put LCD but didn't go man say

[54:05] there's no there's gonna be no LCDs on their vaults I thought I mean he could be they could change

[54:10] their plan yeah that's what he said I mean I don't think it would be that hard for them to switch

[54:16] over to the new platform with with the number of people that they have over there in the in the

[54:20] coding and engineering department they won't do it though to your point Stern just makes every game

[54:25] to be around two to three thousand dollars so anything that has a significant increase in the bomb

[54:30] of the game they're just not gonna do it because they don't have to because up until now they've

[54:35] looked around and no one else has their shit figured out and so you can't blame them for removing

[54:42] stuff for cutting some corners or going cheaper on the wood or this or that or whatever the stuff

[54:47] they've done because they keep making more and more money and they keep growing the they're the ones

[54:52] who are growing the Pimball industry I mean that's there's no doubt about it so where do you think

[54:57] deep root fits in because they're just like the enigma waiting are they gonna pull a Trojan horse

[55:02] and just rock in a tpf that's why that's my theory they're gonna Trojan horse the entire tpf that would

[55:09] be awesome here's what I understand about that place that the deep root you have you have really

[55:14] you know town the people working there they're not they're not working in like you know Australia

[55:20] or like some random you know area in the world they're in Texas right so why why is there no

[55:27] media coverage or any type of like inside look at anything that they're doing like at this point

[55:33] you have titles potential titles you have potential timing that keeps on changing but how

[55:38] do these guys able to just cover so many machines are they doing like four or five the plans four or

[55:43] five to release how are they able to cover this up so well I mean they're working with many people

[55:49] they have to work with parts and manufacturing like how are there no leaks I mean easily I mean

[55:54] Robert is a lawyer and they they have probably all been told what will happen if any leak happens and

[56:04] that stuff happens all the time you have low level employees that are going to be in and out of that

[56:08] place they're not there's definitely opportunities I just my point is I'm not sure maybe they just

[56:13] they are so do you think Brian there's like there's nothing too leak or do you think that because

[56:19] to your point if if there are like low level employees who could

[56:24] snap a photo here and there and upload it I think what's happening down there I think they're

[56:31] kind of all really proud of what they're doing I haven't seen anything so I'm not chilling I've

[56:37] seen nothing but I do think there's a sense of what we're working on here is going to be game changing

[56:43] and everyone feels a sense of pride and ownership that nobody nobody wants to be the one to hurt their

[56:48] chances to be successful the thing is this is at some point they have to deliver and what they have

[56:57] to deliver has to raise the bar and based on our conversation earlier tonight you know Jersey

[57:05] Jack has raised the bar significantly so they have to go over that bar and they have to charge

[57:12] according to what they've been saying they're going to charge less money to give you more than that

[57:18] how's that going to be possible I mean I can say it happened just from an investment perspective

[57:23] they're willing to take and I think also the margins the margins and pinball again I don't have the

[57:28] inside info but just from what I've been hearing the margins and pinball are absolutely insane okay so

[57:36] I think if deep route right kid can maybe just trim the margin a little bit and take a little bit less

[57:40] they're willing to just take that as a competitive advantage to get their name out there now why

[57:45] the hell they're doing original IPs over there as opposed to just getting what I think is the the

[57:50] recipe for success which is again IP preferably one from the 80s I don't care what it is goonies

[57:56] whatever it is and they have one apparently they have one I think that's a really good idea but they

[58:00] should all be franchises you know and just absolutely nail it with these three or four releases you

[58:05] have great developers a great designer sorry why are they doing original I have no idea you know

[58:12] just this one issue I mean they because Robert Robert fell in love with John stuff like everybody

[58:17] else did and it's hard not to I mean now even when I saw that guy listing that magical for sale

[58:23] you see it again and it's still just like it's hard not to just be like wow and I think there's

[58:28] a little bit of the stars in the eyes when you see a J pop machine but also you know J pop

[58:33] machines are inside baseball like only the the hardcore people who love pinball even know who

[58:39] the fuck J pop is you know when someone walks in to a distributor to buy a game and he sees Star Wars

[58:45] Ghostbusters magic girl he's gonna buy Star Wars or Ghostbusters the casual guy who just wants a

[58:51] game in his game room you know he's not gonna he doesn't care who these like designers are from

[58:56] yester years of pinball so I think there's a maybe in a miscalculation right on the popularity of

[59:05] these games if they mass produced them and the other part is John's Zidware stuff was cool because

[59:10] it was limited it felt like the Bugatti right the I'm only gonna make 20 of these and then it's

[59:16] like an FU to the pinball world right you make 2000 of them yeah it's everywhere everyone's got one

[59:23] doesn't feel special not nearly a special and like again Debris wants to get the game out there

[59:28] you want to get the biggest market you get the biggest market by having the best franchise

[59:32] as Stern's done a day in day out so my point is maybe phase two phase three jump into the originals

[59:38] but I just don't know the strategy so look I really hope they're successful because to me they

[59:43] represent a company that wants to bring magic back like J.J.P. does but they want to bring it to you

[59:48] for a cheaper cheaper you know expense which that's a win-win to me as a pinball so of course I want

[59:55] to succeed but how in the world in 2019 where everything leaks everything okay who it is

[01:00:01] how can how many lawyers are forget it everything leaks how does nobody have anything on these guys

[01:00:08] so how far away well so then what are you saying you think there's nothing in there I think I

[01:00:12] think they're incredibly behind and they have sketches but I'm telling you I personally again I

[01:00:17] don't have any inside information I just question just from the pure common sense perspective how do

[01:00:22] we have nothing yet from these guys Zippo there's zero it's funny you say that because I know Jeff

[01:00:28] at this weekend pinball and he went in there and he saw stuff and then I've also I've heard for

[01:00:33] some people at deep route where they're saying we're much further along than people realize that's

[01:00:39] why I think the Trojan horse is coming I think Robert and Barry Eowett and and John Norris and John

[01:00:46] Papadu I think they're gonna pull some sort of moment I mean look we it was supposed to be the five

[01:00:51] days of deep route I'm not even sure when those five days are happening but it's gonna have to happen

[01:00:58] this year has to listen to me if this happens to leave describing which I would just be a static it

[01:01:04] would be do you watch wrestling at all back in the day absolutely it would have been like when

[01:01:08] whole game like Nash like we're actually on the same side and WO it would be it would be NWO type of

[01:01:14] shit where people are coming out like and just crashing the entire place and and they've come up

[01:01:18] their own music I mean that would be epic so I I hopefully they do that but my common sense my

[01:01:24] gut is like what are we doing where we going but I love the idea of it so hopefully you're right now

[01:01:30] the awesome yeah I mean Robert I think he's doing it right with with this shroud of secrecy it's how

[01:01:38] you do it when I when I look at like Riot pinball showing us the the schematics for the Vahal again

[01:01:44] I'm like what do you guys do like this this is where we're at that we're we have a company that

[01:01:49] couldn't sell wrath of Olympus is now just revealing schematics to do what to to put all this

[01:01:57] effort into something and you don't have a manufacturer locked like I I applaud people's effort

[01:02:04] to make pinball I do I think it's great I want to see more pinball machines but if you want to be

[01:02:10] a successful company and you want to sell your game in the pinball industry you need to be very

[01:02:16] protective over your IP and over the the hype of your game if you spoil it and you show people

[01:02:24] how the sausage is made over a period of months if not years you are not going to have excitement

[01:02:30] when the game finally goes up for sale if you if you draw it out too long and history has shown that

[01:02:36] agree agree these guys are going for an all-in or all-out approach meaning if they're going to do

[01:02:43] it they're going to just drop it on us literally everything at once or they're just yeah like like

[01:02:48] Brian like how silly it was to announce we're remaking kingpin all right where the fuck is it

[01:02:54] those guys were at tpf last year that's that's what's crazy is like that's another game that's

[01:03:00] coming out like when but see I can understand one of those guys are doing that because listen

[01:03:06] there's so much volume to get through in the pinball now people coming out left and right

[01:03:10] those guys are trying to get on the map right so they're they're strategy is let's

[01:03:14] release announce something so that we put a stake in the ground and we go from there I don't I don't

[01:03:19] necessarily blame them look they're they're an uphill battle beyond belief so I don't I don't

[01:03:25] well I think they need a manufacturer right and I think I think American pinball might actually be

[01:03:30] the answer for them do you think October fest how does it sell listen October fest I got to tell

[01:03:36] two things number one you talked about the you know not coming on October listen here's the thing

[01:03:45] do you like do you like women I'm married to ones I hope so okay do you like do you like do you

[01:03:51] like beer I love beer okay now do you like women and beer throughout the entire year absolutely okay

[01:03:59] therefore not not not plural I think what I'm listening sure Brenda you know you know what he's

[01:04:04] talking about that means October fest can come out literally any day of the week okay it's about

[01:04:08] beer it's about women it's about pinball the whole thing about me and come out October forget it

[01:04:12] stop it right number two the game itself is such a good shooting game it looks good I haven't

[01:04:18] personally put my hands on it but and I mentioned some reforms what in the hell is going on with

[01:04:25] the audio video and just the art package I that that it just right now it's personally like I think

[01:04:31] you mentioned to like just the art is it's it's like I think you said someone exploded it's exactly

[01:04:37] what it looks like there's art everywhere even the side panels have ton of art on as well and

[01:04:42] there's Waldo somewhere somewhere in there is like I think Dovel's wearing like the Waldo outfit

[01:04:49] it is it's like you can almost pass out trying to you know look around that machine but the thing

[01:04:54] it's bringing my opinion some some it just it's very appealing to to want to shoot but I think

[01:05:01] they're just kicking themselves in the ass which is you know I I feel maybe cutting down a bit on

[01:05:07] the the costs for especially the the animations and things like that I know people are saying

[01:05:12] oh it doesn't matter but I know for me I like to have the full package at least represented and

[01:05:17] that kind of tracks from the experience now has itself I mean this thing is got because I don't think

[01:05:24] the video is going to be or the those animations are going to be really improved anytime soon I think

[01:05:29] the audio is definitely a killer for some people I think it's okay there's stuff with some issues

[01:05:34] there this thing doesn't shoot like dialed in which is an amazing shooter this thing does not shoot

[01:05:40] like butter then forget it this game is done like because the art package videos not there the

[01:05:46] cost is is definitely good I know some people are saying oh it's a lot less than changing people

[01:05:50] guess what it's not that much less you're still spending 7000 plus tax and who you know right so it's

[01:05:55] not stirring proce you're still putting up I would say a premium so this is for for $7500 so this is

[01:06:03] a lot a company like American pinball they're selling to the pinball community they're not selling to

[01:06:08] the broader community you're not going to bring in new people with October fest I just did a whole

[01:06:14] week long exercise with and house or bush and bebs clients over how do you bring new people in

[01:06:19] new categories so the way you bring new people in the pinball is through theme and that's what

[01:06:23] Stern does really well right guards in the galaxy if you're a fan you you know you're bringing in more

[01:06:28] people than just pinball enthusiasts but a game like October fest you're talking to pinball people

[01:06:32] now here's the rub $7500 for an October fest I can go get a dialed in Ellie right so on just a level

[01:06:43] unless opening up new inbox is the most important thing to you you can get a lot of really really

[01:06:49] good pinball for $7500 now right and so that game needs to compete not just with the new games at

[01:06:58] that price but the recently new games that are also available at that price and that is when it

[01:07:03] starts to look you know a little mediocre right in some of those areas of animations and sound and

[01:07:10] art and I think they need to hire people to improve in those areas and they haven't though this

[01:07:17] still seems to be the Josh and Joe show for the most part I know they got fair donkoding as well

[01:07:25] is great but those animations are not going to change I do think the game shoots good I do it

[01:07:30] looks really good this it looks really fun to shoot but yes you know the problem now is with so

[01:07:35] much competition and this is the same problem pirates has right it pirates of the Caribbean as a

[01:07:40] problem because of certain issues these guys have certain issues if you're not the full package

[01:07:46] if you're not the full package I think it's hard to be commercially successful and if the arts not

[01:07:54] good it's see the art being bad is even worse than code being too complex or lack of wizard modes

[01:08:02] on pirates right because people most people don't even get the wizard modes on any game to begin with

[01:08:07] right but when they walk up to a game they want it to be sexy it's like you know to the point of

[01:08:13] women you still want to wake up in the morning and your and your wife is still hot and so that's

[01:08:18] what pinball is like you're not playing it when you're not having sex with the machine it still looks

[01:08:23] good you know it still looks good and that's and pirates fits that bill for people I don't know people

[01:08:28] are gonna want to look at that art all day long and it's a shame because art should be easy to get

[01:08:35] right in 2019 for pinball yeah look I I agree I think the American pinball it's impressive that

[01:08:44] they're able to manufacture who did as well as they did that that's a game that I think try to

[01:08:48] bring some magic much more than stern you never heard of any issues so I applaud them for that

[01:08:53] because that was their initial offering so they definitely confirmed or least prove themselves they

[01:08:58] can manufacture a relatively challenging game they definitely have good design who do you

[01:09:02] need I'm not a big fan of but this one looks much more attractive release the fun to shoot I am

[01:09:08] kind of back and forth though on on how the art will be perceived especially on how this game does

[01:09:14] on on route and the reason why I say is because you know this is a perfect fit of absolute perfect fit

[01:09:19] for a bar and you know would would would an owner buy it because it has you know relatively

[01:09:25] attractive girls and has beer like they could just bring in because of that I think people would

[01:09:30] at least press that start button because they're seeing girls and they're seeing beer so I think

[01:09:35] I think they'll bring it to the table the question is it's like to your point can you just step it

[01:09:40] up a little bit with the with the animations and the video because again they're bringing a lot

[01:09:44] of the harder parts to the to the game it's like they're they're fumbling what shouldn't be that

[01:09:49] that hard obviously you know there's different variations but this thing in my opinion is really

[01:09:54] struggling in that area yeah they just need a creative director I mean I I work in an industry

[01:09:59] where there's a lot of creative people and and I come up with concepts like I'm a concept during my

[01:10:04] profession but I'm not like a designer and I'm always amazed when you when you when you stand over

[01:10:11] something that needs to be designed properly certain people just have a knack for it and they have

[01:10:16] an eye for it and others don't and clearly they don't John Papaduke is one of the greatest

[01:10:21] pinball designers and he's a creative director like he told you know he helped zombie Yeti he

[01:10:27] told he had a vision for what he wanted same thing that's why like look at you know John Papaduke's

[01:10:34] artist and what he gets out of them and then look at other designers and pinball what they get

[01:10:38] out of their artists like look how you know piss poor the artist on dialed in like that's what

[01:10:42] that's that's what Pat Lawler thought was good enough for his game John Papaduke never would have

[01:10:48] let one of his games go out looking like that so we'll see what happens I it's again it's just

[01:10:53] gonna be hard for them because the you know did they miss their window now as I said in my last

[01:10:58] podcast luckily for these guys this game is going to be shipping and on the line when nothing new

[01:11:04] is really out so they're gonna have about like a month to two where nothing new is shipping

[01:11:11] yeah I think it didn't get it out and it truly do it's it's the best opportunity for them to do

[01:11:16] as well as they can I just think this game is gonna come out and then sell slow and very similar

[01:11:23] to a he duty market which is completely at this point if you're buying a brand new heudini from a

[01:11:28] distributor at you know seven K you're an absolute fool right so that games can pull you the bomb

[01:11:33] dropped out this game I could see go in the same way personally because I just think there's so many

[01:11:38] people waiting for these major titles that are coming out and if their cost is 7500 I think Chris

[01:11:44] that's still about 100 before tax right yeah in the tax laws like change now like

[01:11:50] yeah it's not as cheap anymore well and also you know people are looking at who deenie like I'm

[01:11:59] gonna spend 7500 and people are probably like shit this game might only be worth like 6,000 in a year

[01:12:06] and do I do I need it that bad right if I eventually want one I could always pick one up later

[01:12:11] down the road all right Brian final final company I want to talk about because see I told you we

[01:12:16] get to an hour quick read an hour five it happens many people you know whenever they come on I'm

[01:12:21] like you see you'll see once you're on the Canadian train it it moves pretty fast spooky pinball I think

[01:12:27] these are really interesting here for them Alice Cooper nightmare castles finally shipping he's got

[01:12:32] the $1,000 non-refundable deposits which some people are trying to break out of unsuccessfully what are

[01:12:38] your thoughts on spooky in 2019 I want to go look the thousand dollar deposit thing I know you're

[01:12:43] mentioned I forgot was the last one maybe a couple ago about the practice of him doing this and

[01:12:50] listen if you're a consumer and the guys telling you you can give me a thousand dollars and I'm

[01:12:57] gonna try to get you a game by certain point it's up to the person to say wait a minute Charlie

[01:13:02] get the fuck out of here like are you gonna deliver this to me if you're not then you know there's

[01:13:05] gotta be a caveat so I can get out of it but there's no caveat and the consumer knows that so it's

[01:13:10] on the consumer to be smart enough not to get in that relationship with Charles I don't blame

[01:13:15] spooky at all if I'm a small company I am doing the same thing if people are gonna do it with me

[01:13:20] why not right so I blame I don't blame but I would say that's not you know Charlie's fault now

[01:13:25] as far as what's going on that game what in hell I mean you have guys like um what's his name uh

[01:13:33] ice which by the way that guy on that uh Fred is uh is trying to match for breast cancer I mean

[01:13:39] just a great stand-up move by him I really gave him a lot of respect for that so hopefully spooky

[01:13:43] you know ponies up and does it but he's trying to sell his a five hundred dollars which is half

[01:13:47] the thousand there's not a guy who's actually below him at three hundred or so I mean people

[01:13:51] are giving this game away I played it a couple times that game is just not for me it just doesn't

[01:13:57] shoot like I want to shoot um I think games can be complete a complete disaster um and if you want

[01:14:05] to get into it it's like just keep on hold on because this thing's just gonna go down I think yeah

[01:14:10] I don't think it's I don't think they're gonna end up making all five hundred I think what's

[01:14:13] gonna happen is this and because 18 months to to from start to finish of production for those of

[01:14:20] you out there is a year and a half and in a year and a half that's about five to six new

[01:14:29] stern titles a year and a half from now we should have like 18 deep rude titles to choose from

[01:14:34] right a year and a half from now we will have at least three new Jersey Jack titles over the next

[01:14:39] 18 months for sure here's what's gonna happen the the bottom is gonna fall out on Chuck and he's built

[01:14:46] his model around this you know limited like limited number of games uh you know I tell people 18

[01:14:54] months from start to finish but here's the thing if the game's not good and and the game's not great

[01:15:02] what is gonna happen six months from now right when people have this game people have played see

[01:15:07] it it'll be out at shows more and in comparison to the other games are out there and available

[01:15:12] I don't think it's gonna be heralded it as one of the better games of the year and then what

[01:15:16] happens when people start selling them for five hundred or thousand less than it is new right what

[01:15:23] do you do now for the guy who's got another nine month wait and he can go buy it tomorrow and save

[01:15:29] himself like fifteen hundred bucks right yeah and then you're gonna get like this just in the

[01:15:35] mutiny by the guys at the end of the line because it's it's like and it's not Chuck's fault it's not

[01:15:42] I mean to your point these people made this agreement but I think people ignorantly thought that

[01:15:50] well it's limited well it's five hundred and it's amazing and like so it's just like

[01:15:55] yeah if the game is like a classic and there's only five hundred and and it's and it is like an

[01:16:00] incredible game that would hold value but it's just I don't think it's gonna get there and I think

[01:16:07] spooky isn't is gonna be in a little bit of trouble I don't think they're making a ton of money

[01:16:11] I think TNA saved them like save the company TNA like he because if you remember when Rob Zombie

[01:16:18] production was done if he doesn't have TNA he had nothing to go on the line Alice Cooper was next

[01:16:27] and it was significantly delayed and so he that would have put the company most likely under I

[01:16:34] mean he did the smart thing and got a game on the line but without TNA that was the savior of

[01:16:40] spooky but I think the bottom is gonna fall out a little bit and I think they won't end up

[01:16:44] making all five hundred I think Chuck is at the stage now where he needs to hire some outside talent

[01:16:53] to make his games better because it's the same people the same formula it and again I think his

[01:17:02] ego making him design these games is the Achilles heel of the company and and like I say this on my

[01:17:08] show brana I have to walk by this guy it shows and everything but I'm a Chuck I'm telling you run

[01:17:13] your company become Gary Stern let the designers who are more talented take over the playfield layout

[01:17:21] because that game with all those posts everywhere that's not good design to brickfest yeah look I think

[01:17:28] that this business model they're doing a thousand down for deposit that that business model my opinion

[01:17:34] is over after this game because the good will that they built with TNA was the momentum for people to

[01:17:41] jump on board for this game and to give them that thousand dollars after this game comes out whatever

[01:17:45] happens to it you're not gonna have that good will anymore and I doubt people will do the same or

[01:17:50] have the same amount of interest in giving him that money upfront so I think his next game he's

[01:17:55] got a almost plan not to have that ability to bring your thousand each and we'll see what happens

[01:18:00] but look when you when you criticize or at least you provide feedback on these on these these owners

[01:18:05] like Jack and and folks are saying oh god canada you know he's he's so direct these guys listen if

[01:18:11] you have a company this happens to everybody you get critiques right you get you get you know we

[01:18:16] call constructive criticism right the political I guess the publicly correct way of saying it right but

[01:18:21] but it's that's how this business runs people like you can't just go around kissing ass all day

[01:18:26] you give him this feedback then I can take it personally that they're saying okay I understand that

[01:18:31] these guys want better you know better deliverable he wants a better deliverable right

[01:18:36] it just relax like I think it's good that that that you're airing out you know these direct

[01:18:41] distract feedback because listen this is where the world is I mean it's not going to get you in

[01:18:46] and Brian if I was saying stuff that didn't capture or articulate how a lot of people feel nobody

[01:18:53] will listen to this show exactly so which one is it it's like I'm like McDonald's you know two

[01:18:59] billion served or six billion serve but no one ever admits to eating there like cool like

[01:19:05] and I agree and if I and if I was just being negative for negative sake I also think no one would

[01:19:11] listen to the show I try to give an opinion about what or or or back up my opinions with something

[01:19:17] that has some thought in it and and I keep in open mind I keep an open mind I'm trying like I'm

[01:19:23] I hope to play a pirate soon that I fall in love with I do think because of the lack of some

[01:19:28] of the assets and and the story narrative that can't really happen because of that it might not be

[01:19:34] the game for me but that's fine I have my eyes set on Willie Wonka that is what I hope is the next

[01:19:41] game in my one game collection any final thoughts are you going to TPF Brian I'm not I very really

[01:19:49] good like the shows so I'm not I don't travel the shows but I'll definitely be checking you know

[01:19:56] the media and the feedback that comes out from it let me answer your question though yeah

[01:20:02] because I know you do keep an open mind alien alien pinball now look you know there's been a

[01:20:08] resurgence or least there's been just I'm fire the market with people selling aliens time to

[01:20:13] self you have one people cash out yeah well here's the thing though how many times you played alien

[01:20:19] three times broken every time okay because yes another game that struggles right pirates has some

[01:20:27] mechanical issues alien you know historically has had issues backing though if you can get

[01:20:32] when that works and I'm going to get one here pretty shortly or soon hopefully next two weeks

[01:20:38] would I say here like you you you bought one or or where I did I did so I I had a

[01:20:43] original alien that came off when it was first released in October my alien was there was

[01:20:48] couple issues but nothing major it worked fine for the next six seven months I ended up selling it

[01:20:51] because I want to get some new blood in here that game though is unbelievable as far as you want

[01:20:57] to like theme integration and just the modes everything feels different the sound the music by

[01:21:03] David's fantastic fair the coder unbelievable job that he did that thing is the total package and

[01:21:08] I had to just get it back because it's it's unbelievable I put a buck hearts I love alien though

[01:21:15] I'm a huge alien fan right I would I remember you dealt in the alien threads going bonkers so here's

[01:21:23] the thing though how do you get one I know the community has done a great job in coming up with

[01:21:28] replacement parts for the game I mean that that would be my besides my complete disdain for all the

[01:21:34] lies Andrew highway shoved down everyone's throat for years but how do you feel good about sorry

[01:21:42] did you pay like a huge premium to get it back so so once the parts because what I did was I did

[01:21:48] sell it I would have sold it anyway because I want to get some new machines and I I definitely

[01:21:52] I don't haunt the machines too too long until like I'm completely just done with them and I want to

[01:21:56] bring some new stuff in but I was worried about the fact of that machine where to go down where

[01:22:01] the parts blow block but now with and I've bought some extra parts myself there's you know some

[01:22:07] resources where you can buy additional boards you can buy additional LEDs you can buy additional

[01:22:13] you know so there's the parts of there to buy and that's what people are doing right now

[01:22:16] and even like the PC that that's inside that I could probably just build that PC from you know

[01:22:20] those specs that people have provided me so I'm actually much more confident now and that's why

[01:22:25] I jump back in because for me I probably could have two I'll boards go out and still be okay right so

[01:22:31] once that was back in play and there was parts available that game you really need to do yourself

[01:22:36] service and have if you have an opportunity and plays a you know one that works well

[01:22:41] it's a total package how many went out in total like 140 well they speculate right so you have

[01:22:47] the the LEDs you have the standard editions I think standard editions somewhere between 100 or 150

[01:22:53] maybe 100 or so and then I think the LEDs were like 30 so I guess in total yeah 150 I think I

[01:23:00] mean again I'm not 100 but we're talking super limited and just this thing the atmosphere just

[01:23:05] the immersion you want to talk about art and you want to talk about video I mean they did an

[01:23:11] amazing job bringing the clips in I know there's no Sigourney Weaver who cares like they have so many

[01:23:15] other things in there I personally love I know you said the aliens kind of like that's all it does

[01:23:21] but you know what it's it's it's it's it's it's fantastic think that's you know the thing drops out

[01:23:26] there's no lights and then it kicks off I mean just a great overall experience so

[01:23:30] do you think I was to blame for the for the demise of highway pinball or I mean come on that

[01:23:37] what do you think I mean I'm just curious as a fan of the game and and I know you are like

[01:23:42] heavily emotionally invested in the game well I didn't get really involved see I don't

[01:23:47] the whole politics and stuff like that like this obviously Andrew is whatever like

[01:23:52] like he was a mess a liar a fraud a a manipulator of people's you know like everything he was

[01:24:02] doing like the factory was like he would stage production it was a toxic I mean you're talking

[01:24:08] about pure toxic the toxicity so I totally understand I just a shame that the game is coming out

[01:24:14] from such a toxic situation but if this game didn't have that just absolute you know

[01:24:20] right drama I mean it really would have I think been a top contender people be talking a lot more

[01:24:26] about it but now I totally agree I mean there was so much of the hard work has been done in that

[01:24:30] game right so the the the the animations have been done the music is incredible the the coding has

[01:24:37] been done why doesn't a company like American pinball why you know why doesn't a company who's

[01:24:43] got manufacturing down right because if you think about the highway Achilles heel was Andrew

[01:24:47] highway does not know how to put a pinball manufacturing company together but the game is now like

[01:24:53] in a really like you know a lot of the stuff the heavy lifting has been done over the years

[01:24:57] yeah why not go to Fox renew the license of it maybe redo some of the artwork because we do

[01:25:04] we do know that they could have done more hand drawn artwork why not like why doesn't a company like

[01:25:09] AP or another company just buy the rights to the alien pinball game and rerelease it knowing that

[01:25:17] the game you know would have an audience and a huge audience if if people didn't feel so anxious

[01:25:22] about getting on and getting you know spare parts and and customer service around it yeah look I

[01:25:30] think it's good point I just don't know with uh I don't know I mean sometimes companies they want to

[01:25:36] you know have their own thing and you know inheriting a failed company might bring let's say the

[01:25:41] wrong attention to them and and and they'd be perceived as supporting you know uh highway and

[01:25:48] and all the I don't know I mean I think when you're a company taking on that absolute just

[01:25:52] because people lost money right Brian like there there are like a lot of people that just

[01:25:56] paid him and just never got anything right exactly yeah so you absorbed that I mean it's the same

[01:26:04] problem with like Lebowski is I would love to see someone make that game but what do you do

[01:26:10] for the like 150 people or 200 people who are out 8500 bucks right I mean how do you you can't

[01:26:18] just like start making the game again and then those people have to buy it again because they're

[01:26:21] not getting they're not going to get one uh well that's what I'm saying it brings in a lot of

[01:26:25] negative just noise to the company if you're going to bring it in like that so that's probably

[01:26:29] what's uh deterring them from picking up what's a clear I mean the code is done I mean there's two

[01:26:34] different modes between alien aliens there's different you know so so the thing is complete it's not

[01:26:38] like you feel like you're playing a broken game this thing is like prime and loaded okay so did

[01:26:43] you get an Ellie or a standard standard Ellie to me so did you just buy that one I saw that

[01:26:49] sold for like 14 something I didn't no no I didn't I uh there was some other like some folks that

[01:26:57] you know kind of behind the scenes kind of thinking about you know what they had and what I had

[01:27:01] for a trade so I did like a trade and I did what you trade can you do you want to reveal or is this

[01:27:06] is it no that's not secret I mean I I have a virtual pinball machine that I had that I um I mean

[01:27:11] but the nicest virtual pinball I don't know if you if you played virtual before one of the nicest

[01:27:15] ones and I I rebuilt the entire PC and put a 4k monitor so I I did the virtual and it's still with

[01:27:23] me right now we're just ironing out the the um shipping date but I did a virtual with cash and

[01:27:29] look it wasn't cheap but I know at the playing so many games that I missed that game you want to

[01:27:35] you just want it exactly yeah like when you can't stop thinking about something that you can

[01:27:40] acquire you won't stop into you acquire I mean especially when it comes to toys like pinball um

[01:27:45] well Brian look I wish you luck on the new alien that you're gonna get uh I look I've heard good

[01:27:50] things about the game it's never been so much about the game as it's been about what the game

[01:27:55] represents for me that it caused a lot of people a lot of pain and suffering and I think everyone's

[01:28:02] wise-dub I think we've all learned a lot of lessons with those companies and I think 2019 is going

[01:28:08] to be I think it's gonna be an amazing year for some and I think it's gonna be a reckoning year

[01:28:13] for other companies there's too many new games games coming out and there's not enough room or

[01:28:17] money to absorb all of them so to the victor will go to spoils right is that I don't even is that

[01:28:23] phrase even right to use there I don't even know uh what do you think gonna happen in 2019 I mean

[01:28:28] and then we'll close off the chart you think it what who do you think's gonna win listen jersey jack

[01:28:33] if jack doesn't win this year jack's not winning okay he's got the card set up so well that if he

[01:28:39] doesn't win this year it's like forget it it's just not in his in his uh destiny so I would say

[01:28:43] jersey jack's coming out looking sweet I think stern they come out Jurassic where like you were

[01:28:47] mentioning jaws to me is a must-have game so if it comes out this year next year if it's Brian

[01:28:54] Eddie who's amazing that to me is a is an instant Ellie for me instant it's not happening I know

[01:29:01] you ruined it I know you got the answer to the issue you only get the shark and you get the name you

[01:29:07] don't get anything else like I don't think you get the music you don't you just like I don't think

[01:29:10] it's happening how do you get the shark without the music though how does that even work great it's

[01:29:14] crazy I mean it's like this should be a package but anyway uh billburg man like I'm sure he's got that

[01:29:19] shit like so heavily locked down but whatever yeah well I still think stern's gonna do okay I think

[01:29:25] that spooky he's gonna have a challenging time the guys who are making that free birds game whatever

[01:29:31] that company's called to get down that time um I'm trying to get us deep root is gonna be put up

[01:29:36] or shut up at this point and I really hope you're right because I think they could definitely be the

[01:29:41] surprise hit but I just my gut feeling is what's going on there so um well so we got to

[01:29:48] it's gonna be fun you know it's fun about pinball you can just you can be like me and and and watch

[01:29:52] from the sidelines and that's why pin sides fun is you can just it's just fun to comment and speculate

[01:29:57] about all this stuff and no one's forcing any of us to buy any of this stuff right these aren't

[01:30:02] these aren't like like a replacement heart and we need it to live it's a fucking pinball machine I

[01:30:09] mean this is this is an unnecessary toy that brings us a lot of joy but I love sitting on the

[01:30:16] sidelines and watching all these guys ask for my you know five to fifteen thousand dollars and I'm

[01:30:20] just like yeah no yeah I do love watching I'm not really like I'm not a good pinball player I

[01:30:26] don't I don't do leagues like I I love playing pinball too because it's a hobby but I almost equally

[01:30:32] love watching the industry and what's going on and what people are doing like that to me is equally

[01:30:38] as fun like I just don't care about which is why I like your your podcast like I don't give a

[01:30:42] shit about scores I don't give a shit about tournaments oh my god I don't care did anyone watch if

[01:30:46] anyone watch the stern pro circuit that happened today it's still going on I think right now I I

[01:30:51] tuned in for like an hour yeah I mean so one round of the tournament one round is five hours long

[01:30:59] and there's like three or four rounds I mean who thinks this is a good idea and I tune in and it's

[01:31:06] Jeff deal is and Ed Robertson and someone and it's just like they need someone like me to be the

[01:31:13] commentator during these tournaments to make it exciting I'd be like that guy in the best in show

[01:31:17] movie where you need someone who's like a reverently sort of making you know making light of a lot of

[01:31:23] it because it's it's like it's like 18 hours long it's ridiculous you got to spice it up you got

[01:31:29] it you got to keep it light on its feet spice it up so yeah and I'm so like you can't I just don't

[01:31:34] understand like tournament players like I and you look in the background you can see everyone there

[01:31:37] just like they look like they're bored out of their mind waiting hours to see like the end of it

[01:31:45] it's like having all of imagine having like March man is all happening one day like oh run game

[01:31:51] numbers 64 like in one day like it's yeah it's unbearable but anyway yeah I don't think I don't

[01:31:59] know how anyone who was in the tournaments could could listen to my podcast and enjoy it because

[01:32:03] all I do is we're high gun tournaments but all right well Brian have a great night thank you

[01:32:09] for joining me on this Saturday night we'll get this show up soon and I'm gonna find a pirates

[01:32:14] and where are you by the way like what part of the country just so I know if I'm right I'm

[01:32:18] I'm a Pittsburgh all right so do you go to Pimberg then so I do go there because it's literally

[01:32:24] like 20 minutes away so I go to Pimberg in that place it's it's huge and that's a good show so

[01:32:30] I do go to that one but I don't really travel to any other ones but I do go to Pimberg all right

[01:32:34] so maybe from there I'm always at Allen Town but I hope to see you some point and and we'll get

[01:32:40] you back on the show I do like these opinions you don't hold back and I think you're you're a good

[01:32:44] member of the forum thank you for sticking up for canada I don't you know I need it I need any

[01:32:48] any allies I can get but hopefully for you pirates fans out there it's been fair and balanced I've

[01:32:54] led enough of your fanboys on the show this might be I mean Derek keeps wanting to come back on I'm

[01:32:59] like bro this is not a pirate not it's not Canadian pirates of the Caribbean Pimball podcast okay so I

[01:33:05] think we've reached the point of everyone go play a pirates that's set up right and make up your

[01:33:10] own damn mind don't just listen to me all right is that fair yeah no that's fair man I appreciate

[01:33:15] you have me on like I said I I call them like I see them you know we don't always agree on things but

[01:33:19] I appreciate your your opinions and straightforward nature too so take care man all right all right

[01:33:24] and I want to just add before I go to my close out music that Brian reached out to me after the

[01:33:29] show and said Chris I forgot to mention that the treasure chest was a toy in pirates of the

[01:33:35] Caribbean that is awesome so I'm mentioning that now he considers the treasure chest to be awesome

[01:33:42] and I'll say this closing thought our friend Derek who was on the show earlier went to play a new

[01:33:47] pirates on location and he read his report he said the entire game was was garbage because the

[01:33:53] treasure chest wasn't working these games are location nightmares they are best served in a home

[01:34:01] use environment and so I think if you have one and it's in a home use environment and it's dialed

[01:34:06] in properly I think you're gonna have a lot of fun I think they're an operators nightmare and that

[01:34:10] just I think that's gonna be the final story on this game and I think a few months from now we're

[01:34:15] all gonna be in Willy Wonka land and not even thinking about can we get better code to improve

[01:34:20] pirates wizard modes everyone have a great day we'll talk to you soon

[01:34:50] and
