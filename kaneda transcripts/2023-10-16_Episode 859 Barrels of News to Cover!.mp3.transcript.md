[00:00] Welcome everybody, happy Monday, Canada's back from California and oh my gosh, has there

[00:26] been a plethora of pinball news popping.

[00:28] I feel like the pinball dam has burst right before expo, we've got all of these news items

[00:34] I can't keep up with Naps Arcade on a daily basis and we're going to talk all about it

[00:39] on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:41] Look, there's only so many rumors and scoops I can give you but it's been really fun tag

[00:46] teaming with Jason and delivering all of this exciting stuff for each and every one of you

[00:50] because as I've always tried to do on this show, I think when you know more information

[00:55] you can make more educated decisions and oh my gosh, are we going to have to start making

[01:00] some decisions with all of these games coming out?

[01:03] Is Seth Davis going to ruin Stern Pinball with another version of Elvira?

[01:08] We're going to talk about that, Ellen Ripley version of Alien Pinball coming to Pinball

[01:12] Expo and of course Barrels of Fun and the freaking Labyrinth game, we've seen so much

[01:18] Labyrinth news, now the main question is, are you going to buy one and do you see enough

[01:24] if you fully load this game up?

[01:25] You're at a $12,000 Pinball machine, I don't know, is $12,000 a barrel of fun or is it

[01:32] getting really, really expensive to be a part of this hobby?

[01:36] We're going to talk about everything, I mean there's so much going on, we know that Spooky

[01:40] Pinball is going to come out, I think with dual themed games again, we're going to talk

[01:44] about what we think those are going to be and where should we start?

[01:47] Well let's start with the Raise the Roof Club real quick, these are people who raise their

[01:51] Canadian subscription so I want to say thank you to Darren W for raising the roof, I want

[01:56] to say thank you to 904 Pinball Zine, I think that's Cody over there, went all the way up

[02:02] to $30 a month and now he's a member of the Omokase Club and I want to thank each and

[02:07] every one of you for just being a member of Canadian Pinball Podcast, we went up to 631

[02:12] subscribers, I think we might have lost one along the way and let's get right to it.

[02:17] So let's start this episode with Labyrinth, I've given you some thoughts about this game

[02:21] on Facebook, let's talk all about this game by Barrels of Fun, see how bad it sounds when

[02:27] you say out loud the name of the company, it's just really bad they need the change

[02:31] and I wish I could stop harping on it but as a podcaster I have to say this damn name,

[02:35] I'm going to call them boff from now on, even that sounds terrible.

[02:39] Alright so this game is out and I will say this right now, this is not a dream theme

[02:44] for me but if you love this movie and I've heard from people who love this movie, Jim

[02:49] Henson's Labyrinth from 1986, David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, now she's not in this

[02:56] game at all, I'm not sure if you're playing as her in the game or it's more about just

[03:01] an unknown traveler that you are going through the Labyrinth.

[03:05] So let's tackle this Labyrinth release, first and foremost I thought the release went off

[03:09] very well, it was nice to see a company release a game, have a video out there that was nicely

[03:15] polished, a 2 minute trailer video, everything about the launch of this game went off pretty

[03:20] smoothly, I like the fact that they teased what the theme was going to be, we guessed

[03:25] it was going to be the Labyrinth, it was the Labyrinth and so you know they ripped the

[03:29] Band-Aid off a little bit early, we all know it's going to be Elton John from Jersey Jack

[03:33] Pinball and still they're keeping it a secret which might blow up in their face a little

[03:37] bit but we knew it was going to be the Labyrinth and then we got the teaser video on Friday

[03:42] and look it's only Monday and we're going to get a full gameplay video of this thing

[03:47] with Bo and Karen's release today from Wormhole Pinball in Texas, it's a secret pinball club

[03:53] in Texas and they brought the game there and they're going to show us the gameplay of the

[03:58] game, look this is what I like, you're going to get to see a lot of stuff on this game

[04:02] before you have to buy one and I always like this because remember these are $1000 non-refundable

[04:09] deposits so one question I always get is do you think the thing is going to sell out just

[04:13] on the launch alone and I don't, I don't think they're going to sell 1100 of these games

[04:19] on this launch alone and I think the reason why it's not going to sell out instantly is

[04:25] the theme itself, this is not an A-list theme, I would argue that this isn't even a B-list

[04:31] theme, I think the theme of Labyrinth is more of like a C-rated theme in my book, in my

[04:37] honest opinion and the reason why I'm saying that is all the years I've been on pinside,

[04:42] all the years I've talked to people about what kind of themes they want in pinball,

[04:46] I haven't seen many people say they've been clamoring for a Jim Henson's Labyrinth pinball

[04:52] machine, now that being said I think it is very impressive that a brand new company,

[04:58] brand new to the pinball world, they were able to come out of the gate with a licensed

[05:03] theme game, we don't normally see that because it's hard to secure a licensed IP when you

[05:09] don't have any pinball experience, you can't prove to these licensed holders that you know

[05:14] what you're doing and this is why David Van Ness working over at Spooky Pinball was such

[05:20] to his advantage because they were able to showcase, hey we know what we're doing, we've

[05:24] been part of this company, we've made these games before, we are simply branching out

[05:29] and starting a new pinball company with the worst name in the history of pinball companies

[05:34] but why would you want to be part of that company, but look change the name guys, change

[05:37] the name once again, really disappointed, and my friends over there Blake Dumasnil,

[05:41] I know you're listening to this, I know you're part of this company Blake, I was happy to

[05:45] see it, how can I have friends who are associated with this company know that I know how to do

[05:51] some marketing and naming and branding and they name it barrels of fun, I can't, I gotta stop,

[05:55] I gotta stop, they're gonna ruin my show, alright so they launched the game and look the response

[06:00] has been great, I think everyone's looking down at this game and saying hey there's a

[06:04] lot there, there's a lot there and I hear the phrase over and over again and I'm gonna

[06:09] give these guys credit, they created a world under glass, I see a lot of scopes, I see

[06:15] a lot of interactivity, I see characters popping up and down and the thing that I love that

[06:21] they did the most, they put the LCD screen in the right spot in the pinball machine,

[06:26] they put it in the back of the game underneath the glass, that creates such a more dynamic

[06:32] gameplay environment and I've been asking companies to do this all along, it's so weird

[06:37] to me that so many games just have static artwork there, when you could fill it with

[06:41] so much stuff and it's the perfect place to put it because it doesn't eat up any real

[06:46] estate where you want there to be physical mechanisms, I mean look at the usage of that

[06:51] LCD screen in Labyrinth and then look at where Jersey Jack put the damn LCD screen on Toy

[06:56] Story 4, they ate up half of the upper play field where they could have put an interesting

[07:01] toy or mechanism and they put a screen but not in Labyrinth and in Labyrinth they've

[07:05] got that goblin boat, I don't even know the names of all these characters, I gotta be

[07:09] honest, can I just be honest for a minute, I have not thought about the Labyrinth since

[07:13] 1986, I haven't watched the movie frequently, I don't know the character names, I don't

[07:20] know the goblin names, I'm not going to learn all of them, I'm just not gonna do it as a

[07:27] 47 year old man, I just don't wanna do it and I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna do

[07:32] it, so when I start pointing out stuff on this play field I'm gonna talk about it in

[07:36] more generic terms, I'm not gonna be like there's weaselboot pops out over here, I

[07:41] have no idea who these goblins are, okay so let's talk about the game itself real quickly,

[07:46] now look, we have to play the game, I wanna play the game, we're gonna get many chances

[07:49] to play this game from a design standpoint, I don't think there's anything truly unique

[07:54] about the design, it looks a little bit like a traditional 3 flipper game, where like half

[07:58] of the game looks more like a fan layout, then you've got the upper right flipper, creates

[08:02] some nice opportunities to shoot things from right to left and maybe there's a loop around

[08:07] or an orbit, I don't know, I haven't seen like full gameplay yet, we will get a better understanding,

[08:12] there are two scoops I believe in the game, there are two magnets, there's four multi

[08:16] balls, there's two ramps, there's wire forms, I feel like from a design standpoint there's

[08:21] nothing revolutionary in the design, but there's nothing right now not to like, it doesn't look

[08:27] like it's gonna be a frustrating game to shoot, you know and I think they learned the lesson

[08:31] from older spooky titles right, we're seeing a lot more targets and not posts, remember early

[08:37] spooky games they were brick fest, but this thing looks like it's not gonna be a brick fest, it looks

[08:42] like it's gonna have a lot of different pathways for the ball, one thing I noticed on that scoop in

[08:46] the lower left of the game, I don't see a scoop protector on the outside of the scoop, but I

[08:51] think it might have that metal scoop protector inside, here's the good news for everybody,

[08:56] guess who's making the playfields on these games, it is not Mirko Playfields, it's gonna be CPR

[09:02] playfields and they make tremendous quality playfields, so I think everybody's happy about that,

[09:08] now what do I think about this game aesthetically, well I think you're really gonna love this game

[09:13] aesthetically if you really like the color brown, there is a lot of brown in this game and that's

[09:19] derivative of the movie itself, the labyrinth has a very brownish look to it, the Muppet characters

[09:25] in the labyrinth have a very dark brownish color hue to them and so if you love the color brown,

[09:32] this is the game for you, you know and from an artistic standpoint like nothing about the artwork

[09:37] is blowing me away, well look we have so much good artwork now in Pinball that to stand out in the art

[09:42] department, I think you have to start getting really interesting and much more creative,

[09:47] I think these pinball companies need to start thinking about artwork a little bit differently

[09:51] and how they lay things out, it's like nothing's really popping from me, you know when you look

[09:55] at this game obviously the big David Bowie face on the translate is the thing that really jumps out

[10:01] at you, the characters on the cabinet, they're done well, you know they're arranged well,

[10:06] they're not the most beautiful Muppet looking characters, remember these are like goblins,

[10:11] it's not like it's Miss Piggy and Kermit, it's goblins all over this game and goblins are not

[10:16] supposed to be aesthetically pleasing and that is why when I look at the game it has a little bit

[10:21] of an ugly duckling kind of vibe going on because it's all these ugly goblins but again if you love

[10:27] the movie I'm sure this is exciting you on that front and so a lot of brown and then I'm looking

[10:32] at this interactive topper which is sold separately for $995 and look I was watching the interactivity

[10:40] of it and here's the thing it's like you've got these goblins up there their eyes light up and I

[10:44] think they move a little bit but their mouths do not open at least not in the video and so it's

[10:49] kind of weird to me that if the goblins are talking and the topper is interactive why wouldn't you

[10:55] make their mouths go up and down to sync up with their voices it's like you're trying to bring that

[11:00] Jim Henson puppeteer magic put it on top of the game and then you don't do the one thing that makes

[11:06] the puppet magic sing and that's their mouths opening with the dialogue and so really weird to

[11:12] me that that's not the case so you know maybe that would have been a $2,000 topper if they made it

[11:16] work like that do I love the topper on top of this game you know I'm gonna be honest it's

[11:22] I get it look I'd rather have this than flat plastic but again there's just something about

[11:27] goblins and sticking those big goblin head in the middle on top of your game I don't know again

[11:33] it's just not for me people it's just not for me so there we have it labyrinth pinball we're

[11:38] gonna hear so much about this game here's my prediction about this game I think this game

[11:42] is gonna do all right I think they will eventually most likely sell all of these machines as people

[11:48] in the pinball industry get sick and tired of stern being greedy and fleecing all of its customers

[11:55] I think this company is the number one threat right now to spooky pinball this company has a

[12:00] lot of ex spooky people and so if this company can make a thousand games in a calendar year

[12:07] they're gonna steal sales away from spooky pinball because now you have more options there's too many

[12:12] options in pinball right now there are just too many and we're seeing what stern is doing

[12:18] they're gonna keep coming they're gonna make new games and they're gonna bring back a lot of the

[12:21] older titles as well all at the same time and they're gonna oversaturate this pinball market if it

[12:27] is not oversaturated already but I do think these guys are a huge threat to spooky pinball there

[12:33] obviously a big big threat to American pinball American pinball's greatest threat is simply

[12:38] American pinball because they don't have a game on the line that people want and they don't seem to

[12:43] have anything coming anytime soon after this game they're in major trouble I think Mukesh might pull

[12:49] the plug on this thing any month now if sales don't pick up after expo but who's actually gonna go to

[12:54] expo play galactic tank force with all of these new games available and select galactic tank force

[13:01] the ship has sailed on the sales window for gtf now the prices are gonna keep going down and down

[13:06] and down and you're gonna be able to get an le for like eight or nine thousand dollars any day now

[13:11] all right let's move on to stern pinball rumors because there's a lot of stern pinball rumors and

[13:15] I almost need like two pinball podcasts to cover off on all of this so look let's talk about first

[13:20] stern's future titles so look this thing is broken like it's almost like we know stern's next like

[13:26] four to five titles let's talk about them real quickly we got jaws pinball from Keith Ellen

[13:31] I'm hearing there's gonna be a super limited edition of jaws pinball if I were to guess I think it

[13:36] will be twenty thousand dollars and I think stern pinball is gonna sell some directly and I think

[13:42] some distros are gonna do their call for price thing which I can't stand and I bet when you call

[13:47] them for price they're initially gonna start out at twenty five thousand dollars and then they're

[13:52] gonna pull it back to twenty thousand dollars just saying this stuff out loud is kind of making me

[13:57] sick inside I kind of want to buy Rolex watches now and not pinball machines so after jaws I am

[14:04] hearing we are going to get a metallica anniversary edition game now does this mean it's going to be

[14:12] in all new game with all new artwork I am hearing it is going to be a newly designed metallica game

[14:18] I am hearing it is going to have new artists I think they are shelving dirty Donnie's version

[14:23] of metallica now does this mean it's an all new game or new layout can you still use lineman

[14:30] sheets as code if you do a new design layout of the game I don't think that's ever been done before

[14:35] right keep the old code because it's amazing and just move stuff around a little bit to give people

[14:40] a new gameplay experience so more to come on metallica anniversary edition and then the new title

[14:46] which nobody was talking about until canada put it out there is dungeons and dragon pinball I am

[14:53] hearing dungeons and dragons is coming is that going to be a john bore game is it going to be

[14:59] based on the new movie that just came out is it going to be based on the old like comic books or

[15:04] cartoon series for dungeons and dragons I do not know yet but we do know that dungeons and dragons

[15:12] is coming out from stern pinball and then after that the big rumor is like supposedly they're

[15:17] going to be bringing out one of the biggest properties in the world in pokemon and pokemon is

[15:22] going to be a jack danger title wow if pokemon comes out from stern pinball as a jack danger title

[15:29] they are going to print money with that game and then we're supposed to get after pokemon

[15:34] john wick now look stern can always shuffle up the order of when they do things but that's a lot

[15:40] of new titles from stern pinball that we now know are coming out nothing is really a secret anymore

[15:47] in the world now that we got jason nap and canada reporting off on this stuff in real time like you

[15:53] can't keep up with both of us but even though we know all this stuff stern is still able to surprise

[15:59] us with this new version of alvira this alvira like red kiss edition version of the game so here's

[16:05] the thing it's going to be a fully black and white game just like they did with the monsters the only

[16:13] color in the game will be the red on her lips and I think it's going to have red armor like

[16:19] sparkly armor as well now here's my thing about this this is basically a new limited edition of

[16:26] alvira it is going to be 13 000 now you've got the third limited edition version of alvira mark my

[16:36] words when I say this seth is going to ruin stern pinball he is going to oversaturate the very people

[16:44] that kept stern pinball in business by remaking too many versions of games if you make all of these

[16:52] games not special by having so many different new variations of older titles that collectors were

[16:58] finally seeing some second hand value on if you destroy people's second hand value on their games

[17:05] guess what's going to happen you are going to destroy new and box sales these two things are

[17:11] interwoven you've got to allow certain things to remain limited you have to allow certain things

[17:18] to remain special if you keep going back to the well and rerunning stuff over and over and over

[17:25] again you are going to do nothing but collapse the second hand market because here's what happens

[17:30] when you start to collapse the second hand market then people can't easily sell their used games and

[17:36] if they can't easily sell their used games then they don't have the ability to get money to buy

[17:41] your new versions of the game and there's a reason seth why Jurassic park 30th anniversary

[17:47] has not sold out yet and now you've basically just destroyed the value on the old le's of Jurassic

[17:53] park and now the new ones are just sitting there and now you've kind of diluted what makes the

[17:58] limited version of Jurassic park special and makes collectors feel like they have something special

[18:03] and this is my fear because now that stern is in this new factory we're just going to see them do

[18:08] this over and over and over again you know i every batman owner now is worried they're going to do

[18:13] another run of batman now that it's the 60th anniversary of batman so why not do another run

[18:18] of that game and then do another run of ghostbusters and another run of tron and just keep on going

[18:24] and going and going until we all look down at our pinball collections and realize wow i just spent

[18:30] a hundred thousand dollars on six pinball machines and they've all lost a lot of value that is not

[18:35] the hobby we love that is not why we're in pinball so yes stern's going to be bringing these elvira

[18:41] additions to pinball expo i'm sure they're going to be beautiful but again i don't think they're

[18:47] going to sell out i think people have been burned one too many times with all these different variations

[18:53] and i also think now that you know back to the future is coming out from dutch pinball i think a

[18:58] lot of you are going to wait for that game i think you're going to wait for jaws i don't think you're

[19:03] going to throw your money instantly at all of these like new additions of old stern machines

[19:08] because the other thing is this right doesn't it already feel like stranger things coming back

[19:13] was like six months ago no they just released that like a couple weeks ago so now they're

[19:17] rerunning more elvira you know you just can't keep up with it and i think everything stern is doing

[19:22] right now feels like they planned all of this during the covid hype moment of pinball and that

[19:29] moment is over there's only so much money to go around and i'm just waiting for keith elwin's new

[19:35] game i'm waiting for back to the future there's another game coming out that nobody knows about

[19:40] i've been teasing it it is the sexiest game in the history of pinball it absolutely is and i'm

[19:46] going to order one and it is coming out and you don't know what i'm talking about but trust me

[19:50] you're gonna want one you know i've seen this word thrown around a lot like collectible i saw in

[19:55] the marketing materials for labyrinth or like a collectible new game and i'm telling you right now

[20:00] nothing is collectible until the collectors deem it to be so but trust me when i say this

[20:06] if you're a pinball collector you should hold on to some money for something coming out in q1

[20:12] of 2024 that's all i'm gonna say and don't run at all of these new stern variation games none of

[20:19] them are special none of them are really gonna hold value now because stern is gonna oversaturate

[20:24] the market all right so that's what's happening over at stern pinball there's a lot of games

[20:28] coming out i would just say wait for jaws all right let's talk about spooky pinball real quick

[20:33] they are gonna do their next game i believe is going to be another dual themed game which means

[20:39] one design but each game will be a radically different theme we saw it with halloween and

[20:45] ultra man obviously ultra man bombed and you can go get like a collector's edition of ultra man now

[20:50] for like 5800 bucks and i don't think they're gonna make the same mistake again but here's what

[20:56] i'm hearing i'm hearing that bug is designing texas chainsaw massacre which leaves the other

[21:02] game to ben heck now i think ben hex game is gonna be the game that we rumored a while ago i think

[21:08] it's gonna be looney tunes mr ben heck doing looney tunes as the alternate version to texas

[21:15] chainsaw massacre and you couldn't pick two themes at the complete opposite end of the spectrum so we

[21:21] shall see if this is going to be the case they are not going to reveal this game until maybe the

[21:27] end of the year probably sometime in february i would imagine but as soon as they're nearing the

[21:33] end of the scooby-doo run best believe we will see the next two games from spooky pinball i mean are

[21:38] you counting how many games i'm talking about and i haven't even finished yet now we've got a new

[21:43] version of alien ellen rippley is now in the game remember when andrew highway said he was not able

[21:50] to get her because she wasn't available oh look at this he was lying again so i'm happy to see them

[21:57] finally get the main character two alien into this machine it is going to be code 4.0 and the code will

[22:05] be offered to everybody who owns an alien machine for free so congratulations pinball brothers i love

[22:12] this move they are now going to offer an ellen rippley edition of the game that will have new

[22:18] cabinet artwork new translate new playfield artwork i think it's also going to have a special

[22:23] topper they come out with so like look i mean this is huge for this company to get new interest into

[22:29] the alien machine also the new game has new scopes i think leor might be working with them from art

[22:35] of pinball to do the scopes in the machine as well so yeah there's definitely enough in this new

[22:40] version of the game that's going to make older alien people be a little bit bummed out because

[22:46] who's not going to want to have ellen rippley edition on the artwork on the translate you know

[22:51] so that's a little unfortunate because if you love this game you're going to want to trade up so i

[22:56] think we're going to see a lot of older alien machines hit the auction block or be put up for sale

[23:02] as people who absolutely love this game are going to want the latest version of the game now here's

[23:07] the good news for everybody out there the ellen rippley edition of this game is not limited i did

[23:14] not like the way they communicated this they're like this game is limited but it's not limited by

[23:19] numbers it's limited by our ability to make them come on guys that's a cop out if something is limited

[23:26] it is limited to a number all right this is basically then like a glorified premium that

[23:32] you're going to make as many as you want for as long as you want and as long as orders keep coming

[23:37] in that's what you really meant to say we're going to build these things until we get no more orders

[23:42] and whatever that number is then we're going to say hey we limited it to whatever so that's also

[23:48] coming to pinball expo it is crazy how many titles are now out there in the pinball world i want to

[23:56] end this show by saying this there's so many games coming out i don't really care other than back to

[24:02] the future by dutch that's the one i'm waiting for that's the big one i've only got so much money to

[24:07] invest in pinball and look i'm going to say this right now if stern makes another version of batman

[24:13] i think i might just get out of all pinball collecting all together and i might just enjoy

[24:18] games on location and find friends houses to go over and play them because i think we're on the

[24:24] razor's edge right now i think there's so many games coming out and i think you need to find new

[24:30] ways pinball companies to make sure that people feel good about spending this much money on a game

[24:37] i mean labyrinth fully optioned out is 12 000 these aren't cheap games you know 13 000 for elvira

[24:47] and all they're going to do is change the artwork on the game i think everyone's waking up from the

[24:52] covet fomo and we're seeing these things like now we're spending five thousand dollars more on an

[24:58] elvira simply because they change the artwork there's only so much blood you can get from a stone

[25:04] and stern pinball has the power to either make this thing fun again or they're going to collapse

[25:10] the entire pinball marketplace and right now the way i'm looking at it i feel like they're going to

[25:14] collapse it they're just going to destroy their distributor's ability to like buy all these games

[25:19] look at all these games out there how are all these distros going to be absorbing all of these

[25:24] titles and what happens when titles don't sell so anyway it's going to get really interesting i

[25:28] don't know what your thoughts are on all of this i don't know what your pinball plans are but trust

[25:33] me when i say it there is no better time to wait and see let all these games come out let all these

[25:39] distributors buy all of this product because in the end what that means is you're going to be able

[25:43] to negotiate a better price than msrp if all of these distros are sitting on this stuff and they're

[25:50] going to be sitting on this stuff all right so this is podcast number one it's going to be a busy week

[25:56] as pinball expo drops i can't wait to see people jump on these games at expo and we didn't even talk
