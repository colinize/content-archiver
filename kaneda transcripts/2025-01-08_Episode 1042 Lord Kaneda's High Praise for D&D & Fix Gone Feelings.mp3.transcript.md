[00:00] I saw the sun, and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sun, no one's gonna drag you up to get into the light for you below.

[00:10] But where do you belong?

[00:12] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up!

[00:16] Aw, welcome everybody to the world's maybe third or fourth favorite pinball podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Kaneda.

[00:23] We're gonna talk about Dungeons and Dragons.

[00:26] The people have played it, the consumers have played it, the media have played it, even Neil McCrae flew over from the UK and played it yesterday.

[00:38] And I've been watching gameplay videos, I've been hearing the feedback.

[00:43] And the overwhelming consensus is this.

[00:48] Stern has made a really good game.

[00:52] And that makes me really happy.

[00:55] We're gonna talk about whether or not that will translate into sales.

[00:59] Nobody really knows Neil McCrae bought one before he even played the game.

[01:04] But we don't have Neil McCrae kind of money, you know what I'm saying?

[01:07] Like the dude can go to Stern in Chicago like you and I go to a pizzeria around the block.

[01:15] That's how much money this guy has.

[01:17] But anyway, we're gonna talk about this game and what we've seen so far in the game.

[01:22] David Fix is out at American Pinball.

[01:26] I'm gonna give you a few thoughts on that.

[01:29] And then we're gonna talk about where we go now.

[01:32] Where does everything go right now, right?

[01:34] We've got this new game from Stern.

[01:36] We've got Harry Potter around the corner.

[01:39] We've got King Kong next.

[01:41] I actually talked to David Van S over at Barrels of Fun today.

[01:45] Lots of stuff about to happen in pinball in 2025.

[01:49] I just want to start out by saying this.

[01:51] Before I get into D&D and the gameplay footage and Dwight and Brian talking to the media about this game,

[02:01] I just want to say, can the pinball marketing people?

[02:06] Can they actually wake up and do a media day the right way?

[02:12] Do you know that for 10 years in my professional career,

[02:17] I worked in the video game industry launching video game products.

[02:23] My clients were Atari, Majesco, THQ.

[02:28] It was a lot of fun.

[02:30] We did a lot of fun stuff.

[02:31] I've been to many, many E3s and CESs and things of that nature.

[02:38] Now, here's the thing.

[02:39] Your Stern pinball and you're inviting these pinball media into Stern pinball

[02:46] to play the game for the first time.

[02:47] And that's great.

[02:48] But here's what they're doing wrong.

[02:50] And I mean this.

[02:51] And it's so stupid.

[02:52] I'm watching the footage and I'm asking people who are there about the game.

[02:56] And here's what they did.

[02:57] They did a walkthrough of the game with Dwight and Brian Eddy.

[03:01] And thank you, Neil McCray, for taking video of that because I watched your video.

[03:05] And it was like being in the room.

[03:07] I loved hearing Dwight explain the game.

[03:10] Even if at times I'm like, this doesn't sound like pinball.

[03:13] I don't know if this is going to be any fun.

[03:15] But I appreciate what he's explaining because now I know the game better.

[03:19] And there's going to be a lot in this game.

[03:22] We're going to talk about that.

[03:23] But you have them walk through the game.

[03:25] I don't know how many they had there.

[03:27] It looked like three D&Ds in LE, a premium and a pro.

[03:32] And then you've got maybe what, like 20 people there from the pinball media.

[03:36] And then you turn each game on at the same time.

[03:41] And so you're absolutely destroying a pinball media's opportunity to experience

[03:48] all of your hard work the way it should be experienced.

[03:52] I was asking people like, how is the music?

[03:54] How are the callouts?

[03:56] And you know what they were telling me?

[03:57] I don't know.

[03:58] It's really hard to hear with everything happening at once.

[04:01] Not only do you have all of the sound coming from three games competing with each other.

[04:06] You've also got everybody talking in the room.

[04:09] And that is the dumbest way imaginable to introduce these pinball content creators

[04:15] to your product.

[04:17] And when we use the launch video games, guys, just wake up, be more professional.

[04:22] It's not even hard.

[04:23] You should have one game in a room by itself.

[04:27] You should have media schedule times in which they come by to see the game.

[04:33] I would say that each media person should get an hour on the game.

[04:38] That is what you should do.

[04:40] And you do that over a day.

[04:41] Like each person gets an hour on the game.

[04:44] And that's the best way to do it.

[04:46] Because seeing people's footage, it was like just throwing them into the madness of like a CES like

[04:53] experience.

[04:54] I just want the pinball marketing to finally use common sense one day and just give these people

[05:00] a chance to experience and hear all of the callouts, right?

[05:05] To hear the music to sort of get immersed in the game in the right way.

[05:10] All right.

[05:10] So that being said, the overwhelming feedback on the game is really positive.

[05:15] I've talked to people who were there.

[05:17] I've watched the footage and people are very, very complimentary of the depth of the game,

[05:25] of how they integrated the theme into this game, the major dragon mechanism in this game,

[05:31] the gelatinous cube with its magnet that can trap the ball both above and below.

[05:37] You know, you can decide whether or not you want to do like a two ball multi-ball,

[05:41] a three ball or a four ball all through the cube.

[05:45] And then you've got all these different ways to play the game and listening to Dwight talk about it.

[05:51] You know, it's hard.

[05:51] And I don't think any of us have ever quite played a game like this,

[05:56] a sort of choose your own adventure where there's like all these different ways to go.

[06:02] And depending on which way you go, there's like 20 modes and six wizard modes within each of those

[06:09] directions. And then within that, if you get to the end and you battle the boss and you win,

[06:16] you then unlock a new character that you can play as.

[06:20] But if you lose, you got to start over.

[06:23] And all throughout your journey, you can save your character and start where you left off.

[06:31] This is probably the greatest combining ever of a video game experience and a pinball experience

[06:40] that we've ever seen.

[06:42] Now I give Stern credit for doing this, for making an innovative and a new approach and

[06:49] a creative approach to a pinball experience.

[06:52] And I think they nailed what D&D is all about with what pinball is all about.

[06:59] And with toys and mechs that look really fun.

[07:02] And with a layout that looks like a lot of fun to shoot.

[07:05] So I think there's just a lot to really, really like about this game.

[07:09] When I was listening to Dwight explain the game, I kept thinking to myself,

[07:13] wow, this is like a lot of game.

[07:16] If you buy this game, it feels like you're getting two or three games in one with how

[07:23] much they're going to put into the software of this game.

[07:27] The one thing I was wondering about is if you can save your progress and you get through it all,

[07:33] then you battle all the monsters and you defeat the game in all the different ways you can defeat

[07:38] the game.

[07:39] Will that one day make you feel the way you feel like you do with a video game,

[07:45] where after you've completed it, you don't really want to play it again.

[07:50] And because you can save your progress unlike other pinball machines,

[07:54] where you are always starting over every time you start a new game,

[07:59] is that going to make D&D a game where you'll own it for six months and love it and then beat it

[08:06] and then not want it?

[08:08] Or will the constant randomizing of the dungeons make it new enough for you every single week

[08:15] or month or year to own this game for a very long time?

[08:19] And I don't think anybody knows the answer to that, but I think coming out of, and I mean this,

[08:25] coming out of a X-Men game where the code was a big issue for people,

[08:31] coming out of a John Wick game in which the mechanisms were lazy and lacked creativity,

[08:39] this game is landing with a lot of enthusiasm, with a lot of praise, and it feels like a really

[08:48] amazing effort from Stern Pinball.

[08:51] And as someone who does a pinball podcast on a weekly basis, where I ask for a world under

[08:58] glass, where I ask for mechanical magic, where I ask for replay value, where I ask for moments of

[09:06] wow, music and callouts that excite us, right now this game is checking a lot of boxes.

[09:13] Now look, it still does not check for me and maybe for many of you, a theme I really want to own.

[09:20] And that's why the theme door is such an important door to get right, because if they don't get you

[09:25] through the theme door, you don't care about anything else, like you're just not going to go

[09:31] in on it.

[09:31] But seeing more of this game, it does feel like a little bit of an Iron Maiden might happen,

[09:39] where even if you don't love D&D, you don't hate it, right?

[09:43] Like nobody hates D&D.

[09:45] I actually would argue it's easier for me to get into D&D, especially D&D pinball,

[09:52] than it is to get into Iron Maiden pinball, because I don't like Iron Maiden music.

[09:57] You know, I actually would say I dislike it.

[10:00] I don't dislike D&D.

[10:01] You know what I do like?

[10:03] I like knights.

[10:04] I like wizards.

[10:05] I like shields.

[10:07] I like dragons.

[10:08] I like all the medieval stuff that D&D has in its world.

[10:13] So it's easy for me to sort of, all right, even though I'm not the biggest D&D fanatic,

[10:18] I could see why I could get into this game.

[10:21] The same way if I asked each and every one of you, why do you love medieval madness, right?

[10:25] That's not based on anything other than medieval madness.

[10:28] It's an original IP, but you like knights.

[10:31] You like castles.

[10:32] You like draw bridges.

[10:33] You like dragons.

[10:35] You like catapults, right?

[10:36] So it put all of that into a pinball game, and you really enjoy it.

[10:41] So I'm here to tell you right now, I think this game has got a lot going for it.

[10:46] I still do think though, we don't know how owning this

[10:51] game and how rewarding and fun it will be to sort of journey through the head of Dwight Sullivan,

[10:59] his storyline and the way this game unfolds.

[11:03] He's got a lot of passion.

[11:05] You know, listening to Dwight talk about this game, you can't help but feel like,

[11:10] I want to feel what that guy feels, and I hope this game delivers that.

[11:14] Now, all that being said, right?

[11:16] All that being said, will this game take off?

[11:21] Will people buy this game?

[11:23] Knowing what we know about the current pinball market, I still think it's going to be tough.

[11:27] I really do think it's going to be tough.

[11:29] I really wish the LE was a lot more exciting.

[11:34] I still look at that LE package, and there's nothing about it that makes me really want the LE.

[11:41] And this is my mental sort of mindset, how I think a lot of people are considering D&D.

[11:49] Because it's not a dream theme, you don't really need the LE.

[11:53] Okay, that's cool.

[11:54] Like right off the bat, you're saving yourself $3,000.

[11:58] Okay, but then you're like, well, wait a minute.

[12:00] If I really want to get one, maybe I could wait a few months and get an LE,

[12:05] because those are going to sink down in price for the price of a premium.

[12:09] But again, like, you know, I don't know, maybe you don't want to wait six months.

[12:12] Maybe you don't know how the market's going to shake out on this thing.

[12:16] But I think here's my recommendation.

[12:18] I think the way to go on this game is the premium.

[12:22] I get that the pro gives you a lot, but I think losing all of the movement of the dragon

[12:29] is a huge, huge loss in this game.

[12:32] So I would argue that the premium is the way to go,

[12:37] but I also wouldn't want to buy a premium new in box for $9,700.

[12:43] I feel like they're going to be around $8,000 in just a few months after this game is shipping.

[12:51] And I think that's probably, I think, the smart thing to pick up,

[12:55] because the pros are not going to go down that much in value.

[12:57] With the pro, you lose the dungeon entrance, and you lose the fully animated dragon.

[13:04] I would want those things in my D&D experience.

[13:08] So I think that's where we're at right now.

[13:10] Stern, do a better job of giving the content creators a much more personal experience with the game.

[13:17] Don't throw everybody in the same room at the same time.

[13:22] It's time to wake up now and market these games to your content creators of your industry

[13:29] with more professionalism.

[13:31] There's some free advice, Stern people.

[13:33] And I don't think we've seen a game like this that's really going to test

[13:39] the modern Stern pricing quite like D&D, right?

[13:44] It was a lot easier to write off Venom.

[13:47] It was a lot easier for you guys to write off John Wick.

[13:50] You know, a lot of people were fans of James Bond.

[13:52] They bought it.

[13:53] A lot of people were fans of Foo Fighters.

[13:55] They bought it.

[13:56] A lot of people were fans of Jaws.

[13:58] They bought it.

[13:59] But I think everyone's sort of inching towards D&D a little bit more each day.

[14:05] I think the game has definitely piqued the curiosity of a lot of people.

[14:10] And now the next thing is this, because again, if you don't care about getting an LE,

[14:14] I would still just wait, right?

[14:16] There's no reason.

[14:17] They're not going to sell out of these LEs ever.

[14:20] So I would just wait because now it's going to get fun because the LE buyers are going to get their games first.

[14:27] And then you're going to get to see more like deeper dives happening in this game.

[14:32] And just follow what the early buyers and adopters are experiencing vicariously.

[14:39] Like just live vicariously through the people that are going to drop $13,000 on the LE.

[14:45] That's going to be worth 10 in just a few months.

[14:48] And if you really dig in what you see and you see pinball moments of magic and wow that you really want to get,

[14:55] then absolutely jump in on one in a few months.

[14:58] And you'll be able to get it for a great price.

[15:01] And that's what I'm curious to see what happens next.

[15:04] How is the market going to respond to this game?

[15:06] What do you guys think?

[15:08] Email me at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[15:12] And I will read out some of your answers on the next show,

[15:16] how you think D&D will do in the current pinball marketplace.

[15:21] But on a pure pinball level, I think this is one of Stern's best offerings in a long time.

[15:29] And I think if you don't see that, I don't know where you've been.

[15:33] Because you must be living in that dragon's cave because this is a really phenomenal effort from the folks over at Stern Pinball.

[15:43] And I know deep down we all hope we see similar efforts in the games moving forward.

[15:50] Now look, Seth Davis was interviewed at CES.

[15:54] And he once again is sort of teasing and indicating that a price increase is coming.

[16:01] That is the worst thing Stern Pinball could do right now.

[16:04] Because what I don't think Seth understands is I think they're finally getting closer

[16:10] to where they need to be to justify these prices.

[16:13] And if you now raise prices again, I really do think, Seth,

[16:18] you're going to start to create an army of people that are just rooting against Stern Pinball.

[16:25] They can't raise prices again.

[16:28] It's not going to work in their favor at all.

[16:31] I don't care if it's Kong, if it's Elwyn, it's just too much.

[16:36] Because remember, if they raise prices and then they come out with a $2,000 topper,

[16:42] you're now going to get a Stern that's closer to $16,000 to have everything in the game.

[16:49] And speaking of accessories, we've seen the accessory shooter rod for D&D.

[16:55] And yes, it is exactly the same 20-sided die that is on Stranger Things.

[17:01] It is just in a different color.

[17:02] It is the color white.

[17:04] All right, so there's D&D media day at Stern.

[17:08] You know who didn't have a media day yesterday?

[17:11] American Pinball.

[17:13] The day we knew was going to come.

[17:16] David Fix is out.

[17:18] Was he fired?

[17:19] Did he resign?

[17:21] The official statement is he resigned.

[17:24] They did not renew his contract.

[17:26] All I'm going to say on this, and this one stings me on a personal level.

[17:31] I can't tell you all the details.

[17:34] One word, karma, karma.

[17:38] I'll say it again, karma.

[17:40] I'm not shocked by this at all.

[17:42] It sounds like AP will contractually get Cuphead out into the world.

[17:49] But other than that, it seems like after they get Cuphead released,

[17:53] they want to turn their gaming division into a contract manufacturing gaming division,

[18:00] not a division that releases its own pinball machines.

[18:04] So this could be it.

[18:06] And if it is it from new titles from American Pinball,

[18:10] with everything else happening in the pinball world,

[18:13] I don't think people will care.

[18:16] I'm just happy that people are finally being held accountable for terrible decisions.

[18:22] And if you only knew the other stuff that happened behind the scene,

[18:27] everyone kind of got what was coming to them because of karma.

[18:31] All right, that's all I'm going to say.

[18:33] All right.

[18:33] And now we're into mid-January, Evil Dead.

[18:36] We got some gameplay feedback from Kari Hardy.

[18:40] Couldn't really tell if he loved the game or not.

[18:42] I think he enjoyed the way the game shot.

[18:44] He's not a fan of the theme.

[18:47] And he applaud Spooky for making its best game to date.

[18:51] I feel like that's how 99% of us are going to feel.

[18:55] It's a beautiful game.

[18:57] It's not based on a theme we love, but it's Spooky's best to date.

[19:01] I'm just waiting for the day where we can remove the,

[19:06] it's not a theme I love from a Spooky offering

[19:10] and then say it has everything we want.

[19:12] It's beautiful.

[19:13] It's got a lot of fun toys in it.

[19:15] It's a theme I love.

[19:17] And it's a game that's never leaving my game room.

[19:19] You know, I talked to David Van Es today for a little bit.

[19:21] Really great guy, by the way, really great guy.

[19:25] And I was explaining to David,

[19:26] I think all these pinball companies now are sort of in this weird place

[19:31] where communities are starting to form around each company

[19:34] where you either have people rooting for you to succeed

[19:38] or people rooting for you to fail.

[19:41] And I think right now, Stern Pinball has got a 50-50 split.

[19:44] I think half of the people are rooting for Stern to succeed.

[19:48] I think the other half are rooting for them to have failures

[19:51] because they want to stick it to Stern for the high prices.

[19:54] And then I told David, I think companies like American Pinball,

[19:58] everybody's been rooting for them to fail

[20:01] because they did not like the decision making

[20:03] or the leadership over there.

[20:04] Everyone was rooting for Deeproot to fail.

[20:07] I think when it comes to barrels and spooky and Turner Pinball,

[20:12] you've got good vibes.

[20:13] Everybody's rooting for you to succeed.

[20:15] Now, when I asked him how many labyrinths are you going to make,

[20:18] he said they're probably somewhere a little north of 900.

[20:23] And then he thinks they will move on to their next game.

[20:26] Now, that doesn't mean they won't make a few more

[20:30] because he said, when we release game number two,

[20:33] there's going to be people who are going to discover us

[20:36] and maybe want game one and they can always go back and make another.

[20:41] Let's say if they stop at 950,

[20:44] they can go back and make another 150 units to get to 1100.

[20:49] That's fine, right?

[20:50] They're not making more than they ever said they're going to make.

[20:53] And I was asking David, I was like,

[20:54] yeah, man, am I going to be more excited about the next theme?

[20:59] Then I was labyrinth and he said yes, so that gets me excited.

[21:04] And I told him, David, you've got a really interesting company

[21:08] and my advice to you is allow us to see your company more often.

[21:13] Hear from you and your people more often.

[21:16] And I said, like, spooky's doing it really right.

[21:19] And he said to me, there's no bad blood between David Van Es

[21:22] and spooky pinball.

[21:24] I think that narrative has been out there.

[21:26] Maybe I've been putting that out there a little bit,

[21:29] but they actually do have a really good relationship,

[21:32] those two companies.

[21:34] And I think that's what we all want to see.

[21:36] I would much rather be at one of these boutique companies

[21:41] because I think you have more freedom to make stuff

[21:44] where you don't need to sell like 5000 units.

[21:47] I really do.

[21:48] I feel like these boutique companies have such an opportunity

[21:50] and I know that David is going to bring the market a mixture

[21:55] of stuff that's got some mainstream appeal,

[21:58] but then maybe some niche stuff that is what he loves.

[22:02] And guess what?

[22:04] It's his company.

[22:05] He gets to decide what he does,

[22:08] but I think he wants to make the right decisions

[22:10] to keep the company healthy and make some money

[22:13] because you need to.

[22:14] You need to keep the lights on.

[22:15] So in terms of when we might see the next game from Barrels,

[22:18] it's definitely going to be this year.

[22:21] It's going to be after every single labyrinth order has been fulfilled

[22:25] and when the next game is ready to be shown.

[22:29] If I had to guess, I would say April of this year.

[22:35] That's my guess is April because if you are David

[22:40] and you do want to reveal your next game,

[22:42] you also have to be aware of what Harry Potter

[22:46] and King Kong are going to do.

[22:48] And yeah, you're going to have to launch games,

[22:51] not just when you're ready,

[22:54] not just when your last game is done,

[22:56] but also when does it make marketing sense

[23:00] to bring your game to market

[23:01] because consumers can't absorb too many games

[23:05] on top of each other.

[23:07] So lots to come in Pinball, everybody.

[23:09] Happy Wednesday.

[23:10] We will be back with more episodes of

[23:12] Canada's Pinball podcast, D&D, a great game, Stern.

[23:17] You got to show it to media in a better way.

[23:20] And the leadership at American Pinball is gone.

[23:23] Not surprised, everybody.

[23:24] We all saw the sign on that company

[23:26] when they released Barbecue Challenge, Canada Out.

[23:42] Open up my eyes, that's all the sign.
