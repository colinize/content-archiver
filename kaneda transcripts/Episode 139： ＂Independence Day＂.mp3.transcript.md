[00:00] I am a real American, fight for the rights of every man.

[00:10] I am a real American, fight for what's right, fight for your lies.

[00:18] It's the 4th of July and I'm breaking my own promise to take a vacation for two weeks.

[00:32] I'm in between vacations right now.

[00:34] I came back from Canada today.

[00:37] The fireworks were just going off in New York City, Brendan and I could see them clearly

[00:41] from the rooftop.

[00:42] But I decided to get a little podcast up in between my next trip to Vegas, which is happening

[00:49] in just a few days.

[00:51] So don't ever say, Canada doesn't love you and Canada doesn't give you the news.

[00:55] We do.

[00:56] We cannot take too long of a break.

[00:58] And a lot's been going on in Pimble.

[01:00] First I want to start out by saying welcome back to Mr. Nate Shivers.

[01:05] Coast to Coast Pimble is back.

[01:07] I saw a new episode that was put up.

[01:10] Nate has moved into a new apartment.

[01:13] He's got a second bedroom, which is now going to become the new Coast to Coast studio.

[01:17] So I am really happy that Nate is back and podcasting because I love Nate's take on the

[01:23] Pimble hobby.

[01:24] So I highly recommend you guys check out Coast to Coast Pimble.

[01:27] If you're a fan of the show, I know you'll be excited that Nate is back and recording.

[01:31] Alright, so let's jump right into what we do here and that is cover the Pimble News.

[01:37] And a lot's been going on.

[01:38] A lot's been going on and I want to start off with Dutch Pimble.

[01:43] I wanted to discuss the recent sort of communication from Dutch Pimble to the Big Lebowski owners.

[01:50] And just to recap, they are not going to work out stuff with ARA.

[01:55] We saw on their live sort of webinar that Dutch's plans are to find a new contract

[02:00] manufacturer, get a quote from them, and to go from there.

[02:05] So here is what Dutch Pimble has communicated as the update.

[02:09] I'm going to read it word for word.

[02:12] They say, here is another update of the production of the Big Lebowski Pimble.

[02:18] You know that we were waiting for the quotation from our new contract manufacturer and we

[02:23] have good news.

[02:25] We received the quotation and came to an agreement.

[02:29] Exclamation point.

[02:30] We can't reveal the details from our new contract manufacturer yet, but it is a Dutch company

[02:37] that has a lot of experience with building electro-mechanical devices.

[02:42] Their factory has about 100 workers and they work international.

[02:48] They and our, alright, I'm reading it word for word.

[02:52] There's a grammatical mistake here.

[02:53] They wrote, they and our, I think it should be, they are super enthusiast about the TBL

[03:00] project and now we'll start working on the production planning and the financial planning.

[03:06] Alright, that's really important part here is that they're working on the financial

[03:09] planning for this deal.

[03:11] We are super excited about our new partner and had few white Russians to celebrate it.

[03:17] We advise you do the same.

[03:19] We will send out another update next week, kind regards, Barry and YAH.

[03:22] Alright, I read that word for word.

[03:25] There are clearly grammatical mistakes in this.

[03:28] I know English is not the first language, but you think they would have somebody proofread

[03:34] this before sending these out to the community.

[03:37] So in short, they got the quote and they have come to an agreement with this new contract

[03:44] manufacturer and that is good news and they want people to drink white Russians to celebrate.

[03:51] And what are my thoughts on that?

[03:53] My initial thoughts when I read this were, enough of the talk, enough of people being

[03:59] asked to celebrate news that is just talk.

[04:05] Like there are no big Lebowski's in production.

[04:08] This is not a moment where I would go drink a white Russian or feel like celebrating with

[04:13] Dutch pinball.

[04:15] It's just an email.

[04:16] It's just an email and it's just words.

[04:18] It's just words at this point.

[04:20] The big questions that are still on my mind are the following.

[04:26] Okay, so this new manufacturer gave you a price.

[04:30] Does this manufacturer know what it takes to really, really, truly build pinball machines?

[04:36] They have never built pinball machines before.

[04:39] And as we know with ARA, it's just not about having a pedigree with electro-mechanical devices.

[04:48] The knowledge and experience needed to actually make pinball machines is quite different than

[04:54] any other product out there.

[04:56] And anyone who says otherwise, I think, is fooling themselves because every time people try

[05:03] to go produce and manufacture pinball machines, they run into problems.

[05:09] They run into delays.

[05:11] Things cost more than they initially thought.

[05:15] And I still will always go back to George Gomez.

[05:18] And he said, no one will ever survive in pinball using contract manufacturers to make their

[05:23] products.

[05:24] And so here we are with a new contract manufacturer.

[05:28] Now, okay, so this new manufacturer has given them a quote and they agree to the price.

[05:34] So are we supposed to be super excited about that?

[05:38] So here's the thing.

[05:40] Where's the money LeBoussky?

[05:42] So they have to now financially figure out how to activate and get this new contract manufacturer

[05:50] up to speed.

[05:52] Where is that money going to come from?

[05:54] Where?

[05:55] We know that they don't have money to refund people.

[05:58] So where are they going to get the money to then ramp up and pay this new contract manufacturer

[06:05] the money they need to get going?

[06:07] Because remember, only a fool would buy a big leBoussky at this point.

[06:13] So it's not like these guys can go sell more LeBoussks to get the capital required to get

[06:20] this new contract manufacturer going.

[06:23] So where is that money going to materialize?

[06:26] How?

[06:27] How are they going to do it?

[06:28] So that's another really, really big question.

[06:30] I think that is the biggest question is it's always been about the money.

[06:34] Okay.

[06:35] The other questions are, well then what happens to ARE and the games ARE built?

[06:42] What happens to those games?

[06:43] Where do they go?

[06:44] Do they get auctioned off?

[06:46] Can ARE eventually sell them?

[06:48] Is ARE going to watch Dutch Pimbal walk and go work with a new contract manufacturer

[06:53] without maybe suing Dutch?

[06:56] So you know, is this, this doesn't feel like it's just going to be this simple moving

[07:02] production from one facility to another and then it's all going to be peaches and roses

[07:08] and everyone's going to be getting their big leBoussks.

[07:12] So I don't know and I really don't, I don't know about you guys but when I read stuff

[07:19] like go enjoy a white Russian, this is great news.

[07:24] It just rubs me the wrong way because I think these guys don't get it.

[07:28] They just really don't get it.

[07:30] I think they're completely tone deaf to their customer base, to the reality of where

[07:37] their organization is and the public opinion about Dutch Pimbal right now.

[07:42] This is not, I don't think there's any reason to celebrate until games are actually being

[07:48] manufactured again because the road to get there.

[07:51] Okay.

[07:52] How long is it going to take for these guys to get this new contract manufacturer ramped

[07:57] up to actually start making games?

[08:00] How long?

[08:01] Six months?

[08:02] Eight months?

[08:03] A year?

[08:04] How long did it take them to get, um, ARA, ready to go?

[08:08] Get assembly ready to go.

[08:10] We all know that manufacturing Pimbal machines is really hard and the hardest part is setting

[08:17] up the assembly line, is setting up the manufacturing of the game.

[08:22] I know they've done it before.

[08:24] Does that mean it'll be much faster this time around?

[08:27] They want us to believe that to be true, but I don't believe it will be that quick.

[08:34] And then it just begs the question, how long are you all willing to wait?

[08:39] Most of you who are in on the game, there's nothing you can do about it.

[08:42] You're just stuck in this situation.

[08:45] This thing is going to drag on.

[08:47] It's going to drag on every Friday you're expecting some news, some update.

[08:52] And I just don't buy it.

[08:53] I just don't buy this news as being anything more than words.

[08:57] And when they try to convince us that, hey, these guys, they're great.

[09:01] They've got a hundred people and they're a Dutch company.

[09:05] Honestly, being a Dutch company holds no weight, gives people no confidence.

[09:12] I would rather them be like, Stern's going to make the game or Spooky's going to make

[09:16] it for us.

[09:17] Or an American Pimbal company that knows what the fuck they're doing.

[09:21] But all we've seen is that Dutch and Dutch companies and Dutch companies trying to work

[09:27] with each other has done nothing but fuck over the consumers of the Big Lebowski.

[09:33] So yeah, I'm not excited that it's a Dutch company that manufactures international products,

[09:39] whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.

[09:42] So bearing out, I know you listen to the show.

[09:44] You still won't come on as guests.

[09:45] I think you should.

[09:47] But here's the thing.

[09:48] You got to get games in boxes.

[09:52] And weekly updates are going to run real thin unless you actually can get the manufacturing

[10:00] going.

[10:01] I still think it's going to be a long road for people.

[10:03] And I still don't know where they're going to get the money.

[10:05] All right.

[10:06] This thing is going to keep dragging on.

[10:08] But we'll see how it turns out.

[10:09] Every Friday, we're going to get a new bit of news to sort of react to.

[10:13] All right.

[10:14] I'm going to jump around because I've show notes that I want to go through.

[10:19] But I do want to jump from Dutch pinball to highway pinball because it has to do with

[10:25] a similar thing.

[10:26] And that's with refunds.

[10:29] And I've been sort of in and out of the highway threads over the last couple weeks.

[10:33] And there's really not that much developing.

[10:36] The investors haven't really come forward and communicate it much more to people.

[10:43] They're ramping up for production.

[10:45] I feel like that term ramping up for production is the most overused and I don't know,

[10:54] sort of disingenuous term in the whole pinball world because every time you say you're ramping

[11:00] up for production, it's like code word for nothing's really going on.

[11:04] But we're just going to say stuff is going on to buy us time.

[11:07] That's what ramping up for production means in the world of pinball.

[11:10] Now, sorry guys.

[11:11] There's sirens and horn honking.

[11:14] It's the 4th of July.

[11:16] I live on 36th Street and the fireworks were happening just down the street.

[11:20] So there's a lot of activity in this area.

[11:22] So I apologize for the background noise.

[11:24] Okay.

[11:25] So I'm still shocked that it is July 4th and nobody has received their refund from highway

[11:34] pinball yet.

[11:36] And we've heard that they were doing something with the bank accounts and sort of taking ownership

[11:44] of the company and that would take a little while.

[11:47] But I think they're stalling now and I don't think they are going to issue refunds as

[11:54] quickly as they said they would.

[11:56] I think their plan is this.

[11:58] I think they want to get games out.

[12:00] I think they want to get games shipping before anyone gets a refund.

[12:04] I think they want to try and convince people to stay in without there being a run on

[12:10] the bank.

[12:11] Now, I can't fault them for that approach but I also think it's not fair.

[12:16] I think people who want their money back should get their money back from these investors.

[12:22] And I've been saying it the moment Andrew highway stepped down and this company collapsed

[12:29] that when these new investors said they were serious about turning highway pinball around

[12:35] and they were going to put new capital into the company.

[12:38] I've said it since that day.

[12:41] Make them fix this company with their money, not yours, get a refund and buy the games

[12:47] when they ship.

[12:49] And you shouldn't have a problem.

[12:51] You shouldn't have a problem because remember, Alan pinball is really not this rare thing

[12:56] that you need to have a fear of missing out on.

[12:59] If these guys get production going, you really can add almost every single element of the

[13:04] game that made it in Ellie to your standard.

[13:08] I've said it.

[13:09] I think the standard has so much in it that there really isn't much of a difference between

[13:13] the two.

[13:15] The alien Ellie artwork was never approved by Fox.

[13:19] That beautiful artwork that Brian Allen did.

[13:21] I don't know where that stands because Andrew lied to us about that being approved.

[13:26] That's something that a lot of people don't want to admit but it's true.

[13:29] He didn't have permission to mail that out to people.

[13:32] So our friend in Florida who has that artwork, it's not really approved artwork.

[13:39] If I were these guys, I would get Brian Allen to redo the whole art package on the entire

[13:43] game and keep it cohesive and make it as awesome as it could be.

[13:49] I think Andrew was lying about a lot of those things with Ellie approval and not being

[13:53] able to do more stuff.

[13:55] But whatever.

[13:56] I'm not going to pass.

[13:57] I'm talking about today.

[13:59] Get people their money back.

[14:01] So they're trying to, they're going to try and stall.

[14:04] They're going to stall and they're going to try and get games out.

[14:07] And they want to be able to say the games are shipping.

[14:10] Just hang with us.

[14:11] Like support us.

[14:12] Like don't, don't, don't ask for a refund because look, games are going out.

[14:16] We're already hearing Melissa from CoinTaker tell people games are going out like next week.

[14:22] Games are shipping on Monday.

[14:24] They will arrive on a Monday.

[14:27] But here's, here's my concern.

[14:29] I just don't want history to repeat itself.

[14:33] And here's what I'm concerned is going to happen.

[14:36] They are going to obviously be able to screw more games together.

[14:39] Now whether or not that means mass production or real production is going on over in Wales

[14:47] or they're just going to try and get like five games out here, 10 games out next week.

[14:55] Slowly trickle games out so they can say games are shipping.

[14:59] Keep your money with us.

[15:01] Games are shipping.

[15:02] Place new orders.

[15:03] I'm just a little worried that history will repeat itself with this because they're not

[15:09] giving refunds because they're not doing what they said they were going to do.

[15:14] I want to read something because I think this is important because people have, people

[15:19] have pointed to this individual at highway Pimball.

[15:23] Their name is Morgan.

[15:26] And Jeff's Pimball Palace, he wrote that he received an email from Morgan stating that

[15:31] they're working to return my outstanding refund requests.

[15:35] Their records confirm return of my second payment and acknowledge my $1,500 deposit.

[15:42] This news was promising as it won was initiated by highway Pimball 2 was addressed to me.

[15:49] Why is that?

[15:52] Really we're like impressed because a company emailed you back and addressed you personally.

[15:58] See how low we've got in this Pimball world where we're impressed at a company actually

[16:03] wrote the email to me personally.

[16:05] Okay.

[16:06] I was on to say number three, accurately reflected my account status, for acknowledge my refund

[16:13] request, five indicated intent is to honor refunds and soon six indicates HB has a

[16:20] graft on their financials and seven indicates concrete steps are taking place.

[16:27] Are we starting to see results from their new plan?

[16:29] We'll be following developments closely but I feel better about highway Pimball today

[16:33] because of their improved communication.

[16:35] Alright, let me break this down for you guys, real simple.

[16:39] Because I just feel like this community has been so abused.

[16:44] You guys really have Stockholm syndrome.

[16:46] You've been so beaten up by these boutique manufacturers that you are at such a low state

[16:53] of existence that you are impressed that a company responded to your email, knew your name,

[17:03] had accurate information about how much money you gave them.

[17:08] Those are things that are now being heralded as great communication.

[17:14] Hello, McFly, is anyone home out there in the Pimball world?

[17:20] Why are we impressed?

[17:21] This is what a company should do.

[17:23] A company should know they took your money.

[17:26] A company should know how much they took.

[17:28] A company should know your name, especially Pimball boutique companies.

[17:33] Every customer counts.

[17:34] Right?

[17:35] And now this is a great sign.

[17:38] This is the whole new company.

[17:39] Bullshit, this is just how it's supposed to be.

[17:43] We are now praising companies for just doing the bare minimum.

[17:48] The bare minimum indicates that everything is great.

[17:52] But what was great is, Pinside user Russo121 from the UK responded to that and basically

[17:58] said, Morgan Potter lied to me.

[18:02] Just if I gave them a deposit that my game would be ready by the end of May, try it is best

[18:08] to garner a new order by lying.

[18:11] This was just before the new owner announcement too.

[18:14] Don't listen to a word from that guy.

[18:16] He's just another yes man in my honest opinion.

[18:20] You see what we have here?

[18:23] It's like, this is why it's so hard reading Pinside and trying to really get an accurate

[18:29] link on what's going on in the Pimball world because a guy from highway talks and people

[18:36] say he's great.

[18:38] Communication is awesome.

[18:39] Then another one, Chimesin says, the guy lied to me.

[18:43] If you lied to me, why would you believe what he said to you?

[18:47] That's sort of the state of boutique Pimball with Dutch and highway.

[18:50] Same story, different guys, different countries.

[18:54] But I just don't believe anything either of them says.

[18:58] I don't believe their words.

[18:59] I don't take anything they type in an email at face value.

[19:04] The only thing that we should expect to see from both companies are products and boxes.

[19:12] Until these companies get people refunds, I still consider them both to be failures in

[19:17] my book because I consider them both to be, they're holding people's money hostage.

[19:24] They're holding people's money hostage and they're forcing people to play the role

[19:29] of investor and not consumer.

[19:31] I think it's terrible.

[19:33] I think they both need to start getting people their money back.

[19:37] We've heard so much talk.

[19:39] Just refund.

[19:40] When I asked for a refund on my Star Wars Pimball machine, you know what happened?

[19:45] I had it back immediately.

[19:48] JJ from GameXJ said, here's your money back.

[19:50] Boom, I got an email within 30 seconds.

[19:53] 30 seconds.

[19:55] Just weeks and weeks and months and months and months.

[20:00] We all know they're all stalling and they're lying.

[20:05] Don't be suckers.

[20:07] Don't think it's all going to be different this time around because it may not be very

[20:11] careful with your money and get your money back if you can.

[20:15] Let's move on to some other stuff that's been going on in Pimball.

[20:18] Kevin Coolick.

[20:20] The world is Skippy.

[20:21] The never ending soap opera that is Skippy Pimball.

[20:27] Did you see what happened?

[20:28] This is just incredible.

[20:30] We talked a little bit about Kevin's house being flooded.

[20:33] There was the lake overflowed and there was a foot of water that moved in to the neighborhood

[20:41] and in Kevin's house and the RV and the nucleus, the operation center of Skippy Pimball, which

[20:50] is aka Kevin's house was flooded.

[20:54] There was a news story, a local news story where they interviewed Kevin's wife about the

[21:02] flood and how devastated they were and then they also asked people to help out to give them

[21:13] money.

[21:14] I think it's a man to Coolick, I want to say.

[21:18] They became these victims of this natural disaster and they started, I think it was a

[21:25] go fund me or something or they were asking people for money and some sympathy and support.

[21:30] On the Facebook page, what happened?

[21:33] The mob that has been ripped off by Skippy Pimball infiltrated this story and reminded people

[21:41] that these people are not victims.

[21:43] These people have screwed people out of a lot of money and these people don't deserve support

[21:48] or any sympathy at all.

[21:54] What's my take on this?

[21:55] This one is getting really nasty and I understand why.

[22:02] Kevin is not going to get off the hook and every time Kevin talks, every time his mom talks,

[22:08] every time his wife talks, they're painting themselves as victims and their liars and

[22:15] they don't deserve forgiveness right now.

[22:18] The reason why they don't deserve forgiveness is because they've never accurately apologized.

[22:24] If Kevin just said, look, I'm sorry, I fucked up, I took your money, I tried to build a

[22:31] Pimball machine, I didn't really have the license, I thought I did, I was an idiot.

[22:36] The money is gone.

[22:41] My family and myself will forever be disgraced by this.

[22:45] It is destroyed.

[22:47] My ability to stay within a hobby that I love so much.

[22:53] To my dying day, I will try and get people their money back, whatever.

[22:57] Just apologize.

[22:58] Apologize and admit that he was wrong.

[23:02] It would be one thing.

[23:04] Instead of doing that, you've got his mom on there calling Pinside an adult site.

[23:12] You've got his family basically saying that they're the victims and that everyone else

[23:18] should feel sorry for them.

[23:21] I saw this woman on there who's friends with the Facoolic family, basically blasting

[23:28] people because they don't understand how difficult this family is having and how they've

[23:35] lost everything.

[23:36] Just because you didn't get your toy doesn't give you permission to come in here and say

[23:41] these nasty things.

[23:43] I'm sorry, but it's not about a toy here.

[23:47] They stole people's money.

[23:49] They stole people's money.

[23:50] If you steal people's money and then you want to become the focus of a news story where

[23:57] you're asking for people's money to help you out, those people you stole from are not

[24:02] going to forgive and forget and just move on.

[24:05] I do think there's going to reach a point where there's just never going to be closure

[24:11] for people unless Kevin maybe goes to jail, unless the judge finally rules and whatever

[24:20] the ruling is, we just have to accept and move on with life.

[24:24] People are not going to get their money though.

[24:26] I think everyone knows that the outcome now is more about making Kevin's life miserable

[24:31] and getting as much transferring as much of the pain and suffering he caused onto his

[24:39] family.

[24:41] People are going to keep beating him and keep focusing on justice being served, but there

[24:48] will never be justice in this case.

[24:51] There will never be a lesson learned.

[24:53] This guy was always an idiot.

[24:56] This guy always, the fact that people believe that this skull cap wearing pirate building

[25:04] predator in his mom's kitchen was legit.

[25:08] The fact that you guys believe that, that he secured the license to an Arnold Schwarzenegger

[25:14] movie, not just that, but the likeness to Arnold and then was able to hand draw artwork

[25:19] with Arnold.

[25:20] When we all were fully aware, when Kevin showed that game, we all were fully aware how difficult

[25:28] it was to a secure a big license like that, be able to hand draw the artwork and yet seemingly

[25:36] he was able to do it all.

[25:38] Super simple.

[25:40] It was also easy.

[25:41] It was all going to just be great.

[25:43] You're all going to get your predators for $4,500.

[25:46] There's a little bit of a blame to go around on all sides of this thing, but I think the

[25:52] time is coming soon where we just have to just be like, you know what?

[25:56] Money's gone.

[25:57] The guy is an asshole.

[25:58] I hope the judge throws the book at him, but that's it.

[26:01] There's nothing more to be gained here by the constant going after the dude.

[26:07] What else?

[26:08] I loved it when people were trying to say that the family, people were saying this on

[26:12] the inside that the family didn't evacuate because they would have known that there were

[26:18] flood warnings coming and they didn't evacuate because they wanted to purposely stay there

[26:25] to be in the flood zone, to then have a media story where they could be the focus of it

[26:32] to then get money from people.

[26:35] Are they really that smart to try and pull off that level of a scam?

[26:41] I don't know, but that's just how crazy this whole soap opera has become.

[26:47] So I think we all should just let the judge and keep do their thing and that's it.

[26:55] Don't put your name up there with all these slander remarks on social media because

[27:00] you never know what he might be able to counter sue down the road.

[27:05] You just never know.

[27:06] Is it worth it to have your name up there saying a bunch of nasty stuff that he could use

[27:12] against you one day?

[27:13] All right, let's talk about another thing that's going on in the Pimble World and that's

[27:17] dialed in.

[27:19] Dialed in are shipping.

[27:21] That's a good thing.

[27:23] We set on the last podcast that we're seeing a bunch of unboxings of dialed in and people

[27:28] are opening their games and they're going out pretty quickly.

[27:31] So that's good.

[27:33] That's not so good is there are some where issues that we are noticing on the early dialed

[27:40] in that are getting into home use environments.

[27:43] So we're seeing a lot of plastics that are wearing.

[27:46] Balls are getting stuck in different locations.

[27:48] That's the ball is getting stuck happens.

[27:50] But probably the most worrisome are play fields that are chipping.

[27:55] And I think we've seen too so far.

[27:58] And the chippings seem to happen in different areas.

[28:01] But normally the chipping occurs near a post maybe or near a scoop or near a hole.

[28:09] And so it's hard.

[28:12] It's hard because I just don't know if chipping is just something that happens in like a small

[28:22] percentage of every game.

[28:24] So chipping might occur in 5% of Pimble games.

[28:28] But that's no consolation when you spend $9,000, $8,000 on a product and you are a collector

[28:38] and you want to keep your product looking as pristine and mint as possible.

[28:43] When we see people say I've only played the game 20 times and it's chipped what happens.

[28:49] It creates a panic.

[28:50] It creates a panic.

[28:51] It creates insecurity for owners who are just getting the games that they want to make

[28:57] sure that their game is as bold a proof as possible before they start flipping.

[29:03] Because once you're play field chips you're kind of a little bit screwed.

[29:07] I mean you sometimes can put a decal over it.

[29:11] But that's never really a solution for collectors.

[29:12] We know these OCD guys.

[29:14] They're not going to want to have a decal.

[29:16] You could send it out for repair and have it repain in that area.

[29:21] But then you have to get it like reclear coated.

[29:24] That's not an easy solution.

[29:26] You know Jack's not going to be sending out a fully populated play field if one area

[29:31] chipped.

[29:33] It's one of these things where we keep hearing a variety of things.

[29:37] George Gomez, when we talked to him, he talked about how the newer play fields that people

[29:42] want that look like glass that have really shiny clear coat, those are really dimple.

[29:49] Will these new clear coats also chip easier?

[29:53] That's something that I don't know.

[29:55] And part of me is just like sometimes it's just geometry of the ball and where there are

[30:00] weak points in the clear coat and how the ball hits it.

[30:04] You can have a ball just hit something with the right velocity at the right moment at the

[30:09] right point and that'll make it chip.

[30:12] It doesn't matter if it's 20 plays or 200 plays or 2000 plays, you might never hit that

[30:18] point in the play field that would cause it to chip.

[30:21] I've had brand new games that have had play fields chip.

[30:26] I'm saying that because my magic girl, like a little area by the ring magnet, you know,

[30:31] like you could see like it started to like wear on the engine and this is like again like

[30:35] 20, 30 plays.

[30:37] So the solution for most of us out there is just to have cliffies installed wherever there

[30:42] are vulnerable areas.

[30:44] And I still don't understand why cliffie is not male to play field for all these new expensive

[30:50] games.

[30:51] If I was stern, if I was Jersey Jack, if I was spooky, if I was Mike from Home Pin, I would

[30:56] make sure cliffie got a white wood, just given the white wood before anything else and

[31:00] let him make cliffy protectors for every part of the game that's vulnerable.

[31:04] And I think that would tremendously help.

[31:07] When Ghostbusters came out, it made people feel so much better when the scoop had a cliffy

[31:13] on it or what looked like a cliffy.

[31:14] I don't think cliffy supplied stern those pieces.

[31:18] It's just peace of mind and peace of mind is what everyone wants.

[31:21] You know, we don't mind it if after a thousand plays, we see somewhere.

[31:26] But if after 20, that's when people start to panic and that's when people start to worry.

[31:32] In terms of plastics wearing, that's another thing is you can replace plastics.

[31:38] If the ones JJP are using aren't up to snuff, here's what I think will happen.

[31:42] I think Jersey Jack will listen to the feedback and I think they'll make changes to the dialed

[31:47] ends moving forward.

[31:49] Anyone who gets a pinball machine first, when you get it early, you're going to be a little

[31:53] bit of the guinea pig for that game.

[31:57] So as exciting as it is to be one of the first people on the block to have the machine,

[32:02] they might make some changes to improve upon some of the weaknesses that your game showed

[32:08] them.

[32:09] I think that is why the collector's edition is not coming out right away.

[32:15] Jack, I think wisely saw what happened to Stern with Ghostbusters Ellie and is going

[32:22] to avoid that at all costs and is going to make sure the super expensive one is going

[32:27] to roll out after they've caught as much of the issues as they can before making those

[32:34] collectors additions.

[32:36] But that's again, no consolation.

[32:38] Everyone who buys a dialed end, whether it's an 8000 or 1 or 12500 R1, everyone who buys

[32:43] one wants the game to remain as perfect as possible for as long as possible.

[32:49] This isn't like the collector's edition people deserve to have, the fixes everyone deserves

[32:54] to have the game in a state that protects it as well as possible.

[33:00] I guess what's also probably worrisome for Jack and company is they've had this game on

[33:05] location in a variety of areas for many months.

[33:09] I think it just goes to show, you could put 10 pinball machines out in the wild, but it

[33:14] might be game number 11 that you ship to customer number one, that the ball just hits in a

[33:20] weird way that you never happen in the field and chips the play field and then what do

[33:25] you do?

[33:27] It's impossible to make these things bulletproof.

[33:30] It's impossible to make a pinball machine that doesn't wear.

[33:35] It just is.

[33:36] I think the more we spend on them, the more people expect them to remain perfect for as long

[33:42] as possible.

[33:43] I think that's the other part of this hobby is you got to ask yourself, can I emotionally

[33:51] deal with the fact that my expensive toy is going to get marks, going to get dimples,

[33:58] might get a chip, and can I put that out of my head and just enjoy the game?

[34:02] I know there are some people out there that I know personally who wouldn't care.

[34:07] They would just play the game, they'd have fun, it is what it is, they would take whatever

[34:10] fixed Jack would give them.

[34:12] I know other people out there and they know who they are.

[34:14] I'm not even going to mention them by name, who would go so OCD crazy, they would be calling

[34:20] Jersey Jack demanding a new play field, screaming, kicking and crying about that chip and they

[34:26] wouldn't even be able to turn the pinball machine on and enjoy it.

[34:30] They wouldn't want to play the game anymore because they'd be worried about further

[34:33] wear in that area.

[34:35] Look, we'll see what happens.

[34:38] The good news is this, everyone seems to be loving dialed in.

[34:43] There are some issues with Samsung phones connecting to the Bluetooth app and people not being

[34:49] able to play with it, but for the most part, I don't think I've seen a game launch.

[34:57] Tell me if you think another game is launched where the majority of people overwhelmingly

[35:04] are glowing with reviews that are nothing but positive and nothing but supportive of

[35:11] this game.

[35:12] I can't remember a stern release that had such universal applause.

[35:20] If we go down the list, I think Ghostbusters was like, you know, some people liked it, a

[35:24] lot of people thought it was really frustrating.

[35:27] Batman, the game is still an incomplete game.

[35:33] Erasmith, I think people really liked, but I think people, you know, I think that has

[35:38] probably been starting to best machine recently for sure.

[35:42] And now we're up to Star Wars where we don't even know what the game plays like.

[35:45] So I think dialed in has been received far better than the hobbit ever was, far better

[35:51] than was ever was.

[35:53] And I think the reason why is not just because it's a pat-law or game, I think because it's

[35:57] a standard body Jersey Jack game.

[36:00] I don't think a wide body machine will ever shoot as well as a standard body ever, ever,

[36:05] ever, ever, ever.

[36:07] I just would never build wide body pinball machines.

[36:10] I think they play half as good as standard bodies.

[36:14] And I think that's why people also are really loving the fact that dialed in has jam packed

[36:18] with stuff.

[36:19] And the standard, such a good decision by Jersey Jack to go that route.

[36:23] Alright, what else is going on?

[36:25] So there's still no Star Wars.

[36:26] I'm not even going to waste air time trying to figure this one out.

[36:31] But the good news is, is that Star Wars Pro will be at fantastic up there in New England

[36:39] this weekend.

[36:40] So we will finally, finally see what Star Wars Pro plays like unless there's no filming

[36:48] of the game allowed bullshit.

[36:50] But I doubt that will occur.

[36:53] I think that people are finally going to get on the game and give their feedback of it.

[37:00] I am disappointed that it's just a pro.

[37:03] I don't understand why we can't see the hyper drive.

[37:07] Why we can't see this the full premium Ellie in action.

[37:12] I believe it has to do with the contract that Disney made Stern sign about how the game

[37:18] would be revealed for the first time.

[37:21] So that's why you're seeing Facebook videos probably go up live, you know, Facebook

[37:25] live and take it down, you know, because that's not technically like Stern distributing

[37:30] content on the game.

[37:32] So Jody's trying to at least let you see some stuff, but it's kind of crazy.

[37:36] I don't think I've ever seen a launch like this where there's so much hype and then

[37:41] there's no gameplay forever and ever and ever.

[37:44] I mean, not even Jack Danger's played the damn thing.

[37:47] It's like that's that goes against the the normal method of showing a pinball machine.

[37:53] So more to come on Star Wars, I'll say this, I don't regret getting a refund on my

[37:59] Ellie or Ellie's at all.

[38:02] I don't I there hasn't even been like a day where I've been like, you know, maybe I

[38:06] should have stayed in maybe I should have seen the gameplay.

[38:09] I just I just think the game's okay.

[38:12] I think it looks okay.

[38:14] I think it's going to shoot great.

[38:16] I probably look at probably will shoot great.

[38:18] I just can't get over a tie fighter on a spring.

[38:23] I can't get over that.

[38:24] I just something something so lazy about that decision that just put a tie fighter on a

[38:31] spring and to just drop an LCD screen onto the play field like that.

[38:38] I think all games that use LCD screens as these sort of just like floating TVs to look

[38:46] at to me are it's just lazy.

[38:48] I just think it's lazy.

[38:49] So it just wasn't the game I was looking for this.

[38:52] You know, imagine me like waving my hand over, you know, JJ's face me like this

[38:58] isn't the game.

[38:59] Canada was looking for please give him a refund.

[39:03] I am I happily will spend at $4,000 elsewhere that I had down on that game.

[39:08] All right.

[39:10] Speaking of fantastic this weekend.

[39:12] Gabe has hired promo girls.

[39:15] I was laughing when I saw that thread.

[39:17] These two girls, Kimmy and Kristen.

[39:20] Little I got to be honest.

[39:22] Get a little creepy here guys.

[39:23] I don't know if we need to like if promo girls are really what we need walking around.

[39:28] I mean, what what is a promo girl really is just kind of like are they like just sort

[39:32] of like escorts that are just there to look sexy and that's somehow what we need at

[39:38] pinball shows.

[39:40] Not quite sure I buy that.

[39:42] I there's been enough drama and conversation about how women are objectified in the pinball

[39:48] world.

[39:49] And I understand the argument for it.

[39:52] And I like booth baves, whatever.

[39:54] You I go to auto shows and there's booth baves everywhere.

[39:57] So but I don't know if I would promote them by name and then have them quoted about how

[40:04] excited they are to meet us.

[40:06] Like see what I read that I was like that's kind of weird like that's kind of creepy.

[40:10] Like is she like I don't know any girl that would be really excited about meeting a bunch

[40:16] of sweaty dudes at a pinball show.

[40:19] I don't I think the guys would be excited.

[40:23] But I don't think the girls would be.

[40:25] So I think that's kind of kind of weird.

[40:28] But for those of you in the Northeast, you should go to the show.

[40:30] It's going to be a great one.

[40:31] You get to play Star Wars.

[40:32] That's really all you need to know.

[40:34] All right.

[40:35] Let's keep going.

[40:36] Military pinball attack from Mars remakes are shipping and people are getting them.

[40:41] All right.

[40:42] Crazy July.

[40:43] All these games on the market.

[40:44] All these games competing for your money.

[40:47] What have we noticed?

[40:49] Whenever a remake happens, one thing will it's just it's just bound to happen.

[40:54] It's a obligatory thing, which is people of the original game will always find something

[41:00] wrong with the new one.

[41:02] And it'll become this tug of war between which one is better.

[41:07] The new one with modern features, with a bigger screen, with enhancements, or the original.

[41:15] The one we got from Valley Williams.

[41:18] The one that made us fall in love with the game in the first place.

[41:21] The one that was built during the golden era of pinball.

[41:25] And people love to point out the differences.

[41:29] And look.

[41:31] Canate is opinion on this.

[41:32] Yes, I'm speaking in the third person.

[41:34] Is that newer is better.

[41:37] Newer is better.

[41:40] The LCD, the display on the new attack from Mars is incredible.

[41:45] It blows the old one away.

[41:46] OK.

[41:47] So you got that.

[41:48] Sounds better.

[41:50] The Ellie topper is incredible.

[41:52] So it looks better.

[41:54] The green trim looks great too.

[41:56] Now look, not everything is better though.

[41:59] And the one thing that people keep pointing out as not being better is the lighting.

[42:05] And there seems to be a lot of debate around the strobe multi-ball lighting in the game.

[42:12] And for those of you who are not familiar with attack from Mars, there is a multi-ball

[42:18] where just the strobe lights are going off.

[42:19] It's kind of cool.

[42:20] None of the other lights on the play field are going except for the strobe lights.

[42:24] Now it seems that the strobe lighting effect in the new game is not as

[42:29] bright as the old game.

[42:31] And so then this becomes like, huh, I thought they made this new game better.

[42:37] And I thought they improved everything.

[42:38] So why are we taking a step back in the lighting department?

[42:43] And I had to read through all the posts and everyone yelling at each other.

[42:46] So here's a description I found.

[42:49] Attack from Mars remake uses a small LED strip or bulb facing down.

[42:55] The original was a 150 volt actual strobe bulb which is very intense.

[43:02] It wouldn't be cost effective to do today as it uses special power supply and bulb.

[43:08] I'm sure the new one can be easily, cheaply modded to accomplish a similar effect.

[43:13] All right, so there you go.

[43:16] For those of you out there who want your strobe multi-ball to look as intense as the original,

[43:22] there will probably be a mod for that.

[43:25] The other thing that people seem to be annoyed by in terms of the differences of the new one.

[43:30] And this is not an improvement.

[43:32] This made me laugh.

[43:33] The knocker in the back box.

[43:36] The knocker on the original was one inch from the top of the back box.

[43:42] So the knocker knocks into the wood and gives you that sound when you have a high score

[43:47] or you accomplish something.

[43:49] The knocker in the new game is only a half of an inch away from the wood.

[43:56] So that means that when it knocks, it really knocks, which is scaring the hell out of people

[44:03] and which is too loud for some.

[44:05] So they're unplugging the knocker.

[44:08] Oh my god, when I read stuff like this, complaints like this, I'm like, really?

[44:12] I never, to be honest, I always thought knockers were stupid to begin with.

[44:16] I never, when I first got into Pimbal, first got into it.

[44:21] And I had Lord of the Rings in my apartment.

[44:23] And that thing, it knocked for the first time.

[44:26] I thought my game broke.

[44:27] I was like, what the hell is this?

[44:29] I mean, clearly the knocker was put in there to make a sound so loud that it could be heard

[44:36] in a super loud arcade on location.

[44:39] In a home use environment, it's absolutely terrifying to people who have never experienced

[44:44] one before.

[44:45] So for this one to be even louder, just unplug it, it's stupid.

[44:48] It doesn't, to me, it doesn't mean anything.

[44:51] I mean, half of these guys are playing in their homes when the thing knocks.

[44:55] The only thing it's doing is annoying their wife and kids.

[44:58] And they're just in the basement.

[44:59] I'm like, I got a high score.

[45:00] No one else cares in the household at all.

[45:02] All right.

[45:03] So just unplug the knocker.

[45:04] What else is going on?

[45:06] Still no Batman code update.

[45:09] People were expecting Lyman to maybe drop before the holiday weekend.

[45:13] It didn't happen.

[45:14] Here's the thing with Batman 66.

[45:16] It's been seven months since the game came out.

[45:20] The game is still not done.

[45:22] And someone pointed something out that's really interesting because I think a lot of times

[45:27] people look at Lyman games and they know that it'll eventually get done and they're excited

[45:33] for it to eventually get done.

[45:34] And they look at his past games and they really hope that it becomes as good as a game

[45:40] like the Walking Dead, for example.

[45:42] But someone pointed something out pretty, that's pretty interesting when you think about

[45:45] it.

[45:46] The Walking Dead, when it shipped, it shipped with code 1.0.

[45:51] So it shipped with a game that was complete.

[45:53] Okay.

[45:54] The game was complete.

[45:55] Like you can play it or wizard mode like the game was there.

[45:58] Lyman then went in and polished it to make it even better.

[46:03] So he took a complete game and enhanced it.

[46:06] The problem with Batman, it's not complete.

[46:09] It's only three-fourths of the way to being even at one point.

[46:13] Oh.

[46:14] And so for a lot of people out there, what that means is for Lyman to get to the special

[46:22] sort of sweet sauce spot where he's making the game magical, it feels like it could be

[46:28] a really, really long way.

[46:31] And because the updates are not coming that frequently, a lot of speculation that he's

[46:35] also working on other stuff right now, that Batman is not his sole focus.

[46:41] So unless Stern tells us otherwise that it is his main focus, it's hard to imagine that

[46:47] he's not being pulled into other directions.

[46:50] I don't, he's definitely not given up on it.

[46:53] But I find it hard to believe that it would be the only thing that he's working on right

[46:58] now.

[46:59] All right.

[47:00] So let's talk about another manufacturer.

[47:03] Let's talk about multi-morphic NP3.

[47:06] So Jerry has sent out an email.

[47:10] I want to read where they're at right now.

[47:14] So he writes this.

[47:16] We've partitioned the production floor into build stations where each station is responsible

[47:23] for one or more subassemblies.

[47:25] IE flippers, wall scoops, side targets, chassis, cabinet, back box, upper plate field.

[47:34] Okay.

[47:35] So he goes through a list of bunch of things.

[47:36] Each subassembly is built, tested, and then prepared to go into a machine.

[47:41] When all the subassemblies are ready, machines are fully assembled.

[47:46] Last minute adjustments are made, and then machines go through a final testing procedure.

[47:51] No production machines have officially shipped yet, but that's about to change.

[47:56] He doesn't say when that's about to change.

[48:00] For those of you in the second production run, we're now looking at starting second-run

[48:06] shipments in September.

[48:08] If you're not a first or second-run customer, but want to buy a P3, please email me to get

[48:15] on our list.

[48:17] We have new inventory available.

[48:19] We'll contact you.

[48:21] See, I don't...

[48:23] What does that mean, like, new inventory available?

[48:27] There isn't any inventory at all right now.

[48:33] I think what it means is if he's building 25 at a time, and he's sold 25, and the next

[48:39] 25, that he has a spot on the third run of, let's say, 25 machines.

[48:46] These things are trickling out.

[48:49] I wish Jerry luck, but he's got to get these things out.

[48:53] It feels like it's been forever and a day, and I think the problem he's going to face.

[48:59] He knows this.

[49:01] Is Lexi Light Speed?

[49:02] Is a game that's been out now for years?

[49:05] People haven't had it in their homes, but all this time, all these years of developing

[49:12] this platform, and all the money going around the shows, and it's just like, man, I've

[49:19] really thought they would have surprised us with something new at launch.

[49:27] That Lexi feels old, whether even like redoing the artwork on it, just doing something to

[49:34] breathe new life into it.

[49:36] P3 Multimorphic, it reminds me a little bit of the Acura NSX.

[49:40] It's like a car we saw for so many years, right?

[49:45] We saw it in a Super Bowl ad years ago.

[49:49] By the time it came out, it was at car shows, it did the circuits, by the time it ended

[49:53] up coming out, it just didn't feel new.

[49:58] Because of that, hype and attention went to stuff that was brand new.

[50:06] I think Jerry needs to figure that part out.

[50:09] When I read the emails too, Jerry's like he's a technical guy.

[50:12] He's like the engineer.

[50:13] He's like the guy building it.

[50:14] I think they need marketing help.

[50:16] I think they need people to be more of a hype machine.

[50:21] When I read the emails, they're all very technical.

[50:25] I get it, but I think they need to have a little bit of left brain, right brain working together

[50:32] to get the company where it needs to be.

[50:36] That's what he needs to do.

[50:38] I think Jerry needs to get someone in charge of marketing.

[50:41] I think he's doing it all.

[50:42] I think sometimes the technical guys aren't the best at the marketing side of it.

[50:48] Sometimes it is the marketing guy that says, hey, we really need a licensed theme here.

[50:53] We really need to communicate to customers in a way that's a little bit more celebratory

[50:59] and a little bit more about hype and creating buzz versus the technical explanations of where

[51:06] we currently are in these long paragraphs.

[51:09] I think that would help Jerry's company.

[51:12] Here's the thing.

[51:13] We will always say this because Jerry didn't rip anyone off.

[51:16] He didn't take anyone's money and not deliver.

[51:19] Everyone who's in on a P3 will get it.

[51:21] He didn't sell 200 spots and then not deliver.

[51:27] He's done it the right way.

[51:28] He didn't take pre-order dollars.

[51:29] If you don't take pre-order dollars, you are a good guy.

[51:34] In this hobby, that is seen nothing but a bunch of people rip a lot of people off.

[51:40] We can congratulate them on doing that.

[51:42] Let's end on another manufacturer.

[51:45] These podcasts, guys, they go on and on and on because there's just so many companies

[51:53] in Pimball.

[51:54] I haven't really talked about Stern much at all and we're almost at an hour.

[51:58] I want to talk about HomePin and something interesting that I saw in the HomePin thread.

[52:06] Mike over at HomePin is a unique individual.

[52:09] He's very outspoken.

[52:11] He's very in your face.

[52:14] He doesn't back down from an argument.

[52:18] He's building a Pimball company from the ground up in China.

[52:23] You got to have balls of steel to do that.

[52:26] He's close.

[52:27] He's close to getting his game out.

[52:29] He's done things that I have questioned.

[52:33] Him going into other manufacturer threads and talking smack.

[52:37] I would not do that if I were him.

[52:40] I wouldn't show his game in pieces.

[52:45] I think his marketing is a little scattered.

[52:49] None of it matters.

[52:50] If HomePin is good, if the Thunderbird turns out to be a hit, I think people will buy it.

[52:58] If the price is what the rumor is going to be, somewhere maybe south of 6 grand, I think

[53:04] he has a real interesting value proposition.

[53:08] That's not what I want to talk about.

[53:10] I want to talk about Mike getting into arguments with people on Pinside and Mike saying, this

[53:17] is why manufacturers do not join Pinside.

[53:22] You have people who will troll the manufacturers and will basically hijack a thread about

[53:29] a game and make it all about them.

[53:32] I know firsthand how easy it is to do that because I did that when I was a troll at times

[53:39] on Pinside.

[53:40] You know the guys, they go into a thread about a game they are never going to buy and

[53:47] they remind people over and over and over again why they are not going to buy it, what they

[53:51] don't like about it.

[53:53] If you are a manufacturer, how annoying is that?

[53:56] You are trying to create positive energy, positive vibes for your product and you have these

[54:01] people who just relentlessly won't stop bashing it or saying they are two cents.

[54:08] With my good friend Iceman who continues to remind us why he is not buying a dial

[54:13] then.

[54:14] We get it, you are not buying one, it's not for you.

[54:18] He defends Star Wars over dialed in and I think he is crazy, I don't think Star Wars

[54:23] is going to be better than dialed in.

[54:24] It's a much better theme for sure.

[54:28] But that's the kind of behavior that Pinside is known for and Pinside is becoming an environment

[54:37] where people that want to do that are left alone.

[54:42] They are allowed to go in to threads and just hijack them and make them all about themselves.

[54:48] Until Robin figures out the right moderation balance, he is always going to run the risk

[54:54] of protecting the trolls and losing the manufacturers.

[54:59] And Mike has been asking Robin for an interesting thing though and I want to talk about this

[55:03] a little bit.

[55:05] Mike has been petitioning Robin to allow manufacturers to edit and their own threads.

[55:14] So they would have admin privileges within their own threads.

[55:18] So if Mike started, if Mike is the founder of Homepin, he would be able to moderate his

[55:26] own thread.

[55:27] He would be able to kick people out.

[55:30] He would be able to do whatever it is that moderators are allowed to do within that thread.

[55:36] And to me though, that's crossing the line.

[55:39] I don't want a pinball company to have the ability to moderate their own thread on a public

[55:47] form.

[55:48] And I'll explain why.

[55:50] Because as we've seen, even over the last year, how many pinball companies out there have

[55:56] supplied, how many pinball companies out there have suppressed the truth about their company

[56:02] to the point where they basically took people's money, were disingenuous and put people's

[56:13] money in jeopardy.

[56:15] And imagine if Andrew Highway had the ability to control his thread.

[56:20] Right?

[56:21] What would that thread have been like?

[56:23] So all the skeptics, all the people that were sort of waving red flags, all the people

[56:28] that were trying to help people see what was really going on, he would have booted from

[56:33] the thread.

[56:35] How would Barry and Yop moderate their thread?

[56:39] Right?

[56:40] When people go in and be like, these guys are lying.

[56:42] They lied to me.

[56:43] They didn't give me a refund.

[56:44] Like, F, these guys, they can simply silence those individuals.

[56:49] So I don't think it's a good idea to ever give a pinball manufacturer the ability to

[56:57] moderate a public form.

[56:59] I think where pinside shines is in its ability to allow people to express their opinions.

[57:06] In fact, I think sometimes the moderators go too far to silence people who are skeptical.

[57:14] But you know, and then sometimes they just let the same old trolls dominate.

[57:18] And that's the challenge of pinside moderation.

[57:22] Right?

[57:23] It's the challenge that Robin and his team have on a daily basis is they've got to deal with

[57:29] grown men, many of whom are on their way too much, way too much all the time.

[57:37] Every day, during a holiday, during the weekends, during the nights, these guys live on the

[57:42] site.

[57:43] You know, pinside becomes a second home to these hyper users that, you know, the persona

[57:50] that they have on pinside to those individuals, they mean something more on pinside than

[57:57] those people do in the real world.

[57:59] Right?

[58:00] These people don't have the same attention or clout or following that they do on pinside.

[58:06] You know, they go out to a restaurant.

[58:07] No one gets to shoot who they are.

[58:08] They probably go into the office.

[58:10] No one cares who they are at work.

[58:12] But on pinside, there's somebody.

[58:14] On pinside, they get an immediate response to whatever they say.

[58:18] And that sort of addiction to that behavior is what turns the hyper users into addicts.

[58:26] And really, you know, makes pinside a place where it really is just like 100 hyper users

[58:31] who control every single conversation happening with every new thread.

[58:36] It's why this podcast is successful because I can operate outside of that.

[58:42] And I can call them out when they're wrong and I can say whatever I want without being

[58:47] moderated.

[58:48] You know, my days have ever getting back on pinside are numbered and that's fine.

[58:55] But I do think that freedom of speech, especially on this day of independence, is the most important

[59:02] thing.

[59:03] And I don't think that moderators should ever have the power to silence the skeptics of their

[59:09] organizations.

[59:10] I mean, imagine if Jack was in control of his thread when people were bitching about

[59:14] the artwork for the Hobbit, he might have just deleted people and released the game the

[59:18] way it was instead of making it better.

[59:21] So I think there is a place for people to complain and moan about stuff without fear of being

[59:28] ejected by the people they're complaining about.

[59:31] So that's it.

[59:34] I'm off in a few days to Las Vegas.

[59:38] No, I will not be going to the pinball hall of fame.

[59:42] Unlike many of you, when I take a vacation, I take a vacation.

[59:46] You know, I'm not like road o' Dave.

[59:48] I'm not going to travel around the world seeking out pinball.

[59:51] I get it.

[59:52] Like that's his thing.

[59:53] But man, it's like I can play pinball all over New York City.

[59:57] I'm not going to go to Vegas that has all these things I can't possibly do and go play

[01:00:02] more pinball.

[01:00:04] I don't love it that much where it becomes the center of my vacation.

[01:00:08] I will never bring my family around the world to seek out pinball.

[01:00:13] It is everywhere in New York City.

[01:00:16] There's plenty of pinball.

[01:00:18] So I will just be enjoying the extremely warm weather.

[01:00:21] I will be in a pool and I won't be bringing the computer with me.

[01:00:25] So that means you are not going to get another Canadian pinball podcast until sometime early

[01:00:31] next week.

[01:00:32] So I hope you enjoyed this one.

[01:00:35] Send me any listener feedback you have.

[01:00:38] Yes, I do read the comments people put on my SoundCloud page.

[01:00:43] There's some guy in there.

[01:00:44] He won't stop.

[01:00:45] I have to calm out.

[01:00:46] Let me calm out by name here because if you're going to leave me a comment on SoundCloud,

[01:00:51] just leave one.

[01:00:52] Like don't leave comments throughout the episode where you have to bookmark your comment exactly

[01:00:59] to where I said that thing.

[01:01:03] This guy, I got 11 comments on my last podcast from David, Michael Malambre, David,

[01:01:10] homebre.

[01:01:11] Just relax buddy.

[01:01:13] You don't collect your thoughts.

[01:01:15] Give me one message.

[01:01:16] Email me at www.kinnativepinball.gmail.com.

[01:01:18] All right.

[01:01:19] I'm still getting people who demon bookmark and hellcat bookmark from nobody is Sherman.

[01:01:26] So yes, the demon has been ordered.

[01:01:29] I snagged one of the 3000 coming to the United States at sticker price.

[01:01:36] We may flip it for a small fortune.

[01:01:37] We might keep it.

[01:01:39] We'll see.

[01:01:40] All right.

[01:01:41] Have a happy, happy rest of your week.

[01:01:44] I know it's depressing day back at work.

[01:01:46] I've always said this.

[01:01:47] The 4th of July, the next day should be off.

[01:01:51] This great country of ours.

[01:01:53] We have this celebration of our independence.

[01:01:57] It's a nighttime celebration with fireworks and barbecues throughout the day and beer

[01:02:01] and drinking.

[01:02:02] And then it's like, get your ass back to work the next day.

[01:02:05] When everyone's hungover is up late watching fireworks, I think it's pathetic.

[01:02:10] I was just in Canada and they were celebrating their 150th birthday.

[01:02:16] It was great.

[01:02:17] It was like a, it was like people were celebrating all weekend.

[01:02:20] I think it's a problem in America.

[01:02:22] As we work way too hard.

[01:02:24] We have to go back to work if we're going to afford $9,000 pinball machines.

[01:02:29] That we absolutely do not need that are unnecessary items.

[01:02:33] All right, guys.

[01:02:34] I will talk to you in a week.

[01:02:36] Go check out Nate's latest podcast and hit me up at canadapinball.com with any feedback.

[01:02:43] If you'd like to be a guest, hit me up again.

[01:02:45] Remind me if you want to be a guest because it gets buried in my inbox.

[01:02:49] We'll get more people on because I haven't had an interview in a while.

[01:02:52] I don't think the Jared one is ever Aaron.

[01:02:55] It's, they'll all air it like 20 years from now.

[01:02:58] Have a great day.

[01:02:59] We'll talk to you soon.
