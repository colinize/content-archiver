[00:00] Yeah, rockin' real clapping ass leads like the 80s,

[00:02] Never give it up until the reaper comes slain me,

[00:05] Pull over to Zelda and a peach in the days,

[00:07] I be dirty dancing all the yelling gravy swings.

[00:09] Soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda.

[00:14] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:17] the first podcast in 2023.

[00:20] I hope each and every one of you had a really great holidays,

[00:23] I hope you had a great new year.

[00:25] I don't know about you guys, but it's exhausting.

[00:28] I find like the week between Christmas and New Year's,

[00:31] I don't even know what day of the week it is.

[00:34] I don't know why I'm drinking again,

[00:36] I don't know why I'm eating all this food every day,

[00:38] I normally would not eat, but I'll tell you this,

[00:41] it's not a recharging time of year.

[00:44] I feel like we all slide into January,

[00:47] feeling like we just destroyed our bodies,

[00:50] and then we're like, let's do dry January,

[00:52] which I wanted to do, but after day one,

[00:55] I've already had some wine yesterday,

[00:56] so it didn't really happen.

[00:57] But you're not here to talk about resolutions,

[00:59] we're here to talk about pinball,

[01:01] and so what are we gonna talk about

[01:02] on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[01:04] Well, we're gonna talk about the Twippies,

[01:06] and I will say, I think each and every one of you

[01:09] who filled out a Twippy ballot,

[01:11] and thank you so much for all of your votes,

[01:13] I think we all felt one thing,

[01:16] what an underwhelming year for pinball.

[01:19] I didn't even wanna give a vote

[01:21] for half of these categories,

[01:23] because I just didn't feel good about most of it.

[01:26] I almost felt like most of it was just a default vote.

[01:30] Like I have to put in something, so I'll put in this,

[01:34] but I didn't feel great about the majority

[01:37] of the votes during this year's Twippies.

[01:40] The only real feel good one is Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[01:44] and Canada's Facebook live stream.

[01:46] Thank you everybody, and make sure you get the other members

[01:49] of your family to vote for Canada,

[01:51] and I think we've got it in the bag,

[01:53] and I've got the cargo shorts ready.

[01:55] So we're gonna talk about the Twippies,

[01:57] we're gonna talk about how tomorrow

[01:59] at the world's Mecca of Innovation and Technology,

[02:03] Stern Pinball is gonna roll out

[02:06] a single level James Bond Pinball machine,

[02:09] and we will finally know if this Keith Elwin machine

[02:14] is gonna be worth the humongous price tag

[02:17] Stern puts on this machine.

[02:19] We don't know what the price is, is it gonna be 15,000,

[02:22] is it gonna be 17,500, 20,000, 25,000?

[02:27] But unlike Elvira, what's really interesting

[02:31] about this game is Stern Pinball's gonna put a price on it.

[02:35] So we will know exactly what Stern values this game at,

[02:39] and I think this is gonna be a really big moment

[02:41] for Stern Pinball because it's gonna broadcast to us.

[02:45] Has this company jumped the shark?

[02:47] Are they now the greediest company in all of Pinball?

[02:50] We shall see.

[02:51] And the other thing I wanna talk about,

[02:53] and we're gonna start on this,

[02:54] we'll end with the Twippies, let's start on this.

[02:56] Stern Pinball to start 2023 is going to officially

[03:00] raise the price of every single game

[03:04] that is in inventory with distributors

[03:07] to the current price model of James Bond.

[03:11] So that means every single pro,

[03:13] I think the pros are now like 6,800 bucks,

[03:16] and the premiums are really where it's gonna hurt.

[03:19] The premiums are now like $9,700 for a Stern premium.

[03:26] And what sucks about this for everybody out there,

[03:29] I mean, it sucks for consumers,

[03:31] it sucks for distributors, it sucks for everybody,

[03:35] and I'll tell you why,

[03:36] because how can you raise the price of a game

[03:39] that is sitting at a distributor unsold?

[03:43] You didn't put more money into the game,

[03:46] it didn't cost you any more money to make that game.

[03:49] You priced that game accordingly,

[03:52] based upon how much money it was to make that game

[03:56] in that year.

[03:57] And I think this is a bad move for Stern,

[04:00] I think they should be honoring the price of the game

[04:04] in which you ordered the game for that price.

[04:08] So you walk in and you order an Elvira premium

[04:11] for 8,500 bucks.

[04:14] And if you wanna pick up the game

[04:15] that you ordered two years ago,

[04:18] Stern now wants you to spend $10,500 on an Elvira premium.

[04:23] Why aren't they honoring the price

[04:26] at which they agreed the sale upon?

[04:29] And I don't like it, and I don't think anybody likes it.

[04:32] Like who would actually like any of this?

[04:35] So that is one of the big stories

[04:37] of the beginning of the year,

[04:38] is now Stern pinball games are really expensive.

[04:41] Jersey Jack has priced themselves into a box now too,

[04:45] at 12,000 and 15,000 bucks.

[04:48] Jersey Jack doesn't even have a single affordable game

[04:52] in pinball right now.

[04:54] Think about it, their LA is almost twice

[04:56] the price of a Stern pro.

[04:58] So now Jersey Jack pinballs are no longer even viable

[05:02] for most people who are just getting into this hobby.

[05:05] And I don't know about the rest of you, gang,

[05:06] but like I spent a lot of money this holiday on food

[05:09] and on presents and on other items.

[05:12] And I'm looking at my credit card bill.

[05:14] And the last thing I would wanna do right now

[05:16] is write a check for a James Bond LE for like 14.5

[05:21] with tax and shipping.

[05:23] Now let's talk about James Bond real quick, okay?

[05:25] So we're gonna see the Elwin pin.

[05:26] We're gonna talk about that tomorrow.

[05:28] I'm gonna tell you right now, there's a really good chance.

[05:30] I'm gonna do another podcast tomorrow

[05:33] about my first impressions on this Keith Elwin pin.

[05:36] It's been a fumbled launch.

[05:38] It's weird to bring it to CES.

[05:40] Like that's not where you would unveil

[05:42] a James Bond 60th collectible item.

[05:46] The fact that they missed all of the James Bond

[05:49] 60th celebration stuff,

[05:51] they never brought the Keith Elwin pin to any of it.

[05:53] And instead you're gonna bring it to CES

[05:56] in which we're celebrating the most innovative

[05:59] and modern technology.

[06:00] You're gonna bring a single level pinball machine

[06:03] with scoring reels and a cheap screen in the play field

[06:07] into the den of the most highly advanced technology

[06:10] on planet earth.

[06:11] Really questionable moves.

[06:13] Stern, you're not a modern technology company.

[06:16] Video games went online like 20 years ago.

[06:20] You brought pinball online like three years ago.

[06:24] It's a little embarrassing.

[06:25] I don't know why Stern even bothers spending money

[06:28] to go to CES.

[06:29] Here's the other big news people.

[06:30] We're now learning that there is an issue

[06:33] with the James Bond license holder

[06:36] and how they can code this game.

[06:38] So apparently the license holder does not want them

[06:41] to like mix up different scenes from different movies.

[06:45] So you can't stack like a multi-ball with a villain mode

[06:50] if the multi-ball is not from the same movie as that villain.

[06:55] So think about that for a minute.

[06:58] Almost all of pinball coding revolves around

[07:02] this sort of layering up of all of the different elements

[07:06] in the franchise.

[07:07] And the fact that they can't do this with James Bond,

[07:11] I think would have me really nervous

[07:14] that this is gonna be a huge monkey wrench

[07:16] into the coding process of James Bond pinball.

[07:20] Now I hope Stern pinball is able to convince

[07:22] the license holder to be more flexible, but if they're not,

[07:26] like think about this for a minute.

[07:27] Because right now, if you start a multi-ball,

[07:31] it cancels out your villain mode that you're in.

[07:34] Do you know another pinball machine that has to do that?

[07:38] So I'd be really nervous if I was a James Bond owner

[07:42] right now, knowing that even though they have the assets,

[07:46] they might not be able to arrange them

[07:48] in a way that works really beneficial for pinball.

[07:52] And this is why I've been saying it

[07:53] and I'll say it again, you got to wait and see.

[07:57] This whole belief that every single game

[07:59] will end up amazingly well is just an illusion.

[08:03] Like we don't know what the final verdict is on James Bond.

[08:07] The other thing I'll say about James Bond is this,

[08:09] I went over to Jack Barr, I played the game a lot,

[08:12] I put about 30 bucks into James Bond.

[08:15] I think 30 plays of a machine is a good amount

[08:18] to get a feel for it.

[08:19] And I'm gonna say this right now, the game is good.

[08:22] I had fun playing the game, but the game is hard.

[08:25] Like it's not super easy to hit like that right ramp,

[08:28] the villain shot.

[08:29] And a lot of the shots in the game are pretty difficult.

[08:32] It's not a standard layout, it's not a fan layout,

[08:36] but the shots are really challenging.

[08:38] And I was thinking of myself coming out of James Bond.

[08:41] Like casual pinball players are not gonna see

[08:43] hardly anything in this game.

[08:45] The thing that I'm surprised about with James Bond

[08:48] is if you just shoot the ball up the middle,

[08:51] you're really not gonna start anything really interesting.

[08:54] And I still don't like the missile in the game.

[08:58] I think it doesn't really do anything.

[09:00] I don't think it adds any value whatsoever.

[09:02] I think the missile needed to have a moment

[09:05] where like it comes up from underneath the play field

[09:07] and there's some dramatic thing it does.

[09:10] But right now the ball just wax into it.

[09:13] It wobbles back and forth.

[09:14] And it takes up this huge area of real estate.

[09:18] It's just a questionable toy to put in a game.

[09:22] And I would even argue it's not a toy.

[09:25] It's just a plastic shlong that you keep hitting.

[09:28] Like it's not enjoyable to bash that thing.

[09:32] All right, but we'll see.

[09:33] We'll see.

[09:34] A lot of James Bond LEDs are starting to pop up for sale.

[09:37] And I think people are realizing at these prices,

[09:41] people are not gonna wanna have to wait two years

[09:43] for a game to be complete.

[09:45] I also think James Bond hype is completely over.

[09:48] And I think the James Bond fanatics

[09:50] are a little bit annoyed right now.

[09:53] Because if you're a James Bond fan,

[09:55] I think you're really annoyed that Stern pinball

[09:58] on purpose didn't show you the Elwynn pin.

[10:01] They made all of you pay and fall for your LEDs

[10:05] before they showed you the Keith Elwynn game.

[10:07] And if I was a Bond fanatic, I would be so annoyed right now.

[10:12] Because now if you want the Elwynn pin over the Gomez pin,

[10:15] what do you do now?

[10:17] You gotta go sell the Gomez pin.

[10:19] And if you want both,

[10:20] now you're gonna be shelling out like 40 grand

[10:23] on two Stern machines.

[10:25] I think it was a sleazy marketing move.

[10:27] I do because they put every single game

[10:29] into like the press release

[10:31] when they announced these James Bond games.

[10:33] And they easily could have shown you the Elwynn pin.

[10:36] Even if it wasn't ready,

[10:38] they could have showed you like the gameplay

[10:40] and the features and they could have told you

[10:42] how much it would cost

[10:43] and that it would be available sometime in January.

[10:47] Why didn't they do that?

[10:48] They wanted to lock in all your money and they did it.

[10:51] And Stern's never done this before.

[10:53] There has never been a moment in the history of Stern pinball

[10:56] in which they've done this,

[10:58] in which they've created a fourth version

[11:01] of a popular theme and they're gonna release it

[11:03] as a highly collectible super expensive game

[11:06] and they know the target is the James Bond fan.

[11:09] They've never done this before.

[11:11] We will see how this plays out.

[11:12] But my bet is tomorrow,

[11:15] you're gonna see a lot of people laughing out loud

[11:18] and I think chastising Stern pinball

[11:21] for what I am predicting to be

[11:23] a really greedy cash grab moment.

[11:26] All right, now look, it's 2023.

[11:29] And I think each and every one of us

[11:31] is feeling the same way going into pinball this year.

[11:35] This year, we need a magical pin.

[11:38] We need a game that restores all of our faith

[11:41] in new inbox pinball.

[11:43] Will it be Scooby-Doo?

[11:44] I don't know.

[11:45] Will it be James Bond when code is finished?

[11:47] I don't know.

[11:48] I can tell you right now,

[11:49] after looking at what this industry was capable of in 2022,

[11:54] it was kind of embarrassing.

[11:56] And I think a lot of people are feeling that like deflation.

[11:59] Like we need to get more creativity into this hobby

[12:03] with all of these companies making all of these products.

[12:06] And I get that there was like a COVID supply chain issue,

[12:09] but a COVID supply chain does not impact your creativity.

[12:12] It does not impact your imagination.

[12:15] And as I was going through this year's Twippy voting,

[12:18] I was like, this is it?

[12:20] Like this is all we have to choose from.

[12:22] So I'm gonna go down real quickly

[12:23] and tell you what I picked

[12:24] as the first choice for each category.

[12:26] I'm not gonna go through all three.

[12:28] It'll get too boring.

[12:29] So for best theme in all of pinball in 2022,

[12:34] I gave it to James Bond.

[12:36] I think from a theme standpoint alone,

[12:38] I think it was the best theme for pinball.

[12:40] For best animations and display.

[12:42] I struggled with this one.

[12:44] I don't think I've seen any company's displays

[12:47] that absolutely blew me away.

[12:49] I don't think anyone's display or animations

[12:52] were super stellar this year.

[12:54] I mean, usually Jersey Jack runs away with this.

[12:57] There's nothing about toy story displays

[12:59] or animation that wows me.

[13:01] There's nothing in Rush that wows me.

[13:02] There's nothing in James Bond that wows me.

[13:05] So I gave it to the Dot Matrix display

[13:08] of Cactus Canyon remake.

[13:10] Best toys and mechs in a game.

[13:13] Talk about this was probably the hardest thing

[13:17] to vote for in all of the Twippies.

[13:19] Cause I don't think any of these games

[13:21] have incredible toys or mechs.

[13:23] Weird Ow, Super Hoop, James Bond, Rush,

[13:27] and Toy Story 4.

[13:29] I gave it to Rush by Stern Pinball.

[13:33] Best sound in a pinball machine,

[13:35] I also gave to Rush because, you know,

[13:37] sound also includes like the music

[13:40] and not for nothing.

[13:41] If you're a Rush fan,

[13:42] it's got all of that great Rush music

[13:44] if you love Rush in the game.

[13:46] Best rules in a game, I also gave to Rush Pinball.

[13:51] I haven't played that much of Rush,

[13:54] but I've heard such great things

[13:55] about the rule set of the game.

[13:57] Now here's where it gets interesting.

[13:59] Best play field gameplay and layout.

[14:01] Now I have played every single game here.

[14:04] I've played Rush, I've played Toy Story,

[14:07] I've played James Bond.

[14:08] Well, I haven't played Super Hoop

[14:10] and I've played Weird Ow.

[14:12] And I mean it when I say it.

[14:13] If I'm looking at this category

[14:16] at face value, what is the most fun game to shoot

[14:20] based on the layout?

[14:22] I gave this to Toy Story 4.

[14:25] And this is gonna be one of those examples

[14:26] where like layout and design,

[14:28] I think Toy Story 4 has the best layout,

[14:31] but there's no way it's gonna win best game of the year.

[14:34] And that's like in the Academy Awards, right?

[14:36] When someone wins best director, but not best film.

[14:40] It gets really weird.

[14:41] It's like, how can you be the best director

[14:44] if the film you directed isn't the best?

[14:47] But that is what I think is gonna happen

[14:49] in this year's Twippies.

[14:50] All right, best artwork.

[14:51] This was another one.

[14:52] It was like, oh my gosh, I don't wanna vote for it.

[14:55] But if I just stood back and looked at all of the games

[14:58] that came out last year, Toy Story 4 does look the sexiest.

[15:03] And that artwork is basically from Disney and Pixar.

[15:06] And that's why it looks so good.

[15:09] I wanna also say this.

[15:10] Will the Twippy committee please wake up?

[15:13] Will they wake up a little bit

[15:15] and actually understand the consumer experience of voting?

[15:19] Why is it when I'm looking at best layout

[15:22] or best artwork or best mod,

[15:25] why are there no images on the Twippy's website

[15:30] so I can see all the different art packages

[15:33] and all the different layouts and all the different toys?

[15:36] This is the most ridiculous and lazy way

[15:39] to get people to vote.

[15:41] The only place they show you images

[15:43] is on the homebrew section.

[15:45] Why are you kidding me?

[15:46] You're giving the homebrew games more real estate

[15:50] and more love than the major games that we're voting on

[15:54] from each manufacturer.

[15:55] Guys, we know you can have images on the dropdown menus.

[15:59] Please, next year, upload some images

[16:03] so we can see what we're voting on.

[16:05] All right, so best artwork goes to Toy Story Game of the Year.

[16:09] This is easily gonna be Rush, so I put Rush by Stern.

[16:13] Favorite pinball streamer, you know me, I'm a narcissist,

[16:16] so I put Kanata's Facebook Live,

[16:19] favorite pinball podcast,

[16:20] of course, Kanata's Pinball Podcast.

[16:23] I think we're gonna go six for six.

[16:24] Thank you for your votes.

[16:26] Favorite pinball YouTube channel,

[16:28] I gave it to my friend Todd over at TNT Amusements.

[16:31] Favorite pinball mod of 2022.

[16:34] This was another one where I was like,

[16:36] there's like 10 options here

[16:38] and there's no way I'm gonna go look at all of these.

[16:41] They should have had photos.

[16:43] I did the Neon Tokyo sign from Godzilla.

[16:46] Favorite pinball website,

[16:48] I'm so tired of Pinside winning it

[16:50] because they never change anything.

[16:52] I gave this to Naps Arcade.

[16:54] I actually like going to Naps more than Pinside.

[16:57] I have to go to Pinside,

[16:59] but when I really wanna get the news in real time,

[17:02] Naps Arcade is where it's at.

[17:04] I also gave Will this advice.

[17:06] They need to do a category like best new pinball podcast.

[17:11] Best new pinball website.

[17:13] You've gotta give people who are starting

[17:16] new content channels a chance to win

[17:20] without having to go against like these dinosaurs,

[17:23] these legacy people like Kanata and Pinside

[17:27] because I would love it.

[17:28] If they did best new pinball podcast,

[17:30] you know what that would do?

[17:31] That would invite so many new people

[17:34] to throw their hat into the pinball podcasting ring.

[17:38] And then it would be more exciting

[17:40] than it being the same names every year.

[17:42] Favorite pinball location.

[17:44] This was another one like I haven't been

[17:46] to any of these places,

[17:47] but my good friend runs the pinball palace

[17:50] in Brunswick, Georgia.

[17:51] So I voted for pinball palace.

[17:53] If you don't know where to vote

[17:55] for favorite pinball location,

[17:57] do Kanata a solid and vote for the pinball palace.

[18:00] Favorite pinball convention.

[18:02] It's funny, the award show is held at TPF.

[18:04] It always wins this.

[18:06] It's gonna be TPF.

[18:07] And favorite pinball topper.

[18:09] Now look, this was between Mandalorian

[18:12] and Cactus Canyon remake.

[18:14] And I voted not for Mandalorian

[18:16] because even though it's cool, it's not $2,000.

[18:20] Cool.

[18:21] I voted for the Cactus Canyon topper

[18:23] because it's free on the LE machine.

[18:26] And I think we should start celebrating

[18:28] and rewarding companies who also give us value.

[18:32] There's absolutely no value in that $2,000 mando topper.

[18:37] Someone was saying it the other day.

[18:39] They're like, I just bought an Xbox for $500.

[18:44] And Stern's gonna ask us for two grand.

[18:47] You could buy four Xboxes for the price of one mando topper.

[18:53] I think we're all gonna wake up in 2023.

[18:55] I think we're all gonna wait to see

[18:57] if these games are any good before we chase after New Inbox.

[19:00] I think 2023 needs to raise the bar.

[19:04] We need a game that makes us fall in love

[19:06] with new games again.

[19:07] And I mean it, after going through these titles of 2022,

[19:11] it was kind of like a snooze fest

[19:13] for mainstream pinball, New Inbox lovers.

[19:15] And this is it.

[19:16] Like this is it.

[19:17] It was an off year.

[19:18] I know we had a lot of COVID issues.

[19:20] Now we're gonna see if this hobby on a New Inbox level

[19:23] is worth emotionally investing

[19:26] in the way we've been doing it over the last like 10 years.

[19:29] And maybe it was a mis-year,

[19:31] but we need to see some wow people.

[19:33] And I think everybody feels the same way.

[19:35] Thank you everybody so much

[19:37] for being a member of the Canada Club.

[19:38] I appreciate all of your support.

[19:40] All of your votes mean the world to me.

[19:42] It was another year in which people tried to cancel my show.

[19:46] A lot of people are upset with Canada.

[19:49] Canada puts his foot in his mouth every once in a while,

[19:52] but nobody else told you it was gonna be

[19:54] Keith Elwin's James Bond.

[19:56] Nobody will leak you information

[19:58] you really should know about.

[20:00] This is the only pinball podcast

[20:02] that is keeping these companies honest.

[20:04] It's keeping them accountable.

[20:06] I will absolutely praise a game

[20:08] when I think it's amazing,

[20:09] but I will absolutely go after a company

[20:12] if I think they whiffed on a pinball machine.

[20:14] And I absolutely won't just sit there and say,

[20:17] bye, bye, bye.

[20:19] Why would I tell you that you should be buying everything?

[20:22] You shouldn't be buying $15,000 toy stories.

[20:25] We shouldn't be having to spend $2,000 on plastic toppers.

[20:29] We need to start drawing a little bit of a line in the sand

[20:32] that says, hey, like if we're gonna spend this money,

[20:35] at least make the effort.

[20:38] Like people are starting to pop the hood on these games

[20:41] and realize there's nowhere near the money

[20:44] going into these machines anymore.

[20:46] And then you want me to pay $2,000 more

[20:48] for the same Elvira?

[20:50] You wanna jack the price up on a freaking Rush Premium?

[20:54] I mean, I'm hearing from all my Jistro friends,

[20:57] they can't get rid of Rush or Mando premiums.

[21:00] And now you just raise the prices?

[21:04] People, 2023 has just begun.

[21:07] But as you can tell,

[21:08] the pinball battleground is gonna be a battleground

[21:12] of value and magic.

[21:14] We don't mind spending these prices

[21:17] if the games are masterpieces.

[21:19] We're not gonna wait a year for code to be done.

[21:21] We're not gonna take your excuses anymore.

[21:24] We know what a magical pinball machine should be like.

[21:27] We need more Godzilla.

[21:28] We need more guns and roses.

[21:30] We need more Lord of the Rings.

[21:32] We need more ACDC.

[21:33] We need more Metallica.

[21:35] We know these companies are capable of doing it.

[21:37] But if they continue to cost cut

[21:39] while they raise the prices of these machines,

[21:42] people are gonna start heading for the new and box exits.

[21:45] You know, the sales forces,

[21:47] the distributors, they want magical, amazing titles.

[21:50] They're not gonna be able to hoodwink us or spin it.

[21:54] Like we can see with our own two eyes

[21:56] what goes into a game.

[21:58] And you can tell with your own two ears,

[22:00] who's got the world's favorite pinball podcast.

[22:03] Thank you for being here, everybody.

[22:04] I think we'll talk to you tomorrow, later.

[22:06] Never gonna take no loves,

[22:09] never gonna lose my socks.

[22:11] All I know is chase this.

[22:13] And get money.

[22:15] Get money, get money.

[22:16] Get money, get money, get money, get money, get money, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get,
