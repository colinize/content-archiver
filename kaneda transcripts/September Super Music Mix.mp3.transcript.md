[13:15] I was left

[13:16] Into my own diva

[13:19] A life

[13:20] I'm so serious, many days fall away with nothing to show

[13:29] And the walls cat-tombin' down in the city that we love

[13:36] Great clouds all over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[13:45] But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[13:52] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you'll be real before?

[14:00] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[14:04] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[14:09] And if we were caught, I'd find lost in all of our voices

[14:16] In your pearls, is the dust, sat over our dust

[14:23] And the walls cat-tombin' down in the city that we love

[14:31] Great clouds all over the hills, bringing darkness from above

[14:38] But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[14:47] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you'll be real before?

[14:56] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[15:05] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you'll be real before?

[15:11] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[15:16] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[15:22] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you'll be real before?

[15:27] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[15:33] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[15:41] But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[15:48] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you'll be real before?

[15:57] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[16:02] How am I gonna beat up the mist about this?

[16:05] If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

[16:15] And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you'll be real before?

[16:21] Feel my way through the darkness, getting by beaten hard

[16:28] I can't tell where the journey will end, but I know where to start

[16:36] They tell me I'm too young to understand, they say I'm caught up in a dream

[16:43] Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes, so that's fine by me

[16:50] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise or in a molded

[16:59] All this time I was finding myself in a, didn't know I was lost

[17:06] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise or in a molded

[17:14] All this time I was finding myself in a, didn't know I was lost

[17:58] I tried carrying the weight of the world, but I only have two hands

[18:15] All by getting the chance to travel the world, but I don't have any plans

[18:25] Wish that I could stay forever this year, not afraid to close my eyes

[18:32] Like the game made for everyone, and love is a prize

[18:39] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise or in a molded

[18:47] All this time I was finding myself in a, didn't know I was lost

[18:54] So wake me up when it's all over, when I'm wise or in a molded

[19:02] All this time I was finding myself in a, didn't know I was lost

[19:10] I didn't know I was lost, I didn't know I was lost

[19:41] When I was a boy, I dreamed I'd be a place in the sky, playing in the fields

[20:02] Balloting with my shields, boasting that I'm twine

[20:07] I wish I could see this world again through those eyes

[20:14] See the child of me, hear my fantasy never growing old

[20:22] Will we ever feel young again?

[20:29] Will we ever feel young again?

[20:37] Will we ever feel young again?

[20:44] Will we ever feel young again?

[21:14] When I was a boy, I searched for a world that's unknown

[21:43] All we have is fun, everybody runs until the sun goes down

[21:50] I wish I could see this world again through those eyes

[21:58] See the child of me, hear my fantasy never growing old

[22:06] Will we ever feel young again?

[22:12] Will we ever feel young again?

[22:20] Will we ever feel young again?

[22:27] Will we ever feel young again?

[22:57] Will we ever feel young again?

[23:28] Nobody here knocking at my door

[23:34] The sound of sight that I keep taking more

[23:41] Nobody bringing my telephone now

[23:48] Oh, how I miss such a beautiful sound

[23:55] And I don't even know how I survive

[27:01] Watchin' what you know, out to see it

[27:04] You can see your life out the window tonight

[27:12] If I lose myself tonight

[27:16] It'll be by your side, I lose myself tonight

[27:26] If I lose myself tonight, it'll be you and I

[27:33] It'll be myself tonight

[02:41:37] I guess I had to go to that place to get to this world.

[02:41:44] Now some of you might still be in that place.

[02:41:48] If you're trying to get out.

[02:41:51] I'm trying to get out.

[02:41:54] I'm trying to be trying to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay him.

[02:41:58] But you won't take this thing off these words before I say it.

[02:42:01] Cause ain't the way I'm gonna let you stop me from causing me.

[02:42:03] I'm gonna say I'm gonna do something, I do it.

[02:42:05] I don't give a damn what you think.

[02:42:07] I'm doing this for me.

[02:42:08] So fuck the world, feed it beings, just gasped up.

[02:42:10] If it things are stopping me, I'm gonna be what I set out to be.

[02:42:13] Without a doubt I'm tired of pleading.

[02:42:15] All those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony.

[02:42:17] No way fans of buzz, I'm trying to ask him why I'm balcony.

[02:42:20] From infinite time that I've asked me that,

[02:42:22] I've only still sitting with the reason salary paid.

[02:42:25] I only until he piles out, I restitue piles out of him.

[02:42:28] Whatever comes first, but better or worse.

[02:42:30] He's married to the gang like a fuck you for Christmas.

[02:42:33] He's gifted as a curse, but get the earth, he's got the earth.

[02:42:36] To pull this dick from the dirt in front of the whole universe.

[02:42:39] I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to take a step, take a step.

[02:42:45] Everybody, everybody, come take my hand, come take my walk.

[02:42:50] This rope together through the storm, whatever weather, cold the wall.

[02:42:56] Send you know that you're not alone.

[02:42:59] I'll look at you, feel like you're the same.

[02:43:02] Say, you lose your shit and cut the crap.

[02:43:04] I should have run, run, run, run, run, run.

[02:43:06] For you to know it was a hard beat, say, you was king.

[02:43:08] You lied through your teeth, but I'd fuck your feelings.

[02:43:11] Instead of getting crowned, you're getting cat into the pants.

[02:43:14] I never let you down, I can't unpack.

[02:43:16] I promise to never go back on that promise.

[02:43:18] In fact, let's be honest, let's be last.

[02:43:20] B-lap CD was aired, perhaps I ran to Maxons into the ground.

[02:43:24] B-lap time going back to that now.

[02:43:27] All I'm trying to say is get back, put back, clap.

[02:43:29] Cause I ain't playing around.

[02:43:31] It's a game called circle, and I don't know how.

[02:43:33] I'm way too much to back down.

[02:43:35] But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out.

[02:43:37] Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't.

[02:43:39] This fucking black clouds devolves me around.

[02:43:42] But it's time to exercise.

[02:43:43] These demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping checks.

[02:43:46] Now I'm free, I'm not afraid to take a step.

[02:43:50] Take a step, everybody, everybody.

[02:43:54] Come take my hand, come take my walk.

[02:43:57] This broke together through the storm.

[02:44:00] Whatever weather, hold the wall.

[02:44:03] Send me know that you cannot alone.

[02:44:06] I'll look at you, feel like you've been down the same road.

[02:44:10] Yo, what's up, this is the amount of damage that keeps me from going on.

[02:44:13] It's way, so starting today, I'm breaking out of this cave.

[02:44:19] I'm standing up, I'm face my team, I'm manning up.

[02:44:24] Oh my god, I'm panning up.

[02:44:26] Now I'm so fed up.

[02:44:28] Time to put my life back together right now.

[02:44:31] It was my decision to get clean.

[02:44:33] I take it from me.

[02:44:34] Admittedly, I probably did it's a preliminary for you.

[02:44:37] So I could come back, I pray to me you have seen me through.

[02:44:40] And don't even realize what you take.

[02:44:42] Believe me, you, I've been through the rain up.

[02:44:44] But they could do little to the middle finger.

[02:44:46] I think I got a tear in my eye.

[02:44:48] I feel like the king of my world.

[02:44:50] Hades can make like bees when those thing is in drop.

[02:44:52] Yeah, no more beef, flingers, no more drummers.

[02:44:54] From now on, I want to promise to focus on me on handling my responsibilities.

[02:44:58] It's the father, so I solemnly swear to always treat this route.

[02:45:01] Like my daughter's in brazen.

[02:45:03] You couldn't lift a single single on it.

[02:45:05] Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club, put a corner park.

[02:45:08] And lift the whole liquor counter up.

[02:45:10] Cause I'm raising the ball.

[02:45:12] I'm super the moon, but I'm too busy gazing at stars.

[02:45:14] I feel amazing.

[02:45:15] I'm not afraid.

[02:45:16] I'm not afraid.

[02:45:17] Do you take a step?

[02:45:19] Do you take a step?

[02:45:21] Everybody!

[02:45:22] Everybody!

[02:45:23] Come take my hand, come take my walk.

[02:45:26] It's broke together through the snow.

[02:45:29] Go grab the, go go go go go go.

[02:45:32] Go show it, it's shiver.

[02:45:34] Okay, we don't party like it's shiver.

[02:45:37] Take me on a simple party like it's shiver.

[02:45:40] And you know we don't give a fuck.

[02:45:42] Cause I feel bad, you're finding a new world.

[02:45:44] Not a full of bull, but mine, I got things.

[02:45:46] So be on the ticket, drugs.

[02:46:09] Niggas, that I fuck the train.

[02:46:10] I didn't want to show me love.

[02:46:12] When you sound like a man in my mouth, they want a rope.

[02:46:14] The only eight, nine, you change.

[02:46:16] Hold down, geez.

[02:46:17] Up, I see a gibbet in the car.

[02:46:18] And you go fall out, weed up.

[02:46:20] Rope and ride time, move in and stick before I play a pill.

[03:15:40] Who would dance on the floor in the round?

[03:15:44] She said I am the one

[03:15:48] Who would dance on the floor in the round?

[03:15:52] She told me her name could be a gene

[03:15:57] As she calls to sing

[03:15:59] Then have you heard the eyes to dream of being the one?

[03:16:03] Who would dance on the floor in the round?

[03:16:07] She told me her name could be a gene

[03:16:08] As she calls to sing

[03:16:09] Then have you heard the eyes to dream of being the one?

[03:16:11] Who would dance on the floor in the round?

[03:16:13] If I always told me

[03:16:15] Be gathered what you do

[03:16:17] I don't go around rigging young girls' hearts

[03:16:21] And I'd rather always told me

[03:16:25] I'd be gathered what you do

[03:16:27] I'd be gathered what you do

[03:16:29] I'd be a gene

[03:16:32] That might love

[03:16:34] She just said girl, but that I am the one

[03:16:39] But the kid doesn't run by the sun

[03:16:44] She says I am the one

[03:16:47] But the kid doesn't run by the sun

[03:16:51] You know, you know, you need me

[03:16:54] Before the days and before the night

[03:16:57] I was on the side

[03:17:02] And see them but landings

[03:17:04] Go and dance, I'm gonna blow it around

[03:17:09] Something might throw your voice

[03:17:12] Just remember to always stay twice

[03:17:16] Don't think twice

[03:17:19] Shit, so my baby, there's two, three

[03:17:22] But you look at me and then you look at me

[03:17:25] Maybe pride and fight wouldn't like mine

[03:17:28] Go and dance, I'm gonna blow it around me

[03:17:35] I think what always told me, be careful what you do

[03:17:39] Don't go around bringing young girls' hearts

[03:17:42] Don't ring me, please

[03:17:44] But she came and stood right behind me

[03:17:45] Because I smell as weep of you

[03:17:47] I can't say I'm gonna blow it around

[03:17:49] I see you fall in the water

[03:17:51] And see the bad things that my love

[03:17:56] She just forget her, goodnight, I don't want to

[03:18:01] But the kid doesn't run by the sun

[03:18:09] She just forget her, goodnight, I don't want to

[03:18:18] She just forget her, goodnight, I don't want to

[03:49:47] Glistening to the sound of my teeth

[03:49:51] Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all years to come by

[03:49:57] Every now and then I get a little bit scared

[03:50:01] And cry to them and I see the little senior eyes

[03:50:29] And we're lonely making it right

[03:50:33] Cause we'll never be loved

[03:50:35] What's the point of time I was falling in love

[03:50:39] Now I'm only falling apart

[03:50:41] There's nothing I can do that's all I can do is to go home

[03:50:49] Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be

[03:51:11] Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy you want it be with

[03:51:17] Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe

[03:51:23] Might get cold or won't just use you

[03:51:25] Every now and then I know there's nothing any better

[03:51:29] There's nothing that I just wouldn't do

[03:51:33] Every now and then I fall apart

[03:51:39] Every now and then I fall apart

[03:51:43] And I need you now tonight

[03:51:57] And we're lonely making it right

[03:52:01] Cause we'll never be loved

[03:52:03] Together we can take it to the end of the line

[03:52:07] Your love is like a shadow on the other side

[03:52:11] I don't know what to do

[03:52:13] I know we're in the dark

[03:52:15] But never get a part of it

[03:52:17] And give it up for

[03:52:19] I really need you tonight

[03:52:21] We're never gonna start tonight

[03:52:25] We're never gonna start tonight

[03:52:29] Now I'm only falling apart

[03:52:33] Nothing I can do

[03:52:35] I totally clipped to the heart

[03:52:39] Once upon a time there was light in my life

[03:52:43] Now there's only love in the dark

[03:52:45] Nothing I can say

[03:52:47] I totally clipped to the heart

[03:53:03] And I need you tonight

[03:53:33] Show me, show me, show me

[03:53:43] How you do that trick

[03:53:45] The woman makes me scream

[03:53:47] She said

[03:53:49] The woman makes me love to say

[03:53:51] Through her arms around my neck

[03:53:55] Show me how you do it

[03:53:57] I don't promise you

[03:53:59] I promise that I'll run away

[03:54:01] I'll run away with you

[03:54:03] I'll run away with you

[03:54:31] Speeding all that to the end

[03:54:37] Kiss the face and kiss the neck

[03:54:39] You're dreaming of all the two few ways

[03:54:43] I had to make a promise

[03:54:45] Why are you so far away

[03:54:49] She said

[03:54:51] I want you ever

[03:54:53] I can love with you

[03:54:55] That I'm in love with you

[03:54:57] You know, softer only you

[03:57:01] I've never been lucky in love

[03:57:04] My defenses are down, the kiss are a frown

[03:57:08] The kiss is a vibe on my own

[03:57:15] If the bear walks in and calls her name in my heart

[03:57:19] I'll turn around and wipe

[03:57:23] Every day we're going light up straight

[03:57:27] It's hard to be lucky in love

[03:57:30] If the kiss in your eyes

[03:57:32] It's making you cry down

[04:00:46] And so we're running through the smashes we can

[04:00:50] Pull it onto one another and try to get away

[04:00:56] Into the night

[04:19:06] And I know she'll be the death of me

[04:19:08] At least we'll both be now

[04:19:10] And she'll always get the best of me

[04:19:13] The worst is yet to come

[04:19:15] But at least we'll both be beautiful

[04:19:17] And stay forever young

[04:19:19] This I know

[04:19:21] This I know

[04:19:23] She told me don't worry about it

[04:19:27] She told me don't worry no more

[04:19:31] We both know we can't go

[04:19:34] Without it

[04:19:36] She told me you'll never be alone

[04:19:40] I can feel my face well over you

[04:19:45] But I love it

[04:19:47] Oh I can feel my face well over you

[04:19:53] But I love it

[04:19:55] But I love it

[04:19:57] Oh I know she'll be the death of me

[04:20:01] At least we'll both be enough

[04:20:03] And she'll always get the best of me

[04:20:05] The worst is yet to come

[04:20:07] All the misery

[04:20:09] But at least we'll both be beautiful

[04:20:11] And stay forever young

[04:20:13] This I know

[04:20:15] She told me don't worry about it

[04:20:20] She told me don't worry no more

[04:20:24] We both know we can't go

[04:20:27] Without it

[04:20:29] She told me you'll never be alone

[04:20:33] I can feel my face well over you

[04:20:38] But I love it

[04:20:40] But I love it

[04:20:42] Oh I can feel my face well off you

[04:20:46] But I love it

[04:20:49] But I love it

[04:20:51] I can feel my face well and I love with you

[04:20:56] But I love it

[04:20:58] But I love it

[04:21:00] But I love it

[04:21:02] But I love it

[04:21:05] But I love it

[04:21:09] She told me don't be about it, she told me don't be about it, no more

[04:21:26] We both know we can't go without it, she told me you'll never be alone

[04:21:40] I can't feel my face when I'm living in my face, what I love is what I love is...

[04:21:46] I can't feel my face when I'm living in your face, what I love is...

[04:21:54] I can't feel my face without you

[04:22:00] What I love is I can't feel my face without you

[04:22:08] I can't feel my face without you

[04:22:10] It's got to be my love

[04:22:24] I can't feel my face without you
