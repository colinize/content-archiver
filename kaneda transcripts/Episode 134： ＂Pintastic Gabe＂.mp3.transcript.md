[00:00] Welcome to episode 134 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] I'm going to be back to my right, is Bubba the Bulldog.

[00:27] In the used to be arcade is Brenda Sleeping.

[00:30] It is Sunday night.

[00:31] It's a little bit past 11.

[00:33] And I wanted to get up and interview I just did with Gabe.

[00:38] Gabe runs Fantastic.

[00:41] And Fantastic is one of the probably the only real Northeast pinball show that takes place

[00:48] each year.

[00:49] It's coming up in two weeks.

[00:50] So we're going to talk all about that show, what people can expect at that show.

[00:55] Before I air that interview with Gabe, just a little news updates that I want to sort of

[01:00] go down quickly.

[01:02] First news update is this.

[01:04] Our friend, Rare Hero Greg, is out of the Big Lebowski.

[01:09] He found someone to take his spot.

[01:12] He won't tell me who that fool was that took the spot, but I'm glad that his pain in

[01:17] suffering is finally over.

[01:20] And one of the reasons he gave me for bailing out, not just because he's so sick of all the

[01:25] DPBS that he's had to put up with over the years, he's also really nervous that if he gets

[01:32] a big Lebowski, what he would do with spare parts, and he doesn't want to have a broken

[01:36] machine down the road.

[01:39] And he's listened to me tell him all the time how frustrating it is to have a magic girl

[01:45] that doesn't really work.

[01:47] If you have a Lebowski down the road and all of a sudden your rug stops working or your

[01:52] bowling alley.

[01:53] All right, no, it's no fun.

[01:54] It is absolutely no fun even having one switch being out on a pinball machine turns that

[02:00] machine into a 300 pound paperweight.

[02:04] So and with no customer service and no support in the long run, these new companies, they

[02:10] make you nervous to invest in if you don't feel like there's going to be support down

[02:14] the road.

[02:16] What else is going on in pinball?

[02:18] There is a Batman super Ellie on eBay.

[02:21] It's sort of like tucked away and hidden inside the eBay pinball sort of world.

[02:27] But if you search for pinball, there is a Batman super Ellie.

[02:32] It has three bids so far all the way up to $9900.

[02:38] Really interesting to see what this thing sells for on eBay.

[02:42] There's seven days to go in the auction.

[02:44] But I think this is our first ever Batman super Ellie for sale on a public site like eBay.

[02:51] So I always love that because it means we can track and see if the hype has died on that

[02:57] game or if it's going to go for a little bit more than $15,000.

[03:02] My hunch is I think that game sells for 12 to 13,000.

[03:08] I don't think it's going to stay at $15,000.

[03:11] Especially now that more people have played it and Batman 66 continues to sort of struggle

[03:18] to be seen as a great game.

[03:20] People are impatient with the code updates on that.

[03:23] What else still no Star Wars news?

[03:25] I wish I was seeing gameplay footage of a premium or even I'll take a pro at this point.

[03:31] We just have to wait.

[03:33] The wait continues.

[03:34] I continue to be somewhat disappointed.

[03:39] But at the end of the day, it is what it is.

[03:41] At least we're getting a Star Wars pinball machine versus no Star Wars pinball machine.

[03:45] So I'm trying to look at it like that.

[03:49] And I keep in my head and Gabe and I talk about this.

[03:53] I keep trying to go back and forth with is the value there, is the value there.

[03:58] And I think with all non-essential items, it's so impossible.

[04:02] And to ever come to a definitive sort of factual statement that the value is there.

[04:10] And I want to take you down another sort of area where people spend lots of money on

[04:16] things that are non-essential.

[04:18] And that's the world of fashion.

[04:20] And in example, today, Brenda and I, we went to Gucci on Fifth Avenue.

[04:26] Gucci is located inside Trump Tower.

[04:29] But it's Gucci.

[04:30] Everyone knows Gucci.

[04:32] And we were just sort of trying on some clothes for fun and for shits and giggles.

[04:36] I just needed to get some new shoes and we got sidetracked.

[04:40] We went upstairs and Brenda put on this coat.

[04:43] If you Google search Gucci, it looks like a jellyfish jacket.

[04:51] Type in jellyfish coat.

[04:52] There's like a runway of it.

[04:54] It's kind of like got blue and purple and like pinks.

[04:57] And it almost looks like a jellyfish's tentacles are coming from the coat itself.

[05:03] So she puts it on.

[05:04] She looks fabulous and Brenda's gorgeous.

[05:06] She looks amazing.

[05:07] She looks like she was coming down a Paris runway.

[05:10] So I ask her, say, babe, how much is that coat?

[05:12] She turns to me and she says, this coat cost more than your car.

[05:17] And I'm like, get the F out of here, no way.

[05:20] The coat is $65,000.

[05:24] Okay?

[05:25] $65,000.

[05:26] So next time we want to get in big arguments on pin-side and yell at each other about

[05:32] pinball prices and whatnot.

[05:35] Just remember that in other areas out there in the world of non-essential items that are

[05:41] supposed to bring people happiness, you could look at it like pinballs of bargain or you

[05:47] could look at it like pinballs super overpriced if video games are your thing in each video game

[05:51] cost $50.

[05:53] I guess my point is we spend so much time on this podcast trying to make points.

[05:59] We spend so much time on pin-side or you guys do trying to make points, right?

[06:05] Get your point across.

[06:06] And we're always like trying to come to this place where we feel like we've found some

[06:12] truth in what we're all doing here.

[06:15] But the more and more I look at this stuff and zoom out a little bit and look at the

[06:19] world around pinball, the more I realize there is no point.

[06:24] There is no reason for any of this.

[06:26] There is no need for pinball in the world.

[06:29] There is nothing of value to be gained or lost.

[06:34] All there is.

[06:35] All there is.

[06:36] Is an attempt at bringing us some joy and some happiness, right?

[06:41] These items are meant just to make us have fun.

[06:45] And if someone's having fun with WWE, then that's great.

[06:51] And what's the point of telling that guy he's an idiot or he's a fool or he's a moron

[06:56] and he doesn't know what he's talking about, that game sucks.

[06:59] There's so much fighting and I realize too, it's like the same 50 people all the time

[07:05] that drag the hobby down into these places that just are pointless because there is no

[07:11] point to be made that really matters.

[07:14] In any of this, that being said, I'm happy that a thousand of you listen to this podcast

[07:20] for my points about pinball that it's just fun, right?

[07:24] I hope this is entertaining for all of you.

[07:27] It's entertaining to do it.

[07:29] It's entertaining to go to shows and hang out with you guys.

[07:33] I was laughing when I read Andrew Highway's sort of give-by letter to the pinball world.

[07:40] And I'll say why?

[07:41] I wish Andrew the best of luck.

[07:43] I'm collabed at Andrew is stepping aside.

[07:46] I think it's time that new people run the pinball company that is called Highway Pinball.

[07:51] The thing that I laugh about is that even in the end, even in the end, the approach is

[07:56] still that sort of, I had a dream, I had a dream to make a pinball machine.

[08:04] I love pinball.

[08:05] We accomplished that dream with alien pinball and I hope to see you again one day.

[08:12] It's like this sort of walking off.

[08:15] My hands are clean, goodbye kind of.

[08:18] Instead of, I'm sorry for taking your money, driving this company into the ground and

[08:25] continuously lying to you about the state of the company.

[08:30] And that's the part that I just don't think you should be able to walk away with, hey,

[08:34] I love pinball and I tried and it was my dream and I think we accomplished a great game.

[08:40] Sure, there's that part of the story but the other part that I don't think is so easily

[08:46] forgivable are all the lies that you guys got.

[08:49] And I still think to this day, pinball people out there, for some reason you just were okay

[08:55] with the amount of lies that Andrew was feeding all of you and yet Barry and Yap give you

[09:02] one lie or two lies and they're like, you guys are like, you hate those two.

[09:07] I mean, they have no love where Andrew gets so much forgiveness.

[09:12] So look, when this podcast goes up tonight, by tomorrow night, Yap and Barry will have

[09:20] done their seminar live cast or why don't know what they're doing.

[09:25] I don't know what channel it's on, I don't know when.

[09:28] They haven't really given the details, right?

[09:30] And that's got a lot of people really pissed off too because why can't people know when

[09:37] where and how you're going to do this?

[09:40] This whole thing, still being secretive up until the day of the actual thing, again, leads

[09:47] me to believe they haven't really thought this through and I don't know.

[09:52] I don't think it's going to go great for them.

[09:55] And I think that people who are in El La Bousque are in for a really long ride.

[10:00] But I'm curious to see what they say.

[10:01] I'm curious to see how many details they provide people.

[10:05] I'm curious what questions they are going to read out loud.

[10:10] I wonder if they're going to be these softball questions.

[10:13] I love it when, remember when there was the debates and it's like these emails came in

[10:16] for Hillary and Donald.

[10:18] And I remember one question in particular, it's like, Hillary, how did you become so inspirational

[10:24] to people?

[10:25] I was like, what?

[10:26] Really?

[10:27] That's the question the reporter asked.

[10:29] I'm like, Barry and Yacht, how did you build the greatest Pimball machine ever?

[10:33] I hope, no, it's not going to be stuff like that.

[10:36] But anyway, let me air this interview with Gabe.

[10:40] It's, you're going to hear Gabe walking around a little bit at times because he was moving

[10:44] through his house.

[10:46] He was doing it over his phone.

[10:47] So I'm sorry if the audio quality isn't the best.

[10:50] I always try to encourage people to do it on a computer and have a headset.

[10:57] That's where we get the best audio.

[10:59] But we had a good chat.

[11:00] I hope you guys attend PimTastic if you can.

[11:04] I will not be going this year.

[11:07] Last minute trip to Vegas has taken over my calendar.

[11:11] So that is where I will be.

[11:13] Partying in Vegas where you guys are playing Pimball in New England.

[11:17] So without further ado, let me give you Gabe.

[11:19] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Pimball podcast, a special

[11:24] guest.

[11:25] Gabe?

[11:26] Gabe Denonzeo.

[11:27] Did I get that right, Gabe?

[11:29] Yes, you did.

[11:30] All right.

[11:31] And Gabe has been coming up to me for a long time talking about PimTastic.

[11:37] I think we've known each other over a year.

[11:40] So we're excited to sort of talk about the show, which is just around the corner, right?

[11:43] So Gabe, for those people out there who don't know anything about PimTastic, give us the

[11:47] elevator speech for what the show is all about.

[11:52] The show is a Pimball Expo and Gamer Expo July 6th, 7th and 8th.

[11:58] It's come up in two and a half weeks.

[12:01] And it's basically, if you cross Texas and Expo, the two of them, that's what I kind of,

[12:08] and then Alan and Tom, it's the three things that all the best of all three shows, I think.

[12:14] I try to put them together like that and give everybody a little bit of everything.

[12:20] Plus, you know, a lot of free kids entertainment for families and to bring new people into

[12:27] the hobby.

[12:28] I brought in the kids element and the sponsorship element from local sponsorship and all that

[12:33] good stuff.

[12:34] Right.

[12:35] So, okay.

[12:36] So it's in Boston, right?

[12:37] So let's talk about where it's at.

[12:38] Because...

[12:39] Well, it's in Sturbridge.

[12:40] In Sturbridge, so it's right over the Connecticut border, about 15 minutes over the Connecticut

[12:45] border.

[12:46] So it's good for people from New York and New Jersey, you know, all those people come up

[12:52] to Pennsylvania and we get people from Boston and Canada.

[12:56] It's a good central location, right?

[12:58] And we're three major highways meet right there in Sturbridge.

[13:02] Okay.

[13:03] Nice little town.

[13:04] All right.

[13:05] So, and now you say you're taking the best elements from T.P.F., Expo and Alan Town.

[13:09] Now let's go down those three.

[13:10] So what would you say are the...

[13:12] What's the best element of Texas Pimball Festival?

[13:17] Texas is more...

[13:18] I think it's like a collector.

[13:19] It's more of a collector's show, so I've tried to bring in a lot of the collectors to

[13:24] help me mold the show and to give them something.

[13:28] Like we have a best-in-show contest, similar to Texas.

[13:32] We have a lot of nice games that come to the show.

[13:38] I bring a lot of nice games, all modified games.

[13:42] We try and...

[13:43] Texas is...

[13:45] I think is one of the best shows in the country right now.

[13:48] So I...

[13:49] In Texas, I know I had everything.

[13:52] They have a lot of games or so.

[13:53] They have a lot of Pimball there, right?

[13:54] So, like...

[13:56] There's like no arcade games at Texas.

[13:58] So how many Pimball Machines will be at Pintastic?

[14:03] This is around 200 total Pimball Machines in around 40 video games and then we have a gaming...

[14:11] console gaming area as well.

[14:16] And like Alan Town, there are almost a lot of the games are for sale and we have a lot

[14:21] of vendors.

[14:23] Any other shows in the country don't have as many vendors.

[14:26] Alan Town has tons of vendors.

[14:27] So I want to bring all the vendors in.

[14:29] So we have 65...

[14:31] We have 65 vendor spots and the...

[14:35] The vendor hall has been sold out for two months.

[14:37] That room has all been sold out.

[14:38] So there are a lot of vendors.

[14:40] It's probably...

[14:43] I think it was like 20...

[14:44] 28, 29 total vendors.

[14:48] Okay.

[14:49] Yeah, that's...

[14:50] That's a lot.

[14:51] So that's good.

[14:52] So there's...

[14:53] Because there's not too many vendors at T-PF.

[14:56] You're right.

[14:57] It's more like...

[14:58] A lot of like the collectors are there, a lot of the new games are there.

[15:01] There's a lot of seminars.

[15:03] So you also have seminars going...

[15:05] Gabor, who's like the special guest for the Pimball people listening to this show that

[15:09] are thinking about making the trip?

[15:11] We have a seminar hall with a stadium seating and lounge chairs and it's a hold to about

[15:16] 100 people.

[15:19] We have...

[15:20] We're flying in David Thiel.

[15:21] We're flying in Barry Als-Ausler and we're...

[15:24] Zombie Eddie is going to be there.

[15:27] He's going to be...

[15:28] He did the t-shirt this year in the poster and he's going to be signing all that stuff.

[15:31] He had special stickers made.

[15:34] I actually made a translate of it and I'm also selling it through really cool.

[15:38] And we have a Lyman Sheets is going to be there.

[15:40] He won the tournament last year.

[15:42] He's going to be there walking around and tournament.

[15:45] He doesn't do a seminar because he doesn't do seminars.

[15:46] But he talks to people and hangs out and we have a...

[15:52] Other than that we have...

[15:55] Those are the main...

[15:56] I guess we got Jack of course, we got Butch Peel coming and who lost his coming?

[16:02] We got...

[16:03] I'm forgetting somebody but I'm sure I'll think of them in a little bit.

[16:07] Now for those of you who haven't seen the Zombie Eddie poster he did is incredible for

[16:14] fantastic.

[16:15] He's making a translate of that image.

[16:18] I made a translate and I have sold about six of them so far.

[16:23] I have nine of them for sale.

[16:24] They're 100 bucks each.

[16:26] Okay.

[16:27] So we're...

[16:28] We're can someone buy one right now if they want to.

[16:32] They can message me.

[16:34] They can't really go.

[16:35] Nothing.

[16:36] The online store will open after the show.

[16:37] So everybody gets first dibs at everything at the show, shirts and all this.

[16:42] The trans lights and the posters and everything like that.

[16:45] We appear glasses this year and stuff.

[16:47] Are there going to be more than nine of these trans lights available once the show opens?

[16:51] Yeah.

[16:52] I mean if I can order them.

[16:54] I can order them and ship them to people if people want them.

[16:57] They can send me messages and all.

[16:59] Okay.

[17:00] Just want to make sure it's also like a limited thing that there's only going to be ten

[17:03] and you got to...

[17:04] No.

[17:05] You got to go get.

[17:06] No.

[17:07] Maybe I should limit them right?

[17:10] I mean, 2000 or something.

[17:12] That's not limited.

[17:13] I mean, I'm thinking more like a hundred.

[17:16] Well, that's cool.

[17:17] So in terms of...

[17:19] You got Jack coming there.

[17:21] What are going to be the...

[17:22] Out of the new games?

[17:23] Because I think most of my listeners are all about the new products hitting shelves.

[17:28] What new games are going to be there?

[17:30] Well, I think we're going to have three or four dialed ins there.

[17:36] Production, multi-market game will be there.

[17:39] I just found out about that a couple days ago.

[17:45] There's going to...

[17:46] I mean, I'm trying to get Star Wars.

[17:47] We'll see where my distributor automated services is going to have a booth in the vendor

[17:54] hall and he's going to have 14 of the...

[17:56] All the new stirons.

[17:57] You know, all...

[17:58] You know, Errol Smith and everything...

[18:00] Everything's stirons and everything's Jersey Jack.

[18:01] He's going to have their all new stuff.

[18:03] He's going to have the...

[18:04] You know, the remakes.

[18:06] He's going to have an attack from Mars and the medieval madness.

[18:09] All that.

[18:10] His booths.

[18:11] He's one of the biggest distributors for it is Sterns and he is the biggest Jersey Jack

[18:15] distributor.

[18:16] Okay.

[18:17] And so Star Wars...

[18:18] Now, we know Star Wars is on the line because we saw Stern post a Facebook Live video,

[18:22] but they're not shipping yet, right?

[18:24] And the first ones usually go overseas.

[18:27] So it's cut in a close.

[18:28] Are you sort of just kind of fingers crossed, hoping that the biggest distributor...

[18:34] I mean, I just...

[18:35] Pulls weight and get one.

[18:37] I mean, that's part of it and I've sent emails to my contacts at Sterns as well to hopefully

[18:43] that they'll get back to me.

[18:45] I've met...

[18:46] You know, I've been doing the show.

[18:47] I've met a lot of designers and people involved with Sterns.

[18:50] So...

[18:51] Usually they can help me get something like that done, but...

[18:53] Okay.

[18:54] You know, it's all lucky, you know, of the draw because, you know, last year was the Ghost

[19:00] Busters and it came out a month before.

[19:02] So all the shows in June got the first...

[19:04] So to see the game first.

[19:05] So they missed...

[19:06] You know, it came out a month later and so that we're scheduled to be the next show.

[19:12] So, you know, I wouldn't see why it wouldn't...

[19:14] There wouldn't be a pro there.

[19:15] I mean, I'm hoping that there should be, you know.

[19:18] Right, right.

[19:19] And so what about Houdini?

[19:20] Houdini gonna be a fantastic?

[19:21] No, Houdini won't be there.

[19:23] I tried to get them there, but they only did so many shows this year and they're now...

[19:28] They're focusing on production and getting things aligned up.

[19:31] So...

[19:32] Okay.

[19:33] Next year, I'm sure it'll be there, but...

[19:34] How about a total annihilation or nuclear annihilation?

[19:40] Scott bringing it up.

[19:41] No, I thought this...

[19:43] I mean, he's only doing a few shows this year bringing the game to it until it's in production.

[19:48] So...

[19:49] Is far away for him to come, you know.

[19:50] Is spooky...

[19:51] Are they coming to the show as a vendor or a manufacturer?

[19:56] No, they're not.

[19:57] Spooky...

[19:58] They're kind of...

[20:00] They do...

[20:02] They have things going on in the month of July.

[20:05] They have a lot of the couple different like a Godzilla show they go to every year,

[20:08] right around the time of my show.

[20:09] So...

[20:10] Eventually...

[20:11] You get bumped for a Godzilla show.

[20:12] I didn't even realize it was such a thing.

[20:14] I know he's...

[20:15] They're wicked, you know, they're wicked into that.

[20:17] Right.

[20:18] So there's a Godzilla...

[20:20] There's conventions for everything in America.

[20:22] You name it.

[20:23] There's like...

[20:25] There's probably beckoning cat conventions that take place somewhere in America on Sunday.

[20:29] Yeah, we usually end up with the couple, you know, the spooky games that are in production already.

[20:34] So those are most likely to be at the show.

[20:37] Okay.

[20:38] I'm trying to think what else.

[20:39] So Attack from Mars Remake will be their medieval ministry make.

[20:43] Anything else that's...

[20:45] You'll definitely have some arousments there.

[20:47] Okay, so there's like all the new stuff that's there.

[20:49] And now, what is it?

[20:50] Is it 20 bucks to get in and then free play for the day?

[20:52] How do you guys do the entrance and the...

[20:56] Yeah, well, we have a three day VIP pass, which is the best...

[21:00] The best bang for your buckets.

[21:02] All three days, you get in and out, you get in and out early to all the rooms, you get...

[21:09] You get into the after party.

[21:10] We have an after party on Friday night at nine o'clock and...

[21:15] You know, I buy 2,000 dollars for the food to feed everybody and all the vendors that get to go to that.

[21:20] Because the vendor hall closes at nine and they all go there and everybody hangs out.

[21:24] But all the speakers are all walking around and they're all sitting down and talking to everybody.

[21:28] So that's one thing I do for everybody.

[21:32] And that three day VIP pass is $85 and you get a free T-shirt.

[21:38] Is it on the VIT T-shirt with that?

[21:40] You get a Zonviyadi poster, you get a limited edition keychain as well.

[21:44] Okay.

[21:45] So...

[21:46] Wow, you're regular day-packs.

[21:47] You get a lot for that.

[21:48] And you're also getting food for free.

[21:50] It sounds like.

[21:51] Yeah.

[21:52] And you get into the VIP lounge too.

[21:55] The VIP lounge is the...

[21:56] With this year's the new thing we're doing, it's in all night room.

[21:59] It's open.

[22:00] It opens at eight o'clock, eight o'clock to six in the morning on Thursday,

[22:05] 10 p.m. to six in the morning on Friday, 10 p.m. to six in the morning on Saturday.

[22:10] Okay.

[22:11] So there's a room open.

[22:13] It's like a suite from 10 at night to six in the morning.

[22:17] Yeah, there's going to be 14 games in there.

[22:19] 12 to 14 games.

[22:20] They're all going to be my games, which are, you know, $90,000 worth of Pima machines.

[22:26] And the dialed-in will probably be in there.

[22:27] All my modified games from my collection will be in that room.

[22:30] So this is like for the late night, sort of like the Lebowski party kind of thing where

[22:36] like we're going to, after the show closes down, you can play Pimbal literally all night long

[22:41] in your...

[22:42] So how are you going to get sleep?

[22:44] Are you going to be watching people play these games that are valuable?

[22:46] No, I have a security guard there watching for a party.

[22:50] You have to have a lane you're in, bash to get in.

[22:52] So he's going to be watching for that.

[22:53] Okay.

[22:54] And this is in the hotel game that fantastic is next to our hotel.

[22:58] Yeah, it's in a hotel.

[22:59] Okay.

[23:00] No, it's inside the whole thing's in a big hotel.

[23:02] It's about 25,000 square feet, the whole show.

[23:05] And it's, you know, we bring in craft beer.

[23:09] So I struck a deal with a craft beer.

[23:12] Local craft beer is going to be two craft beers.

[23:15] You want a IPA and want a regular logger, one of the $5 and one $6.

[23:22] And then, you know, this year we're bringing in promo girls to sell t-shirts and to take

[23:28] pictures with people with guys or whatever.

[23:31] And if people ask for it, so I brought them in, you know, I'm going to have two girls there

[23:35] that are going to be hanging out.

[23:36] I mean, it doesn't surprise me that Pimbal guys are asking, bring in some girls because

[23:43] it's usually the one thing there's a shortage of it, Pimbal shows.

[23:46] Yeah, I mean, you know, you know, T.P.F. has the luxury of, you know, the place right there

[23:53] tilting, tilting, tilting, tilting.

[23:55] Not, it's got, what is it called?

[23:58] Oh my God, were the girls are wearing like body pain and lucky strike is it something

[24:03] like that or something?

[24:04] I don't know.

[24:05] Well, there's something like that.

[24:06] I kind of bring in a net element.

[24:07] You know, they can take pictures with the girls and they can, you know, they can, you

[24:11] know, buy T-shirts at late night and buy merchandise, buy beer glasses.

[24:16] But, you know, they're going to try and buy the girls these guys after, you know, 12

[24:21] hours of Pimbal.

[24:22] So, is this, is this like a rumor?

[24:23] Is it like a separate air?

[24:24] Because I'm thinking like, is it, it's, it's, it's, it's actually, the VIP lounge, it's,

[24:29] it's actually like a suite in the hotel or is it like on the ground level that's like

[24:32] a separate room like, like area?

[24:34] No, it's right across from the semi-room.

[24:36] There's another room.

[24:37] All right.

[24:38] There's another room there that's going to be in, it's going to be in.

[24:39] All right.

[24:40] Because we're, you're going to keep the hotel up all night with these guys now.

[24:43] All right.

[24:44] That's cool.

[24:45] That's, that's definitely a neat feature.

[24:48] Is there a limited number of these VIP passes that are available?

[24:51] Yeah.

[24:52] 100.

[24:53] Only 100.

[24:54] We're, we're going, you're getting close to 100 now.

[24:55] So, okay.

[24:56] So, listen to the show.

[24:57] If you're, if you're headed up there and you want to party all night long with, with

[25:00] these awesome machines and, and some hot chicks, it sounds like, you might want to move

[25:06] fast and securing those VIP passes.

[25:09] So, Gabe, talk to me about when you, like when you just got the idea that you wanted

[25:13] to do a pinball show.

[25:16] You know, there, there was a lot of talk in this, in this community about, we should have

[25:21] a show, we, you know, New England needs a show and, uh, nobody wanted to step up and people

[25:27] tried to, tried to step up and they figured, you know, it's too much money.

[25:30] It's going to, it's, we're not getting, I'm going to lose my shirt or whatever.

[25:33] And, I, I'm very close with, uh, Ivan, a downtown.

[25:37] So, I talked to him about it and he told me, you know, uh, summertime show, probably

[25:41] not a good idea, but you can try it.

[25:43] And so, I said, what the hell?

[25:45] I'm going to go for it, you know, and, uh, me and a partner put it together originally.

[25:49] And, and the first year we, uh, we lost money, you know, but it was, it was a good turnout.

[25:53] It was, it was a great show.

[25:55] And, everybody loved it.

[25:56] So, I, my, my partner dropped out the second year, but I did it on my own and, and I brought

[26:01] in a lot of, uh, the collector community in this area to help me as, as, as just as, you

[26:06] know, volunteering to do take over sections of the show and it's, it's very worked very

[26:11] well.

[26:12] I mean, we have people, if you go on our website, we have about 10 people that are, help

[26:16] that a part of the show that helping out.

[26:18] Yeah.

[26:19] What, what year was year one?

[26:21] 2015.

[26:22] Okay.

[26:23] So, this is the third year.

[26:24] Yeah.

[26:25] Okay.

[26:26] All right.

[26:27] So, this is a pretty brand new sort of pinball show and how many people did you, you

[26:32] know, attend it in the, in the first two years?

[26:35] Is it a big turnout for fantastic?

[26:36] Yeah.

[26:37] First year was like 12,000 second year is 1600.

[26:41] This year we've had about 40% increase in ticket sales already.

[26:45] So, it's, it's growing quickly.

[26:46] All right.

[26:47] Good.

[26:48] So, we're hoping to get profitable.

[26:49] Is that we're going to?

[26:51] Yeah.

[26:52] Last year we broke a broke even this year.

[26:53] We're going to be profitable.

[26:54] Yeah.

[26:55] That's just about sold out.

[26:56] We've probably got about 10 rooms left per night.

[26:58] I mean, I'm like, 75 rooms already booked.

[27:03] It sounds like what people are getting for the money is like, you know, the food, the

[27:06] t-shirts, all for 60 bucks.

[27:08] Is that what you, right?

[27:09] No.

[27:10] 85 bucks, you know?

[27:11] No, that's still nothing.

[27:12] Nothing, I went, nothing.

[27:13] No, nothing.

[27:14] I was in Gucci today.

[27:15] There was a $750 t-shirt.

[27:16] I'm like, because on Biedi's design is nicer than this thing.

[27:20] So, the show's in a couple of weeks.

[27:23] Let's talk about, is there anything like else going on to show that you want to call

[27:29] out?

[27:30] Because I think it's interesting too that you do also combine arcade games and do you

[27:34] see like you get a split or is it, I mean, it's called fantastic.

[27:38] So are the majority of people there for the pinball?

[27:40] It sounds like it's more pinball, but the one thing that I do that nobody else does is

[27:45] I bring in the kids up to team.

[27:47] You know, I bring in the clown on the walks around on Stilts and she plays with people

[27:52] and she has fun and then she does juggling.

[27:55] She rides around on a unicycle and then I got a guy doing character artists, you know,

[28:00] like a character artist you pay for, but this guy's free.

[28:03] He's always got a lion, people getting free character artists.

[28:06] He's there about four or five hours Friday, five hours Saturday, and then five hours at

[28:12] night Friday too.

[28:13] Friday night.

[28:14] Okay.

[28:15] So, and then, you know, we got a face painter and we got a lady doing face paintings

[28:20] and lady doing balloon animals for the kids.

[28:24] So people, even adults, a lot of adults get their face painted and everything's free when

[28:27] you get in, everything's free.

[28:29] And we have a guy doing a yo yo trick.

[28:32] He said yo yo champion.

[28:33] And he's going to be doing a Saturday night.

[28:36] He's going to be doing a fire show outside where he, you know, juggles fire and does fire

[28:40] at yo yo show and stuff.

[28:41] It's pretty cool.

[28:42] Wow.

[28:43] I mean, that's a lot of extra stuff.

[28:44] I mean, maybe, but Gabe, it's a, do you think you even need all that stuff for pinball?

[28:48] I mean, I'm just thinking about profit.

[28:51] It's like, you got guys juggling fire and non stilts.

[28:55] Um, how, you know, these guys can be eating into your bottom line.

[28:59] Gabe.

[29:00] I brought, I brought the only way to get people involved that don't know pinball is to bring

[29:06] in the face painters and the, and the clowns.

[29:09] They're like, oh, there's going to be clowns there.

[29:11] There's going to be face painting and, you know, a magician or whatever.

[29:14] Yeah, we'll go to that and then they see the pinball and they'll hold.

[29:17] Wow.

[29:18] I'm going to fall in love with the pinball and then it grows the hobby and it helps me

[29:22] bring in sponsorship, local sponsorship.

[29:24] They don't, you know, I'm having a pinball show with a bunch of, you know, 50 year old guys

[29:28] that are going to be hanging out and can be here.

[29:29] No, we don't want to sponsor that, but we want to sponsor a family event that are going

[29:32] to give me, they'll give me money for that to help me pay for that stuff.

[29:37] You know, that's what happens.

[29:38] I mean, I will, I will be honest.

[29:39] I mean, if someone tells me there's going to be clowns somewhere, there's a good chance.

[29:43] I'll go to wherever that is because I, I enjoy getting my face painted.

[29:49] That's good.

[29:50] I mean, you're coming this year, right?

[29:52] Well, you know, here's the bad news.

[29:54] Like, I'm actually going to be in Vegas now.

[29:57] I got to have to go there for my, my brother's doing a big party thing in Vegas.

[30:03] So I'm going to try and make the last day of the show.

[30:06] It's just going to be tight.

[30:07] I got to see what if I can, I'm juggling all these dates.

[30:09] I know and I, I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to go.

[30:13] I had plans to hang out with Germany, Zambia, and I, oh, it's, it's, it's, it's frustrating

[30:21] me because you're the next to Alan Tal and you're the closest show for me by far.

[30:26] And I'm also surprised, you know, Gabe, that there's no show in, in the New York City

[30:31] area.

[30:32] I think if there's any other place to like on the East Coast where there's a lot of pinball

[30:36] because there's a ton of pinball in this area.

[30:38] There's a ton of pinball players in Long Island and New Jersey.

[30:43] And your show, you know, next to Alan Tal and it is like the closest thing.

[30:46] Yeah.

[30:47] Eventually someone, someone's going to eventually do a show in the New York area.

[30:50] I mean, it's expensive, you know, and it's, you can't just be like a guy that's not

[30:56] deep into the hobby and know everybody and just start a pinball show.

[30:59] It's such a small niche hobby that you got to be friends with all these people.

[31:02] You got to know all these people.

[31:03] And they're not going to help you.

[31:04] They're not going to come to your first show.

[31:06] They're not going to set up under a group for a show.

[31:08] They don't know you.

[31:09] But what do you think if I set up Canada's pinball expo in New York City?

[31:15] Do you think people would come?

[31:18] People would come for the pinball.

[31:19] I mean, what they come for Canada or what?

[31:22] I think I've, there's a little bit of a brain.

[31:25] Right?

[31:26] We're building here.

[31:27] If you can put on a good party, people will come.

[31:29] All right.

[31:30] I'll just get a bunch of girls from scores, some guys on stilts and some jugglers that

[31:34] will have a damn good time.

[31:37] Yeah, I think you're, I think someone will eventually, but I think you're point about

[31:40] it.

[31:41] It is the cost for running a space out in this area is probably cost prohibitive to have

[31:49] a show here.

[31:50] Unless you're going to charge a lot more.

[31:52] The thing too about New York that's interesting gave is there's just so many pinball machines

[31:56] on location here that you like sunshine has all the hot games that they just got dialed

[32:02] in last week.

[32:04] It's almost like you don't even need to go to a show to play a lot of the games because

[32:07] they're just all over the place on location.

[32:10] I think for a lot of other people and other parts of the country, the appeal of shows

[32:15] like yours is there just isn't always access to a lot of these games.

[32:20] Right?

[32:21] I mean, the only time you're going to get all these games in one location is, is at a show

[32:25] like yours.

[32:26] Yeah, I mean, well around here, we have, you know, composed at arcade closed now.

[32:32] We have a, Lanes and Games is closed.

[32:34] We have a couple of small barcaes that opened up in Cambridge, but there's really nothing

[32:39] anymore.

[32:40] I mean, I have a couple games on location at a mall in Framingham, but other than that,

[32:45] fantastic is going to be the, you know, if people want to go play pinball once a year,

[32:49] the fantastic is going to be the only choice unless they want to travel to Pennsylvania,

[32:53] you know?

[32:54] So that's who wants to do that, right?

[32:57] No.

[32:58] I love Alan Tahn.

[32:59] I mean, Alan Tahn's close.

[33:00] I went to school in Alton, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

[33:03] I went to Lehigh.

[33:04] So it was, it was the same exact trip to go to my college is what I took to go to, to

[33:09] Alan Tahn.

[33:10] Um, let's talk about selling games at shows.

[33:13] So something that I'm always interested in is all, do, is fantastic like the other shows

[33:19] were like all the deals are already done before the show even starts or is it half of that

[33:24] where people are selling beforehand and they're just going to the show to pick up the

[33:28] gamer.

[33:29] How do you handle selling of pinball machines at your show?

[33:32] Well, I, first of all, I don't let anybody start a, you know, a thing on pinside where

[33:38] they list all the games, you know?

[33:41] Not that's, that's, I frown upon that and I don't really allow that to happen and people,

[33:46] as people register games, I update the game list daily to what games are going to be

[33:52] at the show and people can see what's going to be at the show and most of those games

[33:56] are going to be for sale and some of them won't be, but a lot of them will be and I, you

[34:01] know, the way I did it was people have, leave their games at my show till the end because

[34:07] I give, I give them prizes, you know?

[34:10] Every day we give away, for Friday we give away a thousand dollars in prizes which are,

[34:16] and Saturday we give away a thousand dollars in prizes which are donated by the most of

[34:20] the vendors like, you know, gift certificates and the, one of the prizes is a hundred dollars

[34:25] cash that I put in and then if your game is there on the free play floor at 10 p.m. on

[34:31] Saturday we go around and we rip all the tickets, every game is a ticket and a number and

[34:36] we rip all the tickets off of those games at 10 o'clock and they go into a, they go into

[34:40] a drawing basket and we pull out, we give away a thousand dollars in cash so 500, 500,

[34:48] 250, 250 and 500's.

[34:50] So people, people, there's incentives.

[34:53] It's not easy to keep the games out because, you know, there's something more frustrating

[34:58] right when you go to a show and after the first day half the games, not half but like a

[35:03] lot of games are turned off because someone bought them and the game sits there with a

[35:07] sign being like sold and, you know, the owner doesn't want people to be beating on it

[35:13] on free play so they, the game sits there dormant.

[35:16] So I think that's a smart tactic to keep the games in use and, and is it, and these

[35:23] are, it's inevitable, you can't keep people from pulling games that certain, you know,

[35:28] there's a, there's a, we charge our feet if you pull a game before eight o'clock each

[35:31] day but we, we give them, we try to give them more incentive to leave the game than, than

[35:37] incentive to pull the game, you know, that's, that's the one thing we do that, that a lot

[35:41] of shows don't do so.

[35:43] I'm always, you know, as a collector, you know, I say that very, very liberally.

[35:50] As someone who, it's always amazing to buy a game in a show though. I mean, I, I was at

[35:57] a Alan's house there was something a big bang bar and it was just $2 and you could

[36:01] jump on it and it always makes me nervous seeing people sort of, you know, tons of people

[36:05] playing a game and then, and then someone's going to buy a game that's been through the

[36:09] paces at a show because, like, on average, gave how many plays does a popular title get

[36:16] at a show over a three day period?

[36:17] It's like 350 to 400. You know, we, the games are, I love bringing games to shows just

[36:26] because if they, if my game makes it through the show, then it's bulletproof. I mean, you're

[36:31] good, you know, and we have a, you know, we have a repair team of about 10 guys that are,

[36:36] they rotate and they, they go through and we take everybody's key, you know, everybody

[36:41] gives us a key to their game. They keep a key and we, we have a key. So if something goes

[36:47] wrong with the game, we, we have the, you know, they sign something, we have the right

[36:52] to open up the game, you know, stuck balls and small stuff. It's something big and we'll

[36:56] call them and it's all, it's all free. You know, they get it all free, done free. So,

[37:01] people love it. You know, they can leave. They don't have to watch the game and constantly

[37:04] if there's something, you know, they'll, they'll, then there's the technology. We're,

[37:08] we're really coming up with the technology. We're going to next year, we'll probably have

[37:11] QR codes that'll be on the every game and all that stuff.

[37:14] Right. Are those crickets in the background?

[37:16] He's a cricket here. And we've got to go on to another room.

[37:19] Oh, God. I'm like, I'm like, I think I'm hearing stuff. This our first outdoor podcast,

[37:26] it sounds like. No, I was in the garage. You don't want to stay with the game from now.

[37:30] I should totally bring my, my broken magic girl set it up and then have one of your

[37:36] texts fix it. That could be the, that could be the solution to my problems with this

[37:40] game.

[37:41] Um,

[37:42] Okay, scenario you guys on be ready to sign a text.

[37:45] I feel like he wanted to take a sledgehammer to it. Now he, it's still like, I still feel

[37:51] bad that he doesn't have a game. I think one day I would love to see him get possession

[37:57] of one of the magic girls. So we'll see what happens. But now he's, so his, his artwork

[38:03] for Pintastic gave the, the, isn't that magic girl on the poster?

[38:10] It's a drawing of magic girl. Yes. The poster is original drawing that he created.

[38:15] Right.

[38:16] And yeah, I wanted, I mean, I, I didn't tell him what I wanted. I'm like, he said, I

[38:20] got a couple of ideas of ideas. Like go with it. You know, do it. I want the fantastic

[38:26] logo somewhere on it. So that's all I wanted. That's what I do every year last year was,

[38:31] you know, we had, um, we had on the, I see do last year's poster and T shirt. And, uh,

[38:41] this year we got something on the, at the next year, we'll get another artist. That's

[38:45] the one of the things I started, you know, every year is a different artist. We bring

[38:48] them in. We do, they do the poster and T shirt.

[38:50] Right. Is there going to be, uh, I know there's a lot of, and a lot of talk in the, in

[38:55] the form about highway pinball restructuring it. Will there be an alien there? Are there

[39:01] any animals with distributed, I guess maybe coin tinker.

[39:04] I'm taking a, I'm going to take a, I'll probably bring one. I mean, we've reached, we have

[39:09] reached out to the new owners of highway, of highway pinball. See if one of them wants

[39:13] to come and, you know, talk, but haven't heard anything back yet. So I'm, I'm doubted

[39:18] out what happened, but I have to try, you know, yeah. I know. I think it's going to, I think

[39:22] it's going to be pretty much silent for a few months as they get everything restructured

[39:27] and rebuild the company because I think their focus is obviously on, and getting production

[39:33] ramped up and people have seen the game. I mean, people have seen the game at enough shows

[39:37] now where they, they have the order is they need to down, just figure out how to make

[39:41] them. So it's probably good that they're not going to show. I think people would, would

[39:45] not want to see more selling. They want to see more production. And I think that's where

[39:51] the focus is going to be. So any, any sort of like what's the, any surprises in store

[39:58] for people up in Tazeg any games we haven't seen before any home brew stuff that people

[40:02] have been working on the Northeast that hasn't been brought to any other shows. Yeah, there's

[40:08] some reading, just some re-themed stuff, some cool re-themed stuff that people are going

[40:11] to be doing and bringing them to the show. But other than that, I just think, you know,

[40:16] I think dial in is really going to be a big hit. I know you, I know you like it. I love

[40:20] it. So, yeah. Jack, you know, Jack, Jack Seminar, he can do free pizza at his seminar like

[40:27] he did last year. So he buys pizza for everybody at that seminar. Look at, you know, I don't

[40:33] even think he needs to buy free food. I mean, the game is really great. I think the more

[40:37] people that jump on it and the code is pretty, pretty far along in that game. People are

[40:43] going to have a good time with dialed in. I actually went to go play it at Pioneer Bar

[40:47] in New York City on Friday. I leave early and the diverter was busted on it. But it's since

[40:57] been, it's since been repaired. You know that mechanical woman in the back who like diverts

[41:01] the ball from the ramp to the pop bumper. So her arm was getting stuck like midway down.

[41:07] But I know Pat Lawler reached out to to Al here in New York and apologized and they came

[41:14] up with a solution for it. So it's fixed. I have to go back. Yeah, I met Al's a great guy.

[41:19] I've met him before. He's, he's, I can't, I can't imagine what he can do. He's everywhere.

[41:23] He's everywhere in the pimples. I feel like no matter what show you go to, he's just like

[41:27] leaning against the wall being like, hey, and you're like, how did you get to like Australia?

[41:32] But no. So let's go to Texas. You've got Texas and I got, I bought that book, you know,

[41:39] the book with the aerospace or working it. And I, I, I showed it to him outside and he's like,

[41:45] all right, I took a picture. It's on Pinside. Right. Yeah, he's, he's, he's everywhere.

[41:50] He's everywhere. He's everywhere. So on Pinside, let's talk about what's going on the hobby.

[41:54] Now I know Gabe, you, you run a show. So we're not going to expect you to say anything dramatic

[42:00] about people because you really want, you know, all these manufacturers to feel good about

[42:04] joining Pintastic. What, what are your thoughts on the hobby, though, like over the past year?

[42:09] You know, we've seen a lot of boutique companies struggle to get games out. You're also collector when

[42:14] you're not working on Pintastic. Did you preorder any of the games that have gone into some troubles?

[42:23] Yeah, I was one of the early adopters for, for Wizard of Oz. And I, you know, my, my name is actually

[42:31] on the credits of Wizard of Oz. If you look at the credits, my name Gabe is on there.

[42:36] Because I helped, I was a good friend of Jack. I helped him through a lot of hard times during

[42:40] the terrain and making of the game. You know, you know, we emailed back and forth talked on the phone a lot.

[42:47] And so I was early on that. I was, you know, I hobbit, I got it on right away and,

[42:53] and now dial in, but I was actually had number, I had number five aliens, number five reserved,

[43:05] Ellie and early on. And I got out of that because I just, I just, I was just dumb way. I couldn't wait

[43:12] along. You know, I just, you got to refund. Yeah, I got to refund early on. It was, I mean,

[43:19] now I actually sold my, I sold my spot to another looking collector in this.

[43:23] Oh, man. Have you followed up with him? Is he still in on it?

[43:27] I haven't followed up with him, but I mean,

[43:32] why did, why did someone buy your spot when there were, there were, Ellie's were never even sold out?

[43:38] Well, I had, I had gotten a discount from Highway Pimbo on the original, because I was part of the show,

[43:44] you know, he, he was a friend of mine and he gave me a discount and I got, was it $15,000?

[43:52] I remember what the discount was. It was, it was probably $5,600 bucks. And I thought, you know,

[43:57] what everybody else was paying. Okay. So, all right. Well, but it was, it was the, it was the,

[44:03] the low number, you know, number five. So, yeah, the problem is, I don't think they make,

[44:09] the problem is they don't make their Ellie's in sequential order.

[44:14] I don't know. No, well, I mean, it feels, wait, yeah, because some guys got Ellie number like 74.

[44:22] And what they do is that you get to pick your number, right? So, you could tell them you want number five,

[44:27] you want number like 98, whatever it is. But they didn't, they don't build them like one, two, three,

[44:34] four, five. They basically were building them at the end. They were just building it, whoever was

[44:38] like paying cash up front. So, even if you came in at, and Jack was doing a lot of that stuff too,

[44:43] with Wizard of Oz and Hobbit, where you could cut the line. And that's what made me believe.

[44:48] I don't believe, I don't believe he was doing that. I talked a bunch of times on it. He was, I mean,

[44:53] there was, it was the distributor server getting the games ahead of people. And because, but they had

[44:58] already ordered the games early. So, I think that that wasn't, yeah, but there's a little bit,

[45:03] but the problem with that though is like, let's say I give money right to Jack. And,

[45:10] and like, I love Jack. I just spent a whole day at JJP. And I think the new, like Jersey Jack

[45:15] today, the company today, is a much different company than it was when they were making Wizard of

[45:21] Oz and the Hobbit, right? And they've obviously restructure, they have new financial investment.

[45:26] But I think the issue is though, if I give, let's say gave you a company and I buy game number five

[45:32] from you. And you take my money like basically the day you announce your new game. And I'm like,

[45:38] gave, I want, I really want your game. Here's, here's my money. I want game number five.

[45:44] Let's say two years go by. The game finally comes out. And my, I don't get my game, but a distributor

[45:51] has like 20 of them. You know what I'm saying? That's what was happening. And then I, then some guy

[45:57] who just came into the game that week who wanted one could go to the distributor, get one immediately.

[46:03] And I'm still waiting. And I had money in first. You know, and that's, yeah, but you don't know

[46:08] if that distributor bought 100 games before you put your deposit down. That's what we, that's what we

[46:13] don't know. So yeah, I mean, but yeah, but at the end of the day, it's like, that's why I think

[46:18] things should be built sequentially. And it would be, it'll only be fair to get, you know,

[46:24] give the people who order their games first, their games first. And it just hasn't worked out that way.

[46:29] But look, I think the lesson everyone has learned over the years now is just buy a game when it's

[46:35] out of distributor and it's in a box and you can have it shipped to you the day you pay for it.

[46:42] Like that's the way it should be. I think we're getting there. I won't be pre, I won't pre-order,

[46:48] I won't pre-order any more games. I'll be buying the game that's on free play. The dialed in

[46:54] that's in free play. I'll be buying that game right right on the showroom floor. So that's the game

[46:59] I'm taking home. I'll probably be putting it on location. My location have the only, you know,

[47:05] dialed in location in this whole area. So do you, do you route games as well? I route games at a

[47:12] game underground in the Framingham, the Nadek Mall. I'm sorry. It's in the mall. So how how how

[47:18] your game like what games do you have on location right now? Right now, three Sterns games,

[47:24] Ghostbusters, Game of Thrones and Star Trek. They all do pretty well. Okay. Do games make a profit?

[47:32] Like do you actually reach a point where if I if you put a like a Ghostbusters premium on location,

[47:39] is there any profit to be made at the end of the journey with a game that costs like $7,000?

[47:46] Not really. No, I mean, you can't really make, I mean you'll make your money back if you leave

[47:52] it there for, you know, three years, but I'm just doing it to bump, you know, to promote the hobby,

[47:57] to promote the show and to have some games for people to play when, you know,

[48:02] fantastic is not, you know, keep their hype going, you know, it's plus I'm running out of room

[48:07] in my house. So I need someone to put these games. So that's one of the, that's one of the things I

[48:11] figured out. How many of them over there? How many do you have at home? I have a 17 at home now.

[48:17] Pretty much. Can you close to being at a room? So I got, you know, I got 16 and then I got three

[48:22] over there. So now, are you married, Gabe, you have kids? What's the family situation?

[48:28] Like with all these things? I'm married. I'm married and I got kids that are two kids in college.

[48:33] Okay. Does your wife like pinball as much? Does, you know, 17 in the home is, there's got to be some

[48:39] sort of either, she has to compromise. My wife, my wife does not like pinball, but she helps me.

[48:45] She helps, she's happy that I'm doing something that I love and that the show is, is going to do

[48:52] well. She's at the show. She's in the ticket booth at the show. But she doesn't want to know.

[48:57] She doesn't want to have a bad thing that she's my wife or anything. She's just nameless.

[49:02] Just because so the people will come up to her and be like, where, you know, if you see Gabe,

[49:06] I mean, you're, there's wife, you know, what do you, you know, they'll start talking. She just wants to

[49:10] just take a person. She doesn't want to be my wife at the show. Right. She temporary,

[49:15] cease, cease of marriage during the show week. So where do you keep your 17 games? Do you have a

[49:22] game room? Do you have a game room above my garage? Yeah. Okay. So I got to get them down,

[49:28] out, down the stairs and out every year. And, you know, I just, I, all my games are modified. So

[49:35] all Titan, rubber is all quintic early D's all under cabinet lights. But, you know,

[49:42] all the sponsors for the VIP lounge are all guys that helped me, you know,

[49:49] till graphics and pin graphics and rock custom pinball. All those, all their mods are on all my

[49:55] games. And they're on the banner of the VIP lounge and everything. So. Okay. So you're into

[50:00] modifying all your games. Are they all like pretty mint pristine, like, fully decked out titles?

[50:07] Yeah. They're all, they're all decked out high and high end titles. And I, I do them because I,

[50:12] you know, you're not going to play a game that's decked out like this in, in a, you know,

[50:16] public location. But I just, I, I was really, really anal for years and I would, you know, scratch

[50:22] here, scratch there. I was just, you know, I couldn't handle it. You know, but now I've learned to

[50:28] live with certain things and to just focus on the play field more like that than the cabinet itself,

[50:34] you know, but my games, all my games are really nice. You can't be OCD with pinball, right? Because

[50:41] you will lose that battle. They're at some level, you have to concede the fact that pinball

[50:49] machines were designed to wear. And someone with a belt buckle will walk next to a cabinet one day

[50:56] at a show and you'll have a little scratch. It's just the way it is. I mean, do you want to show

[51:02] you can't be like that? I mean, it is what it is. I've come to learn and, and you can't have both.

[51:09] You can't have everything, you know, so yeah, that's more, like, it's more fun to put the miles on

[51:13] the car than just have the car sit in the garage and not move. So I think it's great that you bring

[51:19] your own personal games to the show. I think that's awesome. It sounds like the VIP lounge is going to be

[51:23] a blast. So you're no longer pre-oiter in games. So are you in on Star Wars? Are you going to get one?

[51:29] What do you think? I get to play it, but I mean, I don't know. I just, like, I've heard you

[51:36] talk about it on your podcast. I don't like the theme that they went with on it. I think that you

[51:42] were 100% correct at what they were trying to do, but I just don't see something that I really

[51:50] want. I mean, until I play it, if I play it, and if anything, it's going to be the premium,

[51:56] because that's got the hyper ramp on it, which seems really cool, you know, but I just,

[52:00] I won't know until I play it. Yeah, no, I think I think all of us, you're not just you gave not

[52:07] me, but everyone out there just wants to see this thing be flipped because it's pretty clear that

[52:14] visually it's not going to blow us away. The art package is what it is. It's not the worst that

[52:20] has gone into a Richie game by any means, but it's not the best of the latest stirons that we've

[52:29] seen. Star Wars is a theme that everyone expects just, you know, starting to give the best effort on

[52:34] all fronts. Obviously, Lucas tied their hands behind their backs a little bit, but, you know,

[52:43] when do you think we're going to see it flip? I heard that Jack Danger might do it this week,

[52:49] hopefully. Yeah, I'm guessing this week, you'll see something. I mean, we had,

[52:53] we had a slow though. Who wants to see a pro being flipped? I want to see the damn hyper drive.

[52:58] At least you get the music, right? I mean, something to call out. Yeah, something.

[53:03] And we had Steve Richie and John Trudeau and all those guys at the show last year, and

[53:08] Steve Richie's a great guy. He knows that and build a great game. I just, every game that he's built,

[53:15] I'm not ready to buy until I play it. So I got to play it first. You know, maybe after I play it,

[53:22] I'm sure it's going to kill on look. I'm sure it's going to kill on location. So maybe I'll just buy it

[53:27] just because it's Star Wars. People are going to play it and I'll make money, you know? So

[53:30] yeah, like the way to go for location play is is the pro though. I mean, throw that pro out into

[53:36] the world for what is it? Like $5200 bucks. And because here's the thing, people,

[53:44] no one's going to walk up to Star Wars pro and be like, wait a minute, this isn't the premium without

[53:49] the hyper drive. 99% of like location people don't even know there's like different variations of

[53:55] these games. Right. And even if they do, I'd still play an Aerysmith pro or a Star Wars pro. It's

[54:04] Star Wars. It's on location. It's going to get played. And also the less on it, the less stuff to

[54:10] break, which is an operator's dream. The thing is simple. It's going to make money.

[54:15] Yeah, my location guy who wants the location, he's a big pinball guy. So he, when when

[54:22] Game of Thrones came out, he I told him I'll put a pro in there. He's like, well, I really want

[54:27] premium because you know, I want the other stuff. He's like, I'll give you an extra $500 if you

[54:32] throw the premium. So I think it's a no brainer for me. I just said, all right. But ended up that

[54:36] the pro is probably maybe the better game to playable game, but at the time, he wanted the premium.

[54:43] So I gave him what he wanted, you know, like Game of Thrones. You know, I feel like that game never,

[54:50] it never broke through. It's a thing that a lot of people love and the TV shows hugely popular.

[54:56] The books are hugely popular. I think it's struggled to overcome the issues it had with the

[55:02] the orbit issues it had, the upper playfield dragon never lived up to the hype that it was going

[55:08] to blow away what we got with the Hobbit dragon. And so you look, it's an okay game. The art package

[55:13] is pretty horrendous, but it's it's richy. I mean, it flows very well. I just wish that we didn't

[55:19] have to compromise with a Steve Richie pin. It's always like the game plays there, but then everything

[55:24] else is like an afterthought almost, but we'll see. I mean, I think everyone's also just completely

[55:31] fatigued waiting to see what Star Wars plays like. I don't think Stern has ever revealed a game

[55:37] and then made there be such a long wait for us to get actual gameplay. Right. Yeah, probably Batman,

[55:44] right? Batman was Batman was the other one we waited forever for gameplay. Yeah, well, I haven't

[55:50] played the new code yet. So hopefully that'll bring one of those to the show and I can play the

[55:55] new code. I'm sure Lime and I'll will be there to play it. I'm assuming he'll want to get out

[56:01] a code update before he goes to a public event because people really, I mean, they really are waiting

[56:09] for that game to be to sort of get that Lime and magic with the code. And have you played Batman 66

[56:16] Gave to your own one? Do you like it? No, I played a, I played a, I played a, I liked it. I mean,

[56:23] it's, I played, I did, I was actually very good at playing the game. I mean, I'm a good player,

[56:29] but I'm not great, but Batman seemed to really click with me when I was playing it. You know, a lot

[56:35] of the stuff wasn't working when I was playing it, but it was, it still seemed fun. I mean, I don't know,

[56:41] I wouldn't, I probably wouldn't own one because I'm not a big Batman. But,

[56:45] it's getting, getting, getting back to the pre-order. I predator actually was in very early on

[56:52] predator as well. And I met those, you know, those guys used to go to downtown, bring the game down

[56:57] town. And I got it, I got in on it early and I ended up getting out, getting my deposit back

[57:04] just before everything went downhill because I got some inside information from a few friends that,

[57:09] you know, things weren't looking good. So I got out of that, but,

[57:13] okay, so like, okay, so wait, did you, were you fully paid on the game, which is have 250 down?

[57:18] No, just the 250. That's all. Oh, well, come on, you didn't, you didn't dodge any bolts with that.

[57:23] I mean, I lost 250 on predator. I went, I, I, I went to buy a guy's spot. This is back in my,

[57:29] the housey and days of Canada. Wemmer, they were charging what for the game? 4500?

[57:35] Yes. Yeah, I think, I think I swooped in. There's a pin-side thread.

[57:39] If they didn't delete it because they keep erasing all of my history from pin-side for some reason.

[57:46] But, um, something about, I think I offered someone like 5500 for their predator spot or 6 grand.

[57:53] And I went to a guy who was like, look, I'll sell you my spot. I said to him, look, I'll give you

[57:58] the 250 because that was the first money they were asking for. I said, if I back out of this,

[58:03] you can just keep my 250. That's just like, that's, that's, that's the penalty to me to walk away.

[58:10] It got to the point where Kevin was asking for the, the other deposit.

[58:15] And I, you know what it is, I, I, I bailed on the game because I just thought the game

[58:21] looked like crap. And they could never get that, that black light UV thing to work ever.

[58:27] I mean, even when Kevin was had a humongous black light rod that he was waving over the game like a

[58:34] lightsaber, he still couldn't get the damn green blood to show up. And, you know, and so I was out.

[58:42] And I think, well, you dodged the bullet, too, but it's unfortunate.

[58:46] It's, it's, it's tough because a lot of people lost money in that whole thing and he's, you know,

[58:53] I haven't, I haven't kept up the thread, but is he, is he going to jail yet? Or what?

[58:58] He's not in jail yet. He declared bankruptcy. He is now in court frequently with the

[59:08] bankruptcy judge and they basically are going to go after all of his assets. He, I think he will

[59:16] serve some time, but I'm not 100% sure about that. I know this though. The lawyer going after him,

[59:21] Keith is, is phenomenal. And Kevin couldn't have a more uphill battle to climb because I,

[59:29] I think in his mind, he thought he'd just get sympathy from the judge and be like, I started a

[59:33] business and it failed. But that's not what he did. He started a business. He didn't have permission

[59:40] to even start and then he just kept the money that people gave him. I don't know why he just

[59:44] never refunded people. To this day, it, it boggles my mind. Right. I don't mean. Well, this is,

[59:53] he's, you know, he's not quite shooting a straight arrow there. You know, he's trying to rip people

[59:58] off. What, what it is is you take a guy who's annual income, probably every year of his life is

[01:00:04] around $20,000 and then all of a sudden you put $600,000 into a bank account. He's, he's, he's,

[01:00:13] he's not given that lifestyle up ever. What about Dutch Pimball? So tomorrow, I'm going to,

[01:00:20] I'm going to air this interview tomorrow, Gabe. By the time this airs, Dutch Pimball will be

[01:00:27] preparing or have done their, their live Pimball seminar webcast, whatever they're calling it,

[01:00:34] where they are going to take questions from early achievers and, and answer those questions on,

[01:00:40] on the status of the big Lebowski production. What, what, what are your thoughts on what's going on

[01:00:45] over there? Um, I don't know. It just seems like they're, they're just chasing, chasing their

[01:00:53] tail. I don't, I don't know. They come up with some type of resolution soon because there are

[01:01:00] people who are just going to bail completely on their whole company, you know, but I mean,

[01:01:04] yeah, it was a good guy. He was at the show last year. That guy can, that guy can party, man. He,

[01:01:09] he can drink and party with everybody. He was party and late until, you know, three, four in the

[01:01:13] morning. But, um, so he's got to drive. I know that he's got to drive to make things happen. So,

[01:01:19] hopefully he'll, he'll pull it, pull it together and, uh, eventually make everything happen and

[01:01:24] make everybody happy. And maybe hope, maybe they, someone will step in and help them out too,

[01:01:30] as far as if they, as a cash flow problem, you know, who knows? Yeah. I mean, I hear these stories,

[01:01:36] and I have to say, it reminds me of college where the kids who party the hardest never ended up

[01:01:44] with the Ferraris later on in life. And it, these, these guys like, they rolled around the

[01:01:51] pinball universe, badmouthing Gary Stern, having late night parties, running out pen houses,

[01:01:58] getting booth babes, all that money, all that money spent, dutch pinball money, consumer money

[01:02:05] went to a lot of this stuff. And, and now they haven't delivered on their promise. And, you know,

[01:02:11] like, I hope it works out because I do think the Lebowski is, is a great game that people want. And,

[01:02:18] but they've had a year, a year now, Gabe, since their ARA dispute, since they first got that

[01:02:24] invoice from ARA and they haven't accomplished anything. So, and then the latest newsletter from

[01:02:30] them was that they're going to look at a new contract manufacturer. But, man, I hear that stuff.

[01:02:36] And I'm like, that just, that just to me seems like six more months of waiting.

[01:02:41] Well, you know, making pinball is not easy. I mean, we've learned that. I mean, these small

[01:02:46] boutique companies think they can come in and do it. And, you know, I saw Jack, I was very close to

[01:02:52] Jack when the beginning and, and even now and saw, saw the pain that he went through, you know,

[01:02:59] the loss of weight. He looked like he was killing him, you know, the whole, the whole thing. And,

[01:03:03] he just, his drive pulled him through to that. But, and, you know, he got help at the end there. But,

[01:03:08] he was, you know, it was, it's, it's, it's the light. Where's a lot on you that I can't imagine what it's

[01:03:14] like. I tell people all the time, Google image, what Andrew Highway looked like when he started

[01:03:22] at Highway Pinball. And look at him now. It's like kind of like when someone becomes the president

[01:03:29] of the United States and after four years, their hair is completely white. They've, they've,

[01:03:36] they haven't slept in four years. It's very much what happens, you know, and that's why it's not

[01:03:44] for everybody. I mean, Jack is, Jack is a fighter. I mean, Jack, Jack was not going to let that

[01:03:49] company go down. What are your thoughts on Highway? Because Andrew's like he's out. He brought the

[01:03:56] first, you know, one of the first few full throttle, first two or three full throttles to

[01:04:01] Pentastic Year One. So he was there with the Pent, with the full throttle and he did a seminar

[01:04:06] and everything. And that's where I met him and became, we became friendly and he was, he was,

[01:04:11] his passion for the, for his company was huge. And, and it was always huge, even till the very

[01:04:18] end. And he just, he just, I just don't think you could keep his head afloat, you know. And

[01:04:23] eventually went underwater. What people don't realize though about going, like taking full throttle

[01:04:31] to shows all over America for multiple years, cost tens of thousands of dollars. Yeah. And they,

[01:04:41] you're not going to sell full throttle. The thing is, is when you're starting a company, you have

[01:04:47] to be very careful with how you spend money. And I think a lot of these companies, you know, they,

[01:04:54] I mean, how much money has, has, has Jerry multi-morphic spent bringing it around, you know. And

[01:05:00] it's, they're only going to sell 25 in the initial batch. It's like, it's expensive. It's expensive.

[01:05:05] And like, I, but here's the thing. A lot of these guys like Jerry's doing it all out of his own pocket.

[01:05:10] Like he's not, he didn't take pre-order money to do all that stuff. Yop and Barry and Andrew,

[01:05:18] like they were using customer dollars in ways that weren't making games. I hear crickets again,

[01:05:24] gay. Where are you back outside? Well, I know I had to go plug in my phone. But, I'm really

[01:05:30] thinking about this. You're like, you're like my first roaming interview. This is amazing.

[01:05:36] Do you think Pimbal is going to survive? What do you think the future is? I mean, how long can

[01:05:43] this hobby last, Gabe, with games costing $7 to $10,000 now?

[01:05:50] I don't know. I said I was out when the price was going to, when the price hit $8,000.

[01:06:02] And now I'm buying a dial then. People find the money. I mean, people are going to find the money.

[01:06:08] They like the game. They're going to buy it. And I don't think there is a limit to what people

[01:06:13] want to spend as long as they see the value of the game. What did you see in dial then that made

[01:06:19] you want it? When you look at a dial then, when you look at any jersey jacket, you just see

[01:06:27] that there's a lot. They throw everything in there. Everything's high quality. It's like you're buying

[01:06:37] I see my money. In a Stern's game, I see it in the pro, I see the money. But in the LE,

[01:06:45] not so much. Premium, it's there. But they both go to different directions in their market

[01:06:53] with what they're trying to reach and who they're trying to sell games to.

[01:06:56] I totally agree with you. And I think it's the main issue I have with Stern these days is

[01:07:03] that shouldn't be the case. I shouldn't look at the lower end of the offering

[01:07:10] and feel like that's the only one where I can justify the price. But that's lately that's the case.

[01:07:18] I mean, especially with like Star Wars LE, you're going to yank out the shaker motor. You're going

[01:07:23] to yank out the real mirrored backlash. You're going to, you know, it doesn't come with like

[01:07:32] rad cowl stickers on the side. Remember when they showed Batman SLE and it had the beautiful

[01:07:38] decals on the side of that game? And Gomez was saying how they, that's a pattern and like sticker

[01:07:45] decal process that Stern has. So why aren't they offering it on Star Wars, right? On the LE.

[01:07:52] It's like, it's like, it's like they just won't give you what you're paying for.

[01:07:59] And I think the LE should have all the bells and whistles and feel like a premium high quality

[01:08:05] machine. I'm not sure if they're not giving you everything compared to maybe Joe,

[01:08:10] the jacket's trend is giving you the same amount for less money. I mean, I think there's a profit

[01:08:17] margin there that both of them are working with and they're different. I mean, they're different.

[01:08:23] That's just the way it is. I mean, Stern's games, they can pump them out. They know they,

[01:08:28] people are going to everybody's going to buy the next Stern's game and I love all my Stern's games

[01:08:32] and that I love all those guys at Stern's and they put out a good product. But you know,

[01:08:38] it's just that it's just that they have a different model that they're following than Jersey Jack.

[01:08:45] It's just a different product. I mean, I, but Stern's game, it's fun. Yeah, but I play a Stern's

[01:08:51] game. It's fun. Yeah, but, but Gabe, if you put a $9,000 Star Wars LE next to a $9,000 dialed in

[01:08:59] Ali, right? Same amount of money for each game. And you say to, and then you say, well, look at these two,

[01:09:06] which one looks like it's got a lot more in it, which one looks like it's got higher quality materials.

[01:09:12] Of course, Jersey Jack. And, but here's the thing, it's much cheaper for Stern to make that $9,000

[01:09:18] Star Wars than it is for Jack to make his dialed in. So that's why I'm always like, well,

[01:09:25] either Jack still should be, I mean, if a Star Wars LE is $9,000, a dialed in, and he looks like a,

[01:09:31] like a $13,000 machine. Yeah, well, I think you're, I mean, yeah, Jack, I'm not telling,

[01:09:38] I'm not saying he's charging a little, but I mean, yeah, yeah, I can see the value there. But as far

[01:09:43] as Stern's, they do, they limit their, you know, they limit their LE's and they limit their,

[01:09:48] you know, super LE's or everything to people who want the limited product. And that's how they,

[01:09:52] they can ask for more money for it, I think. And that's, you know, that gives them a reason to

[01:09:57] ask for more money. That's just the way it is. Yeah, look, I think Stern is just cash grabbing

[01:10:05] on the LE's and they know it. Like they know, if I was just the Stern marketing guy, I would walk

[01:10:11] in and they're, I would walk into a room gave and say the, the LE buyers of our machines,

[01:10:17] they, they buy with their emotions and not with their common sense. Like it, it's, I would basically

[01:10:24] say, we don't even have to show them value or quality. We just need to say it's limited and here's

[01:10:30] the theme and these guys will beat each other up to be one of the, the LE owners. Because that's,

[01:10:38] I don't know, they do, they do have some cool stuff on the limited edition models that, you know,

[01:10:44] you can't get in the pro. So if you want the, the upgraded models, you've got to pay the premium

[01:10:49] price and that's, that's just the model that they have moving forward and that's, that's their,

[01:10:54] that's the way they're going to do things. Right. But the premium, all right. So they have the pro,

[01:10:58] the premium and the LE. What, it, to me, when you look at Star Wars, how do you justify the,

[01:11:06] the $1,500 increase in price? They're, they're, it's, like, it's the same game with just different stickers.

[01:11:15] You're talking about the, from the premium to the LE over. Yeah. It's the same game.

[01:11:21] Well, they, yeah, but they jump, they make it limited and that's, that's what you're paying for,

[01:11:25] they're paying for a few extra, and yeah, and, and, and maybe I've just been having more like,

[01:11:32] you got to look at it differently. It's a limited, it's like a limited edition car. It's the same

[01:11:37] as the, as the, the fully stock loaded car, but it's, it's, you know, a 35th anniversary,

[01:11:43] and they're only making 100 doubles. People want to buy that model because they want to be,

[01:11:49] I have one of these and you don't and that's just the way it is. Yeah, but car companies don't

[01:11:54] really do that anymore. I mean, they really don't like, there's, the pinball world,

[01:12:01] there's different models and cars, but the difference is usually when you go into up a different

[01:12:05] model, the, the engine is bigger, like, the leather is better, that, you know, that's, that's my

[01:12:12] issue I'm, I'm having with Stern. And look, I'm, I'm the biggest Stern fanboy. I love Stern. I,

[01:12:18] without Stern, there wouldn't be pinball. There wouldn't be this podcast or wouldn't be

[01:12:22] pinside. Stern is the biggest company. Would I just have a problem with recently? Is, is, is,

[01:12:29] how they're yanking stuff out of their games and charging more the fact that a Stern,

[01:12:35] Ellie is nine grand, to me, is like, is laughable for an Ellie to be that much money. It just, like,

[01:12:46] I think Jack's Ellie at nine grand is accurate. I think Jack is priced it, where his bomb and the

[01:12:54] materials and Stern is just like riding his coattails because they have no competition. See,

[01:13:00] they can keep coming out with like four or five machines a year and they know that, you know,

[01:13:05] the, their target are like rich dudes who are addicted to buying these things for the most

[01:13:13] for the Ellie. It's a, yeah. It's a client demand. And if, if they have a, if they have the

[01:13:21] demand for that, that model, then they're going to keep doing it. That's why, why give you more

[01:13:26] when they can sell you this game for less than making limited, that's their model. I mean,

[01:13:31] right. Nothing against them. I love Sterns as well. There's more power to them if they can,

[01:13:37] if they can make millions of dollars doing that. That's great. I mean, it's just, just, the way

[01:13:42] they're going to do it. But, but, see, that's my question. But great for who though, because as a

[01:13:46] consumer, the more these people keep buying these games, nine grand and Sterns taking quality out,

[01:13:54] who's that great for other than Stern's financial financials? Like, it's not great for the,

[01:14:00] for the pinball hobbyist. They're getting pleased. I know. We have, you know, we have,

[01:14:08] American pinball coming in. We have Jersey Jack is, is ramping up and there's going to be

[01:14:13] competition and everybody's going to have the adjuster prices, adjuster, what they put into their

[01:14:18] games accordingly. And then, because there's only going to be so much money to go around. And

[01:14:22] that's what you're going to see is going to happen in the next probably two years. Yeah. I mean,

[01:14:27] I, I hope so. I think that it all comes down to production and volume. Like American pinball,

[01:14:33] you know, can they get production going and at what volume are they, are they planning to aim for?

[01:14:42] And that's the key is volume because Stern, we're, Stern wins is, is volume of production. And they,

[01:14:51] they will get, they will get hundreds of games out a month, no problem when they have a new title.

[01:14:58] Do we think American pinball will be able to make hundreds of Houdini's a month? Even if

[01:15:03] to demand is there probably not, right? Well, you've seen how long it's, I mean, Stern's has been in

[01:15:10] business for since, you know, daddy over 30, 30 years. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of

[01:15:15] institutional. Yeah. It takes time. It takes time. It's only been in business for, you know, for

[01:15:21] five years. So, fantastic. It's only been going for three years. So, you know, in 10 years. So,

[01:15:27] now I'm hoping to be huge, you know, see what happens. Yeah. But the difference is in 10 years,

[01:15:33] if you, if you say, here's the fantastic VIP room and I go in to it and it's twice as much money

[01:15:40] as this year's, there's nothing in it or you're taking stuff out. Don't take out, can't take out

[01:15:46] the person on stills. No, anyway, I joke, but I gave, I, I, I think it's, I think it is a really

[01:15:52] fun time for the hobby though. And I, and I think there's a lot of great games and consumers can

[01:15:56] decide where to spend their money. And I, and this summer especially with dialed in, attack

[01:16:01] from Mars, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Batman, I mean, these are all arrowsmith, right? These are all

[01:16:08] games you can go get new in box and put in your game room. If you had said that in, in, in early

[01:16:16] 2000s that we would have this many new pinball machines to choose from, people would think you

[01:16:21] were crazy, but, but it's definitely a new error, you know, new sort of rebirth of pinball. And

[01:16:30] any final words were sort of honor our gave from in terms of going, you know, getting people to

[01:16:37] just go to fantastic if you're anywhere near the, the Northeast. Yeah, I mean, we, we have,

[01:16:44] every, every fantastic has a little bit of everything. We have, you know, all the, all the cool stuff

[01:16:49] we talked about, we have a beach right there on a lake, spring, Fred Lake that families can go,

[01:16:55] you know, their husbands can go play pinball and the wives can go sit on the beach and we have a,

[01:16:58] we get the pool over there that we leave the pool in hot tub and indoor hot tub and pool open till

[01:17:04] midnight on both Friday and Saturday night. So that's another thing that for people to do. And

[01:17:09] it's, it's, there's a couple of different craft beer places that, you know,

[01:17:16] areas that people can go visit and there's a old-sterbaged village across the street where you can

[01:17:21] bring your family over there. And it's just a good time for everybody and the whole family and

[01:17:26] I hope people will come and they'll fall in love with pinball and the hobby will grow and

[01:17:32] people will buy more games and the more manufacturers will build more games and pop up and

[01:17:39] hobby will thrive. That's what I'm, that's what I'm trying to do. That's what I, that's why I started

[01:17:44] to show, you know. Someone is doing, you know those YouTube videos where they introduce kids to

[01:17:49] stuff like the NES and stuff that was way before their time, they think like the Nintendo system is

[01:17:55] a toaster and whatnot. I want to sit a bunch of kids down and be like, did you enjoy pinball kids?

[01:18:01] They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, how much do you think this machine is worth? And just

[01:18:04] see what they say and watch the faces when you tell them it's $9,000. They would literally just

[01:18:10] start crying probably hysterically. You got to start. You can buy like 50 big wheels or

[01:18:16] this pinball machine. Yeah, it's almost like a college tuition. Well, Gabe, I appreciate you being

[01:18:24] on the show. Your Canadian's first roaming interview with crickets and what not going on, but we made

[01:18:31] it through and it sounded good. So I encourage you guys who are listening. If you are anywhere near

[01:18:38] Pintastic to check it out, it's going to be great. A lot of awesome games. There are a lot of great

[01:18:43] people there and all these shows are really fun. I think the social aspect of these shows is really

[01:18:49] what makes pinball so enjoyable. Much cooler than a Godzilla. Godzilla, say Godzilla, Godzilla exhibition.

[01:18:58] Now it means Godzilla is awesome. But yeah, yeah, it's awesome. So Gabe, I want to thank you for

[01:19:04] taking the time on a Sunday night. And I will be there next year. I promise, I'm sorry again. If I'm

[01:19:10] not, if I can't make it this year, um, so when he's flying in, son, I got to figure it out. I'm still

[01:19:18] like looking at everything. I've been identical to him, brother. For those of you who don't know this,

[01:19:23] there is another version of Canadian out there in the world. He's he's even more like, yeah, he's

[01:19:28] even more so he'd be more of a troll than I am. Next year, you should like both come to the show

[01:19:33] that'll like really freak people out, you know. I know. I should interview him on this show because he

[01:19:38] just makes fun of pinball like in general. He's like, you guys are all just a bunch of freaking

[01:19:44] bored white losers. You know what you should do is get a room Saturday night at the hotel and you

[01:19:51] fly in, you know, you come to the show, even if you get there like, you know, eight, nine o'clock

[01:19:55] a night, I think goes all night long. Right. Yeah. No, it's it's it's always fun. It's always fun.

[01:20:01] Well, Gabe, thank you again. Have a great night and yeah, we'll talk to you post show to see if

[01:20:08] if we're in the green this year. All right, man. All right. Sounds good. All right. Have a good night. You too.

[01:20:24] Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back. Expect me. I'm coming.
