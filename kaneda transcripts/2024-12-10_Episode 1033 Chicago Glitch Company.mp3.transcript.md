[00:00] And I don't like to think about the city, no, no.

[00:07] And I hate the country side too.

[00:12] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:17] Oh, everybody, 5.30 in the morning coming at you from Connecticut right now.

[00:21] I'm looking at these Chicago Gaming Company photos of Pulp Fiction,

[00:26] Ellie, Bad Mo Fo, Edition, The World is Waited 2 Years for This Game.

[00:32] I'm looking at the details on this game.

[00:35] I'm reading Neil McCrae review this game as if the same exact game hasn't been out for over a year

[00:42] in SE format that everyone's already seen.

[00:46] Maybe Neil's game is different because he's got mirror blades on it.

[00:50] His opinion matters more about gameplay than the last year and a half of people playing the game,

[00:55] apparently.

[00:55] So here's the thing, everybody.

[00:57] The reason why I'm calling this podcast Chicago Glitching Company is I don't like any of this.

[01:03] And I want to explain what I mean by that.

[01:06] And it's not even about like this product specifically, even though there's things in this

[01:11] reveal now that we see the final version of the game that are clearly taking a step back.

[01:18] We're going to talk a little bit about the topper.

[01:21] The grill isn't the same.

[01:23] Just all the little details that excited us about the pre-production version of the game,

[01:30] right?

[01:30] When Zach did that great video and they showed us the teasers of the game and all the trailers,

[01:36] everything got us really excited.

[01:38] They nailed all the details and then two years go by and then the final product,

[01:44] the details aren't as nice.

[01:46] And that's the thing I want to focus on.

[01:48] And I just want to say this right now.

[01:50] If you want to come on my Facebook page and tell me that CGC Games earned great on location,

[01:56] I don't care.

[01:58] I don't care what any operator tells me about how their game earns on location.

[02:04] Why would any home buyer who buys a new inbox product where they just want to get exactly

[02:11] what they were sold, we're not making money off of our games?

[02:16] Saying a game earns on location as an excuse for bad details, for anything to be different

[02:23] than what our expectations are is a lame excuse.

[02:27] I just don't get it.

[02:28] I don't get how these operators like, well, it doesn't matter, man.

[02:30] It doesn't matter what you think about Toy Story because it earns great on location.

[02:35] Really?

[02:36] I'm happy for you that your Toy Story that's $12,000 to $15,000 is maybe one day going to break

[02:42] even.

[02:43] And by the time it breaks even, you're going to look at that 15 grand you dumped into a Jersey

[02:48] Jack game when Bitcoin was $26,000 a coin.

[02:53] And then you're going to wake up today and tell me how great your game earned on location

[02:58] when you could have made like 300% more money if you just put it into something normal.

[03:02] So here's the thing, everybody.

[03:04] Again, it's 5.30 in the morning.

[03:06] I'm going to go off a little bit.

[03:08] So I'm looking at this topper first and foremost.

[03:10] Look at it.

[03:11] It looks garbage.

[03:12] It looks absolutely horrible.

[03:14] Who painted this thing?

[03:15] It's like I handed Killian a paintbrush and said, hey, just give me some eyes on Mia.

[03:21] And they look absolutely terrible.

[03:23] It's like you can almost see the brush strokes.

[03:25] It's like they used a brush that was too big.

[03:28] Everything about it just looks really bad.

[03:30] She looks like a scary zombie.

[03:32] And then John Travolta looks like Conan O'Brien.

[03:34] Doesn't really look like him.

[03:36] All of a sudden something happened, right?

[03:38] It's like when we saw the original version of the game, the stuff that excited us on it, right?

[03:43] Nobody said anything bad about the topper.

[03:46] We didn't look at the figures and be like, that doesn't look right.

[03:49] We didn't see the cars and the lights and everything going on up there.

[03:52] It just was exciting.

[03:54] Now all of a sudden you get the final version of it.

[03:58] After two years, they had two years to figure out a way to make whatever they showed us originally

[04:05] to just put like a thousand of those in a box and get everybody what they wanted.

[04:12] Get everybody what they paid for.

[04:13] Get everybody what you showed them to hook them on your game.

[04:19] And you couldn't do that.

[04:21] And we know that they were delayed because of the toppers.

[04:23] And here's the sad part.

[04:25] If this is what they deem to be acceptable, if this is what satisfies them,

[04:32] then I'm just going to tell you right now.

[04:34] Doesn't satisfy me.

[04:36] I don't want to support a company like this that takes two years and then drops something like this

[04:43] where it just looks worse.

[04:45] If you're going to take two extra years to get something to market, everything about it should be better.

[04:52] And I think it speaks volumes to the pinball buying community.

[04:56] I think there's two camps here.

[04:58] I think there's people here who absolutely have some standards and they live their life

[05:04] with some principles.

[05:05] And just on principle alone, I don't want to support a company that does stuff like this.

[05:11] And then you've got the other camp of people, the people that are the apologists.

[05:15] Like they'll look at something like this and they're like, what are you complaining about?

[05:18] Like the gameplay is below the glass.

[05:21] Why are you focused on the topper?

[05:23] Why are you focused on the grill?

[05:24] And I'm sorry, but I know you ordered your game.

[05:27] And I know you wanted to fend the company that you ordered your game from.

[05:31] But why?

[05:32] Why don't you have the same standards?

[05:34] Why aren't you holding these companies accountable?

[05:37] And the more that second camp continues to buy these products, what has it done for the rest of us?

[05:43] Think about it.

[05:44] When you become an apologist, you've actually helped these companies make pinball worse.

[05:50] More of us had standards about what we expect.

[05:52] How much should a topper cost?

[05:54] Like if you keep buying $2,000 cheap plastic toppers, they're going to keep making them.

[05:59] If you keep buying like $9,500 premiums, they're going to keep charging us more and more and more.

[06:05] So I think again, we all should have higher standards in pinball.

[06:09] The other thing I was looking at and I'm like, well, that doesn't look right.

[06:11] It doesn't look right.

[06:12] I was looking at the speaker grill because that's one of the differences between the SC

[06:17] and the LE is that nice sort of metal speaker grill area.

[06:23] And it's got the play mechanics logo and it's got the CGC logo.

[06:28] And I looked at it on the final version of the game and I'm like, it doesn't look right.

[06:32] Something's off here.

[06:34] I don't know what it is, but I'm looking at it and I could see that the logos are not centered

[06:40] with the grill.

[06:42] And I'm sorry people, but when you're going to do stuff like this, you center it.

[06:47] When things are off centered, when there's clearly an area where the thing needs to be in the center,

[06:54] it's just off-putting.

[06:55] And I noticed it right away.

[06:57] Again, these are guys that have been staring at this game for two years.

[07:02] It shouldn't take a blowhard podcaster in his garage at 5.30 in the morning to instantly

[07:09] pick up on details that just don't look right.

[07:13] The thing is all of our eyes work.

[07:16] That's how we are engineered as humans.

[07:19] We can see things that just don't go right.

[07:22] There's just something about symmetry and balance and harmony.

[07:26] And I'm sorry, but these pinball companies for this much money should just be nailing it.

[07:32] It shouldn't take a guy like me.

[07:35] I'm not even an artist, but I can tell you when something's off-centered.

[07:39] And so I'm looking at these things on the grill and not only are they off-centered,

[07:44] they're all pushed towards the top of the grill.

[07:47] They also, this is so funny to me because I keep feeling like they bait and switched all of us.

[07:52] They even switched which side the logos go on.

[07:56] Dude, these guys have any common sense.

[07:58] If you sold everybody the game with the Chicago Gaming Company logo on the right

[08:04] and the Play Mechanics logo on the left,

[08:07] how is it that when you got to final production of the game, you switched those logos?

[08:12] I realize why they don't look right because in the final version of the game,

[08:17] the grill itself is smaller than it was on the reveal video.

[08:23] Because that grill got a little bit smaller or the area that's visible is smaller,

[08:28] they didn't make the logos any smaller because the logos look beautiful on the reveal video.

[08:35] And now they don't look right on the final production version of the game.

[08:40] Here's my thing.

[08:40] Here's my takeaway on all of this.

[08:43] No pinball machine should ever be revealed to the world unless it is the final production

[08:50] version of that game.

[08:52] I don't think we should see any company ever push their product out.

[08:58] It's a pinball machine, people.

[08:59] Remember, this is a pinball machine.

[09:00] This is not a car like a Tesla.

[09:04] This isn't like the automotive industry where you see the concept first and then you get the final

[09:09] production.

[09:10] This is a pinball machine.

[09:12] There shouldn't be any differences between the game you see on the day they ask for your money

[09:19] and the final version of the game.

[09:22] We don't see Stern do that.

[09:24] They don't make any changes between reveal, take your money and game.

[09:28] We didn't see Barrels of Fun do that.

[09:30] They didn't make any changes.

[09:32] We don't see Spooky Pinball do that.

[09:34] When they reveal a game, the game is the game.

[09:37] There's nothing that's going to change.

[09:39] And here's the thing.

[09:41] If anything's going to change, it's got to change for the better.

[09:44] And so I think we Chicago Gaming Company, the reason why I'm making a little bit

[09:49] of a bigger deal than this really is, to me, this is just the icing on the cake of a rotten cake

[09:57] with this game's reveal.

[09:58] You reveal a game two years ago.

[10:00] Why?

[10:02] Why did you show this game two years ahead of when you could get the game to customers?

[10:08] Why?

[10:09] What was the rationale for that?

[10:12] I would love to hear the excuse from Mr. Sharp or Doug over at CGC.

[10:17] Why did you do that?

[10:18] It's not even like CGC has a line going every single week like a real pinball company.

[10:25] I get that they take their time, but why didn't they just wait?

[10:30] Why didn't they just wait?

[10:32] It's not like you don't know people are going to want Pulp Fiction.

[10:35] It's not like it's ever going to be a bad time to release the first Quentin Tarantino

[10:40] pinball machine into the world.

[10:42] If you had released this game with the final production version with a great reveal video

[10:48] and the games were on the line, there would be no worry that you'd get sales.

[10:53] But they keep doing this.

[10:54] They've done it so many times and I think it's at the point now where it's like,

[10:58] fool me once, fool me twice, but just on principle alone, I don't care anymore how good the quality

[11:05] is for CGC.

[11:07] I don't care anymore.

[11:08] I just don't care anymore because CGC to me, if you think about it,

[11:12] what do they stand for?

[11:13] The consumer experience around Chicago Gaming Company, it's a mixed bag.

[11:19] I get it.

[11:19] When this company first came out and was making these remakes, they were making beautiful remakes.

[11:25] They made the games better than they ever were originally.

[11:28] And here's the thing though, when you're remaking games like Monster Bash,

[11:32] when you're remaking games like Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness,

[11:36] I think people are a little bit more patient with you because those games have been out for

[11:41] like 30 years.

[11:43] You know what you're going to get?

[11:45] You're going to get a better version of a classic game and they're just going to enhance everything.

[11:51] But man, it sort of ran out of steam with Cactus Canyon.

[11:55] People were just tired of waiting.

[11:57] They said they were going to update the code.

[11:59] It's now been two years on that game.

[12:01] There's no code.

[12:02] People are still not playing the updated code.

[12:05] And it just seems like a company that just doesn't know how to hit any deadline.

[12:10] They can't even hit deadlines within a year, let alone two years.

[12:14] And so I think with a game like Pulp Fiction, you don't get the same patients anymore.

[12:19] You don't get the same patients anymore because you've been burning people with these delays for so

[12:23] many years.

[12:23] And it is a new game where people want it.

[12:26] They don't want to wait two years.

[12:28] It's not a game where I can go to the local operator and play an original version of Monster Bash

[12:34] as I wait for my remake.

[12:36] I guess you could go now and play a Pulp Fiction SE as you wait for your Ellie.

[12:42] I love that Neil McCrae is like reviewing his Ellie as if he's got a different game than any of the

[12:48] SEs out there.

[12:49] Neil, we know how the game plays.

[12:52] I know Neil loves to be like the first to unbox and show us a game.

[12:57] He did it with X-Men.

[12:58] But Neil, it's not this time, brother.

[13:01] It's not like we've all seen the gameplay.

[13:04] And also, like I was noticing in the reveal trailer for this game, when Mia wants to win the

[13:10] dance competition, her topper figure turns and faces you and lights up.

[13:16] When Neil McCrae's game is doing it, it did not do that.

[13:19] So I'm also wondering, does the topper not even function as well as it did in the reveal video?

[13:26] Not to mention the cars also look a lot uglier.

[13:29] Look at the wheels on the cars.

[13:32] The reveal video cars look much better.

[13:35] They look much more accurate to that time period.

[13:38] Now the wheels look like a cheap child's toy.

[13:42] So just on principle alone, I'm allowed to have my principles.

[13:47] I just don't like this.

[13:48] I didn't like it when Jersey Jack showed us Avatar SE and had pre-production playfields.

[13:56] Nobody, and I mean this.

[13:58] Nobody who's in on a $15,000 Avatar SE.

[14:03] Nobody really knows what the UV ink experience is going to be like.

[14:08] It didn't work at Pinball Expo when they tried to pipe and drape the area.

[14:13] And so you just spend $15,000 on a game.

[14:17] And we all know now what they did.

[14:20] They manipulated the video in that $100,000 launch video.

[14:26] Now, CGC did not manipulate the reveal video, but they definitely showed you something that was not final.

[14:33] So that's my thing, everybody.

[14:36] For this much money, no company should ever show you anything that is not the exact thing you're going to get for your money.

[14:46] I would argue with anybody that thinks that I am wrong on that statement.

[14:51] I don't understand why anybody would support a company doing it that way.

[14:56] Whose side are you on?

[14:58] That really is the ultimate question for everybody out there.

[15:02] Content creators, everybody.

[15:03] Whose side are you on?

[15:05] I'm on the side of the consumer.

[15:07] Look, if Pinball is going to survive over the next few years, I mean this.

[15:11] I keep thinking about all those games that automate it.

[15:14] And again, that is just the tip of the iceberg.

[15:17] There are games everywhere, all over the world, sitting unsold.

[15:21] And it makes me wonder, like, is the Pinball market big enough?

[15:25] Does it have enough room to grow?

[15:28] Or has the Pinball collapse already happened?

[15:32] It's just being hidden right now from our eyes.

[15:35] You know what I mean?

[15:36] It's like if you look at all those new and box games as sort of marketing casualties,

[15:42] I think that's the best way to think about it.

[15:44] All those games are marketing casualties.

[15:48] They are stacking up.

[15:49] And how long are they going to hide it from us?

[15:51] That these companies have been bringing to market games that we don't really want at these prices.

[15:59] They've been bringing to market themes that aren't really lighting us on fire.

[16:04] And they're hiding those games in warehouses all over the world.

[16:08] And they're piling up.

[16:10] And these dealers and these distros, they don't know what to do, right?

[16:13] They don't know what to do because not every game is going to be a Keith Elwyn le.

[16:17] They know that Jersey Jack is going to find some way to mess up Harry Potter.

[16:21] They're just going to do it.

[16:22] It's going to have muted clips or they're just going to reskin dial then.

[16:26] You know it, everybody.

[16:27] You know they're going to do something.

[16:29] When's the last time Jersey Jack took a theme and exceeded your expectations on it?

[16:36] I don't know.

[16:37] People will see every time they show a clip, every time they show a clip,

[16:41] it's muted clips and that's not going to work with Harry Potter where it's all about the

[16:45] interaction between those kids.

[16:47] And if you don't see that interaction happening and you don't feel it, it's not going to work.

[16:52] But they're piling up.

[16:53] They're piling up all those marketing casualties, all those cardboard boxes.

[16:58] If that doesn't telegraph to you that this hobby is not as big as they think,

[17:03] I mean just think about it.

[17:04] These companies are making all these games and nobody right now wants them.

[17:10] Look at what's happening in the world.

[17:12] I haven't had a significant raise in like five or six years.

[17:16] Okay, five or six years.

[17:18] My company was actually just acquired by Omnicom.

[17:22] We are now the biggest marketing media company in the world.

[17:26] And let me tell you the mood right now amongst everybody.

[17:29] Everyone's just nervous.

[17:31] Nobody knows what's going to happen.

[17:33] Nobody knows how things are going to shake out.

[17:35] And for a lot of you out there, if you're 40 to 60,

[17:39] unless you're self-employed and you are in 100% control of your destiny,

[17:45] you get to an age where you have to start being a little bit more careful with how you spend and

[17:50] invest your money.

[17:51] I mean that's where I'm at right now.

[17:53] I'm not going to pump it all in the pinball machines,

[17:55] especially as I see these pinball machines losing so much value right away.

[17:59] And so I don't know.

[18:00] I don't know if the collapse has already happened and they're just hiding it

[18:04] or if the market is actually bigger than I think.

[18:07] And I don't think they know.

[18:09] Right?

[18:10] I don't think they know.

[18:11] I mean think about it.

[18:11] The biggest pinball company in the world made John Wick.

[18:16] John Wick.

[18:17] It shows they did zero market research with its audience.

[18:21] That is scary.

[18:22] And I think deep down inside the biggest thing that I'm afraid of in all of pinball,

[18:27] because Stern needs to survive people.

[18:29] Stern needs to survive.

[18:30] If Stern goes away, it's not like pinball is going to go away.

[18:33] But who really wants to live in a world where all we get is like one boutique game

[18:39] that slowly trickles out.

[18:41] Yeah, sure.

[18:42] That could be the pinball landscape.

[18:44] But I do want Stern to survive.

[18:46] But the thing is to survive, to survive, I think they need to stop thinking like they

[18:52] need to attract new audiences.

[18:55] And they need to double down on why we love pinball in the first place.

[19:01] They need to reignite the love of pinball with its audience today, with its audience

[19:08] over the last 10 years.

[19:09] Not try to attract these young kids who have no money into their hobby and stop wasting

[19:16] so much time with the Stern army and location play and all these badges.

[19:21] That's not going to do it.

[19:23] They need to make the actual product without any insider connected, without any badges or

[19:29] achievements.

[19:30] They need to make the actual product.

[19:33] Freakin amazing again.

[19:35] Freakin amazing.

[19:36] Freakin something that when you look down at that world under glass, you want to spend

[19:40] this much money because these games are so freaking expensive.

[19:43] It's absolutely insane people.

[19:45] Metallica remastered LE is twice the price that the original Metallica LE was.

[19:51] Have all of you doubled your salaries over the last 10 years?

[19:55] Maybe, right?

[19:56] Maybe some of you have.

[19:57] But anyway, everybody look.

[19:58] Welcome to an early morning edition of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[20:02] I just want to say CGC, shame on you.

[20:06] Nobody should be revealing a game that's not final on the day they take your money.

[20:11] If you disagree, I feel bad for you because then you're on the wrong side of this debate.

[20:16] Everybody have a great day.

[20:18] We'll talk to you soon.
