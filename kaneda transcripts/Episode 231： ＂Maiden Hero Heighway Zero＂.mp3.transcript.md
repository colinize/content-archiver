[00:00] Put them in the iron mate.

[00:03] Iron mate!

[00:05] Excellent!

[00:07] Execute them!

[00:10] Buddhist!

[00:18] I don't know about you guys, but I don't think I've ever hit refresh this many times on

[00:25] Pinside in all of my years on that site.

[00:29] I mean, this is one of those days where we all were waiting

[00:32] Probably because of me telling you that we would get images of Iron Mate in Ellie sometimes in the morning

[00:38] we were waiting patiently

[00:40] throughout the day and

[00:41] Finally!

[00:42] Finally, the damn broke and we got to see images of Iron Mate in Ellie, and it was almost like a tale of two

[00:50] to pinball companies today because another bit of shocking news occurred today that we're

[00:56] also going to talk about and I just have to say at what point let me ask you guys a question

[01:01] at what point are you actually going to understand that everything I tell you for the most

[01:09] part happens will happen is true I told you Iron Maiden Lee would be shown today I told

[01:16] you that distributors would get length to the images of the games I might have been a

[01:19] little bit off on the timing I also told you the side art was going to be the spitfire

[01:26] plane with Eddie inside the cockpit dual eddies and it was going to be green I also told you

[01:31] that highway pinball would go under and all of those things have happened today so let's

[01:38] talk about it where should we start let's end on a good note let's start with highway

[01:45] pinball because I don't think there's that much to talk about other than the end is here

[01:51] or very very near and this sort of rumors started percolating on the UK pinball form I think

[01:58] it's pinball I think it's pinball info dot com something like that highway pinball

[02:04] that the investors the people running this company where filing for I don't think bankruptcy

[02:11] is the term it's like liquidation it's some other term over there in the UK but they

[02:15] basically have decided enough is enough it's we're done we're done and game over game

[02:23] over for highway pinball seems to be what is about to happen and I've also heard from

[02:30] some people over at highway pinball and I have to almost say we're going to call it right

[02:35] this almost feels like an election night where I think we can now call that highway pinball

[02:40] will no longer be part of the pinball manufacturing landscape and what a journey it's been to

[02:47] get to this reality I think I've tried to help many of you avoid losing your money on

[02:53] alien pinball I think there's been the camp of people who have

[02:56] shelled this game for years and you know who they are Hilton and you know who those people

[03:01] are who kept telling you to stick it out and as we saw them over the last year try to pick

[03:08] up the pieces from Andrew highway and all of his mistakes it just never was going to work

[03:13] out it never was going to work out and we knew the writing was on the wall once we saw

[03:19] new owners cut the line and get games in front of original buyers we knew that they were

[03:27] living basically paycheck to paycheck like these guys did not have enough money to keep

[03:32] this thing afloat and I feel bad for them I really do I feel bad that these new investors

[03:37] they were duped by Andrew highway alright they were duped initially by Andrew highway

[03:42] when Andrew highway told them how many pinball machines he would be able to manufacture they

[03:48] were lied to about the amount of full throttles he was going to sell he lied to you all all

[03:54] of you out there who put your faith in this man he lied to you and I think last year and

[04:00] it's funny because ironically tomorrow is actually I think tomorrow is alien day or do

[04:06] we miss it already but alien day will happen in the world and it's just ironic that here

[04:12] we are and a year go to this to this day this month when I posted that podcast of all the

[04:19] promises that Andrew highway made to you and then fail to deliver remember he was going

[04:24] to make 500 games a month and that was going to be easy for him to do and using that 4 to 5 titles

[04:29] a year and it just sucks that he gets to walk away he gets to go to Australia he gets to go

[04:36] enter into his next business scam of his hydrofoil that he's going to restore and bring back

[04:43] to life and you guys who lost your money on alien pinball are never going to see anything

[04:50] and you have to then explain to the people you love and the hard you know the the harder

[04:56] money that you worked so damn hard for just evaporates because of this guy's lies and

[05:02] look I think everyone's learned a lesson I think I'm sick of people learning lessons

[05:07] in pinball the hard way I really don't want you guys to ever lose money again and I think

[05:12] this is just another example of how fragile and how hard it is to actually run a successful

[05:19] pinball company all right but we've been saying it no one's been beating this drum quite

[05:24] like me that highway pinball will not survive okay it's that simple there are there's

[05:30] just pure economics at play here you just can't create new money there's no way to get

[05:38] out of a hole that was that big all right I think there's some people on the inside that

[05:43] should be ashamed of themselves for how how much they tried to convince you that everything

[05:49] would be okay because there's those camp of people you know who they are who basically

[05:54] say don't anybody get asked for refunds don't anyone try to protect yourself because if

[06:00] you do that will cause the company to collapse and I'm sorry but no that's not the way business

[06:05] works people who invested in a product who were told they could get a refund at any time

[06:12] they should be allowed to get the refunds for those of you out there who got refunds

[06:16] on your alien pinball machines consider yourselves very lucky put that money under a mattress

[06:22] and don't ever speculate on pinball again all right now I'm still waiting to talk to Dave

[06:28] Sanders he has some things he wants to say to me I really would look forward to getting

[06:33] Dave on the show to talk about this I also think that now that the end is over now that

[06:38] the end is finally coming to fruition I think we're going to hear a lot more stories about

[06:44] what went on behind the scenes there because NDAs there are no NDAs for what companies gone

[06:51] who's going to sue who and I think when you guys see the truth of how Andrew manages company

[06:57] of how he treated his employees of how he didn't turn the heat on of how he didn't pay

[07:02] their wages I really think you're going to realize that people aren't always what

[07:08] they seem at these shows when they're trying to control you into giving you their money

[07:12] all right the real Andrew highway was the bad guy can it was trying to look out for

[07:17] you I hope you realize that I was really on the side of the customers here I hate seeing

[07:22] crooks swindle people I also think everyone owes a very big apology not everybody but the

[07:27] people who down voted him the pinside moderators who kicked him out of the thread I think everyone

[07:34] owes I'm sorry I think the pinside moderations that owes a huge apology to Mr. Kim Mitchell

[07:42] who he was the very first person to actually surface and dig and research and find evidence

[07:50] that Andrew highway was nothing more than than a failed businessman time and time again

[07:56] that Andrew highway had started multiple companies that had failed that had gone nowhere

[08:01] that never succeeded and when he presented that evidence to people in the pinball community

[08:06] he was down voted significantly he was told to go away he was told to start to stop saying

[08:12] there's a fire he was told to basically shut up because we're going to get this amazing

[08:17] alien pinball machine all right here we are 2018 in April 25th and he was right all right

[08:24] it's not about being right or wrong all right it's about listening to people who are

[08:28] trying to help you who are trying to share research that may help you make a better decision

[08:34] with your money all right so we've we've we've sort of called this one we've called it

[08:40] and it happened all right it happened and we're not here to go out I just think pinball

[08:45] will be much better off when the companies that are just bullshitting customers get the hell

[08:51] out of this hobby there's no room for companies that fuck up pinball manufacturing there's

[08:55] no room for you if you want to make a pinball machine figure out what you can do to actually

[09:01] make it work before you take people's money if you're going to do it the other way and

[09:06] you're going to feed people a bunch of lies I think it's time that everyone in the hobby

[09:10] just looks you and says get the fuck out of pinball so Andrew highway if you're listening

[09:15] all right the damage you did to this hobby will remain for years to come you should apologize

[09:23] you should finally come on and say I am sorry and take responsibility for what you did

[09:29] and apologize to all those people who now lost money because of you and stop blaming people

[09:36] it isn't because of my podcast that your company went under your company went under because

[09:42] you bid off more than you could chew and you didn't really know what you were doing all right

[09:47] I didn't make you talk to nade shivers and say you're going to make 500 games a month I didn't

[09:51] even know who you were then you said those things all right you said those things to convince

[09:56] people to invest in you and it's over all right now while this was happening while this collapse

[10:02] was occurring we were all hitting refresh refresh refresh and then finally finally like like a like

[10:10] an angel coming down from the heavens we get the typical first encounter with a stern brand new

[10:19] machine and you have to love stern's ability time and time again to absolutely fuck up

[10:27] showing us artwork and a new pinball machine for the first time because once again here we are

[10:35] with low res images of something that looks effin spectacular all right and I literally I just

[10:43] want to talk about that for a minute and then I want to go on to the game itself because I think

[10:46] the game looks incredible but I once again think that stern acts in a certain way and here's how

[10:52] they act they act like the internet doesn't exist they're living under a bubble they think they can

[10:58] control communications here's how it went down today so basically here's the story all right you can

[11:05] you can believe me or you can think I'm lying but I just want to remind you at the beginning of

[11:09] this podcast I reminded all of you that I'm pretty much always right on this stuff here's what happened

[11:17] so basically iron maiden wants to reveal this game next week but stern has already started

[11:24] manufacturing iron maiden at least and so they're pretty much ready to ship out like Friday for

[11:30] Monday delivery and stern needs to get the games out of the factory now the problem is this stern

[11:36] can't ship games to distributors until distributors have sent stern money for those games

[11:42] but distributors couldn't get money from consumers because the consumers were saying we haven't

[11:49] seen it yet I'm not going to give you $9,000 for something I've never seen so they were caught

[11:56] in a quagmire and so basically what happened today was that distributors were given a link

[12:04] by Zach Sharp and stern marketing to show them what the Ellie would look like to share with their

[12:11] customers who were in on at least and you know what distributors were told please don't share this

[12:16] with anybody that'll do it Zach you figured out how to contain content in an internet age I mean

[12:24] are you serious so what we have now is okay distributors got low res images of just the cabinet

[12:32] artwork we didn't get any hot any images of playfield of sculptures of plastics of gameplay changes

[12:40] or you know the sarcophagus any of the other things that are part of the premium Ellie playfield

[12:45] experience we haven't really seen it literally was just low res images of the artwork and so then

[12:52] what happened those images appear on pinside pretty much immediately and everyone and so what's

[12:58] going to happen now they're out there they're on Facebook I put them up on my eBay page you know

[13:03] from from my listing for my game so if you want to see it and see stern now they can't go to

[13:09] pinside and be like yank those images down so cool they're on Facebook they're on eBay they're

[13:14] they're gonna be places so what's the point of sending low res images when you know they're going

[13:20] to go out so they have to had known these images would end up on the forum so why not give high

[13:28] res images so that when they do leak which they will that the best possible images of your game are

[13:38] what people see and so I have to assume that iron maiden the band has the exclusive rights to

[13:44] release the high res images when they want to next week it's probably gonna be like next like

[13:49] Tuesday or Wednesday so I feel bad I feel bad for one person I feel bad for zombie yeti that his

[13:57] amazing looking game isn't being seen in the highest res possible so but here's so let's just say

[14:06] once again stern fumbles getting people the best images possible but we will forgive them

[14:12] because people will see high res images soon and people will be blown away as more and more

[14:18] details of this game come out now let me talk about my thoughts on the Ellie artwork and I think I

[14:23] have to disclose that I am in on an Ellie and I have one currently for sale so that is disclosed

[14:31] to all of you now so you can take what I say now with a grain of salt on whether or not you think I'm

[14:35] being honest or trying to show myself I honestly have to say this I want to give some context I am

[14:42] not an iron maiden fan okay like I don't know what the color sort of palette is supposed to be in

[14:49] the iron maiden world like all I can go off of is like what people tell me and so I'm not sure

[14:54] like if it's supposed to be darker or lighter or colorful or dark but what I can tell is this certain

[14:59] people think that iron maiden Ellie artwork looks too colorful and I have to tell you guys I think

[15:05] you're crazy like my first impressions when I saw this I was like that is super cool and I'll

[15:10] tell you why because I actually thought the spitfire plane that was going to be on it was going to

[15:16] be more of the one in the banner and I was super happy to see it zoomed in with with the two

[15:22] eddies inside the cockpits and the iron maiden logo on the side I thought that looks really really good

[15:28] I also have to say this I talked to zombie Eddie and he's a great he's a good friend I love I love

[15:36] how talented he is I think it's so amazing that we're getting pinball machines that look this

[15:40] effing incredible and he was just telling me that the images that you're seeing are just way

[15:45] oversaturated so if you're complaining that you think it's just too bright I think you're going to

[15:52] happily surprised when you see the way the game actually looks in person I was also talking to

[15:58] another friend at Stern who told me this he said Chris you don't understand in person you can't

[16:05] get from these images what the metallic foil decals look like and how fucking bad as they are

[16:12] and you also can't understand how amazing the mirrored back glasses in person so those things are

[16:18] not popping I also you know I didn't have as much of a problem with the red armor as I thought I

[16:25] would remember I said it might look a little bit like a Christmas Z theme I don't get that I don't

[16:31] feel it looks like a Christmas game at all I really don't people are putting up images of like

[16:38] Wizard of Oz Ruby red and then this and I kind of don't get why people do that like we knew it

[16:43] was going to be red armor so that shouldn't be surprising to anyone I think the red actually

[16:48] works nice in terms of contrasting with the the green and the blue and then it kind of syncs up

[16:56] with the red of the iron made in logo I look zombie Yeti is a very very talented artist like he knows

[17:02] how to make things look really really good and I love the fact that this game sort of pops like it

[17:11] pops and what's what's kind of annoying is we're not getting to see the full picture

[17:17] how do I say this I want to let you guys know that when you see the high res and maybe I've seen

[17:23] something maybe I haven't just take that for what it's worth when you see what you're going to get

[17:29] with the play field with the sculpts on the game I think you're going to be blown away you can kind

[17:34] of barely see it in the low res but there's like an eddy with like like like ripped jeans like

[17:39] shirtless over the pop bumpers that's really cool and then there's an eddy to the right side of

[17:44] the game I don't know if that's the pop bumper of the newton ball on the left side on the right

[17:49] side of the game that's it's like the eddy holding the two machine guns up that looks just wicked

[17:54] like the game looks incredible as a total package I don't know how you're not going to be happy with

[18:01] this iron made in Ellie I love the fact that the speaker lights also light up red like Batman SLE like

[18:07] I said it would mofos um this game looks really impressive I I think people

[18:15] who want it and complained about the iron made in logo being crooked on the pro are super happy

[18:21] to see it's straight across on this one other than that like we don't really have that much to go

[18:26] on like you're you really can't get a sense of how awesome those foil metallic decals are for those

[18:33] of you who have seen Batman SLE you know what I'm talking about like it just doesn't photograph

[18:38] like you really have to see them in person to fully appreciate what's going on here so the other

[18:44] thing that happens is this is that pin side is this amazing place where like people once they get

[18:49] anything to complain about they'll start complaining about it and Ellie's always bring out the haters

[18:54] I I've never seen anything like how people complain and always throw mud on the Ellie versions of

[19:02] games and it comes down to usually one thing is people are fucking jealous they're not getting in

[19:10] Ellie for some reason it's like pro and premium buyers have to justify their decision by

[19:17] crapping on the Ellie I remember when Ghostbusters Ellie was shown and that is an amazing art package

[19:23] it looks incredible it blows away the premium and the pro how many people complained about the

[19:28] Ghostbusters oh there's too much greeners too are you kidding me look how good a Ghostbusters

[19:34] Ellie looks and and with the green armor and the slimer and it's just it's so much better and

[19:39] I think the the hate on the Ellie versions of the games is just is just coming from people who are

[19:48] down the totem pole that that is my take on it it really is it's like people you stay people

[19:53] even hated on the Batman SLE side art they were like I like the Ellie better than the SLE

[19:58] bowl shit if you put a Batman SLE next to an Ellie it is night and day which one looks 10,000 times

[20:07] better so I think this game looks great I really do I think the red gets picked up with the British

[20:13] flag it gets picked up with the logo I think the red highlights what's going on on the playfield

[20:20] and you know there's also exclusive side art decals that are inside the cabinet that looks

[20:25] really great and what's funny about this sort of review of Iron Maiden Ellie is we're missing

[20:32] the most important thing is the actual game itself is the most important part like everyone wants to

[20:38] see the sarcophagus the other elements that make the premium and the Ellie play experience different

[20:45] that's what people are so excited about even more right even more we knew zombie Yeti was going to

[20:51] give us three killer art packages and I think he knocked this out of the park but we also want to know

[20:58] like because people love Iron Maiden Pro is a game what are going to be the elements in the premium

[21:04] and the Ellie that really really really take it to that next level like what was removed and what

[21:11] was put back in and that is to come really really soon what's crazy is this I actually think for

[21:17] the first time ever we're going to see footage of what that stuff is from a homeowner who's

[21:23] probably going to unbox this goddamn Ellie on Monday because they're going out the door Friday I

[21:28] heard at Stern so this whole thing is super accelerated but if you hit time out and you hit pause

[21:35] today and you say let's just recap what happened today we've got highway pinball going under all right

[21:42] a pinball company is failing and from the ashes of one failed company rises a phoenix of one of the

[21:48] most unlikely home run games in the history of Stern pinball nobody and I did get this wrong nobody

[21:56] thought Iron Maiden would come out and take over take over and dominate the excitement of the

[22:03] pinball world in 2018 this game has done something that I haven't really seen any modern Stern do

[22:11] in a really really long time and I keep hearing from people over and over and over again how

[22:17] FN awesome the game is and I don't care who deserves that credit I don't care if it's Keith

[22:23] Elwin I don't care if it's zombie yuddy I don't care if it's Stern pinball I don't care who they all

[22:29] work together it was a team effort everyone you had a hand in on this game has to be doing cartwheels

[22:37] that they have delivered a game that has mostly everybody everybody saying it's FN awesome and

[22:45] this is what pinball should be I've been harping on this guys for almost two years that pinball

[22:51] machines should make you feel this giddy they should make you feel this excited to spend eight

[22:58] nine thousand dollars on the product you shouldn't be having to be convinced that it's worth it you

[23:05] shouldn't have to convince yourself to be excited you shouldn't have to get over elements of the

[23:09] game that that you're not happy with right I mean look at the excitement around this game we didn't

[23:16] see it with Guardians of the Galaxy we didn't see it with Erasmith we didn't see it with Star Wars

[23:23] you know this game from day one has been it's just sort of clicked it's just sort of clicked in a

[23:30] way that's like yeah like this is what pinball should be like a unique design a new designer like

[23:36] a different take on pinball great flow I just heard this game just it's just flow flow flow it's

[23:41] action it's original it's fun it's like it pulls you in it's the world under glass Marty the world

[23:49] under glass they got it right and I hope this sort of sets the bar where we go with future Sterns

[23:55] like I hope I mean how does Stern now release an Ellie of Deadpool or something else in the future

[24:03] how do they release their next Ellie and not have the metallic details decals sorry not have the

[24:10] metallic you know the upgraded speakers not have the anti-reflective glass now that everything's

[24:15] been put into Iron Maiden you know the shaker motor it's all in for the Ellie I think moving

[24:21] forward they're not going to be able to strip features out I know we've seen them do that before but

[24:27] I think they're going to learn when they really give you value stuff will sell out and and I think

[24:33] rightfully so so I think it's a great day for you guys who are in on the LEDs disclaimer by

[24:39] canada I have an Ellie for sale it's on eBay now with the new photos and I really wanted to say you

[24:45] know what how silly does it look now that in October when jersey jack pinball put up their

[24:54] pirates of the Caribbean reveal and someone started that thread on pinsoy that said a dark day for

[25:01] Stern remember that remember that Stern pinball was like going under because we all were and I

[25:06] was I was I also got caught up in all that hysteria Stern pinballs never going to be able to

[25:12] respond to this look where we're at now jersey jack is like on their back heels they're backtracking

[25:20] they're removing features from the game people are no longer no longer that excited for pirates

[25:25] the Caribbean it couldn't happen at a worse time that Stern will now take your money and ship you

[25:31] an iron maiden premium like just in a few weeks I literally that the giant has woken up the giant

[25:39] understands what you want and the giant is satiating what people demand in these pinball machines

[25:46] for these prices and you know at the same day that highway pinball collapses the the irony of

[25:53] those two things occurring at the same time I really do think the universe moves in in a way that

[26:01] has a rhyme and a reason to it it's almost like it was destiny that Andrew highways alien dream

[26:08] would die like on alien day think about that for a minute all right now I hope you guys get to see

[26:14] hyras images soon I hope Zach and Jared and the marketing team at Stern can stop acting so silly

[26:19] about how they're trying to control the release of this they need to stop like you know stop

[26:26] worrying so much iron maiden fans out there the media that iron maiden talks to the iron maiden

[26:32] fan base they don't even know what the fuck pinside is they don't give a shit if a few pinball

[26:37] losers have all the images you know it's we're all losers guys we are this how many people are on

[26:43] pinside iron maiden fan pages 14 million fans all right so we're going to get zombie Eddie on the show

[26:49] soon I was talking to him I want all of the art packages to be revealed the premium and the LE

[26:56] hopefully that happens next week I want to talk to him when everything is out so we can talk about

[27:01] his approach to all three art packages and go from there so we're not having to like talk about

[27:06] stuff that we haven't seen yet all right I think that'll be a great interview he's already said

[27:11] he's coming on so I can kind of confirm it all right what else is going on the bimbo world that's

[27:17] it for today guys I think it's I'm exhausted I don't know about many of you but I didn't really

[27:22] sleep well last night because I was really giddy to see iron maiden elite today and I'm happy to

[27:27] I'm happy to say I'm really satisfied with what they delivered I think the game looks phenomenal

[27:34] I I think Keith L. Win and and Jeremy Packer and George Gomez they they should light up some

[27:39] cigars and celebrate the fact that they're making pinball in 2018 on this level and and creating

[27:48] a lot of excitement and I would encourage a lot of you out there to get some time on iron maiden

[27:52] I'm going to go to Pioneer's bar and play here in New York City but I also want to tell you guys

[27:58] I get that artist subjective but when you want to go criticize any of zombie 80s artwork ask yourself

[28:07] what game are you saying has nicer art than iron maiden all right you got literally literally

[28:15] if zombie yeti did the artwork for alien pinball and you highways company would probably still

[28:22] be in business let's not forget that but the art package on alien was so goddamn bad that he

[28:29] couldn't even sell out of the le imagine if if zombie yeti did like a Geiger style play field and

[28:37] hand drew the whole thing you guys would have stopped at nothing to get that game or lease now I'm

[28:43] happy where zombie yeti is at he's finally I feel like his ship is finally coming in in the pinball

[28:49] world he's finally on a game where the game is great the game looks phenomenal and it's going to go

[28:56] down as one of the I think the best pinball machines in the last decade I don't think people would

[29:02] argue with me on that I don't think it's too early to call that I just haven't seen this kind of praise

[29:07] from the pinball machine itself it might be coming too much of a shield of iron maiden you guys have

[29:13] to tell me but I don't know I'm just excited I'm excited for this game I'm excited and I actually

[29:19] have real second thoughts about selling it I really do think I may want to keep this one and put

[29:25] it next to Batman I think a Batman SLE in an Iron Maiden Ellie could be the best of both worlds I

[29:31] think that the two games complement each other so nicely when it comes to gameplay that that

[29:36] might be just what I do but don't tell Brenda that because I need to pay for a wedding in December

[29:44] alright everyone have a great day have a great day and try not to be too negative because zombie

[29:51] Eddie also reads pinside and don't be a piece of shit like flinny bus and and just say stupid stuff

[29:57] without even thinking because we know that negative basement dwellers like that they actually do hurt

[30:03] the feelings of a guy like zombie Eddie who's really talented and a really good person so I

[30:10] wanted to just think about that when you lob grenades against a guy who could who could draw

[30:15] blindfolded better than flinny bus could even like draw a stick figure looking at the page all right

[30:22] have a great day everyone see you later

[30:40] assuming
