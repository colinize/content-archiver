[00:00] Dream lasts for so long, even after you're gone.

[00:08] I know you love me and so you will see what meant for me.

[00:17] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:21] Ah, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:25] Everybody, I've got one question for you today.

[00:28] How many boutique pinball companies have failed?

[00:31] How many?

[00:32] How many do you think?

[00:33] Turn to your kids, turn to your wife, ask yourself how many boutique pinball companies

[00:38] have failed and how many have succeeded?

[00:41] Now the reason I'm going to do this show is because I'm starting to see some similarities

[00:46] in all of these companies that have thrown their hat into the pinball ring and we've

[00:50] seen it time and time again.

[00:53] And for some crazy reason, when I give you the number of the amount of pinball boutique

[00:58] companies that have been unsuccessful in creating a sustainable, profitable pinball company,

[01:06] for some reason every time a new company pops up, we think they're going to succeed.

[01:12] And at what point as a community are we going to start using logic and common sense and

[01:17] just look at the numbers, look at the data, look at the chances of success and failure

[01:23] in this hobby and then look at the companies that are succeeding in pinball and look at

[01:29] how they're doing things.

[01:31] And I think here's what happens.

[01:32] I think that everyone in pinball is passionate.

[01:36] I think everybody that starts a pinball company is passionate.

[01:41] I think everyone who says, I'm going to make a pinball machine and a new game and a new

[01:46] company and I'm going to bring something different to pinball.

[01:50] I think everybody, I mean this, everyone goes into it with good intentions.

[01:56] And for the most part, the people behind all these startup pinball companies have been

[02:02] good people.

[02:03] They've been nice people, not everybody, but most of them.

[02:07] And so even so, most of them fail.

[02:10] And I'm going to give you what that number is and it's going to shock you.

[02:13] What's even more shocking than the number is this community's never ending desire to

[02:20] get behind and back and say that everything is going to work out because what could possibly

[02:27] go wrong?

[02:28] And the story that I've seen time and time again is this.

[02:31] It's two things that come together and I mean it.

[02:34] And the two things are this.

[02:35] It's passion and delusion.

[02:38] And I mean it.

[02:39] And I know delusion is a strident word, but I think what happens with all of these startup

[02:44] pinball companies, they're very passionate about pinball and they have good intentions,

[02:49] but when it comes to making the product and doing all of the heavy lifting required to

[02:55] turning your dream into a manufactured product that is certified, that's not going to burn

[03:01] someone's house down, that has all the elements needed so that you can safely put a pinball

[03:07] machine into someone's home or bar or restaurant or basement, I think when they realize everything

[03:12] that has to go into it, I think when they see all that stuff, they still say to themselves,

[03:18] we're going to do it.

[03:19] Like we're going to make it happen and that's where they get delusional.

[03:23] And it's weird because it's almost like the bigger their passion becomes, the bigger the

[03:27] delusion becomes and they start to think, if I can just get games out, everything will

[03:33] work out and we've seen this time and time again and many of them have come close to

[03:38] getting games out.

[03:40] Some have even gotten a game or two out, but that doesn't change the fact that to be a

[03:46] successful company in pinball, you need to have your manufacturing turned on more days

[03:54] than it's turned off.

[03:55] And it's just that simple, not even more days, you almost need to have your line going five

[04:01] days a week or else you will be losing money every time games are not on the line and going

[04:09] out the door.

[04:10] And I'm seeing some similarities again between Haggis Pinball and Highway Pinball and I'm

[04:15] going to point out what they are at the end of this show and I'm going to read for you

[04:19] a story and I'm not making this story up.

[04:22] This is a story from a media outlet in Australia when Haggis Pinball sort of announced Fathom

[04:29] a year ago and I want to read that story for you and I want us to ask ourselves, doesn't

[04:34] a lot of this narrative sound a lot like the other boutique pinball companies that threw

[04:40] their hat into the ring?

[04:42] So I asked you how many boutique pinball companies do you think have failed?

[04:47] Do you have the number in your head?

[04:49] Let's count right now company by company all the boutique pinball companies that have failed

[04:54] to be successful.

[04:56] Now let's start with the ones that have just been dire failures over the years.

[05:00] Deeproot Pinball, Zidware, SkipBee, Circus Maximus, Team Pinball, Pinball Adventures,

[05:07] Suncoast Pinball, Home Pin, Dutch Pinball, Highway Pinball, right there I have counted

[05:14] 10 companies, 10 companies that have failed to be successful in pinball, 10 and I could

[05:22] go on to add a few more to that list.

[05:24] You could also probably add pinball brothers to the list.

[05:28] Have they been a very successful pinball company?

[05:30] So those tend to me, right?

[05:32] Those tend to me have been complete failures in the pinball space 10.

[05:36] Now how many have been somewhat successful?

[05:39] I would say P3 Multimorphic and American Pinball have been somewhat successful.

[05:45] If you were to ask me there's only one, one true boutique company that has really achieved

[05:52] any success and that is Spooky Pinball.

[05:55] So one out of 13 or 15 companies has actually figured it out and then when you look at Spooky

[06:03] Pinball as a company, how did they figure it out?

[06:07] They released America's Most Haunted.

[06:09] They made 150 of them.

[06:12] They learned a lot about how to make the game but they had like no overhead.

[06:16] This is the biggest part.

[06:18] Spooky Pinball had almost no overhead.

[06:21] They didn't have rent.

[06:22] You got to go back and look at their story.

[06:25] They had so many advantages to get their company off the ground and these other companies did

[06:32] not and that is why these other companies, when they try to turn manufacturing on, they

[06:37] realized that the overhead costs to do this and to do it five days a week and to sell

[06:44] hundreds of games a year and then you got to keep that line going indefinitely to stay

[06:50] in business and stay profitable, it starts to feel like a nightmare and so nobody has

[06:56] the advantages that Spooky does.

[06:58] And then when you look at companies like CGC and Jersey Jack Pinball, I mean they're

[07:03] financed by outside income and revenue.

[07:06] I mean CGC is financed by Churchill Cabinets who makes so much money.

[07:11] This is a side project.

[07:13] American Pinball is financed by Ame Tron.

[07:16] They're not really profitable or that successful and then Jersey Jack Pinball famously went

[07:21] bankrupt a few times and now they've got the abyss money keeping them alive.

[07:26] You see what I mean?

[07:27] Spooky Pinball is really the only ground up from day one by the bootstraps made it.

[07:33] So when you look at this hobby and you look at this desire to have boutique companies

[07:39] enter into Pinball, what does the data show us?

[07:43] That the chances of failure are far greater than the chances of success and it doesn't

[07:48] matter how passionate you are about Pinball.

[07:52] None of that matters.

[07:53] What it comes down to ultimately is that making Pinball is incredibly hard.

[07:59] It is one of the hardest things and most complex things you can try to make.

[08:05] So it always begs the question, why do these people even get into it?

[08:09] Why?

[08:10] Out of all of the things that you could do, out of all of the businesses that you could

[08:15] turn on and easily make a profit, right?

[08:19] The amount of businesses you could start with the amount of capital needed to start a Pinball

[08:24] company, you could easily put your money into things that require so much less effort and

[08:32] would get you a much better return.

[08:34] That's the other crazy part.

[08:36] The return on the investment, the margins in Pinball are terrible for the amount of

[08:42] work it takes to make these machines.

[08:45] They're absolutely terrible and that is why we're seeing companies like raise the prices

[08:49] because the amount of effort is crazy.

[08:52] So if you can actually put a game in a box, you've got to recoup and you've got to make

[08:58] enough money to keep the company viable.

[09:01] And that is why I actually think the delusion circle, the delusion gene is strong in all

[09:07] of these people who decide to make Pinball companies because you almost have to be delusional

[09:13] when you look at these numbers and then you say, well, we can figure it out.

[09:17] We can do it.

[09:18] Look, I applaud all of these Pinball beauty companies who are passionate and jump in and

[09:24] say we're going to figure it out.

[09:26] But it just so happens that the majority of them never did figure it out.

[09:30] And it's sad.

[09:31] I mean, look, we have at least 10 companies that failed horribly at it and then another

[09:35] five or so that are on the brink.

[09:37] You know, I would love to see like if there's even a lot of profit over at companies like

[09:41] Multimorphic and American Pinball and Pinball Brothers, right?

[09:45] Dutch Pinball?

[09:46] Are they really making money?

[09:48] So here's what scares me about this hobby is if you try to ask questions and you try

[09:53] to prod some of these companies, you are immediately labeled as someone who's not championing the

[10:00] expansion of Pinball.

[10:02] And I want to say this and I mean this.

[10:04] We don't need boutique Pinball at all.

[10:06] We don't.

[10:07] We have a company called Stern Pinball.

[10:10] We don't need boutique Pinball.

[10:12] You know it.

[10:13] I know it.

[10:14] We're so tired of this narrative that we need to expand Pinball with boutique companies.

[10:20] The truth is that's a lie.

[10:22] That Stern Pinball does not need any help expanding Pinball.

[10:26] Without Stern Pinball, it would all go away, right?

[10:28] But we've got Stern.

[10:30] We've got CGC.

[10:31] We've got Jersey Jack.

[10:33] We've got spooky.

[10:34] We've got American Pinball.

[10:35] We've got Multimorphic.

[10:37] How many more do we need?

[10:39] How many more are going to make us feel good?

[10:41] And so look, when Damien started Haggis Pinball, it's great.

[10:44] Like good.

[10:45] He built a game.

[10:46] He showed us the most important thing.

[10:48] He knew how to build a game.

[10:50] And there is a lot.

[10:52] And I mean this.

[10:53] There's a lot of respect that he deserves for building Celts.

[10:57] And not just building Celts, it is a very well-built game.

[11:01] But, but from there, what's happening now?

[11:06] And that's the point.

[11:07] We've seen this before.

[11:09] We've seen companies get one game out and then they struggle.

[11:13] Game two, they get more orders.

[11:15] In fact, getting a lot of orders for companies like this that aren't used to making volume.

[11:22] They're not used to making this many games.

[11:24] Then you throw in COVID.

[11:26] Then you throw in like the lockdowns from Australia.

[11:29] Then you throw in the fact that most of the people who make parts for these things are

[11:33] in Chicago and in America.

[11:35] And so then it becomes a really difficult task to get every single part in-house before

[11:42] you can start making these games.

[11:44] But here's the thing.

[11:45] The similarities are almost uncanny.

[11:49] All of these companies, it's not just Highway.

[11:51] It's not just Haggis.

[11:52] Here's the mistake they all make.

[11:54] And I've seen it.

[11:55] And I've been covering this hobby for six years now.

[11:59] They all take premature victory laps.

[12:02] They all start to talk about how they're going to be a company that brings pinball back.

[12:07] They're going to be a company that brings new design and innovation to pinball.

[12:11] And the world is excited about pinball again.

[12:14] And they're going to be there to serve up pinball machines to the masses.

[12:18] Let me read for you a story that ran in the Star News or the Cranbourne News, which I'm

[12:22] guessing is a media outlet in Australia.

[12:25] This story ran on May 18th of 2021.

[12:29] So almost a year ago.

[12:30] And it's titled Our Pinball Wizards.

[12:33] And there's a nice picture of Damien and Marty standing by Kelts and Fathom.

[12:38] And the picture says this.

[12:40] Martin, game designer, and Damien CEO show off their waves.

[12:45] Let's read this story.

[12:46] And I'm going to stop throughout it and just explain how we've seen this tale before.

[12:52] It starts out, remember pinball question mark?

[12:56] Just the word itself has the power to summon vivid memories of those dings, rattles, lights,

[13:02] and flashes.

[13:03] But they're not just a thing of the past.

[13:05] Pinball is back in a big way.

[13:08] And a Cranbourne based company is riding the wave of the pinball resurgence.

[13:13] Damien Hardin founded Haggis Pinball two years ago to put the country back on the map

[13:18] as a serious player in the industry.

[13:21] Okay, let's stop right there for a minute.

[13:24] Is Australia ever a serious player in the pinball industry?

[13:29] Am I missing something?

[13:30] Was there a period in which all these games were made in Australia at some point in time?

[13:34] Okay, we'll keep going.

[13:36] Haggis' game designer, Martin Robbins, said Mr. Hardin, a massive fan of the silver ball,

[13:42] created the company from scratch and learned all he needed to produce the machines.

[13:48] Mr. Robbins used to run pinball tournaments and met Mr. Hardin at one of these.

[13:53] The pair got talking and soon were working together on Haggis' machines.

[13:57] Haggis was named for Mr. Martin's Scottish heritage and in fact the company's first

[14:02] machine named Kelts celebrated the Scottish Highland Games.

[14:06] The second game has just been launched.

[14:09] Fathom revisited a modern twist on a 1981 classic.

[14:14] Mr. Robbins said the nostalgia factor might be one reason behind the recent pinball resurgence

[14:20] as people turn to hobbies they remember and love from their younger days.

[14:25] We're part of this movement of bringing pinball back, Mr. Robbins said.

[14:30] I want to stop there again because I heard this.

[14:32] How many times are we going to hear this?

[14:34] That we're part of the reason pinball is coming back.

[14:38] You've sold how many Kelts?

[14:40] How many fathoms?

[14:41] How many of them are out in the world?

[14:43] Stern makes more pinball machines in two days than they've ever made of Kelts.

[14:49] And I know this seems a little bit harsh but I'm just at the point now when I read these

[14:54] things and I didn't see this story a year ago but when I read this stuff do you see

[14:58] what I'm talking about?

[14:59] That combination of passion which we're clearly getting from this story and delusion that

[15:05] we are part of this movement of bringing pinball back.

[15:09] No, you're not.

[15:11] You're not part of it.

[15:12] You won't be part of it until you make hundreds if not thousands of machines.

[15:18] Pinball is back.

[15:19] It's been back.

[15:20] It's been so successful over the last few years that Stern can't even catch up on orders.

[15:26] Marty then goes on to say, we have to pinch ourselves every day that we're working on

[15:30] something we absolutely love.

[15:32] Haggis is positioning itself to square up to the big boys from the US.

[15:38] The pinball industry is currently dominated by US companies like Stern.

[15:42] Okay, I mean this is the part.

[15:44] They're positioning itself to square up to the big boys from the US.

[15:49] Are they?

[15:50] Legitimate, this is in the story.

[15:52] I am not making this stuff up.

[15:54] How are they squaring up against Stern, against CGC, against Jersey Jack, against even Spooky?

[16:02] How are they squaring up against any of these companies?

[16:05] And again, remember this story came out and this positioning came out a year ago when

[16:10] they only sold a handful of Celts when they hadn't made a single fathom but yet they're

[16:16] squaring up to go against the US big boys.

[16:19] Yeah, I get it.

[16:20] You got a big factory.

[16:21] You got a lot of heavy equipment.

[16:23] You got a lot of dreams and aspirations and you got a ton of passion.

[16:27] The delusion is there, right?

[16:28] It's the same delusion that hits everybody.

[16:30] Now they go on to say it's been a tough 12 months owing to the pandemic but Haggis has

[16:35] made it through and has just moved into a new larger factory.

[16:40] They hope to continue that growth and create more local jobs as they release new games.

[16:46] COVID impacted us a lot, Mr. Robbins explained.

[16:49] Not being able to come into the factory to do work has caused some delays.

[16:54] Sourcing supplies from around the world became a bit of a challenge but like other companies,

[16:58] we embraced Zoom.

[17:00] We took advantage of the time to streamline our manufacturing processes and spend time

[17:06] designing the game.

[17:07] Okay, now I read this.

[17:09] This is from May of 2021.

[17:12] They still haven't shipped one fathom.

[17:15] One fathom.

[17:16] So something clearly wasn't figured out.

[17:19] Something clearly wasn't streamlined and something clearly got in the way over and over and over

[17:25] again.

[17:26] The story goes on.

[17:27] The majority of development on fathom revisited happened during COVID.

[17:32] Out of the challenges we had with COVID, we were able to take the time to re-engineer a

[17:37] lot of things and come out as a well-known pinball manufacturer with a global presence.

[17:43] If you have a thread on pinside, are you now a global presence?

[17:46] Is that how it works?

[17:47] I mean, all over the world, people know who Haggis Pinball is.

[17:50] I mean, come on.

[17:51] Again, this is it.

[17:52] This is the part that I just, it's just like you pat yourself on the back.

[17:56] You take victory laps.

[17:57] You use hyperbole like this.

[17:59] You're not a global presence.

[18:01] So I get it.

[18:02] I get what they're saying.

[18:04] They've shipped some Celts all over the world and everyone in the pinball community knows

[18:08] who they are now.

[18:09] So while this is not inaccurate, it does read like you're bigger than you are.

[18:15] You're not there yet.

[18:16] Let me ask you guys a question.

[18:18] Was spooky talking like this between America's most haunted and Rob Zombie?

[18:23] Were they talking like this?

[18:24] No.

[18:25] They read spooky interviews after America's most haunted because that's where Haggis is

[18:29] after Celts.

[18:30] Now go read the difference of how they're speaking about themselves.

[18:34] Spooky was just like humbled and thankful to survive and they realized like how hard

[18:39] it was.

[18:40] I'm just not sure if Haggis took the right amount of steps the way spooky did or if they

[18:45] leaped forward too fast and if their ambitions and their passions got ahead of their abilities.

[18:52] It then goes on to say and when COVID is over, Mr. Robbins hopes that Haggis will be able

[18:57] to host its own pinball tournament.

[19:00] Already the company is a big supporter of his own competitions.

[19:04] Mr. Robbins said thousands can attend these tournaments, often whole families sharing

[19:10] in a favorite hobby.

[19:11] To see children now into pinball is so exciting.

[19:15] My hope is everybody understands that pinball is back, is as exciting as it was and in some

[19:21] ways is better due to new technologies like video screens.

[19:25] The pinball scene in Australia around the world is really social.

[19:29] It's a great way to connect with people.

[19:31] Well, I agree with you on that, Marty.

[19:33] It is back.

[19:34] It is a great way to connect with people and he's right.

[19:38] And this story is not inaccurate.

[19:40] This story is simply reminding me of what we've heard from other pinball companies who had

[19:47] the same passion.

[19:49] They had the same narrative.

[19:50] All these narratives are the same.

[19:52] All these stories are the same.

[19:54] And I know I just read you a Haggis media story, but you could just take Haggis and

[19:59] replace it with Circus Maximus people, with Pinball Adventures people, with Suncoast Pinball

[20:06] people, with Home Pin.

[20:08] The story is always the same.

[20:10] The story is always the same.

[20:12] And you might be wondering like, why are you even talking about Haggis again?

[20:16] Like why?

[20:17] Why are you going back to this narrative?

[20:19] And I'll tell you why.

[20:20] I want to do these stories until they show us an update, until they give us a video tour

[20:27] of what's going on.

[20:29] I have done my show this way since the beginning.

[20:32] This is what I do.

[20:33] This is what I do on this show.

[20:35] This is what I'm passionate about.

[20:36] I'm passionate about giving my opinions of the games that come out, but I'm also passionate

[20:41] about holding these companies accountable.

[20:43] The same way I'm going to hold Mirko accountable when he comes to TPF and gets up on stage

[20:49] and wants to talk about his playfield process.

[20:51] I'm going to ask him what happened with Guns N' Roses?

[20:56] What happened with the last Jersey Jack games?

[20:59] And has he fixed the problem?

[21:02] Because this hobby and this community, it can be the greatest at times, but it also

[21:07] can be like a community that just stops thinking critically and stops asking questions.

[21:14] If I could give any advice to all these startup companies, it's the same advice.

[21:19] Just stop talking.

[21:21] Give updates to your customers at least once a month.

[21:25] Don't take people's money and then go radio silent.

[21:30] That's never cool.

[21:31] And you shouldn't be doing it to shut up a loudmouth podcaster in New York City.

[21:36] You owe your customers updates.

[21:38] You took their money.

[21:40] And everybody knows this, that your money did not go to your fathom game yet because

[21:46] the games are not built.

[21:48] And all of us need to learn a lesson here.

[21:50] Don't buy a pinball machine unless it's built or it's from a company that you know can build

[21:56] hundreds of games because the scenarios aren't great.

[21:59] You're either going to get your game, but it's going to be significantly delayed.

[22:02] You might not get your game.

[22:04] And that's like the scary part to me is like this community for some reason doesn't even

[22:08] want to think about that.

[22:09] They don't even want to say that, that, oh, there's a chance you might not get your game.

[22:13] And it's not me making up this controversial narrative.

[22:17] I just told you 10 companies that had the same passion, that had the same desire to be

[22:23] successful in the boutique pinball space.

[22:26] And there really only is one that's ever done it successfully and done it for years.

[22:31] And that's spooky.

[22:32] So what's different?

[22:33] Like am I just being a jerk?

[22:35] What's different about this new company that's going to make it successful?

[22:40] What advantages does Haggis have over spooky?

[22:44] What advantage do they have being all the way over in Australia?

[22:48] I know they've got the passion and I know Damien is smart.

[22:51] Like he figured out how to make Celts, but it's not just about making Celts.

[22:57] It's about this is it.

[22:59] Like you're making a pinball company.

[23:01] You've got Marty on your staff.

[23:03] You're paying him money.

[23:04] He's now saying he's a game designer.

[23:06] So you got to pay him to design the game.

[23:08] His game is not Centaur.

[23:10] It's not the next remake.

[23:12] So you are setting up a company to make multiple games, not just game one or two, but three,

[23:18] four, five.

[23:20] Can you be successful and get to five games if your company can't keep the line on consistently?

[23:26] And that's the part that just makes me nervous.

[23:29] And no one wants to talk about it.

[23:31] Everybody does their victory laps.

[23:32] Damien says, Canada's toxic.

[23:34] Canada's bad for the hobby.

[23:35] Canada's not cheerleading every single thing that happens.

[23:38] Stern Pinball, they paid their dues.

[23:41] They made it through the hardest period and they came out on top.

[23:45] They're the only global pinball company.

[23:47] They're the only company that has brought pinball back.

[23:50] They're the only company that has expanded pinball.

[23:54] Everybody else is hanging on to the crumbs of Stern Pinball.

[23:57] And you know that now.

[23:59] Stern Pinball can also get cheap.

[24:01] They can cut corners.

[24:02] And I don't like the fact that Stern Pinball games are this much money for what they give

[24:06] you.

[24:07] So I'm happy there's a Jersey Jack pinball, which brought a lot of innovations to pinball.

[24:12] If it wasn't for Jersey Jack pinball, we wouldn't get what we now get in a Stern machine.

[24:17] So competition is good.

[24:18] I'm glad Chicago Gaming Company is bringing back some of these epic titles from yesteryears

[24:23] because people used to have to spend like $15,000 on a good restored HEP version of

[24:29] those games.

[24:30] Sadly now because the inventory is so light.

[24:32] Nowadays like a medieval madness from CTC is actually more money than it was back in

[24:37] the day.

[24:38] Back when we were buying restored ones.

[24:39] I'm happy that Spooky's around.

[24:41] I love the Spooky story.

[24:43] Now Spooky's got to grow up and mature and hire better people and get their games more

[24:48] polished.

[24:49] I think Spooky's taken advantage of all the goodwill they've built.

[24:53] And I think their recent releases are a little bit of a let down.

[24:55] I think those games never should have gone out the way they did and I think they've lost

[24:59] a lot of the talent that put Spooky where they are.

[25:02] You know everyone else is trying to find relevancy.

[25:05] Everyone else is trying to find customers on a consistent basis.

[25:09] We finally get a P3 multi-morphic title that excites people.

[25:13] That's great.

[25:14] American Pinball.

[25:15] I'm excited for the Dennis Nordman game.

[25:17] I'm not excited for Legends of Ahalo, but it is what it is.

[25:20] I don't think Spinal Tap's going to be any good.

[25:23] And then that's it.

[25:24] We've got Fathom from Haggis and then there's nothing else.

[25:27] But how much pinball do we need, right?

[25:29] How much pinball do we need?

[25:31] I get nervous when people try to shut down an analysis of what is happening over there.

[25:37] They said they were going to go into production in January and now it's like March 10th and

[25:42] we still have not got an update.

[25:44] And I know what they're going to try to do and make TPF a moment, but it's not about

[25:48] that.

[25:49] I just want to see this company talk to its customers and talk to the community.

[25:54] And I know most of you don't care.

[25:56] Most of you are not in on Fathom.

[25:58] I have almost twice as many Canadian club members as Fathom Mermaid Editions that sold.

[26:03] On some twisted level, I'm even more popular than some of these boutique companies.

[26:08] But I'm always going to do shows like these because we need to ask these questions.

[26:13] Let me know what you guys think.

[26:14] Is this being too harsh?

[26:15] Should I just be like, you know what?

[26:16] Forget it.

[26:17] Let them figure it out and that's that.

[26:19] Now also, like there's not a ton of pinball content right now.

[26:21] I'm just waiting for Toy Story.

[26:24] Once Toy Story hits, I can't wait to just either gush over it or commit pinball Harry

[26:29] Carrie because I can't believe they messed up Toy Story.

[26:32] Everybody, this has been Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[26:35] Just ask the questions.

[26:36] Don't fold like lawn chairs.

[26:38] Like let's keep these companies accountable together later.

[26:49] I was meant for you.
