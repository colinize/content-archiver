[00:00] Remember only God could judge you, forget the haters, cause somebody loves you

[00:06] And everyone in line in the bathroom, try to get a line in the bathroom

[00:12] We also turn up here, get a start up, yeah

[00:17] Hey, boy

[00:18] You know, you got to go, you got to go, you got to go, you got to go, you got to go

[00:23] Welcome to episode, what are we at now?

[00:25] episode 636 of Canada's Pinball podcast, I'm your host, canada, happy new years, everybody

[00:32] I hope each and every one of you had a great holiday and an amazing new year

[00:37] Now it is with a very sad and somber note that we start the new year in the Pinball community

[00:42] We've lost one of the greatest members of the New York Pinball scene, the northeast pinball scene

[00:47] But just the pinball scene in general, because when you're in the pinball

[00:50] You're not just an East Coast or a West Coast person, you're part of the whole global pinball community

[00:55] And you might have known him as Al Pinball Al

[00:58] I think you say his last name Al Seahawk

[01:00] And Al was always somebody that was ever present in my pinball scene in New York

[01:05] He was always hanging out at modern pinball, he was an operator of pinball machines all over the city

[01:11] And just an amazing guy, an amazing guy, and for those of you who knew Al

[01:15] You knew how sweet he was, how big his heart was, and Al unfortunately passed away in his sleep just a day ago

[01:23] So I want to say with heavy hearts, we will miss you Al, we love you, and thank you so much for all you did in pinball

[01:29] I could tell a bunch of Al stories, but the ones that always ring true in my mind

[01:33] are when Al would come and work on my machines

[01:36] And he would always be so great, he would always lend a helping hand

[01:39] He would always give me his insights onto what he thought was wrong with my game

[01:43] But here was always the crazy part, right? If you were a collector and Al came over to work on your machine

[01:48] Now Al needed a cane to walk around

[01:50] And his cane was always all over the place

[01:53] And so there he is, he's like lifting the hood on a pinball machine

[01:56] And his cane is like banging into your cabinet and I will say this

[02:00] For the amount of times I was nervous that Al's cane would put a huge scratch in my pinball cabinet

[02:06] It never did

[02:07] But I will say it was always like the most nerve-wracking moments when Al was working on machines

[02:11] And he was just like, oh my god, I can't believe this thing is flying all over these like rare precious cabinets

[02:17] Anyway, Al, we will miss you, we definitely love you, we will miss you

[02:21] And we definitely all have to raise a glass and celebrate Al next time we all get together

[02:26] Maybe we should do like a commemorative drink

[02:28] I'm going to talk to John over at Jack Bar for Al

[02:30] So every time anyone goes there, we can order a special dedicated to him

[02:34] So we're one day away from Rush Pinball

[02:37] And Canate is going to do what Canate does best

[02:39] I'm going to give you some details I've been hearing in the rumor mill about Rush Pinball machine

[02:44] And we will see which one of these rumors come true and come to fruition

[02:48] But you know, this is what I do

[02:50] People talk to me, people still share information with Canate even though I am behind that vicious pay wall

[02:57] Is five bucks a month too much to hear this news, so here we go

[03:00] So Rush Pinball was worked on with the two surviving members of Rush

[03:04] I don't really know the members of Rush, so I don't know which two are still surviving

[03:08] But they worked on the game closely with Stern Pinball

[03:11] I'm also hearing that Mr. Ed Robertson was heavily involved in this project with Rush

[03:16] And it makes sense, right? Because if you're a famous Canadian artist

[03:20] You really have to hang out and be friends with other famous Canadian artists

[03:25] Like I'm not sure, but it might not just have been Ed Robertson in this studio with Rush doing the callouts for the game

[03:31] We might also get some Brian Adams and Celine Dion in this game as well

[03:35] Because they all have to be friends with each other

[03:38] So I'm hearing Ed Robertson worked on this game with them as well

[03:41] He might even make an appearance in the game doing callouts

[03:45] But I think that's a great addition to this game because Ed Robertson knows so much about Pinball

[03:50] He knows so much about what makes a Pinball machine exciting and fun

[03:54] And we all know this, when someone is doing callouts for a Pinball machine

[03:58] They need direction

[03:59] And Stern can sometimes do really piss poor direction on callouts

[04:03] When they're working with like talent

[04:05] So I really hope Ed told these guys

[04:07] Like don't just say jackpot

[04:09] Say jackpot!

[04:11] You know, so we'll see, we'll see

[04:13] But I think Ed Robertson will be in the game

[04:15] That is a rumor that I am hearing

[04:17] Alright, what else is going on?

[04:19] Well it's gonna have the 17 songs like we mentioned earlier

[04:22] This game is gonna be fully theming a grade it with the band

[04:26] It isn't like they're licensing this band or their music or their image

[04:30] The band worked directly on this Pinball machine just like slash worked with Eric on G&R over at JJP

[04:38] So expect this to be one of the greatest theme integrated Pinball machines that Stern has put out

[04:44] So that is gonna be something that is gonna be exciting to rush fans that are out there

[04:48] Now what else am I hearing about this game?

[04:50] So we've speculated for a while that this game has a very large circular mechanism in the middle of the game

[04:57] And I am hearing that that is not only true but it is a time machine

[05:02] And the major mech in Rush Pinball will be a time machine

[05:06] But here's where it gets really cool

[05:08] So it's a big circular mech

[05:10] And I hear it might grab the ball

[05:12] Allah, Lord of the Rings sort of ring

[05:15] Like have magnets around it

[05:17] And freeze the ball in midair

[05:19] And shoot the ball out into the time machine

[05:22] And so that is what I'm hearing will be the major mech

[05:25] Very cool, you know I love toys, you know I love magnets, you know I love Lord of the Rings

[05:30] So to see this mech maybe made bigger in a Rush Pinball machine is very cool

[05:35] And the way it's gonna work, the way this game is gonna work, the storyline of the game

[05:39] Is you're gonna be able to travel through the different periods in which Rush made music and play songs from those periods

[05:46] So you're gonna go from what? The 70s, the 80s, the 90s

[05:49] You know I think they're still making music into the 2000s

[05:52] So this is gonna be how the game sort of works

[05:55] Will it be like a concert in a box like Guns and Roses?

[05:59] I don't think so I think it's gonna be more about going back and playing songs from different errors

[06:03] That's much different than what Guns and Roses was trying to do

[06:06] Which is actually put the elements of going to a G&R show under the glass

[06:11] So kind of an original theme, right?

[06:13] I don't think I've seen another music pin in which you travel through a time machine to play music from the bands different errors

[06:19] So very, very cool approach to a music pin if you ask me

[06:23] I'm also hearing this as a John Borg pin

[06:25] So you're gonna get a lot of like these ramps and wire forms and plastic ramps that elevate off the play field

[06:32] And you're gonna get swooping ramps and habit trails

[06:35] So this thing is gonna look, I heard a lot like Ninja Turtles

[06:38] Where the ball is gonna be going up and whipping around the entire play field

[06:42] So there's gonna be a lot of that

[06:43] What I like about Borg's designs is they come up off the play field

[06:47] They're not flat like Led Zeppelin

[06:49] I think this game is gonna have a lot of dimension to it

[06:52] So that's another cool thing

[06:54] So you're gonna see that I just want to say for the record

[06:56] I haven't seen this game yet

[06:58] So I don't know

[06:59] I'm hearing there might also be like a clock

[07:01] That's a drum set

[07:02] I don't know

[07:03] I'm just hearing elements of this game

[07:05] I haven't seen anything

[07:06] I haven't seen any materials from Stern Pinball

[07:09] I'm just going off of some rumors that people on Facebook are saying

[07:12] And I'm reading through Pinside

[07:14] And I'm sort of cobbling together if you will

[07:17] The consistent rumors I'm hearing over and over

[07:19] We'll see if Canadian's right

[07:21] Now, there is a big butt coming

[07:23] And I've talked to a few people

[07:25] And everyone I've talked to has this big butt

[07:28] And I'm gonna tell you what the big butt is

[07:30] And it's not my big butt

[07:32] Okay, the big butt is this

[07:34] The big butt in Rush Pinball

[07:36] When I talk to people

[07:37] And they're like, yes, it's this

[07:39] It's that butt

[07:40] There's this issue with the game

[07:42] The number one issue with the game

[07:44] And I want to apologize to Brian Allen

[07:46] Who is a very talented artist

[07:48] Because I heard a rumor that Brian Allen was doing Rush

[07:51] That is not happening

[07:53] So please disregard that rumor

[07:55] The big butt I'm hearing on Rush Pinball

[07:58] Is that the art package on this game is bad

[08:02] And I mean like people that are normally like

[08:05] Yeah, it's okay

[08:06] Like if you're a Rush Pin

[08:07] No, I'm hearing that it is pretty bad

[08:10] And that seems to be the Achilles heel

[08:12] Maybe of this game

[08:14] I'm hearing that the color choices are a little strange

[08:17] That maybe the Ellie is a darker palette

[08:19] Kind of like a Houdini kind of

[08:21] Steam punk color to the game

[08:23] But I'm also hearing it's illustrated

[08:25] Right? So there's not like Photoshop, drag, and drop images of the band

[08:29] But the way they illustrated the characters in the band

[08:32] Is not gonna blow you away

[08:34] I'm hearing it might be more like the way they drew guns and roses

[08:37] Members and data East GNR

[08:39] Right? Very like Sharpie looking

[08:41] Not highly detailed

[08:43] So is this gonna be true

[08:45] And it's kind of ironic

[08:47] Because Rush was always a band that was never about flashiness

[08:51] It was never about sexiness

[08:53] It was never about image

[08:55] So maybe Rush fans are gonna think this is awesome

[08:58] That the game might be ugly

[09:00] Because this band was never about sexy album covers

[09:03] It was always about the music

[09:05] So is this what you're gonna get?

[09:07] Are you literally gonna get an ugly Rush machine

[09:10] That has a lot of soul

[09:12] That has the best drummer ever in music

[09:14] But I don't know, I would argue

[09:16] That everybody wants their pinball machines to aesthetically be beautiful

[09:20] That when we saw stuff like the blue on Led Zeppelin

[09:23] We were like what is this?

[09:25] And we know that Stern can either

[09:28] Hit it out of the park with their art packages

[09:31] Or they can miss terribly

[09:33] But the thing is Stern hasn't really missed terribly in a long time

[09:37] Led Zeppelin was definitely a miss

[09:39] It was definitely lazy

[09:41] But I'm hearing this could be

[09:43] One of the biggest head scratcher art packages

[09:46] We've seen from Stern pinball in a long time

[09:49] And I do think it's a shame

[09:51] Because if there's one thing you can't change

[09:54] If there's one thing the mod community can't fix

[09:57] It's a bad art package

[09:59] And if the play field art isn't good

[10:01] And the side cabinet artwork is not good

[10:04] Then I think that's gonna make people be like

[10:06] I might not want to put this ugly duckling in my row of Stern machines

[10:10] And Stern machines are usually colorful and beautiful for the most part

[10:13] I mean they've made some pretty nice looking machines over the last few years

[10:17] The other rumor I'm hearing is this

[10:19] Is that you're not even gonna know who the artist is

[10:22] This is a brand new artist

[10:24] And you might not even know who it is

[10:26] They might not even be crediting this artist

[10:28] The way they do zombie Yeti

[10:30] And the way they do other artists who have worked on their games

[10:33] I mean even Johnny Crap got credited

[10:35] I don't know maybe Stern's trying to hide the fact of who did this

[10:38] But we shall see

[10:39] The other part is this

[10:40] I haven't seen it

[10:41] And all art is subjective

[10:43] But I've heard from multiple sources that have seen this game

[10:46] That artistically it might make people scratch their heads

[10:50] Now again I have not seen it

[10:52] You know I'm a man of great artistic taste

[10:54] And if I saw this

[10:55] I would give you my point of view on it

[10:57] And my true opinion

[10:58] But here's the good news

[10:59] We're all gonna be able to see it tomorrow

[11:01] But I'm nervous

[11:02] I'm nervous about what this game is gonna look like

[11:04] Here's the last final detail I want to give you on this game

[11:07] Stern is asking people to charge more for the LEDs

[11:11] I've heard from multiple dealers now

[11:13] That Stern is saying

[11:14] Hey the pro and premium price

[11:16] Will be the same as Godzilla

[11:18] But we would like you to charge a little bit more for the LEDs

[11:21] Now I was asking a dealer of mine

[11:23] Why? Why are they doing that?

[11:25] And here is what I heard from a dealer

[11:27] I'm not gonna say what dealer it was

[11:29] And no you're never gonna guess it

[11:31] I'm hearing there might be a feature in this game

[11:33] That is only in the LE

[11:35] It will not be in the premium

[11:37] Now you could ask yourself

[11:39] What do you think that could be?

[11:41] What feature would be in the LE

[11:43] That they leave out of the premium?

[11:45] Now it's a music pin

[11:47] Now what thing did they put into Led Zeppelin that we didn't see before?

[11:51] My guess is this and this is just Canadian guessing

[11:54] I'm guessing that Stern Pinball is going to make the expression lighting system

[11:59] And that goes up the side of the cabinet

[12:01] My guess is Stern Pinball is gonna make that an exclusive item for the LE

[12:06] And that is why they're gonna try to charge more

[12:09] It is also gonna be a very I think a very divisive move

[12:13] Because Stern has never done this before

[12:15] They've never released a premium

[12:17] That doesn't have all of the features of the LE

[12:21] Now very questionable move

[12:23] This is just like Jersey Jack giving you that coma ball lock in the CE

[12:27] That they left out of the LE

[12:29] Can you hear Killian crying?

[12:31] He's not happy about this move

[12:33] Because Killian's all in on the premiums these days

[12:35] So that is my guess

[12:37] That Stern Pinball expression lighting system only in the LE

[12:39] Take that to pin side and say that is what Canada is guessing

[12:43] Alright the final point I want to make on this episode of Canadian Pinball

[12:47] Podcast I hope you're enjoying it

[12:49] Thank you guys for contributing to the show

[12:51] You knew the show wasn't gonna go away

[12:53] And now you get to enjoy it and our numbers are fine

[12:55] Our numbers are holding strong

[12:57] At the end of every month we lose a few people

[12:59] Because they realize that Patreon's gonna build them

[13:01] But then we gain a few more as well

[13:03] Here's the other part last night we learned that Jersey Jack Pinball

[13:07] After 8 and a half years of getting tech support from LTG

[13:11] Lloyd, he's been working for them

[13:13] I think for free for 8 and a half years

[13:15] They let him go from their tech support department

[13:19] Now what is going on here?

[13:21] I don't know there are two sides to every story

[13:23] But this seems to make no sense

[13:25] How do you cut a guy loose who's not costing you any money?

[13:29] I heard the only cost to them was they would give him a machine

[13:31] To figure out all the issues and to troubleshoot it

[13:33] I want to say this

[13:35] Lloyd is one of the nicest people in the community

[13:37] Butch Peel is also one of the nicest people in the community

[13:41] They are two of the greatest tech support people in the history of Pinball

[13:45] The one company that needs the most tech support out there is Jersey Jack Pinball

[13:49] And they have now cut loose

[13:51] Two of the nicest people that the community loves from tech support

[13:55] It's a bad PR move

[13:57] But I don't know both sides to this story

[13:59] But I will say this

[14:01] I do know both sides to the Butch Peel story and trust me

[14:05] You don't want to know both sides to the story

[14:09] Because once you do the company won't come out looking great

[14:13] And I tend to believe that a guy like Lloyd

[14:15] He is like the nicest most altruistic guy in the community

[14:19] He doesn't want to take money for his tech support

[14:21] He doesn't

[14:23] People wanted to set up a PayPal and a donation for him

[14:25] And he won't accept it

[14:27] So you're telling me someone with a heart like that

[14:29] That just does it because they love Pinball

[14:31] What could he have possibly done to be shown the door from Jersey Jack Pinball?

[14:37] I don't know but we will try to find out

[14:39] I'm actually going to try to get Lloyd on the show to talk about this

[14:43] I doubt he will join he's very private

[14:45] But he did come out

[14:47] And explain that this was not his choice

[14:49] And he is sort of like pretty deflated that he was shown the door after all these years

[14:55] Man it's like these dramatic moments

[14:57] They just always seem to happen in Pinball

[14:59] But if I'm Stern Pinball or American Pinball or anyone else out there if I'm American Pinball

[15:03] I feel like someone should pick up Lloyd

[15:05] Because this guy is so good

[15:07] And he definitely would be a great addition to any customer service team that is making Pinball machines

[15:13] I mean this is what you want

[15:15] Someone in the community that can help people at all hours of the night for free

[15:21] For free now I don't agree with that per se

[15:23] Like I don't I would not be giving hundreds of hours of my time for free

[15:27] When people should be getting paid

[15:29] Like Lloyd should be on the payroll for a company to do what he does

[15:33] And I'm sorry it's just the amount of money in this hobby

[15:35] The amount of money people throw at stuff

[15:37] And customer service is one of the most valuable skill sets there is in Pinball

[15:41] Many people out there would get out of this hobby if it weren't for people like Lloyd

[15:45] So I do think they deserve to benefit with their skill set and their knowledge

[15:49] But he doesn't want it and that's on him

[15:51] But you don't can do it or I stand on this

[15:53] If you're good at something in life

[15:55] If you're good at something in life

[15:57] Never give it away for free

[15:59] Everybody will see Rush tomorrow

[16:01] More to come on this game

[16:03] Happy Holidays everybody rest in peace out

[16:05] We're really going to miss you

[16:07] And I can't believe JJP cut another amazing customer service tech

[16:11] It never ceases to amaze me

[16:13] Canada out

[16:15] And we can't stop

[16:17] And we won't stop

[16:19] And a day they don't run

[16:21] And don't take nothing from nobody

[16:25] Yeah
