[00:00] Cause there ain't no party like the pre-party, and after the party, the after party, it's the parking lot party.

[00:13] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast, live on YouTube, because we all thought that Jengiz meant 9am,

[00:20] was gonna be when the pinball brothers finally revealed predator pinball to the world.

[00:26] We're all tired of the teasers, no Jengiz, we're not tired of you, we are tired of the slow rollout of this game,

[00:34] and today is finally gonna be the day where all the questions are answered.

[00:39] Is predator pinball gonna be worth it?

[00:42] Are we finally gonna see a game that has interactive mechs?

[00:45] We know Arnold is not in the game, but that gatling gun is pretty cool.

[00:50] I don't think it fires any pinballs, but it's got some cool gatling gun action.

[00:55] We've got a lot of drama brewing over in the Harry Potter thread because of artificial intelligence.

[01:02] Was AI used to generate the artwork on Harry Potter?

[01:07] Something's going on there, right?

[01:09] You see it, I see it.

[01:11] There's a dragon with like two eyes on one side.

[01:15] The crest is a little weird.

[01:16] The locomotive is all over the place.

[01:19] The castle's got all weird stuff going on.

[01:22] There's like windows coming through trees.

[01:26] What happened with the filtering of the artwork on this game?

[01:31] We're gonna talk about that.

[01:33] We're gonna talk a little bit about King Kong.

[01:35] Is that game going to have some sort of second life?

[01:39] Because I think sales have pretty much flatlined on that machine.

[01:44] Dune Pinball has a new mode out there, rescue mode.

[01:48] I want to talk about if Barrels of Fun can actually get people excited again about this game.

[01:54] And if pinball streams are the way to go.

[01:57] Because I just have to be candid.

[02:00] You ever see like a pinball stream and it's like a dude.

[02:03] He's in a dark room and one camera's on him.

[02:07] One's on the play field.

[02:08] One's on the screen of the game and it's all happening at once.

[02:12] And it is the worst way, I believe, to experience a pinball machine.

[02:17] What you really just want is someone to shoot it in a way that gets you excited.

[02:22] And you to be focused on the thing they want you to be focused on.

[02:26] Let's just start there for a minute.

[02:27] So like if you're Barrels of Fun and you're seeing all these games selling right now around you.

[02:34] And how many do you think?

[02:36] I'm on a live audience right now on YouTube.

[02:39] I'll see what these guys think.

[02:40] But how many Dune examples do you think Barrels of Fun has sold

[02:46] after the game being out for a month?

[02:48] I want to see what some people say.

[02:50] It's kind of fun doing it in a live audience like this.

[02:53] Because they can see that Canadian doesn't need much editing.

[02:56] He's got no show notes.

[02:58] How many examples of Dune pinball do you think Barrels of Fun has sold?

[03:04] I think they said they're going to make a thousand in total.

[03:07] Wasn't that the number?

[03:08] Because it wasn't 1100.

[03:10] I think it's 1000 examples of Dune pinball.

[03:13] And so how many do you think were sold since the day the game was revealed?

[03:20] Because I've got a number in my head.

[03:21] I don't know.

[03:22] I could probably just ask David.

[03:23] I'm not sure anybody will tell the truth.

[03:27] But since the game's been revealed, there's been a lot of other games, right?

[03:32] It revealed right on top of King Kong.

[03:34] You've got Predator coming out today.

[03:36] You've got Harry Potter, which is going to take the majority of pinball sales.

[03:41] You've had Portal that nobody really bought.

[03:43] Owen thinks they sold 500 dunes already?

[03:47] Owen, that's a very optimistic number.

[03:51] I don't think they sold out of half of them already.

[03:55] I would say Dune has probably sold between 200 to 300 out of 1000.

[04:02] Have you seen anybody unbox the game?

[04:06] That's the big issue.

[04:07] And so now the strategy, the only strategy left to move these games,

[04:12] because you only get one chance to make a first impression.

[04:16] The only strategy left now is to stream the game.

[04:20] And I just feel like streaming the game always, and I mean is always,

[04:26] takes some of the FOMO out of wanting to own it.

[04:30] It's kind of like you see everything.

[04:32] And if Carl's going to go through all the modes of the game and you see it,

[04:38] is it going to make you want one?

[04:40] And again, because pinball streaming is so lackluster just to begin with,

[04:44] it's literally not exciting.

[04:46] Like I don't know any other way to say it.

[04:48] Like watching someone play pinball is not exciting.

[04:51] I think it's one of the worst sales tactics there can be.

[04:55] Now look, you always want a little bit of gameplay before you order a game,

[04:59] but I believe one thing now, with where we're at in pinball,

[05:04] I believe in one thing now is the only thing you need before you order a game.

[05:10] You yourself have to walk in front of the machine and fall in love with it

[05:15] to pay these kinds of prices.

[05:17] Because remember, Dune fully loaded is somewhere around like $13,000 plus.

[05:23] With the top, or it's going to be like $14,000.

[05:25] And so yeah, you got to play it yourself.

[05:28] The days of needing to order these games right away on week one in the first month are over.

[05:35] So everyone needs to go find a Dune and play it.

[05:38] Now that's problematic because most people don't have access to a Dune machine.

[05:43] I don't even have one over at Automated and he carries barrels of fun machines.

[05:49] I should ask Mike when he's going to get it,

[05:51] but I think it's going to be a very, very slow burn for this game.

[05:55] And the big issue surrounding Dune, just hovering over it, is this.

[06:02] You don't care about the theme.

[06:04] And because you don't care about the theme,

[06:07] you seeing more moments from the movie make their way into the game

[06:13] isn't going to do anything for you.

[06:16] Whereas when you see clips from the Predator movie you love,

[06:20] that's going to do something to you.

[06:23] When you see more Harry Potter movie scenes coming to life,

[06:28] that's going to do something for you.

[06:31] And I think that's the big difference.

[06:34] I just worry that this theme, much like Labyrinth,

[06:39] I think even more so than Labyrinth because people had nostalgic love for Labyrinth.

[06:46] Nobody in this demographic has a nostalgic love affair with this theme.

[06:53] And so I'm hoping that David understands that now

[06:57] and the next titles coming out from him connect more

[07:01] with the pinball buying demographic.

[07:04] And I think that's going to be important.

[07:05] I'm going to say this right now, even without Arnold,

[07:09] pinball brothers will sell more Predator machines

[07:13] than barrels of fun will sell of Dune pinball

[07:17] simply because of nostalgic love affair for the property.

[07:23] I mean that.

[07:24] All right, what did someone say?

[07:25] Like that Predator is $19,500 in Australia.

[07:30] Look, if you're in Australia and you're buying pinball machines in 2025,

[07:36] you just have to be loaded.

[07:38] Like loaded.

[07:39] Like how can you guys drop this much on these games?

[07:42] I've always said this, it's cheaper to simply buy an airplane ticket

[07:47] and go to these pinball shows and get your fill versus 20 grand for one game.

[07:53] I mean, at least in your market, though, the games kind of hold value

[07:56] because you're always going to have more demand than supply in Australia.

[08:01] All right, let's talk about Harry Potter

[08:03] and the Sorcerer's artificial intelligence, artistic layout mode of the game.

[08:09] No, so everyone is now seeing what seems to be some clear evidence

[08:14] that the artwork on Harry Potter was using some sort of filter,

[08:18] whether it was an AI filter or some other filter.

[08:22] There is some weird stuff going on.

[08:25] There is weird stuff going on on the castle, on the train, on the hands.

[08:30] Like throughout this game, you can notice some things that look like

[08:34] they were manipulated by some computer program.

[08:37] And so I don't think the folks at Jersey Jack knew this happened or was happening.

[08:44] I think they just saw it at face value.

[08:47] It looks really good when you first glance at art like this.

[08:51] And that's the thing with AI art.

[08:54] It always looks really good.

[08:57] But then when you sort of look closer at it, a lot of weird stuff is happening.

[09:03] I feel bad for Jersey Jack.

[09:06] If that is the case, do they need to redo the artwork?

[09:11] Will this create a delay for them?

[09:14] I don't think they're really going to change it at this point.

[09:18] But who knows, right?

[09:19] If Warner Brothers catches wind of this and someone flags it for them,

[09:25] they might be forced to go back and fix some of this stuff.

[09:28] But also remember, Warner Brothers approved all of this.

[09:33] It's not like they didn't see it.

[09:35] It's not like they didn't go over it with a magnifying glass.

[09:39] Like they had every opportunity to make changes.

[09:43] Someone pointed out that the dragon with two eyes on its left side,

[09:48] they filled in one of the eyes.

[09:50] So that's like maybe people are like, oh, they must have caught this

[09:54] and made a slight correction to it.

[09:56] I just want to say this.

[09:57] I was talking to Brett yesterday, Brett Abbas,

[10:00] and they know what people are saying about the game.

[10:04] And not just the artwork.

[10:05] I didn't ask about the artwork, but they know that there's work to be done,

[10:09] that they need to wake up the connection between the movies people love

[10:14] and the pinball experience, and they are working on it.

[10:18] And I just want to say to everybody out there, let's let them bake on it.

[10:22] Right? Let's let them fix the things they know need to be fixed on the game.

[10:27] They're going to focus on this game for the next year.

[10:30] And I do think they're going to fix the problems.

[10:33] And I feel good that they know and are listening to the feedback.

[10:37] But I just want to say this.

[10:38] The people that annoy me the most are not the so-called stern army

[10:43] that's being blamed for pointing out the AI artwork.

[10:47] I don't believe in that.

[10:48] The people that annoy me the most are the JJP shills

[10:53] that have been saying this game is perfect out of the box.

[10:57] You know who they are and you know what they've been saying.

[11:00] And to those people, if the world operated on feedback from people like that,

[11:06] nothing would ever get better ever.

[11:09] And I'm just tired of when people are trying to give constructive feedback,

[11:14] myself included, we get attacked by these like happy go lucky shills

[11:19] who are telling us to shut up that we're ragging on the game.

[11:22] And I'm like, you haven't even listened to my shows.

[11:25] I'm not ragging on Harry Potter.

[11:27] I'm giving a balanced feedback on the game.

[11:31] And the things that I want to see improved,

[11:33] I think will make this game maybe a masterpiece.

[11:36] So should I bury my feedback?

[11:38] Should I just tow the company line?

[11:40] Order two, one for each of my houses and say that everybody else has no taste.

[11:46] Like, I just don't think that's a very constructive way to look at this game.

[11:50] So look, they know what needs to happen.

[11:53] Stern Pinball knows what needs to happen with X-Men.

[11:56] Now, Jack Danger put up a post that said they're working on new X-Men code

[12:02] coming soon, and then he took the post down.

[12:06] Now, people are speculating why is it removed?

[12:09] And I think it's because of the word soon.

[12:12] What does soon mean in the world of Pinball?

[12:16] Does that mean in July?

[12:17] Does it mean by the fall?

[12:19] Is it sometime this year?

[12:21] And I think that's why they took it down,

[12:24] because now you're going to have all these people expecting something soon

[12:29] and is soon two weeks.

[12:31] Who knows in the world of Pinball?

[12:33] Now, I really hope this game gets fixed as well.

[12:36] It's a great shooting game.

[12:38] It's a beautiful game.

[12:40] I think it's one of Stern's nicest games they've ever launched.

[12:43] I think it looks much nicer than King Kong.

[12:46] I actually find it to be a more interesting game to shoot than King Kong.

[12:51] And so I hope the code on X-Men gets to a good place.

[12:55] That's what we all should want.

[12:57] We all should be rooting for these companies every time they release a game

[13:02] to make a great game.

[13:04] Now, what we shouldn't do, which is what 95% of Pinball content creators are today,

[13:09] we shouldn't just say everything that comes out is awesome.

[13:12] Everything that comes out, I'm going to buy it.

[13:14] Everything that comes out is great.

[13:15] I'm going to review it. It's awesome.

[13:16] They did a good job.

[13:17] And then I sell it like a week later.

[13:19] Like that literally is the vibe of so many Pinball content creators.

[13:23] It's the greatest game ever.

[13:25] I just ordered an LE and it's never leaving my home.

[13:29] A week later, it's up for sale for $3,000 less.

[13:32] They probably paid the wholesale price on the game.

[13:35] I love it. We've got now the content creators now are letting us know

[13:38] if they paid in full for the product or they paid out of their own money for.

[13:41] They look, I get it, gang.

[13:43] Take the perks if you get them.

[13:45] If you get the perks, just let us know you got the hookup.

[13:50] Okay. If I treat people like I did last night, if I treat people to dinner,

[13:54] I, you know, I don't mind it.

[13:56] If they say, Hey, Chris took me out to dinner.

[13:58] Doesn't make them love me any lesser anymore.

[14:02] It probably makes them love me a little bit more guy like Canada.

[14:05] Right. I got to buy my friends.

[14:07] You know how I roll through his world.

[14:09] I'm just joking. Am I maybe not? Brenda, what do you think?

[14:12] She's upstairs. She can confirm. Yes or no.

[14:15] Have I had, have I had to use the almighty dollar to make people like me?

[14:20] I don't think so.

[14:21] I think if I was broke and I was on an island and all

[14:24] I had was a mic.

[14:26] I'd be dropping this heat every week for you guys and you'd still subscribe to

[14:30] Canada's pinball podcast.

[14:32] Everybody comes back.

[14:33] We lose people every month.

[14:35] You know, the same people that cancel always come back because where are they

[14:39] going to go?

[14:40] Where are they going to go?

[14:41] All right. So it's King Kong dead.

[14:43] Is there like a second life for King Kong or is it over?

[14:46] My thing on Kong is this.

[14:49] It's just not enough.

[14:51] It's just not enough to excite people.

[14:54] I get it. Shoot's great.

[14:55] There's just something about the unlicensed Kong.

[14:58] There's something about the art all looking the same.

[15:02] There's just something about this game.

[15:04] The quality is not great.

[15:06] Kong's arms are falling off.

[15:08] You've got to buy some dude's mod so the buck doesn't shake.

[15:13] Really for $13,000, I have to now go buy a bracket from a dude who's making them.

[15:19] Really for $13,000, Stern hasn't fixed it yet.

[15:23] And I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I don't know.

[15:25] I just feel like Kong isn't enough to want it right now because I also think

[15:31] everyone's just so much smarter now is you know, if you really want a Kong,

[15:37] the code's not done.

[15:39] You wait six months.

[15:40] Kong Elise 10, Kong premium 7,500 and a Kong pro is five.

[15:46] Like that's the way it's all going.

[15:50] If Jaws 50th comes out in two days, I don't know.

[15:54] I haven't heard anything.

[15:55] Like I haven't heard a scheduled meeting with distros.

[15:58] I kind of feel like it's not happening.

[16:00] But if it does happen and Jaws 50th comes out, then what's going to happen

[16:04] to all those Jaws Elise, they're going to go down.

[16:07] Everything's going down.

[16:08] Everything's headed south.

[16:09] It's fine.

[16:09] That's why you should just buy games you love.

[16:11] You should buy games you love.

[16:12] Brian is trying to give me coffee right now.

[16:14] We're live, baby.

[16:15] 60 people.

[16:16] 60 people.

[16:17] I hope you're all subscribers.

[16:18] If you're a subscriber, you get to see now how Canada does the show live.

[16:23] All right, so we've got Kong.

[16:25] The next game might be Jaws 50th.

[16:27] Then we've got John Borg, Star Wars Episode 1, 2, and 3.

[16:34] Darth Maul, baby.

[16:36] Pod Racing, baby.

[16:38] Guado, is it Guado?

[16:39] Who's, what's his name?

[16:40] The blue dude with the wings?

[16:42] Guado?

[16:42] I don't know.

[16:43] I forget his name.

[16:44] Annie, somehow you know.

[16:46] Somehow you know, Annie.

[16:47] Metacloriats Edition.

[16:50] What is going to happen?

[16:51] Are we going to go back?

[16:52] Are we going to go back to Episode 1 through 3?

[16:55] And the main guy, baby, Jar Jar Binks.

[17:00] They need to make a Jar Jar Binks super limited edition.

[17:05] Mesa want that version, Stern, using a big doodoo jar jar.

[17:09] Look, I think these movies, since Star Wars has had so many bad TV shows,

[17:15] I think everyone's looking back on Episode 1 through 3 with a lot more fondness

[17:21] than they used to.

[17:22] I mean, Hayden Christensen now goes to the Star Wars conventions,

[17:25] and he's like, treat it like a celebrity.

[17:28] Like, they go nuts when they see him.

[17:30] And so look, it's Star Wars.

[17:32] When that theme song hits, if John Borg makes a great game, it's going to sell.

[17:38] If you want to go up against Harry Potter,

[17:41] it's a good one to punch to hit back with Star Wars and Pokemon and maybe Tron.

[17:49] The one game they better not make, and you know what it is.

[17:52] They better not make a remastered, like, comic version of The Walking Dead.

[17:58] Nobody wants another run of Walking Dead.

[18:03] That's not the game.

[18:05] It's Tron, and then it's Lord of the Rings.

[18:09] Those are the two games everybody wants another run of.

[18:14] It's not Walking Dead Stern.

[18:17] And then, Stern, you really need to get more great themes going.

[18:24] You don't have enough of the nostalgic stuff we want.

[18:27] I still can't believe we're not going to get back to the future from Stern.

[18:32] By the way, everybody, if you're following how slow Dutch Pinball is making,

[18:39] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, how the heck is this company going to make back to the future?

[18:47] How?

[18:48] Like, what happens when they get 5,000 orders and they're making 20 games a week?

[18:55] What happens?

[18:57] How are they ever going to fulfill orders?

[18:59] 20 games a week at best?

[19:01] I think it's like 10 games a week.

[19:03] I don't think they can make even 500 games a year.

[19:06] And so what's going to happen when they try to manufacture back to the future?

[19:10] What Barry should have done?

[19:12] He should have inked the deal with either Stern or JJP.

[19:17] They both wanted it.

[19:19] The thing is, I know Barry wanted a lot up front.

[19:23] He didn't want to wait for the money.

[19:25] If I were Barry, I would have taken the long payout.

[19:30] I would have said, look, we'll do the deal.

[19:33] I want 500 bucks per game sold, and I would have taken a plane to the Caribbean and sat

[19:40] on a beach and collect checks for the next five years.

[19:46] And I'm talking people millions of dollars.

[19:49] We're not talking a few hundred thousand dollars here.

[19:51] I'm talking millions of dollars he would have made over the duration of that game's

[19:59] manufacturing.

[20:01] And I also would have said part of the deal is don't cap this game.

[20:07] Make 88 SLEs, make another LE, but then the premium unlimited runs, they would never stop

[20:14] selling it.

[20:16] And it was going to be made by Keith Elwin.

[20:19] And if it was over at Jersey Jack, it would have been like Richie and Eric or somebody,

[20:23] and they would have done it justice.

[20:25] And they've got Joe Kay getting all the assets.

[20:27] Bob Gale.

[20:29] He could have just made himself set.

[20:33] And also we know this Dutch one game, one game in 12 years.

[20:40] So I'm worried.

[20:42] I'm worried because, again, I just don't feel like they're going to be able to handle the

[20:46] demand.

[20:47] And sometimes in life, you've got to know your limitations.

[20:50] We all have to.

[20:51] That's what guides us in our professional careers.

[20:53] You just got to know what you're good at and what you need help with.

[20:57] And they're not good at manufacturing.

[20:59] It's just not their strong suit.

[21:01] One game in 12 years.

[21:03] You are not a manufacturing company.

[21:05] You've made one game in 12 years.

[21:08] And so we'll see what happens there.

[21:10] I mean, that's not happening anytime soon.

[21:12] We really can use Alice as a marker to see how they're doing.

[21:17] And it's not flying out the door.

[21:19] It really isn't.

[21:20] So today, Predator, it's coming.

[21:23] It's coming.

[21:24] It's going to be out in, like, what?

[21:26] Like, three hours, six hours.

[21:28] We will see Predator.

[21:30] All the teases are over.

[21:32] I'm going to get this show up.

[21:34] Everybody thank you for hanging out and watching a live recording of how Canada does.

[21:40] Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[21:41] You can see how I have to edit a little bit here and there.

[21:44] But I love doing this show.

[21:45] And if you're not a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast, please join the show.

[21:50] It's only $5 a month.

[21:51] And if you join today, it unlocks for you.

[21:54] I think something like 500 episodes are now on Patreon that you can go back and listen

[22:02] to.

[22:03] So you get a lot.

[22:04] You also get access to the chat on Patreon, which is so much fun.

[22:10] Every hour of every day.

[22:11] Those who are members can contest to this.

[22:14] Every hour of every day, if you ever just want to hang out and chat Pinball, people

[22:19] are there.

[22:20] It's a lot of fun.

[22:21] All right.

[22:22] So if you guys join and you become a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast, everybody get

[22:26] to the chopper today.

[22:28] We'll be back here at 2.50pm to see what this game is all about.

[22:34] Going to have a lot of feelings on it.

[22:36] We know Arnold's not in it.

[22:38] And that's going to manage our expectations, right?

[22:40] Because we know he's not in it now.

[22:42] So I'm not going to get devastated by it because I know it.

[22:46] I wish they would have said it.

[22:47] Maybe he's got callouts.

[22:48] We shall see.

[22:50] We have a great Wednesday and we'll be back later today.

[22:54] We need out.
