[00:00] That was one thing when I first heard of a dark smarter, money changes over the...

[00:12] That money, money changes over the...

[00:21] Ah, good morning everybody. Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] The only pinball podcast that's been telling everybody,

[00:27] Wait and See and Why Bye Now and Now It is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.

[00:32] I woke up this morning and I saw a Foo Fighters LE, New Inbox, Foo Fighters LE.

[00:37] The Game of the Year. It is going to be the Game of the Year.

[00:40] It is a phenomenal pinball machine, Jack Danger's inaugural effort.

[00:45] It is such a good machine. You can now go get it, New Inbox for $9,995.

[00:52] Now this is symbolic of where this entire market is right now.

[00:56] It's symbolic that the pinball marketplace has flatlined people.

[01:01] Nobody is buying Elton John and now games that people bought less than a year ago

[01:07] is losing this much money in value.

[01:10] And what is the phrase people always say?

[01:12] The market will correct itself. The market will dictate where prices net out.

[01:18] And so this morning, this game has now lost $3,000 over the price it was brand new.

[01:25] And the game is still brand new in a box.

[01:28] So now 999 people who own the other Foo Fighters LE machines,

[01:34] all of those machines are now worth either this much money or less.

[01:39] And most of those machines are opened up so they're not even New Inbox.

[01:44] And do you think the pinball market can absorb these kinds of losses on a single year ownership of a game?

[01:51] And the real death of the pinball market will be when people cannot sell their used games

[01:58] to free up money and space to buy the New Inbox games.

[02:03] Here's what makes no sense to me.

[02:05] How long can this marketplace survive when Elis are sliding down right to the price of premiums

[02:13] in less than a year?

[02:15] So then everybody who bought an LE machine is going to lose 30% value in the game

[02:21] and they're going to be okay with that?

[02:23] It's not going to happen.

[02:25] And basically what we're seeing is this.

[02:27] Stern Pinball never should have raised the prices of LE machines

[02:32] over the $10,500 mark that they had for Godzilla LE.

[02:37] It was the perfect price for the LE, especially if they're going to make a thousand units.

[02:42] But the moment they make a thousand units at $13,000 a pop, look what happens.

[02:48] The market is oversaturated because there's too many of them and there's too much money.

[02:53] And that's a recipe for disaster in any marketplace.

[02:57] So what do you think those 999 people are feeling like today?

[03:01] And all of a sudden this hobby where one of the greatest selling points of this hobby for people

[03:06] was you weren't really going to lose much money.

[03:08] I've been in this hobby for 10 years.

[03:10] I'm not some newbie running out there buying every single new game.

[03:13] I'm not some distributor screaming at you, bye, bye, bye.

[03:16] And now look at where that message is.

[03:18] You don't hear him saying that much anymore because it's an ignorant statement.

[03:21] But in all of these years of watching this hobby, you know, bye, bye, bye used to mean something

[03:27] because you could buy everything and you wouldn't lose much money.

[03:31] But now it is absolutely collapsing.

[03:34] And now the question becomes who's going to be the company that actually acknowledges this?

[03:40] If one of these big companies does not wake up to the new market reality,

[03:44] this entire industry is headed for very, very dark times.

[03:49] I think the only companies that are going to be immune to it are going to be the smaller boutique companies

[03:53] that actually offer you a game at what is a much better value.

[03:58] But think about it like this.

[04:00] If everybody is watching these stern machines lose so much money in such a short period of time

[04:06] and every week Stern Pimbal is making hundreds of games,

[04:10] every month they are putting thousands of games inside boxes

[04:15] and those games need to find a home who's buying all of those games.

[04:20] You know, I've been hearing from distributors, sales are absolutely flat.

[04:24] Nothing is moving.

[04:25] And if you think those clearance sale prices have helped them at all,

[04:29] they haven't.

[04:30] It doesn't even matter if you take off $2,000 from the price of those games

[04:34] because here's why.

[04:35] When you remove $2,000 from the price of those games,

[04:38] that's what those games used to cost.

[04:41] And these are themes that nobody really wants.

[04:43] I mean, who even wants one of those home versions of a stern machine?

[04:47] I don't care how much you put the word sale up and big discounts, big bargains.

[04:52] People are not buying.

[04:54] They're just not buying this stuff.

[04:56] And why would they?

[04:57] Why would they?

[04:58] And I get it that everyone's just waiting for jaws to come out

[05:02] as if that one game is going to be able to save this entire industry.

[05:06] It's not.

[05:07] We need a market correction on prices from the factory.

[05:11] It is over.

[05:12] This is not going to work.

[05:14] These inflated prices, it is not sustainable.

[05:18] And it is a domino effect that we are now witnessing and it is happening.

[05:22] I've been reaching out to my distributor friends

[05:24] and they don't really know what to do.

[05:25] Sales are very, very weak and they're only going to get worse.

[05:29] Because the thing about Pinball is this.

[05:31] For people to get the money they need to buy the Jaws LEs

[05:35] and buy the Elvira freaking black and white editions

[05:38] and buy a Stranger Things, for most people out there,

[05:41] you need to sell something to get the new stuff.

[05:44] It's not just a monetary thing.

[05:46] Some people need to make room for that new game.

[05:48] Even if they have a lot of money, they need to free up space.

[05:51] So for those people, they need to sell a used game.

[05:53] For some people out there to get new games, you know,

[05:56] they're all not multi-millionaires,

[05:57] they need to sell some of their old games

[05:59] to free up some money to get one of the newer games.

[06:01] But now we've got this terrible scenario, right?

[06:04] It's a war on two fronts that everybody is losing.

[06:07] Because consumers can't sell their used games quickly anymore.

[06:11] Nobody's biting and why would anybody bite, right?

[06:14] The other thing too is like for a lot of these used pin sellers,

[06:17] they're still delusional.

[06:19] They're still pricing their games as if it's still COVID frenzy

[06:23] and they want premium top dollar for their machines.

[06:26] You're not going to get it.

[06:28] You're only going to get it on a handful of super rare machines

[06:31] and we all know which games those are.

[06:33] But for everybody else out there,

[06:35] good luck trying to recoup your investment in pinball

[06:37] unless you have one of those super desirable machines.

[06:40] And people are reluctant to see how far down the price needs

[06:44] to go to move the item.

[06:46] And that's where we're at right now.

[06:48] And that's why the title of this show is so damn shocking.

[06:52] That 999 people just had $3,000 in value

[06:56] erased from their Foo Fighters LE.

[06:59] Now what does that mean for James Bond LEs?

[07:01] What does it mean for other Stern machines?

[07:03] I think everyone is saying loud and clear,

[07:06] we think the price of a new and box Stern LE should be $10,000.

[07:12] We think the price of a new and box Jersey Jack Collectors Edition

[07:16] should be no more than $12,500.

[07:19] I mean, even Guns N' Roses CE is now a $13,000 new and box game.

[07:25] That game used to sell for $20,000 at the height of its launch.

[07:30] $20,000 for a new and box GNR CE.

[07:34] Same exact game, 2023, November $13,000.

[07:40] The market has slid way back down.

[07:43] So who's going to do it?

[07:45] I think anyone's going to do it.

[07:46] I think Stern has to be nervous.

[07:47] I mean, you know Stern is calling up its distributors and telling them,

[07:50] like, JAWS is coming.

[07:51] Don't worry, it's going to solve everything.

[07:53] And I'm telling you right now, I don't even care about JAWS LE anymore.

[07:56] I don't want to buy any Stern LEs at $13,000

[08:00] because we all know the other thing they're going to do is this.

[08:02] They're going to make more versions of that game.

[08:05] They're going to make an anniversary edition of JAWS in 2025.

[08:09] So if you go buy this JAWS for $13,000, guess what?

[08:13] They're going to make a nicer version of the game like a year from now.

[08:16] And you know why we know this?

[08:18] Because look at what Stern's been doing.

[08:20] This is exactly what they're doing.

[08:21] They did it with Jurassic Park.

[08:23] They did it with Elvira.

[08:25] We know they're going to do it with Godzilla.

[08:27] And we know they're going to do it with JAWS.

[08:29] It's just their new business model.

[08:30] They absolutely are just going to screw over everybody that is plunking down so much money.

[08:36] They want every single penny of the second hand value of these machines.

[08:41] They want to capture that instantly on new and box sales.

[08:45] And guess what's going to happen?

[08:46] They're going to collapse their own market.

[08:48] They already have people.

[08:50] They already have.

[08:51] If you think this market is not collapsing, it is collapsing.

[08:54] I think there's some delusional people that are holding on

[08:57] because you and I have never seen this before.

[09:00] Has anyone lived through a period in pinball

[09:03] in which prices went through the roof on every single game

[09:07] and then they jacked up the number of Ellie machines across the board

[09:11] and the train is not going to stop people.

[09:13] They moved into a much larger factory.

[09:16] Think about this for a minute.

[09:17] Stern has to make a lot more games to justify that factory.

[09:22] And I heard from a very reliable source.

[09:24] Games are piling up at Stern Pinball in boxes.

[09:28] It's going to look like that scene from Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

[09:32] You know, the military archives with all the boxes.

[09:35] That's what Stern Pinball is going to look like.

[09:37] If every single person out there starts saying,

[09:40] Hey, I'm not going to buy right now.

[09:42] I'm going to wait and see.

[09:43] Even distributors are not going to be able to take large allotments.

[09:46] Who's going to be writing checks for hundreds of thousands,

[09:49] if not millions of dollars in inventory that is not going to move.

[09:53] And the problem now is they've all painted themselves into a corner.

[09:56] Stern and Jersey Jack.

[09:58] They've painted themselves into a corner.

[10:00] Think about it now.

[10:01] If they reduce the prices of these early machines, which they need to,

[10:05] then they're going to have thousands of people who spent money at $13,000,

[10:10] who are going to feel ripped off and burned by them

[10:13] and are not going to want to buy from them again.

[10:16] It's really bad people.

[10:17] I mean this.

[10:18] I know it sound a little bit like the sky is falling,

[10:20] but I never wanted to see pinball come to this.

[10:23] Years ago, I used to say that they could charge more for like a super premium addition machine.

[10:29] I've always believed this.

[10:30] There are super wealthy collectors out there,

[10:33] and you can make Batman SLEs for people like that,

[10:36] but you got to be very careful about how you serve the high end market.

[10:41] And they did it all wrong.

[10:43] Basically now, they're charging us those high end prices.

[10:46] People remember, a Stern LE with a topper is basically like $15,000.

[10:53] So they've basically done this.

[10:55] They basically charged us what used to be the price on a very, very rare and limited and unique item,

[11:01] and now they're pricing every single horse as if they're selling you a unicorn, and they're not.

[11:06] A Batman SLE is kind of a unicorn, but a Foo Fighters LE is just a regular horse.

[11:12] There's a thousand of them out there in the world.

[11:14] And so that's what they've done.

[11:16] That's what they've done.

[11:17] And now it's got more and more people just saying,

[11:19] wait a minute, on all of these games.

[11:21] It's not just Stern.

[11:23] It's not just Jersey Jack.

[11:24] If you think Labyrinth is going to hold value at $10,600, you know it's not.

[11:30] And it has nothing to do with the game.

[11:32] It has nothing to do with the game.

[11:34] It has to do with the simple fact.

[11:36] If everybody's slowing down their purchasing and everybody is waiting it out,

[11:40] then now we have the power to control the prices on these games,

[11:44] and they're only going to go south.

[11:46] And if you don't run at stuff right away and you don't listen to the shills

[11:50] and you don't believe the hype and the FOMO, which is now dead, ladies and gentlemen,

[11:54] everything is going to go south instantly.

[11:57] It's happening in the auto industry.

[11:59] Go look at used car sales right now.

[12:01] They were crazy during COVID.

[12:03] I sold my Honda Civic Type R.

[12:05] I bought it for $35,000.

[12:07] I sold it three years later in the height of COVID for $37,000 back to the dealership.

[12:14] I recently got a Carvana appraisal of the car today.

[12:18] It's now worth $27,000.

[12:21] But yet somehow in the world of pinball, it's so niche and it means so much to us emotionally.

[12:27] Nobody is willing to accept the harsh reality.

[12:31] This industry needs to go through a correction.

[12:34] And we're doing it.

[12:36] You and me are responsible for these prices sliding back down to earth.

[12:42] And look, as a consumer, it's a good thing.

[12:45] We don't want to see any of these pinball companies go away, by the way.

[12:47] I mean, we love seeing all the variety, all the passion, all the personalities putting their heart and soul into these games.

[12:54] But the truth is, they're going to go away unless they figure this thing out.

[12:58] And there's no more company vulnerable than Stern Pinball.

[13:01] They have the most at stake.

[13:03] They have hundreds of employees.

[13:05] They need to make hundreds of games a week.

[13:07] And if they continue doing it like this, it's all going to fail.

[13:10] And I'm not asking it to go back to like eight years ago, nine years ago.

[13:14] I'm just asking it to go back to where Godzilla was.

[13:17] Because remember, Godzilla was right at the beginning of COVID.

[13:20] $10,500 for an LE.

[13:23] Your distributors are making about $1,500 to $2,000 on every one they sell.

[13:28] Everybody won.

[13:29] And if a game was good, it went up a little bit in value.

[13:31] You might have gained like $4,000 on your Godzilla value.

[13:35] But if a game wasn't great, it was just a mediocre LE machine, like a Venom.

[13:39] That game's not going to lose $3,000 to $4,000.

[13:42] It might only lose like $1,000 or $1,500.

[13:45] There was still some baked in value into everything.

[13:49] And how many of you out there have told your wife,

[13:51] oh, the reason I'm into pinball is I'm not going to lose much money.

[13:54] And I know a lot of guys that have been in this hobby for well over 10 years,

[13:57] and you used to get your machines for a few hundred bucks.

[14:00] So a lot of those guys are looking at their collections and being like,

[14:03] well, I'm still up overall.

[14:05] But here's the problem.

[14:07] Even those old guys that are used to never losing money,

[14:10] they're addicted to pinball.

[14:12] They buy new machines every year.

[14:14] They buy about two to three new machines every year.

[14:17] And they are not used to losing $3,000 to $4,000 on every machine.

[14:22] If you went in on James Bond's 60th for MSRP,

[14:26] and on Foo Fighters, and on Venom LE,

[14:29] if you just bought those three games from Stern Pinball,

[14:32] you lost more than like $12,000 in value in one year,

[14:37] simply buying three machines, new inbox.

[14:40] And you tell me this market is not stalling.

[14:43] You tell me it's not going to flatline the new inbox sales.

[14:46] You tell me distributors aren't nervous.

[14:48] You tell me these companies aren't being delusional.

[14:51] It's all happening right now.

[14:53] And then the real question is going to be like,

[14:55] how is everybody going to dig themselves out of this?

[14:58] I think it's going to be the battleground of the next like six months

[15:01] to a year.

[15:03] I think smaller boutiques like Spooky and Barrels of Fun

[15:06] and Dutch Pinball, I think they're going to be fine

[15:08] because their operations aren't so big.

[15:11] We know Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:12] I don't even know how to discuss Jersey Jack Pinball

[15:14] because they'd be out of business if it wasn't for the Abbas family.

[15:17] Nobody's buying Elton John.

[15:19] The game's flatlined in sales.

[15:21] It doesn't matter what they do.

[15:22] And the more they show gameplay of this game,

[15:24] it's making it worse because every time you see the gameplay,

[15:26] there's no toys in the damn game.

[15:28] And then the damn LCD screen looks like a cheap screensaver.

[15:31] Like it's not going to work.

[15:33] There's nothing they're going to be able to do with gameplay footage

[15:36] to get people excited about this game.

[15:38] And everyone's in the same boat with Elton John.

[15:40] Can't wait to play one.

[15:41] I bet it's fun.

[15:42] I bet it's Jersey Jack's best shooting game to date,

[15:44] but nobody wants the theme.

[15:46] And no one's going to plunk down 12 to $15,000

[15:49] when you know you're going to lose $3,000 on the cardboard box.

[15:54] And that's my final point, ladies and gentlemen.

[15:56] This hobby is now making it so the cardboard box is a $3,000 item.

[16:02] I would like to know how much that cardboard box actually costs a company.

[16:06] What, like $50 at most?

[16:08] Not even.

[16:09] Probably $10 for the cardboard box.

[16:11] We are now losing $3,000 every time we open up some of these machines.

[16:17] It's not the way I want it to start out on a Monday,

[16:19] but I saw this and I just feel bad.

[16:21] My condolences to each and every one of you who owns a Foo Fighter LE.

[16:25] If you just listened to Canada, I would have saved you money.

[16:29] And it's crazy, right?

[16:30] That's a new and box game.

[16:32] That means like an open up used Foo Fighters LE is now worth less than that.

[16:37] What, $9,500?

[16:39] $9,000?

[16:40] A $4,000 hit?

[16:42] I hope you guys play your machines.

[16:43] The only silver lining in all of this is you better play your games 4,000 times

[16:48] or else you're losing money.

[16:49] So for these collectors out there, I got a Foo Fighters LE.

[16:52] It's only got 120 plays.

[16:54] You know, if you only put 100 plays on your Foo Fighters LE, then that's $30 per play.

[16:59] I hope you're enjoying the machine, everybody.

[17:01] Everybody, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[17:03] We're going to be back more of this week with more shows.

[17:06] Just wanted to stay focused on this topic for today.

[17:09] Have a great Monday.

[17:10] We'll be back.

[17:11] And I want to give an extra special shout out to Spooky Pinball for the care package they sent me.

[17:15] If you haven't seen my Saturday morning spectacular, go check it out.

[17:19] It's going to be customer service like that and companies that actually care about the community.

[17:24] Again, if you have to decide where to spend your money, I'm going to spend my money on companies that care.

[17:29] And I'm starting to feel like Stern and Jersey Jack.

[17:32] I don't feel the love anymore like I used to from some of those companies.

[17:35] Everybody, have a great day.

[17:36] We'll talk to you soon.

[17:49] Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
