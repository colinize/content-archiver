[00:00] ["Seunghoon's

[00:29] ball podcast, I am suffering from severe jet lag coming back from Tokyo.

[00:35] I have not been able to sleep at night.

[00:37] And the problem is when you live in a one bedroom apartment doing a podcast at 146 in

[00:43] the morning, when you have an Irish woman sleeping and an English bulldog snoring, it really

[00:49] isn't in option.

[00:51] So my only options of locations to do this where I could try to go down the basement, but

[00:56] the soupers down there sleeping and the door man usually sleeps in one of the rooms down

[01:00] there.

[01:01] I could go to work or I could go to what I think is the quietest location in the nearest

[01:06] vicinity to me.

[01:08] And that is the rooftop.

[01:10] So I am up on top of my building recording this episode for you, the listener of Canadian

[01:16] Pimball Podcast.

[01:17] So what are we going to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast?

[01:20] So here's what I was thinking about a couple things I want to talk about because you

[01:23] know, we are in a little bit of a low when it comes to Pimball news, but you know me,

[01:27] we will always find new things to discuss.

[01:29] I want to talk about what I think is probably one of the biggest, untapped revenue potentials

[01:36] for every single Pimball company out there.

[01:39] And we know that when you're a Pimball manufacturer, you have to find ways to make money in different

[01:46] ways than just the game itself.

[01:48] I think where most of them are shortsighted is in how they approach this sort of feverish

[01:55] community that will absorb so much from them.

[01:59] And yet they get so little, right?

[02:01] They only seem to get a game out to people and maybe a little bit of options for the game

[02:08] and some crappy t-shirts.

[02:10] And that seems to be the extent of the Pimball merchandise that makes its way out from

[02:14] manufacturer.

[02:15] So we're going to talk about that.

[02:16] We're going to talk about the game that I said was probably most likely going to come

[02:22] back this year that everyone has ridden off.

[02:25] And I hear that it is actually going to happen.

[02:28] So we're going to talk about that.

[02:29] And then finally, we will close this episode with a moment of silence for whoever bought

[02:35] that Supreme Pimball machine.

[02:37] We'll talk a little bit about that crazy sale that happened for like $38,000.

[02:42] So first, first and foremost, I want to congratulate Zat.

[02:46] Zach Manny on putting up a piece of content about how to clear code your Pimball playfield.

[02:54] I mean, that is like content that what maybe 0.01% of Pimball people in this hobby are

[03:01] qualified to attempt a Pimball clear coding job.

[03:05] So look out for Canatus Pimball Podcast, a new video series on open-heart surgery where

[03:11] I go into the details on how you can perform open-heart surgery on yourself.

[03:15] And I guarantee you'll survive.

[03:17] Let's go on to the biggest untapped revenue stream happening in Pimball right now.

[03:23] So here's the thing.

[03:25] If you're a Pimball company and you want to give your community and your buyers what they

[03:31] really want.

[03:32] So right now they give us games.

[03:34] So let's just put games to the side.

[03:36] We know that Pimball manufacturers will sell us games.

[03:39] From that point on they have a loyal consumer base, right?

[03:43] They have a fan base.

[03:45] What other stuff is a Pimball company selling you right now, right?

[03:50] So let's look at Stern Pimball, the biggest Pimball company in the world.

[03:53] They will sell you t-shirts.

[03:55] They will sell you merchandise like I think there's like some sweatshirts.

[03:59] All of it, most of it isn't really that great.

[04:02] Let's be honest.

[04:03] It's not the greatest, okay?

[04:04] I won't even go down the Stern Insider t-shirt that you got when you signed up for that

[04:08] program.

[04:09] Okay, from there, and I'm just looking around me to see if like anyone's up on this rooftop

[04:14] because it's a little freaky up here, I feel like Batman.

[04:16] All right.

[04:17] Okay.

[04:18] So from there they also will sell you a topper and they will sell you side armor and inside

[04:26] art blades, the inner art blades to a game.

[04:28] Okay.

[04:29] Now from that point on, from that point on they don't really sell you anything extra in your

[04:35] game.

[04:36] Now, why is it that Pimball manufacturers don't tap into the mod market, right?

[04:44] The mod market in Pimball is one of the most profitable market places in the entire industry.

[04:52] And if you think, you know, people have like called this out time and time again.

[04:56] Like you buy a little matchbox car, you wire to have some lights and all of a sudden you're

[04:59] paying like $90 for a Batmobile.

[05:02] And there's a lot of 3D printed stuff.

[05:04] Now I know some work goes into designing and making these things, but the amount of money

[05:10] people are spending on these mods, the profit margins on them is significant.

[05:14] It just is.

[05:15] Now why is it that a Pimball company doesn't when they release a game also have a division

[05:23] that is working on mods for the game that are approved by the license.

[05:28] Now look, most of them don't even need license or approval.

[05:32] I mean, you can go around a game like Batman 66 and do you need a license or approval to

[05:38] do the crane mod or the atomic pile mod, you know, to do flipper bat mods?

[05:43] I'm not really sure you do.

[05:44] Now, if you do need approval, there's no way those mod companies are getting that approval

[05:50] and it would be much easier for a company that has permission to make all the things around

[05:55] that IP to create those mods.

[05:58] Now I think that mods are where the money is at for a lot of these Pimball companies.

[06:04] And you know, it's not just, it doesn't have to stop just there because imagine this

[06:09] for just a minute, imagine this.

[06:12] Imagine you buy the new Elvira game and you know, the game comes as it is.

[06:18] Why can't Stern Pimball maybe think about down the road actually making the designer addition

[06:27] mods for the game?

[06:29] So imagine if they did this, imagine if they made Dennis Nordman's original design for

[06:35] the ramps and offer them up for sale.

[06:39] Why could they not do that?

[06:41] It wouldn't really change the gameplay.

[06:44] If you alter the ramps a little bit, it's not going to change anything about the way

[06:47] the game is coded, the speed of the ball going, you know, back to the flipper.

[06:52] So what if it's off by like fractions of a second?

[06:55] And how cool would that be if they did that?

[06:59] You know, what's stopping Dennis Nordman himself from making those mods for the game?

[07:05] Would Stern stop him if he made his original ramps and sold them?

[07:09] Who wouldn't buy Dennis Nordman's original ramps for his Elvira design if he created

[07:15] them right?

[07:16] And then you start to think about the numbers that are out there with these games and all

[07:21] of a sudden you start to realize if you design a mod that is super awesome that almost

[07:27] everyone has to put into the game because it's great.

[07:30] You're talking about a few thousand potential buyers, okay?

[07:36] And let's say you make a hundred-hour profit on new ramps for the game.

[07:43] So you all of a sudden have opened up maybe a hundred-two hundred thousand dollar profit

[07:50] on a simple thing like sculpting plastic ramps to put in an Elvira game, okay?

[07:57] So there's other parts of the game too, right?

[07:59] How has a company ever, has a company from the manufacturer, from the manufacturer ever offered

[08:06] a limited edition translate that they sold after the fact?

[08:12] So how cool would it be when Zambietti is doing maybe three translates per game, he

[08:18] also does a special edition translate.

[08:21] You could limit them, you could make them maybe we're only going to make 150, maybe we're

[08:25] going to make 500, you could make them available on limited supply, but you could actually go

[08:31] around a game and start to see all the potential in the game.

[08:36] So I think there's definitely, definitely an untapped opportunity.

[08:40] Now you might be saying, if they do that, they're going to cut the legs off from underneath

[08:46] all the mod community and the mod community is one of the greatest communities in Pimbal.

[08:50] And I do agree with that.

[08:52] I don't want people to stop making mods for games and I think they still will, okay?

[08:59] But a Pimbal company with its resources, with its engineers, with its sculpting machines

[09:05] and CNC machines, they have the ability to make some really, really cool stuff for these

[09:10] games that I think a lot of people would buy into.

[09:13] And I look at these games, right?

[09:15] These are toys and dressing them up is one of the most fun parts of the hobby.

[09:20] And you should be able to go down in options list of real cool things you can put into your

[09:26] game after the fact that goes beyond just the typical topper or inner art blades or

[09:31] side armor, okay?

[09:33] And we know we know Stern is making a fortune on those kinds of mods.

[09:38] Now, that's just stuff to do with the game.

[09:41] But what about the lifestyle, right?

[09:44] It's a lifestyle brand.

[09:45] What about the different things they could sell you, things to hang on the wall, right?

[09:51] Other articles of clothing to wear?

[09:53] I mean, they really could do a lot more.

[09:56] I mean, I love seeing the design sketches of these Pimbal machines.

[10:00] You could create an entire lithograph series of all the original design or sketches of

[10:06] the games.

[10:07] I mean, George Gomez is sketches.

[10:10] They're one of the coolest things ever to see how his ideas go from a pencil and paper

[10:17] sketch into a Pimbal machine.

[10:20] So all that stuff has value, right?

[10:22] Has tons of value.

[10:24] And I think the community and the fans would love access to some of this stuff other than

[10:31] the typical stuff, okay?

[10:33] So do we think that's going to happen?

[10:34] I don't know.

[10:35] I don't know.

[10:36] I think if I was sitting in another company, you know, Stern is obviously in the driver's

[10:41] seat when it comes to all of this stuff.

[10:44] But Jersey Jack, another great example of a company that's got a die hard fan base.

[10:50] And Willy Wonka is a game that is just screaming, screaming for amazing mods for that game.

[10:57] Now, no, and here's the thing too, is if you're Jack and you know you can already get people

[11:03] to buy this game with, you know, maybe the factory looking like that or maybe the

[11:08] wonkivator looking like that.

[11:09] And then you sell an upgraded version of it on the second hand.

[11:13] I don't think people would mind.

[11:15] I really, really don't.

[11:17] And maybe that's why they don't do it.

[11:18] Maybe they're afraid that people are going to complain that why didn't you just put this

[11:22] in for $9,000 or $9,500?

[11:26] And you know, that might be a great devil's advocate argument.

[11:30] And for the most part, I do think that they are just scratching the surface of the potential

[11:37] to get people to, you know, buy other mods for the games that come from the manufacturers.

[11:42] Let's see if Stern does any of this.

[11:43] Sometimes I think they listen to some of my advice.

[11:46] So let's talk about stranger things because I keep hearing, stranger things come up over

[11:52] and over again as like the next Stern title.

[11:55] I think it's ludicrous to debate whether or not stranger things is a good theme for pinball.

[12:01] It absolutely is because if you look at the segment where pinball is growing the most,

[12:06] if you look at the age demographic where pinball is becoming the most, you know, the most

[12:12] new people into the hobby.

[12:14] You are talking about probably late 20s to early 40s.

[12:20] That's the newest group of people coming into the hobby.

[12:24] From I think like a tournament and a player age group and also from a buyer base.

[12:29] And stranger things hits that demographic perfectly.

[12:34] And if you haven't watched stranger things, I highly recommend you do.

[12:37] If you watched it and gave up maybe on season two, I highly recommend you watch season three

[12:43] because it's incredible.

[12:45] Would it translate it into a great pinball machine?

[12:48] I think it would, but I think it would be a little bit challenging because of how

[12:53] much story there is going on in a way.

[12:56] But I think you could do it.

[12:57] I really do.

[12:58] I think there are so many moments in that show that lend themselves to different mechanisms

[13:04] and to different toys and to different layouts.

[13:09] You know, the upside down world, I think you could think really creatively about how you

[13:13] do that.

[13:14] The Christmas tree lighting up, like there's a lot of cool visuals from that show that

[13:19] you could put into a pinball and make it an immersive experience.

[13:22] Now, but here's the biggest thing that I'm like, well, if there's one thing that I

[13:26] would be cautious of when we think about stranger things, it's this.

[13:31] It's will stern spend the money to get the necessary assets that I think you would need

[13:38] to do stranger things justice.

[13:40] So for example, you can't do stranger things without the iconic music from the show.

[13:46] Well, the theme song of the show itself, but also the 80s music that appears throughout

[13:52] the show is just part of the experience.

[13:56] You know, like you, and it would be hard, right?

[13:58] Because some of those songs and some of those iconic scenes feature songs like Ah-Ha's

[14:02] Take On Me, which has almost got a billion views on YouTube.

[14:06] So that's expensive.

[14:08] The never ending story song from season three, like you can't even do any of season three

[14:13] without leading to that moment because it's just it.

[14:16] Like that's the culmination.

[14:17] That's the final wizard mode song for season three or the final multi ball, right?

[14:21] So would stern do that, right?

[14:23] And I hear people saying, well, it'd be awesome to have like, agawaffel pop bumpers.

[14:29] So then you have to ask yourself, what do you think stern pimples going to go to get the

[14:33] license to use agawaffles?

[14:34] I mean, they didn't even get the license for a Jeep Cherokee.

[14:39] So I don't think that is going to happen.

[14:41] You know, Jeep would love to have, would love to promote their cars inside of Pimball

[14:45] Machine.

[14:46] I can't imagine it was that expensive.

[14:48] So does a new to down version of Stranger Things Appeal to you.

[14:52] But we do know, I think we do know that someone has the Stranger Things license.

[14:59] So if anyone's going to get it, it's going to be stern.

[15:03] Now, do I think that Brian Eddie's next game is Stranger Things?

[15:06] I don't.

[15:07] I really don't.

[15:09] And you know, I don't think that's fake news.

[15:11] I just don't think it is.

[15:13] But it seems to be the title coming up over and over and over again.

[15:18] And whenever I start to see a title repeated very frequently, it has to come from somewhere.

[15:24] Okay.

[15:25] Now, when will we see the next turn title?

[15:28] When are we going to hear about it?

[15:29] So if I were a betting man, I think stern is going to reveal their next title around

[15:37] the first or second week in December.

[15:40] I don't think they're going to do it around Thanksgiving.

[15:45] Maybe they do it on Black Friday, Cyber Monday.

[15:47] I don't know.

[15:49] I would, you know, it's going to be, it's going to be this year though, like it's going

[15:53] to happen.

[15:54] There's going to be the next cornerstone game from Stern.

[15:57] And it's, I would highly doubt that it's going to be the Led Zeppelin rumored pin.

[16:02] Okay.

[16:03] Now, speaking of before the year is up, you know, what is the game that I've been

[16:10] saying is going to come back is going to come back is going to come back in that game.

[16:15] If you remember is alien pinball.

[16:18] Now I am hearing more and more lately that this thing is happening and it's going to happen

[16:23] before the end of the year.

[16:25] Okay.

[16:26] Now, I haven't seen it.

[16:29] I have absolutely no confirmation other than what I'm hearing from people.

[16:35] And but when we look, we reported on this, we said it was going to happen.

[16:39] We thought it was going to happen sooner than it actually has.

[16:42] We do know for effect.

[16:43] Like if you just listen to people who are in the industry, like I've had a conversation

[16:50] with Chicago gaming company and they said, hey, Chris, we got approached by the pinball

[16:56] brothers to remake alien.

[16:58] Okay.

[16:59] So I know that happened.

[17:00] So if you know that happened, then you know it's not dead.

[17:04] Like these guys are looking for an outlet.

[17:06] Now, let's try and see if we can determine on the rooftop of my building as I look at

[17:14] the Empire State Building all it up.

[17:17] Let's see if we can guess together as if we're actually talking to each other.

[17:22] Who would make this pin?

[17:23] Like who's manufacturing this pinball machine?

[17:26] So here's a crazy idea.

[17:28] Do you think deep route might show an alien video?

[17:32] No, that's not going to happen, right?

[17:34] They're doing their own platform.

[17:35] I couldn't imagine Robert would go backwards to a failed game.

[17:40] But you know what?

[17:41] Let's play Devil's Advocate on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[17:44] Why wouldn't he go grab alien?

[17:47] He went and grabbed three other failed titles from Zidware that never really made it, that

[17:52] burned customers.

[17:54] So why not go grab another game that burned customers that never really made it?

[17:58] At least alien works.

[18:00] At least it's got one of the best codes ever in pinball.

[18:04] At least it's got one of the most immersive pinball experiences.

[18:07] I mean when you hear people talk about alien when it's actually working, okay?

[18:12] You hear nothing, nothing but glowing remarks.

[18:17] So here's another reason why I'm sort of like well maybe deep route does make sense.

[18:22] Well two of the major, major people who worked on alien pinball are now at deep route, the

[18:29] designer and the sound engineer, you know Dennis Norman and David.

[18:34] David Thiel.

[18:35] Thiel I can never remember which way it is to pronounce it.

[18:38] I can hear rare hero now like banging his head against the wall, but they're both over

[18:42] there.

[18:44] So maybe it makes sense that they would bring it to them.

[18:48] But then the coder, right, isn't the coder over at American pinball?

[18:53] So does American pinball?

[18:54] Do they enter into the conversation about possibly being the company that's going to bring

[19:00] alien out?

[19:01] And when Dovel says I think you're going to be very happy with our next title that we're

[19:05] working on, could it possibly be alien?

[19:10] Now I know Josh Kugler said nope it's not happening, it's not that.

[19:14] And so okay, well Josh works at American pinball, he's the coder so maybe we take his word

[19:19] for it.

[19:20] And then the question becomes maybe it's not any of these pinball manufacturers, but it

[19:26] has to be.

[19:28] And here's why there is no way a theme like alien if they actually want to sell the game

[19:36] and they need to get orders on it and they need to get people to spend money.

[19:40] There's no way anyone is going to give them money unless it is being built by a reputable

[19:46] company and they must know that.

[19:48] They can't be stupid enough to think that anyone is going to go in on it if they've

[19:53] set up manufacturing in just some random place.

[19:57] You know if like home pin was making it, nope that wouldn't be enough credibility to

[20:01] get the game out the door.

[20:02] Have you seen their like Chinese zombie game coming out?

[20:04] My God, just stick a fork in these guys, they won't go away, they keep the Chinese pinball

[20:09] market.

[20:10] There is no Chinese pinball market if you spend any time in Asia, it's all about redemption

[20:17] games, arcade games, they don't play pinball.

[20:21] You're not going to turn them into pinball fanatics with a zombie based game.

[20:26] Alright, so actually you know right now my voice might sound a little bit different

[20:30] because I'm actually back in the bedroom and it is now 11 o'clock or 11.30 in the

[20:37] morning because up on the rooftop my computer about 22 minutes in just died and there's

[20:44] nowhere to plug it in and charge it up there in the rooftop.

[20:46] So I hope you understand that Kaneda makes sacrifices for you listeners of the show, okay?

[20:51] And we don't have expensive studios and expensive equipment and all this stuff.

[20:56] The most expensive thing you can have or the most valuable thing you can have in the pinball

[21:01] podcasting world is a personality and you can't buy that with equipment, right?

[21:06] Alright, so let's talk about the supreme game.

[21:10] I think it sold for over $38,000 not surprised at all that this thing sold for that.

[21:17] I mean, I ever last punching bag sell for like $10,000 or $20,000 and that is one of the

[21:23] coolest supreme items you could put in your house if you collect supreme items because

[21:29] it's interactive.

[21:32] And so these machines originally sold for $10,000.

[21:36] Now that is incredible that someone who got a supreme machine now has something worth

[21:42] $28,000 more than they originally paid.

[21:47] Now who said pinball was a bad investment or who said we shouldn't think about pinball

[21:51] with the resale value and who said we should just go in and buy it because it's fun, right?

[21:56] Now supreme's a different monster.

[21:57] Now for all of you out there and I've said this before for all of you out there who always

[22:03] talk about expanding pinball and getting pinball to reach new audiences and getting young

[22:09] kids into pinball.

[22:11] The supreme pinball machine has accomplished that more and I don't mean like more in terms

[22:16] of like now more people are going to be buying pinball machines but I'm just in terms of awareness

[22:22] in terms of reaching broader audiences.

[22:25] This pinball machine has seen more eyeballs have seen it than almost all of the pinball

[22:32] content that every single pinball personality has created than every single piece of pinball

[22:39] content Stern has created.

[22:41] It's just that reality.

[22:44] Like go look at the views that Supreme got on their videos and then you've got you know

[22:48] all the pinball guys are struggling to get 5,000 views on their video and I think they

[22:52] got like almost like 2 million views on the Supreme pinball machine.

[22:56] Look it's not for us though and everyone should just realize that.

[23:01] They made this for Supreme fans and that's what Supreme does.

[23:03] I mean I'm actually working on a brand right now where Supreme is making a version of

[23:10] the brand and what's interesting about it is when Supreme knocks on your door and they

[23:16] want to make a Supreme version of your thing they have total control.

[23:21] You don't get to tell them anything.

[23:23] You don't get to tell them anything creatively.

[23:26] They get to control everything about it.

[23:28] They get to control how many you make where it's going to be sold, how it's going to be

[23:32] sold, when it's going to be released.

[23:34] They are the powerhouse.

[23:36] I mean Supreme is a much more valuable brand than Stern pinball.

[23:41] Absolutely more valuable brand than Stern pinball especially globally.

[23:45] And so you know I just think it was fun that they did that.

[23:48] I had no problems with it.

[23:49] I actually think if I were Stern I would look at other sort of like entities in which

[23:55] you could make really unique pinball machines and sell them to people.

[23:58] I've said it before.

[24:00] They could easily make a Gucci pinball machine and sell it in the Gucci stores around the

[24:06] world and they would sell everyone.

[24:08] And everyone on pinside would moaning grown because nobody there has any fashion sense.

[24:12] Okay, let's go on.

[24:14] What else is going on in pinball?

[24:15] So waking up this morning I keep thinking about this stranger things and it just can't

[24:22] it can't be wrong that there is a stranger things pin happening somewhere right.

[24:27] There's so much chatter about it.

[24:30] But then again we heard a lot of chatter about jaws.

[24:32] So do you think here's what someone told me they're like Chris stranger things is going

[24:36] to be Brian Eddie's next game and it's going to be revealed at CES in January which is

[24:41] the beginning of January.

[24:43] So do we think that rumor is true that Brian Eddie's next game is stranger things and it's

[24:48] going to be revealed at CES in January.

[24:51] So that would mean that we won't see Stern's next cornerstone game before the year is up.

[24:59] Now I don't know if we're going to see it.

[25:02] If the more I think about it like why would Stern during the holidays in which people are

[25:07] buying stuff and spending money.

[25:10] Why would they if the game is not on the line.

[25:13] Why would they reveal it during this time of year and because if they reveal it and the

[25:19] game is not shipping that's going to pause sales on the current games they're trying

[25:24] to sell right now.

[25:25] So Star Wars you know with the comic book art Elvira Jurassic Park is hot right now.

[25:33] So the more games they keep releasing every new game obviously will cannibalize sales of

[25:40] the current lineup.

[25:42] So I don't know.

[25:43] We'll see what happens.

[25:45] I do know that this is a nice window if I was another manufacturer to reveal something

[25:53] but the problem with all these other manufacturers is very simple.

[25:58] When you reveal a game you want to be able to take people's money quickly and you want

[26:02] to be able to get games out the door quickly.

[26:06] And so I've never seen anyone really do it that successfully other than Stern.

[26:11] I haven't.

[26:12] I've seen anyone say here's my new game and you can have it in just a couple weeks or

[26:16] a few weeks.

[26:18] It has been nothing but really really long delays right.

[26:22] I mean even look at the collector's edition of you know Willy Wonka collector's edition

[26:28] which actually is just on the line right now Jack just uploaded a photo of it on the line.

[26:32] So let's just count the months Jack reveals Willy Wonka in April and announces he's going

[26:38] to be making 5,000 limited edition games and 500 collectors edition games.

[26:44] Okay so how many months between collectors edition announcement and shipment.

[26:49] You got April?

[26:50] Well let's just start with May because it was end of April.

[26:53] May, June, July, August, September, October, November.

[27:01] All right.

[27:02] So we're at 7 months later and people still have not received the high end version of

[27:09] the game.

[27:10] So that's crazy to me.

[27:11] I mean how many months went by before Stern got people Elvira signature editions.

[27:18] Now that's a good question right because if we've looked at Elvira right now the LEDs

[27:23] have shipped or are shipping and people's premiums are also arriving.

[27:29] Now here's what I think Stern is doing.

[27:31] I think Stern is actually going to surprise and delight the signature edition buyers because

[27:39] they've probably heard people like me slamming the people for being suckers.

[27:44] I think they're going to surprise the signature buyers with more in that game than they initially

[27:51] reported because no one would ever complain about them adding stuff to the package.

[27:57] They would only complain if you remove stuff or change stuff you promised right.

[28:02] It's kind of like how Willy Wonka collector edition buyers are not happy that the top

[28:07] or isn't what was promised.

[28:09] See I think Stern is actually going to go add a topper which is obviously the most important

[28:16] thing in Pimball in 2019.

[28:17] If you listen to every Pimball podcast it's all about toppers now that's all that matters.

[28:21] You don't even need a game.

[28:22] You could sell people an empty box with a topper on top and that's good enough.

[28:26] Apparently for us now in Pimball because we've lost interest in the mechanical things

[28:30] underneath the play field or sorry underneath the glass.

[28:33] No but here's the thing.

[28:34] I think they're going to do that.

[28:36] I think they're going to add more of the game.

[28:37] I do.

[28:38] I think they're going to do something surprising because they know when people unbox that $15,000

[28:45] machine if it's just a piece of couch and the game looks exactly like the LE I think they

[28:51] know those buyers are going to feel underwhelmed.

[28:55] I would look for them to do more in that game.

[28:58] What else is going on in Pimball right now?

[29:01] So are we going to see any images from Dutch Pimball of them making the big Lebowski?

[29:05] Can we see something?

[29:07] Can we?

[29:08] Has anyone heard anything?

[29:10] Hopefully we'll see something soon.

[29:13] I don't know how long does it take.

[29:15] See here's what I think happened.

[29:16] Here's what I think that Barry had partially assembled games.

[29:20] I think they were more than just partially assembled.

[29:24] I think he screwed together whatever needed to happen and he put them in the cabinets that

[29:28] he did have.

[29:29] But then it reaches the point where he's out of cabinets.

[29:33] Once you're out of cabinets, there's nothing you can do.

[29:38] It's over.

[29:39] You need to get new cabinets.

[29:41] Then it comes down to, does he have the investment capital to order all the new things he

[29:47] needs and then go find a factory and then go set up a production line and then hire

[29:53] workers and then train those new workers on how to make these games and then wait for

[29:59] those parts to come in.

[30:01] Because something that we always forget about is the actual time it takes once you order

[30:07] a part to get those parts in and the stuff that he needs is not off the shelf stuff.

[30:13] It's customized stuff that takes a long time to get.

[30:16] So I think the wait is going to be months.

[30:19] Now the question is, do you think we're going to hear from Barry and see proof that new

[30:23] LaBouskies are going out the door before the year is over?

[30:27] I don't think so.

[30:30] I've never had faith that they will ever deliver what they promise.

[30:34] But I hope they do.

[30:36] I really do.

[30:37] I hope people get their games.

[30:38] But do I think Barry can make 500 games in one year?

[30:42] Because that's sort of what he was promising.

[30:44] Now if you think about it, that's about how many games Spooky Pimble makes in a year.

[30:49] And look at Spooky Pimble's factory.

[30:51] Look at their highly trained staff at this point.

[30:54] Look at the number of people that worked there.

[30:56] Look at the years of experience they've had to learn how to get to that level of manufacturing

[31:03] the games themselves.

[31:04] Now ask yourself a question.

[31:06] How many years of experience does Barry have in setting up a Pimble manufacturing company?

[31:12] And it's a big fat zero because he's always had to go and get a contract manufacturer.

[31:18] But I just don't think the future looks as bright as some of the people think.

[31:22] Now that being said, Big Lebowski sales.

[31:25] We have to have a moment of silence people for once,

[31:29] Kaneda Pinside Pimble listener.

[31:32] Pimble, I think his name is Pimble Gizzard.

[31:35] I think it's Pimble Gizzard.

[31:37] He said on Pinside that he is no longer listening to Kaneda's Pimble podcast after he saw

[31:43] Kaneda sell his Big Lebowski machine on eBay.

[31:46] And someone needs to go tell Pimble Gizzard that Kaneda did not sell his Big Lebowski on eBay.

[31:53] Kaneda still has his Big Lebowski sitting in a box at CoinTaker.

[31:57] I still don't know what to do with it.

[31:59] I've been waiting.

[32:01] I've been waiting for one thing.

[32:03] And the one thing I've been waiting for is just spare parts on the game.

[32:06] I want to know if spare parts are available.

[32:08] Then I haven't had any word that they are.

[32:11] I haven't seen anyone get spare parts.

[32:13] I haven't heard from Melissa if they ever came in.

[32:16] I don't know if they're ever going to get them.

[32:19] And that's what I'm waiting for.

[32:20] Because I would not take a Big Lebowski and open it up and put it in my home unless I

[32:25] had some backup.

[32:26] Now I heard that people are making backups of the boards that are in the Big Lebowski.

[32:31] It's going to get to the point.

[32:33] Hopefully where enough people have the game, where the community of owners will help create

[32:39] stuff so people can backup their games.

[32:41] But some of those mechanisms are highly unique and like the bowling alley mechanism and

[32:47] the rug mechanism.

[32:48] And you're not going to want to see somebody made those mechs.

[32:53] Here's the interesting thing.

[32:54] Somebody made those mechs.

[32:55] Like somewhere in the world there is a vendor that has the ability to make those things.

[33:02] And that vendor makes them and sends them to Barry.

[33:07] Now I wish we could just cut out the middle man.

[33:09] I wish I could just cut out Barry from the scenario and just go right to the vendor who

[33:13] actually is making these things and order them.

[33:17] Because if I have to wait for Barry, I don't have confidence.

[33:20] And even because Barry might have to buy them in bulk.

[33:23] But I think these owners don't even care about the price.

[33:25] They just want the peace of mind to know they can back their game up.

[33:29] All right.

[33:30] What else is going on?

[33:31] Did you guys see the Minival Manage Remake Royal Edition?

[33:35] There's a great stream of it on flipping out pinballs Monday night stream they do on

[33:40] Twitch.

[33:41] I crashed out and couldn't watch it because I was so tired but I was watching it yesterday

[33:46] morning.

[33:47] It's a really, really good overview of the game and the game looks great.

[33:51] I think it's, you know, everyone always says to me when I ask them about it, it's just

[33:55] the most beautiful version of Minival Manage you could ever see.

[33:59] So that is where I moved my deposit.

[34:03] You know, I plan to put that next to Batman.

[34:06] But you know me.

[34:08] I'm like, I wake up one day and then, ah, you know, maybe Stern shows us stranger things

[34:12] and I want to move there.

[34:13] I love being in this position because when you're in a position of living in New York

[34:19] City, there are tons of pinball games everywhere.

[34:23] Like sunshine is going to get El Vira in like two weeks or one week.

[34:27] I think November 19th, they're going to, and they might even have it already.

[34:30] But there's a party there in the 19th for El Vira.

[34:33] I don't have to buy any of these new games to go play them.

[34:39] All of them end up in New York, a subway ride away, which is $2.75 to get to the place.

[34:48] And when you go to sunshine, it's great because you can go at off hours when it's not crowded.

[34:52] See, I don't go on league nights when everyone's on there playing like games for 45 minutes.

[34:57] I usually go in around noon when they just open up and the game volumes are really nice.

[35:02] The games are set up brutal.

[35:03] I always have to remind myself that that I can't review a game at sunshine because they're

[35:10] set up so brutally hard.

[35:13] But I can get my fill.

[35:15] And there's other great bars in New York City like Pioneer Bar and there's like eight

[35:21] bit, you know.

[35:22] So there's other places I can go and get my pinball fill without having to spend so much

[35:27] money.

[35:28] And then the best place to go is my friend Adams loft and when she has like, he's going

[35:32] to get a medieval man as remake, Ellie Royal Edition or not Ellie Royal Edition.

[35:37] He's going to have it.

[35:38] And it's going to be down there in Tribeca and his games are set up perfectly.

[35:41] And it's the best environment to go play.

[35:44] And so that is the reality of why I never feel completely, I never feel like I have to

[35:52] buy anything.

[35:53] And the ones that make it into my bedroom, right?

[35:56] It's like, it's like the woman that makes it into my bedroom and the pinball machine that

[35:59] makes it into my bedroom has to be the greatest in the world.

[36:02] I'm looking at Brenda right now.

[36:03] She's cracking a smile.

[36:05] You know, I love you, baby.

[36:06] You know I put you in front of pinball, you know, business class to Japan and Seoul.

[36:12] You know how we do it.

[36:13] Come on.

[36:14] She's like, get on with it.

[36:15] They don't want to hear about this stuff.

[36:16] All right.

[36:17] What else is going on in the pinball world where a week away from deep root?

[36:22] I can't wait to see what the video is.

[36:25] Will they be making alien?

[36:26] I don't know.

[36:28] I don't know.

[36:29] It's interesting.

[36:30] Someone's going to make it eventually.

[36:31] The demand is there.

[36:32] The theme is hot enough.

[36:35] So we'll see what happens there.

[36:37] And I'm just trying to think if I've missed anything, I don't think so.

[36:40] Everyone.

[36:41] This has been episode 414 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[36:46] I'm also going to make a guest appearance on another pinball podcast finally.

[36:53] After all the years of doing pinball podcast, I've finally been invited onto another show.

[36:59] And it is one of my favorite shows.

[37:02] It is a special win-lit with Ken and Bill.

[37:05] I love those two guys.

[37:07] I think they're entertaining.

[37:09] I think they bring a great perspective to pinball.

[37:12] And so hopefully you'll hear it next week.

[37:15] I think I'm going on Monday.

[37:18] And it's going to be great.

[37:19] It's going to be a great chat.

[37:19] Now, maybe I shouldn't have said that because everyone's, don't hit them up and be like,

[37:23] I can't believe you're allowing Kaneda, that negative person onto your show.

[37:28] I'm also like, I've been talking to Zach many.

[37:32] And I told Zach what he should do is Zach should totally use the twippies as leverage

[37:40] to get onto this show or to be interviewed by me.

[37:45] And I said that he's, he's, he's, he's, I bet he's going to say the following.

[37:48] I bet he's going to say if, if, if his podcast this week in pinball wins the twippy, then

[37:55] Zach many will say he'll come on my show.

[37:57] Watch, I bet he makes like some sort of like silly promise like that.

[38:01] But you know me, I would love to have Zach on the show.

[38:04] I talk to him every day.

[38:06] You know, we jab back and forth with each other on our shows.

[38:09] But I would like to just have a real conversation with Zach about pinball, right?

[38:14] Because it's clear we disagree on some things and it's clear we disagree on, on new releases

[38:20] at times and reviews of games at times and like marketing decisions by these companies at

[38:25] times.

[38:26] Look and I think everyone's making, you know, pinball content.

[38:29] There's so much pinball content out there.

[38:32] You know, Zach clearly wants to make the most pinball content in the history of pinball

[38:35] content.

[38:36] And that's great.

[38:37] I mean, it's his business.

[38:38] I, there's no, there's no confusion as to why he would wake up and want to do this and

[38:42] why he's so excited about it.

[38:44] You know, when it comes to distributors reviewing pinball machines, that's where it gets a little

[38:50] interesting.

[38:51] When you, when you analyze that, I mean does AMC movie theaters do they do movie reviews?

[38:56] You know, it's, it's, you have to take it all with a little bit of a grain of salt.

[39:00] I, you know, and, and, but look, I'd listen to those reviews.

[39:03] I watch the reviews and I do think they're fair.

[39:05] But here's where I just think like you, for me, it boils down to one simple question.

[39:10] Do you think a distributor, and I'm not just talking about Zach, do you think a distributor

[39:16] who distributes a game would ever tell you this game sucks?

[39:22] Would, do you think they would ever tell you that?

[39:25] Or this game is ugly?

[39:27] Or this game is like shoots like crap, right?

[39:31] Even when people were taught, even when people were distributing thunderbirds, they were

[39:34] like saying nice stuff about it.

[39:36] Right? And then if you want to grade games on an A, on an, you know, an eighth, it should

[39:42] be A through F, right?

[39:43] How many times have you seen an F or a C or a D grade when, when you see pinball reviews?

[39:51] It's always A or B. Maybe once in a blue moon something gets a C. But no, I mean, I look

[39:56] at pinball where some stuff is an A, some stuff is, but there's a lot of stuff that's crap.

[40:02] Like if you were giving Game of Thrones artwork a review F, all right?

[40:07] F, if you were giving OctobrFest artwork a score, what would it be?

[40:12] A D, C minus, but you know, but it all ends up in the same place.

[40:20] It's all subjective.

[40:21] It's all subjective.

[40:22] You got to play the games, you buy what you like, you listen to what you like.

[40:26] You know, if people want to stop listening, it's fine.

[40:28] You know, it's like I look at my listener base is not going down.

[40:33] And I'm doing a podcast.

[40:34] I'm doing a solo podcast.

[40:35] That's the other thing.

[40:36] Zach just did a solo show and I challenged him and said, hey man, do a solo show for

[40:40] a month.

[40:41] And let's see how the listener base reacts.

[40:44] I'm always solo here.

[40:45] When I have a guest, I get a little bump up.

[40:48] It's always weird.

[40:49] Like people, some people only listen to the interview shows.

[40:52] That's fine.

[40:53] But most people, most of my audience will tune in just for these solo shows and there's

[40:58] no notes.

[40:59] There's no editing.

[41:00] There's nothing.

[41:01] There's nothing.

[41:02] It's just me talking to you about pinball.

[41:04] I'm glad you tune in.

[41:06] Thank you to everyone who donates to the Patreon of Canada's pinball.

[41:09] I thank you so much for that.

[41:11] Brenda, thanks you so much for that.

[41:13] And we're going to also get on the show real soon.

[41:17] Mr. Ben Heck.

[41:18] Oh, love Ben Heck.

[41:19] Love when he comes on.

[41:21] We're going to talk about everything going on in pinball.

[41:23] And then pretty soon, pretty soon because it is November.

[41:26] We're going to have to start to do our best of what happened in 2019.

[41:32] Now what I'm going to do this year is I'm going to create my own award with voting by one

[41:37] person me.

[41:39] And I'm going to call it Canada's Kudos Awards.

[41:43] And Canada's Kudos Awards, you know, they're the hardest awards to win because it's not

[41:47] voted on by everybody.

[41:49] It's not voted on by the pinball media.

[41:51] It's just me.

[41:52] But I am going to go down a list of different categories, not just the same as like the

[41:58] Twippies.

[41:59] And I'm going to give a Canadian Kudo Award out.

[42:04] And I am going to actually physically develop a Canadian Kudo Award and mail it to those

[42:09] individuals.

[42:10] All right.

[42:11] So I think that's going to be fun.

[42:12] The Canadian Kudos.

[42:13] Let's do this.

[42:14] All right, everyone.

[42:15] Have a great day.

[42:16] We'll talk to you soon.

[42:17] Play your pinballs.

[42:19] Play your pinballs more than you read pinside.

[42:21] And everybody get to the gym and work out way more than you play pinball.

[42:26] Talk to you soon later.
