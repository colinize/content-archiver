[00:00] Hit me with your best shot.

[00:02] Fire away.

[00:09] Welcome to episode 453 of Can8ist Pimball Podcasts.

[00:13] Is it the last podcast standing? No, they're back.

[00:16] They're back on the airwaves ladies and gentlemen.

[00:19] If you go to the Pimball shows, Ken and Zach are back on the airwaves.

[00:24] Their new show was yesterday, the Pimball Show.

[00:26] Check it out.

[00:27] It sounds like I thought it would be.

[00:29] It's a combination of special win-lite and this week in Pimball is Pimball podcast.

[00:35] Pretty much bolted together.

[00:37] So if you liked either one of those shows, I think you'll enjoy what they put together.

[00:42] So, you know, look, there's also new news in the Pimball world that Zach and Greg

[00:48] are not going to be hosting the trippies this year.

[00:53] Let's talk a little bit about that on this episode.

[00:55] We're going to interview Damien over at Haggis Pimball about a half hour interview about his

[01:02] indestructible playfields and we talk a little bit about that, why he chose Keltz as a theme

[01:09] to launch a Pimball company with.

[01:11] What else is going on? There's not that much going on.

[01:14] People are flaming out of the hobby a little bit.

[01:17] Did you see the news?

[01:18] Jason Fowler over at SlapSafePimball Podcast listed a bunch of his collection for sale.

[01:24] And I'm not sure if that means he's getting out of the Pimball hobby.

[01:29] I'm not sure if that means he's not going to do his Pimball network interview show,

[01:34] but clearly something's going on.

[01:38] You know, whenever someone just wakes up one day and just says,

[01:41] I've had enough and starts to list games for sale and wants a little bit of an exit from the

[01:47] hobby. I've always said this, I understand why people reach a point in which they completely

[01:53] are just done with it. They're done with the personalities.

[01:57] They're done with the drama.

[01:59] Done with the tons of money.

[02:01] They've sunk into Pimball machines, but more than that, the thing that really burns people out.

[02:08] It's just the amount of mental power, the amount of mental space you apply to Pimball.

[02:17] It takes over people's lives and I'm telling you and I've said it before.

[02:23] It's not worth it. Pimball is fun. Pimball is entertaining.

[02:29] But when it reaches the point where it becomes the center of your world, the center of your

[02:34] universe, it's the center of your house, the center of your free time, the center of your

[02:39] vacation space. You know, people travel the world and instead of engaging in the best restaurants

[02:45] and sightseeing abilities, they're like, where's the Pimball? Let's go play Pimball. Let's

[02:50] hang out with Pimball people. And for many of us, for most of us, I would say we are able

[02:57] to create some sort of balance. You know, I was telling Brenda last night, I'm like,

[03:00] Brenda, like walk around our apartment. There's not even a Pimball machine here.

[03:04] When we talk about what are we doing this weekend, the Pimball is not even on the list of things

[03:09] I want to do this weekend. Hanging out with Pimball people is not on the list of people I want to

[03:14] see in the near future. And so you have to, you have to kind of find what works for you. Now,

[03:20] I'm not sure if Jason's completely out. I would hate to see him go. I love Slapsafe Pimball

[03:25] podcast. I'm not sure if any of the drama around all the Pimball media has impacted him at all. But

[03:31] he'll tell us when he's ready to tell us what's going on. I looked at it like he was just thinning

[03:37] out his collection. He had a huge collection and it didn't look like he was listing everything for sale.

[03:42] So also in the news, Zach and Greg will not be hosting the Twippy Awards this year.

[03:51] And this is coming up real soon now. And all of a sudden, the hosts are now up in the air.

[03:56] And Jeff over at this weekend, Pimball put out a little statement saying that they've gone

[04:01] their separate ways. Now, I don't know about you, but part of me just feels like just bummed out

[04:10] about the last four weeks or so of all of this joining together, all of this behind the scenes

[04:18] drama, some of which obviously I've been a part of. And now the Twippies are losing the two guys

[04:25] who have hosted it the first two years. And I thought Greg and Zach brought a lot of energy

[04:30] to that show. And I would argue that the show was very much about them as well. You can't just

[04:37] extract the entertaining host from a show and still feel like the show is going to go on

[04:45] and be even more fun and exciting this year. And in fact, the entire sort of, here's,

[04:53] I'm just going to be candid. I think all of this reshuffling of all of the Pimball media and all

[05:00] the Pimball streamers and all of this stuff, I feel like it all could have weighed it until

[05:06] after the Twippies. And I'll explain why a lot of work goes into the show, a lot of planning

[05:11] goes into the show, a lot of energy goes into celebrating the best in Pimball at Texas Pimball festival.

[05:20] And I just feel like everyone just like, you know, the cards just all went up in the air. And now

[05:27] it's all chaotic. And for you, the listeners of all these shows, it's been chaotic for you.

[05:33] For the people planning this show, it's now chaotic for them. And it's sort of just like

[05:38] sucked the air out of the room and the enthusiasm to get down there, the enthusiasm to be a part of

[05:44] this event, it's just dissipated. And I don't know. And then, you know, there's a lot of behind the

[05:51] scenes conversations where it's like, I don't need to win a Twippy. I've already won one. I don't

[05:56] even know what that means. Like, what does that mean? Like, what if you won? I don't get it. And so

[06:01] there's like just been a lot of, it's just, it's like everyone wants to now make it sound like

[06:07] it means nothing. And then it means very little. And that the show is, is insignificant. And we

[06:14] should all just be positive and get along and, and, and, and, and spread the gospel of Pimball.

[06:20] And so, you know, it's, it is what it is. It's unfortunate. I think we're going to win the third

[06:25] Twippy. I think as results were coming in, it was quite clear. We're, we're the, the enthusiasm.

[06:33] And we're the audience lies. And I want to say to all of you who listen to this show, thank you

[06:37] very much. We didn't go away. We didn't take a break. We didn't make you buy a T-shirt that no

[06:43] longer has a show that's associated with it. We're still here. We're still doing what we do. We

[06:49] haven't, you know, any, look, and I have to be honest too. I'm a little bit fatigued by the lack

[06:55] of news in the Pimball world lately. It's been a little bit of a, of a dry spell. We've got

[07:03] Stranger Things, which has been underwhelming. Now, if you saw there was a, a flip in a dead flip,

[07:09] Jack Danger is going to do a Stranger Things stream tomorrow night, Wednesday night, in which it says

[07:15] secret revealed there's some, is there some secret in this game that is going to change our opinions

[07:22] about Stranger Things, Pimball. What could it be? Is there like, is there a special way to press the

[07:27] buttons in which, you know, a new toy actually pops up and it makes the game more interesting? I

[07:32] think what they're going to reveal has to do with more about how to maybe register hits on the

[07:39] demigorgan and it's going to be some new thing like that. So I'm reading that Stranger Things thread.

[07:45] Oh, you know, owners are enjoying the game. It's the typical thing. When you spend $9,000 on a toy,

[07:51] you're going to say you're really having a good time. I mean, who's going to open up a $9,000

[07:56] Stranger Things, Ellie, and be like, I'm really not enjoying this game. Nobody, but it's funny to

[08:02] me because it's always happens. It's like the owners, who cares if people don't like the game and

[08:06] you do. Who cares, right? But the overwhelming consensus around Stranger Things is not that positive

[08:14] and there's a reason why it's not that positive and and I'm sorry, but it was a fumbled launch.

[08:21] It was one of the worst ways to show the projector ever. The code is uninspiring. I get that there's

[08:28] a lot of modes in it, but the callouts and the way you play the game, it just doesn't pull you in.

[08:36] There's another game that came out at the same time that pulls you in better and that's Rick and

[08:40] Morty. Now, Rick and Morty is another game. It's like, when is it going to ship? Here we are.

[08:46] Mid-February. Zero games are out the door. I have to say this as number 50 in the lineup.

[08:53] I'm getting probably a game that's going to be built before any games make it out on location.

[08:59] I was hoping the first 20 or so would be out there. So if there were any issues,

[09:04] they would catch them and maybe make a little changes, but they're going all in with the first

[09:09] 50 or so are going to be out the door before any get any location play and that's not a problem,

[09:16] but you know at some point this game's got to be released. At some point you got to let owners have

[09:23] it and we know the games are done. We know they're sitting in boxes. So the only question is what's

[09:28] the hold up? Now I think you're going to see it this week. So I think this is the floodgates

[09:33] are going to open on Rick and Morty and I think they've just been waiting to get the code as great

[09:39] as they can because they want everyone's first impression of this superly hyped game to be as

[09:46] positive as possible. Okay? And I think that's important. I think it's important. It's like, you know,

[09:51] I'm in the Elvira thread and a couple things with Elvira. People are loving the code updates.

[09:56] People are loving the game. It's like, look, Lyman Sheets is going to make a great game.

[10:00] There is a service bulletin if you own an Elvira. There's a service bulletin. I think it's on the back

[10:09] loop, skill shot loop or something like that where you actually have to take your game apart

[10:16] and fix it. Now, service bulletins don't go out very frequently from Stern. I think there was one

[10:22] remember when Game of Thrones had a service bulletin and how to fix the the orbit. I think this

[10:27] is something similar. I think it's like the back orbit skill shot needs to be fixed. Now, what's

[10:33] funny about Stern is when they have a service bulletin, which means this needs to happen on the game,

[10:40] they don't publicize it. They don't proactively reach out. They just put it out there. It's more for

[10:46] like distributors to be aware of something that could be a potential issue with the game that you

[10:51] have to now go fix on your own or maybe you have a good distributor locally. But there is a service

[10:57] bulletin on Elvira if you own the game, take a look for that service bulletin. What else is going

[11:03] on in pinball? Man, man, man, man, not much. We're all just sort of sliding towards March.

[11:10] A lot of, you know, there's nothing to say. I think we'd all be beneficial to all of our health

[11:17] and the pinball hobby. You might as well just take a couple of weeks off from all the the internet

[11:21] forums. Unless you're seeing people play Rick and Morty, there's nothing new, man. There ain't nothing

[11:28] new to talk about. So that is why we interviewed Damien over at Haggis Pinball. I'm going to

[11:34] air it for you right now. Everyone, thank you again for tuning in the Canadian pinball podcast. We'll

[11:40] always make this entertaining. We'll always make it short and to the point. Let's let's let's talk

[11:45] to Damien and see why he came up with this play field method and why he picked Celts. And it's

[11:53] a nice little chat. And then we'll be back this week. I'm also going to interview the man who's

[11:59] done the rounds. And I'm hoping by the time I talk to him, the first unboxing has happened. And

[12:06] that is Mr. Scott Denise. Everyone, this has been Canadian pinball podcast episode 453. We'll talk

[12:12] to you soon. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian pinball podcast. A man

[12:17] coming to us all the way from Tuesday morning in Australia, Damien from Haggis Pinball, Damien,

[12:24] welcome to the show. Thank you very much. Thanks for having me. I've been, Damien, I've been talking

[12:30] a lot about your latest video. And I want to talk about how you guys developed. And I know you

[12:37] didn't create this system. But let's talk about Playfields first. Okay, then we'll talk about Celts

[12:42] the game. Sure. Okay, so we've all seen the video by now. I raved about it on my last show that

[12:49] this sort of seemingly indestructible play field method for listeners of the show. Walk us through

[12:59] how you're making this play field resistant to dimples, cracks and craters.

[13:05] Well, I suppose in the most simplest form we have got a combined birch plywood and acrylic

[13:14] sandwich. If you like of materials that we're using to form our play fields. Okay, so

[13:19] much as simple as that. There's a word underneath. Yep, the next layer is the artwork screen printed

[13:26] to the acrylic. So, and I will hopefully do a video in the next sort of week or two if I get a

[13:33] bit of time to just go through this process. And we sort of have gone back and forth on a number

[13:38] of different ways to achieve this. But at the moment, what we think the best outcome is is we have

[13:43] actually printed the artwork reverse printed transparent onto the back of the acrylic and the white

[13:50] layer that then will normally sit underneath. The color layer is also vinyl onto the wood.

[13:58] Okay, so there's there's art on both the acrylic and the wood?

[14:03] Well, so any art application is always backed up with a layer of white because normally

[14:10] if you, for example, were, even if just with using the current process, if you were to print

[14:16] color onto the wooden play fields as you do and you didn't have a white layer underneath it,

[14:21] you would actually see the wood somewhat through the artwork. Yeah, so there's always a white layer

[14:26] that backs up or sits behind your color layer because that helps give it some vibrancy, it gives it

[14:31] block out. It's what makes it look as good as it looks. So in our instance, we've got the white

[14:37] portion on the wood and we have the color portion on the back of the acrylic.

[14:42] Okay, all right, so I get it. Wood, white on top of the wood, reverse printed onto the acrylic,

[14:48] makes the color as pop, put those together. Now, it is the acrylic adhered to the wood in any way

[14:55] or is it just sitting on top of it? We will at the moment, it's not. So I think, and this is one

[15:01] of the things I need to clarify because I did make the comment about chemically and mechanically

[15:06] bonding and we do have chemical bonding going on but not between those two layers per say.

[15:12] We will and do have a couple of small strategic pieces of sort of high quality commercial

[15:19] double-sided tape effectively. There will be a technical term for this that I'm sure I won't be

[15:23] representing particularly well, but fundamentally actually having those two

[15:31] glued down for one of a better term presents some more problems and concerns with relation to

[15:37] the different substrates and the way that they move. So it's fundamentally mechanically bonded

[15:41] which basically means on bolting the two things together. Okay, now I've got a bunch of questions.

[15:47] But first is, why did you guys do this? What was the genesis or the impetus to try to create this?

[15:57] Well, I mean, look, coming from, I'm not sure if you know much about my history or my background

[16:02] which is not extensive. So when I came into this whole Shebang, you know, less than 18 months ago,

[16:09] I was looking at everything with fresh eyes. So I had no necessary understanding or concept of,

[16:14] well, this is how play fields are manufactured and this is how they've always been manufactured

[16:18] and this is what you do. So I looked at everything like, oh, okay, how about if we do this and if

[16:23] how about if we do that? So the idea of producing some form of hybrid play field or a play field that

[16:30] was made out of a different material and that was probably the first thing that entered my mind.

[16:34] Straight up, it was like, well, this is strange. Why don't we just do that? And then when you start to

[16:39] work through the commercial reality of it, you start to work through the products that are

[16:43] currently available on the market and how you would work with them and how you pull it all

[16:47] together. You find that you sort of end up getting steered back down the path of what everybody does

[16:54] currently because wood is a relatively cheap material. It's obviously exists in a format that

[17:03] means you can make use of it for the purposes of a play field straight away. Oh yeah, they're big flat

[17:09] stable sheets of wood that you can cut. And so you end up, I guess, stepping aside from those more

[17:15] radical concepts and falling back into the into the same truck, what seems to be the same tried and

[17:19] true method. So I guess to try to answer that, to come back and try to answer that question, it was

[17:26] a always a thought right from the start, but it probably will only became paramount to me really

[17:32] in the last sort of three months where I sort of thought I really need to address this problem

[17:36] with the play fields. Otherwise, I end up just producing the exact same play field that's

[17:40] currently being produced and clearly currently has issues. Right. And so you obviously were reading

[17:46] the issues people were having with Stern Games, Jersey Jack Games, Mirko's, Play Fields.

[17:53] With your game Keltz and Haggis Pimball, were you outsourcing play field development?

[18:00] No. No. And in fact, every aspect of manufacturing this machine is done in-house by me

[18:09] within reason. Obviously, I don't have a injection, a plastic injection molding facility. So there's

[18:14] obviously components and bits that you buy in, but anything that I could do in-house, I do, do in-house.

[18:20] So that means I cut the cabinets, I cut the play fields, I cut my own inserts and basically anything

[18:26] that I cannot do. Okay. And did you see that this method or a similar method was done with

[18:33] Thunderbirds? And I believe Team Pimball is the Mafia. And there were previous games in the 90s

[18:38] that also experimented with this kind of play field solution. Have you seen any of those games

[18:45] or did those inspire you at all? Well, finally enough, it was actually, yeah, it was a non-anadietary

[18:50] bellies electra that has a complete polycarb I assume or a plastic top to it. And that was probably

[18:59] one of the things in the end that pushed us over to say, yeah, we can actually do this and achieve

[19:04] this. And yeah, you're absolutely right. Now, obviously, the actual implementation is different

[19:09] between all these various Pimball machines and companies. But yeah, so electra, full polycarb

[19:16] play field, 30 years old. And the one I was playing on you, you wouldn't really know that it was 30

[19:21] years old, to be honest. So Damien, there are the skeptics out there. The Pimball purist, we'll call

[19:27] them, who say that a ball will not roll the same way over this acrylic as it would, would in clear

[19:35] code. What do you think? Are you seeing any difference in gameplay? No, short answer. Yeah, I mean,

[19:43] look, and this is, this has been talked about a lot as well. You're right, there probably will always

[19:47] be purists that will debate the position. And that's fine. That's the way the world works and life

[19:54] works. But as we know, I mean, you know, you've been playing on a bare wooden play field forever,

[20:00] right? So it's always been some version or variation of clear code or polyurethane or wax or

[20:07] something that is separating you effectively from the wood. Really, today's modern clear

[20:12] code is probably more akin to the acrylic that I'm using than they are to wood. So the reality is

[20:17] I'm probably. Yeah, a couple, a couple of questions. So is you, you talked about cost, is it more

[20:24] expensive to do it this way than the traditional wood art clear coat? Yes. Yeah, it is. There's trade-offs

[20:36] and benefits, obviously, because it's a slightly different process. So your material costs go up

[20:41] significantly, but then your time to manufacture reduces and the manual labor that's associated

[20:50] with getting the wooden play field to manufacture also reduces. So you make some savings, you have

[20:56] some increased costs. And overall, it does end up more expensive, you know, not like five times

[21:02] the cost or anything, but it is more expensive. And I just felt that that added expense, the benefits

[21:08] of that still at white, the additional expense. Are we talking twice as much? Can you give a ballpark

[21:15] of, because I think that's to the listeners of the show, they're like, well, that's why Stern's

[21:20] not going to do it. That's why Jersey Jack, it's the cost because they're the bigger companies,

[21:26] they're on a mission to lower their cost and increase their prices. So do you think they're just

[21:32] not looking at this because of the cost associated? Well, obviously, I can't speak for them, but,

[21:38] I mean, commercial reality is obviously always a consideration. I mean, that's the truth of it.

[21:43] You know, I could turn around and probably tell you that I could give you a wooden play field,

[21:48] that I could do the same sledgehammer test with, but it might be 10 times the cost and take 12

[21:53] months to get back to you. I mean, there will always be a solution to a problem, but the reality is,

[21:58] will people pay for it? And yeah, you're right. I mean, bomb is always a consideration. I guess I

[22:02] have the luxury of being about as boutique as they come. You know, I have the ability to move,

[22:09] fairly quickly, or change a process and I guess in reality, take some risks because it is, as you

[22:14] said, it will no doubt be somewhat controversial to the purest or to people that are used to pimble

[22:20] the way they think that it is. And they're probably all considerations for the bigger guys, as well

[22:25] as their turnaround times and lead times. I mean, you know, I'm looking to, if I can make small

[22:30] quantities and sell small quantities of counts, that would be a good thing for me. But from

[22:35] short, for the larger manufacturers, you know, they're looking and they do in order's magnitudes

[22:40] of thousands and thousands of machines. It's a completely different equation I would imagine.

[22:44] Right. You know, it's interesting because when you think about cost, there's also the headache

[22:50] that Jersey Jack and Stern had to endure when they had to send people out, you know, unpopulated

[22:56] playfield. Some people even got fully populated games, you know, swapped in and because of playfields

[23:03] chipping and cracking. And I think it's, you know, it's just music to people's ears, Damien, when

[23:09] they hear like, I could have a game that ostensibly might not wear out forever. Now, talk to me about

[23:17] the wear and tear and I know you've been testing this, but are we seeing any scratches? I had a

[23:23] plastic overlay on my Batman. You see a little bit of, you know, wear and tear on the top, but what

[23:29] was it? What is it like? Is it, is it wear free right now? Or do you think this thing is going to hold

[23:34] up over time? Yeah, look, and it's obviously it's, you know, I've had a crystal ball, then the

[23:40] decisions would be a lot easier. But yeah, it's looked to all intents and purposes. And I don't know

[23:45] the exact material that they currently use for some of the other playfield protectors and hardtops,

[23:50] but we've got a hardened scratch resistant acrylic material. And as I said, I've got a little

[23:57] test rig that's been running. It's now kicked over a million rolls. It's probably up to about

[24:01] 1.2 million rolls of a ball back and forth. And there is no absolutely no sign of wear at all.

[24:09] People have mentioned that that might not be a real world or a real, you know,

[24:14] situation to be testing because there's no metal dust and there's no bits and pieces that might

[24:20] add to that quality. Yeah, look, it's hard. I mean, I've taken a piece of steel wall to this acrylic

[24:27] and it doesn't scratch either. So it's hard. I would love for someone to take some steel wall

[24:34] to their brand new stranger things playfield. I would just pair to see the results of that test.

[24:39] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and look, it's all, even the hammer test and the sledge hammer test. I mean,

[24:44] that's a bit, it obviously creates an impact and shows the product, but it's not really a real world

[24:52] example, right? Because you're not going to get a pinball coming down the same way. You get a

[24:55] sledgehammer coming down. But so it's difficult. And I suppose I can't categorically answer some of

[25:02] those questions about how it'll hold up over the journey. But I am confident that it is a

[25:07] current recent quality product and it's implemented and used in very harsh abrasive environments.

[25:14] So I am very confident. And I guess over the next year or two, we'll see if that's a fair position

[25:22] for me to hold. Now, were you inspired, Damien, by the deep root promise of a sledgehammer?

[25:28] Is that why you guys grab one? No, no, not not specifically. I mean,

[25:36] I just randomly thought, let's just grab a sledgehammer. You never do. Yeah. I mean, so deep roots also

[25:40] promise this ability to create a playfield that's going to be resistant to all the normal things

[25:50] people have been facing with pinball playfield. So and I think I heard from, do you think they're

[25:55] going to go a different method? Do you think we're going to see something similar from them?

[25:59] Yeah, look at the good question. I honestly don't understand. I mean, I guess one of the benefits

[26:04] of just being so busy as I have been in this lead up over the last, feels like a constant lead up.

[26:09] But the current lead up is towards TPS 2020 that I don't actually get a lot of time to sort of sit down

[26:15] and sift through the various posts on Pinside or read much commentary. So I don't know, and I actually

[26:22] don't think they would have said a lot have they about how is that they're even hinted about how

[26:26] is they going to make the playfields? No, we should not. We should find out in mid-March, they're doing

[26:31] your press day, which all will be revealed to the world finally. So it's probably a good thing that

[26:37] you don't read too much, Pinside. You probably end up much happier than all the moaning and groaning.

[26:43] So let's talk about Kelt. So is this playfield going to be in all Kelt's games moving forward?

[26:52] Yes, it will be. To any extra cost? No. Okay. And I can't just add to that if anybody is, you know,

[27:02] so inclined that they don't want one of these playfields, I can manufacture a traditional playfield if

[27:06] that's what people prefer. So I haven't taken that off the table. I'm just not including that as

[27:11] part of what we're offering moving forward. I mentioned, I don't know if you listen to

[27:15] Natives Pimball Podcasts, we're just number one. I did mention on my other show that any thoughts

[27:22] about going into playfield manufacturing as a business model for you guys and just making

[27:29] playfields for people that are impervious to wear and tear. No plans. Like everything in life,

[27:37] I never say never. So I suppose if an opportunity presented itself for people wanted that enough,

[27:42] then sure I would be potentially open to it. But no, at the moment, the direction was always

[27:47] being to start a Pimball manufacturing company. And so my intent is to produce machines. And I

[27:52] guess we'll see if that branches out into anything else. Right. Now on this show, Demi, we talk a lot

[27:58] about theme is everything and I work in marketing. And I'm always hard on themes. I'm just curious.

[28:05] How did you land at Kelt's as the inaugural title for the company? Oh, look, it was just

[28:12] it was just a byproduct, I think of where I was when I started this whole journey. I mean,

[28:17] I literally, and I'm sure people have said it a few times, when I bought my first Pimball manufacturing,

[28:21] which was a pin bot, and I brought that home just prior to September 2018, I didn't know how to

[28:27] take the back class out. Like that was the point I was starting at. And I bought it and I thought,

[28:32] I'll this will be an interesting hobby. I'll learn all about it. I love tinkering. I love figuring

[28:35] things out. So I'll learn and I'll do a restoration. So that what is what basically then fed into me

[28:41] deciding to start the company. So because I set myself a lot of targets and goals to reach,

[28:47] one of them being getting a white wood to TPF 2019, I had a very, very compressed timeline. And

[28:53] starting from that point of basically zero knowledge and I guess it's probably zero understanding

[28:58] of what is involved in doing what I've been doing, licensing and themes just seemed one more thing

[29:05] that was going to be too hard or too far for me to try to get done in the time I needed to.

[29:11] So I think early on the piece, there was probably two things I ruled out. One was RAPS because I didn't

[29:17] know how I was going to make RAPS. And I thought there's no way I'm going to be able to figure that

[29:20] out along with everything else. And the other was theme because I thought I also don't know how to

[29:24] get a theme and the budget required in order to land one, etc, etc. So they just got shelves

[29:29] straight away. KELPS then just sort of, so that meant I was on an original theme.

[29:34] The business partner that I started with needed to step away from the business. So we originally

[29:39] had started with a different theme. So KELPS sort of came about very, very quickly, about eight weeks

[29:44] out from getting a white wood to Texas. And yeah. Is that other theme? Is that other theme still in

[29:51] the cards for a future release? It could be. It could be. I mean, I now that I have now spent

[29:59] the past 18 months heavily engrossed in the industry. Yes, I too appreciate the importance of

[30:04] a theme. And I recognize that pinball number two is definitely going to need to be something that is

[30:12] has that appeal. And it is a licensed product. So maybe further down the track. And there had been

[30:18] interest in that original theme that we had first started talking about. So if the potential arises,

[30:23] sure, there's nothing's off the table. Now, so you made this synaptic leap to start a pinball

[30:31] company. I'm trying to, what was it? What was what made you go from? Yeah, what made you go from

[30:37] having a game, figuring out how to take the translate off to saying I should start a pinball company.

[30:42] Like, did you, are you doing it because you just love it so much? Would you also feel like there's

[30:48] a financially viable weight space in the market for haggis right now? I suppose it's a bit of

[30:58] all of the above. I guess, I mean, it also, it indicates, obviously, my personality type in that,

[31:06] I like a challenge. And I like to think I'm entrepreneurial. So, yeah, when I looked at it at a very

[31:13] high level, I thought the industry is growing. The market's growing. I think there's an opportunity

[31:18] still for another manufacturer. There's no manufacturers in Australia. So, at a very high level,

[31:23] I sort of thought that there was an opportunity there to start a business and sure, get financial reward

[31:29] for it. But equally, then I love pinball. I always have. It was one of those, like everybody says.

[31:35] I guess they fall back in love with it from their childhood. And it was just a continual

[31:44] It just reaffirms my interest and my love for the hobby and everything about it. The more and more,

[31:50] I worked on it and the deeper and deeper I got into it because it had so many aspects and

[31:54] so many challenges and so many things to figure out. And I think, as I said, that just matches my

[31:59] personality type perfectly. So, it was just a continual growth, I think. Right. And so, so,

[32:05] Deamann, is haggis your dad jab right now? Is this what you're focused on? Yeah, it has been now

[32:11] for over 12 months. Okay, great. And, and Keltz, is it out? Is it chipping?

[32:18] There will be, so the first production machines are going to make their way to TpF. So, yeah. So,

[32:25] effectively, when I get to TpF and certainly when I get back from TpF and MGC, that will be all

[32:32] of the final bits of development done. And it will effectively be rubber stamped as this is now

[32:37] our production model. And now we are just simply making what we have right now. Right. Now,

[32:44] you've, you've seen the hobby, you've seen the boutique companies. What was it like watching another

[32:50] boutique spooky pinball? Were you watching their Rick and Morty? Was it, was that another thing that

[32:55] reinforced theme watching them sell out in four hours of game? Oh, no question, no question. I mean,

[33:01] look, I knew that, you know, I probably knew that well on truly six months ago. I think, you know,

[33:06] to be honest, probably the first six months into this journey, I was probably still saying, no,

[33:10] no, there's room for an unlicensed theme. And, and the reality is, I suppose I sort of forget

[33:15] myself now because it's been such a, a hectic schedule. But part of these decisions early on

[33:22] in the piece about whether or not we could manufacture was things like, yeah, TNA coming out, the

[33:27] Mafia had just been announced. And I sort of looked at those two things and went, well, these are

[33:31] original themes, single level playfield, TNA has been unbelievably well received. And so that was

[33:37] that little bit of catalyst in my head that said, right, okay, we can do a single level playfield,

[33:41] we can do an original thing. And I think I held on to that probably for the good six months

[33:46] thereafter until I started to realize, well, really, we really do have to move with a licensed

[33:52] theme moving forward. But, you know, it helps is what it is. It's representative of where I was.

[33:58] And what I've managed to achieve, what do you mean? That is Kelt's represent where you were in

[34:04] life. I just want to know the little bit of that story because, well, I mean, I mean, insofar as,

[34:09] it's an original theme and it's a single level playfield because where I was at that point when I

[34:14] started, that was basically zero knowledge, zero knowledge, zero appreciation for the industry. So,

[34:19] it was, it was very much, you know, big rose colored glasses on thinking, this is going to be

[34:24] fantastic. I'm just going to make a pinball machine and I'll make it fun and every

[34:28] one will love it. So, okay, okay, I didn't know if you went like full paleo living in a cave and

[34:32] you went back to our ancestral roots for a while. Okay, I do have my mother's Scottish. So, there is

[34:39] a, there is a tie there to the Kelt, which is partly why that's the thing because it was,

[34:45] it was familiar and I thought it would lend itself well to a bit of, you know, comic relief.

[34:49] Right. Now, you, you, you are seized. Am I saying that right? Aziz, how do I say it? I always say it

[34:54] wrong. That's better. Second wise better. Aziz. Aziz. Okay, you guys spend a fortune importing these

[35:00] games from Stern and these other companies was part of the Genesis to sort of have something made

[35:05] locally so people aren't, aren't paying through the nose to enjoy new pinball. Yeah, definitely.

[35:10] I mean, being the only Australian manufacturer, Australian vice manufacturer certainly. Yeah,

[35:15] that was certainly appealing for sure. I thought that would also, you know, at least maybe add a

[35:21] little bit of interest to the journey into the company that doesn't currently exist in the,

[35:25] in the worldwide market. Right. Well, and curious too, as you start a boutique and you see the other

[35:32] boutiques and certain, certain things they've done to sort of, you know, get, get their feet off the

[35:37] ground. Have you explored limited number of Kelt's games just to move it and then get on to game

[35:44] number two or is it just as many as we get orders will build like what's the, what's the strategy for

[35:50] the launch? No, I will be and you got an exclusive here because I haven't told anybody this but yeah,

[35:55] we will be limiting it to 200, 200 machines only which you might think is probably two, it's probably

[36:00] 150 too many. I'm not sure. But yes, we will be, I will be putting a lid on it. I'm very respectful

[36:08] to my guess. Look, you can always, you can always go down the number. Look, at least it's not 5,000

[36:14] limited editions of Willy Wonka. That's right. So, okay. So this game, you're coming to TPS. Now,

[36:23] any worry that this year's TPS feels like it could be a crowded space. We might have guns and

[36:29] roses and ninja turtles. We're going to have deep roots going to finally show their game. Who

[36:35] knows if there's going to be another game from Chicago gaming? Is, is, is there any anxiety that

[36:41] it's becoming really crowded? No, not really. I think I've already, you know, as we talk about

[36:48] themes, I think I've already sort of understood that this machine isn't necessarily going to be for

[36:53] everybody. In fact, it might not be for a lot of people and that's okay. So whether there's, you know,

[37:00] some big licensed machines that come out, I don't know that that's going to necessarily have

[37:05] a bearing because I don't know that people are going to be tossing up between, hey, I'll buy a

[37:08] kelp so I'll buy the next guns and roses. I think the people that will be interested in buying a

[37:13] kelp will be interested in your respect here because it probably appeals to them for a different

[37:18] reason. Whether that's because of the company and the journey that we're on, whether that's because

[37:23] they see or they have some sort of affiliation to that Celtic community and they would love to have

[37:29] one that represents their family or their parents or whatever. So no, not really, not really.

[37:37] I think if it was a big, if it was sort of a big license thing that we were going after as well,

[37:41] maybe because there's almost the only so much room in the market. But now I think mine's different

[37:46] enough that it'll, it'll be what it'll be. Now, Damian, I'm going to offer you, and this is

[37:51] another exclusive, I guess, I will offer my services for free as a marketing professional, as

[37:58] you're developing other themes, I will happily bounce ideas back and forth with you. We'll do it off

[38:05] line. I'll sign an NDA so that if we land somewhere nice, because there's a lot of open IP

[38:13] that is available, even if it's not licensed themes. There's a lot of stories out there

[38:19] that you can use under open copyright. So yeah, lots out there. So happy to discuss that. So game

[38:27] number two, is it in development? No, it's not, and thank you very much for that offer by the way.

[38:32] I think I will probably speak with you. No, not currently. As I said, I'm just sort of, we're

[38:38] finishing off the final bits and pieces for Calc. So it's really just a matter of buckling down

[38:43] right now. We've had some very, very high level discussions around what potential themes would be,

[38:49] and some of the direction we would potentially take, but we haven't sort of started in earnest as yet.

[38:55] The idea or the plan will be to let's get Texas and MGC out of the way behind us. We'll get back

[39:02] to Australia. And much in the same way I did after TPS 2019, I'll reassess where we're at, and we'll

[39:09] work a plan forward for the for the next 12 months. Sounds like a plan. So hopefully I'll see you. I'm

[39:16] still debating where I'm going with these shows. There's Texas, there's MGC. I got to go to a wedding

[39:23] in Ireland in March. It's getting hard. It's getting hard. Yeah. You'd be close if you,

[39:28] that is for me though. I know. I know. So do you have a collection of games right now in your home?

[39:35] I have a few. Yeah, I've got what have I got? I got Dr. Who, Adam's family, judge,

[39:41] dread, and get away and a couple of pimples. Okay. What's your overall assessment about

[39:48] modern pimple? How do you feel? Do you feel people are getting their money's worth? Do you feel

[39:53] these games are as creative as they could be? What are your thoughts? You're leading me down

[39:58] apart. Yeah. The dark side of Canada's pitball podcast. Welcome to Canada's pitball podcast. Yeah.

[40:06] I generally am a very positive person. I'm one of those, and this will probably be an answer

[40:11] that's not controversial enough for you. But I want these people to give an analogy. It's very

[40:16] hard for me to go into a movie cinema and not enjoy a movie. If there's something,

[40:22] like if the movie is universally hated, there's usually something I can find that I like. It's either

[40:28] the cinematography or it's the direction or it's the actor or it's the location. There's usually

[40:33] something. And I'm pretty much the same when it comes to pimple. I just enjoy pimple. I enjoy

[40:38] everything about pimple. So modern machines, value for money. Look, I don't know. It's very

[40:46] hard for me to say, I know that for what I've been through making this machine, there is an awful

[40:53] amount of work involved. There is an awful amount of expense involved. So whilst I guess

[40:59] bomb could be reduced to a point, there are still a lot of other overheads and money that goes into

[41:05] making these things happen that isn't necessarily obvious when you just look at the things that are

[41:11] on a machine. So value for money. Yeah. I'm not sure. And I can't really comment. And

[41:17] Damien, I think you bring up a good point because there's been a lot of just negativity. People

[41:23] are getting burnt out of the hobby. Sorry, Bubba's barking. But it's a toy meant for enjoyment.

[41:30] And I think most people would agree that positivity is something that this hobby does need. People

[41:37] are getting burnt out. They're forgetting that these things are toys for entertainment.

[41:41] Obviously, I wouldn't have a show if I just said, pimple is awesome because there's a lot of

[41:47] high prices and there's a lot of expectations when you start making a theme based on people's beloved

[41:55] favorite movie, favorite TV show, favorite band. But it's a good time to be in pimple, right? Because

[42:01] we have nothing but a ton of options coming in 2020. What are you most excited to see released

[42:07] this year besides counts? I am very used to say the new Guns and Roses machine. I only actually played

[42:16] the data race Guns and Roses not too long ago for the first time. And I just loved it. Absolutely,

[42:21] loved it. So I am very excited to see what that looks like. Are you a big team in our fan? Because

[42:27] people have been saying, I don't think it's going to sell. I think people underestimate how big Guns is.

[42:33] Yeah. I mean, I love music. I've played in bands and all that sort of things over the years.

[42:39] So Guns and Roses is one of those bands that's on my rotation list all the time anyway. So

[42:45] sure. And the fact that slashes such a big pinhead just lends itself to being a good machine.

[42:51] So yeah, I'm excited about that. Tenage Mutant Ninja Turtles loved it when the original film came

[42:56] out in the cinemas. I don't know how old I was then. But yeah, not as excited. I don't know why.

[43:01] I just I don't know. I just just just don't for whatever reason. Because you're a grown man. That's why.

[43:11] You age out of turtles. I keep telling this to people. It's one of those properties where it's

[43:16] neat. But nobody I'm 43. Nobody my age casually socially is bringing up Ninja Turtles.

[43:25] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look. I don't know. I mean, this is one of these things. It's probably

[43:31] these conversations that we can have later remain. China understand what it is that entices people.

[43:37] Obviously, Stern has a very good formula and they've been able to get all of the,

[43:41] you know, the big ticket movies and et cetera, et cetera. But I don't know. It's difficult. It's

[43:44] difficult for me to even think about what I would imagine would be a a sure fight hit.

[43:50] Right. All right. So Damian, thank you for taking the time. So I want to let listeners of the show

[43:55] just just know so if they want to check out your new game, you're going to be at TpF and MGC in 2020.

[44:03] Correct. I'm going to run at the game with a hammer. So get that glass off because I want to make sure

[44:08] this thing lives up to the hype. I want to want to bring a spell on you. Right. Well, I want to

[44:13] thank you for taking the time. Obviously that video did create a lot of conversation. And I do think

[44:19] that this method, if it stands up to the test of time, is something that all pinball collectors

[44:26] want to see implemented in their games because nothing is greater than having a game that does

[44:31] and fall apart. Excellent. Now, thank you very much. Having me. I appreciate it. All right, Damian.

[44:36] Thank you so much. Cheers.
