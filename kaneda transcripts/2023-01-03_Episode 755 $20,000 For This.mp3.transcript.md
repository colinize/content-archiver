[00:00] You know I'm laughing inside, I'm laughing inside because I'm looking at this pinball

[00:23] machine and I'm saying to myself, Chris, you love pinball, you've been following pinball

[00:28] for almost a decade, you've seen all the magical worlds under glass that have come out back

[00:34] in the day, you know what those games used to cost, you know what modern pinball costs,

[00:40] you know what creativity is in pinball, you know what these companies are capable of,

[00:45] and then you ask yourself one simple question, how can it be that the most expensive pinball

[00:51] machine in the history of pinball is also, I would argue, one of the least impressive

[00:58] machines I've ever seen.

[01:00] I'm sorry people, this is a $20,000 pinball machine from the factory, this is the highest

[01:09] MSRP ever, ever of a new in-box pinball machine ever on planet Earth.

[01:16] And when I tell you that and what this beautifully creative hobby is capable of, and if I were

[01:22] to tell you this is the most expensive pinball machine ever created on planet Earth, and

[01:27] then you open up your eyes and this is the pin we get, this is pathetic, this is pathetic,

[01:33] when you think about what's the most expensive car on planet Earth, or the most expensive

[01:37] watch, or the most expensive house, right, anything that's the most expensive of its

[01:42] category should be the most impressive.

[01:46] This thing for $20,000 should have so many elements in it that make you say wow, how

[01:53] did they do that, how did they engineer this, look at the beautiful artwork, look at the

[01:58] magnets, look at the teleportation, look at the levitation, look at all the magical things

[02:02] they crammed into this play field, they crammed into this world under glass, and then you

[02:06] look down at this machine and it's Photoshop, drag and drop, artwork, it doesn't even look

[02:13] that nice, and I don't care how many Keith Elwin loops or shots or this or combos, that

[02:19] doesn't matter, it's completely irrelevant.

[02:23] This thing looks like it's a stern home pin, like one of those the pins, this looks like

[02:27] it's something that's cheaper than a stern pro, and then you're gonna march it out into

[02:32] the pinball world and put the highest price ever of any pinball machine ever, and then

[02:39] you wonder why people are saying this is enough, this is ridiculous.

[02:46] Now look, I'm not even that upset, I'll tell you why, I was not gonna buy this pin to begin

[02:52] with, and now I really don't want this pin.

[02:55] See I would be more upset if this was like back to the future or big trouble in little

[03:00] China and they nailed it and it was 20 grand, because then I would have to go to the bank

[03:05] and get out $20,000.

[03:08] But if you're gonna buy this machine, you literally are telegraphing to the world, you pretty

[03:14] much have a lot of money, and that's it, that's it, that is the only reason why you would

[03:19] buy this machine, you're a James Bond fanatic, you have a lot of money and you don't care,

[03:26] and for those gentlemen, I'm happy for you, but I'm gonna tell you right now, there are

[03:30] not 500 of those gentlemen, this game is not gonna sell out, this game is not gonna be

[03:37] spoken for, and there is no way distributors are even paying $19,000 for this game, so here's

[03:43] what's gonna happen, Stern's gonna give these games to distros for $15,000 and then allow

[03:49] them some wiggle room as they try to find buyers for the game, but look I don't even

[03:55] wanna talk about much on this game other than this, this is indicative of where pinball

[04:02] is headed, and that's the real tragedy of today, that Stern Pinball thinks were stupid enough

[04:10] that they could drop this pinball machine out into the world and we as a pinball community

[04:18] would look at something like this and say this is good enough for me to spend $20,000,

[04:26] you add in tax and shipping $22,000 to get this game to your door, a single level game in which

[04:36] they've shown absolutely no code, it does have physical scoring reel, it looks like an LCD,

[04:43] but it's an actual physical scoring reel in the back, and then you go over the game and you're

[04:48] like that's the problem as I go over this game and everything I look at doesn't come anywhere

[04:53] close to making me go wow, how did they do that, let me repeat that for $20,000 there should be

[05:02] multiple sections in a pinball machine that make you go wow, how did they do that, or wow,

[05:10] look how beautiful that looks, are there even any sculpts in this game other than a plastic hat,

[05:17] so yeah like this is it, Stern Pinball showed us something that is absolutely going to enrage

[05:24] a lot of the pinball community, and I'm telling you right now pinball is headed for a really

[05:29] strange 2023, because now Stern Pinball has shown us that they think this is a viable area of the

[05:39] pinball market, and I know what you're saying, you're saying, Canada you've been a hypocrite,

[05:43] no, I've been saying this from day one, I think there are people out there who would easily spend

[05:50] $20,000 or more on a pinball machine, but not like this, you want to sell to your rich client

[05:59] something where they can see the value and where the money went, this is like trying to sell someone

[06:05] a Jurassic Park Pro, and only because you're going to make 500 of them and no more you can charge

[06:12] $20,000 for them, the only thing you're spending money on here is the scarcity, that is it, you're

[06:17] not getting any material costs, you're not going to get tons of assets, you're not going to get

[06:22] movie clips galore, you're not going to get anything that you think you would normally get

[06:27] in a fully featured game, and so once again I'm disappointed because I would love there to be

[06:33] like a working magic girl kind of game that visually blows you away, that has mechs that

[06:40] blow you away, that does magical stuff that blows you away, and then yes make it super limited,

[06:46] and then I might even think about it being worth $20,000 or $30,000, but this is not the case,

[06:54] this is simply stern pinball making, the equivalent of a top's baseball card, and we're only making

[07:01] 500 gold rookie cards and that's it, and they're trying to get people to race towards that aspect

[07:08] of the game, I mean I'm literally looking at the plastics on the slingshot area and how lazy the

[07:15] art package is on this game, it's literally just blue plastic with 007 written on it, that's it,

[07:22] no other detail, no other attention to art, nothing, this is quite honestly one of the ugliest looking

[07:29] stern pinball machines that has come out in the last 10 years, let me repeat that, this is arguably

[07:37] one of the ugliest stern machines that has come out in the last 10 years, and it is also the most

[07:42] expensive pinball machine of all time, hard stop, that's it, do I need to say anything else about

[07:48] this game, the floor is yours American pinball, the floor is yours Jersey Jack on your next game,

[07:55] the floor is yours now spooky pinball with the Scooby-Doo, the reason why I think this is a

[08:00] stupid move for a stern too, I think it just puts a really bad taste in people's mouth about stern

[08:05] pinball, I think it upsets people that are Keith Elwin fans that want to own all of his games,

[08:11] they don't want to own this, they're not going to want to spend $20,000 on this, and 500 I would

[08:17] argue this too, I think 500 is even too many, I think if you want to charge 20k for a game like

[08:23] this, and it's the 60th anniversary, you only should have made 60, I know it doesn't make much

[08:28] financial sense, but nothing about this game makes financial sense to anybody, so I would rather the

[08:35] collectors at least win out, because 500 of them, people forget this, like there were 500 like

[08:40] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castles, they're not that hard to find, if they actually make 500 of

[08:47] these I'm going to be shocked, there is no way they're going to get 500 orders for this machine,

[08:52] and I think it's going to be another example, stern pinball just not understanding the market,

[08:58] look we would spend the money if the magic was there, there is no way this game has enough magic

[09:05] in it to be worth $20,000, everybody thank you so much for listening to Canadian Pinball Podcast,

[09:11] I just wanted to get this off my chest, I will also say this, I really don't care about this pin,

[09:16] this pin is going to land in the pinball world like a fart in the wind, we're all going to play it

[09:21] at TPF, and we're all going to say hey look that was fun, but what a joke for $20,000, and anyone who

[09:28] buys one is not going to get padded on the back, people are going to look at you guys like maybe

[09:32] you're a little bit of a fool with your money, when you spend the most amount of money ever on any

[09:37] pinball machine that has ever been released, you should feel pride in that, but how can you feel

[09:43] pride buying this game, how do you not feel like a little bit of a sucker inside if you buy this

[09:48] game, look not even the most verbose and the most entertaining podcasters and distributors

[09:55] are going to be able to even convince you that this is worth anywhere near that money, you put

[10:01] this game next to Batman SLE, next to Elvira 40th, those two games are stunning, and even though

[10:08] they're very expensive you could understand why both of those full featured games that are some

[10:14] of the greatest works of art in the history of pinball, why those games could command prices

[10:20] around $20,000 or pirate CE, and then you look at this game, I don't even want to keep talking about

[10:26] it, but I will say this as like annoying as this game is, I don't really care about it, I am still

[10:32] more heartbroken over the fact that it's only Toy Story 4, because I really wanted a Toy Story

[10:39] pinball machine, I don't care about James Bond, I don't care about 60 years of James Bond, I'm just

[10:46] happy that I'm not a James Bond fanatic and there's not like a little piece of me that wants this

[10:52] machine, there is none of me that would ever even consider taking this game, I wouldn't even buy this

[10:58] game for $10,000, that's how little I care about this ridiculous cash grab greedy move

[11:06] by Stern Pinball, mark my words, it's gonna backfire, this thing is not gonna sell,

[11:12] and then we're gonna see this thing, I'm done, you're gonna see this thing trade hands for $15,000

[11:17] in a couple months, mark my words, everybody canade it out, thank you for the Twippy votes.
