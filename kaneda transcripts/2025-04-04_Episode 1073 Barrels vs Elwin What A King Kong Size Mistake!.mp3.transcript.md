[00:00] You've got 52 weeks in a year.

[00:22] You've got 52 weeks David Van Es and Barrels of Fun to release your new pinball machine

[00:28] that you've been working on and you're going to release the same week as a Keith Elwyn game.

[00:36] The best designer in all of pinball with the best code team in all of pinball, you're

[00:42] going to launch your game on the same exact week as Keith Elwyn.

[00:47] You didn't listen to a word I said to you, David Van Es, when we talked.

[00:52] I said, if you're going to invite people, invite them on a Friday.

[00:58] It's the slowest day of the week for people and especially if you're going to ask people

[01:04] to take off of work and go to Texas to see your new game, you think people are going

[01:10] to take off on a Tuesday?

[01:13] And it's like on top of all of this, all of the stuff happening in the global economic

[01:19] world with tariffs and I'm reading Pinside and it's the conversation everywhere.

[01:26] It doesn't matter whether it's Barrels of Fun or Stern Pinball or JJP or Alice's Adventures

[01:32] in Wonderland.

[01:34] Everybody realizes the world is upside down.

[01:38] Things are going to cost a lot more money.

[01:41] You have lost a lot of money.

[01:43] Sure, some very wealthy people like Bill Brandis are going to make money during these declines.

[01:48] What the rich do, they buy when the market's tank.

[01:52] I get it.

[01:53] You have so much money, you don't need more.

[01:55] Go make more money now.

[01:57] It is what it is, right?

[01:58] It's the way it works.

[02:00] But I don't understand how nobody is reading the room.

[02:04] Nobody's using common sense.

[02:07] On the same week, everybody is watching their stocks get hammered.

[02:12] Their 401Ks get hammered.

[02:15] You think people are going to take money out of their own pockets and pay to go to Barrels

[02:22] of Fun and also have to pay out of pocket to go to Stern?

[02:27] I am vehemently opposed.

[02:29] I am never going to out of my own pocket pay to go to these companies to help them sell

[02:37] their products.

[02:38] I mean, think about the inane-ness in all of that.

[02:42] When Nintendo wants to show off its new Switch 2 system, what do they do?

[02:46] They're in New York City because the media are here.

[02:50] They came to where the media are.

[02:53] They're not making media fly to Japan or fly somewhere to see the new console.

[02:58] And you know what?

[02:59] I get it.

[03:00] We're not real media.

[03:01] But man, it's also like there's not many of us.

[03:05] And Jersey Jack did it right.

[03:07] They paid for everybody's travel.

[03:10] And they didn't demand we like sign an embargo.

[03:13] They didn't even demand we say nice stuff about the game.

[03:16] And we didn't say nice stuff about Avatar, but they made a class act.

[03:22] That's how you do it.

[03:24] Barrels of Fun, you think on a Tuesday on April 15th, in the middle of the work week,

[03:30] that I'm just going to tell everybody I'm working with all the projects I'm on, stop.

[03:35] I got to go down to Texas to spend a full day down there.

[03:39] And they also have like a dinner schedule.

[03:41] You're almost asking people to spend a day and a half like missing a lot of work.

[03:45] I'm sorry.

[03:46] But most of us, you know, most of us, I don't know, like I don't have the freedom of some

[03:50] of these other content creators apparently who could just always be running around amusement

[03:54] parks and doing whatever they want every single day.

[03:57] Right now I'm working on Mikalov Ultra and FIFA Club World Cup and FIFA World Cup 2026.

[04:04] It's going to get really exciting.

[04:05] I can't wait for you guys to see the stuff we're cooking up.

[04:08] But I can't just like tell everybody, sorry.

[04:10] And I'm also going to Scotland next Thursday for my brother-in-law's wedding.

[04:16] Super excited about that.

[04:17] So if you're in Scotland, hit Canada up.

[04:19] Hey, look, I don't pretend to know the way the world is going to shake out, but I do

[04:24] understand human behavior.

[04:28] And right now a lot of people are nervous.

[04:31] Right now a lot of people are anxious.

[04:33] And right now the dumbest thing you could probably do with your money right now is sink

[04:39] it into a pinball machine.

[04:41] And I understand it's weird, right?

[04:42] Because seemingly people are still buying, right?

[04:45] That's just like the American way now.

[04:46] We just buy our way through everything regardless if the house is on fire.

[04:51] You're going to keep spending money and buying new furniture for the house.

[04:55] Like they sold all those medieval madness games.

[04:57] I think the price was right.

[04:59] And I think medieval madness is a sure thing is starting to sell a ton of King Kongs if

[05:05] they raise the price.

[05:07] We'll talk about that in a minute, but man, I just want to talk about barrels of funds,

[05:11] a marketing decision.

[05:13] And here's why I think it's crazy because look, Stern pinball sent out an email before barrels

[05:20] of funds.

[05:21] So I got the Stern email on April 2nd.

[05:23] Sorry I'm late with this news because I've just been so busy at work.

[05:28] That one oh two PM on April 2nd.

[05:30] I got an email and an invite.

[05:33] Thank you from Zach Sharp over at Stern.

[05:36] And he said, we're thrilled to invite you to an exclusive pinball media showing at our

[05:41] office of our upcoming cornerstone game.

[05:44] Join us on Thursday, April 17th for an early hands on experience from 10 to 10 30 factory

[05:53] tour 10 30 to 11 30 overview and open play of cornerstone with the lead designer, programmer

[06:00] and Stern team 11 30 to one lunch catered by a start.

[06:06] Okay, so they're going to pay for the food.

[06:08] There's no pay for travel.

[06:10] There's no pay for hotel.

[06:11] But man, the food's going to be catered one to 6 30 PM individual demo interview content

[06:18] creation sessions.

[06:19] Okay, so they give everybody five and a half hours to sort of get all the content you want.

[06:24] 6 30 PM dinner catered by stirred.

[06:27] Okay, so they're going to pay for your lunch and dinner, but they're not going to pay for

[06:31] you to get there.

[06:32] They then say this is a great opportunity to get early access and explore the game firsthand

[06:37] with opportunities to create some fun content for the community.

[06:42] Don't you tell me Stern pinball what fun content I'm going to create.

[06:46] I'll come down there just to create content that sucks.

[06:50] You know, you don't tell me my content's fun.

[06:52] They will tell me it's fun.

[06:54] They then write if you're not able to join us, we will have games available for the public

[06:59] at the pinball at the zoo show in Kalamazoo, Michigan, April 17th through the 19th.

[07:06] Please RSVP.

[07:08] Okay, so that came from Zach on April 2nd.

[07:13] All right, so everybody knew that right?

[07:15] Everybody knew that.

[07:16] I bet Carrie Hardy told everybody instantly on his Patreon page.

[07:20] Everybody knew that.

[07:22] So then what happens?

[07:24] So knowing that's the date, right?

[07:26] Keith Elwin on Thursday, barrels of fun sends out an invite the following day at 6 30 PM,

[07:34] April 3rd from Brian Savage, co-founder of barrels of fun.

[07:39] He says, hello media folks.

[07:42] The day has come and we are all very excited to show you our second game.

[07:47] It is an epic playing game.

[07:49] And yes, the ball will get eaten.

[07:53] Is this confirmation that it's Dune?

[07:55] I actually think it's Little Shop of Horrors.

[07:57] I mean it.

[07:58] I think it's Little Shop of Horrors.

[08:00] That just aligns with me more the campy fun stuff.

[08:03] If you're called barrels of fun, are you really going to make Dune?

[08:08] Dune is not a fun movie.

[08:10] It's a serious sort of sci-fi melodramatic movie.

[08:14] It's not fun.

[08:16] And so I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I think barrels of fun's game is

[08:22] Little Shop of Horrors.

[08:24] And I think what eats the ball is the Audrey 5 or the Audrey 5.

[08:28] Is it Audrey 5, right?

[08:30] And I think it's going to be based on the Steve Martin movie.

[08:33] That's Canadian's final guess.

[08:35] I don't think it's Goonies.

[08:37] There was a rumor a long time ago that a new pinball company was going to make

[08:42] Little Shop of Horrors.

[08:44] I think that was barrels of fun getting the license for this theme.

[08:49] I don't see anyone putting the dots together, but that's my final guess.

[08:53] Again, I'm making this guess because nobody wants it to be Dune.

[08:56] Nobody.

[08:58] All right, he then writes, we want you to come to Houston,

[09:00] April 15, 10.30 AM to 4 PM to view this exciting new game

[09:06] and take a tour of the factory.

[09:09] You will have the opportunity to play the game, create your own assets for your

[09:14] followers, and talk to the designers and engineers.

[09:18] If you can't attend, we understand and that will not change your allocation schedule.

[09:24] We will have assets for you if you can't come, so no worries.

[09:27] Okay, I'm going to request the assets because I'm not going.

[09:32] I can't go.

[09:34] It's in the middle of the work week.

[09:36] It's just not a good time.

[09:38] I also know that this game is already in a box.

[09:41] I know that this game is going to end up down the street at automated,

[09:46] you know, like a week or two after this.

[09:48] So why would I spend a few thousand dollars to travel to either of these companies

[09:53] when I can spend $5 on some gasoline and drive to automate it and have the entire

[10:00] day in front of the machine in a quiet environment?

[10:04] Maybe it's just me, but like, I don't need to do this.

[10:06] You know what I'm saying?

[10:06] Like, I know everyone else is going to interview the designers and the coders

[10:10] and you know the usual suspects.

[10:11] They're going to go.

[10:13] They're going to go shoot all this stuff and that's their prerogative,

[10:16] but it won't be me.

[10:17] There's an image of an invite.

[10:20] You're invited.

[10:20] Come see and play in person.

[10:22] Barrels of funds.

[10:23] Second release.

[10:25] And then Epic is just the beginning is what it says here in exclamation points.

[10:31] And so there we have it.

[10:32] The world's economies are collapsing.

[10:36] People are losing tons of money.

[10:38] So what a perfect time to launch two pinball machines on top of each other.

[10:42] When there's all this time in a year, we're going to launch two machines on top of each other.

[10:48] And neither machine is Harry Potter, which is the bigger theme than all of these titles.

[10:53] And knowing that Harry Potter is right around the corner.

[10:57] I don't even know, like, why would you pull the trigger on either of these games?

[11:00] Because we know they're going to make so many.

[11:02] And look, we all know that Stern is going to raise prices on King Kong.

[11:06] 13.6 is the guess.

[11:08] Maybe more.

[11:09] Look what Nintendo did yesterday.

[11:11] They raised the price of the Switch to it was supposed to be 400.

[11:15] Now it's 450.

[11:16] Games are like $90.

[11:18] People are just tired.

[11:20] You look at the Nintendo people talking in the thread.

[11:23] Everyone's just complaining about price.

[11:25] We're over it.

[11:27] We're over it.

[11:28] The world's become so expensive.

[11:30] And what's happening is just this overwhelming vibe.

[11:34] I don't need this stuff.

[11:36] This stuff shouldn't be this much money.

[11:38] You got so greedy during COVID, now there's no wiggle room.

[11:42] But as a marketing decision for David Vaness and Brian Savage to do it like this,

[11:49] and I said this, it was going to bite them in the butt,

[11:51] and it's going to bite them in the butt.

[11:53] Because the mistake they made was they waited to have games in boxes,

[11:58] and now they're dropping the same week as Keith Elwin.

[12:01] They should have launched this thing two, three weeks ago.

[12:03] They should have brought it to freaking TPF.

[12:06] They would have captured that show,

[12:08] and they would have got a lot of orders at that show.

[12:11] Look at all the orders medieval madness got.

[12:13] And it's the same damn game with just Blue Armor.

[12:15] This would have been the new game that would have been looked at

[12:19] probably with the most enthusiasm, but they didn't do that.

[12:23] And now they're going to get destroyed by launching on the same week as King Kong.

[12:29] Because even King Kong, I think, is not going to sell like people think.

[12:33] Because again, look what's happening in the world.

[12:37] Again, you might as well wait to see Harry Potter.

[12:40] Are you guys really so rich that you're going to buy a King Kong LE

[12:45] and then buy a freaking Harry Potter CE?

[12:48] You're going to drop like $28,000 on two pinball machines

[12:53] as your investment portfolios are losing so much money.

[12:57] I mean, look, maybe some of you guys are, but I have to be honest.

[13:00] I just think the vibe right now amongst a lot of people is just be careful.

[13:07] Like the world is shaky.

[13:09] Everyone's anxious.

[13:11] It's not a time to act like everything is fine.

[13:15] Everything is not fine.

[13:16] Now it's not like the world is ending, but I think a lot of people are just going to be more conservative.

[13:22] I think they're going to be more patient.

[13:24] I also think people are just over the high pinball prices for so long now.

[13:29] And also just all these games crashing on top of each other

[13:34] as the tariff news sweeps across the world.

[13:38] It's just horrible timing.

[13:41] Timing matters.

[13:43] It's also just stupid.

[13:44] It is so stupid.

[13:46] If your barrel's a fun, I would have waited.

[13:49] I would have just waited now.

[13:51] Like nobody is going to pull the trigger on Tuesday,

[13:55] knowing what they're going to see on Thursday.

[13:58] And I think even when Friday rolls around,

[14:01] people are probably going to wait until they see Harry Potter.

[14:04] You might as well wait because then you're going to get to see Harry Potter.

[14:08] You're also going to get to see Predator in like three weeks or two weeks.

[14:12] It's like four new games in like four weeks.

[14:16] And everyone's lost a lot of money and everyone's a little nervous

[14:19] and everyone's a little anxious.

[14:21] You kind of have to be in a state of suspended jubilee

[14:26] to drop this much money on pinball machines.

[14:28] Remember, you know what I'm saying?

[14:30] Like this whole thing used to make you feel giddy and excited, not stressed out.

[14:35] I would be stressed out right now if with everything going on in the world,

[14:40] I took any of my money and bought a pinball machine.

[14:43] I would. I am so happy.

[14:46] I did not listen to my financial advisor.

[14:48] She wanted me to take half of my apartment sale money

[14:52] and put it into the market a month ago.

[14:55] And I said, nope, I am putting 100% of that money against my mortgage.

[15:00] I'm knocking it all the way down to a low amount.

[15:03] And that's it. I live in this house.

[15:05] We use it every day. It's our family home.

[15:08] This matters more to me.

[15:09] Investing in this and getting this paid off matters more to me.

[15:14] And I'm so happy I did that because if I had bought in when she wanted me to,

[15:20] I would have lost like 100 grand and then I would be so depressed right now.

[15:25] I'd be as depressed as John Wick owners

[15:27] realizing Tim Sexton has left stern pinball and their games will never be finished.

[15:33] Stern's not going to make John Wick any better.

[15:35] You've got a sinking asset.

[15:37] John Wick, L.E.'s are going to be like $7,000 real soon.

[15:41] So, man, it's going to be fun to watch though, everybody.

[15:45] I'm happy to watch this stuff from the sidelines.

[15:47] Keep my money in my pocket.

[15:49] Why would I chase after this stuff?

[15:52] It makes no sense.

[15:53] And I think everyone's going to learn a real lesson now.

[15:57] You've got to come out during a window in which you can be the focus

[16:02] and you never want to compete with someone that's better than you.

[16:06] Think about it.

[16:07] Why would anybody want to compete with Keith Elwin right now?

[16:10] Why?

[16:10] He is arguably the best.

[16:13] And Stern's got their new platform with their bigger screen

[16:16] and it's going to be the most impressive looking stern machine probably to date.

[16:20] You want to come out in front of that with a title that might be Dune?

[16:24] Dead on Arrival!

[16:26] Dead on Arrival!

[16:27] And I know they listen.

[16:29] I know Brian's a member.

[16:31] David's a member.

[16:32] Blake, you guys, what were you thinking?

[16:35] I was trying to help you guys.

[16:37] You needed to get out in front of all of this, all of it.

[16:41] And you didn't.

[16:42] And now you're launching 52 weeks in a year

[16:46] and you're launching the one week where the best designer

[16:49] and all of Pimbal is dropping its game.

[16:51] Stupid.

[16:53] Stupid.

[16:53] You don't want to be in that position.

[16:56] It's like you made decisions in a vacuum.

[16:59] And look, I think you got forced to go on that Tuesday.

[17:02] I bet David wasn't even ready to go.

[17:04] I think this was a pivot.

[17:05] Like they knew Kong was going to be on Thursday

[17:08] and then he had to make a decision.

[17:10] He's like, we're going to get our asses kicked either way.

[17:13] We're either going to get our ass kicked by Kong

[17:15] or our ass kicked by Harry Potter.

[17:18] And if you have to choose between the two,

[17:20] you might as well choose King Kong

[17:22] because it's not nearly as big of a theme as Harry Potter.

[17:25] So like, I get it, you know, I get it.

[17:28] But is the barrel going to go overboard on this one?

[17:31] But boy, man, barrels, you're in a bad position.

[17:34] You're in a bad position.

[17:35] And again, you waited too long.

[17:37] You should have gone out a month ago.

[17:39] You knew these games were coming.

[17:41] You have friends in the industry

[17:43] and you waited to prove a point

[17:45] that we're going to be a company

[17:46] that doesn't reveal games until they're on the line

[17:49] and inboxes, guess what?

[17:51] As I said before, nobody cares.

[17:53] So you waited and now you're going to make

[17:55] the biggest marketing mistake

[17:57] and I think you're going to get hammered on sales.

[17:59] Now the only way out, and maybe they know this,

[18:02] this is the only way out.

[18:04] This is why I'm so excited to see this game.

[18:06] The only way out of this quagmire

[18:09] and this problem for them is if this game is epic,

[18:14] is if this game is insane,

[18:17] is if they know they've got something that is just awesome.

[18:22] That is the only way out.

[18:24] If it's not that,

[18:25] if it's anything short of that masterpiece,

[18:28] they're going to be DOA.

[18:31] Everybody, it's nuts, trust me.

[18:34] Let's have fun watching all of this.

[18:36] Keep your money in your pockets right now.

[18:40] All of these games are going to sink in value so much.

[18:43] And look, this hobby, if everything keeps going the way

[18:46] it's going right now in the world,

[18:48] nobody's going to be rushing to buy pinball machines.

[18:51] You're not going to be buying toys

[18:54] in a time in which you need to take care

[18:55] of your real priorities.

[18:57] And the only thing that's not going to go up in value,

[19:00] there's not going to be any tariffs

[19:02] on Canada's Pinball Podcast, baby.

[19:04] Made in America, made in Connecticut.

[19:07] I don't know, maybe this might come from China,

[19:10] but you're never going to have to pay more.

[19:12] That's just the way it is.

[19:13] Trust me, I get notifications from Patreon.

[19:16] They want me to charge more money for new subscribers.

[19:20] I still won't do it.

[19:22] $5 a month, that's the entry fee

[19:25] for the greatest pinball podcast on Mars.

[19:28] Later.

[19:29] Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?

[19:32] Who do you, who do you think you are?

[19:33] Ha ha ha, bless your soul.

[19:38] You really play your own control.

[19:42] Well, I think you're crazy.

[19:47] I think you're crazy.

[19:52] I think you're crazy.

[19:56] Just like me.
