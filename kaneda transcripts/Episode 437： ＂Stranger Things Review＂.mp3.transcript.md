[00:00] Happy Happy New Year's Everybody!

[00:14] This is Canadian from Canadian Spinball Podcast episode 400 and 37 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:21] I'm super excited to talk to you on this episode because I'm going to give you my review.

[00:27] One man's opinion, this is not the law, this is not facts.

[00:32] These are 100% my opinions about Stranger Things Pimball.

[00:37] Now I was lucky enough to be invited over to Jack Bar in New York City and play their

[00:43] game.

[00:44] John invited me down there.

[00:45] I played it for two hours straight today.

[00:48] Two hours uninterrupted before Jack Bar even opened up.

[00:52] The volume was cranking.

[00:54] The game was set up perfectly.

[00:56] I'm going to talk about that.

[00:58] I was able to hit Demogorgon shots.

[01:00] I was able to hit everything that's in the game.

[01:03] I didn't have any issues with the way the game shot.

[01:06] I could hear the game.

[01:07] I could hear the game because the night before that I went to sunshine in Brooklyn and when

[01:11] that 4k is going, you cannot.

[01:15] You cannot hop on a Pimball machine on location when it's loud and get a sense of what the

[01:22] game is going to be like other than the shot geometry.

[01:26] So super excited to share my thoughts about Stranger Things with you on this episode of

[01:30] Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[01:32] And I don't know about you, but I've had a great holiday season.

[01:36] It's been great.

[01:37] We've had family over.

[01:38] We've traveled to visit family.

[01:41] We've watched Bubba, beg for food, nonstop.

[01:44] And the holidays are a time in which we should all be happy and thankful for all that we

[01:49] have in this world.

[01:51] I don't know about you, but if you've been on Pinside the last couple of weeks, it

[01:55] has been the most toxic place.

[01:58] The biggest dumpster fire lately where everyone's just bickering and arguing and personally

[02:05] insulting each other back and forth because we're talking about Pimball.

[02:10] And before I give you my Stranger Things opinions, I just want to say, can we all collectively

[02:16] in 2020 when we're sharing what we think about these non-essential grown up toys?

[02:23] Just treat each other with a little bit more respect and understand the context of the stupid

[02:28] thing you're arguing about.

[02:30] There's no right or wrong with most of this stuff.

[02:34] Almost all Pimball out there is F-U-N-FUN.

[02:39] It's a toy.

[02:40] Once a game meant for five minutes, get that five minutes of enjoyment at a time.

[02:46] It was never meant to fix your marriage.

[02:49] It was never meant to make you get over your in-laws.

[02:52] It was never meant to be the most important thing in your life.

[02:55] It was never meant to be the thing that you travel the world to seek out.

[02:59] It's just a freaking game.

[03:01] And I read people talking to each other and it's like, my God, and I get it.

[03:05] I get it because during the holidays, a lot of people have off from work.

[03:10] And they're not doing their normal routine.

[03:12] And so, Pinside becomes this place in which people spend a lot of their time in an inordinate

[03:18] amount of time during the holidays.

[03:21] And it's amazing how negative people are, especially when what we're doing is debating

[03:26] brand new games that are coming out.

[03:29] Brand new games.

[03:30] It's 2020 and we have a ton of Pimball options available today.

[03:36] We have a ton of Pimball options about to be available on the horizon.

[03:42] And here's the good news for all of you grown men out there who constantly whine and

[03:49] moan on Pinside.

[03:51] Nobody is making you buy any of these Pimball machines.

[03:56] None of these manufacturers made these games to personally offend you.

[04:01] I know that you have a megaphone.

[04:03] I know you feel really important because your pinball thing that your opinion, it's not

[04:09] just that you have an opinion.

[04:10] It's that you, your dire need to prove other people wrong every single moment of every

[04:15] single day.

[04:16] My God, it gets old.

[04:17] It's more healthy to just listen to Pimball podcasts.

[04:20] And speaking of, did you hear Scott Denise's interview on Slapsafe Pimball?

[04:25] Absolutely incredible.

[04:27] If you do anything, listen to that interview, listen to Scott Denise.

[04:31] He talk about Rick and Morty and get excited for his game because I love hearing from the

[04:36] young talent in this hobby.

[04:39] And I love it when Scott says, Hey, did you feel pressure when the game sold out to deliver

[04:45] a great game?

[04:46] And he's like, absolutely, I feel tremendous pressure to make this game as good as I can

[04:50] make it.

[04:51] I love it.

[04:52] We need more of that young energy and enthusiasm in the hobby.

[04:57] All right.

[04:58] So guys out there complaining about your Rick and Morty spots and about stranger things.

[05:01] Do me a favor.

[05:02] Do me a favor.

[05:03] Just be happy you're getting a Rick and Morty if you are and just be happy that stranger

[05:09] things is available for you to buy or not buy.

[05:11] Okay.

[05:12] Let's talk about the game.

[05:14] Let's talk about stranger things.

[05:15] So two hours on this machine.

[05:17] And I'll say this, it's really hard to review a game that's not finished.

[05:23] And that always is a huge caveat when you play a game this early on.

[05:28] And it's still very early on in this game.

[05:31] I can see where they're going with it though.

[05:33] I can see where they're going to take it.

[05:35] And there's some good.

[05:36] There's some bad.

[05:37] There's some ugly.

[05:39] There's things I loved.

[05:40] There's things I didn't love.

[05:42] And what I want to do on this episode is I just want to give you one man's opinion about

[05:46] stranger things, the pro edition of the game on .75 code.

[05:52] Okay.

[05:53] Now I'm just going to go a little bit all over the place on things I like, things I didn't

[05:56] like.

[05:57] I'm not going to go down a laundry list.

[05:58] I'm not going to score things with numbers that don't matter.

[06:02] I'm not going to give the game a B to B minus and tell you to go buy it.

[06:06] I'm going to just share with you.

[06:08] Canate is two hour feelings on stranger things.

[06:11] Okay.

[06:12] So just remember that as we go down this journey.

[06:15] The first and foremost, I don't know where to start.

[06:18] I don't know where to start.

[06:19] Let's just start with when you first walk up to the game and you first look down and

[06:24] you stare at the game.

[06:25] The first thing that goes through my head when I looked at the game was it's another

[06:31] stern machine.

[06:32] And what do I mean by that?

[06:33] It's another stern machine.

[06:34] Well, I get that stern made this machine, but there's just a sense.

[06:39] And again, maybe it's because this game was right next to Willy Wonka and I played El

[06:44] Vira.

[06:45] I played Jurassic Park.

[06:46] I've been playing a bunch of sterns lately and I also played Whitewater and Medieval

[06:51] Madness and I played Theater of Magic and Totten.

[06:55] You know, I played all of these games over the last 48 hours.

[06:58] When you walk up to a modern stern, you know, I just can't help but feel that there's

[07:02] a level.

[07:03] I think the word is it just feels a little cheap.

[07:07] It just looks a little cheap and it looks a little bit like it should cost.

[07:14] You know, I'm going to just say these games just look like they're not worth what the

[07:19] asking prices for these games anymore.

[07:22] They're just starting to look really cheap and there's not a lot to look at.

[07:27] And that's the thing is like when you look down at it, there's, you know, the big center

[07:31] thing that's covered by the laboratory, but then there's nothing else.

[07:36] There's nothing that will jump out at you in this game.

[07:39] Okay, but I get over that pretty quickly because I think almost all sterns nowadays,

[07:43] all modern sterns look somewhat cheap.

[07:45] They've done a good job masking that with the artwork and with other elements of like,

[07:50] you know, whether it's like Ellie, Armour and whatnot or Toppers, but for the most part,

[07:54] these games don't, you don't stand over a stern and just, you know, it just doesn't

[07:58] ooze like high end premium pimple.

[08:01] But again, this is the pro edition of the game.

[08:03] Now the thing that's interesting is the premium and Ellie is not going to look much better

[08:07] in this game because not, not, not much is going to be added to this game at all.

[08:13] In fact, stuff will be taken away without the projector being on.

[08:17] We're going to talk about that.

[08:18] You're going to get actually probably less to look at until that thing is turned on.

[08:23] And so this is not going to be a game in which you see a very big visual difference

[08:28] in terms of wow, there's a lot more in the premium and Ellie.

[08:32] It's not going to have like the upper play field or the lower play field.

[08:36] There's something that really jumps out as being significantly different as you upgrade

[08:41] models in this game.

[08:42] And I'm going to say this at the end of this show, but I kind of feel like the pro is

[08:46] the way to go on stranger things and I'm going to explain why as I get to the end.

[08:50] So as you all know, it's a fan layout.

[08:52] And I now know what a fan layout is and I'll say this, the game shoots great.

[08:58] The game shoots phenomenally well.

[09:02] And what I like about this game and even though it's a fan layout, I like the fact that

[09:08] every shot in the game is very makeable.

[09:12] There is nothing that you want to shoot at in stranger things that is too difficult to

[09:18] hit.

[09:19] There's nothing that's clunky.

[09:21] There's nothing unsatisfying because it's like you can't quite get there.

[09:27] This game shoots buttery smooth.

[09:30] And it's fast and it's got flow.

[09:33] And man, when you're nailing those ramps back and forth, when you're nailing that right,

[09:37] sorry, the left orbit just loops and right to keep nailing it and nailing it and it's

[09:41] great.

[09:42] I love an orbit shot that is not too tight.

[09:46] It is so frustrating to me when you have shots that are designed to create speed and

[09:52] flow, but you make the entrance to those shots way too difficult.

[09:58] And so there's nothing more rewarding than having orbit shots you can hit.

[10:02] And we've all played games, especially newer games in which that's not been the case.

[10:08] And there's a lot of clunkiness in the design.

[10:10] So kudos to Brian Eddie for designing a game in which it's fast.

[10:15] It has great flow because when you put those two things together, speed and flow, it makes

[10:21] shooting the game a lot of fun because you feel like you're accomplishing the shots and

[10:27] the game without feeling like the game is unfairly treating you as the player.

[10:33] Okay?

[10:34] So for shots in this game, I think it shoots great.

[10:38] So moving on from there, let's talk about the demigorgan toy in the middle because there's

[10:44] been a lot of back and forth about is this thing stupid?

[10:48] Does it work well?

[10:49] Does it not work well?

[10:51] Can you hit it?

[10:52] Can you get the ball inside the mouth?

[10:54] How does it look?

[10:55] Because that real estate looks silly in the game that it's like pushed forward so much?

[11:00] Let me start out by saying it's a tale of two demigorgans because I played two stranger

[11:05] thing pro machines.

[11:07] I played one at Sunshine, Laundromat.

[11:10] I believe it was set up too steep.

[11:12] And on their game, and this was all day long last night at Sunshine, on their game, I never

[11:20] got the ball inside the mouth of the demigorgan.

[11:23] And the ball kept ricocheting off the demigorgan and hitting the glass.

[11:29] And everyone I saw play the game at Sunshine was whacking the ball off the glass and not

[11:34] having any success.

[11:36] At Jack Bar today, a different game, different setup, set up not as steep, I hit the demigorgan

[11:43] shot in the middle, probably about 70% of the time.

[11:49] Which is great.

[11:50] I mean, it was not hard.

[11:52] I hit it like 10 times in a row, then I missed it a bunch of times.

[11:56] It gets harder to hit it when you have a multi ball going.

[11:59] Now look, this center ramp, when it comes down, it's not the most aesthetically pleasing

[12:05] thing.

[12:06] I also think the toy itself, when you start to battle it, there's just something that's

[12:12] just, it's just doesn't give you the same level of excitement and doesn't feel as like,

[12:19] magical as when you're battling the UFO and attack from Mars.

[12:23] It's just, there's something about it.

[12:25] It's just, it's fine.

[12:28] But you know, once you shoot it into the mouth, then it's over.

[12:31] Like, you kill it and then you're back playing the game.

[12:34] It sort of feels just like a side mission or a side objective in this game is to battle

[12:40] the demigorgan's.

[12:42] But then it's like, why did they give that toy?

[12:46] They could have put somewhere else in the game, to be honest.

[12:49] Why did they make that toy so front and center?

[12:52] And I think the answer lies in what they wanted to do with the projector gimmick, which

[12:56] we're going to talk about, when you're playing the game, I actually had a lot more fun trying

[13:01] to start the different modes from the show.

[13:04] And you, you accomplish that by shooting the different shots on the orbits and on the ramps.

[13:09] And I think you shoot them two or three times and that qualifies a mode and you start a

[13:14] mode.

[13:15] And that's where the real fun of this game is is when you start the modes because then

[13:20] you are in the world of stranger things and you are part of a stranger things moment that

[13:27] you remember.

[13:28] And you have to be a fan of the show or you won't really know what any of those scenes

[13:33] or moments are because that's one of the big issues I had with this game.

[13:39] One of the, if I were to say the big issue I had with stranger things, pinball, after

[13:43] playing it today is I really just don't understand what I'm doing in the game.

[13:49] And here's what I mean by that.

[13:51] As the player of the game, I don't even know who I am.

[13:56] The game itself has no real introduction.

[13:59] You hit the start button, you get the Christmas light image up on the screen and there's

[14:04] zero call outs.

[14:06] There's nothing.

[14:07] There's nothing to tell you.

[14:09] Like welcome to Hawkins.

[14:10] Like hey, let's go find the kids to go save will.

[14:15] There's absolutely no guidance or there's no beginning of a journey that's communicated

[14:21] in this game at all.

[14:23] And I know that that might come later on in the code, but I find it hard to believe that

[14:28] something that's not coded from the very beginning of this game is just some guidance for

[14:35] the player on what they're supposed to be doing.

[14:39] I mean, it makes no sense to me that as the player, you should be confused about who

[14:45] you are in the stranger things universe.

[14:48] And what your mission is to do, you know, it doesn't spell out clearly like are you trying

[14:54] to collect all the kids to go save will?

[14:57] Are you, you know what I'm saying?

[14:59] There's just absolutely, are you, are you hopper?

[15:02] Are you the cop and you got, you have to like try and help them like figure out a way

[15:06] to like defeat the evil Demogorgans.

[15:09] It's really confusing to me why games are coded this way.

[15:14] And I do think that if I had one big gripe, it's like when you play this game, it just

[15:20] feels, it reminds me a little bit of Wanka in the sense that all these different clips

[15:27] and modes are in there, but there's just no cohesiveness to it.

[15:32] And maybe that's going to come and maybe that's not.

[15:34] And maybe, you know, tournament players don't care about that when they say how great

[15:38] the game is, but as a home buyer, I would want more from the code way more than is currently

[15:46] in the game right now.

[15:47] Is that too much to ask?

[15:49] You know, it is that too much to ask that you just want to feel more connected to the

[15:55] property and the franchise.

[15:57] And that's the job of the coder in my mind is to figure out a way in which they're going

[16:04] to assemble all of the things and all of the different scenes and modes from the show

[16:10] in a way that makes sense.

[16:13] And right now when I see what Lonnie's doing with this game, it just feels a little chaotic.

[16:20] It feels like it's like a little bit all over the place.

[16:23] You've got HD clips from the show.

[16:26] Then you've got these like Miami Vice sort of highly stylized, you know, 1980s retro animations

[16:33] come up for like when you lock a ball in this and that, then you got Demogorgon animations

[16:39] that all look different.

[16:41] So you've got all these different styles going on and it just doesn't, I don't know, it

[16:47] just feels like all over the place.

[16:50] And I think what they needed to figure out and I'm not sure how they're going to do this

[16:55] is a way to pull you through the stranger things journey in a way that's just much more

[17:00] connected.

[17:01] And I don't know, there's just too much going on while there's not a lot going on.

[17:06] If that makes sense because it's all over the place.

[17:08] Like I just, like I'll give you an example.

[17:11] When I know I use Batman a lot, but I just love the way that Lyman Sheets had like the

[17:16] Batman, the old school TV screen and that's where everything took place.

[17:22] And then you had enough information on that.

[17:25] It's like, it's like your home screen.

[17:27] It's like you need a home screen in pinball in which it sort of communicates to you

[17:32] where to look and what you're doing.

[17:34] And I don't think this game has that.

[17:37] Like it really doesn't.

[17:38] And I think there's like, there's a disconnect between like all these inserts, which I'm not

[17:44] even sure all of them are necessary.

[17:46] And maybe they could have put all of that up on the screen more and had like your progress

[17:52] being built a little bit more on the screen.

[17:55] And a little bit less with like a gazillion inserts as just like the home base to pull

[18:00] you through.

[18:01] And maybe that's confusing.

[18:03] And maybe I should sound a little confused because to me, the game is just a little bit

[18:08] confusing about what exactly it is that we're trying to do in this game.

[18:14] And I've read the rule card and everything like that.

[18:17] But I just think it's like, it's all over the place in terms of the way the code is

[18:21] stitched together.

[18:22] So that's, that's work to be done.

[18:25] The sound in this game is incredible.

[18:28] I mean, the first thing you'll notice more than the artwork will talk about that.

[18:32] But when you hear that stranger things sound and the Stern speaker system in this game

[18:37] is incredible, the game just sounds awesome.

[18:40] Like it pulls you in to the stranger things world immediately.

[18:44] And the sound effects when you hit switches and spinners and drop targets are awesome.

[18:50] They're super awesome.

[18:52] I mean, I think if I could say the thing that I love the most about this game, the two

[18:56] things I love the most, I loved how fast the game was.

[19:00] I love the flow of the game.

[19:02] And I love the sound of the game.

[19:04] I mean, it just, it, it just is like awesome to hear the sound effects of this game.

[19:11] Now the call outs are horrible.

[19:13] Like, I don't know what Stern is doing with call outs these days.

[19:17] Like do they just give the actors like a sheet of paper and have them call up and just

[19:23] read a bunch of words like jackpot jackpot.

[19:27] Oh, you get your ball back jackpot.

[19:29] Super jackpot.

[19:31] There's absolutely no animation in their voices.

[19:36] It's so sad to me when they get these actors who are capable of incredible acting.

[19:42] And then they ask them to do call outs for a pinball machine.

[19:46] And there's no acting involved in their call outs.

[19:50] It's like they're just mailing it in or phoning it in.

[19:53] And I was really disappointed by just like how bad the call outs are right now in the

[19:57] game.

[19:58] Now, I did love the fact that there are clips from the show with voices synced up.

[20:05] I mean, it's great.

[20:06] I mean, we were all worried we were not going to get those assets in this game.

[20:11] And we've been, you know, we've seen games like Willy Wonka completely flood that.

[20:15] And it was great to see that stranger things has permission to use all of the assets that

[20:22] we would want, right?

[20:23] They have all the kids voices.

[20:25] They have them synced up with the clips from the show.

[20:28] So that's awesome.

[20:30] It adds to the connection to the IP when you play this game.

[20:34] It just does like I think when you start multi ball when 11, you know, sends the Hawkins

[20:39] van flying over them, that's just it's awesome.

[20:43] It's awesome how that all connects.

[20:45] And you need it because in a lot of these modes, the voices from the kids, they tell you

[20:50] what, what mode you're about to go on and it just helps set the stage for the mode you're

[20:56] about to play.

[20:57] Now, I also love like the music in the different modes when you get into them.

[21:01] I mean, this is a mode based game.

[21:03] I mean, as much as I've always said, like you need to make mode based pinball, this is

[21:07] a mode based pinball game.

[21:09] And you're going to, you're going to see a lot of different musical tracks going when

[21:14] you start those different modes.

[21:16] But here's, here's the, and this is like part of my issue with the game.

[21:21] You start these different modes, but you're really just going to be shooting the same shots

[21:26] over and over and over again.

[21:27] I know, I know you could say that for all of pinball, but, but there's just nothing physical

[21:32] in this game that connects to any of the modes at all other than the demigorgan mode.

[21:42] There's not one area of the play field that has anything physically going on that makes

[21:49] any sense with the mode you're playing.

[21:51] So then the entire game becomes just hitting switches to see clips from the show.

[21:59] And that's it.

[22:00] Like there's, there's nothing physically going on that brings any of the show to life other

[22:06] than that center mechanism.

[22:08] I know we're going to get telekinesis multi ball, but that's not going to be a huge thing

[22:12] in the game.

[22:13] And so it just, you know, as I was playing the game more and more and more, I kind of just

[22:18] got a little bit, I don't know how do I say this like it just got a little boring.

[22:24] And I don't mean like I was maybe just I was playing two hours straight.

[22:28] I mean, keep that in mind.

[22:29] But I guess what I'm saying is like you just keep doing the same stuff, but you never really

[22:33] see the ball do anything magical and you never are like activating areas of the play field

[22:42] or activating mechanisms at all.

[22:44] Like there's just like nothing else to really do.

[22:47] If you like a game, I'll say this if you like just flow and you like speed, you might

[22:53] like this.

[22:54] It's like people who like Game of Thrones pro.

[22:55] I think you're going to love this game.

[22:57] If that's what you like in Pimble and you like speed and you like combos and you like

[23:03] you know, the ball staying in motion and you don't like slowing down and having the ball

[23:08] interact with a lot of mechanisms, then this is the game for you.

[23:12] And that's okay.

[23:14] Now if you're a person who likes a lot of toys and likes to see the ball interacting

[23:18] with a lot of stuff, this is not going to be a game that gives you a lot and no more

[23:23] is really going to come because the ball is not really interacting with the projector stuff.

[23:28] That's not no.

[23:29] Nothing physical is going to happen there.

[23:31] Another thing I did and you should do this, if you stand over a stranger things game,

[23:37] stand next to it and look at the game and look how much real estate is underutilized in

[23:44] this game.

[23:45] I mean, basically you know where the Demagorgon screen is, the Hawkins lab image, anything

[23:51] behind that.

[23:53] There is almost nothing happening in this game behind that screen.

[23:58] You've got two pop bumpers you can't even see, so it's not rewarding at all.

[24:03] Like when the balls are on the pops, you can't even see it.

[24:05] So it's like, oh, okay.

[24:07] And then to the left, the upper left of this game is just barren.

[24:12] There's nothing there other than the ramp which is lifted above the play field.

[24:18] But man, Stern really has a lot of blank real estate in this game that you know could have

[24:25] been used to put more in the game.

[24:28] I just get this feeling that Eddie just made the best with the amount of money they gave

[24:34] him.

[24:35] But when I look at the play field, I've never seen a game that literally has so much

[24:42] empty area in the upper parts of the game in which normally there's stuff there we're

[24:47] shooting at.

[24:48] And probably the weirdest mech in this game or the weirdest feature in this game.

[24:53] And this feels to me like the prime example of something that just came as a result of

[24:59] him running out of money or Stern not giving him enough is on the far left midway up the

[25:05] play field is a vertical up kick.

[25:08] It's a little, you know, it's a little, the ball goes in like a little drop area and

[25:14] it kicks it out towards the demigorgon targets, right?

[25:18] You know, we've seen this before in other games, but to me that shot is just so unrewarding.

[25:25] It's such a, because it's not satisfying because it feels like there should have been

[25:30] something there in which the player could have controlled something that moves back and

[25:34] forth and then you fire the ball towards those targets.

[25:38] You know, all of the cannon and ACDC would you actually get to control your shot or the

[25:42] crossbow and the walking dead?

[25:45] You know, this to me is so indicative of modern day Stern and them yanking stuff at a games

[25:52] and then you just have elements that absolutely make no sense.

[25:56] Like let's just think about that for a minute.

[25:58] What is that up kick?

[25:59] What does that do in Stranger Things that reflects anything that's going on in the game itself

[26:04] or the property itself?

[26:06] What about the Stranger Things universe made them just put that thing there, right?

[26:11] It's pointless.

[26:13] It has nothing to do with Stranger Things.

[26:15] It's simply they had to put something there.

[26:18] It adds a little bit of random niffs and chaos to the gameplay because you're firing towards

[26:23] the targets, but there's nothing there.

[26:26] It's just not interesting that they used real estate to put that in the game.

[26:31] And that's just my biggest thing with this entire game is it seems like this entire game

[26:37] is going to live or die for a lot of people on whether or not the projector delivers something

[26:44] unique to this gameplay experience because that's the big toy.

[26:48] I mean, the big toy is not the demigorian.

[26:51] The big toy, the big toy is the projector, right?

[26:56] That's the hyperloop of this game.

[26:59] That's the one that's not going to be that's the moving T-Rex, right?

[27:02] I mean, think about it.

[27:04] Whenever Stern wants to upsell you on the big difference between a pro and a premium,

[27:09] it's usually the big toy, Mac, upper playfield, lower playfield, something of significant

[27:14] cost.

[27:15] An engineering enhancement to the game is how they say that this is the feature.

[27:23] So what's the engineering enhancement to Stranger Things?

[27:26] It's the projector.

[27:28] It's the projector and it's the telekinesis multi-ball in the upper left corner.

[27:32] I'm telling you right now, after playing this game for two hours, that telekinesis magnetic

[27:38] grab in the upper left corner of this game is going to be very underwhelming because

[27:44] you'll see it.

[27:45] When you play this game, it's just like all the way back there in the upper left.

[27:48] It's not going to be something that really wowes people.

[27:51] So then all of this game to me hinges on this projector.

[27:56] And I've talked to people who have played the projector version of the game.

[28:01] And they're not coming out yet and they're not delivering what they know is true, that

[28:07] it just doesn't work that well.

[28:10] And it looks really bad in a room with lighting.

[28:13] And they just, I don't know why people are holding that back, but everyone's going to find

[28:18] out sooner or later that this is the truth, that there's a reason why Stern is stalling

[28:24] on showing us the projector version of the game.

[28:28] And my little thing is this.

[28:29] I actually think it's funny.

[28:31] I think for once the Stern Pro is just going to be the unanimous way to go.

[28:36] I think you're going to be able to have all of the fun you want to have with Stranger Things.

[28:41] If you love Stranger Things, I think you just grab a pro and enjoy it.

[28:46] I mean, this game did have me going back one more ball, one more ball.

[28:50] I want to go through the game.

[28:51] I was a little frustrated with the outlaying drains on this game.

[28:55] This game comes from the factory.

[28:57] Maybe this is for operators.

[28:59] It comes from the factory with both of the outlaying posts all the way up.

[29:04] And I'm saying when that ball gets into those slings, there's a lot of cheap drains in

[29:09] the out lanes in this game, the way it's set up from the factory.

[29:11] I mean, the ball was just flying out from slings right to the out lanes and a lot of times

[29:16] too, just unsavable.

[29:18] And I know I'm not the best player in the world, but just a lot of cheap drains in the out

[29:21] lanes.

[29:22] And then on the left out lane drain, there's a virtual ball save.

[29:27] This is to me again, like Stern is just so cheap, they can't put the freaking physical

[29:34] like ball save in the out lane.

[29:36] There's so not rewarding to see the ball saved.

[29:41] And then you have to wait for it to plunge out of the right side.

[29:43] Like this is the stuff that I wish we could start demanding.

[29:47] They put back into the game.

[29:49] It's just so much more fun when there's a physical ball save on the left out lane.

[29:55] Stern, can you hear me?

[29:56] What is it?

[29:57] $10 more game to put that in there?

[30:01] My God.

[30:02] All right.

[30:03] So that's the thing.

[30:04] I mean, I think this whole game is going to be a game in which some people love it.

[30:09] Some people hate it.

[30:11] Some people are going to think it brings the stranger things world to life.

[30:17] Other people are going to think it's a little bit of a chaotic mess.

[30:21] We haven't talked about the artwork.

[30:23] Now I was just saving the artwork to the end because I don't think I've seen a recent

[30:28] Stern Pimball machine in which the art package just didn't do anything for me.

[30:33] It's not great.

[30:34] It's not.

[30:35] It's not horrible.

[30:37] It's just not great.

[30:38] It's just it's really average.

[30:41] And considering the source material, and if you were to Google image source, stranger

[30:45] things, there's so much awesome stranger things artwork out there.

[30:49] There's so much awesome stranger things artwork that's out there that Netflix has

[30:53] created.

[30:54] And when I look at this art package, it just doesn't work well for Pimball.

[30:58] It's very like watered down and muted.

[31:01] That is something that when you put it next to all of the recent Stern machines, it just

[31:08] doesn't pop.

[31:10] It doesn't look great.

[31:12] And I know there's been debate with like Christopher Franchi and how he would have done

[31:15] it.

[31:16] And I get he does a similar thing where you know if you're drawing or illustrating over

[31:21] images that are given to you by the property, yeah, but his stuff pops.

[31:26] His stuff is outlined better.

[31:28] It has better definition.

[31:30] This stuff just feels soft.

[31:33] And I just don't think it looks great.

[31:35] And I don't think any of the cabinet artwork looks great on any of the models.

[31:41] It was the first time I ever in a game, but maybe this is a good thing.

[31:45] You know, maybe we've become so hyper focused on art, but no, I mean, I just think they could

[31:48] have done a far cooler job on the art package on this game.

[31:53] The Playfield artwork, it's all right.

[31:56] It's all right.

[31:57] It's not as bad as some people are making it out to be.

[31:59] The game is just filled with inserts.

[32:02] I mean, there's you don't really appreciate the artwork on this.

[32:06] Like if you go play a Deadpool and then go play a stranger things, you'll be like they

[32:11] forgot to put the artwork into stranger things.

[32:14] It's just not that same level of like where the artwork and the inserts are working together

[32:20] to make one beautiful canvas.

[32:22] It just feels like all this stuff is dropped down on this Playfield.

[32:29] There are a lot of inserts.

[32:31] Some of them are so damn small, you can't even read what's on the insert.

[32:35] And I think that's also something they need to think about.

[32:37] If you don't have great eyesight, you're not going to be able to read what's on those

[32:41] little, they're like these little diamond shaped inserts.

[32:44] So anything else that I want to talk about, I'm just looking at my notes, the lockdown

[32:49] bar currently in Code.75 does nothing.

[32:53] Like does nothing, it never flashes, it's not coded to do anything.

[32:58] And it's funny to me that every single Stern game now has to have a lockdown bar button.

[33:04] You know why?

[33:05] Again, this is again, Stern being cheap people because they only want to order one type

[33:10] of lockdown bar that has a hole in the middle of it to put a button there.

[33:14] And regardless of having a button there makes sense or not for the game or the property,

[33:20] you are now going to get a button in the middle of every single Stern lockdown bar.

[33:25] And isn't it somewhat embarrassing that they ship a game with that on it?

[33:30] And there's no decal there saying what the button is for.

[33:35] There's no, it's not coded into anything right now.

[33:38] It's just sitting there like a dead limb waiting for them to do something with it.

[33:44] Because see, to me, like this seems like a little thing, but it's really not.

[33:49] I think it's indicative of one of the big issues happening over at Stern is like they're

[33:53] forcing their designers and their coders to just, you just, you have to work with this

[34:00] stuff.

[34:01] Regardless if it makes sense, regardless if you want it in your game, this is what you

[34:05] have to do.

[34:06] You have to have a lockdown bar button.

[34:08] Now you got to figure out what something to code into it.

[34:11] And I'm sure it makes it harder for some of these designers and coders to have to always

[34:16] inherit the decisions that are just made by the cheap bean counters who are just trying

[34:22] to maximize profit.

[34:25] And that is like when I walk away from all these Stern machines, right, it's like a miracle

[34:30] to me that like Jurassic Park has what it has in it.

[34:34] But I just get this overwhelming feeling that it's just being counters are making the

[34:39] decisions and the designers, the designers must be so frustrated that this isn't really

[34:47] what they wanted it to be, but it's all they could afford to give us.

[34:52] That doesn't mean like it's, you know, they're not creating some fun games because they

[34:56] are, right, they are.

[34:58] But this game to me looks like the result of a lot of cost cutting.

[35:04] It also looks like a game that invested heavily on a gimmick that if it doesn't work out

[35:12] is going to quickly quickly make this game a real miss for Stern Pimball in the long run.

[35:20] And by miss, I mean that it just won't be a game that people to consider to be one of

[35:26] the better Stern releases and Stern releases, you know, great games, mediocre games and

[35:32] some crappy games for the most part they're all pretty decent, but it's strange your

[35:37] things.

[35:38] And I was saying this to a friend the other day, if there's one thing that Stern excels

[35:43] at and it's like taking the biggest themes that are out there and the games they make

[35:50] aren't the best games they make are never based around the biggest properties.

[35:55] It's like they always find a way to somewhat kill our dreams a little bit and I'm talking

[36:00] themes like Ghostbusters, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy, right?

[36:10] Stranger Things, Five Juggernaut themes.

[36:15] And I would argue that those games were just big misses in terms of being the best we

[36:23] know Stern can do and somewhere in the process of making these games and maybe it's just

[36:29] the way they shuffle designers with coders, but I don't know what it is.

[36:34] I don't know what it is, but Stranger Things is one of the biggest properties in the world

[36:39] and I just don't think this is going to go down as one of the best Pimball machines from

[36:45] Stern recently and I don't think it's going to go down as anything memorable a year from

[36:51] now.

[36:52] It's going to go down as a Brian Eddie game that is fast and fun.

[36:57] It's going to make you want to hit start over and over again because it's Stranger Things,

[37:02] it will.

[37:03] It's Stranger Things.

[37:04] Like if you love Stranger Things, I think you're going to enjoy this game.

[37:08] But again, I think all you need is the pro.

[37:11] I think the projector is going to prove to be the Achilles heel of the premium versions

[37:18] of this game.

[37:20] And if I were you, if I were you, currently as it stands and this is someone who's just

[37:25] played this game for hours, right?

[37:29] And thank God John over at Jack Bar.

[37:32] He let me play it for free.

[37:33] So I have no money invested in this.

[37:36] I'm telling you this out of all the games I've ever reviewed and I've ever played on

[37:41] Canada's Pimball podcast.

[37:43] This is the one game in which you have to wait to see this projector work in real life.

[37:48] And if you have money in on an L.E. or a premium without seeing this gimmick, I'm telling

[37:54] you that's a foolish thing.

[37:56] You don't know how it's going to be.

[38:00] Nobody can assume the way this projector is going to function in the real world because

[38:05] we've never had anyone attempt this kind of gimmick in a Pimball machine.

[38:10] You know journalism is dead.

[38:12] Journalism is dead.

[38:13] Why did Gizmodo?

[38:15] I was thinking about this.

[38:16] Why did Gizmodo say that this was the most technologically innovative Pimball machine

[38:21] of all time, right?

[38:22] The major media outlet says that.

[38:24] Did Gizmodo play it?

[38:26] Do they even see it?

[38:28] The answer is no.

[38:30] This is all just take our word for it kind of technology right now.

[38:35] It might work.

[38:37] It might not.

[38:38] But Stern Pimball, where is it?

[38:41] Show it.

[38:42] They have it.

[38:43] It's at Stern Pimball right now.

[38:46] Jack Danger said he saw it in the room.

[38:49] People who are there have seen it.

[38:50] I know people who have played it, who have other Pimball podcasts.

[38:55] And yet where is it?

[38:56] And so to me it's like until you see it, I think you're crazy to just go all in on this

[39:04] LE.

[39:05] That's my that's my two cents.

[39:08] That's my two cents.

[39:09] This isn't like a lower play field on the monsters that you know this isn't a T-Rex

[39:14] that moves back and forth.

[39:16] This is the you know, remember the images that are on the LCD in the pro those images are

[39:23] going to be projected onto that screen.

[39:28] So ostensibly the back LCD that becomes what projected and then just the score is on

[39:34] the back screen.

[39:35] So if that doesn't work well, it could be a much worse experience than the pro version

[39:42] of the game.

[39:43] And I can't wait to see it though.

[39:45] I just want to play it.

[39:46] I just want to see it.

[39:47] I want to see if it works or not.

[39:48] I want Stern to invite people inside their factory.

[39:52] And I think they should show it working before they take people's money on the LE's.

[39:58] But you're not going to hear that from distributors.

[40:00] They want to sell out everyone.

[40:02] And I'll say this the level of people I've talked to the number of people I know and

[40:07] it's a lot of people.

[40:10] I know a lot of people who are in on an LE who just said give me it without seeing it function.

[40:18] And that's the state of modern pinball to put a bow on this year on 2019 to put a bow

[40:25] on 2020.

[40:26] The way people buy games now, the games are unfinished.

[40:31] They haven't seen the damn things work yet.

[40:34] They haven't even seen them flip yet.

[40:36] I mean, we're already crowning Rick and Morty to be the greatest game of all time and

[40:40] no one's even seen it flip.

[40:42] And that's where pinball is nowadays.

[40:45] People almost project.

[40:47] Ironically, we just project what we want games to be.

[40:52] How good we think they are going to be.

[40:54] I mean, we're projecting Lonnie's ability to make this game amazing when history is shown

[41:00] as that's probably not going to happen.

[41:03] And everything's become sort of like this unfinished desire to want to love something

[41:09] way more than it currently is.

[41:12] We have to buy on, buy on a whim because we might get locked out.

[41:18] And then we're buying stuff that we've never seen.

[41:20] We're buying stuff that's never tested.

[41:22] We're buying stuff for large amounts of money.

[41:27] And then the companies themselves, they won't even show us the stuff that they just sold

[41:32] us.

[41:33] And they won't even show us, or mail stuff to us, that's complete.

[41:37] And maybe you're happy with that.

[41:39] Maybe that's just the way it is in pinball.

[41:41] Maybe it's always going to be that way.

[41:43] And that's fine.

[41:44] That's fine.

[41:45] If this is the hobby, we all choose to be a part of.

[41:47] We've all chosen to be part of a hobby that mails people incomplete products and makes

[41:53] the customers be the guinea pigs on whether or not that game is going to one day become

[42:00] great mediocre or maybe bad.

[42:03] I look at all of this from the vantage point that I look at it from.

[42:07] And this is just me.

[42:08] My whole thing is this.

[42:09] I think the smart guy, the smart guy is just the guy who waits, waits to see if a game

[42:16] is good before he buys it.

[42:19] The smart guy is the guy that waits to see if the code gets to where he wants it.

[42:24] The smart guy waits to see if the projector actually works.

[42:27] I get all of us weren't smart.

[42:30] All of us who went in, blind on Rick and Morty, it's like we're all hypocrites.

[42:35] You put the theme in front of us, it doesn't matter.

[42:38] I'm buying.

[42:39] You put G1 Transformers in front of me, it doesn't matter.

[42:42] I'm buying it.

[42:43] You put he man in front of me, it doesn't matter.

[42:44] I'm buying it.

[42:45] Ninja Turtles in front of some people, it doesn't matter.

[42:48] They're buying it.

[42:49] Ninja Turtles, I just don't know about all the, are all these grown men really going to

[42:53] want Ninja Turtles in their house?

[42:54] I don't know, maybe.

[42:55] But you know what I'm saying?

[42:57] That's all I'm saying.

[42:58] Look, you can go get, I'm going to close off this episode.

[43:00] You can go get a $12,500 big Lebowski's now.

[43:03] People are starting to sell them for sticker price.

[43:06] Dr. Frightner's got one, someone else is selling one.

[43:09] So it's 2020.

[43:10] It's 2020 as of tomorrow.

[43:12] I don't think any of us are going to change.

[43:14] I don't think these manufacturers are going to change next year.

[43:18] I don't think the pinball people who got bit by the pinball bug will change much.

[43:23] I think we're still going to run towards the light.

[43:26] We're still going to be like moth to the flame.

[43:29] You give us a game, we're just, have to have the people on pins, I are going to hate it.

[43:33] The other half will love it.

[43:35] And they'll just tear each other's heads off over a pinball machine discussion.

[43:39] But I hope this review gave you some insights into the game.

[43:43] Again, I just think it's an unfinished game.

[43:46] I wish I could give you a review of the game when the game is done.

[43:51] But here's the thing, when is that going to be?

[43:53] And we all know this.

[43:54] By the time this game is done and you can give a review that's based on the final product,

[44:00] I guarantee you this.

[44:01] By the time that day comes, nobody will care about stranger things pinball because it'll

[44:07] be so many months from now.

[44:10] And once again, everyone who went in early, you're going to lose money and you're going

[44:15] to lose more and more money.

[44:17] And God, if you think in Ellie's going to hold value if that projector doesn't work, why

[44:21] would you take that risk?

[44:23] I know some of you have so much money, but I would rather spend that, those thousands

[44:28] of dollars on experiences that I would remember for the rest of my life.

[44:33] And I don't think this is going to be one of them.

[44:35] Everyone, happy, happy new year.

[44:37] I always love having this discussion with all of you out there.

[44:41] I think the trippy votes open up this week.

[44:45] So I hope all of you who love Canadian Spinball Podcasts can show your support and lending

[44:49] me a vote and getting a family member to vote.

[44:52] I hope you've enjoyed another year of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[44:56] We made it.

[44:57] We made it through another year.

[45:00] And that's only because of all of you who tune in and listen on a weekly basis to my

[45:05] opinions about the pinball industry and hobby.

[45:09] Everyone, have a happy and healthy 2020.

[45:12] And we'll come back real soon with more episodes of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[45:17] Have a great night.
