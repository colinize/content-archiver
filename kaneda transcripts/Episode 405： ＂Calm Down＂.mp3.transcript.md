[00:00] And snake's and Sans never wrote my bones Oh

[00:07] You need to calm down

[00:15] Alright, welcome to episode 405 of solving Canada's pinned ball podcast

[00:22] on your host Canada and we're gonna call this podcast just come down

[00:26] right? Everyone's so riled up. Maybe there are byproducts of 404 episodes of

[00:33] Canadian pinball podcast. So what I want to talk about? Well first of all, no word

[00:38] yet for Mr. Zach many if he's going to join the show. And I don't know why he's

[00:42] dodging the show. It'd be a great debate. I know you want to see it. I know he wants

[00:47] to talk about it. I know it's hard for Zach to step into the ring with

[00:51] Canada as a distributor and say something negative about a game that he wants

[00:56] you to buy buy buy. But anyway, here's the thing though. Zach and I are friends.

[01:01] Like this is all friendly banter. So if for a minute you think there's any

[01:05] nastiness or really any sort of vial competition going on, there is not. Now I

[01:11] did hear Dennis sort of throw some shady comments at me saying like I'm a

[01:15] studio apartment. No, it all. And Dennis, I am a know it all, but it's a one

[01:21] bedroom apartment. No, so let's let's let's let's let's I'm this episode of

[01:24] Canadian pinball podcast talk about a few of the recent things going on in the

[01:28] hobby. I want to start out with the big Lebowski because I know I haven't

[01:33] given you an update on where my big Lebowski is and what I'm going to do with it.

[01:39] And so I'm a little bit stuck and I'm not going to sell this game for a profit.

[01:44] I told you guys that from the very beginning. Now the game right now is sitting

[01:49] at coin taker in a box. It's fully paid for and it's sitting there in Pennsylvania.

[01:55] I need to figure out what to do with it. Here's what I was going to do with it.

[02:00] And I want to let you guys know on my Facebook page, I'm going to put up a

[02:04] poll so you can vote or you can always email me at canada pinballadgemail.com.

[02:09] If you think this is a good idea. So my plan was to auction off the big Lebowski

[02:16] pinball machine and any money that went over the $12,500 price point.

[02:23] I was going to donate that to a good cause. I was thinking of doing the pinball

[02:29] charity that puts the pinball machines in children's hospitals and I was going

[02:33] to do that. And so should I still do that? I also was considering finding someone

[02:40] who's an early achiever who didn't get their game and just giving them a chance to buy

[02:45] my machine for $12,500. So they could just cut the line and just go buy the machine.

[02:49] I know that's not the best thing to do because that person is then going to be out $21,000.

[02:57] But that's the only chance they have of getting a machine anyway. But if they wait, they

[03:02] might get one of Barry's machines with all his little special additives that he said

[03:07] he's going to put on these games. The third option is that I would just open the game

[03:13] and flip it and put it in my apartment and enjoy it. And I have to be honest while I

[03:18] think the game is great, I've always said I think Lebowski is one of the best world

[03:22] under glass titles. There's just something about this game that makes me not want to own

[03:27] it anymore. And it really has been the correspondence from Barry of recent newsletters.

[03:33] That makes me say this guy, I just don't want to support this guy. So that's where I'm

[03:37] at. We auction it off with any of the profits going to a good cause. We give an early achiever

[03:44] a chance to buy the game for exactly what I paid for it, no profit whatsoever, or I open

[03:49] the game and just enjoy it in my home. So I'm going to put up those three options on

[03:55] my Facebook page or you can email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com and let me know what you think I

[04:00] should do. Okay. All right. Now look, it does grind on me a little bit when people think

[04:05] I'm just this negative Nancy about everything. It's not true. I had a new can other pinball

[04:10] podcaster. I'm not even going to mention his show because he does a show about how like

[04:15] here are the five reasons why I love listening to canada and then I listen to the show and

[04:19] the guys like doggan on me and sandbagging me and saying I'm garbage like Jersey Shore entertainment

[04:25] and then he's saying I'm all this bipolar stuff. And I'm just going to say that's where

[04:29] I draw the line for those of you out there who think these like mental case things that

[04:35] are going on inside my world. I'm not the Joker like Joaquin Phoenix. I have a very

[04:41] normal and productive and healthy life. Okay. Now I will always say the most normal part

[04:47] of my day is when I work out and I exercise and I take good care of myself and I work

[04:54] hard at that. It's not even hard work when you start to get on the right lifestyle in

[04:58] life. Okay. I go to work. I enjoy what I do. I get to work with some of the most amazing

[05:04] brands in the world. I work with my best friends. Something you might not know is I've worked

[05:08] with the same people on my team now for over a decade and we really enjoy what we do.

[05:14] We get paid money to go in and think of creative ideas for a living to which multi billion

[05:21] dollar brands sometimes listen to me and do stuff. Sometimes they don't. I was just down

[05:26] at Coca-Cola company in Atlanta selling them on a new product launch idea that they liked.

[05:32] Hopefully we'll win the business but nothing is ever for sure. But I enjoy what I do and

[05:38] I enjoy and I love pinball and I think this recently I've been hearing a lot of people

[05:42] acting like that I don't love pinball and I just want to say you love pinball. You who

[05:48] listen to the show love pinball right you have to do to listen to pinball podcasts right

[05:52] no casual pinball person is like you know what I got nothing to do. Let me just check out

[05:56] some pinball podcasts it's not like that. But I just feel like there's this recent there's

[06:01] just this recent push to make sure everybody just loves everything and that we shouldn't

[06:08] have expectations that are aligned with where these games are at and I actually got a great

[06:13] comment for Mr. Ed Robertson Ed I love you brother and he said look Chris you're always

[06:18] saying we need pinball magic and he said the biggest magic happening in pinball is that

[06:24] stern pinball can reveal a game and put it in a box within 10 days and it's on the line

[06:30] and it's going to customers and you know what you know what Ed is right he's right yes

[06:36] while I do want there to be more toys in the game and I think that we're we have more

[06:40] of an emphasis on the code than the toys ultimately stern pinball their ability to get

[06:48] people these machines so quickly is pretty magical it's pretty incredible I just saw the

[06:53] picture of a viara on the line going out to people it I think it's a signature edition

[06:57] of the game and it's already getting ready to be put in a box now that being said I still

[07:04] will never in a million years think that the signature edition of Elvira is a good buy

[07:11] is good value and I still think if you bought one sure you're a sucker and I told this

[07:16] to Zach the people who spent $15,000 on the game that didn't get any upgrades in it there's

[07:21] no real upgrades they also know there are a sucker to buy it but they don't care right

[07:27] they don't care it's their money it's what they want and yeah I'm not upset by it they're

[07:32] not upset by it we're all just taking the piss out of each other a little bit but I wish

[07:38] I wish I had that much money where $5,000 meant nothing to me I wish I had and I was successful

[07:46] enough in which I could look at a product that looks exactly the same as the le and say I'll

[07:52] give you $5,000 more just because there's only 50 of them and here's the thing stern pinball

[07:59] is doing exactly what I said would happen or what I said is the market white space out there

[08:06] and pinball there is a market to give super wealthy people extremely limited versions of games

[08:14] and it would work and it has worked now here's the thing stern deserves every single penny they get

[08:22] with this new approach of you know certain times having limited versions of games without much

[08:28] added to them they deserve to sell off 50 those L virus because for years stern has been the only

[08:35] company that is consistently manufactured games on a timely basis built you know building the

[08:43] themes that you love or let's let's be honest here if this was 50 total nuclear annihilations for

[08:50] $15,000 this ain't happening that's not to knock TNA as a game but stern knows how to give you the

[08:58] dream themes you want and look when I thought you know the marketer and me and I was like L

[09:03] virus not relevant and I learned a lesson when she was at T.P.F. that year and the line was

[09:09] around the block so I'm not surprised that they sold all 50 games and I think stern has earned

[09:15] the right to take this approach and they're not they didn't mess around those 50 people are going

[09:19] to open their games probably before the fifth you know the 500 collectors editions of Willy Wonka are

[09:26] shown to the world all right so congrats stern on taking a page from canators marketing playbook you

[09:32] played it perfectly you put millions of dollars in the bank because you did it exactly the way

[09:38] you're supposed to do it get the rich guys their games first and the money will come all right okay

[09:46] what else is going on in pimple here's something you might not know about there was an awesome stream

[09:51] last night with Ryan over at CDC he's the VP of sales on the flipping out stream if you don't go

[09:58] to this on Monday nights I have to be honest you are missing the most fun hangout in all of pimple you

[10:06] know in fact I got an email from Jabber he's on there on the twitch every Monday no job or email

[10:11] to me and say Chris I enjoy every single episode of canators pimple podcasts and it's so exciting to

[10:17] see you on the twitch stream every Monday night I look forward to you coming on and having great

[10:23] conversation with huge fans like myself so I just want to say thank you to Jabber he's always on

[10:28] there on Monday night he's canate of pimples biggest fan but he that's what's great about it is we

[10:32] can chat in real time we have a stream going of a game and we have a personality in the room

[10:38] that's talking to you in real time I mean George Gomez was on we had Ryan from CDC we've had I

[10:45] think Dwight's been on one we've have all these great personalities beyond the show and I think you

[10:49] should watch it every Monday night now now here's a deal I've been hearing and this doesn't come from

[10:55] anyone other than you know my my contacts is that medieval madness remake will be is is is possibly

[11:03] coming back in a form that is going to be kind of like a super limited edition and what they're going

[11:10] to do is put the big screen into the game that we see on monster bash remake and attack from our so

[11:17] the wide screen they're also going to do an awesome topper for the game because we know that attack

[11:22] from ours and the monster bash toppers are incredible so and I heard they're going to make 250 of them

[11:29] now if that happens I really would have a hard time not buying one because medieval madness

[11:36] is still one of the greatest games ever it's really hard to go find a medieval man is remake Ellie

[11:42] I never see them come up for sale and if they make this special version I think that's going to be

[11:48] incredible but here's the here's the thing now what do they charge for it like they can't charge

[11:53] eight thousand dollars for it if they're because this ostensibly is they've already done a limited

[11:59] edition run so this would ostensibly be like a special limited edition of the game and so we'll see

[12:06] what happens with that but that's what I'm hearing is coming now bubble bark if you bark some more I

[12:11] might have to go out and rub his big bubble belly all right you know what else is awesome so I've known

[12:17] this for a while so you know who's a big pinball fanatic slash from guns and roses oh Bubba's

[12:23] barking hold on we're gonna go out there I'm gonna hit pause and come right back to the show

[12:27] all right I'm right back Bubba's belly has been rubbed okay so slash from guns and roses is a

[12:32] huge pinball fanatic and he loves pinball you know you can go see he has a wizard of us for sale on

[12:38] on eBay he also is working with Jersey Jack pinball on the new guns and roses pinball machine

[12:44] but a little fact that most people don't know is that slash has a monster bash remake

[12:51] and I've seen it and they made five special edition slash editions of monster bash remake

[12:58] in which the top executives at cgc have one and so does slash himself now what makes this

[13:04] edition super super cool they redid the translate on the game in which slash I think he replaces

[13:13] Dracula on guitar super super cool it's awesome it's like slash and he's got fang teeth and he's

[13:20] got you know the the top hat with the curly hair and it's super super cool so if you are a pinball

[13:26] sort of historian or connoisseur and want to know all the different types of limited versions of

[13:32] games that are out there the most sought after monster bash is will always be one of the slash

[13:38] editions but they're never you'll never find one for sale because it's like he has one and the

[13:42] Chicago gaming company people have them you will never see I think a game enter into the wild now

[13:47] a game that I never thought I would see for sale again is the matrix pinball remember the matrix

[13:54] pinball like four or five of them were made super cool re skin of johnny new monic okay so I had a

[14:00] chance to buy one of those two years ago at tpf I hesitated I passed I should have bought it right

[14:06] you know me I want a rare game based on a cool thing that like is super exclusive I I could have

[14:12] bought it for twenty thousand dollars and I wavered and it seems like too much I heard that a matrix

[14:18] recently changed hands for mid thirty thousand dollar price point mid thirty thousand dollar price

[14:27] point it has ended up in a rich hoarders collection and we will never see that game again but that is

[14:35] incredible those guys it's crazy to me that they did all that work and these games are

[14:41] sung for that much money that they wouldn't just do like another runner to of these games and

[14:46] sell them privately and don't even bother with Warner Brothers permission all right what else do I

[14:52] want to talk about on this episode of canate is pinball podcast so here's the thing I've been doing

[14:57] a lot of thinking and I've been watching a couple things happen I've been watching ghost busters

[15:02] the new code getting installed and people playing it and I've watched people's opinions about

[15:08] ghost busters radically change with the new code all of a sudden it feels like you can get through

[15:15] the game you can see more of the fun elements of the game it's not too hard it's not too brutal

[15:22] now I'm here on this episode of canate is pinball podcast with an idea and I think this is a really

[15:28] smart idea and I think this idea could get me to change my mind a little bit maybe a lot of it

[15:35] and maybe still have me go in on it on a game that I know I've been very critical of and I think

[15:41] the game that can learn the most from ghost busters is a game that you know by the name of Willie

[15:49] Wonka and I've been following Wonka threads as well and I hear a common theme in the Willie Wonka

[15:55] thread I love the game it's fun to shoot it's like it always makes me go for it and hit that

[15:59] start button one more game but I'm also hearing how extremely difficult Willie Wonka is and how

[16:06] very hard it is the way the game is designed and the way the game is coded to actually see a lot

[16:12] of the really really fun stuff that Joe Katz put into the game and then I look at ghost busters

[16:18] which had a similar issue in which it got really frustrating to try to climb the ladder and start

[16:23] all over again and how many people out there who have a Willie Wonka have been to Wonka's office

[16:29] how many of you have ever even seen pure imagination and I'm not saying that game should be easy

[16:36] but there is a lot in Willie Wonka that is super fun that people want to see more frequently

[16:43] and not everything should be so impossible to get to I always I always use the example of like

[16:48] destroy the ring and Lord the Rings like to me getting to destroy the ring in Lord the Rings

[16:54] is how difficult it should be to getting to pure imagination and you should see you know maybe

[17:00] Wonka's office is there and back again but I I think that if they went back and they thought about

[17:07] how to make the Willie Wonka code a little bit easier to see all the magical stuff coded in the game

[17:14] I think that would hugely improve you know the approachability of the game for a lot of people

[17:21] because people will reach a point where they're just going to get frustrated only being able to

[17:25] collect two golden tickets and the game is really hard now I think the coding wouldn't be a problem

[17:30] if the game was just easier but the game is a very difficult game because the you know three minute

[17:36] ball times plus deep code doesn't seem to make much sense now I agree with all of you out there

[17:43] who are loving your Willie Wonka's and love the way it shoots I also love the theme and I think

[17:48] the game does shoot tremendously well you know my issues have always been about the assets and I'm

[17:54] here to I'm here to tell you I'm just gonna forgive Jersey Jack and Joe and company for basically

[18:01] lying to me it's it's wood or under the bridge at this point I'm not gonna harp on it anymore

[18:06] they didn't tell me the truth and I it's all I asked for I just asked for them to be straight up

[18:11] and tell me what the deal was with the assets and I got a bunch of spin and you're not going to

[18:15] spin the spin doctor who works in public relations and that's it it's okay the game is what it is

[18:21] and for what it is right now I'm reading most of you are really loving the game do I think it's an

[18:28] asset miss because of the lack of this that it's you know what it's not even worth it at this point

[18:32] the game's been out for six months it is now what it is now see that's life you know for some people

[18:40] out there it's like can it is not allowed to change his mind he's not allowed to dog on a game

[18:43] and then like the game later I know how many people are like how hypocritical of you to like make

[18:48] fun of Elvira for 15000 when you bought Batman for 15000 and the thing is too I've said it before

[18:55] I'm a sucker for paying 15000 for Batman super Ellie it's not worth 15000 dollars in terms of what

[19:02] they put into the game I mean you even when you buy it from Stern you still have to go by like

[19:08] the mod couples stuff for another thousand dollars to get the game to look better right but that's

[19:14] my point is you know what sometimes you're gonna fall in love with the game and you just want it

[19:19] and it's worth it and so we will see we will see you know which direction Elvira goes in in which

[19:26] direction you know Batman goes in when it's finalized Batman's almost done but you know I think that

[19:33] willy-wanka and the collector's edition is just gonna be a really interesting this thing to

[19:37] see what happens with it because you know as a marketer I'm always curious to see how something sells

[19:43] like when it is available for sale and what will Jack put into this game will he this is interesting

[19:49] question will Jack actually contact some of the people who have been making some incredible mods

[19:57] for the game and will he implement some of those mods into the collector's edition standard now

[20:04] that's an interesting thing right because he's had six months of the game being out there and the

[20:10] fan base making some improvements to some of the stuff in the game will he incorporate them free

[20:17] of charge I mean albeit for the twelve thousand five hundred dollars into the game itself so we will

[20:23] see what happens with that but this thing it's October Jack needs to get this game the collector's

[20:29] edition out there because he will lose sales and if you are rooting for Jersey Jack to be successful

[20:35] with with this game you you do want to see him get this game out there sooner than later all right

[20:41] so is that is that a is that a fair enough truth that I'm willing to for you know forgive them for

[20:46] lying to me I'm willing to look at this game differently and I'm also I also think that they would

[20:51] benefit if they would look at what Ghostbusters did to make the game more approachable and more fun

[20:58] and maybe start to code the game that way a little bit to get people more golden tickets now

[21:05] it also led me to something I've been thinking a lot about why is it that when you walk up to a

[21:11] pinball machine it is only allowing you to play the game on one difficulty why can't you walk up to

[21:19] Willy Wonka or Jurassic Park or Ghostbusters or you know Elvira whatever game Star Wars why can't

[21:28] you walk up to a game and when you play it in the home environment it gives you the ability like a

[21:34] video game to select easy normal and expert modes why can't they do it that way so that if you're

[21:44] a true beginner you can hit easy and maybe easy has unlimited balls maybe easy has like ball saves

[21:52] that are 30 seconds maybe easy has you know one shot to start a mode right maybe that and but here's

[21:58] the thing I want them to code it in a way with you just select the macro skill set level it changes

[22:05] everything throughout the game to correspond with that right because I think it's silly that you

[22:10] have to go through an entire games menu system and start to adjust every single mode to make it

[22:19] easier or harder okay is that is that I don't know why this is not happening yet in pinball there

[22:26] there seems to be this inability to understand that why can't a a home use person have the ability

[22:34] to set up the game in a way that's more friendly for not only himself but maybe his family maybe his

[22:39] children and I think that would just make total sense right so then right now because right now

[22:45] if if I'm totally honest I think Willy Wonka is a little bit on expert mode and the only people

[22:51] were seeing get to pure imagination are expert players that are just phenomenal and everyone else

[22:58] is kind of like a beginner slash novice player and they're not getting very far they're getting

[23:04] two golden tickets you know so I think like the normal player should be able to get two to three

[23:09] golden tickets on most games on on an epic game and a halo run he gets four to five and I think

[23:18] you know when you put it on easy mode then just like your casual like player friend wife child should

[23:24] be able to get two to three golden tickets by doing pretty simple things in the game and you could

[23:28] code it that way so you know to me that's the kind of approach to pinball that we're still not

[23:35] seeing anybody do and every game just comes out of the box in expert mode is the same reason I

[23:41] I don't understand them not putting the post in the left out lane and and lawler just made it really

[23:46] hard okay all right what else is going on in pinball so did you enjoy the black night interview it's

[23:52] always fun talking to Chris you know he gets like some polarizing responses from people I will say

[23:58] I will say I do think it's too early to be disappointed by Elvira I also feel like some of the

[24:04] things Chris was saying like it's repetitive like there's a shot up the middle and it's like

[24:09] almost every single game has a shot up the middle that's rewarding it just works like you really

[24:15] can only shoot straight left and right right and some shots you know I know we have like different

[24:21] you know upper plate fields and whatnot but for the most part everything in pinball is a little

[24:25] bit repetitious it's how it's implemented and I think a shot into that haunted house you know

[24:32] via is cool like I don't think I've seen Stern do a mech like that in a really long time so I think

[24:39] we should give them credit for that you know this isn't just a cookie cutter boring shot like the

[24:44] Herman monster shot or you know the Batman turntable shots are pretty boring I I do think the shots

[24:50] that are happening in Elvira are much more unique than most recent Stern offerings so you know

[24:56] there's that as well and look ultimately you know you could look around at a pinball machine and be

[25:01] like well why why are those slingshots always in the same place why are the flippers always at the

[25:06] bottom of the game like that like why can anyone think differently about the way a game could be

[25:11] and and that's that could be a fair assessment maybe just something called gravity forces us to

[25:16] put that stuff there all the time all right what else is going on in the pinball world sun coast

[25:22] pinball is still bankrupt let me read some emails from you guys trying to think if there's anything

[25:27] I'm missing in the world of pinball nothing new from Dutch spooky pinball I expect to see something

[25:34] at expo alien pinball will it come back at expo that is one of the rumors I'm going to have Christopher

[25:43] Franchi come on the show one time in the near future we're still working on when that will be

[25:48] I think he's taking his talents elsewhere I think that's pretty public information I know he's

[25:53] been going back and forth I think Christopher Franchi is an incredible artist and anyone who lands his

[26:00] talents within their pinball studio is going to have a phenomenal looking game he's very outspoken

[26:08] you get more than just the artwork with mr. franchi he knows that his new employer definitely knows

[26:15] that but ultimately I think he's worth it I think he knows I think he has a knack to to how to

[26:21] how to make a good pinball machine you know Jurassic Park to me I still think the art is not that great

[26:27] I it's just a composition of it it just doesn't it doesn't jump out at me the way franchi's games

[26:34] and yet he's games jump out at me okay now speaking of like what's next from stern and

[26:41] Jurassic Park Elvira now what's next do we think and this is like these are some of the rumors

[26:47] that's turned as two titles between now and the end of the year one is a cornerstone and that

[26:54] must mean that another could possibly be a vault edition of a game now if sternward of vault

[27:02] a game right now what would it be I think the one that makes the most sense if you really think

[27:07] about it the game they should probably vault right around now because if you look at it now it's not

[27:12] available for sale anymore is ghost busters ghost busters has been reborn it's the new code people

[27:21] are loving it it's much more approachable and I think they should go back and they should do

[27:28] another run of ghost busters now I will that happen I don't know it seems to make logical sense the

[27:35] other one that we always hear rumors about is tron I don't think they would sell nearly as many

[27:41] trons as ghost busters but the kicker is this they already sold so many ghost busters so do we

[27:49] need another ghost busters and you know me I would love to have more than any of those a rerun

[27:56] of lord of the rings pinball all right let's see do do do I got an email from dan donnell

[28:03] he says you versus zi I mean that's probably you versus zak he said shortest episode but best

[28:09] episode ever I hope this debate actually happens but I'm 99% sure it won't when you get going like

[28:18] that it's usually pretty f and funny who deenie out of the box you get flipper toppers flipper toppers

[28:25] swear if I had been drinking milk it would have shot out of my nose well dan you know look let's

[28:32] up the ante a little bit if zak many comes on this show and debates me and talks to me about pinball

[28:39] I will donate two hundred dollars to the pinball charity program that those nice gentlemen do I

[28:45] think it's in Pittsburgh or in Pennsylvania somewhere how about that mr zak many two hundred dollars

[28:50] I will donate immediately just if zak comes on this show already got an email from jerry

[28:57] he says hey christ just want to say hi great job on the podcast mate loving it thinking about what

[29:03] you keep saying about elvira being way way overpriced and not worth the money however wasn't it you

[29:11] who kept banging on about a manufacturer needing to sell to the super high end collector market where

[29:18] the rich guys would pay anything for a super limited edition release well here you have it the

[29:25] elvira s le now sure it may not be how you dreamed it in your head pack full of features that the

[29:32] whole world under glass thing but stern are doing in they're doing it their way and releasing that

[29:38] high end limited availability how they see it you really are a marketing genius ha ha ha keep up the

[29:45] awesome job cheers jerry well jerry thank you it's not even like genius work it's just common sense

[29:52] you know people are buying like baseball cards where it's like one of one gold rookie car for

[29:57] five thousand dollars and that's something that doesn't even have any moving parts all right let's

[30:02] see what else I got here did I read this one you guys do do do do all right so here's the thing

[30:10] there's a thing I know we go up and down we go around this carousel in life of falling in love with

[30:17] games having high expectations for pinball loving canators pinball podcasts hating canate his pinball

[30:24] podcasts telling you know canate he's wrong saying he's the only one who speaks opinionated things

[30:31] about the hobby ultimately I hope you're entertained by this show I hope I can give you some tidbits

[30:38] of news every once in a while I hope I can deliver you rumors about things I'm hearing that are

[30:44] going on inside the hobby and I hope that we articulate some of the things that are in your head

[30:50] when you're thinking about pinball okay that's why we're here that's why we do it that's why we

[30:54] enjoy it I don't need like two and a half hours to get to you guys like what's going on the world

[30:59] and I'm not going to sit here on a podcast and explain to you like how to play games I'm not going

[31:05] to explain to you like when a new game comes out like go feature by feature on it because I just

[31:10] think that stuff is better discussed on on a video stream and my god there are more people streaming

[31:18] pinball now than in the history of mankind it's kind of awesome it's kind of overwhelming where to go

[31:25] but it's great because here's the thing pinball streams are positive now personally after like a

[31:30] half hour of seeing someone stream a game on board out of my mind I mean the fun is really in the

[31:34] chat room and watching someone yeah it's like watching I don't get you know watching people play

[31:40] video games I really don't you know but again twitch is like a multi billion dollar operation that

[31:45] proves me wrong but let's all like enjoy it I think the the end of the year is going to be a good

[31:51] time in pinball I think we're going to see a lot of new games come out some of which we didn't expect

[31:56] some of which we didn't even call some of which we didn't even rumor about I am going to do

[32:02] I'm going to Japan sorry guys I'm long day I'm going to Japan for my honeymoon

[32:08] October 14th through the 31st now there is a very good likelihood that I will not be

[32:15] lugging this microphone with me I will be spending a dream trip focused on the food the people the

[32:24] architecture the sights the sounds the rugby world championship we're going to Disney Tokyo we're

[32:29] going to Seoul South Korea we're going to stay in awesome hotels we're going to we're going to

[32:33] have a great time it's my honeymoon and it's also going to be a little bit of a honeymoon away

[32:38] from pinball podcasting so if you are disgusted with this show then you will have two and a half

[32:44] weeks by which you can simply go enjoy every other pinball podcast that is out there and there are

[32:51] many to select from if you love Canadian pinball podcast you may want to not listen for like a couple

[32:58] weeks leading up to that so maybe you stop right now and then you will have enough pinball podcast

[33:05] episodes to catch up on because I will have done between now and then you know if we keep at this

[33:11] pace probably another five or six shows you know you never know you never know with this podcast but

[33:17] I want to thank everyone for listening I want to thank all of you guys out there who support the

[33:21] show who send me nice notes on Facebook I want to thank all of you who donate to the Patreon

[33:27] account I really do appreciate it it is a lot of time it is a lot of effort for not a lot of money

[33:33] so I do appreciate you guys supporting the show out of 2500 listeners about like 45 of you actually

[33:40] you know donate to the show we can do better I know you guys out there can afford a dollar a month

[33:46] like the price of a cup of coffee a day for canada but you know everyone gives what they can

[33:51] and I appreciate that I was joking with Ken at special one lit because he started a patreon page

[33:56] but again like his tears I'm like bro like you have to do stuff when people donate at different tears

[34:03] the one thing I need to do for canada's pinball podcast for all you fans out there I need to get you

[34:08] merchandise I need to make merchandise whether it's hats whether it's t-shirts and you best believe

[34:13] they are going to be snarky t-shirts about canada's pinball podcast that you can wear at pinball

[34:19] shows because I am the only it's like where the number one pinball podcast and we don't even have

[34:24] an ability for you to sort of broadcast to the world out there that you listen to this show

[34:31] so we're gonna get on that I think that is uh is gonna be fun exercise for Brendan and I to make

[34:36] you guys some fun merchandise to buy and to wear um I will not I will not be at pinball expo

[34:44] so I know there is going to be a meet the pinball media at at a pinball expo I think that's going

[34:49] to be a lot of fun I would have loved to have been there I was telling the people organizing it I

[34:54] think they should make a life size cut out of the canada animated figure and if you press a button

[35:00] it just plays the head-to-head laugh track so I thought that would be like a really funny way to

[35:05] have canada's presence be at the show I'm sure we will get a lot of like royal rumble podcasts

[35:11] from all the great guys that are going to be there you know at the meet the pinball media section

[35:16] uh and I think expo is gonna have some surprises so I look forward to detaching for a couple weeks

[35:21] and coming back to America and I you best believe I will be on the internet seeing what is revealed

[35:27] I'm curious to see what the presence of pinball is in Japan uh but anyway everybody come on

[35:32] everyone needs to calm down let's enjoy this hobby and uh we'll talk to you real soon this has

[35:39] been episode 305 of canada's pinball podcast

[36:09] so

[36:16] To just love

[36:18] So can you just know it?

[36:20] The fun of gowns you need to calm down
