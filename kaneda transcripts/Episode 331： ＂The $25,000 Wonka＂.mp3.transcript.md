[00:00] When you call my name, it's like going to do a prayer.

[00:04] I'm down on my beat, I wanna take you there.

[00:08] Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

[00:12] Welcome to episode 331 of Canadian pinball podcast,

[00:16] the only pinball podcast that needs extra security at pinball shows.

[00:21] All right, so here's the deal.

[00:22] I wasn't going to do another podcast,

[00:24] but I was reading something and I just felt compelled to do another show.

[00:28] And I love having vacation like this because I've had a lot more time to think about stuff and taking contemplate

[00:34] What is going on in the world of pinball?

[00:37] So here's the thing

[00:37] I want to just clarify some stuff for you guys out there who listen to this show

[00:42] And I think you should listen to me and actually believe what I'm about to tell you because I know that my last couple of rumors

[00:49] That turned out to be maybe not accurate

[00:52] It might have some of you thinking I'm not telling you the truth anymore in pinball

[00:57] But here's the deal if you are about to buy a Batman 66 premium do not buy it yet

[01:06] I'm just telling you that right now do not go in on a Batman premium until you see

[01:12] The new Batman premium that Stern has coming out down the line. It's happening. There's gonna be a entirely new

[01:20] Art package that you're gonna want in Batman, okay?

[01:24] Now look you could ignore canada and you can just go buy the game and then you're gonna kick yourself

[01:29] When you realize you should have waited and you should have listened to canada, you know crazy old uncle canada

[01:35] Actually knows what he's talking about here. So trust me

[01:38] You're gonna want to wait and get the new Batman premium that comes out all right

[01:43] There is new code coming out too for Batman. I know I love it guys like you little bird

[01:47] They they don't want to just say my name say it you little bird mod couple you know what I'm talking about canada knows

[01:52] What's happening and so do many of you out there? Why don't you guys share the truth more often on pin sight all right

[01:57] So here's the deal here's what I want to talk about on this episode of canada's pinball podcast and it's sort of been

[02:02] Eating away at me and I'll tell you what it is why

[02:06] Didn't more companies actually utilize

[02:09] Texas pinball festival this year and I want to talk about that because

[02:14] It's sort of weird to me that we had this humongous show down in Texas

[02:19] We had all of these people down in Texas traveling from all over the world to get to what I believe is the best pinball show that

[02:28] Happens annually in America and maybe globally for that fact, right?

[02:32] So here we have the setting is perfect. You have all these people you have a captive audience and

[02:38] Every single pinball company that was there pretty much dropped the ball when it came to

[02:45] Revealing anything when it came to seminars when it came to you know getting people excited to buy their games

[02:52] There was really wasn't much of a wow or a surprise moment or any true reveals that blue people away

[03:00] You know the only real reveal we got was the yellow brick road edition of Jersey Jack pinball now here's

[03:06] Here's what I want to talk about because this is what I'm hearing I am hearing that we are going to see Willy Wonka really soon

[03:12] And I mean really really soon. I mean it could be as early as next week. It could be two weeks from now

[03:17] I don't and then and then there's a whole rumor about the game being at

[03:22] MGC, okay, we're gonna talk about that. But why why didn't Jack if Willy Wonka is done if the game is pretty much finished?

[03:30] Why didn't he at least

[03:32] Reveal the game at T.P.F. Why not? I don't understand this. I don't understand why Jack was there

[03:41] He was there his team was there and they got up there and they they they fumbled over a yellow brick road launch

[03:49] With absolutely no polish and no rehearsal

[03:52] They looked really bad and and they have they had a room full of at least a hundred people plus maybe two hundred people

[03:59] Plus an entire convention that was just waiting to hear something

[04:04] Surprising and exciting and nobody got it and then we we just saw yellow brick road and we heard all about the fact that it's

[04:11] 11,500 and there's no monkey in it

[04:13] We're gonna talk about that a little bit more on this episode

[04:16] But why didn't Jack at least tease or show something from Willy Wonka? Why not?

[04:23] Why not? All right

[04:24] We're gonna go back to Jersey Jack

[04:26] But what about the other company out there? What about Stern Pimbalm?

[04:30] I mean we literally had Steve Richie at Texas Pimbal Festival

[04:35] Steve Richie had a seminar in which he promised

[04:39] Secrets were going to be revealed and he didn't deliver anything that was of significance in the Pimbal world and so then on like two days later

[04:49] We get the game black night, you know sort of rage

[04:53] How can we just pause for a minute and just say how is that not idiotic?

[04:59] How is that not ludicrous that Stern Pimbal has Steve Richie?

[05:04] They're you know their main designer the king of all Pimbal at Texas Pimbal Festival

[05:09] He's friends with Kim and Ed and and and here we have this captive audience and nothing

[05:15] Absolutely nothing and we just wait two days everyone has to fly home and read about black night swords of rage on IGN

[05:22] It's like that's it. I mean our why I don't know

[05:26] I just want to stop and say I think it's absolutely ridiculous that all of these manufacturers

[05:33] Did nothing at T.P.F. They did absolutely nothing and I don't know if they avoided the show because they thought that deep route was gonna

[05:40] Own the show but come on. It's total bullshit that they they were there and they could not

[05:47] Give the people in the room a first look at the black night because also

[05:52] It's not like when you see the game on IGN

[05:54] You're you're not getting much other than photos and you're not getting much other than a video

[05:59] But it would have been awesome to show that game to have Steve dress up in in a night costume and walk down

[06:06] You know the aisle of the seminar room and announce to the world that his next game is black night swords of rage and had Tim

[06:14] Sexed in there and have the team there and had them walk through how exciting this game is because

[06:20] Why not like Texas is a bigger show than the Midwest gaming classic and it would have been the perfect setting for it and

[06:27] To hold it for 48 hours. I don't get it. I really don't get it same thing with Jersey Jack

[06:35] It's like you know how much better

[06:37] Yellow brick road edition would have been received if it was coupled with

[06:42] The Willy Wonka announcement at tpf, you know, it's it's all it's all about positioning

[06:48] It's all about explaining what you're doing

[06:51] And you could have done both of them and I think it would have gone over much better if

[06:56] Yellow brick road edition was a little bit of just like a footnote on the evening

[07:00] But the main point of the evening was to tell people that Willy Wonka is in fact the next title and we're gonna show you a couple things

[07:07] To get you excited about this game now

[07:10] Now it didn't happen it didn't happen and I think tpf was a really missed opportunity for a lot of these companies

[07:18] You know and and again, it's like if you walk away from the show the two main games that I think at the most

[07:24] Presence at the show where the monsters and October fest

[07:28] I think those were the games that had the best showing at tpf and then you probably could say

[07:34] Kingpin games had a lot of pirates the carabines there, but what's the point those games are not gonna be made anymore

[07:40] And they're getting yanked off of the line

[07:42] So what what is the point of getting people excited about a pirate of the Caribbean?

[07:47] Ellie because there are none to be had it just makes absolutely no point

[07:51] It is really interesting to me that black knight is bit has been revealed so close to the monsters absolutely

[08:01] Strange marketing move. I do think the monsters premium would have had a little bit more time to get people to buy and get the money there

[08:10] But stern isn't really care because you know what if you cancel your monsters order and you order a

[08:16] Black knight why would stern even care because the money is going to stern now

[08:21] That is why it is really interesting that Willy Wonka is supposedly

[08:25] Going to be revealed in the next couple of weeks, but here's the thing that I keep hearing and I wish someone would just clarify

[08:32] Why do we have to guess?

[08:33] Why do we have to guess on whether or not Willy Wonka is going to be at the Midwest gaming classic and I think

[08:40] Jack should tell people yes or no because it's it's kind of getting

[08:45] Ridiculous at this point that we have a lot of information floating around that seems to be like

[08:50] Who do you believe because I keep hearing that Jack is going to be in France?

[08:55] That weekend so he is not going to be

[08:59] At the Midwest gaming you know convention because of a prior commitment to be in France

[09:05] So if Jack is not there do you really think they're going to reveal

[09:09] Willy Wonka without Jack there so

[09:12] But I keep hearing when you look at guys like LTG and you look at kingpin games

[09:17] They keep saying the newest game from Jersey Jack pinball is going to be at their booth

[09:22] So here's what I think is going to happen here is what what what I think is going to happen

[09:26] I think next week you're going to get Willy Wonka revealed to you

[09:31] It'll be in a video format and maybe Jack has a new story

[09:34] But I think he's going to put out the press release about Willy Wonka pinball

[09:38] I think you're going to see it for the first time next week

[09:41] And I think because of that reveal and Jack will have a video and maybe some other assets and stuff to go along with it

[09:47] I think that is going to be how he does it

[09:49] And then I think they are going to have the game there even if Jack is not at the show itself

[09:54] I don't think the reveal is going to happen at a show

[09:57] Alla like a seminar room like it would have at tpf

[10:01] And again if you ask me I think it was absolutely stupid

[10:05] That they didn't bring the game to tpf because Jack was there the captive audience was there

[10:11] It's a bigger stage to reveal the game

[10:14] I hear people even saying like it doesn't matter these shows don't matter

[10:18] And I'm here to tell those guys who are who are cynical about the power of a show

[10:23] I think they're wrong

[10:24] I do think they're wrong for those of you who go to shows like tpf

[10:28] You have hundreds of people who are who have who have who are drinking alcohol

[10:34] Who who would write big checks who would take out their credit cards

[10:37] Who would put deposits down on the spot for games

[10:41] You have got to be out of your mind if you think

[10:44] Not doing something at tpf doesn't really matter in the larger scheme of things

[10:48] It does matter it does create a little bit of a feeding frenzy

[10:52] Imagine if a manufacturer said

[10:55] At Texas pinball festival you know the first like

[10:58] You know the first 500 games we sell you're going to get them first and at tpf attendees get it exclusively

[11:04] Right so the first if you're attending tpf

[11:07] You can sort of cut the line and get the game first. I mean they could do special things

[11:12] To make the people who are sitting in the attendance of those seminars

[11:16] Feel special and create a sense of urgency in ordering

[11:20] I mean the only dude who I ever see do anything around shows and special deals

[11:25] Is jerry at multi-morphic and then I know Marco does a special where if you buy a game that they put out at tpf

[11:32] It's discounted a little bit

[11:34] I just still would never buy a game that is being pounded on all week and long by by strangers

[11:40] But that's just me so I think it's a big miss

[11:43] I think that these companies need to reevaluate

[11:47] Texas pinball festival and I think they need to do a better job of understanding

[11:52] Look if tpf is the end of March and we're going to announce this game in April

[11:57] Why don't we just announce it at tpf?

[11:59] And I think Jersey jack and stern both missed a golden opportunity to do something more significant at that show

[12:06] And I don't know how you feel about it, but that's how I feel about it now

[12:10] Let's talk about the yellow brick road edition because

[12:13] I've had some more days to think about this thing and I still can't figure it out

[12:17] So you yank out the monkey mech. Okay now I know people have been talking about this

[12:23] But I don't understand

[12:25] Yanking it out and I'll tell you why because it's still in the other versions of the game

[12:31] It's still in the ruby red version of the game and it's still in the emerald city version and the standard version

[12:37] I never really remember hearing people say that this mechanism was prone to breaking

[12:42] I don't I haven't seen a lot of conversation around that mech being a problem in the game

[12:49] Which leads me to believe that the only reason this mechanism was removed from the game

[12:54] Was not because of reliability. I think that was a bullshit sort of spin move by JJ P

[13:01] It leads me to believe that the reason it was removed was because of cost and they and and they were just trying to get the price of the game down

[13:11] But which also strange is so they do that right?

[13:14] They seemingly removed the monkey mech and then they put back in the wood and apron from the emerald city edition

[13:22] Obviously cost more money to have that wood apron than the plastic apron that they put into the ruby red edition remember

[13:30] And there was a lot more uproar when jack removed the the wood in apron when he did the ruby red

[13:35] And there was a lot more uproar when the direct printing changed over to decals in the game

[13:41] And so what is going on? What is going on? I'm not quite sure

[13:47] How these decisions are getting made so they're saving money here, but they're adding money over here

[13:53] Why why and then they're charging more money now? Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a hypothetical question

[14:00] How much more excited would you be about the the the yellow brick road edition if the monkey was actually in it now imagine that

[14:08] The monkey's in it we got the wood apron

[14:11] We got the new cabinet with the news cabinet style. We've got the you know the PCB is now in the in the head of the game

[14:18] It's not underneath in the cabinet anymore. It's got the all news sort of like updated light boards

[14:23] So what if jack

[14:26] Actually made the yellow brick road edition seemingly worth more because everything he had learned to date was in the game

[14:33] And everything was there

[14:35] Then all of a sudden

[14:37] I think people look at this game so differently

[14:40] They they I don't think there's as much backlash

[14:43] I don't think there's a reason to complain as much and especially if he said from day one

[14:48] We are making only

[14:50] 500 yellow brick road edition wizard of Oz games and then we are never making the wizard of Oz ever again

[14:58] All right, this is it. This is the final run of wizard of Oz

[15:01] How would you have received that then how would the news have been taken?

[15:05] I think people would have warmed up to that

[15:08] I think people who love this game and I think people who have wanted a wizard of Oz who might have been on the fence

[15:14] Would not have looked at this so negatively and knowing that it was the final run of the game

[15:20] And it was you know a new version a new limited edition

[15:24] But it needed to have all the bells and whistles in it. I just don't know how you feel good about buying a yellow brick road edition

[15:31] Knowing that the monkey's not in it

[15:32] It just seems so strange to me to go up market with the price and yet

[15:37] Yank out one of the key mechanical features of the game

[15:41] And I think because of that it's sort of going to be a game that

[15:46] Is out of demand pretty quickly

[15:48] I can't see these games selling all 500. I just don't especially here's why so they announced yellow brick road edition

[15:57] All right, what like a week ago and now we're gonna get willy-wanka a week later and why would anybody go back and buy wads again

[16:06] At 11,500 dollars when you can go buy a wizard of Oz emerald city or ruby-wreight edition for much much cheaper and you probably will want to buy

[16:16] um willy-wanka okay because that's the newest and the latest and the greatest now

[16:21] Speaking of willy-wanka how are you guys feeling about the game? We right? I mean hypothetically speaking obviously

[16:28] We haven't seen anything yet

[16:30] What I'm really curious about is this

[16:32] I'm really curious to see what pat lawler brings to the table here because if you remember

[16:39] dialed in was a game that pat lawler had been working on for years like this is a game he had been designing

[16:46] Long before Jersey jack even came to him and said they wanted to get a pat lawler design

[16:52] Out into the world through Jersey jack pinball remember like we saw there were elements in dialed in that were very similar to what pat was working on with pinball

[17:01] 2000 with that wizard blocks game right those like sort of like those lights that

[17:07] That are like the laser beam heading towards the flippers that was a carryover from wizard blocks

[17:13] So we know that this design

[17:16] Um from dialed in was not like completely original that pat had been working on it for a long time now that leads me to

[17:24] To wanka which is

[17:25] What is he gonna do with wanka like what are gonna be the mechanisms? What are gonna be the toys?

[17:29] I'm here to confirm for you because I've been asking this and I got confirmation of this

[17:33] willy wanka will not be a

[17:36] Re skin of anything we've seen before from Jersey jack pinball

[17:40] There will not be a reusing of mechanisms from any other Jersey jack game in willy wanka

[17:46] It is in a completely original design

[17:50] You are never gonna see Jersey jack re skin stuff. You are not gonna see them vault stuff and re skin stuff

[17:56] You're not gonna see toy story be a re skin of dialed in. It's just not gonna happen

[18:01] It's not how jack makes his games

[18:03] And I got confirmation of that from someone who's one of their biggest distributors

[18:07] So it's all gonna be original

[18:09] And it's gonna be pat lawler and willy wanka now it is based on the original movie with gene wilder

[18:15] It's not based on the johnny depth version. I'm excited. I really am this is the kind of game that I could see myself going in on

[18:23] I can't wait. I can't wait to see it. It's gonna happen sometime soon

[18:27] I wish we would have saw it at tpf. That's why I wanted to do this podcast

[18:32] Oh, man, but the question of pricing is the other thing right how much how much

[18:37] It's gonna be willy wanka versus a black knight

[18:40] Uh, our april title selections are going to be those two now here is what I'm hearing that willy wanka is going to ship

[18:47] Are you ready for this? All right, so we are going to see the game in April all right when in April

[18:52] I don't know probably by mid april now. I'm hearing the game is going to ship in June

[18:58] So that makes it pretty quickly right we're gonna have just six weeks between the gamer vio and games hitting the line

[19:06] They might even be on the line right now. I actually am hearing that there is a willy wanka on its way to australia

[19:13] Already to show people the game and what the game will be now this game is

[19:18] Everything to jersey jack if you don't think that this entire company is riding on this game

[19:26] You where have you been over the last five to seven years and when you know in the pinball hobby

[19:31] This is it this really is jack's last chance to make a hit pinball machine

[19:38] And I hope he does it and I hope they succeed because I know a lot of you out there are really pulling for jersey jack

[19:45] Because you can't wait to see what jack does next

[19:49] It is the one pinball company that really does go above and beyond what everyone else is doing

[19:54] To bring new excitement into the pinball world

[19:57] This is not Chicago gaming company just sort of cheating a little bit and remaking old games with new displays

[20:03] No, these guys are trying to make

[20:06] Completely new magical pinball experience and there's nobody that's putting as much into the games right now

[20:13] As jersey jack is and they've shipped you know no one everyone's got in their games

[20:18] Like jack hasn't like screwed people over nobody lost their money on jersey jack games

[20:23] You know where's deep route? I mean seriously Robert. I know you listen to the show

[20:27] Where are you guys like what is your schedule like what's your time frame

[20:32] When are we gonna hear from deep route when are they gonna reveal themselves now?

[20:36] Here's the other date everyone needs to keep in mind

[20:39] June 30th is the date by which deep route

[20:43] Needs to give the magic girl or the z it sorry just the zidware owners

[20:47] That's the date that's in the contract that deep route needs to deliver a game to the zidware owners that sign the contract with Robert

[20:55] So let's see we've got it's April may

[20:59] June all right, so like three months from now deep route is going to have to do something and ship something

[21:06] And so we hope they have their manufacturing

[21:09] Capabilities ramping up because it's it's it's has to happen there's no longer

[21:16] An ability for I think deep route to spend all this money every month and not sell you anything

[21:22] How much money is going into the pockets of all the designers and the coders and the artist and you know

[21:29] The storytellers and all these people have to get paid like Robert has to pay all these people

[21:35] And yet there's not a single penny coming into that company at some point

[21:39] Deep route will have to reveal themselves to the world. So

[21:43] It has to be soon. It has to be soon

[21:46] Oh, man as you can tell like I'm excited and I am utterly

[21:50] Fatigue at the same time. I kind of feel like a game is revealed now

[21:54] And it's already old news and like a week

[21:56] It's like yeah, man black night. I played that game like four years ago. You know

[22:00] Sort of sort of rage. I gave him so old. It's so yesterday that mechanism like what's next turn?

[22:06] It's we can't even give these games any time to even develop a following or fan base

[22:13] Or sort of like accolades because it's just on to the next on to the next

[22:17] I don't know. It's crazy and because pinball is is weird like this right?

[22:22] There's no launch schedule for pinball machines

[22:26] Everything is launched in secrecy and nobody knows what anyone else's plans are in advance

[22:32] And if you think about that

[22:33] That's kind of crazy

[22:35] Read we know when movies are coming out we know in music CDs are coming out we know when

[22:41] You know we know in video games are gonna be released but pinball machines

[22:45] It's anybody's guess when something is coming out. So if you're a manufacturer

[22:49] You have no idea

[22:51] Really what else will come out around the same time as your game? You're kind of guessing

[22:57] When is the right time to release your game? I mean think about octoberfest for a minute

[23:02] Let's think about our friends over an american pinball

[23:05] How would they know when the right time is to launch their game?

[23:08] When would you say is like the right time to release octoberfest?

[23:11] So they showed the game in october

[23:14] Right that was like six months ago

[23:16] And the game is now finally starting to sort of ship and take orders. It's not shipping yet

[23:22] But I think orders are going to open up and games will start to go into boxes in april now. Guess what?

[23:29] Would you say april is a good month for them to get the game out with black knight with monsters with Willy

[23:36] Wonka with all those games coming out right now

[23:40] Alice Cooper's finally shipping you can go get an Alice Cooper and get on the list

[23:44] So like is it a good time for them to hit that window? Probably not

[23:50] Probably not, but they were delayed other games were delayed other games are on schedule

[23:56] It's just a fucking free for all it is an absolute free for all

[24:01] And I saw someone start a thread about like marketing is important and these companies need to understand marketing and do a better job at marketing

[24:08] It's a little bit of yes and no like it there's only so much marketing you can do

[24:13] But when it comes to like when you release your game. Yes, that's a marketing decision

[24:18] When do we bring this game to market and when do we open the order books up and I don't think anyone has like a real strategy

[24:25] You can't tell me that American pinball strategy was to release a game called october fest in april

[24:32] It we know that wasn't their strategy

[24:35] Was it their strategy to show you the game in october and then wait six months to actually finish it

[24:40] It made no sense. They could have just revealed the game at tpf

[24:44] And then had games in boxes

[24:46] Imagine that wouldn't that be better

[24:48] Have that be the moment in which everyone gets to see it and play it and then there's like a hundred games in box ready to ship at the show

[24:55] Why not do it that way

[24:57] And so this is where we are and I think because pinball has such sort of like everyone's just sort of winging it on some level other than stern

[25:06] I think it's gonna be hard for these companies to survive

[25:10] I do and I don't mean that like I want any of these companies to fail

[25:14] But I just don't get a sense that a lot of these companies have a plan

[25:17] What is your plan like even even jersey jack? I look at it and I'm like is was this their plan?

[25:24] No, you can't tell me their plan was to have pirates of the Caribbean

[25:28] Delayed a year to have all those mechanisms not work in the game to to yank that game off the line with only

[25:34] Thousand units being made that wasn't their plan

[25:36] You can't tell me that the plan wasn't to have toy story ready to go ready to go

[25:42] You knew toy story four was coming out in theaters the summer of

[25:47] 2019

[25:48] Shouldn't your plan be to have the damn pinball machine ready at the same time right?

[25:54] It's just like they missed it. They did the same thing with the hobbit

[25:58] He did not have the game ready when the hobbit was in theaters and it's just like how many times

[26:05] Are these companies going to just do this you know? I don't even get Jurassic world at this point

[26:10] I don't understand why is Jurassic world coming out now

[26:16] Think about that for a minute why

[26:18] The the second movie came out and it was shit the first one was good

[26:22] I did like the first Jurassic world, but why now like why not just make a Jurassic Park?

[26:28] You know what I'm saying? It's like it's like stern winning got the license for it

[26:32] But there's the timing of Jurassic world in

[26:37] Summer make any sense to you does it like why don't they have like an Avengers endgame

[26:44] Pinball machine. I understand they've already made an Avengers

[26:48] Pinball machine, but really what he asked yourself what's the hot movie this summer?

[26:54] And does anyone have a pinball machine that's lined up with the hot movie this summer? No

[27:00] And and that's why I just don't get it. I don't get who makes these decisions

[27:05] They they're seemingly just random and sporadic and so

[27:11] That's just where we're at in pinball

[27:13] You know these games used to sync up more with the hot properties of the day

[27:17] And and I think that isn't always the case now

[27:21] What else is going on in pinball? You know, I mean, that's just like where how I feel like wouldn't it be awesome if toy story

[27:27] The pinball machine came out at the same time as toy story four

[27:31] Wouldn't that be great wouldn't it be great if we got I don't know

[27:35] It's the 25th anniversary of Jurassic Park

[27:38] So I think it would make much more sense to have a 25th anniversary Jurassic Park game

[27:43] Come out from stern and you know what they need to reduce Star Wars

[27:46] I'm just gonna say it. They need to make a Star Wars pin. That's worthy of that of that franchise

[27:52] And Harry Potter just just to clarify for all of you

[27:56] Harry Potter is not happening

[27:59] Jersey Jack pinball does not have the Harry Potter license. They don't have it

[28:05] I wish Jack would just come out and say that they do not have it stern does not have Harry Potter either

[28:12] It's not happening anytime soon. So everybody remove Harry Potter from your list of games you think is happening soon

[28:19] All right, it's not happening. It's just not happening. All right

[28:23] What else is going on?

[28:25] Let's see we haven't had any more fallout from the Twippies

[28:28] I think everyone who's watched the show is really enjoyed it

[28:31] It was a great show. I have fond memories of being there a week ago

[28:36] Awesome time awesome time. It's amazing how much

[28:39] You know how much happens in a week in pinball

[28:42] We've got a new title from stern already. All right, so here's the deal. I can't wait to see when

[28:47] Black Knight is going to be flipped. I hope it is soon

[28:51] I think people are going to really enjoy the game the Ellie's are not sold out on it. You can still get an Ellie of the game

[28:59] I do think you need to flip the game though. I mean come on guy

[29:01] They're worth the point now where you have to play these games. You have to play these games

[29:07] There's no you you can't even be like an Ellie collector anymore

[29:11] You just can't because at the pace at which stern is going the person who's gonna get clobbered is you like

[29:17] Like I feel so bad you know, we know which guy I feel so bad for is frolic

[29:22] It's like he bought every single stern Ellie over like a two to three year period

[29:27] When they were making games like WWE and like Mustang and like he's all in on like DMD error

[29:34] You know elis of stern like he got like a vendures. I think he got he got like it was like every single Ellie

[29:39] He was there with like the thumbs up and it's like I don't know for those guys who were just like the Ellie buyers

[29:45] I I mean what do you say to these guys? They're gonna be like in therapy soon because

[29:50] There is just stupid now. It's just it literally is getting dumb that all of these Ellie's just come out one on top of another and like

[29:57] Three stern Ellie's three stern Ellie's if you just going on three of them

[30:02] Throughout a year you're spending twenty seven thousand dollars on pinball machines. They're not even special

[30:09] I mean that like the experience is not special

[30:11] There's nothing different about your pinball experience than it is about the premium guy

[30:17] Which is not that much cheaper, you know three premiums is is white like let's see

[30:23] 21,000 dollars plus 15 and 22,500 dollars to buy three stern premiums

[30:30] These are expensive machines

[30:33] I'm all about waiting and waiting for something that is truly magical

[30:38] I need a game that really just blows me away and I have to say last year that just wasn't that game

[30:44] I think iron maiden came close

[30:46] But I look at iron maiden and I get you guys love it

[30:49] I get the Tony guys love it. I get the rules are great. I get the artwork is great

[30:54] I get that you know all that stuff. I get it's an fresh original layout from Keith

[30:59] But I look at iron maiden and I'm just you know

[31:01] I'm all about the ball doesn't really do anything like magical in it

[31:07] There's not like a toy or a gimmick and iron maiden that has a wow factor to it that games all about flow

[31:13] That game is a flow and a rule set like an artwork like juggernaut like people love it because of that and I get it

[31:21] I think the game shoots so awesome

[31:23] It's one of the most original layouts we've ever seen stern do and it shoots incredibly well

[31:28] But when it comes to like wow or magic and doesn't have it it doesn't have it. It doesn't have it

[31:34] This black knight is the most impressive mechanism. We've seen stern do in a long time

[31:39] And I can't wait to shoot it. It looks fun to battle that night

[31:42] Oh, but man, man, I mean I but I still like I'm like I still want more like I'm greedy like I still want something that has more

[31:49] What I really want what I really really really want is I want a game like dialed in that actually moves me

[31:58] I want a game like dialed in that I actually enjoy and have fun playing like dialed into me

[32:03] Is exactly what I want a modern pinball machine to be but I don't want it to be fucking boring like dialed in

[32:10] If you know what to me would be the dream here here's to me like this would be like the greatest pinball machine ever

[32:16] If I could combine

[32:18] Dialed in with ghost busters, right if I could just push two machines together

[32:23] If we could have ghost busters be built the way dialed in was built, right?

[32:29] It would be so awesome

[32:30] It would be the best thing ever with the big screen with clips from the movie if with the modern sound system

[32:37] If we could somehow morph those two games together no stupid flipper gap no balls jumping over the out lanes

[32:45] You know no pedophile designer

[32:47] You know zombie Yeti artwork with a jersey jack ghost busters game and I would just be like you know what?

[32:54] I'm happy for the rest of my life with this game

[32:57] I think that would be the most incredible game and that's what I'm waiting for and that's what I'm hoping Willy Wonka is

[33:03] I hope it's a dream theme

[33:06] Based on a classic movie

[33:08] Dun by Pat Lawler with with mechanisms that are magical

[33:13] Umpa lumpas, you know chocolate factory golden ticket never ending gobstopper is that a guy?

[33:19] Is that the name of the damn thing all the different elements of Willy Wonka the magical elevator visiting the chocolate factory

[33:26] You know if jersey jack does not does not find a way to hide

[33:32] Five golden tickets in Willy Wonka machines and if you get one

[33:37] You get a airline ticket to visit the jersey jack factoring your game is special like he really should

[33:44] Of had a promotion in which only five people get a special

[33:50] Golden edition of the game like think about that that's marketing

[33:54] A golden edition Willy Wonka game one of five made by jersey jack pinball and everyone can enter a lottery

[34:03] In which they win a chance to be selected to be able to buy one of those games

[34:08] And here's why jack should have done that

[34:10] Imagine if jersey jack makes

[34:12] Five golden ticket edition games he could charge

[34:17] $20,000 for each of them right shiny gold foil like cabinet the thing should bling from a mile

[34:24] Way he could charge $25,000 for it and guess what people would be beating themselves up to win the right to buy one

[34:34] And think about that all he would have to do is have a beautiful different like art package on it

[34:41] And he could charge $25,000 and those games would skyrocket in demand because everyone would want to have a golden ticket edition

[34:50] And he's not going to do it because he doesn't have canada on his marketing team

[34:55] And I keep telling jack talk to me

[34:58] There's a reason why I give ideas to the biggest most iconic brands in the world

[35:04] And I charge hundreds of dollars an hour for my time

[35:08] And yet I would happily give them these kinds of ideas for free because think about that that would make jack a lot of money

[35:15] For nothing

[35:16] And it's just again, it's just that's how it should be you could use that much money to go higher scott denisi

[35:22] You could use that much money to probably go steal lime and sheets away from stern pimple

[35:26] They don't think like this

[35:28] They just don't get it when you have an iconic brand like wankha

[35:33] You need to do iconic stuff with your marketing and get really creative

[35:37] There are so many multi-millionaires that can't wait

[35:41] These are guys who are trying to buy $25,000 or big lebousies that are going to break in a second

[35:47] There's no there's nothing being given to these gentlemen

[35:50] Look at beetles diamond for freak sakes like that thing was a joke

[35:54] And yet people they sold them I talked to coin taker they sold to at $25,000

[35:59] I don't know who those morons are

[36:01] But here I'm in Miami and you go down millionaires row and if that guy's into the beetles

[36:06] What's $25,000 for one of 100 machine

[36:10] I went into an art gallery you know that alic monopoly dude

[36:13] He's got a boba fit with a Gucci logo on the forehead

[36:16] How much is that painting one of one sixty seven thousand dollars for a piece of canvas

[36:22] That looks like a third grader could paint it sixty seven thousand dollars

[36:27] I think these pinball companies all need to wake up and realize

[36:30] If they make special versions there are going to be people lining up to buy them

[36:36] And yes guys like rare here will hate on those crazy rich bastards who want them

[36:41] But they're though they would want them a shiny gold foiled

[36:45] Willy Wonka you know golden ticket edition game would sell for $25,000 in a heartbeat

[36:51] I already know like three guys that would want to buy it immediately

[36:54] Immediately and yet there's probably a hundred of those kind of collectors out there

[36:58] And you make five of them you can have a bidding war like no other

[37:01] Everyone can they just pinball podcasts we got to go back to the masseuse

[37:05] I'm gonna get rubbed down and then I'm gonna go have a great dinner

[37:08] And then I'm gonna go have some cocktails and then I'm gonna let you listen to this podcast and say you know what

[37:14] Canada knows what he's talking about

[37:16] Twippy
