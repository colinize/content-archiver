[00:00] All right, Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:04] We're a few minutes late.

[00:06] We're a few minutes late, but that's what happens when you got a little baby kill, baby

[00:09] kill, and Brenda headed out, going to Whole Foods, giving it Canada a little bit of time

[00:16] to do a Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:17] I'm going to go turn that light off.

[00:19] Hold on a second.

[00:20] I'll be right back.

[00:21] It's cause and a glare.

[00:22] It's cause and a glare.

[00:23] We want to make sure you guys have the best Saturday morning ever.

[00:26] Boom.

[00:27] All right.

[00:28] We're in a good mood.

[00:29] We don't even need any coffee today.

[00:30] We're going to talk all about pinball, everybody in the house.

[00:39] Oh, we got Jeff in the house.

[00:41] Let's do our means in the house.

[00:42] Who's in the house?

[00:43] Come on.

[00:44] Say hi.

[00:45] I'll say hi back.

[00:46] Let's do this.

[00:47] We got Jason in the house.

[00:48] We got Michael M. L. Huntsman in the house.

[00:52] Javier.

[00:53] Hello from Barcelona.

[00:56] Barcelona is in the house.

[00:58] Brian Koss is in the house.

[01:00] He's got those 10 stars.

[01:01] Ready?

[01:02] Ready?

[01:03] What's up, Wabbit?

[01:04] We're going to talk Looney Tunes.

[01:05] What's up, Dion?

[01:06] Dave is in the house.

[01:09] We've already got more people than Don's Pinball Podcast in the first three minutes of the

[01:13] show.

[01:14] What's up, Jacob?

[01:15] Brad?

[01:16] What's up, brother?

[01:17] Oh, Dennis Kendall.

[01:20] Can't start without Dennis.

[01:23] Got my coffee?

[01:26] Jay Seller's in the his house.

[01:28] What's Canada going to say?

[01:30] Get the lawyers ready.

[01:32] Get the formal requests ready.

[01:34] Warren's in the house.

[01:36] Patrick's in the house.

[01:39] Ah, Dan, what's up, brother?

[01:42] We've been waiting all week for this.

[01:44] I've been waiting all week for this.

[01:47] We're going to have a great Saturday morning spectacular.

[01:50] What's under your hat?

[01:51] My little Kendall saw Barbie yesterday.

[01:54] We'll talk a little bit about that.

[01:58] Anthony, what's up, brother?

[01:59] Look, it's been an exciting few weeks in Pinball.

[02:03] We've got a lot to talk about.

[02:06] There's nowhere to leave stars.

[02:07] Is the stars gone?

[02:10] Is there nowhere to leave stars?

[02:11] Can anyone see the star button?

[02:13] Say yes or no.

[02:14] Does anyone see how to contribute stars on this episode?

[02:17] Do I need to update my Facebook?

[02:20] I spam the Pinball world.

[02:24] I spam the Pinball world with my free episode today.

[02:28] If you're not a Canada Club member, good news today.

[02:31] You can go listen to.

[02:34] Go to Canada Pinball podcast Patreon.

[02:38] And you can hear the last episode for free.

[02:42] Now, look, as I said, wasn't sure I

[02:45] wanted to do another run for the Twippies.

[02:47] But I might as well just upload five.

[02:50] And I'm only going to do five.

[02:53] I'm going to do the thank you for the 10 stars, Dave.

[02:55] The bare minimum of free episodes in 2023,

[03:00] just to be eligible.

[03:02] As I've said before, though, I still

[03:03] think they should just give me the Lifetime Achievement

[03:06] Award for Pinball podcasting.

[03:07] At this point, we've got it down.

[03:08] There was science at this point.

[03:10] We're not editing at this point.

[03:11] We don't even need sound clips.

[03:12] We don't need co-hosts.

[03:13] We don't need interviews.

[03:14] We don't need lap tracks.

[03:15] We don't need segments.

[03:16] We don't need anything.

[03:18] We just say in 15 seconds, welcome to Canada's Pinball

[03:22] podcast.

[03:23] And we hit the ground running.

[03:25] We hit the ground running.

[03:27] Oh, other shows, it's like a half hour warm up into the topics.

[03:33] By the time other shows warm up, we're done.

[03:37] We're done.

[03:38] We've talked about the Pinball news and the stuff

[03:40] happening, and it's all good.

[03:42] Everybody does it their own way.

[03:44] Did you hear?

[03:45] Did that hat not fit properly?

[03:47] Oh, look, people talking smack about my hat, my pink Barbie

[03:51] bandana.

[03:52] I love it.

[03:53] I'm very confident in this Ken.

[03:55] This Ken is a Pinball podcaster.

[03:58] Very confident in myself, as you can tell.

[04:01] I dress how I would like to dress.

[04:05] I don't care what anybody says.

[04:08] OK.

[04:09] Rage quit over and over.

[04:13] All right.

[04:13] Let's talk about the Pinball pause.

[04:17] We'll talk about Venom.

[04:19] I would like to hear from somebody.

[04:21] Has anybody who's currently on the show right now with us,

[04:26] has anybody here played Venom at the Southern Fried Gaming

[04:31] Expo?

[04:33] And if anybody's at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo,

[04:36] maybe we go live in a little bit and have a little walk

[04:40] around, and we can have people curse out Canada.

[04:43] We know everybody loves Canada.

[04:45] I saw the big Venom blow up, little awkward looking thing,

[04:48] like you're walking into Venom's mouth.

[04:50] I know they've got a bunch of games there from Marco.

[04:53] It's almost August.

[04:55] You got about a couple months before this game really

[04:57] goes on the line.

[04:58] There's going to be the switchover of the Stern factory.

[05:02] I think we're going to get more and more reviews from Venom.

[05:04] From what I've been hearing from people about Venom,

[05:07] is the game is very fast.

[05:09] It doesn't really have that many mechanisms

[05:11] or impressive mechanisms.

[05:13] That's what I've heard.

[05:14] In the toy department, it's shallow.

[05:17] In the speed department, it's fast.

[05:20] And the shots are pretty easy fan layout.

[05:22] So that's why I think they're going really deep on the code,

[05:27] is they need to make up for some of the maybe physical

[05:30] limitations of the game.

[05:32] So they're going to put a lot into the code.

[05:35] You know, look, at $13,000 for an LE, at $10,000 for a premium,

[05:39] at $7,000 for a pro, you know, we've

[05:43] got to be a lot in these games.

[05:45] We're going to talk about that.

[05:46] The TNT twins are there.

[05:48] I love the twins.

[05:49] They're like my muscle when I go to pinball shows.

[05:52] It's like NWO, Canada and the twins.

[05:54] It's just too sweet.

[05:59] I'm in such a good mood.

[06:02] I think I'd let you guys know, nice just

[06:04] to be on good terms with Jason Knapp,

[06:07] not saying anything derogatory about the man ever again.

[06:12] When I do rumors, and he said it, I hope

[06:15] he includes my rumors into some of his coverage.

[06:19] I probably have a little bit more of a track record

[06:21] than random Reddit guys.

[06:23] We're going to talk about John Wick.

[06:25] We're going to talk about spooky rumors.

[06:26] We're going to talk about American pinball,

[06:28] probably having He-Man.

[06:30] Let's go around the horn.

[06:31] How's that sound?

[06:32] Everybody down for that?

[06:33] You guys down for dancing with Canada right now for 90

[06:36] minutes.

[06:37] Get your stars ready, people.

[06:40] Get your stars ready.

[06:42] The world's favorite pinball podcast,

[06:44] Six Years in a Row.

[06:45] It's just $5 a month.

[06:47] No inflation.

[06:49] Just satisfaction.

[06:52] OK.

[06:55] Ah, let's start with Stern.

[07:01] Let's start with Stern.

[07:03] Big rumor, John Wick.

[07:05] It's not a rumor anymore.

[07:07] It's happening.

[07:08] Stern is making John Wick.

[07:10] They've been making it.

[07:12] John Borg, I believe, is making it.

[07:15] He's been working on it since he finished Rush.

[07:19] Now remember, these designers finished the design of a game

[07:25] easily months before the game even is revealed.

[07:29] So he's been working on John Wick I've

[07:31] heard for almost two years.

[07:37] John Wick.

[07:40] I like it.

[07:42] I like it because it's contemporary, because it's new,

[07:46] because it's badass.

[07:48] Now look, there are some things you're going to need if you

[07:52] make a John Wick pinball machine.

[07:54] You're going to need the assets from the movie.

[07:58] You're going to need the call-outs from Winston, from

[08:02] John, from whatever Larry Fishburne's character is, the

[08:06] boogie man, the Russian mobsters.

[08:09] You need all of that, because the one-liners, especially

[08:13] Keanu's lines, those drive the narrative of the movie.

[08:18] I also think they're going to need bright neon lights.

[08:21] Thank you, Jacob.

[08:22] I think they're going to need this, the Mustang.

[08:24] I think they're going to need the Continental, the

[08:29] Hotelfront.

[08:29] You're going to have to get the balls into the Continental.

[08:32] I was trying to think about it, too.

[08:33] You know how when you go into the Continental, you can't

[08:40] fight in the Continental?

[08:42] They need to have a mode in the game in which you enter the

[08:47] Continental, and there's no scoring that can happen.

[08:51] Wouldn't that be cool?

[08:54] Just something where it's a unique mode, or when you get

[08:57] into the Continental, you can't fight.

[09:00] You can't attack up points, because everything's got to

[09:03] be more just socializing.

[09:07] So I don't know.

[09:08] There's some interesting things that could happen there.

[09:11] I think what's perfect for this game is this.

[09:16] In the world of John Wick, they put a bounty out as the

[09:20] price to kill the different hitmen.

[09:23] I mean, there you go.

[09:24] That's your scoring.

[09:26] I mean, wouldn't it make total sense to your John Wick, and

[09:32] you have money that you can earn for taking out some of the

[09:35] other hitmen?

[09:36] Maybe you do it like that.

[09:38] That's not quite.

[09:38] Usually it's all about the bounty that's on John Wick's

[09:42] head, is what they focus on in the movies.

[09:46] But in terms of the environment, and in terms of the

[09:48] lighting, and the music, and the action, John Wick to me.

[09:52] See, it's weird, because John Wick should have the speed of

[09:55] a game like Venom.

[09:56] I don't really, when I think of Venom, I don't know why

[09:59] Venom would be a fast game, per se.

[10:01] I would expect Venom to have more toys like Spider-Man.

[10:05] But as I've said always, people, now that we know it's

[10:09] going to be Venom into Jaws, I think we might see Jaws

[10:15] revealed at the end of the year with manufacturing

[10:20] happening in February, or they might just reveal it in

[10:23] February.

[10:24] It's going to go Venom, it's going to go Jaws, it's going

[10:27] to go John Wick.

[10:29] And I think that's going to be the next three games from

[10:32] Stern.

[10:33] And then after that, we're going to get the next game

[10:36] from, let's see, we just got Brian Eddy, we're going to

[10:39] get Keith Elwyn, then we're going to get John Borg, and

[10:42] then we're going to get Jack Danger.

[10:44] And so I think that's going to be the, now, if you think

[10:49] about Stern's track record, I think we might get another

[10:54] music pin from Jack Danger, because wouldn't, you know,

[10:57] normally Stern mixes music into the fold.

[11:01] And so the rumored music pins that Stern might have, they

[11:05] don't need to do a vault addition of anything.

[11:07] I, you know, we always talk about Stern vaults, and if

[11:12] they're going to vault anything, I think they're going to

[11:14] vault Metallica, or they're going to vault, like, they'll

[11:18] bring back stranger things.

[11:20] I don't think it's going to be a vault.

[11:21] I think they're just going to announce they're making more

[11:23] stranger things premiums.

[11:26] But I don't think we're going to see, like, a vault vault.

[11:29] We might see, like, a small anniversary run of Jurassic

[11:34] Park, you know, the 30th anniversary of Jurassic Park.

[11:37] I could see that.

[11:39] I could see a small anniversary run.

[11:41] I don't think they're going to do Ghostbusters.

[11:44] But I think we know it's coming from Stern.

[11:47] And this is why waiting and seeing in the great pinball

[11:51] pause, it makes total sense.

[11:53] Like, you can go now, two day, and you can buy a Foo Fighter

[11:58] LE from a distributor for $12,999.

[12:05] And if you wait it, now you know, like, oh, do I want

[12:08] Foo Fighters?

[12:09] Should I wait for Jaws?

[12:11] Maybe John Wick is more my speed.

[12:13] And the more time you wait, the lower in price Foo Fighters

[12:18] is going to go.

[12:20] The lower in price everything is going to become.

[12:23] The games are all inflated.

[12:24] Everybody feels it.

[12:26] Everybody can sense it.

[12:27] Everyone, you know, everyone is feeling like, man, it's

[12:32] really hard to put a venom next to the big Lebowski and be

[12:37] like, these games are the same price.

[12:39] I mean, just, and big Lebowski is like 10 years old.

[12:44] But you know, we're, and we're never going to stop looking

[12:48] at this hobby as a discussion of enjoyment versus value.

[12:53] Right?

[12:54] You see, Stern doesn't want you to have the conversation be

[12:57] about the value.

[12:58] They want you to just focus on the enjoyment.

[13:00] Again, Josh Sharp said to me, I think it was Josh Sharp.

[13:03] You see, who's the one over at Stern?

[13:05] If a game is fun, the value is the same.

[13:07] If a game is fun, the value is irrelevant.

[13:11] I don't agree with that.

[13:13] I fundamentally do not agree with that.

[13:17] I don't think that's how anybody lives by that mantra.

[13:23] Because if a car is fun, is the price of it irrelevant?

[13:29] If a watch tells time, is the value of it irrelevant?

[13:32] If a, you know, if something, if a water slide is fun,

[13:37] like does the price of admission into the water park not matter?

[13:41] Of course, everybody, all of us, no matter what it is,

[13:46] we say like, do I think this hat is worth this much money?

[13:50] How much is it worth to me?

[13:52] Now the thing that's crippling, I think, the pinball

[13:55] industry right now, or is going to continue to cripple it,

[13:59] is every manufacturer now has determined

[14:03] that their games are worth the price that games would be worth

[14:07] if they were deemed to be masterpieces and super sought

[14:12] after by the community.

[14:14] That's when a game would creep up to be worth $13,000 or $15,000.

[14:19] Stupid now that regardless of a game's ability to be priced

[14:24] by the market or by its own merit,

[14:27] these companies have decided to price these games

[14:30] at this high level.

[14:32] And like nobody's going to notice,

[14:35] nobody's going to say anything, nobody's going to pause,

[14:39] the great pinball pause, and stop running

[14:42] at every single new game.

[14:44] And if you wait, you'll have way more options,

[14:48] and you'll be able to like not feel bad because you chased

[14:51] after the hype and the FOMO.

[14:54] You know, my friend Derek, he bought Godfather LE,

[14:56] a new inbox, and I'm like, dude, that's a stupid move.

[14:59] He basically could have got the same game for $2,000 less.

[15:05] At the same time he bought his game,

[15:07] Godfather LE's have tanked in value already.

[15:12] They will soon be selling for $9,500.

[15:16] And then they're going to sell for $8,500.

[15:19] And then we're going to see Godfather CE sell for like $15,000.

[15:24] It's just going to keep going like that.

[15:26] We all know it.

[15:29] The moment I start talking about these companies,

[15:31] like 10 more people join, you see that?

[15:33] You notice that?

[15:34] Like 10 people just join.

[15:35] It's like he's talking about the market,

[15:39] all the distributors join right now.

[15:42] I wouldn't want to be a distributor right now.

[15:44] I wouldn't.

[15:45] I don't understand if you're a distributor right now.

[15:49] I don't understand what the margins are,

[15:52] but I don't understand how you would gauge,

[15:56] how to stock your inventory, if you will.

[16:05] Checks, Nathler, Kidd, some things were said at Comic-Con.

[16:14] Stocking inventory must be really tricky right now

[16:16] for distributors across the board,

[16:18] because Stern doesn't care about selling to you

[16:22] or me.

[16:24] Stern doesn't care about us as customers,

[16:27] because we're not their customers.

[16:30] Their customers are their distributors.

[16:33] And for the golden years, distributors

[16:38] couldn't keep games in stock.

[16:40] LVs were sold out like that.

[16:42] Premiums were flying off the shelf.

[16:44] And pros were super affordable, and people were gobbling them

[16:47] up.

[16:48] Nowadays, like, LE sales are going to slow at 1,000

[16:58] at this much money.

[16:59] Then the price of man is gone.

[17:01] It's a hard thing to stock up premiums now, really hard.

[17:08] We're going to start to see more and more sales.

[17:10] Here's the thing, though.

[17:11] If you think, I know this is another argument,

[17:15] but the difference between a pinball distributor

[17:18] and a car dealership, both of those entities,

[17:23] they get the product from the manufacturer.

[17:27] They then sell it to a customer.

[17:30] They're the middleman that generates the sales.

[17:33] The problem in pinball is if I'm a distributor

[17:36] and I sell you an LE or a premium,

[17:38] I can only make money on that initial sale.

[17:43] A car dealership makes all of its money

[17:45] in the service department.

[17:47] So that's why they just want to get as many cars

[17:52] into customer hands, because they're

[17:53] going to make their money on servicing the car for you

[17:56] over the ownership of that car.

[17:59] But a pinball dealership doesn't make any money

[18:02] on continued servicing of the games.

[18:04] In fact, they lose money when they

[18:07] have to do service calls under warranty on stuff with the game.

[18:12] It's got to be a difficult thing to navigate.

[18:18] All right.

[18:21] So we got John Wick.

[18:23] We've got Venom.

[18:24] Has anybody here played Venom?

[18:28] Has anybody here played Venom?

[18:33] Does anyone want to come on the show right now

[18:35] and talk about how Venom was?

[18:38] Topper's service department.

[18:41] Anybody at Southern Fried Gaming Expo?

[18:48] Well, you know who makes the most money is pinball life.

[18:51] Like Terry at Pinball Life, he's got the best gig going.

[18:55] Because not only does he sell the parts at probably

[18:59] a decent margin, pinball life supplies parts to pinball

[19:04] manufacturers.

[19:06] That's the smart business, because Terry's business is

[19:10] a business of scale.

[19:12] And he's got customers that have a lot of money.

[19:18] Customers who are manufacturers, customers who are just

[19:20] pinball fans, customers who are operators.

[19:23] Like everybody's a potential customer of Terry at Pinball

[19:26] Life.

[19:27] I would say like out of all the people in the pinball world,

[19:31] I bet Terry is probably making the most money

[19:35] as a private business within the pinball space

[19:39] next to the manufacturers and the leaders of those companies.

[19:43] Super smart guy.

[19:45] And look, he earned it.

[19:45] Like, pinball life earns it.

[19:47] It's amazing how many parts they have, how they organize it

[19:53] all.

[19:53] The website is great.

[19:56] I don't begrudge anybody.

[19:57] Being in the right place at the right time with the right

[20:00] value offer, super smart, absolutely deserves it.

[20:05] Unlike these guys that are probably selling you

[20:09] copy infringement banners for 150 books.

[20:14] I mean, I would love to sell you banners for Foo Fighters and

[20:19] Chicago Gaming Company and not be officially licensed

[20:22] banners for that much money.

[20:25] And then people hem and haw about spending $60 a year for a

[20:30] pinball podcast in which I make two episodes every single

[20:33] week all year.

[20:35] Long people.

[20:36] There's no time off on this show.

[20:41] But now I'm super happy.

[20:42] I want to thank each and every one of you who's a member of

[20:44] the Canada Club.

[20:45] We're at 608 club members, which is great.

[20:48] We're holding really strong.

[20:50] Nobody's even nearly close to what we've done.

[20:53] Nobody's even knocking on our door.

[20:56] And it's fun to see all the other podcasters turn on

[21:00] Patreon as they should have from the very beginning.

[21:03] But there's still not one of them who is following in

[21:08] Canada's footsteps, which is simply this.

[21:11] You've got to make the entire show behind the paywall if

[21:16] you want to actually get a large audience.

[21:21] And you've got to charge, don't charge more than five bucks.

[21:25] If anyone gives more than $5, and there's many of you who

[21:29] do as well, I think I have over 50 or so people that

[21:33] donate more than $5.

[21:35] It's greatly appreciated.

[21:38] And those individuals know who they are.

[21:39] And many of them don't like me giving them shout outs,

[21:42] because they just kind of like to silently be very generous.

[21:45] All right, let's keep going through the

[21:46] pinball companies.

[21:47] So we know what's happening at Stern.

[21:49] Look, I think Venom sales are never going to be that great.

[21:52] I think Venom is going to be a title that does OK.

[21:55] I think Venom buyers are going to do everything they can to

[21:58] justify their purchases.

[22:00] I also think people, if you just bought a Foo Fighters, it's

[22:04] got beautiful zombie-eddy artwork.

[22:06] Venom has beautiful zombie-eddy artwork.

[22:09] But I do think a lot of people are kind of like just

[22:12] waiting this one out.

[22:13] I think everybody knows if you want to Venom, you'll always

[22:16] be able to get one.

[22:17] Rushing into Venom now doesn't seem to make much sense.

[22:21] They're not even making them for like two months.

[22:23] And so I think a lot of you who are curious about Venom will

[22:27] play it on location.

[22:29] You'll play it at shows.

[22:30] And maybe you'll dabble in it.

[22:32] But the truth is this, you're all waiting for Keith

[22:35] Elwin's next pinball machine.

[22:38] And at these prices, who wouldn't?

[22:41] Who wouldn't be waiting for what Keith Elwin has around the

[22:44] corner?

[22:45] I mean, Keith Elwin, Jaws, Randy Martinez, I think that's

[22:50] going to happen.

[22:51] I really do think that's going to happen.

[22:53] And I think Jaws is going to be, I think it's going to be

[22:56] spectacular.

[22:58] I think you're going to see, I think Kamnikow might be a

[23:00] part of it.

[23:02] And I think it's an exciting time in pinball.

[23:05] And as I've said, it's fun to wait.

[23:09] Gang, isn't it fun not writing checks for games you're not

[23:14] really sure about, or you know you don't really, really want?

[23:17] But even though you have the itch for new pinball, if you

[23:20] just let those two weeks of this, think about it.

[23:25] Whenever a new pinball machine comes out, we get spammed by

[23:29] distributors convincing us that we need it.

[23:32] And if you just don't give in to that spam and you just

[23:36] wait it out, look what happens.

[23:39] You'll feel better.

[23:41] You'll still be able to get to game when it's made.

[23:43] But they want to lock your money in now.

[23:45] You know why distributors want to lock your money in in

[23:48] like July, August?

[23:49] Because they sent money to stern.

[23:52] They want you to remove their risk from this proposition.

[23:57] Why would you do that?

[23:59] As a customer, why would you do that?

[24:03] You'll be able to get to game.

[24:05] There are so many distributors out there.

[24:08] You're not going to struggle to get one.

[24:11] They want you to remove there.

[24:12] Why would you do that?

[24:14] Do you wake up to remove your distributors risk?

[24:16] No.

[24:17] And the thing is this, these companies at some point need

[24:20] to be told a lesson that what happens in a world in which

[24:24] consumers are not going to alleviate the distro risks

[24:28] from buying games.

[24:29] I mean, right now, if you're a distributor with Jersey Jack

[24:32] Pinball, let's talk about JJP next.

[24:35] OK, so let's talk about JJP and then we'll talk about

[24:37] this whole thing.

[24:37] So Jersey Jack, they are getting Godfather's two

[24:41] customers.

[24:42] They're getting the CE two customers.

[24:45] Here's the thing.

[24:47] We saw the picture of Godfather in a bathroom in Germany.

[24:52] Now I can't tell you how many people privately, not

[24:54] publicly, privately hit me up, hey, man, that's where the

[24:59] game belongs in a bathroom.

[25:01] I don't think any game belongs in a bathroom, people.

[25:04] I don't understand that move.

[25:06] It's disgusting.

[25:08] People are going to be touching their units and then

[25:11] jumping on a pinball machine.

[25:13] Why would anybody want to play a pinball machine in a

[25:15] bathroom?

[25:16] And also, don't you want to get people out of the bathroom?

[25:19] I get the joke that Michael Corleone went into a bathroom

[25:23] to get the gun, to kill the police commissioner, right?

[25:27] But come on, come on.

[25:30] That's disgusting, Germany.

[25:32] No.

[25:33] The fact that there's Godfather's, though, in

[25:36] bathrooms in Germany and there's not a single Godfather on

[25:40] location in New York City where the Godfather takes place,

[25:45] Jersey Jack marketing.

[25:47] Put a Godfather in the freaking city where the

[25:53] Godfather takes place.

[25:56] You know what's crazy about pinball marketing?

[25:58] They don't even try.

[26:01] They don't even try.

[26:02] If I were Ken Cromwell or I were Jersey Jack marketing, you

[26:06] know what I would do?

[26:08] You want to get orders, guys?

[26:10] Do you want to think creatively?

[26:11] Don't put a $12,000 or $15,000 pinball machine in a dive bar

[26:19] barcade.

[26:22] Go to Wall Street or go to Midtown Park Avenue in those

[26:28] buildings, contact building management, say, hey, look, we

[26:32] would like to put on display as a little roving art exhibit.

[26:37] Our pinball machine's in your lobby.

[26:39] So all of the people inside that building who make six,

[26:44] seven figures a year could come down.

[26:48] And for one month, you do a traveling pinball arcade and

[26:53] you can basically sample your product for people who could

[26:58] buy pins at those prices like that.

[27:02] And they would.

[27:03] Because those dudes are rocking $100,000 watches.

[27:07] It's all over.

[27:08] Park Avenue North and Wall Street.

[27:11] And the godfather would speak to those kinds of boiler room

[27:16] kind of dudes who just want something cool and fancy.

[27:20] I don't know.

[27:21] It's just something I would try.

[27:24] They keep trying to sell the same thing to the same people.

[27:27] And eventually, you're just going to get

[27:29] two diminishing returns.

[27:31] But again, just try something new.

[27:34] And those guys with money, they don't want to go to pinball

[27:38] expo.

[27:40] They don't want to go to Texas Pinball Festival.

[27:43] I mean, it's just you got to broaden your horizons with the

[27:47] marketing.

[27:49] And they don't want to be spammed on Facebook.

[27:52] It's a very experiential thing.

[27:54] You'll never see the value of godfather pinball unless you

[27:59] stand over it in person.

[28:01] OK?

[28:03] It's the truth.

[28:04] But godfather sales are done.

[28:07] They know it.

[28:08] I know it.

[28:09] You know it.

[28:09] Nobody's buying godfather LEs.

[28:11] They're sitting at distributors, new in box.

[28:14] Distributors are starting to offer them for less than $12,000

[28:17] backdoor deals people.

[28:18] Here they come.

[28:20] Look, I started talking about all of a sudden 10 new people

[28:22] joining.

[28:22] This is what happens.

[28:24] Godfather LE sales are done.

[28:26] The CEs are trickling out.

[28:29] Are they going to make all 1,000 CEs?

[28:31] I don't think so.

[28:33] But I think CEs sales are also going to go south.

[28:37] The game is what it is.

[28:41] I wish I could play it more.

[28:44] Nothing that I experienced in gameplay, though, would ever

[28:48] make me spend this kind of money on it because of the

[28:50] theme, because of the community's response to it.

[28:54] It is like purchasing a falling knife, and they know it.

[28:58] And this was the final game that was developed under the

[29:01] reign of Pat Lawlor.

[29:02] I think a lot of people don't want to admit that, but this

[29:06] game was a Jack Guinari theme.

[29:10] And I want to ask this question.

[29:13] At what point does Jack Guinari become held accountable for?

[29:18] He's the guy that picks the themes.

[29:21] So he picked Toy Story 4.

[29:24] Knowing he could only do 4, he said, we'll take it.

[29:28] He wanted the Godfather.

[29:30] Do you think Eric Minier wanted the Godfather?

[29:37] Do you think Brett Abbas wanted the Godfather?

[29:39] Ken Cromwell wanted the Godfather?

[29:42] Jack Guinari wanted the Godfather.

[29:47] And that was a marketing decision.

[29:50] And so now we've witnessed, and I know I always try to kind

[29:53] of find correlations between what I do in marketing and

[29:56] pinball.

[29:57] This is a great example of what can go wrong when you both do.

[30:02] I mean, it's a triple storm for them.

[30:05] You get the theme wrong.

[30:07] Then you don't put much into the games that wow people.

[30:11] Then you charge the most you've ever charged for pinball.

[30:14] Those are three marketing decisions.

[30:16] I mean, one's a design decision, but on some level,

[30:20] those things happened.

[30:22] We all witnessed it.

[30:24] So Godfather to me is like yesterday's news.

[30:29] They're never going to get excitement going for the

[30:31] pinball machine.

[30:33] I don't care how beautiful the artwork is or how amazing the

[30:37] topper is.

[30:37] It's just never going to have a second life.

[30:42] And it's not going to have a pirate to the Caribbean

[30:44] moment either, because they're going to end up making way

[30:47] more than 1,000 of them.

[30:48] And they're going to sit and collect dust, which leads us

[30:53] to the next question.

[30:56] What's next from Jersey Jack Pinball?

[30:58] And when will they bring it out?

[31:00] It's going to be Elton John.

[31:04] It is most likely going to have Christopher

[31:05] Franci on artwork.

[31:08] If it wasn't Christopher Franci on artwork, he would

[31:11] normally come out and say he's not doing Elton John.

[31:15] So let's see if he comes out and says that.

[31:17] It's going to be Steve Ritchie's Elton John versus

[31:21] John Wick.

[31:23] I mean, look, I love Elton John music.

[31:27] A lot of Elton John music is high energy and might fit in

[31:31] pinball format.

[31:33] But it just doesn't feel like Jersey Jack's Elton John is

[31:39] going to be able to compete with Steve.

[31:42] Sorry, Steve Ritchie's Elton John from Jersey Jack will

[31:45] not be able to compete with Keith Elwin's

[31:47] Jaws from Stern.

[31:49] I mean, that's going to be the battleground.

[31:52] A great white shark, Steven Spielberg's best movie,

[31:56] we'll see what they get asset wise.

[31:59] But we're going to see Elton John versus Jaws.

[32:06] I think we all know if anyone wants to come in here, we have

[32:12] 100 people watching right now.

[32:13] Isn't it interesting the moment I start to poke some of

[32:16] these companies a little bit, all of a sudden we get

[32:19] like 100 people watching.

[32:20] So if anyone wants to speak live now in

[32:23] defense of Jersey Jack, speak now.

[32:27] Are you there, Jersey Jack?

[32:29] Do you have a representative?

[32:31] Would you like to join the show and explain to everybody

[32:34] watching right now why they should give this

[32:38] product a chance?

[32:39] The floor is all yours.

[32:45] Well, I think they know Robert Jaws is going to be so popular.

[32:47] They want to be cranking them out come the summertime.

[32:53] I mean, now we have 106 people watching.

[32:56] Well, Jersey Jack right now is at a period where they need a

[33:00] hit.

[33:02] They know it.

[33:03] You know it.

[33:04] We know it.

[33:04] They have not felt good since the launch of Guns and Roses.

[33:09] That was three years ago.

[33:12] It's been a long time.

[33:13] They need to finish the Guns and Roses code.

[33:16] They need to put a pin in that game and just finish it.

[33:24] Who wants to speak on behalf of Jersey Jack Ryan?

[33:29] Well, sorry, we'll do better.

[33:32] Well, they box themselves up into a pricing corner.

[33:47] All right.

[33:49] Who do you guys want to talk about next?

[33:51] Michael Huntsman.

[33:52] You called it, Michael.

[33:53] We talked about Stern.

[33:55] We talked about Jersey Jack.

[33:57] Let's let Michael Huntsman call who we watch next.

[33:59] Now they're all going to pop out.

[34:01] We got the 16 lawyers from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[34:04] just joined the show.

[34:07] They're documenting this.

[34:08] You guys, you know how many times I get

[34:10] threatened by people legally?

[34:11] We're documenting what you're saying.

[34:14] That's cool.

[34:15] I would love to walk into court just like this.

[34:19] Michael, what company do you want to talk about next?

[34:22] I would love to walk into the court of law

[34:25] and hear a lawyer go in front of a judge

[34:29] and say, he said disparaging things about our game.

[34:33] Welcome to America.

[34:35] We're allowed to give reviews.

[34:37] All right, let's talk about Spooky.

[34:39] So Spooky Pimbal.

[34:41] They are not even halfway through Scooby-Doo.

[34:47] Even just saying that makes me exhausted.

[34:49] They're not even halfway through Scooby-Doo.

[34:55] They're not even halfway through Scooby-Doo.

[34:58] Now, here's what we know, because Bug has told people

[35:00] at Southern Fried Gaming Expo, they

[35:03] are working on three licensed-themed games right now.

[35:09] So they have three licenses.

[35:12] I'm going to tell you right now what I think two of them are.

[35:16] Looney Tunes, they are, I'm hearing under very good sources,

[35:23] Spooky Pimbal is making Looney Tunes.

[35:26] Can somebody do me a freaking favor?

[35:28] And Jason Knapp deserves this.

[35:30] Knapp's arcade said Stern has John Wick.

[35:35] Nobody but Canada has said.

[35:38] Canada is saying Spooky Pimbal is making Looney Tunes Pimbal.

[35:43] Can somebody out there go on to Pinside today, right now,

[35:51] and start a thread that says, Canada's predicting Spooky

[35:56] Pimbal has Looney Tunes license?

[35:59] And just that's all, folks.

[36:01] That's all I'd like you to do.

[36:03] Can I at least get credit for this one?

[36:06] Jason deserves credit for John Wick, not me.

[36:09] But I would like some Looney Tunes credit.

[36:12] I am the ultimate Looney Tune in this hobby.

[36:15] So I think they're going to do Looney Tunes.

[36:19] Even just say it.

[36:20] I don't know.

[36:21] Makes me smile, though.

[36:22] It's kind of funny.

[36:23] A lot of funny characters.

[36:25] Looney Tunes, the Princess Bride, I think they might have.

[36:32] I hope they have the Princess Bride,

[36:34] because if they don't have the Princess Bride,

[36:36] I hope that's not what Mike at Homepin says he has.

[36:39] And I think Evil Dead.

[36:43] If not Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[36:47] So those are my four bets on what I think really good.

[36:53] I think the two that I feel the best about

[36:55] are Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[36:59] And then I think after that, Princess Bride and Evil Dead.

[37:07] No, it needs to be Mel Blanks and Looney Tunes.

[37:16] Here's the thing, everybody.

[37:18] I don't think Spooky Pinball in the future wants to make 2,000 of every title.

[37:25] So if they make Looney Tunes and they only make 1,000

[37:29] and Princess Bride and 1,000, those two themes,

[37:33] I think Spooky needs to stop with this whole unlimited amounts of collector's editions

[37:40] and then nothing feels limited or special.

[37:42] They need to rethink their marketing strategy.

[37:45] Bug and Luke, I know you listen to Canada, so thank you for listening.

[37:48] They need to just make like, I would do 1,000 of each game.

[37:53] I would do 300 collector's editions and 700 Bloodsucker editions or LEs.

[37:59] And that's it.

[38:00] All of the games would hold value if the themes were there.

[38:03] And just do that.

[38:05] Make your millions, make your few million on each,

[38:07] move on to the next and get creative.

[38:11] A two-year-dor Spooky game with tax and buttercab,

[38:15] that's around 13,000 people, 13,000, think about that.

[38:22] I mean, look, if there ever was an example

[38:25] where you should have waited to see how this would go,

[38:29] it was Scooby-Doo.

[38:31] Because if you ordered Scooby-Doo and you're at the back of the line,

[38:34] you could go pick up the game today, New and Box with Buttercab, mid.

[38:38] Because distributors, here's the thing, people, can we be candid?

[38:42] Can I get in close with you?

[38:46] All right, we're closer now.

[38:48] Trust me when I say this.

[38:50] Distributors order a lot more games than they have customers for yet.

[39:00] Okay? They do.

[39:02] We're closer right now, right?

[39:04] So distributors might have ordered like 200 Scooby-Doo's

[39:09] and they might have only sold 120, maybe 150.

[39:14] Okay, and then what's going to happen is this.

[39:16] If I'm a distributor, this is how it works, people.

[39:19] If I'm a distributor, and let's say I ordered, I want to order 100 Scooby-Doo's.

[39:24] Okay, let's just say 100.

[39:25] Let's say I sold 80.

[39:28] 80 people gave me nonrefundable deposits.

[39:31] Okay, here's what's going to happen.

[39:34] The 20 that I need to sell, okay, the 20 that I haven't sold yet,

[39:39] when Spooky Pinball sends me games,

[39:43] I'm going to make those first 20 they sell me.

[39:48] I'm going to let those cut the line and sell them as new in-box games

[39:53] because I need to sell those games more than I need to sell the nonrefundable deposit games that I got orders for

[40:00] because those deposits are nonrefundable.

[40:03] You see what I'm saying?

[40:05] When you give nonrefundable deposits, you no longer have power over anything.

[40:12] If you start seeing game sell on the second, if you give a nonrefundable deposit

[40:16] and you're Spooky number 1300, right, and then you start to see number 500 sold new in-box for less than sticker,

[40:27] you can't go buy it because you can't get a refund.

[40:32] Don't tell anybody I said this.

[40:34] The other thing distributors do, and we've seen some of them do this,

[40:38] they don't offer up all of their LE allotment

[40:43] because they're playing the market because they want to scalp on you.

[40:50] Didn't we see some distributors all of a sudden have Godzilla LE for $19,000 a year after the game came out?

[41:01] Where did that game come from?

[41:04] Maybe they just didn't sell it at 10.5.

[41:07] They held it back, told some of you it was sold out,

[41:12] and then they went and sold it for $19,000.

[41:16] Well, where did they get it from?

[41:18] Where did they get it from?

[41:20] Because the game sold out.

[41:21] It was part of their initial allotment,

[41:24] and Wallstern won't let them sell below-map pricing.

[41:28] There's no rule against them selling above-map pricing.

[41:33] Starting to see some distributors with Godfather CEs now.

[41:37] What?

[41:38] I thought Godfather CEs sold out.

[41:41] How do distributors have Godfather CEs now?

[41:44] Because they're holding them back.

[41:46] Because they want to manufacture this narrative of it's sold out.

[41:51] It's sold out.

[41:52] Hype, hype, hype, FOMO, FOMO, FOMO.

[41:56] Knowing all too well that they've got,

[42:00] they've got five of them waiting.

[42:03] So I'm going to tell you it's sold out for six months.

[42:06] You can't get one. You can't own.

[42:08] Lo and behold, look what I just found.

[42:10] I've got five LEDs.

[42:13] $19,000.

[42:17] They won't deny it.

[42:18] They won't deny it.

[42:21] Shhh.

[42:22] Canada, you're not allowed to talk like this.

[42:26] We got to celebrate all things pinball.

[42:34] Been like this for years.

[42:37] Most know this.

[42:38] What's the point?

[42:39] Ken, the point is most don't know this, Ken.

[42:43] Ken, most people don't know this.

[42:46] Ken, most people don't know this.

[42:56] James Bond, LA.

[42:59] You never hear about James Bond anymore.

[43:02] Is the game great?

[43:05] You notice how the James Bond code?

[43:08] You notice how the James Bond code?

[43:11] So Ken, Ken,

[43:12] Ken, how does it make you feel?

[43:17] Ken, do you think a distributor,

[43:20] let me ask you, let's ask the gang an ethical question.

[43:23] Do you think a distributor should be doing that?

[43:26] Do you think a distributor should be holding back inventory,

[43:30] telling their own customers the games are sold out,

[43:34] and then in a clandestine way,

[43:38] six months later, selling the game for 50% over sticker?

[43:43] Do you think they should be doing that?

[43:46] Or shouldn't they just be getting their margins as a dealership?

[43:51] I mean, what they're basically doing is what the car industry does,

[43:54] which is like, it's a market-adjusted price, an ADM.

[44:01] And as I said, pinball ADMs are coming.

[44:03] But here's the thing, Ken,

[44:05] I wouldn't mind if they did it because dealerships do it, right?

[44:09] Here's the thing, Ken,

[44:11] I have no problem if a dealer or a distra wants to charge over for a game.

[44:18] I have no problem.

[44:19] What I have a problem with, Ken,

[44:21] is they try to hide the fact that they're doing it.

[44:24] See, when a car dealership does it,

[44:26] and I walk into like Park Avenue Dodge,

[44:29] and they want 100,000 over for the new demon,

[44:32] at least I know where they stand,

[44:35] and they're standing in front of their greed.

[44:39] You know what I'm saying?

[44:40] But what happens in the pinball world is it's all done backdoor,

[44:45] it's all done behind separate sites and all this stuff and vaults and what not.

[44:50] Like, just put your dealership stamp on it.

[44:55] I get it.

[44:56] You want to sell this Godzilla for market value, fine,

[44:59] but don't try to hide it off in the back room.

[45:04] Because they want it,

[45:05] here's the thing, is they want to do it,

[45:07] they want their cake and they want to eat it too.

[45:10] They still want their reputation of being a solid dealer who doesn't do it,

[45:14] even though they're doing it.

[45:16] That's what it comes down to.

[45:18] We don't do that, we don't do that,

[45:20] and then they're doing it, so just own it.

[45:22] That's all I'm saying, own it.

[45:25] And there's multiple distributors that do this.

[45:36] Look, if I'm wrong,

[45:38] if there's anybody watching right now who wants to come on and say,

[45:42] hey, Chris, you're not a dealer, you don't know what to do,

[45:45] just come on, just hit the button and join the show, okay?

[45:50] Don't send me emails after this,

[45:53] formally asking me to retract stuff and take stuff down,

[45:56] because I'm not doing it.

[45:58] I've got the best lawyer in the pinball world in Canada's corner.

[46:03] He's my boy, he's the best.

[46:05] I love him, he's watching right now, probably.

[46:09] He's gonna watch, he's gonna be like,

[46:11] he's funny because he always tells me,

[46:13] Chris, I would have worded it more like this.

[46:15] Allegedly they're doing this, okay, let's have it.

[46:17] These distributors are allegedly doing it.

[46:20] I love my legal friend because he gives me the legal speak.

[46:25] And also just so you know, if you wanna ask Canada to do something,

[46:29] just ask me to do it.

[46:32] Don't send me a request saying, we're formally asking you.

[46:36] Like, are you wearing a tuxedo when you formally ask me to do something?

[46:41] Formally is not a legal term, okay?

[46:45] I love when non-legal people try to act legal

[46:50] and they try to threaten you with legal speak.

[46:53] That's not actual legally binding terminology.

[46:59] Like, I'm not gonna check with my lawyer.

[47:01] And he's like laughing at this stuff.

[47:03] He's like, these guys don't know what they're doing.

[47:08] I hate that people are wasting megabytes documenting all of these shows.

[47:14] Alright, so we talked about Spooky.

[47:17] We talked about what titles we think are next.

[47:19] Now we're not gonna see Spooky's next until sometime next year.

[47:23] Well look, nothing's really gonna intimidate me.

[47:27] I know what the line is.

[47:29] I know what crossing the line looks like.

[47:31] I know what saying, disparaging things looks like.

[47:34] And I know what libel looks like and slander looks like.

[47:37] And I'm not doing that.

[47:39] I'm just giving my opinions about these companies.

[47:41] I'm not telling you what to do other than wait and see.

[47:45] That is, I am telling you to pause, okay?

[47:49] I am telling you to pause your FOMO spending.

[47:53] And that's not illegal for me to advocate that, to be an advocate for that.

[48:00] You know, I feel good.

[48:02] Emily, welcome to the house.

[48:04] Emily, how you doing?

[48:06] So I saw the Barbie movie.

[48:09] I loved it.

[48:11] It wasn't so much a movie as it was a 90 minute speech about modern feminism.

[48:17] Okay?

[48:18] I mean, it was preachy.

[48:20] I mean, it's like the whole movie.

[48:22] It reminded me of Atlas Shrugged, where the entire Atlas Shrugged book

[48:27] is all about just getting to John Galt's radio address,

[48:32] because John Galt's radio address is just Iron Rans philosophy.

[48:39] The entire Barbie movie is simply a Trojan horse to dispel, not dispel,

[48:46] that's the wrong word, to dispense the point of view of the film,

[48:53] which is a very modern feminism point of view.

[48:57] Look, I think if you have kids, I think if you're in a loving relationship,

[49:04] I think if you understand what your mother went through,

[49:08] I think if you understand what your wives go through,

[49:11] I think Barbie has a lot of important stuff to say.

[49:17] Does it overly talk down on men and make men into troglodytes

[49:25] who are vain and superficial?

[49:29] Sure, it does.

[49:31] But the counterpoint would be we've been doing that to women

[49:37] for a very long time, gentlemen.

[49:39] So to get a dose of our own medicine in a way, I don't have a problem with it.

[49:46] I think I don't want to ruin the movie for anybody, go see it.

[49:50] But the song that the Kens sing on the beach when they're playing the acoustic guitars

[49:55] is absolutely the perfect song choice to talk about male misogyny.

[50:03] But anyway, last point I'll make is this.

[50:08] A Barbie pinball machine would sell hotcakes every single executive

[50:15] who's a woman of power would...

[50:19] The Barbie merch is not that great.

[50:21] If they sold a pinball machine, these powerful women, these fathers with daughters,

[50:27] they would buy these things up like you couldn't imagine

[50:31] and put them into their homes.

[50:37] This pinball industry messed up not having a Barbie pinball machine ready to go.

[50:44] Now look, there are more Barbie movies coming.

[50:47] I think there's like the Pink Knight and then the Pink Knight Rises, I think is two more.

[50:54] And then there's a Ken movie.

[50:56] But I really hope this pinball industry... Jersey Jack, you would sell...

[51:03] Look, gang, agree or disagree, Jersey Jack, you would sell way more Barbie pinball machines

[51:09] than the Godfather.

[51:12] You would sell way more, three times as many, maybe five times as many.

[51:18] Jersey Jack, you would sell more Barbies than Toy Story 4.

[51:22] Toy Story 4 in 2022, it's old news.

[51:27] It's an old movie. It never was a movie that caught on culturally.

[51:31] Gang, trust me when I say this, you don't understand the power of Barbie.

[51:38] That's going to be the sound clip they use when they put up this for submission in the trippies.

[51:46] Those show normal footage of every other personality.

[51:51] And then Canadians will be like, you don't understand the cultural significance of Barbie.

[52:03] I think you're wrong.

[52:05] Most guys would want it in their game room because most guys have wives.

[52:11] Most guys have families.

[52:14] Pinball is not a solo dude thing.

[52:19] Almost all of you collectors out there who are spending this kind of money have...

[52:24] Most of you have significant others and partners and families.

[52:29] Carl, you're going to order game number one.

[52:34] Wait, wait, let's keep it on this. Just say yes or no.

[52:38] Do you think Barbie would outsell the Godfather?

[52:44] Yes or no? Let's just go.

[52:46] Let's just go for one minute. Would Barbie outsell the Godfather?

[52:51] Yes or no? Go. Hit me.

[52:54] Yes, said Carl.

[52:57] Yes, said Dave.

[53:00] Yes, said Ken.

[53:03] Yes, said Dan.

[53:06] Yes, said Samantha.

[53:08] Right now Jersey Jack hates me so much. Yes, said Adam.

[53:12] Yes, said Patrick. And we know the license is available.

[53:15] They gave the license to everybody.

[53:18] You could get the license. Emily, yes, exclamation.

[53:21] Yes, yes, yes.

[53:23] I don't know if this means you love Barbie or you just hate Godfather

[53:27] or maybe it's just both of those things happening at the same time.

[53:31] Everybody's saying yes. Everybody's saying yes.

[53:34] Absolutely, said Matt.

[53:36] Tim. Yes.

[53:38] Right now they're calling over the Jersey Jack.

[53:41] Only Jeff Mcnail. Jeff, you bought a Godfather, didn't you?

[53:44] Jeff, did you buy a Godfather? Come clean.

[53:49] Do you have a Godfather?

[53:52] Come on. Whoever said no owns a Godfather.

[53:57] Oh my God. Oh my God.

[54:01] Jay said yes, of course.

[54:04] Unfortunately, yes. Alright, thank you for being honest, Kevin.

[54:07] Like right now they're calling over to JJP, be like,

[54:09] Canada's live. What's he doing?

[54:11] Well, he's saying that Barbie would outsell the Godfather.

[54:14] Goddamn, Canada again!

[54:17] How are we going to sell more Godfathers as long as Canada's on the airwaves?

[54:22] Distros, sitting on Godfather Elise.

[54:25] I know you hate me. I'm sorry.

[54:28] I didn't make the game. I didn't make you buy it.

[54:32] You did. I never would have stocked up on Jersey Jack Elise.

[54:37] You should have let them sell them directly.

[54:39] It's not my fault.

[54:41] Canada didn't make Galactic Tank Force.

[54:43] Dennis Nordman did.

[54:45] David Fixed did.

[54:47] I didn't put a stupid tank right in the middle of the play field

[54:50] that breaks up all the action of that game.

[54:52] They did. I didn't design a game where the targets

[54:56] bend awkwardly and create airballs.

[54:58] They did. Okay? It's not me.

[55:01] I didn't charge $17,500 for a game to give you a lunchbox and a thermos.

[55:06] They did. Okay?

[55:08] So don't hate me. I am simply reacting to this stuff.

[55:13] When something goes on that's great, do you hear me complaining about it ever?

[55:18] Do you ever hear me complain about Pulp Fiction?

[55:21] Do you ever hear me say anything bad about Godzilla?

[55:24] Do you ever hear me talk trash about Foo Fighters?

[55:27] No. No. Okay?

[55:30] But it wouldn't be exciting to do a show if I was just like,

[55:33] hey, Godzilla's great. Let's talk about how great Godzilla is again this week.

[55:37] This is Don's Pimbal Podcast.

[55:39] Don, I gotcha. I gotcha.

[55:42] Don's been going live to like eight views.

[55:45] Eight viewers. Eight viewers. Eight viewers.

[55:47] We got over 100.

[55:49] Saturday morning, Don.

[55:51] Don, nobody wants to spend 90 minutes on a Friday night listening to you.

[55:55] Look at yourself.

[55:56] Because we can feel you looking at yourself.

[55:59] It's like you're catching yourself in the mirror.

[56:01] You got to get comfortable.

[56:03] You got to know what you look like, Don.

[56:05] We know what you look like. I love you, brother. Keep up the good work.

[56:08] Don's at over $40 a month now.

[56:11] He's got... He's climbing. He's climbing.

[56:19] He hasn't sold out yet. He hasn't sold out yet.

[56:22] He's not doing ads for everybody yet. It's a good sign.

[56:27] Ugh. Alright, let's talk American Pimbal.

[56:30] Let's talk American Pimbal. Oh! Galactic Tank Force.

[56:34] Um, gang, um, I got an idea.

[56:39] We're going to make a game. It's called Galactic Tank Force.

[56:43] Let's pretend like, like the marketing call.

[56:46] I got an idea for a game. It's called Galactic Tank Force.

[56:51] The cabinet is a freaking tank. Okay?

[56:54] Looks like a tank when the back box is folded down.

[56:58] What's that? Well, people fold the back box up.

[57:02] Why would we do that when the back box is always up?

[57:05] Um, look, I don't want to answer that.

[57:08] I want to get back to the point that it's called Galactic Tank Force.

[57:12] It's got these freaking tank treads with lights on them

[57:15] that don't sync up with the gameplay.

[57:17] Um, and then it's got this big tank, right?

[57:20] That looks real cheap 3D printed in the middle of the game

[57:23] that's going to break up all the flow of the game.

[57:25] And then you're going to hit these targets.

[57:27] The ball is going to bounce over the center drain saving thing.

[57:30] The center drain saving thing is also 3D printed

[57:34] with a really cheap decal on it that's going to peel over time.

[57:37] And then there's these cows and you hit the UFOs

[57:40] and then you're like this intergalactic tank force

[57:43] that's trying to save the universe from having its like galactic milk stolen

[57:48] because people want ice cream and outer space.

[57:50] And I don't know what the hell I'm saying anymore.

[57:52] Why don't we just make freaking He-Man?

[57:55] What the hell are you thinking, American Pinball?

[57:58] Did you think we were going to hand over money for that idea?

[58:03] I look, I'm not going to name names,

[58:05] but someone told me who's very high up in a pinball company.

[58:09] There's a reason why Dennis Nordman had this game in his garage for a decade

[58:18] because nobody wanted to make it.

[58:22] You don't even see Dennis Nordman promoting the game.

[58:25] He wants nothing to do, he doesn't even promote the game.

[58:32] Can we get the lights on the tank treads to sync up with the game?

[58:37] So, hey, are we going to give an instruction manual?

[58:42] So for people who buy this game, they actually know how to hook up the game.

[58:47] There's no instruction manual.

[58:49] Did you see this guy hooked up the game with the tank treads going the wrong way?

[58:54] To me, that is the epitome of American Pinball's decision making that's happening over there.

[59:01] The tank treads are going in the wrong direction.

[59:03] The company is still going in the wrong direction.

[59:06] Where is David Fix? Where are any of them?

[59:10] Where is Steve Bowden with like weekly streams?

[59:13] This is what they've given up.

[59:15] They've given up. The game is D-O-A.

[59:22] And you know what? I know Franchi gets mad when I say this.

[59:25] I know you worked on the game, brother, but come on, it's a miss.

[59:28] It's a flop. The game's a flop.

[59:30] The game's a flop. The sales are not there.

[59:33] The game's a flop.

[59:35] What did you think was going to happen?

[59:37] They have, look, and all signs are pointing to the fact that they have the He-Man license.

[59:47] So why would you make this game if you have the He-Man license?

[59:54] So is Moriah McQuade making He-Man?

[59:57] Because Dennis Norman's next game is slated to be an American Pinball game.

[01:00:01] It's the sequel to Whitewater People.

[01:00:04] His Whitewater sequel is what's next from him.

[01:00:09] The problem is this game flopped.

[01:00:12] And so are you going to now heavily invest in that?

[01:00:15] I think, let's get close again. Let's get intimately in close.

[01:00:18] Okay, we're close again.

[01:00:20] Okay, here's a little...

[01:00:22] Shh!

[01:00:23] Don't tell anybody I said this.

[01:00:26] But being a pinball design legend from 30 years ago...

[01:00:35] doesn't matter anymore.

[01:00:38] Oh!

[01:00:40] Oh, he said it!

[01:00:43] Oh, shoot!

[01:00:45] Keith Owens running circles around these guys.

[01:00:47] Oh, he said it!

[01:00:49] Oh, no!

[01:00:51] Wait, Jack Danger is a better designer

[01:00:54] than Dennis Norman is right now.

[01:00:57] Oh, you can't say that, Kaneda!

[01:01:00] These are legends.

[01:01:02] Legends of pinball.

[01:01:04] Legends.

[01:01:06] Now, nobody knows what they designed

[01:01:08] versus the Baldy Williams engineers

[01:01:10] that made all these designers look great.

[01:01:13] Oh, you can't say that!

[01:01:15] You can't say it was the Baldy Williams team

[01:01:18] that made Brian Eddie magical,

[01:01:20] that made, you know, Dennis Norman incredible,

[01:01:23] that made Pat Lawler.

[01:01:25] Look what Pat Lawler did

[01:01:27] without the Baldy Williams design team.

[01:01:29] Oh, you said it again!

[01:01:31] This man is not respecting legacies.

[01:01:35] He's saying that Keith Owens,

[01:01:38] with one hand tied behind his back,

[01:01:41] could design a better game than Pat Lawler

[01:01:45] in the last 10 years.

[01:01:48] I just said it.

[01:01:50] I'm really asking Kim Mitchell to agree

[01:01:52] with everything I say.

[01:01:54] Kaneda, you can't talk like this.

[01:01:57] You can. He's got the sequel to Whitewater.

[01:02:00] Let me tell you right now,

[01:02:02] Whitewater will never sell as good as John Wick.

[01:02:06] It's over.

[01:02:09] This original IP love affair

[01:02:12] with like Baldy Williams' original IP,

[01:02:15] it's not going to work.

[01:02:20] You would sell more the Smurfs

[01:02:23] than Whitewater 2.0.

[01:02:26] You wonder why

[01:02:30] Kaneda's pinball podcast has been voted favorite.

[01:02:33] This is going to give me good audio.

[01:02:35] This is going to give me great audio.

[01:02:37] Can't say it!

[01:02:39] Show the man some respect.

[01:02:41] You know what's also, how you show people respect?

[01:02:44] You retire.

[01:02:47] Like Vince Neil of Motley Crew.

[01:02:50] You sound like garbage.

[01:02:54] Show Motley Crew fans respect and retire.

[01:02:59] The same is getting true of Axel now.

[01:03:02] At a point, you've got to retire.

[01:03:05] Let your legacy live on when you had it.

[01:03:10] I'll do the same thing.

[01:03:12] Kaneda's dropping fire eight years in.

[01:03:15] I'm only getting better, baby.

[01:03:18] We got 608 probably going to be 609 by the time this is done.

[01:03:22] Shoot, man.

[01:03:24] One day we're going to get Neil McCray.

[01:03:26] Neil McCray's got like half a million dollars in games.

[01:03:29] And he says to me, I don't pay for someone's opinion.

[01:03:32] $5, Neil.

[01:03:35] $5.

[01:03:37] Neil McCray, if you join the show,

[01:03:40] I'll do an entire show just dedicated to you, Neil.

[01:03:43] The Neil McCray Hour. Let's do it.

[01:03:46] You guys disagree with this?

[01:03:49] I know like other pinball personalities don't talk like this.

[01:03:52] No coffee, no alcohol.

[01:03:54] You don't really want sober Kaneda with his mind right.

[01:03:57] Hitting you like this.

[01:03:59] Like come on, wait, he just said?

[01:04:01] He just said that Pat Lawler's best friend is a good friend.

[01:04:05] He's a good friend.

[01:04:07] He just said that Pat Lawler's best years were behind him.

[01:04:12] He just said that Steve Ritchie might not got it no more.

[01:04:16] Oh, shoot.

[01:04:18] You can't say that about the king.

[01:04:20] I can because Keith Elwyn is the new king.

[01:04:25] Last time I checked, you get the throne because your games are conquering.

[01:04:33] That's how you become a king.

[01:04:36] You conquer Led Zeppelin, Star Wars, Black Knight, Godzilla, bro.

[01:04:47] Jurassic Park, Avengers, Iron Maid and then he's conquering.

[01:04:55] He's conquering. He's the king now.

[01:04:58] Eric Minier has been conquered.

[01:05:00] He's had two misses out of three.

[01:05:03] You know, Eric's down in like the dungeons.

[01:05:08] He needs to figure it out.

[01:05:12] Kaneda, come on, are we doing this?

[01:05:15] I'm going to go to the gym today.

[01:05:16] We're keeping it going.

[01:05:20] The one thing good about Barbie, damn, and the kens are jacked.

[01:05:24] It was funny though how they tried to represent all body styles.

[01:05:28] I was like, I mean sure, but we get what you're doing here.

[01:05:34] You guys having fun?

[01:05:35] Look, if you're buying what I'm selling and you want to show the Kaneda haters you agree with this,

[01:05:41] kick your boys some stars.

[01:05:44] Come on, come on, I'm going to bust now.

[01:05:46] Kick me some stars. Let's do this.

[01:05:49] I'm not going to stop dancing like this till we get stars.

[01:05:52] Right now, document this haters. Document it.

[01:05:55] He's talking jovially.

[01:05:57] He's talking about pause and there we go.

[01:06:00] 50 stars. He's dancing like a fool.

[01:06:02] He's making a mock. I'll just do this.

[01:06:04] I'm playing my imaginary pinball machine.

[01:06:06] Oh, oh, oh, look at that.

[01:06:08] Oh, I'm going to flip.

[01:06:09] Dead pass. I just did pass. I just did pass.

[01:06:11] Oh, oh, oh, up the middle.

[01:06:12] Wizard mode. I'm already in wizard mode.

[01:06:14] Oh, look, 1,000 stars. 1,000 stars.

[01:06:17] Who you got here?

[01:06:18] Dana's in the house.

[01:06:20] Pete Rosen, did you sell your Batman?

[01:06:21] Where's Pete Rosen? We need him.

[01:06:24] Kaneda's now playing an imaginary.

[01:06:26] Right now, you know the haters.

[01:06:28] Like right now, he's playing an imaginary pinball machine,

[01:06:31] making a mockery out of us, dancing like a fool.

[01:06:34] Like we need to stop this guy.

[01:06:36] Well, what can we do?

[01:06:37] I don't know. Maybe we send it.

[01:06:38] Oh, 10,000 stars, baby.

[01:06:40] Look at that. Pete Rosen.

[01:06:42] Pete F. and Rosen in the house.

[01:06:46] Just sending like a catapult towards the Kaneda haters.

[01:06:51] Boom. Boom. Boom.

[01:06:54] Who can top Pete Rosen's 10,000?

[01:06:57] I mean, Pete, you just owned it.

[01:06:59] You just got Brenda's Thai dinner tonight.

[01:07:03] Oh, 500. Okay, 500. We love it.

[01:07:06] Robert, we love anything.

[01:07:08] Let's do this. They're like, he's doing it again.

[01:07:11] He's doing it again.

[01:07:12] He's hit up his army and they're active.

[01:07:16] And we got to stop them.

[01:07:17] Somebody get the legal people on board.

[01:07:20] Let's set up the formal notice.

[01:07:22] We formally request that you retract everything you said

[01:07:25] on your Kaneda Facebook Live as it's detrimental to my business

[01:07:29] and the emotional well-being of Pimbal people.

[01:07:33] People, what makes Pimbal awesome is the community.

[01:07:38] It's us hanging out Saturday mornings.

[01:07:41] I'm in New York City. You're somewhere else.

[01:07:44] I'm playing an imaginary Pimbal machine.

[01:07:46] Pete Rosen just kicked 10,000 stars.

[01:07:48] The Kaneda haters are the ones not having the fun.

[01:07:52] Now look, Jason Nap and I are cool.

[01:07:54] Jason, I love your stuff, man.

[01:07:56] You're never going to hear anything disparaging from me ever again.

[01:07:59] I love your stuff, brother.

[01:08:01] All I ask is that if any of my rumors becomes right,

[01:08:04] a little footnote, put me down at the bottom.

[01:08:08] Like, asterisk.

[01:08:09] Kaneda said this like eight months ago.

[01:08:11] Okay, now, Jengis, I'm on a roll right now.

[01:08:15] I'm trying to make amends.

[01:08:16] I'm trying to build bridges back to the Kaneda haters.

[01:08:19] Jengis is the next nut we need to crack.

[01:08:22] We need to get Jengis back, right?

[01:08:25] Now I've sent him a couple emails apologizing,

[01:08:29] asking him to just man up.

[01:08:31] I just want Jengis to do what Jason did,

[01:08:33] where we just talked like grown men.

[01:08:35] Okay, so Jengis, if you're boys with Jengis,

[01:08:39] okay, you say Kaneda would like to build a bridge

[01:08:44] to a new future between America and Denmark.

[01:08:49] Let's rocky for it, Jengis.

[01:08:52] Rocky for, okay?

[01:08:54] I'll be climbing to the top of the hill.

[01:08:56] Jengis!

[01:08:57] But here's the thing, he's blocked.

[01:08:59] He's blocked.

[01:09:00] But what I'm going to do now, all right,

[01:09:03] is I'm going to unblock him right now.

[01:09:05] We're going to do it right now.

[01:09:07] You can see he's blocked.

[01:09:09] Let's do it.

[01:09:10] Let's unblock Jengis live for everybody to see.

[01:09:15] Jason Naph has been killing it, Albert.

[01:09:17] How you been doing, brother?

[01:09:19] I love me some Orbi.

[01:09:20] Orbi, but Albert, can I ask you a question?

[01:09:23] I went on the LoserKids Pimball podcast,

[01:09:26] and there was like discussion about Nintendo Wii games.

[01:09:32] It's called LoserKid Pimball podcast.

[01:09:37] Why are we talking about like video games now?

[01:09:41] What's happening?

[01:09:44] Stick to the narrative, people.

[01:09:47] All right, let's do this.

[01:09:48] Let's unblock Jengis.

[01:09:49] We need to get him back.

[01:09:51] Got my computer.

[01:09:52] We're getting him in.

[01:09:53] We got 15 minutes.

[01:09:55] Pete Rosen wins today.

[01:09:56] Now, Pete, did you sell your Batman SLE?

[01:09:59] We know you're there now.

[01:10:00] You can't hide.

[01:10:01] Did you sell your Batman SLE?

[01:10:05] Come clean, Pete.

[01:10:06] Come clean.

[01:10:07] Oh, yeah.

[01:10:12] Poor Man's Pimball.

[01:10:13] Sorry, it wasn't LoserKid Pimball podcast.

[01:10:15] It was Poor Man's Pimball.

[01:10:17] It's the Poor Man's Pimball Network,

[01:10:19] but it's still Poor Man's Pimball.

[01:10:21] Thank you for clarifying.

[01:10:22] It wasn't LoserKid.

[01:10:24] All right, let's see.

[01:10:25] Privacy.

[01:10:26] I think it's privacy blocking.

[01:10:30] Manage.

[01:10:31] Okay.

[01:10:32] Block users.

[01:10:34] Edit.

[01:10:35] See your block list.

[01:10:38] There he is.

[01:10:45] There he is at the top of the block list.

[01:10:49] Now, if you're on this block list,

[01:10:51] you're on it for a reason,

[01:10:53] but we're going to unblock Jengis right now.

[01:10:55] Are you ready for it?

[01:10:57] Can someone, can we do a 10 countdown?

[01:11:01] Are we ready?

[01:11:02] Everybody live?

[01:11:04] The unblocking of Jengis Retro Django Dennis.

[01:11:09] Are we ready?

[01:11:12] Can we type in the comments 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

[01:11:25] Adam Hicks.

[01:11:26] Here we go.

[01:11:28] Unblock.

[01:11:29] Boom.

[01:11:30] Boom.

[01:11:31] Come back.

[01:11:32] Oh, Jengis.

[01:11:33] Jengis, come back to me, brother.

[01:11:35] Come back to me.

[01:11:39] Is it official?

[01:11:40] Let me make sure it's official.

[01:11:48] I want to make sure it's official, people,

[01:11:51] before I celebrate.

[01:11:55] I think he's off.

[01:11:56] I think he's off.

[01:11:57] See your block list.

[01:11:58] Oh, no.

[01:12:00] We got to confirm it.

[01:12:01] This popped up.

[01:12:02] I didn't see it.

[01:12:04] Unblock Jengis.

[01:12:06] Let's confirm it.

[01:12:08] He's off.

[01:12:09] He's off, baby.

[01:12:12] He's off.

[01:12:17] Let's bring it in.

[01:12:18] Bring it in, people.

[01:12:19] It's a very emotional show we're having together.

[01:12:22] Good morning, Ty.

[01:12:25] Now what we need to do is we need the Canada Army

[01:12:29] to hit up Jengis and be like, look, man,

[01:12:33] Chris is sorry.

[01:12:35] I know I dropped a lot of F-bombs making fun of you,

[01:12:38] talking about pinball brothers giving you inside information.

[01:12:46] No man should die on a pinball brother's hill.

[01:12:49] Jengis, it's time.

[01:12:52] I know you got relegated.

[01:12:53] You had to interview Don.

[01:12:55] I know the views weren't there.

[01:12:59] People want to see Apollo and Rocky back together again.

[01:13:03] This is Carl Weathers and Arnold Brother.

[01:13:05] We have the same horrible haircut, man.

[01:13:08] You can't replace me with Don.

[01:13:10] That doesn't work.

[01:13:11] That doesn't work.

[01:13:13] I brought the Canada Army to your viewership.

[01:13:17] Don's got the eight guys.

[01:13:19] Those eight guys.

[01:13:21] This is a fun show.

[01:13:30] He can watch it now.

[01:13:33] He can watch this now.

[01:13:35] All you have to do is hit up Jengis and be like,

[01:13:37] hey, look, watch the last 20 minutes of Canada's Facebook Live.

[01:13:47] Pete, congratulations.

[01:13:50] Pete sold his Batman SLE with two plays because I broadcasted it out to my community.

[01:13:56] I get no referral fee for that.

[01:13:59] But Pete, let me ask you a question.

[01:14:02] And I know you've already given the $10,000 so you can take it back.

[01:14:06] Will you tell us how much you sold it for?

[01:14:12] Did you sell it for at least $30,000?

[01:14:15] Can we start there?

[01:14:16] Because I want to know if my $25,000 Batman SLE was a good buy or not.

[01:14:22] Because you sold yours instantly.

[01:14:24] Now yours only had two plays on it, you said.

[01:14:27] But mine has a playfield protector on it from day one, which is perfect.

[01:14:33] He sold it for over $30,000.

[01:14:39] So I just want to say, look.

[01:14:45] I complain about pricing all the time, but I'm telling you right now, people,

[01:14:51] very few games are going to be the sought after high end machines.

[01:14:55] Batman SLE is in a different stratosphere.

[01:14:59] It will be worth $50,000 one day.

[01:15:02] It will be.

[01:15:04] There's just only 80, and some of them have been destroyed on locations.

[01:15:10] Look, look.

[01:15:12] Again, the consumer for that kind of very rare, rare pin is a guy that doesn't care about $30,000, trust me.

[01:15:23] I know some people in this hobby who make $30,000 a day after taxes on their business holdings.

[01:15:33] A day.

[01:15:36] Alright, friend is back.

[01:15:38] We got nine minutes.

[01:15:42] Let's do this.

[01:15:45] Killing, you want to join for the last few minutes, buddy?

[01:15:49] Is Kielbasa here?

[01:15:51] Where is he?

[01:15:59] It's not about the bricks.

[01:16:01] You got to learn to play better, Albert.

[01:16:03] This is a really fun episode.

[01:16:05] How are you guys doing?

[01:16:07] Are you guys enjoying these Facebook lives?

[01:16:10] Are you feeling the positive vibes?

[01:16:12] I mean, look, it's positivity mixed with sarcasm.

[01:16:16] And the only people who don't want to hear Canada say this stuff are the manufacturers and the distros.

[01:16:23] I don't know what to tell you.

[01:16:26] I just want better machines, and we're not going to get better machines if we just buy everything sight unseen.

[01:16:32] We're not going to get better toppers if we buy $1,000 flat plastic toppers.

[01:16:37] And if the effort's not there, why would we celebrate such an inflated price of something when the effort's not going into it?

[01:16:46] Thank you.

[01:16:47] I love doing these Facebook lives.

[01:16:49] I love doing the podcast.

[01:16:51] For you club members out there, these Facebook lives, I will make this an audio podcast for club members.

[01:17:01] If you're not a member of the Canadian club or you have friends that are not, I think you're supporting me monthly for $5.

[01:17:10] It's not just your access to those exclusive shows.

[01:17:14] It's support for this.

[01:17:16] It's support for all the time and energy that I take away from personal life to create content.

[01:17:23] It's fun. I enjoy it.

[01:17:24] That's why I'm still here.

[01:17:26] That's why other shows might burn out.

[01:17:30] This one never will because there's no editing here.

[01:17:34] To me, this is more entertaining than even some of the most highly produced and edited pinball podcasts because the amount of effort they do and then whatever.

[01:17:44] It's still old news a week later.

[01:17:46] So why just do this?

[01:17:48] And no one else does this.

[01:17:50] Nobody else can just hit Facebook live and do it.

[01:17:55] I think it's such a fun, engaging and entertaining way.

[01:17:58] And it's just like, am I giving you the latest news, rumors, news?

[01:18:05] Yes, sometimes.

[01:18:07] Would I love to have like some pinball personalities join the show?

[01:18:10] Sure.

[01:18:12] Everybody, we got like seven minutes to go.

[01:18:15] Is anybody?

[01:18:20] Is anybody at Southern Fried Gaming Expo?

[01:18:27] Matt, I'll tell you this right now.

[01:18:30] Batman is the greatest code theme integrated game of all time.

[01:18:41] There is no game that has better code integrated into its theme integrated into its code than Batman ever.

[01:18:49] Limon Sheets labored over that game, Matt, for over three years to get it to where it got to.

[01:18:57] If you don't see the value in that, then I don't know what to tell you.

[01:19:04] No, Batman has even more theme integration than Godzilla.

[01:19:11] Everything in it is great.

[01:19:13] Godzilla is great too. Those two are great.

[01:19:20] But it's a special game to me.

[01:19:28] It's the only game when I sold it, I really had sellers remorse.

[01:19:35] I didn't feel that way when I got rid of Lord of the Rings, I didn't feel that way when I got rid of Rick and Morty or Magic Girl or Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[01:19:45] But when I got rid of Batman, I just wanted it back.

[01:19:50] I remember the moment too, I was that automated and Mike had a modded out Batman there.

[01:19:59] There's nothing about the Batman artwork and the colors and the theme and the music.

[01:20:05] There's just something about that game that is just so perfect for pinball.

[01:20:19] Everybody, we're going to end a little bit early today.

[01:20:22] I want to thank everybody for hanging out. It's always a good time. Have a great weekend.

[01:20:32] Remember, if you just wait and see, you're going to be in the driver's seat.

[01:20:37] It's not a message that other people want you to hear. They want you to buy everything immediately because they want you to remove their risks.

[01:20:45] Why would you remove the risk? I think for this much money, a game should be so good we shouldn't even be debating whether or not we want to own it.

[01:20:54] And that's where we're at with pinball. And it's not just these new game prices. Everybody now has jacked up the prices of their used games that they're trying to sell.

[01:21:03] It's stupid. It's stupid.

[01:21:06] Seeing people pay over for a premium, what's happened?

[01:21:11] I love watching my money pile up, watching my fans pile up, watching my subscribers pile up. It's great.

[01:21:19] And you know me, when I make a move on a game, it's going to be worth it. Trust me.

[01:21:24] Look at Batman. I bought it for 25. It just sold for over 30. I made a good move.

[01:21:30] All of you could have bought, even if you were just a scalper, that Batman SLE was up for 25,000.

[01:21:36] What was it? Everyone complaining, complaining. I knew it. I speculated on it.

[01:21:41] And I've already made more than 20% return on it without even taking possession of it.

[01:21:56] No, I'm an evil madness. People are just stupid.

[01:22:01] Everybody, be good. We'll be here next week.

[01:22:07] Get, and now everybody, go PM Jengis right now. Wake him up. Get the sleeping Denmarkian giant up.

[01:22:16] Tell him, Canada is back, has unblocked him, and let's party, brother. Stop hiding, all right?

[01:22:25] He didn't even give me a chance to talk to me. He didn't, like, man up, Jengis. Come on.

[01:22:29] Like, it's now, it's, now it's, his true colors are showing. Come on, bro.

[01:22:34] Man up. I've apologized. It wasn't that bad. If you, if you can't take your ego being bruised for just a little bit, come on.

[01:22:42] I get my ego trampled over every single weakness industry. It's okay, man. It's okay.

[01:22:49] Nothing was serious, all right? All right.

[01:22:58] Man up is being rude. Come on, Albert. Albert, really? Telling someone a man up is now rude.

[01:23:03] Albert, don't be, don't be so sensitive about this. Come on, man. Seriously. We can still be men.

[01:23:09] We can, we can, it's just a problem. This is one of the problems, like, all this up now.

[01:23:12] It's like, you can't, you can't, you, everyone's just like offended by everything you say.

[01:23:15] Really telling someone, man up, man up and have a conversation. That's, that's rude.

[01:23:25] Later, everybody. Get it out.
