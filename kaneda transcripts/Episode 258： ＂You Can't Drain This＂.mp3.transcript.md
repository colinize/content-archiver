[00:00] Everybody needs some time,

[00:03] Rollin' on,

[00:06] Oh, don't you know you need some time,

[00:10] All alone.

[00:12] It's true.

[00:19] It definitely feels like everyone needs a little time

[00:23] on their own in the Pimba Hobby, doesn't it?

[00:26] I mean, people get burnt out, they get frustrated,

[00:30] they lash out.

[00:31] We're gonna talk a little bit about that on this episode

[00:35] 258 of Canadian Pimbaal Podcast,

[00:37] because I know this podcast has been named

[00:40] as one of the reasons why someone is sick and tired

[00:43] of the Pimbaal Hobby and the pettiness and the drama.

[00:47] And I wanna talk a little bit about that,

[00:49] because it's kind of funny how other Pimbaal podcasts

[00:51] are getting it all wrong and have no idea the actual story.

[00:55] We're gonna talk a little bit about that at the end of this podcast.

[00:58] But before we do that, we've got a bunch of Pimbaal news we wanna talk about

[01:01] that's happening this week and where do I start?

[01:04] Where do I start?

[01:05] Let's start with this bit of news.

[01:07] A new member of the Pimbaal World has joined the deep root family

[01:13] and that is no other than Paul Ferris.

[01:16] Dennis Nordeman announced yesterday that Paul Ferris,

[01:20] who is an artist, that if you know Pimbaal

[01:23] and you know Pimbaal history, then you are probably very familiar

[01:28] with Mr. Paul Ferris, who has made games.

[01:32] You know, I'm looking at Pinside right now and where do you even start?

[01:35] Since the late 70s, he's been making games like Playboy, Paragon,

[01:40] Zinnon, Centaur, all the way up into the 90s when he did back to the future,

[01:47] Finn and the Opera, Batman, Teenage Mutant Into Turtles,

[01:52] Hook, Royal Rumble, Golden Eye, Twister and Vacation America.

[01:57] So Paul Ferris has been in the Pimbaal World for a very, very long time

[02:02] and he is now joining up with Deep Root to provide art for an original

[02:08] Dennis Nordeman game and not just the translate but the cabinet and the play field.

[02:13] So what do we think about that?

[02:16] I don't know, how are you supposed to judge an artist

[02:20] who is doing work that we haven't even seen yet?

[02:24] Look, I think the key takeaway here is, is that Deep Root.

[02:28] I think a lot of you have to feel this way.

[02:30] They have to be for real, like there has to be something really going on over there.

[02:36] I always enjoy talking to Robert and I think this just adds more and more curiosity into the mix.

[02:43] And there seems to be a lot of games being worked on at once.

[02:48] So everything from Johns games to Dennis's games to Barrios games to John Norris's games.

[02:54] That's a lot of people and for everyone to be busy and making a paycheck and doing work at Deep Root

[03:01] means that stuff has to be moving forward.

[03:04] Now it's just crazy because like are these guys just going to flip a switch one day and all of a sudden

[03:08] they've got five, six titles coming out in a year or are they going to paste it out?

[03:11] Like two games a year?

[03:13] Even if they can do more than one game every year and a half, they're well ahead

[03:18] of the production schedule of companies like Jersey Jack and even Spooky.

[03:23] So I think these guys have, I think they have a big team.

[03:28] We haven't seen anything.

[03:30] We haven't seen anything.

[03:31] Now when it comes to Pimbal Art, I think his stuff is, some of it's amazing, some of it's not as great.

[03:38] But the stuff that's not as great like in the 90s and the Stern ever error stuff,

[03:42] like again I don't think Stern put as much into art in that error.

[03:47] So we'll see what he comes up with.

[03:49] I'll say this about art in general.

[03:51] There are so many amazing artists and sometimes I feel like in the Pimbal world it's weird to me

[03:58] that almost like we keep going back to the same artists from yesterday years as if we can't find new artists.

[04:06] And I think if you look at the amazing art that Christopher Franci and Zambi Yeti and Dirty Donny have brought to Stern,

[04:14] I mean they're all new guys to Pimbal.

[04:16] These aren't guys that grew up in the 70s and 80s and 90s making Pimbal Art.

[04:20] And if you look at Jersey Jack goes and gets the artist who did Twilight Zone and to do Dildin,

[04:28] I don't think Dildin looks anywhere nearly as good as the artwork that Zambi Yeti, Dirty Donny and Franci are kicking out there.

[04:38] So my point is this, the competition in the Pimbal Art world is as high as it's ever been and you either need to be as good as or better than the artist that Stern is cranking out to impress people.

[04:53] The bar has been raised, there's no doubt about it.

[04:56] Speaking of that, did you see what Christopher Franci put up on Facebook?

[05:02] He put up an image, this is not a Pimbal image, it's just an image that he created of El Vira and it looks buttery sweet.

[05:12] I mean it looks incredible and I think I don't know if it's a teaser, we know Stern is making El Vira,

[05:17] the fact that this guy has a super, super sexy ability to bring El Vira to life, makes people excited.

[05:25] And I have to say, look I still think Franci's artwork is just so perfect for Pimbal.

[05:31] So that is exciting. Again, the Pimbal Art world is the best it's ever been without a doubt.

[05:38] Alright, what else is happening in the Pimbal world?

[05:40] So I watched another stream, I feel like this is all they do with Pirates of the Caribbean,

[05:45] I just watch streams of them playing the game.

[05:47] So Keith and Eric, they were streaming the final production version of the game for people about a,

[05:55] it was like a half hour, 45 minutes stream and I watched it and they've added some stuff,

[06:00] they added the ships blowing up, we're watching them play.

[06:03] And I've said it before, like Pimbal streams are not really the best way to know if you like a game or not,

[06:09] you have to jump on the game, I want to jump on the game.

[06:13] But I literally, I literally, when I watch the stream, I can't get over the amount of text that happens on the screen of this game.

[06:26] I'm literally like flabbergasted that Keith thinks it's a good idea to have so much text happening on a screen.

[06:35] It is, go watch the stream, I'm not making this up, you can go watch the screen, the stream and screen grab or freeze it at different moments where it's just like listing like like 10 different things happening in terms of like all the different things you need to do to complete the mode.

[06:53] And I came away thinking like what is going on with the coding of this game?

[06:58] It is almost like what you see on the screen is like the manual to pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:05] It's like they made a game where you're playing through the manual of the game.

[07:11] Like it's so incredibly strange to me the amount of text on the screen.

[07:17] I mean if we think about, if we think about Pimbal machines before Jersey Jack put the big LCD into the game, right?

[07:25] Before Jack there was nothing but DMDs and a DMD meant that you had to communicate what needed to happen in a Pimbal game in a very finite space in a very short period of time.

[07:40] And that meant that most of the communication needed to take place on the Pimbal machine itself of where you shoot or within the callouts of the game.

[07:50] And I don't think most people play games from you know the 90s and are like really confused and needed a big screen to communicate everything you need to do.

[08:00] In fact most Pimbal games the objective of what to do in the game is actually found on the card that is on the apron of the machine.

[08:10] Like a little what is it like a like a three by two inch card tells you the objective of the game.

[08:16] And so when I watch Pirates the Caribbean and it's like 22 characters and all this stuff and all this stuff that needs to be explained and all these things it's like it's like it's like they made a role playing game that has like an RPG when it needed to be more like Super Mario brothers where I just need to know how do I get from A to B in this game.

[08:37] It's impossible for me to figure out and that is why I think there's so much on it and another thing too as I look at the game and it's beautiful to look at like don't get me wrong like I look at this game and I'm like this game is sexiest fuck it just is but then I look down at it and I'm like ask yourself one question why are there so many inserts on the play field like what is going on.

[09:05] It's like literally they went overboard no pun intended on the amount of inserts like inserts don't equal better game like more inserts make it more confusing like why do you need so many inserts to guide people through your pinball experience.

[09:27] I'm it's look seriously like hit pause I'm there's probably over a hundred inserts on that play field and couple that with the fact that you've got this like screen and there's a map and like you know there's like there's like a magnifying glass or like a telescope moving over areas of the map with lines moving there's numbers everywhere then all of a sudden like all these screens come up with listing all these things and it just

[09:57] boggles my mind that they made it so complex I'm sorry it's a pinball machine guys it's a pinball machine if I could give one word of advice to everyone over at J.J.P. it's just like stop stop making these games like they need a 200 page manual to figure out what to do it would have been so much easier to be like you're a pirate and you need to do this like why do I need 22 different things that equal these games.

[10:27] These kinds of scoring these kinds of advantages this this person puts you in the mode which equals this multiplier which equals this which equals that which I can't I don't even I don't even understand what's happening like am I trying to get through the movies like am I try like what is the point of all of this colliding on a screen.

[10:47] It's literally literally and the here's what kills me is the game doesn't need all that why didn't need all of that and it just feels like it's like they let people go off and just go overboard and went too far on everything like someone needs to real key then and just tell them stop stop was you you're going too deep into everything I don't want to see an LCD screen that has like 25

[11:17] different things on it at once what are you doing it's a pinball machine you literally have fractions of a second to look up and see what you're doing and I say this because when I look at how stern is treating the LCD it's not nearly as confusing and impossible to follow as what's going on and and and that's my opinion and you can agree or you can disagree and it it it really pains me to watch all

[11:46] this because I think what's happening at Jersey Jack is they've got so much talent they've got so much ability to make these amazing pinball machines and they just don't know when to stop they don't know that the best ideas the best

[12:04] ideas in the world are simple ideas the best movies in the world are easy to explain what's going on right I got to get the

[12:15] DeLorean to 88 miles an hour with you know with enough energy to get back to the future right I got to take this ring and I got to throw it into the fires of

[12:27] Mount Doom and go to Mordor to save the world all right I need to defeat Darth Vader like it's just you know when you when you get

[12:36] really confusing like what is the goal of pirates the Caribbean it to me I watch the game and it's like I feel like the

[12:43] goal of the narrative is just to score points it's like to get through these modes but it's like how like by not having one

[12:53] protagonist by not knowing exactly what you're doing it's like you're just playing this you're playing like all the

[13:02] random elements of the franchise to score points but ultimately they should have just made it all about being

[13:11] Jack and he's the protagonist and you are Jack Sparrow and the goal of the game is to do this like they just need to stop and that's it

[13:24] that's it sorry I'm not going to keep going on I just I just feel like Jersey Jack has the greatest potential to make the greatest

[13:32] pinball machines and physically and engineering wise and code like all of the key elements are there and they just don't know how to get it to a

[13:44] place where it's like simple equals great a simple beautifully executed game is all you need the depth can be there but you don't need

[13:57] 150 inserts to guide a player to a game and multipliers two times three times four times does not make a story better it just doesn't

[14:09] what makes a great a great pinball machine is the journey not all the fucking bullshit like scoring this this that

[14:19] calm like all these things I want to feel like I'm a pirate and and I have a goal and I know if that is and and I'm not just like

[14:29] looking down at a million different things to do at once all right maybe am I wrong Keith come on the show talk to me how I'm wrong how

[14:37] how there is a simple thing going on here that you're missing canada Eric I would love for you to come on because I think it's all there and it's just all too much I just can't get my head around it

[14:46] it's like playing the manual it feels like I'm playing the manual to a game when I watch it

[14:52] um and I again email me guys if you have one if I'm missing something can a to pinball gmail.com I'm not I don't feel like I'm making this up like when I watch the deadpool stream like I get it I get the game

[15:05] and then I watch pirates and I'm like like five five movies like where where am I going anyway all right speaking of deadpool

[15:14] um I was looking this is an interesting thing I want to talk about so it's interesting to me that people literally like just buy Ellie's regardless and here's my point about that is I was I was just

[15:26] interested when I went into the dead pool owners club because there's an owners club on pinside I was really shocked at the amount of people that were like I'm in on an

[15:37] Ellie I want an Ellie I'm buying an Ellie I got an Ellie and I'm thinking of myself wow like that's cool like all these people are getting deadpool

[15:44] Ellie's and then I thought to myself and none of them have played the game like none of them like they they literally have not played the game once

[15:54] They have one stream from Jack Danger and these and all these people are forking over nine thousand dollars to get a game

[16:04] that they don't even know the like when they flip it and I have to say that's genius marketing by Stern the fact that you can get people

[16:14] to already commit to something they've never even played continues to be the greatest marketing I've ever seen in in in in a non-essential toy I mean literally the amount of people they don't know if they're gonna like it or not

[16:29] And they're just in on it and I think part of it is because when people are fans of a property like deadpool

[16:35] They might just want it they might have seen something that they liked in the stream that just convinced them

[16:40] But for the most part I think the Ellie's are part of the fear of missing out and you don't want you know

[16:45] You don't want to have to like miss you know see their sold out them pay more

[16:48] But here's another interesting thing too because on one side of the fence

[16:53] You've got the Ellie people who are just I'm all in I've never played it and then I was reading about someone who's actually played the game right there

[17:00] Someone posted on pin side a

[17:03] Story about how they played it or their friends played it it's out in the wild now and they reported that the game was really easy

[17:11] That they that they got to two billion points eat you know in the game

[17:14] They saw the ending of the game multiple times that though there was really really long ball times that on

[17:20] Location the game is not gonna do great because of that all this stuff

[17:23] I don't know you know sometimes you have great games sometimes you have terrible games in pinball

[17:27] I think it's really hard to say you know your first five flips are indicative of how every game is gonna be

[17:33] So let's just you know take that with the grain of salt but but you know what I'm saying is like the reviews of of

[17:39] Deadpool are not even really out yet and we have like a mixed bag and

[17:44] Even though the reviews aren't out people already committed to 9k so that that to me

[17:50] I think speaks volumes about the reality of pinball is you really don't even need to make a great game

[17:57] Maybe as long as it looks great people are gonna go in on it. I mean is that true to our hobby?

[18:02] I would have thought by now

[18:05] With the sheer volume of games coming out with the sheer number of games

[18:09] You know manufacturers are offering with the sheer number of barcades and pinball shows and pinball tournaments

[18:16] Happening around the country. I would have thought by now people would have been a little bit more

[18:22] hesitant to run into every new game and I would have thought people would have wanted to play stuff more

[18:28] Before they commit to it, but I

[18:31] Guess this just shows that people in this hobby

[18:34] They either have a lot of money and don't care and they just I can just buy the next thing and you know

[18:39] Buying a $9,000 toy me is absolutely nothing in my world. So you've got those people

[18:44] I think people are also you know they get bored of their games and they want new stuff

[18:48] I mean that's another part of pinball is it's just a game

[18:52] It's rare that you would play a video game non-stop for years. I think people do get bored of pinball

[18:58] I think it's something that people don't like to admit happens in pinball is that a game gets old and

[19:04] It gets stale and there is a desire just to have something new and fresh

[19:08] I think people are addicted in today's world to opening boxes like there is just this

[19:13] This Amazon culture of like new box. It's here. It's Christmas morning in August because Deadpool arrived and I think there's a lot of that

[19:22] I think there's also just a level of

[19:27] Excitement around anything new in the pinball world that makes people want to say I have it like there's a little bit of

[19:32] There's a little bit of forum

[19:35] Cloud you get when you can announce that you're in on it like you become part of a club

[19:39] I mean, and it's and that's part of like what hobbies are right? It's like all of a sudden

[19:43] I am now part of the Deadpool club. I am now part of the Batman club

[19:47] I am now part of the Pirate of the Caribbean club and I will convince you the game is great

[19:52] That's the other thing too that I love about this hobby is whenever people get a game

[19:55] It's always the same thing. I got the game and the game is great

[19:59] You don't know what you're talking about rob zombie is awesome

[20:04] My name is rodo david. I'm traveling around the world and I'm gonna open up a thread every time I go anywhere

[20:10] You know, it's always the same bullshit. No one ever buys a game and it's like you know this game sucks

[20:14] You know, I really wish more people would be honest like I just went in on this game

[20:19] I paid nine grand it arrived and I realized I made a big fucking mistake now

[20:25] We realize that happens all the time when people put their games up for sale and they're always like great game

[20:30] I love it game is awesome

[20:32] You know less than 200 plays, but will you please take it off my hands?

[20:36] Will you please buy it off me and I guarantee you it's mint. It's new unbox game is great. Game is great

[20:41] I don't really want it. I'm selling it

[20:43] You know, it's like that's usually how we get people to be somewhat honest about the fact that they don't like a game

[20:49] um

[20:50] So yeah, so like I think Stern will continue to have this formula

[20:55] And I think we'll see it all over again when when monsters Ellie comes out

[20:59] But it's just it's just an interesting thing to think about is how they're able to do this in in a world where we're

[21:05] Test driving games is pretty easy, all right now speaking of test driving games

[21:11] Chicago gaming company has put a call to action

[21:16] They are looking for people to help them test monster bash remake because they want to make sure

[21:23] When they release this game that they didn't miss anything

[21:27] Uh, what nobody at Chicago like Chicago gaming company is not filled with people who understand pinball who can play pinball

[21:35] It's a really kind of strange request. I mean it. I think it's part of their marketing

[21:39] You know, they want people to come in they want them to sign non disclosure agreements

[21:43] And they want them to sort of you know beat on the game for a few hours and let them know if anything pops up

[21:49] I think this is more of a marketing move than I think it's an actual quality control test

[21:54] You can't tell me that they haven't been doing this themselves for months like what's a few hours with a guy like hilton like

[22:02] You know like pelvis thrusting the machine gonna do are you if you're gonna find something out that you missed?

[22:07] I don't think so I think they actually want like 20 people to come through there

[22:13] 20 people to sign NDAs and then say I saw it. It's amazing, but I can't tell you exactly

[22:18] You know, it's like they want to create I don't know maybe some hype

[22:22] So look I've got one of my list is on my show emailed me that he's actually gonna go and look at the machine

[22:28] I asked him to come on and talk about it after the experience once the NDA is lifted

[22:33] But let's be honest with this machine is it an NDA to see monster bash remake like we already know what the freaking machine is

[22:41] We know it's gonna have a big display. We know it's gonna have a fancy topper

[22:45] Why the fact that they they're like releasing this thing in this like slowly teased out like

[22:54] I think it's I think it's a lame release. I mean, I want to talk to these guys

[22:58] You see how it is on this podcast. I I love that you guys listen. I can no one will talk to me

[23:02] No one will talk to me anymore because I I think I'm being honest and

[23:07] Look you do you think the monster bash remake like reveal has been good like they they literally

[23:13] They missed every major show

[23:15] They they then they come out and they just announced that the game. Hey guys the game you've been room like speculating is actually real like

[23:24] How bad is this launch? I mean at the end of the day stern pinball has shown everybody had a launch a pinball machine

[23:31] And it's not difficult. Hey, here's what you do guys

[23:34] You reveal it you pull the curtain off it and you say it's shipping in two weeks order now

[23:40] And what happens you make a successful pinball company when you do it that way

[23:44] Everyone else who's done it differently has failed has failed to deliver. I mean people forget do people forget

[23:52] That Jersey Jack Jersey Jack was bailed out twice the company shouldn't even be around unless they were bailed out

[23:59] Twice like their model didn't work. You know take all this pre order money make people wait for two years three years

[24:05] Yeah, it doesn't work. It just doesn't work

[24:09] And this stern model is the best model the stern model

[24:13] It you know who came up with the model that stern is now implementing a little company that's been somewhat successful in the world

[24:20] They go by the name of apple

[24:22] And apple really changed the way technology products

[24:27] Were revealed to the world they would show you a new iPhone and it would be on sale

[24:31] Very soon because they knew that if you could get people excited and and actually take their money and get them the product

[24:38] In a short window you'd be super successful and and stern is doing that brilliantly right now brilliantly

[24:46] So look, I mean do I do I care that CGC is doing this? No, I hope they find the quirks

[24:54] The question is when do they release now

[24:57] When this is company release this game. I mean, I think the closer they get to expo and the closer they get to monsters coming out

[25:03] Probably not the best timing for them. I think they kind of

[25:07] Fucked up their release window. They were really hoping to show this game at tpf and have games shipping by now

[25:14] And I just don't know if they have a strategy. I do believe that they're waiting on the licensor for approval

[25:21] I don't I just don't buy that I

[25:24] Prove prove white you remade the game

[25:28] Well, you haven't really changed anything. You've only added good things to it

[25:32] So how would a licensor look at him? You're like, you know, I'm not really happy with all the major improvements

[25:37] You've made to this game. I want you to go back and make it the way it originally was made

[25:41] That wasn't as good as what you just did like come on

[25:44] This thing feels like it would be approved in like five seconds like literally

[25:49] I think they're waiting for a window and I think they're just trying to figure out like what makes sense um again

[25:55] Happy for them to come on the show clarify everything and let me know all right

[26:00] Speaking of waiting for things the Star Wars topper there's an update

[26:05] There is an update and it is not the update you want to hear so apparently there's a thread

[26:11] Dedicated solely to the Star Wars topper now it has been over a year a year and like a c-

[26:18] It's been like a year and two months since people have their Star Wars machines

[26:23] And there is still no Star Wars topper and we know the topper was supposed to be part of the game

[26:29] It's actually in the code. It's in the menu system of the game

[26:33] And somebody revealed what jody all right jody dankberg of stern pimple told them this and I want to read this word for word

[26:44] I was told in January

[26:46] 2018 at ces by jody of stern pimple that the topper was in final review with disney and would be available spring of

[26:56] 2018

[26:57] He said the topper is the rear section of lux x-wing with a very chatty and interactive r2 sitting in the back

[27:05] Well, here it is now approaching fall and still nothing. Yeah, so

[27:09] I don't know what the big guy like I I have no idea

[27:12] I've no idea. I think the Star Wars topper has become the white whale of the pimple hobby

[27:18] pardon me feels like stern is probably just moved on

[27:20] They've sold all the Star Wars you guys gave stern all your money and are they really gonna if this thing's become a headache

[27:26] I don't know if they even still care about trying to get it approved

[27:31] Why would it take a year to get a topper approved that just seems like aesonine but it is what it is

[27:37] There's your update. It was supposed to be out by now. It's still not out now all right

[27:42] What else is going on on this episode of canada's pimple podcast? So that's pretty much the news

[27:48] Not too much other than you know the rest of the stuff we've been talking about

[27:53] I did want to address one one thing that I alluded to at the beginning of this podcast

[27:58] That I wasn't even going to address

[28:00] I didn't even want to um talk about because

[28:04] It just is what it is and and I don't want to even like reveal private conversations

[28:09] I've been having with people on this show. I don't think that's fair

[28:12] But a few people have come to me

[28:14] Maybe more than a few and said you know what what's the deal with zombie yeti and and and he's been posting that he's not doing anymore pinball podcasts

[28:24] You know, I saw another pinball podcast

[28:26] Get this all wrong

[28:28] They were talking about how they think I was nasty and that's why he's taking this approach and I just want to

[28:36] Tell my side of this story and just clear the air a little bit because I think it's important and I think people

[28:42] You know shouldn't be making assumptions and I think this whole thing this whole with this

[28:47] ridiculous drama that is unnecessary

[28:50] Um is rooted in a lot of people jumping to conclusions and making assumptions about things that just aren't correct

[28:57] And and I want to I want to start out by saying that if you've listened to this podcast and you followed my show

[29:05] You have seen me do nothing nothing

[29:08] But praise the artwork of mr. Jeremy Packer and zombie yeti. I mean go back and listen

[29:14] I literally said I think he's created the nicest pinball artwork that has ever been on a machine ever in deadpool

[29:21] I think his package is on ghost busters and on iron maiden

[29:26] Again are some of the nicest pinball artwork we ever have had

[29:30] I think his artwork on magic girl and and raza and Alice in Wonderland speak for themselves as being

[29:36] Ridiculously incredible. So look at the end of the day

[29:40] I've nothing but respect for Jeremy. I know he's a nice guy. He's a very passionate guy

[29:43] He's an artist, you know an artist are are people who throw their heart and soul into their projects

[29:49] And I know it's hard when he works so hard on stuff and people like make negative comments about it

[29:55] But I think you know at the end of the day

[29:58] Who could do better than him if anyone is insulting his artwork could do better?

[30:03] Please raise your hand and again you'd see no hands go up

[30:07] So, you know what would have been on this show and the reason I just made my comments and again

[30:12] I thought I made them very respectfully was just like I do interviews and and you know

[30:17] I'm not going to interview someone right after they've done another show

[30:20] It was I wasn't nasty go back and listen to what I said

[30:23] I know hard feelings. I'm not I'm not upset

[30:26] You know, I I didn't say anything nasty about about Jeremy and and I think there was also just a lot of

[30:33] Miscommunication or assumptions that were happening so when I took my break in pinball

[30:39] And this was like remember when I went off the air for a few months and I just I just had enough

[30:44] I also just had enough of like having like hundreds and hundreds of people that I just you know

[30:48] Didn't know or and I didn't want pinball in my stream anymore on

[30:52] On Facebook and all my and all my different social channels

[30:55] So I just like I got rid of like a lot of people in the pinball industry and a lot of people who follow me from my arcade story

[31:01] on Facebook

[31:03] Uh, and that was a while ago, all right, and that's just because I didn't want to see updates on pinball

[31:08] I want to just have a clean break. Okay now

[31:11] What happened is as I think that

[31:14] Jeremy thinks I unfriended him because he did another person's podcast and then he gets he got mad at me

[31:21] man did he come to me and ask me if that's what happened? No, he just got mad and

[31:26] I can't control that you know

[31:28] I can't control someone if someone has an issue with me

[31:31] If someone thinks I did something I mean just come to me, you know

[31:35] Don't don't get mad and and go to other people and and say you know

[31:39] I'm evil. I did something wrong or I you know

[31:41] I didn't do that like I and and what what was a shock to me

[31:46] Is I've always been very friendly with Jeremy and I've always been a huge supporter of his and I've always had nothing but good

[31:53] conversations with him

[31:55] On text message and in personal conversations, you know, I've always highly supported him

[32:01] You know, I you know, I want to tell you guys something you know who bought

[32:05] His translate prototype off of eBay when you know when Jeremy was like

[32:09] I'm selling this because I worked really hard on John's projects and and and this was to support him

[32:15] I paid $3,000 for a translate to support him in his work like I believe in the man and and so

[32:23] It kind of sucked. I mean he he came at me with a lot of anger and a lot of vitriol

[32:29] And made a lot of assumptions that just weren't true like I've I've never

[32:34] Called him any of the things that he says I called him and I and I and I said to him

[32:39] Is it Jeremy? I'd never said these things to you about you and he said they were implied and again

[32:43] That's that's the part that just sucks is

[32:47] I don't think you can come to the conclusion

[32:51] That I implied you were this or you were that the only thing Jeremy that I was implying

[32:57] Was that you're in demand and a lot of people want to talk to you and that's a good thing

[33:02] And the reason they want to talk to you is because you're the best pinball artist

[33:07] I think pinball is ever seen

[33:09] And that means a lot of people want you on their shows

[33:12] But you know, we also do pinball podcasts where if you're doing a two-hour interview with someone

[33:18] It doesn't really give me much news to talk about and that's the only reason why I I didn't

[33:24] Want to do the interview after that. I wasn't upset and I think too

[33:28] There's just this

[33:30] This unfortunate thing that happens in this hobby where you know people in this hobby

[33:36] Oftentimes don't go directly to the person they're upset with or they don't try to

[33:43] Find out what actually is going on behind the scenes you know, it's the same way

[33:48] You know the other

[33:49] Pinball podcasts out there

[33:51] Can can just immediately say hey like you know, let's drain the pinball podcast that is nasty does on be yeti

[33:59] And I'm gonna drain that because what we don't need that in pinball and and we're not we're not a pinball podcast that exists to be nasty

[34:05] We're we're here to tell like come on like you want to talk shit about canators pinball podcasts

[34:12] Then talk shit to me, but that's the thing is they they can they've got to indirectly and passive aggressively mention this show

[34:19] Mention my name and I love it to how they're like well

[34:22] We're not trying to just get listeners by being negative and I tell you right now

[34:26] And I'm gonna call you out by name special when lit

[34:30] Can a dis pinball podcast doesn't have listeners because we are just

[34:34] Negative we don't have listeners because we're just trying to be controversial or trying to be provocative

[34:41] I wish that people would finally just accept the fact that the reason this podcast has listeners is because we're entertaining

[34:49] And because we speak

[34:51] With a strong point of view and an unfiltered

[34:55] Dialogue about pinball that most of you will never do and the reason why you can't do it because if you do do it

[35:02] You're not gonna get all your stern buddies to come on you're not gonna get your friends at Jersey Jack to come on and look

[35:09] That's just the direction I wanted to take this show is I just give a personal opinion about pinball

[35:15] But it's not a necessary. It's not random nastiness and and that's just the thing

[35:21] It's it's like it's cool. It's cool that you guys do your thing

[35:24] It's cool that Ryan and Marty do their thing. You know, I got other people asking me too

[35:27] It's like why is Ryan always throwing you under the bus on pinside when you're always telling us your friends

[35:34] And my answer to you guys is this I don't know I don't know

[35:38] I have a really good relationship with Ryan and then I do see what he posts about me on pinside

[35:43] And it it is a little strange to me that he like won't say my name that like is constantly like in a little bit of a combative nature

[35:50] With the show and I don't I don't know maybe you know, maybe the Marty laughs

[35:56] Maybe they upset him a little bit and that's why he does it

[35:59] But at the end of the day, you know, I'm friends with Ryan

[36:03] You know and we talk all the time and and I don't take it personally. It's a pinball podcast

[36:08] And and I I really do I really do want to say to zombie Eddie if anything I said offended you

[36:14] I'm sorry

[36:15] I don't think you should leave pinball and refuse to talk to other people about your pinball artwork

[36:21] Because it is an interesting story, you know, and that's it. There's no harsh feelings. There's no bad blood and

[36:29] And the pettiness and the drama often time occurs

[36:33] Because people just don't go to the people they have issues with and and and so it's

[36:38] Escalates and assumptions get made and then there's a lot of

[36:42] anger that builds that's unnecessary like he could have asked me straight up

[36:47] Like did you unfriend me on Facebook because I did head-to-head pinball interview and I want to told them no

[36:54] Because that's the truth

[36:56] But instead it's like he's mad and then off on a crusade against me

[37:01] So I just can't I can't change that all mean all I can do is tell people what actually happened and and move on

[37:08] So I hope you respect that answer

[37:10] I respect all the other podcasts that are out there. I'm not sure they all respect me and that's fine

[37:17] I would happily have any them on as guests

[37:20] You know, and that's just the way it is and I think the reason you listen to this podcast is because

[37:24] I'm completely transparent when these matters happen. So that's it right it's pinball

[37:32] We don't need people going nuts none of it's worth it none of it is really worth it

[37:37] I do I think people who get bent out of shape in this hobby just need a break

[37:42] And I think Jeremy probably just needs a break from it

[37:45] But he doesn't need to you know, he doesn't need to point at things like pod like as the reason why I think he just needs a break

[37:52] Probably needs a vacation. It's not easy doing what he does. It's not easy

[37:57] Having people tear your work down after you spent so so long and on it and those people couldn't draw a fucking stick figure like I get it

[38:05] I mean I we all have other areas our life that stresses out too like stuff has gone on in my personal life in the last couple weeks that if you like that means so much more

[38:16] to me than pinball

[38:19] But I promise you I am not I am not trying to push like personalities out of this hobby by being nasty

[38:27] And you know my assessment on like pirate to the Caribbean that is it nasty

[38:32] No, I'm allowed to critique these machines. I don't have to love everything

[38:38] I think pinball is great, but I also think pinball can be better than it is and and and and sometimes that just means making

[38:47] Pinball get back to what made it so great I do I think a lot of people get ambitious with pinball

[38:53] And then they're not necessarily understanding what makes pinball great and the simple fun that the games of the 90s had

[39:00] And and and that is where we're at people are trying to figure out how did they make those games so great

[39:06] And how can we make future games equally as good without a company like Valley Williams who we all know

[39:13] Made the greatest pinball machines of all time. All right, everyone

[39:16] That's it. I'm going to work. I got I got to make a paycheck so I can afford pinball

[39:21] Hit me up at canada pinball gmail.com

[39:23] Thank you again for listening to this show

[39:26] I know I rant I rave I talk about things. I don't always say what's popular

[39:31] But I I hope you feel that this is not just like the nasty pinball podcast

[39:37] I think we we try to be balanced and fair about how we talk about this hobby if you disagree

[39:43] If you disagree come on the show talk about it. Let me tell you how many times people disagree with me that actually want to come on the show

[39:52] Like one or two guests actually came on and stood up for what they believed if they thought I was such a bad member of the pinball hobby

[40:00] So I the door is open everyone can come through it. You know anyone who wants to talk about this show

[40:05] Or me or or how they think I'm a bad influence on the hobby come come on be a man

[40:12] All right, I will happily go on any of your shows and talk pinball with you and you'll see what'll happen

[40:17] It'll be a great dialogue. I guarantee you it'll be one of the best interviews you had I told this to Ryan

[40:23] I'm like, you know Ryan you can interview everyone in pinball

[40:25] But you know canada is gonna be more entertaining than all these like two hour conversations about you know how do you get into pinball?

[40:33] Who cares later everyone

[40:48] But if you believe broken heart

[40:55] Wouldn't time me out

[41:06] I
