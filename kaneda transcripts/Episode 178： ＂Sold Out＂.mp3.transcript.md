[00:00] Here my here my here my skin it is you do this back may back

[00:05] This back to the whole well a truth is back you ain't got to argue about who could

[00:10] rat because the proof is back so do my rap

[00:19] Welcome to episode 178 of canada's pinball podcast on your host canada

[00:24] It's Friday here in New York City

[00:26] What does that mean it means we're gonna give you a fun podcast to go into the week and I'm excited for something going on in my own

[00:34] Pinball world

[00:34] I can't quite share all the news of what's going on

[00:38] But I will shortly but I will shortly but I'll say this what I've been saying for the past few weeks about

[00:44] changing my direction

[00:46] It's gonna come true. It's gonna come true

[00:48] I'm gonna finally have a pinball machine that I can play in my apartment

[00:53] I'm looking forward to that moment again where the ball plunges it goes up the playfield and I can actually do things

[01:01] Versus just look at beautiful lights

[01:04] But more to come on that more to come on that so what I want to talk about on this episode of canada's pinball podcast a few things

[01:11] I want to give you my

[01:13] Overall sort of recap of my feelings of

[01:17] Guardian for the galaxy at IAPA we saw some new information since we last spoke

[01:22] We're gonna talk a little bit about Jersey Jack pinball and in sort of a conversation going on over there

[01:28] And then I want to talk a little bit about

[01:31] the notion of pinball machines selling out and and how that friends

[01:36] He has sort of changed a little bit recently and then in just a few random thoughts here and there about other things going on in the hobby

[01:44] All right, are you ready Friday should we do it all right?

[01:47] Let's talk about Guardians of the galaxy because this pin was shown at IAPA

[01:52] I think by now most of us out there have seen a whole bunch of footage right and we've seen the game being played

[01:58] We've seen

[02:00] Different cell phone footage some people have actually hooked up what looks like to be go pros to the apron of the machine and gave us some high

[02:08] Definition gameplay footage

[02:10] I've seen a lot. I've seen about a half hour and I have to say

[02:14] I have to say

[02:15] Coming out of all the footage. I don't know about you. I don't know about maybe this is just me

[02:21] But I'm sort of just left feeling a little bit like

[02:24] You know what I'll wait for more I'll wait for more. This is a machine

[02:29] Where more than most new Stern releases where people went crazy

[02:33] I think this is a machine where I'm really going to have to wait and play it to make sure I enjoy it

[02:40] Because I'm not seeing anything right now that says yes take my money

[02:45] And it's interesting right because when I saw the photos of Guardians of the galaxy

[02:50] I think I was far more excited when I first saw like those high-res images of the playfield with with with Groot and all the colors

[02:58] I was a little bit more excited after that than I was after the footage from IAPA

[03:04] And I think the reason why is there's not really anything new going on in the game

[03:09] And I think we all can agree that it's got a little bit of Metallica a little bit of Iron Man

[03:14] But it's it's another fan layout Stern game

[03:18] Okay, so if the layout's not drastically different and then there's not a lot of like whoa my god wow going on

[03:26] Then you look to other things in the game you look to the LCD screen you look to the theme integration

[03:32] And you know what it's sort of still in the oven this game

[03:35] It's not fully baked the way I look at it right the they're still getting the call outs in it

[03:41] They're still getting a music into the game the music is not really fully integrated into the machine yet

[03:47] So there's a lot there's a lot still going on this with this machine that

[03:52] Is yet to be determined I think a lot of people I think the consensus right now

[03:59] Is that the LCD screen isn't really blowing people away and Stern is still trying to

[04:05] Figure out how to utilize the LCD screen right it seems like every game

[04:11] they take a different approach with the screen and

[04:14] The the overall sentiment and I hear this from many people is that the Stern LCD

[04:21] Integration it just lacks consistency and I hear that word consistency over and over again

[04:27] When you look at Jersey Jack when you look at what they do with the LCD screen and you look at how

[04:32] The hobbit is and how wizard of os is and and how dialed in is

[04:37] It's much more consistent how they integrate onto the screen right with Stern

[04:42] It just feels like there's all this randomness you go from clips you go from animation

[04:48] You have things flying in and out, but it doesn't really

[04:52] Feel like a singular design and I think that's what Stern's biggest mistake is I think Stern's best machine to date

[04:59] Which I think is the most consistent

[05:01] Use of the LCD is aero smith and I think all that comes down to is Stern needs to invest in more programmers and people who can

[05:09] Design for the LCD. I think that needs to be like someone's full-time job is to be LCD integration all right

[05:17] Okay now okay, so I think that Guardians is a game that a lot of people need to play before they decide they want to own it

[05:23] Wow, you know news flash we all should do that on every game ever like we never should be buying these

[05:28] Expensive pinball machines because of a photograph or because of a theme without ever flipping it

[05:34] The other thing we got and this was Stern sort of revealed this during ioppa

[05:40] Was what the Guardians accessory package will look like say we saw the topper

[05:45] I have to say like I was like expecting this topper to be like oh my god like this topper is the greatest topper of all time

[05:52] And it's a nice topper it fits the theme

[05:55] It's got the Guardians and like this like shadowy silhouette in the middle

[05:59] It's got the sort of like hexagon colored

[06:03] Objects to the left and right and it looks like it lights up in the middle

[06:07] Uh is so if we were to rank Stern toppers in terms of which are the coolest

[06:12] I still think you have to put Batman 66 topper at the top

[06:16] I think then you go on to I think stuff like game of thrones is really cool the ghost busters one is and interesting

[06:23] I just like toppers that have some sort of movement on them though

[06:26] This one looks a little bit more like a laser-rific sort of clean approach to toppers

[06:31] We also saw the armor that comes in both gold and black that has the cutout like the Guardians cutout now

[06:38] I've been told that the there will be black vinyl behind the armor so that the artwork won't stick through or shine through

[06:47] Where the armor's cut so that'll make it

[06:50] Look nice and clean then we have the the Groot head as the shooter rod

[06:55] And then here is another thing that's confusing we saw the inner art decals now

[06:59] When Stern put up a picture of the pro machine with all the accessories on it by the way

[07:05] We're gonna talk about this in a second, but how good does the pro look? I mean it it looks amazing

[07:11] When you look at that picture

[07:13] Inside the inner art decals the art blades

[07:17] The art blades on that machine when we look at the

[07:20] The full machine itself are different than the art blades Stern is selling separately

[07:27] The ones on the machine look really cool right? It's sort of got the star lord on one side is it is a Thanos on the other and it's got sort of like this

[07:35] This blue sort of space sort of environment and it's sort of it's like awesome looking and then the ones that stern is saying are the side blades

[07:45] It's like just those colored hexagons is that the right shape hexagon? It's like a six-sided figure is it a sect?

[07:52] I don't know I'm bad at geometry

[07:55] Which don't look as cool as the other one so my my mind is like well, which one is it which one is it?

[08:01] um

[08:02] Overall overall

[08:04] I think the Guardians machine is gorgeous looking. I think it's a very nice package

[08:08] But Stern made one big mistake one fatal flaw in how they've launched guardians

[08:15] They made the pro version of the machine by far look the best and and that I think should be switched

[08:23] It's too late to switch it. It's already they're already on the line

[08:26] The problem is they made the pro look the best the pro has the best art package by far

[08:32] Ah the pro machine is so much cheaper, but actually looks better than the $9,000 limited edition

[08:40] If I were getting a guardians and this is why it's like oh you can't quite get everything you want

[08:45] I think the pro with like the armor and the topper

[08:49] You're out you're out the door so much cheaper than even a premium

[08:54] Uh, and I think that's kind of like the way to go on this machine

[08:56] I think there's a reason why the ellies have not sold out if Stern had the pro artwork on the elli

[09:05] With the cutout armor as standard elli features

[09:09] I think you see more of those 600 ellies flying out the door now

[09:13] I've checked in with a few distributors. All right, and the word is

[09:17] The ellies are not selling that fast. They're not selling out

[09:22] Now we're gonna talk a little bit about what that means a little bit later

[09:25] But when a game like this with a theme like this when it doesn't sell out quickly

[09:32] If you're in the marketing department at Stern you have to realize like yeah

[09:36] Maybe we should have done something a little bit differently if I were doing things differently

[09:40] I'd have that pro artwork on the elli and I'd have much less ellies

[09:45] There's too many of them 600 just it's just a matter of like it just doesn't feel special

[09:49] It's just it's just too many of them all right

[09:52] All right, so that's guardians. I think advice to everybody is to jump on it play it see if you like it

[10:00] The code where will it be right?

[10:03] We'll probably see updated code when jack danger flips the machine on November 20th

[10:09] Still kind of funny that he's been completely scooped by all of this

[10:12] But I think starting to give him like new code. I mean that'll be his exclusive reveal

[10:16] So we look forward to that jack can't wait to see it

[10:19] All right, so also at the show and we mentioned this last time

[10:23] Was Jersey Jack Pimble and I was watching

[10:26] My good friend Charles Thomas's

[10:28] Video footage of of he's doing Facebook live from iapa and and Roger sharp was on the machine wearing a white suit

[10:36] He reminded me of of god in the morgan in morgan freeman sort of god and in brusol mighty

[10:42] But Roger is Roger almighty. I mean he's the man that saved pinball so he can wear he can wear all white and be bowed down to at any

[10:50] Pinball event he goes to so it was fun saying that it was fun saying jack

[10:55] uh

[10:56] So Jersey Jack Pimble and I and I've been discussing like where does pirates fit into all this and

[11:03] At the you know right now we're at a period where I think a lot of people are sort of stepping back saying okay

[11:10] There's Houdini coming out. There's pirates. There's guardians of the galaxy stern batman is getting good code improvements

[11:18] There's star wars

[11:20] There's attack from ours remake. There's probably going to be monster bash remake

[11:24] There there's all this stuff coming out right dialed in is on code 1.5

[11:28] I think everyone sort of like I should just I don't know where to go

[11:33] I don't know what to get next and pirate to the Caribbean

[11:36] I mean it came out at expo with so much fanfare and obviously the height begins to die down because we've seen it

[11:43] There's like nothing new to show

[11:44] There wasn't new code at iapa

[11:47] What's the only thing left for people to do is actually play the machine now

[11:51] I've heard from my people on the ground who played both guardians and pirates of the Caribbean

[11:56] I've heard from people that just say you know what it's just in another league like pirates is just in another league of its own

[12:04] You can't really compare the two

[12:06] Compared to uh

[12:08] Pirates guardians feels cheap feels like a stern and we hear that complaint all the time and you know I've made those

[12:15] Those observations before

[12:17] But you know what at the end of the day right? It's like which one's gonna be more fun

[12:21] And that's yet to be determined now

[12:23] I hear a rumor from the show is that jersey jack pinball is going to make after toy story

[12:30] Willy Wonka

[12:31] Willy Wonka right Charlie in the chocolate factory is rumored to be the pin that will come out after toy story

[12:38] And I'm always sort of trying to figure out

[12:41] I've been debating back and forth with my boy Ryan over there in Australia about whether or not

[12:46] I think Willy Wonka is a good theme for pinball and he's telling me it's gonna

[12:50] It would sell like hotcakes like everyone would make you know

[12:53] Everyone's wives would make them go get it and this and that and this and that

[12:58] And I don't know. I mean it is an iconic movie. It is classic. I would say yes

[13:05] I willy Wonka machine from the original film would be incredible

[13:09] But but only if and this is a big only if only if

[13:13] They could use all the footage

[13:16] From the film and they could use all the theme integration necessary to make that game come to life

[13:22] Including the music including call outs everything needs to be there

[13:27] I think it's an old IP. So I'm assuming it should be easier

[13:31] But here's the thing with pirates and there's a dark cloud hanging over pirates with a Caribbean and I

[13:38] I think it's going to keep people a little bit anxious about going in on one and that is how well

[13:45] Is the theme gonna be integrated because

[13:49] When you go play Guardians of the Galaxy and you have clips from the movie and you have

[13:55] um, you know you have the music playing with cherry bomb and hooked on a feeling

[14:01] It it it brings that Guardians world to life nicely, okay?

[14:06] Now

[14:07] When it comes to Guardians the galaxy

[14:10] The the only thing that still a question is like the call outs are gonna be voice actors

[14:15] They're not gonna be anyone from the movie. So I think that's a knock against theme integration

[14:21] And so you know, there's just two songs

[14:24] But still like that's better than nothing and it actually has the original score of Guardians

[14:29] With pirates of the Caribbean

[14:31] The music will not be from the movies but inspired by the movies and adjusted to work better for a pinball game

[14:39] That's what we're being told

[14:41] There is a touch of licensed music but not from the pirate's movies

[14:46] Kind of strange, right? Like what are they licensing from that's not from the franchise itself

[14:53] There's gonna be movie clips and plenty of them, but they just will never show in actors face

[14:59] So this this whole thing this whole thing has me a little bit nervous about okay

[15:04] So what exactly is going to be up on the screen?

[15:07] How do you bring five movies to life with absolutely no

[15:13] Facial clips of the actors like no scenes with the actors in it and I think people are kind of bummed out because

[15:21] When you look at the hobbit and what made the hobbit so

[15:25] You know, what made the saving grace of the hobbit if you were to argue there is one right is

[15:31] The theme integration and all the clips from the film they do such a great job

[15:36] In bringing the hobbit to life now, you know, bringing a bad movie to life

[15:40] Doesn't make it a good game, but it's still much better than what we're gonna get with pirates of the Caribbean

[15:46] You know, is it gonna be mostly the map up there and how are they gonna bring it to life?

[15:50] It's also a little bit confusing because why can't they show the actors faces from the films yet the actors faces are all over the game

[15:59] When you select your character

[16:01] I mean, it's clearly that Disney sign the worst contracts in the world with these actors and Johnny Depp still owns everything

[16:08] Even though Disney paid him 35 million per movie all right

[16:13] so

[16:15] I want to read something from Pinside

[16:17] L.T.G. who's like pretty much J.J. P's tech support guy really great guy

[16:22] Pinsider a Pinsider wrote

[16:24] Let me I want to read this I want to get full screen here a Pinsider

[16:29] psw757 wrote

[16:32] Would just be nice to see an MFG go

[16:35] Manufacture go all in on whatever it takes to secure all licenses and make it a true collector's edition and charge whatever it takes

[16:43] And then L.T.G. times in and says but the cost would be horrendous you have to deal with each individual actor actress

[16:50] All right, and then it's like times that by 23 and then there are attorneys

[16:55] Then show one of the 23 parts the Disney audio or video and Disney says no

[17:00] You know then try and fix whatever to get it in or delete it. This isn't hundreds more per game

[17:05] This is thousands more per game if this could have been done reasonable

[17:10] I'm sure Jersey jack pinball would have done it as it is J.J.P. is working with what they have and some of the best people

[17:16] There was

[17:17] Are ever are doing it and we are working hard to make a great game

[17:22] All right, and then someone said Pinsider

[17:25] Vino said then why revisit it and that's the question I have is like why would you make pirates of the Caribbean?

[17:32] Why would you revisit this title that has already been made and Jack himself knew the hurdles

[17:38] That stern face when they made this game and it was the same issue like they couldn't use Johnny depth in the in really in the callouts or

[17:44] In the game very much they could just put his image on the cabinet and it none of the actors were in the game

[17:50] So you basically go after a title that has so many hurdles and red tape for theme integration

[17:57] So why do it again? I don't get it. I see see I still don't get it because

[18:03] Nothing what they tell me make sense because couldn't you have made a game that had a lot more in it

[18:11] That didn't have all these restrictions and wouldn't that have been a better choice

[18:16] But then J.J.

[18:18] L.T.G. says something interesting so when someone said then why revisit

[18:23] L.T.G. says there were other reasons in the deal

[18:27] Okay, and then someone said J.J.P. must have known what direction they were going in

[18:32] And then

[18:33] L.T.G. said probably not until design and planning started

[18:38] And how to work around it as would be no said and then L.T.G. said you know they got higher praise

[18:44] So the issue is what I don't know. I'm my only guess is that

[18:49] Jack has sort of

[18:50] signed a multiple

[18:52] Game deal with Disney and I think pirate is probably part of the deal

[18:56] pirates toy story and whatever else he's planning

[19:01] So I don't have all the answers

[19:04] I think this is going to be interesting to see how this game develops

[19:09] We know the shots are there we know the engineering is there we know the technology is there

[19:13] We know the game look sweet the game shoot sweet

[19:17] But how will this theme be integrated right now? It's looking like this will be the most challenging game

[19:24] for Jersey Jack Pimball in terms of theme integration

[19:27] And part of me the marketer and me and I keep going back to this

[19:31] I'm a little bit sad that Eric had to make a game

[19:34] Where so many of the assets that would bring the theme to life are going to be kept from the overall experience

[19:41] You apply this talents to a franchise and a property that pretty much tied one hand behind his back

[19:48] And I hope it works out. I still think the game is incredible

[19:53] But I think it's going to keep people waiting on the sidelines until they see how this game develops a little bit more

[20:00] And and that's just you know that's it's you I mean Star Wars has

[20:05] All the actors Star Wars has all the clips from the movie Star Wars has the music

[20:09] How can Stern put the John Williams score into Star Wars and Jersey Jack can't get the score to pirates into the machine

[20:16] Which cost even more I think that's the overall point this person's making is

[20:20] You can't tell me the Star Wars music is more expensive than the theme song to pirate to the Caribbean

[20:27] And that's the part that is

[20:30] Unfortunate is we were able to compare these machines apples to apples and Stern went and got what they knew you wanted

[20:39] Into their machine and Stern got music into guardians and Jersey Jack has no music

[20:46] Not even just the score into pirates of the Caribbean and I and I think that's that's a negative for people

[20:51] All right

[20:52] For those of you on the northeast

[20:54] That want to check out pirate to the Caribbean there's going to be a launch party

[20:59] Joe Newhart at pinball star is going to do it

[21:02] It's going to be Saturday December 9th between noon and 4 p.m. At pinball gallery in Malvern, PA

[21:10] All right, he's gonna have a pirate to the Caribbean there

[21:13] He'll have some other Jersey Jack machines there

[21:16] That's really cool if you guys are near that area on some on Saturday September or sorry December 9th check it out all right

[21:25] All right

[21:26] What else do I want to say about iapa anything anything anything let's talk about the fact that

[21:32] Guardians of the galaxy Ellie did not sell out and what does that mean so

[21:37] Here's the thing for the past few years

[21:40] The term selling out is an interesting term

[21:44] When we hear a game has sold out it creates this sort of

[21:48] hysteria

[21:50] But I want to take a step back and like what causes a game to sell out right?

[21:55] It's pretty simple right? It's there's more demand than there is supply

[21:59] But how do you get a pinball machine right an experiential thing to sell out

[22:04] Before anyone's even played it now that to me that's genius marketing

[22:09] When you can get people to give their money over to you expensive

[22:14] Expensive item if you can get them to fork over the dollars before they've even seen it

[22:19] It means you've you've sort of hit pager and you've

[22:24] You've done something and you've made a marketing decision that's genius now

[22:28] For the most part usually what that means is you have a theme everybody wants

[22:34] And they want the nicest version of that theme okay

[22:38] But that's not always the case if we look at

[22:41] The last few years

[22:43] The games that have sold out before they ever shipped before anyone ever flipped a single game

[22:49] These are the games that we're already spoken for

[22:52] We're gonna start with one that might ruffle some feathers

[22:55] But this game is sold out immediately

[22:58] Immediately at sixteen thousand dollars a pop and that was magic girl

[23:04] People handed John pop-a-duke money sold out

[23:07] Of his you know

[23:10] His like amazing machine that was gonna show the whole pinball world what he was capable of on just all he had when he announced

[23:17] It was the name he didn't even show anyone anything he didn't even show anyone a company or anything how much

[23:23] Wiser are we now than we were then but magic girl sold out you know what else sold out

[23:28] Raza retro atomic zombie adventure land so when John announced game two without even having game one shown or anyone playing game one

[23:36] It sold out now. We all know why John's games sold out

[23:40] It was because of his past pedigree his past games were amazing and people just assumed

[23:46] He would take it to the next level with these titles and the other thing was the rarity the scarcity

[23:52] This John John saw what was happening when people were paying

[23:56] Twice as much money for tron elise and he would look at a game like that and be like this is garbage

[24:00] I can do better and so John jumped on the bandwagon because he saw rich guys throwing

[24:06] tons of money at pinball and he felt like he deserved it and he took

[24:11] $1.5 million of your money and delivered

[24:15] 22 machines he didn't even do it American pinball paid

[24:19] 300 plus thousand dollars they get those magic girls built for you guys

[24:23] But so that was that then the next another title that sold out right before anyone ever flipped it

[24:30] And this one's kind of comical when you think about it selling out

[24:33] But that's rob zombie sold out before anyone ever really played the game

[24:39] Charlie announced there would be 300 rob zombies. He offered spots first to America's most haunted buyers

[24:45] He made 50 LEs and 250 regular versions of this game and they were spoken for everyone went in on it

[24:52] Now back then

[24:54] Charlie had a refundable deposit plan where you could give a thousand dollars

[24:58] But you could get your money back at any time if you cancelled before your game was built

[25:03] He learned the hard way people started to get the games and started to realize the games weren't good

[25:08] They started to want refunds and people started to want refunds after they built the game

[25:13] They want it and they were bailing the game was $6,000 the only was $6,500

[25:20] Rob zombies are now selling for low fives a year from now this machine will be in the mid fours to low fours

[25:28] Simply because people realize it's not that good. It was you know

[25:32] It nothing personal again spooky and company the game's not that great when you look at it now compared to what's out there

[25:38] And they know this they're gonna make their future titles better

[25:41] Uh, but you know everyone who bought one got one and but the game is not gonna go up in value ever

[25:48] Ever it will keep going down in value even though there's only 300 there will never be a time in the future where people be like I have to get a rob zombie

[25:57] There's too much good pimp ball out there the other game that sold out immediately right?

[26:01] This one was like everyone was on the list before there was even a list was Ghostbusters

[26:06] Ellie right because Ghostbusters was one of the worst kept secrets

[26:09] There was leaks going around like well before the game was even announced

[26:14] Everyone was calling their distributors to get on the list for Ghostbusters

[26:17] Ellie and this is where there was like a domino effect of stern sort of hitting the market with the right themes

[26:23] The right time with the right hype Ghostbusters sold out gone boom. I bought my Ghostbusters Ellie for $8,000

[26:30] I think I paid 7,600 from a distributor. I sold it to somebody cash immediately immediately for 10 grand

[26:37] Like 9800 he bought it for boom out the door made the profit

[26:41] Lapt all the way to the bank now. I can go get a Ghostbusters Ellie two day home use only with the replacement playfield and mint condition

[26:49] I can go get one for around 6500 think about that someone paid almost 10 grand for mine

[26:56] Their machine is now worth 6500 just like a year later a year and a half later

[27:01] Okay, so after Ghostbusters

[27:03] Everyone start to hear rumors of the next like

[27:06] 30th anniversary special Batman game that was coming out and everyone those games were sold out

[27:12] Before you even like even were close to expo 2016 right? I was on the list

[27:18] uh, anyone who went in on an Ellie

[27:21] Like the 240 went immediately before the games were even shown

[27:24] So did the super alleys forget it

[27:26] Stern was able to sell 80 super alleys originally the plan was 30 the demand was so great

[27:32] They bumped it to 80 and those 80 sold out like to chain

[27:36] Don sold out before anyone ever flipped the Batman and look where we're at now, right?

[27:41] Those everyone who went in on Batman has had a really painful year

[27:45] Because the code has been so slow coming

[27:49] But it was genius marketing anyone who thinks it's not genius marketing is fooling themselves

[27:54] This super alleys as much as like people have complained and moaned and groaned about it

[27:59] It was genius marketing they sold every single one of those pinball machines

[28:04] Think about how much extra on top they made because uh of that decision

[28:11] Now everyone who owned a super alleys i mean i think the guys for the most part now are getting to be pretty happy because the game is

[28:17] Starting to get really really good and you you have one of only 80 out there and the Ellie is the same thing

[28:24] You have one of only 240 see for me that's the last true

[28:28] Limited run Stern's ever done ever since then they've made way too many of the titles all right

[28:33] If we keep going on the list the next one

[28:36] I think I think this sold out. I'm not sure

[28:40] Is Star Wars Ellie now Star Wars being the biggest property in the world

[28:45] Everybody I know is on the list for Star Wars Ellie everybody. This was the one that

[28:50] um, you know you were gonna you were gonna like have to fight in claw to get an Ellie of Star Wars

[28:54] But before I talk about stars one point I missed on Batman 66

[28:58] This was this was the last Stern Ellie. This was the last one that you could buy and sell second hand before even taking possession for profit

[29:09] I bought mine it was $10,000. I think I paid 9,500 someone came to my apartment with $12,000 in cash and bought my Batman Ellie

[29:19] I sold it for a

[29:21] $200,500 profit. I had two of them I gave my second one to Joe Newhart at cost

[29:28] At cost didn't didn't I could have flipped it for more the market was hot

[29:32] But I want to do the right thing for Joe all right

[29:35] Those days are gone. Those days are dead and gone. They're long gone right because the next title to come out

[29:42] Well, Erasmith didn't sell out. So I'm not even gonna talk about that

[29:45] Star Wars Ellie was the one that everyone was waiting for this was the one

[29:49] But a couple things happened

[29:52] First thing that happened is the game's not very good. Okay, so that's one the other thing that happened is they made 800

[29:58] Ellie's and when you look at the Ellie and Star Wars

[30:01] Not really anything special in it. I mean this was the first Ellie where people really looked at it and said man

[30:07] Stern for 9 grand you strip so much out of it. It's not that special the art packages kind of man

[30:13] It there's no point in getting it over the premium you took out stuff like back glasses and I don't I don't think it has a shaker motor

[30:21] Like you know, you just removed all these features from it

[30:24] It's not worth getting the Ellie and especially because there's 800 of them. We're gonna pass

[30:29] So and if you look at Star Wars Ellie's now

[30:32] This is why I don't think it ever really fully sold out it might have sold through to distributors all 800

[30:37] But I still think you can find them new in box. I'm seeing Star Wars Ellie's sell already for around

[30:43] 8,000 and a little bit less than that

[30:46] So people are starting to dump them and they're gonna dump them even more because I just don't think this is gonna be one that people hold on to

[30:54] Now I heard that pirates of the Caribbean collector's edition is sold out at $12,500

[31:02] Do I believe that I don't know I don't know there's only 200 being made

[31:08] I think 200 is the right sweet spot for a limited edition version of a game

[31:13] 12,500 though. It's a heck of a lot of money like you've got to really love that Davy Jones package to go in on it

[31:19] I think that Jack is doing the right thing by having a different play field art having different cabinet art having an exclusive

[31:26] Topper

[31:27] There are things he's doing to this game that I think

[31:30] Separate it much better than the collector's edition of dialed in which I think was

[31:35] completely

[31:36] Uh, not worth it because it just it looked like the same dialed in you can't have the same cabinet art

[31:41] It just looks exactly the same you need to have more of a differentiator when you're gonna pay that money

[31:46] And 200 I think that's a good number. I think that's a good number and also pirates is a lot of hype

[31:52] So I think people jumped in on the collector's edition right after they saw it at expo now again

[31:57] Those deposits are still refundable

[32:00] They're still refundable so it's almost like why not go in on it

[32:06] But here's here's the here's the point I want to make is that flipping pinball machines for a profit

[32:12] Because you got one of the limited versions those days are over they're done. They're gone like I

[32:18] I will never have the ability to do short-term flips

[32:23] What does that mean does it mean elis and collectors editions are no longer going to be a thing?

[32:27] Absolutely not they will be a thing and here's why

[32:31] Because collectors who want the nicest version of a game they love will always spring for the top of the line version

[32:38] And so there's nothing wrong with that

[32:41] I think what it but but what it means is if you're gonna spend

[32:44] Ellie cash if you're gonna go in on a collector's edition

[32:47] You better damn well know this is a game you want to keep in your game room for a while right

[32:52] It's not gonna be this speculative thing where you can play it for six months and flip it like an ACDC back in black

[32:59] And you'll double your money or get like three thousand dollars more

[33:02] There's no upside anymore to these limited edition collectors editions

[33:07] You can't sell a dialed in collectors edition ever for more than 12,500 you will never be able to sell your

[33:14] collectors edition of

[33:16] Pirates of the Caribbean for north of 12,500

[33:21] You probably can you sell a Batman 66 super elite for more than 15,000

[33:25] I've seen some pop up for 13. I don't know if that one sold 14,000

[33:31] But it's hard right? It's hard. I think a lot of people who own the Batman elis and the super elis

[33:37] I think a lot of those guys are just never gonna get rid of them

[33:40] So if there was any title that might you know hold good it might be that one

[33:45] Cuz Batman is such an iconic theme for people

[33:48] But but even then it's like who cares

[33:51] With the resale value on any pinball machine is anymore. I think that whole conversation

[33:56] Has really run dry and I think people are realizing none of these things are investments

[34:02] You gotta just get the thing you love and I know this sounds cliched

[34:05] It's like why do I listen to this idiot's podcast he's telling me captain obvious shit

[34:10] But it really wasn't captain obvious shit and when I see people

[34:14] Trying to sell their acdcs and their back-and-black and their lucis for like 10,000 12,000 dollars in 2017

[34:21] Or their cactus canyons for 18,000 dollars the markets gone guys that market of extraordinary

[34:30] Secondhand prices on these games

[34:32] It's over

[34:33] You need to just accept the fact that Chicago gaming is going to remake cactus canyon

[34:39] And it'll be better than the original

[34:41] They're gonna remake kingpin if I had a kingpin. I would sell that game today

[34:47] Today and here's why you might be able to get 40 50 grand for a game if they remake it

[34:53] You're gonna lose 40,000

[34:57] In value on that game

[34:59] Look personally, I think it sucks that they're gonna remake some of these sort of holy grail

[35:04] Items because I think it ruins the fun of the collector hobby

[35:08] It's like if someone perfectly remade the PCBs and the cabinets to major havoc

[35:13] All those guys who have originals they would lose all their value

[35:17] Look the originals will keep some value don't get me wrong

[35:20] But if you remake kingpin at 10,000 dollars or 9,000 dollars a game

[35:26] And the the rare prototypes were selling for like 40,000,000

[35:32] Those prototypes are gonna skyrocket

[35:35] Towards 10 grand

[35:37] That's just the reality because no one no one really cares about prototype

[35:42] They really don't this whole like it's the original game

[35:45] It's not that much of a different shitter all right

[35:49] All right, you know another thing I was thinking about

[35:52] Is just where are some of the games that we've been promised

[35:55] Where are some of these titles that have been promoted and hyped and supposed to be shipping

[36:00] For you know in numbers where is the gizmo games pitching bat, you know the zombie Eddie was a dentist norm in design pitching bat game

[36:08] This game was supposed to be out in

[36:11] Summertime it is now November 15th now. There's not a real lot of conversation around this pitching bat

[36:16] But I think pitching bats are cool and some guys out there probably want them

[36:21] The latest news is that the first allotment of this title has been sold out

[36:26] I don't know how many that was and they're supposed to be shipping them hopefully by the end of the year and new orders will be

[36:34] shipped sometime in q1 of of 2018

[36:38] Wow, I can't believe it's gonna be 2018 so pitching bat. That's the latest on that pinball circus

[36:43] Where is pinball circus?

[36:45] We keep hearing that they're changing the design a little bit where the flipper location is

[36:50] They're gonna move that snake from up the middle to another part of the game so that the flipper gap is not

[36:55] Ridiculous. That's a good move the game is not fun to play otherwise

[36:59] But it's it's like been a really really really long time

[37:04] Clearly these guys are not that focused on getting this game out

[37:08] I also heard that they're making a second game that they're gonna announce

[37:12] Please don't announce a second game before game one ships can people please just do that um

[37:19] Where is captain Nemo where is captain Nemo?

[37:23] This is a game that if you go on pin sight

[37:27] Captain Nemo was announced by Antonio

[37:30] Five years ago and he said I'm gonna make 30

[37:34] Units of captain Nemo. I don't know how many he fully sold that quetzal pinball

[37:40] But I've never seen a single person unbox a captain Nemo in America has anybody like did anyone get your captain Nemo

[37:47] You're just hiding it away. I would love to hear from someone who has it

[37:51] That's another pinball project that just can't seem to come to fruition

[37:56] um

[37:58] What else is going on Chicago gaming is announced that attack from Mars remake Ellie's

[38:04] They're sending some overseas, but they hope to get more us games shipped by the end of the year

[38:09] So if you guys are in on an attack from Mars Ellie

[38:12] You know you should have it before Christmas. Hopefully I also think that

[38:17] um

[38:18] You know their next game is gonna be monster bash reveal the tpf and we'll talk about that more

[38:24] Let's end this podcast with end this podcast on a highway pinball because I've been following the thread more and more

[38:31] I've been seeing more and more people post about their unboxings

[38:35] Something interesting was posted recently that I think everyone should be aware of because

[38:41] These guys have had a long time to get this game sort of working and working well and free of some issues and

[38:51] If there's one thing that's gonna sink this company. It's not it's not Andrew highway's mistakes

[38:56] Because he already made all those mistakes if there's one thing that's gonna keep people on the fence

[39:02] Um, it's simply tech issues

[39:04] These games are having a lot of issues and I think people

[39:08] Are going to not want to go in if support seems like something that is not gonna be there for the game

[39:15] And now there's been a whole bunch of issues with LCDs going out

[39:18] There's been other issues with the game mechanically

[39:21] Not nothing terrible right people are able to get their games working

[39:25] There was a new issue though that seems like it might be plaguing every machine and that issue is

[39:32] Remember when we saw a bunch of highway games ship and the glass was broken

[39:36] This might be the cause of it

[39:37] So one of the wire form ramps in the upper right of the game is actually

[39:44] Sitting higher than the side rails of the game

[39:47] Which means it's pressing against the glass

[39:50] So a new alien owner got his machine and noticed that and actually the glass had

[39:56] Sort of an indent on it where it would like the pressure was like pretty significant and now he needs a new piece of glass

[40:03] Um, and so he looked at it and realized that this is kind of affecting

[40:08] Probably every machine other owners have said they've they've seen similar things occur with their machine

[40:14] so

[40:15] There that's another issue now that these guys have to deal with so I think alien pinball right now is is sort of got this

[40:22] mixture of

[40:24] There's issues will they be fixed

[40:27] Will the game have support?

[40:28] Um, we'll see we'll see I just still think

[40:33] You know, I want you guys to get your machines. I want your Ellie guys to get your machines

[40:38] But man some of these issues just show that you know the quality testing is just not there with this company

[40:44] And at the end of the day, I think people are gonna want to buy stuff where there's more peace of mind

[40:49] That's what I want to do. I just want peace of mind with pinball

[40:52] I'm so tired of issues and waiting and like you know speculating it gets old it gets old buy from companies where they have

[41:01] Good customer service that gets back to you on time

[41:03] I still hear stories of people not getting refunds from highway

[41:07] I really want them to just pay everyone back who they owe money to why is that so hard?

[41:11] Why is that so hard? All right, everyone enjoy your weekend go play some pinball and we'll talk to you real soon

[41:18] oh

[41:21] Bells
