[00:00] This podcast is not going to sound right because I'm using some free software on the

[00:05] internet because it is almost one o'clock in the morning here in Ireland and I just wanted

[00:09] to get you some thoughts about Toy Story, about the collector's edition and my computer

[00:15] that I use for the podcast is in the room with the baby.

[00:19] Now Killian has had a really rough night.

[00:21] I'm jet lagged and I'm trying to sort of process still doing my work in New York, also trying

[00:27] to uncover all the different things about this Toy Story announcement and this reveal

[00:31] and I'm going to give you this content right now.

[00:34] This is old school Canada.

[00:35] There's no editing.

[00:36] This program doesn't let me go back and take out mistakes.

[00:39] So if I do a mistake, I'm going to keep on going but I'm going to try to give you at

[00:43] least a decent thing to listen to without any production quality whatsoever.

[00:48] Are you ready?

[00:49] Okay.

[00:50] So we know that it's Toy Story.

[00:52] We don't know if it's Toy Story 4.

[00:54] We don't know if it's Toy Story 1 through 3 or all of them or some brand new Toy Story

[00:59] adventure.

[01:00] We see the Pixar ball is the shooter rod.

[01:03] It's the shooter handle, not the rod, the handle on the game.

[01:07] It looks like the armor is right out of Willy Wonka.

[01:11] It looks like the red armor from Wizard of Oz, Ruby Redditions.

[01:15] But this is probably going to be what the collector's edition is with this red armor.

[01:19] Is Jersey Jack recycling old armor?

[01:23] We don't know.

[01:24] Someone really cares.

[01:25] I think what was funny about that photo was you've got this beautiful like Pixar ball.

[01:30] You've got this beautiful candy coated armor.

[01:33] And then you've got this ugly, basic silver leg bolt.

[01:38] Like they couldn't have done something not to have the leg bolt stand out so much on

[01:42] this game.

[01:43] But nobody cares about leg bolts.

[01:46] Here's the thing.

[01:47] Here's the real thing about this game right now.

[01:49] I think a lot of us out there are watching the stock market collapse.

[01:54] Crypto is burning right before our eyes.

[01:57] Like everyone you said crypto is fake is laughing all the way because they're looking at their

[02:01] more secure investments.

[02:03] But it's a really hard time for a lot of people in America.

[02:07] It's a really hard time for a lot of people who probably were a lot better off in September

[02:11] than they are right now.

[02:13] And as I think about this, this podcast has always tried to cover this hobby both from

[02:18] a pinball standpoint but also from a social and a cultural and a psychological standpoint.

[02:24] On what does it mean that tomorrow at noon Eastern Standard Time you are going to be

[02:30] given permission to send a pinball company probably 15 to $16,000 plus tax if you're

[02:37] in a state that requires tax to buy a pinball machine which nobody really needs.

[02:43] Nobody really needs it but we want it.

[02:44] These are emotional purchases.

[02:46] These are luxuries.

[02:47] These are the luxury of luxuries just because on the list of things you need you need a

[02:53] car.

[02:54] You even probably need a watch to tell time but you don't need a pinball machine.

[02:59] And so when the order bank opens up what's going to happen tomorrow?

[03:04] And I just want to say this.

[03:05] I think everyone out there wishes that we had something more to chew on as we head into

[03:11] tomorrow because here's the thing I don't know if we're going to actually get a video

[03:15] before noon Eastern Standard Time and then you've got to make up your mind on whether

[03:21] or not you really need this game, whether or not you want to send them all this money.

[03:27] And you're not going to get, I don't know what you're going to get.

[03:29] I think you're going to get a straight down the middle video like Zach did with Willy

[03:33] Wonka but then you're going to have to pull the trigger.

[03:36] But what we don't know is this.

[03:38] You don't know what time that video is coming out.

[03:41] Is that video going to launch at noon when order banks open?

[03:45] If that's the case you're going to have to buy it before you finish the video.

[03:50] Are they going to launch the video an hour before so you're going to be able to at least

[03:54] see what the game is about and then make up your mind?

[03:57] Nobody knows.

[03:58] There hasn't really been much communication whatsoever on this game.

[04:03] If you think about it, how much marketing has Jersey Jack Pinball done?

[04:07] We saw a few posts about how Spring is here, a new game is coming.

[04:11] We saw Jen in the truck and then we got Pat Lawler with the play field next to him turned

[04:17] upside down.

[04:19] And that's it.

[04:20] And now you have to decide whether or not you want it before you've seen it.

[04:25] And I think there's just an overall sort of fatigue around this approach that why can't

[04:31] we just see these things, see if we want them or not before we have to make up our mind.

[04:38] But I also think Jersey Jack is not going to sort of, you know, do a spooky pinball

[04:44] and not show you anything and ask for your money and then reveal the game.

[04:49] I don't think they're going to do that.

[04:51] They've never done that.

[04:52] Jersey Jack has always shown us what's in the game before they take our money.

[04:57] Now I think all of us missed the good old years in which they used to bring the game

[05:02] to a show.

[05:03] Remember these days?

[05:04] They would show up with the game at a show like at TPF.

[05:08] They would bring dialed in.

[05:09] They would bring pire to the Caribbean.

[05:12] And then all of these people at the show could jump on it and play the machine before the

[05:18] order banks opened up.

[05:20] Those were the good days.

[05:21] Those days are gone.

[05:22] Those days are gone.

[05:23] It's almost like companies don't even want to do that ever again.

[05:26] Nowadays they say, hey, we're going to make a game.

[05:30] Give me your money and you're going to wait like six to eight months to get your game.

[05:34] So what do I think is going to happen tomorrow?

[05:36] So I think we're going to get a video probably I would think like an hour or so before order

[05:43] banks open up.

[05:44] I think you're going to see probably around 11 a.m. maybe earlier, like 10 a.m. Eastern

[05:49] Standard Time.

[05:51] I expect them to put something up before the order banks open.

[05:55] I would be really disappointed if nothing goes up before noon.

[05:59] I really would because I do think you need to give people an adequate window to make

[06:04] up their mind, especially when they're spending this much money on a pinball machine.

[06:10] The other part that I just been thinking about and I can't shake this.

[06:13] And again, sorry that there's no editing.

[06:15] Sorry that I can't do anything with the volumes.

[06:17] This is old school Canada.

[06:19] The other thing I was thinking about was this.

[06:21] I really think prices are too high.

[06:24] There is no way you can sort of feel good about spending $12,000 on a pinball machine

[06:31] in 2022 and you're getting the second best version of the game.

[06:38] You know, 12 grand for an LE is the new price.

[06:41] How does anybody feel good about that?

[06:44] It's absolutely bonkers.

[06:45] I mean, $12,000 was roughly what the CE prices were on every prior Jersey Jack game.

[06:53] And the problem is if you drop $12,000 on the LE for a toy story, your game's not going

[06:58] to hold value.

[06:59] They're going to make thousands of them.

[07:02] And so you're going to spend $12,000 and just watch your game go from 12 to 11 to 10.

[07:10] Right now, I just spoke to someone tonight.

[07:12] He's like, Chris, I just got a Guns N' Roses LE for $8,600 bucks.

[07:18] $8,600 bucks for an LE of Guns N' Roses.

[07:22] And they're going to make even more toy stories.

[07:24] And I think this is at the point now where you might be a millionaire, you might have

[07:28] so much money, you might have money to burn, but what's happening in pinball?

[07:33] For $12,000, you should be getting something where you feel like you've got the creme de

[07:38] la creme, you got something special, you got something that's a little bit rare.

[07:43] But to spend this much money and to get something that they're going to make many, many, many

[07:47] of, I just think it's making people second guess it.

[07:51] The other part is this.

[07:53] There's no rush to buy an LE of this game.

[07:55] There's no rush whatsoever.

[07:57] If you want to wait and hold, you will be able to play the game.

[08:02] You'll be able to see if there's any play field issues.

[08:04] You'll be able to see if the code is where you want it to be.

[08:08] You'll be able to know if you really want the game.

[08:11] So that means on day one, the people who really, really, really want this machine are either,

[08:18] See, sorry, I made a mistake.

[08:19] They're either Toy Story fanatics or they are Pat Lawler fanatics or they are scalpers

[08:25] and they are flippers.

[08:27] And the thing that's going to happen tomorrow because Jersey Jack Pinball is only requiring

[08:32] a deposit on their direct sale site, they're actually inviting so many more scalpers to

[08:39] go because if all I have to spend is $2,000 to get a spot, that's going to be far more

[08:45] enticing and easy for people to swallow than if they have to spend the entire price of

[08:50] the game plus tax.

[08:53] You can get three spots for like $6,000.

[08:56] If you had to buy three games, you're talking $45,000.

[09:00] So we will see what happens.

[09:01] My prediction also is this.

[09:03] I think that they might have server issues.

[09:06] Now I hope they don't, but I think a lot of people are going to be trying to get through

[09:10] that door at noon Eastern Standard Time.

[09:12] And I think you're going to start to see JJP's store site start to get really slow and not

[09:18] load quickly starting around like 11.45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time as everyone's just trying

[09:25] to get through the door.

[09:27] So what kind of day will it be tomorrow?

[09:29] I think this game is going to sell out pretty instantly.

[09:32] I think distributors are already sold out.

[09:35] You are not going to find one with a distributor.

[09:38] The other thing we're going to see is this and I've predicted this and it's come true

[09:42] and it only makes sense.

[09:43] You are going to see some dealers who get smaller allotments of this game list them for sale

[09:50] for $25,000 to $30,000, maybe $20,000 to $30,000 somewhere in that spectrum.

[09:56] But you're going to see a lot of people trying to sell these games for a lot more money than

[10:02] even JJP thinks they're worth.

[10:04] And I think that's going to get people angry and it's going to get people mad.

[10:09] And I encourage all of you just don't buy it.

[10:12] If someone wants to sell you this game for $25,000 and you don't want it, you don't have

[10:18] to buy it, but you'll never be able to stop this behavior.

[10:23] This behavior, see I made another mistake.

[10:26] I'm human.

[10:27] This behavior, it's also 1 a.m. so give me a break, right?

[10:30] This behavior, this behavior happens in every single collectible market.

[10:36] In fact, if this didn't happen, if we didn't see people flipping things and selling them

[10:41] secondhand for far more than we bought them for, there wouldn't be a collectible market.

[10:48] So you can't have it both ways.

[10:49] You can't call something a collectible and seek rare versions of things and then get

[10:54] mad when people are doing the same thing you're doing, but they just want to make the money

[10:59] on it.

[11:00] They don't really care about the gameplay and the experience.

[11:02] It's the same thing in cars and watches and bottles of wine.

[11:06] You can go down a list of things.

[11:08] People buy it for this price and the demand is far greater than the supply.

[11:12] So this will happen.

[11:14] Now the other part I want to encourage each and every one of you to do is just be nice

[11:18] tomorrow.

[11:20] There are going to be winners and losers.

[11:22] There are going to be people that secure their CE and wave it in everyone's face.

[11:27] There's going to be people who love Toy Story, who get shut out of it.

[11:31] There's going to be people who feel like they missed out.

[11:34] FOMO is going to be strong.

[11:36] But I encourage everybody.

[11:38] If we're a community that is here because we enjoy each other's company, don't get

[11:45] too angry.

[11:47] Don't get too riled up.

[11:49] Don't brag if you got one.

[11:51] I think tomorrow is a moment in which, and I know I put up funny photos on my Facebook

[11:56] page, but I think tomorrow is going to be a moment where more people are disappointed

[12:01] than are going to walk away happy.

[12:04] And I know sometimes people say stuff like, why don't they just make unlimited amounts

[12:09] of CEs or take all the orders on CEs?

[12:12] No that's also stupid because look, these are companies.

[12:16] They're making items that nobody really needs.

[12:19] But they also understand that you need the collector market to drive pinball.

[12:25] It feels almost irresponsible talking about this as I'm looking at the stock market.

[12:30] It feels really irresponsible talking about this as I'm looking at what's going on in

[12:34] the world.

[12:35] I think everyone knows we are headed for some really, really dark times.

[12:39] We are.

[12:40] Financially, we are headed into a black hole over the next months and who knows how long

[12:45] it's going to last.

[12:46] But it doesn't look good.

[12:48] It doesn't look good.

[12:49] And a lot of people made a lot of money really fast.

[12:53] And when COVID hit, everyone thought we'd be in this recession but the opposite happened.

[12:57] Like this bubble appeared and everyone was making money.

[13:00] Remember when Dogecoin was 89 cents?

[13:03] Dogecoin is now 5 cents.

[13:06] And I get it.

[13:07] We all made a lot of money or some people did.

[13:09] I did.

[13:10] And I didn't make a lot of money through COVID.

[13:11] I just kept doing my job.

[13:13] I'm not paycheck to paycheck but I require a salary to maintain my lifestyle.

[13:18] I mean that's where I'm at.

[13:20] I don't have all these real estate holdings.

[13:23] I don't have all these dividends coming in.

[13:25] And so I save up money and I buy a pinball machine.

[13:28] And I think I'm like many of you out there.

[13:31] I don't need it but I can save up and get one.

[13:34] But if I'm looking at my 401k tanking and I'm looking at all my other investments going

[13:38] south, it's really, really hard for me to look at my wife and look at my kid and say,

[13:43] you know what we need to do right now?

[13:45] Instead of like stop spending, I'm going to spend $16,000 on a pinball machine.

[13:50] And this is also why I'm going to be honest.

[13:52] This is also why I only think the CE makes sense to get.

[13:56] Because the CE is the only one you can buy that will let the least hold value.

[14:01] It's a good investment.

[14:03] If you get a chance to get a CE at MSRP, grab it.

[14:07] I know some of you out there are like, oh, I'm just going to let it go and let someone

[14:09] else have it who wants to enjoy it.

[14:11] I think that's foolish.

[14:12] I mean, look, MSRP on this game tomorrow is like an IPO price of something we know is

[14:19] going to go up.

[14:21] I know this is not my normal show.

[14:24] I just want to give you some thoughts.

[14:25] The other thing is this.

[14:27] I think this hobby is going to get real soft on the second hand market real soon.

[14:31] I think a lot of these boutique companies that are selling games around $10,000, I think

[14:36] they're going to feel this real soon.

[14:38] I think the fun of pinball, the fun of seeing what's next, the fun of seeing these games

[14:44] for sale, the fun of unboxing a new and box game.

[14:48] A lot of that fun is starting to erode.

[14:52] I even mean it when I talk to my really rich friends in pinball.

[14:56] Nobody wants it to cost $30,000 plus to unbox two games, two, for $30,000 plus.

[15:07] It's just the experience is not there for that much money.

[15:12] All that being said, this game is going to sell out pretty instantly.

[15:16] All that being said, it's Pat Lawler, it's Toy Story, it's a perfect theme for pinball.

[15:21] I'm having a hard time sleeping because I also can't wait to see it.

[15:25] I'm super excited and I can't wait to put one next to my Guns N' Roses because this

[15:31] is another dream theme for me.

[15:34] Killian has been running around with his baby Buzz Lightyear.

[15:38] That's what it's about for me.

[15:39] I want him to grow up loving Guns N' Roses like his father.

[15:43] I want him to grow up loving Buzz and Woody like his father does.

[15:48] That's what it's all about.

[15:50] These are toys meant to bring us joy.

[15:52] They're not going to change our lives, but they do enhance our lives.

[15:57] Life can be pretty stressful, it can be pretty hard, and if you've worked hard for your money,

[16:02] you're allowed to go enjoy it and you can spend it where you want to spend it.

[16:08] Let's be kind to each other.

[16:10] It's not waving in each other's faces that you got a CE and someone else didn't.

[16:15] Look, I've always said it.

[16:16] We really should just be keeping these companies accountable.

[16:19] The other thing that I heard yesterday is that Jack is telling people that they fixed

[16:23] the flipper issues on the games.

[16:26] That's interesting.

[16:27] He says they fixed the mushy flipper feel.

[16:31] What's interesting about that is, is it a software issue?

[16:35] Is this something they can update on all the old games that have the soft feel?

[16:40] Is it a hardware issue?

[16:42] Are they going to be installing fans in Toy Story so that it doesn't suffer from the

[16:47] heat?

[16:48] That's what's happening is the games are heating up and then you get soft flippers.

[16:52] It also is, I think, a software issue where there's a little bit of a delay between when

[16:56] you press the button and the flipper activates.

[16:59] I think someone studied this that stern machines actually trigger the flipper faster than JJP.

[17:05] And then obviously, what are the playfields going to be like?

[17:09] I mean, they made games.

[17:10] And so these games are going to be out on location, I think, tomorrow.

[17:14] And what happens if we start to see playfield issues?

[17:18] Is this going to be the end of the goodwill between customers and Jersey Jack?

[17:23] All of our memories are short.

[17:25] Everyone is still going all in on this.

[17:28] Nobody cares.

[17:29] They didn't replace Mirko and we're still lining up with our checkbooks to get this game.

[17:34] Because we're kind of like obsessed with this thing.

[17:37] We're kind of overly addicted to it.

[17:40] There's a lot worse things you could be addicted to and obsessed over than pinball machines.

[17:45] Did that even make sense?

[17:46] Everybody, it is 1 o'clock in the morning.

[17:50] I just want to thank each and every one of you too because the reason I want to thank

[17:53] each and every one of you, and I'm sorry this show's a little sloppy, this isn't how I normally

[17:58] do it, I want to thank each and every one of you because your contribution, even as the

[18:02] economy starts to go south, we're still holding really strong with 521 subscribers.

[18:09] I thank you so much.

[18:11] It's $5.

[18:12] I'm not raising the price on you.

[18:14] The price to listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast won't become inflated.

[18:18] And I know that each and every one of you is making really tough financial decisions,

[18:22] so I'm happy you've stuck with this show.

[18:24] I can't wait for you to hear my thoughts on Toy Story.

[18:28] I'm going to give my initial reaction to Toy Story to all of you first.

[18:33] I'm not going to do a Facebook Live.

[18:35] I'm not going to tell everybody on Facebook for free.

[18:38] I want you to hear how excited I am or how disappointed I am in this game because I think

[18:45] it's going to go one way or the other.

[18:47] I hope I'm excited and I hope you get to hear it first.

[18:50] Everybody, have a good night and we will have obviously more shows this week and more Facebook

[18:55] lives, but I just wanted to say thank you for my Ireland.

[18:58] Be good.
