[00:00] Oh, fire, strong desire, rain is deep within.

[01:00] I'm hearing, I'm here to tell you right now, I heard from someone over at Stern Pinball,

[01:05] someone who has played this game, it is confirmed to be Jaws, so it's not going to be anything

[01:09] other than Jaws.

[01:11] And here is what I am hearing the game is going to be.

[01:14] I am hearing the game is going to be a 10 out of 10, that it is as good if not better

[01:21] than Godzilla Pinball.

[01:24] And we all know that Godzilla is held up as one of the greatest pinball machines of all

[01:28] time if not the best Stern machine ever made some people say.

[01:32] Now look, that raises a lot of questions, you know, if this game is as good as or better

[01:37] than Godzilla, is this game going to have all the assets from the movie?

[01:42] Because Godzilla is filled with all of the assets from Godzilla movies.

[01:48] So I don't know if that's going to be the case, I heard that is not going to be the

[01:52] case.

[01:53] Is the art package going to be as good as Godzilla?

[01:55] Zombie Eddie made that art package, I heard Jaws wasn't that sexy.

[01:59] So take it with a little bit of a grain of salt, but here is what I am here to tell you

[02:03] right now ladies and gentlemen, the Jaws hype trade is about to leave the building and I

[02:07] mean it when I say it, you might as well get on the list to get a Jaws LE.

[02:13] Do I think Jaws LE is going to sell out day one?

[02:17] The answer is yes, even though the game is going to be $13,000, even though they are

[02:21] going to make a thousand of them.

[02:23] Here is my reason why I think this game is going to be a day one sell out and I think

[02:28] if you wait on it, don't blame me because I'm telling you right now, you might as well

[02:32] grab one and here's my rationale for that.

[02:35] A premium, no matter what you do to it, no matter how many stickers and mods you throw

[02:40] onto a premium, no matter how much you change the armor or order stuff to make it look like

[02:45] an LE, a premium will never be an LE.

[02:49] So you will never be able to make a Jaws premium as beautiful as a Jaws LE.

[02:54] So you might as well get one of a thousand because they are going to make premiums of

[02:57] Jaws to the cows come home, they are going to make so many Jaws premiums just like they

[03:02] made so many Godzilla premiums, you might as well get on the list to get an LE.

[03:08] Also, has there ever been a Keith Owen game that has lost a single dollar other than,

[03:15] this is the big caveat other than that stupid James Bond 60th.

[03:20] I'm here to tell you right now, someone hit me up yesterday and now James Bond 60th, are

[03:25] you ready for the new price?

[03:27] Someone was offered a James Bond 60th with low plays for $11,000, $11,000.

[03:35] That game is the single biggest loser financially in the history of pinball.

[03:40] There has never been a single pinball machine that has lost $9,000 in value over its MSRP

[03:48] price.

[03:49] Talk about the biggest stinker in the history of pinball and it came from Keith Owen and

[03:55] Stern.

[03:56] But it wasn't Keith Owen's fault, it was the marketing morons over at Stern that thought

[03:59] they could treat us like a bunch of idiots and we responded by saying no way.

[04:04] If you take that game off the table, it was an anomaly marketing mishap by Stern Pinball,

[04:10] it wasn't really Keith Owen's decision.

[04:12] We know Keith Owen is a great guy, he's not trying to fleece us, it's that greedy Seth

[04:16] Davis that thought he could get away with it and pull a fast one.

[04:20] So you take that game off the table, every other Keith Owen game, Iron Maiden, Jurassic

[04:25] Park, I think Avengers LE has kind of held value, it hasn't really lost value but remember,

[04:31] he made Avengers in like eight months and he's been making Jaws now for three freaking

[04:37] years.

[04:39] So are you ready to see a Keith Owen game where none of his older games have lost money,

[04:45] now we're gonna get a Keith Owen game based on a theme that has more popularity and more

[04:50] affinity with the pinball buying demographic than even Godzilla did.

[04:54] We're gonna see his game that's been in design the longest based on his second most popular

[04:59] theme.

[05:00] I would argue that Jurassic Park is still a much more popular theme than Jaws.

[05:04] If I had to put order of popularity, it would go Jurassic Park, Jaws and then Godzilla and

[05:10] even though the games are now $13,000 new in box for an LE, think about it.

[05:16] Like his Godzilla's were 10-5 out the door and you can't find a Godzilla LE for $13,000.

[05:23] Now here's what I think is gonna happen because if Jaws is as good as if not better than Godzilla,

[05:28] I think a lot of people have played Godzilla for a few years, it's not your dream theme,

[05:33] you might find the game a little bit difficult, you might just be over it, you might have

[05:36] just had your fun playing Godzilla a few thousand times.

[05:40] I think the market is gonna see a lot of Godzilla pinball machines up for sale.

[05:45] I think we're gonna see people try to sell their LE's, think about it, they're gonna

[05:48] try to sell their LE Godzilla's, make some money and use that money to go buy Jaws LE.

[05:54] I think we're gonna see some of that, it's gonna be interesting to see if distributors

[05:57] will allow you to do trade-ins on your Godzilla LE but we know a distributor is gonna offer

[06:02] you or lowball you and you're always gonna get more money if you sell your game privately,

[06:07] it's just like a used car, it's like if you trade it in, yeah it's easier to do that but

[06:12] you're gonna lose a couple thousand dollars because the distro wants to make that $2,000

[06:16] on your used game sale.

[06:18] So you're not gonna lose money if you go in on a Jaws LE, like it's not gonna sink

[06:22] like Foo Fighters did, it's definitely not gonna sink like Venom, it's not gonna sink

[06:26] like Godfather so I think if you go in on a Jaws LE for 13K you might as well, you might

[06:33] as well.

[06:34] The best case scenario is it might go up a few thousand dollars, I don't think we're

[06:37] gonna see like 13,000 dollar pins like go up anymore to like 18,000, 19,000 dollars, I

[06:43] just don't think we're gonna see that because the big fear now and Stern did this to themselves

[06:48] is we all know that this is not gonna be the creme de la creme version of Jaws, we know

[06:54] they're gonna make an anniversary edition.

[06:57] We now know that Stern is gonna create new variations once the hype dies down a little

[07:02] bit to make more money down the road so I fully believe in 2025, I don't think we're

[07:08] gonna see it in 2024, I think we're gonna see Jaws LE in 2023, 2024 and then we're gonna

[07:14] see Metallica anniversary edition and we're gonna see Godzilla 70th anniversary edition

[07:20] which is gonna piss off all you Godzilla LE owners and that's gonna be the other thing

[07:24] that makes all these Godzilla LEs go up for sale because if you really love the game

[07:28] and you want the nicest version of the game, you're now gonna have to buy your game again

[07:33] and that's not something that makes a lot of collectors happy.

[07:36] I think Seth Davis has really taken this ship in the wrong direction and I don't think it's

[07:41] fun anymore to invest all this money in LEs knowing that down the road a better version

[07:47] of what you love is going to come out.

[07:49] Let me use an example in my own life, it's as if like I love Brenda to death, I love

[07:53] everything about Brenda, there's like almost nothing I would change in Brenda but imagine

[07:58] if like another Brenda came out, looked exactly like Brenda would just maybe one single little

[08:03] enhancement, I know she's probably hearing me through the walls and they're like there's

[08:07] nothing you can enhance in me baby boy but that's my point is like when you really love

[08:11] something and you've committed to it the way people have committed to these stern LEs,

[08:16] they just don't want to see another version that's a little bit better come out down the

[08:21] road because then it puts you in this like dilemma, what do I do, I love the game, I

[08:26] never wanted to get rid of it, now I've got to upgrade something I never thought I'd

[08:29] had to upgrade.

[08:31] And the two real audiences feeling that this year are the Jurassic Park LE owners because

[08:36] the new one is nicer and all those Elvira owners because the Blood Kiss Edition is nicer

[08:41] than the 40th and the other versions of the game that people spent a lot more money on.

[08:45] I think the biggest pain point is the Elvira 40th people because you spent like 20 to $25,000

[08:52] and Stern released a nicer machine for $13,000.

[08:56] I mean talk about the biggest FU next to James Bond 60th.

[09:00] Here's the deal, I'm always going to be candid with you.

[09:02] I am on the list for a Jaws LE, I am on the list, I plan to grab a Jaws LE, I plan to

[09:09] grab it on a speculation basis.

[09:11] I'm not 100% sure I want to keep it but I also don't want to spend more than I need

[09:16] to if I want to have one.

[09:18] And I felt the same way about Pulp Fiction LE, I went right in on a Pulp Fiction LE,

[09:22] I knew that game was never going to lose value especially where it was priced at and once

[09:27] that straight down the middle video showed us how cool the game was, I knew that thing

[09:31] was going to sell out and it sold out in 48 hours.

[09:34] So that's my thing, you know you listen to Canada Spinball Podcast, I want to give you

[09:38] advice to wait and see but there are exceptions to my own advice and I want to be transparent

[09:43] about what I'm doing so if I were you I would get on the list for a Jaws LE.

[09:48] The good news now, with a thousand LE's in the world it's never going to be hard to get

[09:53] one right, it's not like it used to be back in the day when there were only 500 and half

[09:58] of them were supposedly going overseas, if you want one you can get one but you've got

[10:03] to move fast.

[10:04] You're still going to have to move in the first 24 hours to get this game, I would

[10:09] be ready to pull the trigger immediately, don't worry about buying it directly from

[10:13] Stern, you know Stern only has a hand full available and look I think we're going to

[10:17] get to the point now people I mean this, the biggest fear to distros is I'm just waiting

[10:21] for the day these manufacturers just sell more of their games directly.

[10:25] I mean Jersey Jack I hear is selling almost half of their CE's directly now because they

[10:30] want to make all that money.

[10:32] They make a lot more money every time you order it from JJP, they make about $2,000 to

[10:36] $3,000 more on every collector's edition that they sell to you directly.

[10:42] It's always interesting right, these aren't cars, you're not getting an oil change at

[10:46] the dealership so I'm just curious with Seth Davis being all about money money money how

[10:52] long before Seth Davis starts to realize why are we handing distributors $2,000 to $3,000

[10:59] for every one of these games like do we even need a sales force when everyone is beating

[11:04] down our door to get our product like if we just hired a customer service rep and paid

[11:09] the dude like $75,000 a year and then had someone who was able to mail out parts why

[11:15] do we need to keep handing all that work over to distributors because it's not like these

[11:19] things are breaking down left and right you know there's no like annual checkups that

[11:23] these games need so it's really interesting and you know with the collector community

[11:27] especially and think about it like this like if you're going to sell anything direct to

[11:31] sell the LEs directly because think about it whenever you see LE machines for sale and

[11:36] collectors editions machines for sale it's always like less than 200 plays so one day

[11:41] Seth Davis is going to wake up and realize he's going to be like holy cow our collectors

[11:47] barely even play their games which means they're not going to break down which means there's

[11:51] a very good chance if we sell these games directly we're never going to hear from these

[11:57] customers they're just going to be happy they got one of the LEs and we're going to be able

[12:02] to pocket $3,000 more per sale than if I give this to a distributor that has to be going

[12:10] through their minds a little bit as these companies are chasing the almighty dollar I've

[12:15] got distro friends and I don't want to see them cut out of the equation but I do think

[12:19] we're going to start to see more and more distros are going to have to sell use games

[12:23] more and more and do trade ins and stuff like that like that's where they can be really

[12:27] convenient like a distro will pick up your game they have their shipping companies on

[12:32] speed dial they've got people that will come to your house wrap the game pick it up you

[12:36] know and they'll give you a fair market value for the game and then they can make you know

[12:40] another thousand dollars on the resale I mean that's how it's going to be I think the days

[12:44] are going to be over words just like distros can just drop ship stuff and make money like

[12:49] those days are over like the days where you don't have to do any work and you can just

[12:53] make money now look I still think on a game like jaws these distros are going to get

[12:58] inundated with sales I mean it's going to be one of those games where it's going to

[13:01] be a windfall moment for them they're all going to make a lot of money it will be a

[13:05] win-win win for everybody distros will get their payday sterns going to get their payday

[13:10] and customers are going to get a new Keith Elwin machine I mean that is great obviously

[13:14] I would like it to be the way it used to be where games were like 8500 for LEs and everybody

[13:19] was really winning but those days are gone alright so jaws pinball 10 out of 10 we shall

[13:25] see the other rumor is that this game is going to be revealed in mid December I'm here in

[13:29] Neil McCrae say that people are saying like December 15th or 19th for the teaser then

[13:35] a week later the game reveal now we do know that these pinball companies really do like

[13:41] to give us something special around the holidays we tend to see games revealed or announced

[13:46] around Christmas time so will stern pinball do that I still think we're going to have

[13:52] to wait until sometime in early 2024 to see jaws alright what else is going on in pinball

[13:58] this week so let's talk about alien pinball real quick the Ripley edition now has Ripley

[14:04] on the left side of the cabinet not sure why the back box has a drag and drop photoshop

[14:11] image of Ripley with the cat that doesn't make any sense pinball brothers if you're

[14:16] going to have all of the game be illustrated or an art style by orc Lawson why would you

[14:22] stop there like you know what I'm saying you were like 95% of the game all looks the same

[14:28] and now you've made one of the panels or two of the panels on the back box just look radically

[14:34] different I think it looks a little lazy I think they should have illustrated over that

[14:39] image and made it look more airbrush the way the rest of the Ripley images look on the

[14:44] game but that being said I'm not going to complain that much because I'm just happy

[14:48] there's an Ellen Ripley version of alien for those of you new to pinball you don't remember

[14:53] the days in which Andrew highway lied to all of us and said that Ripley wasn't available

[15:00] he was lying he just didn't have the money because he didn't know how to run a business

[15:05] and at the same time Ghostbusters came out and featured Sigourney Weaver on Ghostbusters artwork

[15:11] so we knew he was lying then and we know he's lying now he also lied when he said you're not

[15:17] allowed to illustrate alien artwork okay Andrew go look at all the alien comic books that are out

[15:23] there he was lying about that as well because he didn't have the money to really pay a real artist

[15:29] to fully illustrate this game you know he didn't want to do it like he cut corners and if you

[15:33] look at the alien play field it's still one of the worst most uninspired play fields considering

[15:39] the source material and again oric is a creative director he's a designer but he's not a real he's

[15:44] not an artist per se like an illustrator you know what I'm saying like he lays out websites and stuff

[15:49] he couldn't draw that by hand if he had to you know it's nuts too with AI art now you know great AI

[15:56] art is I am really curious how long it's going to take before these pinball companies realize

[16:01] like what they're going to be able to create using AI artists so they're not paying like a regular

[16:07] artist like six figures but here's the thing the really good artists and I mean this the really

[16:11] good artists are going to start to use AI as a tool themselves because you still have to put in all

[16:17] the right prompts to get back the right stuff huge shakeup happening in the art world due to

[16:22] artificial intelligence so we'll see if that will make its way to pinball again especially as Stern

[16:27] becomes obsessed with the almighty dollar and so does jersey jack are they going to start looking

[16:32] at areas in which they can save money by using new technologies all right what else is going on in

[16:38] pinball everybody's still waiting for pulp fiction I think we're going to see it by the end of this

[16:42] year I don't think we're going to see le's until sometime in February March and here's my fear a

[16:47] little bit about pulp fiction I do think the hype is going to die down once jaws hits when jaws hits

[16:54] it's going to create a seismic event in the pinball market it's going to create a moment that we've

[17:00] been waiting for let me be candid here for a minute I think most of us have been truly

[17:05] underwhelmed by the magic we've seen in pinball over the last couple of years foo fighters shot

[17:12] great great layout fun game they did so much with the code we never thought they would do if that was

[17:18] just a music pin none of us would really love it but they really got creative with it and they did

[17:24] the most they could with that theme but it's still a game where the le lost three thousand dollars in

[17:29] value why is that because of the theme right it's just not a theme most people want and even though

[17:35] they executed it so brilliantly and I still think jack danger is going to win game of the year with

[17:39] foo fighters it's just not going to go down in history as a game that won over people the way

[17:46] godzilla did all right what else do we get toy story four and godfather were both flops by jersey

[17:52] jack pinball none of those games won people over those games are sinking lead balloons it's like

[17:57] catching a falling knife each of those games has lost three to four thousand dollars in value and

[18:02] we're at the point now where a toy story le is about to sell for like seventy five hundred bucks

[18:07] and godfather is not far behind and those games are never going to come back in popularity okay

[18:13] then we've got galactic tank force don't even need to waste much time on that game that was a colossal

[18:19] failure so there really hasn't been anything over the last two years that really won over the pinball

[18:26] buying community quite like godzilla quite like a Keith elwin pin and so when this game comes out

[18:33] I think it's going to be the game so many people have been waiting for a game that just checks so

[18:39] many boxes plays beautifully hopefully looks beautifully has a theme that everybody recognizes

[18:45] and is just damn pinball fun and we know this you know this I know this the team that Keith elwin

[18:51] has over there is the best team in all of pinball right now they are better than everybody else they

[18:57] are leagues better than everybody else he gets the best code he gets the best art he gets the best

[19:03] design he gets the best use of the bomb he knows how to use the bomb better than everybody else I

[19:09] mean godzilla only had a hundred dollars more bomb than led zeppelin right elton john came out

[19:15] that that went over the pinball buying community no like look the games are still sitting there I mean

[19:19] it's kind of embarrassing like they're not going to sell out of elton john's c e's maybe ever and

[19:24] again there's a reason why they launched elton john so early because they're nervous they are

[19:29] absolutely terrified over at jersey jack pinball the moment jaws drops they know people are not

[19:36] going to spend 12 to 15 thousand dollars on an elton john pin even though it shoots well even

[19:42] though the layout is great even though the light show is spectacular they know there's not much in

[19:48] it though there really isn't if you turn off the lights and you just look down at elton john

[19:53] mechanically what are you really seeing that's worth 12 to 15 thousand dollars and so yes I much

[19:59] rather sight unseen commit 13 thousand dollars to a jaws le which I know is going to hold value

[20:07] or go up in value versus buying an elton john where the cardboard box is going to be worth 4

[20:13] thousand dollars by texas pinball festival you're going to see elton john le's for like 9

[20:19] thousand dollars for 8500 and you're going to see the c e's for 11 thousand dollars I don't care

[20:25] how good the pin shoots it doesn't matter it's not a theme that people are going to want to bolt

[20:30] to their floor for very long and trust me like the kaleidoscope screensaver code in that game

[20:36] is going to get so old and it's going to get exposed for being a lackluster use of the screen

[20:42] when we see what stern does with jaws I mean look at what stern did with foo fighters we really

[20:47] haven't talked about it that much but foo fighters is one of the most impressive illustrations and

[20:53] code that has ever appeared on an lcd screen and stern's going to keep doing it better they're

[20:58] going to put even more in Keith elwin's jaws and they might have to if they don't have the movie

[21:02] assets right they might really have to put a lot into this game to make sure fans of that franchise

[21:08] are satisfied you know so that's where we're at people two underwhelming years and during those

[21:14] two underwhelming years prices have gone through the roof the world has changed the buy buy buy

[21:21] mentality is over it is why buy now but if there is a time where you need to buy buy buy it is when

[21:28] it's a keith elwin game so just trust me when I say this get on a list and it will do you no harm

[21:36] if you wait and you miss out you're gonna regret it and you'll always be able to sell your Keith

[21:41] elwin jaws le for at least 13 000 it is what it is people the only thing that would hurt that value

[21:50] is if they come out with an anniversary edition close to the release of the le I don't think it's

[21:55] gonna happen I think they're gonna wait a year because the jaws anniversary is in 2025 and here's

[22:01] what gets exciting people is like we've got a keith elwin game at the beginning of this year and 2024

[22:07] is going to be bookended with back to the future so we get keith elwin jaws at the beginning of the

[22:12] year and back to the future from dutch pinball at the end of the year and if you ask me I think

[22:18] they're gonna be the talk of the town I think it's gonna be those two games and yes pulp fiction is

[22:23] cool but by the time it comes out I do think hype is gonna die down a bit you know I think people

[22:28] are gonna realize it is still a single level game there's no LCD screen you know no one's

[22:34] owned a pulp fiction yet will it last in your home after like 500 plays are you gonna be sick of it

[22:40] or are you still gonna enjoy the experience we shall see you know modern pinball is modern pinball

[22:45] and when you remove the screen we haven't really had a modern single level game like that stay in

[22:51] people's collections very long I mean there's a reason why people are selling these James Bond

[22:56] 60th even though they shoot well there's just not a lot in the game everybody thank you so much happy

[23:01] Monday again another shout out to Steve Jablonsky you know I'm gonna keep shouting him out until

[23:06] someone else joins his realm at a hundred dollars a month and hey I just want to say this if anyone's

[23:10] coming to New York City during the holiday season this is a popular tourist destination please let

[23:17] me know hit me up on private message and let's go get a drink let's talk pinball let's maybe have

[23:22] some omokase if you're a member of the omokase club everybody have a great Monday we'll talk to you

[23:27] soon get in on a jaws le list later

[23:57] you

[24:10] you
