[00:00] I want to surrender, oh!

[00:25] Welcome to episode 204 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:28] I'm your host, Canada, coming at you from New York City.

[00:32] What do I want to talk about this Monday?

[00:34] Why I want to talk about the new player

[00:37] in the Pinball world that keeps saying

[00:40] that I've got like a megaphone and sort of like that.

[00:43] I'm not this professional media channel for Pinball,

[00:46] but I want to just stop, call timeout,

[00:49] and sort of look at this whole thing

[00:52] from a bird's eye view.

[00:54] And look, all of us who are part of Pinball,

[00:57] we're all in this little microcosm community.

[01:01] We want Pinball to be enjoyable.

[01:04] We want Pinball to be fun.

[01:06] We want to get excitement and entertainment

[01:09] out of a Pinball machine.

[01:10] And we want to be part of a community

[01:13] that is fun to be a part of.

[01:14] And look, for the most part, Pinball is totally that.

[01:18] It is a lot of fun to play Pinball.

[01:21] It's a lot of fun to go to Pinball shows.

[01:24] It's also fun to listen to all the great Pinball content

[01:27] that is out there, OK?

[01:29] Now, not everything that goes on in the Pinball world

[01:33] is always positive.

[01:35] And not every Pinball personality out there in the world

[01:39] makes people feel good, all right?

[01:42] Now look, I think over the past five years,

[01:45] we've all sort of rode the roller coaster,

[01:47] the ups and downs of the promise of new Pinball companies

[01:52] coming into the Pinball space to either revolutionize

[01:56] or innovate or bring new Pinball out into the world.

[02:00] And we've seen with mixed results how those ventures have

[02:04] turned out.

[02:05] Some have succeeded, some have failed.

[02:07] You know who they are.

[02:08] I don't have to go over them again with you right now.

[02:11] Now look, I've asked Robert Mueller to come on the show

[02:14] to talk about deep-rood Pinball.

[02:16] It's OK.

[02:17] I get that he didn't want to come on

[02:19] Canadian Pinball podcast.

[02:21] I still, you know, the invitation is open.

[02:23] I don't know the man personally.

[02:25] I don't, so I don't have any personal grudge against them.

[02:30] I am not creating a scenario.

[02:32] He says that this podcast, he says that people have sort

[02:36] of made it a nightmare for them.

[02:37] And I want to say to Robert and his team over there,

[02:40] deep-rood, nothing, we're not trying

[02:42] to create a nightmare for any Pinball company, all right?

[02:46] We're not.

[02:46] We're just trying to call it like it is.

[02:48] And I think they understand the blowback

[02:50] that they got for working with John Papaduke.

[02:53] And all I want, all I want, and all I know you guys want,

[02:56] is I want results.

[02:58] I don't care what people say anymore.

[03:00] I think anyone who covers this hobby,

[03:03] here's a lot of talk, a lot of intention, a lot of what

[03:06] the plans are.

[03:07] And we've seen more times than not, those plans not work out.

[03:12] So that's all people are asking for.

[03:14] And I totally agree with Robert.

[03:16] If they can succeed at doing what they want to do,

[03:19] then the past will be the past.

[03:21] Absolutely, absolutely, that is the case.

[03:24] If Highway Pinball can get aliens out the door,

[03:27] then people will forget about the past.

[03:30] Same thing with Dutch Pinball, all people want.

[03:33] All they've ever wanted is a pinball company

[03:36] to deliver what they promised, OK?

[03:39] Now that being said, that being said.

[03:42] So Robert went on the podcast.

[03:45] I want to get the correct name of the podcast for you,

[03:49] because I just finished listening to it.

[03:51] It was about like a 15 minute interview.

[03:54] I think it's a lecture games podcast with Dennis,

[03:57] who's the host.

[03:57] It's a very good podcast.

[03:59] I think Dennis did an amazing job asking questions.

[04:02] I found it funny, though, because it didn't end a day.

[04:05] Look, who has the most richer influence in the pinball world

[04:08] and the pinball community?

[04:10] And it's not Dennis's show.

[04:11] I mean, if you look at it,

[04:12] he gets about 250 listeners per episode.

[04:16] We get 1,000 more people than that, who tune in every week.

[04:20] So as much as I think certain people out there,

[04:23] and maybe Robert is saying this, maybe he's not directly

[04:25] saying this, sort of trying to question whether we're

[04:28] a positive, legitimate media channel within the pinball world,

[04:33] I think I'm here to tell him.

[04:35] And I think all of the people who listen to this show

[04:37] would agree, yes, we are.

[04:39] Like this is where you go if you want to talk about pinball

[04:44] to the most people.

[04:46] So from a marketing standpoint, you

[04:47] might want to avoid my show because you might not think

[04:50] I'll be fair and balanced, but I totally would.

[04:53] But it's OK.

[04:53] It's OK.

[04:55] So I listened to the entire interview.

[04:57] And I wanted to just extract some of what Robert said

[05:00] and sort of break it up and let you hear it now.

[05:02] This is about like, in eight minutes, eight to nine minutes,

[05:06] the greatest hits will call it of the things

[05:08] that Robert was talking about.

[05:10] Listen to this.

[05:11] Listen to everything he says.

[05:12] And then I'll just give some of my sort of point of view

[05:16] on what was talked about in the interview.

[05:18] But I think there's a lot.

[05:19] There was a lot of information.

[05:20] And we also just saw today that Zambiyeti, Jeremy Packer,

[05:24] and Deeproot have come to a resolution for 11 titles.

[05:29] 11 titles that Jeremy worked on with John, which

[05:34] is kind of crazy because if you think about it,

[05:36] people who paid money for Magic Girl Pimball and Raza,

[05:39] their money actually went to making designs for 11 titles.

[05:45] So it's pretty clear where all the J-Pop money went.

[05:47] It went into this scatterbrained process

[05:50] that all these little things were being worked on.

[05:53] But that's interesting.

[05:55] There's 11 unreleased games out there

[05:58] that might see the light of day.

[05:59] But without further ado, when you guys

[06:02] to listen to Robert, and then we'll come back in.

[06:05] And I'll give some of my two cents on the whole thing.

[06:08] We know what we were getting into.

[06:10] So we're very understanding that there's

[06:14] a lot of people out there in a very small industry here

[06:17] who have megaphone splatters and they probably should.

[06:20] And they have definitely made our life a nightmare.

[06:25] We need to say enough to get did where customers

[06:29] to believe that we're going to follow through with our promises.

[06:32] But not too much that gives away

[06:34] a lot of our trade secrets.

[06:35] And there's a lot of those that we're trying to keep.

[06:38] More so than any other Pimball manufacturers, all of them

[06:41] put together, at times probably a couple of multiples.

[06:45] We have had to present enough of a picture out there

[06:49] for them to understand that we will be a major player.

[06:53] Other manufacturers, I'll just leave it at that,

[06:55] have had lots of excuses as far as vendors or problems

[07:00] apart and sourcing and things like that.

[07:02] Those are problems that every manufacturer has.

[07:04] And we know we will have those as well.

[07:06] But we think our quad assembly system will be able to make

[07:10] those, even minimize them or make them

[07:12] completely irrelevant.

[07:14] And we'll be able to do more with less space.

[07:18] So well, we might not have the huge volume of space

[07:21] that Stern has now.

[07:23] We won't need that.

[07:24] We could probably do more with 25,000 square feet

[07:26] than Stern could do with 100,000.

[07:28] I mean, I could say we could manufacture 100.

[07:32] A day, I could tell you, we can next manufacture one a day.

[07:35] I could give you numbers, but no one's going to believe them.

[07:38] And the only thing people are going to believe is when they

[07:40] can come and buy a deeper Pimball machine,

[07:43] they're going to have it within two weeks, two weeks, two weeks,

[07:44] two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two weeks,

[07:46] two weeks, the buying it, no waiting or anything else.

[07:49] And that's going to make more of the difference.

[07:51] And drive more people to buy from us than elsewhere.

[07:54] We have probably 25 to 30 patents in process.

[08:00] And that is extremely complicated.

[08:03] And we want to get what we're doing protected and locked down.

[08:08] And unfortunately, even seeing the general look at the cabinet

[08:12] will give away a lot of what we're doing.

[08:14] And so it's very difficult for us, prior to the five days

[08:18] of deep roots, to get a machine with that look out

[08:22] so many issues with incomplete code, the late code.

[08:27] And you have these long, long, crazy, long development cycles

[08:32] where you've gone nine months, two years, and years,

[08:35] and years trying to get this insane code rule set out.

[08:39] It's just unheard of.

[08:41] And I think that it's going to be hard for the other manufacturers

[08:46] to keep up with us once we kind of let the public see what

[08:51] we're doing.

[08:51] And I think it'll be a basically a breath of fresh air.

[08:55] Not only is it not hard to create a rule set,

[08:58] I mean, there's a lot of things to kind of see

[09:00] that other people have done to kind of build on,

[09:02] or that it plays directly to the certain theme that year,

[09:05] that pinball machine is actually playing on.

[09:10] But I think for our standpoint is

[09:14] that we have been able to come up with some good rule sets

[09:17] ourselves.

[09:18] John Norse is just a rule set.

[09:20] He's the one who kind of started the pin golf movement,

[09:23] which was very innovative.

[09:26] And so John Norse is just like confidently telling me,

[09:28] oh, this would be a great rule set.

[09:30] This would be a great thing.

[09:31] This would be a good thing.

[09:32] So John Norse is really spearheaded that.

[09:34] And then I would say you know a lot of people

[09:36] would disagree.

[09:37] I can tell you internally, JayCrop is very good

[09:40] with rule set as well.

[09:41] We don't want to, it's not mean we don't want to hear

[09:43] from anyone at pinball, we don't want to start

[09:45] the foundation of what we're doing based upon people

[09:48] in that echo chamber.

[09:50] And we're going to be doing some crazy things

[09:53] that I don't want to go into detail,

[09:55] because I want to keep the excitement for the five days

[09:57] of Jupiter when we tell everyone how we're doing code.

[10:01] And I think it will, people will go, oh my gosh,

[10:04] that's such an amazing idea.

[10:06] Why hasn't anyone done that before?

[10:09] And then they're going to go, wow, OK.

[10:12] So what do we do with this now?

[10:14] What opportunities do we have now to work with code and rule

[10:18] set?

[10:19] And where do we go?

[10:20] So it's going to really revolutionize how code is done.

[10:24] And in the number behind the scene,

[10:26] but also how it's used by players and operators

[10:31] for that matter out in the field.

[10:33] If I were to tell you exactly what we are doing,

[10:35] it would blow everyone's mind.

[10:37] But yet again, it would be like, oh my gosh,

[10:39] why hasn't anyone else been doing this all along?

[10:41] It makes so much sense.

[10:43] I've offered a couple of parts distributors,

[10:47] the exclusive opportunity to warehouse and sell

[10:53] deeper parts because we don't want to be in the parts

[10:55] business.

[10:57] Those talks are still ongoing.

[10:59] I think there's a much better option for us

[11:01] than having and controlling all those parts in house

[11:05] for either people that want to put those parts in their own

[11:09] homebrew project or they need replacement parts for our

[11:12] machines.

[11:13] Our warranties will be better than anyone else in the

[11:17] industry by multiples.

[11:19] So I will give a teeth.

[11:21] And that is we're going to take a sledgehammer to a play

[11:24] field if it leaves a mark.

[11:26] It doesn't ship.

[11:27] Well, and I'll leave it at that.

[11:30] OK.

[11:31] Every play field leaving our facility that's put into a game

[11:36] will have a sledgehammer take into it.

[11:38] And if it leaves a mark, it does not ship.

[11:42] That's the standard I set.

[11:44] OK.

[11:44] That's what is your question.

[11:46] That's what we're going to keep to.

[11:48] All right.

[11:49] Well, that's an easy standard to measure for people.

[11:52] So I have something to check against.

[11:54] I think it was very difficult for the other manufacturers

[11:57] to compete with us.

[11:59] It will be very difficult for even some of us to turn to

[12:02] compete with what we're doing.

[12:05] And it actually has been a major selling point to

[12:08] the licensors, many of whom are no pinball.

[12:13] We like to do a pinball title with their license.

[12:17] But don't really like the price points that other

[12:20] manufacturers are at.

[12:22] So that's one of the easier things in the licensing talks

[12:26] is price points.

[12:29] We have not.

[12:29] And I'll just be honest.

[12:30] We have not had any distributors.

[12:32] Well, maybe section one, reach out to us.

[12:36] And we're perfectly fine with that.

[12:40] I think that we have reached out to some unconventional types

[12:45] of distribution opportunities.

[12:48] And we're going to be continuing to do so to look at getting

[12:54] deeper out there to the map.

[12:55] And it is really about family.

[12:58] And having families have that nostalgic vintage American feel

[13:03] with the pinball machine in their house.

[13:05] Motor operators, I think, will just come as they are.

[13:08] And yeah, so I'll leave the answer to that.

[13:12] We started designing Byerself.

[13:14] And what we found in working with J-Pop is he's just,

[13:19] I think there's a, we live in a very

[13:22] caustic environment these days where I think things are

[13:29] taking to the ends of the spectrum.

[13:32] And so while there's animosity about J-Pop, J-Pop,

[13:36] the guy that I have a friendship with, I hug him when he comes.

[13:39] I hug him when he goes away.

[13:41] I love, it goes back up still in the way.

[13:43] I love his family.

[13:46] I really don't see John bringing on John as a challenge.

[13:49] Now, dealing with the big megaphone's out there,

[13:52] especially with people who have no interest whatsoever

[13:56] in the Zidware mess.

[13:58] That's the difference with us.

[13:59] It doesn't matter how many people hate us

[14:02] because of J-Pop.

[14:03] Or once you with their megaphone to the small industry here,

[14:07] try to take us down because of that.

[14:10] We made our decision.

[14:11] We're sticking with the decision.

[14:13] We're going to make this happen.

[14:14] And there's nothing they can do about it other than just

[14:17] to be shown for what they are at the end of the day.

[14:19] Well, I've got several designers now that are being paid

[14:23] a lot of money.

[14:24] There are other podcaps out there that constantly talk about,

[14:29] probably seem to come on and never came on.

[14:31] Which you're scared to come on.

[14:33] I don't think it has anything to do with that.

[14:34] What I really like about Etoni is that

[14:36] y'all are very fair, you're very thorough.

[14:39] And I'm personally very appreciative of that

[14:42] because some of these podcaps and online sources,

[14:48] they act like media, very professional,

[14:50] and then others don't.

[14:51] And so I'm very appreciative for the hard work

[14:54] that you put in that's unpaid and probably well deserved.

[14:59] And it was well deserved praise

[15:01] because I think Dennis did a great job with the interview.

[15:04] I think he asked a lot of the questions

[15:05] that were on everyone's mind.

[15:07] And look, I think we're all at the same point now

[15:10] where I just want to see the results.

[15:13] Okay, and I also want to give Robert some advice

[15:16] because I do think he's sort of, for some unknown reason,

[15:21] sort of he's like creating the NWO.

[15:23] Remember when the whole call game went bad

[15:25] and it was like we're the bad guys in wrestling?

[15:28] It's almost like he wants to be in this position

[15:32] of being like the evil empire pinball company

[15:35] that everyone's betting against

[15:37] and he's gonna prove wrong, right?

[15:39] Like they're constructing the death star

[15:41] of pinball machines that's gonna blow end or sky high.

[15:45] And I just really, after hearing all of it,

[15:49] after hearing them talk, after hearing

[15:51] like the conversation on Pinside,

[15:54] I kind of am just left feeling like this isn't,

[15:58] it's a fun, like this isn't how it should be.

[16:01] This isn't the way you start a pinball company.

[16:05] And that's sort of feeling that it's kind of like them

[16:08] versus us and they almost want it that way.

[16:12] We're like, we're here, we're gonna prove everybody wrong.

[16:14] We're gonna prove not just like the skeptics,

[16:17] we're also gonna prove that every other pinball manufacturer

[16:20] out there is doing it wrong.

[16:21] Everything we're gonna do is just gonna blow people away

[16:24] and everyone's gonna say, why didn't we think of that?

[16:27] And everyone's gonna, we can build anywhere

[16:29] from a hundred games a day.

[16:31] If I told you the number, you wouldn't believe it.

[16:34] We're gonna figure out a way to do code and rule sets

[16:38] that no one else has ever figured out.

[16:39] It's just too much for me to process

[16:43] that all people ever wanted was just a working magic girl.

[16:48] It didn't need to come with all of these lofty promises.

[16:52] It didn't need to come at the expense

[16:55] of talking shit about other manufacturers.

[16:57] It didn't need to come with, you know,

[16:59] we're the bad guys and you guys,

[17:01] you're gonna E. Cro Canada when you see what we're really doing.

[17:03] It didn't need to come with all of that.

[17:06] All people ever wanted was pinball machines

[17:09] that looked great, were great quality, were fun to play.

[17:13] And they just wanted John's games that worked.

[17:16] That's all they wanted.

[17:17] Now the part that Robert's missing,

[17:19] he's missing some of the forest through the trees though.

[17:23] So the reason why people went in on Zidware games

[17:26] is they paid a lot of money

[17:28] for a very limited production J-Pop game.

[17:31] And if he removes the limited production quality

[17:36] that's attached to magic girl in Ranzza,

[17:38] what he's gonna be in an even new sticky-ickie situation

[17:41] because people who paid the money

[17:43] aren't gonna accept the fact

[17:44] that these games are now gonna be made in mass volume.

[17:47] So I don't know what they're gonna do there.

[17:49] He also, there's other things going on behind the scene

[17:53] when it comes to the IP and the Zidware games

[17:55] that he's probably not even aware of.

[17:58] He probably should ask John how the IP transfer,

[18:01] what was in that contract with American pinball and

[18:04] and

[18:09] what the terms and conditions were that John had a meat

[18:10] for that IP to transfer over

[18:12] because those terms were not met.

[18:14] Anyway, but I don't even care anymore.

[18:16] I don't care.

[18:17] I don't care about the legalities.

[18:19] I don't care about all the legal speak.

[18:22] I don't care about the threats that if you poo-poo us

[18:24] on a podcast, then your claim goes away.

[18:28] I'm just calling for Robert to just stop.

[18:32] Stop with this approach of me versus you,

[18:35] of us versus the community.

[18:37] It's just not fun.

[18:39] It's just not gonna build a consumer base for him.

[18:42] It's not gonna build goodwill.

[18:44] Ironically, that's what they're trying to call the plans

[18:47] with his hardware customers.

[18:49] It's just do your job, man.

[18:51] Just do it.

[18:52] As I said, I will happily be the first person

[18:56] that buys a deep root machine.

[18:59] And again, I just think the language

[19:03] and the strident sort of arrogant,

[19:05] sort of overly confident terminology they're throwing out.

[19:09] It just isn't necessary.

[19:11] See, I'd be more excited if he said,

[19:13] hey, we're working on a lot of really fun stuff

[19:16] where approaching this a little bit differently,

[19:18] I think everyone's gonna be very satisfied

[19:20] with what they see.

[19:21] I don't wanna say anything more

[19:24] until we're ready to show the world what we're working on.

[19:26] And we're gonna go away.

[19:28] And we're gonna come back out sometime next year

[19:30] to show you the fruits of our labor.

[19:32] We love pinball.

[19:33] We love what everyone else is bringing to pinball.

[19:35] But we're gonna go about it a little bit differently, okay?

[19:38] But he didn't say that.

[19:39] He didn't come out like that.

[19:41] It is, I mean, he's literally saying

[19:43] that he thinks it's gonna be very hard for stern pinball

[19:46] with 30 plus years experience making pinball machines,

[19:50] 30 plus years of setting up a distribution model,

[19:53] of working with parts and vendors,

[19:55] 30 plus years of designing and coding,

[19:58] everything that Stern knows institutionally,

[20:01] deep-root pinball who has never made a single game ever

[20:05] is now saying that they think it's gonna be very hard

[20:07] for Stern to compete with them.

[20:08] And that's just it.

[20:10] That's, I kinda just, I hear comments like that.

[20:13] And I purposely chopped up the two weeks

[20:16] because it's like Robert.

[20:17] The easiest piece of advice you can get from this podcast

[20:20] is never say the word two weeks.

[20:23] Never, never, just never say it.

[20:24] It's that word is the ultimate cardinal sin,

[20:29] the term two weeks of when you're promising someone something.

[20:32] You can't say it and we know why

[20:34] thanks to Mr. Andrew Highway.

[20:36] All right, that's deep-root.

[20:38] Take it or leave it.

[20:39] I think we're now in a long waiting game, all right?

[20:43] I look forward to seeing these guys at TPS.

[20:45] Again, there's no bad feelings.

[20:46] I mean, he can say that I have a megaphone

[20:48] that I'm creating a nightmare.

[20:49] I think you guys listen to this podcast,

[20:52] not because I create nightmares for people who love pinball.

[20:56] It's because I think I try to get at some sort of truth

[20:58] of what's going on in this hobby.

[21:00] All right, what else is going on in the news?

[21:02] There's not too much.

[21:03] There's not too much.

[21:04] I'll say what I loved is I actually went on the last podcast

[21:08] and I said, hey guys, email me.

[21:10] I got a lot more email.

[21:11] So I want to go down and read more of your feedback

[21:14] to the show.

[21:14] And again, I'm going to just go down the list.

[21:17] I actually like reading these emails for the first time

[21:20] when I record versus taking notes.

[21:23] So let's start off.

[21:24] I got an email from Dave Sanders over at Highway Pinball

[21:27] about pinball marketing as the subject head.

[21:30] And Dave said, I think one of the other major differences

[21:34] between 90s pinball and now, as far as this concept of magic

[21:38] goes, is not only was 90s pinball not made for collectors

[21:41] to buy, but neither was there any marketing or advanced

[21:44] publicity in that area towards anyone

[21:46] outside of the amusement industry.

[21:48] A player would see a new machine without any preconceived notions

[21:52] of what said machine was about.

[21:54] Consequently, the goal wasn't so much

[21:56] to give people what they want, but what they didn't know

[21:59] they actually wanted.

[22:01] All right, on a related note, it wasn't until Gary Stern

[22:04] was the last person left making pinball

[22:05] that the notion of every pinball needed to be licensed

[22:08] took root.

[22:09] Arguably, this is only because A, nobody else

[22:12] was around to disprove it and B, the original games

[22:15] from the early years of data east in the late 80s

[22:18] didn't have the means of living up

[22:20] to the creative brainstorms that Williams had

[22:23] to achieve their games.

[22:24] All right, well, Dave, look, I do think

[22:27] that you raised a good point.

[22:30] I would say that I think one of the big issues with new pinball

[22:33] now is that we know about these machines so far in advance

[22:37] that by the time the games come out,

[22:39] it's really hard to keep the marketing hype alive.

[22:42] What I loved about the 90s arcades in general, just life

[22:45] in general, is we didn't exhaust stuff to the point that by the time

[22:50] we actually went to the concert, we already

[22:52] saw the concert on YouTube.

[22:54] We know the whole set list.

[22:56] When we walked into an arcade, we saw a new machine,

[22:59] our new pinball machine for the first time.

[23:01] And I'm like, wow, that's new.

[23:02] I'm going to jump on it.

[23:03] The ability to create serendipitous moments

[23:07] of surprising delight is so hard now because of leaks,

[23:11] because of rumors, because of spoilers,

[23:13] and even because of manufacturers inability

[23:16] to just shut up until the game is ready.

[23:19] And I think this desire to build early hype

[23:22] always backfires on pinball manufacturers.

[23:25] I've never seen an example where it actually

[23:28] helped to go out too early on a pinball machine.

[23:31] But Dave, thank you for listening to the show.

[23:33] I really appreciate the note.

[23:35] All right, I got this email from Christian,

[23:38] and I got a lot of people to link to me

[23:40] about this whole thing.

[23:41] The subject was Supreme Pinball by Stern.

[23:45] What do you think of Stern going in collaboration

[23:48] with the brand Supreme for Pinball Machine?

[23:51] Will it sell well and to a new pinball target?

[23:54] All right, and I saw a lot of people chiming in about how

[23:56] stupid this was, how the world of Supreme and high-end fashion

[24:00] doesn't have any business being with pinball.

[24:03] I want to tackle this from multiple angles.

[24:05] The first angle is this.

[24:07] And I've been to pinball shows all over the country.

[24:10] I've met many of you at pinball shows,

[24:12] and I have to say, without a doubt,

[24:15] the pinball community probably has the worst fashion sense

[24:20] on the planet, okay?

[24:21] I know that you guys don't like fashion,

[24:24] and that's okay.

[24:25] It's okay.

[24:26] We don't go to pinball shows with our sartorial hats on.

[24:31] We literally go there just to relax and have fun.

[24:34] But look, there's no denying the fact

[24:36] that the fashion industry is a big industry,

[24:38] and that fashion also understands creating collectible items

[24:43] that people go after.

[24:44] It's very similar to pinball in terms of like

[24:47] the collector mentality.

[24:48] Like people will collect stuff that Supreme makes.

[24:52] And I've always found Supreme to be a little strange

[24:54] in the sense that people will pay like $100 to buy a brick,

[24:59] just a red brick that has the word Supreme on it.

[25:02] But they have done something very revolutionary

[25:06] in the fashion world,

[25:07] and they basically just created a brand

[25:10] that people collect the items with the name Supreme on it.

[25:12] I don't get it.

[25:13] I don't personally place value on that.

[25:17] But here's the thing.

[25:18] If you want to expand pinball to a new market

[25:22] or just show people that pinball is still very relevant in 2018,

[25:27] then a partnership with Supreme is freaking genius.

[25:31] And I think it's really smart

[25:32] that Stern is doing this.

[25:33] It's not for you, right?

[25:35] So they might sell this pinball machine for $40,000.

[25:38] I don't know, someone threw out a dumb number like that.

[25:40] But in the end of the day, the end of the day,

[25:43] Supreme making one of their most sought after exclusive items

[25:47] or most expensive item of all time from Supreme.

[25:50] If that item is a pinball machine,

[25:52] then I wouldn't cry or complain about it.

[25:55] I actually think it's really smart marketing.

[25:57] And I think it gets the word out there to a broader audience.

[26:00] And again, I think it puts pinball on center stage

[26:04] within a whole other area out there.

[26:07] Just to show you guys how fashion is so lucrative,

[26:11] the Gucci store on Fifth Avenue alone,

[26:14] the salesman told me this,

[26:15] they made $80 million in one year

[26:18] from just that location.

[26:20] That's probably more profit than all pinball companies combine.

[26:24] All right, I got an email from,

[26:27] let's see, let's see, I'm going on my list from Gregor,

[26:32] Weissberger, he said, hey Chris,

[26:33] congratulations to your demon, looks awesome.

[26:36] Since you're into fast cars and already not opposed

[26:39] to automatics anymore, would you consider

[26:42] buying the next generation Tesla Roadster

[26:43] that will get you from zero to 16 under two seconds?

[26:47] Or are electric cars out of the question?

[26:49] Thanks, Gregor.

[26:50] Well Gregor, this is a pinball podcast

[26:52] where I occasionally talk about my car, but not really.

[26:56] I would never get a Tesla over an American V8 gas engine,

[27:01] smog inducing, roaring, badass car like a Dodge Demon.

[27:06] I think Tesla's are great, but they're just not for me.

[27:09] I like the visceral elements of American muscle cars.

[27:13] They'd be like playing a pinball machine with no sound.

[27:16] That's what electric cars feel like to me.

[27:17] The experience is there, the sensation of playing pinball

[27:20] would be there, but it's just not the same.

[27:23] All right, I got an email from Damien 8.

[27:25] He said, hey, Canada, I'm a recent follower to your show.

[27:28] And while listening to your episode 200 podcasts,

[27:31] I had an idea I wanted to bring to your attention.

[27:34] As you may have heard, one major issue

[27:36] that Chicago gaming has been having with their remakes

[27:38] is clear coat chipping.

[27:40] It tends to happen on every exposed edge of the game.

[27:44] And according to CGC, it has a lot to do with EPA standards

[27:48] that have changed the materials they use.

[27:51] I own both MMR and Attack from Mars Remake

[27:53] and I have witnessed the chipping firsthand.

[27:56] If you look on Pinside, there are countless accounts

[27:59] of people with this issue, and certainly many more

[28:01] to come as people play.

[28:03] I figured I'd bring it to your attention

[28:05] as you have the voice that carries in this hobby,

[28:07] and it might be what we need to make these manufacturers

[28:09] listen.

[28:10] When you post your concerns on Pinside,

[28:14] you get a shockingly unhelpful reply

[28:16] that are usually from others owners,

[28:17] just telling you to suck it up and play your game.

[28:20] Definitely not the approach we should be taking.

[28:23] Let me know what you think.

[28:24] So, Damien, look, I've been hearing about these issues

[28:28] and I think, first of all, thank you for writing in.

[28:31] And I do think that chipping play fields is inexcusable.

[28:35] It is absolutely inexcusable

[28:37] because there is no reason why we had play fields

[28:41] that were rock solid for decades and all of a sudden

[28:45] when the marketplace became about collectors

[28:49] that play fields now have been plagued by chipping,

[28:52] by ghosted inserts, it's inexcusable.

[28:57] As a manufacturer, the onus is on you

[29:00] to find a way to manufacture something that will hold up

[29:04] to the demands and the standards set by your buyer

[29:08] by the collector's market.

[29:10] And I always scratch my head.

[29:12] A few things, not just that play fields might chip.

[29:15] I don't understand why all new games don't come

[29:19] with mylar and play field protectors put in the areas

[29:24] of the game that are prone to chip.

[29:27] To me, that continues to be the biggest head scratching,

[29:30] what the F are you doing?

[29:32] You're gonna sell someone a seven to nine thousand dollar

[29:35] machine and you can include a $50 worth

[29:39] of play field protectors that will keep your buyer happy.

[29:43] And it just goes to show that either these companies

[29:46] are ignorant to the possible quality issues

[29:49] with play fields these days or they just don't care.

[29:52] They're just trying to get the games out as fast as possible.

[29:55] But it blows my mind.

[29:56] It's like Andrew Highway knew that the area around

[29:59] the LCD screen would chip and then it'd be mylar there

[30:02] and they didn't put mylar down.

[30:04] And so Jersey Jack went through the same thing

[30:06] when dialed in was having all those issues

[30:08] with like the SIM card scoop,

[30:10] they had to hardly get a fix going.

[30:13] But again, all the testing in the world should have shown them

[30:16] that that area is prone to chip.

[30:18] Now I don't understand why we can't get clear coat

[30:21] that doesn't chip.

[30:22] I don't, I mean, I don't buy the excuses.

[30:25] I just don't.

[30:26] So if I bought a machine and the clear coat chipped,

[30:30] I would be so pissed off.

[30:31] Now I'll say this, I'll say this.

[30:33] The reason why I'm day one before I flipped a single ball

[30:37] on Batman, I put a play field protector in the game.

[30:40] Is exactly the reason that you were talking about

[30:44] is there is no peace of mind in pinball.

[30:47] If you're a collector, if you have to worry

[30:49] about your play field denigrating.

[30:51] And I also think every pinball manufacturer should work

[30:55] with the guys over there in Germany

[30:57] to make play field protectors available

[31:00] to order from the factory.

[31:01] So the game can arrive on day one

[31:04] without a single dimple or chip play field

[31:06] or scratch on the clear coat covered

[31:09] nicely by the play field protector.

[31:10] I just think that's the way it should be.

[31:12] And it's so much easier to install that at the factory.

[31:15] It's a pain in the ass to install those things

[31:18] and having to tear the play field apart

[31:20] when you get a brand new game.

[31:22] All right.

[31:23] So thank you for that email.

[31:24] I got an email from Dan Donnell.

[31:25] He said, hi Chris, after watching the Twippies,

[31:27] I decided to give your podcast a shot.

[31:29] And holy shit, it is great.

[31:31] Thanks Dan for the note.

[31:33] I had no idea about all the drama,

[31:35] the pinball industry.

[31:36] And I appreciate you bringing it to the forefront

[31:38] so audaciously.

[31:40] I was wondering if you have ever considered going

[31:42] or invited to any pinball expo

[31:44] to share your wealth of knowledge and opinions

[31:47] on the current state of the pinball industry.

[31:49] I feel that there are many others like me

[31:51] that are blindly enjoying this hobby

[31:53] and uninformed about everything behind the play field.

[31:56] Keep doing what you're doing.

[31:58] Love the Brenda episodes.

[31:59] My wife can definitely relate to her.

[32:02] Your news, your news,

[32:04] wait, he said something about subscriber Dan.

[32:07] PS, F Hilton, whoever he is, whatever.

[32:11] No, Hilton's not that bad, Dan.

[32:12] He's not that bad.

[32:13] Well Dan, thank you for the email.

[32:14] And thank you for listening to the show.

[32:16] What do you think, guys?

[32:18] Should I have a seminar at one of the pinball expos?

[32:21] It would probably be like two people in the audience

[32:23] who would listen to me.

[32:24] But I go to most, I'm going to go to T.P.F. I think.

[32:27] I usually go to Allentown.

[32:29] I'll probably be at the New York tournament

[32:31] that takes place coming up in a few months.

[32:33] I love going to pinball shows.

[32:35] When I go to the shows, people usually recognize me

[32:37] for the most part who listens to the show

[32:39] and say they enjoy the show.

[32:41] It would be fun to host a seminar or a panel discussion

[32:45] with Canada, maybe as the MC of that panel discussion.

[32:49] So look, I think this though is my best medium.

[32:53] I think the podcast and my voice here works the best,

[32:57] but I would happily, if anyone out there at a show

[33:00] wants to fly me there as a special guest

[33:01] to do to moderate or be involved in your show in any way,

[33:06] I'll consider it.

[33:07] I'll consider it.

[33:09] We'll see.

[33:10] All right, I got an email from, it says,

[33:13] Spooky Rumors was the headline from Jeff As.

[33:15] He said, listen to your recent rumors podcast

[33:18] and heard you mentioned a departure at Spooky.

[33:21] There are four potential candidates.

[33:23] Luke who runs manufacturing, but I don't think

[33:25] he'd ever be disloyal.

[33:27] Long-hearn who designs the boards,

[33:29] but I don't think he'd find another opportunity

[33:31] at this one.

[33:33] Fouls mother programmer, and he is young and inexperienced

[33:37] so it wouldn't be him.

[33:38] Hek the game designer and he could find himself

[33:41] in a disagreement and would likely go his own way

[33:43] over differences.

[33:45] He also programs his own game.

[33:46] So while a big loss, he has enough context

[33:49] to get his design made elsewhere.

[33:51] So Hek is my final guess by process of elimination.

[33:55] So what have you heard about and how reliable is your story?

[34:00] PS, found your first 50 podcasts unbearable,

[34:04] but they have improved a lot since

[34:05] and I look forward to new episodes each week.

[34:08] Keep on keeping them honest.

[34:11] Well, Jeff, thank you.

[34:12] I apologize for making you suffer

[34:16] through the first 50 podcasts.

[34:18] I, unbearable, is harsh.

[34:22] Man, they weren't that bad.

[34:24] You want to hear unbearable.

[34:25] There is a whole list of like two to three hour

[34:28] podcast out there that you can either listen

[34:31] to a podcast or watch a Lord of the Rings movie

[34:33] in the same amount of time.

[34:35] But look, those are all good guesses.

[34:38] I think your guess is a good one.

[34:41] I'll just leave it at that.

[34:42] All right, we're gonna go on to,

[34:46] let's see, I got an email from Michael Shaulis.

[34:49] He said, dear, canada, or the brush,

[34:51] carefree motorcycle gang leader who is trying

[34:53] to help others out.

[34:54] Wow, my first email to you and it makes it on the podcast.

[34:57] I don't know if that was good or if the pickings were slim,

[35:01] but it has inspired me to write another

[35:03] with no illusions of hearing another one read.

[35:05] Okay.

[35:06] Here are some of the latest,

[35:08] here are some thoughts on my last podcast.

[35:11] First, while I think you are absolutely right about

[35:13] Jay Poppin Deeproot in making your argument,

[35:16] you explain why they have assembled the expendables.

[35:18] I have been in education for 28 years as a teacher

[35:23] and or administrator working with some really smart kids

[35:25] who go on to some of the most selected colleges in the US.

[35:29] In working with them, you quickly see that some of those

[35:32] with the highest IQs, those that could be labeled genius,

[35:35] are going to struggle in the real world

[35:37] because they can't get anything done.

[35:39] I think that is Jay Pop.

[35:41] His genius as a pinball designer may be at a different level

[35:44] than others in the industry,

[35:46] but if he can't get the job done

[35:47] and the machines don't work, i.e. magic girl,

[35:50] what value is he?

[35:51] Knowing this, Deeproot has hired the expendables

[35:54] to take Jay Pop designs and make them work.

[35:57] At least I think that is the plan.

[36:00] All right, so let me stop there because I agree.

[36:03] I agree that nobody would have any faith in Deeproot pinball

[36:06] if they, if they synced up with Jay Pop

[36:09] and didn't have an army of people around him

[36:13] and surrounding him that they felt confidently

[36:16] could help make these games work.

[36:17] And I do think it gives people confidence

[36:20] that it isn't just John Tinkering.

[36:22] I'll tell you who made the real mistake

[36:23] and that was Dovel over at American Pinball.

[36:26] See, Jay Pop was allowed on Dovel's dime

[36:30] to sit at American Pinball for a year and a half

[36:32] and just do the same shit he did for four years at Zidware.

[36:35] Deeproot is not that and it is not the same

[36:39] as what American Pinball did.

[36:41] And so I think that surrounding him with those who can do

[36:44] is a good idea.

[36:46] Now, again, we're just gonna have to wait and see

[36:49] what happens there.

[36:50] All right, he said, second, the latest episode

[36:53] in which you read my email and address my question

[36:55] about the growing pinball market, make great games.

[37:00] Of course, you have to make great games and company

[37:02] and any company that wants to be successful

[37:04] needs to either make a great product

[37:06] or convince the consumer that the product

[37:07] is something they need to need, great or not.

[37:10] But then I thought more about the profound statement

[37:13] after listening to the rest of the podcast

[37:14] and came away with these thoughts.

[37:16] One, making great games will only sell more games

[37:19] to those who already buy them.

[37:21] So instead of selling 5,000 games to 10,000 buyers,

[37:25] you sell 9,000.

[37:26] But just making great games is not going to have a great effect

[37:29] on the number of players.

[37:31] Doesn't the pinball industry need more players

[37:34] if it hopes to make it as an industry?

[37:37] Number two, he says, great games of the 90s

[37:39] didn't save the industry then.

[37:41] How will it save it?

[37:42] Now, number three, currently there are no great games.

[37:47] All right, so let me tackle those three points

[37:51] that you raised, Michael.

[37:52] So number one, look, pinball market is not growing significantly.

[37:58] It never will.

[37:59] I think, but that doesn't mean that the pinball industry

[38:04] will ever completely go away.

[38:05] As long as there are enough buyers out there

[38:08] to allow the company's in business to make a profit,

[38:12] this industry could remain for a very long time.

[38:17] But again, the long-term prospects for this industry

[38:22] are not good.

[38:23] It will go the way of other toys from yesterday years.

[38:28] There will be no market for it.

[38:32] The world of virtual reality and augmented reality

[38:35] and wearable tech is going to transform the world

[38:38] like nothing has ever before.

[38:41] It's going to be a kind of a sad world

[38:43] where people are just going to be isolated

[38:45] and staring at screens that they wear on their heads.

[38:49] It's going to be sad.

[38:51] But we're saying the beginnings of it now, right?

[38:53] We're seeing the origins of that world go out in public,

[38:57] go anywhere and look at us like robots staring at our phones.

[39:01] Every moment of pause, people whip out their phones

[39:05] and immediately want to avoid human interaction

[39:08] and stare at a screen.

[39:09] We are really headed in the wrong direction.

[39:12] It's sad.

[39:13] I see it every day in the subway,

[39:14] every day in the elevator.

[39:15] Really, you just got into an elevator.

[39:17] You can't just look around you

[39:19] or maybe make a joke like people used to do in elevators,

[39:22] break the ice.

[39:23] Now it's like, oh, I'm on my phone,

[39:24] so don't bother me.

[39:25] It's lame.

[39:27] Number two, great games of the 90s

[39:28] didn't save the industry then.

[39:30] How well would save it now?

[39:31] Well, look, the arcade's got slaughtered

[39:33] because of something called the home council.

[39:36] Why would you need to go to the arcade

[39:39] to play games when you could play from your couch?

[39:42] Again, human beings over time

[39:44] have shown that convenience

[39:46] overrides the desire to go out there

[39:49] because once we leave the den of comfort,

[39:52] something could go wrong.

[39:54] It's like instilled in our DNA

[39:56] that we wanna be able to stay comfortably in our homes

[39:59] and because out in the world,

[40:01] random danger shit happens to us.

[40:04] All right, number three, currently there are no great games.

[40:06] I don't agree with this.

[40:07] There are no great games.

[40:10] I think people are having a lot of fun playing Pimball.

[40:13] I think there are a lot of great new games.

[40:15] If you're not finding enjoyment in any

[40:18] of the current new games out there,

[40:19] I would think that you might struggle

[40:21] to ever enjoy Pimball.

[40:23] I would recommend jumping on a new Batman.

[40:25] I wouldn't recommend jumping on a, you know,

[40:28] a Tron, I would recommend jumping on a dialed in.

[40:31] I would recommend, you know, jumping on a Houdini.

[40:34] I think there's a lot of fun Pimball machine out there.

[40:37] And again, they might not be as good as the games

[40:40] from the 90s, but there are definitely many elements

[40:43] of these games that are far better

[40:44] than the games of the 90s.

[40:46] All right, then he wrote,

[40:47] don't panic, deep root, deep thought.

[40:50] Maybe the answer seems meaningless

[40:52] because the beings who instructed it never actually knew

[40:55] what the question was.

[40:59] I don't know what that means.

[41:00] This was a deep thought.

[41:01] All right, my best above it.

[41:02] All right, Mike, thank you for writing in.

[41:04] I appreciate it.

[41:05] Some good things though, but man,

[41:07] there is some good Pimball out there.

[41:09] Let's see, I got an email from, I think that,

[41:13] I think that might be it because I think I answered

[41:17] all of the new stuff.

[41:20] Maybe this one is new.

[41:21] Did I talk about, I might be in the,

[41:24] this guy writes, this is Jeff, I might be in the minority,

[41:26] but I respectfully disagree that October Fest

[41:29] is a bad license choice.

[41:31] If done right, it would be the awesome opportunity

[41:34] to bring some humor back to Pimball.

[41:35] Think medieval madness.

[41:37] I feel like there is some fun way to drink beers with shots

[41:40] and make flippers weaker or the screen blurrier or something.

[41:43] Second, I've been seeing more and more breweries

[41:45] and beer bars putting in Pimball.

[41:47] That theme would be a perfect fit for their crowd.

[41:50] Last, I think alcohol oriented themes

[41:53] could make the bro and college crowd pump some quarters

[41:56] into the machine and obviously us Pinnets would play regardless

[41:59] of theme as long as the game has great code.

[42:03] Also, a quick thought on tight shots.

[42:05] I am personally a fan of easier shots

[42:07] so beginner players can get into it,

[42:08] but add another level of difficulty with combos

[42:12] or multipliers to give good players more depth to work with.

[42:15] I think a game like Stern Star Trek

[42:16] finds a great balance of easy shots with enough meat

[42:20] to chew on for repeated plays.

[42:22] Anyways, I just got into your podcast

[42:23] and I've been enjoying it so far, cheers Jeff.

[42:25] Well, Jeff, Jeff Dill, thank you.

[42:27] Thank you for the email, the Vota confidence on October Fest.

[42:31] Here's the thing.

[42:32] Nobody has done this.

[42:34] All, 1200 of you who listen to this show,

[42:37] nobody has gone on to Pinside and started the thread

[42:41] that I asked, which leads me to believe

[42:42] I have absolutely zero influence in this hobby.

[42:45] Will somebody please put up the thread?

[42:47] Which would you rather buy?

[42:49] October Fest or Big Trouble in Little China?

[42:52] Let's start there.

[42:53] I asked Ryan C over a head-to-head Pinnmell podcast.

[42:56] That's not even, I just did like an Australian accent

[42:58] where I sounded Irish.

[43:00] I asked Ryan to do it and he wouldn't do it.

[43:02] Ryan, I'm calling you out on this show.

[43:04] You're such a wimp.

[43:05] You know I don't have a Pinside account.

[43:07] Why wouldn't you do it?

[43:08] I think Ryan doesn't want to do it

[43:09] because he's afraid that he knows that

[43:10] Canada asked him to do it.

[43:11] And if he does it, it makes it look like he bowed down

[43:15] to the wishes of a competitive podcast.

[43:17] But we're not competitors, bro.

[43:19] Just put it up, put it up.

[43:20] Somebody put it up there.

[43:22] All right, whoever uploads that thread,

[43:26] I will send you a special

[43:27] Canadian Pinnball podcast t-shirt.

[43:29] How about that?

[43:30] All right, I'm gonna have to start

[43:31] by depriving you guys.

[43:32] But let me get back to the email here.

[43:34] I still think October fest is a piss poor theme.

[43:37] If again, I'll go on the record.

[43:38] Whoever makes this Pinnmell machine

[43:39] is gonna go out of business.

[43:40] It's Canada versus October fest.

[43:42] I don't wanna see it.

[43:43] I don't wanna see it.

[43:44] I don't think it's a good Pinnball theme.

[43:46] I think an original IP theme based on beer drinking.

[43:50] Come on.

[43:51] Is that the most original we can get?

[43:53] Is that the most original we can get?

[43:55] It wouldn't sell.

[43:56] It would not sell.

[43:58] All right.

[43:59] Just because I go into a bar doesn't mean

[44:01] I want a Pinnball machine about bars.

[44:04] It's just not what the crowd wants.

[44:08] Also, when you're in a bar playing Pinnball,

[44:10] you can't even hear anything.

[44:12] I think to me, it's better to have a theme

[44:14] where you already know what's going on.

[44:16] Like, oh look, I gotta shoot the tie fighter on a spring.

[44:18] I get that.

[44:19] All right, guys, this has been episode

[44:21] 204 of Canadian Pinnball podcast.

[44:24] Thank you.

[44:25] Keep the listener feedback coming.

[44:26] I might get too many where I can't read one.

[44:29] All them every episode, but I will get to it.

[44:32] I want to say in closing this.

[44:34] I want to say in closing this.

[44:36] There is no bad blood between this podcast.

[44:39] I'm not revengeful.

[44:41] I'm not spiteful.

[44:42] I'm not on a mission to create a nightmare scenario

[44:44] for deep root Pinnball or anyone over there.

[44:47] All I want to do is see people live up to their word.

[44:51] And if you have something exciting brewing

[44:53] in your Pinnball company, by all means, God bless you.

[44:56] Go do it.

[44:57] No one's stopping you.

[44:59] It's your money, your company, your team.

[45:01] You can go do whatever you want.

[45:03] But I'll say that the rabbit hole, the rabbit hole,

[45:06] and the pain that John caused is hobby.

[45:08] It doesn't just go away.

[45:10] It doesn't just disappear.

[45:12] It doesn't just, you don't just get to erase it overnight.

[45:18] And I think that sometimes, Robert sees the world

[45:21] through the lens of John Moore

[45:22] than he does through the lens of people who got burned.

[45:24] Because as much as Robert says, like I've talked to

[45:27] Zidware owners behind the scenes and they're all gung ho,

[45:30] I would also say that I've talked to Zidware owners

[45:33] that don't feel that way, that don't feel

[45:35] like they want to give up their lawsuit.

[45:37] In fact, I'm hearing the lawsuit by the plaintiffs

[45:40] is coming towards the finish line

[45:43] and it's looking very good for the plaintiffs.

[45:45] So we'll see how this all pans out.

[45:48] But in the end, it just doesn't feel very fun.

[45:50] I don't think the way they're positioning the company

[45:52] is positive.

[45:54] I don't think they're winning people over.

[45:56] And again, if I could just give them some advice,

[45:58] it's that less is more.

[46:00] It you've said enough already.

[46:01] It's time to now go away and return to us

[46:06] with the results of all of these promises.

[46:10] And when you do this podcast and others like it,

[46:13] we'll happily be very fair and we will congratulate you

[46:17] if you are able to do the things you say you are going to do.

[46:21] There is nothing personal, Robert.

[46:22] Like, again, like, I don't know you.

[46:25] You don't know me.

[46:26] But we don't need to name call.

[46:29] Like, you don't need to say that this podcast

[46:32] isn't a legitimate pinside or sorry, pinball media channel.

[46:36] It is.

[46:37] There's a reason why we get all these listeners, Robert.

[46:40] It's not because I have a megaphone.

[46:44] If I was saying stuff people didn't agree with,

[46:46] people wouldn't listen.

[46:48] So your main audience in the pinball hobby is this one.

[46:53] So again, when you're ready,

[46:55] let's come on the show and let's talk.

[46:56] And I think we'll have a good conversation.

[46:58] But again, my advice is let's wait till you're ready.

[47:01] Everyone out there have a great week.

[47:03] We'll be back with more pinball-related conversation real soon.

[47:07] Hey, look at this guy, I'm a geek.

[47:09] I'm a geek.

[47:10] I'm a geek.

[47:11] I'm a geek.

[47:13] I'm a geek.

[47:15] I'm a geek.

[47:16] I'm a geek.

[47:16] I'm a geek.

[47:17] I'm a geek.

[47:18] I'm a geek.

[47:19] I'm a geek.

[47:20] I'm a geek.

[47:21] I'm a geek.

[47:22] I'm a geek.

[47:23] I'm a geek.
