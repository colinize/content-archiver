[00:00] You can blame me

[00:04] Try to shame me

[00:07] And still I'll care for you

[00:16] You can run around

[00:19] Even hurt me down

[00:22] Still I'll be there for you

[00:30] You know there's a lot more going on in pinball than just magic girl

[00:39] And this podcast and the reason why I chose that intro song is

[00:44] I love doing this podcast

[00:46] I love talking to you guys about what's going on in the pinball world

[00:51] And it's easy to get fixated on one topic and stay there and battle back and forth

[00:58] So on this episode I want to talk about some other things but I'll also talk about magic girl

[01:03] Talk about what's been going on with the machine over the last 48 hours

[01:07] But I want to start by talking about a milestone moment for for highway pinball

[01:12] And that is alien pinball number one has landed

[01:15] It was on location

[01:17] I think it was in Pittsburgh

[01:18] And I was watching some twitch video of the game itself

[01:21] So let's just all just like step out of magic girl for a minute and just

[01:27] Step into another piece of pinball news because I think it's healthy for people not to get so

[01:33] Just down and dirty in the weeds on one topic and one topic only so

[01:39] What did I think of alien? I didn't I didn't watch too much of it my early assessment of the game is very simple

[01:46] It's that I think the light show is great

[01:48] The mode integration seems really well done

[01:52] I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more call outs from the actors in the film now we heard from

[01:58] The sound engineer that a lot of those are coming and there's many in the game

[02:02] So I look forward to seeing that

[02:05] There was one thing though there was one thing that I really was looking for on alien pinball game number one

[02:12] And this is this is an interesting thing right so I think the question that a lot of you have who are in on alien

[02:19] Is like when am I gonna get my alien and I bet the folks over at highway are kind of happy that this magic girl distraction has happened because like the

[02:28] Spotlight has moved away from them and is on something else and every week sort of people wait counts and

[02:37] I think the only question I have is this has

[02:41] Production of alien pinball began and are these games

[02:45] Prototype beta testing games are or are these games?

[02:51] The actual production machines now. I think the answer is clearly the that these are prototype and beta games and that's fine

[02:59] That's fine Jersey Jack puts proto beta games out on location like dialed in is out on location in an arcade right now

[03:06] months before

[03:08] The production and the assembly line really begins and you know how you can tell that this is not alien pinball number one

[03:15] That is going into consumer hands for like as the final product will be it's real simple

[03:21] You just have to look for one thing one little clue will tell you that this is not a final production version of alien pinball

[03:32] Can you guess what that is?

[03:34] Can you guess what he's told us will be on the final production version?

[03:39] Alright if you haven't guessed it I'll tell you it is the plastic underneath the flippers is still the color white

[03:46] And we know that that will be black on the final version of alien so these are beta test units now

[03:53] I don't think that's a bad thing. I know Andrew has to get them out there

[03:56] But I you know I do I do think people are waiting to see when final production will begin and I'm turning a new leaf here

[04:04] I'm turning a new leaf I'm not I'm not going to be like attacking them for doing this

[04:10] I think that if these are beta and prototype units they should just say that

[04:14] I

[04:16] Don't think these are this is like game number one that's going into like customer hands and is like the final final version of the game

[04:23] And that's fine, you know

[04:25] I do think that they were showing that oh it's shipping now so like pay up because it's on the line

[04:31] I don't think it's on the line yet, but look at the end of the day as I said before

[04:38] People just need to be patient. I you know, I don't think the

[04:42] The early owners will probably be getting machines in March. I hope they do

[04:47] But I think the weight could be a few more months a few more months

[04:51] But look as we all see on pin-side these days

[04:54] There's plenty of other things to distract us right now

[04:58] From alien pinball. Let's talk about the and I hate telling this you know

[05:04] It's like it sucks when the news doesn't even become about pinball becomes about

[05:08] People and drama and I put up that little special edition earlier today, but let's talk about

[05:16] Let's talk about magic or a little bit so I want to clarify something I figured out on my own and I also want to apologize

[05:24] I want to apologize to apple juice for for being a little strident in short with him when it came to

[05:32] figuring out the credit

[05:34] System of the game right as I told you guys magic girl is not on it's it won't let me

[05:40] Play free play it says insert coin and so I was so frustrated because like for the first like two days

[05:47] It was on free play and I didn't know what happened

[05:50] And I figured out the problem. It's the weirdest thing ever so here's the deal with how John has magic girl code it

[05:59] So here and I think it's like the ultimate sort of

[06:04] indication of how he approached this whole thing so

[06:09] Magic girl the warranty and it says specifically that magic girl is only covered under warranty as a home use only machine

[06:17] So you can't route a magic girl. It's not meant to be routed

[06:22] Okay, so that means you're never gonna you're never gonna see one out in public accepting quarters or or it avoids the warranty

[06:30] Okay, so that being the case what I figured out the problem was is that magic girl

[06:36] Doesn't accept free play it only accepts quarters so the reason why my machine all of a sudden was not accepting quarters

[06:45] No, sorry, it wasn't accepting like free play starts was that I was out of credits that John when he was over at American pinball

[06:53] Must have loaded up the game with like like 20 credits or 30 credits and I must have burned through all those

[07:01] And so what I did was I put a quarter in like I put like eight quarters and got eight credits

[07:06] started a game

[07:08] Let it drain shut the machine off turn the machine back on and it's still

[07:14] Recognized the old credits that I'd put in so when you turn the game on and off it doesn't even reset the credits

[07:20] So I just I don't I just found that like really funny. It's just another like

[07:27] nonsensical

[07:28] Approach to this machine where that doesn't make sense like if it's home use only

[07:33] And then you don't allow free play

[07:37] Unbelievable unbelievable irony continues to follow this game

[07:40] I want to say thank you to apple juice off because he seems to be

[07:45] Helping the owners understand the code and what's it and how things should work

[07:50] I didn't have a chance to test any of the stuff that he said

[07:55] Because of Brenda had a happy hour with her company tonight and so I was working hard. I came home from work and

[08:02] I literally was just playing sort of a

[08:06] Museum security guard around the magic girl

[08:09] All these people from her company were over and I told her is like look we've got to send a message out to the company like

[08:18] You got to just you can't play the machine. I mean I

[08:21] Maybe you guys think that silly, but there was just no way I was gonna let complete strangers jump on a magic girl

[08:27] And start just like flannel and away on it. I'm sorry. It's like handing the keys to

[08:33] Museum quality car and just letting like your neighbor and your friends just like take it for a spin

[08:38] It's it's it's too new. It's too new the newness will wear off and I will I will allow more and more people to jump on it

[08:45] speaking of people like wanting to jump on it

[08:49] Crazy levy crazy levy. I know he's out there. No, he listens and

[08:54] Levy I'm sorry that I haven't been calling you to jump on magic girl. I've been busy. I've been busy

[09:02] And I know I know you're really anxious to get on it

[09:06] But I have to say this and I have to call

[09:09] Levy out a little bit in the sense that like he keeps telling me stuff like

[09:13] You need a pro player to jump on it. We've you've got to scoop jack danger

[09:17] I want to jack danger plays it. No one's gonna care about you or you know

[09:21] You're gonna lose your like your investment in this and I'm just like

[09:26] I'm just tired. I'm guys. I'm tired like if you want to be my friend be my friend

[09:32] if you want to like

[09:34] Be nice to me one day and then troll me on

[09:37] Pinsider say things that are just like

[09:40] Mean to me like I read stuff like I don't get it like I read the comments and I'm just like

[09:45] Well now you're just being like a jerk and now you want to come into my home and

[09:50] I just you know, it's not it's just not funny. I think

[09:54] Today's actions and everything that's been going on lately. It's just it's just it's just not funny anymore

[10:02] You know, it's I'll say this. I don't think that an experienced players review of magic girl matters at all

[10:10] Like I don't I don't care what these guys who play pinball every day on league night and play every weekend and travel

[10:19] the country to score points um, I don't care

[10:24] I really like you are the last person

[10:28] Who's opinion about magic girl matters to anyone who buys a magic girl

[10:33] There is nothing

[10:34] About an experienced players assessment in the game

[10:38] That will change anyone's opinion of this machine. I've said it and I'll say it again

[10:44] Magic girl isn't complete

[10:46] all the mechanisms don't work

[10:49] Some of the shot geometry is wonky and will always be that way

[10:54] um, but those flaws and those and the and the mechs and the center thing with like three layers of play fields and magnets and all these things

[11:04] all that simply adds to the

[11:07] Mystique of the game. It's like you're looking at John poppadook's greatest

[11:12] Creation and failure at the same time and it's it's a it's a collectible piece of pinball history

[11:19] It's not like oh, you know tournament player come jump on and and really explore the depths of this game and really like

[11:27] Like you know tell us like what your professional opinion is and

[11:32] It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what you say because you know what I also knew what happened is

[11:37] You let these guys over and they bang on it

[11:40] Uh, and then they then they're just gonna go say what a piece of shit if it is and they never would have spent the money on it

[11:45] And I already knew they were gonna say that before they even played it like nothing that these guys would experience

[11:51] Would ever have them say anything positive about it and I'll tell you why because the tournament players

[11:58] all the things that they care about

[12:01] That those aren't things that I think most pinball people care about

[12:06] I think most pinball people are excited by the music. They're excited by the lights. They're excited by the callouts

[12:13] They're excited

[12:15] Just by seeing that world under glass and seeing that experience of flipping something that is fun

[12:22] And the more I've played magic girl the last few days the more fun and enjoyment

[12:27] I've had with it and finally figuring out how to put it in arcade mode

[12:32] What's fun about this game is like every time you plunge it

[12:36] Uh, you have no idea you have no idea like what you're about to discover

[12:41] It literally is like discovering a new land and a new country and every different like switch you hit every different sequence of stuff you hit

[12:52] You're learning something new and I love that about it. It's very rare that we get you know because this game doesn't have like

[12:59] Or a rule set that is very well known

[13:02] It doesn't have like it doesn't have the videos on YouTube of all the professional players

[13:07] You know going over the game and and I'm glad it doesn't I'm glad it doesn't

[13:12] I hope the videos that I upload it you guys were like the beginning of getting to explore the game even more

[13:18] Um, so when people say like

[13:20] Canada's not he he's not experienced enough to give us a gameplay video of magic girl

[13:25] We need to get a pro player in there and that's cool guys like you'll get that pro player video

[13:30] It's just not going to be for me

[13:32] I'm going to give you my

[13:35] Assessment of the game because it's my game

[13:38] Um, and another reason why I and not just letting like anyone come over and start flipping and recording and playing it

[13:47] Um is is I don't want to I I don't want to you know it is

[13:53] I'll say this there have been a lot of people in the New York City area that I've invited to come over and have beers and play my games

[14:01] Let me tell you none of them

[14:03] Accepted my invite when it was Lord of the Rings none of them accepted my invite when it it was Tales of the Rebian Knights

[14:10] And now all of a sudden they all want to come over and it's and it's like

[14:15] And if I don't respond to them within a day or two

[14:18] I'm getting insulted and I'm and I'm and my my like 15 minutes of fame on this game are gonna be up because Jack danger flips it

[14:26] I mean, it's just like silly caddy stuff like this

[14:30] I've always said from the very beginning my reasons for wanting a magic girl

[14:34] And I and I have the machine and it's living up

[14:38] To the expectations I've had of it and it's I'm telling you guys right now

[14:42] It's far exceeding my expectations when Chris from coin taker called me up and said the game didn't work

[14:48] The game was a dud the game did nothing nothing works the game's a mess

[14:52] I would I panicked I panicked and what I've experienced with the game since then has been anything since

[14:59] And yes, you can't compare this game to anything else out there

[15:03] It does it's not it's like an experience

[15:06] Like no other because it is a game with a story like no other and

[15:11] And you have to look at it differently and tournament players don't they're not gonna look at it differently because they don't care about that

[15:18] Those intangible things that make it a rewarding experience

[15:23] um, and so you know, I I'm just gonna say if if you guys want to go find

[15:29] A magic girl machine to go

[15:31] Make your professional assessment of the machine go find one. It's it's not gonna be mine

[15:37] It's not gonna be mine and I doubt there's gonna be many magic girl owners out there that that um

[15:43] You know want to let people bang on the machine for a really long time some will and it's not me holding back from you guys

[15:51] I will continue to share stuff. I want to take photos of what's underneath the playfield

[15:56] But I'm not gonna deconstruct the machine. I'm not gonna like start pulling apart the PC and show everything and every internal

[16:03] I just don't want to I don't want to I thought the videos I shared were were a great first introduction

[16:11] To the game and again, I've just had it for a few days like I'm still busy at work like it's it's not like

[16:17] My job is to report everything I know about magic girl

[16:21] And you know, it's also I have to be honest. I'm not really

[16:26] It's you know when I read like the penside moderators saying

[16:30] That they came from Voldemort or whatever. What's the evil guy and Harry Potter like this is where the information is coming from

[16:36] You know, whatever like just keep insulting me keep insulting me keep insulting me and then keep asking for me to share and do things for you

[16:44] um, you know like I I don't care if they say that I'm like in this evil person um, but

[16:51] You know I

[16:53] Really I do love the pen. I love the pen and I think people who get it are gonna are gonna love the pen

[17:00] now I hope everyone who um

[17:03] Who is uh expecting a magic girl gets it soon and I hope I hope people can just like move past this machine soon

[17:11] Um, I do think the machine has brought out some of the worst behavior in people which has led

[17:17] To the other news item tonight which is the purge of penside

[17:22] And I don't know if all of you guys saw this but apparently

[17:27] A robin is has decided to finally take action against

[17:33] A lot of the different trolling behavior that has I believe and I think many of you will believe

[17:39] Is really ruining the site it it's it's a site that I read on a daily basis. It's it's a site that many of you read on a daily basis and

[17:48] It is probably reached the peak of negativity

[17:52] the peak of negativity and

[17:55] You know, I used to be the poster child for the negativity on penside right it was me

[18:00] I was I was always the one to blame it was like get rid of canada. He's toxic. They still say it. He's toxic. I was toxic

[18:07] Um, I've been banned for over a year

[18:10] for over a year and

[18:13] Has the site become better since I've been gone or people treating each other with more respects since I've been gone?

[18:21] The answer is no and and so why is that?

[18:25] And who's the blame and and and and what what where can it go from here?

[18:30] I think everybody

[18:32] You know needs to just collectively take some responsibility

[18:36] You know part of me said part of me thinks like

[18:39] On a very just like basic level. I think the moderators just stop moderating

[18:45] You know, I remember a day when you used to go into a thread

[18:49] And if you said something that was off topic or insulted someone or was derogatory towards someone

[18:56] You were threat ejected like you were banned like they at least a one day or two day like you were first slapped on the wrist

[19:02] And then you were permanently banned from that thread and that doesn't happen anymore

[19:07] That doesn't happen anymore now. They just let people fight back and forth and it you know

[19:11] It's it's I'm gonna use an analogy

[19:14] That my old boss Dan Harnett used to say and I used to love this guy. He was an ex

[19:19] Green beret like total like crazy awesome

[19:23] Super smart guy. I love the guy one of the best mentors I had and we used to talk about

[19:29] When there's issues and you know issues at work or issues with the client

[19:33] He said when you have a problem a problem is usually like it's like dripping water

[19:39] Like leaking water he say when like it just seems like a little drip at first

[19:43] But if you don't stop the little drip

[19:46] Um over time it'll collapse entire building

[19:51] And that's I think what's happened on Pinside lately is there's just been so many

[19:59] Not so many people but

[20:01] There's like this

[20:03] vocal minority that's just been allowed to

[20:07] To to to take over and they are the the leaking water

[20:12] So when robin in the staff talks about this purge that's coming

[20:16] I think it's an important thing to do

[20:20] To just help the site

[20:22] Get back and be more positive

[20:25] You know, I want to pull up the thread they had about it here Pinside staff announcement please read

[20:31] Um, and they you know they go into how Pinside used to be a fun place yada yada yada

[20:37] Um, and this is what they say

[20:39] Sometime this spring a list will be compiled by the mods of the round table

[20:45] And this list will include all the known troublemakers and

[20:48] Missgrance that soil the good name of Pinside

[20:53] So

[20:54] Okay, so like

[20:56] But what's weird is

[20:59] It's like this weird thing where they say they're going to

[21:03] Um, if you remain on the list right so they're gonna like create a list

[21:08] And if if you don't behave and you are still on that list

[21:12] Um, then you're gonna be banished from Pinside for a period not less than 30 days a purge is coming

[21:20] So

[21:21] I mean, it's just a weird thing. It's like look like we're gonna

[21:25] We're gonna give you a warning not to be a jerk and I

[21:30] I really think they should have just like

[21:32] start it off by banning people

[21:35] of media lanes and your behavior has just been too much like take a break from Pinside and

[21:40] I think it's helpful to take a break from Pinside. I really do when I took the three months off

[21:45] It was probably one of the best things I could have done

[21:48] I think most of you would agree that when I came back to Pinside

[21:53] Uh, the podcast have probably improved they've probably mellowed out. It's you know, I've calmed down

[21:59] I've tried to look at things more objectively

[22:02] And you know, it would just help sort of create like a

[22:08] Ceasing of the anger and the the vitriol that is just is just running a muck

[22:14] Um, I want to also you know, give a shout out to some people who have said some nice things to me recently and I don't tell you why because

[22:23] I as much as I do have fixed skin and I do I mean I was reading just a whole bunch of nasty stuff about me again

[22:30] And I explained earlier in my special edition podcast

[22:33] um, how we each have our own battles to fight but

[22:37] A lot of times the people who say the negative thing it's that negative thing that then gets amplified gets responded to and it's

[22:46] You know, it's sort of like the news right in our culture. It's like report something negative and be nasty

[22:51] And that will set off a chain of you know a chain reaction of of more people piling on for the negativity

[22:59] So I want to just read um some stuff that people have said to me that has just been like

[23:04] You know nice and and I and I think that it's maybe some of the stuff about me

[23:08] But this is just some of the feedback I've been getting

[23:11] Um from from different pinside users out there

[23:15] Uh, so this is from Michael

[23:18] Sabo

[23:19] Um, hey, Kay love the podcast. I can't spend all day on pinside keeping up with the drama

[23:25] So I always appreciate your summaries

[23:27] Congrats on getting your magic girl. I agree that Jay pops games are an experience like no other post a score on pin dingo

[23:36] uh

[23:37] You'd be the first and it's his app project about pinball scores

[23:40] Well, Michael, I want to thank you so much for being a listener of canada's pinball podcast

[23:46] Uh, spitfire 1500 wrote me and said I have to give it to you

[23:51] Your podcast is now the replacement for coast to coast pinball for the latest news

[23:57] It's super timely and straight to the point

[23:59] It doesn't ramble on for three hours where you might get the news somewhere in the middle of idle banter

[24:05] Coast to coast used to do that before it went to all tournament talk

[24:10] And when you aren't doing news you have fun interviews with pinballers of stories past winning on both fronts

[24:16] With that magic girl at your place you now have the prototype iPhone left at the bar

[24:22] Even pinciders are setting aside. There are differences with you

[24:25] wanting to give you the exclusive barber Walters interview with the controversial machine and they like

[24:31] Bubba well spitfire 1500. Thank you

[24:34] Um, you know, I I am not I did not buy this machine to have something to hold over

[24:40] Pinside and to make people think differently about me

[24:43] Um, I've always wanted a magic girl since I first heard about it

[24:47] Um, and I'm glad people like Bubba because I like Bubba a whole lot better than I like magic girl

[24:54] And I like Brenda a whole lot better

[24:57] Uh, well, maybe a little bit better than Bubba

[25:00] Bubba is just so amazing. He's snoring right now

[25:02] Um, and I used to love coast to coast pinball as well, and I still

[25:06] Consider Nate shivers to be the whole reason why you're listening to me right now

[25:11] And I feel honored that people would compare my show to Nate

[25:14] I mean, that is the ultimate flattery for this show that someone would make a comment like that

[25:19] I remember when I first got into pinball and was on pinside again back in the the housey and days of old right guys

[25:26] It feels like years ago and when things were just a lot more positive

[25:30] Uh, you know before the error went to take pinball ruined all of our lives and stole all of our money

[25:36] Nate I used to put Nate's podcast podcast on every night whenever it was on and I used to love

[25:42] Uh, whenever I saw there was a new one

[25:44] So I'm assuming this I'm gonna make this assumption, but I think a lot of you out there do get happy when you see

[25:50] Oh, look, there's another canadus pinball podcast

[25:53] Knowing that you guys get a thrill

[25:55] When you see that

[25:57] Makes makes what I do

[26:00] So much more enjoyable and it's the reason why I do it

[26:03] I was having a long conversation with Brennan tonight about this podcast mainly thanking her for supporting me through all this like she saw how

[26:12] How down and out I got and and how bad of a person I became

[26:17] When I was attacking oric when I was attacking Andrew highway when I was on these like negative crusades and I was like

[26:24] this vindictive

[26:26] Sort of mean person and and she just wanted me to get out of it and I took the break

[26:32] and and she's really happy

[26:34] the difference

[26:36] That the podcast has become she's happy the difference she sees in me and and that that means so much and I hope you guys also like to feel that way as you

[26:46] As you listen to this podcast moving forward all right, I'm trying to think what else Nelson rhyme Nelson writes Chris

[26:54] I'm in the city for work on Monday

[26:57] Any chance of seeing magic girl. I would appreciate the opportunity to see the crib and meet Bubba and that was two days ago

[27:04] So Nelson let me I have to see if I'll be around but I think I there might be a good chance of that

[27:09] He writes congrats on the acquisition a piece of pure pinball history listen to your podcast today on your unboxing a mix bag to be sure

[27:19] Or douchebag considering we're talking Jay pop

[27:23] Glad you're doing the podcast again, too. It was a dry summer if you don't recall I was at Alan town and you

[27:29] Ted a friend on my of mine and myself played some pins and had lunch

[27:35] Nelson thank you. Um, I do remember I remember Alan town

[27:39] I remember the small group we were hanging around with

[27:42] Um, and I do really appreciate the note and if I am around

[27:47] Monday, I would love to have you come over the only thing is I work

[27:50] So it would have to be after work to come see the game

[27:53] Um, so I will reach out to you separately to see if we can arrange something

[27:59] All right, let's see who else has reached out to canada

[28:02] Uh, let's see Craig Roger Craig. Thank you for listening to canada's pinball podcast

[28:07] I appreciate you reaching out he wrote Chris

[28:10] Even though you were a complete knob to me on pinside a while ago when I criticized alien

[28:16] I'm writing to you today to say thanks for doing the magic girl videos on YouTube

[28:21] Although I would have never bought a magic girl like Batman Slyly no pinball is worth 16k to me

[28:27] It's interesting to see how it turned out

[28:29] I would have thought after all that time where j-jump pop-a-duke was designing it that it would be well and truly finished and all working

[28:38] Maybe as someone said recently that jump pop-a-duke just wanted to get them out to satisfy the court etc

[28:44] I don't know

[28:46] One thing though proplexes me the LCD being blocked that is a big mistake and one that jump pop-a-duke would have known for

[28:55] From the early days

[28:56] Anyway, hopefully those issues can be sorted out in the future. So it reflects its high price good luck with it

[29:03] Craig thank you. I appreciate the note um

[29:07] Yeah, the LCD screen is just like that the weirdest thing it it it blocks so much of it like so much

[29:14] So like the bottom two-thirds of the screen are almost like impossible to read and at the bottom like quarter

[29:23] You can't read anything and there are like modes when you start the modes

[29:27] Where you're you can't see it you can't see like and and you need to see this stuff

[29:32] It's just this weird thing that john just like

[29:35] It's these common sensical errors in the game that again it it it sucks from a

[29:42] From a player standpoint, but again, it just adds more intrigue and I think value to the story because it's like

[29:52] This guy

[29:53] Got so carried away that he built this mountain mechanism to cover his beautiful display and he made the cabinet deeper

[30:03] To be able to accommodate the screen and even though he dug deeper right he

[30:10] He raised up that mechanism

[30:12] taller and and that's that's jpop like in a nutshell right he

[30:18] He took one step forward to take two steps back on everything he did

[30:23] And and when I started the arcade mode like yeah, there's stuff going on

[30:26] But you can't you can't read it

[30:29] Of the stuff looks really cool the animations not animations, but the imagery is really awesome

[30:35] I'll say this though my favorite part of magic girls so far is the music

[30:39] It sounds like a Danny Elfman soundtrack like Edward Cesarhan's kind of magical

[30:45] It's it's just this aura that fills the air around the machine and that's like my favorite part

[30:50] Just that and then the lights show alone

[30:53] Make it super special, but Craig thank you for listening to canators pinball podcasts

[30:58] Uh good old Kevin sandborn of a friend of canators for a long time. He just wrote amazing how in their head you are

[31:07] um

[31:08] Well Kevin

[31:10] I you know sometimes I am amazed that like people just

[31:14] constantly complain about

[31:16] They say I'm an attention-seeking horror all the time and then they give me the attention

[31:21] So it's kind of not fair like I didn't I didn't do anything to get

[31:27] Pinsides attention

[31:30] But I had stuff that people were

[31:33] People like it that had people's attention like people want to see magic girl hear about magic girl

[31:39] um, they don't they don't want to just hear about canada like I don't talk about myself

[31:44] I talk about my experience in the context of pinball right this isn't like

[31:48] Canada's podcast where Chris tells you what he had for breakfast um

[31:52] so

[31:53] You know, I think the only reason why people can't let me go is that

[31:59] As much as people want to label me as this troll that was toxic that was horrible for pinball

[32:05] I think it's now reached the point where it's sort of uh

[32:09] You know that sort of doesn't feel like the the conclusion a lot of people are making

[32:13] I think people do enjoy this podcast

[32:16] I think they do enjoy the time effort and commentary that I bring to the pinball hobby

[32:21] And if they don't that's cool like everyone's free to listen right no one has a gun to your head and makes you download this podcast

[32:28] And so you know the option is there and I say this if I sucked and added no value

[32:35] Then why do hundreds of people listen to me and and I think that's like a decent percentage of

[32:41] actual people in the world who are are hyper

[32:45] Connected to pinball on a daily basis. So I thank you guys for listening

[32:50] um, I got a nice note from Lou our friend in France

[32:55] Uh, is he in France? I don't know. I just said that. I don't oh man

[32:58] He might kill me if he's not from France. Um, Louis

[33:00] France, I think it's named like France. I'm gonna butcher your name again, Lou

[33:04] But he said Chris the game is incredible. I'm jealous people are crying about no code

[33:10] I paid

[33:11] I won't tell you how much you paid you paid a lot for a cactus canyon with no end no real modes nothing really good

[33:17] But it's a story. It's the last Williams

[33:20] I think before pin 2k

[33:22] It's a game that sucks without the continued add-on with this add-on wow one of the best games of its

[33:28] Error

[33:29] Contact apple juice on pinside

[33:31] um, he's he's best friend if you need to ship him a game go take a week in Europe with Brenda while he works on a twenty for seven

[33:38] Okay, so I think no one has to ship apple juice a game. I know that the game there's another game going to the UK

[33:44] And those guys are gonna connect so that's great

[33:46] I think it's really lucky that one magic girl is ending up in the UK for that to happen

[33:50] But Lou I thank you so much. You've been a great supporter of the show and

[33:56] You know, I really appreciate the guys that also send me emails frequently because again, it means a lot

[34:01] It's it's you know, I read all this negative stuff about me and it's you know, it's you know, it's funny is like you can go on pinside and say

[34:12] special case and idiot

[34:15] Dow who shall not be named valdemort

[34:19] You know k with you know lines underneath it and then just insult me

[34:23] You can do it all day long and they let you do it

[34:26] But if you went on the pinside and said I listen to canators pinball podcasts and I really enjoy it

[34:32] They won't let you say that

[34:34] They won't let you say that and I don't know. I just part of me just thinks it's such like an un-American and un

[34:41] Not even like American like just anywhere where freedom is respected if you can't freely say something positive

[34:49] About someone who's doing something positive

[34:53] I don't I think it's starting to make the pinside

[34:56] Moderators and Robin look bad and I and like I sent Robin in note today

[35:02] I sent Robin in note and I think it was like subject line like time to forgive like look

[35:06] I was like Robin like I'm sorry like and I said this earlier today in my other podcast

[35:10] Um, I think it's time to bury the hatchet and I said I'm not looking to go on pinside

[35:15] I'm just looking to grab a beer with you at tpf and talk

[35:18] He didn't get back to me um, he didn't get back to me and any look maybe he's gonna hold the grudge and I said some horrible things to him but

[35:25] You know he go ask iceman like you can have it out with me and we could go back and forth and and wage war against each other

[35:32] And then five minutes later we burrow the hatchet and we move on because we realized we're both being like idiots

[35:37] And it's just pinball and we're we're grown adults and it's not the end of the world

[35:42] um, I got a letter from Shannon

[35:45] um, I'm not gonna

[35:47] But you're last name Shannon B. Hey Chris great podcast and appreciate the guests and insights recently around magic girl

[35:54] I want to drop you a line of encouragement so you don't derail again and let pinside get you to wound up

[36:00] The best anyone can ever do is admit to make peace with their mistakes and move forward

[36:05] Keep up the good work and energy around pinball where did totain go?

[36:10] So thank you Shannon for that note and I appreciate it because I think in the past

[36:14] I would have read all these people slamming me and I would have put up a podcast

[36:18] That would have been like eff you and eff you and eff you

[36:21] And what is that ever?

[36:23] Accomplish it just gets you nowhere and again like I'm gonna call out companies when they do stuff on

[36:29] I this will always be the podcast that will ask those hard questions and keep people accountable

[36:35] You know and but it's not gonna be the podcast anymore where

[36:39] You know we fly off the handle like like lunatics like I'm not that that doesn't mean

[36:43] There's not gonna be another pinside babies when people start acting ridiculous

[36:47] Because I always did feel like my role like really the real reason I got banned

[36:54] If you really go back it is simply because I trolled the trolls

[37:01] I trolled the trolls like I'm like that catfish at the bottom of a fish tank that eats up all the bacteria like

[37:08] That's what I was really good at the problem is the real

[37:12] trolls the guys who have ruined the pinside over the last year

[37:17] They

[37:19] Are the ones who emailed the moderators all the time

[37:23] Begging them to kick me off and they got their way and it's cool and and so but instead of going away

[37:28] I decided to turn lemon into lemonade and make this podcast and I and I think for most of those guys

[37:35] Who thought that I was a charlatan who thought I didn't like pinball?

[37:39] They thought I would just go away right once you're banned from a form you no longer have a voice

[37:43] You no longer have any influence like you no longer matter

[37:47] And I think I've successfully shown that that's not the case and in life

[37:52] You might succeed in one environment and fail in another and I failed on pinside

[37:58] I failed I you know I go back and I see like stuff

[38:01] I would write and I'm like what why would you do that Chris like why would you go into the hobbit thread and just be a jerk

[38:08] To everyone who bought a hobbit like that behavior that stuff that I did was stupid like it's absolutely stupid now that I look back on it

[38:17] There's a way to more objectively talk about things

[38:20] There's a way to like even criticize things and criticize people

[38:24] In a way that isn't so stride in and so obnoxious so

[38:29] You know, I definitely

[38:32] Don't want to let those people who insult me

[38:35] Caused me to overreact I also I don't want it I was telling us to burn it tonight

[38:40] I don't want to take away this podcast because then those people win

[38:45] Then the guy is like wise snow and in the other vocal minority the guys who just can't stand me

[38:51] They win and let's be honest the main reason that Hilton is probably leading this mob to

[38:58] To to prevent magic girls from going out is is only because he found out I was getting one

[39:04] Where was he

[39:06] Months ago where was he when American pinball first showed images of

[39:10] Magic girl was he was he adamant about stopping the release of them and seizing the assets and all that

[39:18] Go back look at the dates. He said nothing

[39:21] He only was turned on when he found out that I got one and I know for a fact that he used to send lengthy emails to the moderators

[39:31] Complaining about my presence and and Hilton it's cool man like you pinball is something you're really passionate about

[39:38] Um, and I know it burns you to know in that there's a magic girl in

[39:43] Canada's house and the first magic girl in the world is here

[39:48] That people are have access to

[39:50] um, you know because part of me is just kind of laughing because it's like why don't you go tell us again how full throttle

[39:56] The greatest machine ever made and you've never experienced a bill quality like it, you know, it's I

[40:01] Think it's a little bit of karma bro karma like you you didn't win you weren't successful in in silencing me um

[40:10] And you know and and what the point I was making is I don't want to let that vocal minority ruin this podcast for a lot of you guys

[40:18] Because what I hear from many of you out there is you love this podcast and you love listening to it on your way to work

[40:24] You love listening to it while you're like moan the lawn

[40:28] And you love the frequency of it

[40:30] You know another thing when I first started this podcast

[40:33] I used to get all sorts of advice from people all everyone knew how to do this podcast better than I did

[40:39] Are you people used to tell me? I don't like the fact that you don't um, you don't just release it on specific dates

[40:46] Like you should only release it on a Monday and Friday and that's it like it should be scheduled and my response to that was

[40:53] I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that

[40:55] I want to record a podcast when I feel like it like when I actually feel like

[41:00] Doing one I'll do one and when I don't I won't the last thing I ever want to do is feel like I have to get a podcast up because it's Monday

[41:10] Or I have to get a podcast up because it's Friday

[41:13] Like tonight I was Brennan. I were talking for a good hour and a half about just life and and and our plans for the future

[41:21] And then I fall I caught up on Pinside and and she's amazing I walked into the bedroom and it's like guys

[41:26] It's like 11 30 and and I'm like hey babe. I just really want to put a podcast up and I want to I want to talk to the audience out there and

[41:34] And she's like cool like it's great and and that's what I love

[41:39] You know, I once had a someone a listener of the show. I still have to have them on

[41:43] um, but he said you know, I think your shows are better when you're talking to someone and and you should have a co-host with you and

[41:52] You know, it's called Canadian's pinball podcast. It's called the Howard Stern show, right? I mean, it's called the you know

[41:57] brushlin ball whatever, you know

[41:59] I think this show works because I don't have a co-host because I'll tell you why not because I don't think pizza great guy

[42:06] Or I don't think other people out there can add great value

[42:10] But it's all about I can't share with you when I want to do this if I have a co-host

[42:16] I think those other shows out there that other pinball podcasts

[42:20] What prevents them probably from doing it more frequently is then you have to work around two people's schedules

[42:26] God forbid you throw in a third person because they want to interview someone every show

[42:31] And then you're like then you're limited to how quickly you can get them up

[42:35] So Canadian's pinball podcast will never do that. I will never have like a permanent co-host

[42:41] But we will have frequent guests of the show and I love doing interviews

[42:44] I love doing interviews. I hope you guys really enjoy the interview with Matt Andrews last night

[42:48] I thought that was like a terrific interview where we shared some news

[42:52] I heard from a lot of you guys made me so happy to hear

[42:55] That you never have heard of him before

[42:57] I think zombie Yeti people saw him as the only artist that created John's games

[43:03] But no like there is another very talented artist that I think deserves a spotlight and deserves to work more in pinball

[43:10] And you know, I really hope that one of these pinball manufacturers picks him up and I'm gonna work hard

[43:16] To try and facilitate that from happening

[43:20] So you know, it's it's it's it's it's why I love doing it, you know, it's always gonna be that way

[43:26] Um, let me see I'm gonna go to Facebook now too because a lot of you guys like hit me up on Facebook and

[43:32] And and tell me that you know you're found this show the only issue with Facebook is the second I go on there

[43:37] You know people start chatting right away and then at that beeping noise like interrupts the podcast but

[43:43] Let me read some recent stuff that people have written on pinside so Chris

[43:51] Let's see

[43:54] The mission sorry guys look at this. This is like where editing comes in but I'm too tired to edit this you're just gonna get it like it is

[44:02] Scott

[44:04] Denese Scott said Chris just watch the videos. You're a good dude Chris. Thanks for the vids

[44:11] Also, I wanted to let you know that I will be bringing total annihilation to tpf this year

[44:16] And we'd love to see what you think of it. So make sure to find me there

[44:21] ps I almost pissed myself with a special k box opening

[44:25] Scott thank you and thanks for listening and yes, I will be at tpf. I can't wait to hang

[44:31] It's um, it's gonna be a fun show. I really do. I think this is gonna be one of the best tpfs ever

[44:37] There's so much news colliding at the same time

[44:40] I also want to thank oh god, and why am I like because his name is like for it's Jonathan

[44:47] Is it juxtain Joe Nathan? I

[44:50] Pinball magazine Jonathan Jonathan. Thank you for sending me the latest edition of pinball magazine

[44:56] He asked if I would read it and give my review. I got it in the mail today. I truly appreciate it

[45:02] I love the magazine. I think it's terrific and I can't wait to read it very shortly

[45:08] So that's that's sort of like it on this edition of canada's pinball podcast

[45:12] I'm sorry guys if I've been in sort of this like reflective mode lately

[45:17] But I think the reason I've been that way is I want to get back to just covering more and more pinball news

[45:23] I don't want this to be reflective of the negativity that is permeating throughout

[45:29] the forums these days and

[45:31] And you know, I think the onus is on everybody to just like

[45:35] Be nicer be nicer, you know, and and and and just

[45:40] If you're in a throw a punch throw one punch

[45:43] You know, don't throw 80 don't throw the same punch 15 times in a row

[45:48] And if you really want to get personal with someone take it to a private message

[45:53] I'm inviting Jack on the show. You know his hand on pinside. It's like VOD

[46:00] Gee, I don't know I don't know how to say it

[46:03] He's the one who called me special Kay and I've been debating back and forth and like whether or not

[46:09] I should let someone on the show who you know calls me something to aga Torian

[46:13] You know said mean things about me doesn't really know me and it's funny because he asked me is like

[46:18] Can you send me a link to the podcast? I haven't listened to it yet. I do find it funny that people out there who haven't listened to my podcast

[46:27] um

[46:28] Have such a strong opinion about me

[46:32] And and and so they still think of me as I was when I you know, I was banned from pinside

[46:39] I think a lot's changed in a year. I think you guys can

[46:44] Can can sort of back that up. I also think it's it's you know, it's unfortunate that people haven't

[46:52] Listen to this podcast, but yet want to make

[46:55] Comments about me and and say how much they know me and I think it's hard to say I don't love pinball

[47:02] I think the amount of time and energy I put into this I could be applying to other areas of my life

[47:07] But I decided to do it for you guys and for this hobby

[47:11] For those of you who think I do it just for me is all about me me me me

[47:15] of the attention

[47:17] That is not the case

[47:18] But there is some of this innate use to say this of course

[47:22] Anyone who's gonna grab a microphone and record a podcast about pinball on some level likes to hear the sound of their own voice

[47:28] You just do I listen to all my podcasts

[47:31] I don't hit repeat and listen to him 800 times and there's only me and one other listener

[47:35] I listen to them

[47:37] Because I'd learn from each one I learn from each one

[47:41] I used to write down all my notes and questions whenever I would do an interview and I would prepare for hours and hours and hours

[47:47] When I interviewed Matt last night I didn't I didn't write down anything

[47:50] I have all the questions you know you get used to sort of carrying the dialogue and a conversation with someone

[47:56] um

[47:56] So that's it. We're gonna get back to more of our regular regularly scheduled sort of podcast

[48:03] Ben Hack is coming on the show tomorrow night

[48:06] Jack who's the pinside member that I

[48:09] mentioned recently just a few seconds ago. He's coming out. I'm talking to him. I believe Saturday

[48:14] We have a time set aside and and the final point is you know, I decided to talk to Jack even though he said

[48:20] You know called me names

[48:22] Because I have openly said

[48:25] Many times in this podcast that if you have a problem with me come on the show

[48:30] If you want to debate me or challenge me or or just talk pinball come on the show

[48:35] I I can't say those statements and then when someone wants to

[48:42] Come on the show deny them access to the show the only time the only time I've ever

[48:50] Talked to someone and then decide it not to air the conversation

[48:56] Was cornealious and I spoke to him and we didn't interview and it was you know, it just like

[49:04] It just didn't feel right and it was it was doing that dark period where I was like

[49:10] Drink it in podcasting and I was saying all these really like overly nasty things about I think it was like highway pinball

[49:17] and I was like in this attack mode and

[49:20] And he had just been like kicked off for a while or banned for like a few days

[49:26] And then all of a sudden and he was like I get how you feel and and no like

[49:32] I you know

[49:33] My podcast is not a place that just like accepts people who are

[49:38] or shunned by the community

[49:41] This is not like your your solitary confinement space where now you understand what it's like to be the black sheep of a forum

[49:50] Uh, and I just didn't like the interview and he said so many nasty things about me and he like he apologized and accepted and we we've had no beef since

[49:58] Um, but you know, it's my podcast and if if we talk and I just don't feel like it's gonna add value like I don't have to air it

[50:06] Like that's my right um, that's my right, but it it look I like I said I've only done that once and I don't see that ever happening again

[50:14] So I welcome any any and all of you who want to come on the show

[50:18] and talk and and also guys like for those of you who I said like let's chat like

[50:23] Like be persistent like some guys like hit me up and they're like where do I get a mic and I give them mics?

[50:28] Remember like I have a day job like I'm not gonna chase you down. There are certain interviews that I've been chasing down

[50:34] Um, certainly individuals like haven't come on that we're supposed to um Keith Elwin is supposed to come on the show and I

[50:42] I'm a little disappointed like he just stopped responding like he said he he would and then I um

[50:48] Hit him up on Facebook messenger a few times. I saw he was on there's little green dot there

[50:53] Uh, maybe he's busy and he just never got back to me and that's cool like I'm not like I'm not taking it personally that Keith or George Gomez like having gotten back to me

[51:03] These guys are busy working in a pinball company and you know, it's not always to their benefit to talk to a media outlet like I

[51:12] I think I would consider this to be someone of a media outlet for pinball
