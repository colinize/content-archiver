[00:00] 🎵 When you call my name, it's like a little prayer, down on my knees, I'm gonna take you there, in the big night I have, I can feel your love, just like the rep, and I'll take you there. 🎵

[00:16] 🎵 Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider, Cider 🎵

[00:20] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadi's Pinball Podcast. Happy Friday! How is everybody doing? How are all of ya Kong L.E. buyers doing?

[00:30] We're gonna talk about what's going on in the pinball world. We are at the end of another pinball week.

[00:37] We're getting closer to Harry Potter. I got some news for you on Harry Potter from someone who works in the industry.

[00:46] And has heard stuff about the game. I'm gonna share that with you. Consider it a rumor. We're all gonna see this game very soon.

[00:56] But man-o-man-o-man, what I'm hearing might make this spring into summer a very interesting time in pinball.

[01:07] And what else is going on in pinball? We got a lot of people waiting for code updates on some of these stern machines.

[01:15] We're gonna get that. They're gonna push everybody onto the new menu system. We're still waiting for Spike 3.

[01:22] The first Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has landed in America. What does that mean? I'm not really sure. The first game, it is mid-May.

[01:36] These games were supposed to be on the line in January and we're getting one game at a time. There's no way.

[01:46] We're gonna see 500 of these by the end of the year. And I don't think people care. You will wait because the alternative was waiting 12 years for a freaking big Lebowski.

[02:01] So the only thing about Alice is this. When this game gets unboxed and when you see people play it, you're not gonna see some humongous progress from what you saw on this game back in October.

[02:18] You're gonna see some polish, some new stuff added, but it's not like an entire game has woken up over the last six months.

[02:28] So I don't know. Compared to what many people are used to, I think just people want something rare. I mean it. I just feel like for these collectors, you just want something now that not everybody has.

[02:40] And that's a hard thing to come by. I think the best game right now for collectors, if you really want something that not everybody's gonna have, if you want something that's gonna always be in demand, I think the game is evil dead.

[02:57] And I think we're seeing it. There's more people that want an evil dead than evil deads will ever be made. 888. That was the smart game to get if you're a collector.

[03:10] Everything else is sitting. King Kong LE just went up for sale for, it sold for $11,900. So in $1100 loss in a week.

[03:23] Now there are still a lot of King Kong LEs for sale at Distros and Kerry Hardy just unboxed his. It was the first LE he ever got and he's underwhelmed by it.

[03:37] I could have told him that. I know he wanted to get an early game to give his first impressions.

[03:44] Dr. Frightner has some hilarious videos up on YouTube explaining all the stuff that is problematic in King Kong.

[03:53] Then I go over to Pinside and if you go into the King Kong owners club, it's a much different narrative.

[04:01] These are people that bought the game early on and when you listen or read what they say about the game, it's the greatest game ever.

[04:11] It's better than Godzilla. This is going to be the number one game and when the code matures, it's going to be one of the greatest games of all time.

[04:22] I'm here to tell you people no, it is not. There is no way an asset list King Kong game is going to be ranked the number one game of all time.

[04:38] It is not happening and I think there is early delusion by those people who paid all this money right away to get it and people have stopped responding to me.

[04:51] I have friends who bought LEs. I sent them a screen grab more than one of you.

[04:56] So don't take this personally and start texting me. How dare you call me out? I'm not mentioning any names.

[05:04] I sent it to a bunch of my friends who bought LEs and all of them are disappointed in what the game is doing in the second hand market instantly.

[05:16] And whose fault is it, right? That the game is not where it should be on launch.

[05:20] When it comes to code and I mean this, when you watch streams of King Kong and I watch the flipping out stream, there's just something not clicking.

[05:30] The game is not giving people goosebumps. It's just not. I'm not saying it's a bad shooter. It's a phenomenal shooter.

[05:38] It's got a great layout, but that's not enough to separate you from all this money.

[05:46] And I think what's about to happen next is really going to be the issue. And let's just get right down to business.

[05:54] So I am hearing from somebody about Harry Potter. Now, when you think about Harry Potter, it's coming out after we got Dune, after we got King Kong, after we got Portal.

[06:07] We didn't get Predator and who knows when Cuphead is happening, but Harry Potter sort of has been the one that everyone is waiting to see.

[06:17] So the expectations for Potter are through the roof. Everybody wants a game. And I mean this. Everybody just wants a game to come out to make us feel something magical.

[06:32] And so Harry Potter as a theme seems like the perfect game to do that.

[06:38] After all of these price increases, all we really want is something that checks all the boxes and justifies where this hobby has gone.

[06:49] That is what everybody is waiting for. Everybody knows that King Kong just feels a lot like more of the same from Stern.

[06:59] And you have to remember it's like it's a weird company. They don't give you everything in every game.

[07:04] Like why doesn't King Kong have expression lighting? Why doesn't every game have Stern's best lighting system?

[07:12] It's like you take that out to put what in? And for $13,000, there's a $3,500 difference between the Ellie and the premium.

[07:25] Even if the Ellie of King Kong came exclusively with expression lighting, that would be something much more differentiating between the Ellie and the premium.

[07:36] But no, they don't do it. And I think people are just tired of feeling like they're spending this much money.

[07:43] They're not really getting something unique enough. And that is why Kong sales across the board are very soft.

[07:52] And so now that we move over to a $15,000 Harry Potter CE, the feeling on the street is this.

[08:02] This game better bring it. Like it better be magical. No one's denying the fact that the theme is impressive.

[08:11] But if there's ever been a company that has fumbled themes before, it is Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[08:19] I think the worst fumble in the history of Pimbal was making Toy Story 4, even worse than Godfather, because you had a franchise that everybody wanted to buy.

[08:32] Toy Story is just iconic. Everybody wanted it. And you made the one movie that was like the woke fourth installment of Toy Story.

[08:43] If they had made Andy's room, Toy Story 1 only, they would have sold 8,000 of those games.

[08:52] Every single one of us would have owned that game. If it had a claw machine, if it had Zorg, if it had everything from that first movie in Pimbal form with toys like Dialed in, we would all be owning that machine.

[09:08] Instead, we got a Toy Story 4 that had no toys in the game. A little flap that pops up is not a toy. There are zero toys in Toy Story.

[09:21] And then we got Godfather, and then we got Elton John, and then we got Avatar.

[09:28] So here's what I am hearing, and this is making me nervous. I am hearing that Harry Potter is not, and I repeat, not going to have more in it than the last four installments of Jersey Jack games.

[09:48] It might have two upper playfields, or a lower playfield and an upper playfield, but in terms of toys, in terms of a game that's going to have a lot of mechanical stuff that interacts with the ball,

[10:02] I am hearing that Harry Potter is not going to be a return to games like Pirates. It's not going to be a return to a game like Wizard of Oz.

[10:15] We are going to get a game that has multiple levels of play. I think there's going to be a lot happening on the screen, but I am hearing that even a game like Doom is going to have more impressive mechanical stuff going on than Harry Potter.

[10:33] Now the question I want to pose to each and every one of you, if Harry Potter comes out and doesn't have this Harry Potter universe under glass,

[10:43] if it's not filled with a lot of fun toys and magnets and castles and candle lit stuff going on,

[10:51] if it doesn't feel loaded and it's more about flow and diverters and shots and gameplay, but not magical moments,

[11:02] I mean when you think about it, Harry Potter should have mechs in the game that should rival stuff like the Theater of Magic Magic Box.

[11:13] It should have stuff in it like the Toad in Disappearing Magnet. It should have something in it like the Houdini game that fires the ball all the way across the playfield.

[11:25] It should have something in it like the Star Wars Hyperdrive, like a game of Quidditch where you go up there and you're sort of flying around Hogwarts Castle playing a game of Quidditch.

[11:36] So will this game have that? Or will it be more like Godfather with an upper and lower playfield and maybe a couple things here or there, but not one super impressive mech?

[11:51] I'm just gonna say this, I think for $15,000 and this being the dream theme of Eric Minier, that this game should have in it stuff that is more impressive than the Pirates of the Caribbean upper playfield.

[12:09] Here's what my source told me, the reason why Jersey Jack is just never gonna go back and make games load it like waz, load it like the Hobbit, load it like Dialedon, load it like Pirates.

[12:23] The reason is not that they don't want to, it's not that they don't know how to do this stuff.

[12:29] The reason why, since Guns N' Roses, if you've lifted the playfield on Jersey Jack machines, the reason why comes down to one word, they need to manufacture these.

[12:43] And to make it easier to manufacture, they don't want to make games as loaded, as complex, as tricky to put together.

[12:54] And with a game like Harry Potter where they need to make so many of them, think about it.

[12:59] They don't want to create a nightmare for the people screwing the games together.

[13:06] You know you're gonna sell a lot because of theme alone.

[13:09] And so that is what I'm hearing.

[13:12] Don't expect a lot more in Harry Potter than you've seen in games like Toy Story, Godfather, Elton John, and Avatar.

[13:22] So I don't think we're gonna see Wizard of Oz in standard form or a Dialedon all over again with amazing stuff happening all over the game.

[13:34] I have not seen it, so I don't know for sure.

[13:38] But I just want to follow this narrative if it does happen.

[13:43] Let's talk in hypotheticals.

[13:45] If Harry Potter comes out and is underwhelming and doesn't have all the magic we expected to, and then they're also gonna make an unlimited amount of a $15,000 CE.

[14:02] I think what's gonna happen is this.

[14:05] It is going to reinforce where most people in this hobby currently are.

[14:11] That buying these games new in box and rushing towards them at these extravagant prices is no longer fun.

[14:21] In fact, it is painful.

[14:24] And I think as a hobby, we turn to pinball to have distractions from what's going on in the real world.

[14:33] And of course we want to have fun.

[14:35] But I also think that now everybody, unless you're like a newbie, everybody is realizing that pinball fun has a threshold of how much you will spend on that fun.

[14:49] And if you're gonna spend $15,000 on a Jersey Jack Harry Potter, not only do you want the game to be fun, you also want the game to have a ton of awesome stuff in it.

[15:03] And I'm sorry, but like it should rival, I mean this, it should rival games like medieval madness.

[15:11] It should rival games like Godzilla.

[15:14] It should rival games like Toten and Theater of Magic.

[15:18] It should rival games like Wizard of Oz and Dialed In.

[15:23] It should be on the same pedestal of games like the Twilight Zone.

[15:28] And again, we're talking $15,000.

[15:33] What do you think the bomb is on a Jersey Jack game?

[15:38] If a stern bomb is around $3,000 to $5,000, then a Jersey Jack bomb is probably $7,7500.

[15:48] So think about it.

[15:49] If the bomb on Harry Potter, it's gotta be like $7,500 because if they're gonna sell this standard Wizard Edition, that's gonna have everything mechanically in it as the L.E.M. the C.E.C.

[16:02] Now all of a sudden, gang, I'm starting to feel like my rumor makes sense because maybe there's not a lot mechanically in it.

[16:10] And that's why the $10,000 version has the same stuff in it as the $15,000 version.

[16:20] And if the bomb on the game is like $7,500, that sort of makes sense because if you're selling a version for $10,000, that means you're only making $20,000.

[16:31] $20,500 on top of the bomb.

[16:35] And you've also got to give some money to the distros for selling the damn game.

[16:40] And that's why they want to make unlimited C.E.s because then they're making $7,500 on every single game they make.

[16:48] And they're not putting anything more in it mechanically.

[16:51] Again, all of this is hypothetical, but I'm starting to feel like here's what's gonna happen.

[16:58] And I'm just gonna say it on Canada Spinball Podcasts.

[17:02] I have a feeling that Harry Potter will be underwhelming because there won't be that much in it.

[17:10] I think the gameplay will be fast.

[17:13] I don't think it's gonna be loaded like you expect.

[17:16] I also fully expect the majority of the clips in this game to be muted.

[17:22] I do not think it's gonna be like Dune.

[17:25] I spoke to the people over at Barrels.

[17:27] Every single Dune clip, for the most part, that you're gonna see is gonna be synced up with the voice actors during those moments in the movie.

[17:37] So it's not gonna be like an endless loop of muted clips.

[17:41] Now think about Jersey Jack's games, for the most part.

[17:44] Muted clips in Toy Story.

[17:46] Muted clips in Avatar.

[17:48] Why would we expect there not to be muted clips in Harry Potter?

[17:53] So if you take into account muted clips, not a lot in it mechanically, I just don't know.

[18:01] Unlimited CEs, I think people are gonna say enough.

[18:06] We're not spending this if this is what you're gonna give us.

[18:11] You gave us Wizard of Oz, loaded wide body game for $6,500.

[18:17] I know that was a decade ago, but still, a decade later,

[18:23] there should be more in the game.

[18:25] There should be a lot more considering the game is $80 something, $100.

[18:30] It's $8,500 more than Wizard of Oz was.

[18:35] So if you're gonna charge us $15,000, how?

[18:39] How could a $15,000 game have exactly the same mechanical stuff as the $10,000 version of the game?

[18:48] So then you're spending $5,000 on radcals, a topper and some glass and a shaker motor.

[18:56] Gang, Kaneda's just saying this right now.

[18:59] And then if this happens, right, if this happens and you've got Kong that was underwhelming,

[19:05] you got Dune that is incomplete, you got Harry Potter that's not loaded,

[19:10] I think what you're gonna see is this.

[19:13] I think you're gonna see a lot of people just be like, I'm done with new inbox.

[19:18] I'm done.

[19:19] I'm absolutely done.

[19:21] The only time I'm even gonna consider new inbox is if it's a boutique game that's built on a theme I want

[19:28] or has a lot of special stuff in it like Evil Dead, and then I will buy it

[19:33] because that's the only time you should ever move somewhat quickly to a new inbox game.

[19:39] And it's not that you don't want to play Harry Potter.

[19:42] It's not that it's not gonna look fun.

[19:44] I just think most people are gonna be smart and not want to lose $5,000

[19:48] because if they make unlimited CEs and this game is not magically loaded,

[19:53] you best believe easy to get one for $10,000 in just a few months.

[19:58] Gang, King Kong LE where there's less than a thousand lost $1,000 in one week, in one week.

[20:05] And the days are over and I mean this at these high prices, the days are over

[20:10] of if the code gets good eventually, that's not gonna course correct these games.

[20:16] It's not gonna bring the value back.

[20:19] Now, speaking of value, let's just look real quick at recent games that went up for sale.

[20:25] Okay, I'm just pulling up inside right now.

[20:27] These are games that went up for sale recently and let's just all collectively ask ourselves

[20:34] why buy new inbox?

[20:38] Alright, James Bond Premium.

[20:40] That game brand new was $9,500.

[20:44] You can now get one with 168 plays for $7,500.

[20:51] And I'm just gonna go up the new games because there's older games for sale too.

[20:54] So that's a loss of $2,000.

[20:57] Foo Fighters Premium.

[20:58] Same price as Bond was.

[21:00] $7,500 or best offer.

[21:03] You know what that means?

[21:05] $7,000.

[21:06] That's a $2,500 loss.

[21:08] The Walking Dead LE.

[21:10] You know why this game is for sale?

[21:12] Because a new Walking Dead is coming out.

[21:15] Now, Walking Dead LE brand new was what?

[21:18] Like $6,500.

[21:20] This was the only stuff that held value and went up.

[21:23] Now this person wants $10,500 for their Walking Dead LE.

[21:29] The problem is nobody's gonna go near this because a new Walking Dead is coming out.

[21:35] It's also gonna come with the topper.

[21:38] So I'm giving you that news.

[21:40] Is that a Canadian exclusive?

[21:42] Walking Dead is coming back and they're rerunning the topper with the three heads.

[21:47] So you're gonna be able to get all that in a newer package with an LCD screen and I think better artwork.

[21:54] So nobody's gonna want the old Walking Dead.

[21:57] New age Mutant Ninja Turtles Premium.

[21:59] $6,400.

[22:01] That's a loss.

[22:02] Metallica Remastered Premium.

[22:04] This game just came out.

[22:06] $8,700. Cheaper than it was new.

[22:08] Here we go.

[22:09] The Uncanny X-Men LE.

[22:12] This game was $13,000.

[22:15] $8,995.

[22:18] In one year, $4,000 loss.

[22:22] Now everybody's hoping this game is gonna get a significant code update.

[22:26] I hope so.

[22:27] I still think X-Men is a better layout than King Kong.

[22:31] I think it's the best layout we've had all year.

[22:34] Just nobody wants this code.

[22:36] Let's see what else we got here.

[22:38] Foo Fighters LE.

[22:39] Remember Foo Fighters LE?

[22:40] Right, one of the fastest selling LE's ever.

[22:43] Foo Fighters LE.

[22:44] The game was $13,000.

[22:48] You can go get one now for $8,600 firm.

[22:52] Ladies and gentlemen, are you sitting down?

[22:54] That is a loss of $4,400.

[22:58] In Elton John Platinum Edition, if you really want an Elton John,

[23:02] the Platinum Editions were $12,000.

[23:04] Now $10,200 or best offer.

[23:08] 10 on the table.

[23:09] You could probably get that for $9,500.

[23:12] So what is the cardboard box worth?

[23:15] So speaking more recently, for all you guys who bought an Avatar CE for $15,000,

[23:21] there's one up here for sale, $13,500 or best offer.

[23:26] Now whenever there's an OBO, you can knock off $500 immediately.

[23:31] So all of a sudden, a game that just came out, $2,000 off.

[23:35] How long has it been since Avatar has been out?

[23:37] It's been out a year and it's $2,000 off.

[23:40] And it's not going to sell for anywhere near that.

[23:42] We all know Avatar CE's are all going to be selling for $10,000.

[23:45] So gang, this is it.

[23:48] This is it.

[23:49] This is the problem with all modern pinball.

[23:52] And somebody needs to just make the first move.

[23:56] If you own a hotel and people are not booking rooms, what would you do?

[24:02] You would either improve the hotel and make people realize that the rooms are worth it,

[24:08] or you would lower the price of the rooms until you get occupancy.

[24:13] And I don't understand what's happening.

[24:15] So all these pinball companies are just going to make games and people forget.

[24:20] There's thousands of games in a box, in a warehouse, in Chicago, unsold.

[24:28] Which means the demand is not there.

[24:31] And these companies are going to keep cranking out games every week,

[24:35] add more supply when there's not even demand to begin with.

[24:39] Not even the great Keith Elwin can sell you 932 games globally.

[24:44] Gang!

[24:45] And if Harry Potter comes out and it's not loaded with stuff and it's 15 grand,

[24:50] everybody's going to realize.

[24:52] Let's just enjoy the great machines we have.

[24:56] Let's wait for truly magical games.

[24:59] Let's support where the real passion is in pinball now.

[25:03] And I think it's at the boutique level.

[25:05] I mean it.

[25:06] I'm going to tell you this right now.

[25:07] I think the sandworm in Dune Pinball is going to be more impressive mechanically

[25:14] than anything in Harry Potter.

[25:17] You know why I'm going to make that proclamation?

[25:20] Because it's more impressive than anything in Elton John, Toy Story 4, Avatar, and Godfather.

[25:27] And if my source is accurate, and I trust him because he's in the industry

[25:31] and he knows everybody, if my source is accurate,

[25:34] there's nothing more mechanically interesting in Harry Potter than is in Dune.

[25:39] And he didn't say it's as impressive as the sandworm.

[25:42] Nope.

[25:43] He said, I think people are going to look at Dune and say it's got more mechanical wow

[25:49] than what's in Harry Potter.

[25:51] That's not going to make us quit the hobby.

[25:53] It's not going to make you cancel Canada's Pinball podcast because of this stale content

[25:58] that I won't stop talking about.

[26:00] What it's going to make you do is re-appreciate the games you already have.

[26:06] It's going to make you understand that you got into the hobby at the right time.

[26:11] Now is the worst time ever to get into this hobby as a buyer of NUEN BOX.

[26:17] But it's the best time ever to be in this hobby if you've been in it for many years

[26:22] because gang, it's entertaining.

[26:24] It is absolutely the most entertaining thing happening in Pinball

[26:28] is watching these big companies try to convince us to spend this much money on NUEN BOX games

[26:35] as all of them lose thousands of dollars a year.

[26:39] And the people that are like, well, it's just like a car, like normal depreciation.

[26:43] No, it wasn't normal.

[26:45] None of this was what this hobby was built on.

[26:49] It was not normal.

[26:51] People didn't normally lose one to $6,000 in one year on a game.

[26:56] The normal depreciation and why Pinball was so popular amongst us,

[27:01] the normal depreciation, the most you would ever have lost on a game was $1,000.

[27:07] Now the most anyone has ever lost on a NUEN BOX game over the last four years was $12,000 on a James Bond 60th

[27:17] if you bought it from Stern with tax.

[27:19] $12,000.

[27:22] So don't tell me this is normal.

[27:24] Don't tell me this is like car depreciation.

[27:27] It's not.

[27:28] And unlike a car, yeah, when you drive a car, the wear and tear on it is horrible.

[27:33] People can do all sorts of horrible things in their car.

[27:36] They can get in accidents.

[27:37] You don't know about it.

[27:38] When you buy a used pin, it's like brand new.

[27:42] I mean, brand new.

[27:44] Like there's nothing wrong with the game.

[27:46] These are not cars.

[27:47] They don't break down over time like a car.

[27:50] There's not all these moving parts that are really getting wear and tear.

[27:53] There's not.

[27:54] There's a few things that are moving that you can replace, but none of it is significant.

[27:58] The way a car used is nowhere near as good as a car is new, but a used pin is oftentimes better and dialed in better

[28:07] and better looked out for.

[28:09] I mean, a lot of these manufacturers are sending you stuff that's got problems and it takes the first owner to fix them all.

[28:16] And then when you buy new, you have less headaches than NUEN BOX buyers.

[28:22] So that is where we are at.

[28:25] So the fun now is more about playing the games you own, listening to Canada's pinball podcast.

[28:32] Because if you listen to me, I have saved you tens of thousands of dollars over the last four years.

[28:40] And all the people telling me to stop talking about this.

[28:43] If you listen to them, you've lost tens of thousands of dollars.

[28:48] I wish more of them would just come out and say, this sucks.

[28:52] This sucks.

[28:53] I bought four sternleys because I just wanted to have fun and make pinball content.

[28:59] And I lost $16,000 on these games when I traded them in.

[29:03] Where's the brutal honesty about the reality of the secondhand market and the overpriced nature of these games?

[29:12] Ladies and gentlemen, here's my advice to you.

[29:15] Don't rush at Harry Potter NUEN BOX.

[29:18] Just don't play it first.

[29:20] See where the code is at.

[29:22] If the game is absolutely magical, and I hope it is, and if it's loaded, and I hope it is loaded.

[29:27] If it's everything that it should be, you know, based on that letter that Jack wrote about,

[29:33] this is the culmination of our entire company's dream, then this damn game better be better than everything else.

[29:42] It should feel like a pirate had a baby with Wizard of Oz and was put into a standard body cabinet.

[29:49] But if this game comes out and it doesn't have a lot of stuff, if it doesn't have flying monkeys grabbing the ball

[29:56] and bringing it up to the upper playfield with a magnet, if it doesn't have a witch coming up underneath the playfield,

[30:02] if it doesn't have a huge dragon that's talking to you, if it doesn't have a ship that rocks back and forth

[30:07] and fires a freaking cannon shot to another upper playfield, if it doesn't have magic,

[30:14] if it doesn't have stuff that's cooler than that stuff, then why the heck is this game 15 grand?

[30:21] Have we learned nothing? Are we going backwards? If it has muted clips?

[30:26] And if the thing is just all about layout and diverters and shots and kickbacks, it's not good enough.

[30:33] Everybody, happy Friday. Listen to me. I will hold your hand through the launch of this game.

[30:41] Don't rush in, especially if they're making an unlimited amount of the CEs.

[30:48] Let the dealers and the distros and the newbie chumps let them buy them up.

[30:54] You and I can march in if we want to see E get one before the holidays and get it for thousands less.

[31:03] Canada, the Stalest Pinball Podcaster and the most entertaining at the same time saying have a great weekend.

[31:11] We've got a new pope in the world.

[31:13] And I heard the first thing he said was the biggest cardinal sin is buying new inbox pinball in 2025.

[31:21] And he's from Chicago and he remembers what pinball pricing should be.

[31:26] Canada out.

[31:51] Canada out.

[32:21] Canada out.
