[01:03] All right.

[01:06] I don't know why he always does this.

[01:07] Why it wants to do it like a day earlier.

[01:11] It's weird.

[01:14] Let's do it. Let's backstamp it.

[01:19] I don't even know if that's the right way to do it.

[01:23] How's everybody doing?

[01:24] We got anybody in the house here?

[01:25] Well, we got people, people are slowly trickling and we got Barcelona in the house.

[01:32] We've got everybody waiting to see what can they just going to say.

[01:35] That's not true. That's not true.

[01:38] That is not true.

[01:43] SMS live now. All right.

[01:48] I was thinking about doing both Facebook and YouTube at the same time.

[01:54] But we're just going to keep it here.

[01:57] How's everybody doing? Happy freaking Saturday morning.

[02:02] It is going to be a fun show today.

[02:05] We're going to talk about what's happening in Pimbal this week.

[02:07] I got some news.

[02:08] I've got some stuff to talk about.

[02:10] I've got some updates from our friends over at barrels of fun.

[02:16] A lot of fun in those barrels.

[02:18] Let's get everybody here.

[02:20] We live.

[02:26] Oh, man.

[02:28] Man or man or shavots?

[02:30] Man or man or shavots?

[02:32] Jeremy, what's up?

[02:34] Lord Olaf.

[02:35] I'm going to have to get prescription versions of these glasses.

[02:39] I don't even know if that's possible.

[02:41] But my eyesight and reading glasses now, it's crazy.

[02:46] I love 2001 Axel when he came back.

[02:50] This is like he had been gone for a shoot.

[02:54] Five, six years, man.

[02:55] No one even saw him.

[02:56] It wasn't even like he was at the grocery store.

[02:59] You got your avatar CE and it's amazing.

[03:02] Look, I hope you enjoy your $19,000 avatar CE, man.

[03:09] That's the point of it.

[03:10] That is the point of it.

[03:13] The whole point is the buy a game you enjoy.

[03:20] I don't see the appeal of avatar at these prices.

[03:25] I find the game to be beautiful.

[03:28] I just don't click with the story and the energy of the game.

[03:35] I don't know, Olaf.

[03:36] You know what I'm saying?

[03:37] I've seen the avatar movies.

[03:40] Here's the thing that I really just can't get over.

[03:43] The whole point of avatar is 3D.

[03:45] This is the whole point.

[03:46] The thing is 3D iMacs masterpiece.

[03:49] That is the whole point.

[03:50] The story sucks.

[03:51] You know what I'm saying?

[03:53] You got to go watch some people did a review once of the avatar movies

[03:58] in 2D in a regular theater.

[04:00] And just like just reviewing the movie based on the storyline itself.

[04:05] It's not good.

[04:08] And so, you know, the whole thing was 3D.

[04:11] And then you've got this game where there's not even a moment

[04:14] where the game is in 3D.

[04:16] And I am shocked that there's no 3D mode at all in the Pimbal machine.

[04:21] I mean, jaws beat them to the punch.

[04:23] Jaws comes with the glasses.

[04:24] And then you get avatar no 3D.

[04:26] Again, how do you, in a boardroom at Jersey Jack Pimbal,

[04:31] how do you decide not to have any 3D elements to avatar?

[04:36] I don't get it.

[04:37] I don't get it.

[04:38] Morning. What's up guys?

[04:39] Get to the chopper.

[04:40] We're going to talk a lot about predator.

[04:42] We're going to talk about what's going on in the Pimbal world.

[04:44] Maybe we should throw this up on Facebook at the same time

[04:46] if everybody to come over.

[04:47] You know, we'll get people over.

[04:49] The link's live.

[04:51] I love it.

[04:52] I love it.

[04:53] You know what I'm saying?

[04:54] You know, can it is just going to do what he wants to do.

[04:56] I love.

[04:57] I don't have any rules.

[04:58] Let's do live.

[04:59] Let's do S.M.S.

[05:04] I'm just going to do S.M.S. from now on.

[05:09] I don't even care.

[05:11] There we go.

[05:13] Let's try doing both at the same time.

[05:14] See what happens here.

[05:16] All right.

[05:19] It's going to be funky.

[05:22] It's going to be funky.

[05:23] Saturday morning.

[05:25] We got, we got, we got both things going.

[05:27] We got double vision of Canada.

[05:29] How's everybody doing?

[05:30] I love this.

[05:31] Like this is, I should have four screens going.

[05:33] I should get, I should get me on the TV there.

[05:36] Lab top, cell phone, everything.

[05:38] Saturday morning's spectacular.

[05:40] What's up, Robert?

[05:41] How you guys doing?

[05:43] The more the merrier, even if those punks don't play.

[05:47] Ah, man.

[05:48] You know, look, I think, I think it's going to get real, real crazy

[05:53] in Pimbal real soon.

[05:54] I mean, everybody knows we've got a lot of people

[05:56] coming out.

[05:57] We've got people wondering, where do I put my money?

[06:00] And I've been talking to people.

[06:02] And everybody is recognizing right now.

[06:04] We're at the calm before the storm.

[06:06] And I've got updates.

[06:07] I'm barrels of fun.

[06:08] Pimbal brother is as clearly, you know, they're starting their teaser

[06:11] for Predator.

[06:12] We're going to talk about that.

[06:13] We're going to talk about Stern Pimbal.

[06:15] We're going to talk about D&D.

[06:17] We're going to talk about King Kong.

[06:19] We're going to talk about,

[06:21] we're going to talk about,

[06:23] fiction, we're going to talk about what else is going on?

[06:26] I have a Tarsie E owners.

[06:28] We got people on Facebook.

[06:29] We got people on YouTube.

[06:30] How is everybody doing?

[06:31] This is funny to me.

[06:32] This is funny to me.

[06:33] We've got, I think you've Facebook guys.

[06:35] You just come over to the YouTube.

[06:37] But we could do both like this.

[06:39] I really don't care.

[06:40] I really don't care.

[06:41] I mean, it, it doesn't really matter to me.

[06:44] You don't sound in so much pain now.

[06:47] Well, here's the thing.

[06:49] Here's the thing.

[06:50] Herne surgery is a pain in the beauty.

[06:55] And I'm just happy that it's over a week ago.

[07:01] It was extraordinarily painful.

[07:03] I couldn't even move.

[07:05] I was like kind of lying down,

[07:07] like just trying to shuffle my legs.

[07:09] And now I'm feeling much better.

[07:13] There's a little discomfort.

[07:15] It just, you know, a little bit of a,

[07:16] a, a, a, sort of just a moderate sort of sting-in sensation,

[07:20] if you will.

[07:21] But, you know, week, a week following the doctors,

[07:26] orders, resting up, I've been working all week.

[07:29] I've been working all week.

[07:30] So it's, it's pretty good.

[07:32] It's pretty good.

[07:33] All right, everybody, let's,

[07:35] I don't know.

[07:36] Should we keep the Facebook going?

[07:37] I don't know.

[07:38] There's only six people watching on Facebook.

[07:39] Where is everybody just this Saturday, more than I mean,

[07:41] I mean, maybe, maybe everyone's,

[07:42] maybe everyone's playing Avatar CE.

[07:45] All right, so here's,

[07:47] here's the thing.

[07:48] Let's start in order of the news of the week.

[07:52] And I think that's the best way we do it.

[07:55] So the news of the week,

[07:57] first and foremost, is predator.

[08:00] And, you know, this is a title that's been in the rumor mill

[08:04] for a long time.

[08:05] We've heard predator floating around for maybe six months.

[08:10] And so what I gave to the Patreon,

[08:13] subscribers this week is additional details,

[08:15] which I haven't really heard many people talk about.

[08:18] We are on YouTube, Eric,

[08:20] and we're on Facebook.

[08:21] It's in both.

[08:22] You can join on YouTube.

[08:23] You can join on Facebook.

[08:24] Wherever you want to join this week,

[08:26] I'm going everywhere.

[08:27] So like,

[08:28] I could unite the audiences or you can stay on Facebook.

[08:31] It doesn't matter.

[08:32] I'm reading both comments.

[08:33] It's a, we got tool screen going here.

[08:35] So it's going to be a wide body pin.

[08:39] And that is the thing that I'm going to do.

[08:41] And that, that is interesting.

[08:45] Do you want predator to be wide body or not?

[08:48] What do you guys think?

[08:49] I think if you ask me,

[08:52] I don't care.

[08:55] I really don't care.

[08:56] I just want a great pin.

[08:58] I want a pin that is really load it with some fun stuff.

[09:02] I want a pin that has the assets and translates the predator movie perfectly.

[09:07] I think the craziest part about predator coming out right now,

[09:10] is the main thing you need to do is the UV lighting.

[09:15] And so now we've got two movies,

[09:18] Avatar and predator,

[09:20] where UV lighting the game and getting that bioluminescent effect

[09:24] and you know,

[09:25] the predator blood to glow in the game.

[09:28] It's going to be really funny if this game also attempts to do some sort of UV lighting in the game.

[09:36] So here's the thing about predator.

[09:38] As a theme, it's phenomenal.

[09:40] Anyone who disagrees,

[09:42] you don't get it.

[09:43] You don't get it.

[09:44] They're going to sell all thousand of these things if the game isn't a total dog.

[09:49] Okay, so we've got that going.

[09:51] Now the other thing is this,

[09:53] wide body by pinball brothers.

[09:56] Now the pinball brothers have released a few games that are absolute dogs.

[10:03] Dogs, queen pinball, eh.

[10:07] Sorry Dave Sanders, eh.

[10:10] Queen pinball when it came out, it looked dated, right?

[10:13] It came out and it looked like it came out 10 years prior.

[10:16] Aba is like unquestionably.

[10:19] Is that even a word unquestionably?

[10:21] Is undoubtedly, yeah, that's better.

[10:23] Come on, get the grammar going.

[10:26] Aba undoubtedly.

[10:29] Unequivocally,

[10:30] I don't even know what I'm trying to say.

[10:32] Aba is atrocious.

[10:34] Everybody who plays Aba walks away with a negative opinion about the game.

[10:42] And so when you get a dream theme for a lot of people like Predator,

[10:46] it's just an awesome cool badass movie, right?

[10:49] You get a great theme like that.

[10:51] And then you hand it to the pinball brothers.

[10:55] And that's got a lot of people anxious.

[10:57] It's not who anyone would pick as their choice of company to make the game.

[11:02] I think there are five companies in front of them that you would rather have make Predator Stern,

[11:09] Jersey Jack, Spooky Pinball, CGC, right?

[11:12] Who else?

[11:13] Who else am I missing here?

[11:15] Dutch pinball, right?

[11:17] You could add even a few more probably.

[11:20] Pinball brothers is really not even on one hand of who you would want to make Predator.

[11:26] I just think that this game, this game, is a moment for pinball brothers.

[11:33] I firmly believe in people's ability to do a 180 to show us what they can really do.

[11:43] And this game to me is the maker break game for pinball brothers,

[11:47] because if they nail it and they surprising delight us with an awesome Predator machine

[11:54] that's done right, that has good flipper feel, that has great translation of the theme

[12:00] and the assets are awesome.

[12:02] And Arnold is featured throughout it and the art is cool.

[12:05] If they do it justice, and this game comes up and wins us over,

[12:10] I think pinball brothers is going to start a new chapter in that company's history.

[12:15] But if the game comes out and it's got floaty weak flippers in a wide body right away,

[12:23] it's going to be unsatisfying.

[12:25] If the artwork is bad like ABO, you're going to get disappointed.

[12:30] Because you look at a game like Guns and Roses, it's beautiful.

[12:33] It came out four or five years ago.

[12:34] There's no reason why a modern pinball machine shouldn't have phenomenal artwork,

[12:40] shouldn't look incredible.

[12:42] And people play these pinball brother games and they just feel like soft,

[12:49] like soft, more attempts or JV attempts soft, more I'm all over the place with my metaphors today,

[12:56] people sorry, I'm still recovering.

[12:58] So cut me some slack today.

[13:00] It's been a painful week and I didn't even know I'd be feeling up for this show.

[13:05] Here's what I want to ask everybody right here and I want you guys to get involved with this.

[13:09] What do you think the next should be in a Predator pinball machine?

[13:16] I was thinking about this now.

[13:18] Now it's funny right because the first mech has to be the chopper and they put a chopper into Queen.

[13:27] But I think you've got to have that army military chopper as a place to load the balls and get Dutch in his crew in the chopper to,

[13:39] you know, I think in the chopper to enter into battle with the Predator and the jungle,

[13:45] but also think about it.

[13:47] Get to the chopper needs to be maybe the end two of the game where you have to escape because that's the whole thing.

[13:55] You got to get out of that jungle now.

[13:57] I don't know we'll see.

[13:58] I also think they need a topper not a chopper a topper that has the Predator's laser pointer,

[14:07] you know, on his shoulder with the, you know, those three little signals or what are they like symbols that he uses to sort of track on,

[14:15] do his prey, the one that goes up call whether his arm and Dylan's arm Dylan you son of a canada and blows his arm off.

[14:25] I think you need that.

[14:26] All right, some reading some of your stuff, thermal vision mode.

[14:29] Yes, so they definitely need some sort of thermal vision mode.

[14:33] I'm not sure how you do that, but that could be cool on the screen projector that shines three lights on to the play field.

[14:41] Okay, I guess that means like the Predator's like his laser pointer.

[14:45] We are online telling the companies what to do.

[14:48] Let them figure it out.

[14:50] I'm paying them.

[14:52] They're not paying me.

[14:53] Okay, so that's a troll Derby went to Disney.

[14:58] I look, man, are you seriously you can have fun thinking about what you'd be in a game and I mean you're in the wrong place.

[15:06] If you don't want to have a good time imagining and dreaming up what mix could be in the game.

[15:11] I look, I think a chopper.

[15:14] I think you need the Gatling gun, you know that that that Gatling gun, the one that Jesse the body has is amazing.

[15:21] I also think, guys, let's think about the movie.

[15:23] Okay, let's think about the movie.

[15:26] I think it might have.

[15:29] Does it have maybe in like an underwater lower play field that's not terrible.

[15:36] I feel like in predator, you know, the scene where he goes over the waterfall and then he gets covered in mud.

[15:42] So will there be a waterfall or an upper play field that gives that sensation of, you know, jumping from the predator chasing you into the muddy area to cover yourself to survive.

[15:55] Also remember Arnold like kind of chops up the jungle and creates that swinging log that hits the predator.

[16:03] I think that could be an interesting mech to think about like how would you create your sort of fort to battle the predator.

[16:11] Will that be an area of the play field?

[16:14] No, John just said it should be predator one and two.

[16:17] John, you know, put the crack pipe down.

[16:20] It's got to be just predator one.

[16:23] What if you were the predator in the game chat?

[16:26] No, that doesn't make any sense.

[16:28] Why would you want to play as the predator that you couldn't use the movie clips.

[16:33] If you were playing as the predator, all the action, all the momentum in the movie are they are touching his crew.

[16:41] So I think that is a I can't wait though.

[16:45] I can't wait to see how they handle this game because the good news is this everybody has probably seen predator that's in this demographic.

[16:56] So you're going to get opinions from everybody.

[17:01] And when those opinions are out there and those expectations are out there, this game's going to get a reaction.

[17:08] It's going to get a reaction.

[17:10] It's not going to be one of these games like Queen and Abba that just came out and nobody cared right.

[17:15] It was only like diesel boob was the only guy talking about queen on the inside and nobody else cared.

[17:20] I mean go to the queen owners thread and see how many people are active in that thread like nobody.

[17:26] It's kind of like the John Wick thread these days.

[17:28] Have you been in the John Wick thread this week? It's funny.

[17:30] These guys are paying $1,500 for this stupid topper.

[17:35] Because like these guys actually are trying to convince themselves that plastic is more expensive because it's thicker news flash gang.

[17:46] It's just plastic.

[17:48] I mean, I don't care if it's a quarter of an inch, but it's like this guy's out there showing his unboxing like measuring the thickness of the plastic being like, all right, you know, I did just spend $1,500 on this thing.

[18:00] But look how thick the plastic is and then it's got this hourglass that rotates.

[18:05] Have you seen this thing and then it it's it never stops level with the topper.

[18:11] It's always a little crooked. It's so annoying and all it does.

[18:15] All it does is rotate up and down.

[18:17] It's not synced up with anything in the game. So think about that.

[18:20] You've got this hourglass that could be utilized in a mode.

[18:25] But it's not because the topper has no idea of even knowing where the sand is in the hourglass.

[18:33] So for $1,500 and then the most comical thing is the is the shooter knob that is $200 gang.

[18:44] It's $200 and it's a piece of plastic.

[18:50] Like that to me. Okay. If you want to talk about the one item at Stern Pimble where they are making the most money on it is the shooter knob for John Wick.

[18:59] That thing plastic sculpted once you make one sculpt of it, you're just pouring it into a mold.

[19:07] That thing probably costs Stern Pimble to make that in China less than $5.

[19:13] And they're selling it for $200.

[19:18] $200. Half the price of an Xbox.

[19:23] I mean, when I see stuff like that, and look, it's Stern. God bless you Stern.

[19:28] God bless you Stern. You found a community that absolutely has no expectations of getting what they're paying for.

[19:36] And you can't blame Stern for charging $1,500 for flat plastic toppers because people bought bottom people bought them.

[19:46] And it's just kind of comical. I think we're kind of over the whole topper thing.

[19:51] I know there's a new topper coming out for pull fiction and I mean, look at Alice's adventures in one and then we're going to talk about that in a little bit with they just released the apron photos.

[20:00] You know, that topper comes with the game and a little motor. I mean, that whole topper the bomb on that topper.

[20:06] Let's be honest game the bomb on that topper at most is a hundred bucks at most.

[20:14] I would say the bomb on that topper is like $50 to $75.

[20:20] I mean, plastic plastic.

[20:24] Sitting on top of a middle plate with a little motor. How much is a motor? Five bucks, a little motor.

[20:30] Ten at most. Some brackets, screws and LED lights are $5 at most.

[20:38] 1500. 1500.

[20:42] Electric playground toppers are free. Yes, they are.

[20:47] So again, we're also on YouTube right now. We got we got 62 people on YouTube in 29 here, which is like almost that we're almost at like our hundred.

[20:57] I should throw everybody over to YouTube.

[21:00] I like YouTube. It's kind of wider. You know, you can see the the whole thing.

[21:04] It you know, the vertical here. Yeah, you know, but I want to give people options today.

[21:08] I want to give people options. Okay, so predator.

[21:12] What do you guys think you think it's going to be good or bad? Like just right good or bad? Don't write anything else.

[21:17] I don't want to I don't want to hear paragraphs. Do you think predator is going to be good or bad? The pinball brothers is going to watch this.

[21:24] Do you think predator is going to be good or bad? Okay, I just just go everybody. Come on.

[21:31] 80 people just write it. Write it. I don't care if you're driving pull over to the side of the road. Don't crash your car.

[21:37] Good or bad on predator. All right, we got bad, bad, bad, good, good.

[21:45] Where else good, good, good, good. We got bad over here.

[21:53] Yeah, someone can't follow directions. Not good. YouTube sounds a lot better. Of course YouTube sounds a lot better because on YouTube, you're hearing me through a $600 microphone.

[22:07] So if you want to get better quality, come to YouTube. That's the way it is. That's the way it goes. Let me tell you what I think.

[22:16] I think predator is going to be a dog. I'm buying it. I think it's going to be a dog because I love dogs. But I think it's going to be a dog. I think it's going to be a stinker. I do.

[22:29] I absolutely. I don't know how you can think that the pinball brothers with their internal design team and what they've put into the market. How how are you coming to the conclusion? It's going to be good.

[22:42] I don't think theme is going to save it. Gang, Led Zeppelin, right? Star Wars. Right. I mean, Star Wars is not a good pin. Star Wars is a dog in my honest opinion. I think it's going to be a dog. I think it's going to be a dog. I think it's going to be floaty. I think it's going to be a little empty.

[23:02] I think it's going to be clunky. And I think the art is going to be bad. And then I think it's going to be a yeah, I think it's that I think that's it. I just think it's going to be bad. Now, let me follow that up by saying I want it to be good. I don't want to be good. I want to be great. I want to be awesome.

[23:22] I love this theme more than almost anything that's come out in the last five years. I mean, we could talk for hours about how crappy the themes have been in pinball for the last few years. And I don't think people would disagree.

[23:35] I think everybody is kind of over stuff like Godfather, stuff like Elton John, stuff like Venom, stuff like John Wick, stuff like Avatar, stuff like Toy Story 4. I think people want more. I don't think this is what people come to pinball for.

[23:50] I think evil dead is a great pin if you're an evil dead fan. But most people don't really want evil dead. Like they're almost sold out of evil dead, but still not. I mean, the calm is in that pin is gang. It's March.

[24:03] They released that game in December. It's it's gorgeous. It's loaded. It's got everything you can want. And it's still not sold out. They sold out a Rick and Morty 750 in one day. One day. It's not a strong theme.

[24:18] They're putting a lot of effort. They will get all 800 and something. So gang, they're bringing 11 to TPS. Those 11 you could buy off the show off the floor and put in your truck and bring it home. So like everyone who's waiting now six months to get their evil dead. They could have just bought one of those TPS games. I think you get a little bit of a discount. And you'd have the game.

[24:43] You could cut the line. It happens every time. I mean, spooky smart. They basically use their unsolved inventory to become show games to then sell on the spot, which is smart because there's a lot of grown adults who aren't man children like us who don't go to pinside, don't follow Facebook and YouTube and content creators and pinball. And they just walk into a pinball show.

[25:10] And they play some games and they didn't even know these games were out and they like what they're playing and they buy one on the spot. That is how it goes sometimes reminds me of my dad. You know, my dad once went to a car show.

[25:23] My dad was the man in the 90s. Dude was a senior vice president in M&A for a major pharmaceutical company. My dad was the man. He's still alive. I don't know why I'm talking about that. He still is the man.

[25:36] But my dad went to the New York Auto Show and it was 1990. I want to say it was 1991.

[25:44] And he sees a cherry red Nissan 300 ZX twin turbo.

[25:52] And he walks up and he says I want I want this car. And the guy is like, okay, great. He's like, I want this one.

[26:00] And he buys the car on the spot in fall right off the show room, right off the Auto Show floor. And they kept it there. And then they, you know, then they delivered it to him after the show.

[26:12] I still loved it. When I was a little kid when my dad pulled up and that 300 ZX twin turbo and red.

[26:17] That was one of the coolest cars back then. I mean, there's a new found appreciation for stuff from the 90s and all these 90s cars.

[26:25] Well, you know, it's interesting with pinball because when you look at pinball between 90s and now really, you know, the lighting is better, the code is better.

[26:33] But the actual imagination and the creativity was much better back then.

[26:39] I don't think anybody would argue with you on that. Right. I don't think anybody would argue that the creativity under glass was far superior in the 90s and it is today.

[26:49] Does anyone disagree with that statement? Look at it came like John Wick, man.

[26:53] Like it is like look at Avatar man. Like I like, let's talk about Avatar for me because I know everyone's getting their CEs.

[27:01] And you guys spent 15,000 on them and look, I'm happy you guys are happy with your games. The games are gorgeous.

[27:08] I still don't understand. I still when I hear people describe the game, people still can't articulate what exactly is so mesmerizing about what they're playing.

[27:22] You know, I get that it's got it's got the lights, it's got the artwork, it's got you know, the overall sort of aura of the game.

[27:31] But what like I guess the thing I want to know is what mode what modes are moments. I think that's a better thing. What moments in Avatar are making you feel like these moments are magical.

[27:45] And is it just the overall constant light show and sort of just appearance of the game like is it just winning you over on beauty on the music.

[27:57] Like what what about it is just so incredible. I'm just curious because when I played it and I spent a couple hours on it.

[28:06] I saw the lights and this and then I just felt like I just felt like a disconnect with what's happening in the game and on the screen and on the play field.

[28:18] I just it just didn't pull me in with like energy and excitement and and and I don't know like are when you play Avatar. I'm just curious.

[28:27] What I'm curious are you like it does it get you your your blood boiling in a good way does it get you like I can't wait one more game like.

[28:35] And are you really really really excited to progress through the code in that game that that's just my question for people.

[28:44] Let's see I think I don't attack Lord Olaf. He's a huge Avatar fan. Lord Olaf says it's all about the shots and the flow. Okay, so like this is my thing gang.

[28:54] I think $10,000 and shots are the new toys is is where I have an issue.

[29:00] It's it's like come on really because Avatar doesn't shoot better than Elton John.

[29:05] And if I had a pick between Avatar and Elton John I would pick Elton John every time over Avatar because Elton John shoots I think the shots are cooler.

[29:17] I think the flow is better and I also think Elton John has a lot more energy.

[29:23] I mean, maybe they compliment each other, but I just don't see.

[29:27] I don't understand there's no there's not a single toy in Avatar.

[29:32] So you want me to spend 12 to 15,000 dollars and there's not a single toy in the game that interacts with the ball for 15,000 dollars and there's no sculpts in the game.

[29:45] That really bring the Pandora world to life at all.

[29:49] And when I you know, what they put in front of us is aesthetically very beautiful, but I find it to be sterile and lacking in depth.

[30:02] I find it to be here's the here's the thing the world of Pandora is very organic.

[30:09] It has this sort of nature and you can you can see the tree you can almost feel the wood when you see it you the leaves the branches the when you're soaring through the air on those creatures.

[30:23] The how they look the amount is I mean just think about the how they look the mountains and Jersey Jack pinball makes an Avatar game.

[30:30] Where some of the most iconic stuff happens up in the air and there's not even an upper play field.

[30:36] There's not even a sensation that you're flying through the air anywhere in the game.

[30:40] There's not even a sensation like you're going under the ocean.

[30:44] I just don't get what some of you who love the property how you're feeling like they nailed it.

[30:53] Okay, so look and the thing is this the thing is this Avatar is going to be another game that doesn't sell very well there they were there they sold more sea ease and at least that that's a that's that's not good for them business wise.

[31:15] And the value of them is going to go down because I think potter is going to embarrass it let's talk about Harry Potter we're going to go on the horn in no particular order.

[31:25] We got another hour doing this is guns and roses concert over my shoulder here you guys can see here let me turn it here.

[31:33] Axel this is Axel house of blues when he came back in 2001 he took the stage at two in the morning in Las Vegas amazing bucket head on stage bucket head is insane bucket head runs circles around slash I love you slash you wrote all this stuff with bucket head man bucket heads nitrane outro is the greatest live moment of guns or roses I've ever seen.

[31:53] Okay, so like Alice is where it's that we're going to talk Alice later, but let's talk about potter.

[32:00] So the latest I have on Harry Potter is Harry Potter is not going to come out until May and they're going to build all the Avatar's C.E.s and then that's it right there's no more demand for Avatar there's no there's Ellie sitting in boxes at this rose all over the world.

[32:18] So potter is going to be a game let's let me ask you guys first do you think that J.J.P. I want two words alright don't write sentences I don't care about what you did on the weekend I want one word or another word do you think they're going to nail Harry Potter or do you think it's going to be a big fail.

[32:43] So I want you to write if you think Eric Minier and the team at J.J.P. is going to fail or nail so write one of those words and I'm going to read out and see what we get here.

[32:54] Alright, let's see fail fail fail come on Scotty smash fail fail.

[33:04] Of course now Lord all Lord allops is now because he buys every J.J.P. and and so does Dave Sanders fail now fail well fail fail fail everyone saying fail.

[33:22] See I'm not leading you to say this has to be now there's no choice.

[33:29] Well yeah I mean Dave of course like they if they if they fumble Harry Potter.

[33:36] Okay so let me tell you what I think is going to happen with potter.

[33:42] Let me tell let me just collect my thoughts here and I think the little man's coming up behind my shoulder.

[33:52] What's up buddy want to say hi come here.

[33:57] Okay.

[33:59] Hi pinball pass good.

[34:02] Yeah.

[34:03] Good pinball.

[34:05] Yeah good pinball go pinball okay.

[34:08] Go pinball right.

[34:10] I don't think I got his twippy vote that's how I lost if I had my kids vote I would have won so close point point 1% yeah.

[34:20] By the way Kale and I have been chatting ever since the twippy's electric bat guys check him out they do a podcast about.

[34:29] Even kale was like dude he's like I don't even know how I won you got almost a hundred more votes than me like on my kale nobody knows how the scoring went because you know what.

[34:37] You know what Kale never released.

[34:40] He never released how many second and third place votes people got so.

[34:46] Interesting they didn't release that think about that per minute so you had you had multiple categories where the where the thing that got the most first place votes didn't win.

[34:57] Really easy to put your finger on the scale there Colin right release the numbers why wouldn't you release him if you have them release them.

[35:05] That's all I'm saying people transparency if you're going to do an award show transparency.

[35:14] Fail fail fail.

[35:17] All right so here's the thing here's my thought and yeah honestly we're all past it I don't really care.

[35:24] I think I think Jersey Jack Harry Potter.

[35:32] I think it's going to be a fail and I want to give all the different reasons why I think it's going to be a fail I think.

[35:42] First and foremost.

[35:45] I think there's going to be elements of the game they nail.

[35:53] Look it's nothing's like just all that I think there's going to be a lot of elements of this game they nail.

[35:59] And I think there's going to be some elements they fail at executing in you know the best way.

[36:05] But here's what they're good here's what they're going to nail let me start with what they're going to nail.

[36:10] The game is is is they're going to nail with the theme and I know that's like a weird thing to say or how I'm saying it but.

[36:18] But they're just going to sell a gazillion of these things because of the theme so they nailed it on securing a good theme.

[36:24] The second thing this game is going to nail.

[36:27] Is the music and the sound and the atmosphere they're going to nail it like it is going to be insane and I'm here to confirm for you for everybody here.

[36:38] David feel has returned to Jersey Jack pinball to work on Harry Potter.

[36:45] So if you've ever played a David feel game.

[36:50] The man is the greatest musical composer for pinball and you have to understand what David feel brings to a game it's not just music right because this is going to have the license music from the Harry Potter movies.

[37:03] What he does is he creates all the he takes all that and then he adds and builds an entire pinball orchestration to go along with it.

[37:13] He also does all the sound effects and everything you hear from an audio standpoint is going to be David.

[37:20] So he is going to absolutely crush it his work on Pirates of the Caribbean his work on alien has like set the standard for the what a pinball machine can sound like so they're going to nail that.

[37:36] Jersey Jack is going to nail the lighting in the game what no wait I want to take that back I think they might fail I think they if they put the rainbow puke all over Harry Potter.

[37:49] And rainbow light shows like guns and roses it works Elton John it works but Godfather looks stupid if Harry Potter needs to be very warm sort of candle lit if you hear screaming downstairs it's because Irish rugby is six nations is happening right now and Ireland's playing France.

[38:10] If someone can give me a score update that be great I think they're going to nail like I think they're going to fail because I think they're going to just keep putting all these rainbow puke lights and modes and it for some reason Jersey Jack acts like they need to light up every game like a Christmas tree to get people's attention and I think they should let the theme dictate the mood of the lighting in the game.

[38:34] Okay, so I think they're going to fail at the lighting I think the artwork they're going to nail I do even a French is not doing it I think they're going to work with the studio and Harry Potter has so much great art out in the world I don't think they're I think they're going to nail it I think the game is going to be beautiful I think they're going to nail the top or another overall like aesthetic of the CE is going to be absolutely stunning they're going to have a you know Harry's wand is going to be.

[39:03] The shooter rod knob I think that's going to be cool okay here's where I think they're going to fail I think they're going to fail on toys I think they're going to fail on theme integration I really am worried that this game is going to have muted clips and that is going to be terrible.

[39:33] For fans of Harry Potter I'm also worried that the game is going to be more godfather like and not be like pirates of the Caribbean and when you think about Harry Potter it's a game that just demands magic and look at what that kid did with that homebrew game knowing that this is not a wide body knowing that it's a standard body knowing that there's going to be not as much room to be.

[40:03] I think they're going to put a lot of magical stuff I do here's what I think they're going to I think they're going to put this in the game I think Richie he's been over there since Eric's been working on this I really think this game needs something along the lines of the hyper drive from Star Wars.

[40:18] Something along those lines as when you're playing quidditch and you're flying through the air I really think they need to have something cool like that and be really fast and give that sensation of Harry on the you know on the broomstick sort of.

[40:32] Flying around I really do think that would be a super cool thing to have in the game it definitely needs to have magnets and using you know all the spells you cast it's going to be based on the first three movies that is what Harry Potter will be based on so that's good news is not too much content and those are those are the best ones anyway the charmingness of those first three movies is perfect for this.

[41:00] So but my overall feeling with the Jersey Jack games is they they lack soul and it's something that is really sometimes hard to describe and it's also something very personal for each and every one of us I just feel like their games sometime are over baked and over produced to a point where they become a little sterile and confusing.

[41:29] And but there's good news on this game it's not going to be Keith Johnson with joke hats leading the design code team on this and joke cats is games are shaping up to be probably the better coded games at J.J.P. Willy Wonka probably wonka is probably the best coded game at Jersey Jack will be the best coded game.

[41:58] And then you can get to it and remember people forget this wonka was out for like a good year year and a half before they adjusted the code to make it more approachable and until loud players to experience it because what good is it gang to let's use a metaphor to have a restaurant and your best five dishes.

[42:26] Nobody can get to an order right there you you only serve them upstairs but there's no there's no staircase there's no elevator there you keep hearing about all this cool stuff and they just make it too far to get to.

[42:43] So I think that's you know Jersey Jack games have been a lot like that for people there's a there they're very complex there they don't come at you as immediate as a stern machine and so but here's I say the same thing about predator as I do about Jersey Jack my expectations are that both companies will disappoint with these games but my dream is that they don't my dream is that they make an amazing game.

[43:11] I really am hoping that they make masterpieces on both of these games I hope I'm wrong I hope all of us that said fail are wrong I hope predator is amazing I hope Potter is amazing I know King Kong is going to be amazing King Kong is going to be great King Kong is going to I think King Kong is going to be L one's best I really do I think it's going to be his best and I love that stern pinball is basically Keith out of the way.

[43:41] He's like this is just a quick tune just confused form me would be like design in the West witches fall in and everybody else. How was going to be Minh

[44:04] like is really better than the other.

[44:06] I think we've only seen Jack getting started.

[44:09] I think that Foo Fighters is a better design

[44:11] than Iron Maiden.

[44:12] So think about that for many games.

[44:14] If Foo Fighters is a better design than Iron Maiden,

[44:18] and Foo Fighters is Jack's first pin, all right, Jack.

[44:22] I think Jack's inaugural pin is actually better

[44:24] than Keith Owens.

[44:26] And I just think he got a raw deal on X-Men.

[44:29] I think from a design standpoint,

[44:31] if X-Men had the, if it had the time, it needed.

[44:36] And didn't have a white synon code.

[44:39] Gosh, I just can't, you know, whatever it is, what it is.

[44:42] That layout is awesome.

[44:44] It's awesome.

[44:46] It is one of the most, it is the most, excuse me.

[44:51] You might coffee.

[44:52] It is the most creative layout I've ever seen Stern do.

[44:56] Name me a Stern layout that took more of a risk than X-Men.

[45:01] That is more creative from a layout standpoint.

[45:04] The fact that Stern Pimbal let him do something completely different.

[45:08] You know, and now what sucks is now,

[45:11] Stern's like, see, this is why we don't do stuff differently.

[45:13] But it is the most rad layout I've seen Stern do.

[45:17] I think it's the most creative layout I've ever seen.

[45:20] I think it's the most creative layout I've ever seen.

[45:24] I mean, if it were up to me, you know, I mean, I just like all the guys over at Stern.

[45:33] I was talking with Seth and George about stuff, you know, they're good guys.

[45:42] They really are good guys.

[45:44] And it's a privilege for me to be able to speak freely about that company

[45:53] to, at times, rant and rave about their products.

[45:58] And it's a privilege to be able to speak my mind

[46:03] and to be welcomed into that organization with open arms

[46:06] by the senior leadership of that organization.

[46:10] And George Gomez picking me up in his Porsche

[46:13] and giving me a private VIP tour of Stern Pimbal, right?

[46:19] I mean, it's a great guy, George.

[46:22] It's a great guy.

[46:23] You know who loves George Gomez?

[46:25] George Chloris, my father.

[46:27] My dad always says, I really like that George Gomez.

[46:29] And maybe it's just from one George to another.

[46:32] Like you have to like people with your same name.

[46:34] But my dad's a really good judge a character.

[46:37] And whenever I would interview George Gomez,

[46:39] my dad would always say that, that man has a good head on his shoulders.

[46:42] And you know, my dad didn't M&A.

[46:44] So he would always look to see who was leading a company

[46:48] whenever he would purchase them for his company.

[46:52] And when you do M&A and you're looking for a potential merger,

[46:56] understanding the leadership and people's,

[47:00] you know, are they the real deal

[47:01] or are they just like smoke and mirrors?

[47:02] Are they just, you know, are they going to fizzle out?

[47:06] Are they going to deliver?

[47:08] And you know, so George, my papa George loves Papa George

[47:14] over at Stern Pimbal.

[47:16] That being said, Ireland's getting slaughtered.

[47:20] Oh, man.

[47:23] I just think, I think I want to talk now about Barrel's a fun.

[47:29] And I had a really good phone call

[47:33] with another awesome dude in Pimbal.

[47:34] You might know him as Mr. David Van S, founder,

[47:39] a co-owner of a company called Barrel's a Fun.

[47:46] A company whose name we made fun of

[47:50] that we've all now grown to accept.

[47:52] But David called me and he said, Chris,

[47:57] this is news for everybody.

[47:58] So if you're, first of all,

[48:01] we only have 210 stars.

[48:02] Come on guys, where's the stars?

[48:04] Where's the stars?

[48:06] We, he said, Chris, we're very, very close.

[48:10] And we definitely want to have you come down.

[48:13] The plan is to have media and content creators

[48:20] and distributors and dealers travel to Barrel's a fun

[48:27] under NDA for that one day.

[48:30] So here's how it's gonna go.

[48:33] They will have shot all their release videos

[48:36] and their trailers and everything.

[48:38] And they want us to come in on a day,

[48:42] see everything, meet the people,

[48:45] play the game in the right environment

[48:47] and they want to give all of us a day

[48:50] to write our stories,

[48:53] to do our podcasts,

[48:55] to interview the team that worked on the game,

[48:58] like get everything done in a day,

[49:00] go out to dinner,

[49:03] and then the next day they will reveal the game.

[49:05] And everyone's coverage can hit at the same time.

[49:10] It's called in bargoed coverage.

[49:13] It's very normal.

[49:14] It's how you professionally do stuff

[49:17] in normal industries.

[49:19] It hasn't really been done in Pimbalm much.

[49:22] And so I'm looking forward to possibly making

[49:27] that journey down there.

[49:29] Hopefully it's on a Friday.

[49:30] I told them a Friday would be ideal.

[49:33] And I think he should invite everybody

[49:37] who makes good Pimbal content.

[49:39] I even said, hey, I even said to him,

[49:42] you should do naps arcade, right?

[49:46] Straight down the middle,

[49:48] you should get the folks over there,

[49:50] Joel and team over there, Zach and Greg.

[49:55] You know, I said,

[49:56] Don's Pimbal podcast, loser kid Pimbal podcast,

[50:01] Kerry Hardy, Todd Tucky would be fun.

[50:04] Now I don't know if they're gonna pay for all of us to go.

[50:07] The way Jersey Jack did.

[50:09] Last time Stern invited people,

[50:11] it was people had to pay.

[50:14] So it's a smart way to do it.

[50:19] I have to say though,

[50:21] I'm talking to David and he won't give me the theme.

[50:26] I'm still worried that they're,

[50:30] with all the goonies stuff lying around the office

[50:34] and it might not be goonies.

[50:36] It might be doon or GI Joe or whatever.

[50:38] I think it might just be something completely.

[50:39] I think it's gonna be doon.

[50:41] I mean, if I had it,

[50:42] if you put a gun on my head and Chris,

[50:44] you've been saying all these things,

[50:46] but what do you,

[50:47] what do you just, on a practical level,

[50:50] what do you think it's gonna be?

[50:51] I think it's gonna be do.

[50:53] Just because the sources and from the people I've heard,

[50:56] that's the one that keeps getting mentioned the most.

[51:00] And if it is doon,

[51:01] I think it's gonna be the David Lynch doon movie.

[51:04] And that's what it's gonna be.

[51:06] Now, the thing with David and my friends at barrels,

[51:11] is every time I talk to them,

[51:14] I never get this sense like they are so excited

[51:20] to get this game out.

[51:22] I mean, I don't know, I read,

[51:25] and maybe they're just sandbagging it on purpose

[51:28] and maybe that's their strategy,

[51:30] but I just don't get the sense like,

[51:35] they know they've got a banger,

[51:37] and this is a theme that everyone's gonna want,

[51:38] and they can't wait to bring it to market.

[51:40] I think it might be another divisive theme like LaBrent was.

[51:46] Hold on a second, my videos pause, hold on.

[51:54] What's the score?

[51:56] 13, 13, what score is wrong?

[52:00] 32 to 13.

[52:03] It's embarrassing.

[52:05] I married you for your rugby.

[52:08] Now we,

[52:11] oh, can I say by the way,

[52:14] thank you to everybody that has reminded me

[52:21] that Brenda is amazing, and they're like,

[52:22] you know Chris, your wife is incredible.

[52:25] She's the only one with common sense,

[52:27] talking sense into you.

[52:29] I'm glad that people got to see just 10 minutes

[52:32] of how amazing Brenda is.

[52:33] I get to live with her for 10 years,

[52:36] and she is a diamond.

[52:38] She is an Irish rose.

[52:40] She is amazing.

[52:42] And she's hot.

[52:43] I love it.

[52:43] I love just having such a beautiful wife,

[52:45] but I also think she's hot.

[52:47] So she might hear me.

[52:49] She could excite it.

[52:52] Can you hear me?

[52:53] I think so.

[52:56] It changes everything.

[52:57] When you have such a beautiful smart wife,

[52:58] it's like, I don't need pinball machines

[53:01] to feel satisfied on any level.

[53:04] So look, I just, I don't know, I'm excited.

[53:07] I'm gonna go down there.

[53:10] Hopefully I'll be able to go down there.

[53:12] And I want to see what they got.

[53:16] Here's what's gonna be interesting,

[53:17] is this game's coming out.

[53:20] He said it could be just a matter of days.

[53:23] He was like, Chris, can you come down next week?

[53:25] I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there.

[53:29] Some other good news about this game

[53:32] is they're not revealing this game

[53:36] until they already have them in boxes,

[53:39] much just like Labyrinth.

[53:41] David Van S is strategy is I never wanna release a game

[53:44] that isn't going to customers the same day.

[53:47] Love that.

[53:48] Love that.

[53:51] He said they can do six a day when they're up and running,

[53:54] and that's what they're gonna be doing

[53:56] when the game is being produced.

[53:58] So that's not bad, 30, 30 a week.

[54:04] So 120 a month, you know,

[54:10] make it through like a thousand in a year.

[54:12] Perfect, perfect, perfect.

[54:16] So I'm excited and it's gonna be in front of

[54:22] everything else about to hit.

[54:24] See, this is where like David also knows,

[54:27] David's like, I don't wanna release it until it's ready to,

[54:28] like, okay, I was like, bro, yeah.

[54:30] But I also think David knows he needs to get this game out.

[54:33] He needs to get out in front of Kong and Potter and Predator.

[54:37] He needs to, especially if it's Dune

[54:41] and it's not a banger like Goonies,

[54:43] he knows he needs to get orders on this game.

[54:47] I think a lot of people on here

[54:51] are gonna have to make some tough decisions.

[54:54] And I think there's gonna be,

[54:56] I think there's tough decisions of,

[54:58] here's what everyone's thinking,

[54:59] because we're not all Billy B,

[55:01] Billy Brand is what's up brother.

[55:02] You know, we can't, we don't have the cash flow like Bill

[55:06] or Neil McCray.

[55:07] I think a lot of people are gonna have to make a decision.

[55:12] How do I free up room in my game room?

[55:14] Because even Bill has like room issues.

[55:17] How do I free up space?

[55:18] What game do I wanna like go?

[55:20] And do I wanna lose

[55:24] how much money do I wanna lose on this game?

[55:26] Now for a lot of people out there,

[55:27] you're not gonna lose on most of your collection

[55:29] because most of your collection you bought when prices were good

[55:32] and you're not getting less than what you used to buy those games for.

[55:35] In a way, the insane prices now

[55:39] have sort of solidified the value of those older games

[55:44] because those games are half the price almost.

[55:48] And then you gotta decide,

[55:50] do I buy one of these new games right away?

[55:54] And if you're a smart person, you're gonna wait it out

[55:57] because anyone who's watched the pinball market

[56:00] over the last three years has witnessed

[56:03] that 90% of games bought right away

[56:08] have lost 30% of value in the first year.

[56:13] And additional to that,

[56:16] none of them other than a Keith L. Win game

[56:18] have been difficult to get.

[56:21] There's only 500 Alice's adventures in Wonderland

[56:24] and there are two spots for sale

[56:26] that haven't, they're just sitting there for sale,

[56:29] which means there's not even two people

[56:31] on the wait list to get one.

[56:32] Think about that.

[56:34] There's not even two more people in the world who want one

[56:37] right now.

[56:38] That's not good.

[56:40] You always wanna make one less than the demand

[56:43] and have a little demand waiting.

[56:45] So I think that a lot of people are gonna be excited

[56:50] that there's seven new games being revealed

[56:53] over the next eight weeks.

[56:55] I also think a lot of people are gonna be,

[56:59] some, the smart people are gonna wait and see,

[57:02] I think the, I think Fools will rush in

[57:06] and I think some people who financially shouldn't be,

[57:10] you know there's people ganging in this hobby.

[57:13] And look, you can do what you want with your money.

[57:15] But there's people in this hobby who buy pinball machines

[57:17] using credit cards.

[57:19] Like they buy a pin on a credit card

[57:21] and pay interest on pinball payments.

[57:27] Every, I mean, you might, look,

[57:30] if you buy it because you want the points,

[57:32] that's one thing.

[57:33] But I mean, there's people that,

[57:34] they have credit card debt

[57:36] and they put a pinball machine on top of that debt

[57:39] and they don't make enough every month

[57:41] to pay off their credit card bill every month.

[57:45] I have a credit card.

[57:47] Every month I pay it off completely.

[57:51] I just do it for the miles and for the points.

[57:54] So I think seven games, right?

[57:56] It's like, how does this hobby absorb so many titles?

[58:00] The, here's where I think, here's what's funny,

[58:03] is L wins at the end of those seven games.

[58:08] See, I'd be, I would just wait for the L win,

[58:11] one before you make any,

[58:14] any decision.

[58:17] Potter is gonna sell out.

[58:19] Now, a lot of people, you know,

[58:21] I can hear that you're being a hypocrite,

[58:22] you say, wait and see it.

[58:23] But I'll say it and I'll say it again.

[58:25] The only two games you're gonna need to buy right away

[58:29] if you don't wanna pay more is King Kong Ellie

[58:32] and Harry Potter CE.

[58:36] Okay, so you understand, when I say wait and see,

[58:39] it doesn't apply to every single game.

[58:43] It applies to 90% of the games.

[58:47] So that is, and for those who take my advice,

[58:51] I keep telling people, just buy a Harry Potter CE,

[58:54] even if you don't want it.

[58:58] It's bad if you don't want it.

[59:00] And then sell it for more than you bought it for.

[59:03] I'm telling you right now that flipping a game for profit

[59:07] is not dead, it's just dead on 90% of games.

[59:10] Now, I don't think you're gonna be able to flip

[59:12] King Kong for a lot more.

[59:14] I think Harry Potter is gonna bring in more people.

[59:17] Now, Pokemon is after King Kong.

[59:22] So that's gonna stabilize the prices on Potter and Kong

[59:26] because I'm telling you right now,

[59:28] Pokemon is coming out after King Kong.

[59:34] And if I'm wrong, I won't lose any subscribers over it.

[59:39] Everybody wanna thank you guys for being members

[59:41] of the Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[59:42] In the month we've lost a little,

[59:44] we dipped a little bit below 700 subscribers.

[59:47] Let's look at the latest numbers right now.

[59:49] I think it was like 688.

[59:52] Let's see, where are we at here?

[59:53] 688, yeah.

[59:58] We lost about, I think the height of my show,

[01:00:03] when there was more news and we were doing more interviews

[01:00:05] and everything, it was like 740.

[01:00:07] So it's okay, I'm happy.

[01:00:10] Because you know what number matters more than the 688?

[01:00:14] The number that matters more is how much money

[01:00:17] is Canadian making every month and it's good.

[01:00:19] I'm happy with the money I make.

[01:00:22] It is, it's not making me rich.

[01:00:25] I think it's the right amount for the effort I put in.

[01:00:29] Should I make a little bit more probably?

[01:00:32] But some people get mad, this guy called him out

[01:00:36] on my last show.

[01:00:37] He's like, you need to stop.

[01:00:40] You need to stop asking people to raise their donation

[01:00:44] amount from $5 to more.

[01:00:47] And it was because of my post about galactic tank force

[01:00:51] where I was like, these dudes who are friends of mine,

[01:00:56] who only, you know, who give $5 a month,

[01:00:59] who don't take my advice.

[01:01:00] These dudes just lost $7,500 that my friends

[01:01:04] who bought galactic tank force signature edition.

[01:01:07] And it's just funny to me because it's like,

[01:01:12] you never once, you know, raised your amount.

[01:01:16] And the guy who's been giving you advice

[01:01:18] would have saved you $7,500.

[01:01:20] I mean, I was all, I was, I was dogging on GTF when it came out.

[01:01:26] What's up, blip Stevens.

[01:01:30] But no, I mean, when you have a show

[01:01:33] and it's your, it's your content, you can do what you want.

[01:01:35] I'm not forcing anybody to sign up.

[01:01:39] There's no gun to anybody's head.

[01:01:41] If you want to listen to what I believe is the most

[01:01:44] entertaining weekly pinball podcast that covers off

[01:01:48] on everything that's happened in the pinball world,

[01:01:51] a pinball podcaster that doesn't copy anybody,

[01:01:55] a pinball podcaster that has original thoughts

[01:01:59] that are not fake.

[01:02:01] I don't chill for any company.

[01:02:04] I don't tell you how I feel about a game on my show

[01:02:09] and then private message people how I really feel about the game.

[01:02:13] I don't get kickbacks from distributors or dealers.

[01:02:17] I don't pretend to buy a game that I didn't pay full price for

[01:02:22] and then pretend like, you know what I'm saying?

[01:02:26] I just give you the authentic opinions of me.

[01:02:33] And they're just opinions, right?

[01:02:34] My opinions carry no more weight than anybody else's.

[01:02:37] This is everything about this hobby subjective.

[01:02:40] But I do think, and when you look at the current state

[01:02:44] of pinball content, it's a, it's skews very salesy.

[01:02:50] And that's fine.

[01:02:52] It's fine, right?

[01:02:53] It's like, because a lot of the content,

[01:02:56] it's at a production level and a personality level.

[01:03:01] The pinball content that's out there now

[01:03:02] is better than it's ever been.

[01:03:04] But the butt is just, there's not a lot of counterpoint happening.

[01:03:11] And there's just a lot of, it's almost like people

[01:03:16] are like extensions of these pinball companies sales

[01:03:24] and marketing teams.

[01:03:26] And I get it.

[01:03:27] You got to decide, do you want your friends to be the manufacturers

[01:03:30] and the people that work there?

[01:03:32] Or do you want your friends to be the community?

[01:03:35] And you look, you can have both.

[01:03:36] Absolutely.

[01:03:37] Most people have both.

[01:03:39] I just decided long ago that I didn't want my relationships

[01:03:45] with manufacturers to prohibit me

[01:03:48] from sharing how I really feel.

[01:03:49] And look, do we all use words that are probably way too negative

[01:03:57] and hyperbolic and strident?

[01:03:59] Of course.

[01:04:01] Like no pinball machine is terrible.

[01:04:04] That's not true.

[01:04:05] But here goes barbecue challenge.

[01:04:06] Abba.

[01:04:09] But we live in a world now where you know,

[01:04:11] you can't say something sucks.

[01:04:13] You can't hate something and hate is a strong word.

[01:04:15] I mean, you shouldn't use hate.

[01:04:17] But there is a, there's like this weird push

[01:04:23] that you're not allowed to just be negative.

[01:04:28] Why not?

[01:04:29] If you're feeling negative about something,

[01:04:33] why not air it out?

[01:04:34] Now look, giving constructive feedback is what you need to do.

[01:04:38] Because if you're just like a jerk and an A-hole,

[01:04:41] me won't be very interesting to listen to.

[01:04:44] And I think what I love about how people come at my show

[01:04:48] and my opinions about pinball is simply this.

[01:04:55] A lot of people don't listen to my show.

[01:04:57] So when they say he only talks like about like he,

[01:05:00] they don't listen.

[01:05:00] They don't listen.

[01:05:02] John, oh my God, this again.

[01:05:04] Oh, John, who's keeping you here?

[01:05:06] Nobody.

[01:05:07] Nobody, John.

[01:05:09] You know, I just want to say something, John.

[01:05:10] Like it's the people who come hang out here

[01:05:14] and then complain if I want to just talk

[01:05:16] about what I want to talk about or talk about.

[01:05:19] John, you know, I never understand.

[01:05:21] Here's what I don't do.

[01:05:23] I don't go hang out on anyone's pages

[01:05:27] and be like, oh, here we go again.

[01:05:29] He's talking about life or he's giving advice to go to the gym

[01:05:33] and you know, he mentioned that, you know,

[01:05:37] that Democrats should have clapped for a kid with cancer.

[01:05:41] Oh, here we go again.

[01:05:43] Just stick to pinball.

[01:05:44] Canada, be the pinball puppet we want you to be.

[01:05:47] You're not allowed to just deviate from the script.

[01:05:51] John, John, just hoping to listen to something fresh and new.

[01:05:58] Well, this is fresh and new, John,

[01:06:00] because other people don't talk like this in this hobby.

[01:06:03] That's why we have the most subscribers,

[01:06:05] more subscribers and everybody combined

[01:06:07] in the pinball content space.

[01:06:10] But we're going south.

[01:06:12] It's good.

[01:06:12] We're losing subscribers.

[01:06:13] It's okay.

[01:06:14] We'll let some people go.

[01:06:15] The numbers are still good.

[01:06:16] The monetary amount hasn't changed.

[01:06:19] If you're done with those things then,

[01:06:20] I'll leave.

[01:06:21] John, just leave now.

[01:06:23] John, I'm going to stop.

[01:06:24] Just go now.

[01:06:25] All right, John, I'm done with those things.

[01:06:26] Go leave now, John.

[01:06:27] I'm not going to talk about any more pinball

[01:06:28] for the next 24 minutes.

[01:06:31] I am, but like, let's see if John will really leave.

[01:06:35] It's really strange for a grown man

[01:06:37] to get on someone's Facebook channel.

[01:06:39] I'm going to leave now if you're done.

[01:06:42] John, John, brother, what do you want to talk about, John?

[01:06:49] He's still here.

[01:06:50] He's still here.

[01:06:53] Here's what I think is going to win

[01:06:55] in these seven games over eight weeks.

[01:06:59] Here's what I think.

[01:07:00] And by the way, guys, it's not John from Jack Bar, by the way.

[01:07:03] It's not.

[01:07:03] It's John Tom Berlin, I think.

[01:07:06] Tom Berlin.

[01:07:07] John, what's up, brother?

[01:07:10] Here's the thing.

[01:07:11] I think it's going to go.

[01:07:13] Here's my order.

[01:07:14] If I had to pick all these games,

[01:07:15] what's going to be best?

[01:07:16] What's going to be this?

[01:07:19] I think King Kong is going to be the best game.

[01:07:23] All right, my son is dying laughing at you, John.

[01:07:27] Here's, you know what, John?

[01:07:28] You know what's funny?

[01:07:30] Now, Johnny, you're gone.

[01:07:36] Oh, let's do this.

[01:07:41] All right, John.

[01:07:46] Kong is going to win.

[01:07:49] Then I think, trying to think about the games.

[01:07:54] I think it's going to go Kong Potter.

[01:07:56] You know, like, it's going to, it's going to,

[01:07:57] Potter's going to be, you know, it's going to go Kong,

[01:08:01] Potter, barrels.

[01:08:09] And then predator in terms of like the new games.

[01:08:12] Right?

[01:08:13] Because there's like, you know,

[01:08:14] it's going to go Kong, Potter, barrels.

[01:08:21] And then predator in terms of like the new games.

[01:08:24] Like, you know, because those,

[01:08:25] that's four games right there.

[01:08:26] But it's going to go Kong, Potter, barrels, predator.

[01:08:29] And then we've got Alice, his adventures in Wonderland.

[01:08:33] I don't know if you saw the,

[01:08:36] I don't know if you saw the, that just made me laugh.

[01:08:39] John was the Twippy Vogue Difference.

[01:08:41] I don't know.

[01:08:43] I didn't get his son's vote.

[01:08:44] His son's laughing at me.

[01:08:45] Oh, no, man, someone's son's laughing.

[01:08:49] The, the thing is like,

[01:08:54] Alice is almost ready to go out the door.

[01:08:57] Will Stern do Pokemon and what?

[01:08:59] Yes, Nick, where are you guys?

[01:09:01] I, I, I, Stern's doing Pokemon.

[01:09:04] Uh, I think Pokemon is the biggest IP in the world

[01:09:07] from an entertainment standpoint,

[01:09:09] because it is.

[01:09:11] I, I don't mind Pokemon.

[01:09:14] I mean, I love Japanese culture.

[01:09:16] I love Japanese like cartoons and anime.

[01:09:18] I think Pokemon could be really fun.

[01:09:21] And I think we need a game like Pokemon.

[01:09:23] Here's what excites me about Pokemon is,

[01:09:25] I feel like Pokemon is like the perfect game for a guy like me,

[01:09:28] because I love all Japanese stuff like that.

[01:09:32] And I, I'm not like into Pokemon, into it, into it.

[01:09:35] But I could get into it and probably really enjoy it.

[01:09:39] Also like with two little boys,

[01:09:41] to me, it's like, that's a dream thing,

[01:09:43] because my kids can get into Pokemon when they're young.

[01:09:47] And then there's a pinball machine in the house,

[01:09:50] that's perfect for them to enjoy.

[01:09:52] You know, like they're not gonna feel that way about guns or roses,

[01:09:54] or jaws, or evil dead, or, you know, not even Harry Potter,

[01:09:58] because Pokemon will get them younger.

[01:10:00] So I think Pokemon is a perfect pin for the family.

[01:10:04] I think it's gonna sell more than Star Wars.

[01:10:07] Maybe, maybe not, probably not.

[01:10:09] It'll sell really well.

[01:10:11] So yeah, I mean, it's the number one IP in the world.

[01:10:14] It's, it's much bigger than Star Wars.

[01:10:16] It's, I think it's three or four times bigger than Star Wars.

[01:10:19] So, if you were to ask me, what do I think?

[01:10:22] Yeah, I think it's a home run for Stern.

[01:10:25] I think Stern knows they have it.

[01:10:27] I think Stern will absorb these John Wick losses

[01:10:30] and these, you know, X-Men losses.

[01:10:32] And I think they know they're gonna make so much money on Pokemon.

[01:10:35] And not only that, they know they're gonna sell Pokemon for years.

[01:10:41] So I think it's a great, I think it's a great get for Stern Pinball.

[01:10:46] So absolutely, absolutely.

[01:10:54] Johnny, you still with us?

[01:10:55] Did we lose you?

[01:10:57] Did we lose you?

[01:11:00] Oh, man.

[01:11:02] You know, I'll say it here.

[01:11:03] I'll say it here.

[01:11:05] And I said it on my show, but I just want to let you guys know.

[01:11:08] Hey, yeah, because we live in a world too.

[01:11:09] We're like, you can't say anything.

[01:11:11] You know me, I'm very moderate.

[01:11:12] I'm a moderate guy.

[01:11:14] I'm a very competitive, socially liberal.

[01:11:16] But my social liberalism, liberalism, it also, you know,

[01:11:21] I don't, the far left to me is crazy.

[01:11:23] It's just, it's crazy.

[01:11:24] Like they, they, they've basically torpedoed their ability to win elections.

[01:11:28] But my whole point was is it is possible not to like Donald Trump

[01:11:34] and still stand up and clap for an eight year old boy that survived brain cancer.

[01:11:41] And you know, I, I talked about this on my show because I did,

[01:11:45] I noticed something in that moment that made me really disappointed in everybody in politics.

[01:11:50] Because I don't like politicians at all.

[01:11:53] But I noticed something about culture that is really crazy to me.

[01:11:56] We all need to have a point by which humanity takes over.

[01:12:02] And decency takes over.

[01:12:04] And you can't, and it shouldn't be a political decision.

[01:12:07] It should be a human decision.

[01:12:10] Like it should be like a carnal decision to make when a child,

[01:12:15] because, because you have no heart.

[01:12:17] If you can't put politics aside to appreciate a young boy and the suffering he's gone through

[01:12:26] and the challenges he's overcome to be in that room with you there today.

[01:12:30] And once you make a move like that, and this is just me talking as a marketer,

[01:12:35] when you make a move like that, they are going to regret that moment for years to come as a party.

[01:12:42] And again, I, I happily, you know, enjoyed the Clinton administration,

[01:12:48] the Obama administration, it's not politics.

[01:12:51] I just think you've got to find a way if you're on that side of that room to, to reevaluate.

[01:12:58] And, and I have a lot of friends that are die hard Democrats.

[01:13:02] I have a lot of friends that are Republican.

[01:13:04] Everybody, right? We're all just people.

[01:13:05] We're all, but that's the thing is like we're all just people.

[01:13:07] And it's funny too, because when you talk like this, feel you're not allowed to talk like this,

[01:13:10] because this is a thing about pinball.

[01:13:12] I'm sorry, but the world is going on, right?

[01:13:15] And when you think about what's going on in the world, it's impossible not to talk about what's happening politically

[01:13:20] and connect it to pinball because there's one word that should make everybody worried.

[01:13:26] Teriffs.

[01:13:28] And if you've seen the threads, everyone's got like a different understanding of what tariffs are.

[01:13:34] It's kind of funny to me.

[01:13:35] How can something that's so like cut and dry?

[01:13:39] How can something so cut and dry be so have so many different interpretations?

[01:13:46] But like the thing is, if they start to put tariffs on products coming from other countries

[01:13:53] and parts coming from other countries, I love this bucket heads like doing like non-shocks in the middle of a Guns of Roses show

[01:13:59] and like robot dancing.

[01:14:02] What's that going to do to pinball?

[01:14:05] And I think like the consequences of this could be crazy.

[01:14:11] Now look, everyone in Europe is like, why are you complaining America?

[01:14:14] This is what we always deal with, right?

[01:14:16] They're right. Everyone in Australia is like, why are you complaining?

[01:14:20] This is what we always put up with, same thing with Canada.

[01:14:24] I'm just saying, you know, Americans are, we're an interesting group of people.

[01:14:29] Like we want our gas to be $2 a gallon.

[01:14:32] We want to pay nothing for everything.

[01:14:35] And you know, we don't care what the rest of the world has to pay.

[01:14:39] So I think what is going to happen is the tariffs and the taxes on these games.

[01:14:48] It's weird. I don't think the companies can really raise prices.

[01:14:52] I think they raised prices so much and we've been getting hosed for the last three years.

[01:14:59] That they know, like they know, like if a manufacturer wants to take prices further north after what they're at now,

[01:15:09] you're going to just see a lot more of us just stop buying.

[01:15:13] And it's because it's not just pinball gang, it's everything.

[01:15:18] It's everything. Cars, gas, a dozen eggs.

[01:15:23] It's going out to eat.

[01:15:25] You step out in the world today and you know inflation is high and things cost a lot of money.

[01:15:30] Right. So then you set to decide.

[01:15:32] I actually love the way the world is kind of going right now.

[01:15:34] I do. I'm very optimistic about it because I love the way the world is going.

[01:15:38] Because the world is going to make everybody.

[01:15:42] It doesn't matter who you are. Richard Paul.

[01:15:44] It's going to make everybody reprioritize what's important in life.

[01:15:51] And it's not a political party thing.

[01:15:54] It's just this is the world now.

[01:15:57] Okay. Doesn't matter what you think you're entitled to.

[01:16:00] Doesn't matter what country you're born into.

[01:16:02] It doesn't matter what your national.

[01:16:04] You need to figure out what's important to you.

[01:16:08] What do you need to be happy?

[01:16:12] Is it a pinball machine?

[01:16:13] Is it ten pinball machines?

[01:16:15] Is it buying every new inbox game?

[01:16:17] You know, where does your happiness lie?

[01:16:20] See, for and for each of us, it's all personal.

[01:16:22] It's hyper personal.

[01:16:25] And I think a lot of people that were used to flying around all the time,

[01:16:29] going on vacations all the time, eating out all the time, buying this,

[01:16:32] you know, the 80% of your clothes you haven't worn in a year,

[01:16:35] like a lot of us are going to hit the brakes and basically say,

[01:16:41] all right, I'm done.

[01:16:44] So there is UV coding on my windows, kid Chris.

[01:16:49] You know what that is?

[01:16:50] It's a film that you put on a window.

[01:16:54] So the sun's UV rays, 99% of the UV is blocked

[01:17:00] from going through that window.

[01:17:02] So there is not going to be art fade on this Guns and Roses, ebber.

[01:17:07] Okay.

[01:17:08] Also the rad cows, I feel like, would fade much less too,

[01:17:11] because they're so, they're so, they're so plastic.

[01:17:16] No, I think it's going to be crazy, right?

[01:17:18] I think, I think people, but I love that everyone's sort of like waking up a little bit.

[01:17:23] Right? Everybody's waking up to it.

[01:17:25] People are waking up to the reality of how harmful cell phones and so on.

[01:17:29] What do you think of the cell phones and social media have been?

[01:17:33] The trends I'm seeing now with Gen Z and Gen Alpha, you know what they want?

[01:17:36] They want to digitally detox.

[01:17:39] See, all of us here today, all of us here today,

[01:17:42] we all grew up with one foot in and one foot out of the internet,

[01:17:47] of social media, of a world in which nobody now can really pay attention.

[01:17:55] They've distracted constantly with, with so much going on.

[01:18:00] Imagine going to work.

[01:18:01] I think about this all the time.

[01:18:02] My dad used to go to work and there was no email.

[01:18:06] There was no internet, half of his career.

[01:18:11] And it's, he writes, it's like, how did anybody get anything done?

[01:18:13] And guess what they did do? They did get it done.

[01:18:17] The best of times were those times, the 80s, early 90s,

[01:18:21] all before, like really, we used any internet.

[01:18:24] The 70s and 80s, like coming out of like, you know,

[01:18:27] that period of oil crisis and into like one of the greatest,

[01:18:30] probably the greatest decade in the history of America.

[01:18:32] 1989 is the greatest year in the history of the world.

[01:18:37] Greatest year in the history of the world.

[01:18:39] 1989, because there was no other time in the history of humanity

[01:18:45] where we had optimism, optimism.

[01:18:49] The fall of the Soviet Empire, the Berlin Wall came down.

[01:18:54] We had Gorbachev and Reagan signing a piece deal.

[01:18:58] The Cold War was over.

[01:19:00] MTV had made its way into the, you know, past the Iron Curtain.

[01:19:05] It is like the optimism of the world.

[01:19:08] It was incredible.

[01:19:10] And then the 90s were great.

[01:19:13] They were great.

[01:19:14] But then we got destroyed by devices and technology.

[01:19:18] And social media has like destroyed a generation's happiness.

[01:19:23] Remember when we were on Facebook,

[01:19:25] and remember when we used to just go on Facebook and actually like,

[01:19:28] be excited to find our friends and we talked, like we just,

[01:19:31] shout it and now look at Facebook.

[01:19:33] It's, I keep thinking about this too.

[01:19:36] We've been gaslit all these years.

[01:19:38] Remember when Facebook was just you, your friends,

[01:19:40] and where you were recationing, what you were eating,

[01:19:43] and what your new car was.

[01:19:45] Look at your feed now on Facebook.

[01:19:48] Look at the feed.

[01:19:49] It is 98% of it is in anything that you even signed up for.

[01:19:56] You're just getting bummed barred it with so much.

[01:19:59] And imagine being a kid.

[01:20:01] And you're a kid.

[01:20:02] And that's coming at you every day.

[01:20:05] And we used to go to a concert.

[01:20:06] I'm looking at this G&R concert.

[01:20:08] My first concert, one of my first, I think it was my second.

[01:20:11] But Math and Square Garden 1991, Guns and Roses.

[01:20:15] There was no cell phones.

[01:20:17] Nobody knew what time they were going on stage.

[01:20:19] Nobody.

[01:20:20] Like you just went there and you know it was great.

[01:20:22] I was a little 13 year old boy.

[01:20:24] And there was a two and a half hour gap between sound garden and Guns and Roses.

[01:20:29] And you know what was happening during those two and a half hours?

[01:20:33] They would, they would, they would move the camera around the crowd.

[01:20:38] And, and hot women.

[01:20:41] Can I say hot chicks?

[01:20:43] Hot women would flash the camera.

[01:20:46] You know flash the camera.

[01:20:48] I'm a 13 year old boy who, who, who knows what he's seeing.

[01:20:52] And, and they would cheer.

[01:20:54] You know, every, but the women like, would love it.

[01:20:57] And they wanted to get on the big screen by flashing the camera.

[01:21:01] And there was no cell phones.

[01:21:04] There was no, you know, capturing that, sharing that with her company the next day,

[01:21:09] getting her fire.

[01:21:10] There was no shame that this is going to end up somewhere else.

[01:21:13] Everyone was just there.

[01:21:15] And, and it's like energy just growing and growing in that arena for two and a half hours.

[01:21:22] You know, everyone's just like drinking and smoking weed.

[01:21:26] Not me. I was 13.

[01:21:28] And so it was like the pressure of when is actual going to take the stage.

[01:21:33] And then all of a sudden, the lights go down.

[01:21:36] And it's like, and I'll never forget how he came out.

[01:21:39] He didn't come out with welcome to the jungle.

[01:21:42] He came out wearing red spandex.

[01:21:45] No shirt.

[01:21:46] A red blazer.

[01:21:48] Red bandana.

[01:21:49] And he comes out to perfect crime.

[01:21:53] He's like, mother, it's a perfect crime.

[01:21:56] Goddamn it. It's a perfect crime.

[01:21:58] And he's just like, he's just running around like a madman.

[01:22:01] The volume is through the roof.

[01:22:03] And you're just like, it's like this powder keg went off and axel and slash and duff.

[01:22:08] It was just like unreal.

[01:22:11] And that is why I own guns and roses because those memories are forged inside me.

[01:22:17] And I feel bad for kids today.

[01:22:20] You know, there's this, there's this picture of Lala pollution.

[01:22:24] I think it was Lala pollution or.

[01:22:27] No, it was like, what's that?

[01:22:30] What's that?

[01:22:31] What's that festival in Europe somewhere on a beach or something?

[01:22:34] Anyway, like they had a picture of it when it first launched.

[01:22:37] And everyone was just there, hands up, enjoying the show.

[01:22:41] And then they showed a picture of the crowded and everyone just holding a cell phone up like this.

[01:22:45] Everybody.

[01:22:46] Nobody's nobody's in it.

[01:22:48] Nobody's just like just in that moment.

[01:22:51] I don't know.

[01:22:52] We're all filled with these moments, right?

[01:22:54] And it's like, it's beautiful.

[01:22:55] And I love that I'm seeing a trend now by these kids now want to turn off.

[01:23:03] They, they, we all failed them.

[01:23:05] I mean, the society, culture, governments, that we all failed them.

[01:23:09] We, we didn't regulate something that was so very harmful to all of them.

[01:23:14] And we just handed them phones.

[01:23:15] We handed them screens.

[01:23:16] We handed them content.

[01:23:17] We handed them, you know, deplorable stuff to see.

[01:23:21] We, we, and we didn't think through the consequences.

[01:23:24] I know this is a little off-toppy people, but I just love talking.

[01:23:27] Like, we didn't think through the consequences.

[01:23:29] What are we going to do to a generation of people if we put this in their pocket every day?

[01:23:37] What's going to happen to a generation of people if this is what they think intimacy looks like?

[01:23:45] What's going to happen?

[01:23:47] You know, you're going to, you're going to, you're going to, you're going to have a generation

[01:23:50] that's lonely, that's isolated, and messed up here because they're living in their heads.

[01:23:54] They're not living out in that world.

[01:23:56] So, you know, I love about pinball to bring it back.

[01:23:59] And I love, you know, what this hobby's brought all of us is, is, is we're a generation built for community.

[01:24:08] And we thrive on that.

[01:24:09] And we're used to that.

[01:24:11] And even though we connect now using the technology, I think most of you, this is, and, and to me, I agree.

[01:24:19] Like, this to me is a normal way to healthfully, in a healthy way, healthfully, in a healthy way, connect with people.

[01:24:28] And it is. There's no ads popping up. There's no other stuff.

[01:24:31] It's just, we're just talking about a topic. We talk about some other stuff.

[01:24:34] But I think it's normal.

[01:24:36] Like, because it, to me, this is just like radio or like video vlogging.

[01:24:40] Like, this, this was like, this is all we needed.

[01:24:43] We didn't need everything else.

[01:24:45] You needed a camera, a phone call, and, you know, the ability to see each other.

[01:24:51] My glasses just changed color. That was cool.

[01:24:53] How did that work?

[01:24:54] Um, but yeah, I think it's going to swing back.

[01:24:58] And I am very optimistic about the world. I am as much as people want to say the world's burning.

[01:25:02] I think the media just wants to make money off of that.

[01:25:05] I do.

[01:25:06] Um, I will say I did love that.

[01:25:10] I did, I did love that Trump cut the funding for Columbia.

[01:25:13] I, you want $400 million from the federal government? Well, maybe, maybe, maybe don't, you know, maybe don't say you hate the country and just support students who are burning US flags and supporting terror groups that are trying to kill us.

[01:25:28] Right.

[01:25:29] There's like, and I do agree that there's like this like common sense.

[01:25:31] And I don't, and I don't, like I think everybody should have common sense, but common sense.

[01:25:35] Like, if you want my money, you want me to give you money while you aid and support people that want to decide what to do.

[01:25:42] That want to destroy me.

[01:25:45] Okay.

[01:25:46] I'm not going to give you the money.

[01:25:48] It's so simple.

[01:25:50] And everyone's going to fall in line.

[01:25:52] Everyone's going to fall in line. That's what I love. It's like, yeah, okay. Now what are you going to do?

[01:25:56] It's like, it's like when a parent cuts off their kid from their allowance and the kids never work the job and their life.

[01:26:02] Guess what happens to that kid? They fall in line.

[01:26:05] Or they run away and become homeless.

[01:26:09] I love this. I love it. Everybody. How you doing? We got a few more minutes.

[01:26:19] You see, you can, you can have a discourse about this stuff without getting angry and screaming.

[01:26:25] Like, I'll, I'll talk to anybody. I'm very open-minded.

[01:26:29] I liked, I think talking stuff out too is very healthy. I think we've, we've become a culture.

[01:26:35] You know, it's kind of like when I see Collins posts about pinball positivity. I, I just, it's weird to me to go on these crusades to just ask people to be nice.

[01:26:47] Because, because you know, it's like, if you're getting, there are a holes in this hobby. Like true a holes that say, trollish stuff.

[01:26:59] You don't know who they are. They're, you know, it's fake accounts. You're never going to stop it, but you're never going to stop it.

[01:27:06] The, the only thing you can work on is this. You can, well, it is changing my color. You can work on you.

[01:27:14] If you have self-esteem and you have thick skin, then why would it bother you so much?

[01:27:22] Look, it does suck. Look, when people come at you with like threats and, and you know, you have to kind of face I want to punch and all, you know, violence.

[01:27:33] It's not, it's not fun. I mean, I would hate to be a celebrity. Like, it's just up coming at you all day long, death threats left and right.

[01:27:39] Like, I don't know how you sleep.

[01:27:41] But, man, like, you just got to let stuff roll a little bit. I mean, I learn this with the twippies, you know.

[01:27:48] I mean, I don't think I even, I did not have a meltdown. No, it's just, that's what's weird to me is you guys have seen me meltdown. I did not have a meltdown. I was just a little bit surprised. That's all.

[01:27:59] I know my meltdowns and that was not a Canadian meltdown.

[01:28:04] Remember, it was not, it is a mini meltdown. Yeah, I'll take that if it was a mini meltdown.

[01:28:18] I like the real life talk with a splash of pimple on Saturdays. Yeah. No, dude, a pollen man. I mean, this is free.

[01:28:27] This is free. You know, I want to hear from you guys on more than just pimple. I think we should know people on more than just pimple.

[01:28:35] And no one should cancel anybody because of their beliefs.

[01:28:41] You know, I mean, you know, many times people come to me like, oh, that, that, that podcast is liberal. And he like, so, do you want to live in a world in which everybody thinks the way you think?

[01:28:51] No, we need liberals and you need conservatives. You need balance. The yin and yang of the universe people like positive and negative charges.

[01:29:02] And gang, let's not pretend like, oh, now this party is like gang, both parties have had moments where they were right and they shine.

[01:29:13] And it's the constant pendulum swings back and forth. It is. And crooks are going to be crooks and evil people will do evil things.

[01:29:23] And the jungle out there is a wild place. And we live in the jungle. You know, we don't live in a zoo.

[01:29:30] What we, what we've done life has let life like suburban life or city living, that's a zoo.

[01:29:37] Like it's a manufactured space that's not natural. And so yeah, like we, we've constructed zoos, but the world is still a jungle.

[01:29:46] You know, we have a great slide in my marketing deck where we tell clients, you, we can build ideas two ways for you.

[01:29:55] We can build ideas for the zoo or we can build ideas for the jungle. I wish you could see me pitch and present the clients and how we talk about the world.

[01:30:04] I think you'd be fascinated by it. I think you would find it very interesting and entertaining.

[01:30:09] And if we build ideas for the zoo, they could work, right? You know, we could put a line in a cage and say like that's an idea.

[01:30:19] And people can come and observe it and then leave for the day. Or we could build ideas for the jungle, which is built to survive the chaos of the internet, the trolls that are out there.

[01:30:30] It's built to break through all of this stuff that's out there in the world. And win because it's awesome because it's strong, it's a strong idea will survive in the jungle.

[01:30:41] Only weak ideas will survive in the zoo. So you know, it's like, yeah.

[01:30:51] How you guys doing otherwise? We're almost at time. Don't worry. This, this, this soap box will be over soon.

[01:30:58] Seven games in eight weeks, people. It's about to get real. It's about to get real. If you're not a member of the Canadian club, it's a good time to re-subscribe.

[01:31:06] It's a good time to invite a friend. You know, you can give it as a gift now. If you got any friends who are into pinball, be like, hey, I bought you a canada for a month or for a year.

[01:31:16] Did you cover Alice? Okay. So Alice, the apron is got some magnetic things stuck to it.

[01:31:25] And Alice should be out in the next couple of weeks. The first ones are going to go to Europe. I know they're worried about the tariffs. Dutch is very worried about the tariffs.

[01:31:35] Because they don't know what to do. So here's the quagmire is what happens if you sold people a game for 12, 5, and then there's like a 30% tax on top of that.

[01:31:44] Everyone's, you know, people are going to cancel their orders and walk away from their deposits.

[01:31:50] The tariff will be more money than your deposit was. So you'll walk away. I mean, it's about to go through some crazy times. I'm glad I don't have any money committed to anything right now.

[01:32:05] No money committed to anything. I'm glad I sold my apartment when I did. I'm glad I knocked 50% off my mortgage.

[01:32:14] You know, against the principle of my mortgage, I'm happy. Like I'm working hard. I'm on new accounts. I'm loving life.

[01:32:22] Other than this, hernia pain. And I'm very happy. I'm very content. I feel blessed. I do feel like heaven is a place on earth.

[01:32:31] I love my family. Killing and casting are incredible. Brenda is the rock of my world, the foundation of my world.

[01:32:39] I'm glad I get to hang out with you guys every week. And, you know, to be serious, the subscription in the $5 a month game, it's for all of this.

[01:32:49] It's just to say, hey man, like we appreciate what you're doing. We want you to keep doing it. And even when you don't feel like doing it, we know you're going to do it because I do feel an obligation to my subscribers to make content every week.

[01:33:02] And even when I'm not in the mood, I will make it because because I wanted to deliver what I promised you, which is two to three shows a week, that cover what's happening in Bumble.

[01:33:12] You see the crying. It was weird to me that people were like, his baby's crying upstairs when he's crying about losing the trophy. Yeah, like, wait, gang, if you have a nine month old baby, every once in a while, they wake up throughout the night.

[01:33:25] What's going on? I don't really Chris, you're always in the mood. Don't don't, I'm always in the mood. That's funny.

[01:33:34] No, look, and I don't watch any of the people trying to make fun of me and a lot of people have over the last week and a half, two weeks. I think it's funny. It just, it just helps me.

[01:33:45] The more people make fun of me and say what a terrible person I am, the more people get curious and want to check it out.

[01:33:51] And look, gang, everyone's, I will say this and Kellen, I joke about this.

[01:33:57] My 10 minute mini meltdown is the only thing people are talking about from the Twippies. It's the only thing.

[01:34:05] Nobody's talking about anything else. It's the only thing that drove conversation. The fact that I could go on Facebook live and for 10 minutes have a little minor meltdown, little hissy fit for myself, right?

[01:34:18] Little prima donna Chris crying about a twippy. That's the only thing that was talked about after the Twippies.

[01:34:26] All the work they put into the show, all the other winners, all the other categories, the only thing.

[01:34:34] Now, and think about it like this, if I had just won and just said, hey guys, thanks for the word, nobody would have talked about the show at all.

[01:34:45] Like at all, they're kind of lucky. Now people might tune in next year for the Canadian meltdown 2.0.

[01:34:52] Or was it like 9.0 at this point? I also love the fact that people record me.

[01:34:57] You know what I'm saying? They didn't download the video. They are recording me live. They're waiting for me to do something that I always do.

[01:35:08] That is the definition of living rent free. I mean, I don't, it's funny to me because I would never waste my time following a guy around like me.

[01:35:20] If I thought he was all the terrible things, they say, why would you? So cool, I've got you.

[01:35:27] I've got you watching. I've got you recording. I've got you. Thank you. I'm doing something right because in the world of art or content or entertainment, if people don't have an opinion about you, that's when you're failing.

[01:35:41] So thank you for hating me. It doesn't change anything that is going on in my world.

[01:35:51] And I just, kale's in the house. Can we give kale a congratulations?

[01:35:57] I'm going to give you a congratulations. I'm going to give you a congratulations.

[01:36:07] It's Rachel, right? Your wife, your better half. I'm right. It's Rachel, right?

[01:36:16] They, um, we, Kale and I have been laughing our asses off like behind the scenes. It's funny. It's, but, Kale, it almost feels like we orchestrated the whole thing like a WWE skit.

[01:36:28] And I think people actually don't understand how quickly, how quickly you can have a little moment and then you're past it. But what's great about the people that can't, can't let it go is, yes, Rachel's amazing.

[01:36:47] What's great about the people who can't let it go. It's like they think about it every time your name is mentioned, they go back to a negative, they go back to a negative, they go back to a negative.

[01:36:57] And I'm busy at a Japanese jazz bar, having some whiskey. I'm busy having like beautiful moments with my family. I'm busy like working on some of the world's most iconic brands. I'm busy like, you know, picking up the fall leaves or the winter leaves.

[01:37:14] Like I'm busy like waxing my Neo Tokyo drifting GR 86. I'm busy ordering tires for the Dodge. You know, it's like everything's life's going on busy call my parents telling them how much I love them like and these people like, oh, can it, can it, can it, can it, can it, can it. He's, he's this is it. They don't know anything.

[01:37:32] All I know is this is been a great episode Saturday morning guys. Thank you so much. I really appreciate the support. This is fun. We go off on tangents. That's the show. If you want just pinball talk, lot of good content creators out there that don't deviate.

[01:37:49] But you guys are the best. Again, respect everybody. Treat people how you want to be treated. Okay, it's real simple. You want to be happy in life. Give people the respect you want. Don't be hateful. Listen to people. You know, it's my one advice for my real far left friends. Don't get mad. Just listen.

[01:38:11] Come in. Cross over with an open mind. Why did you not vote for come all the hairs? Yeah. And when people talk get like just hear them out.

[01:38:24] The Derrick's the Derrick's of the world who just rage quit people. That's sad to me. How can how can you how can you blanket a person because of one thing and then you forget years of a friendship is weird to me. I mean, he lost my friendship.

[01:38:43] And I lost his, but he decided that he just couldn't. And you know what? Those people are in for really rough four years. We're not.

[01:38:54] Look, and most of my democratic friends, they're like whatever. It's same old same old stuff. Another day, another dollar like no one surprised by any of this. We've seen it all before. Right. It's like we I've seen this movie. Everybody be good. Have a great Saturday.

[01:39:11] And you know, treat your wives to a nice dinner tonight on me. I'm just not going to pay for that dinner, but treat them to a nice dinner and say that can you wanted me to take you out.

[01:39:21] He wanted me to do as many push ups and pull ups as I do. Pinside posts. And he said if ice man and crazy levy and all the hyper users on Pinside, if all those guys with their 35,000 posts on Pinside.

[01:39:40] If they did a push up or a pull up or a sit up for everyone of those posts, the pinball community would be the most ripped community in the entire world.

[01:39:53] So you know me for every time you do a post, do a push up. That should be the rule on Pinside. Is that toxic calling? I don't think so. Later. All right. Let's end that.

[01:40:06] Ending the live broadcast. We're still live on YouTube. Access still plan.

[01:40:13] Families downstairs. I love guns or is this. They're so cool. They're just like the coolest man. Let me show you guys what I mean by that.

[01:40:22] Look at this. This is like in this photo. It's just like everything.

[01:40:31] Sorry gang. Just want to pull this up. I think when the coolest shots ever of a band ever.

[01:40:46] This band would never survive today. They'd be canceled right away. Look at that.

[01:40:52] Like I was 13 when this photo came out. You don't think as a little young boy, you want to be like hanging with these guys.

[01:41:02] Guns of roses is here tonight. You want it the best. Well, they couldn't make it. So here's what you get. Can it has been ball podcast later guys.
