[00:00] I don't think you could pick a worse month to launch a new pinball machine, but there's

[00:03] four machines coming over the next four weeks.

[00:06] I asked Killian what song should we play to get everybody in a better mood and he picked

[00:11] this one.

[00:12] Let it go, can't hold it back anymore, let it go, let it go, turn away and slam the door.

[00:25] I don't care what they're going to say, let the storm rage on, the cold never bothered

[00:37] me anyway.

[00:38] Ah, is there anything going on in the world that would keep you from buying an expensive

[00:47] pinball machine right now?

[00:49] OMG, I've been covering this hobby for 12 years and I've never seen a climate quite

[00:56] like this.

[00:58] But you don't come to the Canadian Pinball Podcast for political advice, I'm not an economist,

[01:03] but I do know that it is rough out there and it's only going to get worse today and

[01:10] I think everybody, when you think about it, everyone's going to have to go through a little

[01:15] bit, maybe a lot of bit of a mental reset on what's important to you, to life, to what's

[01:24] out there.

[01:25] As I look at my young children and I worry about my job people, the first thing to get

[01:30] cut in an economic downturn is marketing.

[01:35] They cut the marketing budgets in half and I don't know what's going to happen.

[01:39] Life is very, very short.

[01:40] I lost a family member yesterday to cancer and I'm looking out there, it's a rainy, gloomy,

[01:46] gray day.

[01:48] Four pinball companies are about to launch games over the next four weeks and it is rough,

[01:55] right?

[01:56] Rough time to look at everything happening and say, hey, you know what I'm going to do?

[02:01] I'm going to buy my way out of this gloomy feeling by buying another pinball machine.

[02:08] Look, here's the thing.

[02:10] I think now more than ever is going to be a period in which people wait and see.

[02:15] I think everyone is kind of forced to wait and see now, but why wouldn't you?

[02:21] I also think the real issue now.

[02:23] Obviously, there's a lot of real issues with tariffs and the cost of goods.

[02:28] What happens if Stern has 70% of its parts coming from overseas?

[02:33] How can they even raise the price even more?

[02:36] The latest rumor is that King Kong is not going to arrive on Spike 3.

[02:43] I think that means that Spike 3 is a price increase move.

[02:48] Yes, they're going to give us more, but they're going to charge more and just think about

[02:52] it on a very common, sensical level.

[02:56] How if everybody that you want to buy your games, if they're getting hammered financially,

[03:03] how can you increase the price on pinball machines?

[03:06] But that's the reality.

[03:08] Is these companies, their operating costs are going to go up?

[03:11] I think that's going to stall a lot of people's desires to buy these new games.

[03:16] We're never going to lose our love of pinball.

[03:19] We're never going to lose our excitement to see what these companies have around the

[03:23] corner.

[03:24] I'm still just as excited today as I was a week ago on what barrels of fun is going

[03:31] to bring out into the pinball world, on what King Kong will have in it, on how Predator

[03:36] will be delivered to us.

[03:37] I got some news about that game that's not very good for the pinball brothers.

[03:42] Then we've got Harry Potter.

[03:44] It's likely it is going to be announced on May 2nd, which is International Harry Potter

[03:50] Day.

[03:51] Apparently that's the day in the book where he beats Voldemort.

[03:55] I don't know, man.

[03:56] Does anybody really connect May 2nd with Harry Potter?

[03:59] I think everyone just connects May 4th to Star Wars.

[04:03] So I'm still so excited to see these four games.

[04:06] The reason why is I don't really have any plans to go in on any of these games right

[04:11] now.

[04:12] I think it's going to be interesting watching these companies try to slug it out as more

[04:18] and more of us are just going to be content with the games we have.

[04:22] But nothing ceases to amaze me in the world of pinball.

[04:26] I still think there is a large portion of you and you're listening to this show right

[04:30] now.

[04:31] Even if the economic world is on fire, you're still going to go in on these new games.

[04:36] There's something about this hobby that makes people make irrational decisions.

[04:41] Over the last three to four years, if you bought these new and box games, you've been

[04:45] losing so much money and yet people are still buying.

[04:49] So I don't get it.

[04:50] It just seems to be this crazy arbitrary economy that happens around pinball.

[04:55] But let's talk about what's about to happen.

[04:57] So all of a sudden, you've got two companies that are going to have media days a week from

[05:03] tomorrow.

[05:04] So on April 15th, which is a Tuesday, Barrels of Fun is going to allow media and distributors

[05:11] into its factory to see its new game.

[05:13] Now, I think that means that Barrels of Fun is going to show their game before that moment.

[05:19] But David Van S and Brian Savage had an idea.

[05:23] Here's what their idea was.

[05:25] Invite everybody in, sign an NDA and give people a day to make all of their coverage

[05:31] and then you reveal the game.

[05:34] So they might not reveal this game until like Wednesday or Thursday.

[05:38] Here's the problem.

[05:39] If Stern Pinball is inviting media to see King Kong on Thursday, April 17th, if we look

[05:46] at how Stern historically does their media days, they usually already reveal the game

[05:52] before media come through the door because they don't want to have to like have people

[05:56] sign NDAs.

[05:58] They don't want to keep it a secret.

[06:00] And so that means we are most likely going to see the King Kong teaser this Friday.

[06:06] They always do that like the weekend before they reveal the theme and then we're going

[06:11] to get the full launch of the game on Tuesday.

[06:14] Okay.

[06:15] So if you think about that, that means on the very day Barrels of Fun wants media to

[06:20] come over to Texas, Stern Pinball is going to fully reveal King Kong on the same exact

[06:27] day.

[06:29] That is going to be crazy.

[06:30] And all of that is happening while the world economies are on fire.

[06:34] So just think about that.

[06:35] Having covered this hobby for 12 years, I've never seen a period like this.

[06:39] It was the worst single economic collapse since 1929 on a single day I saw on the news.

[06:45] Wow.

[06:46] Okay.

[06:47] But you know what?

[06:48] Forget about all that people.

[06:49] Let's go buy a new pinball machine.

[06:50] I don't know.

[06:51] I don't think a lot of people are going to be rushing anymore.

[06:53] And I'm worried about the Barrels launch the most.

[06:55] I really am.

[06:56] And I reached out to my friends again and I said, Hey guys, can you help me help you?

[07:01] And I get something to get people excited about and I haven't seen anything yet.

[07:06] So I think I'm going to see this game when the rest of you see the game.

[07:10] I don't think I'm going to get any assets beforehand.

[07:13] I don't think I'm going to have the ability to get you excited about the game before it

[07:17] comes out.

[07:18] Now look, I'm still excited to see it.

[07:20] I do think if it's Dune, it's going to be a hard sell.

[07:24] And I'm just reading the room.

[07:26] It's going to be a hard sell because you got King Kong and you got Harry Potter and those

[07:30] games are going to have a lot of interest.

[07:33] And look, you got like three games that people are really excited to see.

[07:37] I don't think most people are that excited for the pinball brothers predator game.

[07:41] Pinball brothers hasn't made a good game on their own.

[07:45] I don't think it starts now.

[07:47] I think the problem is going to be this for these companies.

[07:50] It seems like the smart move would be if you were stern and you were barrels of fun and

[07:54] the world economies are on fire, you wouldn't reveal right now.

[07:58] You would just wait a little bit and see what happens.

[08:01] The problem is all of these companies need to keep the line going.

[08:06] Every week the line is not going.

[08:08] They're losing a lot of money because they got to pay the employees to come in and they

[08:13] need to be doing something.

[08:15] And you need those orders to come in to keep the line going.

[08:19] Now is a really brutal time to be in the manufacturing business.

[08:24] And especially if you're manufacturing something people really don't need.

[08:29] So I don't really think there's the option for these companies to wait just to wait it

[08:34] out and see what happens.

[08:35] Let me pivot real quickly to Dutch pinball X because I hear a lot of people in that thread

[08:40] because if you think about all the games right now that are getting impacted by the tariffs

[08:45] and the 20% tariff on top of the game price, it's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[08:52] And this game is on the line right now.

[08:54] And so people are wondering well what happens right because when they started making this

[08:58] game the original plan was not to sort of only ship the games in Europe first.

[09:05] The original plan was to send some games to America then send some games to Europe.

[09:11] 300 games were sold for Americans and 200 for Europe and around the world.

[09:16] Now I know that Dutch pinball X is planning to announce an official statement.

[09:21] I've been speaking with Melvin and I think the thing they're going to do, because you

[09:25] can't blame them right, I think the thing they're going to do that makes the most sense.

[09:29] I think they're going to look at the first like couple hundred games and it makes most

[09:33] sense to send those games to Europe first to see if the tariffs cool down for everybody

[09:39] buying in America.

[09:40] But I think they might also if you want your game right now and if you are in America and

[09:47] you want your game I think they're going to allow you to say hey I'm cool paying the

[09:54] tariff ship me my game.

[09:56] So I think they're going to give everybody the option.

[09:59] Remember it's not their fault.

[10:01] They didn't want this to happen.

[10:02] It's just the new reality.

[10:04] It's affecting everything not just these pinball machines.

[10:07] So I think they're going to give everybody the option and I know them they're not going

[10:12] to steal anybody's deposits.

[10:14] I would just keep an open mind and I think they're going to give everybody an option.

[10:19] This game is like the smallest volume game that needs to figure it out.

[10:24] The other thing is this.

[10:25] When are we going to see video of a final production version of Alice?

[10:29] I don't get it.

[10:30] I think a few games have gone out but nobody's streaming it.

[10:33] So hopefully we get to see that in the next week or two.

[10:37] Again, just to be candid here, I think what is going to happen is you're going to see

[10:42] more people bail on buying pinball.

[10:45] They're going to want to bail on Alice.

[10:47] They're going to want to bail on other things.

[10:49] It's just the reality people.

[10:51] And I think once people see gameplay, they might not be like, oh man, yeah, now I'm willing

[10:56] to spend 20% more on this game.

[10:59] I don't think so.

[11:00] I don't think it's going to happen.

[11:01] It's a really weird time people.

[11:02] It's a really weird time.

[11:04] But look, also Dutch pinball hasn't ordered 500 parts.

[11:07] So I think they're going to play this by year.

[11:10] If people want out, they might end up not making 500 units.

[11:14] They might only make like 300 of this game and move on to the next.

[11:19] All that is to be determined.

[11:21] And I know that they're going to make the right decisions over at DPX.

[11:25] Spooky pinballs feeling good right now because they've sold all 888 Evil Dead machines.

[11:31] And Evil Dead is a phenomenal machine.

[11:34] I played it this weekend.

[11:35] You probably heard my Facebook lives and my YouTube lives and Canada trying to flip the

[11:40] camera around.

[11:41] But Evil Dead is a phenomenal game.

[11:43] At $10,000, it is easily Spooky Pinballs nicest machine to date.

[11:48] When I played that game next to D&D Premium, it absolutely made the stern look like a tanker

[11:54] toy.

[11:55] When I went over to Avatar, the amount of stuff in Evil Dead makes the amount of stuff

[12:01] in Avatar embarrassingly empty for a $15,000 game.

[12:06] Look I get that Spooky Pinball has servos opening things up in the game, but I'd rather

[12:11] have servos opening up toys and making things happen than have nothing happening at all.

[12:17] It's amazing how much they put into this game.

[12:20] And I just have to say Christopher Franchi's art package when you stand over Evil Dead is

[12:25] one of the nicest looking games I've ever seen.

[12:27] I don't think I've seen a game from head to toe, the attention to detail on everything,

[12:32] the coin door, the armor, the speaker grill area, the topper, everything for $10,000,

[12:39] you get everything, inner art blades, you get a wide body, you get all these toys, and

[12:43] then you look at what everybody else is trying to sell you.

[12:45] And this game is made in Benton, Wisconsin.

[12:49] And so I don't think you're going to have to pay a tear of, now I don't know where they

[12:52] get all their parts, but everybody gets something from overseas.

[12:54] They have to.

[12:56] I heard Stern has something like 70% of its parts come from China.

[13:02] 70%?!

[13:03] How are they going to survive if that's the case?

[13:06] We are just eight days out from barrels of funds new game.

[13:10] Eight days out.

[13:12] And they are doing nothing to get us excited.

[13:14] I don't get what's going on.

[13:16] I really don't.

[13:18] So here's some news about Predator that you're not going to like.

[13:21] And no, it's not whether or not Arnold is in the game or not.

[13:24] I don't know.

[13:25] I'm not hearing he's not in the game, but here's the real killer for Pinball Brothers.

[13:29] Nobody knows this.

[13:30] So Pinball Brothers has the license for Predator.

[13:34] The only issue with the license they have is they only have the US license for the game.

[13:42] That means they can only sell the game in America.

[13:46] They can't sell it in Europe and they can't sell it in Australia.

[13:51] That's the rumor I heard.

[13:53] Now imagine their scenario now where they've got to pay these tariff taxes on this game

[14:00] and they can't even sell it locally.

[14:03] And the only place they can sell it is a country that's now going to tax it 20% on top of the

[14:09] price.

[14:10] The problem is nobody's going to want to buy a game right now that has a tariff attached

[14:15] to it.

[14:16] Because why do you want to pay that premium?

[14:18] And then what happens if they lift those tariffs?

[14:20] You pay 20% more and you're never going to get that money back.

[14:25] The real issue though is not just the tariffs.

[14:28] Before the tariffs were even in place, almost every single pinball machine has lost like

[14:33] 20 to 30% of its value in just 6 months.

[14:37] Oh my gosh, like we're burning the candle at both ends.

[14:41] But my advice to everybody is this, and I mean this when I say this, just wait it out.

[14:47] Wait it out.

[14:48] These games are going to get made.

[14:49] One's going to have to make all 1000 Kong LEs.

[14:53] Did you hear the rumor that they're going to make an SLE of King Kong?

[14:56] Yeah, really good time to make an even more expensive version of a stern machine.

[15:01] That's going to go over real well.

[15:03] I mean, but again, like I said earlier, they'll probably sell out because this is what the

[15:07] pinball buying demographic does.

[15:10] It absolutely operates outside of the normal world.

[15:14] So they're going to make all 1000 of those games and gang, they're going to make King

[15:18] Kong premium forever.

[15:20] So why would you buy one right now?

[15:23] If you think about barrels of fun, I think they're going to struggle.

[15:26] If this is Dune, again, let the distributors buy it.

[15:29] Don't run in right away.

[15:30] We know the game's not going to go up in value.

[15:33] It's going to have a hard time finding customers, especially with Kong and Potter around the

[15:37] corner.

[15:38] It's just the worst time ever for barrels of fun to launch a game.

[15:41] It's unfortunate.

[15:42] I know they had this date planned for a long time.

[15:45] There is no way they anticipate it.

[15:47] Keith Elwin's game the same week as theirs and they did not anticipate the global meltdown

[15:52] of the markets the same week.

[15:54] They need you to commit to spending $10,000 on a pinball machine, but they're still going

[15:58] to make the games.

[15:59] Brian and David can't turn off the line.

[16:02] So they're still going to make them.

[16:04] So let them make the games and see what happens.

[16:07] And then we're going to get like Harry Potter and the unlimited C order window.

[16:12] We know Jack is going to say he got 5,000 orders for CEs and we know they're going to

[16:17] make Harry Potter CEs for years to come.

[16:20] So my advice to all of you, let these companies make their products, let the dealers and the

[16:27] distros buy them and then wait because what is absolutely going to happen if things keep

[16:35] going the way they're going and it's almost already too late.

[16:38] Too much money has been evaporated.

[16:42] You're going to see so many games for sale at a discount.

[16:47] When times get tough, people get rid of things they don't really need.

[16:52] You're going to see more and more people put up their pinball machines for sale and they're

[16:56] hard to sell.

[16:57] Right.

[16:57] This is not like selling a watch or a car.

[17:01] Like just moving a pinball machine out of your house into someone else's is going to

[17:07] be really hard because luxury items get hit the hardest because it's the one thing nobody

[17:12] really needs when we get into like a recessionary period like we're in right now.

[17:19] And I think everyone's just going to wait it out.

[17:21] I really do.

[17:21] I think they're going to wait it out.

[17:23] I don't know how these new games are going to sell.

[17:26] I can tell you they're not going to sell as well as they would have two weeks ago and

[17:31] we'll see what happens in two weeks.

[17:34] In about an hour, the markets are going to open up and crash.

[17:38] The only thing that's not going to happen is I'm not going to raise the price of Canada's

[17:42] Pinball Podcast.

[17:43] I thank each and every one of you for being a subscriber.

[17:47] I think this is where the most fun is going to be over the next couple of months.

[17:50] I wouldn't buy these expensive games right now, hang out with the community because trust

[17:55] me, we're going to need each other more than we've ever needed each other to make it through

[17:58] this period.

[17:59] I feel that way.

[18:01] Some of us are going to lose our jobs.

[18:03] Some of us are going to be in a really tough situation and I think we need each other.

[18:08] I mean that.

[18:09] We're going to need to lean on each other and help each other through this.

[18:13] I think a lot of people are confused.

[18:15] A lot of people are confused.

[18:17] This show will never get political.

[18:18] It won't.

[18:19] I don't think there's anybody out there right now that feels like anything going on is making

[18:25] America great again.

[18:27] You're not.

[18:28] Because everybody votes with their wallet.

[18:30] They do.

[18:31] This is just like a weird period.

[18:33] I've never been through anything like this.

[18:36] You haven't been through anything like this and I think we're just going to need each

[18:39] other.

[18:40] I think we're going to have to have support for each other and I think we're going to

[18:43] have to make the pinball space at least an area we can go where it's not going to be

[18:48] overly political but it is impossible to separate what's going on in the world with

[18:55] pinball conversation.

[18:57] I see it on pin side.

[18:58] We're trying to limit the amount of political back and forth but how can we honestly think

[19:04] about these games and not think about what's going on in the real world.

[19:09] I think what's good is this.

[19:11] I think it's going to give everybody a new perspective on what's important in life.

[19:17] It's not these machines.

[19:19] It's each other.

[19:20] It's your family.

[19:22] It's your well-being.

[19:23] You need to fill your lives with things that really, really matter and surround yourself

[19:29] with family and friends that genuinely care about you and we've all had it way too good

[19:35] for way too long.

[19:37] The fact that some of us have like five, 15, 20 pinball machines in your home.

[19:42] While most people are suffering to put food on the table, they can't afford to pay for

[19:47] their cost of living.

[19:49] We do seem like this privileged one percentile of society that's hemming and hawing if Barrel's

[19:56] of Fun is really trying to sell dune pinball to us.

[20:00] If I walk down the street and I ask people, hey man, how do you feel about dune pinball?

[20:05] Nobody cares.

[20:06] If I ask people, would you spend $15,000 on a single pinball machine?

[20:11] They would slap me in the face.

[20:13] It just is what it is.

[20:14] This is our little niche hobby.

[20:16] We all still love it, but I really do think we're going to head for a period in which

[20:21] we need to just hit pause for a while.

[20:24] It's just not a good time for these companies.

[20:26] At the same time, we're going to be hitting pause.

[20:28] They're going to launch four games in four weeks and they're all crashing on top of each

[20:32] other as the global markets crash at the same time.

[20:35] I mean, think about it.

[20:36] The crazy part is these companies were getting ready to raise their prices.

[20:41] It's insane.

[20:42] $5 a month.

[20:44] I'm never raising it.

[20:45] Let's all be there for each other.

[20:46] I mean it.

[20:47] Let's not argue with each other.

[20:49] Let's all take a pause, wait and see, and don't try to chase happiness right now by buying

[20:54] more pinball machines.

[20:56] It's not the answer.

[20:57] You know it.

[20:58] If any of you just want to talk it out, I'm serious.

[21:01] Just email me at canadapinball at gmail.com.

[21:04] I'll give you my number.

[21:06] Let's have a phone call and let's just talk it out.

[21:09] I mean that because we need each other more than we need another $10,000 pinball machine.

[21:15] We have a happy Monday.

[21:17] There's going to be a lot of fun coverage coming as these games are about to come out.

[21:21] But right now, I don't think anyone is grabbing that wallet to buy a dune pinball machine

[21:28] later.

[21:29] The past is in the past.

[21:30] Let it go.

[21:31] Let it go.

[21:32] When I rise like the break of dawn.

[21:33] Let it go.

[21:34] Let it go.
