[00:00] I used to think maybe you love me, now baby I'm sure.

[00:09] And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door.

[00:19] Uh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the world's only pinball podcast that is bolted to the floor.

[00:25] We're going nowhere, I'm in a super good mood, work is going great, Brenda's back, Killian is over his hand-foot mouth disease.

[00:32] We're still above ground complaining and arguing and getting excited about pinball machines.

[00:37] What a wonderful life we all have that we get to spend it together.

[00:41] So here's what we're going to talk about.

[00:43] We're going to go around the Pinball Horn on this Friday edition of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:47] There's a lot more rumors going on in pinball that I have not shared with you.

[00:51] Let's just get them all out there.

[00:53] Now that I've been officially mentioned on NAPS Arcade, I'm also in a super good mood.

[00:59] Thank you, Jason, for including my rumor about Keith Elwin making two games next year.

[01:04] We're going to talk about that because there's another rumor floating around the Keith Elwin space, floating like it's some buoy or something.

[01:12] So let's get right to it.

[01:14] First, let's start with Venom.

[01:16] I just want to say this about Venom.

[01:18] When you go into the Venom thread, it is just a total cluster.

[01:23] I don't understand why people are still debating this game.

[01:28] 90% of the people who are making these debates haven't even played the game, but Venom is not going to sell that well.

[01:36] We both know it and it's not because of the code.

[01:39] It's not because of the price that has something to do with it, but it's just because it's Venom.

[01:45] This game was never going to do that well.

[01:48] Venom is like an unappealing theme to like 90% of potential pinball buyers.

[01:54] And look, so many of us are just over.

[01:57] We're over another Marvel pinball machine.

[02:01] I think people are very satiated with Foo Fighters.

[02:05] I think people are still waiting for James Bond to get good, but we knew in 2023 started that 2023 was always going to be a little bit of an off year.

[02:14] In the pinball space.

[02:16] And if you look at it, right, if you actually look at what happened this year in pinball, it has been primarily underwhelming other than the Foo Fighters.

[02:24] Like everything else has been an underwhelming thing.

[02:29] And so now what's happening, right?

[02:31] Everyone's kind of looking past Venom because you know that Keith Elwyn's pins are coming next year.

[02:39] So why would you pull the trigger on a freaking Venom right now when if you just wait a few months, you're going to see Keith Elwyn's pin in February.

[02:47] And I think everyone's starting to realize that like it's August, we're going to slide quickly into September, then it's going to be the fall, then it's going to be the holidays.

[02:55] Then you're going to have to buy your wife and your partner's presents and go on holidays.

[02:59] You're going to be spending other money elsewhere.

[03:01] And if you're a normal human being and you've been just stepping outside your house, the price of everything has gone through the roof.

[03:07] So unless you truly love it, unless you truly want it, you're not going to pull the trigger on these kinds of pins.

[03:15] And we've been saying this for a long time.

[03:17] And the other big issue is this, and this is probably the most major issue that's going to happen in pinball as Stern gets ready to increase its capacity.

[03:27] And they're going to make more games a year.

[03:30] The question is this, where are these games going to go?

[03:34] And for those of you out there who have pinball machines in your homes and in your collections, a lot of you need to free up room to put a new in box machine into your game room.

[03:45] And that's going to be the biggest issue for most of you.

[03:47] It's not even the money.

[03:48] You just don't have space.

[03:50] And so to move something new in, you got to move something old out.

[03:54] And here's the problem.

[03:55] Almost everybody now is going to have to start moving stuff out.

[03:58] So if everyone's looking to get rid of one, who is looking to absorb those use machines?

[04:04] And that's going to be the real problem.

[04:06] We're going to have to start seeing use prices soft and significantly.

[04:10] I posted on pin side today, people are trying to sell.

[04:14] They're used, right?

[04:15] These are used, opened and beaten on games.

[04:18] They're used Foo Fighter LEs.

[04:20] People are trying to sell them for the same price you can march up now and get a brand new in box Foo Fighter LE.

[04:28] What is wrong with like the used pinball market?

[04:31] Are people unaware of this?

[04:33] Like all you got to do is look at the marketplace and say, hey, I'm not going to get 13.5 for my used Foo Fighters LE because there's three of them available new in box with or best offer for a new one inside a box.

[04:46] And I don't know what it is.

[04:47] It's just like this delusion that people have that they think they're not going to lose anything on a secondhand sale of pinball.

[04:53] Not only are they going to lose, I think people are going to lose a lot more than they want to as more and more people need to free up room.

[05:01] And once a new Keith Elwin pinball machine lands in the world, think about it, like thousands of people are going to want it.

[05:07] That means there needs to be thousands of spaces around the world in which people have a spot open for that Keith Elwin game.

[05:14] What happens if he comes out with two games?

[05:16] Then you need two spots because you know you're going to want a Keith Elwin game.

[05:20] There's only two things right now that will cause a FOMO situation in pinball.

[05:25] Keith Elwin and a triple A theme.

[05:28] Those two things.

[05:29] And imagine if you put those two themes together, forget it.

[05:32] Forget it.

[05:33] All bets are off if Keith Elwin has a triple A theme.

[05:36] I mean, he's only had one triple A theme and that's Jurassic Park.

[05:39] Everything else.

[05:40] Avengers, not comic book edition.

[05:42] If it was the Avengers movie, it would have been more triple A.

[05:45] Definitely not Godzilla.

[05:47] Definitely not Iron Maiden.

[05:49] You know, so we'll see what happens.

[05:51] I think a lot of my friends are just at a room and it's just it's interesting seeing the stuff they're going to part with.

[05:57] So look, Venom is always going to have a lukewarm response.

[06:01] It's not worth arguing about it.

[06:03] It's not worth debating the RPG code versus this versus that.

[06:08] Again, it just looks like a middle of the road game.

[06:12] Brian Eddy, like he didn't blow us away with Mandalorian.

[06:15] He's not blowing people away with Venom.

[06:18] I just think it's going to be a game that you're always going to be able to get.

[06:21] If I were to predict where Venom's going to end up and sort of like the portfolio of games out in the world,

[06:27] Venom's going to end up being a game like Aerosmith.

[06:30] It's not going to be the next Deadpool.

[06:32] If Deadpool came out today at these prices, it also would not have caught fire.

[06:37] And that's the other thing is the pricing does matter.

[06:40] It absolutely does matter.

[06:42] You're looking down at these games and you're saying to yourself,

[06:45] do I see 10 or $13,000 in value?

[06:48] You know what rumor I said?

[06:49] Well, it's never going to happen.

[06:51] It's Stern selling directly.

[06:53] Here's an interesting thing that I'm hearing that Stern's new mega facility is going to be so big.

[06:59] They're going to have enough room to stock a lot more inventory

[07:04] because right now Stern is a manufacturing company.

[07:08] They're not a storage company.

[07:10] They can't really pile up hundreds of games and a lot of inventory in their current facility.

[07:16] But when they move into the new facility, what if they could store like 2,000 games or 1,000 games?

[07:23] Does that mean that Stern might start selling direct?

[07:27] Stern loses at minimum $1,000 on every game they sell

[07:33] through a distributor.

[07:34] Are we going to see Stern maybe open that up?

[07:37] Now, right now they only sell a handful of LEDs directly.

[07:40] Are we going to see themselves premiums and pros?

[07:44] And if they do this, what they're ostensibly doing is they're going to squeeze out the smaller distributors

[07:49] and they're going to be gone.

[07:50] They're not going to be able to survive that.

[07:52] I don't know.

[07:53] It's weird, right?

[07:54] It's a really weird situation because if Stern does sell directly and they sell for that much money,

[08:00] then you have to ask yourself, what am I paying a distributor for then?

[08:04] Right?

[08:05] Because if Stern sells directly, then they're going to have to start handling customer service issues.

[08:10] They're going to have to let those customers who buy directly go directly to Stern for parts.

[08:16] And they don't really want to do that for all the reasons that are obvious.

[08:19] And so I still don't think Stern's going to blow up this model.

[08:23] They might go there eventually if they start to see more and more titles stalling out

[08:29] and distributors basically balking at orders because we all know that distributors did not say,

[08:35] hey, Stern, we're going to take all 1000 of your Venom LEDs.

[08:39] And so what is Stern going to do?

[08:40] They're still going to make 1000 LEDs.

[08:42] I think once Stern starts the line for a game, I think they make them all.

[08:46] Even if the orders aren't fully there, I think they're going to make all 1000 Venom LEDs.

[08:50] I don't think Jersey Jack, though, like makes 1000 Godfather Cs.

[08:54] So let's talk about real quickly two Keith Elwin games in 2024.

[08:59] And now I am hearing that Keith Elwin may be the designer for John Wick, that it's not going to be John Borg.

[09:06] It's going to be Keith Elwin.

[09:08] And now the rumors get even more interesting because you're like, wait a minute,

[09:12] maybe John Wick is the game that's going to come out next and not Jaws.

[09:17] I still think it's going to be Jaws.

[09:19] We've heard Jaws forever and a day.

[09:22] There's so much rumblings around Jaws that I think it's going to be Jaws.

[09:27] So I think it's going to go Keith Elwin Jaws.

[09:30] I think then there's going to be a new game from John Borg.

[09:34] And then there's going to be another game from Keith Elwin.

[09:37] There are not going to be more than two games from Keith Elwin next year.

[09:42] I know Zambietti said that on Naps Arcade in the story in which I was mentioned,

[09:47] but I do think Jeremy might just be trolling just a little bit.

[09:51] I don't know.

[09:52] There's no way it's going to be three games from Keith Elwin in one year.

[09:56] And speaking of Jeremy, Mr. Zambietti, friend of the show, congratulations on getting what you've deserved for many, many years now.

[10:05] He is now officially hired by Sturb Bimbal.

[10:08] Like when I heard the news, I was like, wait a minute, he's been like making games for them for like six years.

[10:12] And now it's official.

[10:13] Now he gets to get on the benefit train.

[10:16] I'm so happy for Jeremy.

[10:18] He is the most talented artist in all of Pimbal.

[10:21] And he's the one man who you can give a blank piece of paper to and he could create a freaking masterpiece.

[10:28] You can never replace this guy with AI artwork.

[10:32] Can't say that about everybody else in the Pimbal art space.

[10:34] Oh, Canada, you can't say it.

[10:36] You got to whisper that stuff on Saturday morning.

[10:39] Spectacular.

[10:40] All right.

[10:41] So Jeremy Packer, congratulations.

[10:43] All right.

[10:44] So what else is happening in the world of Pimbal?

[10:46] So I heard a crazy rumor about Jersey Jack.

[10:48] Now this one is weird, but let's step back a little bit.

[10:52] Jersey Jack Pimbal, October 5th of 2021 is when they officially announced that they were hiring Mark Satan to be a game designer at Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[11:05] Okay.

[11:06] So what do you think Mark Satan's been doing for the last two years at Jersey Jack Pimbal?

[11:13] What do you think?

[11:14] Any guesses?

[11:15] Do you think he's actually been doing what his title is?

[11:17] Do you think he's been designing a game for two freaking years?

[11:22] Okay.

[11:23] So here's the rumor.

[11:24] Remember those dates.

[11:25] Steve Richie's Elton John is coming out next.

[11:29] I am hearing that Jersey Jack is planning to release two games, not one, but two games or reveal two games by the end of this year that Steve Richie's game will be unveiled at Expo.

[11:43] I don't even know why you bother revealing a game at Expo.

[11:46] All you need is the internet.

[11:47] And then we're going to see Mark Satan's game at the end of the year.

[11:52] Now, when I heard this rumor and this comes from a good source, I was like, come on, really?

[11:57] Jersey Jack has never even revealed two games in one year, let alone three.

[12:02] Because remember, Godfather was revealed this year and then we're going to get Elton John and then another game from Mark Satan.

[12:10] Do you think Steve Richie would even let that happen?

[12:12] I don't think so.

[12:13] He needs to come out with a bang and he's not going to want to share the line with another designer.

[12:18] He's not going to want to share the limelight with another designer.

[12:22] But let's just for a moment, consider this rumor.

[12:25] Let's just consider where something like this would come from.

[12:29] And the only guess I can make is this, that Jersey Jack deep down inside, deep down in the soul of Jersey Jack Pimbal,

[12:37] I feel like they might know and they might be reading the writing on the wall that they missed with Toy Story 4.

[12:45] They missed with the Godfather.

[12:48] And Elton John is clearly another theme that Jack Guinari put on the table.

[12:53] And I think they might realize that we can't have three strikes in a row.

[12:59] And maybe we just reveal both of these games because maybe they're radically different in theme.

[13:05] Maybe they have radically different audiences.

[13:07] And maybe even if they're proud of both games, they might release both of them.

[13:12] My guess is Mark Satan's game is going to be Avatar.

[13:15] It's not going to be the Matrix.

[13:17] I hope it's Top Gun.

[13:19] We have rumors it might be Top Gun.

[13:21] But that's it.

[13:22] I can't see Tom Cruise signing off on this stuff because, you know, I tried to work with Tom Cruise through Budweiser,

[13:28] because Budweiser appears in the Top Gun movie and he didn't want anything to do with it.

[13:32] But I think that's because it was alcohol.

[13:34] But still, it's probably really expensive to license a Tom Cruise movie.

[13:38] So do we think this is going to happen?

[13:41] The only thing for certain is this, that Jersey Jack pinball is the godfather is not selling well.

[13:47] It will go down as a sales flop.

[13:49] And they're going to have to pivot to something else.

[13:52] If I were Jersey Jack and it is Elton John and I know Ken Cromwell, people are probably like,

[13:58] Canada talked about you.

[13:59] If it is Elton John, just rip the band-aid off now.

[14:03] I don't even care if the game's not ready to be revealed.

[14:05] If they try to like hold it back the way they did with Godfather, the way they did with Toy Story 4,

[14:11] you have to give people time to warm up to a theme that you know people are not over the moon about.

[14:18] And I know that you're drinking the Kool-Aid inside JJP and you think, oh, this is it.

[14:23] It's going to win people over.

[14:24] It's got the same rainbow lighting system that every Jersey Jack game has right now.

[14:28] No, trust me, Jersey Jack.

[14:30] Tell people right now our next game is going to be Elton John and give people a chance to listen to the Rocket Man's music.

[14:39] Get excited about it.

[14:41] Here's why that would work.

[14:42] All the people moaning and groaning could just get it out of their systems well before you're ready to create a launch moment.

[14:51] Just trust me on this.

[14:53] As a marketer, when you know you don't have a home run theme, let people warm up to it and it will be received with much more enthusiasm.

[15:04] They won't do it though.

[15:05] They will not do it.

[15:06] So that's Jersey Jack.

[15:07] All right, American Pinball.

[15:08] I want to hear a funny rumor.

[15:10] So over at American Pinball, this comes from someone who's on the inside with people who work over there.

[15:15] So American Pinball and David Fix and the team over there, they ordered 500 tank turds.

[15:23] Okay, 500 tank turds.

[15:25] I don't even think turd is the right word for a tank.

[15:28] I think it's the nozzle, something like that.

[15:30] But they ordered 500 of them.

[15:32] Apparently Mukesh will not let them move on to another game until all of those freaking things are sold.

[15:40] Remember the rumors that like David Fix was saying they sold 2000 units of galactic tank force?

[15:46] They did not.

[15:47] And now it's looking like galactic tank force is selling less than some of their previous games.

[15:54] You know, I don't know the truth about the sales numbers of this game.

[15:57] I can tell you it's not good.

[15:59] You go into the galactic tank force owner's thread and what do you see?

[16:04] It's eight or nine pages long on a game that was revealed in March.

[16:08] Eight or nine pages.

[16:09] If you started a thread tomorrow that's like, I hate Canada.

[16:13] Who else does?

[16:14] It would be at like 30 pages in like two days.

[16:17] Okay, that's how infamous I am.

[16:19] Okay, but they got like nine pages.

[16:21] Nobody cares.

[16:22] Nobody's buying this game.

[16:24] There's no way to like get people reignited into this game.

[16:28] They overpriced it.

[16:30] They pissed people off with that signature edition of the game.

[16:33] It's like they're just living in their own world.

[16:36] They've had so many swings at the plate, American Pinball, and they've made every mistake you possibly can.

[16:42] And so the other thing I'm hearing is this.

[16:44] Remember when David Fix was going around and saying, hey, we're also going to make Barry O's game like his last game?

[16:50] Well, here's what I'm hearing that they are thinking of making Barry O's last game.

[16:55] And it's some version of food truck, but they can't call it food truck because of licensing reasons.

[17:02] And it's a single level game.

[17:04] I really hope this rumor is not true that they would even consider making a single level game based on

[17:11] a Barry O design that is based on a food truck game he designed at Deep Root Pinball.

[17:18] If this is even remotely true, everyone over there needs to have their head examined.

[17:24] Okay, because gang, what are you doing?

[17:27] You know what people want in Pinball.

[17:29] And then the other rumor I'm hearing is like Dennis Nordman is done with it.

[17:32] It's called like the son of Bigfoot or son of Yeti.

[17:35] It's one of those.

[17:36] It's probably son of Yeti.

[17:38] And it has all these ramps and it's got all this stuff and it would be so expensive to make that American Pinball is not going to make it.

[17:46] And that is why if you think about it, people think about why is Dennis Nordman not hyping Galactic Tank Force?

[17:54] Why is he nowhere to be found in helping American Pinball sell this game?

[17:59] Now it makes total sense.

[18:01] He's gone MIA because he's pissed off because they're not going to make his better game, which is the following game.

[18:08] Well, lesson learned for everybody.

[18:10] You never should have made Galactic Tank Force.

[18:13] You never should have gone down this road.

[18:15] Clearly it's not working and they've got to be smart.

[18:18] Like a whitewood or sequel would always be a better option than just a game about tanks in space with ice cream.

[18:26] Like what were they thinking?

[18:28] And then you want to charge people 17.5 for a freaking lunchbox in thermos.

[18:32] And I'm so happy that the Pinball community has slammed the door faster on this game than they slammed it on Canada people.

[18:40] Alright, so that's it. American Pinball.

[18:42] And then so what?

[18:43] So then they're going to have to get to Ryan McQuade's game.

[18:46] You know, this arcade video game comic book from the late 80s, early 90s, whatever that is because it's licensed.

[18:54] It sounds a lot better to me than Galactic Tank Force and it sounds a lot better to me than the son of Bigfoot or Yeti.

[19:02] But the problem is this now.

[19:04] I'm hearing Mukesh is not happy.

[19:06] And unless they get these Galactic Tank Forces sold, are we even going to get to Ryan McQuade's game?

[19:13] And look, the reason why we're speculating like this around American Pinball and it's not very positive is because where are they?

[19:22] Like where is the team over at American Pinball hyping this game, trying to sell this game?

[19:28] Like what are they doing?

[19:29] Like they've gone absolutely radio silent in the moment in which they need to get these games sold.

[19:35] And that is a huge red flag.

[19:38] Alright, speaking of red flags, uh-oh, Canada's going to talk about Haggis for a little bit people.

[19:43] So this is not a rumor.

[19:44] This is just a fact.

[19:45] So their marketing strategy to really center for like $19,000 and the Beast Edition for like $11,000 or $10,000, they did not sell out of either of those.

[20:00] And it's been a while now.

[20:01] I think people have learned their lesson.

[20:04] And this is what I'm hearing over at Haggis that there are basically four main employees that are putting these games together.

[20:11] And look, this is what I'm hearing.

[20:12] This is what I'm hearing from people over in Australia that have a little bit of a bone to pick.

[20:16] And here's the good news.

[20:17] If Damien wants to prove me wrong that there are more than four people inside Haggis Pinball on a weekly basis making these games, can you guess what he could do to prove me wrong that there are more than four people working at Haggis putting these machines together?

[20:34] He could maybe go live and walk around and introduce us to all those employees.

[20:39] He said he had, he said he had like 20 employees.

[20:42] I don't believe it.

[20:43] I don't buy it.

[20:44] Look how much he talked a few weeks ago when he wanted to take your money and look what's happened since and I don't buy it.

[20:51] And if this thing goes south people, you're going to come to me first and then like I should have listened to Canada and I'm not rooting for it to go south, but they still have yet to open up the door and show us what it is.

[21:03] And show us what's going on.

[21:05] Why is that?

[21:06] You know what he says like, oh, people are going to take it.

[21:08] No, no, we're not going to take it.

[21:09] How are we going to take showing us what's really going on the wrong way?

[21:13] When we got a tour of Dutch pinball, did we take it wrong?

[21:16] When we got a tour of spooky pinball, did we take it wrong?

[21:20] Heck, even Andrew McBain over at Freakin Pinball Adventures did a walk around.

[21:24] So if you want to ask people for $19,000, yeah, you got to walk around your joint and prove to us that what you said is true.

[21:32] Because I don't believe Marty and I don't believe Damien.

[21:35] I think they're spinning it all.

[21:37] I think it's only a matter of time before they're going to have to be real about it.

[21:40] And look, we know what the deadline is.

[21:42] They got to finish all the fathoms by the end of the year.

[21:44] And I'm telling you right now, it's not going to happen.

[21:46] It's not going to happen, people.

[21:48] All right, what else is going on?

[21:49] We got haggis.

[21:50] We got stern.

[21:51] Spooky pinball.

[21:52] Bug was streaming the Daphne mode of the game yesterday.

[21:55] Spooky pinball in the house.

[21:58] The game has had a lot of bugs.

[22:00] They're always working on the bug.

[22:01] It's kind of ironic, right?

[22:02] They got a guy kind of ironic that like Charlie's son is named Bug and there's a lot of bugs in the game.

[22:08] I mean, I don't know.

[22:09] Maybe they've been telegraphing to us how it's going to be owning a machine all these years.

[22:13] Look, you know this by now.

[22:15] When you buy a spooky machine, it's like buying a Jaguar.

[22:18] It's going to have problems.

[22:20] It's going to have issues.

[22:22] The quality is not going to be the same as everybody else's machines.

[22:25] There's one thing I want to ask Spooky Pinball to do because I was watching the Daphne mode and there was one thing.

[22:31] That's just annoying.

[22:33] It's a really fun mode.

[22:35] They've got a lot of fun clips from the show and they freaking put what you need to do in the mode in text across all the clips.

[22:44] It says like shoot the purple shots.

[22:46] Okay, just tell the player that once, but it stays up there during the entire mode.

[22:53] And every time there's a new clip of like Frankenstein chasing Daphne, the entire visual is ruined.

[22:59] Because you have the instruction for the mode appearing over the entire characters.

[23:04] Spooky, come on.

[23:06] Come on.

[23:07] Like, you know, I'm not even a graphic designer.

[23:09] I can just tell you that looks horrible.

[23:12] All you got to do is tell people what to do when the mode starts.

[23:16] Maybe have that up there until someone hits their first shot, but we don't need to be constantly reminded of what to do every time there's a new clip.

[23:24] Go look at Lyman's Batman 66.

[23:27] Let the clips play.

[23:29] Don't ruin the clips by having this font on an angle in front of all those assets you have.

[23:36] Alright, so speaking of Spooky Bimbo, another rumor for you guys.

[23:39] I hear they have the Evil Dead license.

[23:42] I know they have three licenses and I hear Evil Dead is one of them.

[23:47] And so Looney Tunes is also another one I heard they have.

[23:52] Maybe the trifecta that they have is Looney Tunes, The Princess Bride, and Evil Dead.

[23:59] Look, it's not a bad trilogy for a company that just needs to make like a thousand to fifteen hundred games.

[24:06] Out of those three themes, they will be able to sell that many games.

[24:11] What everyone's looking for from Spooky Moving Forward is just better quality.

[24:17] They need better software engineers so when they release these games, you don't feel like you're a guinea pig the whole first year of owning it.

[24:25] And they really need to get some mechanical engineers in-house and actually make a toy.

[24:31] I mean, that's just that simple.

[24:32] Like you need to be able to make a toy in a modern pinball machine when you're going to charge this much money.

[24:38] It's just table stakes now.

[24:40] I mean, that's the other thing too about Venom People.

[24:41] It's like you look down at that game.

[24:43] There's no real toy in it.

[24:44] It's like, come on, for ten to thirteen thousand dollars, you're not going to fool us with this.

[24:50] I mean, they made freaking Lord of the Rings like seventeen years ago and the toys are so much better in Lord of the Rings than in Venom.

[24:57] And Lord of the Rings was like four thousand dollars.

[25:00] I mean, we're not that stupid.

[25:02] Ah, did I miss anybody?

[25:04] Any rumors over at Chicago Gaming?

[25:06] No.

[25:07] So here's what's going to happen at Chicago Gaming.

[25:09] They're no longer making remakes.

[25:11] They're not going to be doing more of like Rick's Planetary Pinball Valley Williams remakes.

[25:16] The next game after Pulp Fiction is going to be a licensed theme game by Mark Ritchie.

[25:23] I heard it is sci-fi themed in nature.

[25:25] Is it gremlins?

[25:27] Is it Beetlejuice?

[25:29] What is it?

[25:30] It's got to be something really cool, but it's going to be a fully featured Mark Ritchie game.

[25:35] Seeing what they've done with a single level Pulp Fiction, I think that makes everybody excited.

[25:40] We're just looking for CGC to like get stuff out.

[25:43] I mean, that's where everybody else is.

[25:45] Just get it out.

[25:46] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[25:49] I hope you enjoyed this episode.

[25:51] It's a great time to be in pinball.

[25:53] It's a great time to be observing everything that's going on.

[25:56] I don't know about you, but I'm keeping my money in my wallet.

[26:00] A lot's going to happen.

[26:02] We're going to end this episode with a moment of silence for Don over at Don's Pinball podcast.

[26:09] I was ribbing him today.

[26:11] By the way, we're friends.

[26:12] This is all ingest, so don't be like, oh, Canada, it's his game.

[26:16] It's his money.

[26:17] How dare you know?

[26:18] This is not like Jengas taking his ball and going home.

[26:21] This is two grown men just having fun on a pinball topic.

[26:25] Don took his Elvira.

[26:27] I think it was an Elvira premium because there were no pros.

[26:31] He had it transformed into a makeshift Elvira 40th edition game.

[26:38] Only problem is it's not the accurate decals from Elvira 40th.

[26:43] And so the Lollipop rails are going over her name and it's just something that I don't think anyone should ever do.

[26:51] I told him, I'm like, bro, you're getting some credibility and then you make a move like this.

[26:56] You don't want to do it.

[26:57] You don't want to do it.

[26:58] You don't want to take decals from an LE or SLE and put them on a premium.

[27:03] It's like being a pinball poser.

[27:04] It's just, you don't do it.

[27:05] It's just something about it.

[27:06] It's like kids are used to put the V8 emblems on their Mustangs when it was a V6.

[27:11] It's like, who are you fooling?

[27:12] You're just making yourself look silly.

[27:15] So we're going to do this.

[27:16] We're going to have a little, let's do a 10 second moment of silence for Don's Pinball Podcast and his Elvira 40th that is not in Elvira 40th starting now.

[27:27] All right, everybody, go buy Galactic Tank Force.

[27:36] This is the best marketing they're going to get later.

[27:57] Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
