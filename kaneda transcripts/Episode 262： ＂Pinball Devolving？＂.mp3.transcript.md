[00:00] Welcome to episode 262 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:27] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:29] I've got a very simple topic I want to talk about on this episode.

[00:34] And the reason I want to talk about this is there's not a lot of news going on.

[00:38] And I think you know it.

[00:39] I think those of you who follow the hobby, you kind of understand we're in this little

[00:44] bit of a holding pattern.

[00:46] We're waiting for a lot of these new titles to come out.

[00:49] The ones that are shipping, they seem to be just trickling out, like barely making their

[00:55] way to customers.

[00:56] Barely.

[00:57] I mean, it seems like pirates of the Caribbean and Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castles games

[01:02] that were supposed to be out months ago are barely arriving into people's homes.

[01:08] And we all know that when people get them, the early adopters will just claim that they

[01:13] are playing the greatest game ever and it's so deep and there's so much to explore

[01:18] in every new pinball machine that you spend thousands of dollars on.

[01:23] So what I want to do on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast is I want to read an email

[01:28] I got because this email got me thinking and it was very well articulated.

[01:36] They were making a point and I want to read you this email and I want to discuss that

[01:41] on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast because I think this email really gets to

[01:47] something that a lot of us in this hobby deal with and a lot of the things that go on

[01:52] inside our head.

[01:53] And I think a very simple way to put it is is it worth it?

[01:58] Is it worth it the amount of money, the amount of energy, the amount of time that we dedicate

[02:05] to pinball and especially modern pinball.

[02:08] And I've raised the question many times on this podcast about the value of what modern

[02:14] pinball games are bringing to the pinball hobby as a whole.

[02:18] So let me read this email and then we will discuss what our thoughts are about this.

[02:25] So the subject of this email is modern pinball has devolved and I want to read what this says.

[02:35] All right.

[02:36] It says Hey Chris.

[02:38] I played some newer Stern pinball machines today along with some Jersey Jack and Valley

[02:43] Williams games.

[02:44] I have to admit the Stern pins feel like Walmart toys compared to the others like a cheap

[02:52] plastic feeling like seriously some shit I'd buy for my 12 year old nephew for Christmas.

[03:02] This leads into a bigger point of confusion for me.

[03:06] How in God's name is pinball surviving with the exception of the LCD.

[03:12] New Stern games are no more technologically advanced than games from the 90s.

[03:19] Yeah, the inner mechanics are improved and the wiring and boards have a smaller footprint.

[03:25] But from a pure gameplay standpoint, these modern day games have not evolved.

[03:32] Just like you point out the world and your glass sucks on most modern games.

[03:38] It's not a world.

[03:39] It's a few ramps, loops and scoops in a state the size of Delaware.

[03:46] So they slap on some cool artwork and choose themes that appeal to people receiving

[03:52] social security checks.

[03:55] Big deal for six to nine grand a pop.

[03:59] These freaking machines should do my laundry and my taxes.

[04:04] But a modern day pin looks less sophisticated than a 1993 Williams Star Trek the next generation.

[04:14] Put Deadpool next to Star Trek and cover up the scoreboards.

[04:19] I think a whole bunch of people who knew nothing about pinball would say the 1993 Star Trek

[04:27] was made in 2018 and Deadpool was the older machine.

[04:34] Yet Jersey Jack games feel more solid and have a bit more sophistication but still nothing

[04:41] mind blowing.

[04:43] We are in the year 2018 where the hell is the integration of modern day computer mechs

[04:50] and technology that make these suckers truly worth what they charge.

[04:57] P3 seems like they are at least trying though something is lacking on their side as well.

[05:03] Give us something that feels epic.

[05:06] I swear pinball is devolving not evolving and yet people continue to buy these things

[05:14] site unseen or without playing them.

[05:18] At the end of the day one eight thousand dollar game is one game.

[05:24] It's finite.

[05:25] It gets old.

[05:27] Why do people continue to shell out thousands for games they just don't get the

[05:33] job done.

[05:35] That just don't get the job done.

[05:37] I used to buy Williams 90s games when they were around fifteen hundred to two thousand

[05:42] each and that seemed crazy at the time.

[05:46] I remember when a game like Funhouse made in nineteen ninety blew my freaking mind.

[05:52] I liked to own a modern game but then I remind myself that I'm just not getting what

[05:57] I'm paying for.

[05:59] Usually when the game feels like a box of LEDs sold at target.

[06:04] Its awesome at Stern has kept pinball alive but at what cost?

[06:09] They've jacked up the prices while delivering less and less year after year.

[06:15] It's a double edge sword.

[06:17] I guess thankfully there's location pinball but let's be honest that's a rare occurrence.

[06:24] I can't see this absurdity lasting much longer.

[06:29] The bubble will burst and in a few years we will be looking back and asking what the hell

[06:36] were we thinking.

[06:39] Continue to preach the pinball truth.

[06:41] Alright well that was an email from Brian L. Brian thank you for writing in Brian Lyons.

[06:51] He wrote me that note.

[06:52] I want to talk about that on this episode of Canada's pinball podcast because I think

[06:57] Brian has a lot of very interesting points.

[07:01] I think a lot of us are living in a pinball world right now where we are satisfied with

[07:09] what we're getting if we don't look back.

[07:13] If we don't compare what used to be in pinball machines to what is currently in pinball

[07:19] machines.

[07:20] I think you can be pretty happy.

[07:21] I do.

[07:22] Maybe you turn off the past and you stop being nostalgic about the Valley Williams error

[07:27] games and you look at these machines solely for what they are.

[07:32] I still think there's fun to be had with these modern pinball games.

[07:35] The problem is this.

[07:37] The problem is what these games cost.

[07:40] It is really hard to stomach.

[07:42] It really is.

[07:43] It's hard to stomach the fact that three stern limited edition games will cost you.

[07:51] $27,000 for three stern early machines.

[07:58] You have Deadpool, Iron Maiden and Star Wars Ellie and you've paid $27,000 for that experience.

[08:09] It's almost like they don't want us to think about pinball collecting or the pinball hobby

[08:16] in that way.

[08:17] They really would like us to have short-term memory loss where every new game we sort of

[08:23] think about it as its own island, as its own experience.

[08:28] But I don't think you can look at pinball like that.

[08:30] I really don't.

[08:31] I think you have to look at the total amount of time and money we invest in these games.

[08:37] I have to say, it's hard because if you were to ask yourselves which game, all right,

[08:46] in 2018, delivers the most pinball magic.

[08:51] Magic.

[08:52] Which game?

[08:53] Which game seems the most innovative?

[08:55] Which game seems the most creative?

[08:58] Which one seems to be taking the most risks when it comes to engineering something you

[09:03] never seen before?

[09:06] And I have to say, I have to be honest.

[09:08] I haven't seen any pinball machine in a long time.

[09:13] I haven't seen anything before.

[09:16] And I think the real question is, is not which games today are delivering on the magic?

[09:24] The real question is, why are we continuing to buy and support and pay these prices when

[09:32] these games don't even come within a country mile of the kinds of innovations and engineering

[09:41] and world under glass items that used to be found in pinball machines?

[09:47] Why are these games costing three times as much with three times as little inside them?

[09:55] And it's at the point now where I think we all literally are acting like, well, we'll

[10:02] just take what we get because we're happy that pinball is back.

[10:07] And I think the point that Brian's making is, what is the point?

[10:12] What is the point of pinball surviving if pinball stays the same?

[10:18] And not even that, what is the point of pinball surviving if new pinball games go backwards,

[10:25] devolve, give you less, but charge you much more?

[10:30] What is the point of that?

[10:31] Is it making pinball more fun?

[10:34] Is it introducing pinball to a whole new market?

[10:37] Is it expanding pinball into a new generation?

[10:41] I don't think so.

[10:42] I'm not convinced that that is the case.

[10:45] All I think is really happening, and I think Brian says this as well, is we're all thinking

[10:51] about this very short term.

[10:54] I think a lot of money and a lot of people are going to learn the hard way that this really

[11:01] wasn't the wisest thing to do to spend lots of money over like a five year period, buying

[11:11] all these machines, thinking they were going to hold value.

[11:14] And I don't think you can not talk about the depreciation of pinball games.

[11:22] I don't think you can be in any hobby where you're buying something that you will get

[11:27] bored of.

[11:28] And because let me ask you guys a question in this way, when you buy a watch and you collect

[11:35] a rare watch, do you get bored of the watch or will it remain in your interest for a long

[11:41] period of time?

[11:42] I'm not so sure, right?

[11:43] Because a watch is not like a game.

[11:45] You're not playing it.

[11:46] It simply is an item of fashion.

[11:49] It is something of style and of design.

[11:52] So you might get bored.

[11:53] You might not.

[11:54] Getting bored of something is also a subjective journey.

[11:57] But a pinball machine is a game.

[12:00] And it is a game where what makes it exciting is getting through the game and getting through

[12:05] the modes and seeing what the game does and exploring the code, exploring the design.

[12:11] But ultimately we all know that every game will get boring.

[12:15] And that you will reach a period where you want a new gaming experience.

[12:20] Okay.

[12:21] So when a game is two to three thousand dollars, playing it, enjoying it, moving on to the

[12:28] next, not so bad, not so bad.

[12:31] But six to nine thousand, twelve thousand, five hundred, fifteen thousand dollars for the

[12:39] Batman I'm looking at.

[12:41] I mean, it's really hard.

[12:44] It's really hard to see where that money went into these machines.

[12:49] So then it begs the question, is anyone trying to do it differently?

[12:54] You know, here's the thing that I just can't get over in this hobby is so you've got

[12:59] Stern and Stern was never making the best pinball machines back in pinball's heyday.

[13:05] They weren't.

[13:06] They just survived.

[13:10] Okay.

[13:11] They didn't win the pinball war.

[13:14] They just survived it.

[13:17] Valley Williams was by far running circles around anything daddy east or Stern was putting

[13:24] into market.

[13:25] I mean, it was laughable how much better Valley Williams was than the games coming from

[13:32] Stern and daddy east and then the games that they were making.

[13:37] And so Valley Williams decides there's no more money to be made in pinball.

[13:42] We're making, you know, slot machines and gambling devices.

[13:46] And they closed the pinball division.

[13:48] We've all seen the story.

[13:50] We all see how they tried to make pin 2K and it all flopped and all that jazz.

[13:55] But Stern just survived.

[13:58] And the problem is now is that you have the biggest company in the world making pinball,

[14:05] taking most of your pinball dollars.

[14:07] And it's not like they earned, right, because they were making, they didn't get to the top

[14:13] because they made the best and ended up there.

[14:16] They got to the top because the best around them just closed their doors.

[14:20] So they survived it and look, you have to give them credit for that survival.

[14:25] All right.

[14:26] I don't mean to like diminish what they did.

[14:29] And Stern did survive that error because they did make some phenomenal games.

[14:35] Lord the Rings, right, Simpsons.

[14:39] The games, you know, they're not those games I think hold up in terms of fun factor

[14:46] in terms of theme integration, in terms of world under glass, like those games gave you so much.

[14:52] And what I'm saying is here we are so many years later, so many years later,

[14:58] wouldn't you expect?

[15:00] Wouldn't you expect the mechanisms, the engineering, the innovation in today's game?

[15:08] Wouldn't you expect to see what you find on that play field to be far more advanced

[15:14] and far more magical than what you found in a Lord of the Rings,

[15:20] than what you found in a Simpsons pinball party, than what you found in an ACDC,

[15:26] than what you found in a Metallica.

[15:29] Like where is the progression?

[15:32] Where is the evolution?

[15:34] And that is what Brian is saying, is that they're going backwards.

[15:40] They're taking stuff out.

[15:41] I mean Iron Maiden, for all of its glory, when you look down at Iron Maiden,

[15:47] what's in it?

[15:49] Really, like what is in that game?

[15:52] Not much.

[15:53] Great design, great flow, great artwork, but what's in it?

[16:00] And I think people are starting to see that more and more, and I think people's expectations

[16:05] of what to, what they expect to find in a modern,

[16:10] and a modern, and so low right now.

[16:12] Look at Deadpool, for example.

[16:14] Have you ever seen the hype on a game within the community just sort of dissipate so quickly?

[16:22] And it's not people saying that they think Deadpool's good or bad,

[16:27] even though I really, really do recommend you go listen to Zack's review and the

[16:34] straight down, and Zack and Greg's review over our straight down the middle.

[16:37] Excellent, excellent review of the game.

[16:39] Very fair, very honest.

[16:42] But everyone keeps coming back to the same thing.

[16:45] It's like there's not much there.

[16:48] Not much there.

[16:49] And some of it really, really looks like just corner cutting,

[16:54] like very, very overly simplistic design.

[16:58] And that works when your game is $2,000.

[17:01] It doesn't work when your game is $6,000 to $9,000.

[17:05] And so we're all being hoodwinked with artwork and with lights and with LCD screens,

[17:15] which are the cheapest things to put in a pinball game.

[17:20] You know how much an LCD cost?

[17:22] I bet Stern's cost per LCD is less than $100.

[17:27] I mean, seriously, LCD screens cost nothing now.

[17:31] And so sure there's money that has to go into coding these machines.

[17:35] But then you look at a pinball machine graphics and you're like these graphics,

[17:39] they're worse than video games from 20 years ago.

[17:42] So that doesn't, they're not even on par with where graphics are and displays are.

[17:50] In 2018.

[17:51] In fact, it's embarrassingly bad that you can put a high definition image on that LCD

[17:56] and you look at some of the quality of these LCD animations.

[18:01] I mean, Jersey Jack's obviously putting a much nicer package up on the screen.

[18:06] But even them too much on the screen, not enough magic on the play field.

[18:12] Jack's trying harder.

[18:14] No one would deny it that Jersey Jack is trying to do it and trying to give you the Bally Williams

[18:22] magic. But here's the thing that they fail to do it.

[18:27] I don't think any Jersey Jack machine really comes close to delivering the kind of magic

[18:36] that Bally Williams games had.

[18:38] The only game that comes close to, in my opinion, that really, really comes close is dialed in.

[18:44] Which isn't really a Jersey Jack game and there's pat lawlers game that Jersey Jack sort of like

[18:49] commission to make. And then I would probably say Wizard of Oz was number two with all the stuff

[18:54] that that balls are put into that game. And think about it though.

[19:00] Wizard of Oz was originally $6,000. Maybe $6,500. Did that put them at a business? Who knows?

[19:11] Maybe possibly. But Stern games are now selling hand over fist for $9,000 for $7,500.

[19:20] And this whole notion that I can't shake this feeling and I've been thinking about it

[19:26] on the walk home from work today. Why is it that regardless of what's in that pinball machine?

[19:33] Right? Regardless of what's in that Stern Ely, it's going to be $9,000. Regardless,

[19:40] it's like no matter what's in it, no matter what the bomb is, no matter what the materials are,

[19:46] it's $9,000. And so I just have a problem with that. I have a problem if you put

[19:53] Deadpool, next to Star Wars, next to Batman 66, next to Erasmith,

[20:02] all put all the Ely's next to each other and say, all right, every one of these games is the same

[20:07] price. And then there's not the same consistency in what's put into those games. Now look,

[20:16] I think what Stern does, and I think the way Stern is driven these days, is because they're driven

[20:22] by their investors. We don't talk about that. We don't. We hold up on pedestals, the designers,

[20:30] we hold up the coders, we hold up the artists. But at the end of the day, Stern is driven and Stern

[20:38] is led by the investors. This company has investors that Stern has to answer to on every game made,

[20:50] and you can't deny or ignore the fact that these games are designed to a cost.

[20:58] All right, I don't think they're designed to a creative aspiration. I don't think they're designed

[21:06] to be as innovative and magical as possible. Do you really feel that? You feel that? You look at

[21:12] Deadpool and you're telling me that that game looks like they really took a risk,

[21:17] all right, or they really went out there and tried something new. All right,

[21:21] when's the last time we saw something, they're like really, really new. I feel like the last thing

[21:25] that just at least felt new, even though it wasn't, it was kind of like an old mech from another

[21:30] one of his games, was the hyperdrive in Star Wars. But at least when you look down, you're like, wow,

[21:36] okay, it's got something in it that really is cool and different and fun to watch. Watch those

[21:43] balls zip around. I've got this feeling, okay, I've got this feeling deep down that we're going to

[21:53] disappoint it with monsters. Because think about it, we're already like, yeah, monsters,

[21:58] gonna be amazing. Why is it gonna be amazing? Why do we always project onto any future pinball machine?

[22:08] This feeling of euphoria, this feeling of magic is, the next game is always where the most magic

[22:17] is gonna happen because in our heads, we grow up in a world in which we expect advancement,

[22:24] right? When you expect the new iPhone to come out, you expect there to be updates and innovation

[22:30] that makes the newer version better than the previous version. The same thing is true in the

[22:36] automotive world, the same thing is true in the video game world. In almost every aspect of life,

[22:44] we expect time to equal an increase in innovation, value, and progress. And I just don't feel that

[22:55] from pinball right now. And it kind of bums me out. I definitely think the artwork has definitely

[23:03] improved. But this, but artwork is not an innovation. Artwork is not progress. Great artists have

[23:11] been around for centuries. Okay? This is not new. The fact that people were spending the money they

[23:19] were on crappy drag and drop Photoshop art, that just, I think that showed them how little they had

[23:29] a give to get your money. And I think what's happened over the last five years has simply been in

[23:36] an experiment on how much can they yank out and still charge what they do? How much can they not

[23:43] deliver and still sell games outside unseen? And they know they've got a rabbit frenzy buyer base

[23:54] who all they need to do is just do enough and they will separate you from your money. And I am

[24:03] here to tell you today. What is it? September 17th 2018. I don't know about you guys, but I'm

[24:11] really getting to the point where I'm just getting bored. I'm bored of always seeing the same

[24:19] expected approach to these modern games. And I'm kind of like, I don't even know what the answer

[24:29] is because I don't think the answer is like a complete reimagination of pinball like P3. But I also

[24:37] to me, to me, the answer is a combination of the kinds of worlds Valley Williams gave us

[24:47] with the modern advancements and the progress in how to code a game. All right, those two things,

[24:55] if they could marry those two things, to me, that is pinball and Irvana. All right. And then I would

[25:03] love for companies to figure out really magical and interesting mechanisms to put into games.

[25:13] Not lazy, weird to look at sort of just slapping LCDs onto games the way like it, like when I look

[25:22] at alien, I'm like this, that looks so stupid with a big black screen in the middle of the play field.

[25:28] When I look at Star Wars, how dumb does it look that there's that LCD screen there just for no other

[25:33] reason than just laziness? You know, when I even when I look down at the compass and Pirates of the

[25:39] Caribbean, I don't mean that. I don't mean just like dropping tech onto a game. I mean like a

[25:48] device or something in the game that makes you want to say, hey, look at what this does. Okay?

[25:57] And like would actually be impressive to show someone who didn't even know anything about pinball.

[26:03] You know, it's like when we talked to Robert Mueller about Magic Girl and he says that they think

[26:07] they finally figured out what John was going for and how to make the ball levitate.

[26:13] And but then he was quickly like, I'm not sure it's going to be in the game. But it's that kind of

[26:18] ambition. It's that kind of magic. You know, mad scientists, I want a mad scientist to tell me what

[26:27] he can do with a pinball machine. Do you really feel like over at Stern, the guy who's got the crazy

[26:34] ideas gets the funding? Do you feel that way at Jersey Jack now? Look, I mean, I've talked probably

[26:41] too much just about Stern, but look at Jersey Jack. They got ambitious. They tried to make the three

[26:47] rings work. And instead of making them work, they just yanked them out. Instead of making the treasure

[26:52] trunk open and close, they just yanked it out. And I'm sorry, but to me, that's the problem.

[27:01] Is everything else now left in the game? I mean, really? Do you think about it? What is going on

[27:06] in Pirates of the Caribbean that makes you go, wow, a rocking upper play field? Cool. But let me tell

[27:14] you what's not cool about that thing. It's like when the ball just falls off the right side, it is

[27:18] like the lamest thing happening in a cool section that's new. You know, and so like, I don't know.

[27:28] I really, I just don't know why for this much money, anybody should feel unsatisfied or

[27:36] unfulfilled. And yet, I just get this feeling that the best pinball machines are

[27:45] yesterday's machines. And somehow, if we could just get what went into those games with the

[27:52] modern coding that's available that gives these games enough replay value for the whole market,

[27:58] to me, that's where the sweet spot is. And I don't know, what do you think? Do you think I'm being

[28:05] off? Do you think I'm being too critical? Do you think I'm just acting this way because I'm

[28:09] bored during a slow news week? I don't know. I don't know. I just can't shake this feeling

[28:17] that you could line up three stern alleys and tell someone that that costs $27,000.

[28:22] And the only way to justify it is you would bring up the resell value. I just don't think

[28:29] people are going to get nearly the amount of money back on these games that they would have

[28:35] years ago when a lot of new people were coming into the hobby because I just don't think the experience

[28:42] is reflected in how much we're asking to pay for these machines. And I'm always like on the fence

[28:50] because I know we live in a modern world where other things cost equally as much without as much going

[28:56] on. I mean, you can go by, you know, you can go by a million things. It costs as much as a

[29:01] pinball machine with not as much complexity in it. But again, like I think if you're in a judge

[29:08] pinball, you have to judge it within the context of what we used to get, how much it used to cost,

[29:16] and what we currently get and what it currently costs. And you ask yourselves, does this feel like

[29:22] we're living in the era where like the best pinball machines are coming out? Or are we simply

[29:28] being forced to just take what we get? You know, I hear it all the time. It's like I hear it when

[29:34] Charlie talks like, why can't everyone just be nice about the games? Why does anyone ever say

[29:40] they don't like a game that they're not going to buy? And I just, I don't know. I mean, I don't want to

[29:45] live in a world where we just consider this to be the best that we can do with pinball. And that's

[29:53] it. I mean, that's just the thought I wanted to discuss on this episode of 262. Do you think this

[30:02] is the best pinball can be? Do you think we're living in a golden age of pinball where 10 years from

[30:09] now, 20 years from now, people will look back and say, you know what, it was that era where they

[30:13] really made the best pinball machines? Or do you think we will never get back there? And it's really

[30:22] hard to recreate when it went on at belly Williams. I mean, I literally, you just can't, you can't

[30:29] recreate that. And even though there's a lot of leftover individuals from that era, I think what's

[30:34] pretty apparent is the kind of support and the kind of outside the box thinking that went on at

[30:41] that company. And I think they just did a lot of competition that happened at that company

[30:46] for each designer to one up each other and to steal the quarters from arcade goers. And it's

[30:53] much different climate when you're trying to make a game that literally is trying to stop someone

[30:59] in their tracks in a crowded arcade and be, you know, be wowed by what they see in front of them

[31:07] and to get them to put a quarter in. They weren't designing those games to sell to

[31:12] frolics and home collectors. They were designing those games to compete in crowded arcades. And

[31:20] that meant that they had to do amazing stuff to get people's attention. And I think the problem

[31:27] today with the home collectors being the driving force is Stern has realized that the home pinball

[31:33] buyer, the home collector is pretty much, you know, kind of an idiot. Like they really,

[31:40] like they literally know they're making something that they can strip stuff out, that they can get

[31:47] people to buy it without ever seeing it, get people to buy it without ever playing it, get people

[31:52] to hype up their new games before they even seeing it. And by the time it comes out,

[31:57] there's such a desire to own it that people don't even stop and ask themselves if it's even worth it.

[32:04] There's not a lot of pinball reviews out there that are good like straight down the middle.

[32:10] There's like 30 pinball podcasts out there where people are just obsessed and nonstop talking

[32:15] about pinball. But, you know, Stern has it so easy. They don't really have competition. They're

[32:21] competition has done nothing but gone out of business and fumbled games and themes and products.

[32:27] I mean, Jersey Jack went out of business like three times. They've yet to ever even come close

[32:34] to becoming the company that they said they were going to be. Andrew Highway never came close to

[32:38] becoming the company he wanted. Dutch pinball, another failure. Right, spooky pinball is like the only

[32:44] one that sort of, you know, held true to their word and made what they could and delivered what

[32:49] they said. But, but everyone knows that spooky games are not nearly as good as even Sterns. And

[32:54] then what is that saying? If you're going to go boutique, you know, it's like I was saying this

[32:58] to someone today, who chooses to go boutique low end? Like you don't go boutique low end?

[33:06] You go boutique when you when you become like bespoke and make the thing better. You make it limited

[33:11] and better. But just to make it somewhat average game and say, well, it's the best we could do,

[33:18] support pinball. Please don't say anything. Me and about my game like, whoop. That's not an

[33:24] evolution. You know, we're devolving when we get to that point where we're just, we're just playing

[33:30] and buying these machines to support the industry. We're not even really asking ourselves if it's worth

[33:35] it. Right? I mean, P3 is still struggling to get what 50 games made in six, seven years out into

[33:42] consumer homes. I saw one went up for sale and a guy was like already taking a thousand on our

[33:47] loss on it. I don't even know if it's sold Chicago gaming company. Heck yeah, because they're just

[33:53] making the stuff they know people love, but there's not real innovation going on there. And it's hard

[34:00] not to be a little disappointed. So where is the next mad scientist? Where is the next John

[34:07] Papaduke? Where is the next Pat Lawler? Where are they? Is it all up to them? There are nine

[34:16] billion people on this planet and you can't tell me that we can't find new creative thinkers to lend

[34:26] their creative ideas to the world of pinball. Look at Zen pinball. Look how innovative a lot of

[34:34] those designs are. Look how fun the world underclasses. I get that it's digital pinball,

[34:40] but I'm always wondering could the people who design these Zen games? Could they ever partner up

[34:47] with physical pinball engineers and figure out a way to do it? Now the hard part is like how do you

[34:53] do it and do it to a cost? Because maybe you could make a world that's as magical and as

[34:59] awesome as Star Trek the next generation in 2018 and have all that that game had in there.

[35:05] But how do you do it when your volume of machine is three to five thousand at best? When back

[35:12] then they could have sold 12,000, 15,000, 20,000 games. So they could invest in making all those

[35:19] mechanisms, but now you can't. And look I'm going to say this and then I'm going to like just

[35:24] shut up and give you guys your night back. I would rather spend 12,000, 15,000 dollars

[35:35] on a magical holy fuck world underclass game with incredible everything. I would rather

[35:44] just have two of those games. All right. Two of those games that would cost that much,

[35:50] but there'd be that much in it. I'd rather have those games. Two of them, then three Stern Elise.

[36:00] Right? Then three Jersey Jack games. There's just not that game that has come out in a super,

[36:11] super long time that has made people say holy shit. That's pinball magic on all fronts,

[36:20] on all cylinders. And for what we pay, we should get the fucking magic. All right. You think it's

[36:29] going to be monsters? You think it's going to be beetles? Where do you guys see beetles? It is so far

[36:34] in the wrong direction of magic. I mean, I just whatever. It's all going to be about license and art,

[36:40] license and art. Put Franchi, put zombie Eddie, put dirty Donnie. Let's cover these things in beautiful

[36:46] art and sell people expensive movie posters without anything going on in the game. That's what

[36:51] you're going to get. I mean, that is exactly what you're going to get. And it's just like, it's unreal.

[37:00] It's unreal that the mech department people are like taking vacations while the art department

[37:06] is working over time because art never breaks. Code doesn't break. But it also doesn't wow

[37:17] the same way. It just doesn't. What is another thing? What's the art on Star Trek? The next generation.

[37:26] Exactly. I don't fucking know. But I but I have a visual in my head of all the awesome stuff in

[37:32] that game. All the amazing mechs in that game. I can't tell you what the art is. It doesn't matter.

[37:39] The world is there. Right? Look at Deadpool. Strip away the art on Deadpool. Strip it away.

[37:47] That's what you're left with. $9,000 for that. Okay, because here's the thing. You spent $9,000

[37:55] on Deadpool LA. Get the same art. Same exact art as the guy who spent $5,000 on it. Same art.

[38:06] On the play field. Oh wait, different artwork on the cabinet. So what? If they had put the LA cabinet

[38:13] art on the pro machine and the pro art on the LA machine, nobody would have been like, what the hell?

[38:18] No, you can't because that's the thing is like you you don't see like three times the detail or

[38:23] three times the work on those pieces of art. And my point earlier, each machine's $9,000 or $7,500

[38:33] regardless how good it is. When you go by a Ferrari, here's a car you meant for you. Is every Ferrari

[38:39] the same price? No. You pay more when you get more. You pay less when you get less. But this whole

[38:46] model of like every L.E. is the same price regardless of your game, the consistent stuff in it.

[38:53] It's stupid. We're all stupid. All right, that's it. That's it. No news. No, no monster bash remake.

[39:03] Nobody knows where Alice Cooper is. Why isn't it in people's homes yet? Nobody knows where Pirates

[39:08] the Caribbean is. Like how many they make in a day? Like it's like they're making like one a week.

[39:13] You know, nobody knows. Monsters, I bet you monsters comes out in November. They're not going to

[39:18] go to Expo with it. They always do this stern. They love fucking Expo over. They love it. So what

[39:25] we're going to see like October fest. And you look, you could say Chris, what are you doing?

[39:30] You're bitching a moan in. But Joe Balser and Josh Cougula are they're going to make a game with

[39:35] a lot more in it, just like they did with Houdini. And you know what? I hope they do. I think they

[39:41] put a lot more in Houdini than is even in Deadpool or Iron Maiden or any of the recent sterns. They just

[39:48] fucked up the design on it. Everybody wanted to like Houdini more than they did. It's because they

[39:54] fucked up the design and they got the art all wrong. All right, I'll say it. That art package on

[39:59] that game, it's not good. It's not good. But you want the game to be fun too. Don't make it frustrating.

[40:08] Just simple things in Pimble. Fun magic. I don't want to come home and be frustrated all night long

[40:14] while Rodo Dave keeps telling me everything's tight but makeable. I don't want that.

[40:19] All right. Look October fest, if it shoots great, if it's got amazing stuff in it, if it's humorous,

[40:25] of course it can be. Of course it can be a great game. It's always going to have a difficult time

[40:31] selling because of theme. But that's why they have to make it that good. All right, they have to

[40:36] make it that much better. And they know that. They these guys are not stupid. They know that.

[40:42] They have to know that or they are not going to survive. I think Spooky Pimble is in trouble.

[40:49] I think Charlie is in trouble. What I mean by that is these companies, they need to play the long

[40:56] game. You need to constantly be building a buyer base and surviving because the word of mouth on

[41:03] your product is stellar. I think he's nervous. I do. I just got this sense. Even when he pulled

[41:10] the curtain off the machine from day one, Chuck has been nervous about this game. For those of you

[41:16] who were there at T.P.F. when he revealed this game, he could barely string together a few sentences

[41:20] about it. He just seemed really nervous. He's very insecure about these games. I don't think he

[41:26] ever feels like he's nailed it. And I think he kind of knows it. Right. He was never insecure about

[41:32] TNA because he knew people already loved it. But he's got to win people over, especially in a

[41:38] world where he's locking people into their deposits. I think you guys all feel it. It's like the post.

[41:46] It's like summers over. Another year has gone by. Another year in which we never really got

[41:53] that Wow machine that everyone is buying, loving and just beyond ecstatic with. I mean, I would think

[42:02] if I had a pick, which machine succeeded the most? And again, I say this, but I still think it's

[42:10] missing so much of what I would want at a pinball machine is Iron Maiden. I think at least because

[42:18] the design was original and at least because it's just something that felt different. And it was

[42:26] different because it wasn't a stern machine. And you know, it's John Borgen delivered you a

[42:33] machine that doesn't feel like every other stern machine. We'll see. All right. All right,

[42:40] everyone email me at canadapimballadgmail.com. Happy to read your emails on air. Look, a single email

[42:47] can turn into an entire podcast from me. A single email. I just hope we get the magic back.

[42:55] That's really it. I really do. I'm just I'm just worried for you guys spending all this money all

[43:03] the time and thinking that it's worth it. I don't know. I just feel like it's not that that's just me.

[43:09] I wouldn't do it. If I woke up and I looked inside my game room and I had like $80,000 in like

[43:15] modern pinball machines, I'd be like, what the fuck was I thinking? I think Brian might be on to

[43:20] something. Everyone have a great night. I look forward to getting your emails or not getting your

[43:26] emails. Either way, I do still love the hobby, but I do. I want to see things get better. I do. I

[43:33] think we're getting a lot of lazy cookie cutter shit. And they listen to this podcast and I that's

[43:39] where we're at. Give me something that looks like it's fucking worth nine grand and I'll give you my

[43:44] $9,000 tomorrow. Have a good night everyone.

[43:50] This song is dedicated to Taylor Eller.

[43:56] We love you.

[43:59] And may you rest in peace.
