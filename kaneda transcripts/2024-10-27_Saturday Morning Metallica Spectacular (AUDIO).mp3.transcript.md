[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome. I'm just an ordinary, dimmy guy.

[00:13] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to the Canada Saturday morning Metallica Spectacular.

[00:24] One lucky club member who is a member of the Canadian club is gonna get a chance

[00:28] to buy a Metallica LE remastered for MSRP. The rules are very simple. You have to have been

[00:37] a Canadian club member before entering. You have to give me your name and phone number,

[00:42] and then you have to pick up your phone when we pull your name out of a hat. I'm looking at right

[00:48] now a list of names. I've got something like 47 names here. I'm not gonna show you the numbers so

[00:54] you can start prank calling my club members, but it's gonna be a fun day. Thank you, Brian Kaza's

[01:00] here, Lord Olaf. I mean, we got people from all over the world. We've got some people on Facebook.

[01:05] We've got some people on YouTube. We're doing it both ways. I wanted to open this up to everybody.

[01:11] So this show today is a special show because it's not behind any paywall. I want everybody to see

[01:19] this Goodwill gesture. I think it's good. I heard your feedback when I went to go flip this game

[01:24] for a profit just to see where the market was. People lost their mind. They absolutely lost

[01:30] their mind. They're like, you're not allowed to, Canada. Make a few bucks on a scalp of a game.

[01:36] I get it. I get it. Everyone was happy to see me lose like $2,000 on Toy Story, $1,000 on Ultraman.

[01:44] For those of us in the pinball space, speculating on games and their value is an age-old tradition.

[01:51] I don't know what the big deal is. What's the big deal? If I buy Netflix stock at $200 and it goes

[01:57] up to $400 or $500 or $600, do I have to sell it to you at $200? Yeah, I guess you do in the pinball

[02:03] world, but I do understand that with this audience and with my voice in this hobby, I do have a

[02:10] responsibility to set an example. I think everyone is over the world of scalping and flipping and

[02:19] making money that way, taking the game from someone who's a fan who really wants it. I heard that.

[02:27] I heard that loud and clear. Now, if you're on Facebook, you can come over to the YouTube channel.

[02:33] It is also public. Let me post it in the page two so people know they can go there. Let me just go

[02:41] on Facebook right now and let everybody know. We're also on YouTube and we're going to have

[02:48] some fun today. We're going to also talk about what's going on in the hobby because we're not

[02:51] doing the drawing until 11 o'clock. I am hopefully killing and will be back from the supermarket

[03:00] because I would love for him to be the one who pulls the name out of the hat. That's going to be a

[03:06] lot of fun. We're also on YouTube. Yay. Let's post that. We might have a surprise guest join the show

[03:17] today. We'll see what happens. Thanks for what I shared about Back to the Future. We're going to

[03:23] talk about that. We're going to talk about everything going on in pinball. It's what we do on

[03:27] Canadian Pinball Podcast. I'm super happy to spend that time at Expo and meet people and hear rumors

[03:35] and get ready for the next wave of games in pinball. I think everyone is feeling that right

[03:43] now. We're in that little bit of a limbo period. Avatar hasn't really caught on. People are not

[03:51] loving the game and ordering it left and right. Unless your name is Joe Abadi, you're not going

[03:56] to bat for Avatar. As you know, I think the game just needs to wake up in the software department.

[04:02] I think Keith Johnson has coded a game that has a lot, I think, in it, but I don't think it has a

[04:09] lot of feels and a lot of emotion and a lot of energy and a lot of excitement. I think the

[04:16] challenge with Avatar now, when you start making all those inserts, the Navi language,

[04:22] nobody knows what you're talking about. Nobody knows. Multi-ball, it's all these weird names.

[04:28] We just don't click with the vernacular of Avatar. The way we do with Star Wars. If I'm doing Beggar's

[04:36] Run or Millennium Falcon, we're going to Dagobah. Those things matter. I don't even think the

[04:43] Hallelujah Mountains make anybody feel anything. I also think the game just didn't put

[04:52] mechanical wow in it at all. I think the lower playfields are underwhelming. I think that there

[05:01] should have been more of an upper playfield, Hallelujah Mountains. I think they should have

[05:07] done something similar to the Star Wars hyperdrive. They should have had something where it felt like

[05:15] you were getting on a Banshee and you were flying around Pandora. So much of the game is just not

[05:23] translating that. The consumers are speaking. It's not just Canada. I think a lot of people out

[05:29] there are realizing too that those $15,000 CEs of Avatar are going to be closer to $10,000,

[05:37] especially as we go into the spring of next year and Harry Potter is coming out. I keep telling

[05:44] everybody, if you like Avatar, just wait. They're going to make a thousand of those CEs and you're

[05:50] going to be able to pick one up at a wholesale price. If you really want an Avatar CE, why wouldn't

[05:57] you just wait and save like $3,000 to $5,000? Now, a tale of two games because the one game

[06:04] that's going in the opposite direction is Metallica LE. This game is probably the best

[06:12] stern launch since Godzilla. I think the demand for Metallica remastered LE is actually greater

[06:23] than the demand was for Godzilla. I think only making 500 was a very smart move by Stern Pimbal.

[06:31] In just one move, they've restored sort of the FOMO and the frenzy and the excitement around in

[06:39] LE and they really needed to do that. We hadn't felt that with John Wick. We didn't feel it with

[06:47] Jaws was like, all right, but not really hard. It was not hard to get a Jaws LE. Now I'm seeing

[06:54] Jaws LE's sell for $12,000, $11,000, $5,000. They're losing value. There's just no way around it.

[07:01] They're losing value, but Metallica LE, I don't think it's ever going to sell for less than $13,000.

[07:07] I've had offers north of $17,000 for the game. I'm about to give someone here for $13,000.

[07:13] It's interesting. I just want to just say this for the record. I literally left $5,000

[07:20] on the table with this game. I charge people $5 a month to do a podcast. When you sell a game

[07:30] like this, you're not declaring these things on your taxes when you do a scalp, right?

[07:34] Legitimately, one sale of a Metallica LE for me is equivalent to all the hard work I do

[07:43] over two months, because I have to pay the government with my taxes on Patreon.

[07:48] Two months worth of work I could have made up in one flip of Metallica and everybody got mad.

[07:56] I just want to say I'm doing the right thing. It's not lost on me how much money dealers and

[08:10] distros can make you come on. You know there's dealers out there again who are holding some of

[08:14] these back. In a month or two, look what I got, new in box Metallica LE, $19,000. That's what's

[08:22] going to happen. Look and Stern can't stop it. It's a market adjusted price and I would say the

[08:28] market price on this game is north of $17,000 right now. Look, I think it's a good thing because I

[08:34] think most people who buy it aren't going to sell it. I think most people who buy this game are big

[08:40] fans. They were fans of the original. I think the value of the originals is going to go down for

[08:46] sure. As I told my friends at Stern Pimbal, I think next time they do this, the smart move would

[08:53] have been to try to identify diehard Metallica fans who bought the original one and still own it

[09:01] after 12 years. Those people should have had first dibs at the new game. I think a lot of them

[09:09] sort of waited on the sideline and pretended their dirty Donnie version is nicer. It's not.

[09:15] Now it's too late for a lot of them. I think they all should have listened to Canada and just got

[09:20] their name on a list. Look, if you got one and you just listened to me, I just handed you $5,000.

[09:29] It legitimately, there's no other way to cut this. I just handed you a $5,000 stock tip that you could

[09:37] exercise all day long. You're welcome. I think people got confused about my wait and see approach

[09:45] to Pimbal. Yeah, wait and see on almost everything. I always say this on almost everything. Don't wait

[09:53] and see on a super hot game like this because you're going to get locked out. You're going to regret it.

[09:58] The only way you're going to be able to get one is if you spend more money. That's where we're at

[10:04] right now with Metallica LE. I think the game is great. I think it's beautiful. I also think people

[10:11] need to realize that Spike 3 is coming. So when Spike 3 comes and Spike 3 enhances what a stern

[10:20] experience is, better sound, better lights, better screen, better everything, better internet

[10:26] connectivity, everything's going to be better. I think that's going to knock Metallica down a

[10:31] little bit. I think people are going to have hoped it would have been the first Spike 3 game.

[10:36] It was planned to be the first Spike 3 game, but they didn't have it ready in time. I still think

[10:43] Spike 3, King Kong, Keith Elwin is what's going to happen. Brian Eddy's Dungeons & Dragons will be next.

[10:51] We talked on my show this week about Back to the Future and how Dutch Pimbal would have an

[10:58] Herculane task to fulfill the demand for the orders they would get for Back to the Future.

[11:07] Yes, Dutch has been talking to Stern, to Jersey Jack. They've been seen in the building.

[11:15] And you know me, I think Stern should make the game. I think Barry would be a hero,

[11:21] and I think that's the right thing to do. I don't think Jersey Jack would make a better Back to the

[11:27] Future than Stern. And if Stern had one of their amazing designers like Danger or Elwin do it,

[11:35] I think a modern-day classic would be born. If Jersey Jack did it, I just don't know.

[11:42] Maybe Steve Ritchie would be the one to go with, but I'm not sure. Even with Steve,

[11:49] you know, Elton John is kind of a recycled idea of older games. We haven't seen Steve really wow us

[11:58] in a really long time. He played a safe bet with Elton. It's a bet that worked. It's a great game.

[12:03] It's the best shooting Jersey Jack game of all time, but it's just the way it goes. I want to see Steve

[12:11] sort of like do something along the lines of AC DC again, or something along the lines.

[12:19] I'm trying to think of the last Ritchie game that I was like, wow, I just think Elwin's so good.

[12:25] I think Danger is just so good. So someone says, J.J.P. actually puts the money in though.

[12:32] I think J.J.P. will surprise us with a killer mech with Harry Potter and Back to the Future. Well,

[12:38] I don't know, man. I don't know. It's yet to be seen. What's the killer mech in Toy Story?

[12:43] What's the killer mech in The Godfather? What's the killer mech in Elton John? What's the killer

[12:49] mech in Avatar? You could even argue what's the killer mech in Guns N' Roses. I don't think Jersey

[12:55] Jack has made a killer mech since Pirates of the Caribbean. That's six years ago, gang. That's five

[13:01] games ago. And so I just don't see it. Like I just don't see Jersey Jack engineering these killer

[13:09] mech games. And I've lost faith that they will do that. I mean, how Fumi ones, Fumi twice, Fumi three,

[13:18] four, five times now. And it is a little confusing to me with the amount of money and the amount of

[13:24] resources they have that Jersey Jack isn't running circles around everybody else when it comes to

[13:31] mechs, when it comes to like exciting things. So, you know, that's where we're at. I'm going to move

[13:38] my, my Facebook camera over here. Let's see. Let's get everything in one shot. How's that? That looks

[13:43] better. Okay. Cause I got the sun coming in. I'm going to go up to the side, just a little bit.

[13:48] There we go. Everything's good. We got Neo Geo. We got Pulsar going on the Neo Geo SC 14. We're

[13:56] going to go like this. So you can see a little bit more Neo. I love my setup. I'm on my living room

[14:02] table and I've got the names people. The names you're like, can you to shut up? Like let's get to

[14:08] this drawing. You're going to get your name put in a hat. We've got my canada hat. And let's read out

[14:18] the names. I got to do I got to cut these suckers up because I didn't do that yet. So I want to do

[14:23] this real quick and wish everybody a sort of good luck on this. Well, let's do this in 10 minutes.

[14:29] I'll do this in 10 minutes because we've got a 40 minutes to go before we do the drawing.

[14:34] Here's my, here's my take on everything happening in Pimbal.

[14:38] Prices are still sky high, right? They're really high. Jersey Jack, Harry Potter is going to,

[14:45] I think, going to be the moment in which they either nail it or I kind of feel like

[14:52] it's a nail in the coffin for these guys because like, and I think the requirements to do Harry

[14:59] Potter right are going to come down to the assets and how they translate Harry Potter into Pimbal.

[15:07] And I think what people are worried about, does it have the movie assets? And if it does, and they

[15:12] don't sync up the clips with the film scenes, I'm done. I said it. I'm not buying another Jersey

[15:19] Jack machine where the voices and the sound effects are not synced up with the clips. I just

[15:28] won't do it. You know, it's like a little bit of Godfather has it, but not a lot. Willy Wonka

[15:32] doesn't have it. Guns N' Roses has it. Guns N' Roses to me will, I think there's, look, there's a

[15:38] reason why Guns N' Roses sold like five, six thousand units. It's kind of perfect. Say what you will

[15:44] about the layout. I get it. It's a little bit more of a stop and go game. It doesn't have the flow of

[15:49] a stern, but when you really understand G&R and you understand like how to set up the game, right,

[15:57] and how to achieve things. So when you start a song, you've got everything ready to go. You

[16:04] collect the band members. You get to band frenzy. You get to encore. You know, there's always a

[16:10] great moment in Guns N' Roses whenever you play it, where you're trying to get to the applause

[16:15] jackpot, right? It's very similar to the Eclipse jackpot in Avatar. You build it all up during the

[16:22] song and then you got to hit that shot as the song is ending and it's awesome. And if you hit it,

[16:27] you go to encore and then you play another song from that album and the crowd's cheering and the

[16:34] lights are going, it's a great moment. I mean, I love, love, love, love playing my Guns N' Roses.

[16:40] I'm never selling it. Yeah, I get it. The market is sort of falling out from underneath it simply

[16:46] because they made too many. I think Jersey Jack overproduced the game for sure. Harry Potter,

[16:53] I know, is a monster theme, but as a holder fantasy nerd, it doesn't hit for me. The thing about

[17:00] Potter is this. Like, let's be honest, people, like how many adults our age? Are we really the

[17:08] Potter demographic? I'm not. I mean, I didn't read the books. I saw all the movies, but like,

[17:14] Potter to me was like movies that I saw. And I didn't need to see them again. Like, I saw everyone.

[17:21] I saw everyone in the theater and they were, they were enjoyable. I was entertained. I thought the

[17:27] actors were great. I thought they brought that world to life in such a good way. But it doesn't

[17:33] stick with me culturally the way Han Solo does or Luke Skywalker or Optimus Prime or Galvatron

[17:43] and Megatron. You know, it just doesn't. I just he man, like I just, I don't know. When I think

[17:50] about things that the moment I see them or hear them, it awakens something in me. And look, I'm

[17:56] not saying that some people, yeah, they're all in on Potter. I just don't know if the 40 to 60

[18:05] year old demographic is as into it as people think. So we shall see, you know, like I'm more into

[18:13] Goonies and Back to the Future. I'm more into a Cobra Kai karate kid. I'm more in the die hard

[18:20] total recall. You know, give me a Vondam game. Give me big trouble in little China. Give me

[18:26] fifth element. Give me matrix. Like, you know, these are the things that like, all right, they have

[18:31] much more just much more connection with me. I mean, from what I can tell Harry Potter, like

[18:37] Voldemort, like it's just this long drawn out narrative or him versus evil, how he got the

[18:45] scar on his head and it's cute. It's campy. It's fun. It's good. But I'm just not sure

[18:54] that people are gonna, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know if

[18:59] it's gonna be based on the movies. It feels like a again, a Herculean task to take all those like

[19:04] eight or nine movies and make it a pinball machine. I mean, Keith already just makes one or two movies

[19:12] into a ginormous Chinese diner menu of how to play a game. I feel like our heads are gonna be spinning

[19:21] with how much Jersey Jack tries to cram into Harry Potter. So, you know, I'm sort of like

[19:30] love where we're all at now in pinball because I think the community, for the most part, is really

[19:38] connected. I think a lot of the newbies who came in during COVID, I think they've all been burned.

[19:44] I think they've all learned a lesson. You know, I see these guys, you know who they are. I don't

[19:48] have the name names, but they came into pinball during COVID. They got bit by the bug. They bought

[19:54] every game as it came out. And then they sold games and made humongous losses on their spreadsheet.

[20:02] And they didn't even play the games that much. They didn't enjoy the games nearly enough to take

[20:07] the losses that they took. And the little dirty secret about the hobby that we're all in right now,

[20:14] gang, is that there's thousands of unsold games. And one of the show topics I'm going to be discussing

[20:22] over the next few weeks, as we think about what do you do with all that unsold inventory?

[20:28] Something's got to give, right? This map pricing model, it's again, it's not working. You got these

[20:35] dealers with VenomLEs in box. I know a dealer that's got 100 GNRLEs in a box. And the thing is,

[20:43] they can't publicly list these games for sale. I think the pinball industry needs to more reflect

[20:50] a car dealership where, you know, a last year's model is discounted, right? And two years ago,

[20:59] even more discounted. Guns N Roses is almost a four-year-old model of a pinball machine. And,

[21:08] you know, if Jersey Jack is telling dealers you can't advertise GNR for less than 10.5,

[21:15] but the market value for one is 7,500, I think it gets a little silly. And then dealers have to

[21:22] have their friends list the games for sale, and it's all disingenuous a little bit. Or dealers

[21:29] have to open up the game and stream it and then sell it used. We see that a lot, like streaming a

[21:35] game and then, you know, because they have to, because they're not allowed to sell it at a discount.

[21:42] You know, the only company I saw put their games on sale was AP. I mean, we know they need to sell

[21:49] their games and they got to clear out that inventory. You know, the hard part is, like,

[21:55] it's because a company that does it, I think what makes them reluctant to do it, it's admitting

[22:02] that you handed people a loss. So, like, let's face it, like, VenomLE was $13,000. It's now,

[22:10] like, a $9,000 LE, like, new in box. You know, and I think Stern, you know, Stern struggles to sort of,

[22:19] because if you communicate to the early adopters that their game is now worth $4,000 less,

[22:28] they're going to have a fear of commitment of buying future titles from you. I think Venom

[22:34] should have only had 350 LEs. I also told this to my friends at Stern and I say my friends at

[22:41] Stern because I do think Stern is listening and I think they need to try different stuff.

[22:45] I don't think every game should have an LE. I mean that, like, why does every game need an LE?

[22:51] I get the margins are good, this and that, but, like, I don't know, like, is there demand? And if

[22:57] you are going to do an LE of a game with low demand like John Wick, like, John Wick, a thousand LEs,

[23:06] well, it's just like a boneheaded move. Like, you didn't do any market research, you just put,

[23:13] you know, the next title into the same playbook and thought that the defense wouldn't intercept. And,

[23:19] man, did the community intercept that move and destroy the value of John Wick LEs.

[23:25] Now, Stern making old titles, Chad just said this on Facebook. I think, you know, what we've seen with

[23:33] Metallica, I think has people super excited, super nervous at the same time. If you own a Tron LE

[23:43] right now, and this is what I'm really imploring that George and Seth really think about, if you

[23:49] own a Tron LE right now, you're part of a special club. I believe they only made 400 Tron LEs. I

[23:59] think Tron was 400, not 500. Correct me if I'm wrong, people. I'm pretty good at my pinball history.

[24:05] You know, I'm pretty good. Sometimes when I talk to people at Stern, I'm like, I'm telling them what

[24:10] they did. They're like, no, I don't even think they were numbered. Yeah, they were numbered. You

[24:13] know, sometimes they say stuff and I'm like, do you not know your own product history? I think

[24:18] Tron was 400 or was it 500? Someone let me know. Someone here must have one. So the special thing

[24:25] about Tron is when they made Tron LE, there was no premium, right? Yeah, you got to remember like,

[24:33] what that means. It's like, this is it. Like, this is it. So there was 400 and there was no premium

[24:41] and it had like the fiber optic ramps and it had it had an exclusive Daft Punk multi ball. Now think

[24:50] about Stern since then. Have they ever given people like a real exclusive gameplay experience

[24:58] in the software for buying an LE? And I think that's one of the reasons why Tron LE is so damn

[25:07] coveted because it's like, you either have that experience, 400 people on the planet have it and

[25:13] nobody else does. And then you go from the LE to the pro and they never screwed over the LE buyers

[25:20] by making premiums. Remember when they did Walking Dead LE and no premium and they said they were

[25:26] never making premiums and then they did. Remember what that did to the Walking Dead collectors

[25:32] at that time? And so if Stern is going to make another run, what I would do if I were them

[25:40] is I would do 400 neutrons. I think you got to keep the numbers consistent. I think you got to give

[25:46] original owners a chance to have matching number of games. That's how I would do it. I wouldn't make

[25:52] a thousand even though the demand is there. Again, just make it special. And what Stern can now do

[25:58] as they see the feeding frenzy for Metallica, I know this is not going to be popular with some

[26:04] people right now, but the truth is this, Metallica LE could have been more than 13 and they still would

[26:11] have sold every one. And in a weird way, they could have priced it even higher because it is

[26:20] more special than a John Wick LE or a Venom LE or a James Bond LE and a Poo Fighters LE. I think what

[26:28] they should have done, I think what they should have done because now that you've got this, you

[26:35] know, a plethora of games at a thousand LE's, doesn't 500 become a super LE? Right? Just think

[26:43] about that for a minute. Like 500 now is super limited in a world where everything else has a

[26:48] thousand. And so I think they could have done something like that. And I also think, you know,

[26:54] make it a real SLE of Metallica. It should have an exclusive topper. It should come with exclusive

[27:01] songs. It should come with stuff that maybe is just not in the premium of the game. And I think

[27:08] if you did that and you really made it awesome like that, and again, like get James or Lars

[27:14] to do a personal call out, like, are you ready to rock, Canada? Like they could have done that.

[27:18] Like they could have done that the way they did it with, you know, Adam West and Batman with unique

[27:24] call outs. So when people say, please don't encourage higher prices. So, Josh, the truth is

[27:30] I'm just looking at the market, my friend. I'm looking at the market and I'm looking at like,

[27:35] who buys these things? And there is an opportunity, you know, and again, look, Stern's got to find

[27:42] that balancing act. You know, they don't want to charge too much and remove all the second hand value.

[27:49] Who's who what's the agenda? Are we buying as an investment or just buying the game we want?

[27:54] Which is it? It can't be both. Why not, Mark? Mark, I don't understand that. That makes, so Mark just

[28:01] said, Are we buying it as an investment or are we buying a game we want? It can't be both. Absolutely,

[28:08] it can be both. Mark, why can't you buy a game you really want, play it for a few years, and move

[28:16] it on for a lot of money because it was a good investment at the same time. You know, I really

[28:22] love my Dodge Demon and it's, you know, it's held value. It's gone up a little bit, but I'm happy

[28:28] that if I ever need the money, right, something could happen in life and I need to free up $100,000,

[28:33] I could go sell it versus my friends who just bought electric porches and they spent $150,000

[28:43] on a Taycan GTS and now it's worth like 90. They lost $60,000. We both love cars. We both love what

[28:51] we're driving, but one was just a better investment. I think those two things don't have to be

[28:59] mutually exclusive of each other. They should have only made Metallica remastered unlimited.

[29:06] No, I don't agree, Louis. I don't agree. I don't know why there's such an anger towards these like

[29:13] collectible versions of things. It's healthy for this hobby. It's been what's pulled Stern

[29:18] through all these years. Stern shouldn't care about the second hand value. That's not their problem.

[29:24] Make a game and sell it. It's not Stern's problem that people want to make money. This isn't the

[29:29] stock market. Well, it's a market though, Pimballer. This is a market. I don't understand why people

[29:36] think this is not an asset. It's an asset. When you spend north of $10,000 on anything,

[29:43] who doesn't want to get some sort of return on that investment? I think some people don't get it.

[29:50] Well, look, Trent, if you ever take a ride in a Dodge Demon, you would understand in a heartbeat

[29:55] why the car is worth $100,000. Go inside a $100,000 BMW, Mercedes, Audi, which you can easily get

[30:04] those cars north of $100K. You won't even have half the thrill of driving a Dodge Demon. Just

[30:11] trust me, man. There's an ignorance in the car world that the Dodge Demon isn't worth the money,

[30:17] and then I take people for rides, and I'm talking about people who have exotics, who have Rolls

[30:22] Royces, Ferraris, Lamborghinis. They get it. They get it. It's a special vehicle. If you're a car

[30:31] enthusiast, you know how to appreciate what each company is putting on the table. If Stern allowed

[30:38] dealers to discount models after years, does that affect the standard production quantities?

[30:45] I don't know. I don't know. I think not. I think there's a tidal wave coming

[30:57] where there's just so many games in boxes sitting in a warehouse in Chicago. Where are those games

[31:04] going to go? I mean, that's the question. I'm just curious. Where are they going to go? Who are they

[31:09] going to go to? When that does happen and we oversaturate the market, I think it's going to be

[31:16] a pretty rough period. I think people are just out of room. I don't know about you guys, but I'm

[31:23] out of room already. I got maybe room for one more pin upstairs. I could probably sneak one into the

[31:28] garage. How many of you, like, raise of hands are just out of room? You need to sell a game to bring

[31:34] a new one in. That's probably more of the issue for people than money. Absolutely. It's harder for

[31:43] operators to make money with games costing so much. It's an interesting time in Pimbal.

[31:48] It's an interesting time in Pimbal. I'll say this. As I get older and hopefully a little bit wiser,

[31:55] and I realize some of the mistakes of a younger version of me, I'm sort of over the whole

[32:03] collecting and having just stuff to flex and thinking that, you know, I don't know, when I see all

[32:11] these guys with less than 200 plays on a game that's been out for like six, seven years,

[32:20] I don't get it. I don't get it. I drive my car. I play all my Neo Geos. Even the Neo Geos, I bought

[32:28] too many of them. I don't need three or four of them. I started to collect all the different

[32:32] cabs and then I didn't care anymore because the community that loves Neo Geo, they're all bitter

[32:40] A-holes anyway. They come at you with jealousy, envy, and hate. Legitimately, I tried to sell

[32:48] my SC-19, which is the bigger version of this, for like $6,500. Everyone on Facebook is telling me

[32:54] I'm an idiot. I'm a moron. That's too much for it. And I've got a guy in Kuwait that wants to

[33:00] wire me $11,000 for it. I just don't want to sell it to someone in Kuwait and DHL, shipping, and

[33:07] customs. I don't want to sell it like that because if anything happens to it and then he does like a

[33:13] charge back through eBay and then the eBay fees and then what? I've got this busted up unit and

[33:21] I'm going to have to deal with... I want someone to pull up here with cash in hand and put it in the

[33:27] back of their truck and take it home and enjoy it. Who keeps saying we love Trump? This is not...

[33:35] This is a weird... Is this like a spam? Let's get Trent Briggs verified. Who? Trent, you're going.

[33:42] We're moderating you. We're going to put you on a timeout for 10 minutes because this isn't like a

[33:49] political page. This is a pinball chat. Vote for who you want people. I think we're kind of in trouble,

[33:57] maybe a little bit either way. It just is what it is. All right, so let's read the names. Let's get

[34:02] them in the hat. Let's read the names. I want to say congratulations to everybody that followed the

[34:07] rules. I told you how to do it. It was very simple. I'm just going to say this. Let's just go down and

[34:17] read all the names and then I'm going to cut them up and we're going to put them in the hat. How's

[34:21] that sound? All right. All right, so here are your contestants for the Metallica Limited Edition.

[34:27] It is... This game is coming from... I will connect you with how to get this game afterwards.

[34:34] I'm waiting for Killian to pull the name out of the hat at 11 o'clock. Tentatively, if he's home by

[34:41] then, I will use Brenda's phone to call the winner. We're going to do it that way. It's going to be

[34:49] fun. I'm not even going to announce the winner. I'm going to call the number first so we can announce

[34:53] the name live as he or she picks up. I don't think there's a single woman on this list. As I always

[35:00] say, women are too smart to drop $13,000 on pinball machines. Did I say anything about back to the

[35:07] future? I already talked about it a little bit. Jersey Jack and Stern obviously would love to

[35:13] make the game. I think Stern would be the smarter move. I think Stern can make thousands of them

[35:21] in a year. Jersey Jack couldn't and I think someone like Elwyn would make it. Can you think

[35:27] about it? Again, would you not want Keith Elwyn to make back to the future? Who at Jersey Jack

[35:33] would make a better game than Keith Elwyn? It's all going to come up to Barry now.

[35:39] I think there's a combination of humbleness versus ego versus reality check for Barry.

[35:47] I don't know if he wants to be the designer and be pinball famous by making back to the future.

[35:54] I don't think he's as good as Keith Elwyn. I do think that if Barry were smart, he'd

[36:00] ink a good deal, make money on every game sold. It's a win-win-win for everybody. Everybody wins

[36:07] that way. I think that would be the way I would do it, but it's in his court. I know that every

[36:15] company would love to have the license. We got Robert. I'm going to read the names. Robert Cuccini,

[36:21] hopefully I'm saying your names right. Joe Fiori. Jim Bond, who's in Tokyo. I got to see like gang,

[36:29] you international guys. I don't know if they can ship internationally. I know Hector is on

[36:34] there internationally. We'll have to figure this out, but I didn't exclude anybody who was not in

[36:41] who was global. There's that. I don't know if there's anyone on here from Australia. We've got

[36:48] Jerry Benney, Richard Harris McLaughlin, Kevin Sminge, Steve Dobbins, Tyson Hoffman, Brian

[36:59] Millard, Chris Greeny, Zach Buchamp, Keith Gallesey. If I butchered your names, people, sorry. It's

[37:09] Glenn Hansen, Ryan Heath, Adam Greer, Hector, Castrae Hone,

[37:17] Castrae Hone, Hector, Patrick Oles, Willie Mitley, Ray Gonbarri, Nick Sagan, Mike Donk,

[37:28] Ryan Dexter, Lawrence Levine, Adam Fresalone, Pete Rosen, Pavel P, Jay McGuire, Dean

[37:39] Heinrichsen, Tom Plecher, Mike, wait, wait, wait, do we have two Heinrichsons?

[37:48] I thought I just said Heinrichsson. Hold on. No, Heinrichsson. Oh, there's two different names.

[37:55] There's a Heinrichsson and then a Heinrichsen. Different area codes. Sound familiar, but they're

[38:00] spelled differently. All right. Dana Martin, Enzo Ventrella, Greg Jones, Pete Meno, Wilwear,

[38:10] Ben DeLong, Kevin Peterson, Troy Swope, Craig Roth, Jeff Eppner, B. Escondari, Nahidi, Anthony

[38:22] Salerno, Ryan Saunders, Rodney Comgees, sorry Rodney, it's not, it doesn't roll off the tongue.

[38:33] Jason Riftah, Chris Chapman, and Marty Robbins. No, Marty Robbins is not on this list. Marty Robbins

[38:43] is watching a movie right now doing A-OK. I can't believe, I mean, it's funny to me. It is funny to

[38:52] me that that whole thing is trying to unfold and it's not fooling anybody. Obviously, he knew what

[39:00] was going on with Hages when he was shilling the centaurs and I just love all the revisionist history,

[39:06] the whitewashing of it. And as I literally, just the reason why I did the show I did about it this

[39:13] week is you don't get to do that. You just don't get to mislead people when you should have known

[39:20] better and you did know better and then just get forgiven and you get to come back and enjoy the

[39:27] hobby and just act like you were just an employee that didn't know what was going on. And I think

[39:33] what Jeff called all of us was really unprofessional, uncalled for, and I think it just shows the true

[39:39] nature of some of these gentlemen. I think they have tremendous egos. I think they're very entitled

[39:46] and I think they're very angry and I think they think they're better than us. I really do. When

[39:51] you call people unintelligent f-heads, if you think Marty had anything to do with like the Hages'

[39:59] like collapse or knowingly mislead people, come on man, you did a show for a year where Marty dodged

[40:05] every single question about Hages and not only that, he laughed in the face of people that were

[40:10] concerned about Hages' pinball and their ability to manufacture games. I think they do live in a bubble

[40:18] and again, just had to call it like I saw it because it's not cool. And it just was a stupid

[40:28] show to do. It's like, if you want Marty to come back, just come back and let him talk for himself,

[40:34] but to insult everybody as a way to sort of pave the way for his return. I don't know Jeff, man,

[40:42] that wasn't smart. Craig Roth, why do you want to join the video right now? You're not joining. I'm

[40:46] not having a guest on right now. It makes those sad though. No one's joining. No one's joining.

[40:51] All right, let me cut these names up as we talk. And everyone's going into the hat. Everyone has

[40:58] equal opportunity to win. I'm excited for each and every one of you. 46 of you are going to

[41:04] lose. So it is what it is. I don't know any other way to do this. I thought this was the most fair

[41:11] thing to do. People gave me slack for even doing this game. Like they're literally like, there's

[41:16] a marketing storm. You're not doing anything. Like come on. Like no good deed goes unpunished in the

[41:21] pinball hobby people. And I really do mean it when I say it. I think there's a lot of really

[41:27] awesome people in pinball. And then I think there's a lot of really, I don't know, like strange people

[41:34] in our hobby that really do hide behind a keyboard and just insult and, you know, we don't know who

[41:42] they are. They're kind of behind their avatar names. And, you know, they don't really stand in front of

[41:49] their vitriol. And, you know, it gets a little tiring dealing with it. And I think, you know,

[41:56] there's no room for that anymore. And I think if you kind of approach your life as like,

[42:03] how many days can I wake up in a good mood? You're not going to wake up and, you know,

[42:14] curse people out on pinball forums and all that stuff. Now that being said, if we're

[42:21] unintelligent Feds, because we think that, you know, one of two employees, the guy I want to talk

[42:27] to is that duck pinball guy. You know, all those employees that quit Haggis, they quit the company,

[42:33] they knew it was going on. You know, then why didn't Marty quit? I mean, that's really the

[42:38] easiest question. If you, if everyone else saw that the house was on fire and exited the house,

[42:47] why didn't you know you stayed, you promoted the company, you convinced people to spend more money

[42:56] when everybody else was quitting? Okay, George Gomez is in the house. I told George to join George.

[43:03] Welcome to the Metallica LE sort of offer to a fan out there to get one at MSRP. George, welcome to

[43:12] the party. And George, you're right. No good deed goes unpunished. I think sometimes too with all of,

[43:19] all of what happens in pinball. And I mean this when I say it, when you, when you take the tour of

[43:24] Stern and Jersey Jack and these, you see what goes into these games and you see the people that make

[43:30] them and the amount of work and the amount of effort and then how easy it is, right? How easy

[43:37] it is to unravel the joy this hobby brings everybody because you're at home and you're

[43:44] unhappy at your probably drinking and you're typing angrily. It's weird, right? It's weird.

[43:51] I think it makes everybody, especially at the pinball companies, sort of, you know, reluctant

[43:57] to engage as much as they want to. I remember walking through Stern and it was the day after,

[44:04] you know, Jack Danger had done the initial stream of X-Men and he was kind of all bummed out

[44:10] and because they had done the stream, they were having fun with it. They dressed up in X-Men costumes

[44:16] and they were having some brutal games and the code was still early and it just like, you know,

[44:22] it wasn't the best showing and then Jack is just like deflated because he realized like, you know,

[44:29] people are not seeing like what the magic is and the magic is there and so, you know, but he just

[44:36] had this look like he was just destroyed and I'm like, man, like what, like what, like this is,

[44:42] this is your moment, like, you know, and I can see how the community at times can weigh people down

[44:51] to the point where the very people that are giving everything they have to making people happy

[44:57] are just exhausted and feeling like they never win. So it's something interesting for all of us to

[45:04] think about and I look, I struggle with this all the time on this show. I think my show's been an

[45:10] ever-evolving journey, you know, to give constructive criticism or feedback and I think when you do

[45:18] give constructive feedback, it's delivered without curses, without personal attacks and I think when

[45:26] you give constructive feedback, it should be clear that you're giving this feedback on the game because

[45:33] you want to see the games get better and you have a thought on how they could possibly improve

[45:39] the games or the marketing around pinball, right? I have a lot of thoughts on that. I have a lot of

[45:44] thoughts on, you know, these LEs and again, but when you approach it where you're trying to help,

[45:52] you know, I want Jersey Jack games to get better by integrating the clips in a better way. We know

[45:57] it can be done, right? Stern did it with Jaws, Wise Avatar all muted, right? And I mean that, like,

[46:03] I'm not, I really like Mark Sidon, I think he's a great guy. I'm just perplexed how nobody gave

[46:10] that feedback internally over there, but I'm not going to blame like or be angry. I just,

[46:16] just not the way I would have done it. All right, so we've got all these names, George, going into a

[46:21] hat. You know, this is this is the hottest game in pinball in a long time. I think Metallica LE,

[46:29] Metallica LE is the hottest launch I've seen since Godzilla. When Godzilla came out, a little history

[46:38] lesson for all of you out there. It was $10,500, right? George, George cover your ears. How was

[46:48] Stern able to make that game with all that stuff for $10,500 and John Wick with half as much in it

[46:57] is $2,500 more? But see, you know, it was like it was kind of like that, that last 10, 5 game.

[47:05] And it was like, awesome. I mean, it's not just me saying this, Godzilla is ranked on the top 100

[47:12] as number one, right? So the number one game of all time ranked by the community

[47:19] came out at a great price. And you know, like we used to complain 10k by Christmas. Remember when

[47:25] that was the joke? Now it's like 18k by Christmas with this Metallica. So it's like, it came out at

[47:32] 10, 5, they made 1000 of them, they sold out. Now it wasn't impossible to get one like you could,

[47:39] when they make 1000, you can call around and get one. But here's what happened to Godzilla.

[47:45] That was right before COVID. Remember when the lockdown happened, right? And the supply shortage

[47:50] happened. Godzilla's instantly like within a few months, a Godzilla LE after we realize, oh my gosh,

[47:58] this game is everything. Like it's got the moments, it's got the assets, it's got the personality,

[48:04] it's got the mechs, it's got the humor, it's got the, you know, the mod community has gone crazy.

[48:09] Like it was amazing to watch how everyone rallied around Godzilla, right? Rallied around the game.

[48:16] I think the only like controversy at launch was does Godzilla look like a watermelon and maybe a

[48:23] little bit, maybe Zombie Eddie, don't kill me, maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit watermelony.

[48:27] But you know, we all got over that because it just looked great. And when you stood over a Godzilla

[48:31] and you played it, I think it reminded everybody what they love so much about pinball. And it had

[48:38] personality, the way you, you could change the audio to be in Japanese, but it just, Godzilla is

[48:45] just perfect. It is a perfect example of translating a theme into a pinball game where there's like,

[48:52] George, you always used to say this, it's got to be like three interesting things to shoot at.

[48:57] It has that. It's got to have like, you know, call outs that get your energy going. It has that when

[49:03] a multi ball starts, it has like this energy, right? And I, you know, like when, when Avatar

[49:09] multi ball starts, gag, it's like, you literally are like, I feel like I'm in church. I feel like

[49:15] when they're like, hallelujah mountain multi ball, it's like, there's no energy. There is no energy.

[49:20] Everyone should go study how Adam's family and Metallica sort of get you going. Kill

[49:29] I do need help killing. All right, here we go killing. We've got five minutes though. Give me

[49:33] five minutes and then you're going to pick the winning name out of this Canada hat. And I'm going

[49:40] to call the number and here's how it's going to work. You need to pick up the phone to win the spot.

[49:48] Right. Not the game. I'm not buying you a game for $13,000. You will win this spot. I know there

[49:53] was some confusion there. Not going to give you a free game, but this is going to be super fun.

[50:00] And Killian is going to be the decider of somebody's fate and getting look, I hope whoever wins this,

[50:06] I just want to say this. I hope you don't sell it. I hope you really entered this because you are a

[50:12] Metallica fan. And I want to say thank you to everyone that reached out and shared your personal

[50:17] stories about Metallica. Some of you had babies wearing Metallica clothing. You had game rooms

[50:24] filled with Metallica artwork. And you know, you really are in love with the band. And I think that

[50:31] to me is how every music pin should be. Right. It's like, I always say this, like out of all the

[50:37] pinball machines that have been made over the last like 10 years, music fans have really had it the

[50:42] best. I mean, if you love ACDC, Guns N' Roses, Metallica, if you love Foo Fighters, if you love

[50:51] Elton John, if you love Iron Maiden, you know, if you love, what am I missing? I said ACDC,

[50:58] like if you love, I mean, heck, Kiss, I even think Aerosmith, like talk about an awesome toy in a

[51:05] game. Like if you love those acts, you love the pinball machines. And the thing about music pins

[51:13] that I think make it easier to get, you know, to get it right is because the one thing you just

[51:18] have to do is play the damn music. Right. It's not like stuff physically is missing that you want it

[51:24] in the game where a movie and TV show is different. Because when you make them like a pinball machine

[51:30] based on a movie, there's like physical things you want to see in there. So if you make back to

[51:35] the future, you got to have a DeLorean where the doors go up, right, or the clock tower. You got

[51:42] to have a hoverboard. You got to have maybe a Pepsi Perfect coming up from underneath the play field.

[51:48] You know, you get there's certain things we're like, Oh, if it doesn't have this,

[51:51] it's not connecting to the theme the right way. But music, just hit him with it and then do fun

[51:56] stuff killing you getting ready, buddy. Hold on, we got we got three minutes to go. Mama, I need your

[52:03] phone. And then we're going to do this. I'm cutting up all the names. And we're almost got everybody

[52:10] in the hat. You know, I think one of the coolest, you know, when I look at guns and roses, and

[52:19] slash his involvement with that game, it's absolutely like, it's a rare thing. And I tell this to

[52:26] people, you know, slash made this game. Hold on, don't touch any of the names, buddy. I don't want

[52:30] killing you. Why do you have middens on? Here, come on, buddy, I'm going to get you up here.

[52:36] We're going to we're going to interview for you for a little bit. Okay, are you ready to talk?

[52:41] You want to tell Mr. Gomez what you think about his le? His le? Hold on.

[52:49] Gang, we got four more to cut up, and we're going to get killing it on the lap. Brenna,

[52:53] can I have the phone, please? Don't don't touch, don't touch. Killing, I like your gloves, your

[52:59] mittens. Okay, is this everybody? Okay. Okay, so I want you guys to see this, all the names are going

[53:06] in. Oh, I just knocked that over. All right, here we go. We're back. Okay, the names, buddy, are

[53:15] going to go into the hat. And we're going to pick Brenna's handing me her phone. All the names are

[53:21] going in. Okay, so we're going to drop them all in. I'm going to move it around. And we're going to

[53:29] let Kili and pick one out. I wish I could give 47 people metallic le. I, you know, George, we'll

[53:39] talk. I think Stern doing a lottery like this would be a lot of fun. And I think it would be a

[53:44] moment. I think you make the Stern lottery. You get you get set there and Gary and George with the

[53:49] big everyone gets a you know, their name on a ball. And we pulled out like 10 names like make it like

[53:55] an you know, like an NBA draft lottery where you're in the draft and we can figure out different

[54:00] ways where you can increase the amount of odds of winning. I think it'd be a lot of fun. All right,

[54:04] killing here we go. You ready? I don't know why my boy has it is 11 o'clock. We're not missing any

[54:12] names. Come here. Come on. Sit up here. Okay. Yeah. All right. Killian. How much how much

[54:22] do you think a pinball machine should cost one dollar? Okay, so okay, so we've just put

[54:29] Stern pinball and everybody else out of business. Killian, do you like Metallica?

[54:34] Okay, that's good. That's good. All right, Killian, you're going to pick out of your hat

[54:42] this canada hat, you're going to pick a name. All right. Now I want you to we're going to move

[54:47] the names around. I'm not looking. I'm not looking. All right. All right. I want you to pick. I want

[54:55] one fell out. Good job, Brandon. Put it back in one fell out. All right. Okay, you ready? All right.

[55:01] Okay. All right, here we go. Just pick one. Just one. Okay, don't don't don't don't don't

[55:09] don't show me who it is. All right, we have we have one in hand. All right, now we are going to call

[55:15] killing. I want you when I call this number to say you won. Okay. Can you do that? All right,

[55:22] we're going to call right now. Taking mommy's phone. This is fun, right? It's fun. But this this,

[55:29] you know, Killian doesn't come cheap. His hourly rate is about 10 times mine.

[55:33] He brings a level of adorableness to this.

[55:40] And we're going to see if we have a winner.

[55:48] All right.

[55:49] All right. Okay, here we go. Okay. Say you won.

[55:57] You won. Oh, thank you very much. I'm so stoked. All right. All right. So our winner,

[56:04] I know 46 people right now are like staring at their cell phones.

[56:08] Pablo P. Pablo P. Congratulations. Now, Pablo, where are you from? I want to pop.

[56:17] Pablo, where are you? Where are you from? Well, wait, 10. Okay, where are you from, Pablo?

[56:25] I am from Delaware. Okay. Are you a big Metallica fan? Huge, absolutely huge.

[56:33] I am from Delaware. Killian, Killian, Killian, Killian, Killian. Okay, so tell us,

[56:38] like, have you been a Metallica fan since the 80s, 90s? What's your what's your how much do you love

[56:42] them? I love Metallica as much as the next guy. I saw Metallica back in the late 80s.

[56:52] I didn't even really know who they were. All right. What's your favorite album?

[56:58] Because I was nothing but a pop guy at the time. It wasn't until they came out.

[57:08] Yeah. Yeah.

[57:12] I feel like the black album, right with Enter Sam and was like what 91. And that was really when

[57:19] like the old fan base was sort of like they're selling out with more, you know, mainstream hits.

[57:25] But that's I think when a lot of people like just fell in love with the band. Well, Pablo, here's

[57:29] the deal. Congrats. You're going to keep this game, right? You're not going to flip it. You're not

[57:33] going to scalp it, right? Nope. Okay, so we're going to check in, Pablo, we're going to check in every

[57:39] like six months and just want to see a photo of it in that game room. How does that sound?

[57:46] All right. All right. And I will, Pablo, I will connect with you after this and I'll get you all

[57:52] the details on how to, you know, get the game paid for and sent to you. But congratulations.

[57:58] And thank you for everyone who participated in this drawing. Again, I wish I had more games to

[58:04] give away to all of you, but we'll keep doing this. This is a lot of fun. And then you're not going

[58:08] to back out because the last time we did this was James Bond, Ellie and everybody backed out. But

[58:12] this is, this is good. This is good. Pablo, Pablo, I'm happy we can make your Saturday morning a

[58:18] special one. I skipped the gym for this. Oh, all right. Well, go, go hit the gym now and

[58:24] play some Metallica and hit it hard. It goes against everything you ever said. No pimple,

[58:29] go to the gym. Yeah. I always say like if people did as many push-ups as words they posted on pin

[58:35] side, this whole hobby would be ripped. Like it's just, it's amazing to me. All right, Pablo,

[58:41] well, thank you very much. I'm super excited for you and I can't wait for you to get the game.

[58:45] Thank you. Thank you, Killian. Killian, say thank you.

[58:50] Say you're welcome. Okay. See you, Pablo. All right. Well, that was great. You know, look, I'm,

[58:58] I feel like I want to like, should I give one other number and give a t-shirt? I don't even have

[59:02] t-shirts to give. I don't know more merchandise. They took all my merchandise down. Look, Pablo,

[59:07] I'm super happy for you. For all of you who are in the running, thank you for sharing your stories

[59:14] of Metallica. I know everybody, give me this baby. Hold on a second. There's one more.

[59:20] Here we go. Okay. Okay. See, this sweet child of mine is the future. You know, I keep telling this

[59:28] to everybody. This is the future of pinball. Are the people with children who are going to get bit

[59:34] by the pinball bug, right? I mean, you're going to play pinball, right? Yeah, of course you're going

[59:38] to play pinball. His head looks like a pinball. It is completely round and it's absolutely adorable.

[59:45] Are you doing all right? He's so chill. Like, he's the easy one. You know, it's Killian that's like

[59:52] all the energy and making everything go nuts in our house every day. All right, all right, sweet

[59:56] child of the mind. See, he's got his guns and roses t-shirt on. All right, get him out of here. Get him

[01:00:01] out of here. There we go. There is the future of pinball podcasting right there. Right there.

[01:00:08] Everybody look, I'm super happy that we did this. I'm thankful too that a lot of you sort of helped

[01:00:15] me see clearly why flipping the game was not the right thing to do. And you know, look, it's going

[01:00:22] to happen. Look, if there weren't scalpers gang, there'd be no chance for some of you to get the

[01:00:27] game once it does sell out. So, you know, when you look at the price of a Taylor Swift concert

[01:00:34] ticket, you know, you know, paying a few thousand over for this masterpiece of a game isn't so bad.

[01:00:42] I think there's a lot of, a lot of good momentum coming out of this game. And I think, you know,

[01:00:49] the whole hobby has gone like, you know, and it's gone in different directions over COVID. I think

[01:00:55] we're all back now. We're all kind of, I think appreciating life on a new level now that we've

[01:01:01] been through the pandemic. If you've been to shows, I highly recommend going to a show. It's a lot

[01:01:06] different. For those of you who went to expo toward the different manufacturers met the community,

[01:01:12] the amount of good energy and good vibes that were coming out of that show, I don't know, it made me

[01:01:19] feel re-energized about pinball. And I know it made a lot of you feel that same way. And I do encourage

[01:01:25] everybody, you know, just tune down the forums, you know, a lot of noise and echo chamber happening

[01:01:31] on pin side that I don't think is really reflective of the positivity that's in this hobby. Now,

[01:01:38] don't get me wrong. This isn't some like spreading pinball positivity show. It never will, like,

[01:01:44] I am going to call it as I see it, like there are good games and there are bad games and there's

[01:01:49] good quality and there's bad quality and there's real talent in pinball. And then there's, I think,

[01:01:55] just some people figuring it out as they go. Everybody look, we've had a really fun show.

[01:02:02] I kind of want to end it on a high note. Thank you, Mr. Gomez for hanging out. Thank you for all

[01:02:06] the work you do over at Stern Pinball. And thank you to all the manufacturers that actually give us

[01:02:11] enough to discuss, right? Without games coming out, what would we talk about, right? We'd still be

[01:02:17] like, if it wasn't for these guys, we'd be talking about Hepree Stored Theater of Magics and how much

[01:02:24] is it going to go up? Like, you know, I know, like, there's there's a lot of new stuff happening in

[01:02:28] pinball that is so exciting. We've got Spike three around the corner, got Harry Potter coming, we've

[01:02:34] got Back to the Future coming, we've got maybe King Kong, maybe fallout, right? I love speculating

[01:02:41] what's around the corner. Because even when you know, like what some of these themes are, you,

[01:02:46] you still, it gets your imagination going. And I mean this when I say it, you know, in a world of

[01:02:51] Gen Z kids that are all lonely and miserable and not happy, it's because they're not imagining

[01:02:56] stuff. They're not dreaming of things. They're not in hobbies. They're just looking at

[01:03:00] vapid content all day long that does nothing to make them feel a part of something. And I always

[01:03:06] say this, like, this community is the elixir to the number one problem in the world, which is

[01:03:13] loneliness. Like that is the pandemic that a generation is struggling with. And as long as we

[01:03:17] have these products and each other, I never feel alone in pinball. In fact, like at any hour,

[01:03:23] I can hang out with people from all over the world, whether we Skype or we do this,

[01:03:28] you put up a message on a Patreon chat and people are in it. Yeah, buddy.

[01:03:33] Okay, he put some more stuff in a hat. These are just blank pieces of paper. Thank you, buddy.

[01:03:41] Okay, thank you for the more letters. I appreciate that. So everybody have a great day.

[01:03:47] I love doing this. Thank you for all the support all you club members, you know who you are. And

[01:03:52] if you're not a member of the Canadian club, you know, we would love to have you. It's $5 a month.

[01:03:57] I just went and got two bags of Dunkin Donuts ground coffee beans for $20.

[01:04:03] That's a third of the year of Canadian spin ball podcast. Everybody be good. We'll talk to you

[01:04:07] soon. And again, congrats the Pavel. I will have a great Saturday and go Yankees. What a devastating

[01:04:16] loss last night. I'm up all night watching it great game. We just had to close out the bottom

[01:04:22] of the 10th and that grand slam. All right, everything's in there. Good. Good job, everybody.

[01:04:27] Canada out. See you guys. Be good. Happy Saturday. Enjoy this fall day. Bye.

[01:04:57] USA.
