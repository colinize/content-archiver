[00:00] What becomes of the broken hearted, who had love that's now departed?

[00:09] I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

[00:13] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up!

[00:30] I've noticed more than ever before in this beautiful hobby of ours.

[00:46] The level of overwhelming divide and unhappiness with any new thing that happens in pinball.

[00:54] The prices really have beaten everybody down and everyone's looking at everything a little

[00:59] bit more cynically and with a lot more hesitation.

[01:04] Something gets dropped into the pinball world whether it's a new topper from Spooky Pinball

[01:09] for $969 or a Jaws pinball machine that people have waited a decade for for $13,000.

[01:17] It doesn't matter what it is.

[01:19] Every time something drops now, there is a divided camp in pinball.

[01:24] I think there are just a group of people out there who just don't want anything at these

[01:28] prices and we're going to hear from them and they're going to be very loud and very vocal.

[01:33] Then there are people that just love pinball, love playing pinball and they don't really

[01:36] even think about the prices.

[01:38] I think what happens to is sometimes those people really ignite the first camp of people

[01:42] because they're like, wait a minute, are you telling me that we're just supposed to look

[01:46] at the shots in a game and we're not supposed to ask if the money and the value is actually

[01:51] in the machine itself.

[01:53] We're supposed to just accept if companies are cutting corners when it comes to mechanical

[01:57] magic and getting all the assets into the game.

[02:01] That divide is always going to happen.

[02:03] There's always going to be this civil war in pinball.

[02:05] I've also noticed looking at Jaws and looking at people's reactions to it, you now have

[02:11] a new camp of people.

[02:13] These are people that just think if a game shoots well, it's worth the money.

[02:18] This has been a narrative that has been building in pinball over the last few years that shots

[02:23] are the new toys in pinball.

[02:25] Look at a game like Elton John.

[02:27] It is empty of toys, absolutely empty.

[02:30] Jersey Jack was a company that loaded games with toys and the only praise the game has

[02:36] is it shoots well.

[02:38] Then you think about it for a minute though.

[02:40] Doesn't a Stern Pro shoot the best?

[02:43] When Steve Ritchie's Stern Pro Machines the best shooting games he's ever made?

[02:48] No upper play field to slow down the ball?

[02:50] No lower play field to slow down the gameplay?

[02:54] Now if you just put a lot of lights and a lot of artwork on ostensibly a Stern Pro machine

[03:00] and you light the damn thing up like it's Christmas morning with 2500 RGB LEDs, now it's

[03:07] worth $12,000?

[03:09] When you lift the play field on an Elton John, it looks a lot like a Stern Pro from

[03:13] six years ago that used to cost $5000.

[03:17] And that's where a lot of the divide is coming.

[03:19] So I think we all have to accept that this is the new state of pinball.

[03:23] We're going to have these divided camps constantly.

[03:27] Now let's look at Jaws Pinball for example.

[03:29] How do we feel now?

[03:30] The game leaked on a Tuesday.

[03:32] It is Thursday.

[03:33] I don't know really what we're going to get today.

[03:35] It's supposed to be the feature videos of what's in the game.

[03:38] But here's the problem.

[03:39] We already know it's in the game.

[03:41] So I'm not sure if we're really going to see more meat today on this title.

[03:46] The things people really want to see now, what's going to be in the code and the software

[03:50] of the game.

[03:52] What I'm noticing is that people are really going to have to come to terms with the fact

[03:56] that Brody is not in this game, much like Ripley was not in Alien when it first came

[04:02] out.

[04:03] Remember what Andrew Highway said?

[04:05] You play as Ripley as if that's some sort of consolation prize for people who love the

[04:10] theme.

[04:11] And I'm hearing now that that's what they're going to do on this game is you play as Brody.

[04:16] People will never accept that.

[04:17] A fan of a franchise will never accept the fact that the main character from the movie

[04:22] or the TV show or the rock and roll band, you're playing as them, they don't appear

[04:28] in the game.

[04:29] And from the footage we've seen so far on Jaws, it looks like Brody is in there but

[04:34] just the back of his head.

[04:37] So they're going to use clips from the movie in which you don't see his face apparently.

[04:41] Now look, we don't know this for sure, but that's what it seemingly looks like.

[04:46] There's also some new audio in the Ellie trailer that leaked.

[04:51] And I'm also curious because some of the sound clips sound like they're overdubbed.

[04:56] So are they going to Paul Richard Dreyfus' sound clips from the movie or is someone going

[05:01] to overdub Dreyfus?

[05:03] Now look, everybody wants the original call-outs from the film.

[05:08] We got the original call-outs from the film in a movie called Lord of the Rings in 2004.

[05:15] So here we are 20 years later and Stern can't get the actors from the movies to do the call-outs

[05:23] and grab stuff right from the direct audio.

[05:26] And no, ladies and gentlemen, I heard this excuse.

[05:29] Well the audio doesn't sound good from the original film so it's probably better that

[05:33] they overdub the actors.

[05:34] Get out of here people.

[05:36] You could easily grab great audio call-outs from the film from the 1970s.

[05:42] Come on, that is such an excuse.

[05:45] Batman 66 sounds perfect and guess what year Batman 66 clips are from?

[05:51] 1966, so it's not an excuse.

[05:54] So I'm reading this Jaws commentary and the feedback and a lot of the discussion is around

[05:59] like whether or not this game is checking all of the boxes, whether or not this game

[06:05] is going to sell out in LE format and I just wanted to think about this for a day and now

[06:10] I'm kind of at a place where I think I'm at a level grounded, a fair point of view on

[06:16] this game and I want to share it with you right now.

[06:19] Obviously my opinions might alter as I see more of this game but I want to say this.

[06:25] I think people are somewhat overreacting to Jaws pinball right now.

[06:30] I think everybody needs to take a deep breath and realize a few things are happening in

[06:34] pinball right now.

[06:35] First and foremost, you don't have to buy this game.

[06:39] Nobody is making you buy this game.

[06:41] There is a level of anger around new pinball launches as if this is a medical treatment

[06:48] you need to survive to spend more time with your family to make it another year.

[06:55] It's a pinball machine people.

[06:57] Chances are you own many of them.

[07:01] Chances are you own games that you love.

[07:03] You don't need another machine.

[07:07] And if you walk into every new release with that attitude that I don't really need this

[07:13] unless I see something absolutely amazing that I have to own, it should be easy to say hey

[07:20] I'm good with what I got.

[07:22] I'm glad Stern made this machine.

[07:25] I'm glad Keith Elwin is making pinball machines in 2024 but it's just not the machine for

[07:31] me and you can sort of dismiss it without any anger.

[07:35] The angry people to me I'm a little bit confused as to why people get so angry.

[07:41] None of us are investors in Stern Pinball.

[07:44] None of us have any financial interest in this game being a success other than distributors

[07:49] and the manufacturers.

[07:51] So I do encourage everybody why be so upset that Stern Pinball is fleecing everybody.

[07:57] They will get what they deserve in the end if they overcharge for a product in which

[08:03] the value is not perceived to be there.

[08:06] And I do think they might be going down that road but it's no skin off my back.

[08:10] They're not my employer.

[08:12] I don't have money in them.

[08:13] There's absolutely no reason why I care either way whether Stern makes it or not.

[08:18] Now I do hope they do make it because without Stern Pinball this hobby would be really boring.

[08:24] Everyone else moves so slowly when it comes to manufacturing machines.

[08:28] Okay so you don't need another pinball machine and Jaws comes out and it enrages you.

[08:33] I just encourage you to take a breath and chill out.

[08:36] Now look there's a lot of expectations around Jaws.

[08:39] If you just love pinball Keith Elwin is the new pinball king and so when this game came

[08:44] out I think there's a lot of expectations that Keith Elwin has been working on this

[08:49] game for a few years, that he made great games and he made maybe the greatest game of all

[08:54] time in Godzilla and he's like the new king of pinball.

[08:58] And so when he has a new pinball machine you look at it with greater expectations and you

[09:03] want to see stuff that elevates.

[09:06] Elevates where he's been before, puts even more magic into the game, creates new designs

[09:11] you could not have imagined.

[09:13] The new Elwin machine is going to stand on top of the previous efforts and we know that's

[09:17] not always the case right?

[09:19] Avengers was not better than Iron Maiden, Avengers was not better than Jurassic Park

[09:24] and I'm here to tell you right now as I look at Jaws pinball and I've heard people's complaints.

[09:29] I mean some people are saying this thing looks like a multi-morphic game, how all of the

[09:33] action is on the top one third of the play field and you could cut off the bottom two

[09:38] thirds and there's nothing there and those people aren't exactly wrong but here's what

[09:44] I think people are missing with this game and I'm going to be fair.

[09:47] I think this is going to be Keith Elwin's best shooting game to date.

[09:51] Let me repeat that, I do, I think this is going to be his best, most satisfying game

[09:56] to shoot to date because looking at this game, yes there's not a lot of shots in the lower

[10:01] half of the play field and guess what?

[10:05] Shots in the lower half of the play field are not that fun to hit.

[10:09] Shots in the lower half of the play field often lead to brutal gameplay, they often lead

[10:15] to drains you don't want and it's much more satisfying to see the ball whip all the way

[10:20] up the play field, whip around orbits at the top of the play field, whip towards targets

[10:26] at the top of the play field, whip towards toys and upper play fields at the top of the

[10:30] play field and as I'm looking at this game it looks like it's going to have a lot more

[10:34] speed and a lot more combo opportunities because of the wide open nature of the game.

[10:40] And so I wouldn't write it off right now and say hey this thing is empty compared to Godzilla,

[10:45] this thing is empty compared to Avengers, this thing is empty, I don't think it's going

[10:49] to feel that way when you play it.

[10:51] So I do think it's going to be his most satisfying game to shoot to date.

[10:55] So that's a very good plus for this game.

[10:58] Now when it comes to the mechanical stuff in this game, do I think this is the most impressive

[11:03] mechanical stuff that's been in a Keith Elwyn game and do I think this is the best world

[11:08] under glass of a Keith Elwyn machine?

[11:11] And the answer is no, like these toys, there's just something about them, they all feel kind

[11:15] of cheap, they all feel kind of uninspired, the sculpts are not there.

[11:21] For this much money, this is the real issue with Stern and it's not just this Elwyn machine.

[11:27] When you look down at this game, do you feel like you're looking down at that Jaws world?

[11:33] Like watch the movie, see the world of Jaws and are you seeing it in this game?

[11:39] It's a movie about a seaport town where a great white shark is killing people.

[11:46] Where's the beach?

[11:48] Where's the ocean front?

[11:49] Where's the shark fin that looks like a shark fin?

[11:52] Where's the boat?

[11:53] The orca doesn't even look like the orca.

[11:55] It's just a bunch of plastics people.

[11:58] This looks like Jersey Jack Pinball's Pirates of the Caribbean ship when you take all of

[12:03] the sculpts off to work on the pirate ship.

[12:06] And that's the other thing too, are we supposed to forget that Jersey Jack Pinball gave us

[12:11] a boat like six years ago in a machine that was $9,000 and look how amazing it was.

[12:19] Look at all the stuff it did, it rocked back and forth, it had multiple targets, multiple

[12:24] pathways, it had a cannon that fired the ball and then you look at this orca in 2024 and

[12:31] it's $13,000 and how do you justify that this is as good as it can get in 2024?

[12:39] Pinball and that's the thing, it's like every time a new stern comes out, the stern army

[12:44] wants you to look at this thing in like this myopic view.

[12:48] They want you to have this tunnel vision that you're not allowed to ask questions like how

[12:54] could Jersey Jack put all of that into a game that's much cheaper than this game six years

[13:01] ago?

[13:02] And so you look at the orca, you look at the other ship that's in this game where the

[13:05] shark pops out of and the shark bash toy and you look at the chum bucket and that's kind

[13:10] of it, right?

[13:11] What else is there in this game from a mechanical toy standpoint that is really interesting?

[13:18] I really feel like that's the issue that people are having is, alright, this is the

[13:23] jaws we have to accept but is this the best they could have done when it comes to translating

[13:29] this theme into a world underclass?

[13:32] And I would argue that it doesn't feel that great, it doesn't feel like they nailed the

[13:36] details of jaws.

[13:39] And you know when you walk up to jaws pinball, I'm sorry, I'm sorry but the big miss in

[13:43] this game from a mechanical standpoint is the shark itself.

[13:48] I mean the moment jaws reveals itself in this game is so underwhelming and I think that's

[13:55] sad.

[13:56] This entire game needed to revolve around that moment and I get it's a bash toy but

[14:00] think about this, think about the way Balrog, right, one of the best bash toys in Stern

[14:05] history, think about the way Balrog is incorporated into the game, right?

[14:10] He swings out, he's blocking the bridge to the ring and all of that is like the perfect

[14:16] translation of what's happening in the movie and you're bashing him and he lights up and

[14:21] the shaker motor is going and everything about him, the sculpt looks great, everything about

[14:26] the Balrog bash toy is amazing.

[14:29] And then you look at this jaws, you don't even see his fin, it's just his face, he

[14:34] doesn't eat the ball, there's nothing interesting, he's not even moving, he's not even moving

[14:40] and it just feels like laziness, it feels like they are cutting corners and it's not

[14:46] that interesting and again, this is my issue with modern pinball.

[14:50] They're going to hide behind the fact that this game shoots amazingly well, the toys

[14:55] are not that great, the artwork is uninspired, they don't have the main character from the

[15:01] movie and here's the thing people, it's not that Stern cut corners, they were not allowed

[15:07] to use him, his family, the Roy Scheider estate would not allow anybody to use his likeness

[15:13] so it's not Stern, no money in the world is going to change the family's mind and so

[15:19] don't blame Stern pinball for him not being in the game but it does beg the question,

[15:24] if you can't get him, should you make Jaws Pinball?

[15:28] And look, would you rather have Jaws Pinball or no Jaws Pinball at all?

[15:32] That's the question you need to ask yourself.

[15:34] I know Jack Guinari was looking into this theme and when he realized he couldn't get Roy,

[15:40] he didn't want to make the game.

[15:41] It's kind of funny Jack would say that because then he went on to make like four games in

[15:45] which he has like no assets from the actors in the movies he made.

[15:49] It's funny to me that Pinball has become this constant ongoing series of compromises but

[15:55] at these prices and this is where I think all the anger is coming from, at these prices

[16:01] there shouldn't be any compromises.

[16:03] At these prices these themes should be fully integrated with all the assets.

[16:08] Spooky Pinball is doing it, why can't Stern Pinball do it?

[16:12] Spooky Pinball just did it, why isn't Jersey Jack doing it?

[16:16] And we don't want to compromise anymore and we shouldn't accept compromises anymore because

[16:20] you could go back and buy older games that have all the assets you want.

[16:24] And the thing about Pinball in modern times is this and we all know this, the moment that

[16:29] LCD screen got introduced to Pinball, the moment they could actually put up clips from

[16:34] the movies, the moment they could do more with animations, they took all the mechanical

[16:39] magic out of the games.

[16:41] It's been a problem with Pinball for a long time.

[16:44] When you didn't have an LCD screen and you only had a DMD screen and you wanted to bring

[16:50] that theme to life in a Pinball experience, you mechanically had to do it.

[16:55] Now they're relying so much more on a screen.

[16:58] And so then the question is, will Jaws LE sell out?

[17:02] Well look, everybody knows it's going to sell through to every distributor.

[17:06] Some are going to have their allotments sold out.

[17:08] I was talking to Mike at Automated, he sold out of a lot and he gets a lot of machines.

[17:14] I'm sure a lot of distributors, their games are spoken for.

[17:17] They've been building their Jaws LE list for a while.

[17:20] Remember distributors have been hosed over the last two years.

[17:24] There's sitting on a ton of unsold inventory and so this is like a windfall game they've

[17:29] needed.

[17:30] Now is this the magical windfall game we all thought it would be?

[17:35] Is this the game that's going to sell as well as Godzilla?

[17:38] Is this going to sell 6,000 units?

[17:41] Is this going to be the hero and the white knight of the Pinball industry of 2024?

[17:46] I don't think it's going to be.

[17:47] I think it's going to do just fine.

[17:49] I really do.

[17:50] I think it's going to end up kind of like Jurassic Park did.

[17:52] I mean think about it.

[17:54] Jurassic Park is arguably a more popular theme than Jaws.

[17:59] Jurassic Park has a lot of great mechs in it.

[18:01] It has a much better mech in it with the T-Rex than the Shark and Jurassic Park's artwork

[18:06] is kind of mediocre just like Jaws.

[18:08] So if I were to predict how is Jaws Pinball going to do, I think it's going to do what

[18:13] Jurassic Park did.

[18:15] It's a game that's going to come out.

[18:16] People are going to buy it.

[18:17] It's going to shoot well.

[18:18] It's going to be fun but it's not going to change anything.

[18:22] It didn't bring anything innovative to the table.

[18:25] And after a couple months from now, nobody will really be talking much about it and that's

[18:30] what will happen.

[18:31] And the other conversation I'm noticing which is a very fair conversation to have.

[18:36] It's like why buy an LE when Stern has put the fear in everybody that they're going

[18:41] to make a 50th anniversary of Jaws next year?

[18:45] And the loss of specialty around the LE and the loss of loyalty between customer and manufacturer

[18:51] is really hurting this hobby and here's what I mean by that.

[18:55] When you bought an LE, you used to feel like this is the best version of this machine they're

[19:00] ever going to make.

[19:01] So you bought with confidence.

[19:03] You don't feel that anymore.

[19:05] And you shouldn't feel that anymore because they've broken the trust between customer

[19:09] and manufacturer.

[19:11] There is a real and present fear that if you spend this much money, they're going to one

[19:16] up your game in a year.

[19:18] They did it to everyone who bought Elvira.

[19:20] They've done it to people who bought Jurassic Park.

[19:23] They might do it to people who own Godzilla.

[19:25] Stern Pinball now needs to make that factory move every single week and the moment they

[19:30] have a little bit of a weakness or another game that's a dud like Venom, they're going

[19:35] to go back to the well and screw over the old people who invested in their collectible

[19:40] versions of games.

[19:41] We're probably going to see it with Metallica this year.

[19:44] And the destruction of the LE buyer base and the destruction of that loyalty is really

[19:50] the biggest issue I see in Pinball because that's where all the FOMO is.

[19:55] And you need FOMO to convince these wealthy men to part with their money on an unnecessary

[20:01] toy that they already have so many of.

[20:04] You know, if I don't go in now, I'm going to miss out forever because think about it.

[20:08] If you remove the need to get an LE, you are then liberated.

[20:13] Think about it because if you want a premium, right, that's got everything the designer

[20:17] ever wanted in that game.

[20:19] You can get that premium forever.

[20:21] They're going to make that game for five years.

[20:24] And by the time you want your premium, you're going to be able to get it for much less money

[20:28] if you just wait a little bit longer.

[20:30] And of course that's the reason why Stern waits to make the premiums because they know

[20:34] they need to get that FOMO LE money through the door in the first couple of months.

[20:39] If you remove yourself from even caring about that stuff like the plaque and the signature

[20:45] and the artwork with the foil, all the stuff in the game that doesn't change the gameplay,

[20:50] like nobody who's playing in LE is having any more fun than someone that's playing a

[20:55] premium.

[20:56] And the little dirty secret in all of Pimball is the people who always have the most fun

[21:01] in all of this Pimball industry are the people who buy the Pro Machines.

[21:06] And the people who have the most fun are the people that play the Pro Machines at their

[21:11] locations with $20 in their pocket, they get their fill of Pimball and they go home.

[21:17] They don't have to drop $13,000 or $10,000 every few months on a machine.

[21:23] I mean, that's ludicrous to most Americans.

[21:26] I saw a story yesterday that half of America can't afford to pay for its credit card bill

[21:31] after the holidays.

[21:34] And here we are even debating whether or not to go in on a Jaws LE for $13,000 with the

[21:41] foil artwork and the white armor.

[21:45] Half of this country thinks we're idiots.

[21:47] The other half thinks we're idiots too.

[21:49] We're this little subculture of people that have placed so much value and so much emphasis

[21:55] on something in which you already have so much of.

[22:01] And I think that's where I'm sort of getting to is this sort of philosophical space in

[22:05] this hobby where I'm not going to go in on these things unless it checks all the boxes,

[22:11] unless I absolutely need it.

[22:13] Life is really short.

[22:15] Everything is getting so expensive.

[22:17] I'm not seeing the effort in these games for this much money.

[22:21] I mean, that's just it.

[22:22] We all know it.

[22:23] For this much money, this is not working for me.

[22:26] It's not working for a lot of you.

[22:28] Now speaking of this much money, we're also getting to the point when you buy a game and

[22:33] you load it up with every option, you don't want to have to go back and buy more stuff

[22:38] to unlock more modes, downloadable content disguised as pinball toppers.

[22:44] And I saw yesterday's spooky pinball came out with a new topper for Scooby Doo.

[22:48] My first question was, well doesn't Scooby Doo already come with a topper?

[22:51] Yep, but they made another one.

[22:53] And this one is interactive and it's really cool.

[22:55] It's got a bookcase that opens up.

[22:57] I guess that was the bookcase they sent me that time when they were teasing something

[23:01] and it has like video modes that are up on that topper and it's got shaggy and it's got

[23:05] nice scopes and plastics and it looks really cool.

[23:09] It's $969 and it is billed as the most affordable interactive video mode topper in the history

[23:15] of pinball or something like that.

[23:18] And here's the thing, it is really cool.

[23:20] But then you read the feedback, right?

[23:22] Another thing that's like really cool and it's being met with the division.

[23:26] People don't want to have to go back and buy additional things.

[23:30] When a pinball game comes out, after two years of development, everything that you want to

[23:35] have in the game should be in the game.

[23:37] You shouldn't have to go back and add more accessories at a later date.

[23:42] And that's what's starting to burn people.

[23:44] Because think about the video mode in that Scooby Doo topper.

[23:47] They could have put that video mode on the other screen in the game that came with everybody's

[23:52] game, which is just the LCD screen in the game.

[23:55] And the reason they're not doing that is they want to create FOMO if you don't buy the topper.

[24:00] And so now some people out there wrote a check for Scooby Doo that's over $12,000.

[24:05] And now their game is taken ahead.

[24:07] And now I got to spend another $969 to get the fully featured game.

[24:13] And this is where everyone is just like, I don't like this.

[24:17] Pinball should not become downloadable content disguised as toppers.

[24:21] These are not $60 video games where people don't have a problem with DLC.

[24:26] This is a $10,000 item.

[24:28] You're spending $10,000.

[24:30] You should not have to spend more money to get more features.

[24:33] But again, if you wanted to have that in the game, Spooky, then design that topper from

[24:37] the beginning with your game.

[24:39] This whole building the ship in the ocean, it's starting to rub everybody the wrong way.

[24:44] Look at Stern Pinball.

[24:46] I mean, they've disguised the fact that their LEDs with toppers are close to $15,000.

[24:53] Write $15,000 for Stern LE with a topper.

[24:56] And how did they go about disguising that?

[24:59] Well they don't even release the damn toppers when the games come out.

[25:02] You have to wait like two years and then you're dropping another $1,000 to $2,000 on a topper.

[25:07] It's absolutely stupid.

[25:08] The last game that came out where like everything was on it on day one, except for the code.

[25:14] Before that day, it was a glorious day when Stern revealed in 2016 the Batman 66 game.

[25:21] They had all three models lined up.

[25:24] They had the topper on top of the LE and the SLE.

[25:27] Now the code wasn't done, but man, when that game launched, you saw everything that that

[25:32] game was going to come with.

[25:34] And yes, the code took two years to get amazing.

[25:37] But when was the last time Stern did that?

[25:39] If they want to charge $13,000 for a limited edition of a game, and we're supposed to celebrate

[25:45] the fact that it's got a crappy barrel as a shooter rod, we don't know what the topper

[25:49] is going to be.

[25:50] Think about Foo Fighters.

[25:51] They've been bragging about what the Foo Fighters topper is going to be.

[25:54] The topper is not even out.

[25:56] The game's going to win Game of the Year.

[25:58] It's still a good game.

[25:59] It's a really good game.

[26:00] But look, I mean, the hype on it is gone.

[26:01] And now like the LE owners are waking up to the fact that they spent $13,000 and their

[26:07] game is now worth like $9,500.

[26:10] It's not Jack Danger's fault.

[26:12] It's Stern's marketing fault because they're fleecing us.

[26:15] And the market is speaking back.

[26:16] And by the time the topper comes out, who cares?

[26:19] Who cares?

[26:20] You know, I mean, they just came out with the Godzilla topper last year.

[26:23] The game's been out for two years.

[26:25] And so this is where we're at in Pinball.

[26:27] And I encourage each and every one of you.

[26:30] The easiest thing to do to enjoy this hobby is be patient.

[26:35] Don't rush at anything and just wait for the game that speaks to you.

[26:40] You don't need these games.

[26:42] You don't need a new game unless it's a game you really, really need.

[26:46] And everybody's out of space.

[26:47] And I see this.

[26:49] Everybody is out of space.

[26:50] So to move a game out that you love, something you love has to come in.

[26:54] It's like, you know, you don't break up with your girlfriend unless you find a hotter girl.

[26:59] I don't know how you were in high school, but that was my strategy.

[27:01] Yeah, baby, I love you.

[27:03] I thought that it could ever break us apart until a more attractive woman was showing me the time of day.

[27:07] Then it's like, yeah, you know, it's just not working out.

[27:09] We just don't want the same things.

[27:11] And that's what it should be like in the world of Pinball.

[27:14] And I encourage each and every one of you dial down the anger, dial down the complaining.

[27:19] If you want to send a message to Stern, you're not happy.

[27:23] Just don't buy it.

[27:25] That is the easiest way to send a message.

[27:28] If you go on pin side and argue and complain with crazy Levy and Iceman and all the characters there,

[27:34] you're just going to drive yourself crazy.

[27:37] There's no need to do that.

[27:38] And I'll end this podcast with the most hilarious item of the day,

[27:42] which is our beloved artistic friend, Christopher Franci, has two Jaws Translites left.

[27:49] Two left of his Jaws Translite, which does look amazing.

[27:53] It's got Brody on it.

[27:55] And he's been selling these things in limited fashion.

[27:58] There's been like four times he's been like, I'm never making any more.

[28:01] And then he makes more.

[28:02] And apparently he has only two left and they will fit inside a Stern machine.

[28:08] And the way he's going to do this, I'm happy to promote this for him.

[28:11] You have to email him your best offer and he's going to take the best offer.

[28:18] You're not allowed to make another bid.

[28:20] He's doing a silent auction where only he knows what the bids are.

[28:25] And he's going to pick two winners.

[28:27] Talk about trying to combine FOMO with mystery, with illegal copyrighted imagery.

[28:34] I mean, it's all right there, people.

[28:36] And he dropped this offer the day Jaws Pinball got revealed.

[28:39] I hope he tells us how much these go for.

[28:42] And here's my advice for Mr. Franci.

[28:44] Why stop with just two?

[28:46] You've already sold a bunch of these.

[28:48] You're not allowed to sell them.

[28:49] And now Stern's making a game where like you probably could sell a few hundred of these.

[28:54] If you're going to break the law a little bit, you might as well just break the law a lot

[28:59] and make a ton of money, brother.

[29:01] I mean, I just really hope Franci understands that nobody really has that much of an issue with this.

[29:06] The issue is trying to pretend like you're not doing something that's wrong.

[29:11] It's okay.

[29:12] This isn't like some terrible criminal offense.

[29:14] You're selling unlicensed artwork.

[29:17] You do it all the time.

[29:18] It's okay.

[29:19] It happens at every comic show.

[29:21] It happens all over the internet.

[29:22] Just embrace it and be a little bit of the bad guy every once in a while.

[29:26] He'd have much more fun if he was a villain like Kanata instead of trying to be the nice guy

[29:31] to all these manufacturers and then he's selling artwork that's not approved.

[29:35] It doesn't matter.

[29:36] It's really funny to me.

[29:37] It's really funny to me.

[29:38] Everybody have a great day.

[29:39] We're going to see more about Jaws today.

[29:42] And we're going to obviously, it's okay if our opinions change.

[29:46] Like it's okay if you see enough and you want to buy an LE.

[29:49] Like I'm not mad at you.

[29:50] It's your money.

[29:51] Do what you want with it.

[29:53] And I don't think we should be attacking people who get excited about the game.

[29:57] And I also don't think we should be attacking people who don't like the game.

[30:01] Like we should learn to embrace all of the opinions around this game.

[30:06] And here's the thing.

[30:07] Opinions are free.

[30:08] They don't cost you anything.

[30:10] And it's more fun to me to talk about these games and talk with all of you about these games.

[30:15] You know, it's not fun writing checks for $15,000 for something you know you don't really need.

[30:21] That's where it's not fun.

[30:23] That's where you get a little bit nervous.

[30:25] And that's where you get yourself into trouble.

[30:27] I'm seeing people in the pinball space who have bought way too many games.

[30:31] And it's clear they've overspent.

[30:33] And you can never anticipate in life you're going to make as much money tomorrow as you do today.

[30:38] I mean, my dad always taught me this.

[30:40] Live well below your means because tomorrow is not going to be as good as today.

[30:45] You shouldn't have to decide between a serious life priority and a pinball machine.

[30:50] If that's the case, you shouldn't even be in the pinball market for a new game.

[30:54] Everybody, have a great day.

[30:55] We'll talk to you soon.
