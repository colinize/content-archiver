[00:00] Sunny day.

[00:07] Sunny day.

[00:10] All right. Let's do this. Let's get the headset on.

[00:19] We've got.

[00:23] Let's move that pillow.

[00:26] Let's move that pillow. Move.

[00:32] Ah, beautiful day. Beautiful day, everybody. How's everybody doing?

[00:39] Welcome to Knit is Saturday morning spectacular where we talk about everything going on in pinball.

[00:46] It's it's it's a beautiful sunny Saturday here. I hope everybody had a great Thanksgiving.

[00:55] Hi from Barcelona.

[00:59] Get some morning show and Wisconsin. How's everybody doing?

[01:05] I'm feeling good today. I'm feeling good today.

[01:09] I love Thanksgiving. I love the fact that Thanksgiving just turns into like a very long

[01:15] weekend of food, family football.

[01:20] You know reconnecting with friends at the local bars.

[01:25] You know building new relationships with people here locally.

[01:29] But it's just so much fun. I just feel like everyone's in the right mood on Thanksgiving.

[01:35] I think Christmas gets a little lonely or for some people gets it's cooler.

[01:40] I think Christmas also like doesn't always fall on a Thursday. I think I love the fact that Thanksgiving is always on a Thursday.

[01:48] And it's like you know it's beautiful.

[01:51] Sometimes I don't even know when Christmas is this year but when it falls on like a weekend.

[01:54] It I don't know it just feels like everyone's working too hard and then you crash in the New Year's and then I don't know there's just like that.

[02:02] Sobreness of New Year's I always felt like New Year's Eve was the most depressing holiday.

[02:07] Ah you didn't overheat.

[02:09] Hmm. How's everybody doing? Welcome to Canadian's pinball Saturday morning spectacular baby.

[02:16] Oh we got we got less people than normal but you know people are just getting the notification.

[02:21] Sometimes people forget I also just think people are busy this weekend traveling.

[02:25] You know the one thing you don't want to do is turn on Canadians Saturday morning spectacular when you're at a rolls house.

[02:31] It's not neat. I'm like what do you there'll be like what are you watching? Who is this clown?

[02:39] Ah glitching for me.

[02:43] What's up guys. I might have to lower the shades a little bit. Hold on.

[02:47] It's coming in right from there.

[02:49] It's hot.

[02:54] There we go.

[02:55] Some better lighting.

[02:57] Oh.

[03:02] You know I haven't really thought about the fact that it's going to be December on Monday.

[03:15] You know we're going to get down to that countdown to Beetlejuice on the line.

[03:20] We're going to get that countdown to Stern's next cornerstone in January like first week of January.

[03:28] Got me a 4k TMNT. Is it a good deal?

[03:34] Like 4,000 on the dot or like 49.95.

[03:40] You know I always felt TMNT was one of Stern's most beautiful world on their glass games.

[03:46] It's a weird game to me like you know like I feel like for some reason again just like yet he's art on it isn't as like crisp you know it's like the way Stern printed it.

[04:04] It's not his art that's the issue it's like the way they printed that game.

[04:08] It's not as like vibrant as I want it.

[04:12] You know look the only thing that ruined TMNT is the left out lane is so so brutal the game's too hard.

[04:19] I think it's not fun because it's brutal.

[04:24] You know what we talked about at the Thanksgiving table and it was the first time in 30 years that me my twin and my older brother all got together with my parents.

[04:37] I think I've said this before but me and my twin brother were a strange from my older brother for about 30 years.

[04:47] And if you know what having an a strange mint situation is like it was it was hard I mean I I grew up in my 20s and 30s and even most of my 40s.

[05:00] We never got everybody together for the holidays so we used to have like schedule holidays and Thanksgiving's I woke up many Christmas mornings just by myself in New York City just because I just you know if they were spending it with him and I didn't go home and it was bad it was bad.

[05:17] Everybody's reconciled that they're all these years and you know unfortunately it took a tragic loss to bring everybody together.

[05:26] But a lot a lot to be thankful for.

[05:34] So yeah I had a great Thanksgiving it was very special and we talked about you know we talked about we talked about conspiracy theories it's fun it's a fun thing to talk about we talked about the moon landing.

[05:46] We talked about flatter hollow earth.

[05:50] Did God create the planet all the good stuff you know as we as we chow down on turkey happy Saturday everybody.

[06:00] Man I got to crack the window it's hot in your hold on hold on.

[06:09] Okay that's nice.

[06:14] Ah good morning.

[06:18] Tux we're thinking about you brother man we're thinking about you love you man.

[06:24] Tux is one of the good guys one of the good guys I met Tux years ago down at a T.P.F.

[06:35] Tux isn't it crazy like Derek doesn't talk to me anymore simply because I didn't vote for Kamala Harris not to start out with politics right but he still won't he still won't reach out.

[06:45] And I see him on a pin side and it's really weird it's still it's still crazy to me that he was literally my best friend in all the pinball.

[06:53] And we were so close for years I mean years.

[06:57] He was supposed to go to Tokyo with me next year for my 50th birthday and it's crazy because he like rage quit the hobby he canceled me as a friend because I didn't vote his way politically.

[07:08] And then and I don't even like Trump I just don't want I just didn't want Kamala Harris I told him that I don't like Trump but I like my money more.

[07:17] Not that that's not that he's done a good job either this is a thing about politics like I can admit that Trump has done a horrible job with the economy horrible like he he's did everything so expensive wages are not going up the tear of stuff's not working nothing nothing's working really okay.

[07:33] But all that being said.

[07:36] Having a conservative in office for me is just better for my dollar and it's just I don't know I just feel like they have a little bit more common sense and I get I get it's just the party of common sense is going to win moving forward but anyway.

[07:46] All that under the bridge now crazy that he still runs back into pinball and hasn't even just been like hey man sorry for doing that crazy.

[07:59] Now he went he went full like rage I mean he's and like I respect Eric he's full he's he's very he's as far left as they come.

[08:11] I just think it's weird to not when you know what's in someone's heart and you know that they're a good person I think it's really sad to allow politics to override what's in someone's heart.

[08:27] And I think it's sad.

[08:32] Yeah now the little stuff never matters man we we take way too much for granted every single day so.

[08:41] So let's talk about pinball people that's why we're here let's talk about I love the fact that the spooky beetle juice spots are starting to just kind of even out now I think.

[08:52] I think 5,000 is kind of like the new benchmark over sticker to get a beetle juice I do think.

[09:02] You know like what's crazy is that's that's 5,000 over before butter and topper people are spending to.

[09:14] So there's going to be there's going to be a lot of money some people put into this game I just think beetles juice much like Harry Potter CE I've been saying it for a while I don't think it's a game that's going to go in and out of people's collections very often.

[09:29] If you if you got a chance hopefully you listen to my podcast this morning I want to first and foremost thank everybody here who's a Canadian club member whether you're listening on Facebook or YouTube.

[09:38] And you sign up for the show every single month I'm super happy to have you as a as a listener and I really am thankful for every dollar.

[09:48] Oh my god killing get in here look at this get in here.

[09:54] Okay say hi the help is here you look just like them.

[10:00] I love that you look amazing kill just close the door.

[10:05] You know my mom is going to have to make that because only one back in the house.

[10:16] There was two bags and once missing a hat.

[10:21] Cass doesn't have a hat.

[10:26] Oh.

[10:29] Hat drama.

[10:32] Hat drama in the.

[10:37] Is it supposed to come with a hat.

[10:41] Alright we'll get you we'll get a hat.

[10:46] I feel good when he opens the door it's like hot I don't know why I'm so like I just got back into gym.

[10:55] So here's the thing I think that Harry Potter I've been saying this.

[11:00] Harry Potter and Beetlejuice will probably end up being the new foundation for modern pinball collections that people are building.

[11:12] I think it's a good thing.

[11:15] I think there's a real issue with Stern.

[11:20] You know I don't know what Stern does now like how does Stern survive completely losing collectors.

[11:28] You know how do they do that?

[11:33] How do they continue to make three tier model.

[11:38] I think they're going to have to seriously seriously start thinking about what they do to reestablish their their model.

[11:46] Because remember when Stern had the three tier model there was nobody else.

[11:50] There was maybe one other company two other companies.

[11:53] And you know the games are half the price.

[11:56] And they use that model to get all those orders from distros and you know if you weren't distributing Stern games you weren't you weren't making any money.

[12:06] And then how it is I think it's.

[12:09] You know they just I don't know how they keep everybody like ordering these games every day like it just doesn't make sense to me.

[12:18] You need a franche in your foundation franche if you don't put the delorean on the side of the back to the future SLE.

[12:26] You and I are going to have problems it's right there man it's right there same angle as the batman bill it's right there.

[12:34] I want the one with the I want the one from back to the future to with the was it the juicer in the back to the the gas it up.

[12:48] Is it weird if a distro says you got a beetle juice spot but hasn't taken a deposit.

[12:55] Yeah Joe I don't that should that doesn't make any sense.

[12:59] The reason I don't like whoever's doing that to you is you don't have a contract of sale yet.

[13:06] And until you have a contract of sale I would be very nervous just taking someone's word for it all the deposits have been paid by now.

[13:17] So I don't like that deal.

[13:20] And I think it's I think you should get it in writing I think you if you have a show game or a regular game.

[13:29] I am to please.

[13:31] Well look you know we've been talking about it.

[13:34] Franchie Gremlins franchie goonies franchie back to the future it's one big F you discern I love that franchie kind of had the.

[13:44] You know franchie let's talk about your journey for a little bit right I mean you kind of you've seen the highs and lows the ups and downs.

[13:51] You made the best produced podcast and pinball history.

[13:57] I've never seen a man.

[14:00] I've never seen a man work harder fall on his sword more times than you.

[14:07] And really.

[14:10] Do everything a grown man can do to get back into the good graces of stern and I and they just never really reciprocated properly when the timing was right.

[14:21] And I know that like maybe Jeremy you know reached out but by the time they did.

[14:27] I have to imagine it was just too late and it was the principle of it all.

[14:32] And also you know I was there man like I was there so so few people saw it happen man like I was there when Gary just like went psycho just because you know we were selling we you were selling a few beetles you know prince like it was stupid there was no.

[14:54] That was that was inappropriate the way he handled it and it was a.

[15:00] Yeah it was just just kind of show you like how over react how they overreacted and how they don't even understand the way artworks at these shows and with with artists they do it all the time.

[15:13] Yeah so but we're so happy man I mean I think everybody when you start to look at the the hobby and I really do mean is I really think people want to start supporting companies and people in places where they really feel a strong connection to the individuals to the personalities and they want it's the same reason why you buy from this dealer that dealer you know you want to help people out that you you like.

[15:39] And franchi is one of those people where we just feel good about buying his creations.

[15:47] I like I like Christopher franchi I like it I like him because he's broken and you know what I mean like I'm the same way like I'm a broken human being I like him that he's not like always he doesn't always say the appropriate thing I like it that he jumps in and defends his work.

[16:09] I like it that he sometimes flies off the handle I like people like that now look he and I would probably say hey it's nicer when you kind of can get calm and collected and not over react because you know sometimes when you over react you have to wake up and then deal with the consequences of such behavior.

[16:31] But much like myself I relate to someone who who does continue to improve and get better at everything is that not what life is about you know as I raise these little kids you're always trying to just improve and get a little bit better a little bit more professional a little bit more polished as we get older I think by age like you know by your 50s you know you kind of have to have to realize like your tool to be at the bar the night before Thanksgiving you know you have to you sometimes when I see some people.

[17:00] If sometimes when I see some people like too much at the bar my gun no no.

[17:10] Yeah no David he crushed evil dead.

[17:14] Oh let's see it's so hot I don't know why it's so hot I need to open it or hold on.

[17:20] I think that has the heat on.

[17:31] I'm not I'm not as animated today screaming about pinball because you know.

[17:43] Okay so we've got spooky let's go around the horn evil dead.

[17:48] Beetle juice bangers we've got stern Star Wars dead on arrival the walking dead let's talk about the walking dead man like I've been.

[17:59] People have been sending me clips and they're like hey man look at the look at the animations maybe it's just the way they're filmed I think it might be that because sometimes when you film.

[18:09] I don't know if they're laggy or not but like the raspberry pie that stern put into spike three is so cheap I'm worried about them and I feel like.

[18:19] While they made the screen bigger I still just think Stern is just trying to reduce their costs and it they're kind of stuck now.

[18:29] With a platform that looks like it look I got I got to be candid here.

[18:35] If beetle juice is 10 grand stern Ali is look like 8500.

[18:42] I'm going to play in a tournament today do you ever actually play pinball.

[18:49] No I've never played pinball before in my life.

[18:52] I'll say this gang and you know if you're a tournament player and you enjoy spending hour hours upon hours in pinball tournaments I hold nothing against you.

[19:07] Years ago I'm going to be completely candid years ago I entered a pinball league and I hated it.

[19:16] Because everybody was so annoying and competitive and it was it wasn't any fun and I literally would be in this bar for three hours.

[19:29] And I just thought it'd be more fun like drinking that look some of you have pinball leagues that are fun that like no one takes it too seriously.

[19:39] And you're all just there to have beer and play some pin and put up scores and if it was like that I absolutely would enjoy playing pinball more in a league but with a league I joined in New York City.

[19:52] What it was like competitive it was aggressive and it was annoying and so I just decided to not join anymore leagues and I also didn't want to spend three hours to win 40 bucks.

[20:09] We don't have any retro ralps in our league.

[20:13] Chris who really has goonies do you think spooky has spooky has goonies now I did hear that the goonies license is an exclusive I would highly doubt we're going to see two goonies machines.

[20:27] So I mean that's that's where I'm at with pinball I'm happy for people that play it.

[20:32] I will say this in my experience in this hobby I've experienced a lot more rudeness and rude behavior and the people that tend to hate me the most are the people that don't listen to my content and their tournament players.

[20:51] So to me those people like they they act like they're entitled to this hobby and they don't like the conversation around price and new box because they never buy anything new in box.

[21:00] To me they're more like leeches who just you know they they literally and the way some of them treat this I mean this when I say this the way some of these tournament players treat other people's property is disgusting.

[21:17] Let me repeat that the way they treat other people's expensive pinball machines is disgusting.

[21:25] I have seen people kick machines slam them into other machines next to it like throw stuff at like disgusting.

[21:34] Would you I literally have never seen such childlike behavior to keep your ball in play.

[21:40] I mean think about gang where do you always see where is most of the drama in the pinball world is it happened amongst new no it's happening.

[21:51] League nights like this why through my drink and Tim sexton's face we want to go though let's go there the reason why Tim sexton.

[21:59] Got a drink thrown in his face and yeah I shouldn't I shouldn't done it but like we live in a world what was I knew I was going to hit the guy but he deserved to get he deserved he does I don't condone violence but the dude deserves something and at least he got a.

[22:10] The Vaca soda which you know what it was it was brand new drink he if anything hopefully he got a few a few ounces of vodka in his mouth.

[22:19] I was cheering for Lyman sheets his girlfriend and he gets all like you're standing in front of the yellow line canado and then he gets on a chair and he announces in front of everybody canada has been banned from this tournament please escort him off the prop like a loser like what are you doing loser red a pinball tournament i'm cheering for somebody.

[22:40] The reason why he kicked me out is because the woman that penny was competing against was mad that I was cheering for penny okay I wasn't I wasn't cheering against her she was mad that her competitor had someone cheering on her behalf talk about petty caddy lane.

[23:05] Now like I'm going to go out on a limb and say maybe canada's not the most popular guy with you know certain pinball leagues and and but I've never been disrespectful to anybody in this hobby I don't care who you are like I've never been disrespectful other than that you know Timmy sex didn't experience but I've never like you know I've never gone on any stupid like missions against people I've never said there shouldn't be this league or that league or the you know these people.

[23:35] Should be allowed to play I've never a cost in anybody I've never said anything inappropriate to like anybody so like other than the stuff I say to manufacturers which I'd say to their faces right.

[23:50] I just know this whenever you go to a pinball show and you look into the tournament room it looks like nobody's having any fun.

[23:58] That's it who's making peewee's big adventure I hope it's spooky.

[24:05] I thought one of the rules that tournaments is that I bet nobody follows is quiet when someone is playing.

[24:12] So like your plan is loud game and you got to be quiet like it's golf and tennis how silly is that why would you have to be but why would she complain if I'm rooting for someone else penny wasn't complaining.

[24:28] Well he kicked me out of the tournament yeah those the New York City Pimble do they still do the New York City Pimble championships.

[24:36] Do they still even host that thing I don't even know maybe I haven't I haven't followed if it went on maybe it stopped after a COVID who knows.

[24:45] Men are now competing in women's tournaments.

[24:48] I saw some some big some big conversation around that it's some was it some tournament down in like North Carolina or something.

[25:05] I don't know you know the way I look at it is probably the only solution is to have separate leagues for people you know I've always found it funny though that the like is the funny thing about pinball is like when you think about like see if you had a nudge if you had no nudging tournaments can are there tournaments with like no nudging ostensibly men and women without a single one.

[25:35] Because you could argue like men don't have an advantage in pinball over women they clearly do when it comes to like nudging and moving around a 300 pound box so absolutely I think men have more of an advantage with anyone disagree with that because I I it's a physical when you're when you're shaking a three to 400 pound machine around and you're slapping at it like it's it's absolutely.

[26:01] It's not apples to apples now if you had a nudge free tournament then absolutely there would there be no you know there be no advantage.

[26:15] So I love it when like kids get up there and win that's always my favorite.

[26:20] My favorite is when like someone will get up there like like be like 13 and win the championship or be like you know autistic like was it Robert like is it Robert got I should know his name.

[26:31] He's amazing like I love it I love it when these kids just get up there put headphones on and just get the business and just like wipe the floor with everybody.

[26:46] It was funny though and you guys listen to canators pinball podcast.

[26:51] You know my my shows never really been about gameplay per se.

[26:55] You know this hobby is fun for me because I I 100% would like to play more pinball I am in a little bit of a pinball desert right here.

[27:09] That's about to change and I'm talking to people about changing that.

[27:14] So when that does happen you will get a lot more gameplay from me so I'm excited for you guys to see some of that.

[27:21] So just you know a lot of fun stuff is in the works and it's a it's I think you guys are going to enjoy it when you see it and I think the the final indictment of canada that he doesn't play enough pinball I think will be a thing of the past a year from now.

[27:38] Six months from now maybe two months from now we'll see it will see.

[27:43] You know I definitely have enjoyed looking at these photos of the warehouse in Chicago where everybody drops ships from.

[27:52] So what's funny guy is like this is been probably one of the best kept secrets and all the pinball that everybody knows that there is legitimately a humongous company that is where most of these dealers and distros.

[28:12] Are shipping their product from.

[28:15] They they I love watching it I love watching the pictures of it I love the videos of it I have all the information I can't wait to give them a call hey I'd like to be on this what do you got Jimmy.

[28:28] How many you know seeing stern machines pile to the ceiling what do you got.

[28:32] It's just it's funny to me though that there's like nervousness it's like nobody wants you know one of them my favorite shows ever was with them.

[28:45] Oh God what's his name.

[28:48] Was it Chris for Ben.

[28:54] Who's like who did I interview that time that leaked.

[28:58] He basically leaked and he wasn't supposed to how much the bomb is on a stern machine it was um why do I want to say like Chris something from pinball the pinball company I think it was the pinball company.

[29:18] Great guy him and his wife successful operator distributor.

[29:22] Yeah it was like 3500 bucks for us to the stern bomb on a machine.

[29:33] Steven see I that's what I want I want to go get wasted and play pinball.

[29:39] How do you know he's right because he was a he he literally was about to get a game made by stern.

[29:50] I also know he's right because stern flipped out on him and made he they made him reach out to me to edit out that part of the show.

[30:02] I would say the bomb that game I mean let's just use our brains the bomb on a stern game if a pro is.

[30:10] 6.7 hundred right.

[30:13] I would say the bomb on a stern Ellie is like five.

[30:20] You got to remember they're handing over I think they're handing twenty three hundred dollars over to a distro to sell an Ellie.

[30:30] Like like when you think about that.

[30:34] 23 hundred dollars per Ellie the problem is they make you to get that elite margin you've got to absorb the premiums and the pros as well.

[30:43] You know did you guys take advantage of any of these black Friday deals.

[30:50] People selling like you know forklift injured games with scratches on the bottom amazing that there was like I think Zach had like five machines or four machines all with the same damage.

[31:03] I guess it happens with the shipping the forklifts.

[31:06] It is a it is a clever way if you think about it to sell new inbox below map pricing.

[31:15] I'm not sure if like insurance companies like if those are right off games or whatnot but I mean there's about four or five of them was funny to see that stuff.

[31:24] Yeah there's a John Wick on Amazon for forty five hundred.

[31:28] I don't know man.

[31:30] I don't know I worry about a lot of the older stern inventory moving anywhere like I just there's got to be.

[31:40] There's got to be like thousands of games unsolved at prices nobody wants to buy them at.

[31:49] Wow so you can get a John Wick for forty five hundred was is it new inbox the John Wick on Amazon or is it like one of these resell games.

[32:03] I love that like we got Chris Chris Chris Elana our patron Chris Lorenzo Lorenzo Lorenzo Lorenzo.

[32:12] He loves John Wick swears by it.

[32:21] That's an I bet Amazon just does that on their own they had four.

[32:28] I mean yeah I mean John Wick Pro though it's like one of those games where I wouldn't really want it.

[32:36] No matter the price like you know I'm saying I wouldn't even want to spend forty five hundred on it.

[32:43] Those forty five hundred Wick orders got canceled are you sure Stephen.

[32:48] So someone saying that those orders never even went through.

[32:59] I've always wondered and been curious back when you started why did you decide on the Akira character for your podcast.

[33:06] So I have always I'll give you guys the quick story on this I went to boarding school in nineteen ninety.

[33:20] Let's see nineteen ninety.

[33:23] I'm trying to think the years I've graduated.

[33:26] I'm trying to get it for.

[33:32] I went to boarding school in nineteen ninety two and nineteen ninety three.

[33:39] Okay.

[33:42] Now when I was a kid Akira like I watched the VHS tape when in the in the eighties when it came out like it was like eighty six eighty seven.

[33:50] But it was like one of those like films that you know one kid had a copy.

[33:56] And I remember like watching Akira as you should say it.

[34:02] It's a canada. It's Canada. It's not canada. It's Canada.

[34:08] I remember like just it just blew my mind.

[34:12] And then what was really when we got like surround sound systems in in boarding school and in college.

[34:20] You know when you really listen to that thing on like a good home theater it like laser disk Akira.

[34:27] But anyway I just always love the character of can canada. I just loved I thought he was like the coolest dude ever.

[34:33] And so whenever I would sign up on to forums I would always make my online screen name or avatar canada since like I was a kid.

[34:45] You know it's crazy canada was always my name on my G&R forum.

[34:49] And I mean I let you thought you thought I was bad on Pinside I like trolled G&R for like a decade from like nineteen ninety eight.

[34:58] All the way to like two thousand eight right.

[35:02] And when I met Axa Rose for the first time.

[35:06] The first thing he said to me was are you canada because he knew like he would read the forums and it stuff would get get to him.

[35:13] And I was like brutal at times.

[35:17] And so I kind of feel like that was an amazing full circle moment for me in my life of like the first thing Axa Rose ever said to me after he shook my hand was are you canada.

[35:29] I feel proud about that.

[35:32] By the way guns and roses has two songs coming out on Tuesday.

[35:37] They're like it's like new old stock they're releasing a song called nothing and a song called Atlas Shrugged which I think they're just going to call Atlas which is kind of I always hate when they like they change the names like at the last minute like they they change like street of dreams to the blues or the blues the street of dreams.

[35:57] It's just like why doesn't the US dub of Akira have like three of the original turtles voices and I don't know I love I love the original dub of Akira.

[36:07] And also like when you just when you just appreciate the artwork of of Akira you know 26 frames per second and the entire thing is illustrated.

[36:21] You go back and you look at that movie and how smooth it is 26 frames of illustrations every second.

[36:30] It was really like not much like that ever before and when they were finished filming the movie they threw out those cells like they were sawdust and literally in the mid 90s there was a catalog to order the like cells from Akira.

[36:47] And it was cheap like you get like 500 bucks here 800 bucks there like few hundred bucks most recently at auction.

[36:55] A nice cell of canada on his bike just sold for a hundred thousand dollars for one cell.

[37:04] Now the reason like I was tempted to buy it the reason I don't want to buy original cells from an anime is I did a lot of reading on it and to preserve them.

[37:15] You really aren't even supposed to put them in in normal light and you shouldn't even have them out like they should be covered in a drawer like with paper over them.

[37:28] And you know in a climate control place and I'm like well what would be the fun in that like if you can't display it on the wall like for a hundred thousand dollars like you could just hire someone to make you.

[37:38] You for like a few thousand dollars you can get the most amazing custom I get it's not originally from the movie.

[37:45] But I would want to walk into the room and see something that is magical instead of having it stored away because then you're just like owning it to resell it one day.

[37:58] A little bit of so though he was talking to the six time trippy winner yeah.

[38:02] Like a cure would make a great pinball theme.

[38:11] You need to use the a cure theme song as your podcast intro again for a throwback.

[38:17] Well you know I'm you that I still do use the canada I just it's just it's the same song it's just a different it's a different section of the song.

[38:28] You know so yeah I know what you're talking about though you're talking about like the.

[38:35] See I said I said I said I said I said I said I say like I don't have that part going I have like the.

[38:45] Like just the the kind of the ending of it all the music in in in a carol is like just phenomenal to do to do to do to do to do to do to do to do.

[38:57] I

[38:59] Start I got to be honest. I was a little buzz last night

[39:02] We started stranger things season five and I can't get over how old the kids look

[39:06] I don't know if it's good or not if you guys invested in it yet

[39:09] But I spent the whole time being like these kids look so stupid. They look so dumb like it

[39:14] It just doesn't work anymore like how old they love

[39:17] And

[39:20] That's the pink pan

[39:22] You bet you know the I don't know when that when those dolls are coming alive. It's so creepy

[39:31] A cure is like an acid trip movie though like after the like most people remember the first 15 minutes then it gets really trippy

[39:38] All right, I heard good things about stranger things even season five so I'm gonna I'm gonna get into it

[39:48] I need to do better at now starting stuff when I'm drunk you guys ever do that you guys ever get drunk

[39:53] Let's watch it now, you know men are like that like we get drunk. We're like let's do it now

[39:59] You know like we go in with such good intentions and then 10 minutes into the movie you fall asleep

[40:04] That's like me as an adult. Let's do it Brenda. Let's start it now and then I'm asleep in five minutes

[40:18] Franchise got a steelbook DVD of a Kira

[40:22] Yeah, man, I mean I'll take it, Franchise. Well, I'll swap you for something

[40:30] Yeah, Michael, what's up brother?

[40:34] Michael and I met up the other day Michael's a great guy. We're gonna we're gonna have some fun brother

[40:39] Yeah, my kids are just they're too young for stranger things. I I will say I love watching my little boys and

[40:46] You know, I can't wait for them to grow up. I'm enjoying every day with them at this age though

[40:50] It's so adorable like watching them. It's like cast looks like a little cabbage batch

[40:55] Doll that that's had too many Valky's

[40:58] And kills like his daddy kills just like Axa Rose

[41:02] He's like a prima Donna

[41:04] The moment some things not going killings way he just like throws the mic over his shoulder and cancels the concert

[41:11] And I'm always like well where do you get that from and I'm like, oh sounds a lot like his daddy like entitled behavior

[41:18] Where he melts down instantly? Hmm sounds like canadus kid

[41:24] What's your feelings on JP to win leaving Jersey Jack Pimbal? I think it's I think it's a humongous loss for Jersey Jack

[41:32] I think it's a tremendous game for

[41:35] Dutch Pimbal. I think it's gonna make back to the future insane

[41:41] And you know, I guess the question I have is did he leave for good or maybe he's just taking a break

[41:47] Maybe they didn't need him as much on Sonic. I don't know I

[41:52] Can't imagine

[41:54] Anybody would pay you more than the Abyss family. I don't know maybe Joe

[41:58] Camnicow paid him more. I don't know

[42:04] Like I highly doubt they let him go. I think he must have wanted out. I think it's that simple

[42:13] You know what I'm saying I highly doubt

[42:18] They had a choice I mean that I know Brett. I know that people over at JJP

[42:24] Sometimes people just want a new opportunity. They want to go somewhere else

[42:29] You go and automate it for their yearly party next Saturday

[42:34] um

[42:36] Absolutely I always go

[42:39] I got to put it in the calendar though. I never tell Brenda anything. I never give her a heads up

[42:43] And I'm like oh yeah, by the way, I'm going to automate it. She's like what?

[42:47] I got I got to make sure I make sure she's not doing anything

[42:50] Do you think he got backlash from AI gate since he was the head of the art department?

[42:57] Um, that's a good question. I don't I don't think so

[43:02] I don't think that's why he's leaving

[43:07] But you know what that's not a bad guess that's not a bad guess. I mean

[43:12] Uh, I don't think it was his fault

[43:14] I you know again like the whole they they corrected that pretty quickly

[43:19] I remember seeing the dragon for the first time how small it was on the play field and me like all this all this

[43:25] hubba-bubba-lub

[43:27] for that

[43:30] But it is what it is

[43:33] Yeah

[43:37] Well when people say he's the best by far

[43:40] um

[43:43] Yes and no

[43:44] And here's what I mean by that

[43:47] I think some of the jersey jack stuff on the display is like way too crowded

[43:53] And I think some of their I even think Harry Potter to be honest has too much going on on the screen at once

[43:59] I've said this my two favorite like uses usages

[44:05] My two favorite usages of the jersey jacks screen are dialed in in guns and roses

[44:12] I think on all the other games. I've got to be honest

[44:15] I'm not a huge fan of how they've

[44:18] Utilized that large screen. I think dialed in and gnr did it the best

[44:25] Hobbit had too much on it wizard of Oz had too much on it um

[44:30] You know pirates of the Caribbean forget it man like you need you literally need someone over your shoulder explaining pirates

[44:36] Like the most complex thing happening

[44:40] Same thing with um, I guess wonka was better. I would I would put wonka as the third best use of the screen

[44:48] And then maybe um toy story after that

[44:52] But again like it's just it was always like

[44:58] Just too much, you know like

[45:01] It's like they always had a crowd it was so much stuff

[45:04] So you know, I've always said this about jersey jack the the when they simplify it the the real beauty comes out

[45:16] How bad is the walking dead display can we talk about this for a minute?

[45:20] Can we talk about like stern pinball has a their logo on the screen

[45:26] Their logo

[45:27] That's like watching a marvel movie and the marvel logo is just permanently

[45:31] Watermark in the upper right corner

[45:34] Has stern pinball lost all taste

[45:38] Like is nobody over there got any taste or style at all

[45:42] Now is that just placeholder or is that gonna stay there? I don't know

[45:47] And it's not my fault for making fun of it because I shouldn't have to wait

[45:51] For license or approval they should have showed the game after it was approved

[45:57] But it looks terrible

[45:59] It looks terrible

[46:04] I I'm so embarrassed for stern

[46:08] Star Wars displaced garbage this one doesn't look good

[46:14] I think the last good display they had

[46:18] Was like I think jaws

[46:23] You know what I don't like is like why did why doesn't why didn't jaws 50 it get a bigger screen

[46:29] I

[46:31] Been I've been saying I think stern's gonna offer the bigger screen upgrade

[46:37] As a as a thing

[46:39] I'm not sure if it's gonna happen it would seem to make the most sense but

[46:43] I mean think about all the money they can make if they got everybody upgrading the screens. I just don't like the way it looks

[46:49] It really is you know david just hit it here like bigger screen with less graphics like what are they doing like they they've got a bigger screen and they've

[46:58] Haven't effectively gone full screen on anything yet

[47:05] Yes, see pads are cage is said this to the background animations are choppy is that true in person though pat pat

[47:11] Have you played it in person? I think everything looks choppy when you film

[47:15] When you film a screen it makes everything choppy I pat I'd be curious if you played it though

[47:23] They already mentioned they would offer it eventually where do they mention that pinball studio

[47:27] Like I pinball where did I miss that the George say that somewhere

[47:33] Dude I played it yesterday animations look good

[47:36] So you played the walking dead and the stern logo was staring back at you the whole time and you think that looks good

[47:44] I think it looks I just think it looks silly

[47:47] I

[47:55] Just think it looks it looks really like that was a

[47:58] Weird design direction now I what everyone's waiting for is whether or not the show clips are gonna make it into the game and be animated over that

[48:08] I don't know I don't think anyone's seen the final code or what it's gonna be

[48:15] Um

[48:16] ACDC being next is silly

[48:20] I really I really hope stern makes a batman a new batman

[48:25] Sad boy baby you're back. Yeah, man. I was waiting for your arrival

[48:30] It's the only dude that arrives with 50 bucks on the table every time apologies for my late arrival

[48:35] I literally just got done with a late night booty call

[48:39] Jesus

[48:42] Almost 8 a.m. On the west coast how about that waltz wood shirt baby the best

[48:49] Where's waltz? I mean I got I got to order one of his t-shirts. I

[48:53] Um, I really do wish waltz would just come back and

[48:57] I don't understand why he he lasted all of 20 minutes on the canada club before he rage left

[49:04] Because of a misunderstanding

[49:06] He got self-moderated apparently by like the bot on patreon and just raged out and then then quit pinball all together

[49:14] All within a span of an hour. It was the most uh literally

[49:17] I was at the Japanese jazz bar and I'm just like I have no idea what was happening

[49:24] I don't understand how these companies keep releasing half-baked games

[49:27] Well, the the reason they do it because idiots buy it when it's half baked

[49:31] You know like I wouldn't buy any I wouldn't buy any stern new inbox now

[49:36] I don't care what the stern is anymore unless it's like a dream theme that's got 80s or 90s nostalgia

[49:42] I think every stern is such an await and see and save money on it like absolutely

[49:47] They have lost all new inbox FOMO. There's no need to buy any of them

[49:54] Like the walking get remastered as a good example like no one cares

[49:59] Like anyone you bet anyone you buys that game for 13. I get you might want to hold on to it forever

[50:04] But you're not going to and also here's why here's what sucks is you're gonna go buy it for 13,000

[50:11] Justified and then you're gonna see himself for 10 in just a few months

[50:15] So I don't see that's the part I don't get

[50:17] Why did you need to buy it for 13 if you if you're smart you're looking at the market

[50:22] Why would you want to spend 3000 more than you have to

[50:26] That's the part I don't get. I'm not saying don't get the game. I'm just saying only an idiot would buy it new inbox right away

[50:32] They're gonna sit they didn't sell out. They're gonna sit. They're gonna go down in price

[50:40] Would you want a Batman 60th if it didn't do the art if I didn't do the artwork no

[50:46] No, no

[50:48] Absolutely not franchi

[50:51] So I guess this is is franchi so you're

[50:57] They they haven't they haven't contacted you I assume and they're not doing it

[51:02] You know, it's funny about Stern is they literally should do Batman 60th

[51:08] There's demand for it and they won't simply because they don't want to pay franchi again

[51:15] Crazy

[51:20] Yeah, you know what must have happened to the up I stern must have put a season to cis on that guy making the updated screens from jack bar

[51:32] People here in Australia pay 20,000 for food fighters Ellie and now they sell for 14,000

[51:43] Um, well, you know

[51:46] Yeah, but here's the thing gang and it's all from like food fighters on

[51:52] The last three years three to four years

[51:55] You gotta remember those people didn't know that yet so I give people a pass

[52:04] No one knew that these 13,000 dollars sternalees would crash down to like

[52:09] 8 to 10,000 so you know so consistently

[52:14] When food fighters sold out quickly at 13, you know, it was still the covid period like people were still going crazy

[52:22] So like the

[52:26] The what

[52:29] Hold on a second the elf is eating. I got it. Let me just see hold on one second

[52:36] Give me one minute

[52:55] You

[53:25] You

[53:55] You

[54:25] Oh

[54:28] Oh my god

[54:30] That was beautiful

[54:33] So by the way how amazing would a team be as a pin like look at that

[54:38] If you made a pinball machine with the a team and the cabinet looks like the van

[54:44] And the top is the spoiler of the van

[54:48] Nope, let's make do

[54:50] Um

[54:52] The so killing was like the elves are eating and I went down there and they're both dressed like elves

[54:58] Eating the pasta with the marshmallows and maple syrup. It's the most adorable thing I've ever seen

[55:03] Brenda's doing the holiday card right now. It's incredible

[55:08] Ah man

[55:11] How's everybody doing

[55:13] So

[55:15] So the jaws 50th topper is just the same topper with the red frame around it. Did you guys know that?

[55:22] Is this an exclusive

[55:28] So the so you know like the amnihil

[55:33] The woman swimming the billboard is just got a red frame around it

[55:39] That's what it is

[55:43] You

[55:49] Get your black Friday deals for cliff damaged

[55:53] You can have it today. You'll never see the damage

[55:58] I wouldn't mind buying a game with a forklift scratch

[56:02] Underneath the game

[56:04] He literally would never see it

[56:14] I don't know man like sterns days of flat plastic laziness are really gonna have to come to an end

[56:24] It's it's really embarrassing

[56:27] So um

[56:30] Can I ask a question when david venez showed the

[56:36] The line going

[56:38] Todd tucky did the video of those guys on the line at barrels

[56:42] Building the winch esters

[56:44] Did those games go out

[56:47] Like did they did they get completed that week and go to customers has anybody unboxed one yet

[56:56] The forklift damage forklift yeah

[56:58] The

[57:10] The new evil dead code is awesome earning spooky tokens to play some wizard modes is a great idea

[57:17] You know that like about you know what what bug was saying in in the interview in the feature at about fetal juice is how

[57:25] As a company as as an organization

[57:29] They just continue to look

[57:32] For things they can improve in a pinball machine

[57:35] Everything from code to sculpts the toppers to the area around the speaker grills

[57:42] You know they on the apron to stern feel like they do that

[57:47] The stern feel like a company that

[57:49] Really looks head to toe on the machine and says how can we improve everything

[57:53] How can we make every aspect of pinball better with our new platform

[57:57] And then that's the thing it's like nope

[58:00] Nope

[58:01] It's same old same old flat plastics

[58:04] cheap this bad artwork

[58:08] lazy design cheap glow worm job of the hut. It's just it's embarrassed. I'm embarrassed for them

[58:14] Star Wars is so embarrassing

[58:18] To put out star wars in 2025 as the best you can do as an organization that

[58:23] Knows how to do so much better is embarrassing

[58:32] You know I hear so much um

[58:35] I I don't know about Kong. I don't know. I have to play it more. I just hear I hear so much

[58:42] Polarizing stuff around Kong

[58:44] Barrels of fun had a social media post about the production schedule for Winchester. They did all right. Let's find it hold on

[58:55] Let's find it

[58:59] Barrels of phone still don't love the name but whatever

[59:04] It's grown on all of us. Let's see what they got here

[59:09] I

[59:16] Okay a little update everyone on Winchester the games that have shipped so far were built by

[59:23] The prototype engineers

[59:26] In the week before Houston Expo we started the training for the second production line on building the games

[59:33] It has been slow so far as we are also waiting on mass quantities of parts

[59:39] From a couple vendors who have missed their ship dates

[59:43] This week marks the point where the engineers step back

[59:50] After training the production line and the line takes over building the games

[59:56] It will be slow

[59:58] Until the end of the year as the machines are going through double and triple they

[01:00:04] Isn't the same thing they said around noon. I mean they said the same exact thing

[01:00:09] Double and triple quality control before we ship them to ensure the line has the process down correctly look

[01:00:15] I mean

[01:00:16] I'm not going to complain that they're doing quality control which is good

[01:00:19] It's not like Stern where they ship out Star Wars and you can't at the Death Star shot

[01:00:23] There is a set of machines going out the middle of next week

[01:00:28] After the Thanksgiving holiday

[01:00:31] Remember that we ship in sequence that includes internal orders and distributor orders

[01:00:35] So there is no way to tell exactly

[01:00:39] When your machine will go on the line

[01:00:42] I'd never understood this like what why why is it impossible to know when your game

[01:00:48] We know everyone is excited and we are too

[01:00:51] Thanks for your patience. We intend to ship all machines by the end of spring first of summer

[01:01:00] Okay

[01:01:02] There you go

[01:01:11] Um

[01:01:14] Let's see

[01:01:18] It plays epic a million times better than Potter

[01:01:23] Neil McRae one

[01:01:26] Neil

[01:01:28] I'm not sure if this is the Neil McRae the uh

[01:01:33] But here he is

[01:01:38] Neil the the thing is no we love you and we also don't take you seriously at all anymore

[01:01:44] I mean it's fine you know you're you're you're like a constant and

[01:01:49] We know how you're gonna feel about everything we know you don't like JJP you've never liked JJP

[01:01:57] And so you'll always

[01:01:59] Take every opportunity to

[01:02:02] Pray something as you crap on JJP

[01:02:08] Dude no one cares what you think Neil um I have

[01:02:13] You know, I have over 700 paying subscribers that care what I think

[01:02:20] Nobody would subscribe to you bro

[01:02:26] All right

[01:02:28] Neil

[01:02:56] Well

[01:02:59] Well, why are you so cranky?

[01:03:02] I mean I'm seriously curious like why you get so cranky on the internet

[01:03:07] It's also Neil that the thing that's funny about you bro, and I mean this in all sincerity

[01:04:44] Can we just block him

[01:04:46] Look at him look at look at the spam

[01:04:50] Yeah, we can do that let's do that

[01:04:52] Let's um

[01:04:57] You know, you know what I can do I can just hide him on this channel. Should we block him? Yes or no

[01:05:04] He'll just show up somewhere else like it

[01:05:06] It's so weird. He's like so nice in person and then he comes on here and and is insulting like it's just strange

[01:05:12] Like I really I really feel bad for the guy like he clearly

[01:05:18] He clearly like

[01:05:21] Just has it like he's named after an astronaut, but he's like

[01:05:27] I don't know man. He wouldn't fit inside the space suit. Here we go. He's gone

[01:05:32] All right, he's gone

[01:05:44] All right, it's fine. I don't even know if that was a real meal

[01:05:50] You know, it's fine. It's fine. It's like it's weird, but it sounded like it like that he gets very aggressive like that

[01:05:57] It's weird so strange like I will say this

[01:06:00] I don't understand like anyone who does that who like goes in

[01:06:07] To somebody else's house and then complains about being in their house

[01:06:14] It's the same way. It's the same way Emily got blocked, you know

[01:06:17] Because she was doing the same thing. It was like clearly

[01:06:21] You're disgusted by canada and it's okay like you don't have to like canada, but to show like

[01:06:25] What's weird to me would be like waking up on Saturday morning?

[01:06:30] And like hey, I'm gonna go spend 90 minutes hanging out with someone I don't like or can't stand

[01:06:40] Well, okay, so he's gone. He's gone. The Neil's gone the the fake Neil McCray might be gone

[01:06:49] Yeah, Emily changes boy remember she said that like as it is sold how many boards have you changed?

[01:06:54] You know, it's funny about that is I actually had changed a node board number eight on my Batman

[01:07:01] Also like changing a changing a board on a game. It isn't hard at all. I that was like a weird

[01:07:08] A weird indictment

[01:07:11] Especially on the newer games you you don't have to solder anything to change a board

[01:07:24] Yeah, have you ever heard Neil's podcast? It's like

[01:07:28] Hey, gonna win a twippy. I'll tell you that

[01:07:31] Again, I mean this when I say this Neil is like so nice in person when when I meet him at shows

[01:07:37] It's all fine. It's so it's like this affect the internet has on him

[01:07:43] That's the part like that turns him into something else. I'm I'm the same everywhere man and people who know me

[01:07:50] I just hung out with Mike. Jane gives what's up brother

[01:07:53] You know, there's no difference like I'm I'm not gonna

[01:07:57] Be this like internet tough guy like Neil gets and then like in real life. You're just nice

[01:08:03] Like it's just weird like I again

[01:08:08] Back to Pimble

[01:08:11] Oh, I think he's mad about the image

[01:08:14] Where's that image hold on

[01:08:18] Yeah

[01:08:20] The new stern cabinet goes together like a key

[01:08:26] Yeah, like I don't I don't I don't I don't I've got a cheap problem

[01:08:28] They've got the the perception that their stuff looks cheap is not an easy thing to overcome

[01:08:34] They've done it to themselves though

[01:08:36] That you know, they started removing foil decals from the LEDs

[01:08:41] You know like the funny part of two is like oh real real mirror translate like why'd you ever take it away in the first place

[01:08:49] You know the moment we start thinking that like a

[01:08:52] A real that real glass is expensive?

[01:08:56] I don't really care to me. I've always I've always felt a little like yeah

[01:09:02] Like I'd rather you know

[01:09:04] I've always felt there's like people haven't got creative enough with trans light areas

[01:09:09] Wait, wait, do you see the translate on raza?

[01:09:12] I think you're gonna be blown away. It's like it's got like it's got like a lighting going on that no other

[01:09:18] Translides ever done before

[01:09:26] And I think raza is gonna really um here's what I here's my um here's my take on raza

[01:09:33] It's gonna they're gonna sell all three thirty three

[01:09:36] It's definitely like a beautiful game

[01:09:39] But I do think Steve Boutin's code is gonna be a just a disaster

[01:09:43] I

[01:09:45] Look I'm saying this because I love melvin. Uh, I just think Steve Boutin

[01:09:50] Getting inside that guy's head on a game. That's about aliens crash landing on a amusement park

[01:09:59] That creates zombies that come out of the ground

[01:10:03] I mean, I feel like Steve Boutin you know is not capable nor is anybody of unraveling the insanity inside John poppy dukes head

[01:10:12] And I think the code's gonna be horrendous

[01:10:16] And it's not gonna be melvin's fault. It's just gonna be because you gotta remember like

[01:10:20] The game has been coded the game has been animated like the co like

[01:10:24] Melvin's not gonna redo all that Robert Mueller spent a fortune on it

[01:10:28] So like what you see is what you're gonna get there might be a few tweaks here and there

[01:10:31] But but melvin doesn't have like a software team

[01:10:34] redoing these games

[01:10:37] So it's just gonna be and it's gonna be another novelty game

[01:10:40] I think there's gonna be more to shoot at in this game than Alice

[01:10:44] I think it's gonna be a better game than Alice, but that's also not saying that much

[01:10:53] Is is Jamie here is Jamie in the house?

[01:10:57] Jamie what's up bro?

[01:10:58] Jamie um, I didn't text you back, but um, I will give you um

[01:11:04] I will give you the the street and time to be at Jamie. We're gonna do um

[01:11:09] I need you guys to be available at 445. I'll tell everybody this 445

[01:11:16] On the corner of 53rd and third, all right, I'm not telling you anything else just be there

[01:11:24] on the corner of 53rd and third

[01:11:28] at 445

[01:11:31] You will be underneath the lipstick building

[01:11:34] That is the building where Bernie made off

[01:11:38] Robbed all the money on the 13th floor

[01:11:47] Let's do it brother

[01:11:50] I love this time of year between the

[01:11:53] Betrida thanks giving new years

[01:11:56] Few things going on in my head one is I hope I don't get fired or our company was just acquired

[01:12:02] So um, you know that always comes with downsizing

[01:12:06] So we'll see what happens you never know

[01:12:10] Two, I just like enjoying the holidays with kids and family and I love New York City during this time of year

[01:12:18] I the city during the holidays is the best

[01:12:23] Let's let's have some fun, you know for any of you guys I would love to host you at

[01:12:29] At my bar and

[01:12:32] The plan is to get a spot here where I'm at

[01:12:36] There's all this money. There's all these people. There's no spots to go like

[01:12:40] Chill play some pins drink some beers. It's like it's it's it's bad

[01:12:44] And I've been to all the hot spots in this area and I'm telling you right now that there's a market here

[01:12:50] And someone just needs to do it. It's gonna be me man. It's gonna be me. It's gonna be Mikey

[01:12:56] It's gonna be the local and we're gonna get everybody. It's gonna be fun bar canada baby

[01:13:01] Pinball baby

[01:13:03] Every Dennis Nordman game is about Dennis

[01:13:08] Oh, man. Oh man

[01:13:13] You guys are funny man. It's a funny community

[01:13:16] You guys miss you miss Neil already

[01:13:18] Neil and uh

[01:13:20] Neil and Emily should do a podcast together and they should just call it like why canada sucks episode one

[01:13:26] He doesn't play pinball

[01:13:28] He doesn't change boards

[01:13:31] Nobody cares about his opinion even though he's one favorite pinball podcast or six years in a row

[01:13:37] And then I got you know, I got I got defeated by the weighted system

[01:13:41] I thought the twippies were coming back. Jamie are they coming back?

[01:13:46] Jamie you'd be the one to know this I thought I thought the twippies were gonna come back

[01:13:50] I've no it what happened

[01:13:53] The twippies should just be like one category favorite podcaster and everybody gets one vote

[01:14:01] And the only option should be canada we should just do it that way Jamie be really easy man

[01:14:07] We could do that award show like in in 10 minutes and the winner is

[01:14:20] Um

[01:14:22] You

[01:14:27] I'll tell you more next week

[01:14:29] Well, you're running out of time man tell us now

[01:14:36] You know, you we haven't heard a lot from Colin recently. I wonder what he's doing over there at the canadasis

[01:14:42] Does anyone here? I mean this does anyone here subscribe to the canadasis or this week in pinball like I every time

[01:14:47] I asked is like nobody nobody admits to it. Does anybody here?

[01:14:50] Subscribe to this week in pinball or the canadasis anybody

[01:14:57] Anybody

[01:15:02] I mean, I'm surprised like hiding hiding hit pieces about canada behind the paywall hasn't really worked out well for people

[01:15:11] Hmm

[01:15:13] Did he notice that trend like a month ago be like let's say how bad canada is behind the paywall

[01:15:19] He's horrible behind the paywall learn more about learn more about why this man is terrible this father of two

[01:15:27] He's terrible for pinball. He's been entertaining us for 12 years eight of which he did the show for free

[01:15:33] He's horrible for pinball

[01:15:36] I couldn't do what he does, but he's bad. He's bad stay away from his content

[01:15:40] He doesn't change boards. I don't change boards. I cure the boredom of this hobby by doing stuff every week

[01:15:49] sending out emails

[01:15:54] You know, like with people are like oh this week in pinball sold I was like for how much five bucks? How much like it?

[01:15:59] What's it worth nothing?

[01:16:01] That were anything

[01:16:03] Not worth anything

[01:16:11] You know the thing is is with with all of this

[01:16:16] If you reach a point where you can't laugh at the absurdity and in like what we're in new and how much it costs and

[01:16:25] You know as I think about our boy tux and and other people that are you know

[01:16:30] Just appreciating every day above ground, you know, it's just like

[01:16:34] the fact that

[01:16:36] so many people

[01:16:39] Spent so much time doubling down on like their anger and their feuds with canada is funny, you know and

[01:16:47] You know, I've been really happy that that don't jang is I don't really have any issues with that

[01:16:53] I don't the only one right now. I mean it's like Emily Neil Emily Neil and call it

[01:16:59] It's like get a room, you know, I don't know like and the whole thing is this is like the people that always

[01:17:06] get kind of

[01:17:09] Like blocked if you will or banned if you will

[01:17:12] They do it to themselves like they don't they you can't run you can't kick down someone's front door and tell them how horrible

[01:17:18] They are all the time like there's there's there's a there's you know who told me once there's an art to trolling was crazy

[01:17:23] Levy he's like there's an art to it you got to know

[01:17:27] When not to go too far and I think that he's right he's right takes a lot to get banned by me

[01:17:34] Any new rumors about project pimples revenues and okay, well

[01:17:39] I

[01:17:42] Haven't talked about it and I don't

[01:17:47] Yeah, I look I don't know what to tell you. I will say this ever since I

[01:17:51] was given their

[01:17:54] expenses

[01:17:57] And their numbers I never heard from them which was interesting. I mean I just they they didn't comment

[01:18:04] Um, it's clear that there is a

[01:18:08] significant amount of money being generated by project pimple

[01:18:12] And I think there is a significant gap in

[01:18:17] Where the money goes

[01:18:22] I remember when Ken Cromwell raised like $50,000 guys

[01:18:27] $50,000 and he gave it to project pimple and I remember there was like very little follow up of where that money went

[01:18:34] There was not $50,000 in machines placed in hospitals

[01:18:41] And I also know that the greatest

[01:18:46] Air cover or like defense mechanism to do anything

[01:18:55] Would be to do it behind a charity that's about

[01:18:59] Helping kids with cancer or sick children like I don't

[01:19:04] You know what I'm saying it like it just it feels like a crummy

[01:19:09] Exercise to try to

[01:19:12] You know what I'm saying like I don't

[01:19:15] It's not my

[01:19:17] I you know what I'm saying like they know what they're doing and if they're doing it all

[01:19:22] if it's all

[01:19:23] Kosher and they're not making big salaries and they're

[01:19:28] They're really using all that money for the right cause then they should sleep at night if they're taking big salaries and

[01:19:38] They you know they know what they're doing is a little bit shady and they're getting rich off of that charity then

[01:19:46] Karma will get them not canada like that's just the way I think about it

[01:19:51] I again, I just

[01:19:53] I don't I'm not an investigative investigative investigative investigative

[01:20:00] Investigative I think so

[01:20:02] Invested investigative journalist you know I'm saying like I'm not

[01:20:08] I'm not like the New York Times in the Wall Street Journal my job is not to go like try to expose corruption with charities

[01:20:16] um

[01:20:20] Well, that's the thing is like

[01:20:23] If if if they're only taking $43,000 a year in salaries

[01:20:28] And they're generating like $800,000 in expenses

[01:20:33] The numbers don't quite add up because the numbers of machines being put on location

[01:20:41] Don't like you know, I'm saying like something

[01:20:44] There's just a large chunk of money that seemingly is going somewhere and again like

[01:20:52] I don't

[01:20:54] Know like but that's what people keep

[01:20:58] You know people keep sharing and wanting me to like expose more. I don't know

[01:21:05] What good will come of it

[01:21:10] Uh, well, that's the other thing Joe is like a lot of the maintenance of these machines is volunteer

[01:21:15] People are volunteering their time so like I it's like when you have all these expenses to maintain the machines

[01:21:22] Yet all the maintenance is volunteering

[01:21:26] Where's the money go

[01:21:31] So I don't know

[01:21:39] This has been like gang this has been going on for years. I don't I don't know what to tell you I don't know what to tell you what I do know

[01:21:46] Is that

[01:21:47] The auction stuff is where I have I think the shadiness lies and I think the with the amount of money

[01:21:53] They're generating during these auctions to me is where the shadiness lies because those those auction amounts are significant

[01:22:01] revenue coming in

[01:22:03] and like

[01:22:06] Okay, so like what happens when you generate

[01:22:11] You know

[01:22:12] 80,000 dollars off of beetle juice alone or something, you know, you're doubling up on five six games and you're selling them for 24,000

[01:22:22] What where's that money go

[01:22:25] but yeah

[01:22:34] Raffles are shady in general

[01:22:43] I don't know

[01:22:50] But anyway, it is what it is like I

[01:22:55] You know, I don't know I it I would hate further to be any

[01:23:00] Anything fishy going on over there

[01:23:03] But it's I if everything is public

[01:23:07] Then there should be an ability to kind of clearly map

[01:23:11] A road to everything

[01:23:19] So

[01:23:29] Mm-hmm

[01:23:32] Yeah, we can move on what do you guys want to talk about we're almost we're almost at time

[01:23:40] You

[01:23:42] What do you guys want to talk about you guys brought it up I didn't bring it up

[01:23:53] What do you guys want to talk about we got in the next like five minutes you tell me

[01:23:58] Anyone by a predator

[01:24:01] Who's a good district for Dutch I think Dutch only has two districts

[01:24:11] Um

[01:24:15] Do you did you see loser kids top five of 2025 one dude gave evil dead and honorable mention and the other didn't even mention evil dead credibility lost

[01:24:30] Um, I didn't see it um

[01:24:36] That's kind of that's kind of nuts

[01:24:39] I I don't know like were there even if you do top five of 2025 had is um I

[01:24:45] Don't even like what Harry Potter. I would say the top

[01:24:49] Two games of the year probably been like Potter and

[01:24:53] front just I mean isn't evil dead like even on the

[01:24:57] It's like

[01:24:58] The pin-side top 100 list is it's it's high

[01:25:03] They put portal on the list. That's it. That's a joke

[01:25:06] Yeah, I mean

[01:25:08] I I

[01:25:09] I feel like not even

[01:25:12] I haven't even mentioned multi-morphic

[01:25:14] In any shows and months. I don't I don't even know like have have the portal machines even gone out I

[01:25:22] I just can't

[01:25:24] Still can't get my head around

[01:25:26] The fact that some of the greatest engineering is happening at a company that if they just made normal machines

[01:25:31] They'd be so much more successful. I don't understand

[01:25:36] Why Jerry just continues. He doesn't even want it like just try it Jerry just try making a normal game

[01:25:45] He won't do it

[01:25:47] He you know he has to like reverse engineer everything to make it work and it's just

[01:25:52] I don't know it's it's

[01:25:55] It is what it is like he knows it everybody had his Thanksgiving table knows it

[01:26:01] Jerry could have been so successful

[01:26:05] Like I've never met a dude that like dude you should be a millionaire you you could have been a pinball millionaire

[01:26:12] Instead you know

[01:26:16] After a decade. I don't even think they've sold I

[01:26:20] Don't even think they've sold a thousand machines in total. I think it's maybe around half that

[01:26:29] Well, you know you

[01:26:32] You know Jerry's whole thing is and and it's the biggest mistake people make in any any industry

[01:26:41] Especially a creative industry

[01:26:44] Is his product

[01:26:47] Is a solution in search of a problem

[01:26:51] Okay, so when you when you go down a road of we're gonna we're gonna do this because this whole modular

[01:26:57] It's all meant for people that live in like one bedroom studio apartments like nobody who has a house

[01:27:03] See like I'm I'm the perfect example of like someone who should

[01:27:08] Should want a

[01:27:10] Multimorphic I don't have a lot of room

[01:27:12] I could have as he puts it 28 games if I bought his platform

[01:27:17] But then you think about the

[01:27:19] Reality of it like where do you store all these modular pieces

[01:27:25] and

[01:27:26] The modular kit now for portal is the same price as a full game

[01:27:32] It's like five thousand dollars for the kit

[01:27:37] So then it then all of a sudden even just the financial

[01:27:42] Like value proposition is gone

[01:27:46] And what Jerry needed to do years ago is just get get a user-based big enough to justify what I think is still the best thing

[01:27:54] Has going in his game which is connected play

[01:27:59] I mean connected play has always been Jerry's biggest

[01:28:03] Most fun element whenever I would play the games at the shows and the games were connected and the the colored blocks are

[01:28:11] Lighting up and you're competing against someone out. It was fun

[01:28:15] You

[01:28:21] Chris Turner will sit there and hear you out

[01:28:26] Yeah, well look Chris is a good guy Chris is Chris Chris does not need

[01:28:31] From what I've heard Chris does not need this pinball thing to put food on the table

[01:28:37] Let's just say that

[01:28:40] I think he comes from a very successful

[01:28:43] Family

[01:28:44] Lives in a compound I heard

[01:28:48] And he's such a nice guy now the Chris is only issues. He needs a he needs a partner that

[01:28:55] gets it

[01:28:57] That's it

[01:29:00] I look you know what I love Chris is engineering the problem with with Chris is like beautifully clean under the playfield

[01:29:08] It just it's hard to lift the hood on that

[01:29:12] And and then like and then spend a lot of money on it because it does feel like I got oh man

[01:29:19] I could have put this together in my garage that clean it's beautiful

[01:29:23] So he's like in a way like over engineered pinball that looks so easy to manufacture

[01:29:31] Uh

[01:29:33] It's hard though to charge like eight to nine thousand for that

[01:29:37] Yeah, no, I mean look this is the this is the double edged sword right it's like okay. I'll use a cargument

[01:29:46] In an electric car is an innovation

[01:29:50] Right like you can make the car cleaner. There's no gas. There's no oil. There's no pistons

[01:29:57] There's so much less happening in an electric car

[01:30:00] But it's hard to charge

[01:30:04] A hundred to two hundred thousand dollars for an electric car

[01:30:07] Because it doesn't have the V8 engine doesn't have the turbo it doesn't have

[01:30:13] All the things that we value

[01:30:16] You know that we place value on so that's like when you take an elect and that's why electric cars tank in value because nobody wants

[01:30:25] Nobody values them you pull up to a car show in a quiet EV and like nobody cares

[01:30:30] So

[01:30:32] So um that's where it's at

[01:31:03] Thank you so much for subscribing to canada's pinball podcast the month is ending on Sunday

[01:31:10] I know that

[01:31:12] Re-subscribing sometimes people are on the fence. We always lose a few every month then they come back

[01:31:17] But I really do appreciate it in a world where inflation is crazy

[01:31:22] I am never raising the price of entry for canada's pinball podcast

[01:31:26] I bet I can make more if I made the minimum ten I

[01:31:29] I might because the thing if I made the minimum ten I might lose a hundred people

[01:31:32] But other everyone else might stay I don't want to do that

[01:31:36] I think I'm giving you the value more value than you're even paying for

[01:31:40] And I so I really do appreciate it. I really do appreciate you guys sticking around

[01:31:44] And I think for those people out there that say nobody cares nobody care they do care

[01:31:48] I think people do care. I think people would miss canada's pinball podcast if it went away every week

[01:31:53] I think they would miss it if we stopped doing these shows
