[00:00] Be seated please. Kevin Coolick, James number 16-210-3-0.

[00:13] I think that's going to be the sound of the prison door slamming shut on Kevin Coolick.

[00:18] I think we're getting close. On this episode, number 79 of Canada's Pimbal podcast, we are going to

[00:26] let you guys listen to all the juicy parts of Kevin's Day in court. Now, for those of you who don't know,

[00:34] a soundcloud link went up a few days ago that let us hear Kevin talk into the judge,

[00:41] talk into Keith Nathanson, the lawyer who's representing all the people who got burned,

[00:45] and it's just incredible. This is a moment that so many of you have waited years for that justice

[00:52] would one day come to Kevin Coolick's door. A man who has not complied with the requests of

[00:59] the lawyers, a man who has gone against his word. And I want to remind people what Kevin said

[01:05] years ago about how he was going to handle people who put money into his project. Now, this is from

[01:12] this is from March 23rd of 2015. All right. So this is almost two years ago to this date. Kevin said,

[01:21] he basically said, you know, the project stopped. He can't continue. This is when everyone realized

[01:26] he didn't have the license for predator and there was no way forward. He wrote to people.

[01:31] Okay. Your investments are safe. And the return, he said, the refund process is expected to be

[01:38] swift and completed very soon. You all will start to see those balances reflecting in your accounts

[01:44] in a few short days. Okay. A few short days. That was two years ago. This man has proven to be a liar.

[01:53] He's proven to be deceptive. And now he's proven to be non-compliant. But his time is running out.

[02:02] And it is a glorious moment when we finally get to squeeze the news around this, this, this weasel.

[02:08] He's just a total weasel. And then he writes again to the many of you who have continued to support

[02:15] us and prefer to receive your game. I'm sorry to say that this is the end of the road. And you too

[02:21] will be receiving a refund instead of a machine. Okay. Two years ago, he said that. So what happened?

[02:31] Two years have gone by and a whole lot of nothing has seemed to have happened, right? But that's not

[02:36] true. This lawyer Keith has been pursuing this. He's been collecting information. And while many of us

[02:44] have given up on this, even myself was like, you know what? I don't think anything's ever going to

[02:49] happen. That's not the case now. Kevin has been dragged into the courtroom by the US marshals and

[02:56] has to face the music now. And let's start the first segment just by how this, the whole courtroom

[03:03] thing begins. I want to I want to play this. And then I'll come back in a little bit and we'll

[03:08] talk about what we hear. But let's start with how it begins. Good morning. Sure. You Kevin Kuhlick.

[03:15] Yes, I am. Good morning, Sharon. Who's on the phone, please? Good morning, Your Honor. Keith Nathan

[03:20] from Special Litigation Council, Randall Frank, trust me. I'm a cop. Good morning, Mr. Nathan.

[03:26] First off, I'd like to thank the US marshals service for again, that doing an outstanding job of

[03:32] bringing someone in the court doesn't happen very often, but we appreciate all your efforts when it

[03:37] is occurred. Mr. Kuhlick, you know why you're here today? I understand you're seeking

[03:41] explanation for me. I'm that's a start. So do you know why you're here today? That's specifically

[03:49] no. Okay. Did you know that you were supposed to appear at a office to undergo questioning by Mr.

[03:56] Nathan? Did you know that? Yes, I did. Did you know that you're supposed to bring a number of

[04:00] documents with you for that meeting? Yes, I did. Did you do any of those two things?

[04:06] I did not go to the meeting. Did you bring all the documents? Did you request it?

[04:12] Most of the majority of the documents were sent to Mr. Nathan's in an email form.

[04:17] I see. And you know you're supposed to do that twice. Is that correct? Yes. And you didn't appear

[04:23] either time to be deposed, did you? No, Your Honor, I did not. Was there a reason why you didn't do

[04:28] that, sir? Yes. What was the reason? The first time was because it was the first day of a new job.

[04:34] Okay. And the second time I felt very threatened by Mr. Nathan's in. Why did you feel threatened by Mr.

[04:43] Nathan's in? In a talk with my attorney, he had specifically told him to tell, quote, his client

[04:54] to make sure not to bring his firearm. And I had never once mentioned a firearm ever.

[05:02] You have a firearm? I do. What kind of firearm do you have? I have a Ruger P89 special. Is that all you have?

[05:08] Yes. Why would that issue come up at all? I have no idea. That's why I was scared. I see.

[05:13] Would your attorney going to be with you at this deposition, sir? I believe so. Okay. So why would you fear

[05:18] if your attorney was there? Because there's an internet hysteria and slander campaign against me.

[05:25] I've had multiple threats. I see. So do you carry your firearm with you at all times? I never do. I see.

[05:33] I don't have the, I don't have a permit to carry. So you keep it at home. I do.

[05:40] I mean, we have to stop there first of all because we're going to count the amount of times

[05:44] the sky lies. But let's stop and talk about the fact that Kevin says he didn't show up because he

[05:50] felt threatened by Mr. Nathanson. And what a joke that excuses that he felt threatened. And then

[05:58] he goes on to say why he what why he felt threatened was because he was told not to bring his gun.

[06:04] Does that make any sense to anyone? So don't bring your gun to our deposition, Kevin. And Kevin

[06:13] claims that's threatening to him. It wasn't like Mr. Nathanson said, I've got my gun in case you

[06:20] try anything funny. No, it was all about Kevin leave your gun home. And Kevin goes on to say in this

[06:25] part that that he never mentioned having a gun, which is a flat out lie as we'll see later on that

[06:31] he actually did mention that was one of the things that he owned. So it's just comical that he skipped

[06:38] out on both of his depositions. One because he says he got a new job. I don't know who would hire

[06:43] this loser. And secondarily that he felt threatened. And it just listened throughout this entire

[06:49] courtroom sort of recording at Mr. Nathanson. There is nothing about this gentleman that seems

[06:55] threatening. Even when he seems really frustrated, this is a very calm man. Kevin is such a

[07:02] weasel to say that he felt threatened. And that's why he skipped out. But let's keep rolling the tape.

[07:07] There are 37 different categories. That's a lot of documents. And then you didn't appear.

[07:16] So then Mr. Nathanson asked for a motion to make you appear. I signed that order. And then you

[07:22] didn't appear again. And then I signed an order directing the marshals to apprehend you and bring

[07:27] you here, which is why you're here today. You understand all that, sir? I do. Is there a reason why

[07:32] you didn't have your attorney file some paper with this court saying you feared for your safety

[07:37] or that you want to have the deposition taken at a different place, sir? All I said was I feared

[07:43] for my safety. I would love to have the deposition taken at another location. I don't want to give the

[07:48] example or the appearance that I'm trying to be on the cooperative. Well, it's very difficult for me

[07:54] to see that right now, sir. So I understand that. I'm saying this to say whatever you want me to do,

[08:00] I'm more than happy to be cooperative. I just want to feel as much as anyone else.

[08:05] I want to stop there because I think what's important is how Kevin positions himself throughout

[08:11] this entire recording is he puts himself as the victim. Isn't that just an amazing quality

[08:18] of a pathological liar like this? Is he tries to pain himself as being victimized that he's so

[08:26] willing to cooperate that he just wants us to be over with? Right? He just wants it to be done.

[08:32] And we've seen nothing from this man over the last two years that shows he wants to cooperate.

[08:36] And Kevin, no, you don't get to just turn the page. You don't get to take hundreds of thousands

[08:43] of dollars for people and then just go on with your life. But let's keep rolling the tape because it

[08:49] gets even better. Any thoughts, sir? Anything you want to share with the court at this time?

[08:53] I would, Your Honor. Thank you. First of all, I just would like the courts to know that Mr. Kula,

[08:59] although not disclosed as an asset in his bankruptcy petition, testified in his second 341

[09:06] meeting of creditors that he owned the Ruger firearm. And my comment to his counsel was advised Mr. Kula

[09:15] not to bring his firearm to my office. That was the only comment that I made. Obviously,

[09:20] I'm concerned with a recalcitrant debtor who really in the entire history of this case is not

[09:28] complied with anything. And then all of the sudden discloses he has a firearm that that's

[09:34] concerning. It's concerning for me, my office staff, my landlord, which is actually another law firm

[09:41] in this building. And I just wanted to be clear that a firearm would not be welcomed in this building.

[09:46] There were never any direct to get Mr. Kula. There's no one in this office who has any

[09:53] pecuniary interest, who never attempted to purchase a pinball machine for Mr. Kula or gave him

[09:59] any money or anything else. So, if I'm any internet hysteria or anybody else, I'm unaware

[10:06] of anyone, even in the vicinity of my office, who would have any notice that the 341 or the

[10:13] 2.04 V exams rather were taking place. I just want to stop there and say that I love Keith. This

[10:21] lawyer is amazing. The way he articulates all of Kevin's lies and his deceptions is incredible.

[10:29] And in just there, like, there's Kevin's lie number one that he never mentioned he had a gun,

[10:34] he did. And the fact that Keith has to explain that they never threaten this man is just it just

[10:40] shows when an idiot Kevin really is. But let's go back because the next part is great. This is where

[10:47] Keith explains the lack of documentation that Kevin gave, but also goes into the things that Kevin

[10:55] has been buying, buying with people's money, even though he claims to be insolvent. And I want to

[11:02] say that everyone on Pinside who's been sharing information should be applauded because it's been

[11:08] those videos people have grabbed and those comments and those the constant searching for what Kevin's

[11:13] doing has enabled Keith to point out that this man's a liar and he has been spending money and

[11:20] transferring money to family members. So let's keep going with the tape.

[11:24] Also, I'll just indicate to the court that the only document that I received from Mr. Kool-X

[11:30] Council were to just some bank printouts and just sort of courts aware Mr. Kool-X received at

[11:38] least as far as the trustee believes it's north of about a million dollars from investors for a

[11:44] pinball machine that he was never authorized to build. In Mr. Kool-X petition, he's listed about

[11:51] 500 thousand dollars. He has never explained to the trustee or provided any documentation to show

[12:00] dissipation of that money. Obviously, the trustee is very interested to know where the million

[12:06] two went. Number one, the trustee is very concerned because number one, about 20 days before filing

[12:15] Mr. Kool-X, although claiming he's insolvent, managed to purchase a 32 foot RV for his mother,

[12:23] even as late as this December, purchased a series of laptops for his five children,

[12:30] but comes before this court and claims to be insolvent. Most of the documents in that list have

[12:36] not been provided. Mr. Kool-X has not provided any business records. There have been payments that

[12:42] have been made. We've asked for copies of checks from a business account because there have been

[12:46] transfers to his friends and relatives and people who he claim are his employees, but has yet to

[12:52] produce any employment records, no W2, no 1099, no information whatsoever. The trustee is

[13:02] essentially his hand size because we can't do anything without debt or compliance. His counsel

[13:09] stipulated to the original $2.04 V on November 2nd. Mr. Kool-X simply didn't appear, although

[13:17] his counsel appeared. The court entered the order compelling. Mr. Kool-X to appear on December 16.

[13:26] Mr. Kool-X did not appear, although his counsel appeared. Other than the printout from the bank

[13:32] accounts, those of the only records we've received, Mr. Kool-X additionally transferred money

[13:38] to his wife to purchase a house in Solwean Herning, which were assets to render himself in

[13:45] cells as well. We have an ongoing history now, judge, of months of noncompliant by the

[13:52] Stetter. He hasn't paid any of the cost or sanctioned pursuance to the court's order of December 12th.

[14:01] Frankly, he's done nothing.

[14:02] Any talk to Mr. Higens about the documents that he has?

[14:08] He indicated he sent to me everything that Mr. Kool-X has provided, which is essentially nothing,

[14:15] and essentially it's just a jumbled set of printouts from bank statements, which don't explain

[14:23] anything, don't provide the trustee with any information about Mr. Kool-X business operations.

[14:29] At my last calculation, I've accounted for approximately $200,000 of the $1.2 million,

[14:43] we are, as I've indicated, to the court. The trustee has spent, though. I can't do an investigation.

[14:49] The trustee can't do an investigation. We can't properly, the trustee can't properly administer

[14:56] this case, because Mr. Kool-X, which is recalcitrant in flippant attitude, just refuses to comply.

[15:04] I want to stop there and talk about how much total money do we think Kevin O's? I know that Keith

[15:11] said over $1 million, the number that's been floating around is $1.2 million. Now, I've just been

[15:18] trying to do some of the math. $1.2 million is basically 250 predators at the price that Kevin

[15:27] set as the final price, which I believe was $4,750. Remember, it's crazy right to think about

[15:36] Fimo Machines even being below $5,000. But at the time, it was a bargain, and that's why so many

[15:41] people went in. That's around $1.2 million. Now, I don't know if everyone paid in fall, though. I

[15:47] can't imagine that. If people, the way he did is deposit, there was like a half deposit sort of stage.

[15:54] So the number could be anywhere between $400,000 and $1.2 million. I don't know for sure. I don't

[16:03] think it's $1.2 million. So Kevin will hide behind that. He will say, it's nowhere near that. He'll

[16:08] queues Keith of lying. But it's in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. It has to be at least $1.5 million

[16:15] plus. But the next part of this recording is great because we start to, the judge basically asks Keith,

[16:22] what do you want? And when he suggests is what we all want. And that's for Kevin to be locked up.

[16:28] But let's roll the tape. About how many pages do you think you received, Mr. Nathanson?

[16:33] And I want you to give me an extra non-exact number. But are we talking about 50,

[16:37] $100,000? What do you think it is? I think I was provided in the neighborhood of about 50

[16:43] pages. But all it was was obviously Mr. Kuwak went online to his credit union account and just

[16:50] printed out the statement and sent the statement over, which is a far cry from what the trustee

[16:58] has asked for and the trustee needs. Well, I suppose it would be a start on number one, which is all

[17:04] bank accounts for Kevin Toulick or and or a skip the pinball. Well, partially, you're on it because

[17:13] there is also a joint account you had with his wife where there were numerous transfers. None of

[17:18] the records for that account were provided to the trustee. Did you get any checks from a wildfire

[17:25] creating in with getting this get the pinball account? None, none, yada. Any tax returns for Mr.

[17:33] Kuwak or skip the pinball for 2011 through 2015? I believe that debt are provided a few of the

[17:41] returns to the trustee. We certainly don't have this complete returns that are indicated at a

[17:46] second 341 that he was filing returns and would provide them to us. So we have a partial of

[17:53] his tax return. You want to ask me? I'm not done with Mr. Nathanson yet. Mr. Nathanson, what do you want

[18:01] me to do? Well, Your Honor, I understand the court's quandary that certainly, confining Mr. Kuwak to

[18:11] prison, doesn't get the trustee the record. I'm not sure if Mr. Nathanson. I have no problem with that.

[18:18] I mean, I would ask based on the debtors just continued noncompliance from day one that the court

[18:26] ordered him to combine for at least some period of time, whatever the court feels reasonable. I

[18:31] would suggest not less than 14 days and probably 30 days would be more appropriate. And then upon

[18:37] release, the debtor be held to a very, very short leash. I'm providing every one of the documents

[18:44] requested by the trustee paying all the costs and sanctions as ordered by the court in the

[18:51] December 12 order. And if not, then the court immediately issue another order that Mr. Kuwak

[18:59] be apprehended. And perhaps the next time around, he be held and confined until such time as he

[19:06] fully complies. I think it was Nathanson and I come back to you in a couple minutes to kill again.

[19:11] I did hold you off for a minute too because I want to hear Mr. Nathanson complete the

[19:15] going answer. You might want to be sitting down for this part of the broadcast because it is

[19:22] nauseating, listening to Kevin give these excuses and basically deny all these claims. But,

[19:29] you know, here goes the blire himself. The numerous claims that Mr. Nathanson is making are false

[19:37] at best and lies at worst. I don't know where this $1.2 million number is coming from. It's

[19:43] completely made up. He has my entire banking records from my business account from the day it was

[19:50] open to the day it closed. There's not that much. As far as cooperation in the documents provided,

[20:00] the majority of the documents he's asking for in this case are also documents he asked for in

[20:05] the previous case in which he was imposing counsel to civil lawsuits against me and my family.

[20:12] He has the majority of those things. If not from this time he asked from the last two times they

[20:18] were provided. I'm absolutely not trying to be uncooperative. I want this to be over with. I would

[20:28] like to do whatever you would ask of me. Do you realize that I can as Mr. Nathanson

[20:36] suggested to have you kept and custody of the US Marshals for a period of time? Do you understand that?

[20:41] I do now, sir. Yes. We just figured it out in the last couple of hours Mr.

[20:47] or two. I just figured out right now. Tell me about your personal situation. If I am

[20:53] put you in custody in Marshals for a period of time, would that cause a hardship upon your family?

[20:58] If you have one. Most definitely. Oh, so I'm from school and my daughter and I watched my children

[21:04] on my wife's working. Okay. So who's watching the children right now? I have a friend over.

[21:10] Let's watch him. How many children do you have, sir? Three that live with me. Okay. In their ages?

[21:17] 10, 8 and 6. I'm not asking names. Just want to know the general ages. I see.

[21:23] In your wife is employed outside the house? Yes. She has a photography studio in San

[21:29] Commissioner. Well, how do you respond to Mr. Nathanson saying he's got about 50 pages when

[21:35] Quenckley sir, I look at all these papers that should have been supplied and it's got to be

[21:43] more than 50 pages. It's got more like 500 to 1000. I'm going to assume that the 50 pages Mr.

[21:48] Nathanson's reference has probably the bank records. Sounds like it. Other than that, he has

[21:57] a multitude of documents in this case. As far as being represented to him, I would have to turn

[22:05] to my attorney to see if he resubmitted them or not. But I assure you that Mr. Nathanson has the

[22:13] majority of those documents. Your Honor. Mr. Nathanson, is that true that you've got some of these

[22:17] documents from the previous elocid? I have some documents from a previous from that there were some

[22:24] civil proofs filed, Your Honor. However, none of the documents are responsive to the majority

[22:32] of the paragraphs. What I was given in the civil lawsuit was a box of jungle papers, some that had

[22:40] HTML website code on them, which I mean really meant nothing to me and still doesn't to this day.

[22:48] Certainly none of the financial records that we've requested for Mr. Kool-X business. None of

[22:55] the documents to show how much he was paid for people when he was paid. Nothing, certainly not the

[23:02] check copies from the account. Certainly no payroll records, no indication, no profit loss, no general

[23:13] ledgers, no accounting for any inventory, which Mr. Kool-X purchased, which the truck

[23:20] is currently trying to investigate because mysteriously all of Mr. Kool-X inventory in his business

[23:28] disappeared and he's the only one to know where it went. And he just absolutely failed to produce

[23:36] any evidence regarding that. I mean I could go through the entire list of 37 items and I can

[23:44] assure the court that the lion's share, the majority, Mr. Kool-X has provided nothing, absolutely

[23:52] nothing to the trustee and certainly not in the civil lawsuit either. I will tell the court

[24:01] that during the civil lawsuit the entire position of Mr. Kool-X and the other defendants was just

[24:07] subterfuge and smoke and mirrors to not provide any meaningful discovery whatsoever.

[24:15] I mean it's almost hard to hear Kevin say, I'll do whatever you ask of me. I would like to be

[24:22] cooperative. He has done anything but do that. I mean his judge must be thinking this guy is an idiot.

[24:30] He's a total moron. It's just sad that he's got children, that he's got a wife, that he's

[24:35] dragging these people down with him. And now he's acting as if he's a good guy. He's going to help,

[24:44] he's going to help get everything that's needed to be gotten and he hasn't done any of it.

[24:49] There's nothing he's done. I love how Keith is just like he's giving me garbage, absolute garbage.

[24:56] Now the next part is absolutely hilarious because they start to talk about the actual

[25:00] assets of Kevin and the pinball machine process. And this word for toys that they use,

[25:08] a kuchamins, a kuchamins is going to go down as a meme in the history of pinball and especially

[25:15] with this case. But let me play this part for you guys. What kind of inventory would Mr. Kool-X?

[25:21] He was producing 250 pinball machines. So he had a number of cabinets,

[25:28] plate fields for the pinball machines, the electronics that went into the pinball machines.

[25:34] He took the delivery of 250 in the pinball world they're known as toys. So it's all the kuchamins

[25:43] that are placed on the pinball machine. He paid for and received all those, those that disappeared,

[25:51] Mr. Kool-X additionally. It's the trustees believe that he's run or has run or it's continuing to run

[26:00] what's known in the industry as a route where he places pinball machines and bending machines

[26:05] and coin out machines and then collects the money from them. Mr. Kool-X disclosed none of that.

[26:13] I actually have photos, recent photos of Mr. Kool-X allowing his children to play on two or

[26:21] three of those machines which were undisclosed. I've not asked for those assets. He hasn't provided

[26:27] an explanation for those recent photos. And the list your honor is just those on and on and on

[26:33] of what Mr. Kool-X has not produced. And Mr. Kool-X only produces information or acknowledges

[26:41] assets when the trustee locates them by means other than the cooperation of the debtor. And that's

[26:48] the problem we've had with this case from day one with Mr. Kool-X.

[26:53] Excuse me, how do you respond to what Mr. Kool-X has just told me about all these things?

[26:58] Well, it's kind of at the core of Mr. Nathanson's approach to this case is generally attacking me

[27:07] based on hearsay. I don't know where these rumors of a route come from, but he's already provided

[27:15] false evidence at the 341 meeting trying to show that. I'm not running around. I have very little

[27:23] in the way of inventory and I've spoken with Mr. Frank at the last 341 meeting about these things

[27:31] will appear on my adjusted schedules. As far as him not having a copy of money paid in and people

[27:40] I owe money to that's that's a flat out lie. He's been provided with Excel documents that show names

[27:48] names and addresses of every single person who was involved in my project with the amounts that

[27:55] they had paid in. And again, that was provided multiple times. The fact that he would state to you

[28:01] that I've provided him absolutely nothing appears malicious and intent to me.

[28:06] I'm looking at the papers you filed with the court and I get to the part where I see

[28:13] your disclosure of assets and I've got a total of $3,700 in assets. That's not about right?

[28:24] It does. So these items that Mr. Nase has been talking about, do they own by you or do they own by

[28:32] your corporation? I don't know what items he's talking about. Specifically there were some

[28:39] there were some pinball adornments that he had mentioned. I believe he called me accruterments.

[28:45] Those things I do have and this is part of having to readjust my schedules. Those parts aren't

[28:52] worth anything. And when I was filling out the schedules initially, I assume that if it's not

[28:59] worth anything, it shouldn't have to be listed. I've since been informed that even if I see it

[29:04] and the community sees it as zero value, it still should be listed. These are things I need to

[29:08] update my schedules. Well, at least get to the final June of last year. How much time you need to

[29:14] do that, sir? Well, I was going to have an accountant help me out with the business end of

[29:20] the numbers end of the closing out the business stuff, but I haven't been able to afford one.

[29:30] I believe the term is insolvent. I most certainly am broke for whatever term it is.

[29:36] There's I'm not hiding anything. I don't have money stored or hidden anywhere. There's certainly

[29:42] not a discrepancy of six or seven hundred thousand dollars. Your honor, I filed bankruptcy because I am

[29:49] completely dusted to. And Mr. Nathanson's previous attempts to collect from me through civil court

[29:56] have absolutely destroyed me financially and his continued internet presence to not only allow,

[30:04] but facilitate my harassment has essentially destroyed every aspect of my life that I've worked

[30:11] up to this point for. The claims that he's making are very, very strong, but very baseless.

[30:20] And this is not the place to be pitching an argument or a case. I'm here to talk to you about

[30:26] my willingness to cooperate. Right. And I believe that's paramount. I'm here to tell you that I'm

[30:33] going to cooperate and I'll do whatever you say I need to do to get through this amicably.

[30:39] No rumors or personal attacks aside. Uh, for Mr. Nathanson, I believe that there's a due course here

[30:45] and I want to follow it. Fuck you, Kevin. Cool. Like you don't get it, man. You're blaming Keith

[30:52] for leading an internet smear campaign against you that has has ruined your life and all that

[30:58] you've worked for. I mean, this, this is the part that gets my blood boiling because this guy

[31:03] doesn't get it. What ruined your life, Kevin Kool-Ack is that you lied. You took money from people

[31:11] to make a machine that you didn't have permission to make and then you didn't give people,

[31:15] you didn't give people their money back. That's what ruined your life. Not what Keith is doing,

[31:21] not what the owners of Predator Pimble machines are doing. You did it. And what did you work up to?

[31:28] What what what what big empire did this this charlatan this liar ever create? Uh, and I love how

[31:37] he he's he says I've got like $3,000 in net worth. Like that's all he has in the world and

[31:44] hit your hand in your kids laptop computers. If all if all I had in the world was $3,000,

[31:50] bucks, how are you going to give each of your kids a laptop? None of it adds up and the fact that

[31:56] he can't take responsibility for his actions and is like shocked that people are going online

[32:02] and calling him all sorts of names is beyond me is beyond me and it just really oh all right let's

[32:08] let's let's keep rolling tape. What about Mr. Nathan's comments on the 30 foot RV for your

[32:15] mother and the five laptops? Again baseless hearsay. My children did get laptops for Christmas.

[32:22] Uh, my mother does own a trailer. It has nothing to do with me. I'm sure this is more things that

[32:29] were posted to the internet in which Mr. Nathan's in frequency to not only gather information but to

[32:35] also share it. How long do you think you're going to need with Mr. Kulek if you have the documents

[32:41] that you're looking for? Probably, I would say probably four hours. Mr. Kulek, what's your

[32:50] schedule that look like on Thursday or Friday next week? That's a 26 or 27. The only day that I

[32:57] would ask to not have anything happen is the 26th. I have another court hearing in Henry County, Ohio

[33:02] that day. Where's Henry County? Napoleon, Ohio. It's like, sorry, still helping me a lot.

[33:07] Fifth middle of nowhere. I'm going to go to Toledo and go south for another hour.

[33:12] So the 26th, which is a Thursday is bad for you? Bad for me. Any other day is fine.

[33:17] Next question. Do you have a passport? No, I don't. Why so? I asked the court to inquire with

[33:23] and Mr. Kulek also has an enhanced driver's license, which would be functionally equivalent of a

[33:28] passport. Your Honor. Fair question. You understand what that concept is that I do. And no, I don't.

[33:34] He says he does not, Mr. Nathan. All right. Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Nathan,

[33:39] anything more that you want to put on the record this time?

[33:44] Really, Your Honor, that the trustee is at his wit's end. We've just got no compliance now for

[33:51] seven months from Mr. Kulek. And it's all my after this court order can apprehend it that Mr. Kulek

[33:57] has any interest in this bankruptcy case. It has caused the trustee and my office on behalf of

[34:06] the trustee and inordinate them out of time only to be met with not compliant. So I mean, I just

[34:12] don't think it's the court to tolerate that. I love that the judge asks if Kevin has a passport

[34:19] and he doesn't really know. Who doesn't know if they have a passport or not? But you have to wonder,

[34:25] it's an interesting question. Do we think Kevin is a flight risk for this for for for all these

[34:31] accusations, right? He he we know he doesn't have an answer. He knows he doesn't have an answer.

[34:35] He's got kids. He's got a wife. So I would doubt that he's going to run, but he's on a real short

[34:41] leash. And he knows though that time is running out. And we're going to we're going to find this out

[34:47] in a matter of weeks, whether or not Kevin shows up again or he disappears. But it's just it's

[34:53] interesting to see what he does. But let's keep rolling the tape. This is what the court will do.

[34:58] Mr. Kulek, one give me an effort to make so I can understand better what's going on here.

[35:06] I'm not completely satisfied with what you've complied with the orders of the court. I can

[35:10] pretty sure you haven't you have however give me some reason to believe that you will.

[35:17] So this is what I'm going to do. First off, I want you to realize that all I could do is just

[35:22] direct me to us marshals to take you and incarcerate you for as long as I feel like I can tell I know

[35:27] that you're going to comply. Understand that sir? I do understand that. I can also find you and I think

[35:32] that is an issue here that I'll address later on. But frankly what I think the cost for the trustee

[35:38] wants is to get the information that he is asked for and it doesn't do anyone a lot of good

[35:45] to put you in jail or to find you when you can't pay the fine way to wait when what is really

[35:51] the goal here is to get this information. Mr. Kulek, I'm going to do the file. The first off

[35:59] again after thanking the marshals for giving you here today. I hope that I don't really have to

[36:04] do that again to get you here because if I do you're not going to be worrying about whether you're

[36:10] going to go home or not. You're going to stay and custody the marshes for a long time. You understand

[36:16] that sir? I do understand that. I'd also like to add that the marshall and his team that came to my

[36:21] home today, treated with utmost respect and dignity and I just want that to be on the record.

[36:25] Well thank you. So you've got that going for you as well. Thank you again for the marshals

[36:29] on that front. Sir, what I'm going to do is number one. I want you to listen carefully.

[36:35] You're to stay in the United States of America. I'm going to let you go to Ohio because very

[36:40] of a course hearing that day on Thursday. Thank you so much. But no further than Ohio.

[36:45] Clearly not in Canada, not anywhere else. I'm taking what you're worried. Do not have a passport.

[36:51] If I find out that you didn't leave the country between now and then,

[36:55] may God have mercy on your soul, sir. No more stand there. No worries.

[36:59] I'm sure. Yes. You sure? Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Okay. Second, you're not to dispose of anything

[37:07] other than just to buy groceries or something like that between now and whenever I see you again.

[37:14] Because we can't have anything more going outside. If there is going anything going,

[37:18] and if it isn't, then it shouldn't be a problem there.

[37:22] Three, I want you to contact your attorney as soon as possible to find out

[37:26] exactly where these documents are. Because you're counting. We gave your attorney all these documents.

[37:33] Mr. Nathanson says that he hasn't got them. And there's a disconnect here somewhere.

[37:40] And whatever I want to have those documents and Mr. Nathanson's hands,

[37:44] by Thursday next week, that's the 26th. Same thing as supposed to be alright.

[37:53] I'm going to work with you or turn it on that. I mean, if something didn't get sent or something missed,

[37:58] you have to get those documents to Mr. Nathanson. Next, I'm going to require that you be here

[38:06] Friday morning, the 27th. And Mr. Nathanson, I want you to make arrangements to have a court

[38:12] reported here. And you can start asking Mr. Koolie, all the questions you want. We have a

[38:18] comprehensive that can be used. That way, Mr. Koolie, you won't feel intimidated by

[38:25] anyone for your safety. Thank you. Because you can't get in here with a gun or anything. That's

[38:30] one of the things that our security officers doing a great job. So you don't need to worry about

[38:36] that. And neither does Mr. Nathanson. Thank you. And I'm going to ask that examination start at 9 o'clock.

[38:44] I'm here that day. And that's one of the reasons I picked that day. Because if there's a problem,

[38:49] you and I get to talk again. And likewise, Mr. Nathanson, if there's a problem, you and I get to talk

[38:54] again too. Because I got to study on it. And what this cleared up, Mr. Koolie, one more thing. I'm going

[39:01] to continue this hearing. And I'm going to continue the issue. What I should do. I'm posing more

[39:08] sanctions upon you until I see what happens on Thursday and Friday of next week and Monday the

[39:14] week thereafter. You understand that, sir? Yes, sir. And sir, again, find out that you're

[39:20] violating any issue for these orders. We got him. We're saying you.

[39:26] Nothing. You have nothing to worry about. Thank you. Anything more, Mr.

[39:30] Nathanson, that can accomplish today from your standpoint.

[39:34] Nothing further from the trustees position. Thank you for your time this morning. I appreciate it.

[39:38] You're welcome. Mr. Koolie, anything that I could perhaps clarify with you in terms of what I want you to do

[39:45] and not do? The only question I have is, what do I do if I can't get a hold of my attorney?

[39:52] What I would suggest you do is prime mindly. And Mr. Nathanson, would you accept a phone call from

[39:58] Mr. Koolie if he can't get a hold of Mr. Hodgson's by say Wednesday? Well, I mean, ethically,

[40:06] your honor. I have a problem with that. Unless I have written permission from Mr. Hodgson to do so.

[40:13] However, if the court puts it in an order, I think that should be sufficient.

[40:23] Anything more, Mr. Koolie, in terms of the increase in the court?

[40:27] No, you got it.

[40:28] Thank you. I've concluded the record this time. It's Koolie. I think it's been cooperative that you have

[40:34] with today. I will allow the marshals to release you at this time. But if you don't appear on either

[40:41] Friday or Monday, whenever we expect to see your, they will come back and you will not be going home

[40:47] to that time. You understand that, sir? I do. I got it. No worries, Your Honor.

[40:50] Thank you very much. I hope not. Thank you. Mr. Nathanson, we're going to close the record now.

[40:55] All right. Great. Thank you, Your Honor. Have a great day.

[40:57] Thanks.

[40:57] Koolie, can we reach that fall rise?

[41:00] May God have mercy on your soul. I think that line says it all. This is, that concludes the

[41:09] transcript that we have. I want to just talk about a few things in that last part. So one is

[41:17] how annoying one is it when Kevin's like, I want to say how gracious the US marshals were when

[41:22] they came to my house. Like, what a suck up kiss ass thing to do to try and do what? It's like he's

[41:29] always trying to save his character. And he always presents himself like his character is being

[41:35] assassinated by all these people. And he has an inability to take any responsibility for what he's

[41:42] done. Nowhere during this 41 minutes does Kevin ever say, you know, judge, I'm really sorry.

[41:51] I'm trying to get people their money back. It's almost like he's just ignoring what's happened.

[41:58] You know, he just he just puts himself in this role of victim. And we also hear the judge

[42:04] explain this very short leash that Kevin is on. And how this is it? This is it. And I love how we

[42:11] tries to also say that, well, what happens if I can't contact my lawyer? What lawyer wants to work

[42:18] with Kevin? He has no money. You know that no one's going to want to touch him now. It's completely

[42:22] toxic. And he's going to use that excuse. But he doesn't realize he doesn't realize that he's

[42:28] out of those excuses. And it's over. It's over. And what sucks about this whole thing is, is that

[42:38] 250 people out there got duped. And I actually lost $250 on Predator. I was going to get one.

[42:47] And I gave a guy $250 bucks. And then I realized like it just started to smell like shit. And I was

[42:52] like, you know what? Just keep the money. He was going to sell me his spot for a thousand more than

[42:56] the game was going for. But for 250 people out there who lost money, it is painful to listen to

[43:05] this idiot. It is painful that he has lied to you. It is painful to hear his excuses and his

[43:15] lack of remorse, his lack of accountability, his lack of responsibility. And the judge is not

[43:21] falling for it. And I know some people are like, well, I think the judge went pretty lenient. Now

[43:26] the judge has to give him an ability, an ability to comply. Right. And that's the whole point of

[43:34] his hearing. But we all know that Kevin's not going to comply. There will be more excuses. We've

[43:40] seen this man walk around nonchalantly at different arcade auctions, buying coin-out machines.

[43:48] We've seen him buy his mom a home. We've seen him give his kid laptop computers. He is incapable,

[43:56] incapable of doing the right thing. So why do we think he's going to do the right thing now?

[44:02] Right. He's going to be locked up. All right. I think the next step is Kevin is going to be locked up.

[44:07] He's going to try and come up with more excuses. But here's the thing. This man's life will forever

[44:13] be ruined. And it should be. You should not be allowed to turn a corner. There was a point

[44:20] where if Kevin had just said, I'm sorry, everybody. The money is not all gone, but a lot of it is

[44:27] gone because we do know that he had to pay vendors. You know, he started to make the machines. He

[44:31] started to order parts. If he said to you, people look, the most I can get everybody back is a thousand

[44:37] dollars is 1500 bucks. People would have been fine with that because we do know that money was spent.

[44:45] But the fact that he didn't give back a penny that he saw that number in his account, right? There

[44:51] was a moment where Kevin saw his balance read maybe 300,000 dollars. Maybe it was 400,000 dollars.

[44:59] I don't know what it exactly was, but at that moment where he decided to keep it, to spend it,

[45:06] that moment he became the devil, that moment he became unforgivable. And in that moment,

[45:15] he signed his own death warrant. Now, we're not going to kill the guy, but his life is over because

[45:22] of that singular moment where he could decide to be honest and do the right thing or do the criminal

[45:30] thing and steal the money and he decided to steal it. And that's it. And this is where his life

[45:35] has now ended up by being dragged into court by the US marshals, by being given just one more chance

[45:42] to comply. And the next step is prison. And he will go to prison for this because he's not going to

[45:50] comply. His life is over. His life is over. And what sucks is deep down inside, Kevin Kool-Aid knows

[45:57] what he did. He knows he never had the license to predator. And that's the thing about this man

[46:03] is how many times did he confirm for people that everything was okay, that he did have the license?

[46:12] He's a pathological liar. And I know that all of you, not just the people who were burned,

[46:19] but the people who know people who were burned and just fans of the pinball community,

[46:23] all of you are happy to hear that his lifelines are running out, that his time is running out.

[46:31] Because what he did was he hurt the entire hobby. His money, money that went to predator,

[46:38] it just evaporated. The whole boutique industry suffered because of it. People will always,

[46:45] always remember, Kevin Kool-Aid, they'll remember J-Pop as times when my money just disappeared.

[46:54] And it hurts the hobby. It hurts the hobby. It hurts Jerry's chances at selling P3 because people

[47:02] are going to be anxious and skittish about giving him money. It hurts Andrew Highway's ability

[47:08] to get people to go in and give money early because of what happened here.

[47:14] Anyone who wants to ask people for money will always be remembered of skittish.

[47:20] And look, that's the silver lining though. The silver lining takeaway is that you should ask

[47:26] the tough questions. You should, if there are red flags with an organization, you should say

[47:33] something. I'm going to say this and I mean this. I think people, even though this went down,

[47:40] even though Kevin did what he did, and even though he screwed people over, I still think the community

[47:46] has forgotten what happened a little bit. They are not asking the tough questions of all the

[47:55] companies that are out there that they should be. Just because you make a pinball machine,

[48:01] just because you're bringing around the shows does not mean your company is in strong financial

[48:08] ground and that you should, you're in a position to be taking people's money.

[48:14] And I'm seeing history repeat itself a little bit with other manufacturers where money could

[48:20] be lost. Money could easily be lost and no one wants to speak up. Nobody wants to say, you know

[48:26] it, maybe I should get a refund. No one wants to say, man, I don't think things are so good over

[48:31] there financially. And it's a shame. It doesn't matter if you have a license or not. That was

[48:37] Kevin's issue, but there are many other issues that plague the other manufacturers out there

[48:43] that people should be holding these companies accountable for what they say. But this podcast is

[48:49] about Kevin. Kevin, Kevin, you suck and you're about to go down and you got to stop blaming the

[48:58] internet and you got to stop taking responsibility. He's never going to do it. He's going to be locked

[49:03] up. What do you guys think about this whole thing? I know you're happy. If you have any thoughts or

[49:08] feedback send it to canada.com at gmail.com. But that's it. That's what's going on. I hope you enjoyed

[49:16] it. I know I enjoyed listening to Kevin be told what's next. I love hearing the suggestion that

[49:24] he's going to get locked up. I do. I think that's where he belongs. So without further ado, enjoy,

[49:31] enjoy NFL playoff championship games today and enjoy the fact that Kevin Kool-Aik is running

[49:37] out of time. Have a good day everyone. Canada out.
