[00:00] Welcome to episode 284 of Canatus Fimball Podcast on your host, Canada.

[00:22] We have a really great show for you today.

[00:24] I had a chance to sit down and talk to an individual who I think is doing a lot of really

[00:31] good stuff for the Pimball hobby.

[00:33] You know, we hear a lot about expanding Pimball, bringing Pimball to new people, bringing Pimball

[00:39] to new cities, getting new Pimball machines into homes, getting a new generation of people

[00:44] playing Pimball.

[00:45] And a lot of people, you know, talk about it, but only a very, very few amount of people

[00:51] actually do it and actually dedicate their lives to making Pimball expand out in the

[00:57] world.

[00:58] And on this episode of Canada Fimball Podcast, I'm going to sit down with someone who

[01:03] had a little bit of a controversial thread on Pinside.

[01:07] His name is Nick Parks, owner of the Pimball Company, owner of the Silver Ball Pimball

[01:13] Barcade, a man is about to open up the Chicago Pimball Hall of Fame.

[01:20] And really awesome guy.

[01:21] And this is going to be a little bit of a podcast where we only air the interview.

[01:26] And I'm going to do a separate sort of Pimball news podcast later on simply because Nick and

[01:31] I had a very lengthy talk.

[01:33] And you know me, I have a policy where I don't want to go anywhere near two hours.

[01:37] And we're going to be close to that.

[01:38] But I think it's going to be worth it.

[01:40] I think you're going to hear a lot of really interesting things.

[01:43] We're going to talk a lot about all the things Nick has going on.

[01:47] We're going to talk about the Jetsons Pimball and how that came to be a spooky title and

[01:51] almost was someone else's title.

[01:53] We're going to talk about Scooby Doo.

[01:55] We're going to talk about the We Fun Me thing that people have been talking about back

[02:00] and forth.

[02:01] So I think you're really going to enjoy it.

[02:03] And I think you're going to walk away from this interview.

[02:06] The way I did, just thinking that Nick is a good guy who's trying to expand Pimball out

[02:10] in the world.

[02:11] And I think we need more individuals like him and the hobby who are doing a positive thing

[02:16] to grow this sport, this hobby, and this collectible thing that we all enjoy.

[02:21] All right.

[02:22] So everybody, without further ado, Nick Parks.

[02:27] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[02:31] A very special guest.

[02:33] He is the founder of the Pimball Company, the Game Room Superstore back in 2006.

[02:41] The owner of Silver Ball Barcade in Columbia, Missouri is planning to open up a Pimball

[02:46] Hall of Fame in Chicago, hopefully sometime in 2019.

[02:51] Husband, father, and from what I can gather from a lot of people, Nick, an overall really

[02:55] good guy.

[02:56] Welcome to Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[02:58] Thank you.

[02:59] Thanks for having me.

[03:00] Nick, now I've sort of seen the Pimball Company over the years as anyone who gets into

[03:06] the hobby.

[03:07] You started an online retailer for Pimball many, many years ago.

[03:13] For listeners of the show, do you want to walk us through what it was like starting a Pimball

[03:19] retailer or a coin-op retailer that many years ago?

[03:22] And what led you to do that coming out of an NBA degree?

[03:27] Well, to me, I was like, you know, at that point, if you were to ask me, if it was home

[03:36] to me, I was going to be selling Pimball machines for a living.

[03:38] I would have told you, it's absolutely crazy.

[03:39] I didn't have any real connection with Pimball machines.

[03:43] Certainly I'd played Pimball machines, probably played a lot more Mortal Kombat and NBA

[03:48] Jam stuff like that when I was a kid.

[03:50] But, you know, I had no idea.

[03:52] It was just kind of a weird situation that I ended up doing what I'm doing.

[03:57] But long story short, I wanted to actually teach college so I applied to some PhD programs.

[04:04] Some big schools and those didn't fall through.

[04:08] I got on a short list, but they said, ultimately, I didn't think that I was going to be a good

[04:12] researcher.

[04:13] That was probably a little bit too extroverted to do what it's going to take to be a PhD

[04:17] student.

[04:18] And they were probably right.

[04:19] Honestly, I really just wanted to, you know, educate men or, you know, young adults,

[04:25] be a college professor and to teach business.

[04:29] But it's probably better than working out that way.

[04:33] Because I didn't really know how to business at the time other than having an NBA.

[04:37] I just, you know, I just thought it'd be really exciting to be a college professor.

[04:41] But it just didn't pan out.

[04:43] But I went and got a job.

[04:45] My buddy worked at Game Room Retailer in St. Louis.

[04:49] Started selling pool tables.

[04:51] They sold Pimball machines there.

[04:53] And I just thought, that's really, really cool.

[04:56] Who sells Pimball machines?

[04:59] And we sold a lot.

[05:00] So I thought, let's look into it and see if anybody's doing it.

[05:02] And there was just one company that I saw at the time, VMI in Florida.

[05:07] And I was like, well, that website doesn't look, you know, that great.

[05:11] And he seems to be doing pretty well.

[05:12] So let me give it a try.

[05:15] So I just, you know, what am I going to call this thing?

[05:18] Well, the pinball company.

[05:19] It's not taking.

[05:20] Okay, let's use that.

[05:21] And just every day was like doing this crazy thing, you know, if starting a retail company,

[05:28] not really knowing a whole lot about Pimball machines.

[05:31] I knew where I could get them.

[05:33] I looked up a Pimball price guide and kind of worked at my, you know, wholesale retail model.

[05:38] And we, I guess from what I know, I mean, because I wasn't looking at other people's websites

[05:43] to see what they sold Pimball machines or use Pimball machines for.

[05:47] I just kind of created my own, you know, wholesale retail model.

[05:52] And just started selling machines based on what I knew I could pay for them.

[05:56] And what I knew, you know, what I hoped people would pay.

[05:59] I just kind of built in the profit margin.

[06:01] And so it was just kind of a weird thing.

[06:03] You know, I think there's a market for X.

[06:06] You create a website, you, you know, put the product on there and you don't know if it's

[06:11] going to work.

[06:12] It's just fortunately for me, day one, the phone was ringing and people wanted to buy

[06:16] Pimball machines.

[06:18] And at that moment, you have to kind of decide, okay, am I going to do this?

[06:22] And if I'm going to do this, I have to learn a lot about Pimball machines, where to get

[06:26] them, how to ship them, how to repair them.

[06:29] And it's a huge undertaking when you not come from the Pimball world.

[06:32] But I, day by day, I figured it out, you know.

[06:36] Right.

[06:37] And, you know, back in that time period for the most part, I mean, 2006, you pretty much

[06:43] only had Stern Pimball making Pimball machines out in the world.

[06:46] And if people wanted to buy games, and I know you sell everything from the newer titles

[06:52] to even some of the classic games as well, you know, there really wasn't.

[06:56] And it won't stop place to go to, right?

[06:59] I mean, you've got forums, you had eBay.

[07:02] But for the most part, someone who wants to go buy a Pimball machine back then, it's

[07:06] not as easy as it is today with a lot more distributors, a lot more online retailers, a lot

[07:12] more resources in terms of, I don't, you know, Pinside wasn't even around back then,

[07:16] right?

[07:17] It's like people were literally had to scrub sort of niche forums, right?

[07:21] Like, you know, if someone wants to go buy like a Monster Bash in 2006, look how much

[07:25] harder it was then compared to what it is today.

[07:28] Yeah, I think, you know, eBay was certainly very popular and was well into its drive as

[07:34] far as gaining users and getting people accustomed with maybe even looking for higher dollar

[07:40] items.

[07:41] I think eBay Motors existed at that time, so people were posting cars and things like

[07:46] that.

[07:47] As far as sources for Pimball, Internet Pimball database was there.

[07:51] I remember our main source for buying games wholesale was either eBay or Mr. Pimball.

[07:59] And, you know, of course, after Pinside, Mr. Pimball kind of kind of went away or, you

[08:05] know, wasn't something that we visited regularly, but through that, you know, we would get the

[08:10] Mr. Pimball price guide.

[08:12] We would, you know, check eBay.

[08:14] I'm trying to remember, I'm thinking back 12 years.

[08:18] So we had some loose collector connections in the St. Louis area, but not like, you know,

[08:24] we do now with Pinside and Pinside.

[08:27] The platform is great.

[08:28] Of course, it's connected with a lot of people all across the country who are selling games.

[08:34] And once I kind of got into that world and figured out what Pinside was, I don't know what

[08:38] it created, but I was probably way late in the game.

[08:41] But once I learned about it, I'm like, this is great.

[08:43] And that kind of displaced some of our buying from people on Mr. Pimball and really searching

[08:49] eBay every day.

[08:50] It was great to be at know that we were buying directly from collectors.

[08:54] But yeah, things were completely different.

[08:56] I mean, there was not, I mean, hardly any people selling Pimball machines online, maybe

[09:01] three or four.

[09:02] I know Pimball sales existed.

[09:05] I know, you know, BMI maybe one or two others, but if you look at today, I mean, there

[09:12] are a ton of people who in their local markets are making a living selling Pimball machines,

[09:17] which is great.

[09:19] BMI, obviously, when I read their story and how well they were doing with the website that

[09:26] I thought was kind of antiquated and not the way I would do things, it gave me a lot of

[09:32] confidence to say, hey, if they can do it, I can do it.

[09:35] And maybe I can do it better.

[09:37] And I set a goal of trying to get more traffic than them and ultimately trying to sell more

[09:42] Pimball machines than anybody else.

[09:44] I'm hopefully maybe some of my success kind of rubbed off on people I know it has, but

[09:49] I mean, it's good.

[09:50] And it's a good feeling to know that other people are also making a living selling Pimball

[09:53] machines that were inspired by my story as well.

[09:56] Right.

[09:57] So when you, and I want to, I definitely want to talk Nick about like the recent threads

[10:02] that I'm going on in PimSive, but before that, I want to, a lot of people who listen to

[10:07] the show, a lot of them are Pimball collectors.

[10:09] And you're, do you think the most important thing to someone who's new to the hobby is

[10:14] really having that customer service from a retailer, because these machines, they require

[10:21] setup, they're heavy.

[10:23] Things can happen when you unbox them.

[10:25] Is it, is what really makes the difference in, is that first pin you buy that the experience

[10:30] is a good one for you to stay in the hobby for a lot of people?

[10:34] I think it is.

[10:35] Definitely.

[10:36] We hear from so many people who got into the hobby because a friend sold the machine or

[10:44] they decided they were interested in buying a machine and bought a machine on eBay.

[10:49] And ultimately buy it from a rep people dealer.

[10:53] They buy from us or someone else.

[10:55] And they, you know, they're like, well, I've got these other machines that I bought.

[11:00] Can you help me get those up, you know, up to snuff?

[11:03] Can you help me refurbish those or what can I trade those in?

[11:07] Because now that I found a reputable dealer, I'm going to only buy for a reputable dealer.

[11:12] So these are people who are new to the hobby who don't know how to work on machines.

[11:18] So if they have a bad experience right away in their machines, always broken, I bet that

[11:25] they kind of get burned out.

[11:26] But if they're real pinball enthusiasts, if they really get the bug and they want to buy,

[11:30] maybe they'll have this time I'm going to try to buy from a little more reputable source

[11:34] or maybe I'll buy a new machine.

[11:36] And then we hear so many times, these are first time buyers from us, but they have other

[11:41] machines and, you know, they want us to take them a trade or help getting those machines

[11:48] up to par with the refurbish machines they buy from us.

[11:52] Right.

[11:53] And because you deal with machines that are both from the 90s and the new games, what's

[11:58] more reliable?

[11:59] Because I've always speculated on this show, are the older games than 90s, were they

[12:03] built like tanks to survive in our Cades, or are the newer games more reliable?

[12:09] What's your experience between the two?

[12:12] Hey, kind of, over the years, it's kind of, we've kind of swayed back and forth in our

[12:19] paintings on that.

[12:20] If we go back to 2006, there's one manufacturer.

[12:25] And our refurbishing process was not what it is today.

[12:31] You know, we were figuring out, I was a pinball technician, I was doing refurbishing

[12:34] of pinball machines, just giving my hands in there running out of fixed problems.

[12:38] And I was training people to be pinball technicians based on just going out there and learning

[12:43] what they can on.

[12:45] I don't remember the maybe wrecking pinball and other new groups and things like that.

[12:50] YouTube, there was probably some things on YouTube, but just trying to figure out, once you

[12:55] learn how switching to someone who's working, anybody who's relatively technically inclined

[13:00] to figure out a service machine, then of course a lot of customers or bars have gone down

[13:04] that path.

[13:05] And now, they maybe can't be technicians, but they can service and maintain their own

[13:10] machines.

[13:11] So, you know, early on, I was the guy and then ultimately we trained some people and

[13:19] then ultimately we land on the gets.

[13:22] We've had them for five years.

[13:24] And our refurbishing process is amazing.

[13:26] I'm like, just do everything.

[13:28] Don't worry about using a calculator, what's going to cost to get this thing up.

[13:32] I mean, put new glass, put a new coil into our new rails, new balls and every machine,

[13:37] new rumours.

[13:38] Of course, a lot of stuff that everybody does, but there's certain things that we do that

[13:40] are like, let's just go a little extra.

[13:43] Let's make it look as nice as we can.

[13:45] And so our rehearsing process is very extensive.

[13:48] So now when I tell people in comparison, after our refurbishing process, we do flip a

[13:55] rebuild.

[13:56] So the flippers are going to play like new.

[13:58] I say, you know, really don't worry about buying a refurbishing machine because it's

[14:03] kind of how about the same reliability as a new machine.

[14:06] Right.

[14:07] And so, for people who they really want an Adams family, we sold 130 Adams families

[14:13] in the last 12 years.

[14:15] So I'm not going to say don't buy an Adams family, buy a new machine because it's so much

[14:19] more reliable.

[14:20] Right.

[14:21] After it's been through our refurbishing process and we do what we do, I'm confident that

[14:25] it's going to have equal reliability of a brand new machine.

[14:29] But again, we're at a different point.

[14:31] We were when we started.

[14:33] And then there was a period of time like in 2008, 2009, 2010, where to me, and I'm sure

[14:39] the collector community, it appeared that new PIMO machines were kind of watered down.

[14:44] There wasn't a whole lot to them.

[14:47] And in that time frame, maybe in that time frame, I would tell people, you know what, play

[14:51] a Williams game from the 90s or look at a Williams game from the 90s, like a 20 year old machine.

[14:59] And look at a stir machine that's been played for a year or two in compared to play fields.

[15:05] And honestly, the Williams machines that were 20 years old, sitting next to a stir

[15:12] machine that was a few years or nothing wrong with the stir machines, it's just the Williams

[15:15] machines were made really well.

[15:17] I mean, the clear codes on the play fields and whatnot.

[15:21] And that was a short period of time.

[15:22] I mean, for me, I noticed the difference.

[15:25] And then I do think things changed to where Stern was doing a better job with clear

[15:31] code in their play fields or whatever the situation was.

[15:34] I don't know if it was the play fields or what, but there was a lot of planking.

[15:38] If you remember, like, some of those games from the early, early mid 2000s, a lot of

[15:43] machines, you know, played like Monopoly, you get them in and they would just have all

[15:46] kinds of planking in the play field.

[15:47] You didn't see that on a lot of, you know, Williams value machines from the 90s.

[15:53] So I think there was a period where pinball needed to survive.

[15:56] So cost cutting, they were the only people making it.

[15:58] So there was no competition.

[16:00] And I think that at that period of time, I would open people's eyes to, in my showroom,

[16:04] I would say here, here's a 20 year old Williams machine.

[16:07] Here's a Stern that's only been out for a few years.

[16:09] You can see, hey, those machines are holding up better.

[16:12] Don't worry about buying a new one because in a few years, it could easily look like

[16:15] this referring to a few year old.

[16:18] And I feel bad as a thermostruder to say now, but there was a period of time where I was

[16:22] pushing it.

[16:23] We made a lot more money selling used machines for the new machines.

[16:27] And very easy for me to say, hey, look, buy this World Cup soccer, you know, buy this,

[16:33] you know, whatever your kids are into, whatever you're into, there's something for you out

[16:36] there in a Williams value machine.

[16:39] And those are great machine machines.

[16:41] Right.

[16:42] But again, things changed.

[16:43] There's no time.

[16:44] Yeah, I mean, I don't think you're going to see a lot of people say that, you know, it

[16:49] was a golden era when Stern was pumping out CSI and monopoly and games like that.

[16:55] And I think, you know, when we look at the landscape now, Nick, it's like, there's

[16:58] so many companies, right?

[17:00] And are you, we talk a lot on this podcast.

[17:03] And we see a lot on Pinside the speculation about, are there too many pinball manufacturers

[17:09] nowadays?

[17:10] I mean, if we fast forward now and to the current landscape, there is, there are a lot

[17:16] of people trying to make money and find customers for their pinball ventures.

[17:22] Do you think the market is getting oversaturated?

[17:25] Because we even have more companies promising games to come out in 2019.

[17:29] Like, what are your thoughts on that?

[17:31] Yeah, I think, I mean, honestly, the quick answer is yes.

[17:35] I think it's over getting a little oversaturated.

[17:37] You don't know when, where the tipping point is.

[17:42] Even if you look at like what the automobile industry went through with so many makes and

[17:46] models and out there at a period of time.

[17:49] And then obviously, you know, there was a worry that a Ford or a Chevy or, you know, they

[17:55] could, they could go bankrupt when there's situations where there's not demand for cars.

[18:01] Because there were too many choices.

[18:03] And some fall out and of course, the economy rebounded.

[18:06] Stern very easily could not have been around.

[18:09] You know, it's very quite possible that there would be no manufacturers if it wasn't for,

[18:14] you know, people investing in Stern at that point and keeping things alive.

[18:18] And just, it may be part of watering down Pemo machines and cost cutting is why it's still survived.

[18:24] No, I'm not pointing any blame at why machines were, you know, what they were back then.

[18:31] If you're making machines back then and you can buy a play field for 20% less, maybe

[18:35] it didn't quite last as long, but you can make it work.

[18:41] You had to find margin where you could.

[18:43] So licenses, you know, maybe they bought the least cheapest licenses they can get cut down

[18:49] on parts maybe did less with the play fields in terms of design.

[18:54] Did what they had to do to survive.

[18:57] So but today where we are today and Pemo is certainly thriving, there's so many people

[19:01] who are making money, manufacturing machines, manufacturing and selling parts, selling

[19:06] machines, operating machines, barcades, amusement centers, things are good.

[19:11] It's very easy not to make, I mean, it's hard not to make money if you have a generally

[19:16] good business sense and can get in with the right manufacturers and things like that.

[19:21] So what that being said when it's, when it's easy, it's easy to think that things are

[19:27] going to continue this way.

[19:28] And I for one, I'm positioning myself so that it maybe, maybe it's not.

[19:34] So what I mean by that is we are a pretty diversified company and we sell a lot of different

[19:41] products outside of Pimbal.

[19:44] We are amusement operators, so we operate machines.

[19:48] We have real estate holdings, we have a lot of other investments so that if Pimbal doesn't

[19:52] do well, we can survive.

[19:55] And big part of that is that we sell used machines.

[19:58] So if there was no Pimbal manufacturers today, we'll be able to make a market on the Pimbal

[20:03] machines that exist.

[20:04] And so that's always been a big part of our business and so that even if manufacturers

[20:09] all collectively fail or we lose a distributor ship or whatever happens, we'll always have

[20:15] Pimbal machines to sell because we can just sell machines that already exist with which

[20:18] is exactly how we started.

[20:20] Right.

[20:21] So I mean, I don't think anyone would ever say that there's, you know, Pimbal demand, it's

[20:25] not going to drive up anytime soon, right?

[20:27] I mean, the people, we're around the same age.

[20:30] Who grew up in the arcades and around Pimbal and classic coin up machines and street fighter?

[20:36] We now have disposable income and I think when we go to Pimbal shows and we see who's

[20:41] buying these machines, you know, it's very much a generation that grew up with them, very

[20:45] much a generation that has disposable income.

[20:48] The economy has been great for 10 years in a row.

[20:52] But I guess the question I have Nick too is like, you studied business.

[20:55] Are you surprised at the lack of business acumen that is displayed by some of these new

[21:01] Pimbal companies that seem to make so many business mistakes as they try to get their Pimbal

[21:07] companies off the ground?

[21:08] And I'm talking about guys like Andrew Highway, Barry and Yop, John Papaduke.

[21:13] For every success, it seems like there's two failures.

[21:19] Yeah, because it seems at times to be almost too easy.

[21:26] When outsiders looking in and even when you see a success story like, you know, like spooky

[21:34] Pimbal, you think, oh gosh, if they can do it, I can do it.

[21:37] Which is of course the mentality that I had going into this thing and so I get that.

[21:43] And so it's very easy for people to say that if Charlie and company can do it there,

[21:50] why can't we build a whitewood and get a license or just come up with a theme and either

[21:58] raise money through Kickstarter or however, a pre-order sales like Jersey Jack did, if

[22:04] he can do it, why can't we?

[22:05] And gosh, aren't they rich?

[22:07] Aren't all of those people rich?

[22:10] I mean, isn't Stern, I mean, isn't Gary Stern rich?

[22:14] Is aren't all these Pimbal designers rich?

[22:16] Isn't Jersey Jack and all those people rich?

[22:19] And the answer is no.

[22:20] I mean, they're making a living in probably barely and it takes a lot of hard work.

[22:25] But you're going to have those guys who just don't realize, you know, how hard it is and

[22:29] are going to give it a shot.

[22:30] And yeah, well, I think what happens to Nick is like, people see the fact that there's

[22:37] money to be made, right?

[22:39] There's demand for this.

[22:40] I mean, we saw that when John Papadu could walk into a show without ever manufacturing

[22:46] something in his entire life and people were writing him checks for $16,000, site unseen,

[22:52] right?

[22:53] And times have changed a little bit, but about maybe like six years ago, you know, people

[22:57] were just throwing money.

[22:59] All you had to say is, I'm going to make a Pimbal game and, you know, write the check

[23:04] out to the following company.

[23:07] And we saw people like, Skit B, take 250 orders on Predator, you know, John Papadu got his

[23:12] games.

[23:13] Do you think people have finally wised up and are now not going to go in on these like

[23:20] pre-order, you know, models anymore and that we've learned our lesson and we're going

[23:26] to buy from gentlemen like you have a game that's in a box that you can get to my door

[23:30] within a week.

[23:32] I think that the end of pre-orders was for me and probably a lot of people, Pobbet.

[23:41] I think Wizard of Oz, Jack out of free pass because he was creating a new company and

[23:45] even what he did accomplish, even though he used pre-order money and all that, I mean,

[23:49] what he ended up with in terms of the intellectual property and what led to the machines is making

[23:56] now, it's very impressive.

[23:58] It took a lot of hard work and a lot of the right team.

[24:02] In a sense crowdfunding made it happen and the connections that he had in the industry.

[24:08] But when it took so long to get Wizard of Oz out, but yet he ultimately did and then

[24:14] said here's an ex-great game, Pobbet.

[24:17] It kind of felt like to me and probably a lot of people that that was kind of a Ponzi's

[24:20] game that a lot of people didn't receive their Wizard of Oz's were already putting

[24:24] deposits on Hobbits.

[24:26] And then we put up a bunch of money for Hobbits as well as a distributor and it got to the

[24:32] point to where we were worried, are we ever going to get it?

[24:35] And a lot of companies, a lot of us and a lot of other distributors, a lot of individuals.

[24:41] I don't know where Skitbee and all that fits in to the timeline, but I just remember thinking

[24:45] Jack is, I mean, there was lawsuits thrown around.

[24:48] I was like thinking, I'm going to be out $250,000.

[24:52] My Pobbet money is going to be gone.

[24:54] And I was already formulating a plan to take care of my customers.

[24:58] I was always trying to figure out how I was going to be right.

[25:02] And the answer was I was going to pay them all back.

[25:04] And I was going to be personally out that money because that was the right thing to do.

[25:09] And so we were really figuring out, it's a lot of money that actually to lose, but we

[25:15] had a plan to make right customers.

[25:19] And then I called Jack and I talked to him, I said, look Jack, I really don't feel good.

[25:25] I like to get a refund.

[25:26] You know, tell me something.

[25:28] Tell me what I need to know because I'm seeing all these stories about lawsuits and how

[25:32] you're probably going to go back up and everything.

[25:34] And he said, give me one more week, two more week.

[25:37] I don't know where it was.

[25:38] I said, give me one more week.

[25:39] I didn't say two weeks.

[25:40] That's Andrew Highway's trademark phrase.

[25:43] Yeah, he said something like, you know, we're almost there.

[25:46] I can't tell you yet, but just give me all your worries going to be gone.

[25:51] And then I do remember getting that phone call and him saying, here, on the other line,

[25:55] I've got someone so and he, you don't have to worry about it.

[26:02] We have all the money we need.

[26:04] And then of course, now and no, you know, they got an investor and all the bills were paid.

[26:10] Here I was making calls to some parts suppliers and they were like, yeah, Jack owes me all this

[26:14] money and he's not getting me parts.

[26:16] So I knew machines were going to get made and this Jack paid them and I knew Jack wasn't

[26:19] going to pay them because nobody else would give them deposits.

[26:22] And I knew so this was where you thought, well, maybe, maybe game three, you know, was

[26:26] his a vase.

[26:27] He used to have money, but bill worth of the vases.

[26:30] Maybe an ounce game three paid for house, but we knew that he wasn't going to get that

[26:33] money.

[26:34] People were like, no, no more.

[26:35] You're done.

[26:36] Make my habit.

[26:37] And then maybe I'll think about giving you money for game three.

[26:39] And he got the investor, which is great.

[26:42] But everybody else at the same time skit be, I guess I put out a skit be deposit.

[26:48] I think I lost that money.

[26:51] You know, I'm trying to play, I put a support.

[26:54] If someone put a kickstarter campaign out right now for a game that I thought was going

[26:58] to be cool and it was like, give me $5,000 in a period.

[27:01] I would probably put up the money just like I did for it because I want to support people

[27:05] in the Pimbo community and I have that money to lose if it goes, if I don't get it.

[27:10] Right.

[27:11] I don't be the only guy coming up with ideas and making machines and making money.

[27:15] I want to give guys like Charlie with Jettons.

[27:17] I wanted to give that business to him because I thought, here's a guy, a family guy, just

[27:25] like me, has a dream to create a Pimbo manufacturing company.

[27:29] And I decided to contract it with him to have him build on a machine.

[27:32] So these things, but at the time Charlie was at the same point, I can't get deposit.

[27:38] If I can't, like $250, that's where we are today.

[27:40] People are comfortable putting the deposit, but they're not going to put up all this money

[27:44] up front like with Predator.

[27:46] Let me let's play a hypothetical here because we all saw that Jack got the billionaire investor

[27:55] which helped him get out of that quagmire.

[27:58] But let's just say he didn't get that right.

[28:00] And let's say that you were out $250,000.

[28:05] How could you save your customers who paid for it?

[28:11] Whose money is now evaporated?

[28:13] Because we've seen this happen a few other times with Zidware customers and how do you make

[28:18] someone whole when that money is now gone for good?

[28:22] I think if I'm, of course, I told you I would pay my customers back.

[28:27] So our plan was to do deals where we would give them maybe half their cash back and half

[28:35] credit towards another different machine.

[28:40] Or we would have a timeline where we would have all of our customers pay back within a

[28:44] year.

[28:45] They would all be out of my pocket essentially.

[28:47] Right.

[28:48] But I think our customers would have understood.

[28:50] There would have been customers that probably said, no, Jack, you gave our money to Jack,

[28:55] you're fine.

[28:56] We don't want you to get a pocket on.

[28:58] And they would, and they would, of course, they would hear all the news and they would

[29:01] know why I don't have their money and they're not getting a game.

[29:05] I think, but I always wanted to like have a plan for everybody.

[29:09] I think that if I look at, if I'm poppity or I'm, I'm Skippy or I'm all the deals that

[29:17] go on bad, every single one of them, I look at it from the standpoint of I couldn't,

[29:23] I don't know how I could live with myself if I didn't make good on money that I took

[29:27] from people.

[29:29] I would, and that's why I don't really feel like funding those types of projects that way

[29:34] would really be ideal for me is because I would never take it over risk with my own money

[29:40] knowing that if they're money, you got lost, I would pay that back.

[29:43] So either way, it's my money.

[29:45] So I don't know.

[29:46] It's just, it's just a weird environment and I don't have intimate knowledge about, you

[29:50] know, I have good meetings with poppity.

[29:52] I introduce them to Robert Neal or Deeproot, you know, I think highly the guy, but I understand

[29:58] people are in that situation and they maybe believe more in themselves and not 100% themselves

[30:05] understand the risks involved.

[30:07] And we could have sold zero jetzins and we would have been out 400,000, but I could have

[30:12] taken that loss.

[30:13] I didn't make any pre-orders.

[30:15] I would have been just out that money, but it's money that I was okay losing if it failed.

[30:20] So when you, so introducing J-Pop to Robert, so walk me through that.

[30:25] So you've seen John take the money from people for Zidware.

[30:28] He obviously bit off more than he could chew.

[30:31] He obviously was out money to distributors, to vendors.

[30:36] Was it hard and good conscious to like recommend him, get another shot?

[30:42] Like you feel like he deserves another shot?

[30:47] When I met with him, there was a couple things going on.

[30:51] I was just getting my feet wet with, I had the jessons license.

[30:54] I didn't know what to do with it.

[30:56] Stern shot me down.

[30:58] I met with Terry at Pimball Life.

[31:00] Terry introduced me to Charlie.

[31:02] That went very well.

[31:03] I liked Charlie immediately.

[31:04] I thought he was a good guy.

[31:06] Trusted the guy.

[31:07] I said, yes, here's a contract.

[31:09] You can build my machine.

[31:11] I kind of hit look, you've built some A machine.

[31:13] So let's do this.

[31:15] And what can I do to support your business?

[31:17] And then through that, I was kind of looking out and thinking, well, if I'm going to be

[31:23] in the manufacturing world or play a role in manufacturing games, I want to see what

[31:29] else is out there.

[31:30] And I think I remember seeing Raza.

[31:33] And I think it was Raza at one of the shows and at the Expo probably.

[31:38] And I was like, that's really cool.

[31:40] Maybe what's up with that?

[31:41] And I heard about Poppadude situation.

[31:43] And so I really went in thinking, what's the status?

[31:47] And he had like five or six magic.

[31:49] They look complete games to me.

[31:51] I was like, whoa.

[31:53] So I didn't really know the situation, how far the dead and dead in this he was.

[31:57] And he kind of pitched to me how I can invest in him and Zidware and how that could ultimately

[32:03] be my manufacturing operation if I did that.

[32:06] And I'm going to do bullet dare.

[32:08] Yeah, I didn't know I'd eligible it because probably there would have been a second

[32:12] meeting, a third meeting or something.

[32:14] But I was like, I'm not ready now.

[32:17] So let me just, let me get Jetsons down with him.

[32:19] And then I'll work with you.

[32:21] And maybe you designed a game and we bring it to him to Zidware and make or whatever.

[32:25] Or maybe we just build a factory.

[32:26] I don't know.

[32:27] And at that time, I think it was around that time Robert Mueller was a customer.

[32:33] So here's a guy who decided he wanted to build a man capable by a pinball machine.

[32:38] And I got the bug came to visit us and said, no, I want 20 pinball.

[32:42] Whatever he bought, he bought a time.

[32:44] This is around the time when I bought Chad Keller's collection out of St. Louis.

[32:47] And it was like 60 games.

[32:49] And he's, I just basically sent him over to Chad's house and said, hey, your timing is

[32:53] great to start a pinball collection.

[32:54] Go to his house and see what you like.

[32:56] I am in them all.

[32:57] I already, you know, I'm already going to do the buy-in for Chad.

[32:59] So take a look.

[33:00] And he had all these great games.

[33:01] And so of course, he just, I want that, I want that, I want that, I want that, I want

[33:03] that.

[33:04] So I got the bug, obviously got him to Dallas, put him in his man case, started playing

[33:08] them.

[33:09] And at the time, he was talking to me about Nick, I love your ideas for pinball.

[33:14] You want to get into pinball.

[33:15] You want to build family-friendly games that $39.99, you can't do it because Sturham won't

[33:20] help you.

[33:21] And you know, they don't want to be contract manufacturers.

[33:23] You did the spooky thing and that is what it is.

[33:25] But you know, tell me more about your idea and the opportunity in making pinball machines

[33:30] and maybe at a lower price point.

[33:32] And so I have great conversations with him.

[33:35] And he said, can you introduce me to, you know, can you introduce me to Dennis Dorman?

[33:40] Can you introduce me to, to John Papu, who can you, I said, yeah, great.

[33:44] Here's the numbers.

[33:46] And he did all the legwork.

[33:47] He met with Terry and Charlie and, you know, Dennis and he met with all these people.

[33:53] And I didn't really know what was going on.

[33:54] I just said, yeah, if you want to talk to these people, talk to them.

[33:57] And then they told me this guy is, he's got some big plans.

[34:01] And I don't know if he's just crazy or just, or what, but, you know, I was like, yeah,

[34:05] yeah, that's, I got the perception that, you know, he's, he's ambitious and, and all

[34:09] these things.

[34:10] But, um, and then I just started hearing this deeper pinball.

[34:13] I'm like, what is he really doing it?

[34:15] So I wasn't really involved in past making those introductions.

[34:19] Okay.

[34:20] So I didn't really, I didn't go through the ethical side of introducing him to Papu Duk and

[34:25] what might come and how that might be perceived by people who gave Papu Duk money.

[34:29] I just like, and in my mind, I thought, here's the guy who made you just make good on all

[34:33] those orders.

[34:34] Right.

[34:35] Right.

[34:36] And that's how he gets Papu Duk in.

[34:37] And I don't know how he's handling all that.

[34:38] But, and I still don't know the extent of, you know, what he would job with John O's people.

[34:41] But, um, it was all kind of after I'd introduced him to John and, and didn't know what he was

[34:46] going to do with that relationship.

[34:48] Have you, do you, do you feel that deep root?

[34:51] Because they, they, they, they were at Expo recently, um, alongside yourself, Nick.

[34:56] Do you, you, you probably caught wind of some of the stuff they were saying they're going

[34:59] to do?

[35:00] Do you think they're going to be able to deliver on there?

[35:02] I mean, they're saying stuff like we're going to have, we're going to make more games in

[35:05] one year than all manufacturers combined.

[35:08] And it's like, wait, you haven't made a single game yet.

[35:11] Ah, okay.

[35:12] So it's going to get tough for me because you got an NDA sign?

[35:17] I do have an NDA, but I mean, it's more than that because I have such a good relationship

[35:21] with pretty much everybody in the industry, you know?

[35:24] Right.

[35:25] I think, I think highly of the people at Stern and have great relationship with Gary and

[35:30] Jambu's Gagley and Jim Belt and Shelley Sachs and all those people there.

[35:35] And, and I, and I think, really highly what's going on and, and, and they're a great company.

[35:43] Then you've got Jack and I was the first year as distributor, Jack's, you know, we've had

[35:49] our differences in the past, but, you know, I think, you know, he, he's done something

[35:53] very, you know, he should be proud of.

[35:56] He got himself out of Jamb and now look, look, I mean, he's still, he's building Pym on

[36:00] machines.

[36:01] He's still doing what he always wanted to do.

[36:04] So I greatly, except for Jack and, and the I was family, so I can't say any bad things

[36:08] there.

[36:10] So I, and Dave Peterson at Stern as well, you know, good guy and good conversations.

[36:15] And then you go on to Chicago gaming and what Doug Dubas doing there is just awesome.

[36:20] I mean, he's a, we've been selling arcade legends and Miss Pat Gallagher's from them

[36:25] for years and the fact that they got the deal done with, you know, with Planetary and

[36:29] are now making Pym on machines, great work, great machines.

[36:34] And there's so many other guys I could tell you, I could give you the whole story about

[36:37] highway and how we were involved there and, and, you know, but that might be, that's a

[36:43] whole other topic.

[36:44] But anyway, when you get to deeper and what he's doing and I certainly have intimate knowledge

[36:48] because he's a friend of mine and he was a customer and he bought all his machines.

[36:52] He kind of got the pinball bug because, you know, he became a customer and we sold a

[36:56] lot of great games and he's William's Valley collection, you know, he's got some stirs,

[37:02] he's got some Jersey Jack games.

[37:04] He's really impartial.

[37:06] And he's basically taking games and kind of gutted them, had engineers look at him and how

[37:11] can we design these better and less expensive and yada yada yada.

[37:15] So I've seen this whole thing and I'm just going to tell you, my gut feeling is that

[37:19] he'll be a player.

[37:20] I years back, I said, there's going to be a machine with an LCD, there's going to be,

[37:27] there's going to be probably three main manufacturers.

[37:29] This is when it was only stirred.

[37:30] This is before Jersey Jack even started.

[37:32] I said, look, Pym will make it, it's new technology will be in there.

[37:36] There's going to be something with an LCD and all this new stuff and there's probably

[37:40] going to be three main power.

[37:41] And now do we have them now?

[37:42] I don't know.

[37:44] Jersey Jack's good.

[37:45] I mean, you have three great manufacturers and arguably there's others that are on the

[37:48] cusp of being big players too.

[37:51] I think deep root is in a position to be one of those top three.

[37:57] So do you think that all that's going to boil down to the ability to manufacture though?

[38:02] I mean, we see a lot of intent to shake up the industry, but ultimately where everyone

[38:07] fumbles is manufacturing.

[38:09] And that's really what's crippled Jack's ability to deliver games with enough cadence.

[38:14] I mean, even with pirates waiting a year to get it out, get it on the line.

[38:18] I mean, Stern's got this model of every three months, the four months, right?

[38:23] Next game, new hype, new sales, next game.

[38:26] And it's like they've got it down to a science.

[38:29] Do you think deep root can figure that science out?

[38:34] I think that there's enough.

[38:36] I mean, you have to look for one knowing Robert.

[38:39] He's kind of like me.

[38:40] You know, if it can be done, if anybody can do it, I can do it as I think his general thought

[38:46] process behind the manufacturing, manufacturing, remote machines is way more ambitious than

[38:51] my thought to just sell remote machines.

[38:54] He has obviously got a lot more to tackle than I had wanting to sell remote machines nationwide.

[39:01] So he is obviously reaching out to people that he trusts and thinks can bring some knowledge.

[39:08] He's got engineers, he's got designers, he's got finance guys, he's got all these people,

[39:15] he's pulled together.

[39:17] And he seems to be the type of guy that can pull things together.

[39:21] And I just from experience, I would think that he's going to have more challenges than

[39:25] he thinks he's going to have.

[39:27] And he's obviously very ambitious and can say all these things.

[39:32] If he just comes just shy of that, I think it's going to be a great success.

[39:36] So I admire his ambition.

[39:40] And Elon Musk can come out and say we're going to build X number of Model X's and whatever.

[39:45] As long as you shoot for a very high number, even if you miss it, it's going to be successful.

[39:51] And I'm not saying he's Elon Musk or anything.

[39:53] And just to me, he comes across as the guy who is going to stumble and he's going to come

[39:59] across challenges that he didn't realize he was going to have.

[40:02] Well he seems like he's going to give it a real go.

[40:06] And so if there's money behind it, if there's that type of ambitious and there's talent

[40:11] behind it, I'm not going to dismiss it yet.

[40:14] I really feel like people are going to be impressed by what they see in March.

[40:19] So try to go.

[40:21] Have you seen anything?

[40:22] I'm not going to ask you to describe anything.

[40:24] But have you seen anything that's made you be like Steve Bowden telling us like just

[40:29] wait.

[40:30] Have you seen anything that's excited you?

[40:33] I'm excited.

[40:34] Yeah.

[40:35] I mean, I would be excited about any.

[40:37] I'm easily excited when it comes to Pippin Ball.

[40:39] You know, I'm like, oh, you're going to make a Beatles.

[40:41] I'll see Pipp- I'm excited.

[40:42] I can't wait to see it play and it's sell bad.

[40:46] And so it's easy for meeting excited.

[40:48] But I've never been involved with like Jersey Jack, you know, I said, you're going to be

[40:54] well, was it a device?

[40:56] Here's some money.

[40:57] I think it's going to be awesome.

[40:58] Not seeing pictures or anything.

[40:59] I just thought, what a cool theme.

[41:01] And just gave him money.

[41:02] So here I am in learning some things, seeing how he's creating from there.

[41:08] There's no factory built.

[41:10] He's got a guy in there designing the factory.

[41:12] So I'm going in early on.

[41:13] And it's really exciting to kind of see at that stage.

[41:17] And for what I saw of what's going to come out, that was the most excited I've been

[41:24] about Pippin Ball since Wizard of Oz.

[41:26] Since I knew that there was going to be more than just one manufacturer.

[41:30] Right.

[41:31] Have you had more choices out there?

[41:33] Did you visit Deeproot?

[41:35] Yeah.

[41:36] I went to San Antonio about a month ago, right before Expo.

[41:40] So a month, month and a half ago.

[41:43] Very cool.

[41:44] I've always had good conversations with Robert offline.

[41:49] I guess, well, online, but off the record.

[41:52] So I'm looking forward to TPS.

[41:53] I think this year's TPS is going to be awesome.

[41:56] I think if anyone wants to go to a show this year where I think there's going to be fireworks,

[41:59] I think it's that one.

[42:01] Nick, talk to me about Jetsons.

[42:04] And so you got the license for Jetsons.

[42:06] And you went to Stern to see if there was a potential for them to help you develop a

[42:12] game.

[42:13] Yeah.

[42:14] And what was the obstacle there for that?

[42:18] My timing was just probably slightly just barely off.

[42:23] We were just really wanting a family-friendly game.

[42:26] And our goal was to build a Jetsons machine high quality, a little bit watered down from

[42:33] a normal Stern Pro, but just still high quality, to sell it at low margin and sell it at 3999.

[42:41] And I knew that only I could only do that with Stern because they're labor costs are so low.

[42:46] And just basically, this is the answer that I got.

[42:48] And one, this is talking to Gary.

[42:52] Talking to Gary on the phone.

[42:53] Nick, one, we'll never be a contract manufacturer.

[42:57] We have no desire to be a contract manufacturer.

[43:00] And two, you cannot build a machine like you're telling me with just taking a few things off

[43:07] the play field, watering it down a little bit, maybe even making it for home.

[43:10] And you cannot design, line out, line out, and ultimately manufacture and sell a machine

[43:18] for 3999.

[43:19] It just can't be done.

[43:21] And in my mind, I'm thinking, okay, I'm talking to Gary Stern, don't be too mean.

[43:25] Or don't be, you know, don't shoot yourself.

[43:27] Yeah.

[43:28] Would you consider it?

[43:30] No one will never be a contract manufacturer.

[43:31] You can't make the numbers work.

[43:33] And then, you know, within months, you know, the whole mid of a madness thing happens

[43:37] in their contract manufacturer.

[43:40] So I think we just missed it by six months.

[43:42] Right.

[43:43] And now they're very clearly open to doing short runs.

[43:48] They've done, well, Nelly, they've done PBR, they've done, you know, that meant 66.

[43:55] It was not their design.

[43:56] It was contract, they'll, so, and then Beatles, of course.

[44:00] So now the conversation is, if you brought us a license or a design game, we will

[44:07] build it.

[44:08] This is what it will cost.

[44:09] So, so, so have you, so there's rumors that you have Scooby Doo is that, is that, is that

[44:13] confirmed or is that still a rumor?

[44:15] I mean, this is, here's the truth, you know, the truth is we don't have a contract license

[44:23] deal for Scooby Doo.

[44:25] We never did.

[44:26] We had a license for Jetsons and Scooby Doo.

[44:29] And I did not want the clock to start on Scooby Doo.

[44:31] I wanted to do Jetsons kind of as a tape tester.

[44:34] If I was going to mess something up or make mistakes, it was going to be Jetsons and then

[44:37] Scooby Doo would be the improved, you know, attempt.

[44:41] So we dropped Scooby from the license and we, we created two of the separate license agreements

[44:46] and we tabled Scooby.

[44:49] And so we did Jetsons.

[44:51] And then I go back and we're talking about Scooby and certainly anybody out there can go

[44:56] and build and get the license for Scooby.

[44:58] It's not necessarily easiest company to work with from experience, but in the life

[45:04] of the license is probably going to cost more than most manufacturers want to pay.

[45:07] But if someone wants to do it, I hope they do it because I just want the game to be built.

[45:11] I think a lot of people want to be built.

[45:13] But I have a good relationship and I'll do it.

[45:16] I'll pay a lot of money for that license and I've already got some design done.

[45:23] But I'm also willing to let someone else do it.

[45:25] I'm willing to turn or if anybody, if deeper wants to do it, get the license and build

[45:29] it.

[45:30] I'm going to sell a ton of it because I know I can sell them.

[45:31] I know it's a family family theme.

[45:34] When it comes down to Jetsons, we sold like 41 last year.

[45:36] I think the next closest title we sold like was 28 or 30.

[45:39] I think it was like Star Wars or something.

[45:41] But you know, so ultimately Jetsons ended up being manufactured by spooky for the, was

[45:47] it $7,000 Nick?

[45:49] Ultimately at the end.

[45:50] Seven, what's 7,000?

[45:55] I think the building machine.

[45:57] Well, I think the retail price was $69.95.

[45:58] But I know now it's, you can get it for a little bit of a discounted price.

[46:03] Did they ever end up making all 100 of them so far or?

[46:06] Yeah.

[46:07] Okay.

[46:08] So again, this is tough because I don't really talk publicly a lot and this is not prepared.

[46:13] I don't know what you're going to talk about.

[46:15] So I want to kind of like, you know, definitely tow the line.

[46:17] I want to give you as much information as I can.

[46:19] Yeah, we don't have to disclose numbers.

[46:21] I mean, no one ever does.

[46:22] So don't feel bad if we.

[46:24] Yeah.

[46:25] I'm a type of guy that will disclose numbers.

[46:27] But again, I'm just just keeping my, I have no ill feelings about anything involved with

[46:31] that.

[46:32] We did it.

[46:33] I feel good about doing it.

[46:34] The game, when you look at it in the showroom, they aren't working everything's beautiful.

[46:37] Is it what we want it to be as at the price we want it to be?

[46:41] No.

[46:42] So when we go in, we want to do a deal of $39.99.

[46:44] We want it to be impressive and start moving to it.

[46:47] Got introduced to Charlie.

[46:48] We talked numbers.

[46:52] He said he would build the game for, I think, 3,800 all-in, labor, bill and materials,

[46:57] everything.

[46:58] I said, sure, fine.

[46:59] I'm just going to have to sell it for a little higher.

[47:01] We talked about $49.99.

[47:05] But keep in mind, I have royalties.

[47:07] You know, all in cost is probably $43, $40, $400 per machine, which is basically, you

[47:14] know, in line with the wholesale of cost of a stir machine somewhere in that ballpark,

[47:18] you know?

[47:19] So now we can't do $39.99.

[47:21] We can't do $34.99.

[47:23] $40, $44.99 doesn't really make it worthwhile.

[47:28] And it would became a balancing act between how many can we build and sell and what margin

[47:34] do we need to make this worthwhile venture?

[47:37] And the idea is, let's do $300 at $59.99.

[47:42] And that's what the plan was.

[47:43] And that's what we sell them for.

[47:45] I always wanted to have purple rails.

[47:48] And he says, it's got to cost more than original.

[47:50] And I said, well, can one big deal just make me some of those and I'll sell those for $64.99,

[47:55] which is exactly what we're at right now.

[47:57] The whole plan was to build $300.

[47:59] And I presented, this is where things get, you know, anyway, I don't think this involves

[48:03] NDA, but I really wanted to do multiple machines with Charlie to give him a chance to build

[48:09] his business.

[48:10] And I presented a deal to do the rest of the Jetsons games past $100.

[48:14] Because that's the only deal I had to put was that contract $100.

[48:17] We had plans for another $100, but we didn't talk numbers about what those would cost me.

[48:24] And we had Scooby-Doo and we had potentially game 3 and game 4.

[48:27] We just called them game 3, game 4.

[48:29] I think it was about 4 games.

[48:30] I said, here's the contract to build the rest of Jetsons, which is 200 games, at least 500

[48:37] Scoobies and at least 500 of these two unknown titles.

[48:39] And I'll go out and get licenses.

[48:41] I want to support your business.

[48:43] And I presented that to him.

[48:44] There was a clause in there that involved me having the ability to buy equity in his company.

[48:51] And I won't say what valuation, but it was up in the sky valuation.

[48:56] And he said, I don't want that in there.

[48:58] And I said, look, I'm not going to give you all this contract.

[49:01] I'm not going to have you build Jetsons, build Scooby-Doo, build the next two or three games

[49:06] after that.

[49:07] And at that point in time, I think it was a five year deal or something.

[49:10] At that point in time, just dropped me.

[49:13] I think the exact words that I use were, I'm not going to attach my fuel to your rocket.

[49:18] And then when I'm done, you just leave me.

[49:21] You know what I'm saying?

[49:22] If you're doing so well because of all this business that I've generated for you and

[49:26] enabled you to buy equipment and hire people, if you're doing so well and you decide you

[49:30] don't want to build for me, that's okay.

[49:32] I just want the ability to buy 40% of your company for X-Crazy valuation.

[49:36] He didn't like it.

[49:37] And I thought, well, all right, you know, let me, I just didn't want to take that risk

[49:43] of doing it.

[49:44] And at the same time, you haven't realized that I'm taking a lot of risk by doing that

[49:48] type of deal with him being a stir industry leader.

[49:51] You know, we really would be losing some of our allegiance with them by doing that.

[49:57] And so, and at the end, there was a brought the very, I've got the same time when we're

[50:01] negotiating this.

[50:02] I did get the sense that Stern may be changing their tune and I would potentially bring

[50:06] Scooby to that.

[50:07] So, I was like, well, if you don't want to do the deal and not give me right to buy equity,

[50:11] I respect that.

[50:13] I recently posted on Pensite today or yesterday or whatever the story about the investor,

[50:19] the would be investor in the Pimbal company that fell through and I'm so grateful it

[50:22] didn't.

[50:23] If it did, because I still have 100% equity and and and this is the same time I felt like,

[50:29] you know what, Charlie wants to keep his equity.

[50:31] He feels like his company is going, you know, to go to the skyrocket and I don't want

[50:37] to, you know, if he really doesn't want to promise to sell equity, I respect that.

[50:41] I'm going to look in a different direction.

[50:43] But we parted ways only building a hundred based on the fact that we couldn't do that

[50:46] deal.

[50:47] And I was fine.

[50:48] I'm like, no, let's build a hundred Jetsons.

[50:51] Let's do 75 regular, 25 purple.

[50:53] I'm going to sell them within a couple years and we'll both move on with their lives.

[50:57] And I think it was a good launching point for him to be able to invest some of that

[51:01] month into his company and it was a good thing for me to prove that we could get to the

[51:07] finish line, which means we built it.

[51:10] More or more of those got paid, Charlie got paid, we have the machines.

[51:15] They're selling.

[51:16] There's only a few left.

[51:17] And to me, that's a success.

[51:18] It would have been for failure if we couldn't sell them or something with a license caused

[51:23] me to get lawsuits or whatever.

[51:27] I'm pretty much unscathed.

[51:29] The people who have them are families.

[51:30] They love the machines.

[51:32] Beautiful.

[51:33] And in the end, it's a success toward me.

[51:36] Is there like, I think Nick, as a distributor and as a retailer, why even bother with the

[51:45] risk involved with trying to manufacture something?

[51:47] Is there somewhat of a personal desire to be the creator of a pinball game on some level?

[51:52] Yeah.

[51:53] I just thought it would be kind of a cool thing.

[51:55] Unlike projects, I like to pinball with a Chicago deal, a game or magazine.

[52:04] The amusement side of the business with Silver Ball Bar and the Family Fund Center that

[52:07] we have.

[52:08] I'm all about just doing, we only live once.

[52:11] I'm just like, let's just try it.

[52:13] Let's throw some money at that.

[52:14] Let's throw some money at that.

[52:15] When I meet a guy like Papa Duke, you never know what could happen.

[52:19] I just, I very could easily have gotten to deal with him and said, here's some money.

[52:23] Let's finish Magic Girl.

[52:24] Some of those you do, some of those you don't, it's just you just go with your gut and take

[52:29] some risk.

[52:30] I'm just having fun.

[52:32] Right.

[52:33] Speaking of taking risks, we have to talk about the pin side threads that have blown up

[52:38] over the last couple of days.

[52:40] I know someone found the WeFunMe page where you're looking to give people the opportunity

[52:45] to invest in your company.

[52:47] What are you going to hear from you?

[52:51] What is it like when you wake up one day and there's a pin side thread?

[52:54] There's an army at the gate with pitch forks making their own, very emotionally driven

[53:02] statements.

[53:03] Walk me through what it was like first hearing that it was up there and the responses

[53:07] you read and ask a little bit more about the whole thing.

[53:11] What was it like just seeing that thread pop up?

[53:16] We do, it's smart business to do regular Google searches.

[53:20] Type in the pinball company.

[53:22] Type in pinball company reviews.

[53:25] Type in things like that that you're going to see what people get if they type in my name,

[53:29] Nick Parks.

[53:30] Nick Parks pinball.

[53:31] What comes up?

[53:32] I saw like where the bottom was on my phone and there was like some threads pop up which

[53:37] is cool.

[53:38] The pin side threads get populated in Google results but it said something about GoFunMe pinball.

[53:43] It was recent.

[53:44] I'm like what?

[53:45] So I clicked on that.

[53:47] I'm not on pin side.

[53:49] I'm going to be on pin side like once or twice a week and I'll just click market and I'll

[53:53] search for a title I'm looking for.

[53:55] I'll try to work a deal with somebody to buy a pinball machine I'm looking for.

[53:58] I don't go through and read the threads.

[54:00] I really just never do unless my technicians say hey, do you see the thread about X?

[54:05] No, and I'll go look at it.

[54:07] If there's something about us I'm going to be there and if anything trying to defend

[54:10] myself and maybe help bring people to the truth regarding things.

[54:17] Ultimately in the past we've always come out unscathed so it just involves me interjecting

[54:24] and but see a hundred and twenty one posts on something about my company that I had no

[54:30] idea was being talked about on pin side.

[54:32] I was like okay what are these people saying?

[54:34] And so I read the first like ten or fifteen comments like my blood is boiling and I'm

[54:39] thinking oh my god these people just don't have a clue but at the same time I'm like okay

[54:43] how should I do something?

[54:45] Should I type something?

[54:46] No matter.

[54:47] And so I typed along thread which is what you see in the new thread I was going to post

[54:51] it there.

[54:52] I'm like you know why post it here I'll just create a new thread that I post and I

[54:57] never wanted to post it because that's not who we're going after you and I can go through

[55:01] the backstory of why we're doing what we do which is obviously it's very innocent, noble

[55:10] type thing.

[55:11] I mean most people say well that's really nice that you're doing that.

[55:13] The rest that you're allowing people who just you know have been begging you for years

[55:18] how do we invest in the pinball company to say here here's something here's a way that

[55:21] you can invest.

[55:23] That's all I'm really doing it's solving that problem and it's also generating a base

[55:29] valuation for the pinball company and when you've got people calling you having meetings

[55:33] with you saying we're interested in buying your company and maybe they make you a low

[55:38] ball offer.

[55:39] It's nice to finally have a value on a company which is really difficult to value.

[55:43] So how does it work in terms of and I was just reading some of the you know the first

[55:50] you're looking to raise $500,000 for you know giving sort of like a friends and family

[55:54] a 20% discount minimum return of 6% for the first two years.

[56:00] How do you like how do you evaluate how many shares you get.

[56:02] So say let's just say like in layman's terms Nick I have like I want to give you $50,000

[56:07] right.

[56:08] So 10% of what you're trying to raise.

[56:11] What kind of stake do I then have.

[56:15] So for while we're entertaining mergers and acquisitions or even be acquired by companies

[56:21] I won't name but as we're entertaining that and what that might look like you have to

[56:25] come up with a value someone has to give a number first.

[56:28] And so you kind of Google you know valuations for retail online retail we come up with some

[56:33] of my customers I've met with a New York Los Angeles venture capital guys and just said

[56:39] hey look here's my company here's the numbers what am I worth.

[56:43] And you know start with capital in New York some venture capital firms in LA and I say here's

[56:48] some here's some numbers that we might use and ultimately being the finance guy you know

[56:53] I look at things and I invest in things based on a discounted cash flow model so what are

[56:58] the values what are the discounted values of all the future cash flows I want to get

[57:01] about people's heads but there's there are valuation metrics and we believe today if

[57:06] someone were to buy our company today we would be worth one time sales or you know roughly

[57:12] ten times next year's earnings or something like that.

[57:15] If you look at public companies today they're trading at 15, 20, 100 times earnings those

[57:20] numbers you understand and we look at smaller private companies they don't sell at those

[57:24] multiples but still you know six, eight, ten times so maybe six times if you're not growing

[57:30] eight times if you have moderate growth and ten times if you have you know or more if you

[57:34] have great growth and coming off a year we did 50% more sales we're 50% higher in revenue

[57:42] and we doubled our bottom line I thought you know what we're a growing company so let's

[57:46] let's shoot for ten times earnings or roughly one time sales so that's where we come with

[57:50] evaluation so we honestly believe today you know given the scenario that we're in our

[57:56] future cash flows are worth around eight million dollars so we price it at ten million

[58:00] with a hundred percent history of our family so that's that's how we came to where we

[58:03] it's so basically if you invested if you invested what it was you some if you invested eighty

[58:10] thousand dollars in this offering you would own one percent of the pinball company so just

[58:15] use a map based on an eight million valuation.

[58:18] Okay and you know I look I have to say like I go to a pinball forum right to read entertaining

[58:26] things about pinball and this the thread did make my head spin with all the different people

[58:31] chiming in with all these different financial analysis of this offering and it's it's kind

[58:38] of like I don't even think like pinside is a place where you know people should go to have

[58:43] this kind of thing because I'll say this naked you didn't come on there you didn't come

[58:48] on there soliciting people to invest you're not trying to like hoodwing people with anything

[58:53] so and again it's like a free world like if you have this offering for people and they

[58:57] want to take you upon it like you're you're allowed to do that you know it's it's amazing

[59:02] to me that people almost feel like they get the you ever surprised the stuff by which people

[59:07] get angered by on pinside it's like they're angry that stern made the Beatles.

[59:15] It does I know I'm not a type of guy I'm pretty a pretty private guy I I focus my heads

[59:21] down I'm focusing on my business every day I'm focusing on my family and friends and

[59:25] doing what I can for them I'm I run a not for profit president of a charity called

[59:30] Tiger's in the Brawl which benefits local charity has spent a lot of my time doing charity

[59:34] work so I'm focusing on my ideas my life not other and if an offer comes to my table you

[59:40] know how many emails I get every day from somebody you know interested in investing this

[59:44] or you know this whatever just crazy things spend your money this way and you just you

[59:50] look at it not it's not for me and you throw away even if you think it's a scam that's

[59:54] a scam you delete it and you move on with your life I don't go and and try to hand those

[59:58] people or email them back saying how dare you try to do this and people are willing can

[01:00:03] solicit whatever they want to solicit so I'm very thrown back and it's just not you

[01:00:08] know the way that I me or the people that I know close to me that I think treat people

[01:00:14] you know and and it's just it's so it's very like shocking and then and then you kind

[01:00:20] of sit back and you just try to understand people who are that way and then it just it

[01:00:24] does come somewhat anger you how people can you know say things about you not not knowing

[01:00:32] who I am and not know it's everybody who is sat down with me in different days when

[01:00:36] in the meeting having ill feelings about me or what I might be all about once they just

[01:00:42] get to know me and hear my story where I've come from what I've been accomplished and

[01:00:47] what I do with my time and my you know my life they realize this is a good guy you know

[01:00:52] he's you know you know and and it's it's it really is the end of all of that questioning

[01:00:58] and that's why we say and I tried to when things get really really contentious is this

[01:01:02] not get personal why don't you meet me face to face or why don't you just call me on

[01:01:06] my office number maybe even myself and I'll just say just call me and and instead that

[01:01:11] with customers sometimes you customers I had a bad experience something and it's completely

[01:01:14] not our fault and and we're put to blame I'll say you know what if it's email text

[01:01:20] I'll just get on the phone let's talk let me let's let me figure out what your problem

[01:01:24] is and let's let's work towards the solution and so that's kind of where I go is my

[01:01:28] safe place is like listen I know 100% if these people sat down and had dinner with me

[01:01:34] or just had a drink with me or just had a quick talk with me that they wouldn't feel

[01:01:37] the way they do but everyone's on there so faceless they they they know they're they're

[01:01:43] not real names they don't have their pictures on there they don't know anything about me

[01:01:47] I don't know anything about them and it's just words so what they put out there I really

[01:01:51] dismiss it because I know that they would not feel that way if they knew me personally

[01:01:55] and I but I do feel compelled for some reason to try to please people and it means like

[01:02:01] let me try to straighten the world out let me just try to make sense and help people

[01:02:06] come to some clarity about what we're doing and when there's just blame blame false news

[01:02:11] out there I want to try to it's not go funny when you invest you're investing you get

[01:02:16] interest on your money and it converts to equity and you're you're just your partner

[01:02:21] even if it's a hundred dollars you're a partner and I'm going to listen to you and try to

[01:02:25] show you return on that investment that's what it is this isn't give me money so that

[01:02:30] I can do some project and so many things out there are Kickstarter programs help me build

[01:02:35] my create my book help me open this store help me you know remodel my store help me make

[01:02:41] my pinball hall of fame or pinball not not hall of fame but pinball museum bigger you know

[01:02:46] right whatever there's things out there where people are just asking for money for nothing

[01:02:52] other than just helping to support me I'm not asking for that I'm I'm not asking for

[01:02:56] people to give me money to do a pinball project to build another machine and doing that

[01:03:00] I'm all I'm asking for people who have already reached out to me in the past who have already

[01:03:05] expressed interest in what we're doing here is is hit if you're interested in here's

[01:03:09] your opportunity you probably won't get one other one for another five years so here's

[01:03:13] an opportunity and in five years ten years our company's going to do worth a lot more

[01:03:17] so do it now and this and and and that's it if you don't want to do it don't do it that's

[01:03:22] fine there's people who didn't invest in me in banks it didn't invest in when I first

[01:03:27] started there's people who didn't invest in me because they didn't think that selling

[01:03:29] come on machines would be a profitable venture and I'm like trying if the if the campaign

[01:03:34] doesn't raise the 500,000 and just goes away I pay some fees I pay some attorneys are

[01:03:39] not attorneys I yeah I pay some accounts so money to prepare some statements that for

[01:03:43] not and I go along with my life it's just it's just crazy because I mean this is just

[01:03:47] something like is is this much of what's going on in my life right so many are making

[01:03:52] a big deal out of it right well I mean look it's I I I did a little research and I called

[01:03:58] up a lot of people that I trust and I've heard nothing but positive things about you Nick

[01:04:03] so I wouldn't let the the minority if there's just a few little trolls that were trolling

[01:04:08] the thread and we all know who they are and I wouldn't worry about it I think I've had

[01:04:13] a learn to to not take it personally when you get a lot of the same people just making

[01:04:18] personal attacks on stuff they know nothing about so let me ask you a question Nick because

[01:04:22] I just to change topics a little bit so before we change topics I appreciate what you

[01:04:28] said but I also want to say for the record there are so many people who have sent me emails

[01:04:33] PMs tax of the last couple days saying look and even just posting on the thread but more

[01:04:40] people than that than actually posting people who have emailed me I saw what they posting

[01:04:45] inside they don't have a clue you're a good guy keep your eye on the prize we believe in

[01:04:49] you and that that's it's I don't need that but it is still nice to hear it kind of balances

[01:04:54] out the bad stuff I'm hearing with the good stuff I'm hearing I know that I'm you know

[01:04:59] I'm a worthwhile person to to invest in I know I'm a good piece people person I'm going

[01:05:03] to take care of people and I know that in 10 years one way or another I'm going to

[01:05:08] make good on anybody who decides to put their money with me boy it just does feel good

[01:05:13] to say that but go ahead yeah no okay so you're a retailer so you also buy games from

[01:05:18] people right yeah I want to I want to get your opinion on what you think a game is worth

[01:05:24] and you know how this hobby is because it's we've got crazy collectors who are after

[01:05:28] rare items you know Adam's family is your greatest when you're greatest selling PMO

[01:05:33] machines of all time they make 20,000 of them what if I told you that one of the three

[01:05:40] predator pinball machines assembled by skit B was possibly for sale what would you value

[01:05:47] that game at knowing the history knowing that if you own it you might be a little bit vilified

[01:05:54] but we also know that there's collectors out there that want to have rare items it would

[01:05:59] probably be worth more than if I we only built a couple of jets this prototype and it

[01:06:05] went just because of the the scandal that was involved with that in this story it's almost

[01:06:11] like something that just end up in a museum because as a as a story for how things can

[01:06:16] go bad so how do you value that for I mean maybe me even personally because you know I'm

[01:06:23] a collector too I like to buy rare things me even personally I might be willing to pay

[01:06:27] 10,000 I'm sure that there's guys have a lot more money who can sympathize with the

[01:06:32] story even more and he'll be willing to give 20,000 if you look at like King pit the original

[01:06:38] King pins and games that are super highly rare it's not ridiculous to see things built

[01:06:42] for 20, 30, 40,000 dollars but I think I would me personally I wouldn't pay even 5,000

[01:06:48] for that game but it's it's just like maybe I don't know I would really need to know

[01:06:54] the whole back story and how many of them existed and everything but it is interest it is

[01:06:59] interesting to know but it's me I highly opinionated about what things I think are worth and

[01:07:05] for me when we look at things we look at what the collector world might think it's worth

[01:07:09] and what maybe my retail consumers might think it's worth so even a game like that my

[01:07:15] retail consumers don't know what that is so there's no money to be made so it would just

[01:07:18] be me personally speculating and investing in something part of the Pimble history maybe

[01:07:22] to put at the Chicago Pimble Hall of Fame but but yeah I mean what's what are what's the

[01:07:27] asking price there is nine there's it's it's it's well as I told the owner is like it's

[01:07:33] kind of like pricing a unicorn like where do you begin and I think you're absolutely right

[01:07:38] I think to some people it's worth nothing to some people it might be worth a lot those who

[01:07:43] know the story you know some people wouldn't go near it with with a you know 10 foot stick

[01:07:48] because they don't want to be part of that negativity you know and I went through this

[01:07:51] when I owned the magic girl there is a satisfaction and a dissatisfaction with owning

[01:07:56] something that you know brought so many people paying right because Kingpin didn't bring

[01:08:00] pain it just never got made it wasn't a game that people lost money on so speaking of value

[01:08:07] Nick and this is the it been the other big story of the past month is the Beatles and and

[01:08:12] Stern's new pricing model for the game which is interesting to someone like you who's a distributor

[01:08:17] what do you think of their you know sort of three tiered model on this one where the distributors

[01:08:23] are at you know can set the price of some what arbitrary different version of the game

[01:08:30] and the platinum and the diamond like the game's not any different but what do you think

[01:08:34] like what's been what's been the response have you do you are you getting a diamond edition

[01:08:38] yeah we're getting we're getting a few oh that's not so tough what do I think of that I

[01:08:48] think it from the standpoint of Stern if I'm if I'm at Stern and for the standpoint of Kapal

[01:08:57] if I put up you know a million dollars or whatever for the license and it was limited to making

[01:09:02] X number actually there's some level of brilliance when you think about it it's actually kind of smart

[01:09:10] so what are they worth that's another question have you priced yours

[01:09:14] um I call you a morrow I price them based on what I think they're going to be worth or what I

[01:09:20] think they're worth and you know there's obviously not a whole lot of this is the first Beatles see

[01:09:24] I think about the beetle collectors and the types of customers that are out there there's more than

[01:09:29] 13 million millionaires just in the US and some of those guys might think it's cool so obviously

[01:09:35] take the cross section of millionaires take the cross section of billion Beatles fans who also

[01:09:40] think pinball school and there's easily a hundred or two hundred or maybe a thousand or more

[01:09:45] are those people so obviously how do you get to those people um and I and I feel really bad for

[01:09:51] saying something like that because obviously we want to get pinballs of the masses and we do

[01:09:55] sell to the masses but ultimately it's it's a lot easier to sell to someone who's a millionaire

[01:10:01] so think about think about um I would say I think the diamonds are worth just think that they're

[01:10:08] going to make a hundred and it's a different arc package and you think about it as a limited

[01:10:12] addition somewhere in the ballpark of and this is a big range okay 10 okay I will say anywhere

[01:10:20] between 10 uh huh five thousand and this is the reason I this is the reasoning I have it's worth

[01:10:27] 10 because the golds are selling for eight if they all if they sell for eight and it's really just

[01:10:33] a trim package and a plaque so what's that worth I don't know it's different art it say it's worth

[01:10:38] 10 I don't know if it's worth even worth that what the difference I haven't seen one personally but

[01:10:42] it is kind of a cool with the diamond stuff no the the the powder coating and stuff is really cool

[01:10:48] so let's say it's at least worth 10 let's just put a bare minimum and things going to be is worth 10

[01:10:52] then let's go to the high side and it's a hundred so what what else is there that they've made a

[01:10:57] hundred of there's there's really not a whole lot to compare to other than jess's right but that

[01:11:01] being said just because it's rare doesn't make it worth gazillion dollars we know that's the fact

[01:11:07] but it is Beatles and there's going to be a limited number and and there's enough collectors who

[01:11:11] are by when you do limited prints of art in the art world or you do limited um really anything

[01:11:18] in the collector world they do sell it a premium in collectors so I would think that there will be

[01:11:23] people who would be more in the page twenty five thousand maybe more for that but if you look at

[01:11:27] on average you know I would expect that machine to sell on average for around fifteen thousand

[01:11:32] my customer might be willing to pay twenty thousand and we'll just see what happens a second mark

[01:11:36] yeah platinum is just kind of in the middle it's kind of like the le so maybe it's worth 10 12 I don't

[01:11:41] know well let's start with the what's our with the goal is the gold worth eight and that's a question

[01:11:47] that I'm trying to figure out right now because we've got inventory coming in and we've made some

[01:11:51] sales but is it going to sell we're going to sell two thousand units at overall at eight thousand

[01:11:57] plus retail and that's something I'm I'm I'm chow I'm I'm figuring out I'm I get my gut telling

[01:12:03] is telling me that that's going to be tough that's kind of like selling um dialed in's at you know

[01:12:09] nine or ten um it's it's it's a price point that maybe slightly high for what the game is but

[01:12:16] there certainly is there's this balance of there's certainly people who will be paid that kind of

[01:12:19] money and then there's the gosh for what you get is it worth that and in terms of the complexity

[01:12:25] the game and and what they're putting into it and and the license was expensive so that plays a role

[01:12:30] so if I'm doing the project and if it's me I got the Beatles license I paid a million bucks I can

[01:12:35] only build two thousand I'm not a greedy guy so I probably would have priced the the gold edition

[01:12:40] at sixty nine ninety nine I probably would have priced the um platinum edition at maybe seventy nine

[01:12:46] or eighty nine eighty nine and maybe I think it's kind of smart um to do a hundred at whatever

[01:12:51] the distributor and give each distributor a couple I don't know I think that's kind of small

[01:12:54] but I wouldn't have priced it at eight because I when I look at when I look at it it doesn't quite

[01:13:01] match up it's it's really based on the collectibility when you long long run right I'm gonna

[01:13:08] I'm gonna ask you a question because do you sell games on eBay at all Nick or is it all through your

[01:13:13] website we've never really sold on eBay I think about a year ago we tried it we put up a store

[01:13:19] we put an inventory on there and it's still and I was not it's not up to the day but we just we

[01:13:23] thought that hey there's there's a market out there people are looking at eBay and not to say that

[01:13:27] we won't try and eBay store again but I don't sell new stirons or Jersey Jack Payne's or Chicago

[01:13:32] gaming's on eBay there's plenty of guys who will post them there um for me it almost just kind

[01:13:36] of cheapens your brand by selling on eBay I don't know why just I just feel like they're the reason

[01:13:41] I asked is I actually put up as a joke listing a a Beatles diamond for 25,000 and in the in the copy

[01:13:49] of the description it was all just jokes sort of making fun of some of the pin-side personalities and

[01:13:55] and I legitimately got a real offer for 25,000 dollars from a Beatles fan and but then he kind of

[01:14:04] freaked out because he's like well what number is it I'm a collector like I heard that only

[01:14:09] distributors have them and then yeah I was like I was like look well dude I don't it was a joke but

[01:14:14] like if you really want one I can connect you with a distributor that yeah well that's the thing

[01:14:21] it's like I honestly I think there are some people out there that will go in on that price

[01:14:26] Nick do you think you know seeing all the and and then you know we'll wrap it up in a little bit seeing

[01:14:32] all the effort that Jack puts into his games and and and he's you know everything in the kitchen

[01:14:37] sink all the engineering and then you see what Stern is able to do with their Ellie model and

[01:14:42] they sell these Ellie's at nine thousand dollars and you put it next to a Jersey Jack machine for

[01:14:48] nine thousand dollars and you can't help but feel like again Stern has figured out the right

[01:14:54] science to create enough hype and a limited number of supply on the Ellie's to really create like

[01:15:03] a feeding frenzy when they have a hot title at launch I think we're gonna see it with monsters I

[01:15:09] think you're gonna see like sold out day one and do you ever feel like why don't more people just

[01:15:16] look at what Stern does so successfully and try to emulate it versus always trying to do it differently

[01:15:25] yeah I mean Stern has years and years and years of experience but they didn't always

[01:15:31] have it figured out you know they didn't know that you can sell pinball machines for nine and

[01:15:36] ten thousand dollars until they and looked out in the market and said wow that you can and you know

[01:15:43] Stern is like any business you know at his core you you want to make a profit and so

[01:15:52] they're gonna tow that line at times and maybe you can pass the line as to what they can get or

[01:15:56] what they think they can get they put it out there you don't get it when you think look at a game

[01:15:59] like Wonelli I was very right off the bat I was with the pin siders as a joke is that the price

[01:16:05] that they're really selling this thing for you and and how much flock we got for you know Jetson's

[01:16:11] it's $59.99 compared to a game like that at a higher price it just you know for me that was like

[01:16:19] it's just an EM style game it's just you know in real scoring it's basically it was really cool

[01:16:24] you know Dennis Norman and Craig you know what they do what they did and what I thought they

[01:16:28] were continues just build these I thought I was really I was willing to support them you know I

[01:16:32] bought a Wonelli play field I bought a Wonelli back that's with the cool wood frame it's sitting

[01:16:36] in my office I'm like this is really cool guys let me buy it sign it put in my office and I was

[01:16:41] really really really disappointing when that got priced by Stern same thing for Dennis for the

[01:16:46] um the zombie pin um uh pitch and bat game I said really cool Dennis this is cool I can sell a

[01:16:53] lot of these you're gonna do really well good job um let's see what happens and then you know

[01:16:58] Valley Dynamo got their hands on it and they overpriced it maybe they're selling it I don't know I

[01:17:02] you know I know one calls me one in one but that being said I mean it's it's fair game to get

[01:17:07] a acquire license or the right so to build something and price it whatever you want but at times you

[01:17:12] miss the mark and and there's so many different factors that decide you know what that is and um

[01:17:20] but Stern does have a lot of market experience and believe me whatever happens with Beatles and

[01:17:26] whatever's happening in the past they'll use to to price monsters and everything going forward and

[01:17:31] I have without a doubt I think they're gonna be continue to be successful and and be profitable

[01:17:36] and all of that I mean if I had the money today I would be a guy who'd be like Stern how

[01:17:40] much I mean I want to buy Stern because I mean it's just I still feel like they they the brand is

[01:17:46] so good and they have missteps but ultimately I think they do bring guys like me and other

[01:17:51] guys and interestingly and and they do listen and they and they make changes and um so it's it's

[01:17:55] hard but yeah I mean if you look at it compared to Jersey Jack and on some of his games um

[01:18:02] they're going with something overly complex and super complex with LCD and all and that's a

[01:18:07] 400-some pound machine you look at these you know dialed in and um you know hobbit and part I mean

[01:18:13] wow and so yeah look him next to each other but at the same time you know Stern is a is a brand

[01:18:19] that has held up them in the the well in terms of pricing and I'm certain to support and I mean

[01:18:26] they've just proven themselves it's tough it's it's hard to like compare those two companies because

[01:18:30] it's it's it's it's two different methodologies behind what goes into the games and two different

[01:18:36] pricing strategies and um I don't know that certainly Stern doesn't want to like only make one

[01:18:42] version of a game and make it you know you know and only make 9000 more games and Jersey Jack

[01:18:47] may want to have a a tiered pricing where they have a lower model but right now they're very

[01:18:52] content being production constrained and selling high margin products um so if they only make a

[01:18:57] thousand games a year and they sell them at a huge margin because they're they're so great

[01:19:01] then then then great and I think a lot of this going to come down to licensing and you've got a

[01:19:06] lot of players coming after licenses which I think is great as a retailer you're kind of like

[01:19:10] loving oh my god Beatles is finally getting made and I'm hearing about Tory story and I'm hearing

[01:19:15] about Willie Walker and I'm hearing about all these all these rumors are coming out and I'm like

[01:19:20] make them all I want to sell them all you know when a family contacts me I want to give them like

[01:19:25] 100 choices so this is all good it's all as I kind of predicted what happened as we brought the

[01:19:30] can home consumer in his market and we and we grew it and we said yeah there is a market for home

[01:19:35] pinball here we are now where do we go from here and I think where we go from here is um a lot of

[01:19:41] things in the market at the same point it's probably going to hit a tipping point at some point

[01:19:46] and the strong companies that are well capitalized and will survive and um we'll see will we go

[01:19:53] down to one or no manufacturing I don't think so I think pinball will be alive for a long time

[01:19:57] partly because of the music business and part because the home consumers are here and which weren't

[01:20:02] here in like the 70s and 80s and you know before the last you know issue that pinball had so it

[01:20:08] is I mean that's just that's just my two cents I'm just one guy you know but that's what I think

[01:20:12] what I think you see a lot of the the landscape though because you know you're you speak to the

[01:20:17] customers and I think a lot of times too there's this misconception that pinside is the only

[01:20:24] customer base for pinball and we know that that is a very very very small

[01:20:29] portion of the people that actually buy these games and look to put pinball in their homes

[01:20:35] I think you know the industry is going to shake up in 2019 I do I think I'm super excited by

[01:20:40] the amount of games and the amount amount of manufacturers but I also think it's a climate now Nick

[01:20:45] where if your game's not good I you're in trouble because there's so much good stuff to choose from

[01:20:54] yeah you're right I think the company like like I think Stern can can have failures and jump right

[01:21:01] back in with a good license or and be fine I think Jersey Jack with the capital they have and

[01:21:06] the Abbas family behind them is in the same boat now and so I think that those companies survive

[01:21:10] in the Chicago gaming with the backbone of remakes and how great those games and just I mean

[01:21:15] proving providing such great value on those remakes at the prices that they're selling about it

[01:21:19] it's great it's crazy that they do that but they you know they're not being greedy for sure

[01:21:23] but they're doing a great job with that and the fact that they'll probably come to market with some

[01:21:28] you know licenses that are not remakes and and looking for see what they can do there

[01:21:33] and you got companies like Deep Brewed and American Pinball and hey you kind of feel like more

[01:21:38] than Marriott to a point because honestly we're at a point to where unless some things happen and

[01:21:44] we're going to do our best to to be some of those some things but the manufacturers and the

[01:21:49] amount of games being built is growing so rapidly and it very easily could outpace the growth of

[01:21:55] the consumer market or the market market or the people who would be buying those machines and

[01:22:00] every new game on the market ultimately doesn't go away like cars ultimately you know go to the

[01:22:05] junkyard most Pinball machines today that are being built today are going to be around for 10,

[01:22:10] 20, 30 years in someone's basin so they're always going to take a piece of that market and so

[01:22:14] you wonder in the end what's going to happen and it's very easy to see that you're probably not

[01:22:24] going to have five manufacturers each making 10,000 games a year you probably always have you know

[01:22:29] manufacturers that are fine making money the low price points or at the low production numbers and

[01:22:35] there's going to be companies that are always pushing and trying to go higher and higher on the balance

[01:22:39] those numbers are still going to always rise with Chicago gaming against the part where they're

[01:22:43] making five six 10,000 games a year stern wants to go higher and higher Jersey jack wants to maybe

[01:22:47] be a player on the lower price point I don't know I'm just saying if they did that would definitely

[01:22:51] bring their sales numbers up if they I mean unit numbers up if they decide to go after licenses

[01:22:56] and say they do a toy store at $59.99 and a standard cabinet I mean who they're another player

[01:23:02] I'm in deep route very ambitious goals I think they'll you know they'll do very well but then

[01:23:09] you're also hitting a market with so many choices and so would be interesting to see what their

[01:23:13] unit sales look like so at the end it's it's going to be great for a 19 so great to be in pinball

[01:23:21] so it's it's it's where we kind of thought it would be 12 years ago we thought the consumer

[01:23:26] market would grow and we kind of thought that the number of manufacturers would grow and we're

[01:23:31] very excited to have to see that happen it's more than we thought it's really it's way beyond I

[01:23:37] thought we would be I thought we'd maybe get to three strong manufacturers it seems like we could

[01:23:42] have four or five very soon that are making at least a thousand machines a year so but coming

[01:23:47] forward we came it's it's great Nick when when final question and and then we can get back to

[01:23:52] it watching I have it on mute one of the most epic football games ever the chiefs versus the

[01:23:56] Rams right now 23 23 at half time so let me ask your question because you know as we look at the

[01:24:04] new players getting into the hobby and then you're a business guy and you study marketing I work

[01:24:08] in marketing for a living I'm always so perplexed at why everyone is trying to go after the same

[01:24:14] piece of the pie at the same roughly the same price point and as you said 13 million million

[01:24:20] errors there are a lot of very wealthy collectors in this hobby that nobody's really catering or

[01:24:28] trying to make a game specifically for them why don't we have a company that comes out and says hey

[01:24:36] we're gonna make just 50 jazzes and that's it and they're gonna be fifty thousand dollars each

[01:24:42] and I bet you they could find fifty buyers immediately for a title like that and it's just again

[01:24:48] like I I've been in people's homes where it's like this is a ten million dollar home this is my

[01:24:54] three hundred thousand dollar car and if that guy's in the pinball it's nothing to him

[01:25:01] um I think that you're starting to see a hint of that I mean even if you just look at the Beatles

[01:25:11] you know thing where you've got a hundred I mean it's there but it's always package it's been

[01:25:15] packaged with the prom there and it gets the same game though neighbor eight no guy wants to

[01:25:19] pay twenty five thousand dollars and then some dude pays eight and has the same exact experience right

[01:25:24] yeah so you're so I think that if you got a license that was a dream license for me would be Michael

[01:25:32] Jackson someone just built Michael Jackson because I mean you can think of what you want but I mean

[01:25:35] the guy's music and his career and you've got such a sole and all that after Beatles I'm thinking okay

[01:25:41] finally I really am I'm saying that my life will just you know knock me out right now so stop talking

[01:25:45] about Michael Jackson but I think he would do great but let's just say you took Michael Jackson and

[01:25:50] you got the license somehow I don't know you know let's let's say the license was a thousand dollars

[01:25:56] a game and you and you made hundred of them what would that game go for you know fifty I mean it

[01:26:03] probably could go for fifty thousand just because of how big Michael Jackson is you know and

[01:26:07] or something like that and jaws I don't know like fifty thousand but I guess what you're what I'm

[01:26:12] saying is I think you will see that I think you will see that I think from the it'll be designed

[01:26:17] like Jettens but not as you know 100 because it failed to to work out but I mean I think you'll see

[01:26:23] it from the standpoint of someone will at the get go say I'm not this license and I'm rich and I'm

[01:26:28] only going to make you know fifty but I guess yeah and what I'm just like and still what

[01:26:34] forplexed me like if you look at a company like Lamborghini or Bugatti or Ferrari and this is what I'm

[01:26:39] always like like if you're going to charge fifty thousand dollars for a pinball machine don't just

[01:26:43] make it because it's limited like literally go over every element of the machine and improve the

[01:26:50] materials improve the engineering it should look like when you stand in front of a fifty thousand

[01:26:55] dollar machine like nothing you've ever seen before you know and I think what when I'm hung up on

[01:27:00] now is like and I think John Papaduk was the first person to actually try and like redesign every

[01:27:06] element of the game which sent him spiraling into bankruptcy but at least when you look at a

[01:27:10] zidware game it just had that sort of premiumness to it that yeah nothing else had at that time

[01:27:20] and and so we'll see that's always like I'm very super I'm very super impressed with what I saw

[01:27:26] with magic girl and what his plans are with also wonderland when I visited him in Chicago so

[01:27:32] so yeah there's definitely that possibility of someone coming in and really doing some really

[01:27:40] crazy innovative stuff like some early 90s games came out with some things that really turn some

[01:27:45] heads and and I and I think that that's still a potential some of the throwing LCD screens and

[01:27:50] some of the things that are being done are fine but there's not really something that is just

[01:27:53] super out there excited to see what you know some of these maybe these just aren't pinball minds

[01:27:58] maybe they're just people from other industries that had been to become pinball head pinball

[01:28:02] fans and just feel like whoa like but it's it's probably coming I mean if we can continue in the

[01:28:08] phase we're going where there's money being flowing in the pinball and somebody with the right

[01:28:11] amount of money might just say you know let's let's bring in super engineers and you know astronauts

[01:28:17] or I don't know what it's just incredible let's make them I mean right now you've seen some balls

[01:28:21] that are flying through mid-air to a box and stuff like that but maybe there's a ball that shoots

[01:28:25] in a deflect based on the design it deflects off a couple targets and ends up over here or you

[01:28:30] know there's there's just gotta be something but but that's the so those things they'll come

[01:28:34] to fruition I'm surprised that's your last question and and we're really not going to get into

[01:28:39] pinball hall of fame and what I'm that whole story but no no we have I'm not let's let's let's

[01:28:43] let I'm not we don't have to be done let's talk about the pinball hall of fame so that is your next

[01:28:48] project in Chicago right you're looking you have you found a location for it yet so yeah and

[01:28:55] and just if you allow me let me kind of reiterate the backstory that people don't know is that

[01:29:00] you know I went I very much saw a model in us having showrooms in major Marcus nationwide but

[01:29:07] those showrooms they couldn't just be like car showrooms where you just sit come by pinball machines

[01:29:13] that they had to kind of be like arcades kind of like the pinball hall hall of fame and Las Vegas

[01:29:18] and when we went there I said this could be my showroom this could be my last showroom and I

[01:29:23] and I read somewhere that Tim might be interested in selling and I went down there and I did my work

[01:29:28] I said look this is this is great of course we would probably change the lineup do more modern

[01:29:33] get rid of some ems clean this place up put it inside up you know whatever really turn this

[01:29:38] says something great and I said I want to buy it and he said yeah I'll sell it to you and he said

[01:29:42] um this is what it's worth and I say I agree and we sure can't so that is what you know I'm

[01:29:47] I'm not afraid to talk about that at this point because for two years we thought we were

[01:29:52] buying the pinball hall of fame in Las Vegas and for two years um you know we got you know

[01:29:57] he drugged his feet and would not you know sign the contract that we agreed to him we shook hands

[01:30:02] and said this is this is what we're running the pay he said sure I'll sell it to you and in

[01:30:07] in sign the contract and I'm not I'm just saying he has his reasons it's his baby as soon as he

[01:30:12] had a real buyer kind of backtrack that was running the sell and he listened to a lot of my ideas

[01:30:16] for what I was going to do with the ball of fame and he decided no I'm going to keep this and do

[01:30:20] those things myself so I mean that's fine it is what it is but people do have to understand

[01:30:24] the backstory right so that being said we still were dedicated to the model um and and we also

[01:30:32] have to decide agreement with him so while you're still waiting on being ready we'll license the name

[01:30:37] and we'll do pinball off in Chicago and so forth and he said yes he shook my hands and said well

[01:30:41] we can do that and and we were going to give two percent of the revenues at the in Chicago and

[01:30:45] never where else we went um to the salvation army and and and again he sent him the

[01:30:52] send him the documents I got back to say Lewis I I sent him the docky sign here's the agreement

[01:30:57] we talked about and he didn't sign it so now I'm thinking well gosh I was so excited about using

[01:31:01] the name and ball hall of fame Chicago but then I got to thinking he's a non-profit and what's wrong

[01:31:05] with and and we'll be a fourth profit what's wrong with calling it Chicago pinball hall of fame and

[01:31:09] our lawyers agree so we're we like that name and so we're going to go with that and really we're

[01:31:15] our goal is to have a museum arcade kind of like the pinball of famous Vegas um paid admission

[01:31:23] all that you can play pinball and it will serve as our showroom in Chicago and we want to duplicate

[01:31:27] that in other major markets and that's really where I think we're going to find a lot of growth

[01:31:31] as far as the pinball company is concerned because all those millionaires and people that we're

[01:31:35] not reaching because every all the distributors are going after the same pie and and the pie is

[01:31:39] being divided in a million pieces um we're actually interested in growing the pie and bringing

[01:31:44] people who don't even know about pinball don't even know who Stern is don't even know about

[01:31:50] Jersey Jack or any of that stuff and we're going to bring in the story of modern pinball and we're

[01:31:54] and and how we got to where we are and we're going to get them the opportunity to play um 150 modern

[01:31:59] pinball machines and hopefully they'll get the bug and want to buy one and that only helps

[01:32:03] everybody it helps the manufacturers it helps people in the community who may want to sell machines

[01:32:08] um it just it's just good for pinball as a whole it brings people to not only the hobby but to

[01:32:12] the players side of things so the ifpa more mobile people get the bug and it's just it's good for

[01:32:17] pinball along with to do this model and we're happy to be the risk takers you know to go out there and do it

[01:32:24] and I and I love what you've done with with the silver ball um bar in Columbia, Missouri if you guys

[01:32:29] haven't seen it please do a google image search of silver ball uh it is a really really cool bar

[01:32:36] Nick I mean I think I love what you don't want the place because I think that the the key is to

[01:32:40] create an environment that people also want to hang out in it's not just like only a pinball and

[01:32:46] I and I always point to like modern pinball in the york city where it's like it's kind of empty because

[01:32:51] there's nothing else to do there like there's no drinks there's no music there's no atmosphere um

[01:32:58] where sunshine much better model of having more of a social place and pinball and also the

[01:33:05] uniqueness of it being in a laundromat makes it very uh very cool like a time out in New York

[01:33:10] must see thing um so how far along are you in terms of the the Chicago pinball hall fame is

[01:33:16] is something we're gonna see a red ribbon cutting next year yeah I mean without a doubt in my mind

[01:33:21] that's my goal is to um we're working on I mean we have we've agreed to terms um we've agreed to

[01:33:27] terms um on a space um and at wood football um you know which is like one of the largest malls in

[01:33:36] the country and has 25 million visitors a year so we it's is gonna bring people the masses to

[01:33:41] be exposed to this huge um pinball thing they're gonna see the word pinball just having a billboard

[01:33:47] in an area where 25 million people and it's just what the word pinball on it is gonna be good for

[01:33:51] our industry but here's something a little more than that it's actually gonna be you know come on in

[01:33:55] and place in pinball grab a drink um and I appreciate what you said about silver ball the goal

[01:34:01] there was really to tell people who are you know in the pinball community that you know look you

[01:34:07] can roll out the red carpet you can have crystal chandeliers and high-end modern finishes and that

[01:34:11] is for you that is not just for you know a Las Vegas and nightclub people who are in the pinball

[01:34:18] world deserve to have a venue like that that is just really inviting you want to hang out it has

[01:34:23] the new modern games like Mario cards and then you know walking dead shooting game and you know

[01:34:28] those types of things as the pinball machines are kind of like up there on the pedestal up stairs

[01:34:33] all lined up beautifully and um all you know newer games and in in this places for you you know I

[01:34:40] really wanted to do I never just throwing money at it like this just make this place awesome

[01:34:44] and maybe it'll work and the place is this extremely successful and and so we're like wow okay

[01:34:50] so this can so when you when you go to the Chicago pinball if I'm in what it does open it'll have

[01:34:55] that same type of when in comparison to maybe others um museums with large collections you're

[01:35:02] going to be like wow this place is really cool it's like you know we want to do high-end finishes

[01:35:07] we wanted to look really nice in there have with me museum quality have a ton of modern pinball

[01:35:12] machines have a party room for people to book if they want to have parties have a really nice bar

[01:35:17] frozen drinks beers on tap probably local Chicago brewer craft beers on tap things like that we want

[01:35:23] and so many people have reached out there want to support us by bringing in um pinball artifacts

[01:35:28] and help create exhibits and and and you know just contribute and people who it's like a dream job

[01:35:34] they want to be the technician of the Chicago pinball affair I'm like bring it bring it the only

[01:35:39] there's one thing that I've gotten criticized from is the name and I'm going to defend myself um that

[01:35:46] that was my vision for two years thinking that I was going to be the rightful owner of that

[01:35:50] pinball affair name and I just could not back from that and I feel like you know in the end

[01:35:57] building many of these across the country our goal is you know maybe Chicago and Tex

[01:36:02] uh pardon me is uh Florida and Texas within five years and then looking at big markets like LA

[01:36:07] and and New York and probably Las Vegas too if we do Las Vegas it'll be like in the forum shops

[01:36:12] or you know one of the larger shopping centers uh right on the strip um but that'll be

[01:36:17] dependent on a lot of factors that the other ones are successful and and what we learned from those

[01:36:21] but but in the end uh I think what we're doing really truly represents a modern pinball

[01:36:27] affair and we'll have a collection of the ms and and and like I said if that's the one criticism

[01:36:32] we're gonna get then I'm gonna stand by that and uh and and and and and I think it's uh we've

[01:36:37] talked about calling it so overall museum but that's gonna use uh we talked about calling it you

[01:36:42] know the pinball company but that won't really represent what it is so um and and and and you

[01:36:48] yourself what do you think of the name Chicago pinball affair? I mean in marketing you want as little

[01:36:54] confusion as possible when you're when you're dealing with you know consumers I I think it works

[01:37:00] and and I'm excited to see it open because I do think that's so much of of introducing pinball

[01:37:06] to new generation you know it has to do with the environment because you know pinball used to be

[01:37:12] really cool like people who played pinball were cool people hung out in our cades were like cool

[01:37:18] and I think you know when you go into like and again I don't mean to be like stereotypical

[01:37:24] but when you go to some of these pinball shows like it's not that cool if you're an outside

[01:37:30] or looking in if you know if you're again because I think the environment just breeds more just like

[01:37:36] older guys that are stereotypical pinball but when you make the environment really cool you look and

[01:37:41] maybe the best way to say this is you need to do something that gets both genders in you need to do

[01:37:46] something that like kids can have a good time and you know as well it just can't be this like good old

[01:37:51] boys club and I think you know when we see the people who complain a lot about um maybe the name or

[01:37:58] this or that I think there's a lot of entitlement by the good old boy club pinball but this is

[01:38:04] the future pinball and it only grows when you introduce it to new people and you've got to make

[01:38:09] those environments more contemporary yeah I agree with you 100% and I said I really wish we would have

[01:38:16] gotten the done deal done in Las Vegas and that would have been our focuses to remodel that and turn

[01:38:20] that into something amazing and then we go to Chicago number two but it happened what it happened

[01:38:25] and you know I wish Tim luck and I wish we could still have partnered in some way but it is what it is

[01:38:33] I'm still gonna support what he's doing and recommend people go there when they're in Las Vegas and

[01:38:38] and check out because it is it is special I'm excited to see what he's done hopefully there's no

[01:38:41] hard feelings but but honestly for me um I just got glued to that name and I couldn't I couldn't

[01:38:48] get away with it because my concept well I thought really represented a pinball a fame and

[01:38:52] and then the long run if you google pinball a fame say five ten years from now the Chicago one's

[01:38:56] probably gonna come up first um because I'm a marketing guy so right right about that Las Vegas

[01:39:01] will be a forgotten but there but but certainly I'm gonna let the world know that the best place

[01:39:06] to come play pinball machines is in Chicago it or really hopefully in the country is make Chicago

[01:39:12] I'm not probably always trying to make Chicago be the best one you know what I do in other markets

[01:39:17] may not be as cool but I'm in the first one I really want to blow people away so I'll probably go

[01:39:21] the extra mile with with one money to to really deck it out and and and make it great and um

[01:39:28] you know I said I think that in the long run we need many strong manufacturers that build great

[01:39:34] games at the right prices we need shows like the Texas General Festival and the Expo and

[01:39:40] in all major markets and they need to be shows like Comic Con they really need to be big productions

[01:39:45] so we really need to let up our game and and continue to improve upon the shows and and give people

[01:39:51] low admission prices and and and and get people in there playing pinball and be excited about pinball

[01:39:57] and and I think we're in the right direction here there's so many shows and just continue to elevate

[01:40:01] the level and that will and they'll be elevated by just getting more people to those shows through

[01:40:05] promoting pinball there needs in major markets like Chicago and Dallas and in you know Denver and

[01:40:11] you know everywhere there needs to be a place where there's a you can go play a bunch of machines

[01:40:17] and and we're gonna try to play a role there and and you need to be seeing pinballs on TV shows and

[01:40:22] movies and the back right not just in the background people playing it and and it is a cool thing

[01:40:26] it needs to be a buck into that that realm of being a cool thing and pinball shows having a name

[01:40:32] for themselves and just anything we can do pinball leads being a thing you know and they are a thing

[01:40:39] which is continue whatever we can do to support pinball we're gonna continue to do because for us

[01:40:45] at this stage of our you know it's not a hundred and it's about surviving and and and making money

[01:40:50] that we can redeploy to continue to grow pinball but it's it's really about what the pinball

[01:40:56] company's legacy is and and what role we're gonna play and making all the things I just said happen

[01:41:01] and that's really what I'm gonna put my you know put my nose down and be like forget what the

[01:41:05] pen size guy says in 10 years let's look back and see what I've done and and it's not gonna be

[01:41:12] about myself I think the easiest way to summarize it Nick is bitching about stuff on pinside has

[01:41:18] never done anything to grow the hobby has never done anything to make pinball much better other

[01:41:24] than change some bad art packages but look Nick I really appreciate you taking the time I think

[01:41:29] for the people who listen to this podcast all 15 to 1700 maybe 2000 on a good night yeah yeah

[01:41:37] it's not bad um now I'm rethinking all the things I said yeah well we uh well we uh

[01:41:41] was like 10 people you know but it's cool now we um we I look I think I I speak um for a lot of

[01:41:48] people when I say that I think you're a wonderful ambassador for for pinball um I've heard nothing

[01:41:54] with good things about you that's why I wanted to come on the show and talk and and share your

[01:41:58] story um and and again like I think that your vision for how you want to grow pinball is one

[01:42:05] that all of us should be applauding because I do I I do think it's it's a wonderful hobby and as

[01:42:10] much as we argue with each other and and complain about things ultimately um I I I've had nothing

[01:42:17] but an amazing experience in seeing the way pinball can bring people together and unite people

[01:42:23] over a shared passion like pinball so we really look forward to um seeing what becomes of the

[01:42:28] Chicago pinball hall fame um and Nick and and your future ventures within pinball so I really

[01:42:34] appreciate your time well thanks for inviting in the show um we talked about all the good things

[01:42:40] and uh you know I'm so glad I I said I don't do this a whole lot I mean time is an issue um and

[01:42:47] always careful with what I put out there but hopefully I won't regret if I watch I probably

[01:42:52] won't watch it but um and it'll be here just say that there's people the people who want to learn

[01:42:57] more about just what we do and and and how to play a role um and and this I'm always open and it's

[01:43:04] one thing I am it's just always open um to to people's criticisms and and like really hearing their
