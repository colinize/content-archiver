[00:00] To me it's important that we don't just create mediocre product that we create

[00:06] you know the state of the art you know the state of the art you know the state of the

[00:10] art.

[00:12] I'm Zach many I'm Zach many I'm Zach many I'm Zach many now some of you may be

[00:19] wondering what's a Fimble topper they light up they attract different players

[00:23] whether it's at a location or in your game room and what makes this particular

[00:28] topper unique is the stern pimples advertising once hooked up this topper has

[00:33] the ability to add an extra mode within the Jurassic Park thing this is a

[00:38] Fimble product that everybody has been talking about all you've got to do to

[00:43] win this banner is to follow flipping out pinball on Facebook

[01:19] Welcome to episode 492 of Canatus Pinball Podcast, Christopher

[01:28] Franche's favorite pinball podcast and so what do we want to talk about on this

[01:33] episode of Canatus Pinball Podcast?

[01:35] We're obviously going to do a little bit of a follow up on the Jurassic Park topper

[01:40] for 600 bucks because now we finally seen it in action and the question is is it worth

[01:46] it?

[01:47] I got a little early early preview of what Jack Danger's review of Hot Wheels is

[01:53] going to be and I think it might surprise some of you out there.

[01:57] We're going to talk about some of the back and forth on social media that's been

[02:01] causing quite the stir in the pinball world because of things people have been saying

[02:07] and then we're also going to talk about Zach Sharp's continued mission to get people

[02:11] banned on Facebook which has happened again apparently over the last few days.

[02:17] All right so where should we start?

[02:18] Let's go to the Jurassic Park topper because we saw Zach many unbox this thing and so

[02:25] he put up a video last night.

[02:26] He took it out of the box he plugged it into the game and it was a lot piece of plastic

[02:31] with the dinosaurs and the logo and I will say the lighting on it is really cool.

[02:37] It's a really cool topper for 200 bucks and I think that's the part of this whole thing

[02:43] that Zach doesn't get that the apologists don't get.

[02:47] It's a cool $200 topper.

[02:49] You shouldn't have to spend $600 on this topper that looks like it's 200 bucks simply

[02:58] to unlock the mode in the game that is only unlockable with the topper and we got to see

[03:05] the mode itself and it's this goat mode in which the goat is making goat noises.

[03:10] You know it's like give me your money everybody we're going to rip you off and it's $600

[03:16] for that.

[03:17] It's also just stupid the way the mode is progressive where you light the letters up and

[03:22] it spells Jurassic Park.

[03:24] I mean if someone walks up to this game on location and sees like J.U.R. lit up they

[03:31] have no idea that it's a progressive mode they have no idea what they're supposed to

[03:36] try and do to get to that mode and it's just again it just irks me it irks me to see

[03:42] this really cheap topper and I get it it's got cool lighting effects and all but all

[03:47] this stuff is really cheap plastic and LEDs are two of the cheapest possible things you

[03:55] can do and it's like in the pinball world we think that has something lights up in a sequential

[04:00] order it's somehow now worth hundreds of dollars if you know lights in and $30 plastics

[04:07] on top of a machine it is $600 dollars I mean the components of this topper alone I

[04:14] swear to god they cost no more than 50 bucks and would have noise me about it it's a fun

[04:19] little campy mode but the fact that you have to go through this paywall to get to it is

[04:25] is absolutely the wrong direction for stern pinball and I think people have spoken loud

[04:30] and clear there's like nine pages of people articulating how disappointed they are in

[04:36] this thing so the real question now is stern going to start doing this more and more are

[04:41] they going to put a topper for Ninja Turtles that holds a mode back unless you buy the $600

[04:46] topper why not make it in $800 topper how about a thousand dollars side rails that if you buy

[04:53] it the side rails unlock something else in the game it's just a crack a crap and I mean

[04:58] that here's why for $9100 Jurassic Park Ellie should come with the topper should come

[05:06] with those modes installed in the game and I'm okay with that I'm okay that the topper triggers

[05:12] a mode and it's in the Ellie games only because for $9100 we should be getting all of this stuff

[05:19] in the game every other company out there that makes you spend $9000 plus on a game the toppers

[05:26] included and so now stern is is pulling this fast one on everybody and even though I asked

[05:32] Ed Robertson not to text me about this he did and I knew he would because Ed falls in that

[05:38] realm of like super super wealthy guy who $600 to him is like six bucks okay and some other

[05:45] people out there are in that realm but for the rest of us for the rest of us meager people

[05:49] out there that actually have to check our our our statements every month to make sure we're

[05:54] not going underwater this is a lot of money for people and they deserve to get what they pay

[05:59] for and we're already giving stern so much money so I really hope this doesn't become a trend

[06:04] with stern pinball but this is another reason why and I'm just going to be honest lately I think

[06:10] stern pinball is making moves that make it really hard to like them as a company and they need

[06:16] to stop with this stupidity because it's not that we don't like you stern it's not that people

[06:21] don't want to buy your games but when you do stuff like this you have to understand there's a

[06:26] principle to what you're doing and on principle alone I keep hearing more and more people say that's

[06:33] it I'm done with stern if stern goes this DLC route I'm done with them and you know what also

[06:40] is crazy it almost feels like they're fully comfortable having the enthusiast give up on them they

[06:47] don't really care if you have problems with them because they're just going to keep doing this and

[06:51] sell to these multi-millionaires behind the you know behind the curtain and and they don't really

[06:56] mind the fact that so many people think this is a crappy move and it's just weird to me that they're

[07:01] doing all this stuff that is just really creating bad PR for the company now speaking of bad PR

[07:08] for the company did you see what John Borg did this weekend or a few days ago he posted a

[07:14] statement that people were attributing to him but it was actually a repost of a comedians phrase

[07:20] and I want to read it to you right now and it's interesting that you know everyone is is is

[07:26] trying to share how they feel about what's going on in America and I get it and people's fuses are

[07:31] really short and people are quickly sort of like knee jerk reacting and you just got to be careful

[07:38] in this climate because everyone everyone is very sensitive and on edge right now but he wrote a

[07:44] there's a video of people looting and he wrote what a bunch of dumbasses send them to the gated

[07:51] communities and go after all of the bankers and stop stealing stuff and bothering people all right

[07:58] so like that the thing is this like this was later turned out to be a comedians line but people

[08:05] were roasting John Borg for saying that the looters should go after people in the gated community

[08:11] and the bankers and I think the irony that people were seeing in this is that who do you think buys

[08:17] pinball machines who do you think spends six to thirteen thousand dollars on these non-essential toys

[08:25] it is people of privilege it is people who live in gated communities it is people who have jobs

[08:33] in banking and it is people who have a lot of money who live in gated and walled communities I mean

[08:38] we've seen these people's houses where they have like twenty stern machines I mean John who do

[08:43] you think buys your product now look John did put up an apology and I totally understand it I even

[08:51] took down a post I made about it because it's no big deal and I've spoken to people who know John

[08:57] Borg and he's a really nice guy and he didn't mean anything by it so I also think we live in a

[09:02] society in which people just go nuts they see one thing and they go nuts and all of a sudden you're

[09:07] evil to them and they won't let you even explain why you'd said something or did something on social

[09:13] media but I also heard this that really disturbed me that Bowen Karen's over at spooky pinball

[09:20] was getting in fights with people again like it's like and I know Bowen like leans very left

[09:27] and I heard that he unfriended Robert Mooney who's one of my really good friends and one of the

[09:32] nicest guys in pinball Robert's very successful self-made man lots lots of success in Robert's

[09:40] world and he's the nicest guy and Bowen Karen's is like unfriending him and and picking fights with

[09:46] the very people that buy the products that he creates that he works on and I'm sorry they're just

[09:53] comes a point where people like Bowen need to understand if you're so disgusted by people with

[10:00] money if you're so disgusted by people that might think different than you if you're so disgusted

[10:06] by conservatives in the world who might think that their money they work hard for is theirs and you

[10:12] just are gonna blacklist anyone who doesn't think the way you think then you'd get out of pinball

[10:19] my friend because who do you think buying these products you know I don't even I can't even see

[10:23] the stuff Bowen posts because he's blocked me on Facebook too and I've always found it really

[10:29] interesting you know I'm very middle the road I'm very moderate I'm very socially liberal I am

[10:35] fiscally conservative I'm a moderate like I really am a moderate like I think Trump is a moron I do

[10:42] I don't think how anyone can defend this guy but it's but I also think that the money I work hard

[10:47] for should go to me I mean I work for it that's how I think about the world okay and I think a lot

[10:54] of people think that way too all right but when I hear when I hear like people who don't even

[10:59] want to have a discussion when I hear like the dialogue being shut down it's usually the really

[11:06] far left that doesn't even want to have a conversation with anyone they just label everyone is like

[11:11] as like right wing Nazis and it's like really really is that what you're gonna say like I even saw

[11:17] I even saw people like starting to post at like Jersey Jack might support Donald Trump so what does

[11:23] that mean Jackson evil person like you're not gonna buy Jersey Jack games anymore is this what

[11:28] it's coming down to is that we have absolutely no absolutely no tolerance for for people's beliefs

[11:35] anymore I mean isn't what we're going through trying to get to the root of that issue of having

[11:41] respect for people and opening up a dialogue and understanding each other you know nobody is 100

[11:48] percent this or that okay there's a lot of gray in why people think the way they do why they vote

[11:55] the way they do what party they'll ally themselves with and just to say like everyone over there's

[12:02] evil come on come on you you know that's not true and it's it's it's the moderates it's the people

[12:08] in the middle that make America America and you know that you know that now speaking of people in

[12:14] the middle I got into the middle of something with someone I did not expect to over the weekend as

[12:19] well it's like unbelievable this stuff just keeps following me around so I just put up a very simple

[12:26] post of a picture of my bedroom and I put up a picture of this nice white clean room and for

[12:31] those of you who think I live in an insane asylum I don't think you guys understand the concept of

[12:37] minimalism right minimalism there's nothing on that side of the room and it will be filled with

[12:43] the color of pinball and a pinball machine takes up a lot of room and I love the way a pinball

[12:50] machine pops on just an all white wall okay and also white makes a room look bigger so when you're

[12:57] living in a small one bedroom in Manhattan I'm not gonna fill this room with a ton of stuff I

[13:02] already did that just Google man builds arcade loses fiance that's my room when it was so colorful

[13:08] okay so I put up a post that said this is the future like home of Rick and Morty and guns and roses

[13:15] pinball and I get a comment from zombie Eddie Jeremy Packer that basically says something like

[13:21] what kind of Jjp discount are you getting for being involved like it was a total sassy comment

[13:29] and we went back and forth and he was saying like I worked really hard and tirelessly on ninja

[13:34] turtles and I don't like seeing my project dismissed and discredited and if you've heard me on

[13:41] this episode and many other episodes of Canadian pinball podcasts go back and listen to all of my

[13:47] ninja turtles commentary everything I've said about ninja turtles has been positive I've said

[13:54] Stern hit this game out of the park I've said the artwork which zombie Eddie worked on is phenomenal

[14:00] I've said Dwight's code is actually really good there's nothing I've said negative about this game

[14:06] so why is it why is it that when I say I'm excited to put guns and roses in my house I'm being

[14:13] criticized by zombie Eddie and we went back and forth and we worked it out but I want to say this

[14:19] I want to say this there this level and this this just goes to a bigger issue I have if you work on

[14:25] a pinball machine and you make artwork for ninja turtles and you are the coder or the designer

[14:31] it's cool if someone doesn't want to buy your game it's not dismissing the hard work you put into it

[14:38] it's not saying like that game is better than that game I didn't say anything in my Facebook

[14:44] post that said I'm putting these machines in my room and not ninja turtles and here's why I'm

[14:49] not putting ninja turtles in it wasn't anything like that at all and if if I'm going to be completely

[14:54] candid the only reason I'm not putting ninja turtles in my apartment is because I hit puberty

[15:01] at age like 12 or 13 and I haven't really thought about the ninja turtles since I was a little kid

[15:08] it's not a theme that I grew up the salvaging for it's not a dream theme for me and I'm the kind of

[15:15] guy that wants to buy like the Ellie of a game I want a game that is like a dream sort of theme for

[15:21] me or it really gives me something special and it's just not the game for me but ninja turtles

[15:26] is selling really well but this level of like entitlement and this is the thing it's like you know

[15:32] it's like you you could say oh Chris you have a platform in which you insult competitors have I

[15:38] been not fair have I have I ever insulted Jersey Jack Pimball absolutely I've insulted every

[15:44] manufacturer when I think they do things that are bone handed and I've also praised every

[15:49] manufacturer when I think they do things that are really great and that's why people listen to

[15:53] this show it's the definition of unbiased okay I am not being paid by anybody I mean he's being

[16:01] paid by Stern Pimball I get it he's working on a Stern Pimball game so what is he gonna say about

[16:08] the game but it really frustrated me because Jeremy and I like I thought we worked everything out

[16:13] and I think we have but Jeremy you need to go back and listen to the fact that I've said nothing

[16:19] but nice stuff about your game and I think people are gonna buy it and I think people are gonna be

[16:23] very happy with ninja turtles if the playfields hold up that's that's always been my only hesitation

[16:29] on that game but I also know Jeremy I also know looking at guns and roses looking at what's going

[16:36] to be in that game I just know there's gonna be more in guns and roses than it will be in ninja turtles

[16:43] and I know that if I'm a Pimball buyer why wouldn't I recommend to people out there we know that

[16:51] ninja turtles we know what it is we know what it looks like we know it's in the game we know it's

[16:55] available we know how much it costs people don't know what guns and roses is I I just happen to

[17:01] know what's in guns and roses and I think recommending to my listener that they should wait to see both

[17:08] before making up their mind is not a knock against your ninja turtles it is simply telling the

[17:15] customer out there why not just wait a month and see what it is that you might be also be

[17:23] interested in just give yourself options see stern Pimball and stern Pimball's army and their team

[17:29] over there it's like you either have to go all in at once and get on the hype train and and go

[17:35] buy every Ali before you know what the quality is and go jump into every new release without

[17:41] thinking about it twice and then go buy six hundred dollar toppers to unlock modes you should have

[17:45] got when you already spent ninety one hundred dollars I don't I just I'm getting tired of stern's

[17:51] entitlement and the fact that they feel like entitled for everyone to cheerlead everything they do

[17:57] and here's what kills me I cheerlead at this game I cheerlead at this game and they're still not

[18:03] happy and they still want to hit me up and they still want to jump into my page and tell me like

[18:08] sassy things about it and it just I don't get it what do I have to do what do I have to do I'm not

[18:14] going to tell people buy buy buy there's plenty of other there's plenty of other shills for your

[18:20] company out there and you know who they are and they'll tell you to buy everything they make because

[18:24] they make money on it I'm not making any money on any manufacturer any manufacturer that I buy

[18:31] it's my own personal opinion and that's it right so it's just like stern lately has just been on a

[18:39] just the wrong side of everything for me like they just act in this arrogant way that makes them

[18:46] feel like they could jump in my page and just tell me like I'm insulting them for saying I want

[18:51] a competitor's game it's not an insult to your product man you're going to sell way more

[18:57] in the internet turtles than probably Jack will love guns and roses because you guys will make

[19:02] more because you guys will pump them out but I am a die hard guns and roses fan that's the only

[19:06] reason why I would never put into turtles in my room over guns and roses I guns and roses is my

[19:12] favorite band of all time and you're one of the greatest artists of all time and look we did work

[19:16] it out but I just want to say you know look it's not fair to always come at people stern and

[19:23] force them to do what you want them to do and to think what you want them to think and speaking

[19:29] of this and this is really the reason why and Jeremy if you want to know the reason why I'm really

[19:33] perturbed about stern pinball and I'm not giving stern pinball the Bennett fit of the doubt

[19:37] it's because of what Zach Sharp is doing and it's because of the stern desired to censor people

[19:44] to shut them down and to limit people's voices out in the world and I read this on pinside this

[19:50] weekend some people out there who shared images of teenage mutant ninja turtles who shared the

[19:56] images early they were given these images by other people if you put up some of these images stern

[20:02] pinball has went and got people banned you know they banned my ability to share my links but my

[20:08] page is still up because I didn't really share leaked images I made up my own spoiler images but

[20:14] they've actually banned some people's ability to log into their Facebook page there's another

[20:20] pinball podcast that actually had his entire Facebook page has been removed now because of stern

[20:27] pinball and I don't know if it's stern and Zach Sharp or if it's their PR agency rebellious PR

[20:34] but I'm gonna find out who's doing this like why is Zach Sharp on a mission to go after the

[20:41] community that that buys his product and I'm sorry but I am not gonna just let this go like Zach

[20:48] Sharp's not gonna win this war against freedom of speech Zach you have to understand something if

[20:54] your images get out there they're out in the world my friend did any images of Rick and Morty

[21:00] pinball leak out into the world did anyone even know it was Rick and Morty pinball until spooky

[21:05] revealed it no because they locked it up they kept it tight and if if something did leak do you

[21:12] think Charlie's gonna go on some legal threatening battle against people no because it came from him

[21:19] so anything that leaked on Ninja Turtles is 100% Zach Sharp's fault but now people can't even

[21:26] log into their Facebook page because of him and you know what he's doing you know what they're doing

[21:31] I again I don't know if it's him a rebellious PR and again they're gonna hear from me what they're

[21:35] doing is they're quickly assaulting Facebook with three complaints they're saying to Facebook

[21:41] three times in a row like these people are abusing and creating abusive content and that's why

[21:47] Facebook is just taking the accuser's word for it and shutting people's stuff down and look I

[21:53] get it Facebook sucks for doing that there's no reason why Facebook should allow someone like Zach

[21:59] or their PR agency to shut down people's ability to share pinball content but it's happening and the

[22:05] only reason it's happening is because Zach and the marketing team over at Stern are green lighting

[22:11] this behavior and I'm just reaching a conclusion right now that is this and I don't care I don't care

[22:17] if this upsets them I don't care I just don't like what Stern's doing right now I don't like what

[22:24] they're doing with this this campaign to shut down people's ability to share images if they get

[22:29] them early I don't like this campaign to add DLC into toppers for 600 bucks I don't care to have

[22:35] their artists who's one of the most talented artists like land on my page and get upset because

[22:40] I'm gonna buy a competitors game I'm so tired of Stern the number one pinball company in the

[22:46] world acting like a bunch of babies like how many games do you guys need to sell before you're happy

[22:53] how many customers do you have to freaking fleece before you're satisfied why don't you join us

[22:59] Stern why don't you join the community why don't you actually hang out with the people that are

[23:03] buying your products and and it's just it's unbelievable to me where they're at right now and they

[23:09] haven't fixed a play field issues they haven't really bulletproof these games for the amount of

[23:13] money you're spending and watch it's gonna happen what's the next thing they're gonna add into

[23:18] the game that you're gonna have to pay extra for I mean it's at the point now where if you add

[23:22] in everything that is the way the game should be we're talking like $10,000 for like Jurassic Park

[23:29] with everything added in it almost $10,000 people wake up wake up if this game costs Stern around

[23:38] $3,500 to make and they're making $10,000 off of at least at what point do you say enough is enough

[23:47] at what point and I don't care because these multi-millionaires want to hit me up and tell me that I'm

[23:52] being a cranky baby about it come on like sorry I don't have your kind of money Ed I don't have

[23:59] your kind of money multi-millionaire in your gated communities that John Borg wants to go after

[24:05] you know we're most people are hardworking people that want to buy a game maybe once a year

[24:10] that really speaks to them most people want to buy a game where they don't have to add extra stuff

[24:16] like when did it become this whole thing of like let's remove the basic elements of the game and

[24:23] then put them back in at an extra cost the UV kit at least the UV kit was only 200 bucks like 250

[24:30] bucks and you got an apron and you got this but it was still a garbage move and now we've got

[24:35] this Jurassic Park top or another garbage move and so that's where I'm at with Stern Pimball I think

[24:41] they need to sit down I think George Gomez needs to rally his team and be like what are we doing

[24:47] here I get it you you can just you can just say oh canada's just being canada he's doing this for

[24:53] dramatic sake and he's just doing it as as Jeremy said a veiled PR campaign and this and that to

[24:58] build my audience no Jeremy there's a reason why so many people listen to this show and it's not

[25:04] because I'm here just do attack it's because I'm standing up for the people that are buying your

[25:09] products do you understand that you understand that like I will call out people when I think they

[25:14] deserve to be called out but this is a lot of money man you know that you know this is a lot of

[25:19] money I mean gosh should we give you a thing about Stern you didn't realize so you think Stern

[25:24] always wants to put everything they can into the game oh yes Stern Stern really tries hard to

[25:30] give you all the assets you want and I'm telling you right now it's a bunch of BS they aren't don't

[25:36] believe the hype do you know when they did Ghostbusters they were not going to have any of the voice

[25:41] actors from the movie they were going to get actors to make up all the voices they did not want to

[25:47] get anyone from the film in the game okay and they after a while they finally just reached out to

[25:53] Ernie Hudson and got him to do the call outs and got him to do stuff with the game now do you

[25:58] want to know how much Ernie Hudson cost to be a part of the Stern project Ernie Hudson's cost

[26:04] to be part of the game was $5,000 and a premium machine and that's it that's it $5,000 and a

[26:12] premium machine so you this notion that and break that down over the amount of games they sold

[26:18] with Ghostbusters and it's like a dollar per machine you know if they sold 5,000 machines so I'm

[26:25] just tired of being told oh yeah we couldn't put the Jeep in Jurassic Park oh yeah we couldn't put

[26:29] the movie assets in oh yeah we couldn't we couldn't we couldn't we couldn't we couldn't they can

[26:34] they don't need to because you keep buying everything they keep removing the things you want in

[26:40] the game and you buy it and it's not Stern's fault they simply are a business making a lot of

[26:46] money off of your lowered expectations of what they need to give you for you to give them your money

[26:54] and you keep doing it over and over again it really sucks because they do have the best themes

[27:00] they do have great teams over there working on this stuff and again I don't think this is a decision

[27:06] made by those people who are making the games these are decisions that are made by the bean counters

[27:11] and you know who they are all right but again Zach Sharp is not helping matters George Gomez needs to

[27:19] like reel him in a little bit Zach what are you doing why are you putting up videos and when

[27:23] you're not smiling you make it look like this thing is not fun to play I mean come on come on

[27:30] all right so what else what else is going on so I heard from Jack Danger who played Hot Wheels this

[27:36] is hot off the press now I was expecting Jack to be like yeah you know but nope Jack Danger has told

[27:42] me that Hot Wheels is American Pimball's best game to date so that's good news that's good news

[27:50] it's their best theme today and he said it's their best shooting game today he said the light

[27:55] shows amazing the game is really fun he said the game has a lot of personality he even said the

[28:01] code in it which I've sort of been like is it gonna work is it gonna work this kids show he said

[28:06] like that claymation show it adds a lot of personality to the game so more to come on this I think he

[28:13] filmed some stuff and I think he's going to stream the game but if I'm American Pimball you know

[28:19] every day that goes by where I'm not showing people this is a day in which sales are going to

[28:26] so they need to get the word out on this game sooner than later and June is when we're gonna see

[28:32] it I mean basically I'm seeing all these distributors sell the game so now like just show us the game

[28:37] just show us the game and let us make up our mind I hope one of these Hot Wheels makes its way to

[28:43] New York City soon so I can play it I still think it's gonna be a really hard title to sell I do

[28:49] and I just couldn't come out at a worse time with Ninja Turtles just being another family friendly

[28:55] theme that I think people are more attracted to even then Hot Wheels all right that's just my take on

[29:00] it from a marketing standpoint if I had to choose between Ninja Turtles and Hot Wheels in Pimball

[29:06] I would choose Ninja Turtles now that being said you know Hot Wheels I just think it needed a

[29:11] little bit more pizzazz right I just saw someone on the Sonic the Hedgehog Pimball Machine put in a loop

[29:18] so why can a home brew guy make a loop de loop in a home brew game for Sonic the Hedgehog but AP

[29:26] couldn't figure out how to put a loop de loop into Hot Wheels but let's see how the game plays

[29:30] and you know look I might change my mind it might blow us away but we'll see we'll see we're

[29:36] gonna see it real soon from dead flip and Jack Danger all right so I hope we all know what deep

[29:42] root is about in the next couple months because there are another one words like how long can they

[29:48] wait to show us stuff right there's no more pinball shows this year until the fall and I can't

[29:54] imagine that they would wait more many more months and I'm saying this and I mean this like they

[30:00] need to get Raza out before guns and roses they just do like I think guns and roses is going to be

[30:07] a huge title for Jersey Jack Ninja Turtles is a huge title for Stern it sounds like Hot Wheels is

[30:14] the is the best title so far from American Pimball Chicago gaming's got a huge cactus canyon game

[30:21] coming I hear all these big titles are coming and deep roots still in deep confusion how to

[30:28] launch this game and I think they need to stop and and either like do it or I don't know like like

[30:35] you know what I'm saying like at what point do they just say we need to reveal this stuff we need

[30:40] to take orders like Robert even if you need to take I don't I hate to say it but even if you need

[30:44] like some pre-orders just to show you the interest in the game because here's what I'm concerned

[30:49] about with them how many roses are you gonna say you're gonna make like you need to actually test

[30:56] to see what the interest is in this title like if you're a Stern you don't have to worry that people

[31:01] are gonna be in the Ninja Turtles if you're Jersey Jack you don't have to worry that you have

[31:05] people into guns and roses but if I was Robert I'd be really nervous really nervous that people

[31:13] will be into Raza like there's no Raza fan base there's no emotional connection to it and so I

[31:20] went over to Deep Ru Pimball I went over there and I actually caught a conversation between John

[31:28] and Robert Mueller happening so here's what happened when I heard John Papadu can Robert Mueller

[31:33] talking about the launch of Raza but John even if we managed to pull that off and that's saying

[31:41] something the real question is who are we selling this to same people we've been selling it to

[31:48] it in the last two years and whoever else will buy it but John if you do this you will kill the

[31:56] market for years it's over and you're selling something that you know has no value we are selling

[32:04] to willing buyers at the current fair market price so that we may survive you will never sell

[32:13] anything to any of those people ever again I understand do you do you this is it I'm telling you

[32:23] this is it
