[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] As you can hear, I've kind of lost my voice.

[00:27] I've been getting sick, but I still want to do a pinball podcast today.

[00:31] Happy day after the election, everybody.

[00:34] Some of you are happy, some of you are devastated, but you don't come to Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:39] for my political banter.

[00:41] I did want to take a moment to try to connect a little bit.

[00:44] What happened yesterday with what goes on in the pinball world and how do you get something

[00:49] so off?

[00:50] And if you were following the political world, it doesn't matter which way you voted.

[00:55] You saw a bunch of polling about how the country was feeling about each candidate.

[01:01] And you were being told every single day it was a dead heat, it was a coin toss, right?

[01:07] It was going to be the most closely contested election in history, and it was anything but

[01:12] that.

[01:13] I don't always believe in polls.

[01:14] People aren't always honest.

[01:16] Here's the common thread between last night and pinball.

[01:20] How did people get it so wrong?

[01:24] How were people so off on measuring the way people really felt and what mattered most

[01:30] to voters?

[01:31] And I want to quickly pivot that to pinball.

[01:33] How have these pinball companies gotten it so wrong when it comes to the themes that

[01:39] people want in pinball?

[01:41] And it just goes to show you it doesn't matter like how popular you think you are.

[01:47] It doesn't matter if you live in a bubble where everyone is supporting your decisions.

[01:52] What really matters is the true feeling of the target audience you need to win over.

[01:59] And when I look at pinball over the last few years, how does a company like Jersey Jack

[02:05] sign a license for Toy Story 4 and think that's what people want?

[02:12] Did they do any research?

[02:14] No.

[02:15] How does a company like Jersey Jack then go make The Godfather, a title that's not

[02:20] even a good theme for pinball?

[02:22] You should know better that if you need to make a world under glass based on a movie

[02:28] and pinball is a high energy, bright, colorful game that requires a lot of personality and

[02:35] fun, how do you land on The Godfather?

[02:39] Again, Jack Guinari living in a bubble basically just made this game for him in his inner circle

[02:47] of people in New Jersey who grew up on those mafia films and mafia TV shows.

[02:52] And guess what?

[02:53] Most people don't want it.

[02:55] How do you end up making a game about barbecuing?

[02:58] It doesn't make any sense to anybody.

[03:01] How do you land on Cuphead?

[03:03] It doesn't make a lot of sense to anybody.

[03:05] I would even argue stuff like Looney Tunes is really not what most people want.

[03:10] We definitely know Venom and games like John Wick are also games where if you just asked

[03:17] people to be honest, should we make this game, they would have told you no.

[03:22] And I think what happened yesterday in the election was very eye-opening and I think

[03:27] the last few years of pinball sales have been very eye-opening to these companies.

[03:33] That if you want to stay in business and be successful and drop a pinball product into

[03:38] the world, that's actually going to win people over and get people excited and get people

[03:44] energized.

[03:45] And I've been saying that for the longest time the last few weeks.

[03:48] I just think this hobby has failed to deliver a game that has really universally energized

[03:55] the pinball community.

[03:57] Was it going to be X-Men?

[03:58] No, because it was like not another Marvel theme.

[04:01] And then we see X-Men having all these mechanical issues and it's like, well, that's an easy

[04:05] choice now.

[04:06] I don't need another Marvel game and now you got another Marvel game and it's having quality

[04:11] control issues.

[04:12] Like, no thank you right away.

[04:14] And then you get a theme like Avatar.

[04:16] I mean, Jersey Jack's theme selection to me is mind-boggling.

[04:19] It is mind-boggling.

[04:20] And I'm just going to say this.

[04:22] If I was employed over at Jersey Jack Pinball six years ago, this company would be twice

[04:28] the size it is today.

[04:29] Twice the size.

[04:30] And if it wasn't for all the billions they have in the background, this company would

[04:34] be out of business.

[04:35] You all know this, right?

[04:37] Like if Jersey Jack had to survive under its own pinball sales merits, they'd be out of

[04:43] business like three titles ago.

[04:45] They wouldn't even have made it past the Hobbit.

[04:47] Let's be honest people.

[04:48] They wouldn't have made it past the Hobbit.

[04:50] They sure as heck would not have made it past Dialed In.

[04:53] They would not have made it past the Pirates of the Caribbean debacle.

[04:56] Everything would have sank them.

[04:58] Everything.

[04:59] I think what's frustrating to most of us out there is how easy it is.

[05:03] It is not hard to pick a pinball theme that people want.

[05:08] It is not hard to then take that theme and actually engineer a few things, not a lot,

[05:14] just a few things that translate that theme into a world under glass.

[05:20] And it is certainly not hard to find an artist to make the game look good.

[05:25] I think the hardest part in all the pinball, and I mean this, is really finding the right

[05:29] software team.

[05:31] Because I think that's the most difficult part.

[05:34] Because I think finding the right software minded people.

[05:37] And maybe it's a little bit of both.

[05:38] A designer that understands rulesets and designs his game with the journey in mind so that

[05:45] when he hands it off to his team, his software team, they're all unified in what the mission

[05:50] is with the game.

[05:52] And that's why we see such good games from Keith Elwin.

[05:55] Because he does that and that team does that.

[05:57] Do you feel like that happens at Jersey Jackets?

[06:00] Do you feel like when Mark Sidon designed Avatar, that Keith Johnson was along for the

[06:05] ride and they designed that game together and they were so excited to put the stuff into

[06:11] the game that's in the game and they were so excited for you to get to the modes in the

[06:15] game that you were going to remember forever?

[06:17] I don't get that sense at all.

[06:19] If I were to ask you right now, what's the moment?

[06:21] Right?

[06:22] Single moment in Avatar Pinball.

[06:25] Just name me one moment in Avatar Pinball that is magical.

[06:30] One moment.

[06:31] I'm just asking for one moment.

[06:32] Not a topper, not a specially dipped armor, not a play field with UV ink.

[06:37] But name me a moment in the game that you are hearing people say is incredible.

[06:43] There are moments in Elton John, right?

[06:45] When you do the Rocket Man multi-ball and when you start the wizard modes going into

[06:49] the different cities, there are moments in that game.

[06:51] I absolutely believe there are.

[06:53] But man, this hobby needs to really wake up in 2025 and I think it's going to.

[06:59] I really do.

[07:00] I think Harry Potter is going to be a day of reckoning for Jersey Jack.

[07:03] They are either going to knock it out of the park or they are going to strike out and look

[07:08] ridiculous.

[07:09] If they mess up Harry Potter, I really do think everyone's just going to be done.

[07:14] Like we're done.

[07:15] This company can keep selling its $15,000 beautiful soulless games or they're finally

[07:22] going to make a game with a soul outside of GNR.

[07:25] They're finally going to make a game where the passion comes through, where the personality

[07:29] comes through and it's on them, right?

[07:32] There's no lack of personality and soul in the Harry Potter franchise, right?

[07:36] And that's the thing.

[07:37] Like if you're going to make a pinball machine based on something people love and then you

[07:42] make a version of that IP and then they don't love it.

[07:45] I mean, raise of hands out there.

[07:47] How many of you love Toy Story so much?

[07:50] I'm raising my hand right now.

[07:52] How many of you can quote that movie?

[07:54] How many of you have so many fond memories of that film?

[07:57] How do you then go make a Toy Story pinball machine and capture none of that?

[08:02] None of that.

[08:03] That's really frustrating.

[08:05] And then if you're a stern pinball, you know, this company seems like they kind of get it

[08:09] every once in a while and then they kind of make boneheaded decisions and you know that

[08:14] stern needs to get it right.

[08:15] Like Stern's investors are not happy when a game like John Wick comes out.

[08:20] They're not happy when a game like Venom comes out and they really made some missteps.

[08:25] So I'm really confident Stern is going to course correct.

[08:30] I'm also confident that Stern is going to get the ability to make back to the future.

[08:36] I'm really hoping Stern can ink that deal with Dutch pinball.

[08:40] I think if they do, it's going to be incredible.

[08:42] And I think it's going to be the right move for Dutch and the right move for Stern.

[08:46] I think Cuphead is going to come out and I don't think it's going to be a great seller.

[08:51] And then it's going to get retired.

[08:52] That's the new thing now.

[08:53] You just start retiring titles when nobody wants them anymore.

[08:57] You know, look, let's be honest, if people wanted to buy some of the older titles that

[09:01] are in stock and in your inventory, they would.

[09:04] I think we're going to see more manufacturers follow in the footsteps of AP and put old

[09:10] inventory on sale.

[09:12] I see Jersey Jack on Facebook is trying to sell new in box toy story fours.

[09:17] Right?

[09:18] Who's going to wake up in 2024 in November and pay full retail for a toy story for a

[09:24] game that's going for like three to four to $5,000 off what it was brand new.

[09:29] And we know those games are sitting in inventory and we know there's thousands of Stern machines

[09:33] sitting in inventory.

[09:35] And so look, I just hope that everybody wakes up.

[09:39] I hope everybody politically wakes up a little bit.

[09:41] I hope everybody in the pinball world wakes up a little bit.

[09:44] It's not hard to figure out what's most important to people.

[09:48] It's not hard to figure out what's most important to pinheads.

[09:52] And look, it's not about you, especially when you run a pinball company.

[09:56] You are in servitude to the buyers, to the consumer that you need to sell your product

[10:01] to.

[10:02] And if you keep him all wants to make a game because they want to make it for themselves

[10:06] because they love that theme, that's a big risk.

[10:10] That's a big gamble.

[10:11] And if you're going to do that, then you've got to be really smart with your marketing.

[10:15] How many are we going to make?

[10:17] And is this aligned with where we think the demand is going to be?

[10:20] Look, and if you get that right, you're good.

[10:22] You're golden.

[10:23] And I think spooky is going to get that right with Evil Dead.

[10:26] I think games based on video game properties like Cuphead and Halo, I think they're really

[10:31] going to struggle to take off.

[10:33] Now stuff like Sonic the Hedgehog a little bit better, right?

[10:36] Much more mainstream, a lot more years in which people have enjoyed those properties.

[10:41] I think Sonic the Hedgehog, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Super Mario Brothers, all those are

[10:47] phenomenal themes that would sell much better than a Cuphead or a Halo.

[10:52] One of the biggest games of all time would not make for a good pinball machine.

[10:56] Grand Theft Auto.

[10:57] I don't want a Grand Theft Auto pinball machine.

[10:58] I don't want a Fortnite pinball machine.

[11:01] You got to go more nostalgic.

[11:03] You got to go into themes where it's easier to put that world under glass into the pinball

[11:07] experience.

[11:08] So I think a lot's going to shake out over the next six months.

[11:11] I really do.

[11:13] I think something's going to have to give.

[11:15] We're either going to get the themes that we need because those are the themes we want.

[11:20] Those are the themes we have conviction for.

[11:22] And we're not going to be silent about it anymore.

[11:24] I think people have been very vocal, much like last night.

[11:28] I think people have been very vocal, voting with their wallets in the pinball world.

[11:33] And the more you vote with your wallet, the more you're actually going to get change.

[11:37] Look, I've been covering this hobby for 12 years and Stern has never in that 12 year

[11:43] period sent out a survey asking people, what do you want?

[11:48] And they finally did it.

[11:49] And that came from their leadership, right?

[11:51] They don't know better than us.

[11:53] That is an omission that they don't know better than we do.

[11:56] And I think for the longest time they acted like they did and then flop after flop, thousands

[12:01] of unsold games piling up, distros getting nervous, right?

[12:05] Can't afford to do this, honey.

[12:07] I've got $150,000 in Stern premiums sitting in a warehouse.

[12:12] Tell the kids we can't take that $15,000 cruise.

[12:15] I mean, that's what's going to happen.

[12:17] And they need to start listening to their dealers more and they need to start listening

[12:21] to their distros and they need to listen to the pinball podcasters of the world because

[12:24] we're not trying to hurt these companies.

[12:27] And I think that's a really important point.

[12:30] I'm not doing this because I want to just be some angry, shock, jock pinball podcaster.

[12:37] I want to see these companies make better decisions.

[12:40] I shouldn't have to in just a few minutes be able to easily point out why a game is not

[12:46] going to sell in the current pinball market.

[12:48] They've spent two years making something.

[12:50] They have nothing but time to get it right.

[12:53] You know, when games come out, sure, we can nitpick them here and there, but I shouldn't

[12:57] be questioning why this game came out.

[12:59] I'm not questioning why they made Jaws.

[13:01] Jaws makes total sense.

[13:03] But yeah, why John Wick?

[13:05] Why Venom?

[13:06] Does it make sense to me?

[13:07] Why another Marvel pinball machine doesn't make total sense to me?

[13:11] And I think that's the thing.

[13:12] If you can't answer the why right away, why we make in Toy Story 4, man, makes no sense.

[13:19] Why we making Elton John when our buyer base would much rather have Red Hot Chili Peppers,

[13:25] Motley Crue, Nirvana, you know, Beastie Boys?

[13:29] Why are we starting here?

[13:31] Jack, I get that you love Elton.

[13:34] I get that when you were a young little spitfire, you love the Godfather and you loved Elton

[13:39] John.

[13:40] But guess what, Jack?

[13:41] We're not making games for you.

[13:43] We're making games for them.

[13:45] And I think the company that gets that right is going to win pinball.

[13:49] And we know Stern gets it right more than they get it wrong.

[13:52] But they've got some work to do because as I said, as I said, these modern games are

[13:57] hitting each and every one of us where it hurts the most in the wallet.

[14:02] Like there's no getting around the fact that a Stern LE is twice the price of a Stern Pro.

[14:09] Is X-Men LE twice as much fun as X-Men Pro?

[14:14] Does it give you twice as much in anything?

[14:16] No.

[14:17] I think everyone's waking up to that.

[14:19] Like why would you spend 13,000?

[14:22] And remember people, this is without a topper.

[14:25] A Stern game without a topper might be 14 to $15,000 fully accessorized.

[14:32] So that means with a topper, an X-Men LE potentially could be $8,500 more than an X-Men Pro.

[14:43] Just think about that for a minute.

[14:46] $8,500 more for the same exact code, same exact modes, same exact music, same exact callouts,

[14:56] same exact memories.

[14:58] You are not going to have $8,500 more memories if you go for that limited edition package.

[15:04] They need to wake up.

[15:05] An LE should have features that both the premium and pro do not have.

[15:10] An LE should have modes that no other game has.

[15:13] I want to know that my rich neighbor down the block who spent $8,500 more than I did

[15:19] is having $8,500 more fun than I am.

[15:23] And that's only going to happen if they actually start taking this stuff seriously and wake

[15:27] up and listen to us.

[15:29] Listen to the pinball community.

[15:30] Like, oh, we got to make all games the same because what will happen in the tournament

[15:34] world if there's different rulesets for the more expensive games?

[15:37] Who cares?

[15:38] Who cares?

[15:39] Those tournament players aren't buying LEs.

[15:41] Why are you catering to them?

[15:42] They're not even buying the damn pros.

[15:44] They're not even buying new and box games.

[15:47] Why are you catering so much to the army out there that's not making you any money?

[15:52] The operators are your customers, not the tournament players.

[15:55] Oh, man, it's a whole new world.

[15:57] It's a beautiful day here in Roedon, Connecticut.

[16:00] It's nothing but blue in this state, but I always notice this about these neighborhoods,

[16:03] right?

[16:04] It's easy to virtual signal your political beliefs.

[16:08] But I have a hard time feeling like these super wealthy people are really devastated

[16:12] as most of them will be at the bar tonight having a lobster roll and a martini, right?

[16:18] Right?

[16:19] They're devastated.

[16:20] How can they go on?

[16:21] America's ruined as I'm on my yacht eating lobster rolls.

[16:24] Okay, sure.

[16:25] But as I always say, I'm very moderate.

[16:27] I think you need to be respectful.

[16:28] I think division is a bad thing.

[16:30] I think there's more that unites us than divides us absolutely.

[16:34] I think the same is true in pinball.

[16:37] I think we all want the same stuff, right?

[16:39] We want games to be affordable.

[16:41] We want them to be magical.

[16:42] We want them to be great themes.

[16:44] We want them to have creativity and innovation in them.

[16:48] And we want some variety.

[16:49] I'm so tired of the same selections over and over again, because if you're going to keep

[16:54] doing that, I'll just go buy the older games for so much cheaper and not even waste any

[17:00] money opening a cardboard box.

[17:03] Everybody get through today.

[17:05] It's going to get better if you're in pain.

[17:07] And if you are happy with the outcome, don't be too boastful.

[17:10] Be respectful.

[17:11] Just do the right thing.

[17:12] Always show people the kind of respect that you want to be shown.

[17:16] Everybody have a great day.

[17:17] I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again.

[17:22] But baby, baby, something's telling me this ain't over yet.

[17:27] No way it was our last night.

[17:30] No way it was our last night.
