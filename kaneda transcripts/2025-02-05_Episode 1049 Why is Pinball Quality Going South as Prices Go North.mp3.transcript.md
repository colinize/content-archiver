[00:00] I think I'll take my whiskey leak.

[00:05] I caught me back in my bed at three.

[00:09] You're too sweet for me.

[00:12] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:16] Ah, good morning everybody.

[00:18] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:20] How's everybody doing?

[00:22] What's happening in the world of pinball?

[00:24] It seems like the one word that is on everybody's mind right now

[00:29] is quality.

[00:30] The quality of these games as they arrive into people's homes, we're all watching very

[00:36] closely.

[00:37] There's quality issues now with Dungeons and Dragons.

[00:41] There's some quality issues with Evil Dead.

[00:44] There's quality issues with Pulp Fiction.

[00:47] And as we're spending this much money on these games and the games come into your home, really

[00:52] making sure that the quality piece of manufacturing is really important.

[00:59] And let's talk about that on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:02] And let's also just talk about some other stuff I didn't cover off on my last show.

[01:07] There's a hundred more Galactic Tank Force games coming out in the world.

[01:12] I don't know who wants any of those.

[01:14] There's now more sale prices happening for games like Toy Story 4.

[01:19] Let's just go around and talk about all this stuff right now.

[01:22] How does that sound, everybody?

[01:24] So look, let's start with this American Pinball.

[01:28] This company, again, seemingly is in this weird place.

[01:32] I saw that David Fix just did a new interview.

[01:35] I haven't listened to it.

[01:36] I'm not going to listen to it because I don't really care to listen to it.

[01:41] But someone summarized everything he said in it.

[01:44] And there's a lot of talk about torturous interference.

[01:48] If he signed an NDA with American Pinball, is Mukesh going to be mad?

[01:53] I don't really care about that.

[01:54] I think Mukesh is now at a place where he's either going to hire a new leader and bring

[02:01] new pinball machines to market, or he's going to stop making pinball machines.

[02:06] I don't think this company is going to turn into a contract manufacturing company that

[02:12] does not design its own product.

[02:15] And I think there's just so many pinball companies executing properly that we just don't need

[02:22] another.

[02:23] It is sort of shocking to me over the last three to four years.

[02:27] We really haven't seen many pinball companies fail.

[02:30] And there's like 13 of them, and we don't need that.

[02:33] So apparently in this interview, they said they're working on galactic tank force code.

[02:40] The team's been working on it, maybe pro bono, and post layoffs as a homage to Lyman

[02:47] Sheets.

[02:48] Okay, for the record, Lyman Sheets made some of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[02:54] His name should be nowhere near this game.

[02:58] There's absolutely nothing about Lyman Sheets' name that is going to get honored by galactic

[03:05] freaking tank force.

[03:07] This is actually disrespectful for Lyman Sheets, if you ask me, to sort of put his name or say

[03:14] that you're doing this for him.

[03:16] He would not go anywhere near this game.

[03:20] We also know that they're going to make a hundred classic editions of galactic tank force that

[03:27] are removing stuff from the game, like the lighting on the side, the Martian doesn't

[03:33] pop out of the tank, and it's $7,995 for like a stripped down version of the game.

[03:43] And they're only making a hundred, but here's the problem.

[03:47] You can go get a GTF limited edition with all the bells and whistles and the tank wheels

[03:54] and all that stuff.

[03:56] You can get the game the way it was intended to be for $8,000.

[04:03] The answer is nobody.

[04:05] They're just trying to clean out their inventory, but if you ask me, if you're trying to move

[04:09] these stripped down GTFs, you got to be looking at a price like $4,995, not $8,000.

[04:18] Nobody's buying these games.

[04:19] Some more news from this interview.

[04:21] He said he's not sure if Game 7 will come out, but he deserves one for free.

[04:26] Alright, he announced that the mechanical engineer and developer from American now work

[04:31] for other pinball companies.

[04:33] Ametron started shopping the company at the end of 2023, so he's now admitting that this

[04:39] company was for sale, which is what we've been saying all along.

[04:44] He claims to have sold more barbecue challenges than hot wheels in the first year in quotes.

[04:51] Unclear what that means.

[04:52] IPO resulted in less support as upper management was focused on that.

[04:58] It's all this finger pointing.

[04:59] I'm not going to go through the rest of it, but it's all this finger pointing at Mukesh.

[05:04] And this is not surprising.

[05:05] It's like the people who were in charge of making the decisions seemingly don't want

[05:10] to take accountability and responsibility for the financial reaction the community had

[05:16] to games like Barrios' barbecue challenge, to games like Galactic Tank Force.

[05:22] And so look, I don't want to give any more airtime to this.

[05:24] You know how I feel.

[05:26] They came at me personally as well, so I don't even want to discuss it.

[05:31] Everybody's to blame.

[05:32] The media are to blame.

[05:33] Canada's to blame.

[05:34] It's Mukesh's fault.

[05:35] It's the IPO's fault.

[05:37] It's Dennis Norman's fault.

[05:38] It's everybody's fault except for the leadership team who had the reins over at American Pinball.

[05:45] So we shall see what the future holds for that company.

[05:48] It's not looking great.

[05:51] Speaking of not great.

[05:53] Even if you spent $12,000 on a Toy Story 4 LE and now you're looking at Jersey Jack

[06:00] themselves is offering the game with a topper for basically $9,999.

[06:08] We're seeing now manufacturers putting their own product on sale.

[06:14] And I think we're going to see more of this.

[06:17] What we're not seeing is anybody lower prices.

[06:20] What is the big question mark I have is how long are we going to see these games lose

[06:26] so much money on the second hand market to the point now where manufacturers are going

[06:31] against their own map pricing and they're basically now destroying the second hand value

[06:37] of their own product.

[06:39] So everybody out there that now owns a Toy Story 4 LE, you know your game is worth more

[06:44] like $8,000.

[06:46] If that you can go get a CE for like 10 which is a $5,000 saving.

[06:51] So it's just kind of brutal but it's also just kind of indicative of where we're at.

[06:57] And I don't know if anyone's going to wake up and like realize that you can't charge

[07:01] this much for every single game.

[07:03] And the entire hobby is overpriced and it's happening everywhere.

[07:08] And I know that there are certain people out there.

[07:10] I got a really nice note from Ed Robertson.

[07:12] He's like Chris, hopefully while you're sick you're going to reflect on what this hobby

[07:17] is all about and what Pimball is all about.

[07:19] It's about having fun.

[07:20] And Ed, you're not wrong.

[07:22] Like I 100% agree with you.

[07:24] These things are toys meant to give us pleasure.

[07:27] They're about having fun, their amusement devices.

[07:31] But the problem Ed is for most people out there, they also have to think about like if

[07:38] I'm going to have fun I would rather have $12,000 fun for $8,000.

[07:45] That's the reality Ed is like if you're going to buy something for $12 that is then going

[07:49] to be worth $8,000 in just a year.

[07:52] Isn't it more fun to have the same exact experience for so much less money?

[07:58] And we've all been in this hobby for a long time now.

[08:00] Most of you who are listening, it was never like that.

[08:03] You never bought a game and lost $4,000 in a year.

[08:07] You never bought a James Bond 60th and lost like $10,000.

[08:11] You never bought an Elvira like Blood Kiss Edition and lost $3,000 instantly.

[08:16] You never bought these games and watched other people's ability to buy the same exact game

[08:22] for 30% less money in less than a year.

[08:26] And I know this isn't a conversation that a lot of people want to have that are friends

[08:31] with the manufacturers.

[08:33] I know these companies are spending a lot more money than they used to have to spend

[08:37] to make the product.

[08:38] But the problem is they all significantly overstepped.

[08:42] And the stuff we're paying for isn't exactly what's in the game itself.

[08:47] We're paying for bigger factories.

[08:49] We're paying for like a lot more employees at these companies that might not even be

[08:53] necessary to get a pinball machine into a box and to us.

[08:58] So I just think we're going to see more of this.

[09:00] The good news is Harry Potter is going to buck the trend.

[09:03] Harry Potter and King Kong are going to buck the trend.

[09:06] They're going to be the two games that make comments like I just made seem a little bit

[09:11] off because you're going to see two titles that are going to hold value.

[09:16] You're going to see games sell out instantly on day one, even though the price tag is going

[09:22] to be really high.

[09:23] And it's going to be FOMO day.

[09:25] It is like there's going to be FOMO around King Kong and Harry Potter.

[09:30] Everything else, absolutely no FOMO.

[09:33] Everything else, there was no reason to buy right away.

[09:35] You all know this.

[09:36] All right.

[09:37] So we've got Toy Story on sale.

[09:39] Godfather I think has been on sale.

[09:42] Elton John is going to be the next game that goes on sale because we know that there's

[09:46] Elton John Platinum's sitting in boxes all over the place.

[09:50] Like the game is still not even sold out.

[09:53] And speaking of not sold out like Avatar CE is not sold out.

[09:57] Dungeons and Dragons, Ellie.

[09:59] I was looking at that today.

[10:00] That's not sold out.

[10:01] And so let's talk about D&D.

[10:03] This is one of the big ones.

[10:05] This is one of the big things because everyone's really excited about this D&D game.

[10:10] The mechanism in it is really cool.

[10:13] And now it seems there's an issue with the mech.

[10:17] And it's not the mech itself.

[10:18] It's node board number 10.

[10:21] And something's happening with the wiring between the mechanism itself and that node board.

[10:28] And when the wire gets pulled and twisted, it's causing like intermittent signals to

[10:34] go to the node board, which can short it out.

[10:38] And I think the same thing happened with Rush Pimbal.

[10:41] And so now we've got the Ellie owners, the first 100 or so that are getting their product

[10:48] are really nervous about playing the game.

[10:50] I saw a guy just unboxed his Ellie and he's like, it's beautiful.

[10:55] I love it.

[10:56] I'm not going to play it until Stern figures out a fix for node board number 10.

[11:01] Because if your game goes down and node board number 10 goes down, you really don't have

[11:05] a game.

[11:06] You've got a $13,000 paperweight.

[11:09] But it does beg the question.

[11:10] So clearly there was some manufacturing issue between the prototype of that cable and the

[11:16] final production version of it.

[11:19] And Stern Pimbal wasn't able to test the final version of that cable and the node board in

[11:25] the game and has passed that on to customers without proper testing.

[11:31] And so then $13,000 new inbox Ellie buyers are the new guinea pigs on a game.

[11:39] And so that's not good.

[11:41] It's not good.

[11:42] We're not asking for Stern to put 500 plays on a game, but they should at least when they

[11:48] get the final version of everything, the final cables, the final node board, they should

[11:54] at least have like five test rigs that are all built with the final products and at least

[12:01] put those games through a few thousand hours of testing before you start mailing games

[12:09] to customers.

[12:11] That's not happening.

[12:13] And they're boxing up these games and they're going out the door before these issues even

[12:18] have a chance of being identified at the Stern factory.

[12:23] And again, the learning here is just don't buy right away.

[12:27] Unless you absolutely need to buy these games right away.

[12:31] Why would you want to be a guinea pig like this?

[12:35] Is the solve going to be easy?

[12:38] Do they have to redesign a node board?

[12:41] That doesn't seem like an easy fix.

[12:43] Are they going to have to wait for these cables to be remade?

[12:46] That might not be something that can happen in weeks.

[12:49] It might take a month.

[12:51] I don't know what the fix is and neither do you.

[12:54] What I do know is that people just spent $13,000 on a pinball machine and I go into the thread

[13:01] and the entire conversation is troubleshooting this issue.

[13:06] We're not talking about the updated dungeon maps every Sunday.

[13:10] We're not talking about the code.

[13:11] We're not talking about the layout.

[13:13] We're not talking about the shots.

[13:14] We're talking about a quality control issue.

[13:19] And we saw what happened with X-Men when quality starts to become the conversation on day one.

[13:25] All hype for the game dies instantly because nobody wants a headache.

[13:29] That's the thing, right?

[13:30] It's like for this much money, the last thing you want to do is buy a headache.

[13:34] And if I were an Ellie buyer right now, I would have been like,

[13:37] I would feel stupid because you should have listened to Canada because there are still

[13:41] Ellie's for sale new in box, which means yours is worth much less than $13,000 instantly.

[13:48] And now that there is an issue with the game, guess where the price is going to go?

[13:52] South.

[13:53] And after going through what people went through with the uncanny X-Men fixes,

[13:58] I think people's confidence in Stern to fix these issues quickly has eroded a bit.

[14:05] And it's not just Stern pinball people.

[14:07] I'm over in the Pulp Fiction thread and I see owners there just issues with the lockdown bar.

[14:14] There's nothing more annoying than a lockdown bar that doesn't work right.

[14:18] Then you've got the glass doesn't slide into the machine properly.

[14:22] You've got people spending $10,000 on a pinball machine and they have to take black duct tape

[14:29] and duct tape the corners of the glass to get the glass to stay in the machine and not slide down

[14:35] and hit the lockdown bar.

[14:37] Really?

[14:38] They've had two years to figure out these issues.

[14:41] And these are brand new Ellie owners that are saying,

[14:44] I've had the same issue with my SE version of Pulp Fiction.

[14:49] They did nothing to fix the problem.

[14:52] And then I'm seeing new Ellie owners and they're having issues with the topper on the game.

[14:57] It's not sitting flush on the back box.

[15:00] And that's annoying.

[15:01] It's like you need two people to press down the topper and force it into place.

[15:07] If there's one thing you don't want to do on any pinball machine when you're working on something,

[15:13] is use the word force.

[15:15] You have to use force to get it to sit right.

[15:18] No, that's not how it should be.

[15:20] How can you have two years to design this thing and you can't get the topper to be installed in the right way?

[15:28] And then I'm watching Don play his evil dead and he's got to take the glass off and use his thumb

[15:34] to activate the ball trough in the game.

[15:37] Spooky Luke was on the chat saying maybe he said it at the wrong height.

[15:41] But man, it's like brand new games, brand new games left and right.

[15:45] No matter where you turn, there's issues.

[15:47] And look, we all know this pinball has always been a thing where it's not unheard of where you have to pop the hood and make a few adjustments on your game.

[15:57] But some of this stuff is not like adjustments.

[15:59] It's just engineering mistakes.

[16:01] And that's not something you should have to do.

[16:04] What I'm calling for in this hobby is a lot more quality control.

[16:10] And I mean that.

[16:11] And I mean quality control on the final production version of the games.

[16:16] I think we're getting a lot of quality control with the prototypes,

[16:20] but then they get the final version of stuff in, whether it's node boards or cables or toppers.

[16:25] And the final production version hasn't gone through adequate quality control testing.

[16:32] And I don't think any of our games get really tested people.

[16:35] And the reason why is nobody wants a damn dimple on the game.

[16:39] So your game is probably not played at all before it goes into a box and it goes to you because they care more about you seeing that unmalested play field.

[16:50] Then making sure your game has everything hooked up right to make sure everything's operating properly.

[16:57] And if it's not, you've now got a beautiful clean play field and a $10,000 paperweight because the game doesn't work right.

[17:06] I think quality is going to be one of the number one things people look for moving forward.

[17:11] I think there are some games that are problematic.

[17:14] I think there are some games that can't be fixed on Kani X-Men.

[17:17] Anybody?

[17:17] I think what's going to happen is the games that have good quality, that are easy to service, that don't have many service issues,

[17:26] are going to be the games that people want.

[17:29] And hey, here's a little unspoken truth that we all know.

[17:32] There's a reason why Jersey Jack yanked so many toys out of its games because they wanted to make their games more reliable so they just took out toys and mechs.

[17:44] Like that's the easiest way to make a game pretty bulletproof.

[17:48] You don't have much in it.

[17:49] But the problem in this hobby now is simply this.

[17:52] For this much money, the games need to be loaded.

[17:55] And when you spend this much money, you expect great quality.

[17:59] So we're at a point now where these companies need to be firing on all cylinders.

[18:04] They need great themes.

[18:06] They need good quality product.

[18:08] And they need a lot of mechs and toys to justify the price.

[18:12] And if you don't deliver that, I think everyone's just going to wait on the sideline until a game like that comes out.

[18:18] I think this year is going to be a year defined by that.

[18:21] I think it's going to be a year defined by are these games delivering enough magic for how much they cost and is that magic engineered in a way that it's going to hold up over time?

[18:34] I know there's a lot of people looking at the older games, the older products, right on Sam platform, much more reliable, maybe.

[18:43] Maybe not as easy to work on, but those things were built to last.

[18:47] These companies are aiming towards efficiencies in manufacturing, not necessarily the best quality or the best bulletproof system.

[18:55] Just what's a cheaper way to make the product?

[18:58] How is it cheaper to pop in and out?

[18:59] No boards.

[19:01] So my advice to everybody is this, unless a game is something you absolutely need to buy the first month it's out.

[19:09] Just wait.

[19:11] Just wait.

[19:13] You are not going to have a hard time getting anything.

[19:16] Here's the truth.

[19:17] If you want a D&D LE and they are sitting still new in box and these issues now have popped up, by the time they fix it, by the time the game gets corrected, trust me, D&D LE within six months is going to be a $10,000 game.

[19:35] $10,000 game.

[19:37] And I mean you're going to be able to find these things probably in a box for 10 grand.

[19:41] So why would you need it now?

[19:43] If you have it now, you're nervous.

[19:45] You're anxious.

[19:46] The guy who didn't buy it, he's not anxious at all.

[19:49] And if it turns out to be a Brian Eddy masterpiece, great.

[19:52] He's going to be able to march in and get it for $3,000 off.

[19:56] Smart man.

[19:57] I don't even want to bring up like all my friends who bought X-Men LEs right away.

[20:01] Those guys are in a whole new hell.

[20:03] And my friends who bought like Godfather's CE, they won't even talk to me anymore.

[20:06] They won't even talk to me anymore.

[20:08] They've lost $5,000 to $6,000.

[20:10] There's not even a way to justify that they had that much fun.

[20:13] It's not.

[20:13] It does nothing fun about losing $5,000 to $6,000.

[20:16] And look, it'd be very convenient if we stopped approaching this hobby this way.

[20:20] But we're not.

[20:21] We're not.

[20:22] Because this is the story.

[20:24] This is the story of our time.

[20:26] Pimball is the most expensive it's ever been.

[20:29] The quality is questionable, even from companies that used to be rock solid.

[20:34] Like CGC quality used to be amazing.

[20:37] Now it's crap.

[20:38] People's decals are peeling off their pulp fictions.

[20:40] Their decals are peeling off the front.

[20:43] Have you ever tried to replace decals on a cabinet?

[20:45] It's not easy.

[20:47] But how did it go out the door?

[20:48] Right?

[20:49] Lazy day at the factory.

[20:50] Someone decided not to apply the decal in the right way and nobody looked at that and

[20:55] said you didn't do this right.

[20:57] We can't ship this to a customer like this.

[20:59] Redo it.

[20:59] No, nobody's doing that.

[21:01] So the games are the most expensive.

[21:03] The quality is going downhill.

[21:06] There's not as many toys in the games anymore.

[21:08] I mean, guys, you can't paint a picture that's any more clear than this.

[21:13] It's time to just wait.

[21:15] No buy 2025.

[21:17] Trust me.

[21:18] If you adopt the No Buy 2025, you're going to be able to buy everything at the end of

[21:23] the year for so much cheaper and you're going to be able to get whatever you want for such

[21:27] savings.

[21:27] And look, I know this might not apply to Harry Potter and King Kong.

[21:31] We're not going to see back to the future this year.

[21:34] So Harry Potter and King Kong are the only games that I think are going to be immune

[21:39] to the forces that are going to make every other game lose so much value this year.

[21:43] Everybody, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[21:45] Thank you for being a member.

[21:46] Get some friends here.

[21:48] We're sliding into like 705.

[21:51] Like what?

[21:51] We were supposed to get to 800.

[21:53] What do I need to do?

[21:54] Everybody, come on.

[21:55] Let's do this.

[21:56] Canada out.
