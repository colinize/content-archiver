[00:00] Ah, alright, we're live. Sorry for the delay, there was just like a weird, like copyright

[00:12] infraction on one of my predator videos. I wonder if someone's trying to silence

[00:17] Canada. Let's see here. Let's invite some people, share, copy link. Ah, you know, we're

[00:29] gonna talk all about predator. We're gonna talk all about the other games going on. We live.

[00:37] Let's just get this here. Ah, you know, lots going on, right? Every week it feels like just

[00:52] one there's no news. There's a lot of news. And doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

[01:00] do copyright infringement. Yeah, I just got a copyright infringement on one of my YouTube

[01:09] lives for predator. Now, I think you have to like complain. I'm wondering if the Pimbal Brothers

[01:20] are trying to get this channel shut down. I don't think so. Well, you know, good luck. Good

[01:27] luck. What's up, Brian? What's up, Joe? What's up, gentlemen? Here we are in the garage of

[01:35] Canada talking about Pimbal. Ah, you know, I will say this, I will say this. I, I think,

[01:46] I think the battle lines are drawn. I, I do. I, I think the companies that are executing right.

[01:59] If you ask me right now, spooky Pimbal, Jersey Jack Pimbal,

[02:04] Stern Pimbal, after that, barrels, they're getting games out, you know, not as many as they should be.

[02:23] But man, it feels like that's kind of like, those are the big guys now. Chicago gaming company,

[02:29] I guess they're getting out. I don't know, the Pope fiction seem like they're done with the

[02:34] Pope run, but I don't really see any medieval madness. Merlin editions going out. Does anyone see

[02:39] those games? I, we don't even talk about those games. What's up, Dana? What's up Todd?

[02:46] You want to hear my Arnold impersonation? I'll do it later. It's like, I, I don't even understand

[02:55] what they do now to get. I know they just put up another gameplay video. It's even less exciting.

[03:05] I, I don't know what's, I don't know. I, I just don't think you can make Predator without Arnold.

[03:10] We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about Harry Potter. We're going to talk about

[03:15] X-Men, man. It's like a whole new game. Mike Vinicore is like, change in the entire game now.

[03:24] And what's good about X-Men now is they're totally going to listen to feedback and kind of

[03:32] build this a little bit with the community input, which is good. They're, they're adding a lot

[03:38] of stuff, people like they're taking away some stuff, though, that people also like, people really

[03:43] like the Sentinel hand, stopping the ball and breaking the ramps. I think they took that away.

[03:49] At some point in the game, then people don't like removing that. So I think we're going to see

[03:55] Stern Pimbal really, you know, I like the, I like the verbiage from Stern right now. It's like

[04:02] what you're seeing is the first in what will be a series of major updates for this game.

[04:10] So yeah, X-Men coming back.

[04:20] Here's my take on what is it June 28th? Are we going to see JAWS 50th next week?

[04:29] Maybe, right? Harry Potter's are landing. I still don't, don't, I don't know. Does anyone here

[04:38] have a Harry Potter CE yet? Does anyone on the chat right now have a Harry Potter?

[04:51] Yeah, I think, you know, we're going to let people come in the door over the next couple minutes,

[04:55] then we'll get into the stuff gang. But yeah, and it's, it's getting to the point now where if you

[05:01] don't have a great launch of a game, you know, you can't really recover like you used to,

[05:07] like the slow burn world of Pimbal buying for this much money. It's over, like it's over.

[05:15] Todd's waiting on his CE. Okay. Has anyone streamed the game recently? Like, is there,

[05:25] is there someone streaming the new code? Let me, let's see if we can find that. Hold on a second.

[05:29] I'm going to see if I can find that on YouTube so we can watch a little bit of Harry Potter

[05:35] Pimbal. Let's see.

[05:48] Nine days ago, two weeks ago, six days ago,

[05:56] is the six days ago the new code five days ago?

[06:09] What would have the new code two days ago?

[06:18] Oh my god, the Kong R Us guy's still doing it.

[06:21] I mean, he's only getting, like he's kind of, he's only getting a thousand views on an Eric

[06:29] interview. All right, let's do this. Let's do, I would assume that five days ago would be

[06:43] the latest code. Let's see what these guys are doing.

[06:52] You know, it's too loud this one. Let's see if Joel, I think Joel's got a stream holding

[06:58] game just finding us. All right, let's see.

[07:21] I don't know. I just, no, I don't want to, I don't want to watch a stream right now. Sorry.

[07:37] All right. Are there arcade editions on the line? Does anyone know? Like what's the,

[07:44] what's the latest? So down south Pimbal, I'm just curious.

[07:48] Since you have a Harry Potter at home, have they made the movie modes more meaningful,

[07:54] more impactful? I mean, to me, like that's where this game is going to either be a great game or,

[08:02] or like, you know, a fun game to shoot, but kind of sterile in connecting with the Potter movies.

[08:10] So I'm just curious, since you have one, what it's been like with Harry Potter at home,

[08:17] because I still don't see them really making it feel like the movie modes are really

[08:25] significantly changing the vibe of the game. You kind of start a movie and it's just no matter what,

[08:32] if you hit the shots or not, it doesn't matter. It times out and it goes into the next scene and

[08:36] then into the next scene. We're going to talk about the new Stern toppers. Don't worry. Don't worry.

[08:44] I can't, I actually got it wrong. It's $400 just for the base of that top. And then the Stern

[08:50] logo is another $100 for that flat plastic logo. The world's crazy people. We're going to see the

[08:58] new Formula One movie in IMAX tomorrow. Four tickets are $133 for four movie tickets, $133. No

[09:10] one or people don't go to the movies anymore. I didn't have a problem with the movie mode before.

[09:17] It's still fine. Okay. I mean, I, I don't know, man, then I down south. Then I just feel like the game

[09:25] is like, it's kind of like just getting through the multi balls then. Like that's kind of it.

[09:32] I don't know. I don't know. What's your overall opinion about Potter?

[09:43] All right. Let's do this. Let's get some, let's get some focus here,

[09:47] Canada on this Saturday morning's spectacular. Let's start out with Predator.

[09:52] Let's talk about Predator first because I have seen enough gameplay now. And I think you've all

[10:01] heard enough of the call. I was like, I feel like Predator is just, it just seems like a very,

[10:17] like, I don't know. It just feels a little boring watching the gameplay of it. I don't, again,

[10:23] it's because it's following games like Kong and games like Harry Potter and games like

[10:31] Elton John and Jaws. It just doesn't look that interesting to shoot at all. There's not much in it.

[10:40] And look, you make, you can't make Predator without Arnold. You can't make that movie without Arnold.

[10:48] The entire movie revolves around him. It's like making Hamlet without Hamlet. And you can see it,

[10:57] like even in the clips, like he's the one that brings all the energy and all the bad assness to

[11:05] the movie. It's not just seeing like the jungle leaves and the Predator and just random callouts

[11:13] from Dutch's crew. Like you need Dutch. Yeah, your soldiers die. Then they get revived. It doesn't

[11:22] make sense. I know, I know. Look, I don't know. It's just like, it just does, it's not working.

[11:31] It's not working. And you know, like if I were the pinball brothers, I would have

[11:39] gone in a different direction knowing the limitations because it's just really hard to compete

[11:45] at these modern prices. Remember this gang, this gang is, game, this gang. Wait, gang, this

[11:51] game is what I wanted to say is over $15,000 with tariffs and taxes and shipping. And

[12:00] yeah, it's like no one's buying this thing for 15. Five. No one's buying it for 12. Like, I don't

[12:06] know. I think everyone's already gunshot to pull the trigger on new unbox games in general. And

[12:14] if you were going to pull the trigger on a new unbox game, it's probably going to be potter.

[12:19] It's probably going to be, I mean, the smart part potter buy right now is not the CE. God bless

[12:25] you guys that bought a potter CE for 15. I don't understand what why, like they're going to be

[12:31] everywhere. They're going to be so much cheaper than 15. And they're going to make it for a long

[12:37] time. And the code's only on 0.7, what, like three or four. So you've got over a year left to code

[12:45] the game. Here feedback make changes by the time potters code complete. I fully believe this,

[12:54] but by the time potters code complete, I think you're going to see CE's for 10, 11. I think you're

[13:01] going to see Ellie's for eight. And I think you're going to see arcades for seven, you know,

[13:08] 6,500. They're just just going to make so many of them.

[13:16] It won't take three years. You know why it won't take three years, Todd, because

[13:21] unlike guns and roses. Remember, guns and roses is still only as 500 CE's.

[13:26] Jersey Jack will make a few thousand of these Harry Potter CE's. So I also think when people see

[13:35] the Ellie with the rad cows next to the CE, I actually think the Ellie is going to be the nicer pin.

[13:44] When people see the CE and the matte finish on the decals or the artwork, I don't know,

[13:52] it doesn't pop as much as I thought it would. And the top is atrocious. So like, I really do feel like

[13:58] the CE to me isn't like the clear way to go. I actually think the Ellie with the rad cows is going to

[14:04] be a nicer version of the game. And people are going to make nicer toppers for this game than the CE

[14:12] topper. I also just am really curious to see what people's feelings on Potter are like

[14:23] in three months after owning it. Is it still going to be pulling people in? So we should see, it's brand new.

[14:30] It's brand new. And I actually think it's going to be a huge hit for Jersey Jack.

[14:43] And I think it's going to sell like hotcakes for a few years. It's going to give Steve

[14:48] Richie more time to make his pin. I think we're going to get jaws 50th next week. Then John

[14:54] Borg episode one through three. Then we're going to get a remastered walking dead. Why? I don't

[15:04] know. Then I think it's Pokemon by Keith L. Win in January. And then we're going to get Beetlejuice

[15:11] from spooky pinball in December. The game that's going to be the game that sells out is Beetlejuice.

[15:17] It's going to sell out in instantly. I think Beetlejuice will be the biggest

[15:29] FOMO slash. It'll significantly increase in price. I think Beetlejuice is going to crush for

[15:43] spooky with francy on artwork. And it's just great. So we have to talk about this Potter artwork

[15:53] thing. This artist has made a statement that in blending together all the art elements,

[16:05] AI was utilized and not everybody who worked on the project project. I can't talk today.

[16:13] On the project was aware of him using it. Now in the end, I know that Eric and the team at Jersey

[16:23] Jack had to have seen this stuff. They didn't catch it. The folks at Warner Brothers that approved

[16:30] this didn't catch it. But the artist himself should have caught all of it.

[16:38] And I think there's something like 50 of the display model edition CEs have the issues or

[16:47] the old playfields. There's a new playfield. I don't think we're going to get Ironman again.

[16:54] And yes, Beetlejuice will be 888 units. Spooky smart. They know they want to just keep demand strong.

[17:04] They don't want to overdo it like they did Scooby Doo. And I think they're going to have a huge hit.

[17:12] And I think they also have Gremlins. I think this is going to be like they did it. They got

[17:17] like the nostalgic stuff everybody's going to want. So to put a pin on this AI art issue with

[17:27] Harry Potter, it is embarrassing for them. I know they had to destroy a lot of playfields to fix

[17:36] the problem. And you know, it's crazy is in the end. In the end, the man who's going to retire a

[17:47] multi-multimillionaire, he will have way more money than Keith L. Win will ever have or George Gomez.

[17:55] The man who's making the most money in pinball is going to get even richer because of this mistake.

[18:00] And that's Mirko. I mean, think about it. They have they're going to pay him again to make more playfields.

[18:09] He's making money on everyone. So when this mistake happens, Jersey Jack's mistake, not his. So

[18:15] he gets even more money. Even when his playfields were crappy, Jersey Jack made us buy them at cost.

[18:23] So he got paid again, Mirko. Ridiculous. But I think the AI scandal will come and go pretty quickly

[18:38] and people won't care anymore. And I was thinking, wow, will those original playfields with the

[18:44] mistakes, you know, the dragons and with the four eyes? And will that become the most collectible

[18:52] version, the variant that has the mistakes? I don't think so. This isn't a rare Star Wars action

[19:02] figure. This is a $15,000 mass produced pinball machine. Yeah, I think Mirko is an investor in

[19:12] J.J.P. I think that's why they can't get rid of him. Is what it is. I mean, guys smart using the

[19:20] right place at the right time. Yeah, I think I think Harry Potter is just... Here's my thing about

[19:34] Potter game. It still doesn't have any wow under the glass. I'm just going to say it. I just...

[19:47] What's the wow thing happening under the glass in Harry Potter? I'll let you guys answer. We got

[19:51] 71 people here. I just... There's just nothing magical happening under the glass. And for a game

[20:00] that is the theme, I'm still disappointed in how kind of empty it is and yet people are saying it's

[20:08] packed. So I know there's a lot of apologists, but I just... I see way more interesting stuff happening in

[20:15] King Kong, in Dune, in... I don't know, even like... I don't know, even like in Jaws. Like even...

[20:24] I just... There's just not much happening. Like only one thing in the entire game moves that

[20:32] interacts with the ball. Just one thing. I mean, go play Monster Batch, go play Batman 66, go play

[20:44] Wizard of Oz, go play Pirates of Caribbean, go play Godzilla. Like I just don't see where the wow

[20:52] is happening. Yeah, it's very skimpy underneath the hood gang. Like there's not much in it.

[21:04] I mean, I feel the same way. I thought it was a cool game to play, but it's not mind blowing.

[21:10] And I just wish there was... Like there's way more in Houdini and in October Fest than is in

[21:17] Harry Potter. I mean, there's so much more in Evil Dead, so much more.

[21:22] Evil Dead has... I feel like three times more things interacting with the ball

[21:29] than Harry Potter does. Remember gang, there's a reason why they can sell you a $10,000

[21:36] arcade edition that removes nothing from the game. Think about that for a minute.

[21:43] And they're making money on that game. So like, what do you think the bomb is on Harry Potter?

[21:51] If they're making money on a 10k version, just think about that for a minute.

[22:00] 6500. Right? Maybe? At most? So then you're gonna... Like basically, the fact that the same exact

[22:12] game is 15,000. Again, that's a whole another pinball machine. It's like a whole

[22:20] another game you could buy for no more game. No more game, no more code, no more mechs, no more

[22:26] nothing. You're getting the same exact game. So for all the... I don't know, you know, like,

[22:36] this is this is modern pinball now. The modern pinball content creators that enjoy gameplay and flow

[22:45] will just fall back on the gameplay as being the reason why the game is fun. And you know, and like,

[22:51] it's like, okay, then price is irrelevant. I mean, that's that's been the gas lighting of this

[22:56] community for the last like five years. It's just funny to me, but they've been taking more

[23:02] out of these games and charging more money. And seemingly, that's okay with so many people

[23:11] reviewing the product. You know what I'm saying? Like, if I were charging you a lot more for a car

[23:17] and then every model had less horsepower, like, you know what I'm saying? Like the future models

[23:24] were slower. Would you pay more? If I took more materials out of the interior and made the

[23:31] cart cheaper inside, would you buy it for more money? And I just think that's what's happened

[23:39] in the hobby is we're like, justifying what's in these games and there's not a lot in them to be

[23:48] honest. I think it was a lot more interesting stuff happening in King Kong than is happening in

[23:55] Harry Potter. But I think Potter as a theme is better than King Kong. I think Potter's theme

[24:03] integration is much better than King Kong. King Kong, the miss the miss on Kong for me is the

[24:11] absolute moronic decision. And I'm going to call it a moronic decision. And I know Keith, you're the

[24:17] best designer in the world. But the fact that you did not design a King Kong pinball machine where

[24:21] the damn gorilla is on top of the damn Empire State Building as the major mech in the game is like

[24:27] absolutely ridiculous to me. Like just hard stop there. You have the most iconic thing he's known for

[24:37] and then you don't put it under glass. You could have had an Empire State Building rise up from

[24:43] underneath the playfield. You could have had him up there and the planes are swirling around and

[24:47] you got to bash the planes because you're Kong. Whatever it is, there's just nothing like him just

[24:54] there like masturbating in front of a subway car is not Kong. Like it's just not. They said they tried

[25:04] it. But I'm so tired, David, of these like, yeah, we tried to get jaws to eat the ball, but it

[25:09] didn't work. We tried to put King Kong on a building, but it looked dumb. Come on. This is this is such

[25:14] like I'm do you really believe them? Do you really believe them that they can't execute the very

[25:21] iconic things that jaws is known for and King Kong? It's just I'm just then find a solution. We need

[25:28] him to be on top of the building. We need jaws to eat the ball. Like I'm sorry. Like what is this?

[25:35] Like, oh yeah, it looks stupid. It wasn't fun to play. Sure.

[25:42] Go from Potter to Kong and tell me they are comparable. Get real. A falling apart cartoon Kong.

[25:53] Well, I look, I the bill, welcome to the party. The quality issues on King Kong are absolutely

[26:00] embarrassing. I don't even think Stern like even play test these games enough anymore. Clearly

[26:07] they did not test X men or Kong. The new factory in general has been cranking out some really

[26:16] questionable quality control products. I already I already did my gym bill. I did my gym today

[26:24] was biceps and triceps. So yeah, try and keep up. Okay. Getting everybody should be working out.

[26:31] I mean it. I always say this. If you did a push up for every post on pin side, this would be the

[26:37] most ripped community in the world. Like imagine if ice man did 35,000 push ups instead of 35,000

[26:48] and post on pin side. Seriously, he'd be jack. So look, I don't know, Kong is still I've set

[26:59] this on my show yesterday though, Bill. I just I think in the end, in the end, in the end,

[27:09] 500 push ups, five days a week, amazing Bill. Bill, how many do you do straight through?

[27:15] Like I know you're not doing 500 in a row, but do you like 50 break, 50 break? Like what's your

[27:23] what's your cadence there? I'm curious. Where's it throughout the day? Because that's a lot. That's a lot.

[27:30] I you know what I do is a deck of cards. It's a fun workout. I'm every Monday is I um,

[27:35] I take a deck of cards and I flip over one card at a time and black cards are push ups or pull ups

[27:47] and how I do it now is anything eight or below is a pull up, right? And you do the number on the

[27:56] card. So I would do like eight pull ups. It got an eight or if I got a six of spades, I do six

[28:03] pull ups. Anything nine or above is a push up of that number. Face cards are 15 push ups and

[28:10] aces are 20 and then every red card is a sit up and I just go through the whole deck.

[28:19] Nice. Nice. Bill, your monster, Bill's in great shape always has been since I've known him.

[28:28] I mean, Sabrina's in better shape, but he's in good shape.

[28:34] Bill, you know, I envy you brother. Like you don't, you're not stuck in that nine to five grind,

[28:39] you know, you're you're you're you have the freedom to do it right. It's good. It's good. It's how

[28:45] we all should it's the ambition we should all have. Take care of your mind, body, and the rest will

[28:52] follow for sure. I am I think putting Kong next to Harry Potter Kong looks like it should be

[29:05] 50% cheaper. Okay, it just yeah, Frank just said it best. It looks washed out. It looks dull. It looks

[29:14] cheap, but it's still a great game. They're they might here's a thing gang. I think they're both

[29:23] great games. I think they're both great games. Jersey Jack's platform is just so much nicer looking.

[29:32] But Kong and the code they're going to put in it's going to be a great game. It's probably going

[29:37] to fall apart on you like every few months, but it's still going to be a great game. It's never

[29:43] going to have like a crazy following though. Like Kong is Kong didn't sell that great. I just don't

[29:52] think people want to spend that much money on it. And I think everyone's happy to a lot of people

[29:56] are happy to just wait. I I agree. I think X men okay, let's talk about X men now.

[30:05] They're going to make X men great. And I think X men's layout is better than Kong's. I've said

[30:14] this before. I think Jack danger is actually a more interesting designer than Keith Owens. Look,

[30:22] they're both really good, but I think Jack is as good as L win. And I mean this when I say this,

[30:31] they're first two games. If you look at what was it? Iron Maiden and what was

[30:37] L win second game? I can't remember if it was Avengers or Jurassic Park.

[30:46] But I think food fighters and X men as his first two games are are just as good as

[30:57] Keith Owens first two games. So they're both amazing designers. Like I again, but I don't think

[31:06] people talk about Jack danger in the same light as Keith Owens. And I think they should. I think

[31:15] that Stern has the best two designers in all of Pimble in those two guys. I don't think Erick's

[31:24] up there yet. You know, again, like Potter's fun to shoot. It's not as interesting creatively as

[31:36] as you know, L win and dangerous games. It's okay, but here's the thing. Mike Vinicore

[31:46] is now in charge of code. You know whose name you never heard when they showed us the new code?

[31:52] Kano not Kano. Wyson right? Why does it say Kano? Wyson right? Who's the dude that nerfed

[31:59] it from the beginning? Wyson? So I think that it's absolutely awesome and music to your ears.

[32:09] If you own an X-Men, I like I think X-Men Ellie. I'm just going to say this. And I've said this

[32:15] before. I think X-Men Ellie is in my top five of best looking sexiest Stern machines of all time.

[32:28] Let me give you my top five right now. And I'm just going to do this off the top of my head.

[32:34] The top five best looking Stern machines of all time as a total package, right? When you stand over

[32:41] these five games, head to toe, the armor, the cabinet artwork, the play field artwork. Let me give you

[32:48] my top five coming in at number one Batman super limited edition. There is no sexier machine

[32:59] that Stern has ever made than Batman super limited edition. Number two in terms of

[33:05] jaw dropping wow. Ghost Busters LE. Okay. Ghost Busters LE. Everything about it. It's so beautiful.

[33:22] Like it just looks so good. Coming in at number three.

[33:35] Deadpool Ellie. I think Deadpool, it is just that the whole package is just so damn nice.

[33:49] Okay, so that's Deadpool Ellie. Number three. Number four, I would put X-Men Ellie. I think

[33:55] X-Men Ellie is absolutely stunning. And then number five. Number five would be Elvira.

[34:07] Elvira. I actually think the Elvira anniversary edition is the nicest. I think it's nicer than

[34:15] the blood case I do. I like the colors. So I would put Elvira as number five. But those are all

[34:21] stunning machines. Star Trek Ellie is nice. But Star Trek play field is garbage, Anthony.

[34:27] Like Star Trek Ellie is like that was the dragon drop crappy Photoshop days of Stern Art.

[34:38] Predators dead on arrival. Did anyone order predator?

[34:54] Did anyone order the game?

[35:00] Do you guys want to, if you don't, if you, you do guys hear my show, hold on, let's play it real quick.

[35:09] Let's just listen to the opening because it's funny.

[35:15] Uh, share screen.

[35:22] Uh, here we go.

[35:29] All right, let's turn up the volume here.

[35:31] And that was the end of it. Let's restart it.

[35:40] And the stronger weapon you have, the better things we get this way. Now we start

[35:49] Chopper Mold Ball in the jungle.

[35:59] And there will be a number of jackpots lit.

[36:06] Get to the chopper.

[36:07] Go, go, go, go, what the hell was that ladies in gentleman? They forgot to say run.

[36:19] Run is what he says in the movie. I would love to look at everybody's face right now who

[36:26] ordered a predator and is now being like, what did we just do?

[36:32] The world is in Mold Raza.

[36:38] I mean, I sound just like it.

[36:46] Okay, all right. All right, all right, all right.

[36:52] Yeah, I don't think anyone's like, how do you really order that game? You know, I think, um,

[36:58] I, it's, it's, it's got to think you said it, man, it's just a mess. It's just a mess.

[37:06] Like I, I think they're trying. So I got a copyright infringement on one of my predator videos.

[37:13] And I think, I think they're trying to like, silence me or something. Someone complain.

[37:20] Um, someone flagged my content. I don't know.

[37:24] I, I always say this. I would say this to Andrew highway. I would say to the pinball brothers.

[37:30] There's nothing I can say or do that can hurt your pinball company. Any mistake,

[37:35] if your company fails, it's because of something you did.

[37:39] And, and I feel that way about this game. I feel the way about the pinball brothers. Like,

[37:43] this was all their decision. They wanted to make an Arnold list predator game.

[37:47] I would have told them this is a bad decision. You'd be better off making the last star fighter

[37:53] with all the assets. If you just made the last star fighter with all the assets from the movie,

[38:02] you would have sold more than you'll sell a predator without Arnold.

[38:06] If you made, I'm trying to think of themes that I know are probably easier to get. If you made

[38:13] police academy, right? With all the actors. If you made naked gun, if you made airplane the movie,

[38:25] right? I bet you could, I bet it's cheaper to get airplane the movie and all the actors in it.

[38:32] Then it is to do Arnold list predator.

[38:35] So, are there super chats? Can you even super chat? I don't know.

[38:44] Frank, I got to figure this out because I am making no money. Maybe I didn't turn them on.

[38:51] Let's see. I don't know. I'll figure it out next time.

[38:57] You guys can hear it, but killing is just yelling in the other room. It's just, you can hear it.

[39:10] At all I hear is him screaming at Brenda about something.

[39:18] You know, I watched Rogue One after watching season one and two of Andorne. I've seen Rogue One

[39:25] before and I loved it. But man, it's like, when you go watch Rogue One now, it like after watching Andorne,

[39:34] you're like, I don't even know how I even enjoyed it, not having any of the backstory of any of those

[39:40] characters. Like, absolutely. Andorne andorne is way better than Rogue One. It's like Rogue One. You

[39:49] just, you barely get a surface level understanding of who these characters are. But in Andorne,

[39:56] you really connect with all the emotion and the moments and how the rebellion is really built.

[40:03] You don't really feel that in Rogue One nearly as much. Like, Cassie and Andorne doesn't really,

[40:11] you don't really understand what he's been through to get there.

[40:13] Now, in totality, those three things, Andorne season one, two, and Rogue One are, I think,

[40:23] maybe the best Star Wars storytelling ever. And it adds so much more impact to what happens in a

[40:31] new hope. Incredible. Incredible. Like, Lucas never should have sold it and they bastardized everything.

[40:39] But any chance Borg's game is Andorne Rogue One. I don't think so. I think it is going to be,

[40:50] I mean, I would love it to be. I think it's going to be Episode One through three.

[40:56] I think Episode One through Three makes more sense. There's more action sequences in those movies.

[41:01] There's more like spectacle going on. There's more battles going on. You know,

[41:05] building the rebellions not, there's not as much fighting. I think if we get Darth Maul and duel

[41:11] the Fates and you get Attack of the Clones and you get Yoda with his lightsaber and you get

[41:17] General Grievous and you get Emperor Palpatine. And I think if they do it right, I think it's going

[41:24] to be pretty awesome. The issue is going to be Jar Jar Binks. How they handle Jar Jar.

[41:32] I don't know. It's like, you don't, it's like knowing what we know now, like Misa think a big

[41:39] a do do if they have too much Jar Jar in the game. Now we already have like, right? The pinball was it.

[41:46] Why am I blanking on the name? Pinball 2000, right? The John Papadu game.

[41:53] That was, we've seen it, but they didn't know, they didn't know when he made that game.

[41:59] What the, what, you know, that everyone was going to hate Jar Jar.

[42:05] Spooky should do five nights at Freddy's. No, no, no, no, spooky should not do that.

[42:20] Has anyone played Dune? I, you know, I talk a lot about how does pinball barrels of fun get Dune

[42:28] enthusiasm going? I watched the Carl's stream. Will Stern run Batman 66 again? I think there's

[42:36] a definitely a good chance that we might see a 70th anniversary of Batman next year, I believe.

[42:46] So if they're going to rerun Batman, why not do another anniversary year of it?

[42:51] So I think there could be a good chance of that. They might not want to rerun Batman

[42:57] because of the mechanical complexities in that game, but time will tell.

[43:04] Everything is open for Stern vaulting gang because they need money and they need,

[43:10] they need sales like they, they have not had the sales that they thought they were going to get

[43:17] on the last few years of games. So they need some movers and shakers.

[43:22] We got spooky Luke in the house. Is grumpy, franchy here?

[43:32] I want to say that, you know, I was talking to a friend about spooky pinball this week,

[43:37] and it's interesting. We were saying how you know when a game is successful like evil dead,

[43:44] you just don't hear too many people complain about it. Because most of pinside is just the

[43:49] complaining, right? The Harry Potter, everyone complaining about the art, everyone in King Kong,

[43:55] complaining about the quality issues, everybody complaining about this or that.

[44:01] Where you want to be is no chatter sometimes. Now no chatter though can mean two things.

[44:09] It can mean your game's a hit like evil dead and everyone's just enjoying it and waiting for their

[44:13] game. Or it can mean nobody cares about your game and that's why no one's talking about it.

[44:22] You want to be the first part of that. But I think that's what evil dead has become is just a

[44:28] hit game where nobody's really, nobody would change much on it. Batman 89 would be amazing.

[44:36] If spooky did, you know what I like about Franchie being over at spooky?

[44:42] And Christopher, welcome to the show, brother. I always love your work and we've had a very

[44:51] Sicilian like tumultuous relationship. But you know, I reconciled with my older brother recently,

[44:58] who I was estranged from for 30 years. And if him and I can reconcile, then you best believe

[45:09] one day. You know, Franchion, I already have one day. We're going to get we're going to get

[45:15] done to accept the handshake. It'll happen. It'll happen one day. Maybe not in this lifetime,

[45:24] right? But I love that that Franchie's over at spooky because he has really good ideas.

[45:31] And he understands the pinball market, Wonder Woman with Linda Carter, that would sell.

[45:37] Knight Rider would sell Superman 70, whatever, 76, 77 would sell. Like Christopher Reeves Superman,

[45:43] like he knows, he knows what people want. And he's on it. Like he's on the pulse of where this

[45:52] hobby is. Superman 78. Yeah. Okay. I just think like Stern didn't listen to a lot of what he was

[46:02] suggesting and mocking up for them. And I think Jody Dankberg just made a lot of bonehead mistakes

[46:12] in the licenses that he green lit. And you know, Seth came in the course correct that. But they let

[46:20] a lot of a lot of themes that they should have considered. They they overlooked them. And now it's

[46:27] it's it's maybe too late. Masses of the universe, GI Joe Transformers, like we know that

[46:35] barrels of fun is working on something because Brian Savage is like the ultimate like GI Joe

[46:40] Transformer like dude. So like if you make Transformers the movie G1 movie, just make the movie.

[46:49] Don't do the whole series. There's too many episodes. Make the movie with Unicron and Rodamus

[46:55] Prime and Optimus and Megatron and Galvatron with and get that soundtrack in it. It would be

[47:02] the greatest pinball machine of all time. And for those of you who have never seen Transformers the

[47:07] movie, it is one of the greatest animated movies of all time. The soundtrack is maybe the greatest

[47:13] soundtrack ever for an animated kids movie. It was ahead of its time. Everything about it. Like

[47:20] Optimus dies in the first 15 minutes. So like it would just be incredible.

[47:29] We need we need some humor in pins. I agree. What's going on? Trying to say how we see you.

[47:38] We see you vacuuming. Vacuum this house.

[47:50] My package get delivered.

[48:02] I'm in the garage. Rodamus Prime book. I think it's my brother. My brother's joined.

[48:10] Gang, my brother wrote an amazing book. Alex, do you have a link for people

[48:15] to check out your book? Talk about getting the right audience to check it out. My brother wrote a

[48:22] book called Rodamus Prime. And it is incredible. And if you love pop culture, it's kind of like

[48:33] ready player one meets modern day meets 80s nostalgia. And it's absolutely incredible book. I'm

[48:42] very proud of him. I enjoyed reading it. I know he's made some edits and he's got the latest

[48:48] version. But Alex, I'm not sure if you're ready to share that. But this would be a good audience.

[48:53] I think these guys will heavily enjoy it. We need um, space balls would be great.

[49:05] Need some beta readers. All right. Gang. Alex, if they want to beta,

[49:10] how do you, if anyone wants to be a beta reader, can you, can you write an email address they can

[49:14] send you? Who wants to beta read this book? I think you'll enjoy it. No one complains,

[49:21] yeah, because because Franchi doesn't use AI. Because Franchi takes the art you love about the theme

[49:28] and makes it better. Who's going to complain? Franchi's the butter on top of lobster.

[49:36] That's what he is. You know what I'm saying? Like you got the lobster, but Franchi's the butter.

[49:42] And when you dip that lobster in that butter, you're like no one's complaining. Nobody.

[49:48] All right, the butter. And his, his, his, um,

[49:57] yeah, then the job. Do you want to go spurs today? Um, yeah, Frank, you want to bring it over and

[50:05] help me move the neogeos upstairs. So here's what we're going to do. These neogeos

[50:13] are going to go upstairs. And then Frank and I are going to put a game here. And we are always

[50:19] going to have a game in the Canadian garage that we're going to rotate in and out. So this way,

[50:26] I will be able to have all of the new games come through here. All of the, like I'm going to

[50:34] start having a lot more opportunity to get intimate amounts of time on games. So for those of you

[50:41] who say you need to play more, well, you're going to, your wish will be answered. And I want to

[50:45] play more. I can't play as much upstairs on Guns and Roses. It's also because that came,

[50:50] can't move in and out. Like I can't move a game in and out of this house like that. Like that was a

[50:56] nightmare that I never want to go through again to get that game up there. And it's a work of art.

[51:01] I think it's just going to stay, especially looking at the prices of Guns and Roses Collector's

[51:04] Edition, there is, it's not worth it for me to ever get rid of it now. It's just not. Like I just,

[51:12] I still think it's a work of art. And I think 10 years from now, GNR pinballs is still going to be one

[51:19] of the coolest rock and roll pinball machine experiences ever. My battery is low. Oh, no. Where's the

[51:27] charger? How much juice we got here? 10%. All right, gang. Here's what we're doing. We're at an hour.

[51:37] So Frank, let me know. We're going to, we're going to go into this computer dies. We're going to go

[51:40] for like, I don't know if I'm going to do 90 minutes today. Wanted to get some stuff going around

[51:45] the house. No, the garage is great because like I can literally just bring in a game from the

[51:53] street level. No, no turning corners, no twisting around here and there. Like I will be able to get

[51:59] games in and out of here. And here's what I love. The, the community will just that I know. And the

[52:11] friends I know locally, like Frank and we have other friends here, like Mike, it automated. They will

[52:18] just loan me a game. I don't own it. Like, hey, Canada, like I'll let you borrow a Ghostbusters or

[52:26] a toy story collectors edition. Like there's such a nice community. Now I, what I, what I hesitate

[52:36] a little bit is like if, if, if Mike gives me a game of rather loner, I don't want to have to

[52:44] praise a game because it was given to me by a distributor. Like that's something I'll never,

[52:49] I'll never get on board for that because I still want to be able to tell you whether I like the

[52:55] game or not. No, see Derby, that answer is my, I just answered your question is I don't want to

[53:00] ever take a game where there's any strings attached where my, my, my feedback on it is meant to

[53:07] sell it for my distro friends. So that's why I don't really think like Mike will get me games,

[53:13] but Frank, Frank will and we have other friends locally that live around here that have games.

[53:24] It may fade if you keep putting in front of the windows. There's no windows here. There,

[53:30] there wouldn't be in front of a window. And all my windows are UV coated. So no fading. Yeah,

[53:38] Dave Frazier. Where's he been, Frank? I feel like we, you know, we hung out that one time.

[53:45] And you have, we haven't hung out since. He's busy. Yeah, he lives right next door in Darian,

[53:49] Connecticut. Big money Darian. Canada could not afford the Darian taxes.

[53:57] It's crazy when we looked at homes gang. I mean, it's just like, you know, it's just crazy. Like

[54:03] one town over, you know, better schools. You need two million dollars to get something decent.

[54:12] You know, it's, it's crazy. And that's nothing. I get, I was driving to New Cane

[54:16] yesterday, Frank, the, some of the homes that I was passing on this one road. I mean,

[54:22] we're talking 20 million dollar homes, like one after another after another after another after

[54:27] another. And she's like, wow, wow. I mean, that's like hedge fund money or it's just old money,

[54:39] right? If you've been, if you come from a family that's been investing in the markets for,

[54:45] not, not for 10 years, 20 years, but for like 70 years, right? Old money. Just keep growing.

[54:53] All right, here's the deal gang. I think it's been a good show. We're going to end it at an hour.

[55:03] I want to thank everybody for hanging out this Saturday. It's been fun. I will do more shows next

[55:09] week. We'll see if Jaws comes out. It's a short week. I hope everybody has a great fourth of July.

[55:16] As you know, pinball to me is a winter sport. So as the weather gets good, take care of your

[55:22] bodies. Take care of your mind. Get out there. Enjoy this world. Connect with nature. And you know,

[55:31] really think long and hard. Do I need another 15,000 dollar bid? I mean, nobody, nobody does,

[55:37] nobody does. I think all of these games lately have been put out into the marketplace and into

[55:46] culture before they were done. And I think that's the theme I've seen recently is if you're going to

[55:53] release a game early before it's complete, it has to have enough in it to really be exciting right

[55:58] away. I think evil dead had enough in it right away. I think Kong Kong and Potter due to

[56:05] June didn't predator clearly doesn't like, I think that's it. Like you got to excite people right

[56:11] away. There's only one chance to make a first impression with these games. And at these prices,

[56:17] once you start to second guess it, you're kind of just going to be like, yeah,

[56:22] I really care what all these content creators. That's fun. Yeah, well, okay. Well,

[56:26] see, a lot of content creators need to get all the new pins

[56:31] to have content. You know, I do take some credit in having such entertaining pinball content

[56:36] without even having the pins. Like you don't need it. Like I can, I can discuss them

[56:41] and play them elsewhere, but I don't need to spend 15k. All right, everybody. Be good. Enjoy your

[56:48] Saturday. Canate out. Okay, that was stupid. That was bad. Thanks, everybody. Frank, text me. We'll

[56:55] figure something out. Peace. Me in this stream.
