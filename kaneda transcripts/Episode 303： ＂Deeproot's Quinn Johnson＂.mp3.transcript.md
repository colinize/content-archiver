[00:00] Well speaking of going on and on and on and welcome to episode 303 of

[00:19] Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast that has a lower playfield.

[00:24] Now ladies and gentlemen, on this episode you're gonna get to hear from

[00:29] Quinn Johnson over at Deeproot Pinball, right? Even as I say Deeproot it's like

[00:34] this mysterious entity in the pinball world and I do believe in the balance of

[00:40] force in the pinball universe, right? That for one new pinball company to come

[00:45] out another has to go away to keep that balance of the force and so did we

[00:51] finally get the nail in the coffin with Dutch pinball so they finally sent out

[00:58] another newsletter and I have to say it's not dead because they keep making

[01:05] their buyers have faith and hope in the company. I want to read what they wrote.

[01:11] They wrote, we found out that lawsuits take a lot of time in the Netherlands. The

[01:17] story with ARA goes on and on and is still not finished. Here is a recap of what

[01:23] happened. We, Barry and Yop and our attorney were invited to a court hearing on

[01:29] December 5th and we and ARA could both tell our side of the situation. This

[01:36] week we received a temporary verdict. It says that the court advises ARA and

[01:42] us to sit down and discuss to see if we can come to an agreement. Our next steps

[01:49] will be to investigate if we can come to a settlement. We hope you will

[01:54] understand that we can't give any more details. As soon as we have a final

[02:00] verdict or a solution we will let you know. We never realized that we would end

[02:05] up in a courtroom when we started to design the most beautiful pinball machine

[02:10] and we are sorry that we dragged you into this situation. We are very very

[02:16] grateful for your continuous support. If we have news that we can share we will

[02:21] let you know. Regarding Barry and Yop PS, Yop's cancer is gone. The radiation and

[02:26] chemotherapy were successful and Yop is now working on his recovery. So that

[02:32] was the update from Dutch pinball and I have to say well first I'm happy that

[02:37] Yop's cancer he's in the clear for now. I'm glad I never wish any bad

[02:42] help on people. But what a joke of an update and I just I want to say the reason

[02:49] why this is a joke is it's now been two years and we are still at step one

[02:53] which is ARA and Dutch pinball trying to figure it out. What is the point of

[02:58] the legal system over there? The judge's verdict is a temporary verdict for

[03:02] these guys to sit down and try and figure it out. Why would it take longer than

[03:08] a few hours for them to get together and figure out a solution? I thought they

[03:12] were already doing that. I thought they were having lunch. I thought all this

[03:16] stuff was supposed to have transpired. It's now been two years. You can't tell me

[03:21] that these two entities can't get into a room and figure out within two hours

[03:27] whether or not anything's ever going to happen with the production of the

[03:32] Big Lebowski. Now look, again here we are in a perpetual

[03:37] stead of limba where nothing dies and I just want to say this. I don't know what

[03:42] happened but here's my best guess at what happened with this whole

[03:46] situation and I don't think we're ever going to get the truth because they

[03:50] lied to us about why the weight was taking so long when they said it was a

[03:54] bored malfunction when it was in. They were actually lying to everybody.

[03:58] Here's what I think happened. I think Beringioff pissed through the initial

[04:03] capital they got from the Big Lebowski buyers. I think they spent the money

[04:09] whether it was on traveling the world with the game whether it was personal

[04:13] salaries whether it was whatever. I don't know exactly where the money went but I

[04:18] know it didn't go to where it was supposed to go. I think what happened was

[04:22] they thought they would be able to make up that capital down the road because I

[04:27] thought they I bet they thought they were going to sell a few thousand of these

[04:30] games but the problem I think happened when they got the first bill from ARA.

[04:35] I mean literally the whole thing collapsed once they got that first bill from

[04:39] ARA and they couldn't pay it and so that was for I believe the 50 games that

[04:46] were made in shipped and then they had to pay for the other 40 games that were

[04:50] sitting in box at ARA and that's when the whole thing collapsed and that was

[04:55] about two years ago. So since then they've not been able to figure out a

[05:00] solution. It sounds to me like the only solution to get this thing back in

[05:04] production is money which they don't have. Where's that money going to come from?

[05:08] It's never going to materialize. Okay so two years later square one and then what

[05:14] happened with the whole what was it? ZerTech, Zitech, whatever Chinese manufacturer

[05:20] that was supposed to fix the problem that they were going to move the whole

[05:24] production to somewhere else. All the amount of time, money and effort they

[05:30] spent on that venture also failed. Now where's all that money coming from? The

[05:35] plane tickets to China, the training of the staff, the tooling up of that

[05:39] facility, all that collapsed and so here we are. Over two years later back to

[05:46] square one and nobody who paid for their big Lebowski other than those early

[05:52] achievers the first 50 got their games. So here's what I think should happen. I

[05:58] think that Beringyop should set up a conference call with everyone who paid

[06:04] them money on the big Lebowski and they should have a array in the room and

[06:09] they should actually allow the buyers of the big Lebowski who have been

[06:13] waiting for years to get their game. I think they should allow them to hear the

[06:19] truth once and for all. You can't tell me I don't care if it's each game cost

[06:26] one thousand more than we thought it was going to make or it's cost to make. If it

[06:30] was two thousand more, what's the truth? How much more per game did it cost a

[06:37] array to make than you thought it would cost to make? Like why can't they simply

[06:43] transparently tell us the truth? I think the reason why they won't is because

[06:50] they know the truth includes them burning through the money and that money

[06:56] not going to where it was supposed to go. It happens all the time in new

[07:01] businesses. People start to use the money that was invested to build the games,

[07:08] to pay salaries, to take trips, to do other things. You start to feel rich. You

[07:15] wake up all of a sudden you've got a million dollars in an account that you

[07:19] didn't have before really hard to make sure that money gets allocated to

[07:24] where it's supposed to go. Look and I could be if I'm wrong so be it but I've

[07:31] yet to see these gentlemen tell us transparently the truth of the situation.

[07:36] And you would think by now someone would would hear from a array and get their

[07:41] side of the story. If someone in Sweden, you know, I actually have a creative

[07:46] director who lives over there. I should ask him in because they probably speak

[07:52] just Swedish to like actually see if he can go over there and line up an

[07:56] interview with Canadian pinball podcast. That would be the interview of the

[07:59] year. You could get someone from a array to talk about their side of the story.

[08:02] Anyway, what else is going on in pinball? If you haven't seen Charlie,

[08:08] Emory and Ben Heck have been having words on a on pin side. Well look go

[08:15] read it. I mean the shots have been fired, Chuck fired back with some shoulder

[08:20] missile blast towards Ben Heck. Basically he's saying that he offered Ben

[08:25] half the company at the beginning. Ben would quit midway through projects.

[08:32] He was unreliable. Charlie didn't want to type that. We know Ben feels like his

[08:38] game was pushed aside for games he didn't think were that good. A lot of public

[08:44] sort of back and forth vitriol that I don't know about you guys but man it's

[08:49] like I don't think anyone wants to see those two like attack each other anymore.

[08:53] I mean it's pinball form. It's supposed to be fun. It's fun when you get people

[08:59] like different members on there going back and forth but these two gentlemen are

[09:04] are very well respected in the pinball industry and in the hobby. And so to see

[09:09] them go back and forth is a little unsettling. As much as people think I enjoy

[09:14] the drama. I mean when I was reading I was like oh it's kind of cringing like oh

[09:17] man like I wouldn't have I wouldn't have said what what Ben said I wouldn't have

[09:22] typed with Charlie typed I would have taken that stuff offline. Like stuff like

[09:26] that deserves to be offline. That being said I think Ben is going to come on the

[09:31] show. I'm supposed to talk to him this week. I want to talk to him about 2019 and

[09:36] what he thinks is going to happen in pinball and we might ask about this and see

[09:40] like what what's the deal like what how does he really feel about all of this

[09:44] because it seems to be something that is on both their minds and won't go away.

[09:51] So we'll see if Ben what you know we'll join the show and talk talk more about it.

[09:56] So what else is going on pinball so before we air the Quinn interview just

[10:00] lastly I want to say a couple things about about the monsters and about the

[10:05] Beatles and something that I've just been picking up as I read the threads. I

[10:09] think more and more people are starting to come to their senses on both of these

[10:14] games and I think in general the pinball buyer the new inbox buyer and you know

[10:20] who you are you probably listen to this show because I think most people who

[10:24] listen to this show are pinball buyers and collectors this isn't where you

[10:27] come for tournament talk. I don't think I've seen more flip-flopping back and

[10:32] forth on games quite like I've seen with the monsters and the Beatles you know

[10:36] day one monsters is the greatest game of all time. Two weeks later it's a simple

[10:41] game it's gonna be too easy it's not gonna be that much fun that single those

[10:46] two big single targets just wreak of laziness you know like the sky's falling on

[10:51] that game. The Beatles complete opposite games total crap who the hell wants this

[10:56] this is overly simple the Beatles deserve more than what they got I can't believe

[11:00] Stern is doing this cash grab and then a couple weeks later it played the

[11:06] Beatles it's fun I really enjoy it it's getting way more plays than I thought it

[11:10] would having fun with the Beatles so are we at the point now where I think it's

[11:16] fair to say that with all these new games coming out and with so much

[11:21] invested it both money time energy emotion everything you guys put in the pinball

[11:27] I think we're at the point now where I think you just have to play the game what

[11:33] else is there to tell you like what I don't know what else advice I can give I've

[11:37] seen people shit all over the monsters and you asked them one question well

[11:41] have you played it and I like no but wait wait so you made your opinion up based

[11:46] on a freaking twitch stream of a game that you there is no way that you can make

[11:53] up your mind on a pinball machine by watching a stream of somebody else play it

[11:58] how does it feel to you because you know what you bring to the game you bring

[12:04] your skill set you bring your emotional connection to the theme you bring you

[12:11] and you and only you can decide if a game is fun for you and this this activity

[12:19] of running after every new game and either buying it or passing on it's

[12:25] slamming it or praising it it's all kind of stupid I don't know I just I've been

[12:31] reading so much of it lately and I think everyone is jumping so quickly to a

[12:37] conclusion on a game and maybe I'm guilty of doing that too but I don't think so

[12:43] like I I went in played pirates a bunch it's just not the game for me I'm gonna

[12:49] play it some more than I want to play pirate with someone who can explain it to

[12:53] me better I think that would help me get a better appreciation of what's

[12:57] going on in that game but at least I go and play the game right Beatles I played

[13:05] it I thought it was like fun I didn't think it was eight thousand dollars fun I'm

[13:11] not a huge Beatles fan but I could see why people who love the band would love

[13:14] the game but it's again it's not a game where I feel like I'm gonna go pay

[13:20] eight thousand dollars for this so that's my feelings on the Beatles I think the

[13:24] diamond and the platinum editions are complete complete and utter rip-offs there's

[13:28] absolutely nothing that warrants the price of those games and I think if you

[13:33] want to Beatles I think you'll have to get one in in in a year or so for a much less

[13:39] money now is it selling out has it sold out I don't really know I don't know how

[13:45] to know these things anymore you know when I read in the thread people trying to

[13:49] speculate how well it's selling what do you how do you figure that out do you

[13:55] know how many distributors placed orders on the Beatles Stern could have placed

[13:59] could have sold everyone through to through two distributors I don't know I

[14:04] can tell you sometimes I'll go on eBay and I'll look and say wow there's a

[14:09] lot of Deadpool at least still for sale so maybe Deadpool Ellie didn't sell very

[14:13] well because it didn't sell out and and I wouldn't want to be a distributor sitting

[14:19] on four Deadpool at least I don't think they're gonna move anytime soon I think

[14:24] there's so many new games coming out that when you over by an Ellie from Stern and

[14:31] your distributor I think you're gonna take a little bit of it hit I don't know

[14:35] what the margins are either we got a little bit of that from Nick Parks right what

[14:40] happened when we start to get a little bit more finite information on how much it

[14:44] costs to make these games how much the margin is for distributors what happened

[14:49] right the Stern army like came after him a little bit and we had to take down

[14:53] some of that sensitive information but look just play these games people don't

[14:59] praise monsters for being the greatest game ever until you play it don't

[15:04] criticize Dwight for making a shallow game that has no depth until you've

[15:10] actually played it don't say you hate the targets until you've actually shot it

[15:16] right don't don't crucify Alice Cooper's nightmare castle for being a brick

[15:21] fest unless you play it and you come to that conclusion yes I do think the shots

[15:26] are tight I don't get overly touch overly tight shots and games yes I don't buy

[15:32] it when people tell me will you have you know you have to learn the shots you have

[15:38] to learn and then it opens up Houdini once you learn how tight those Houdini shots

[15:44] are then the games super fun come on no pinball machine should be frustrating

[15:49] it's an opposite of fun okay so that's what I implore you to do let me air this

[15:56] interview with Quinn I think you'll enjoy it now remember like he couldn't talk

[16:00] so much about what they have going on I still think deep route is going to come

[16:04] to tpf with something I do I just can't imagine them missing tpf and then

[16:11] when went and then when how are they gonna reveal where I don't think Roberts to

[16:16] kind of guy who wants to pull the curtain off and be like mic drop moment here's

[16:22] what we got and I think he wants to do it sort of like a Trojan horse like nobody

[16:28] sees it coming I think he's gonna wheel in something pull off the curtain and all

[16:33] of a sudden like all the attention stern thought they were gonna get all the

[16:37] attention Jersey Jack thought they were gonna get I think he's gonna look to do

[16:41] a little bit of like a coup man at this show that's just my speculation again

[16:46] nothing is confirmed but that's just what I would do if I were him anyway

[16:51] everyone here's Quinn Johnson from deep route pimple have a great day and we'll

[16:55] talk to you soon ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome one of the most

[17:00] highly anticipated guests I've ever had on canators pinball podcast Quinn Johnson

[17:05] coming from Texas who works at deep route pinball which you all are very

[17:12] familiar with Quinn welcome to the show thank you very much thanks for having me

[17:16] well thank you for coming on you know I mean it's it's hard for me to get

[17:20] guests on the show because the stern folks don't come on no more the Jersey

[17:23] Jack folks don't come on no more Sweden Robert was kind enough to save you have

[17:28] to talk to somebody you need to talk to Quinn about pinball so Quinn are you ready

[17:33] to live up to those expectations we'll find out you know if I make a big fool of

[17:38] myself then it'll at least still be entertaining so and you've done podcasts

[17:41] before right I mean this is this is not completely new territory to you yeah

[17:46] well so several years ago so I do I have a comic book that I've been working

[17:50] on for several years with one of my best friends and so he and I and my little

[17:56] brother Troy who's also a really big video game designer the three of us did a

[18:02] podcast for gosh a few years this is several years ago but but we did a

[18:07] podcast called the Dark On City podcast and yeah so we we just kind of

[18:13] talked and goofed around and right talk stuff so yeah so this is kind of you

[18:18] know I've done stuff like this before but it's always kind of fun to kind of be

[18:22] on the other side where we're you know now you're being interviewed so and and

[18:26] for for listener of the show so so Quinn is a storyteller and he's worked

[18:31] before on comic books such as Teenage Mutant Engine Turtles video game

[18:36] designer level builder for Disney so Quinn you know I was going over like your

[18:41] background and and is it fair to say that you consider yourself to be a

[18:46] storyteller a game developer a someone who loves to create experiences for

[18:51] for fans and and for for geeks and nerds like like pinball fanatics oh absolutely

[18:56] that's yeah that's why I'm super passionate about so yeah absolutely Quinn your

[19:01] storyteller you've worked in comics and video games pinball is a really

[19:06] interesting medium to try and tell a story I want to ask a lot of questions

[19:10] later on about how you actually think about storytelling through that medium

[19:13] but how did you even get introduced to deep route yeah so that's a good

[19:18] question so so I worked for a couple different video game studios for a few

[19:23] years and then and then honestly the so I wasn't Utah I so I lived in Utah

[19:29] before I came here and for whatever reason a lot of the the game companies

[19:33] started closing shop so so along with several of my my friends I used to work

[19:39] with you know I was looking for something for a while and you know obviously I

[19:43] wanted to take my time and find something that really fit what I love to do

[19:47] and what I'm good at and and just trying to find a good match for that and so

[19:52] honestly it was nothing more than I looked on a job website and that was one of

[19:57] the ones that came up that kind of had some of the kind of the direction that I

[20:01] was looking for with my with my career and interview and just to just apply it

[20:06] and then they interviewed me and so it's a pretty not a very exciting story as

[20:10] far as that goes but it was yeah it was kind of unique in that I didn't know

[20:14] anybody at all there you know and it was actually it was actually funny when I

[20:18] got when I saw the you know the job posting it was like looking for a

[20:22] narrative you know like a like a game narrative designer for pinball and I was

[20:27] like oh I wonder how that works and so I was like well I'll check it out and

[20:32] find out more about it and see if see what it is and so it was kind of a which

[20:38] was kind of exciting because you know it was it kind of became a position where

[20:43] Robert gave me a lot of freedom to figure out what that meant to be a you know

[20:49] a storyteller for pinball and then how that could you know what what what

[20:54] form that would take and what would be the most cool immersive type of thing

[20:58] and then I kind of had to work with with the others to figure out what that would

[21:02] look like and and make it something really cool so right so it was the first

[21:06] interaction over the phone and you guys so you obviously have worked in

[21:12] different mediums had you played a bunch of pinball before you know answer

[21:17] that query so that's actually a great question so I you know I am a huge

[21:23] video game guys so I'd go and play video games my whole life so I had been

[21:26] around pinball games you know like I'd seen I remember seeing Terminator 2 and

[21:31] Adams family and some of the other really famous pinball games toilet zone so

[21:36] I've been around them like in video game arcades and stuff like that and

[21:39] thought wow you know those look really cool and and like most people I kind of

[21:42] dabbled in pinball here and there but I was you know I was I was as someone who

[21:46] was not super deep into it I kind of figured your whole your whole job and

[21:52] been in playing a pinball game was to just survive you know just to just to

[21:55] keep that ball from draining and and try to survive and if you get some points

[21:59] then that's great so so yeah I did not come from a really deep pinball

[22:04] background but just a general video game and you know game design type mindset

[22:09] when you're not alone you're not alone Quinn most people and I grew up in the

[22:12] arcades and then mid-80s early 90s same thing like it was like Street Fighter 2

[22:17] Ninja Turtles Mortal Kombat Adams family was there but it was just kind of

[22:21] like something I played as I waited people to get off of Street Fighter right

[22:25] yeah yeah exactly exact same exact same situation so okay so you you saw it

[22:32] and then you saw the listing and so this is a completely new medium and what

[22:37] I'm curious about is how you know looking at the pinball machines from the

[22:42] past like and storytelling through pinball is something I'm really curious about

[22:45] because this was not a a job inquiry to be a pinball coder right this was more

[22:52] about can you help us shape the storyline of a pinball experience exactly exactly

[22:58] yeah the coding yeah coding isn't involved in it at all which I'm grateful for

[23:02] it because I I that stuff is totally over my head so so people who listen to this

[23:07] podcast they know a lot more than anyone probably should know about pinball so

[23:12] they know all about how like coding is they they they look at a game like a

[23:16] Batman and Lyman Sheets right famous coder at Stern and Keith over at Jersey

[23:21] Jack the coders oftentimes I think also are looked at as the storytellers of the

[23:28] game now how does it work at deep roots are you working hand in hand with a

[23:32] coder and like I know we're not we don't know any of the games right so we're

[23:38] still hypothetically talking here but what how early on in the process are you

[23:44] sitting down with these designers and these coders and saying well what's the

[23:48] story we're trying to tell here right well it's actually it's it really actually

[23:52] a pretty cool process it's very collaborative typically the way that it's

[23:57] happened is that you know I'll talk to Dennis or Barry or whoever is just

[24:03] coming up with the main design for the game kind of what the what the layout is

[24:07] going to be what are the main features going to be on this game what are some of

[24:10] the main mechs and stuff on the playfield going to be you know a lot of time

[24:15] they'll they may have the beginnings of a story in their mind or at least a

[24:18] genre and so I just kind of take it from there and and so actually what they

[24:23] what most of the time has has happened is they come up with this basic game

[24:26] design this basic theme idea and they say you know you do whatever you want to

[24:33] do with it and and just just take it from here and and which is really cool

[24:38] it really really cool to work with these crazy talented legends and and and to

[24:43] have such a good friendship with them and and but yeah I mean we just kind of

[24:46] take it from there and and then and I'll just generally I'll just start writing

[24:51] I'll just start coming up with characters and who the main characters are

[24:55] going to be and kind of what's the right what's the story you know kind of like

[25:00] just build it from there and then and then you know and of course we we

[25:03] collaborate the whole time so I'll say this is what I'm thinking so far what

[25:08] do you think and then they'll come back with ideas and then we'll kind of

[25:10] about things about each other so right when I'm curious about because obviously

[25:14] you know in the world of video games you you you're designing a virtual world

[25:18] but in the world of pinball you're you're working with a physical world so

[25:23] how does it work with trying to create a story but are you inheriting you know

[25:29] the mechanisms in the toys or do you ever have like ideas like like for

[25:32] example if this is a story we're trying to tell it'd be really great if we had

[25:36] a toy or a mech that could actually you know create that story to life and

[25:42] that world in our glass in the best possible way so like you know is it do

[25:45] have an ability to shape what physically goes into the game yeah actually

[25:50] well it's kind of both both those examples that you shared so there's times

[25:53] when they're like this is what we're planning on having physically on the

[25:57] playfield so these are these are the the opportunities slash limitations that

[26:02] you have to wrap some some gameplay ideas and some story around but on the

[26:08] other hand I mean yeah there's been tons of time is where I'm come out of

[26:11] something and I say man in my mind it would be really cool if there was this

[26:15] feature on the playfield that did this and this what do you think right and then

[26:20] the designer and and some of the other like the mechanical engineers and

[26:23] those that are involved in all that physical side of it right a lot of time

[26:27] they're like they're like yeah you know that sounds like that's a cool idea

[26:31] and let's see if we can make it work and iterate on that but you know but

[26:34] obviously there's times and they're like yeah that physically is impossible so

[26:37] let's think of a different thing that would also be cool that would serve that

[26:40] purpose so so it's kind of a neat challenge to kind of go back and forth and

[26:46] back and forth and and then just develop it as we go is it is pinball as a

[26:51] storyteller has pinball been one of the most challenging mediums to tell a

[26:55] story what is it is and it's but it's it's a unique and really cool challenge

[27:02] in kind of the way that I think about it is you know with with with like a

[27:06] video game or a movie typically you're like all right this just programmed in

[27:12] there to you know everything stops and now you just watch this big long cut

[27:17] scene or movie scene or whatever right to kind of tell the story and flesh it

[27:20] out pinball you don't have that because this you know because generally speaking

[27:23] the ball is always in motion there's always something that you have to be

[27:26] keeping an eye on so you're like so how do you how do you tell a big immersive

[27:31] story or make it a really cool immersive experience when you have that that

[27:35] aspect that's kind of central to what pinball is and so so you're like okay so

[27:40] how do we still what are the opportunities that we have to still get

[27:45] across a compelling story or characters or story beats

[27:51] within this special media you know this special medium that we have with pinball

[27:55] so it was you have to think about hey so what are the opportunities what are

[27:59] what are some cool things that you'd have to do game rules wise or rules that

[28:04] wise you know for a challenge or a mode or whatever and then you know and then

[28:09] you have to sink okay and it has to a lot of the time it has to end with

[28:13] they're being someone that physically locked the ball right and then you're like

[28:17] well if the ball then when the ball is locked then you have a little bit of

[28:21] breathing room did to show a scene or whatever you want to do you know but a lot

[28:26] of times there's just clips that last a couple seconds and that's what you get

[28:30] and that's okay and if they kind of give flavor to the whole thing and build it

[28:33] out gradually then and it adds to the experience and that's fine it doesn't you

[28:36] know it's not a movie it's not a video game but you can still tell cool stories

[28:41] I guess it's kind of like really I guess it's kind of like comic books in a way

[28:46] where you know if you're looking at a comic book page it's not moving images

[28:51] it's still images but that still image can still tell a lot of story just by

[28:58] looking at it for a few seconds but if you have to choose what the visuals

[29:01] gonna be have to choose what the the dialogue is gonna be right to get across

[29:06] that story within just a brief look you know right no and absolutely and I

[29:13] think everyone can relate to in pinball I think there's been a a real sort of

[29:18] in a you know I don't see innovation but I want to think there's been a a

[29:22] progression into the story being told more if it has moved from the play field

[29:28] up into the LCD screen right and I think we've seen more and more new games have a

[29:34] lot more time being spent on the LCD do you think that I mean talk to me

[29:39] about that because as when you're playing pinball and I'm noticing in this in

[29:43] some games where a lot of effort goes into an LCD screen but I can't really look

[29:47] up that long how do you figure out that balance where you know we're telling the

[29:52] story but we're not requiring the player to spend too much time while they're

[29:58] frantically trying to keep the ball alive we can't put too much on the screen

[30:01] and and and have their eyes being you know going up and down all the time right

[30:06] well that's one of the you know and I'm sure this is how it is for everybody

[30:09] especially people that were that are new to the pinball world like I was you

[30:13] know it's like you're not even that it's like what you said it's like you don't

[30:17] if you try to look up and look at this screen and try to get some sense of what

[30:21] you're supposed to be doing then you drain the ball and you know so it's like

[30:25] okay well that was well you that's a problem and but it's a common problem it's

[30:29] still happens all the time today there's lots of games pinball games that I

[30:32] play now or I'm like I have no clue what I'm supposed to be doing and if I try

[30:36] to look up and figure out what the screen is telling me then you know my eyes

[30:40] off the ball and I've lost the ball so so it is a really big challenge I will say

[30:45] that that we're we're doing some really unique creative things to kind of

[30:52] help deal with that issue but it is it's a constant challenge and a constant

[30:56] balance of you know a the the most important thing is the player has to have a

[31:02] sense of what they're supposed to be doing you know you don't want to leave them

[31:05] totally in the dark they have to have some way you know and of course there's

[31:09] lots of ways to do that there's there's the inserts there's you know voice

[31:13] voice over lines and dialogue and stuff and then visuals that can you you really

[31:18] just want to help direct the players what they're supposed to do so that's the

[31:21] biggest thing right and then get some entertainment on top of that then

[31:25] that's really awesome too so if you can find a way to kind of marry both right

[31:29] both those purposes and that's that's really great so Quinn something that I've

[31:33] noticed and I've I've like you I'm not I haven't been following pinball my

[31:38] whole life but something and I play a lot of video games and I read comic books

[31:42] and I love movies something that's always annoyed me about pinball is when you

[31:47] walk up to a game and I always find that it's really hard for most people who

[31:52] walk up to a pinball machine to just know what to do immediately to know what

[31:57] story I'm in to know what like what my mission is right like what and are you

[32:03] guys tackling that and like how do we really pull people in to a narrative and

[32:08] an experience that has purpose and mission where they're not confused we're not

[32:13] relying on a movie where they already know the pre-existing narrative like how

[32:17] do you know how do you introduce it the way you would and like in a super

[32:20] Mario Brothers game or Halo or there's actually a foundation for the journey

[32:26] you're about to go on yeah well so again there's some things that we're doing

[32:30] that I can't fully talk about yet but but uh to kind of help tackle some of that

[32:34] but yeah you know all your secrets Quinn Robert said it's okay yeah I understand

[32:40] but I will say that that one thing that we've kind of you know and again me

[32:44] coming from a video game playing life and you know in game design you think okay

[32:50] so what does that video games do you know what is it that like when you walk

[32:56] like when we were kids and you walk into a video game arcade what attracted you to

[32:59] one to a particular game for me I mean I remember like talking about street

[33:04] fire like you or I walking up to the street fighter machine and seeing this

[33:08] crazy awesome cutscene that really gave you a sense of oh my gosh these are

[33:13] some cool of characters gives you a sense of what the action in the story is

[33:17] going to be and really succuents the attract mode type of deal you know is

[33:21] really really big and obviously you know it's nothing new it's what pinball

[33:25] has been since the beginning but the like the the back glass artwork should

[33:30] pretty quickly tell you what what the story and the theme and everything

[33:33] are to get you interested think like wow who are these characters and and I

[33:38] want to find out what this world's all about and I want to see what's going to

[33:41] play on the LCD screen when I when I tackle this game but as far as like your

[33:46] your question one of your questions was you know how does someone who's just

[33:50] walking into the machine how do you give them a sense of what they're supposed to

[33:52] do kind of the way that I look at that and this is more on the this is

[33:59] probably more on the art side which which I I help with you know I help work

[34:03] with the the artists and stuff to to kind of help plan some of this stuff out

[34:07] but obviously a big part of it is the playfield you know if if the playfield is

[34:12] just kind of a big mess of artwork it's cool as that artwork is if it's just

[34:17] kind of like a bunch of stuff just thrown on there that doesn't really help

[34:22] you figure out what you're supposed to be doing but if you know if and it's

[34:25] just kind of comes down to like basic art principles of where is my eye being

[34:29] led you know my eye being led to the major targets of the game you know is

[34:34] that is that incorporated into the artwork so I so I kind of subconsciously

[34:38] already kind of know where the main shots are so that's part of it I don't

[34:43] know if it answers your question I feel like well we've seen artwork to you

[34:47] know obviously improve across the category of in Pimbo but I've always said to

[34:53] you know a lot of it now you know we're getting very complex detailed art but

[34:57] the art doesn't really sync up with the shots all the time with the story

[35:01] that I write is just hey here's like a lot of cool Deadpool artwork but it doesn't

[35:07] really indicate that you know this this is the area where I'm supposed to do

[35:13] this or this is the area where this happens kind of just like putting art for

[35:18] art's sake and I do think you can tell the story but it's hard right because

[35:23] it's it's you only have one play field so you got to make every inch of art

[35:27] count if it's gonna help or just be there for beauty sake right right one kind of

[35:34] way I look at it and again I kind of think of things a lot of time in in the

[35:39] language of movies and video games and stuff but I think a good example of this

[35:42] is I was watching the Infinity War with the commentary and the directors and

[35:48] the writers talked a lot about they said we obviously have so much going on in

[35:51] this movie so many characters so many plot lines every time we could have a

[35:56] scene that would it would we try to make it so it would basically multitask

[36:01] go to accomplish several things at the same time you know one this is what the

[36:05] main plot point of the exposition is two really entertaining action scene

[36:08] or whatever three advances the character arcs and if so if they can like be in a

[36:13] scene where they're like hey that's that guy over there that was a part of my you

[36:17] know part of my life while they're jumping on to a plane or something I don't

[36:22] know I'm just making stuff up but if they can all they think and do several things

[36:25] at the same time then that's the ideal where is there are lots of movies where I

[36:30] watch it I'm like I have no idea what's going on it just feels like a big

[36:33] mishmash of stuff and I call justice league versus Avengers exactly exactly

[36:40] and that's exactly what I'm thinking and also there's and you know also it's

[36:43] like and I think the Marvel has done an awesome job with that of like I made it

[36:47] being entertained but I'm also I also am really emotionally and fit in what's

[36:52] going on so I think the point where they released the Spider-Man trailer and

[36:56] ruin the entire ending to Avengers endgame

[37:00] this week they they just

[37:02] Spider-Man trailer and he's dead in Avenger like what are they doing right

[37:10] right so you know so it's just you know and so it's this it's this weird thing but

[37:15] yeah so as far as it goes with pinball I think it's the same thing if you can find

[37:18] a way where the artwork is really cool but it also serves a function and and

[37:22] moves the story along at the same time or like you know it

[37:27] subconsciously tells you what you're supposed to be shooting at what the

[37:29] important shots are but it also looks really cool right so in you what coming

[37:33] from the world of video games and there's there's obviously things that

[37:36] happen in video games that we've never seen before in pinball for example in a

[37:40] video game you can save your game and return where you were is that something you

[37:44] guys are exploring with pinball

[37:48] possibly he said very non-committal

[37:53] right but it's it's it's interesting right because up to this date I mean

[37:58] pinball's always been about when you start a new game you're starting over from

[38:03] the same place every time I mean I don't think I've seen a game where that's

[38:07] ever been different Quinn did you play a lot of pinball machines just to see

[38:13] like how other games throughout the years have have tackled storytelling and

[38:18] are there any of them that you were impressed by that you felt like this is

[38:21] this was a really good game that immersed me in the story and the objective and

[38:26] and what were the elements that impressed you that's a good question I mean

[38:34] there's always the cool stuff where like I'm just trying to think like like

[38:39] off-top my head I mean like Terminator you play Terminator you hit some

[38:45] stuff and then they show a really cool scene of you shooting down a ship and

[38:48] I'm like oh that's really cool I don't know if it necessarily is telling me a

[38:51] story I can follow but but it looks cool so yeah that's a really good question I

[38:56] would say that probably the one that comes to my mind is Ghostbusters the

[39:02] Ghostbusters pinball game in that you know the further you get you are going

[39:07] from who brought the dog to you know the Ghostbusters you know getting knocked

[39:14] down the pit in this great and then them climbing back up you know and stuff

[39:18] like that so in that so in my mind I really like that because it does feel like

[39:22] you're progressing you're invested you know like I just thought that was

[39:27] really I was actually just watching somebody play ghost the other day and I

[39:30] had that scene were one by one you know as you hit the correct shots you see the

[39:33] Ghostbusters climb out and right and it was it was it was what was

[39:38] interesting with Ghostbusters right it was it was a linear storytelling

[39:41] mechanism within that game yeah and there was debate in that because in pinball

[39:46] there's people are so used to mode selection where if you look at a game like

[39:50] lower the rings right everyone's familiar with the storyline within the

[39:53] trilogy Star Wars the same thing you don't progress through the pin the same

[39:59] way you progress through the movies you can actually it's like choose your own

[40:02] adventure based upon the scenes that you're very familiar with right right

[40:07] yeah and I think that you know and I think that that's a cool way to do it I kind

[40:11] of think a cool way to do it a lot of the time is and again I again I apologize

[40:15] for talking about video games so much but that's kind of what my background was

[40:18] but but like the Mega Man games where it's like you have a first level and then

[40:22] you have several levels where you can kind of choose the order you want to go

[40:25] in but then ultimately once you've accomplished all that then you have a final

[40:29] level that's always the final level but you have to do all these other things

[40:31] you know maybe not you can in different order every time but you have to

[40:35] accomplish all these things before you can get to the final level right and that's

[40:38] sort of like lower the rings I mean you've got you you've got a light all the

[40:41] different or finish all the modes or the multi balls and then you get to

[40:46] destroy the ring so no matter what path you take in that game you will end up

[40:51] trying to destroy the ring the way Gollum did in the film right it's so it's

[40:55] still it still syncs up with the finale that everyone loves from the from the

[41:00] movies I guess you know of course I have Quinn is one of the games that we

[41:05] know you guys are working on and this is not secret it's a game that I've

[41:09] actually owned myself is Magic Girl John pop Luke and he obviously John is

[41:15] probably the most high profile higher that Robert made for obvious reasons I

[41:22] won't go into it but because Magic Girl is a game that is out there in the

[41:27] world and that you guys are are retacling have you as a storyteller and I have to

[41:33] say because I own the Magic Girl and I'm not really sure what the story is

[41:37] having played having played the version that American pinball shipped have you

[41:42] sat down with John and and and Magic Girl and have you you know figured out

[41:48] what what is the story of this game is it a prequel to theater of magic and

[41:52] and and have you worked it all on that title I will say that that we are doing

[41:59] some really really cool things with it some of it we are keeping kind of with

[42:04] what the original themes and ideas were and then some of it were we're taking

[42:09] it further I guess you could say so we're really exploring the possibilities of

[42:15] what's possible it has a lot of it has a lot of further to go because the game I

[42:21] had the mex you know have the mex didn't work right it was beautiful right and

[42:25] I think that was a game that visually told a story that it was almost like the

[42:32] cover of the book was there and you just kind of want to see like well what is

[42:36] the enchanted hair mean right yeah what does this mean the levitating ball

[42:41] you know the King's Chamber there was all and I think John does a great job of

[42:46] visually introducing you to a world and and a story on the play field it's

[42:52] just like the mechanisms didn't bring to life what your eyes were seeing right

[42:59] and so you guys are you confident like we're gonna I'm excited because so this

[43:05] and the reason why I do bring up magic girl Queen is because it is a title

[43:08] that we know like it's it's it's it's one of the only few that we know that you

[43:12] guys are confirmed to be working on what what is it been like working with

[43:17] John and the other designers really really cool really really cool well no one

[43:23] of things that's been so cool is you know with magic girls as a specific case I

[43:27] mean you're taking something that's been worked on by different people over

[43:31] several different iterations and then you're saying okay you know what what can

[43:37] we do to add on to it and to take it some some new directions that hadn't been

[43:41] explored before and have it still all you know honor what the original feel was

[43:46] and what the original intent was so yeah it's a really cool it's a really

[43:51] really cool experience to kind of bounce ideas off each other and then and then

[43:54] kind of take some of these concepts and kind of go crazy with them you know and

[43:59] really take them in a really cool direction so and I think it's something that

[44:03] people when when the game does come out that people are gonna really really

[44:06] like right so I know it's still kind of in because there's still some stuff I mean

[44:11] like it's I'm just sort of always curious about with pinball too is how like

[44:16] does the story come before the design do you wish the story came before anyone

[44:21] even started sketching a layout because I always feel like why not nail the

[44:26] story and then build the game around it let's and so that's a really

[44:32] interesting question and it's actually it's so yeah I agree because I

[44:39] like I have I have I have like my comic book that I've been working on for a

[44:43] long time where I have definitely been very like this is the story and I want you

[44:48] to stick with what the story is but then there's been other opportunities where

[44:51] you they're kind of you're given stuff that's already been done and and it's

[44:56] actually a really exciting cool thing to take that and be like yeah let's let's

[45:02] come up with something that takes this amazing design that didn't really have a

[45:05] whole lot of story behind it in the first place and build a really cool story

[45:08] around it and then how will that connect to all these other cool concept art

[45:12] pieces and stuff and build those all off each other it's kind of like well so

[45:17] so kind of like a comic book example is is with Stanley and Jack Kirby so they

[45:22] had a really interesting method that blows my mind because I don't I could never

[45:26] operate this way but but basically Stanley would go hey I kind of have this

[45:31] general idea for this story for the fantastic for this month and then Jack

[45:35] Kirby would be like okay and he would basically draw the entire thing with no

[45:39] dialogue and just just kind of draw the action scenes and just be like yes so I'm

[45:44] kind of drawn these action scenes with kind of in mind that some of this cool

[45:47] stuff happens and they meet this character in fight but I don't really know

[45:50] what any of the dialogue is that what the actual story is gonna be and then

[45:54] Stanley would take that artwork and go like okay cool and he just make up

[45:56] the dialogue that went on that went with the artwork there right so it was

[46:01] just really interesting creative process and that's so I feel like what we're

[46:05] doing a lot of time is kind of a mixture of that where there are there are

[46:08] times where you know again my designer has a basic concept of something and

[46:13] then I just kind of make up everything that builds on top of that and then it

[46:17] goes from there but then there's that it's a really kind of a cool challenge

[46:20] when you have something where artwork is already been done where there's some

[46:24] story stuff that's kind of been done but but really it's and then you kind of

[46:28] have built on that you know and so it's and then you you know collaborate and

[46:31] you work back and forth and you kind of develop it as you go and everyone throws

[46:34] an idea that changes the course of certain things and it's a really it's a

[46:38] really cool organic process of creativity yeah I mean I've always been

[46:42] fascinated to buy music I mean some musicians they write the lyrics first then

[46:46] the music and then some write the music first then the lyrics so something you

[46:51] said Quinn at Expo and I know you guys were at Expo Robert had the team up

[46:57] there and you know there was a lot of very bold statements about what we were

[47:02] gonna see from Deeproot but something you said and I listened to your parts

[47:05] today was that limitations are being taken away from pinball over at Deeproot

[47:12] can you articulate what some of those limitations are that you guys are

[47:17] are removing from the traditional experience that we might see in in a in a

[47:21] Deeproot experience I can say that one of the limitations that we are really

[47:29] tackling in a way that people I think will really really like is kind of what we

[47:33] talked about before of just expressing to the player what they're supposed to be

[47:37] doing kind of taking away that that struggle of a playing a game and you lose

[47:42] you like drain all three balls and you're like I have no clue what just happened

[47:46] you know or what I was so have done so we're doing some really cool innovations

[47:51] that will tackle that that's just one of the things kind of the way and again I

[47:57] know I'm not really adding anything new to what Robert's already talked about in

[48:01] previous interviews and stuff but but everything you can think of that drives

[48:06] people crazy about pinball we are finding really cool ways to tackle that what

[48:11] is a day like a deep root you walk in the door like you know at some point

[48:18] here like do you have like a checklist of like I need to help with storylines for

[48:22] XYZ and I've done that like how is it is is what's it like I mean what's the

[48:27] environment like I mean it's it's still like very much a mystery to most of us

[48:31] sure well it's it's different every day I will tell you that like like I could

[48:36] be working on something totally different every day or I could be coming back

[48:39] to something that I'd worked on a couple weeks before and now it's ready from

[48:43] what other people have been working on now it's ready for me to then keep

[48:46] developing my part of it you know we can get back really well for like

[48:50] instance for for instance like I share an office with with Steve and Blake and

[48:56] you know so Steve maybe working on the rules for one of the games that I've

[49:01] been kind of writing the story for and then he gets to a place where he's like

[49:06] okay I think this is my first draft of this new rule set and then I say okay

[49:11] great I take that and then I try to look at that and then re reconfigure some of

[49:17] the story to move around those rules better so there's so that could be a

[49:22] project I'm working on for a week is just just tweak in that for a game on it but

[49:27] as far as what what what the environment is like it's awesome everybody is super

[49:31] super cool it's actually it's really interesting to work in a place where

[49:35] there's no drama and everybody likes each other a lot and we have lots of fun

[49:40] but everyone's working really really hard and everyone's totally committed to

[49:44] what they're doing you know it's it's funny because I feel like whatever you

[49:48] work there's a never will be gonna be just people that are different you know

[49:52] and there's gonna be people that seem like they're just slacking off and goofing

[49:55] around and are just there to collect a paycheck and hopefully don't get caught

[49:58] by the boss or whatever you know but there's none of that here there's none I

[50:02] hear everybody's totally dedicated everybody is totally passionate about what

[50:06] they're doing everyone's amazing at what they do I'm just right so how often

[50:10] how often does John Boppery there is it is it is it just depends just you know

[50:18] he's just he's in and out let's just kind of his arrangement that he has with

[50:21] when he's right so Quinn you know it sounds like there's a lot going on right

[50:27] and there's a lot of excitement and we hear it from Robert I think we saw it

[50:31] from the team when you guys are at Expo how far along are you guys um you know

[50:39] I don't know if I can comment on that at all I will say that we that were really

[50:43] far along a lot of stuff and then there's lots of other stuff that's coming

[50:46] that that were we're still developing right that's for ambiguous like I know

[50:51] but I mean so 29 I mean we know that Robert said that T.P.F. wouldn't be the

[50:57] five days of deep route right that was initially supposed to be the plan was

[51:01] that communicated to the larger team like the plan was at T.P.F. 2019 to

[51:07] start to reveal to the world the magic you guys have been working on and

[51:11] and we heard a few weeks ago that that that's no longer the case was there any

[51:15] like was there any frustration by the team that we have the delay showing

[51:19] everyone like how bad ass we are or or is everyone just like still focused on

[51:24] just making the best thing possible yeah I think it's just we're everyone's just

[51:28] so focused on making the best thing possible I will say one of the things that

[51:32] is just super awesome about working with Robert is that he's very open with

[51:37] everybody about stuff he's very honest very humble about stuff when he's like

[51:43] hey you know we've reassessed the situation and here's the decision that we

[51:47] made and this is why we made it and let me know if you if anybody has any

[51:51] thoughts or feedback so it's just really cool everybody's totally on board with

[51:55] it we totally respect his decisions and he knows what he's doing you know he's

[52:00] a super smart guy knows you know knows what he's doing and and yeah so we're

[52:06] totally and as far as I know we're all totally in support of his decisions and

[52:11] we just kind of do what makes the most sense for the for the best of the

[52:14] company and and to give every other the best the absolute best product they can

[52:18] get you know so now with so much stuff going on and and Robert said that we

[52:23] might in 2019 see deep root chip more games and any manufacturer ever is is

[52:30] there is there one game there that's pretty much just like it's it's done and

[52:36] everyone's been jumping on and and being like this is it like let's get

[52:39] manufacturing ready because like at least this one's ready to go is or is it

[52:44] like everything's still in a little bit of a state of development oh I mean

[52:49] everything's always being developed some are very much further along than

[52:53] others so I don't know if I can say much more than that that's fair and so one of

[53:02] the things that on this show and I know when you haven't listened to Canadian

[53:05] Spinball podcast but I'm always harping on world under glass and that the

[53:11] mechanical toys in a pinball machine are so important right that you want to

[53:15] see the ball do something magical because what is the point of playing pinball

[53:19] if everything is happening on an LCD screen I think that's lazy I think it's a

[53:23] lazy way to bring the world to life if it's all happening on an LCD right have

[53:28] you just been blown away by the toys and the engineering that is happening

[53:32] under the world under glass like I feel like that's what the pinball fans are

[53:38] craving more than anything yeah well you know I think a big philosophy that we

[53:45] have is that it's it's a pinball game first and foremost it's not it's not a

[53:51] movie you know I'll see so yeah it has to so we are we are developing some really

[53:56] really cool animations and stuff to go on the LCD screen but but the main

[54:00] focus is this has to be a solid game that plays really really well that's

[54:05] really fun you know is it really fun does it shoot well or they're really like

[54:09] he said are they really cool max of the really unique cool things on this game

[54:13] that no one's ever seen before that's one thing that's been really really cool

[54:17] is every it seems like every game that we come out with that every you know that

[54:21] whenever one of the designers comes up with a new game they're doing something

[54:26] that no one's ever done before which is really really cool I mean it's and it's

[54:32] honestly really cool that you know with a couple of the designers I know that the

[54:35] games that that we are now working on with them are games that they wanted to

[54:40] do for a long long time it was always just kind of a dream that they had the

[54:44] back of their mind but never really had the opportunity to do just because of

[54:47] who they're working for at the time or the limitations and and Robert's just

[54:52] been like yeah that sounds really cool let's let's figure out a way to do it

[54:57] and the thing is we have you know the the people that that have been hired like

[55:00] all the mechanical engineers and electrical engineers and everybody I mean

[55:04] everybody who works here is amazing at what they do they're like geniuses and

[55:08] and it's kind of a lot of the stuff is I do think a lot of it we have a really

[55:13] good mix of people that that know the history of pinball really really well but

[55:18] then there's also a lot of us that are new to pinball and because of that we we

[55:22] don't know any better we don't know that you quote unquote can't do something

[55:26] and so we just say yeah well let's figure out a way to do this and I'm just I'm

[55:31] blown away but the by the stuff that they're inventing and figuring out how to

[55:34] do and and and then to do more efficiently than has ever been done before so

[55:38] right and and and we've said this on this podcast before is sometimes there is a

[55:45] I don't know how to I want to put this properly but a lot of people that are

[55:49] still making pinball machines today are the same people that have been making

[55:54] them for 30 plus years right and I think there's value in that institutional

[55:58] knowledge of a pinball machine and design and when what works but it's also

[56:04] refreshing to hear that there's new people coming from outside the industry

[56:07] because you don't get outside the box thinking unless you actually go outside

[56:12] the box and so I think there's the expectations are high that that people are

[56:16] gonna see stuff that they haven't seen before and sometimes it's hard to get

[56:19] that when you're using the same people that have been making pinball year in

[56:23] year out for 30 plus years right right so question about storytelling and

[56:29] and you know you just mentioned that Robert is allowing a lot of the designers to

[56:34] sort of explore themes they've been thinking about for a long time which which

[56:38] you know leads people to think that these are people's passion projects that

[56:42] they you know have wanted to get off the ground for a long time what's the mix

[56:46] like between original themes and an IP because I know Robert said that you

[56:52] guys were celebrating that you secured an IP from the 80s is is it gonna be a

[56:57] balance of movies or other IPs that people are familiar with with original

[57:03] IPs what's it what's it like and as a storyteller you know if the story's

[57:08] already been told like just let's say for example top gun right there's no you

[57:13] don't have to it's more about how do we you know how do we transfer that

[57:17] story from film to pinball right and what what kind of balance are we gonna see

[57:22] from deep root um I would say that yes we do have some some you know IPs that

[57:30] people know and love which is really cool but I would say our heaviest

[57:35] focuses on is on developing our own original IP which is really cool really

[57:40] really cool to just be able to kind of come up with something that no one's ever

[57:43] done before um so yeah I would say the balance would shift more toward us

[57:48] toward original IP right yeah I mean and you know it's it's it's interesting

[57:54] because uh I think in a lot of levels it's refreshing for people you

[57:58] probably you you must have looked at like dialed in right and did are you

[58:01] familiar with dialed in because I was an original IP game from Pat Lawler at

[58:05] Jersey Jack Pimball do you ever look at some of this stuff Quinn and be like

[58:09] like like if only the story was better right because we hear a lot of criticism of like

[58:15] what is the story of that game and and it and it does feel like the story and the way it was

[58:21] executed kind of was kind of hurt what is otherwise an amazing pinball design right well

[58:29] well you know and so so I'm you know we have dialed in actually at our at our

[58:36] facility and you know everyone plays all the time and loves it um but yeah but I

[58:40] actually had to have someone like explain to me what the story was and uh and then when they

[58:45] did explain to me I was like oh it's kind of weird but okay you know right and so I you know

[58:52] I mean that's just an opinion thing but but yeah I it's a little it's a little hard for me to wrap

[58:57] my head around um so yeah I don't know yeah and and it was you know it's funny too because coming

[59:04] from comic books Jack actually handed out a comic book to explain the story um but no story will

[59:12] ever ever you know make up for a grown man with the wearing mom jeans with a dress shirt tucked

[59:19] into it holding up a seat you can't you can't you can't ever unsee that and so hopefully you

[59:25] know I look but I think it's important because people do want original IP and Pimball and some of

[59:30] the most magical games that people celebrate for example medieval madness attack for Mars monster

[59:38] bash right I mean you go down people's list of favorite games of all time and many of them

[59:44] are original stories but the way those stories were executed were so well done and so so

[59:50] Quint talked me about callouts because I feel that the callouts in Pimball are probably the best

[59:58] way to bring a game's personality to life how involved then are you with the script and the call

[01:00:03] outs of these games that's actually one of my biggest responsibilities is just to come up with all

[01:00:08] the voiceover callouts um yeah so that's that's a big big big part of what I do uh is just

[01:00:15] is just you know when we look at the rule set we look at what all the events the modes the features are

[01:00:19] and then you're like let's come up with all the dialogue that or the callouts that will that can be

[01:00:24] said or will be said right so yeah so that's totally what I'm doing all the time and then the other

[01:00:29] part which for some reason again I always wonder why people cut this corner who do you get to do the

[01:00:36] callouts because there are voice actors that are professionals at it and I think in Pimball sometimes

[01:00:42] like it's like the people sometimes like the designers themselves try to do most of the callouts are

[01:00:46] you guys working you know how serious are you taking the quality and nailing those callouts so it's

[01:00:51] like because it's hard to change them after you got them in right um you know so that part so

[01:00:57] the actual recording of the callouts uh that's something that then that is kind of the responsibility

[01:01:03] of uh David Teal and and our kind of our sound guys um you know they've been doing that for years

[01:01:09] and years they kind of know how the whole thing goes of of hiring talent and kind of what they're

[01:01:13] looking for so right so yeah so at that point they they kind of take care of that side of it um

[01:01:19] so obviously yeah it's there we're trying to make it as professional and good as we possibly can

[01:01:23] right coming from the world of video games and comics is there a story within those worlds that

[01:01:30] you would love to see made into a pinball game that you could sort of story correct yes well I would

[01:01:37] love to see uh I'm like so as far as video games go I'm a huge Castlevania fan um and so man if

[01:01:45] for some reason we got to do a Castlevania pinball game I would be all over that I would think

[01:01:52] that that would be super fun super cool oh yeah with the music and what's great too is like

[01:01:57] even like the you know the original graphics back in the day like that works so well on a screen too

[01:02:02] and uh how you guys toyed around with too so there's what do you what are your thoughts in terms of

[01:02:10] storytelling with with with video modes in pinball machines I know there's always a lot of debate

[01:02:15] about whether or not that breaks up the game whether or not it's you know how do you make it enjoyable

[01:02:20] but you could transform a pinball experience into a video game experience like

[01:02:25] intermittently throughout the experience what are your thoughts on that you like video modes or

[01:02:30] you're like now like why bother um you know I actually I really like video modes with the ones

[01:02:37] that I've seen so far like the one that comes to mind immediately was well because the the Dracula

[01:02:43] Brainstokers Dracula game that Barry Ausler did back in the 90s is just a super cool game and it's

[01:02:50] actually it's pretty close to what Castlevania is so of course I like it automatically um but like

[01:02:57] the video mode where you're you're shooting werewolves in a graveyard you know um that's super cool

[01:03:03] uh but that being said I think we kind of feel like a pinball game is a pinball game for a reason and

[01:03:12] um so so video modes are fun but they should not be the majority of the experience the

[01:03:18] the majority of the experience should be the actual physical pinball we're playing you know shooting

[01:03:22] the ball around and and focusing on that now part of when when deep root launch there was obviously the

[01:03:30] uh the residual baggage from the zidware error that I'm sure you're aware of and Robert

[01:03:37] said in contractual promise that there would they would have to deliver um some game right I think

[01:03:47] it's June of this year I you guys on pace to make sure that the zidware people who are you know part

[01:03:52] of the arrangement that they would uh have the ability to have some sort of restitution would would

[01:03:58] get some form of a game by June is that is that is are those games being pushed forward first because of that

[01:04:05] um that's honestly something that's like I I can't comment on but I honestly don't follow that at all

[01:04:11] god damn it Quinn is there a working magic girl's all I'm trying to ask now I'm like

[01:04:16] because I had a magic girl I had one in my apartment I paid 23,000 dollars for it isn't that crazy

[01:04:22] right I opened I opened it up and it didn't really work it's beautiful it's the most beautiful

[01:04:26] thing I've ever seen um sure but I tell people it was like sleeping with the playmate with

[01:04:30] her clothes on um it just wasn't quite what I was expected um so I'm definitely would you know

[01:04:39] can't wait to see what you guys do um with those titles so I mean what do you what do you think like

[01:04:45] 2019 is gonna be for you guys I mean you think this is gonna be the year where the world's gonna

[01:04:50] you know understand the vision of deep root or do you think we're gonna have to wait a little bit

[01:04:54] longer um I think we're we have some really awesome things planned for this year um I don't know

[01:05:01] I you know again I can't comment on what's coming out when or anything like that because that's

[01:05:06] all something that Robert's kind of tackling but but uh but yeah but I think we've got really

[01:05:11] really cool stuff um so as far as exact dates of revealing and Lisa and all that stuff goes I mean

[01:05:18] I'm not really the guy I know with like that exactly but uh but we are working on some super

[01:05:24] crazy cool stuff that people are gonna love have you played Pirate to the Caribbean Jersey Jackson

[01:05:28] you game do you guys have you guys spend any time on that you know I have not but I've watched

[01:05:33] a video of it so that's I know it's not the same thing but but uh I have not personally played it yet

[01:05:38] so that's a game that I've been hyper critical on of of of being too complex right that you walk

[01:05:44] up to the game and it's based on a movie franchise that I'm familiar with and then you select 22

[01:05:50] characters right do you feel like in pinball you know there's there's just a a flow when it comes

[01:05:58] to telling a story that needs to have some sort of pace to it and if you if you if you add too many

[01:06:04] layers you know sometimes I feel like these games are being designed for like home collectors but a

[01:06:08] game can be deep and approachable and I think that's what Lyman Sheets does so well uh but how do you

[01:06:14] get that balance right where we want to give someone who's gonna own this game for a really long time

[01:06:20] an experience that's not gonna grow old but it's not gonna be too complex if you guys thought about

[01:06:25] and then see the other thing I'm always confused about why why does code have to be like

[01:06:30] 1.0 and done like why not give people code updates every six months every year and create a

[01:06:37] whole new experience within that play field you know so that's a really good question I will say

[01:06:43] that we are definitely striving to tackle that um Steve is amazing at making these rule sets and

[01:06:49] and the big big focus has been how do we make rule sets that are gonna be fun and understandable and

[01:06:54] really compelling for someone who just plays the base game you know so when it just comes up and

[01:07:01] plays it and is new to pinball um but but to also give lots of like you said kind of additional

[01:07:07] content for people that that continue to play it that really invest in it and spend a lot of time

[01:07:11] and then they start unlocking more and more stuff that goes on top of that but we want to make sure that

[01:07:15] that that you know the the regular person who's just playing the pinball game um has a really

[01:07:22] satisfying really cool experience right uh so we're kind of we're yeah so we're definitely aware

[01:07:27] of that and that's a big priority that we're working on so in video games Quinn you know how even

[01:07:33] before you begin in a lot of games you can set the difficulty level sure right and and that's

[01:07:39] something that's really important right because set it too hard and it's completely frustrating and

[01:07:44] no one wants to play set it too easy it's too easy you know the hardcore game or gets bored pinball

[01:07:50] machines have a really they don't allow you to do that and and and the only area where they allow

[01:07:56] people to do that I think are two areas you can usually go in and put it to five ball or seven ball

[01:08:04] right so you can increase your ball amount but whenever you do that people make fun of you

[01:08:07] and then you can lower your outlaying post right so there's like there's a physical thing you can

[01:08:12] do and there's a software thing you can do but no one's ever allowed you to go up to a pinball

[01:08:16] machine and just say I just want to put it in beginner mode and let's say we're talking about

[01:08:21] Batman 66 and then in beginner mode it's really set up for a very simple objective maybe the

[01:08:28] crane swings out and it's all about like who can hit the crane the most time in five minutes

[01:08:32] just to get people familiar with the game with the shots have you guys been tackling that were

[01:08:37] you know most of these games now are being made for the hardcore pain head who who who who can

[01:08:43] dive deep into the code but when you're trying to introduce people to pinball I find most of these

[01:08:48] modern machines to be completely incapable of of giving a newbie that an experience right no and

[01:08:57] I totally agree I totally agree with again just in the short time that I've been in the pinball

[01:09:02] world I totally agree yeah so I just think yeah it's something that that everything that people

[01:09:08] will grab about with pinball that has been driving people crazy we we really examine all that and

[01:09:13] and then see what we can do to not have that and to solve that problem. Having not seen any deep

[01:09:20] root machine or anything should we expect a deep root machine to look like the pinball machines

[01:09:27] that are out there today or is there going to be anything just completely different we've never

[01:09:32] seen before within a pinball package. Well one of the things that we're really excited about that

[01:09:37] I probably shouldn't tell you about but I will is that these pinball machines actually are built to

[01:09:43] hover so you can actually get on top and ride it from home to work. Here I was thinking we're

[01:09:49] going to get something. I'm a big fan this is just a weird thing about me but I love pinball

[01:09:55] toppers and I've always thought the topper is a piece of real estate that is underdeveloped and

[01:10:00] underutilized within the storyline of a game and it's a great piece of real estate and I'm always

[01:10:05] I'm always like why don't companies do more with like interacting with the topper

[01:10:11] when while you're playing the game. Is you guys will we see toppers is that part as you walk around

[01:10:16] the deep root factory are we seeing machines with something on top that also creates a more like

[01:10:22] visually stunning part of the game. I will say we've definitely we've definitely talked about it.

[01:10:27] Yeah. Okay. Well look Quinn I really appreciate the time. I know this. I did not expect you to come

[01:10:35] on to be like Chris here's the 80s IP we got. Chris here's when we're releasing this here's you know

[01:10:41] I know I don't expect that. We keep hearing these good things. I mean I always say this I don't

[01:10:47] think this is another zidware vaporware journey. I mean not many people have seen behind your

[01:10:54] curtain but the ones who have continue to say good things. So so Quinn there's about like 1500

[01:11:01] to 2000 pinball collectors who listen to this show. What would you like to tell them about should

[01:11:07] they hold on to their money and wait to see what it comes from you guys or should they keep just

[01:11:11] buying the next from everyone else we know. Oh I would say I would say if you want to buy stuff to

[01:11:19] tie yourself over because you want to do that and that's and you have the money to do that then

[01:11:24] that's that's totally up to you but I will say you're it's totally going to be worth the wait.

[01:11:29] All right. But I think that's a good place to end with excitement and curiosity. I mean this is

[01:11:36] this is where we're at. I mean just so you know Quinn I'm fully expecting Robert to show up with

[01:11:42] something on tpf. There's just I just that's just my speculation but I think Robert is not going to

[01:11:47] let his backyard be dominated by the competitors but anything else Quinn that you know is going on

[01:11:54] that you can share that you think would be interesting to the people who have been waiting

[01:11:58] anxiously to see what deeproot is up to. Oh golly. Does anyone sleep in the deeproot factory? Is

[01:12:08] there like I always feel like there's a J-pop bunk bed somewhere where they're like

[01:12:14] no but we do have a workout facility so that's kind of cool. Who's in the gym?

[01:12:22] I'm always advocating that people should work out as much as they play pinball because I think health

[01:12:26] is the most important thing in life but when I go to shows clearly nobody takes my advice.

[01:12:31] Right well people also bring in donuts a lot so there's that so they might just cancel each other out.

[01:12:36] Are people sitting there like throughout the night like is it just like you know everyone's just so

[01:12:42] excited like there's not like this is not a nine to five joint it's just you know people burning

[01:12:48] them in nine oil making these things happen or what. You know if there are I don't know who they are

[01:12:54] but definitely people just strive to use their time as effectively as possible. We may get to that

[01:12:59] point I don't really know what the future is going to hold but yeah I don't feel like there's anybody

[01:13:04] that's feeling if you're kind of asking if people are like stressed out of their minds and working

[01:13:12] crazy hours to try to take care of everything I don't feel like that's the feeling like there's not

[01:13:18] a feeling of because I've been in some companies where it was crunch time and it's just like everyone's

[01:13:23] just exhausted and so sick of this whole thing and just wants it to go away and we don't have

[01:13:28] anything like that at all it's just an awesome place to be it was really really great people so

[01:13:32] and work on stuff that really loves it. Thank you and this is your full time job right I mean this is

[01:13:37] this is where you're at now. This is it yeah. All right and you come from Salt Lake City. Correct huh?

[01:13:44] Do you know anyone it do you know any that like the guys over at chair entertainment like Donald

[01:13:48] Mossard I'm just asking you like off the cup questions but I used to work with those guys over there

[01:13:53] at chair entertainment you know who that is like the video game guys yeah I know of them I'm sure

[01:13:59] that I worked with people that worked there actually it's ringing a bell but I can't think of

[01:14:03] I can't think anyone's so they did they did advent rising from a Jessica nothing Donald's gonna

[01:14:07] do like infinity blade that yeah epic games with like cliffy being all those crazy guys well look

[01:14:16] Quinn this has been a pleasure thank you for taking the time I think everyone realizes that

[01:14:21] you can't disclose too much and it's gonna be an interesting 2019 there are a lot of companies

[01:14:28] trying to be competitive in Pimble and I've been saying on the show that I think that deep

[01:14:34] rude has to you know they have to come out with something special or the whole thing will

[01:14:37] will fall flat on launch so it sounds like what you guys are seeing is gonna be worth the wait

[01:14:43] is that fair to say to the listeners absolutely absolutely yeah well I told I told Robert I mean I

[01:14:53] want I still want a working magic girl so if it ever happens I told them I want game number one

[01:15:01] or two whichever he'll give me but and then in terms of pricing Quinn like I have you guys as

[01:15:06] you're doing all this design and you know Pimble pricing you see these games right you see like

[01:15:10] a game can be five thousand dollars then Beatles is like twenty five thousand dollars like

[01:15:15] where within the marketplace are you trying to go are you you guys gonna try to offer games

[01:15:20] within a variety of prices everything from pro to collector pricing yeah well kind of the way

[01:15:27] that we that I've looked at it is it's kind of like when the we came out how suddenly it was

[01:15:34] introduced a it was accessible to people that had never really been into video games before like

[01:15:39] there were still systems out there for people that were super hardcore that didn't plan for

[01:15:42] ever and but there are people that like this kind of this untapped group of people that that suddenly

[01:15:50] got introduced to something that was really easily accessible and really fun I we're I would say

[01:15:56] that we are trying to hit both those demographics you know make make Pimble accessible the people that

[01:16:01] have never played you know families and and and stuff but then also have lots of really cool stuff

[01:16:07] that will that will be more made that might be more interesting to people that are for hardcore

[01:16:12] that I'm playing it for a long time so we're really trying to hit hit all those different groups of

[01:16:16] people and find something you know that provide something that everyone will really really like so

[01:16:21] all right well Quinn thank you for taking the time I appreciate it I look forward to seeing what

[01:16:28] you guys come up with and hopefully we'll we'll get you back on the show when we have more

[01:16:34] specific games to talk about so we can deconstruct the storylines you've worked on but we'll just

[01:16:40] consider this an introduction to a Canadian Spinball podcast and and to to deeproot but you guys have

[01:16:46] everyone's curiosity peaked so we hope you guys deliver oh we haven't got absolutely we will

[01:16:52] and and we're just we're so excited to get to the point where we can like really dig into everything

[01:16:57] that we've been working on because yeah it's like I think it's like we stars that that like

[01:17:02] filmed a really high profile movie that was like for them it was a year ago but they still kind

[01:17:06] of talk about it until the movie starts coming out and that would drive them crazy and so yeah

[01:17:10] that's how a lot of us feel so we're just really really excited when this stuff becomes more public

[01:17:15] knowledge and then we can really dig into it with people so awesome we'll be we will be the first

[01:17:20] podcast to cover when any news happens we do that I do about three shows a week which is unhealthy

[01:17:25] but it gets a lot of people news well Quinn thank you so much have an awesome night and I hope
