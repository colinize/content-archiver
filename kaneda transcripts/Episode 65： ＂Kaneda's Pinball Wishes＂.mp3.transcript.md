[00:00] Are you looking at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here?

[00:05] And all of a sudden you're walking out on me? I don't think so. Not right now.

[00:10] You're getting your wishes so slow!

[00:12] Ow!

[00:13] The weirdest thing happened to me late last night. I was standing over my tails of the

[00:24] Arabian nights and I was a little delirious and all of a sudden it started to

[00:30] all get a little blurry and foggy and the genie just looked at me. His eyes were

[00:36] glowing blue and he said,

[00:37] Canada, I will grant you some pinball wishes. And I was like, are you serious man?

[00:43] Am I drunk right now? You're gonna grant me some pinball wishes and he said,

[00:47] yes, Canada, what do you wish would happen in the world of pinball? And I was like,

[00:55] awesome, do I have a number of wishes? And he's like, nope, you can make as many pinball

[00:59] wishes as you would like and I will try and grant them. So in this episode of

[01:06] Canada's pinball podcast I am going to tell you what my pinball wishes would be

[01:12] if I could have them. And these are no particular order again it was late last

[01:17] night and I was just saying these things as they popped into my head. But my first wish,

[01:23] I wish that the Chicago gaming company would just go away! Remaking the old

[01:29] games during this period of new machines makes no sense to me at all, genie.

[01:35] It's fun having older grail games for collectors to chase after. Sure, medieval

[01:40] madness remake is better than medieval madness genie. But now, medieval madness

[01:46] has stopped being a special game. There's just no way around that. If we keep

[01:50] remaking these games, they're not going to be special anymore. And let's just let

[01:55] the old classics be just that and have people chase after them and find ones in

[02:02] great condition and restore ones that are in poor condition into great condition

[02:08] again. Can you grant me that wish, genie? Alright, what else did I ask the genie for?

[02:14] Genie? I wish that those damn minion pinball updates every Friday would just stop! It was

[02:22] cute for the first 10 years when these guys inundated Fridays threads with their updates,

[02:28] but this machine is never going to get done. I'm tired of those fucking updates. Just

[02:36] stop them. How about take a pause and reveal the final game when you're done? Will all

[02:41] be waiting in the year 2030 when that happens? Alright, what else do I wish? I wish that

[02:52] Stern would become more detailed oriented. Can you make that happen, genie? And what

[02:57] I mean by that, I wish that nobody at Stern would ever consider store-bought toys going

[03:04] into their machines. It is embarrassing, it is cheap, and we are past the point of them

[03:12] looking utterly lazy and pathetic when they do this. Right? I wish they would also look

[03:18] at just the details on their games more and figure out a way to make sure none of these

[03:24] high-price games are shipping where there's just details that look like they're lazy

[03:30] and cutting corners. This started for me too when they started putting the LE plaques

[03:35] on the back boxes and they didn't really match up the artwork with the LE plaque. It's

[03:42] like that's just laziness. You're just putting on an old plaque onto a new speaker panel

[03:48] platform and it just looks terrible. Even when I look at the new back box area of Stern,

[03:56] it looks like they just threw everything in and didn't really step back and say, wait

[04:03] a minute, is this the best way we can make an LCD and speaker and LE plaque look altogether?

[04:10] It looks so just like lazy, right? They just don't look at these things with the visual

[04:17] eye and say, how can we make the speaker panel? It's just like two big black bars next

[04:24] to that Batman LCD. I think if you compare that to the way that Jersey Jack Back box looks

[04:31] and how nice those speakers and screen and Jersey Jack logo and the way everything is

[04:36] framed is just gorgeous compared to what Stern is doing. I think Stern is just cutting

[04:43] corners and is lazy. Now Stern, I wish, Genie, I pray that Stern would become more detail-oriented

[04:50] and stop cutting those corners and making things look as good as they can because they're

[04:56] charging so much more than they used to and we deserve better. All right, what else do I wish?

[05:03] Genie, I wish that Magic Girl owners finally get their games in 2016. This is probably the most

[05:11] difficult wish I know for you to grant Genie. Even the Genie is fucking terrified of John

[05:17] Papa Duke. Not even the Genie's powers can make John finally finish a game. I also wish that

[05:23] people, if they're going to point a finger at someone to blame for Magic Girl not coming out,

[05:30] the finger needs to be pointed at John and John only. Do not blame Bill Brandis. Do not say that

[05:38] his legal actions are keeping Magic Girl out. Do not blame American pinball for being conned or

[05:46] duped into this situation. Do not blame Joe Balser for not being able to complete it. The only

[05:53] person to blame is John Papa Duke. He needs to finish this game. All right, and then he needs to move

[06:00] on and figure out his plan with American pinball to get Ross and Alice people whole. You want to hear

[06:06] something scary and this just terrified me. But I was able to talk to John recently and it's just,

[06:15] I don't think the game's done. I'm still hearing about things being worked on and parts being

[06:21] needed to be ordered and ball hang-ups and tinkering that's going on. And that terrifies me. I think

[06:27] this is a world championship soccer situation where Joe Balser needs to just rip Magic Girl away

[06:33] from John over the next eight weeks and just finish it off and not let him work on it anymore.

[06:40] And I hope it goes out and whatever condition it's in, I think people will be happy that they

[06:45] just have something physical. So I hope, Jeannie, you can grant that wish. What else do I wish? I wish

[06:52] that Robin would actually listen to this podcast and realize that Canada's pinball podcast

[07:00] attacks pin-siders far less than the people do on his own site, right? Pinball people are far

[07:07] more mean to each other on pin-side than what they get on Canada's pinball podcast. And that is

[07:13] Robin's main excuse for banning me, for banning links to my podcast. He keeps saying, Canada, you're

[07:20] so, you're, you're personally attack members of my site and not because of that, I cannot let you

[07:25] back on. And I wish he would listen to these episodes. I wish he would listen to the, I, I don't

[07:30] think there has been anything egregious, especially since we've come back from our summer hiatus.

[07:36] And I think if he asked a simple question, has pin-side become more positive? Has there been less

[07:42] drama since I left? Has there been less personal attacks against each other since Canada was ban?

[07:48] Nope, I don't think so. So Jeannie, I wish that Canada could be let back onto pin-side and 2017

[07:57] and we could see what is the worst that would happen if that occurred. I think it would be

[08:03] awesome. All right, what else? He's like, Canada, give me some more wishes. All right, so I wish

[08:09] that Kevin Koolik could be transformed into roles of toilet paper and we each could buy a role

[08:18] and flush his ass down the toilet every time we wiped. Every time I see this guy's name,

[08:25] skip-by thread, I just get nauseous. We need to accept the fact that this guy is the devil,

[08:33] was the devil and stole everyone's money and is not going to give it back. Now what I hate the

[08:40] most about Kevin is unlike John and I know everyone tries to compare these two guys. You know,

[08:46] like I don't think, I think John was really trying to make these machines and got in over his head

[08:51] and has no idea how to make stuff. I think Kevin knew how to make this game, but the point that

[08:55] really showed me this guy was just the ultimate nefarious being is even when he realized the

[09:01] license went belly up and he wasn't going to be able to get it, he was sitting on a large chunk of

[09:07] money, a large chunk and he promised everyone refunds and instead of doing that, even if he couldn't

[09:13] refund people one to one, he went off and he tried to hide the money, he tried to send the money

[09:19] overseas, he tried to buy things with that money, he tried to buy his, he bought his wife a house,

[09:23] I think with that money and for that, Jeannie, I wish we could turn Kevin into toilet paper rolls

[09:30] and just flush his ass every single day. What else? I wish that highway Pimball could get its

[09:39] act together, Jeannie and I said that I want to, you know, I hope these guys get their game out,

[09:44] but Jeannie, here's a few things I wish they could do in the near future that would just make

[09:49] everybody happy. I wish highway Pimball could actually show and tell people exactly what they're

[09:56] buying with their money, right? If you go on the thread lately, it's just this ridiculous process

[10:02] where the whole community is giving suggestions on what the Ellie should be, how the fuck is the

[10:08] Ellie still not figured out what the package is? Andrew, you've been taking money deposits,

[10:15] $1,500 deposits on Ellie and Ellie Pimball and you still have no idea what the package is?

[10:24] What the fuck have you guys been doing over there? I'm sorry, this is not a personal attack,

[10:30] this is just a business statement. How exactly are your payments working, guys?

[10:37] People don't even know how to give you money now. It seems that their payment mechanism was hacked,

[10:44] that all these weird emails went out, that were putting people's private information in jeopardy.

[10:50] I wish people would not pay any additional money until production has actually started on this

[10:57] game. That was the contract that consumers were told they would enter into to get a game, is

[11:05] we're not going to ask for more money until production begins. When I keep reading that all

[11:10] these dingle berries are sending in money without production having started, it makes me think that

[11:18] Pimball buyers are knee-and-er-thal morons. Seriously, why would you pay in fall or give more money

[11:27] when the milestone hasn't hit yet? Right? He said not until production starts, production has

[11:34] started and you get these idiot guys like, I paid in fall. Hey, I'm the biggest alien fan out there,

[11:40] I paid in full a year ago. Nobody gives you shit when you paid in fall guys. When you stop doing that,

[11:48] you only look like an idiot when you pay in fall for a game long before you have to and then you

[11:55] can't get your money back if something goes wrong. So stop patting yourselves on the back, you're

[12:01] really just sticking your thumb up your butts when you tell people you paid in fall already.

[12:05] All right, and the final thing I wish is that alien Pimball would stop running advertisements,

[12:12] Genie, that the game is released. Did you guys see this? Did you see this? There are banner ads that say

[12:20] alien Pimball released with a, you know, ability to click on it and buy it. Released? What was released?

[12:28] The game is not even finished and they're running ads to get people's pre-order dollars.

[12:34] How nobody calls this out as being disingenuous marketing, disingenuous advertising is beyond me.

[12:45] I know people have raised red flags that Angie really needs money to make this happen and maybe

[12:52] that's the case. But I do love how the fanboys completely ignore something like that that they

[12:58] are running ads to collect pre-order dollars saying the game is released. That is false advertising.

[13:08] And you know that those, those ads are not designed for Pimball fans. They're designed for just

[13:13] alien people who are out there that don't know any better and they're trying to get people's money

[13:19] to get locked in and those people are not on Pinside and so if you just tell them like oh there's

[13:24] a, you know, two to three weeks, they're not, they're not going to know that it's been delayed a year or two.

[13:29] So I just think that is wrong and I wish that would stop. All right, I also wish, Genie, we're

[13:37] changing gears a little bit. I wish John Trudeau would stop with his ridiculous flipper gap. I wish

[13:45] George Gomez and Stern would tie this man up in a chair, slap him around and someone needs to

[13:51] grow a pair over there and say John for fucksakes enough already. Nobody likes the fucking flipper gap

[13:58] guys. Nobody in any game ever. There is no point in having a flipper gap that is that big that

[14:07] removes the fun of the machine. I mean this man almost single handedly ruined the greatest Pimball

[14:14] theme Stern has ever had. Roomed it. Nobody likes it and then he doesn't put a center post and then

[14:21] he's lazy on his out lane post, right? This guy needs to stop. All right, this needs to be the last

[14:27] game where that gap measures that big and I don't care. Gary, George, Jody, Jared, John, whoever over

[14:36] there has a brain needs to stop doing this. You know, you don't fucking purposely make a game

[14:47] frustrating and unfair and silly. It is so dumb that they allow that to happen. I, for the life of

[14:54] me and I love how on Stern's own Ghostbusters machine, they put the longer carrot flippers on.

[15:00] So when people visit, they have a better experience. I just think it's ridiculous and Genie I wish

[15:06] that if he does this again, he's fired from the Pimball industry forever because it's just

[15:12] irresponsible for him to do that. All right, what else do I wish? I have a few more wishes. You

[15:17] know, it's late night. I'm drinking coffee, you know, and this is important stuff. I hope all

[15:22] these wishes come true. All right, I wish that people would just stop sharing with us how the

[15:31] damn Pimball sausage is made. I don't care how Pimball companies are made. I wish every company would

[15:40] show what they were working on when it's ready. All right, I wish people would take people's money

[15:47] when there's a game inside a box. All right, I wish every single deposit that has to take place on

[15:54] a Pimball machine is $500 or less and is always refundable. There is no period where you can't get

[16:03] your money back. I think that's ridiculous. Okay, I also wish that Home Pin was actually in people's

[16:13] homes and not endlessly updating us from China for years. All right, I don't understand. This

[16:24] is all about how the sausage is made, right? Is Mike really going to share with us every single

[16:30] part he fabricates endlessly? All right, I just saw one on the drop targets. Mike, stop. Nobody

[16:39] wants to see everything in every little piece slowly come together. I'm sorry, that's not how you reveal

[16:46] and get people excited for something. There is no other toy in this world. There's no other company

[16:51] that when they want to get someone excited about a product, they release every little piece as it's

[16:57] being made. And you could argue that this is Pimball and that marketing and Pimball doesn't have to

[17:02] take the normal course. But I would argue against that. I think you get one chance to really

[17:08] excite people with your product. And I don't think these guys are doing it right. And look, Home Pin,

[17:15] they need pin number one to be a hit. All the money that's going into making this big company.

[17:21] And it's Thunderbirds. All right, I wish that these guys have pin number two and three ready to go

[17:29] because we've seen it, man. You Thunderbirds, full throttle, America's most honoured. If you come

[17:35] out of the gate with a theme that's going to struggle to get traction, you're not going to have a

[17:41] company. So I wish these guys would understand that title number one needs to be the hit. It's not

[17:46] the beginning pick for titles two, three and four. If you're first title is a flop and you're

[17:51] going to be dead, there's no future. There's too many companies out there. So, Jeannie, I hope you can

[17:56] wake these guys up and remind them that theme is everything for title number one. All right, what else

[18:03] did I wish for? I wish Jack would stop being such a sleazy salesman at times. He acts like we

[18:12] are all stupid and have absolutely no memory of what he's done before. Right? He treats us as if

[18:21] every new game we forgot what he did with the last game. But people aren't falling for his tactics

[18:27] again. Are they? Seven thousand limited editions of dialed in. What is limited about that? A

[18:37] twelve thousand five hundred dollar collector's edition? Really? Really? Now he's going to make an

[18:44] announcement this Saturday at one o'clock. And I bet he's going to announce that there's a standard

[18:50] edition of dialed in that is a little bit cheaper. I bet he makes some announcement about

[18:57] limited edition numbers or collector edition numbers. I don't think he's going to change the name.

[19:04] I do wish Jeannie that the name would be changed the quantum city. I'd be happy if he would do that.

[19:10] I can't see Jack doing that because of all the materials and things they've done already

[19:16] to support dialed in. It would just be a lot of work for them to re-skine this whole thing. I don't

[19:21] think it's as easy as people think. So I wish Jack would change his tune and stop trying to pull

[19:29] this shit over and over again with multiple editions. Pricing that's all over the place.

[19:34] Consumers are always in the dark about what they're getting. Jack we've seen you do it three times.

[19:39] This is this is it. You're not you're not going to fool us again.

[19:43] But he probably is. People are probably going to still going on the game regardless.

[19:47] All right. I wish that Beasel Boob and Center Flank would come back to Pinside. The place just

[19:53] isn't the same without them. Guys, I don't know where you are but I hope you come back. I do think

[19:59] that people get burnt the fuck out on Pinside and for those hyper users who literally go on

[20:05] every day and post 20, 30 times a day, this site consumes them. And you start to get this you start

[20:13] to make pinball more important than it really is in the world. And be let's be honest everyone out

[20:18] there. It begins to fuck up your priorities in life. It begins to fuck up your relationships with

[20:24] your friends and family. And it begins to just alter like your reality, right? You start to think

[20:32] buying $10,000 or pinball machines is a good financial decision. You start to put this thing at the

[20:39] center of the universe and it's really not. It shouldn't be nowhere near the center of your

[20:43] universe. All right. What else we got here? I wish every Pinsiders net worth would appear under

[20:50] their name on Pinside, right? Right underneath their avatar and their initials and there's a little

[20:55] net worth. So we could see how much every mother fucker is really worth. And then once and for all,

[21:01] we'd finally know if wise snow could afford more than one expo outfit. It'd be amazing. We could

[21:08] we could understand if Kenny really afford that bunker filled with 150 Pins underneath his house

[21:13] that he wants to build. We'd also know who really is able to buy the pins in each thread instead of

[21:19] all the cry babies who say I'm out. I'm not going dialed in. I'm out. Motherfucker, you ain't never

[21:25] in to dialed in. They'd be at these motherfuckers might have a net worth of like in the negative. They

[21:31] might not even have any money. They might be up the wazoo and debt. They might have $5,000 to the name.

[21:36] And we got these jerkeys like all telling us like that's it. I ain't in on a dialed in.

[21:41] Clicked his edition. Fuck these guys. You ain't never in on anything new, man. And we now we know it.

[21:47] The only people that should buy a $10,000 pinball machine should have should have at least at least

[21:58] $100,000 in savings. Right. Does that scare some of you out there? That you should not have 10%

[22:07] of your net worth tied up in a single pinball machine. That probably is freaking some of you the

[22:13] fuck out. But I don't believe that anyone, anyone should be buying something this expensive who

[22:22] doesn't have at least 90% more of their finances in better places in more responsible savings areas.

[22:32] Did I just piss some people off? I don't know. Do I have $100,000 in savings? Maybe you never know.

[22:40] But I save. I do my 401k. I put money aside each month that I don't even see. It's yanked.

[22:46] One page that gets yanked right into savings. I don't think that pinball should be your primary savings.

[22:52] All right. What else did I wish? Here's one. I wish Hobbit code would be complete so that we can

[22:58] once and for all agree that this game has no satisfying shots regardless of code. The game is not

[23:04] great. It's code 1.9. I heard the code's almost done. Great. Great. Because when it's finally done,

[23:10] when the code is finally finished, then we can stop making excuses for this pin. We can just look

[23:16] at it the way it is meant to be looked at as an open play field with not much to shoot at and a

[23:21] pretty pointless upper flipper. When you see the Hobbit next to Dial then, you're going to realize

[23:27] that my God, it's like Baron compared to Dial then. When you shoot Dial then, you're going to realize

[23:35] how much better it shoots than the Hobbit. So much better. I think Jack should have asked Pat

[23:42] for advice on the Hobbit design because it's fucking terrible compared to Dial then. All right.

[23:48] I wish Nate would podcast more often. I'd love Nate's podcast. I don't want to live in a world

[23:54] where we only get one a month. In fact, one of my other wishes might come true. I want it

[23:59] Nate to be a guest on my show and Nate shot me an email back and said, let's do it. So we're

[24:05] going to do it soon. I'm super excited to get Nate on the show. I wish pinball podcasts as

[24:11] of the world would realize tournament play is the worst topic for conversation on a podcast.

[24:17] Make a freaking YouTube video showing the shots and the love of God stop podcasting about it. Right.

[24:24] For all of my pinball podcasters out there and there's a lot of you now, I think you need to

[24:30] always ask yourself if is what I'm doing now in audio journey or a visual journey. If it's a

[24:38] visual journey you want to take people on do not podcast that it's that simple. All right.

[24:48] I also wish Genie that people would stop saying AeroSmith is in popular and Stern's new machine

[24:55] is going to flop. Let me remind people with some facts, right? Data, information. AeroSmith is

[25:05] the best selling American hard rock band of all time. They have sold more than 150 million

[25:14] records worldwide including over 70 million records in the United States alone.

[25:22] So for all of you out there who say that AeroSmith is not as big as Metallica, ACD, DC,

[25:29] this and that they are fucking ginormous and there are tons of AeroSmith fans out there.

[25:36] They might be a little queasy about revealing that because I know AeroSmith is a little cheesy but

[25:41] you know what? Who doesn't watch Armageddon and listen to you know that I don't want to close my

[25:46] eyes song. I mean come on it gets me every time when he's playing like with the animal crackers on

[25:51] her belly. I'm weeping like a baby and so and so are you guys. I know you guys are.

[25:56] All right what else a few more wishes I granted the Genie then I passed out. All right I wish

[26:03] people would stop saying the alien pinball video is amazing right? Seriously do we all live in

[26:11] the same world? Is the sky blue in everyone's world? Do we all breathe the same error? Do we?

[26:17] have we all experienced what good content is? I want you guys to think about your favorite movie trailer.

[26:24] Right? Look at the new Logan trailer for Wolverine. It's incredible. Look at the trailer for the

[26:30] Force Awakens. The things that give you goosebumps and make you like want to wait and and

[26:37] it almost make it so it's like hard to sleep because you're thinking so much about that two-minute

[26:41] video that is getting you excited about something and then go play the alien pinball video that

[26:47] they released and I think I'm not annoyed that they did it. I'm glad that they made the video so

[26:51] this is not a knock on highway for giving us like glimpse at the game. This is a knock on pinball

[26:58] people who are claiming this is like one of like the greatest pinball launch videos ever made.

[27:05] Right? This video if you ask me as a marketer is such a mess because simply isn't the whole point

[27:13] of alien pinball to immerse us in the world. This dark sort of survival space horror movie

[27:21] and the video that they show is like in a brightly lit room everything is like brightness

[27:29] through the roof nothing feels like dark immersive space spacey at all and it just looks like they

[27:37] threw the ball around the play field like they were taking you with their hand and tossing it and

[27:41] then quickly grabbing it. I don't know I just when I saw people think like this is the best pinball

[27:46] marketing there is I really am just like fuck it like this hobby is never going to have good marketing

[27:52] because again it just feels like a bunch of neanderthals who don't even understand what good

[27:56] content is they don't understand it and I also you know felt that way when I was at Expo in the

[28:03] way when you went to some of these seminars for those of you who are at the highway one I mean

[28:09] Andrew got up there and just clicked on memes alien memes pictures of alien memes from the internet

[28:16] and it was just like this weird silence for like 10 minutes as he like walked us through like

[28:21] funny alien things he found on the internet like that's how you want to market your game

[28:27] how about you shut the fucking lights off in the seminar room make it pitch black and blast the

[28:33] alien theme song and roll out the game with like a spot like like there is no good marketers in

[28:42] this world right and that's the other wish I started to have because again like I'm very passionate

[28:47] about that stuff when it comes to all this marketing all right this is this is like one of my

[28:53] favorite wishes that I asked a genie I wish people would stop saying the words launch and release

[29:02] unless they were actually doing those two things now we talked about alien running advertisements

[29:08] saying it's released now but I saw also there's going to be all these dialed in launch parties in a

[29:15] couple weeks can what what what I would be there a launch party should not happen nine months before

[29:25] a game ships right people don't attend a space shuttle launch arrive there and just stare at the

[29:34] fucking rocket for nine months waiting for it to ignite right launch ready for launch these words

[29:43] matter right they matter and they're used in a way to deceive people about timeline right dialen

[29:51] is not launching nor is alien release so stop manipulating people with their words to steal money

[30:00] right to get people falsely excited what look dialed in looks really far along

[30:07] um and we're told jack's ordering parts but if anything people please jack stockpiled hobbit parts

[30:16] for two years before the games actually started going out I'm not saying that's going to happen

[30:21] again but it happened the first two times so if you have a friend every time you say hi to him he

[30:27] kicks you between the legs aren't you gonna hesitate to go up and say hi to him again I just

[30:33] think people need to realize that they ain't no launch parties these are just like these are dialed

[30:38] in parties you know they're further beta parties they're dialed in test runs they call them

[30:44] anything but a launch party I just don't get it uh what else did I have any more wishes my final wish

[30:53] is I wish people would realize that people are ten times more fun than a pinball machine ten times

[31:00] most game rooms in america are dark the majority of the time most collectors out there never turn on

[31:08] their pinball machines until people come over because people make those games new again and people

[31:15] give those toys a purpose so I wish everyone genie would be more respectful to each other on

[31:23] pinside and in life I wish people hear this spend a day off the fucking forms just turn off the

[31:30] forms you know in fact I wish everybody out there would spend a week off of pinside spend one

[31:35] week off of pinside just don't post take a break from pinside for a week and measure how much more

[31:42] happier your life would be and will and it and it and it becomes because it will how much more

[31:49] you actually will play your games versus keyboard commando arguing about them you will enjoy them

[31:56] so much more you will invite friends over to play and share beer and have a good time but when

[32:03] you turn it off and you actually just look at these things as the toys they are and realize that

[32:09] it's people that make these toys sing uh you'll have a lot more fun you will also realize you don't

[32:15] need so many you don't need to collect and hoard and chase because so much of what the collector

[32:22] mindset is is being someone to someone else and someone said this in the you know American pinball

[32:29] magical thread so much of it is ego driven I have something you don't have the only place people

[32:35] give a shit or the only place people can even show what someone has that someone else doesn't have

[32:40] is on these forums where people start to think like oh rodo davis a cool dude because he's got

[32:46] 150 machines and this guy's got the super early Batman coming and this guy's got a magic girl

[32:52] nobody gives a shit except for this small small group of people and when you let go of caring what

[32:59] these people think you stop chasing after these things there comes a point where if you can't be

[33:06] satisfied with just a few pins in your home you need 50 a hundred you've got a disease you've

[33:13] got something wrong with you you don't need that many machines to enjoy them to have people over

[33:20] to enjoy them and you start to think that these things matter more than other important things in

[33:25] the world now if you're super buggy loaded and that doesn't matter then all then yes like I'm sure

[33:30] you have other things going on in your world right so just remember you're all gonna die someday

[33:36] and when you die someone's gonna fuck up your shooter lane someone's not gonna clipy that scoop

[33:43] someone's gonna chip all the clear code someone's actually gonna flip these things so don't

[33:49] fucking treat them like museum pieces that don't get flipped stop fucking holding on the pins for

[33:54] two or three years people and then trying to sell them with under 200 plays genie I wish nobody

[34:01] could market their game as being under 200 plays or 200 plays or less we all know what you mother

[34:06] fuckers do you update the code you play it 200 times and then you try and sell it as if you only

[34:12] played it 200 times all this fucking trick in the book people matter more than pinball enjoy your

[34:19] machines enjoy your friends show each other respect peace and love from canada hold on to your

[34:27] money until games are in boxes and you'll all be much happier enjoy your Saturday we have an
