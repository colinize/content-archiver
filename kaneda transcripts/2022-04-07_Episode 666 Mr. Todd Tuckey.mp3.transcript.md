[00:00] Finally, it's happened to me right in front of my face.

[00:04] My feelings can describe it.

[00:07] CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA

[00:10] Aw, welcome to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:13] I'm your host, Kaneda, and I'm just feeling really happy.

[00:16] We have 451 club members, and I've enjoyed doing this show

[00:21] over the last six months more than I've enjoyed doing the show

[00:25] over the last six years.

[00:27] And I go back to being an expo and burning the hatchet

[00:30] with Zach Many and just deciding that I love talking

[00:34] about pinball.

[00:35] I love talking about pinball every week

[00:37] for each and every one of you.

[00:38] I love interviewing people in the pinball community,

[00:41] and I just love this podcast.

[00:43] It is the one thing in my life, and I mean it.

[00:45] It's the one thing.

[00:46] I have total creative control over,

[00:49] and I am so thankful for each and every one of you

[00:51] for joining the Kaneda Club and getting these shows

[00:54] on a weekly basis.

[00:55] I can't even express how much it means,

[00:58] and I am so happy to give you a great interview.

[01:02] The first interview with Mr. Todd Tucky

[01:05] after pulling off his long overdue,

[01:08] his finally being recognized by the Pinball Awards shows,

[01:12] I can't believe that he has not won an award

[01:14] for his incredible content over all of these years,

[01:17] but finally he was recognized at the 2021 Twippies,

[01:21] and Todd's a great guy.

[01:23] And I think you're really going to enjoy this interview.

[01:25] And I'm gonna be doing more interviews,

[01:27] but I think Kaneda's Pinball podcast

[01:29] is hitting a stride like never before,

[01:31] and I love it because you guys get to enjoy it,

[01:34] and everyone else out there, all the critics,

[01:36] all the haters, all the people that thought

[01:38] that this show would go in a different direction.

[01:40] I think they're missing out on what is now, arguably,

[01:44] I think the most entertaining and the best version

[01:47] of this show I've ever done.

[01:48] So if you know friends out there that are holding out,

[01:51] and I know many people are holding out,

[01:53] we used to get like 4,000 people to listen,

[01:56] but you are getting, I think, the best version of me,

[01:59] and I thank you so much, Brenda thanks you,

[02:02] Kylian thanks you, me and Brenda sit on the couch,

[02:04] and we get so excited every time a new club member joins,

[02:07] and she's a club member now, so she's getting emails

[02:10] every time a new show goes up.

[02:12] So everybody, enjoy Mr. Todd Tucky,

[02:14] and thank you again for your continued support.

[02:17] All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:19] the man, the myth, the legend,

[02:21] the only man I've ever seen get a standing ovation

[02:25] at the Twippies, Mr. Todd Tucky, Todd welcome to the show.

[02:28] Hey, thanks Chris.

[02:30] I was in shock when everybody stood up, boy oh boy.

[02:36] It was just, it was very thrilling.

[02:39] You know, and look Todd, I'm looking at the numbers

[02:41] right now, like you ran away with it,

[02:43] TNT amusements, favorite pinball YouTube channel,

[02:46] you got 30% of the votes.

[02:48] How does it feel?

[02:50] Wow, I didn't know that.

[02:51] So it was only 30%, I figured you'd have to get a lot more

[02:55] than that to win.

[02:56] Well, but here's the thing, you're up against

[02:58] one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

[03:01] There's 10 finalists, so you got 30%, and you won with that.

[03:06] Second place was straight down the middle with 18%,

[03:09] and then Kari Hardy with 14%.

[03:11] So you know, you're going up against 10 contestants,

[03:14] so to get a third.

[03:16] Wow, that is a good percentage,

[03:18] I never saw those numbers, I knew they published them.

[03:22] Yeah, so you got 30.47%, and guess how many,

[03:27] or how much Canada got?

[03:28] How many?

[03:29] 30.72%, so I just got a little bit more

[03:35] in the podcast category, but.

[03:36] Wow, good job.

[03:38] Todd, it was awesome, and look, it's been long overdue.

[03:42] I think I speak for everybody in this hobby.

[03:44] Your show and your content has been,

[03:47] I think one of the first points of contact

[03:50] that a lot of people have when they get into arcade

[03:52] and pinball collecting, how long have you been doing it?

[03:54] Well, I've been in the business since 79,

[03:57] but I did it on the side as a hobby,

[04:00] I would buy and sell games for many years before that.

[04:03] I think I bought my first game when I was 15 years old,

[04:06] so I didn't make it official until 79.

[04:10] In 79, when we made TNT amusements,

[04:13] I was officially 24 years old.

[04:15] I had some other TNTs before that,

[04:18] so my company was always TNT of some sort,

[04:21] but the amusements began in 79.

[04:24] Now, why the dynamite, what's that about?

[04:26] Well, my mother thought it would be neat

[04:28] to have my initials TNT, so it's Todd Nichols-Tucky.

[04:34] Nichols is an English name from, actually,

[04:38] above Leicester, Sapkut, a little tiny town

[04:41] called Sapkut, and that's where many of the Nichols

[04:44] came from.

[04:45] Now, how do your parents feel about you

[04:46] getting into this arcade and amusement industry?

[04:50] Well, my mother had passed away,

[04:52] even though she saw a couple games, she passed away in 73,

[04:56] but my father was around until 1994,

[04:59] until 1994, and he actually was very instrumental

[05:04] in helping me fund the buying of TNT amusements here in 86.

[05:10] He helped me with a deposit on the building,

[05:13] so we were able to, by buying,

[05:14] we then threw the money away and rent,

[05:16] although I ended up renting a much larger space

[05:20] to store all this stuff, and back then, though,

[05:23] the equipment was cheap to buy,

[05:27] but you couldn't get a lot of money to sell it,

[05:29] and I can't tell you how many hundreds of games

[05:31] we ended up parting out and junking

[05:34] because it was just too expensive to save it.

[05:36] Now, Todd, you've seen the ups and downs

[05:39] of this industry, right?

[05:40] What do you think of the recent inflation

[05:45] and also just fanfare around pinball and arcades?

[05:49] People are just obsessed with this industry right now.

[05:53] What's it been like for you?

[05:54] Well, I'll tell you, I didn't even predict anything like this.

[05:57] This is just crazy what's happened.

[06:00] The interest is now, I think, at an all-time high.

[06:04] The prices, as everybody knows,

[06:07] for video and pinballs are at all-time high,

[06:09] although I've heard some people say,

[06:11] oh, the prices are dropping.

[06:12] I said, well, not really, not for the A and B titles,

[06:16] maybe for the C titles, but the demand for these games

[06:21] just seems to be increasing.

[06:24] I just had another call.

[06:25] I had one pinbot come in.

[06:27] That's Barry Astor's, probably his best machine.

[06:31] He wanted to buy the pinbot we had listed,

[06:33] and I must have had six calls on it,

[06:36] and it sold for five grand.

[06:39] Now, this one's very nice,

[06:41] but that's a really high price,

[06:43] considering we used to sell them,

[06:45] starting at only $12.99 or $13.99 many years ago.

[06:50] Prices are just going crazy.

[06:51] Now, there's still a lot of beaters out there.

[06:54] There's a lot, beaters meaning games that may play well,

[06:59] but are just beat, and things that would be fine

[07:03] having an arcade, put some LEDs in it,

[07:07] and make sure the flippers are rebuilt,

[07:09] cabinets are really worn or rotted or rusted,

[07:13] that sort of thing, but they play okay.

[07:14] You can get by with them in an arcade,

[07:16] especially with the lights off.

[07:19] But people in their homes,

[07:20] they want something nice now, Cress,

[07:22] and they're willing to pay for it, it seems.

[07:25] Now, speaking of nice games,

[07:26] I think I saw you guys had an Elvira 40th.

[07:30] Did you have one come through there?

[07:32] Two, actually.

[07:33] We sold two.

[07:34] One went to a local man,

[07:36] and that's the one we did the video on.

[07:38] As a matter of fact, that got some of our highest views.

[07:42] It was live, so it had no editing.

[07:46] View rates over 25,000, which is high for TNT at least.

[07:52] The video is 47 minutes long,

[07:54] and we show unboxing it, literally,

[07:57] plugging it into the wall,

[07:59] taking everything out and starting it.

[08:01] There's no edits, there's no stop and starts,

[08:03] and it shows that the game immediately fired up

[08:07] and worked.

[08:08] What a surprising thing, right?

[08:09] No, and Stern games work out of the box

[08:11] for the most part, right?

[08:12] I mean, they wouldn't be where they're at

[08:14] if Stern games were out of the box problematic.

[08:17] Do you mind me asking, Todd,

[08:18] how much did your Elviras go for?

[08:22] 25,000.

[08:23] Each one.

[08:24] Each one for 25,000.

[08:26] Now, can you reveal how much you had to pay Stern for it?

[08:30] I can't.

[08:31] Stern gave, I'm gonna say it's a bone

[08:35] to their distributors to have a chance

[08:38] because they couldn't supply enough equipment.

[08:42] Stern is having trouble producing enough equipment.

[08:46] They can't get the parts.

[08:47] They're working pretty much around the clock

[08:50] when they get stuff in.

[08:51] And it was a very nice thing for them to do

[08:55] for the distributors to be able to make some money.

[08:58] Now, I work through automated services.

[09:01] Mike Dodona in Connecticut is in fact my supplier

[09:06] because the two of us are kind of in business together,

[09:10] shall we say.

[09:11] So I'm able to sell the Stern product and Jersey Jacks

[09:15] and anything really that he has a license to

[09:19] or a distributorship for.

[09:21] And it's worked out very well

[09:23] because I'm able to sell so many machines now,

[09:27] brand new machines,

[09:28] and it takes a lot of burden off of Mike

[09:31] because his loading dock can only handle so much equipment too.

[09:36] And I'm surprised at the amount of games that come through.

[09:39] And once again, when we opened up the crate,

[09:41] we do a lot of videos where we open the box up

[09:45] for both Jersey Jack and Stern.

[09:47] I haven't had the pleasure of opening up

[09:50] other manufacturers, machines yet.

[09:53] I would love to open up a spooky pin, brand new,

[09:57] or one of the new Hague's pins

[09:58] if they ever come through here.

[10:01] I don't know if they will.

[10:02] We're an American pinball.

[10:04] Todd, let's say I walk into TNT brand new and I say,

[10:07] can you recommend a game that would be good

[10:10] at teaching me how to play pinball?

[10:17] I would, yes.

[10:20] I would shoot for something older

[10:23] because the rule sets aren't so complicated.

[10:27] I did a video on Comet, for instance.

[10:30] It's not a complicated set of rules

[10:32] and it's easy to follow.

[10:34] And the card, the instruction card on the apron,

[10:37] pretty much tells you everything you need to do,

[10:39] but then there's some certain neat little adjustments

[10:42] and tweaks.

[10:43] So you could learn all the rules

[10:45] in four or five minutes on that game.

[10:47] But all the new games now, the rule sets are so deep

[10:52] that you can probably never uncover all the secrets.

[10:56] And see, sometimes people don't want that.

[10:59] You know what, Chris?

[11:01] It's sort of like the classic arcades.

[11:03] Older people, like the old school games,

[11:06] like Miss Pac-Man, Gallagher, Asteroids, Frogger,

[11:10] the graphics aren't bad at all.

[11:12] They play great and the rule sets aren't complicated.

[11:16] And it's hard to believe, but most of them don't have an end

[11:20] where newer fighting games, or let's say the side scrollers

[11:23] or fighters, have a beginning and an end.

[11:26] And you have to master the rules.

[11:28] You may have to remember hitting more buttons

[11:30] on the control panel causes the character

[11:33] to do a different kind of fight style or jump or something.

[11:37] So old school arcades seem to be making a comeback.

[11:42] And the younger kids of today who are tired of

[11:46] or they want to break from, let's say,

[11:48] tour a duty and these very involved new games

[11:53] will go to the old school arcade and play these old games

[11:56] and learn them and find out they, in fact,

[11:58] are a lot of fun when presented rather than on a TV screen

[12:02] in their house or in their laptop

[12:05] with the full size controls and dedicated machine.

[12:09] And that has really aided the old school arcades now.

[12:13] They are now becoming very popular.

[12:16] Almost everyone that opens is doing well

[12:18] unless they happen to open it in the bad area

[12:22] or an area that doesn't get the traffic.

[12:24] And that's always been pinball's appeal.

[12:26] And one of the reasons I sort of went from being

[12:28] an arcade guy to a pin guy was,

[12:31] even in a game like Donkey Kong,

[12:33] you're still somewhat memorizing the patterns, right?

[12:35] But in pinball, every game is fresh, every game is chaotic.

[12:40] And yes, you do need to know the rules

[12:42] to make the game more rewarding.

[12:44] But even then, each game's different, right?

[12:46] And I think that's why pinball has such replay value

[12:49] that doesn't get old.

[12:50] That's true, every game you play is different.

[12:53] You know what?

[12:53] You can really change it again

[12:55] by changing the pitch of the game.

[12:57] So you can drop the back legs down, make it slower,

[13:00] or raise them up and make it faster.

[13:02] And it also changes the vector or trajectory of your shot

[13:07] just by doing those two different adjustments.

[13:09] And we've been selling pinballs, as everybody knows,

[13:13] our home sales really kicked in in 84.

[13:16] So we've been selling directly to homes 12 months a year,

[13:20] longer than anybody else in the country.

[13:22] A lot of people sell games, and they have for many years,

[13:26] but most of the time it's only at the holiday.

[13:28] You know, toward Christmas,

[13:29] they start to put games in their shop.

[13:31] But their main business is putting them in location.

[13:35] In 2013, I pulled out of our final location

[13:39] where we were doing splits, like a 50-50 split.

[13:43] And I bid that adieu forever in 2013.

[13:46] But when I got in the business in 79,

[13:48] it was 100% vending where we put them in locations.

[13:52] And we rotated them out when they didn't make money

[13:54] and put different games in.

[13:56] We fan out.

[13:57] There were a whole bunch of games that never made any money.

[13:59] But now everybody wants those games

[14:02] because most of them were knocked apart or destroyed.

[14:05] We had some very rare games, like Stern's Quicksilver,

[14:10] that people all of a sudden want, or Catacombs.

[14:13] Nobody played them.

[14:15] You got some player, so, but they were never,

[14:18] Pinball never made the money that video games made.

[14:22] For me, I guess if you had a Pinball location,

[14:25] but see, most locations wanted like four or five video games

[14:29] and maybe one pin.

[14:30] And the Pinball machine never made the money

[14:33] that any of the other video games made.

[14:36] So consequently, they weren't seen as much

[14:39] and they tended to have a lower value

[14:41] when you resold them to homes.

[14:43] I was selling Pinball machines out of my driveway

[14:46] starting at 350.

[14:48] That would buy you like an old Stern wildfire or a power play.

[14:52] That's what we sold them for.

[14:53] Black Knight was my cheapest multi-level game.

[14:57] I can't tell you how many I sold for 550 bucks

[15:00] because that's what we got.

[15:01] We got 600 for Jungle Lord.

[15:03] And for many years, then the prices kept going up.

[15:07] Todd, you bring up an interesting point too

[15:08] because if you think about operating modern games

[15:12] and the prices now, right?

[15:13] 6,000, 11,000 for an LE, that's a lot of plays

[15:17] you gotta get before you break even.

[15:19] Now, of course, you get something back

[15:20] when you sell the game.

[15:21] A lot harder though to make a profit margin

[15:25] with the high prices of these modern machines,

[15:27] don't you think?

[15:28] Yes, the only way you can really factor in a profit

[15:32] is if you're the only game in town or nearby.

[15:35] For instance, there's a bar near here

[15:38] and he has two Pimbles in it.

[15:41] Inexplicably, games like Roller Games and Terminator 3,

[15:46] Pimble Games are producing for him $2 to $300 a week gross.

[15:51] And he gets all the money because he owns the games.

[15:53] That's an astronomical amount of money.

[15:55] He makes him a dollar a play, three plays for $2.

[16:00] That's what he does.

[16:00] He said he's not doing it for less.

[16:03] And he buys his own games.

[16:04] He keeps them in there for two or three months

[16:07] and rolls them out and puts a different game.

[16:09] He just keeps the games moving.

[16:11] And he's doing a great job, but he's getting 100%.

[16:16] No vendor would put games in anymore

[16:19] unless they had a tried and true amount of money

[16:21] they could bring in.

[16:23] If you're vending Pimbles on coin,

[16:27] you tend to make a lot less money

[16:29] than if you had a flat rate arcade.

[16:31] Flat rate arcades are positively the way to go.

[16:34] They really are.

[16:35] One flat charge to go in, $10 for an hour, $20 for two hours

[16:41] or three hours, and then $35 for the whole day.

[16:45] And you give them a band, they can come and go.

[16:48] They go out for lunch, they come back and go out for dinner.

[16:51] You're gonna make a lot more money that way.

[16:53] Depending, I guess, on the city you're in,

[16:55] I just have always found it hard for people

[16:58] to put in more than 50 cents into any game.

[17:02] And if they do, they'll only play it once.

[17:04] And most of the games they'll walk by

[17:06] and not put a coin in.

[17:07] So after the people leave after two hours,

[17:10] you may have gotten $3 out of their wallet.

[17:13] But if you have a flat rate, they'll pay 10.

[17:16] They have free access for the whole hour

[17:18] at anything they want.

[17:20] If they were putting coins in,

[17:21] they would never have put in $10.

[17:24] But the feeling, the sensation they get

[17:27] is they can play anything they want as long as they want.

[17:30] The brand new game or the old classic,

[17:32] and they don't have to worry about coins.

[17:35] And they perceive it as a better deal

[17:38] than if they were putting quarters or 50 cents in.

[17:41] And half the people won't put anything in.

[17:43] They'll just walk, look at this game for a few minutes.

[17:45] No, I don't wanna play that, they'll walk over to this one.

[17:48] So you're not making anything,

[17:49] then you're just wasting your time walking around.

[17:52] That's why the flat rate does seems to be the way to go.

[17:55] Well, if you're like me, you pay like,

[17:56] I went down to Florida, the Pinball Museum in Delray Beach,

[18:00] pay to get in and I just spent my whole time at the bar.

[18:03] There you go.

[18:04] Don't even play the games.

[18:05] You're there for the atmosphere.

[18:07] Absolutely, absolutely.

[18:08] So Todd, what's your inventory like right now?

[18:10] Are you sort of like out of all new stock?

[18:13] Like what's it like?

[18:14] Yep, yep, we are, I have Wonkas and Guns and Roses

[18:20] from the last runs of both games.

[18:23] I have Turtles, both models and stock.

[18:27] And believe it or not, I think that's about it.

[18:29] I think I have some, the home Star Wars.

[18:32] I can't get anything, Mike can't get anything.

[18:34] Now, if you could snap your finger

[18:37] and order any title to get tomorrow,

[18:40] which would you want more of?

[18:42] Oh, Chris, come on, it's Godzilla.

[18:47] Okay.

[18:48] Are you kidding?

[18:49] The king of the monsters.

[18:51] Oh my God, oh my God, I could sell a hundred of them.

[18:54] Yeah, do you have a lot on back order?

[18:57] Yes, like a hundred.

[18:59] Now I heard Stern is running more mandos now.

[19:01] Are you like, what are you doing?

[19:02] We don't need more.

[19:03] Oh, you know what, I didn't mention that.

[19:04] I have mandos coming in.

[19:07] Okay.

[19:07] So I have six more coming in.

[19:09] I forgot, they're coming in next week.

[19:11] But these are pros.

[19:12] I want the premiums, but mando is actually,

[19:16] I couldn't believe Stern didn't keep it on the line longer.

[19:19] And they rushed at Godzilla.

[19:22] I am thrilled that Stern is doing what they're doing.

[19:26] That they're holding off a new title until August.

[19:28] What a great idea.

[19:30] I hope that guy got a bonus.

[19:32] Whoever suggested that, they can catch up

[19:34] to all these orders.

[19:36] We don't need four new games a year.

[19:38] We absolutely do not, two is fine.

[19:41] Yeah, let's talk about that.

[19:42] So obviously Stern is taking a break to catch up.

[19:45] Do you think the rest of the industry is slow

[19:48] to capitalize on this window?

[19:51] Yeah, yeah.

[19:52] Where is everybody?

[19:53] Where's-

[19:54] They can't get parts.

[19:55] They can't get parts.

[19:57] You know what?

[19:58] I'll tell you, here's an example, line chords.

[20:00] I eat power chords.

[20:03] We eat them because we have a rule.

[20:06] If the chord has a ding or a nick in it, it gets replaced.

[20:10] A, and B, if somebody lopped off the ground log

[20:13] at the end, it gets a new chord.

[20:16] So consequently, nine out of 10 games

[20:19] have to get new power chords.

[20:21] Now I like the flat ones that are like 14 foot long.

[20:24] I like the real long chords.

[20:26] And Steve Young, a Pimble resource,

[20:28] is pretty much the only guy that has them.

[20:31] Well, I couldn't get them.

[20:33] And I would are 50 in a crack.

[20:36] So I called him up and he says, Todd,

[20:38] he says, I don't know what's gonna happen,

[20:40] the price of copper, et cetera, et cetera.

[20:43] So finally he called me up and he says,

[20:44] Todd, they're gonna make him again,

[20:46] but they're gonna cost you $6 more chords.

[20:49] $6 more, just like that, boom.

[20:53] Now we're up to, I think they're sick,

[20:55] that brings them up to 17 bucks each.

[20:57] But I gotta have power chords.

[20:59] Let's talk about price inflation.

[21:01] What do you think is gonna happen in Pimble?

[21:03] Do you think we're gonna see a quarterly increase in price

[21:07] as inflation sweeps across the world?

[21:09] No, here's what I think.

[21:12] I predict pros, sterns, let's talk about stern.

[21:17] Sterns, pros are gonna stop at seven grand, okay?

[21:21] I think stern premiums will be 10.

[21:25] I think stern limiteds will be 13 to 14.

[21:29] And then anything really special,

[21:32] like let's say a vault, even though it's a pro,

[21:35] that will be eight, or 8,500.

[21:38] So that's what I think.

[21:40] Now Jersey Jack, I think is only gonna have two models.

[21:44] They're gonna have their limited and their collectors.

[21:47] It's absolutely stupid to make the standard.

[21:50] I agree.

[21:50] That's ridiculous.

[21:53] For a thousand where you get,

[21:55] I think the limiteds, the ones that we now have,

[21:57] like Guns N' Roses and Willy Wonkers, will be 12.

[22:02] And I think the collectors will be 16.

[22:05] Todd, you're reading my mind,

[22:06] because I just put up a show.

[22:07] I said, I think 1,000 CEs at 15,999 will be the price.

[22:11] Oh, really?

[22:12] Yeah.

[22:13] Okay, okay, well then we're thinking alike.

[22:16] And I don't think they're gonna go above that.

[22:18] I really don't.

[22:19] Now, reissues, like if they say,

[22:22] we're gonna make some Ghostbusters Vault Pros,

[22:26] I think they're gonna be 8, 8,500.

[22:29] What about if they do a Ghostbusters SLE,

[22:32] A-La, L-Vyra 40th?

[22:34] What do you think they price those at?

[22:36] 25.

[22:37] I'm in complete agreeance with you.

[22:38] I think, and I've been talking about,

[22:41] let's say hypothetically, there's a rumor of,

[22:44] Back to the Future, okay?

[22:45] Huge, huge title.

[22:47] If Stern made 88 super limited editions, just 88, Todd.

[22:52] What do you think they could charge?

[22:53] Well, at least 25.

[22:55] That's like, at least.

[22:59] Well, here's the problem with Back to the Future.

[23:01] Michael J. Fox, he refused to be on the data east, okay?

[23:06] That's the problem with Jaws.

[23:09] Roy Schneider's family refuses to have him on the Jaws.

[23:13] Do you know that still to this day?

[23:15] Because I've been saying Jaws is next

[23:16] from Stern by Keith Elwin.

[23:18] My God, what a great title.

[23:22] Atwood's so like hotcakes, hotcakes.

[23:26] I mean, can you imagine all the things you could do?

[23:30] Oh my God, and did you see Chris Frenchy's

[23:33] Marvelous Jaws back glass?

[23:36] Has done marvelous artwork on Jaws.

[23:40] I mean, it's a gorgeous,

[23:41] but the problem is it has Roy in there.

[23:44] So maybe they'd have to do something

[23:48] Chris said maybe they'll do Quint's Quest or something.

[23:53] Quint, what am I saying, Quint?

[23:55] In other words, do something based on Robert Shaw

[23:57] and then the Jaws would be in the background.

[24:00] I don't know.

[24:01] That's what Chris had thought,

[24:03] because how can you do Jaws without Roy?

[24:06] Right, well, how can you do Alien without Sigourney Weaver?

[24:09] But such is pinball, we got it.

[24:12] But look, I heard it's gonna be Jaws.

[24:14] I heard it's coming out probably in August.

[24:17] It also might be codename for James Bond.

[24:19] What do you think about James Bond as a theme?

[24:22] No.

[24:24] No.

[24:24] Why no?

[24:25] It's been done and nobody got excited.

[24:31] The Golden Eyes didn't sell,

[24:33] the timed Gottlieb James Bond didn't sell.

[24:36] It didn't sell.

[24:37] Didn't sell them, it's not gonna sell now.

[24:39] Not the Roger Moore, Sean Connery.

[24:43] I mean, and then Secret Service did,

[24:48] I mean Secret Service had some brushes with Bond.

[24:52] I don't think it's a good, I don't think so, but you know.

[24:55] What do you think about Todd Toy Story?

[24:57] That's the rumor for Jersey Jack.

[24:59] Oh my God.

[25:04] They're never gonna make enough.

[25:07] Oh wow, okay, I agree.

[25:08] They're never gonna make enough.

[25:10] They don't have to make any more titles after Toy Story

[25:15] because they're never gonna be able to keep up.

[25:19] And my God, if they made pirates, oh my God.

[25:22] Well, well, but you remember Pirates

[25:25] and Keith Johnson said this,

[25:26] the only time people wanted pirates

[25:28] is when they couldn't have it.

[25:29] And so I think they will do another run of pirates one day.

[25:33] I think they will charge accordingly

[25:35] considering the demand.

[25:36] Toy Story's in a supernal realm,

[25:38] I think it's gonna be their most popular title.

[25:41] Do you think Jersey Jack Pinball

[25:42] can make two titles in a year?

[25:48] I haven't seen their factory,

[25:51] however, they have Steve Ritchie now.

[25:55] So Steve has seen everything

[25:57] and I think he's already been helping them a lot,

[26:02] you know, getting the quality up

[26:03] and I think they're gonna have to expand,

[26:07] but their machines seem to have a lot more parts in them

[26:11] than the Stern machines.

[26:13] Stern's gotten all the bugs out though.

[26:15] The Spike System, Spike 2 is a great system.

[26:19] I did not like it at first.

[26:22] I was, let me tell you, I was very upset

[26:25] because I like the Sam System, you know?

[26:30] But the Sam System can't do what the Spike System does.

[26:33] It can't and the Spike System has proven to be reliable.

[26:39] As long as you don't get some bozo in there

[26:41] adding toys and then shorting stuff out,

[26:45] that can kill your game.

[26:46] You know, somebody's not an understanding

[26:48] but they had that one run of those bad node boards,

[26:51] that first node board, they got rid of that whole node,

[26:54] they replaced it with another.

[26:56] And I mean, honest to God, I tell people all the time,

[26:58] I can count on two hands, less than two hands,

[27:03] the problems I've had with circuit boards.

[27:05] As long, I don't count it when some bozo goes in there

[27:09] with a big fat screwdriver to make adjustments

[27:11] with the power on, you know?

[27:13] That doesn't count because you blow your stuff out.

[27:16] Now I will tell you this, in the old days,

[27:19] if you went in there with a big fat screwdriver

[27:21] into a twilight zone and you were monkeying around

[27:24] with your lights and your switches

[27:26] and you shorted something out,

[27:27] you blew one chip out on the board.

[27:30] And we actually put that chip in a socket

[27:33] on the logic board, the switch line socket.

[27:35] We call it a fuse.

[27:37] So if the customer calls me and he says,

[27:40] oh, my switches don't work.

[27:42] I said, well, you blew out, you were changing bulbs,

[27:44] weren't you?

[27:45] And you touched them, oh, gee, I didn't think I did it.

[27:48] And I said, well, I said, all you have to do

[27:50] is change this chip.

[27:51] And believe it or not, you can actually change the chip

[27:53] without even taking the board out if it's in a socket.

[27:57] So we always put that chip in a socket on the WPCs.

[28:00] But you can't do that with a spike.

[28:04] Right, right.

[28:05] Blow the board up, you can't change the chips.

[28:07] So that's the downside.

[28:09] Yeah, it is the downside, but the boards are easy to swap.

[28:12] I had to swap in a few boards and it's five minute job.

[28:15] And they're under $200.

[28:18] So Jersey Jack, so the other rumored game,

[28:20] I'm curious what you think is Eric Minier's next game

[28:23] is the Godfather.

[28:24] What do you think of that?

[28:27] Well, I, who would want it?

[28:35] I mean, I can't see any kids getting excited over this.

[28:42] Daddy, will you buy us a Godfather?

[28:45] Toy Story, that's gonna be in like every house.

[28:48] I don't know, the Godfather would be,

[28:50] now that could be like a limited edition,

[28:52] limited run type of thing.

[28:55] So the Godfather could be popular

[28:57] with a certain group of collectors, mainly men.

[29:01] I don't think that women would want it in their house,

[29:04] but who knows?

[29:06] I don't know.

[29:08] If you could recommend Jersey Jack Pinball to make a theme,

[29:13] let's say it's Steve Rich's next game,

[29:14] what theme would you like to see Jersey Jack make?

[29:19] Something that is for sure family oriented.

[29:22] And if you think about it,

[29:24] Jersey Jack has been pretty much sticking with that theme,

[29:27] with the exception probably of the Godfather.

[29:30] And Guns N' Roses, maybe.

[29:32] Yes, Guns N' Roses, yeah.

[29:34] It was interesting that they chose a rock theme game,

[29:38] and it was certainly great for sales.

[29:40] Scooby Doo is a great title for pretty much every age.

[29:45] I don't know, I don't know if Scooby is running its route.

[29:49] What about the Muppets?

[29:50] The Muppets has been a rumor for JJP.

[29:54] Scooby Doo over the Muppets?

[29:56] I have to look at which one's more popular.

[29:58] What's interesting though, Todd, about Guns N' Roses

[30:01] and the success it has, or the success it's had,

[30:04] is it showed Jersey Jack though that there's a lot

[30:08] of sales to be had, even if you're not family friendly.

[30:11] So it will be curious if they do go Godfather,

[30:14] that's obviously a departure from only family friendly

[30:17] titles, I just hope they get at least two games out.

[30:21] This is my dream for JJP, just two games out every two years,

[30:25] which is just one new game a year,

[30:26] which they haven't been able to hit.

[30:28] Well, I think they're gonna have two games this year.

[30:32] Do you have any reason why,

[30:35] or just something you hope happens?

[30:37] Well, I really can't say.

[30:39] Okay, well that's even better.

[30:41] But no comment is a yes.

[30:43] I think June, we will see one.

[30:46] Toy Story.

[30:47] At Fantastic.

[30:49] To coincide with the Buzz Lightyear movie.

[30:51] Which is a frigging terrific show in Sturbridge, Massachusetts.

[30:56] Yes.

[30:57] Gabe reminds me every day.

[31:00] You gotta come to it.

[31:01] This has gotta be the funkiest hotel in the country.

[31:05] You've never seen anything like it.

[31:07] It's so funky.

[31:08] I watched some of my videos on it.

[31:11] We have so much fun.

[31:12] I would be there, I'm just gonna probably be in Ireland

[31:16] during Fantastic.

[31:17] It's breaking my heart.

[31:18] And I know Gabe's gonna have a Rush cover band.

[31:22] And I heard the show goes like 24 hours a day.

[31:24] Is that true?

[31:25] Yes, it's open 24 hours a day.

[31:29] If you have that special pass,

[31:31] he moves games, new games, and odd games

[31:36] and all kinds into one room.

[31:38] The room is open 24 hours.

[31:40] Because obviously he has to keep security too.

[31:42] So the free play room is not open.

[31:45] But he moves some of the great titles over.

[31:48] So there's plenty of games to play.

[31:49] So if you wanna play it four in the morning, you can.

[31:52] Where you can't sleep or something,

[31:53] you just come down and play pinballs for a couple hours

[31:55] and then go back up and get some more shut-eye.

[31:59] Everything's on one floor.

[32:00] Some of the rooms are on the second floor,

[32:02] but not the game playing rooms.

[32:04] All the game playing areas and everything

[32:06] are very easy to walk to.

[32:08] The whole place is carpeted, which is critical.

[32:11] So it's comfortable.

[32:12] They have an indoor pool.

[32:14] It's very funky.

[32:15] Yeah, I just don't.

[32:17] I don't know if seeing the pinball community

[32:19] in a swimming pool is my idea of fun,

[32:21] but the games being available 24 hours a day

[32:24] is a lot of fun.

[32:25] So Todd, let's talk about the rest of the companies out here.

[32:30] Like the new trend that we've seen a lot of

[32:32] is this non-refundable pre-order.

[32:34] Like what do you think of that?

[32:35] Do you think that's a good practice?

[32:38] No, no.

[32:40] It's, look what happened.

[32:43] I mean, I just got a fresh cup of coffee.

[32:47] Now, what do you think of that?

[32:48] I love it.

[32:49] Give us your money.

[32:50] You can't get it back.

[32:52] And when you get your game, is anyone's guess.

[32:55] That's been happening a lot lately.

[32:57] I'll tell you what, I wouldn't have a problem

[33:00] with 500 or maybe $1,000

[33:03] because if you do lose it, you lose it.

[33:06] But none of this $5,000 stuff.

[33:09] Now, here I say that and I gave back in 2001

[33:15] a $2,400 deposit for a big bang bar to Gene Cunningham

[33:21] who was simply a collector at the time.

[33:23] He had never manufactured a pinball in his life.

[33:27] As a matter of fact, another friend,

[33:28] we were sitting next to it at the,

[33:30] they actually had a seminar

[33:31] and he proposed the idea of making him.

[33:34] He had 175 or 190 board sets

[33:38] and he was gonna do it.

[33:39] He owned the board sets, he had the licensing

[33:42] and he was gonna make them.

[33:43] And a whole bunch of us gave him a deposit, $2,400.

[33:48] We waited four years, three years, four years.

[33:52] And he says, we're almost done.

[33:53] We need the other 2,400.

[33:55] And pretty much all of us gave him the money.

[33:58] There were a bunch of people that said,

[34:00] you lost your money.

[34:01] He's gonna screw you.

[34:02] He's gonna do this and that.

[34:04] I looked that man right in the eye

[34:05] when I gave him the 2,400.

[34:07] And I said, are you gonna make this machine?

[34:09] And he said, I'm gonna make it.

[34:12] And he said he was gonna make it.

[34:14] And I said that, that's it.

[34:16] And I looked right in the eye.

[34:18] Well, he made it.

[34:19] It also killed him making it, but he made it.

[34:21] He did.

[34:22] He lost money on it.

[34:24] He lost about $2,000 on every machine he delivered.

[34:27] But at the time he had the money,

[34:29] the problem is is in 2007, the real estate market bombed.

[34:33] He went right down the toilet.

[34:35] Yeah.

[34:36] That killed it.

[34:37] Well, and that's what we've seen

[34:38] with a lot of these boutiques is they'll set the price

[34:42] and they run into unforeseen hurdles, right?

[34:45] And so, I mean, we're seeing this a little bit with Haggis

[34:48] where they said the game's gonna be out in a couple months.

[34:50] They take your money.

[34:51] And it has to be more money to make the game in 2022

[34:55] than it was in 2019 or whenever they were factoring the price.

[34:59] And inflation means you either got to increase

[35:03] the price of your product or reduce your cost

[35:05] of manufacturing, which is really hard for boutiques to do.

[35:08] There's so much involved.

[35:10] Think about this.

[35:11] Look at Stern.

[35:12] They wanna make a thousand bandos.

[35:16] Well, they have to have a thousand little dolls, you know,

[35:20] yotas, they have to have a thousand of this.

[35:23] They have a thousand, well, at least a thousand.

[35:25] And suppose the one manufacturer says,

[35:27] oh, gee, gosh, I'm not gonna be getting parts.

[35:30] I can't make that part for another three months.

[35:33] So here's Stern sitting with all these parts.

[35:36] They have every single part, but one thing,

[35:38] they can't make the game.

[35:40] They're stopped.

[35:40] Then the guy says, well, we're gonna have to raise the price

[35:43] for the next batch or whatever.

[35:45] It must be incredibly nerve-wracking and nail-biting

[35:51] to run a company as massive as Jersey Jack and as Stern does.

[35:57] Now, Spooky Pimble seems to have managed to seal that.

[36:03] And they certainly don't produce the quantity of games,

[36:08] but they've got some terrific titles.

[36:10] And the quality seems to be pretty good.

[36:13] And unfortunately, Mike does not distribute them,

[36:19] and he doesn't do the American Pimbles too.

[36:22] And I wish they did because I'd love to get my hands on those

[36:25] and see what makes those machines tech.

[36:28] I like looking inside them.

[36:30] For the first time ever, I was able to look inside

[36:32] at the Texas Pimble show, which was terrific, by the way.

[36:36] And we had a lot of fun down there.

[36:38] It was so much fun.

[36:40] But I got the chance to see what was under the playfield

[36:43] of the Big Lebowski.

[36:45] My God, what an elaborate mechanism that thing is.

[36:48] Right, the bowling alley.

[36:50] Good grief.

[36:51] That was elaborate.

[36:52] I only saw the inside of the head years ago at the 2014

[36:56] when they unveiled the game.

[36:58] And they never showed the inside.

[36:59] The inside was fascinating to see.

[37:02] And I mean, the cost to produce that, God.

[37:06] I mean, as I said, it's numbing.

[37:08] It's a hard enough time for me to order things

[37:11] like I told you before, power cords and pop bumper caps.

[37:15] Like right now, guess what I can't buy?

[37:17] I can't buy clear flipper buttons.

[37:21] We take the colored flipper buttons out of every machine.

[37:25] We put clear one in and we light it with LEDs.

[37:28] Well, guess what?

[37:29] Everybody's out of stock.

[37:31] It's tough going.

[37:32] Do you think, Todd, that everyone's gonna survive 2022?

[37:36] I mean, there's a lot of companies jumping in the ring.

[37:39] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

[37:40] We'll survive.

[37:41] We're actually, we're having a record year.

[37:45] I'm here seven days a week, 12 to 15 hours a day.

[37:50] I'm never, ever, ever, ever gonna catch up.

[37:54] I turn down wall.

[37:55] I don't do any more overhauls for restorations.

[37:59] I tell people, call me next January.

[38:01] I am so far behind those.

[38:04] And see the sales always take precedence.

[38:07] Game sales take precedence.

[38:09] Brand new games are easy.

[38:11] I mean, any Claude hopper can open up a box

[38:14] and sell them a new game.

[38:16] Restorations are tough.

[38:18] Anybody in the business, all you guys listening and gals,

[38:22] you know how hard it is to restore an old game,

[38:24] especially if it's been through the beater or the ringer.

[38:29] New games anybody can sell.

[38:31] My wife could.

[38:32] You know, you just open the box up

[38:34] and to do a few adjustments and you're done.

[38:36] The problem now is not only parts,

[38:39] parts will continue to be a problem for everybody.

[38:42] New, used, reconditioning.

[38:44] So I don't see getting over that hump this year.

[38:48] I think parts will start to flow next year.

[38:51] I think things will start to change

[38:53] and people will order extra.

[38:56] Prices are gonna keep going up through 2022

[38:58] as the demand far outweighs the supply, right?

[39:02] And then we're gonna get caught up.

[39:03] We're gonna close that gap as parts become available.

[39:07] Let me ask you another question

[39:08] because I love asking about your thoughts

[39:09] on the different manufacturers.

[39:10] American Pinball has a strategy

[39:12] of mostly original IP games.

[39:15] Do you think that can be successful for them?

[39:19] I think it's worth a shot.

[39:21] The legends of the Hala is a beautiful game.

[39:25] It seems to be holding up.

[39:27] Oktoberfest, I love simply because it looks like me

[39:30] on the back glass and on the side of the cabinet.

[39:33] It is true.

[39:37] I always thought Houdini was a beautiful game.

[39:40] I just loved the theme.

[39:41] Did you know, here's something a lot of your listeners

[39:44] probably don't know and I didn't know it either.

[39:48] But American Pinball, I mean, Houdini's a great theme

[39:51] because it's magic, but they didn't have to pay

[39:54] any licensing.

[39:55] Did you know that?

[39:56] Yeah, it's open IP.

[39:57] That's right.

[39:58] Houdini requested, they said,

[40:01] "'Nobody has to pay to use my likeness

[40:04] "'or my stuff or anything related to me.'"

[40:07] They said, it's not necessary to pay.

[40:10] And Houdini, a very clever man

[40:12] because here it is 100 years later

[40:14] and people know who he is.

[40:15] And all the footage of him they can use

[40:17] without having to pay a licensing fee.

[40:19] You know, it's interesting.

[40:20] The Creative Commons license is a very fascinating thing

[40:23] especially when it comes to works of literature.

[40:25] I believe it's something like,

[40:27] I wanna say it's 100 years

[40:28] or maybe it's 80 something years after the work is published

[40:33] it becomes open domain.

[40:35] So the really interesting thing about this,

[40:37] well, one is this year the most popular one

[40:39] was Winnie the Pooh became public domain.

[40:42] So anyone can make a Winnie the Pooh pinball machine.

[40:45] You just can't use the illustrations from Disney's movies.

[40:49] But this is why Disney's fighting this law

[40:51] because Mickey Mouse becomes public domain

[40:55] in just a few years and Disney's trying to change

[40:58] this entire rule to protect Mickey Mouse.

[41:01] Oh, I didn't know that.

[41:03] Yeah, very interesting.

[41:05] Because in the world of pinball we talk about

[41:06] well, what's available in the open IP world?

[41:09] And there's a lot of stuff like Moby Dick

[41:11] is something you could make.

[41:12] Like it's past the level of IP protection

[41:16] because of the age of the novel.

[41:18] So Todd, quick question about

[41:20] if you could have one dream theme.

[41:22] I always love to ask people this, what would it be?

[41:24] I think there was a Japanese movie.

[41:28] I thought it was the movie of the decade when it came out

[41:31] and Disney actually purchased the United States rights

[41:36] and dubbed it in English.

[41:38] It was a movie called Spirited Away.

[41:41] One of many films by a very prominent director

[41:45] a Japanese director of animation.

[41:47] And I have a difficult time pronouncing his name.

[41:49] It's not awful.

[41:50] But I thought that would make a great theme

[41:53] since there are worldwide fans of that character

[41:57] and there's limited amounts of cartoon themes.

[42:01] I mean, we had Spider-Man, but we never had Speed Racer.

[42:04] We had it in a video game, but not a pinball.

[42:07] Now Hot Wheels I thought was gonna sell.

[42:10] I guess the Hot Wheels wasn't as big of a theme

[42:14] as we all thought it was.

[42:15] Well, my theory is Hot Wheels didn't sell

[42:18] because there was no loops, no jumps, no car washes.

[42:21] It didn't have any of that Hot Wheels fun, right?

[42:24] You shouldn't be able to buy a $30 Hot Wheels toy

[42:27] and it comes with more interesting stuff

[42:29] than a $6,000 pinball machine.

[42:32] Well, I was surprised it didn't have the jump

[42:34] like we have Jack Danger's Jurassic Park.

[42:37] Now there's a great game presented

[42:39] on an inexpensive level to get pinball into people's homes.

[42:45] Yeah, the rumor is, and well, I started this rumor

[42:47] but I'll say it again, that Jack Danger

[42:49] might be working on He-Man, Masters of the Universe.

[42:53] What do you think?

[42:54] Well, I don't know a whole lot of He-Man fans

[43:00] but I'm not in the loop anymore.

[43:02] I'm 66 and that was past my time.

[43:06] I will tell you, I actually liked the movie.

[43:10] Yeah, the one with Dolph Lundgren.

[43:12] Yes, I mean, I shouldn't have liked it.

[43:14] I should have hated it.

[43:16] But the movie was actually good.

[43:19] I couldn't believe it.

[43:20] I said, this movie's not bad.

[43:22] It's just like Predator.

[43:24] Predator should have been awful, but it wasn't.

[43:27] It was really good.

[43:28] I mean, Predator is a classic.

[43:30] I wish all those Arnold movies like Predator, Total Recall,

[43:33] they would make for great pins.

[43:35] Total Recall certainly would

[43:37] and they had one in the works as you know.

[43:39] It was like two playfields connected.

[43:41] It was weird.

[43:43] You can't put that anywhere.

[43:44] You can't get it through a door.

[43:46] You can't put that in a local valley.

[43:47] It was just weird.

[43:49] It's sad.

[43:50] It's just like, oh, you know,

[43:51] when you talked about James Bond,

[43:54] they did make another James Bond.

[43:55] I mean, I think they only made 10 of them, Thunder Bowl.

[43:58] That didn't come out.

[43:59] I mean, that was back in 1980.

[44:01] You know what's interesting, Todd,

[44:03] is with all the effort it takes to make a pin though,

[44:06] you gotta get the theme right.

[44:08] I mean, there's no room anymore for like a misstep,

[44:11] especially with these boutique companies

[44:12] because you need to keep the line moving.

[44:16] So there's a lot of pressure to make sure

[44:17] if we do get this,

[44:19] we need to at least sell 500 to 1,000 of these games.

[44:23] Yes, yes, that's true.

[44:25] And when Spooky put the Halloween and the Ultra Band's up,

[44:31] everybody kind of said, oh, well,

[44:34] they'll sell a couple hundred or something

[44:37] and nobody ever dreamed that they would sell them out

[44:40] in two hours.

[44:41] Their break-even point, isn't their break-even point?

[44:44] I was told a break-even point is 300 units.

[44:48] It's gotta depend on what your operating costs are, right?

[44:51] Spooky's might be 300

[44:53] because they have really low operating costs

[44:55] from a rent standpoint.

[44:56] They're in a tiny town and they've been,

[45:00] I believe, I think Charlie said in the documentary,

[45:02] their rent was like $1.

[45:04] Of course, they've moved into larger facilities,

[45:06] but the town is really rallied around that company.

[45:10] And then you look at companies like,

[45:11] I wanna say, look at what happened to Highway,

[45:14] and look at Deeproot, right?

[45:15] These companies that built up their factory

[45:18] and their design studio is so large

[45:20] that there's no way they can make back the money

[45:23] unless they charged, I mean,

[45:24] Raza would have had to be $25,000 to break-even on.

[45:29] That was really amazing too.

[45:31] And do you know Carrie Hardy put his finger right on it?

[45:35] He did, and no one wanted to really believe him.

[45:38] He was right on it.

[45:39] He was right on it, and he saw it.

[45:42] He saw it clearly.

[45:44] He nailed it right there in that spot.

[45:46] I couldn't believe it, because I forgot he said that.

[45:49] And I talk about this a lot

[45:50] because there were members of the community,

[45:52] there were members of the pinball world

[45:53] who worked at Deeproot, God rest barrio's soul,

[45:57] and he was over there, John Norris,

[45:59] Dennis Norman left early on, Steve Bowden.

[46:02] It's just, it still blows my mind

[46:03] that none of them waived the red flag.

[46:06] And I get Robert was gonna sue everybody

[46:08] and your family if you did.

[46:10] But man, now that we get to go through the doors

[46:13] of Deeproot, what a disaster.

[46:15] Have you seen some of the walkthroughs of that place?

[46:18] Oh my God, it's, I, you know, originally I was saying

[46:22] we should give the guys a chance to produce.

[46:25] Don't you remember, I mean, you may not.

[46:27] I mean, they used to have these seminars

[46:30] and everybody was so excited.

[46:32] In 2014, I think was there for a seminar.

[46:35] And everybody thought this was a real thing

[46:38] because they had so much backing of big pinball leaders,

[46:43] you know, designers and such,

[46:44] and everybody was taken for such a ride.

[46:48] Oh my God.

[46:49] Yeah, but everyone needed a paycheck, it was the truth.

[46:52] And the paycheck was there.

[46:54] You know, he got a bigger PPP loan than Stern did.

[46:58] It was like,

[46:59] Yeah, he got like two million bucks.

[47:03] Yeah, it was like,

[47:04] it was just, it was so outrageous

[47:08] that somebody could actually think

[47:10] they could get away with it.

[47:11] But it was like a Bernie Madoff.

[47:14] I mean, he had to know it was gonna all,

[47:17] the shit was gonna hit the fan.

[47:19] These guys have to know.

[47:20] Yeah, I just think there's a lot of like delusion.

[47:23] There was a lot of narcissistic, sociopathic behavior

[47:27] with Robert.

[47:28] I just wanted all to go away at this point, right?

[47:30] The auction is over, the SEC is coming down on him.

[47:33] Those poor people that invested their life savings,

[47:35] they're never getting their money back.

[47:37] It's over.

[47:38] Onto greener pastures in the pinball world.

[47:41] Look, it's hard making pinball.

[47:42] I always say this, everyone who goes into it,

[47:45] I do think they go into it with good intentions,

[47:48] but Stern pinball has been doing this for 50 years.

[47:52] This isn't something you just throw money at.

[47:54] You need to have real knowledge of what it takes

[47:57] to make a complex machine with thousands of parts

[48:00] that need to be in the same room at the same time

[48:03] and then have people who know how to put it together.

[48:05] I wouldn't do it.

[48:06] I don't know how to do that.

[48:07] That's right, yeah.

[48:09] Todd, I love having you on the show.

[48:12] Congratulations again for the long overdue victory

[48:16] of favorite YouTube channel.

[48:18] I wanna just stand up right now and give you an ovation.

[48:21] Again, it was great being in that room.

[48:23] It was great being there for your moment.

[48:25] And I do remember, I do remember when you said last year

[48:29] that I should get something.

[48:31] Yeah.

[48:31] I remember, I do remember Chris.

[48:33] I really appreciate you supporting it too.

[48:36] Well, and many other people did too

[48:38] because it wasn't just my vote.

[48:39] I mean, you ran away with it

[48:40] and I think it was long overdue.

[48:43] And I really look forward to seeing you at a show soon.

[48:45] You're gonna be at Fantastic.

[48:47] Are you going to Allentown?

[48:50] Yes, I will be at Allentown for sure on Friday

[48:52] and maybe Saturday.

[48:54] Believe it or not, I'm believe it or not

[48:56] for probably the first time I'm going there to buy

[48:59] to try to fill up my bare showroom.

[49:03] Yeah, no, I feel like it's,

[49:04] there's no inventory, you guys need stuff.

[49:07] Todd, thank you so much for taking the time.

[49:09] Super appreciate it and always, always great to talk to you.

[49:13] Thank you, sir, appreciate it.

[49:14] All right, have a great night.

[49:15] Good night.

[49:16] Finally, it's happened to me right in front of my face

[49:21] and I just cannot hide it.

[49:24] Finally, it's happened to me right in front of my face.
