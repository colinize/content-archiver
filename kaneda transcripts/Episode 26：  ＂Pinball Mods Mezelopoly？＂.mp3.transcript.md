[00:00] I drink your milkshake!

[00:04] I drink it up!

[00:08] Don't blame me, Daniel!

[00:11] Welcome to episode 26 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I hope everyone out there had a great Easter weekend.

[00:27] I hope all of you have avoided seeing Batman vs Superman.

[00:30] That movie was absolutely terrible.

[00:33] Even though it made $170 million, you've got to be kidding me with that storylines

[00:38] axe knighter.

[00:39] It made absolutely no sense.

[00:40] Why would after Superman destroys an entire city-funny Zod, isn't that enough reason why

[00:48] Batman is pissed off at him?

[00:50] You also had a layer in this ridiculous storyline that he went over to the Middle East and

[00:56] caused the random killing of villagers, which by the way you didn't even show us that

[01:00] scene.

[01:01] You just gave us an eyewitness account.

[01:03] I mean, it was, it made no sense.

[01:06] Some cool scenes, Batman was pretty awesome, but besides that, a terrible terrible movie.

[01:12] But anyway, back to pinball.

[01:13] So on episode 26, I want to go into some topics that have been blowing up on the Pinside

[01:19] Inner Web.

[01:20] And those topics are the mod community.

[01:24] A lot of discussion going on recently about the future of modding in pinball.

[01:28] So I want to sort of give my points of view on that.

[01:30] I want to talk about Jersey Jack Pinball, possibly having the license to Harry Potter and what

[01:37] that means.

[01:38] There's a lot of conversation going on around that.

[01:41] And then just want to cover up on a few other topics that you guys have been discussing

[01:44] and share some for sale threads and some thoughts I have on those.

[01:47] So without further ado, let's get started on episode 26.

[01:52] Alright, so when it comes to the mod community, this is what it's been sounding like recently.

[01:58] I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

[02:02] I invented the piano key next time.

[02:05] I invented it.

[02:07] What if you got Derek?

[02:09] Nothing.

[02:10] You've got nothing.

[02:11] Nothing.

[02:12] Alright, so there's, there's just been a lot of discussion in back and forth about how

[02:19] people can appropriately sell mods to the community.

[02:25] And you know, there's just, it's just, this is like a hard topic for me to discuss mainly

[02:31] because I see both sides of it.

[02:34] And if we look, look at pinball over the past, like let's say we go back like 10 years and

[02:40] all these games are coming out mostly by stern, almost all them by stern.

[02:45] It really was the mod community who helped elevate a lot of these games who might have had

[02:52] sparse playfields or questionable art.

[02:56] It was the mod community that helped sort of like make these games even better.

[02:59] And we go even further back like let's go 20 years, even all the ballet Williams error

[03:04] games.

[03:05] The mods have always been an integral part of the collector pinball community and helping

[03:11] games sort of become their true potential in terms of what can be under the under the

[03:17] glass and on the playfield.

[03:20] And for all those years though, people would oftentimes make mods and sell them.

[03:26] They didn't have an official partnership with the license or the theme or the movie studio.

[03:32] But that didn't matter.

[03:33] They would just sell them and they were selling them to the pinball community, albeit under

[03:38] the radar because I doubt any of those movie studios or license holders really cared

[03:43] much if a few hundred pinball mods were being sold around their license.

[03:49] And that sort of is coming to an end.

[03:53] And it's coming to an end pretty abruptly in two different ways.

[03:58] And here's my assessment of what's been going on and people please email me, correct me

[04:04] if I'm wrong.

[04:05] It seems like there is sort of a division happening where two entities are rising to become

[04:12] the key stakeholders if you will in the pinball world.

[04:18] So on one side you've got mezzle mods who is sort of officially partnered with Stern

[04:25] to make authorized modifications for Stern pinball games.

[04:30] And then on the other side it seems you have Rick from Planetary or PPS and they seem

[04:36] to have the license for a lot of the Balli Williams titles.

[04:39] And so if you want to make a modification for either a Balli Williams game or a Stern

[04:47] game, there's just a lot of controversy around, well who do you have to have permission

[04:54] from to do that?

[04:57] There's been a lot of back and forth but here's my take on all of this.

[05:02] And I think this is also the accurate way to look at this.

[05:06] If you are making a modification that uses the license, like an IP of a license such as

[05:14] the logo such as characters from this show or film such as specific characters or vehicles

[05:23] from that film or movie or TV show, that is proprietary to the film itself or the license holder.

[05:35] So for example for Ghostbusters, if you want to make a mod and it involves, I saw someone

[05:40] is making a mod that's a light up of the Ghostbusters logo on the firehouse.

[05:45] Of course that is infringing upon the IP that Stern holds for the pinball mods and for

[05:52] the pinball game for Ghostbusters.

[05:54] So that is Adabounds.

[05:58] I just saw someone too is making really cool magnetic aprons and this started a lot of

[06:03] the conversation back and forth.

[06:05] And let's see, that was Ninja Boots, has these magnetic aprons that he's putting on the

[06:11] aprons of the pinball machine that sort of carries the art package over the apron.

[06:16] He's done this cool stuff for like fish tails and shadow and get away and they're really,

[06:21] really awesome.

[06:23] But in that thread you can start to see where people are starting to pop up and say that

[06:29] he's going to be contacted, he's going to get a season to cease, he's not allowed to

[06:32] do that.

[06:35] And that's another example where if he's just taking art that's inspired by let's say

[06:39] fish tails and the apron has like fishes that are drawn to match the art that's the art

[06:44] style that's on the play field, I think that's okay.

[06:48] That's not, he's allowed to do that and sell that without getting any permission.

[06:52] But once you put that fish tails logo in the middle of the apron then that is not okay.

[06:58] So the laws pretty black and white when it comes to this stuff.

[07:02] But here's what I heard happened around Ghostbusters specifically.

[07:06] I heard that, is it mesal mods or mesal mods?

[07:12] Was asking Stern or was asked by Stern?

[07:16] I don't know who asked for what, but all I heard is that they were going after or having

[07:21] Stern send season to cease letters to other modders out there that were sharing their

[07:25] modifications for Ghostbusters telling them they had to take those down and to stop.

[07:30] And like I understand why they're doing this.

[07:33] I mean it seems a little premature to be sharing all these mods with Ghostbusters anyway,

[07:38] right?

[07:39] I mean no one has the machine yet, no one is putting mods into the game.

[07:43] And Stern is realizing that there's a whole new world and there's a whole new revenue

[07:48] stream here with mods.

[07:49] I mean it's quite clear they did, I think a brilliant thing by removing the proton beams

[07:55] from the game.

[07:56] So if you're them think about it.

[07:58] You've got this modification that you know everyone is going to want to put in every single

[08:02] game of Ghostbusters, two proton beams down by the outlines.

[08:07] Think about how cool it would be if those proton beams fired their proton lasers right

[08:11] at slimer and like followed him or whatnot.

[08:14] I mean it could just be really really cool mod that everybody would want.

[08:18] Now why put it in the game if you could sell it as an extra mod for let's say $200.

[08:27] Maybe that's maybe the price is a hundred bucks.

[08:28] Let's just say it's $200.

[08:30] And let's say Stern sells 5,000 Ghostbusters games and 75% of those people upgrade with

[08:38] that mod.

[08:39] I mean that's a lot of extra money that they can get and bring in on these games.

[08:44] And so that's I think going to be the future of these pinball machines.

[08:48] Stern has watched and seen so many people make money on modifications, on mirror blades

[08:54] and all these different features that have infringed upon the IP that they're going to want

[08:59] it.

[09:00] They're going to want to you know piece of that change.

[09:02] And it's unfortunate though because here's why.

[09:05] I think what makes pinball collecting and makes this hobby so much fun is that there is

[09:11] a variety out there for things to get for your game.

[09:15] And there's not just like one person making the mods because here's why I don't like that

[09:19] because then every single game starts to look the same because all the mods you know are

[09:25] the same.

[09:26] You don't get an option of having a lot of different things if everything has to be

[09:32] officially licensed by Stern.

[09:34] Now here's the part that they can't do and I think they've been pushing too far on

[09:39] this but you can take any of the existing sort of play field toys and make a better version

[09:48] of it and sell that mod.

[09:50] So for example if you were to take the the stay puff marshmallow man and make LED lights

[09:55] for his eyes not that you would or take the the city landscape above the pop bumpers

[10:01] and LED out those windows that is not something that Stern can say you can't do.

[10:07] And I think you know there it just sounds to me like everyone's trying to put a lock down

[10:12] on all mods and that isn't the case and I think if you do make a mod that doesn't infringe

[10:18] upon the IP specifically then you really shouldn't just shut down your operation because you

[10:25] get a season to says they may not be able to actually enforce that and you should be good.

[10:31] But it's just you know it really is a shame that there's that that modding is sort of

[10:37] becoming so controlled and becomes such an official thing.

[10:43] I think it was a lot more fun when when we could just get mods out there and be scrappy

[10:47] about it.

[10:49] Of course within the limits of the law I have to that is important though I don't think

[10:55] you can just start making officially looking like translates and plastics and everything

[11:01] that aren't that have like the logos of characters on it that aren't approved.

[11:04] Now it does sound like there's going to be a middle ground here.

[11:07] I think if you do have a really nice mod and you proactively go to mezzle mods or Rick

[11:12] or Stern and you say look I'm developing this we want to make this an official mod.

[11:16] It does sound like they've been very nice and they're talking to people about making

[11:22] those things officially license mods for the game which is great.

[11:29] I also want to bring up there was a post by swings that is like the future of mods and

[11:35] he's calling it the modders code and he lists down like what the the modders code should

[11:39] be moving forward.

[11:41] Number one is he says don't do a blatant copy of someone else's mods you can cash in

[11:45] on someone else's design efforts.

[11:47] So a lot of discussion around that even saw or post in there he modded a sparky from

[11:53] Metallica and someone just like ripped it off completely and sold it that's despicable.

[11:58] I mean if someone is specifically making a mod that is very tailored and sort of you

[12:05] know unique design and you're going to just copy it and sell it as your own I think that

[12:10] is horrible and will always be frowned upon within the community and it's just something

[12:15] that should be avoided at all costs.

[12:17] Number two he says don't copy a mod and undercut someone else's mod with a claim that

[12:21] it can be done cheaper and for customers ask that ask is that potential cheaper one made

[12:28] of better materials.

[12:30] Okay so what he's saying here is like just don't remake a mod that already exists and

[12:35] undercut the person by making it of cheaper unless for quality.

[12:39] So all right well you know that's I think again like that one's up for debate you know

[12:46] who's the first person to make mirror blades and I've seen mirror blades existed different

[12:50] prices, pdi glass versus invisi glass so there are certain mods and games that I do appreciate

[12:59] there being some competition and people making stuff better without the price raising.

[13:04] I mean some of the mods that I buy it just seems like the price is astronomical for what

[13:09] you're getting.

[13:10] So for example look at the mod for Tales of the Ravian Knights the polished gold genie

[13:17] lamp is $175.

[13:20] You've got to be kidding me that that toy cost $175.

[13:25] It looks like a $10 toy.

[13:30] So how can that be that much but you know I would happily love it if someone made one

[13:34] of those that looked a lot more like it should be which is $50.

[13:39] So I have no problem with people coming in and saying like you're just ripping people

[13:45] off you're fleecing people with this mod I'm going to do it for cheaper and steal the

[13:49] whole market away from that.

[13:50] So I'm on the fence about that one.

[13:54] Number three he says support the guys that make quality mods I think that's a given I

[13:58] think that people who make quality mods will get a good word of mouth and will be the ones

[14:03] that people turn to for mods.

[14:06] Numbers four and five are pretty self explanatory support the creative guys I think that goes without

[14:13] saying.

[14:16] And also number five for the mod or help and listen to your customer don't just take the

[14:19] customer's money and forget them.

[14:21] So yeah I mean if you're trying to sell anything I mean that I think that goes without saying

[14:24] that the modders who are listen to their customers and get back to them too are the ones that

[14:29] are going to stick around I hate hearing these stories where people like take you know

[14:34] they send money for a mod and they don't hear about it for like months and they can't

[14:38] get in touch with the guy like that sucks.

[14:41] Number six he says a difficult one but worth bringing up is just because you write a public

[14:45] list of your design intentions but have no design started and don't action for months

[14:50] doesn't always guarantee you the ownership of the mod.

[14:54] Yeah I agree and look anyone who's got any idea who shares it before doing it is kind

[15:01] of an idiot I mean let's be honest here the rule number one of anything you're planning

[15:06] to do don't share your design or your idea before you've done it that's like giving away

[15:12] your ideas for free and of course people are going to steal it and do it and cash in on

[15:17] it if they have the ability to make it first that's just like rule number one of innovation

[15:21] is you got to be very protective and secretive over what your innovation is and almost keep

[15:28] it quiet until you can go to market with it.

[15:30] I mean even pinball companies in general don't really want to show you what they have

[15:34] going on until it's ready to ship so that other companies don't steal their designs

[15:37] and steal their layouts and steal their ideas the same holds true in the mod community.

[15:42] Number seven let the product do the talking high quality functional reliable okay that kind

[15:47] goes back to support the quality guys.

[15:50] Alright so I mean the net net here is look I think that Stern and MesoMods is being a

[15:57] little mesoMods in general is being a little bit hypocritical because he came up in this

[16:01] industry sort of creating mods on the black market if you will and the same way he came

[16:08] up he's also trying to prevent the startup guy from doing right now and I just don't

[16:13] really feel great about that I mean how can you eliminate the behavior that made you successful

[16:20] that made you what you are you're trying to remove people's ability to get there the

[16:27] same way and I think if people share really awesome ghostbuster mods even if it has like

[16:32] the logo and it has slimer I don't care like let people share it it's a great way for you

[16:38] guys to identify who's making kick ass mods and you should go to them be like hey let's

[16:43] make this mod official I think that's awesome and for those other guys who you know just

[16:48] look just maybe sell it a little bit under the radar and if you get a season decision

[16:51] you might have to stop but I don't think that mesoMods should be bullying the startup

[16:56] mod guys out of the picture and I don't I'm not saying they are I know that season

[17:01] the system letters went out and I think that was like a knee jerk reaction but I think

[17:06] that shouldn't be the first point of communication I think these guys should talk it out first

[17:11] and I hate it whenever lawyers get involved especially with something as silly as pinball

[17:15] modifications guys like I mean we should use the lawyers for the serious issues in the

[17:19] world not trying to protect pinball toys okay so that's my take and I think it's going

[17:26] to be interesting to see how this whole thing nets out over the next year but for now

[17:32] let's see who has the best mods and made the best mods win

[17:34] Harry Potter pinball what a theme right and there's I love the threat about the potential

[17:52] of Jersey Jack pinball securing a license to Harry Potter as potentially game number

[17:58] four so I want to tackle this from a few angles the first I want the first angle I want

[18:05] to tackle is is Harry Potter a good pinball pinball theme yes or no and I there's there's

[18:13] been a bunch of back and forth but I think if you think Harry Potter is not a good pinball

[18:18] theme or a big theme you are out of your freaking mind and I'm talking to you I think I'm

[18:25] talking to Captain Kirk here he was writing stuff like Harry Potter just doesn't sync up well

[18:30] with like the pinball demographic you guys your nuts Harry Potter is a multi billion dollar franchise

[18:37] that is up there with Star Wars right it's bigger than Star Trek it has fan bases that's that

[18:45] cover the spectrum of ages it's not just a kids book guys like look look at the phenomenon

[18:51] that was Harry Potter it had what like eight movies there's a Harry Potter world there's another

[18:58] book coming out there's more movies in the future Harry Potter is not some throw away little like

[19:04] doctor su-steem guys this theme is bigger than big it's bigger it's bigger than the Hobbit guys

[19:10] it's bigger than even Lord the Rings it's more relevant for a younger generation and even the

[19:16] current generation is more into Harry Potter than they are into Tolkien so they're both juggernauts

[19:23] I'm not saying one is better than the other but I just think Harry Potter was sort of being relegated

[19:28] to this you know this level of licensing and like a fan fandom that that wasn't even close to

[19:35] being accurate I mean it is a ginormous property so that leads to the other part of it is like

[19:41] could JJP secure the license now JK rolling in the past has said she doesn't like pinball because

[19:49] she doesn't want her property ending up in bars I mean it but I don't think she really understood

[19:57] the current state of the pinball market which is mostly the home collector so and when he comes

[20:03] to Jersey Jack most of those games are ending up in home collection so it makes sense that that

[20:09] Jersey Jack could show her the wizard of Oz and really win her over so and I think we heard when

[20:19] that employee left Jersey Jack pinball that Harry Potter was one of the licenses that they were

[20:24] rumored to have secured so I think it would be really cool to see a Harry Potter pinball machine

[20:30] I let's start there number two Jersey Jack pinball making Harry Potter what do I think of that

[20:38] I think that would be really cool as well I think Jersey Jack pinballs are absolutely stunning

[20:43] machines and I really hope they can get their act together and and get the machines out in a

[20:49] more timely manner I hope they can also ditch only making wide bodies I think that is working

[20:56] against them and I think that is going to change in the future so I think that is going to be

[21:02] alleviated but I also think that it's 100% enane to speculate this now in March of 2016 at the

[21:12] exact same time that Hobbits are shipping like finally people are already thinking about game

[21:18] number four and it really you know you just I don't know how you do that it almost is like

[21:25] getting excited for the Avatar sequel back in 20 what when did Avatar come out like 2013

[21:34] 2012 when we knew Cameron was going to take another like five years before it came out I mean

[21:40] the earliest it would seem to me the earliest that Jersey Jack could get out a Hobbit pin was

[21:48] is sorry is sometime in 2018 2019 at the earliest I mean it's just scary saying 2019 it's like when

[22:01] we'd see pinball number four but you got to figure Hobbits are just on the line and they're going to

[22:07] run for another two years Pat Lawler's pin supposed to be unveiled at Expo in the Fall winter

[22:17] and then you got to figure but that doesn't mean that game is going to be shipping like the following

[22:21] month I think Lawler's pin takes us into you know 2017 2018 and then you would think that was

[22:28] is when game four would come out after that so getting excited about Harry Potter and Jersey Jack

[22:34] pinball in 2016 you know it I just think it's pretty pointless it's it's fun to speculate but I think

[22:40] it absolutely means nothing and by the time that pin comes out who knows what where the whole

[22:45] hobby will be and what the competition will look like and and the state of the pinball industry so

[22:53] but I wanted to just figure out if if it was true or not and you know I so I called over to Jack

[22:59] the Jack you've had delays on the Hobbit and Wizard of Oz it seems like time isn't something that you

[23:07] guys have on your side when it comes to releases and with all this Harry Potter speculation do you

[23:13] guys think if if it's true you get a Harry Potter pinout within the next year or two and here's

[23:19] what his response was there's only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that allows

[23:28] to survive on earth 200 years ago I was a prince with power of Amelia well maybe that's why Jersey Jack

[23:47] takes a log to ship pins because Jack's been around for 200 years so uh no but I like I think it's

[23:52] cool if they get the license and they make beautiful pins and it could be a really interesting theme

[23:57] and for those of you who don't think it's a good theme I think you're out of your freaking minds

[24:02] all right well speaking of Jersey Jack the the Hobbits are shipping and I think it's great that

[24:07] these are going out there and they're entering into people's homes it's it's a moment we've all been

[24:12] waiting for and Hobbit reviews are starting to roll in and they're sort of popping up in a lot of

[24:19] different threads I wish someone would just start a thread I would start this if I could someone

[24:23] started a thread that's just Hobbit reviews because their their their the reviews are found all

[24:29] over the place they're in like Hobbit 2016 update um Hobbit arrived like there's like there's

[24:34] like Hobbit arrived or you know then there's like the Ghostbusters versus Hobbit thread and and like

[24:39] it's so hard to find the actual reviews the game by the people that are getting them maybe there

[24:45] needs to be like a Hobbit unboxing thread but someone just please please please start

[24:49] that thread it'll make it so much easier um so there's been like a bunch of reviews and and here's

[24:55] what I'm getting from the overall consensus I think that overall people think the pin looks great

[25:01] nobody will ever argue that it is not a stunning stunning pinball machine um they're they're the

[25:08] second point people usually make is that the code is is lacking that's not surprising um a lot of

[25:15] people are comparing it to their Wizard of Oz's and how was sort of ships with a similar incomplete

[25:20] beta code and that it took a while for the code to get to where it needed to be before was truly

[25:26] shine and you know it's unfortunate that the exact same thing is happening with the Hobbit I think

[25:34] we all agree that the the extra year they took to polish the pin should have allowed them to get

[25:43] the code further along so I don't even know really how to speculate anymore about why it's taking so

[25:49] long but I hope that that the Hobbit can go the same path as Wizard of Oz now there is obviously the

[25:56] questions around Ken Keith coded to be as fun considering there's not as much the shoot at but we'll

[26:03] see it's a different kind of game and I don't know I kind of just feel like we should wait and see

[26:08] like what happens um a lot of people are saying it's like just confusing how the start of mode in the

[26:14] game and in Lord of the Rings it's you know you it's very simple you shoot the ring and you know

[26:19] which mode you're picking but in the Hobbit someone was saying it's sort of hard to understand like

[26:24] when you're qualifying a mode and when does it begin and when does it end and maybe it would have

[26:31] been better if instead of having 32 modes that they had lesser modes but it was easier to understand

[26:37] when you're in them and again like I think all that can be fixed with better coding um I wanted to

[26:45] read out some of your reviews um this one comes from mr. mark 0673 he said he put some decent time

[26:54] on the Hobbit LE number 348 at pinball wizard he said it had great lights um long ball times

[27:01] too long in his opinion he said I'm far from a great player and I could shoot it for quite some time

[27:07] per game very few dangerous shots and the out lanes are generous way too open with not many satisfying

[27:13] shots going back and forth between was in the Hobbit and Hobbit just seemed so sparse with things

[27:20] with things to do um was was packed and had more fun on it than I then I did the last time I played it

[27:27] than it did um sorry guys I'm like reading word for it I'm just copying and pacing people's like

[27:32] post and like when their grammar is off it just sounds like I'm a mumbling idiot um but stick with me

[27:37] here uh he said just not enough going on the Hobbit for my taste he said slow like really slow going

[27:43] from full throttle or must say to the Hobbit made it feel like it was set up on a flat surface um well

[27:51] you know look I mean I think that we've said this a million times and stronger flippers in a

[27:57] better angle will definitely help the Hobbit so concrete hard hats said uh I'm surprised we're not

[28:05] hearing more buzz about the Hobbit as many have been delivered this week I'm looking forward to hearing

[28:09] some own reviews to which Captain Nemo replied probably because we've been seeing playing and hearing

[28:15] about the Hobbit for over two years now now I agree there's just utter fatigue and I think

[28:21] people who are getting the game are probably realizing across the board that they've got this beautiful

[28:26] pen but there really isn't the mode there yet or the code there to make you want to scream from

[28:32] the rooftops about something you just get in the machine um let's see Shamba's wrote I haven't

[28:40] heard a single exciting review of the Hobbit yet given the ridiculous amount of time it has taken

[28:45] to produce why is that they are multiple issues physically and why is the code apparently still so

[28:50] shallow have fun enjoy your LCDs supply well whatever I mean some of these are obviously more of a

[28:57] negative take um but here's here's like the one that I I'm starting to agree with the most and this

[29:04] came from TX star gays or three and I think this sort of sums of how I'm feeling about the whole Hobbit

[29:12] versus Ghostbusters comparison that's been going on and and the reason I say that is that thread is

[29:20] blowing up and all these people are chiming in and majority of those people haven't played either

[29:25] and so then it is a popularity contest and we said this in the last podcast um but he wrote

[29:31] the basic concept of Ghostbusters versus Hobbit implies an artificial adversarial

[29:36] relationship between them too we are so lucky to have two such games hitting the market this year

[29:42] yes I do realize that not everyone can order both like I did so they do compete for sales

[29:47] but the point is that one doesn't have to suck for the other to be excellent one may appeal to you

[29:51] more than the other but we have two great games in our hands enjoy all right well I think there's

[29:59] something to be said for that that we should be sort of celebrating the fact that there are two

[30:04] awesome new in box pin mom machine shipping that are based upon humongous themes and you can go by

[30:10] them and you can enjoy them uh I don't know either one is proven to be a great game at all though yet

[30:17] and I think both look great both have great potential but it is way too early to call either one great

[30:25] and we have to be honest and I've been getting a lot of feedback from people who have been

[30:29] emailing me be like Chris aka canada uh Chris you got to stop you got to stop comparing just like

[30:38] these new games to new games like people really will compare if a game is great or not

[30:43] to some of the greatest ballet Williams titles to games of yesteryears and they're right

[30:48] I mean it is is hobbit you know it let's say like hobbit is competing to be one of the greatest

[30:54] wide body pins of all time is it better than the twilight zone is it better than indiana jones

[31:00] uh it's too early to tell but there is some steep competition in terms of game becoming great

[31:08] and I hope both of them do become great pinball machines uh but I do want the code in the hobbit

[31:15] to be updated quickly and I I just still I still still still still still think jersey jack pinball

[31:22] had an opportunity to knock it out of the park with code that was further along and even though

[31:28] was came a long way I also think that by the time was became this great pin like nobody cared

[31:34] anymore nobody cared because you can't take two years or more to make the pin what it should

[31:43] it which what it should be code wise I just don't think you can do that it's like releasing a movie

[31:48] and then you just keep going and like re-editing and re-editing and until finally of a good movie but

[31:53] we've already seen it we've already played it we've already heard about it for two years and I

[31:58] you know I'm sure was as great as can be now but that ship has sailed in terms of getting excited

[32:05] and I don't want the same to happen to the hobbit you know but the time is exciting it's 2017 or

[32:12] 2018 I mean think about the pin was announced in 2012 and so the I hope a final game is not 2018

[32:21] I mean that's just getting ridiculous and you know so I'm always trying to get to the bomb and stuff

[32:27] so I called up Keith and I heard Keith has been you know locked in a room trying to get the code

[32:32] complete and he's he's staring at was he just finished like the was code and he's sort of like

[32:37] trapped in this this purgatory world between the Wizard of Oz land of emerald city and middle earth

[32:45] and the shire and the hobbit and he's I heard he's going fucking batshit crazy and the reason why

[32:50] the code isn't done is because he can't fucking things right and he's just like he's just he's just

[32:55] throwing in all this like these gibberish call outs and the codes are making sense and and I you know

[33:01] that's what I heard and so you know called over there and it's like you know I asked Keith like

[33:05] hey can you tell me how it's going on on on hobbit code and and here's what he said to me

[33:10] look you landed inside god you're about the little people now we represent the oven

[33:16] I'm in oven I mean oh no follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail follow the Ho Chi Minh Trail

[33:21] oh oh get you my pretty oh my god it's a wicked witch of the North is Hanoi Hanoi

[33:27] now little GI you and your little two new two

[33:33] yeah I'm really starting to get worried for Keith I think we need to have daily check-ins with

[33:37] him to make sure he's alright um but like we hope that comes together what else is going on

[33:42] on Pinside um why do you do a little something new on can you just pinball podcast where I

[33:48] am going to call in this low to high and a few games that are hit the marketplace for you guys

[33:52] who are looking for games to buy here just some that sort of popped out as being interesting Pins

[33:58] if you're thinking about adding something to your collection or even collecting a pinball

[34:02] machine for the first time so low to high we're going to go from low price to high price so

[34:07] starting off at $2,500 there is a data east back to the future for sale so who says you have to spend

[34:15] six to nine thousand dollars on a pinball machine with a fun theme back to the future obviously

[34:20] it's not one of the best pins out there but twenty five hundred bucks you could grab it it's a good

[34:25] condition have a lot of fun and you could end up selling that around that same price in you

[34:31] jersey for sale is a let's see it's an Ironman vault edition I don't know why I have Spider-Man

[34:40] vault edition here it's Ironman vault edition for forty nine fifty which is a really really good

[34:48] price for an Ironman vault edition and I think that is going to sell really fast if it has not

[34:52] already so if you're looking for an Ironman VE I suggest you look at that one up for sale for

[34:59] fifty three hundred bucks is an X-Men LE it is the blue I believe Wolverine LE I think this pin

[35:10] is selling in a great price I mean X-Men is a machine where there wasn't a premium you have

[35:17] the great LEs with Magneto the Wolverine and you know for fifty three hundred bucks this pin is

[35:24] gorgeous and that price point now right is starting to look really really attractive considering

[35:30] wherever the else is going okay so Captain Kirk is selling I think this is sec relich his his

[35:37] Star Trek premium for sixty nine hundred dollars it is loaded with mods so check it out I do think

[35:49] though a Star Trek premium at you know roughly seven grand for a used one is a lot of money

[35:57] and it is gorgeous though and for someone who loves the mod his machines it is not cheap to do

[36:02] what he has in his Star Trek premium in Kansas there is a for eighty two hundred bucks there is

[36:10] a gold trim MMR with low plays for sale actually this thing is sale pending so it might have been

[36:15] grabbed by the time this podcast but not a bad price for those waiting for a long time for MMRs

[36:22] to come out not too bad but I think those went like eighty three hundred new in box between eighty

[36:29] three and fifty five hundred so like I think you should lose more than a couple hundred bucks when

[36:35] you open up a pin mom machine and you play it but you can't go get a new in box medieval man is

[36:42] right now you'd be in a weightless I think the ones that are in eBay are closer to nine thousand so

[36:47] there's that and for ten thousand five hundred dollars a very very nicely modded

[36:53] tron ellie is for sale in Maryland and I took a look at this pin and it's got a lot of nice mods

[37:00] it looks like it's in great shape and I would much rather buy something like this tron ellie than

[37:06] the fifteen thousand dollar new in box because you'd want to put all the great mods he has on his

[37:14] on yours and those mods would set you back another at least a grand he's got mirror blades he's got

[37:19] like the light cycles the fling sign a lot of different things that you'd want to put on your tron

[37:24] and the only the only thing is he won't do delivery he'll only do a local pickup but he said I'll

[37:28] also bring it to all in town pin fest if you want to pick it up there so that's pins for sale the

[37:34] ones that sort of jumped out at me and there's always a lot on the market I you know whenever people

[37:39] get down or get like the new box bug I think you know you can always say she at the desire just

[37:47] have a new pinball by buying an old pinball machine that's in great condition and having it

[37:52] delivered and and there's never a shortage of great games for sell which is I which I think is a

[37:57] great part about the hobby what else what are their final thoughts do I have before we end this

[38:02] episode one thread that I that just think is is ass and I and ridiculous is the john pop a duke

[38:07] is the designer for the thunderbirds pinball machine that is being worked on there's a great great

[38:14] interview with Mike who's leading the thunderbirds project by the pinheads podcast that's pinheads

[38:20] with a z or z or however they pronounce it I just listened to that yesterday I recommend you guys

[38:25] go listen to that because it sheds a lot of light on where the projects at but I think if j pop

[38:31] was associated with this pinball machine there'd be a lot of mixed emotions I'll say this I I hope

[38:39] john can design and his talents make it on to a pinball machine again one day but I think attaching

[38:45] him to any project is is dangerous and brings up a lot of the bad karma that has been the fall

[38:54] out of z where so I'd be shocked if someone is looking to sell a pinball machine and as a marketer

[39:01] you know trying to market a pinball machine with john pop a duke's name on it in 2016 is is you

[39:08] know it's right up there with with yeah let's just get Kevin cool like on a machine too so I don't

[39:14] know I saw that thread and I just thought this is stupid like but I'm shocked that Mike I don't

[39:19] think he has needs to just come out and be like it's not true you don't want anyone you don't

[39:24] want that speculation going on he should be shutting that down immediately what else is going on

[39:30] well and today's episode by saying one last thing I bought another pinball machine and I had been

[39:37] on the fence with this for a while and I I love my Lord the Rings and I didn't want to sell it

[39:44] and it's one of the nicest Lord the Rings LEDs that I think you'll ever play and those people

[39:49] who have played it can attest to that and I decided a few things I decided hey I'm not going to sell

[39:54] my Lord the Rings I love it too much I don't care if there's a fault addition rumored I could always

[40:01] upgrade to that if that happens move my mods over to the new machine if they work on the new machine

[40:08] but also I don't even care about that I enjoy playing it and it's beautiful I don't think there's

[40:13] going to be like much of an enhancement on the VE or not even a noticeable enhancement and again

[40:17] like don't even care I it's just my first pin it's my first pin I remember the day it came I

[40:23] remember putting all the mods on I've had so much fun with it I've decided to replace it now when

[40:29] I replace a pinball machine I need to take a few things into consideration one is I don't want a

[40:34] machine my second machine to have as long a ball times because the Lord the Ring ball times are

[40:39] just way too long to have it to have it be your only pin and I also probably first and foremost

[40:47] though I need a pin that aesthetically fits my space now Lord the Rings with its brass armor

[40:53] with it's sort of like you know darker a little bit darker like but like lots of blacks and

[41:00] golds on it like it fits really nice in my living room so I wanted a pinball machine that fit

[41:04] nice like if I put a Ghostbusters Ellie in here it would look terrible it wouldn't work I can't

[41:08] work with bright green in my living room I wanted a machine that wasn't too hard and I'll say that

[41:16] for a reason I have a lot of people come by who casually play and I want to be able to explain

[41:21] what to do and have simple things to shoot at so they can enjoy it and not not have a pin that

[41:26] requires me to explain some like deep code so without further ado and I think some people have

[41:31] mentioned it on the form the second pin I bought was a beautifully restored tales of the Arabian

[41:37] Knights and an incredible gentleman up in Canada in Alberta restored one put a new CPR gold playfield

[41:46] replaced all the plastics all the ramps you know did a few other modifications to it has new

[41:54] cabinet decals has brassed out the the side rails the apron or the armor is all brassed out

[42:03] and it's just gorgeous if you guys search for toad and you'll see it for sale or it was for sale

[42:08] for eight thousand dollars firm and I reached out to him it was pending a sale and it didn't go

[42:15] through so I reached out to him and within the first 30 minutes of him contacting me back I had a

[42:21] a thousand dollar deposit over to him and paid the remainder of of of my offer and it's coming

[42:28] hopefully this week and so where will my Lord of the Rings be going my Lord of the Rings will

[42:32] actually be traveling north and staying at a friend's house who is a collector of pinball he has

[42:40] meticulous collection he takes great care of his games has a couple games there too that are

[42:48] other people owned that he preserves and I couldn't be happier I couldn't be happier it's the best

[42:53] of both worlds I can travel to play my Lord of the Rings within an hour I'll have the the tales of

[42:59] the Arabian Knights here and then I'm going to wait to see what comes out in the next year or so

[43:05] but I really really really am excited to be getting the tales of the Arabian Knights

[43:10] I've been on the hunt for so many fun mods to add to the game so I've got my mirror blades I got

[43:16] new speakers coming I got a topper coming for it I already got the brass coin door so it's

[43:21] going to look gorgeous I will share photos of it when it's fully done with you guys and and

[43:27] and it'll be posted in in the podcast thread for you to take a look at but I just want to let

[43:31] you guys know for all that you all those out there who was saying canate is a tire kicker and

[43:35] doesn't even have a collection and we'll never buy another pinball machine and also those people

[43:40] who said that canate or rips everybody off on every deal another satisfied customer so just want

[43:45] to say thanks guys who who helped me sort of make this selection and I'm really really excited to

[43:52] be having what I think is one of the most beautiful pins ever made with tales of the Arabian Knights

[43:59] so we will talk to you real soon I have a few interviews that I want to get up that I've recorded

[44:03] previously and if you'd like to be a guest on the show and there's a topic you want to talk about

[44:07] please hit me up at canate a pinball that's k-a-n-e-d-a pinball at gmail.com have a good day guys
