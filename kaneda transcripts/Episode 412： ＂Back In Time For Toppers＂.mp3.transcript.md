[00:17] Alright kids, we're back in the saddle. Welcome to episode 412 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:24] It's the only pinball podcast that has a wankatonia topper as part of its collector's edition.

[00:31] I had an amazing, amazing honeymoon in Tokyo and Seoul South Korea.

[00:37] I highly recommend at some point in your life you just get to Tokyo and Japan.

[00:42] It is an amazing culture that cannot be described on a pinball podcast okay.

[00:48] But let's jump right into it. Before I do anything I need to wish a happy

[00:54] five-year wedding anniversary to Chuck in Madison.

[00:58] Congratulations on five years. I know it's a little bit belated but I wanted to give

[01:02] you a shout out Chuck. Thanks for listening to the show.

[01:06] Madison is amazing. Okay, so let's talk about what's been going on in pinball.

[01:11] Now I've been away from the pinball scene for about two and a half weeks.

[01:15] I did give you the Christopher Franchie interview that I thought was amazing

[01:20] and I'm really happy Chris took the time and was very open, very well spoken and very candid

[01:27] about his experience in the pinball hobby. And I do think that the stories he tells are of value.

[01:35] And of course there are two sides to every story but wouldn't you rather here at least one side

[01:41] of the story because we never hear the other side of the story and we never will.

[01:46] Okay and I think the big picture people missed on this whole thing is I know people were debating

[01:52] whether or not like he should be allowed to sell artwork at different pinball shows.

[01:56] Those licensed holders do not care. They don't. The real thing people missed. To me the big story

[02:04] that Christopher Franchie was talking about was basically how the designers at Stern are under

[02:10] so much pressure to deliver games at a certain price point that they have to pull stuff out.

[02:16] That's really innovative and creative and I love the story of John Borg just going crazy when

[02:21] he had to remove stuff from the monster's game and that to me that's that's the big news.

[02:26] It's not about whether or not Mr. Franchie's being ethical selling 50 prints of Batman at a show.

[02:34] Okay and I do think that Chris has a lot of passion for this hobby and I think wherever his

[02:40] talents his talents I'm a little I'm a little jet lag you can tell wherever his talents fall

[02:46] will be of benefit to that manufacturer and it sounds like he's going to do more and more work

[02:51] for Chicago gaming company. All right so let's talk let's talk people. Let's talk about pinball

[02:57] because there was not a lot of news when people start talking a lot about the toppers in a pinball

[03:04] game you realize that we're short on news and information but that doesn't mean that a lot wasn't

[03:11] discussed at Expo. Not a lot of news but a lot of happenings in the pinball industry so let's do

[03:17] this on episode 412 of Canadian pinball podcasts. Let's just go down what people have been talking about.

[03:23] Let me try and tackle this a little bit differently. Let me go by what I think was the most significant

[03:29] news and we'll go in order of manufacturers. Now I think the company that sort of stole the show

[03:35] a little bit and had the most conversation going at pinball Expo this year was Chicago gaming company

[03:42] when they showcased the upgrade for medieval madness remake and for those of you who are unaware

[03:50] it's real simple. You can now upgrade your medieval madness remakes to look more like

[03:55] attack from Mars and monster bash remake so that means a bigger screen and a nice beautiful

[04:02] topper. The most important part of the pinball machine in 2019 is the topper but nowadays you can

[04:09] make all of your Chicago gaming company games look identical with big screens and beautiful toppers.

[04:16] Now here's why this news was interesting and I want to break this news down a little bit because

[04:21] I do think that Chicago gaming company is doing the right thing but I also think they're trying to

[04:27] engage a little bit in a marketing spin kind of BS thing that I want to talk about and that is

[04:34] this. They basically came out and said the following. We're going to remake 500 medieval manuses

[04:43] and those 500 will be a classic edition, a special edition and a what is it the royal edition

[04:53] that will have everything including powder coated armor and coin door and speaker panel the new

[05:01] topper RGB lighting I think black mirror blades I think give you all this stuff and they're basically

[05:07] saying this if you already have a medieval madness remake you can buy all of this stuff that we

[05:14] are going to make available and put it into your game. Albeit we know they're not going to make the

[05:19] armor available but for the most part you can get a bigger display you can get the new lighting

[05:24] and you can get the new topper so you could extensively take your limited edition

[05:29] medieval madness remake and incorporate the new elements of the royal and special editions of

[05:36] the game which is really cool I mean if you have a medieval madness you can now upgrade them

[05:42] to have the new stuff and the new stuff is beautiful I don't think anyone is arguing against

[05:47] the cool factor of the bigger display and that beautiful topper and the new lighting now

[05:53] here's where the debate gets a little questionable I here here's where I want to look at this whole

[05:58] situation so they are basically making what I've said will be more of like a special limited edition

[06:07] or super limited edition of the game because they made 1000 limited edition versions I think is

[06:14] 1000 or 12,500 LEs of medieval madness okay now they are saying they're only going to make 500 of

[06:23] this new run and that 500 will include the classic the stand the special and the royal and the way

[06:32] they're positioning it is this they're not going to tell you how many royal editions they're going

[06:38] to make they are going to take orders for classic editions and special editions and whatever's

[06:45] left over that's how many royal editions they will make but see the whole thing is kind of BS

[06:52] and how they're communicating this because here's why all of that is just marketing spin by the

[06:58] distributors but you know where they're basically saying get your order in now because it's going

[07:03] to sell out well how many are they're going to be well we're not going to tell you how many they're

[07:07] going to be so wait so how do you know when you're going to sell out well I'm not going to tell

[07:12] you when we're going to sell out because we don't even know the number and I just I'm just getting

[07:17] tired of these sort of like manufactured arbitrary editions in which the consumer is completely

[07:24] in the dark about what number game he has out of that number okay so for example why can't they

[07:32] just tell us if they sell a hundred classic editions and a hundred special editions that there

[07:40] will be 300 royal editions out in the world and why can't they just a number those royal edition

[07:47] games now you know why because they don't want the limited edition folks to be pissed off that the

[07:53] royal numbers are lower but here's why I think the whole thing is stupid because regardless

[07:59] regardless of whether or not they number these royal edition games they will always be more limited

[08:07] than the limited edition games and now I'm just using stupid vernacular like this limited is

[08:14] more limited than those limited it's so stupid I don't know why these companies can't stop this

[08:20] nonsense and just tell us how many they're making of each version see the other part is this

[08:28] they then go on to say we are not going to make any more royal editions and then okay but that

[08:35] doesn't stop them from six months from now making a blue sparkly powder coded version of the game

[08:44] with blue armor and calling it something else and and saying hey we're we're doing another run

[08:51] and so ultimately I think we all know by now that none of these companies limited edition games are

[09:00] a truly limited b will never be made again they'll just find a new way to rename it something else

[09:08] and then they can do another run now do you like that or you do not like that see I think collectors

[09:14] are getting screwed left and right in this hobby and for you Ellie owners out there I mean come on

[09:21] there's no way you're feeling great about this because if medieval madness is a game that you love

[09:26] that you want to have the best version of there's just there's just no way around it you don't have

[09:31] the best version of it because the best version of it will be the one with all the bells and whistles

[09:37] now as much as you can upgrade yours you still then won't have the rarest version of the game which

[09:44] adds value it just does add value okay now I don't blame Chicago gaming company for doing this

[09:51] but I think they're kind of trying to do it in a way that doesn't piss off the original

[09:57] Ellie owners but everyone's too smart they see right through these tactics okay and we're already

[10:04] seeing people on the inside saying I'm selling my Ellie to get a royal edition because they know

[10:10] they know that when all the dust settles it will be the royal editions that are the rarest and

[10:16] most sought after versions of this game that everyone loves I just wish we could get to a point now

[10:22] where we would stop with these shenanigans it's like the yellow brick road edition of was where

[10:27] it's like well how many you make in jack well we're gonna make 250 this year and when people buy

[10:32] a wizard of a house the yellow brick road edition it tells them what number their game is like you got

[10:37] game number 127 well it's like out of how many well we don't know I mean come on you either have

[10:44] to give a collector what they want which is they just want to know what number of of what number

[10:51] they have that's it and it means something to them and you have to respect that you have to

[10:57] respect that that that's what matters because it's part of the story that I've won of only 50 L

[11:03] virus or 80 batman's not oh we're just gonna make another version and that's that so but look I

[11:10] think Chicago gaming company has been looking at one thing they've been looking at the amount of

[11:16] money stern pinball has been making on games that have half as much in them and if you're a Chicago

[11:24] gaming company you have to be saying to yourself wait a minute we're making the best versions of

[11:30] the best games ever and they just sold Lvira for 15 thousand dollars by just putting a piece of

[11:38] couch on an apron and saying they're only making 50 and then they're making the exact exact same game

[11:46] for ten thousand dollars they're making a five thousand dollar profit on a game by putting nothing

[11:54] in it and people just stood by and said hey if it's fun bye bye bye and it's ridiculous and this

[12:00] company's put so much more into these games and I think you have to look at a game like monster

[12:05] bash remake for eight thousand dollars and say they're losing money they're they're leaving money

[12:11] on the table by selling monster bash remakes for that cheap I'm sorry but if you look at where

[12:16] games are selling nowadays there is no way a Chicago gaming company game that's fully loaded with

[12:23] a topper should be cheaper than a stern le that has half as much in it has no topper to oftentimes

[12:32] doesn't give you you know like like a third of what's mechanically in the game I just I can't

[12:41] I can't they they must be watching stern very closely and saying we're leaving millions of dollars

[12:49] on the table let's go get some of it so I do think what they're doing is smart all right so that's

[12:55] Chicago gaming company we'll see what happens with how many royal editions make it out into the world

[13:00] I I love it I mean I I'm gonna be honest with you I moved over I moved over my my willy

[13:06] wonka collectors edition deposit over to a royal edition of medieval madness remake I've always

[13:15] wanted a medieval madness remake I just didn't really feel like inclined to pull the trigger because

[13:20] they were making so many of them but now with this full package I think it might be the right kind

[13:26] of game to put next to Batman we'll see I still have a lot of decision making to make in November

[13:32] I still want to see if karate kid is the next game I don't think it's going to be after after knowing

[13:37] no you know nobody has come out and been like canate is right I think that rumor might be wrong I

[13:43] might have been set up but Brian Eddie's game is next so here's what's incredible is that Brian

[13:50] Eddie's game will be next from stern and Brian Eddie's medieval madness remake will also be going

[13:56] back on the line like he's going to be competing with the best version of his prior self now I

[14:04] can tell you this there's no way stern pinball will give him the amount of money in terms of like

[14:11] the mechanisms and the engineering that medieval madness have like the still that damn castle is

[14:17] still on the greatest toys in the history of pinball all right so let's talk about stern Elvira

[14:21] Elis are going out the games look great the owners of the games will justify them by saying

[14:28] they're awesome but we all know that the game has a long way to go with the coding but it's Lyman

[14:33] Sheets so it's a silly debate to wonder whether or not the game will be coded well it'll be one of

[14:37] the best coded games ever because that's what Lyman Sheets does I will say mechanically I've seen a

[14:44] lot of issues people are having with their new inbox games and I'd be a little bit concerned because

[14:50] not a lot of games have gone out yet and there seems to be a higher volume of stuff going wrong with

[14:57] the game mechanically so let's keep a close look at that game so there's been a lot of things

[15:03] reported wrong from different owners okay but the big news was looking at the white wood of

[15:09] Dennis Nordmann's original design of Elvira and what was yanked out did you see that happened

[15:15] over the last couple weeks my god they had it had like those amazing white wooder ramps in the

[15:20] game it also had this amazing diverter on the left ramp that divert at the ball around the back

[15:27] of the house which was super cool that's gone so clearly stern yanked out some of the really fun

[15:34] elements of the game I think for me it would have been awesome to have those white wooder ramps

[15:39] in the game because I think that's part of you know Dennis's signature and he must look over that

[15:45] game now and be like oh they removed a lot of the stuff that made this game me but we know we know

[15:52] that this is what stern does like they take out stuff that's not necessary like because you could

[15:56] look at the game and be like is it necessary that we spend more money on these really cool ramps

[16:02] will we still sell the game and and obviously they're right like the fact that they sold all these

[16:07] games so quickly with those boring straight ramps or the ramp returns is is just it just indicates

[16:14] that whoever's making the decisions over there is right like they understand like we're such a

[16:20] bunch of suckers that because we're not demanding more from these games they will continue to see how

[16:27] far they can take stuff out all right now look I think it might be a little early to call it but

[16:33] I'm going to call the game of the year at this this year's twippies is going to be Jurassic Park now

[16:40] I have not seen a game get so universally applauded as Jurassic Park and I mean these are from people

[16:47] that are normally skeptical and cynical and I'm just hearing it is such a fun game to shoot and I

[16:54] look forward to playing a premium le I've played the pro I think this is why Jurassic Park is been so

[17:02] successful or has been or is is being so you know applauded by the community it's Keith Ellwyn I mean

[17:08] there's no way around it I mean Keith Ellwyn I think Keith Ellwyn has something that destroys

[17:17] uh you know the pressures that other designers fall victim to because I here's what he I think he

[17:23] does I think even though Stern has a low bomb I think he knows how to design a game that feels very

[17:31] unique very refreshing and understands that you can still make up a pinball machine special unique

[17:40] have a lot of satisfying shots have a lot to shoot at and understand like the rule sets and everything

[17:46] that is needed to make a pinball experience very rewarding for both the casual player and the expert

[17:54] player I think he understands masterfully how to do that with a game and I think you have to look

[17:59] no further than Jurassic Park because when you stand over a Jurassic Park it doesn't feel like another

[18:05] cookie cutter fan layout Stern game it really feels like it's his design at work and and I would

[18:15] love to see like Keith Ellwyn at a Jersey Jack or the Chicago gaming company just to see how much

[18:21] more he could do if he had more money to put into his games but despite of that he doesn't even need it

[18:29] to make a really interesting fun layout and I think that's what pinball needs more of is looking at a

[18:35] game and saying how can we just make this layout unique and and that is why I think people gravitate so

[18:43] much towards Keith's games is their refreshing they break up a lineup that might all feel similar

[18:52] and so Jurassic Park not only does that but then it's like Jurassic Park right it's like you hear the

[18:57] Jurassic Park theme song and you're in that Jurassic Park world and even though it's not based on any

[19:03] of the Jurassic Park movies it's sort of is inspired by all of them and it does feel like a unique

[19:09] Jurassic Park adventure would I have rather had it be the first movie absolutely I think everybody would

[19:16] but again I think Stern was very upfront and honest about how they approach this game and I think

[19:22] people look at it that way and I think people enjoy it that way because they they're not being

[19:28] misled to think it was going to be something else all right so I look forward to playing that game

[19:32] but I think that game is going to win game of the year just based upon people's feedback of the game

[19:37] itself all right what else is going on in the pinball world let's talk next about the six month

[19:46] in the making collectors edition of the willy wonka pinball machine by jersey jack pinball so

[19:54] I don't know what people were fully expecting here because we saw the the game matrix of what

[20:01] you were going to get from willy wonka collectors edition way back when this game was first

[20:06] introduced to us I believe it was April of 2019 seems like a long time ago doesn't it so here's

[20:13] here's what we finally got we finally got a video right before expo showcasing to us the collectors

[20:19] edition of willy wonka pinball now it makes it makes sense to get the video out right before the show

[20:26] so that way people can actually order the game at the show and distributors who are going to be

[20:32] there with customers can can take orders on the game now what are my thoughts on the willy wonka

[20:37] collectors edition of the game and I'm just I'm just going to give you my thoughts based upon the

[20:42] actual package of the game you know my thoughts on the game itself nothing has really changed

[20:47] with the collectors edition other than the veruka salt callouts that are in the game so I think

[20:52] it's like a little bit of like good bad and ugly okay so I think the good parts of the game are

[20:58] that I think the game is beautiful and I think they made a beautiful game look even more beautiful

[21:03] with the collectors edition if you love this game and you want the most beautiful version of it

[21:08] there's no way you would want anything other than the collectors edition that candy red armor with

[21:14] the sparkle the sparkle artwork on the playfield there's new playfield artwork which differentiates

[21:21] it a little bit like willy wonka is now inside a circle and there's more red in the game I think

[21:26] it looks really nice there's different cabinet artwork with the rad cows it's it's a gorgeous

[21:32] looking game I've I've always said willy wonka to stand over that game you can fall in love with it

[21:38] just by looking at it absolutely gorgeous looking machine okay it's got inner art blades in it

[21:45] it's got you know the gobstopper you know shooter rod in it it's got under cabinet lighting I think

[21:51] all these things aesthetically the game looks great okay then we get to the top of the game and the

[21:59] topper of this game was supposed to be the wankatonia moving ship and that was what was promised

[22:06] in the design matrix when people were first introduced to this game and we didn't get that it's

[22:12] an oompa lupa with a wankabar and it's interactive lighting on top of it now you know maybe three four

[22:20] years ago a topper like this flies in a world in which months sorry medieval madness topper is

[22:27] phenomenal the black knight topper is phenomenal did you see the black knight topper super cool

[22:33] interactive I mean nothing can save the black knight from being a bargain bin game in a year you're

[22:38] gonna see black knights like Ellie's and premiums for like five to 5500 and I bet the pros are

[22:43] gonna be like three grand soon but albeit at least her and put some effort into the topper when

[22:48] you look at that willy wonka topper and jack had six months to get a sexy topper on top of the

[22:55] machine it looks like an oompa lupa took a little bit of a dump on top of the machine I mean look

[23:00] at the shape of it it looks it looks bad it's not good it looks cheap it looks like an afterthought it

[23:08] it doesn't it doesn't even cover the top of the game and that's the other thing about toppers

[23:14] you know they they looked they looked best when they they go almost across the entire top of the game

[23:22] look at the Batman topper look at the monster bash topper look at the attack from Mars topper look

[23:26] at the medieval madness topper you know look at the black knight topper I just I just think the

[23:32] topper looks like they mailed it in a little bit I don't understand it doesn't look good okay but

[23:37] you know what toppers are topper because here's the thing even if you don't like that topper

[23:42] you can go and you can get an aftermarket willy wonka topper there's lots of nice ones out there

[23:47] there's even lots of really nice willy wonka sort of toppers from the slot machines that are out

[23:52] there in the world that you could buy and probably retrofit to the game okay so then we get to the

[23:57] ugly and and this is this thing I've been talking to some of my friends about and I've just been

[24:02] pointing at this thing and saying you know see to me this is 100% what frustrates me with Jersey

[24:11] Jack Pimble and I've said this since like I don't know the last few releases there's always like

[24:16] these things they do that just make you sort of scratch your head and be like what what how how

[24:23] did they the company that you know makes the most premium Pimble product on the planet and they do

[24:31] how does a company that makes the most premium Pimble product on the planet that is supposed to

[24:37] have six months to get the highest end version of this game out into the world how did they stand

[24:44] that god awful hideous signature plate that covers up half of the apron artwork with like eight

[24:53] signatures on it why are there so many signatures to begin with but that thing is hideous on a whole

[25:00] new level I don't think I've ever seen a Pimble machine in the history of Pimble machines

[25:06] uh display signatures in a way that bad and that poor like there was no thought put on into that at all

[25:16] and and this is what frustrates me about about stuff like this and people are like well I love

[25:21] out some of the owners are like well you can just remove it it's it's so easy to remove it I know

[25:26] my friend Derek I can hear him saying it right now Derek I'm always going to call you out because

[25:30] why should someone have to remove an element like that from their collector's edition like

[25:38] I don't think that makes any sense have you ever heard in the history of Pimble owners talking

[25:43] about how they can remove the signatures from the game that are of the people who made the game

[25:50] itself now if that is not a afterthought installment to this game I don't know what is and this is

[25:58] why I just really want people to understand that you deserve better than this and I get it's not

[26:05] a big element it's not a big thing but to me it is and I'll tell you why it's a big thing and

[26:11] and maybe this is part of me coming from Japan a country and a culture in which details matter so

[26:17] much like they they have such pride in every little thing they do especially when it comes to technology

[26:24] to innovation I mean the taxi drivers in that country they keep their cars so clean and perfect

[26:30] the doors open for you automatically those seats are covered in white cloth everything every detail

[26:36] matters and when you stick this ugly signature plate on your most beautiful Pimble machine what is

[26:45] that say to us about how you care about the details because to me that signature plate it's like

[26:52] having a tomato stain on a beautiful white shirt it doesn't matter that it's small it's there

[27:00] like it's unavoidable and it just never should have passed the inspection of anyone over there

[27:07] who's got a creative eye like how do you have artists how do you have Pat Lawler how do you have

[27:13] a creative team that stands over this game and says well where can we sign it that will look good

[27:19] I mean look what Stern just did and and and do you see Stern the way the signatures are on the

[27:24] a viral game actually who you know who designed that it was Christopher Franchi he came up with

[27:29] that design of having the signatures nicely put on to the apron artwork like that with their you

[27:35] know perfect perfect how do you how do you see how people do it and then you do it like that

[27:42] and again it's just it's mind boggling to me I know it's not a big thing I know it's not a gameplay

[27:47] feature I know it's not any of that but to me it's much more representative of a moment in which

[27:54] a company is just mailing it in and you can't be the best and do crap like that you you they're

[28:03] better than that and that's why we get frustrated with Jersey Jack pinball on this show because

[28:07] they're better than that they know how to do it better than that they've shown us they can do it

[28:11] better than that and that's the problem is like when you give people the pirates of the Caribbean

[28:15] topper which is one of the best toppers in pinball history you can't go back and then just to

[28:20] crap on it and that has been the story of me with Jersey Jack and he might not like me it's one

[28:26] step forward he takes us forward in pinball he and then he then two steps back with with crap

[28:33] like that I mean come on every move needs to be progress every move should be an advancement

[28:40] on your own progress okay keep taking us forward Jack because like I love the stuff like the

[28:46] Bluetooth connectivity and Wi-Fi connection and automatic updates you know I love that fact you know

[28:52] I love it Ken over special one lit was like games gonna upload you know it's gonna update itself

[28:57] it tuned the morning when you're sleeping it's like no it's not Ken because the game is off the

[29:01] game is not turned on at two in the clock in the morning or unless you sleep with your pinball

[29:07] all right so that's what I just hope they do I hope they stand over these machines and they

[29:12] just get it right it's so it Jersey Jack again they're always like 85% of the way there to making

[29:18] like the greatest games ever and I just think certain elements they just need to play a little bit

[29:24] more attention to all right but but here's thing will they sell 500 of them at this stage in the

[29:30] game I don't know you know it's an interesting question I don't know if they will I think the

[29:36] sell through to distributors will be very strong there are still LEDs in box though it is hard to

[29:43] look at this CE as maybe being worth that much more than the limited edition but you do get stuff

[29:52] that's not found in the Ellie like I really do like the Veruchus salt callouts I like the fact that

[29:59] the only place you can get those is in the collectors edition I've been saying it I don't understand why

[30:06] more of these high price games don't have gameplay features that are exclusive and I do applaud Jersey

[30:12] Jack for doing that I mean it's one of the most special parts of my Batman are the custom

[30:17] Adam West callouts for the SLE owners and so I think that is something that separates the game from

[30:24] the Ellie I think the obviously the CE looks much better but from a gameplay standpoint you're

[30:31] not going to have more fun with the collectors edition you're not it's just probably won't happen

[30:38] but I think if you love Willy Wonka and you want the version that's going to stay in your house

[30:41] forever I definitely think the collectors edition will be on your radar I also think at 500 of them

[30:49] you'll probably be able to pick one up for less than 12 5 if you just wait a little bit okay so

[30:55] the question for Jersey Jack becomes when does the next game get displayed guns and roses is next

[31:00] worst kept secret in pinball I would expect to see guns and roses in January that is what I would

[31:06] expect all right spooky pinball so I kept thinking about spooky pinball when I was in Japan and I'll

[31:13] tell you why because when I was in I believe it's Shinjuku and there is a hotel in which Godzilla is

[31:22] on top of the hotel in every hour he roars and Godzilla is amazing I saw the movie on the plane

[31:28] right over there and it's such you know Godzilla to me is like very much like pinball it's like

[31:33] nerdy geek like subculture like is like entranced in in in Godzilla gojira and so I kept thinking when

[31:41] I was out there that Godzilla would make a great pinball machine and I and I got like a little bit

[31:47] upset because if you're a fan of Godzilla we know spooky and and chuck and bug or huge fans of

[31:54] Godzilla it kind of annoyed me the more I thought about the fact that stern pinball went and basically

[32:02] hijacked the Godzilla theme from Chuck and where's the game right they do they really have a

[32:09] desire to make that game I mean when we heard from fransi that stern pinball turned down titles

[32:15] like beel juice and superman 78 and wonder woman because they didn't have a passion behind those

[32:22] games do we really believe that the designers over at stern are we're dying to make the Japanese

[32:29] Toho version of Godzilla the way Chuck and bug wanted to make it and so it just pissed me off it's

[32:35] I just feel like there should have been more of an outcry from the community that stern pinball

[32:41] went and kind of like robbed them of their dream theme and I would rather them make this game because

[32:47] I feel like only a die hard geek and nerd about Godzilla would really do that game justice and

[32:55] understand the nuances of Godzilla and why it's such a beloved franchise and and I just think that

[33:03] we as a community should a stern pinball to rescind their license of Godzilla and hand it back to

[33:12] spooky I do I think stern has enough blockbuster titles that I bet Godzilla is like on the

[33:19] sealist somewhere for them of like maybe we'll get around to making it one day but in the meantime

[33:24] they like completely robbed it I mean you the story of like Chuck and co meeting with the

[33:30] licensor and then jody walking in right after them and like taking it from them like such BS

[33:36] such BS I'm sorry I'm sorry but I just I just wanted to say that I that I kept thinking about

[33:42] that as I looked into the eyes of Godzilla so while speaking of spooky pinball they released a

[33:48] topper who are back to toppers again of Alice Cooper's nightmare castle it's got like a brain in a

[33:54] jar with like all these dials and I have to say it's not the prettiest thing it's it's it's not

[34:02] it it reminds me of like that brain inside of that ninja turtles character remember in the arcade

[34:08] who's got like the brain inside his stomach I don't know it looked really it looked weird I think

[34:14] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is a beautiful machine I'm not quite sure I would put that thing

[34:19] on top of it I probably wouldn't I don't know it's just something about like this nightmare castle

[34:27] and then that things up there just looking more like like a brain in a jaw I don't know I just don't

[34:33] see the connection really but maybe it's because I don't understand like the storyline and where that

[34:38] fits in but it's only like $299 which you know for an interactive topper that's not a bad price all

[34:46] things considered let's see what else is going on in the pinball world all right so let me let

[34:53] me talk about a couple other things and so haggis pinball okay so they're like the new kid on the

[35:01] block and they've got the sales game and people you know whenever a new pinball company comes out it's

[35:07] always the same thing the first you got the people like just cheerleading yeah we got we got another

[35:12] pinball manufacturer out there in the world awesome and then there's just the reality of well can this

[35:18] machine sell in 2019 considering the options that are out there and when you when you look at the

[35:24] pinball marketing not or the marketplace the landscape is not just new in box it's like whatever

[35:30] they're asking for that game what else could I get for that price now you have new in box options

[35:37] you also have tons of good condition older games that are also available and so when you look at

[35:43] this game you look at the art package you look at the layout you look at everything about it

[35:49] yeah you know it's just it's just it just to me feels like another sun coast pinball cosmic carnival

[35:55] venture and I get that these guys have the passion to make pinball but it's more than passion it's

[36:02] it's passion and talent to make pinball succeed and you need both and you need almost more talent

[36:10] than passion to be commercially successful in pinball these days so we'll see I just again I think

[36:17] people love to pat people on the back for getting a game in a box but who cares if you get a game in

[36:24] a box and nobody wants it or it's not successful what did you really do how relevant are you like

[36:31] did you even make an impact and I don't think a game like that with what's out there can break through

[36:39] I I don't I I don't understand like what market research you do to land there with your with your

[36:47] offering I'd love to have them on the show to discuss that if they feel like coming on but I

[36:53] think it's a difficult marketplace now speaking of difficult marketplace American pinball

[36:58] October fest they've had a code overhaul all right and so that is much appreciated by

[37:06] October fest owners they've actually improved on the animations which is a good thing

[37:12] and so American pinball is you know I think they're getting ready to say October fest is done

[37:17] pretty soon because we know that their third title will be around the corner we also know they're

[37:23] making a redemption game that is a ginormous redemption game but that's not their third pinball

[37:29] offering that is something else they're doing now it is it is interesting that they're going into

[37:34] redemption games they're called American pinball and they're making redemption games now when I was

[37:40] in Japan redemption games are everywhere the first three floors of our Cades in Japan are all

[37:45] redemption games okay it's all like things hanging from strings and claws and trying to push stuff

[37:52] over to have it fall through so it does make sense if they're looking at a business model and we

[38:00] look we can manufacture like these things and these things and these things like is pinball the only

[38:06] thing we can assemble with our assembly line and the answer might be no and so if there's more

[38:12] demand for redemption games from operators which there is okay so that's the other part too

[38:18] there is way more demand globally for redemption games then there is for pinball machines okay we're

[38:24] gonna talk about this at the end of this podcast and some of the things I've been reflecting on

[38:29] but there just is so that's gonna be next but then we know there's going to be a third pinball

[38:34] title around the corner so we didn't see it yet so as I said I don't think you're gonna see

[38:39] American pinball's next title until tpf because I don't think they're gonna show it until it's

[38:45] ready to go on the line I don't think they're gonna make the same mistake again and do some like

[38:50] six month early reveal so we'll see what title that is I'm I'm just curious to see what the redemption

[38:56] game is too okay but October fest I don't think they're gonna sell close to a thousand of that game

[39:02] it doesn't matter that they do code updates at this point the game's been out pretty much a year

[39:09] it was shown a year ago and so you know the way the market is now if your game doesn't become

[39:16] a hit at the beginning it's it's really hard to have a slow burn successful pinball game nowadays

[39:23] there's just too much that is constantly coming out all right what else is going on in pinball

[39:29] Dutch pinball so I don't know what to do with the whole Dutch situation it seems like there are

[39:35] a few people on the forum that keep apologizing for them and keep saying that they're they're

[39:39] figuring it out the last rumor I heard was that Barry's been able to make six or seven new games

[39:46] and send them to people now the question I have where the photos of these six or seven newly made

[39:52] games how much of how much of that game was built from the ground up or how how many of those

[40:00] games were partially assembled at a.r.a. before Barry you know put them in a box and where are they

[40:06] right because I heard that the early achievers were supposed to get new sort of special elements

[40:12] added to their games I've not seen an early achiever who just got a new game unbox it yet and show

[40:21] us what's in it that is differentiating and so then the question becomes and this is the big

[40:28] question is is can they figure this out because you know he said he's going to be able to make like

[40:35] 500 of these things by the end of the year which will then get all the early achievers their games

[40:43] who did not get their games yet you know how I feel about this thing it it has to be Ponzi scheme

[40:49] economics I don't know how you how you do it how does he get the money to make the games because no

[40:54] one's going to preorder these things so I think Dutch Pimbal remains a big question mark and I

[41:01] hope people get their games in the end but until I see real progress and again like we live in a

[41:07] world where there's where there's a technology where Barry could easily do a Facebook live and show

[41:15] us a live version of the production facility or share photos or give us updates but he doesn't right

[41:22] weeks go by with no word on what's happening and so that's what happens like it's always the same

[41:27] story with Barry no word on what's happening there's always one or two European apologists for him

[41:33] on Pinside who are like everything's going great and yet you never see any actual evidence that

[41:39] things are going great and history has shown us that things never go great in the world of Dutch Pimbal

[41:46] okay now speaking of European companies we did not see any alien Pimbal at expo so I was wrong on

[41:53] that one but I I don't know what to think about with the Pimbal brothers I don't they're still around

[42:00] but again these are just like super wealthy multi-millionaire guys so they're like they're

[42:05] they'll always be around they could always decide to put more money against Pimbal but until we

[42:12] see something concrete I think the knowing that they've been going around to different manufacturers

[42:19] leads me to believe that the future for alien if there is a future is to see a game from either

[42:26] Chicago gaming or American Pimbal from them I think that makes the most sense all right

[42:32] speaking of looking around for a manufacturer what about this game what about the Kingpin remake

[42:38] that wasn't I think they brought the same game again to expo what do you think about this one I

[42:44] mean this one to me is somewhat annoying and I'll explain why Kingpin had like super sought after

[42:52] rare game that only like a few prototypes were out in the world they were they were trading for like

[42:58] 30 to 50 thousand dollars and these guys like we're remaking it okay how many years ago is that

[43:03] like two maybe plus years ago this it's forever in the making game same thing with that circus

[43:11] maximus game the Pimbal circus game forever in the making and I don't know like either you have a

[43:16] plan to get to manufacturing or you don't and how long is this thing going to drag on right how long

[43:24] before it starts to feel dated now in the process what they've done is they've completely destroyed

[43:30] the collectibility on some level and like the rarity and the sought after nature of the original ones

[43:35] because you've got to be nuts to go by if they're going to remake the same exact game you got to

[43:40] be nuts to go by the original I know some people want the original like serial number matching pins

[43:47] most people don't care about that but I just either just it's 2019 like I just think if you have a

[43:53] plan to remake a Pimbal machine just figure out how to get it done before you announce it to the

[43:59] world and that's the other thing too I just get it it's just it's weird to me that people want to

[44:03] get credit before they deserve credit like you haven't remade it like you didn't even finish your

[44:08] first project and now you're on to the second one and it seems like it's taking forever and maybe

[44:14] it's just a side passion project that's fine but then why why not do it unless you know how to do it

[44:20] and within a timely manner all right speaking of timely manner let's close out with these guys because

[44:28] deep root Pimbal and you know I don't know if I want to talk about this because in a couple

[44:34] weeks we're gonna see exactly what deep root has been working on and here's a thing here's a thing

[44:42] I I heard some mumblings from people at Expo it seems like some people either in the deep

[44:47] root camp or outside the deep root camp have like loose lips and we're sort of saying how like they

[44:53] think some of what's going on over there is like in shambles and they can't get white woods together

[44:58] and there's been some complaining that I've been hearing but I don't want to report on like I

[45:03] don't you know I don't know I just want to see what they deliver and I'll say this it is not a good

[45:11] sign that the first time we see a deep root Pimbal machine it's not going to be a fully

[45:17] completed machine and I think that is a humongous red flag and I'll explain why is that Robert

[45:23] is a smart guy he knows this industry he knows exactly how to create hype how to get people excited

[45:32] about a game and he also knows the right way to reveal a game to the world nobody in their right

[45:39] mind in today's climate would ever reveal a machine that's half done with incomplete artwork

[45:48] that's not the fall package all that's ever done is is is destroyed the ability to create the hype

[45:55] when a game comes out and so the fact that we're not going to get a totally finished raza in November

[46:05] to me looks like a red flag it would it would make me concerned that they still don't have this

[46:10] figured out and there's and the end the finish line for them keeps pushing further and further out

[46:17] right now it's like some time in 2020 between like spring and summer we might see the first game

[46:24] and at what point do you take a company that said we would see more games than Pimbal has ever seen

[46:29] in 2019 it's like you know and they're like well we didn't exactly hit our target it didn't

[46:34] it didn't exactly you didn't do anything we didn't see anything and so I think they might be swirling

[46:42] with by trying to bite off too much and and I've said this before I think the biggest mistake people

[46:47] make when they try to get into Pimbal is they try to either do too much or they don't do enough

[46:54] and what you really need to do if I were to like look at all these Pimbal companies I would just make

[46:59] and I know Robert's a fan of the Valley Williams eros of games like just make a great game based

[47:05] on a great theme with some magic in it I mean is it that hard is it really that hard get a good

[47:11] theme get a good design have some fun toys in the game and have a checklist like does it look great

[47:19] is it a theme people want does the ball do two or three magical things they're going to make people

[47:24] say wow did you see that like is it does it have enough depth to own this game is it easy enough

[47:30] for casual people to walk up and enjoy it right now I heard like one of the smartest things I've

[47:36] heard any podcasters say on the slap safe Pimbal podcast they were talking about how with Jersey

[47:41] Jack games they're just not approachable you know they make these games and you need like a manual

[47:47] to understand like how to play the game and that to me that's not Pimbal right you know Pimbal

[47:53] should be like immediately fun it doesn't it it also it can also be deep but it can be fun like when

[47:58] you make a game that requires so much knowledge of how to play it you're making like a role playing

[48:03] game now but ask yourself a question how often do you go into an arcade and see a role playing game

[48:09] there like you don't play Final Fantasy 7 when you go out on location and to me that's the whole

[48:14] issue with like some of the Jersey Jack approaches it's like you want to make a game for location

[48:19] then you make it super deep like a role playing game and those two things don't go together yet

[48:24] you gotta go one way or the other and then if you make it really deep and really difficult

[48:29] then I want long ball times because I need long ball times to see deep into the game and you can't

[48:34] make it a drain monster right it's just super it's just to me the stuff seems common senseical

[48:39] but you know in the world of Pimbal I'm at least surprised when I wake up every day how some

[48:43] decisions are made that just seem to be like contradictory to what the consumer wants or what the

[48:49] marketplace is in the Pimbal world so lots of pressure on deep route though with all these games

[48:54] coming out I mean people have limited space people are gonna be expecting a lot and and here's

[49:00] why they'll be expecting a lot because they ran their mouths a lot they said a lot when Steve

[49:05] Bowden's like just wait right they were up there all smug talking about it and they need to deliver

[49:11] so we'll see again we have just a couple weeks before we'll see what happens at the Houston Arcade

[49:17] all right anything else going on in Pimbal I think that's pretty much it I want to just end

[49:22] this show with a few of my reflection points okay and you know I've been sort of thinking a lot

[49:30] about this hobby when I took like a couple weeks off and you know it's it gives you perspective

[49:36] and I did I did update my Facebook page I did look at Pinside every now and then when I was

[49:41] traveling you know and I'll say this we are all part of a very very small hobby we are this

[49:48] is this hobby is a hobby within a hobby right if you the bigger hobby is like arcade collecting

[49:55] and arcade games sold way more than Pimbal machines like we're the subset of the arcade culture

[50:01] the Pimbal machines were never the most popular machines inside the arcade you know they are

[50:06] arcade environment back in the day and and we're very small and I think sometimes when you spend

[50:10] all day long on a Pimbal forum or you make Pimbal the center of your universe you start to think

[50:15] that Pimbal is bigger than it is and it's not and then when I see people with the desire to expand

[50:22] the Pimbal right we need to expand Pimbal we need to get more people into Pimbal I think it's

[50:26] pretty futile I think there's already enough people in Pimbal to keep a lot of these manufacturers

[50:32] afloat for now I think space is the number one issue that is going to affect people more than

[50:37] money it's going to be space there's just nowhere to put new games for most people the younger

[50:43] generation just does not care I don't care if your kids are into it because you have it remember

[50:47] you're probably the only house in the county that has Pimbal machines in it the majority of

[50:52] kids who are growing up playing cell phone games playing immediately exciting games for pennies

[51:00] are never going to get into a sport like Pimbal that costs so much money to buy one the access to them

[51:09] is is not there and and it's not the most social game it's not think about it like the social

[51:16] elements of when you play Pimbal is when you get your buddies over your drinking beers and you're

[51:21] hanging out and then you're playing Pimbal well kids are not hanging out drinking like you know

[51:28] all the social elements are not there like they're more addicted to things that have to do with

[51:33] like social media connectivity and online gaming and whatnot it's silly to even like argue that

[51:38] Pimbal is going to be shepherded into the next generation and then on and then on it's not and

[51:45] that's okay because I still think so many of us have many many more years to go and Pimbal will

[51:50] still be around for many many more years and I don't want to put a prediction on you know when

[51:56] it's going to die or when the collapse is going to happen of the market because nobody knows I

[52:00] don't know you don't know who knows where the world's going to be like in the next three to five to

[52:05] 10 years nobody does okay but I will say this if you spend more money on Pimbal and invest more

[52:12] time in Pimbal then you do with your friends and your family and your health that I think you're

[52:20] you're investing too much in it and you know just coming out of a trip that probably cost me at

[52:26] the end of the day as much as a collector's edition machine I wouldn't have traded that for the

[52:31] world and when you do spend money in other areas on experiences that will last you a lifetime you

[52:38] do start to realize a little bit maybe a lot of it the ridiculousness of how expensive Pimbal has

[52:46] now become for the amount of entertainment it does provide okay these games aren't very very

[52:53] expensive now and with the high prices should come the high expectations from us the consumers and

[53:00] from us the buyers and I think if there's one thing that's disappointing to me as I look at this

[53:04] hobby I mean you're like one thing Chris you get disappointed a lot of things I think the one thing

[53:10] is for the prices of these games I do find there to be way too much like overall

[53:16] universal cheerleading too much of like this everything is awesome response to these games that

[53:22] are that are being priced at such a high price point and I think more and more of us should speak

[53:29] up and demand more from these manufacturers if they're going to charge this much money for games

[53:36] like a stern Pimbal machine for $9,000 should come with a topper like it just should right it should

[53:42] come with more in it maybe it shouldn't be $9,000 if you know what it costs to make the game okay but

[53:49] you know it's it's really hard it's really hard because everything always gets defended as well

[53:56] if it's fun and if I want it who cares and it's hard for me to argue against that it's a very

[54:02] emotional item for people to buy it's a non-essential item okay but you know when I go around the

[54:09] world and I met and I met someone man like I'm in golden guys I think that's the area of

[54:18] Shinjuku where it's like all these bars and like a dude come up to me and says hey are you

[54:21] Canada and it's this guy Mike he's awesome he listens to the show I'm like I'm all the way around

[54:26] the world and I run to someone who listens to the show and you know and that's why I love this hobby

[54:32] is is it connects people and it's it has an amazing ability to connect people um you know but

[54:39] but there's a big but you know I think that too much too much too much of our time can be spent

[54:46] in in this hobby like dissecting so much of it and ultimately I think the majority of the new

[54:54] games aren't wowing you the way you want them to wow you for the amount of money they are and

[55:01] I think that's a fair assessment I think that's why we get a lot of people listening to this show

[55:06] is I think we look at it through that lens of like well for 10 grand shouldn't this just blow me

[55:10] away at this stage I mean why were games that were $3,000 packed with twice as much stuff and we

[55:17] shouldn't stop asking those questions of why we're not seeing more you know Stern Pimball has

[55:22] done something ingenious they've found a way to lower the price of the game like lower the

[55:28] manufacturing cost of the game while charging three times as much as they used to on the games

[55:35] all while you still are buying it right they don't lost consumers they've gained consumers

[55:43] they continue to test to see how far they can push and a virus selling out in one day for $15,000

[55:51] you know what that tells them they haven't even scratched the surface of how far they can push us

[55:58] and so we'll continue to cover those kinds of moves in the Pimball hobby you know when I start

[56:03] this podcast I'm being away for it for two weeks and I've listened to a lot of other Pimball

[56:07] podcasts that are out there you know some of them I love some of them I you know bore me I'll be

[56:11] honest some of them are great some of them are not great but they are they're all attempting to give

[56:16] their opinions about Pimball and that's cool like I I I love that people have the desire and the

[56:23] passion to pick up a mic and tell us you know their thoughts on Pimball we can't all be the same way

[56:28] we can some people are animated some people are not some people want to talk about breakfast some

[56:31] people don't some people want to say everything is awesome bye bye bye some people don't some people

[56:35] distribute games for a living some people like fix games for a living some people just critique games

[56:41] for a living we're all different we're all different and I think the differences of opinions are what

[56:46] make it exciting right but you know for me I always want to have a podcast that my goal was always

[56:52] just to be relevant like we will talk about what's relevant going on right now and this podcast has

[56:57] always been a podcast about the pot it's been a podcast about the Pimball conversation like I just

[57:03] want to capture what people are talking about and I want to try and articulate what I think is on

[57:08] people's minds okay but again I implore you I implore you if you're thinking about buying these

[57:15] 10,000 dollar games and you're thinking about spending 12,500 I don't know maybe ask yourself should I

[57:22] take my family on an epic vacation instead should I do something more with this money should I

[57:27] join a gym should I get in shape I mean look at charities lost 70 pounds God bless them that's been

[57:33] more transformative in his life than buying Pimball machines you know because ultimately ultimately

[57:39] let me just leave you guys with one question you know what's the resale value on your life

[57:44] keep looking at these games like investments and this and that just just focus

[57:50] on making your life balance with the right things and I do think that having hobbies like Pimball

[57:56] is important to a happy life I do I never I never in a million years would recommend you leave

[58:03] this hobby and you leave Pimball like it's so much fun to see what's around the corner it's so much

[58:09] fun to hang out dudes in this hobby it's so much fun to connect and geek out over something like a

[58:15] Pimball machine I do I think it's amazing I love this hobby so much I think there's so much good

[58:20] stuff to come I think you can put a better signature plate on your game Jersey Jack I think you can

[58:26] make your games less confusing I think Stern Pimball could put more into their games for the amount of

[58:32] money they're charging us I think American Pimball the door is wide open for these guys to deliver a

[58:37] hit title they know enough by now to get it right I think deep brew Pimball is in a deep hole in

[58:43] terms of people's expectations for them you know I think Chicago gaming company I've heard their next

[58:49] title which we know is probably cactus Canyon I heard the treatment on that is phenomenal it's

[58:54] gonna blow everyone away I think they're in the driver's seat because they're just remastering the

[58:58] hits I think they're probably Stern's biggest competitor next to Jersey Jack Pimball and I think

[59:03] there's so much out there all that I want though is for these games to bring more magic they need

[59:11] to bring more magic and think about Pimball a little bit differently I think it's all too much

[59:15] the same and that's why I think guys like Keith L win have such a big following because they don't

[59:19] cookie cut it all right everyone I'm glad to be back I'm a little a lot jet lagged I hope you

[59:25] did enjoy this episode 412 everyone love you episode 412 canate is back look forward to more shows
