[00:00] I wanna know what love is.

[00:06] I want you to show me.

[00:14] Oh, welcome to part two of like, Canada's Jaws Week Spectacular!

[00:18] How's everybody doing?

[00:19] So we got more information of Jaws Pinball.

[00:22] We saw a longer video with George Gomez and Keith Elwyn.

[00:26] We saw more of the features of the game.

[00:29] We heard a lot of conversation on Pinsight around this game.

[00:33] I reached out to Cointaker.

[00:34] They're sold out, automated, sold out.

[00:37] So it seems that all of the moaning and groaning around Stern prices and LEs

[00:43] aren't really falling on receptive ears.

[00:45] I think they sold out of Jaws Pinball now.

[00:48] Remember, most of these are sold through.

[00:51] There are still gonna be distributors that have this game.

[00:54] But once again, as I predicted a day one sell out of Jaws Pinball,

[00:59] and were you really surprised it's Keith Elwyn, it's Jaws, it's an iconic theme.

[01:05] And even though stuff looks pretty cheap in a lot of the sculpts,

[01:08] and even though, you know, they don't have Brody in the game,

[01:12] there's enough here to like to pull the trigger on a game right now.

[01:18] And I think the climate for this game, remember, right?

[01:21] Over the last couple of years, there really hasn't been a game that's blown people away.

[01:26] And I think people have been waiting for this game for a while.

[01:30] And I think you can look at this game either way you want to look at it.

[01:33] I think you can look at this game and make fun of it.

[01:36] I think you can make fun of how cheap a lot of the stuff looks in a Stern machine.

[01:40] You can make fun of how outdated the lighting system is.

[01:44] You can make fun of the Chum Bucket.

[01:46] You can make fun of this and that.

[01:48] Like it's still just a Stern machine.

[01:50] And then you can look at this game and say, hey, it looks like it's fun.

[01:53] It looks like the shots are going to be there.

[01:56] It looks like there's enough variety in the shots.

[01:58] They got Richard Dreyfus to do the official callouts of the game.

[02:02] And you've got official movie clips from four Jaws films.

[02:06] You've got a 3D video mode of the game.

[02:09] You've got foiled artwork that's going to simulate being underwater.

[02:14] You know, you've got stuff to appreciate.

[02:16] And I think that's really what defines a new pinball reveal,

[02:20] especially one from Stern.

[02:21] I mean, Stern's always going to get a lot of opinions from a lot of people.

[02:26] So I think each and every one of us, we walk to these games and we bring ourselves

[02:31] to the analysis of the game.

[02:34] For some of you, this game isn't worth anywhere near $13,000 for an LE.

[02:40] For some of you, you bought it today.

[02:42] I know a lot of you bought this game today and that's fine.

[02:45] For some of you, you think the pro is good enough.

[02:48] For some of you, you think the pro is a total joke with the shark just sitting there.

[02:53] I mean, think about it for a minute, though.

[02:55] Jaws is all about the shark making an appearance.

[02:59] And if the shark is just always there, doesn't that ruin the dramatic effect

[03:04] of what the entire franchise is about?

[03:07] I think it looks absolutely comical.

[03:09] I don't think I could ever actually, with a straight face, own a pro version of this machine

[03:15] because of how silly it looks that a shark is floating in midair inside a shark cage,

[03:22] floating like a few inches above the play field.

[03:24] It looks absolutely ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:28] It's interesting, too, that there's no lower play field in this game whatsoever.

[03:33] There's no translucent area of the play field in which you're looking through.

[03:37] I mean, in James Bond, they've got more real estate about something happening underwater

[03:43] than they do in Jaws' pinball.

[03:45] Really strange decision there, if you ask me.

[03:48] But now that I've seen all three versions, I get what Stern's going for.

[03:52] You notice how, like, the pro and the le have the translate everybody wants?

[03:58] I don't really like the premium translate.

[04:01] The premium artwork on the side is nice, and now we know who the artist is.

[04:05] It is the same artist who did the art for Rush pinball.

[04:09] This looks a lot better than the art in Rush.

[04:12] I think he used a different technique here.

[04:14] In Rush, it looks like he hand drew them from nothing.

[04:17] On this one, doesn't it look like he took photographs of these actors

[04:22] and then airbrushed over them, a la franchise sort of style of art?

[04:26] It looks more like that.

[04:28] So let's do this real quick.

[04:29] Let me read you the press release from Stern Pinball about Jaws' pinball.

[04:33] Stern Pinball announces their newest pinball games featuring Jaws,

[04:37] one of the most iconic motion picture thrillers of all time

[04:41] from Universal Pictures and Amblym Entertainment.

[04:44] Players will experience all four blockbuster Jaws films like never before

[04:48] with brand new mechanical features inspired by iconic movie moments

[04:53] and state of the art technology.

[04:56] All right, let me just stop right there.

[04:57] What in Jaws pinball?

[04:58] Think about this for a minute.

[05:00] What inside of Jaws pinball by Stern is state of the art technology?

[05:06] I would really love for them to explain to us

[05:09] where the state of the art technology is.

[05:12] Jaws pinball games are available in pro, premium and limited edition models.

[05:18] Jaws transports players to the fictional locale of Amity Island

[05:22] located off the coast of Long Island, New York.

[05:26] If you go to the George Gomez and Keith Elwin video,

[05:28] I believe Keith Elwin says New England and not New York.

[05:32] Kind of funny.

[05:33] It's a sunny day in New England.

[05:35] It's a sunny day in New England.

[05:37] It's a sunny day in New England.

[05:39] What the hell?

[05:40] It's making me laugh all day.

[05:45] He keeps asking.

[05:49] He keeps asking.

[05:51] The small fishing community is a popular beach vacation location in the summer.

[05:57] I don't know if I would use vacation and location right next to each other.

[06:01] As 4th of July vacationers close in on the island's picturesque beaches,

[06:06] grave danger lurks below sea level.

[06:09] The Amity Island mayor covers up the shark attacks out of fear of losing the island's tourism money

[06:15] resulting in more terrifying attacks.

[06:17] Now we get into the pinball machine.

[06:19] Stern's Jaws pinball games will have players grabbing their harpoons

[06:23] and playing as Quint, Hooper and Brody to save Amity Island's residents

[06:28] and the 4th of July.

[06:30] In the Stern video itself, he said you're just playing as Quint.

[06:34] So I'm a little bit confused.

[06:36] Is it all 3 of them or is it just Quint?

[06:38] You're Quint the bounty hunter.

[06:40] You're Quint the bounty hunter.

[06:41] You're Quint the bounty hunter.

[06:43] As the grizzled fishermen tackle the most dangerous ocean creatures on the planet,

[06:49] tension mounts as you see blood in the water from our animated lighting effects.

[06:54] Fire pinballs at the motorized shark fin targets swimming across the play field,

[06:59] anticipation builds as you navigate the orca boat upper play field

[07:04] featuring a lookout tower ramp, a ship's wheel horizontal spinner on the deck

[07:09] and a radio stand up target to call for help.

[07:12] Look out!

[07:13] A motorized custom sculpted great white shark bash toy comes crashing through the bottom of a fishing boat

[07:19] terrorizing players in this thrilling pinball odyssey.

[07:24] Will you survive Jaws?

[07:26] Oh my gosh, I'm reading it with as much hyperbole that is in the written word here by Stern Pinball.

[07:31] Now ladies and gentlemen, we've seen the footage of this game.

[07:34] Do you think this game is going to be terrorizing anybody?

[07:38] Shoot again!

[07:39] The only thing this game is going to be terrorizing is our wallets

[07:43] when we all have to spend so much money to upgrade all of the flat plastic in this game

[07:48] to make the game look like a world under glass from Amity Island.

[07:52] I mean seriously, terrorizing players.

[07:54] In addition to immersive film and audio assets integrated into pinball action,

[07:59] Jaws includes custom speech by actor Richard Dreyfus and the iconic movie theme by John Williams.

[08:05] I love this quote, get ready for it.

[08:07] Honoring one of the greatest movie franchises of all time,

[08:10] we're giving Jaws our most advanced software and hardware to date, said Seth Davis,

[08:16] president and CEO of Stern Pinball.

[08:19] We can't wait to debut Jaws Pinball's heart pounding gameplay to the world.

[08:24] Heart pounding, okay, heart pounding.

[08:26] And again, like looking at Jaws Pinball and looking over Stern's games over the last few years,

[08:31] this is the most advanced hardware to date in a Stern machine.

[08:36] Where is the advanced hardware?

[08:38] Where is the state-of-the-art technology?

[08:40] Are QR codes state-of-the-art technology?

[08:44] They go on to talk about Inside or Connected,

[08:46] then they talk about the hand-drawn artwork by Michael Barnard,

[08:50] exclusive custom great white powder coat pinball armor.

[08:54] The fact that we're calling the color white exclusive and custom is so funny.

[08:59] It's got expression lighting in the speakers only with Jaws theme, game effects,

[09:04] sonar, water, blood in the water and more,

[09:07] a custom designed autographed button arc.

[09:11] Maybe that's the state-of-the-art, a custom designer autographed button arc,

[09:15] exclusive Inside art blades, upgraded audio system, anti-reflection pinball playfield glass,

[09:21] shaker motor and sequentially numbered plaque,

[09:25] and a certificate of authenticity signed by Stern president and CEO Seth Davis

[09:31] and chairman and founder Gary Stern.

[09:33] Keith Elwin doesn't even sign this game? What?

[09:36] There we have it, ladies and gentlemen, the most state-of-the-art from Stern Pinball.

[09:40] The press releases are funny. That's why I like reading this stuff.

[09:43] I don't even know why they bother with these press releases because you don't need to read a press release.

[09:47] You need to just look at the game.

[09:49] And after looking over the game again, looking at all three packages of the game,

[09:53] I think this game is going to do just fine. It's like I said earlier,

[09:57] I think this game is going to net out somewhere around like the Jurassic Park level of response.

[10:03] And I think when you play this game and looking at the modes in the game,

[10:07] it's going to be interesting because the one question mark I still have,

[10:11] how exciting will the replay value on this game be?

[10:15] Like what are you actually doing in the game?

[10:18] And when you look at the inserts, you're capturing different kinds of sharks.

[10:22] There's like a tiger head, there's a hammerhead, there's a great white, there's a mako shark.

[10:28] And so like, is that the point of the game is like you're hunting not just jaws,

[10:33] but you're also going after other sharks in the ocean in search of jaws,

[10:38] which is kind of like the storyline from the movie.

[10:41] And I guess the question is, is just how exciting will that be?

[10:44] Will there be a ton of replay value?

[10:47] Will it capture your imagination like other stern machines that you love?

[10:52] And we don't know yet, right?

[10:53] Will the code in this be as good as the code in Godzilla?

[10:56] And I think what's going to make this game interesting is they do have a lot of movie assets

[11:01] they're going to put into this.

[11:02] And hopefully when this game comes out, like over the next week or so,

[11:06] this game is going to be pretty far along.

[11:08] I hope it's not going to be a James Bond scenario where you're still waiting for most of the stuff

[11:13] to be incorporated into the game.

[11:15] I don't think that's going to be the case.

[11:17] I think they've been working on this game for a while.

[11:19] And I think when it does come out, it's going to be around like code 0.88 or something like that.

[11:24] So the Ellie's are sold out and there's no rush to get a premium or pro.

[11:29] They're going to build the pros and Ellie's first.

[11:31] They're going to want to get all that money in house.

[11:34] And look, you know, I'm looking down at the game again.

[11:37] I'm looking at the Ellie. I'm looking at the pro.

[11:39] I will say this, my overall assessment after watching all of the videos,

[11:43] after hearing all of the feedback, after hearing all of the debate back and forth,

[11:48] I just feel like this game is a good game.

[11:51] I feel like it's not the greatest thing we've ever seen.

[11:54] I don't see anything happening mechanically.

[11:56] That's really like a wow moment.

[11:58] There's nothing in the lighting or the artwork or in the atmospheric effect of the game that's making me go,

[12:04] Oh my gosh, did you see that?

[12:06] There's nothing that's really state of the art.

[12:08] There's nothing that seems that innovative.

[12:11] There's nothing that seems that advanced.

[12:13] It feels like another Keith Alwyn game, which is a really good thing.

[12:17] He is arguably the best designer right now,

[12:20] but nothing in this game really feels like they took a chance.

[12:24] Like they took a risk.

[12:25] Like they had to burn the midnight oil to figure out how to make that work.

[12:29] Everything in it seems a little pedestrian.

[12:32] And that's just my take on this game.

[12:34] And that's why it's a hard pill to swallow when you look at how much money, you know, the Ellie is.

[12:40] The fact that the Ellie sold out on day one,

[12:42] does that mean the Ellie's are going to go up in value over $13,000?

[12:47] Have any of you out there been shut out from getting an Ellie and you really want it won?

[12:52] I think with a thousand out there, think about it like this for a moment, people.

[12:56] A really good selling Pimmel machine is like 4,000 units, right?

[13:00] If it's a great machine, it's selling like 5,000 to 6,000 units.

[13:04] So let's just say they sell 4,000 Jaws Pimball machines.

[13:08] That's a lot.

[13:09] Like that's a lot of money.

[13:10] That's a lot of machines to make 4,000 of them.

[13:14] You don't think about that in the context of like spooky Pimball needs a year and a half to make 1,900 games.

[13:20] 4,000 Jaws Pimball machines are sold.

[13:23] A quarter of those are going to be Ellie machines.

[13:26] So one out of every four person who owns one after they make 4,000 is going to own a limited edition version of the game.

[13:34] So I don't think they're going to be hard to get.

[13:37] And maybe the biggest news of the day wasn't even the Jaws news because we've already seen the video on Jaws for like 48 hours.

[13:45] The biggest news of the day, during the distributor calls, Seth Davis confirmed,

[13:52] they are no longer going to remake limited edition versions of older games.

[13:58] Now this is huge news.

[14:00] And it's clear that Seth Davis has heard a lot of the moaning and groaning and realizes if he kills the collector side of Pimball,

[14:08] he's going to kill his own business.

[14:10] So there will never be more reruns of games that had limited edition versions out in the world.

[14:18] But I still have a question.

[14:20] Is an anniversary edition a limited edition game?

[14:24] He said they're never going to rerun Ellie's of games.

[14:27] And what I think he means by that is they're not going to make another run of like Star Wars Ellie.

[14:34] But does that mean they're not going to make a Star Wars anniversary edition?

[14:39] They're not going to make another Batman SLE.

[14:41] I'm thankful for that.

[14:43] Does that mean they're not going to make a 60th anniversary edition of Batman and just call it something else?

[14:49] I think we need another level of clarity on what he means by that.

[14:54] If Godzilla's 70th anniversary comes out this year, that's technically not a rerun of the Ellie of Godzilla.

[15:02] It's a whole new edition.

[15:04] Remember, they made a limited edition version of Elvira.

[15:08] The Blood Kiss edition is not a rerun of that Ellie.

[15:13] It's a completely different art package.

[15:15] So even though I would love to celebrate this news, I still don't trust Stern Pinball is not going to pull a fast one on us.

[15:23] They've had such a history of pulling a fast one on the Pinball community.

[15:28] And the other huge news that came out of today, did you see this?

[15:32] He also said we are looking at rerunning DMD games.

[15:36] DMD games in pro and premium format, we are looking at making more of them.

[15:41] And you know what themes they must be.

[15:43] It's got to be Ghostbusters.

[15:45] It's probably Kiss.

[15:47] Isn't Kiss a DMD game?

[15:49] All of those Spike 1 DMD games, I think are fair game to come back.

[15:54] And I wonder if Metallica is going to come back as a DMD and not as an LCD game.

[16:00] But imagine if they go back and make more Lord of the Rings and more Trons.

[16:05] And I think Stern is going to really just start to flood the market with everything they've got.

[16:11] This big factory people, I mean it is ginormous.

[16:14] They could have one wing of the factory making LCD games.

[16:18] They could have another whole division with like tens of thousands of square feet making older DMD games.

[16:24] I mean they could actually fit two to three of Stern's old factory inside this new one.

[16:29] And I think they're just going to keep cranking and cranking stuff out.

[16:33] That was very big news today that started out the day.

[16:36] So here we are.

[16:38] The week is almost over.

[16:40] What I would love to see is just someone play this game.

[16:43] I still don't like the fact that they don't play the game for you.

[16:47] Like nobody walks up and does a like 30 minute stream of just playing Jaws

[16:53] so you can see what the game is like before you have to write a check for $13,000.

[16:59] I mean we're still at that point.

[17:01] But I think a lot of you out there are getting wiser.

[17:04] And a lot of you out there are also not falling for the LE FOMO.

[17:08] And you can take your time.

[17:10] You can play this game when you get a chance to play it.

[17:13] It's going to be on location real soon.

[17:16] It's going to be in Vegas at CES next week like on Tuesday.

[17:21] And I think it might be a little bit disappointing.

[17:23] I hope we get a gameplay from Stern or Jack Danger or Keith Elwin before then.

[17:28] I would hate the world premiere of real gameplay to be over the shoulder footage from CES.

[17:35] I think that's the worst way to show the game for the first time.

[17:38] So we're almost at the end of Shark Week.

[17:41] Did Jaws exceed your expectations?

[17:44] Did it not meet your expectations?

[17:46] Or did it just fall in line with your expectations?

[17:49] It definitely did not exceed my expectations.

[17:53] There's nothing in it that's really blowing me away.

[17:55] But there's nothing in it that really upsets me.

[17:58] It feels like a middle of the road par for the course Stern machine.

[18:02] It doesn't feel like something that took Godzilla and turns it up a notch.

[18:07] And maybe it's the pedestrian artwork.

[18:09] Maybe it's the lack of interesting sculpts.

[18:12] Maybe it's the fact that nothing mechanically we haven't seen before.

[18:16] There's not much not to like, but there's not much to love.

[18:20] It just feels like, okay, we've seen this another Stern.

[18:25] It's a great IP.

[18:27] It's a great designer.

[18:29] And everything else is sort of halfway there.

[18:31] That's my feeling on Jaws.

[18:33] I don't think this game is going to create that seismic shift I thought would happen as we started 2024.

[18:41] I think Elwin's a little bit vulnerable with this game.

[18:43] I got to be honest.

[18:45] I think the door is open for Jersey Jack.

[18:48] The door is open now for Dutch pinball.

[18:51] The door is open for some other pinball company to wow us more than this game.

[18:57] I don't think this game is going to end the year as being the game of the year.

[19:02] I really don't.

[19:03] We shall see what happens.

[19:04] You know, and such a shame that all Jersey Jacks got right now to compete with this is Elton John.

[19:10] I mean, if I was Jersey Jack, there would be no better time to announce your remaking Pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:18] Then right now, like you think that's a boat?

[19:21] This is a boat.

[19:22] We're happy to announce everybody that we're bringing Pirates of the Caribbean back for a limited run and get your orders in today.

[19:30] I mean, what better time to do it than this plastic orca that doesn't really do much?

[19:35] Everybody, two shows in one day.

[19:37] You can't deny the fact.

[19:38] I'm going to get your content.

[19:40] I'm going to get your content.

[19:41] Everybody, have a good night.

[19:42] We'll talk to you probably tomorrow.

[19:44] Later.

[19:49] And I know, and I know, I know you can't show me.

[19:55] Show me back to me.

[19:57] Yeah!

[19:59] I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
