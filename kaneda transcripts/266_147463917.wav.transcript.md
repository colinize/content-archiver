[00:00] Today I went online, apparently a lot of people don't like me, there's no cell phones in rehab, and that's where I'm going so come find me.

[00:09] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:30] Long.

[00:31] The topic of this show, I'm not gonna mince words anymore.

[00:36] I am gonna say something on this show that is my belief.

[00:40] My opinion from what I've gathered from people I've spoken to over the last few months.

[00:48] It's also, I'm coming to this conclusion by things that have happened to me by said personnel over at said organization.

[00:59] I'm also gathering the reality of End of the Year Pinball Awards show and the world's biggest

[01:08] pinball company with the most people got zero awards.

[01:14] And I had someone on Facebook being like,

[01:16] Canada now hates Stern.

[01:19] And I was like, I don't hate Stern, but tell me which award you would have given to Stern.

[01:26] And there was no reply.

[01:28] And I just want to say this makes me sad because what has happened to Stern pinball

[01:35] isn't an isolated thing at Stern.

[01:39] It is what is happening all over the world.

[01:44] Companies are losing their identity.

[01:47] They are losing their culture and they are losing their creativity in the name of one thing.

[01:57] In the name of growth.

[02:00] For us to grow, we have to become bigger.

[02:04] We have to become more than what we were to the people that made us who we are.

[02:12] You know, now that they're no longer a client of mine, I can talk openly about Jameson.

[02:18] When I worked on Jameson, the world's number one Irish whiskey.

[02:24] The reason the world loves Jameson Irish whiskey is because it's from Ireland and it

[02:33] represents the people of the Irish Republic that people relate to.

[02:40] They export joy to the world.

[02:42] They export music, singing, dancing, the crack as they would say.

[02:48] Not crack like drugs.

[02:50] Okay, it's spelled differently.

[02:52] And so you have this brand that got really big and there's a reason why because the world

[02:57] loved it for what it was and it grew organically without any sort of like ad campaign that was

[03:05] trying to create sizzle and sex.

[03:07] And in the end, by the time I had been done working on them, every time I would bring an idea that

[03:14] was rooted in Irish culture, they wanted nothing to do with it.

[03:20] They thought to grow.

[03:22] We have to make the world's number one Irish whiskey more appealing to other cultures that

[03:29] might not even like whiskey.

[03:31] And what that does is it destroys who you are.

[03:35] It destroys the very fiber of your culture.

[03:39] And I'm saying what's happened at Stern Pinball and it's so obvious.

[03:44] They have brought in outside people and did those outside people, did they become a member

[03:53] of the community?

[03:54] Did they listen and hear from us?

[03:57] Did they listen for the first few years to operators and collectors and this?

[04:03] No.

[04:04] And now what we're seeing now in 2026 is the impact of bringing in outside

[04:13] individuals who don't really know pinball and they didn't have a vision for pinball when they

[04:19] went and got their MBAs, when they went and worked over here, maybe it was Disney, maybe it was the

[04:26] WWE.

[04:27] This is a really, really unique and special industry.

[04:32] It's a really, really unique and special product.

[04:36] And in my entire journey through pinball, I have realized watching all of these companies

[04:43] some have succeeded, some have failed, but it all comes down to one thing.

[04:47] The companies with the greatest culture will be the companies that people are excited to wake

[04:54] up every day, go through the door and create magic.

[05:00] If the company is obsessed with growth and finding new customers despite their existing

[05:07] customers or making marketing moves that absolutely cannibalize their own market,

[05:15] not only that, but also crap on the very people that got your company to where it's at.

[05:22] You know, when you keep remaking things, you said you'd never remake when you raise the prices and

[05:27] you strip out the features.

[05:29] When you start making your cabinets look like Ikea pieces of furniture, it gets to a point where

[05:34] there's only so many times you can tell your buyers your significant volume of owners.

[05:43] There's only so many times they're going to forgive you and there's only so many times

[05:46] you're going to test their patience.

[05:49] And so here we are.

[05:51] It is the beginning of a new year and I look at so many of these pinball companies with optimism,

[05:57] with energy and they have momentum.

[06:00] And then I'm hearing from people that I know are intimately, intimately connected

[06:07] at Stern Pinball and it makes me sad because I've been through this in my own career and I

[06:14] know what happens when this happens.

[06:16] When you get the executives barking at everybody, how come sales aren't where they're at?

[06:22] Do you think Seth and George are seeing eye to eye on the vision of this company?

[06:29] Have you even seen in almost a year the chief marketing officer over at Stern?

[06:38] Have you heard from him once?

[06:42] To me that says everything.

[06:43] The CMO should be out there.

[06:45] He should be out there out and about.

[06:47] No, you haven't.

[06:48] What we've witnessed is people who love this hobby so much getting burnt out by the culture

[06:56] over there.

[06:58] It's a point now.

[06:59] It's kind of like it's their house.

[07:01] They work in Chicago.

[07:02] They've got that big building and it's like think about your own family.

[07:06] Sometimes it's easy to keep the turmoil hidden from everybody else because in your family,

[07:13] you're not making a product, but look, if your family dynamic and your family culture

[07:18] is negative and toxic, you know who's going to notice it?

[07:22] The teachers when your kids go to school or your coworkers when you go into work.

[07:27] We're going to notice the change in the individual.

[07:31] Have you seen a change in George Gomez doing all these damage control tours?

[07:37] Does he look like he's having a good time answering silly questions all the time because

[07:42] he's got to defend the poor sales of these games and then hide behind licensure issues?

[07:48] Wow, none of those issues at JJP.

[07:51] None of those issues at Spooky Pimbo, but all of a sudden, oh, licensure approval.

[07:56] Okay, sure.

[07:56] But where's the great game?

[07:58] Where's the magic?

[07:59] Where's the mechs?

[08:00] Where's all the stuff?

[08:01] Where's the stuff that's worth $13,000?

[08:04] Where's the topper?

[08:05] How come the topper looks like that?

[08:07] Nobody had any common sense.

[08:08] You put C3PO to capitate it in front of who knows what is happening behind him.

[08:13] And you're supposed to say that you're creative and everyone's inspired.

[08:18] And that looks like an inspiring creative item.

[08:21] No, we're at this point now where we've taken people that have absolutely loved this hobby,

[08:28] like Zambietti.

[08:30] We've taken people like Jack Danger.

[08:32] We've seen people leaving Stern Pimbo, going other places, like Tom Capara goes over to JJP.

[08:39] These are huge losses.

[08:41] And these were the people that built Stern and made Stern great and made us love Stern Pimbo.

[08:46] It's like, how many times can we now ignore the fact

[08:51] that they're not able to keep this turmoil inside their own house?

[08:56] That people inside that house are now dying for a little help because they're not going to get it

[09:04] unless people know and you could sense it and you could feel it.

[09:09] And I'm here to tell you right now that I've heard now from a variety of people

[09:15] that Pokemon Pimbo will be the ultimate.

[09:19] And I mean this, the ultimate disappointment in what Stern Pimbo has become.

[09:27] Star Wars was a humongous disappointment.

[09:30] One of the biggest, greatest IPs of all time.

[09:34] And they butchered it.

[09:36] And now what you're going to get in Pokemon, which is the biggest IP in the entire world by a lot.

[09:45] And so you have Stern Pimbo with the biggest IP in the history of Pimbo.

[09:51] And did they design this game as an organization and collaborate as an organization?

[09:58] You would think it would be all hands on deck to make this game.

[10:02] But no, what this company has turned into is the toxic culture that was

[10:08] Bally Williams back in the day where teams were isolated from each other.

[10:14] Where internal politics is what drove the sort of development of each title.

[10:21] Where it wasn't about as a company coming together to make the best possible game we can make.

[10:27] How do we make the best possible Pokemon game ever?

[10:31] Keith, Elwyn, you love Pokemon, you're in it.

[10:34] Jack, you got some great ideas.

[10:35] Jack Dane, you're awesome.

[10:37] Let's get everybody in a room and make this the greatest game ever.

[10:42] And put all of our resources into it.

[10:44] Nope, it's like your homework assignment is this Jack Danger.

[10:48] Your homework assignment is this Keith Elwyn.

[10:51] Your homework assignment is this John Borg.

[10:53] We need you to do three games in one year.

[10:56] They're all going to be half baked and they're all going to fail.

[10:58] And then everyone's going to blame you.

[11:00] And this is the other part that sucks for all of these people over there that are creatives.

[11:05] Because in the end, it's like you're not blaming Seth Davis.

[11:10] You're not blaming the CMO.

[11:12] You're blaming John Borg.

[11:14] You're going to blame Jack Danger.

[11:15] You're going to blame George Gomez.

[11:17] You're going to blame Keith Elwyn if the games aren't where you want them to be.

[11:21] You're going to blame Zambietti.

[11:23] Because it's such a very personal product.

[11:26] That's what's so unique about it.

[11:28] Right? When you buy a car, do you know who designed the car?

[11:32] Do you know who designed the look of it?

[11:33] No.

[11:34] Do you know who designed the engine?

[11:36] No.

[11:36] Do you know who designed anything about it?

[11:38] No. All you know is I bought a Porsche.

[11:40] I bought a BMW.

[11:42] But this is very personal.

[11:44] You didn't buy food fighters.

[11:45] You bought Jack Danger's food fighters.

[11:48] You didn't buy Godzilla.

[11:49] You bought Keith Elwyn's Godzilla.

[11:52] They are more like movie directors than they are.

[11:55] A whole team of people is known and only the brand is what you associate with the game.

[12:01] And because of that,

[12:03] because it's very hyper personal,

[12:06] that is the problem Stern is facing today is they have lost.

[12:10] And I mean, I hear this from so many people.

[12:13] They have lost the personal enthusiasm to go through the door every day.

[12:21] And I'm hearing it from people that are there.

[12:23] No one's going to go on the record.

[12:25] Nobody.

[12:26] But you can witness is I've heard it from other pinball companies in the area who tell me,

[12:31] hey, Canada, you know, many Stern resumes are landing on my desk right now.

[12:38] Oh, so they're making that up?

[12:40] No, I don't think they are.

[12:42] I always said Stern to me had it all.

[12:45] They had it all.

[12:46] It was the place to be.

[12:47] If you were creative, you want to go somewhere where you can execute consistently.

[12:53] And your creation comes out every year.

[12:56] If you work for the other companies,

[12:58] you got to get to the end of the line after your game comes out.

[13:01] And it might be two to three years before your next game gets executed.

[13:05] But here's what's happening in pinball that these designers and these creators

[13:09] and these mechanical engineers and these electrical engineers and these line workers,

[13:14] they would rather work in a culture that was slower to get to their items.

[13:21] That's not toxic than work in a toxic culture that is always rushing,

[13:27] that is always putting pressure on everybody,

[13:30] that is trying to grow to a level that pinball will never grow to.

[13:34] And you're not going to grow it this way with subpar products.

[13:39] How do you release Star Wars, the walking dead and expect to grow?

[13:45] What was the strategy there?

[13:46] And you got to now start to point fingers and make people accountable.

[13:52] Like Seth, you were the CEO that green lit the remastering of the walking dead.

[13:58] You know what that shows me?

[13:59] You never surveyed the community.

[14:02] I think you probably just spoke to a few of your big dealers who were like,

[14:06] yeah, we'll sell more.

[14:07] Of course those dealers are going to tell you that because they don't care, bro.

[14:11] You're giving them a margin and profit.

[14:13] Of course they're just going to tell you what you want to hear.

[14:16] Any new stern, they want to have it from you.

[14:18] But if you actually went out there and looked at a few things, which you probably didn't,

[14:23] did you go to the pinside marketplace, Seth and new CMO, whatever his name is,

[14:27] did you guys go to the pinside marketplace and look at how easy it is to get a walking dead?

[14:35] Did you look at the prices that used walking deads were selling for?

[14:40] And then you still marched in and said, yep, we're going to make a $13,000 version of this game.

[14:45] And it's going to do fine.

[14:47] You know, you didn't.

[14:48] And now look where you're at.

[14:50] And I know people want to blame.

[14:51] Canada, this is just simple stuff, guys.

[14:54] And yeah, I have a little bit.

[14:56] When I say it's personal, I have a little bit of a personal chip on my shoulder

[15:01] because I marched into that company, not as canada as Chris,

[15:05] a dude with 25 years of marketing experience.

[15:09] And I cared.

[15:10] I, they didn't even expect anything from me.

[15:12] I spent so long making an entire deck and an observation and an analysis of their company.

[15:18] They didn't even ask for it.

[15:20] I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do.

[15:22] And I did it because I cared.

[15:24] And I cared about their company and I cared about their future.

[15:26] And I cared about the real issues at their door.

[15:30] And they ignored every single thing I said.

[15:33] And they just kept going down the same road,

[15:36] making boneheaded move after boneheaded move in the name of growth.

[15:40] So am I not as a person allowed to have a little bit of a personal sort of like annoyance

[15:47] with this company?

[15:49] When I talked to bug and Luke, they're always like, Chris, we want to hear your ideas.

[15:52] We want to hear what you, you have to say, we take everything you say into consideration.

[15:57] And I can see it, you know, it's like when bug and Luke make show games and I destroy them

[16:02] from a marketing standpoint from that, like that's terrible.

[16:05] What's the next thing out of Luke's mouth?

[16:07] We're never making show games again.

[16:09] They listen, they know.

[16:10] And I say that not because I think bug and Luke are morons for doing show games.

[16:15] They just got caught up in it.

[16:17] And the only reason they're doing it is they wanted to feed the dealers and the distros

[16:22] who were crying to them that they wanted more games because the game was so hot.

[16:26] We all know that and they're good people and they don't want to upset anybody.

[16:30] So they gave in, but they're not going to give in again.

[16:32] And that's the right move.

[16:34] And that's how you become great.

[16:36] You make decisions, you take some risks.

[16:39] Sometimes they work out.

[16:40] Sometimes they don't.

[16:41] And also you become great because you don't put growth and profit above everything else.

[16:48] You know, when you look at it and you just Google, like if a company becomes too big,

[16:53] does it lose itself?

[16:55] You know, and I know this is a little bit of an AI answer, but let me read this.

[16:59] And as I read this, tell me this does not feel like Stern pinball right now.

[17:03] Getting too big can ruin a creative company by slowing down decision making, diluting,

[17:11] unique culture, creating bureaucracy and losing the agility that fuels innovation,

[17:19] turning passionate individuals into cogs in a machine through unsustainable growth

[17:26] and a focus on process over people.

[17:30] Though this can be mitigated by codifying expertise and maintaining core values.

[17:36] Okay.

[17:37] This sounds exactly what has happened over at Stern.

[17:42] And as I've been saying, and I said it to George, I said to Seth,

[17:45] and I'll say it to each and every one of you right now, when I went into Stern,

[17:50] that was my main message.

[17:52] You have to get back to what made, what made your game so special, what made not just your

[18:01] le so special, what made your brand so special.

[18:05] It's not insider connected.

[18:07] It's not stupid badges.

[18:10] It's not saying publicly, we only had eight months to make this game.

[18:14] It's not saying publicly, well, because of licensure issues, we couldn't put guns on John Wick.

[18:20] It's not saying publicly, we're never going to make more le's.

[18:23] And then you make three, four different versions of Elvira.

[18:27] You make the Jaws premium 50th nicer than the le.

[18:31] All this stuff, all this stuff, you think you can just keep shoveling this stuff out

[18:36] to the pinball buying community and we're just going to keep gobbling it up.

[18:40] And then I look at the other companies, man, I know exactly what's happening

[18:44] at every other boutique.

[18:46] And the stuff they're coming with is the complete opposite.

[18:50] Look at like barrels of fun, for example, growth.

[18:52] No, David Van S just needs to make great games and he knows.

[18:56] Like, see Dune, making Dune is like the result of picking a theme you think is going to be

[19:04] successful because of how big it is.

[19:06] And think about how crazy this is.

[19:08] You take a multi-billion dollar movie franchise and it can barely sell.

[19:13] And then you go to this obscure, unique, culturally interesting place

[19:20] called Winchester's Mystery House.

[19:22] This is the thing, the Winchester Mystery House story, the actual fact that it's out there

[19:28] in the real world and why it exists is so interesting and weird that it struck a nerve

[19:35] with our little subculture.

[19:37] We're Dune with Timothy Shamalama Ding Dong dating Kylie Jenner.

[19:42] He's like the poster child for vanity and all the garbage of the world we're trying to escape.

[19:48] No wonder people don't want it.

[19:50] And that's it.

[19:51] That's what this hobby will always be.

[19:54] You find the things that make our subculture tick and you make a passionate interpretation

[20:01] of that thing and we will buy.

[20:04] And your growth will be incredible.

[20:07] And you won't have to bring in all these outside people that think they know better

[20:11] because they have some MBA where they studied other industries on how to grow.

[20:16] And then they come into the boardrooms and they crack the whips and they're like,

[20:20] where are my results?

[20:21] Where are my sales?

[20:22] I'm going to bring in a new sales guy.

[20:24] I'm going to bring in a new CMO.

[20:25] I'm going to bring in a million and a half dollars of all new salaries

[20:29] and that's going to make this company grow.

[20:31] No, no, that's never going to make it work.

[20:34] And I think when you see Pokemon, I mean this, I've heard it from many people now.

[20:38] When you see Pokemon, it is going to be the ultimate representation of a company that is fractured,

[20:45] a company that's not collaborating.

[20:47] It's going to be way more George Gomez than it is Jack Danger.

[20:50] This isn't an everyone get in the room and let's make the world's biggest IP

[20:55] and let's make it magical and let's show everybody what we're capable of

[20:59] as a company that works together.

[21:01] It is going to be a siloed bureaucratic made in a vacuum game.

[21:07] It's going to be soulless to the pinheads.

[21:09] It'll still sell well because of the IP.

[21:12] Mark my words.

[21:13] My belief when we see this game, it's going to be another pretty uninspired,

[21:19] empty, pretty barren game that they're going to blame the cost of the license

[21:24] as the reason why what's under the glass isn't nearly as special as a game like Lord of the Rings

[21:30] that came out freaking 22 years ago.

[21:34] And Stern pinball, if they need to call a board meeting,

[21:38] they need to call a board meeting and reset the entire damn operation

[21:42] and get back to their core values so that people want to walk through that door

[21:47] and do somersaults into that job because it should be the greatest job on the planet.

[21:53] You are taking people that love pinball more than anything

[21:56] and you've found a way to make a culture that is toxic enough where they don't even want to go in.

[22:02] They don't even want to go in.

[22:03] They clock in their hours and they're out the door.

[22:06] They've made it a simple transactional place to be for all of these super talented and super creative

[22:12] people and it's not going to work out.

[22:14] They made their millions.

[22:16] They got so big but they don't need to get bigger and bigger and bigger.

[22:19] Why?

[22:20] Why?

[22:20] What benefit does that have to the product?

[22:23] It doesn't work.

[22:25] Everybody, I love you.

[22:27] If there's someone who deserves more growth, it's freaking Canadian Spinball Podcast at $5 a month.

[22:32] I'm going to put this show up for free and I just want to say to everybody else out there,

[22:37] if more people spoke up, it would force Stern to change.

[22:42] Yeah, don't buy these mediocre games.

[22:45] They're going to have to make games better.

[22:47] Look at Beetlejuice, look at Winchester, look at Evil Dead, look at Harry Potter, man.

[22:52] These games are amazing and they're just going to keep getting better.

[22:55] And then you look at Star Wars, a glow worm.

[22:58] You look at these new cabinets.

[23:00] You look at all the stuff they're doing and trust me, when you see Pokemon,

[23:04] I'm almost like 95% sure.

[23:07] Those of you who love Pokemon, if I were to ask you,

[23:10] who would you want to make your dream theme now in 2026?

[23:14] How many of you are saying Stern number one?

[23:16] How many?

[23:17] None, none.

[23:19] And I'm telling you right now, you're going to be like, damn it,

[23:21] Canada was right and Iceman and Levy and Neil McRae are going to have to go on pin side.

[23:26] Be like, yeah, man, I don't really like them, but he was kind of right about Pokemon.

[23:30] Kind of right about everything.

[23:31] Half the time people, peace out.

[23:40] Apparently a lot of people don't like me.

[23:42] There's no cell phones in rehab and that's where I'm going so come find me.
