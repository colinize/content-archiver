[00:00] Whoever told you that you could work with men, what you're hired for is to help us.

[00:04] Does that seem clear to you?

[00:06] To help us?

[00:08] Not to fuck us up.

[00:10] To help men who are going out there to try to earn a living, you fairy.

[00:15] SINGO SINGO SINGO SINGO SINGO SINGO SINGO SINGO SINGO

[00:20] I flew all the way from New York City for this shit.

[00:24] I'm serious.

[00:26] I just got out of the worst presentation I've ever seen in my entire life and I'm tired

[00:32] and I'm exhausted and I'm so fed up with these pinball companies not taking this shit seriously.

[00:41] You have a room with a captive audience of people who want to buy your game.

[00:47] You have a room of people that are pinball fanatics.

[00:50] You have people on the internet who are watching you and they're hanging onto every word you say

[00:56] and every future sale hinges on how well you articulate why people should be excited about

[01:04] what you're about to show them and then you have the audacity to get up there, Jersey

[01:10] Jack Pinball and do a presentation that was just completely disastrous and we're going

[01:17] to talk about it right now because I don't even know how to put into words exactly how bad

[01:25] a presentation it was and I'm not being a drama queen.

[01:28] People were walking out immediately and it just reeks of a completely unrehearsed like

[01:35] let's just wing it, give us a mic and we have an hour of time to fill and there was

[01:41] absolutely zero preparation.

[01:43] So here's the thing.

[01:45] If you watched it, Jersey Jack Pinball got up there and they quickly talked about Pires

[01:50] of the Caribbean and then they got right to the Wizard of Oz.

[01:53] I mean like 15 minutes in, maybe even 10 minutes in in a hard to hear a seminar room.

[01:59] They started talking about Wizard of Oz and Yellow brick road edition Wizard of Oz.

[02:03] There was absolutely no build up.

[02:06] There was no reason why.

[02:08] There was no data.

[02:09] There was no supporting facts of here's why Wizard of Oz pinball will be coming back to you.

[02:14] I didn't even mention we've sold three four five six seven thousand unit.

[02:19] They didn't talk about how globally all over the world wherever they take this game.

[02:23] There's demand for it.

[02:24] No, there was nothing.

[02:25] There was no build up.

[02:26] There was no excitement.

[02:28] There was nothing.

[02:29] All right.

[02:30] But before I get to that, before I get to that, I have to talk about Jack and his team.

[02:35] They're here to convince you to buy their games.

[02:38] They're here to get you excited about Jersey Jack pinball and I'm sorry, but it's been

[02:43] seven eight years now and Jersey Jack pinball just knows better about how to get us excited

[02:50] about their products.

[02:52] It's so embarrassing to hear them get up there with absolutely zero enthusiasm.

[02:58] What is the point?

[02:59] Jack has his teammates up there and they're talking in this monotone way as if they don't

[03:04] even want to be there.

[03:06] Can you blame Eric when Jack kicked it to Eric to talk about pirates?

[03:11] He sound it like, first of all, he didn't even want to be there.

[03:14] He also was talking as if he just couldn't even...

[03:20] I don't know.

[03:21] He was surprised that Jack even called on him to start talking about the game.

[03:25] It's like they clearly didn't rehearse it.

[03:28] Can you blame him, though?

[03:29] Can you blame Eric for not being enthusiastic and excited to be up there?

[03:35] The guy is probably fuming underneath the surface and here's why and I totally understand

[03:41] and I empathize with Eric.

[03:43] Imagine if you're Eric, you designed this game for two years plus.

[03:47] You put your heart and your soul into it.

[03:49] You make a unique layout.

[03:51] You do everything you can with the limited assets.

[03:53] You create a game that you're really, really proud of, that you worked so hard of and

[03:59] a game that just got on the line.

[04:01] A game that is just being manufactured.

[04:03] A game in which people are starting to realize what you realize about the game.

[04:07] They're realizing that they think it's a really amazing game.

[04:10] People are loving their pie or to the Caribbean who are buying the game.

[04:14] In the same moment in which people are starting to finally realize they love your game, they

[04:18] yank it from you.

[04:19] They take it off the line and they cease production of the game and they go back to making a game

[04:24] that they made seven, eight years ago.

[04:27] Imagine if you're him.

[04:29] Here we are.

[04:30] We don't get to talk about my game or how everyone's finally falling in love with my vision.

[04:34] We're now going to quickly punt it to a game that's been out seven years ago.

[04:39] How fucking, how much of that suck for Eric to even be up there and why even have him up

[04:45] there?

[04:46] I mean, I felt bad for the guy like listening to him like in this monotone way.

[04:51] He sound it like someone who just found out they owe a lot on their taxes.

[04:58] It was really just this painful, slow monotone.

[05:04] Oh my God, you have to hear it.

[05:06] It will be on the internet.

[05:07] So then we get to the where the wheels really fall off this presentation and that is Jack

[05:13] pivoting to the limited edition yellow brick road of the game.

[05:20] And so it was such a weird way they revealed it.

[05:23] I mean, he called up Bill Brandnis in Sabrina to take the wrapper off the game.

[05:27] Bill was like kind of a little bit surprised.

[05:30] The thing was wrapped in black and they revealed the game and look, it's Wizard of Oz with

[05:35] yellow armor and some sparkle, the wood apron is back.

[05:39] And I really wanted to love this game.

[05:41] I really, really wanted to go in on a Wizard of Oz if they really did something over the

[05:46] top and special with the game.

[05:48] But here's here's where I just I can't excuse this company anymore and Jack, you just

[05:52] know better.

[05:53] You've been in this industry for so many years.

[05:55] I flew all the way from New York.

[05:57] All of these people have traveled long distances to get here to Texas pinball festival and you're

[06:02] one of the few seminars that everybody wanted to see you had a packed room and you fucking

[06:08] drop the ball.

[06:09] You got to take this shit more seriously, Jack.

[06:12] This is your company.

[06:13] I know I'm going on a little bit of a tangent, but just follow with me here.

[06:16] This is your brand and they don't seem to take the brand seriously.

[06:21] The brand of Jersey Jack pinball isn't just about the pinball machines you make.

[06:25] The brand of Jersey Jack pinball is how you conduct yourself every time you have a captive

[06:32] audience that is listening to you represent your company.

[06:36] If I gave a presentation like that at my company, I would be fucking fired immediately on

[06:42] the spot.

[06:43] If someone on my team acted as unenthusiastically as Jack's team was acting up on stage, I would

[06:50] fire them on the spot immediately.

[06:53] You are trying to sell people your product.

[06:57] You are trying to get them excited and enthusiastic around your brand.

[07:01] This is the best you can do after seven, eight years of making pinball machines.

[07:07] The comfort level is not there.

[07:09] The excitement is not there.

[07:11] The enthusiasm is not there.

[07:13] Then you're going to dovetail.

[07:14] You've set the stage and you board everybody to death and then you're going to go reveal

[07:19] what you reveal.

[07:20] Here is how Jack revealed it.

[07:22] This is fucking incredible.

[07:24] He says, how many of you in the room have Wizard of Oz?

[07:28] How many of you in the room would love to get a Wizard of Oz machine and nobody's

[07:38] hand went up?

[07:40] Think about that for a minute.

[07:41] Nobody's hand even inched up and said, I want a Wizard of Oz.

[07:45] I raised my hand.

[07:46] I was the only hand that was raised up in the air.

[07:50] Nobody in the room says that they want another Wizard of Oz.

[07:53] Right there, right then in there.

[07:55] Here is their market research that shows that people want this game again.

[08:00] Maybe it exists.

[08:01] Maybe people in Dubai and China and Thailand all of a sudden want a Jersey Jack Wizard of

[08:05] Oz, but it sure is hell-ing.

[08:06] People at Texas Pinball Festival, which is rule number one of marketing, is know the audience.

[08:11] You're talking to.

[08:13] Let's get into a little bit of the details of this thing.

[08:16] He shows the game.

[08:18] We see the game and look, it's Wizard of Oz with yellow armor.

[08:21] Then here is where it just gets ridiculous.

[08:24] They didn't think this throughout.

[08:26] They didn't think this out.

[08:27] They didn't rehearse it.

[08:28] They didn't talk this through to someone and then ask for, what would people think if

[08:33] we presented it this way?

[08:35] He says that the game is $11,500.

[08:38] $11,500 for this, which makes it the most expensive Wizard of Oz ever made.

[08:46] Then you learn the truth about the game.

[08:49] Here is a little bit of the details.

[08:51] It's in the new cabinet.

[08:53] The same cabinet is dialed in and as pirates, the Caribbean, so all the computer systems

[08:58] and boards get moved to the back box.

[09:01] It's got a wood apron like the Emerald City version of Wizard of Oz.

[09:06] It's got yellow habit trails on it.

[09:10] It's got yellow armor.

[09:11] But then here is where it gets really, really interesting.

[09:16] It's $11,500.

[09:17] Surely they put more into the game.

[09:20] Jack kept saying there's more in this game.

[09:22] There's more in this game.

[09:23] But there's not.

[09:24] There is no more in the game.

[09:25] They removed the flying monkey mechanism from the game.

[09:29] When someone asked that, is the flying monkey still in the game?

[09:31] Jack said, yeah, the animations are there and he's animated.

[09:35] They moved the physical mechanism from the game and now he's an animation.

[09:41] That's adding to the game.

[09:42] That's going in the wrong direction.

[09:44] We're jacking the price up.

[09:46] We're charging you more and we're giving you less.

[09:50] There is no way to spin that.

[09:51] There is no way to spin the fact that you are being charged for more and you're getting

[09:56] less.

[09:57] I know the spin that they are trying to communicate is, well, we made the game more reliable.

[10:01] We made some improvements.

[10:05] How can you improve something that you took away?

[10:08] You didn't improve the monkey mechanism.

[10:11] You just removed it.

[10:13] There's a big difference there.

[10:14] That's not an improvement.

[10:16] It's a removal of something that people enjoyed and paid money for.

[10:20] Here's the big, there's no way around this.

[10:23] This game came out seven years ago or six, seven years ago.

[10:29] The majority of the presentation that they went through at the seminar, they went back

[10:36] and started talking about how they did the fucking animations for Wizard of Oz.

[10:40] I'm sitting there thinking, why are we talking about how you made this game that's been

[10:45] out for seven fucking years.

[10:49] Here you've got Erick on stage who just built a brand new game, a brand new game that's

[10:55] finally catching on and getting steam with the pinball community and he's got nothing

[10:59] to say and we're going back and now you're trying to brag to us and boast to us about

[11:05] what went into making Wizard of Oz.

[11:07] I'm sorry.

[11:08] What the fuck?

[11:09] Who thought that was a good strategy?

[11:12] This company should be looking forward and we are really excited about what Jersey

[11:17] Jack has in the future waiting for us.

[11:20] Why are they even here?

[11:22] Why are they at Texas Pinball Festival having this seminar that bored the hell out of everybody

[11:28] just to drop this game on the floor that's a seven year old game with just a different

[11:32] armor and it's retooled.

[11:34] It just blows my mind.

[11:37] These companies need to wake up and start acting like professional companies.

[11:41] This is a waste of money.

[11:42] This is an absolute waste of money for them to be here.

[11:46] They fail to excite people around this game and yet they spent all the money to fly here.

[11:51] They spent all the money to fly the game here and then they drop this on us and here's

[11:56] Kaneda in his hotel room instead of being out there on the floor because I couldn't take

[12:02] it anymore.

[12:03] I had to get out of the room.

[12:04] I had to get out of the room.

[12:06] I am so embarrassed that this is the kind of presentation these companies are doing and

[12:11] I think it shows a total lack of respect for all the people who spend a lot of money

[12:16] and all the people who travel a far distance to get to these shows.

[12:19] These companies need to get their seminars butted up.

[12:21] This is a joke.

[12:23] This is like, I have entry level employees at my company that could put a better presentation

[12:29] together than this.

[12:30] This is amateur hour, Jack.

[12:33] Amateur hour.

[12:34] You're a good talker, Jack.

[12:35] The problem is, is Jack, once the mic is at a Jack's hand, he's sitting back there watching

[12:40] his team just bore the living daylights out of the room and he's just sitting there.

[12:45] I would have jumped up and been like, okay, guys, let me tell you why.

[12:48] But then that's the problem.

[12:50] When he tries to tell you why you should buy a yellow brick road edition, there's nothing

[12:54] really to say.

[12:55] Here's the worst part about it all.

[12:58] If you think Jack has learned his lesson about limited edition machines, he hasn't.

[13:03] Here's how they sold it to the room.

[13:04] He said, we're going to make 200 of these this year and then we'll see where we go from

[13:11] there.

[13:13] What the fuck, Jack?

[13:15] Limited edition means you set the limit before people buy.

[13:19] A collector wants to know exactly how many games are going to be made before he commits

[13:24] because the number of games determines the resale value on these games.

[13:29] You're not being honest with people, Jack.

[13:32] Well, here's what I did, Jack.

[13:33] I talked to one of your distributors.

[13:35] I talked to two of your distributors.

[13:37] They know what your plan is and you're not telling people what the plan is.

[13:41] The plan is you're going to make 500 of these or you have enough parts to make 500.

[13:46] So you're going to say to people, we're only making 200 and that's all we're making this

[13:51] year and then you're going to go and what, make another 300 next year.

[13:55] What world do these guys live in where they think they can't be honest with us about

[14:01] the number of games they're going to make?

[14:03] And Jack keeps doing this.

[14:04] Well get ready for the for the black pearl edition coming soon.

[14:08] Get ready for this and that and that.

[14:09] It's just it's so no, you know what he said?

[14:11] He also said this.

[14:13] Somebody said, are you done making Ruby red editions and he says we are for now, but we might

[14:19] make more in the future.

[14:21] What the fuck, Jack?

[14:22] No, that's not acceptable.

[14:25] That is not acceptable.

[14:26] I'm so upset right now.

[14:27] I'll tell you why I'm upset because I love Jersey Jack Pimball and I want Jersey Jack

[14:31] Pimball to succeed, but this kind of wishy washy, like ambiguous answers to questions,

[14:37] like how many are you going to make in total and going back on prior promises and then

[14:41] just keep adding more and adding more and making more.

[14:44] It's disingenuous and I don't want to support a company that acts so unprofessional and

[14:51] like like amateurs.

[14:53] Like what are you doing Jack?

[14:55] Stop.

[14:56] Stop.

[14:57] It's a slap in the face to Eric that you like you stop pirates to then push this forward

[15:03] and we all know this.

[15:04] Here's the other thing.

[15:05] I'm going to tell you guys right now, Jersey Jack Pimball is revealing Willy Wonka at the

[15:11] Midwest gaming classic.

[15:13] That is where the game will be revealed.

[15:15] And so why did what what is the point of being here?

[15:18] This is such a this is such a waste of my time to do this show.

[15:22] It was a waste of my time to be in the crowd there.

[15:25] There was no enthusiasm.

[15:26] It's on professional.

[15:27] I'm sorry.

[15:28] This is just a rant, but it's bullshit.

[15:30] It is total bullshit.

[15:32] This company needs to get their act together and start acting like a leader that they can

[15:37] be.

[15:38] The games are going to be there.

[15:40] But man, the professionalism, it's not there.

[15:43] And sort of if you're going to release Willy Wonka at the Midwest gaming classic, awesome.

[15:48] Cool.

[15:49] Don't do this yellow brick road edition.

[15:53] You know what happened is this.

[15:54] They could they just didn't want to commit to ordering more parts to pirates.

[15:58] They shelved it because of that.

[16:00] And they need to keep the line going.

[16:02] So they're just doing this BS version of Wizard of Oz.

[16:05] $11,500 for a game with removed features that they're not even going to tell you how

[16:10] many they're making in total.

[16:12] It is like the worst of the worst of the worst.

[16:14] It's like Jack took every marketing idea he had and said, how can I fucking make it

[16:17] even more confusing and blow up bad ideas from the past and make them even worse.

[16:22] I mean, it's like a collector's edition.

[16:24] That's not quite a collector's edition because you don't know how many are going to be

[16:26] made.

[16:27] But yet it's the same roughly the same price of a collector's edition.

[16:30] And here's the thing, Jack.

[16:31] And then I'm going to end this podcast and I'm going to go have some steak dinner with

[16:34] my friends at T.P.F.

[16:35] Here's the thing you don't understand, Jack.

[16:38] You got to zoom out a little bit, bro.

[16:40] You got to zoom out.

[16:41] I can go tomorrow and get a beautiful Emerald City Wizard of Oz game tomorrow and get

[16:49] it for $6,500 to $7,000.

[16:52] Why would I pay $5,000 to $4,000 more for this game?

[16:58] You're what are you doing, Jack?

[17:01] What are you doing?

[17:02] It's time for everyone at Jersey Jack Pimball to take a long look in the mirror and say,

[17:07] if we ever get in front of a crowd again, we're going to fucking rehearse.

[17:11] We're going to be professional.

[17:13] And if you're going to join me up on stage, everybody, you better have enthusiasm that

[17:17] makes people want to buy from this brand, not just this game, but the brand of Jersey Jack

[17:24] Pimball look like a joke tonight.

[17:26] And that's why I'm calling this Jersey joke presentation disastrous.

[17:32] Grow up, guys.

[17:33] Act like professionals.

[17:34] Can you get it out?

[17:35] You want to learn the first rule?

[17:38] You know if you ever spent a day in your life.

[17:42] You never open your mouth till you know what the shot is.
