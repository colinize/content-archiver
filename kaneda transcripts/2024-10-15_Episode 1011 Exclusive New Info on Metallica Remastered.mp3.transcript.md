[00:00] Well, I never thought I'd say these words again.

[00:25] Only 500 stern lees.

[00:28] I mean, it's been like four or five years since we've only had 500 stern lees and now

[00:36] it is official Metallica remastered.

[00:41] Only 500 lees is it going to sell out.

[00:44] Of course it's going to sell out.

[00:46] I was on Nitro's page.

[00:47] They had two left in inventory.

[00:50] I hit refresh and it sold out.

[00:53] Melissa at Cointaker can't even get me one.

[00:55] I thought this game's not even available for sale yet, but this is how it used to be.

[01:02] Games were spoken for before they were even revealed by the manufacturer.

[01:08] And if you were lucky enough to get one, then you had something that way more people wanted

[01:13] than there was supply.

[01:15] And then the games went up in price instantly on the second hand market.

[01:20] But here's what I'm not so sure about.

[01:23] At a $13,000 starting price, these things are going to go north of that.

[01:29] Here's the crazy part, everybody.

[01:31] And I don't even need to like hype this game.

[01:34] It's Metallica.

[01:36] It's a Lyman sheets masterpiece.

[01:38] Here's what I know about this game that no one else has told you.

[01:41] This game is going to have the original code.

[01:44] It's also going to have expanded code.

[01:47] That's why they're calling it remastered.

[01:49] And here is another thing that nobody knows.

[01:52] When Stern reveals this game on Wednesday, all of the accessories are going to be available

[01:59] on day one.

[02:01] The topper will be available on day one.

[02:04] Everything, the shooter rods, the armor, everything.

[02:07] So if you want to order your game with everything you want, you're going to be able to get it

[02:12] on day one.

[02:13] It's going to have all new artwork as well.

[02:16] I heard this thing sold through to dealers in 10 minutes, right?

[02:19] 10 minutes.

[02:20] It's sold through to all the dealers.

[02:21] All the dealers I spoke to today, they were just trying to get more.

[02:26] They've been so used to having a thousand that their allocations, all of their allocations

[02:30] got cut in half on a game that's going to have way more demand than John Wick, than

[02:36] X-Men, than Venom.

[02:38] It's Metallica.

[02:39] And you know, I almost feel bad for Jack Danger that this thing is hitting right on top of

[02:46] his moment.

[02:47] X-Men, it's like the first time he's really going to have the game at a major show.

[02:53] And then this thing is going to drop on a Wednesday.

[02:56] And we know how pinball is.

[02:58] We're very fickle.

[02:59] We move on to the next thing.

[03:01] And so I do feel bad because X-Men LEs have not sold out.

[03:05] And 811 is a lot more than 500.

[03:10] And Metallica is just a masterpiece.

[03:13] It is just a masterpiece.

[03:15] And they're going to make it even better.

[03:17] So it's a no-brainer.

[03:19] If you can get your hands on one, there's probably no safer bet recently in the pinball

[03:25] world.

[03:27] So that's exciting.

[03:28] We're going to see this game on Wednesday.

[03:30] We also now know, I think it's been like four years, Cactus Canyon is finally getting

[03:36] that big code update that everyone has been waiting for.

[03:41] And Mr. Sharp teased all the different modes that are going into the game.

[03:47] They look really fun.

[03:48] They look really awesome.

[03:50] But there's still just something about Cactus Canyon with the DMD dots.

[03:55] There's something about it.

[03:56] It's just looking dated.

[03:58] It just does.

[03:59] I get it.

[04:00] It's a beautiful pin.

[04:01] It is a world under glass.

[04:02] It is filled with mechanisms.

[04:04] I mean, look how many mechs are in Cactus Canyon.

[04:07] Then go look at how many mechs are in a $15,000 avatar or a $13,000 John Wick.

[04:17] It's crazy how loaded Cactus Canyon is.

[04:21] But unfortunately, there's just so much happening in pinball that stuff can feel a little like

[04:28] obsolete and outdated pretty quickly.

[04:32] Going back to Metallica for a minute, you know, what's going to be on the LCD screen?

[04:37] What will the lighting look like?

[04:38] It's not spike three.

[04:41] Will it have the bigger screen?

[04:43] So that's the thing.

[04:44] It's like even though they're bringing Metallica back and it's most likely going to have some

[04:48] concert footage and new animations, a lot has changed in pinball since Metallica was

[04:55] such a beloved pin.

[04:57] This is the part that I'm really curious about to see how the community responds because

[05:02] back when Metallica came out, you have to remember there was no like hand drawn illustrated

[05:09] artwork on machines back then.

[05:12] That's when Stern was doing all the ugly clip art drag and drop.

[05:17] And then they did it different on Metallica and Gary didn't want to do it.

[05:21] And John Borg pressured him to do it.

[05:24] And Dirty Donnie and Borg made a beautiful work of art.

[05:28] That surprised a lot of people.

[05:30] Now fast forward like what is it like 12 years later?

[05:35] So much has happened in pinball where everything has gotten so good.

[05:40] So Metallica, right?

[05:41] A music pin that had its moment in pinball and it was incredible.

[05:46] But how do you make Metallica wow people again in a world in which music pins have now had

[05:53] stuff like Elton John and Guns N' Roses and Foo Fighters, right?

[05:58] We've come a long way.

[06:00] Iron Maiden, right?

[06:01] I forgot Iron Maiden.

[06:02] We've come a long way in which some of the most spectacular pinball machines that are

[06:07] based on musical acts have really raised the bar.

[06:11] So I'm excited to see it.

[06:13] I know there's new sculpts in the game, new artwork, new LCD stuff happening.

[06:19] The sound's going to be better.

[06:20] So it's going to be like Metallica on crack, but the bar has been raised and it's going

[06:27] to sell out instantly.

[06:28] It's going to be fun to watch people like try to claw over each other to get one.

[06:33] And it just feels like the good old FOMO days are back.

[06:37] And I'm going to be curious to see how Stern communicates this one a bit because remember

[06:43] they said they were never going to make more LEs of games that already had LEs.

[06:50] So what exactly is this then?

[06:53] I think they're going to consider it enough of a new game.

[06:57] I think what they meant by their older statement was like, if we've made 500 Jurassic Parks,

[07:04] we're not going to make 500 more of the exact same game with just different cabinet artwork.

[07:10] I think they're going to look at this as an entirely new game or like Metallica 2.0.

[07:16] And I think when people see it, I think we're going to agree with them that we didn't catch

[07:22] Stern in a lie.

[07:24] They simply found a big enough loophole to make more LEs.

[07:29] If you own a Metallica LE, I feel your pain because if you love this band and you want

[07:36] to have the nicest version of Metallica and you've had it all these years, you got your

[07:42] LE for probably $6,500.

[07:45] And you've seen it now be worth like at the height of COVID, a Metallica LE, $16,000.

[07:53] You've seen a $10,000 increase in price.

[07:56] You might have to slash off around like $6,000 to $7,000 now because I don't know who's going

[08:02] to want the old one if the new one does everything yours does and does it even better.

[08:08] So that's exciting.

[08:09] We've got the Cactus Canyon code.

[08:11] It feels a little day late and a dollar short on that game.

[08:15] Man, doesn't it all of a sudden feel like X-Men is yesterday's news?

[08:20] Avatar is yesterday's news.

[08:23] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland all of a sudden feels like it happened a long time

[08:27] ago.

[08:28] We're a very fickle group of people.

[08:32] The good news is for Metallica buyers, you're going to get your game in November.

[08:38] If games go on the line in November, Stern is going to crank them all out in one week.

[08:43] The wait for an Alice is going to be really long.

[08:46] X-Men LE, you can have it tomorrow.

[08:48] If you want it, you can have it tomorrow.

[08:50] But a time Avatar CE goes on the line.

[08:54] Man, I just, you know, I hesitate with this game all the time because as beautiful as

[09:01] it is, I am still just worried that as it currently stands, Avatar is a bit boring considering

[09:09] everything else happening in Pimbal.

[09:11] The sex appeal of the game itself, they need to make the code more exhilarating and that

[09:17] can be done.

[09:18] It really can be done.

[09:20] I think the way Avatar shoots is unique.

[09:22] It doesn't have many toys or mechs, right?

[09:25] So it's got to make up for the lack of toys and mechs.

[09:28] It's got to make up for it with exhilarating code.

[09:32] The clips are there, right?

[09:34] They've got all these beautiful clips from this multi-billion dollar franchise, but

[09:38] the game itself, it's just not grabbing people right now.

[09:42] And look, Metallica is the opposite.

[09:45] This code is exhilarating.

[09:48] Starting multi-ball in Metallica is one of the most memorable moments in most people's

[09:52] Pimbal like lives.

[09:54] And it's just going to get even better, you know?

[09:56] And even though like Metallica is a fan layout and we've come a long way, right?

[10:02] Since the traditional fan layout days, I mean, look at the layout of X-Men and it's not sold

[10:07] out.

[10:08] It's so good.

[10:10] And then Metallica is going to be a fan layout, right?

[10:13] All the shots just going one after another, after another, fanning across the playfield.

[10:19] Of course I know what a fan layout is now after 10 years.

[10:22] So I don't know, you know, it's going to be interesting where old meets new.

[10:27] And Will Stern Pimbal, will they be able to take an old classic and put a modern touch

[10:33] on it and have success?

[10:35] I mean, the LEDs are going to be sold out, but how well will the premium sell?

[10:39] I just think there's so many newbies in the hobby, especially over the last five years,

[10:45] who want to get stuff new in a box.

[10:47] The only issue with the newbies, they've been buying all these new and box games over the

[10:51] last four years and they've lost a small fortune buying all these LEDs.

[10:57] I feel bad for the guys who did that because this is the LE that you wanted to get.

[11:02] It wasn't John Wick.

[11:05] It wasn't Venom.

[11:06] It wasn't James Bond.

[11:08] It wasn't Foo Fighters.

[11:10] The only LE that's done well in terms of an LE purchase and LEDs should hold their value,

[11:17] only Jaws is done well.

[11:19] Everything else has been really bad in terms of buying new and box.

[11:25] So I think Metallica with only 500 is easily going to hold strong at $13,000.

[11:32] It easily is, gang.

[11:34] What else is going on?

[11:35] The other big thing happening, gang, is a lot of homebrew games are coming to Expo.

[11:41] I think we're going to see a lot of these indie homebrew games rock into Expo and really

[11:48] impress people.

[11:49] I'm like, someone just made a homebrew version of the pinball circus game.

[11:54] What happened to those circus Maximus guys?

[11:56] But now someone else just went and made it.

[11:59] It looks really cool.

[12:00] I'm looking at some other of these homebrew games.

[12:03] And there's a lot of creativity out there.

[12:05] And that's exciting.

[12:07] I really do feel like we should always be championing these homebrew games because this

[12:13] is most likely their resume to get a job at a major pinball company.

[12:19] I mean that.

[12:20] If you rock into a pinball show with something that's absolutely incredible that even eclipses

[12:28] what we're getting from the designers from all these companies, I think that person deserves

[12:33] a shot.

[12:34] And that's how we got Keith Elwin.

[12:36] And he's the greatest pinball designer of modern times.

[12:39] I really can't wait to see, as I watch Pinball Expo from afar, all these homebrew games.

[12:46] I think it's going to be the talk of the show, what's going on in the homebrew area.

[12:51] And I think Expo starts tomorrow, which is really weird.

[12:56] Everything's really going on until Thursday.

[12:59] You know, Wednesday's Stern's going to show Metallica.

[13:02] Now it's going to be part of their factory tour.

[13:05] I thought they were going to wait to have it only at the factory tour and unveil it

[13:09] then.

[13:10] But now this kind of makes sense.

[13:12] They're going to get it out there.

[13:13] They're going to get it sold.

[13:15] Probably will have it on the show floor now.

[13:18] It's clear they're not trying to create any distance between X-Men and this.

[13:25] The one part I don't get is the timing.

[13:27] I mean, just think about it from a marketing standpoint.

[13:30] You've got these unsold X-Men LEs.

[13:34] You've got dealers holding on to them.

[13:37] And now you've got a major pinball show coming up in which people are going to play all these

[13:42] games.

[13:43] And now you're taking attention away from X-Men and putting it on Metallica, which is going

[13:50] to sell out in one hour and is already sold out.

[13:53] I mean, try to go find one.

[13:55] You're not going to find one.

[13:56] The moment anyone's order banks open up, they're going to be gone, but not X-Men LE.

[14:02] I don't know.

[14:03] Why didn't they just let X-Men be the bell of the ball and then reveal this Metallica

[14:09] in just a few weeks?

[14:11] I mean, I don't know.

[14:12] I mean, Stern probably is really just trying to get as much revenue in the door as we head

[14:17] into the end of the year because after Metallica, it does beg the question, are we going to

[14:25] see Dungeons and Dragons in December?

[14:30] Will that be Spike 3?

[14:32] And does Dungeons and Dragons by Brian Eddy, does that game contain the major mech that

[14:40] Keith Elwyn said blew him away?

[14:44] Is it going to be a huge dragon in the game?

[14:47] Some dungeon that's going to be like a medieval madness castle?

[14:52] Every time I try to get you excited about Brian Eddy's finally going to do something

[14:57] like that castle, he never delivers.

[15:01] But I really am hoping that this is going to be the time when Brian Eddy does deliver.

[15:07] Gang look, it's a really exciting time to be in pinball.

[15:11] I don't know about you, but there's so much happening.

[15:14] We go from Alice to X-Men to like Avatar to Metallica.

[15:20] We know King Kong is coming from Keith Elwyn, right?

[15:23] It's going to be Spike 3, bigger screen, Dungeons and Dragons, maybe Pokemon.

[15:29] Harry Potter is definitely coming.

[15:32] And we all know this is the worst kept secret in pinball.

[15:35] I've been saying this forever.

[15:36] Dutch pinball is going to confirm back to the future at pinball expo.

[15:42] That is going to happen.

[15:43] They're going to need some help making those games though.

[15:45] There's no way Dutch pinball can make back to the future without a little help from some friends.

[15:51] So we'll see what happens with that scenario.

[15:54] I'm feeling it.

[15:55] You might hear I'm a little bit tired.

[15:57] It's been a really rough recovery.

[15:59] I'm finally starting to feel better.

[16:01] You know, and I really wish I could be there at pinball expo with everybody, everyone who's going there.

[16:07] Safe travels, my friends.

[16:09] I really hope everybody gets there safe and sound.

[16:13] It's going to be a blast.

[16:14] You're going to have such a great time.

[16:17] And I also want to give, I want to give a shout out to end this show to Todd, to Todd F.

[16:23] Todd, I don't want to butcher your last name.

[16:26] He joined the Raise the Roof Club.

[16:28] He went from five to $10 a month.

[16:31] Todd, thank you so much.

[16:33] I really appreciate it.

[16:35] And if anyone does it, I'll give you a shout out.

[16:37] That's it.

[16:38] I'm not greedy.

[16:39] I'm not begging you.

[16:40] I'm never going to raise the amount.

[16:42] Jeff, I'm talking to you, brother.

[16:44] I'm never going to raise the amount.

[16:46] And I'm just having a good time here.

[16:48] And I hope each and every one of you is having a good time listening to Canadian pinball podcast.

[16:54] And now you can go to pinside and said, hey, Canada, just let everybody know that Metallica is going to be available on day one with the topper.

[17:04] The stern's never done this.

[17:06] This is like the modern miracles are happening in pinball, everybody.

[17:10] Have a great day.

[17:36] .
