[00:00] Welcome to Gnade's Pinball Podcast, and I'm just here to do this show and tell you right

[00:12] now that I think something is fishy at Haggis Pinball.

[00:15] What do I mean by that?

[00:16] I'm going to tell you right now.

[00:17] Now you're telling me that Damien comes out this weekend just a couple days ago, does

[00:23] a video, doesn't show us any parts, any manufacturing.

[00:28] In fact, he says how difficult it is to get all the parts together for Fathom, and he's

[00:33] not going to give any ETAs on when Fathom production or shipping will begin.

[00:39] He said that to all of us on Saturday and Sunday this weekend, and now, just two days

[00:44] later, he is sending out invoices for people to pay their invoices in full to get their

[00:51] Fathoms get ready for it in eight weeks.

[00:55] He's now promising games will be on the line in eight weeks.

[00:58] Now here's why this is fishy.

[01:00] If he knew games were going to be on the line in eight weeks, why didn't he say so in the

[01:05] video he just did like two days ago?

[01:08] And why did he in the video two days ago say he was not going to give any ETAs on the game

[01:14] because they didn't know what it was yet, and now he's asking for people's money with

[01:19] an ETA of eight weeks?

[01:22] Do you see why this is fishy?

[01:23] Do you see why this is weird?

[01:25] Do you see why this hobby is so strange to me?

[01:27] Why would you send money until you've seen that they can manufacture these Fathoms?

[01:33] He goes on a video and says how much harder it is to engineer a Fathom than a Keltz.

[01:40] He hasn't shown us a line of people making any of these Fathoms.

[01:44] That's still the same Fathom prototype he's had there for like eight months, and he showed

[01:49] you some code.

[01:51] Did you see anybody in the factory?

[01:53] Did you see a line going?

[01:55] Did you see all the coin doors and all the parts and all the legs and all the bolts and

[01:59] all the pieces needed to put together these Fathoms?

[02:02] And yet he is sending out invoices.

[02:04] And I'm here to tell you right now, I hope they get this done, I hope they ship these

[02:08] machines but this makes me very nervous and this seems very fishy.

[02:13] Why is he sending out invoices if games are not 30 days away?

[02:18] This is not how you're supposed to do it.

[02:21] He has already missed every single deadline and now he is sending people a pay and fall

[02:28] non-refundable invoice of a game you have not seen being built in any numbers whatsoever.

[02:36] And how does he know in eight weeks that games are definitely going to be on the line?

[02:41] And here's the thing, I hope I am wrong.

[02:43] For those of you out there that think I wake up and I want to see these companies struggle,

[02:47] no I don't.

[02:49] But we've seen Damien do this before and I mean it when I say at the part I will never

[02:54] understand about him is he's once again giving an ETA when he does not know.

[03:01] Do you guys know like when Stern takes your money and Stern reveals a game, the game is

[03:05] on the line and we know that the riskiest thing you can do is pay and fall for something

[03:11] until you've seen proof they can make this game.

[03:14] We've seen zero proof that they have the parts in house to make the fathoms.

[03:20] We've seen zero proof they can make more than one prototype of fathom.

[03:24] Making Celts is not making fathom.

[03:27] And I don't understand, this is the part I just don't get.

[03:30] Explain to me, somebody in comments or just call me up or say something on my Facebook

[03:35] page, explain to me how 48 hours later after he just said he was not going to give an ETA

[03:42] because he didn't know yet, he gives an ETA when he takes more of your money.

[03:47] Do you see the pattern here with all of these boutique companies?

[03:51] The moment they want to take your money they give you something that's confidence inspiring.

[03:56] But the most confidence inspiring thing he can do is show us what's going on in the factory.

[04:02] You haven't seen any of it and you're going to pay an invoice.

[04:05] I just think this is fishy behavior.

[04:07] I think it's strange and I hope you guys get your games.

[04:10] I hope they get these games out in two months and I want to be wrong.

[04:15] But this is not the kind of behavior we should support.

[04:18] I would not be sending in a fully paid invoice until I see the parts.

[04:24] Damien, show us what you got.

[04:27] Do a video tour walking around the factory.

[04:31] Introduce us to the gentlemen or women who will be making these games.

[04:34] He hasn't shown us any of this and he's sending out invoices.

[04:39] Now here's the problem.

[04:40] He probably needs all that money to get the staff in the door.

[04:44] He needs all that money to order the parts and as we know and as we've learned from

[04:49] the years and years and years of watching boutique companies do this, it's a lot harder

[04:55] than he realizes to get all the parts in house, to get all the labor set up.

[05:00] He's never done this before.

[05:02] He's made just a handful of kelts machines.

[05:06] These machines are harder to make.

[05:08] Any date he puts out there seems like it's never going to be achieved because they're

[05:12] learning as they go.

[05:14] And this is my concern is why is he telling people eight weeks?

[05:19] Eight weeks.

[05:20] So two months from now and these are not just the series ticket holders.

[05:23] These are the actual beginning of just mermaid only orders.

[05:28] So in two months, we are going to see this game on the line.

[05:32] I hope I'm wrong.

[05:33] But man, how does this not smell fishy?

[05:36] Am I being a jerk?

[05:37] Should I be supporting this?

[05:38] No, I'm just going off of historically when we see companies do this and ask for invoice

[05:45] money before you've seen the line going.

[05:49] That is a really risky proposition.

[05:53] Why can't he show us more of what's going on behind the scenes?

[05:56] Everybody.

[05:57] Look, canada's pinball podcast is not going to do two hours and 15 minute shows.

[06:01] I was giving my friend Travis over at triple drain some grief for this.

[06:05] It's like, we don't need all these long shows.

[06:08] We don't need so much just back and forth.

[06:10] What we need is more people in the pinball content world actually holding more of these

[06:15] companies accountable and actually saying, Hey, like this is not good practice.

[06:20] And on the same day he gave out invoices for fathoms, Jerry Stelenberg showed us a picture

[06:27] of a weird owl in a box about to ship to somebody.

[06:30] So I owe Jerry Stelenberg $100.

[06:33] Now Jerry Stelenberg has game one in a box, but here's the other thing.

[06:37] Do congratulations Jerry, but where's game two?

[06:40] Where's game three?

[06:41] Again, if you have an assembly line going, shouldn't multiple games be done in a day?

[06:46] And wouldn't it make more of a statement if there were a bunch of weird owls all built

[06:51] and ready to go?

[06:52] Right?

[06:53] I mean, look, if you're on these rides and I mean it, the only reason I have to dedicate

[06:58] airwaves to Haggis and to P three, multi-morphic or multi-morphic P three, sorry, I got it

[07:03] wrong again is that nothing is happening from anybody else.

[07:08] Nothing is happening from Stern.

[07:09] Nothing is happening from JJP.

[07:10] So we are laser focused on these boutique companies that I'll tell you this right now.

[07:16] I don't like these boutique company rides.

[07:18] I wouldn't get on them.

[07:20] I got burned by spooky with Ultraman.

[07:22] It's just the forever wait.

[07:24] And then you don't know if your game's going to even be worth like 80% what you already

[07:28] paid for it.

[07:29] If people think these fathoms are going to be worth like twice as much money when they

[07:32] come out, no, they're not.

[07:33] They'll probably hold steady.

[07:35] They might go up a little bit, but these are not $20,000 machines.

[07:39] People were not clamoring to get fathoms before the remake was announced.

[07:43] But man, oh man, oh man, if I could give any of you some advice, lock up your wallets until

[07:49] you see actual manufacturing of the game you're going to buy.

[07:53] And you should be more scrutiny of the boutique companies.

[07:56] Is that even a word?

[07:57] Scrutinous.

[07:58] You should scrutinize the boutique companies way more than everybody else.

[08:02] You know why you should do it?

[08:04] Because if you've been listening to my podcast, 95% of these boutique companies, even if they've

[08:10] shipped one game, have gone out of business.

[08:15] 95%.

[08:17] So why is everybody always so ultra-confident every time a boutique company sends out an

[08:23] invoice?

[08:25] People in this hobby are pretty stupid if you ask me.

[08:27] They're like, oh, oh, everything must be going well because I got an invoice.

[08:30] No, that's the easy part, is to ask for people's money.

[08:35] And has everybody forgotten that when Damien announced Fathom in May and took your money,

[08:41] he said he would have games on the line in two months?

[08:43] And here we are, history repeating itself all over again.

[08:48] And all I want to know from Damien and Marty and everyone over there just show us proof

[08:54] that this time it's actually going to happen.

[08:59] Why aren't they showing us more proof before the invoices go out?

[09:03] I did not see on that video this weekend a man who was ultra-confident in giving an

[09:09] ETA on these games.

[09:11] And then two days later, we get this.

[09:14] He's sending out invoices and giving people an ETA.

[09:17] How is that not fishy?

[09:19] That's all I want to talk about on this episode.

[09:21] See I can do in 10 minutes or 8 minutes or 9 minutes.

[09:25] What other shows will go on for two hours about nothing even relevant in the pinball

[09:30] world?

[09:31] Is Canadian firing shots on the eve of the Twippy when he's going to kiss babies and

[09:35] shake hands down in Texas?

[09:36] Oh yeah, he is.

[09:37] Five for five, baby.

[09:38] This is how we do it.

[09:40] And this is why you're a member of the Canada Club because you don't need to sit through

[09:44] watching paint dry to get someone to actually look at this hobby the right way.

[09:49] Everybody, peace out.

[09:50] Canada, Tuesday, let's do it.
