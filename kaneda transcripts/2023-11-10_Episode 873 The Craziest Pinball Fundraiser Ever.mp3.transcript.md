[00:00] Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father, Run for your children, run for your sisters, and for robots, Leave all your loving, loving behind you,

[00:09] Make me read with you if you want to survive.

[00:12] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:30] I've been on the show for a really long time, but unfortunately Patreon did something weird.

[00:34] Now anyone who follows the page is also considered a member now, which is really strange.

[00:39] We're more right around 650 paid members, so you might see some other shows, their numbers start to spike a little bit,

[00:45] but the real test of it is who's actually paying to hear the best pinball podcast on the planet.

[00:51] On this episode, we're going to talk about what's going on in pinball.

[00:54] We're going to talk about how distributors have some Elton John's left.

[00:58] We're going to make this word some.

[01:00] The new meme in pinball in 2023.

[01:04] We're going to talk about spooky pinball a little bit.

[01:06] I got a nice note from Luke.

[01:08] He outlined how much they put in their games for less than $10,000.

[01:13] We're going to read that.

[01:14] And then on this episode, we are going to have the most ridiculous, the most insane fundraiser effort that came to the doorstep of

[01:23] Canada's pinball podcast.

[01:25] It is explosive.

[01:26] It is on fire.

[01:28] It is going to be something that if this happens, I think it's going to be the greatest piece of pinball content

[01:34] we might ever see in the entire history of pinball content.

[01:39] And that's going to happen at the end of this show.

[01:41] I'll explain what that's all about.

[01:43] So let's talk about Elton John a little bit.

[01:46] I just saw Jack Guinari went on the loser kid pinball podcast.

[01:50] I just listened to most of it.

[01:52] I was interested in one simple thing.

[01:54] The thing I wanted to hear and Jack told the truth.

[01:58] I wanted to hear if Steve Ricci wanted to make Elton John, because I firmly believe when you give a designer a theme they want to make,

[02:08] you are going to get a much more passionate and a much more interesting game than if you simply hand a designer a theme he has to make.

[02:19] Something you want versus something you have to do.

[02:23] We're all still little kids inside.

[02:24] Ask a little kid to do something he doesn't want to do and see what happens and then tell him he can have what he wants and see how excited he gets.

[02:33] And Jack did confirm that Steve wanted to make something more explosive with race cars and spaceships and high octane kind of game.

[02:41] And he had to settle for Elton John.

[02:44] Now he didn't use the word settle.

[02:46] I'm going to use the word settle.

[02:47] But that just goes to show you that he was handed an assignment and he had to make Elton John.

[02:53] And so look, the game is not bad, right?

[02:55] I'm not saying this game is bad.

[02:56] It's like Godfather.

[02:57] We're going to talk a little bit about Godfather and how that game became the number two ranked game on pinside.

[03:04] And then people got upset by that and they voted it down and now it's around number 30.

[03:09] You know, makes no sense to me why people even care what the game is ranked.

[03:12] If you own it and you enjoy it, why would you care what some bozos on pinside

[03:17] ranked the game?

[03:18] It's not like people who are buying pinball machines are like, wait a minute, let me check its pin side ranking before I give you an offer on the game.

[03:26] You know, two days ago, I was going to offer you $14,000 for your Godfather's CE when it was the number two greatest game of all time.

[03:34] And now I'm going to offer you $12,000 because it's the number 30th game of all time.

[03:39] The truth is this, people, anyone who voted Godfather's CE to be the second greatest pinball machine of all time.

[03:46] All of you who voted it that, you're the problem, not the people voting it down.

[03:52] Do you really think that Godfather is the second greatest pinball machine ever made?

[03:58] You really think that's the case. It's unbelievable to me.

[04:01] So yes, somewhere around 30 or 40 is where this game will net out.

[04:06] Gang, come on. Like seriously, like wake up. Like we can't just do this.

[04:10] Like that game is not better than medieval madness. It's not better than Tron.

[04:14] It's not better than freaking Lord of the Rings. It's not better. I could go on and on and on.

[04:18] It's not better than guns and roses. Sure, it shoots better than guns and roses, but the experience, no way.

[04:24] I mean, this game, I mean, it's just funny to me. Like all these Godfathers are going to go up for sale.

[04:28] And as I said, look, the greatest thing to happen to Godfather is Elton John.

[04:32] But anyway, let's talk about Elton John again. Elton John is going to be an interesting game.

[04:36] The thing about Elton John is it's not on the line just yet. So when the games start to be made,

[04:41] I think they're going to find more buyers once games are available.

[04:45] The pinball buying community, you know, we always want to unbox something,

[04:49] but I think it's not about whether the game is good or not. And this is the part that people don't get.

[04:53] We're not ragging on Elton John from a gameplay standpoint. Of course, it's going to be

[04:59] the best shooting Jersey Jack game of all time. The thing is, it's just going to lose two to $3,000.

[05:05] The moment you unbox it. And that's the only issue with the game. Now,

[05:09] loser kid did ask Jack Guinari about the pricing of his games. And Jack goes on a like 10 minutes

[05:17] story about pinball pricing. And it's ridiculous. Jack, just answer the question,

[05:22] why are you continuing to price these games at this much money when you're seeing the tremendous loss

[05:28] your customers are absorbing if they buy your games new and box? And that's it. I don't need to hear

[05:34] a 10 minute explanation about pinball sales.com. And back in my day, when we started selling games

[05:40] for 3500 people thought I was crazy when we asked 6500 for Wizard of Oz. I don't care.

[05:46] Let's talk about the here and the now. All right. So speaking about the here and the now. So I got

[05:52] a nice note from Luke, you know, we've been talking about, you know, is boutique pinball in a good

[05:56] position moving forward? And I think the answer is yes. Now, look, it's still up to these boutique

[06:01] companies to make great games, right? Just because your boutique doesn't mean you'll be successful.

[06:07] In fact, it's the opposite. The majority of boutique pinball companies have come and gone.

[06:12] They haven't survived. They haven't found profitability. But over at Spooky Pinball,

[06:16] they've been doing just fine over the last few years. So he told me that their next

[06:20] collector's edition is going to be under $10,000. Stern's premium price, but with $1,500 of options,

[06:28] a Stern premium does not have any list for me. What you will get in this Spooky machine,

[06:33] you will get a powder coated coin door, custom launch start buttons, lighted speaker grills,

[06:39] a topper, illusion candy powder coated armor, lighted flipper buttons, which must be $1,000,

[06:46] colored plastic protectors, interior graphics. Oh, and I almost forgot a knocker and a shaker.

[06:53] All of that included for under $10,000. Look, Luke, thank you for sending this.

[06:58] We are under no delusion that we are not getting ripped off by Jersey Jack and Stern Pinball. I

[07:04] mean, people, you know this. Do you really think Stern has like significantly increased its bomb?

[07:10] No, they just significantly increased the price of all of their games. And so, you know, we're not

[07:16] getting all of these things. And it's going to be really interesting when Jaws comes out. Are people

[07:20] going to flock to it? Will they sell the Ellie's on day one? I think Jaws is going to be a week one

[07:26] sell out. I do. I do. It's just Keith Elwin. It's like all of us. Think about it. For the last two

[07:31] years, nothing has really come out that lit the majority of the pinball buying community on fire.

[07:37] Think about it. Like what game did everybody universally love since Godzilla? I would say the

[07:44] only game that had the most universal love was Pulp Fiction and not a single game has been made in

[07:50] almost a year. And so now that Keith Elwin is coming out with a game, if you order it, you're

[07:56] going to be able to get it within a month or two of ordering your game. And so that is why I think

[08:02] this game will be a sales jug or not, regardless if it's ugly, regardless if there are not that many

[08:08] Jaws assets in the game, it's just going to scratch an itch that so many of us have been waiting to

[08:14] be scratched. And so I look forward to that game. I think everybody looks forward to the game, right?

[08:18] If you ask people like, what game can't you wait to see? It's probably Keith Elwin's Jaws.

[08:23] So that is exciting. Now the other thing I was thinking about, I didn't talk about these guys

[08:27] on the last episode. Let's talk about American Pinball for a minute, because I keep seeing on

[08:32] Facebook like American Pinball continues to share photographs from Pinball Expo, which was what?

[08:38] Like three weeks ago, and they've got really nothing left to tell us about Galactic Tank Force.

[08:44] They've paraded the game around different shows. They've brought the talent from the game to

[08:48] the show. Now what? Right? It's like now what can they do to get people to buy this game? So the

[08:55] thing I keep hearing is that Mukesh will not allow David Fix and his team over at American Pinball.

[09:01] He will not release their next game until they sell all of the GTFs that they ordered parts for.

[09:08] I'm hearing it was only 500 parts people. And so that becomes an interesting question. Do you think

[09:14] they sold 500 versions of Galactic Tank Force? Have you seen many unboxings? And here's the

[09:21] thing about Galactic Tank Force. I think David Fix needs to read the room. He needs to understand

[09:26] something real simple. You didn't sell them at the price you wanted to. If you want to move those

[09:30] 500 units, David Fix, here's what I would do. I would take like 1500 to $2,000 off the price of

[09:37] those tank versions of the game. You just got to do it. And here's the other part to do that,

[09:41] right? To do that and not sink their ship or have their tank be blown up. To do that, I think you

[09:47] might have to sell the games directly because think about it. Like that's the profit margin for a

[09:53] distributor to sell Galactic Tank Force. You got to make these games, David. You got to show Mukesh

[09:58] that you can move these units and nobody's buying where the game is priced at. No one's buying it

[10:04] for like 11 or 11.5. Nobody's buying that $17,500 version of the game. And so what are you going

[10:10] to do? I still have friends who ordered that version of the game and they are still waiting

[10:16] for their product. You know, it's a shame. I wish I could just order the lunchbox. I mean,

[10:20] that's the only part of that game I'd really want. And I think the ultimate thing is this. It's not

[10:24] about being negative. It's that Dennis Nordman was given a shot. He got the shot, right? He got on top

[10:30] of the stage and he had a chance to sing a song to win the judges over, to win over the pinball

[10:36] buying community. Dennis is a really nice guy, but he never should have made this game. He should

[10:41] have known better. He made this game for Dennis Nordman. He's been wanting to make this tank game

[10:46] for so long. He got his shot. They kind of made some Frankenstein version of his original concept

[10:53] and look what happened. It's a sales disaster. And I really wish in pinball, you know, when I go into

[11:00] my job every day, I'm accountable for all of my ideas. If my ideas fail, I'm in big trouble. If I

[11:08] have failure after failure, I would lose my job. And it's really sad that some of these pinball

[11:13] companies, they really seem like there's no accountability. How many American pinball games

[11:19] have to come out where they can't even sell a thousand units? Failure after failure. And it's

[11:26] because it's not his money. He's getting money from somebody else. The same is true over at Jersey

[11:32] Jack. Stern pinball is different. They've got investors and they need to make sure their games

[11:38] sell because they need to keep that line going. And I look, I really think Stern pinball is going

[11:43] to run into an interesting dilemma if people stop buying everything new in box. And I think Stern

[11:50] pinball is going to start to stockpile a ton of games if people just wait and see. And I think

[11:56] that's the way to go. By the way, people, some Elton John CEs are left. Do you really think they

[12:01] sold even close to a thousand Elton John CEs? Like no way, no way. The rumor I heard is that

[12:08] Mukesh wants all of these games sold by January 1st. Again, it's just a rumor. I'm not sure if

[12:13] that's the case. But look, if Ryan McQuade's next game is Cuphead, freaking Cuphead, you know, if

[12:19] I'm American pinball and that's the next game, if it wasn't the next game, they should basically

[12:24] come out and say, Hey, look, we're not going to tell you what our next title is, but it's not

[12:28] Cuphead. And the crazy part is I hear these guys have He-Man. They are sitting on the He-Man license

[12:34] and they made freaking galactic tank force and Cuphead instead. Are you kidding me? Like what

[12:39] is wrong with people at these companies? I really hope the rumor that barrels of fun has fifth

[12:45] element is accurate. I could see the next two titles be something like fifth element. I could

[12:50] see Princess Bride being a game that they might have. I could see it being something like Goonies

[12:56] or Gremlins. I'm really excited. They now have a partnership with Jim Henson. If it was the Muppets,

[13:03] I would be excited. I mean, the Muppets, imagine the Muppets with Animal on a drum set. That's the

[13:09] pop bumpers. I mean, it's right there, everybody. That would be super awesome. You know, super

[13:15] awesome. I mean, there's so much potential for pinball. And that's the thing, everybody, is I

[13:20] just see the potential in this hobby. And I just feel like over the last couple of years, we just

[13:25] haven't had like the best themes. We haven't had anyone really pushing the envelope in pinball.

[13:31] We haven't like, name me the best mechanism over the last two years in all of pinball. Name me the

[13:38] mechanical engineering thing you saw happen in 2022, 2023, that absolutely blew you away. And

[13:47] that's what's a little bit sad to me is like, shouldn't every new year, shouldn't every new year be

[13:53] an improvement on what this hobby is capable of? Like, where's new interesting ways to use magnets?

[14:01] Where's new interesting ways to save the ball? I get Jack Scott, the dead post that pops up. That

[14:06] is awesome. But man, no one's made something like the shooting stars in Toten. Like we can't think

[14:11] about another interesting way to save the ball from the out lanes. I do like how spooky had the

[14:17] balls on the apron, like that was new. That was original. I like the upper flipper and Scooby-Doo.

[14:23] But in terms of overall toys and mechs, you know, yeah, locking balls is one thing, but I want to

[14:28] see real interactive toys, real dynamic movement on that mechanism. And we're just not seeing it.

[14:35] At the same time, we're not seeing it. We're seeing the highest prices ever in pinball. And it's

[14:40] just that simple. And then the themes aren't take my money now themes. So you add this all up. And I

[14:46] know that some people think I'm negative. I'm just being realistic. I don't love pinball any less.

[14:51] And here's the part about pinball. I'll never understand. If I want all those things I just

[14:56] described, right, a great theme with magical mechanisms, great code that gives you replay

[15:02] value, guess what? There's about like 30 machines that have all of that. They have all of that. And

[15:08] you know what those games are. And for many of you, you own those games. So then the question becomes,

[15:14] why do you constantly need new games? Like why would we chase every single new game,

[15:20] especially when they are somewhat inferior to the games you already own? I mean, do you go out in

[15:26] public and stare at women that are less attractive than your wife? Like why would you do that? Do I

[15:32] get out of my Dodge Demon? And I'm like, oh man, I wish I had a Honda Civic. Well, maybe the Civic

[15:36] Type R. But why would we do that? And that's the thing. It's like so strange for all these years.

[15:41] And with all these content creators, it's so weird that the message has always been like bye,

[15:45] bye, bye. Like we're supposed to wake up and want to keep these pinball companies profitable

[15:52] while we're losing more money than ever before right now. And I just want to say this for the

[15:56] record, because people have been talking about this in other places on pin side. Yes, there's a lot

[16:01] of content creators who get $1,000 off. They get $1,000 off every game they buy,

[16:08] because they promote a distributor. And there's also content creators that more than that,

[16:13] they also get a monetary kickback every time they refer a person to said distributor. So think about

[16:21] that for a minute. If I could get $500 every time I referred someone to my friends at CoinTaker

[16:28] or Pinball Star or Automated, $500 every time I send someone to them to buy a Venom,

[16:35] then what would I say about Venom? If I got $500 every time I sent them a customer for Elton John,

[16:41] then what would my opinions about Elton John be? And that is why in life and in any sort of objective

[16:48] analysis of any industry people, there has to be a separation between church and state. There has to

[16:54] be. And you are not seeing those things disclosed. And those content creators know who they are.

[16:59] And they're terrified that I'm going to name their names, but I'm not, because it's dramatic and I

[17:03] don't want to get into the drama, but I'm just telling you that's what's happening all these

[17:07] years. And now that people are starting to wait and see, now that people are starting to pause,

[17:12] guess who's got all the momentum? Guess who's got the most followers? Guess who's got the most

[17:17] subscribers? Canadian Pinball Podcast. It's not negative talking about this stuff. It's just

[17:22] exposing the truth. There's nothing about my show that I'm hiding from anybody. I am not taking

[17:27] any money from anybody. I get no kickbacks. I get no deals. I get no special treatment. And

[17:32] you're like, oh, Canada, what are you talking about? You get no special treatment. You said you've

[17:36] already got it back to the future. And I do already have it back to the future. It's not called special

[17:40] treatment. It's just called, I knew who was making it and I got myself on the list. Now, don't go

[17:45] call it everybody, but look, I get a little bit of special treatment. But guess what? When I buy that

[17:50] game, I'm going to buy it for full price. And guess what? I'm not going to get any kickbacks

[17:55] if I send people to go buy said game. You know, back to the future is so damn popular. It doesn't

[18:00] even need distributors, but it's going to be distributed. It's going to be distributed. And

[18:04] I feel so happy for Chris and Melissa because they're going to be the distributors on the game.

[18:09] And look, they stuck with Dutch all these years. And I'm really happy that Barry is going to make

[18:14] those two people the ones who distribute the game in the US. I think Nitro will be in Canada.

[18:19] And I know that other shows are saying they're going to carry the game. Well,

[18:22] maybe they should fact check that because it ain't happening. All right, everybody,

[18:26] are you ready? All right, we were going out a little bit of a dramatic slippery slope when we

[18:30] start talking about content creators. All right, so here's the deal. This is crazy. This is crazy.

[18:34] So I got asked to do a fundraiser for a pinball moment. Now you're thinking like every time we

[18:40] do fundraisers, it's usually for a great cause. I want to give a shout out to the slam tilt pinball

[18:46] podcast because I shouted these guys out when they did this. But I heard on their show that I

[18:50] didn't give them credit for this. They did an amazing fundraiser for suicide awareness in the

[18:56] honor of Lyman sheets. And I think they gave the money to Penny for the donation. And I just want

[19:01] to say to Ron and Bruce, I thought that was amazing. And I'm sorry that you missed my accolades for

[19:06] you for doing it. But I've always respected the fact that you guys did such a class act there.

[19:11] And we saw Jason Knapp did a great fundraiser for St. Jude's. We did that huge fundraiser.

[19:17] Everyone was involved when Ken Cromwell did the fundraiser for Project Pinball. Over $50,000

[19:23] were raised for Project Pinball. And I'm here to tell you right now, this won't be one of those

[19:28] fundraisers. This isn't for one of those feel good causes. In fact, this fundraiser is designed to

[19:34] create some pain. And you're like, what do you mean pain, Canada? I'm like, this fundraiser

[19:39] came to my door. And if enough money is raised, some pain will be put onto a pinball machine

[19:46] itself. What what are you talking about? Here it is, people, the craziest pinball fundraiser of all

[19:52] time. An individual came to me who bought a puny factory. And he's been having many issues with

[19:58] his game. And he has unsuccessfully been able to come to a resolution with pinball adventures.

[20:05] And the man is fed up and he wants to get rid of this machine. But instead of getting rid of the

[20:11] machine at a loss, here's what he is willing to do. And this is the offer. This is the idea.

[20:17] He paid $7,000 for his puny factory. Now look, you know me, I would not spend $7,000 on a puny

[20:24] factory. I wouldn't spend 700 bucks on one. It's just not a game. I don't know how you ever come

[20:29] to that conclusion with all the great pinball in the world. But here's the idea. He is going to

[20:35] create a GoFundMe page that if he reaches $6,000 on the GoFundMe page, here is what will happen to

[20:45] that puny factory. The puny factory will go to TNT amusements. And Todd Tucky and this gentleman,

[20:54] and I've been invited to be at this event, Todd Tucky will hoist this game up to the roof of TNT.

[21:00] There's a rumor that they might even set it on fire and use the book that Todd was involved with

[21:07] to light the fire of the machine. And then the machine will be pushed off the roof of TNT amusements.

[21:14] So let me repeat that. If $6,000 is raised, you will get to see a puny factory lit on fire and

[21:22] thrown off the roof of TNT amusements. Now look, I don't know people. I don't know. That's only 100

[21:27] people donating 60 bucks to see what could be the most explosive pinball content we've ever seen.

[21:34] And you're hearing this here first exclusively on Canada's Pinball Podcast. I think my listeners alone

[21:39] would probably contribute enough to make this thing happen. And then the other special thing

[21:44] they've asked me to do, and I don't know if I'm going to do this, but this would be funny,

[21:48] that Canada before the machine is thrown off the roof that I would throw a drink in the face of

[21:53] the game that I would throw a drink, I'll get a vodka soda and I'll throw it into the translate

[21:58] as part of the entire event. Now think about that now. We've got Canada throwing a drink into the

[22:03] face of puny factory. We've got this game being lit on fire and thrown off a roof. Now look,

[22:08] I know some of you are like, no, we can't lose a pinball machine in the world. Any pinball machine

[22:14] lost is a bad day. But I don't know. I will share the GoFundMe link on my Facebook page. I'll share

[22:20] it on Patreon. And that's it people. Like you can decide, is it worth it? Will this be the most

[22:26] amazing moment in pinball history? Or is this the worst idea ever in the history of pinball?

[22:32] I don't know everybody. I don't know man, with where pinball prices are at, if we can just get

[22:36] enough people to raise that much money, I mean, I think that's better than a Venom Pro. I don't

[22:41] know. I mean, I'd rather see that happen than buy a Venom Pro. Everybody, look, I love you guys.

[22:46] Thank you for being a club member. We're always having fun here. It's funny to me that people are

[22:50] like, oh, he's so negative. You know, the people that are negative are the people that can't stand

[22:54] back and appreciate what really matters in life. Every day I wake up early, I go to the gym. I take

[23:01] care of my beautiful son. I give my wife a kiss. I go to work. I work hard for eight hours a day to

[23:06] put food on the table. Pinball is my hobby. Like this is where we come to have fun. I don't waste

[23:12] time on pinside. I can't even post on pinside. I make a pinball podcast that people seem to enjoy

[23:18] and we're having a good time and we're not going to stop. Hashtag some baby. There are some Elton John

[23:23] C.E.s still in the box. Yeah, right, later.
