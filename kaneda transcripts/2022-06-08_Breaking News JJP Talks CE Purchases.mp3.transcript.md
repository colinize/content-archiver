[00:00] Hey, what's going on, Pinball Land?

[00:01] My name's Ken Cromwell.

[00:02] I'm the marketing and communications specialist at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:05] With our next release right around the corner, I wanted to take a moment and talk about how

[00:09] you can put yourself in the best position in acquiring one of our collector's editions.

[00:15] Many of you are going to be purchasing your collector's edition through one of our official

[00:18] distributor partners.

[00:19] But if you don't have a distributor, you can find one at the link below.

[00:22] That's jerseyjackpinball.com forward slash distributors.

[00:27] If you choose to order direct, it has to be done through our online store.

[00:31] Phone calls and emails to Jersey Jack Pinball, those aren't options in which you can place

[00:34] an order for your CE.

[00:36] In fact, when you're in our store and you add your game to your cart, it doesn't take

[00:40] it out of our inventory.

[00:41] You have to complete the entire checkout process, which is going to include giving us your United

[00:46] States shipping address, as well as your credit card information for your deposit.

[00:50] Once you do those things, you'll receive a confirmation email that lets you know that,

[00:53] hey, you've got your CE, and then you'll be contacted by a member of our sales team

[00:57] and then their future to give you a status update on your order.

[01:00] You'll also notice that I said when purchasing direct that we were going to ask for your

[01:03] United States shipping address.

[01:05] That's because direct purchases will only ship domestically within the United States.

[01:09] If you have an international shipping address, you have to reach out to one of our distributor

[01:13] partners internationally so that they can place that order for you.

[01:17] For some reason, you're in an area that you feel isn't covered by one of our distributor

[01:20] partners.

[01:21] You can go ahead and contact us direct prior to the reveal of the game to let us know.

[01:25] We can try to find somebody that will be able to get you in a position where you can

[01:28] place that order and ship to your international address.

[01:32] So hopefully this information will help you kind of streamline that process and get you

[01:35] in a better position to get that collector's edition.

[01:38] Everybody here at Jersey Jack Pinball would like to extend our sincere thank yous and

[01:41] we wish you all the best of luck.

[01:43] Ah, here's my home shipping address.

[01:50] Can I want my Toy Story collector's edition?

[01:53] Finally, we get some news.

[01:55] We get something to talk about.

[01:57] Ken Cromwell, the marketing and communication specialist over at Jersey Jack Pinball put

[02:03] up a video today, told us the collector's editions are coming soon and here's your best chance

[02:09] at getting one.

[02:11] And I've been saying it to all you crybabies who don't have a distributor relationship.

[02:17] Our best bet to buy this game is going to be buying it directly from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:24] Now I also reached out to my friends at different distributors and they each have been given

[02:31] their allotment number for this game which means this game is right around the corner.

[02:37] Are we going to see it Monday?

[02:39] Are we going to see it Tuesday?

[02:40] I bet we're going to see it when I am in Ireland.

[02:43] Why couldn't they have given me this game this week?

[02:47] So I could order it and give them my home address and I could finally get Toy Story collector's

[02:53] edition.

[02:54] But here's one, but let's talk real quickly about this video.

[02:57] It's not going to be a full show.

[02:58] I'm only going to talk about this video.

[03:00] So I want to start out by saying I really like that Ken did this video.

[03:04] Being transparent, letting people know if you want a collector's edition, here's your best

[03:09] chance.

[03:10] You have to buy it direct.

[03:11] Now for those of you out there, here's how it works when you buy direct from Jersey Jack

[03:15] Pinball.

[03:16] First come, first serve.

[03:18] So you better be ready and buy your computer when this game order bank opens up.

[03:24] So don't give us some story how your kids got a soccer match or you're washing your

[03:29] wives hair.

[03:30] Like this is it when these order banks open up.

[03:33] That's it.

[03:34] This game is going to sell out so fast.

[03:35] So if you're not ready to go, you are going to be out of luck.

[03:40] Now I hope they have their servers ready because everybody knows now, everybody knows now that

[03:45] a Jersey Jack collector's edition is going to go up in value.

[03:50] I think they are going to run out of their allotment in a matter of minutes.

[03:56] The other part is this.

[03:57] When you buy direct from Jersey Jack Pinball.com, you are paying for your game in full.

[04:02] This isn't some $1,000 deposit that then you can just sit on that deposit and sell your

[04:08] spot to someone else.

[04:09] No, your credit card will be charged the full amount of the game.

[04:15] Every distributor I talked to today, they don't know the price and they don't know how

[04:20] many collectors editions are coming out.

[04:22] So that is still a big question mark.

[04:24] We also don't know how many games Jersey Jack is going to sell directly.

[04:28] Are there going to be a thousand of them?

[04:30] So if there's a thousand, are they going to sell a hundred, 200, 250?

[04:34] But what I do know is this in speaking to distributors who got allocated 500 guns and

[04:41] roses units.

[04:42] I'm here to tell you that distributors, they got just a little bit more of toy story.

[04:49] They didn't get a lot more than guns and roses allotment.

[04:51] But also don't forget what Jersey Jack did last time.

[04:55] They sold guns and roses collectors editions directly before they allocated games to distributors.

[05:04] And that's what created the issue last time around because they kept their order banks

[05:09] open before they allotted their games to each distributor.

[05:13] They've learned from that mistake.

[05:15] Every single distributor as of today, they know exactly how many CEs they're getting.

[05:22] And so that leads me to believe that Jersey Jack is doing something like this.

[05:26] They are probably allocating 750 CEs to people out there in the distributor world.

[05:33] And I think they're probably going to hold back about 250 and sell them directly.

[05:39] Now, if you're Jersey Jack, every direct sale nets you more money.

[05:44] So I don't know, you know, they might sell 500 direct and 500 through distributors.

[05:49] It's to their financial benefit to sell the games directly.

[05:54] Distributors are still very necessary because they're not just a sales force.

[05:58] They help you if you have any issues with your games.

[06:00] Now look, obviously, if you bought a game directly and you went directly to Jersey Jack

[06:05] Pimbal, sure you could do that, but we do need Pimbal distributors.

[06:09] The other thing that I thought was really interesting was the overseas statement

[06:14] that you can't buy a game if you don't have an American address.

[06:18] So our friends in Europe, our friends in Australia, they're going to be at the mercy

[06:25] of the very few distributors that exist for overseas for Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[06:30] They don't have as many distributors.

[06:32] And I think if they're smart, these guys, come on, guys,

[06:35] you're on pin side.

[06:36] There's something called the internet.

[06:38] If I were overseas, I would be contacting my friends in the United States and say,

[06:44] hey, look, even if you don't want one, will you buy me a Jersey Jack Pimbal

[06:50] collectors edition and then air freight it to me?

[06:53] The air freight is like 1500 bucks.

[06:56] You are going to end up spending so much more money than 1500 over sticker if you

[07:02] get locked out of the initial run of these games.

[07:05] You know, but then there's also like all these import taxes.

[07:07] So I don't know, maybe you don't make much money.

[07:09] Maybe that's not a good way to go.

[07:10] But all I know is this in the great United States of America, we will get the most games.

[07:17] I think if you are by a computer when the order banks open, I think you're going

[07:22] to have a really good shot of getting this game.

[07:24] I also kind of feel like it's going to be expensive.

[07:26] I do.

[07:27] I think it's going to be like 16 five for the collectors edition.

[07:31] And I will say when you're sitting in front of your computer and it's in the cart and

[07:35] you're being pressured to check out, how often do you have something in an online

[07:40] shopping cart that is like 16 grand?

[07:43] Like most of us are not used to buying stuff this expensive.

[07:47] But trust me on this, you will not lose money on a Jersey Jack Pimbal collectors edition.

[07:54] If you are even on the fence about this game, you would be idiotic to wait because if you

[08:00] wait and then you want it, you're going to lose money.

[08:03] And if you act fast and you get one, you are going to gain money.

[08:08] I was surprised about one thing that wasn't mentioned in this video, which I thought would

[08:13] have been a golden opportunity to mention it.

[08:16] And that is this.

[08:17] We are only selling one per customer, one per customer.

[08:21] Because right now you could buy one direct.

[08:24] You can buy one from your distributor.

[08:27] And for some of these like hyper fans, they've got their name on the top of the list with

[08:33] like three or four or five distributors.

[08:35] And we see this happen.

[08:37] You see it on some of these pin side guys.

[08:39] Why is it that some of these people in the pin side marketplace always seem to have like

[08:44] three or four of every hot game for sale?

[08:48] Are we going to sell four to Bill Brandis?

[08:50] Does Bill need four toy stories?

[08:53] Does Bill need the money?

[08:54] No, he does it.

[08:55] Bill, I'm coming for you.

[08:57] I'm coming for you.

[08:58] But I think they missed a golden opportunity to say we are only selling one per customer.

[09:04] If you order direct, we are going to match up your name with your home address.

[09:10] And we are only sending the game to that name and home address.

[09:14] And if we get another order going to either that name or that home address, your order

[09:18] will be canceled if it's your second game.

[09:21] I really think they could have done that.

[09:24] But look, they don't really care, right?

[09:25] At the end of the day, they don't really care.

[09:27] We know that this is probably more of a nightmare day for them than a great day because there's

[09:33] going to be more people who want it than can get it.

[09:37] They know going into the first day of sales, they are going to disappoint thousands more

[09:43] people who want one.

[09:45] And that's not what they're in the business to do.

[09:47] They are in the business to bring people pleasure.

[09:50] So I bet if you're Jersey Jack, you are probably saying, let's just get through this day, get

[09:56] all 1000 of them allocated and make sure we don't have duplicate customers.

[10:01] And let's get on with making the games.

[10:04] Okay.

[10:05] And I bet they are praying to the playfield gods that there are no miracle issues.

[10:10] Everybody, this has been canada's quick little podcast.

[10:13] Super excited because this means toy story is right around the corner.

[10:18] Finally, we can talk about something else.

[10:21] Finally Jersey Jack pinball has some news and some momentum.

[10:25] Everybody have a great day.

[10:26] We'll talk to you soon.
