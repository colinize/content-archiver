[00:00] This is my, it's gotta go in on.

[00:04] She's all I want and I waited for so long.

[00:08] You know, just what I wanted to make this pinball podcast more positive, more energetic,

[00:21] Stern has to go and release a topper that is $1,000.

[00:26] I feel like they did it on purpose.

[00:29] They're like, can it is back guys?

[00:30] How can we really, how can we really get them to say something negative about the pinball

[00:34] industry?

[00:35] I got an idea.

[00:36] I got an idea.

[00:37] Why don't we release a topper?

[00:38] I got an idea.

[00:39] Why don't we just make a topper that looks like it's a $10 prop.

[00:42] You would put in your front yard during Halloween and let's charge $1,000 for it.

[00:47] So that happened yesterday.

[00:49] And so we're going to, let's talk about just the simple fact that now all of a sudden

[00:54] we have the most expensive pinball.

[00:57] This might be the most expensive pinball accessory of all time.

[01:01] This Elvira topper that is a gravestone.

[01:04] I think an actual gravestone is cheaper than this thing.

[01:08] I think it's actually cheaper to even die and bury yourself and have a tombstone and

[01:13] a gravestone than it is to buy this Stern topper.

[01:16] Now look, here's the thing.

[01:17] Here's the thing.

[01:18] They did this strategically on the day after they got the world super excited about

[01:26] Avengers.

[01:27] And this is the part that kind of burns me a little bit inside.

[01:30] It's like, are you really doing it the day after we fell in love with you all over again,

[01:36] Stern?

[01:37] Like you showed us this amazing game.

[01:39] You showed us Stern pinball giving us so much more for the money.

[01:43] And then the next day you go and you release the Elvira topper and immediately you remind

[01:47] us that you know what, they're probably still very greedy.

[01:51] They probably still are not going to give us what we're paying for.

[01:54] And I just think it's a weird move.

[01:55] It's a really weird move to do this, but it wasn't just the thousand dollars for the

[02:00] Elvira topper that they announced to.

[02:03] The Avengers topper is also six hundred dollars.

[02:08] And so will the Ninja Turtles topper be six hundred dollars.

[02:13] Now look, we've had topper gate as a topic in 2020.

[02:17] We've talked about it too many times at length.

[02:20] And the bottom line is this nobody needs a topper.

[02:24] Like no games really need a topper or require a topper.

[02:28] We see what they're doing.

[02:29] We see what they're doing with the Jurassic Park topper where they want to have a mode

[02:34] that you can only access if you get the topper.

[02:38] And so they're holding back some of the gameplay features if you don't buy the topper.

[02:44] So then that creates a dilemma for people who love these games that if they want the entire

[02:49] gameplay experience, then you need to buy some of these topper.

[02:52] So all of a sudden Stern is made it so toppers aren't just these vanity things that sit

[02:58] on top of a machine, but they also are required for unlocking the full potential of these expensive

[03:06] toys that you're spending a lot of money on.

[03:08] And that's what rubs people the wrong way.

[03:11] And so when we look at the Elvira topper, you know, they're trying to get around this

[03:15] thousand dollar price because they're saying they're only going to make two hundred of them.

[03:20] And I also hear that it will come with an exclusive mode or some sort of exclusive code

[03:26] element that will be in the game.

[03:28] Now here's the thing.

[03:29] Here's the thing.

[03:30] On pure material cost alone, this is where it's getting comical.

[03:35] Like just comical.

[03:37] These things are not even that well sculpted.

[03:40] They don't look like they're that expensive.

[03:42] There's not much detail.

[03:43] I spoke to my good friend who's making over in Israel who's making some of the most amazing

[03:48] sculpts leor about this thing.

[03:51] And you know, he takes one look at this stuff and he's like, Chris, like this stuff is

[03:54] really cheap to make.

[03:56] Like it's not even that well done.

[03:59] And he kind of just like shrugs his shoulders.

[04:01] And you should see, you should see the stuff this guy is working on.

[04:06] Where do you see the next topper from this gentleman?

[04:09] I mean, I took one look at it.

[04:11] And yes, I'll tell you right now, his topper exceeds a thousand dollars.

[04:17] But I mean, it is worth it what he's putting on this machine.

[04:22] And obviously he's going for a very rich, exclusive clientele with his stuff.

[04:26] But you know, when we look at this stern topper, a thousand bucks, I'm almost more like upset

[04:32] about the plastic toppers and avengers being $600 dollars.

[04:37] Like Jurassic Park, we saw it too.

[04:39] The cost of a sheet of plastic and the cost to have a few LED lights on these things.

[04:46] I mean, I'm not even joking when I say the bill of materials on these toppers are probably

[04:53] around 30 to 50 bucks, 30 to 50 bucks, and they're charging $600 dollars.

[05:01] I mean, that's what the new PlayStation 5 is going to cost.

[05:05] When I first got the image, when someone first sent me the image, I said to myself, this

[05:08] has to be a joke.

[05:09] Like someone's just messing with me.

[05:11] This has to be Photoshop.

[05:13] There's no way this is real.

[05:14] There's no way Stern is going to release $8,000 topper, but it was confirmed to be real.

[05:20] And the first thing that popped into my head was, you know what, good for them.

[05:24] Like good for Stern Pimble because this company was able to sell 50 people out there in El

[05:31] Vira that had nothing more than a little one inch square piece of couch for $15,000.

[05:38] So you know what, if dummies are going to buy that for $15,000, then what's another

[05:45] grand to put a topper on top of your signature edition El Vira?

[05:50] Now, if you ask me, if someone spent 15K for El Vira SLE, they should have got the topper

[05:58] included, right?

[05:59] When people bought the Batman SLEs, they got the topper included.

[06:04] When people bought Batman Ellie, which was much cheaper than the SLE, they got the topper

[06:10] included.

[06:11] Did you see someone on Pinside is selling?

[06:14] They're selling just the topper from a Batman SLE.

[06:17] I don't know how they got this.

[06:19] Like, I don't know who owns a Batman SLE that part it weighs with their topper because

[06:24] I'm not even joking when I say this.

[06:26] If you gave up your SLE topper on Batman, your game just lost way more value than you'd

[06:32] like to know.

[06:33] I wouldn't even, who'd want one?

[06:35] Who would want a Batman SLE with no topper because that is like the coolest topper

[06:39] Stern's ever made.

[06:41] They're selling the Batman SLE topper for $1,600 and like $50, $1,600.

[06:49] There's just certain elements to things.

[06:52] Things need, some things need to just go together, right?

[06:55] Like Batman SLE needs to go with that topper.

[06:58] And that's the weird part.

[06:59] So let me give you an analogy.

[07:00] I'm going to use a car analogy, right?

[07:03] Imagine buying a brand new C8 Corvette, all right?

[07:07] Imagine buying a brand new C8 Corvette and Corvette and Chevrolet gives it to you with only

[07:12] one door on the car.

[07:14] How much could they then charge you for the next door to complete the car and the look

[07:20] of the car?

[07:21] And I think that's what's going on with some of these toppers is it completes the look

[07:25] that they know people want in the game.

[07:27] And so like the sky's the limit on what they're going to charge you for these things.

[07:33] And so if you're going to spend 15K and get nothing for your money, I think Stern's

[07:37] looking at it like these guys will spend 16K.

[07:40] And the same is true with the LEs, like everyone ran out in one day.

[07:44] And I know why they did it because it's an amazing game and bought a $9,200 Avengers.

[07:50] So if I'm Stern, I'm thinking to myself, all right, well these guys just spent $9,200

[07:55] bucks on a game they've never played on a game they've never flipped on a game they've

[08:01] just seen in one hour.

[08:02] So if they have $9,200 of disposable income to spend on a pinball machine, guess what

[08:10] else they have?

[08:11] $9,800.

[08:12] So let's add the topper additional for $600.

[08:17] And guess what?

[08:18] They're going to sell those toppers.

[08:19] I think that's what annoys people is that even though these prices have people so upset,

[08:25] they're going to sell them and you're going to see them on top of games.

[08:30] Now will they sell 200 limited edition L-virus toppers at $1,000?

[08:37] And I think the answer to that, I don't think they will.

[08:40] I really don't.

[08:41] I really don't think they're going to sell that many at that price.

[08:44] I think you're going to see distributors probably mark them down in a few months when

[08:49] they're not moving off the shelves.

[08:51] I just think there's a line.

[08:53] And I think there's a line that people will draw and say that, you know, just that's

[08:57] just too much for that.

[08:59] And because what Stern doesn't want to do is this.

[09:01] And here's the problem with what they're doing.

[09:03] When you got a Batman and you got a Batman Ellie and an S-L-E, you felt very awesome.

[09:09] You felt very special and you were proud to show your game to the community.

[09:15] And when people say, I got an Ellie or an S-L-E and look, more so the Ellie guys, right?

[09:20] Because people made fun of the S-L-E, people begging to buy the game.

[09:23] But my point is this, when you got that Batman Ellie and you shared it with the community

[09:29] collectively, everyone was in awe of how beautiful the game was.

[09:33] And they congratulated you on having a Batman Ellie with that beautiful topper.

[09:39] The problem now is when you are someone who shares that you just have an Elvira with

[09:45] the topper on it, everyone's going to make fun of you for spending $1,000 on the topper,

[09:52] right?

[09:53] You don't want to feel like a chump when you outfit your pinball machine.

[09:57] And I think that's the problem Stern doesn't realize is that people don't feel good about

[10:04] sharing this stuff with the community.

[10:06] And that to me is weird.

[10:07] It's like everyone should feel really good about their games and how they're accessorized.

[10:12] But when you spend $1,000 extra on something that looks like it's $10.

[10:17] That's the other part.

[10:18] It looks so cheap.

[10:19] It just makes people feel like, I don't really want to share this because people are going

[10:23] to make fun of me.

[10:24] And you know what?

[10:25] They probably should make fun of you.

[10:27] And the other thing that I just spent $1,000 on that was a total vanity play is the

[10:32] Rick and Morty Butter Cabinet.

[10:33] Now look, you go and you look at the process by which they make the Rick and Morty Butter

[10:38] Cabinet.

[10:39] And I guarantee you more money, more time, more effort goes into making that Rick and Morty

[10:45] Butter Cabinet special.

[10:47] And you pay for it.

[10:48] But I guarantee I'd rather spend $1,000 on the butter than I would on a topper.

[10:55] All right.

[10:56] So that's just me.

[10:57] Look, at the end of the day, Stern is going to keep doing this.

[10:59] The next thing we're going to see is this.

[11:01] The next thing, it's coming people.

[11:03] Everyone doesn't realize this, but it's coming.

[11:05] It's backwards compatible in all of these new games.

[11:08] Think about it.

[11:09] Avengers.

[11:10] Avengers assemble.

[11:11] Ninja Turtles.

[11:13] All these games are set up perfectly for something that is coming around the corner.

[11:17] And you guess what it is?

[11:19] It's co-op play.

[11:21] It's internet co-op play.

[11:23] It's coming people.

[11:24] It is coming.

[11:25] It works with Spike too.

[11:26] It's engineered into all these games.

[11:29] Stern just hasn't flipped the switch yet.

[11:31] They are very wisely.

[11:33] They are very wisely building up a ginormous user base of people who have these games, turtles,

[11:41] Avengers.

[11:42] And then one day, they're going to say, if you want to connect your games with your friends

[11:46] games, you're going to be able to, but you're going to have to spend money.

[11:50] Now I don't know what it's going to be.

[11:51] Is it going to be $20 a month?

[11:53] Is it going to be $100 a year?

[11:55] Whatever it is, whatever it is, all of this, all of these moves are doing, are testing

[12:01] the marketplace to see what people will spend on their games.

[12:05] So look, I can already hear the other argument.

[12:06] Like Chris, if people want to put this $1,000 top on their game and it makes them happy,

[12:11] let them do it.

[12:12] Absolutely.

[12:13] I don't care.

[12:14] It's not my, it's not my money.

[12:15] I don't even have this game.

[12:16] I don't think that many people have Elvira.

[12:19] It's not for everybody.

[12:20] I do think that those people are special.

[12:23] Those people are like, you know, just obsessed with Elvira and everything she does.

[12:27] It's not me.

[12:28] It's not been a theme for me.

[12:29] I flipped the game.

[12:30] It's a lineman game.

[12:31] So of course, it's going to be a really good game.

[12:34] But I think Elvira feels a lot like yesterday's news.

[12:37] So for Stern to come out with this toper yesterday, it's not relevant today, especially in the

[12:43] wake of Avengers.

[12:44] I do think that the tide has shifted.

[12:47] Like people are now all in on Avengers and we've moved past games like Stranger Things

[12:53] and Elvira and even Ninja Turtles.

[12:56] It's crazy how quickly Stern can change the narrative on the entire industry.

[13:01] Like hype just dies immediately on the last title.

[13:06] If the new title has people more excited.

[13:08] Everyone is more excited for Avengers than Ninja Turtles.

[13:11] I'm hearing a lot in the Ninja Turtles world that the game's too hard.

[13:16] Email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[13:18] I want to hear from someone who's playing Ninja Turtles who feels it's just too hard.

[13:23] That's unfortunate because I think what I'm hearing from people is it's a very casual

[13:27] theme that everyone is giddy about.

[13:30] But then you play the game and it's brutal.

[13:32] And unfortunately, that can really sour people's enjoyment of the game.

[13:37] So I'm wondering, is it the brutal nature of the game that's making a lot of these Ninja

[13:41] Turtles pop up for sale?

[13:43] Is it Avengers?

[13:44] Is it the mech issues?

[13:46] I don't know what it is, but Ninja Turtles was like a really quick burst.

[13:50] Like everyone went in and got excited.

[13:52] A lot of people bought the games.

[13:54] The Ellie sold out really quickly.

[13:56] And then immediately you start to see them pop up for sale.

[13:59] I don't think we're going to see that with Avengers.

[14:01] Avengers looks like a game that they sold out in day one.

[14:04] And I don't think people are going to let this out of their collections very quickly.

[14:07] I think the premium guys are going to redo the armor with purple or yellow or whatever.

[14:12] And I think this game is going to be a really celebrated game in the Stern Library.

[14:16] And I'm really excited to play it.

[14:17] I can't wait to play it.

[14:18] Alright, let's talk about Rick and Morty.

[14:20] It's been in my bedroom now for many months.

[14:22] I think like six months.

[14:24] And I want to talk about what it's like owning Rick and Morty.

[14:27] And there's not a lot of people that can talk about owning Rick and Morty because not

[14:31] a lot of people own Rick and Morty yet.

[14:33] I think they're on number 170.

[14:37] And for some reason, we all knew what we were getting into when we ordered Rick and Morty

[14:41] games.

[14:42] Right?

[14:43] But I think in reality, the weight for this game for a lot of people feels longer than they

[14:49] thought it would.

[14:50] You know, it kind of, it's like, it's like when you buy a house and you, you're so excited

[14:54] to get the house, you don't really think about the 30 year part of it, of paying for it.

[15:00] This is the reverse, right?

[15:01] You paid for it right away.

[15:03] And it feels like you're waiting 30 years just to get the house, just to get the game.

[15:07] I mean, there are number 170 and they have a long way to go to number 750.

[15:12] I think on the very surface of that reality, I do think spooky pimple needs to figure

[15:18] out a solution.

[15:19] This, this just doesn't really work.

[15:21] It doesn't really work.

[15:22] It works perfectly well for them.

[15:25] They collected all that money like three million bucks.

[15:28] It was smart.

[15:29] It was so smart.

[15:30] It was the best move Chuck could have done.

[15:31] It was so super smart.

[15:33] I mean, he did it right before COVID hit two.

[15:35] So his company for the next two years is okay.

[15:39] Like they've already sold everything they can make.

[15:41] The problem is, the problem is now the company's frozen in one title for two years while

[15:48] everyone else continues to create new excitement, new hype and you kind of get left behind

[15:54] a little bit.

[15:55] And I don't think this was the best way to do it.

[15:59] And I know why he did it.

[16:00] He didn't want to staff up.

[16:01] He didn't want to bring more production in house.

[16:03] He didn't want to do this.

[16:04] He didn't want to do that.

[16:05] And I get it.

[16:06] But the problem is, when you're a business owner, I think you do have to sort of juggle consumer

[16:12] satisfaction with company reality.

[16:15] And you have to find a middle ground.

[16:18] And I don't think waiting 18 months to make one title is really going to work ever again

[16:25] in the pimple where like people are not going to do it.

[16:27] Like people are not going to run to it.

[16:28] Regardless of the theme, I just don't think this kind of weight is working for a lot of

[16:32] people.

[16:33] And I say that because I talk to people who are like number 200 and 300 who are really

[16:38] struggling with the weight, like really struggling being like, oh, if I could go back now, I wouldn't

[16:44] have given them my money.

[16:45] I would have gone in on Avengers.

[16:47] And they're kind of like bummed out.

[16:49] They're not going in on some of these newer games because they're already locked in non

[16:53] refundable deposit to Rick and Morty.

[16:55] Now look, we all know if you want to sell your Rick and Morty spot for the first time,

[16:58] for what you paid for it, you will immediately have a buyer.

[17:01] So if any of you out there are like, I want to get something else.

[17:05] You know, you can't really blame spooky.

[17:08] You can easily swap your spot tomorrow.

[17:10] And someone would easily pay the 1500 bucks you paid for the blood suckers to get your

[17:15] spot.

[17:16] Spooky has a waiting list, a mile long to get in on the game.

[17:20] So it's good news that the demand far exceeds the supply of this game.

[17:24] And hey, it came with a free topper.

[17:26] So no thousand dollar topper required.

[17:28] So let me give you my feedback on Rick and Morty for you.

[17:31] Those of you out there who are waiting for the game, if you want me to tell you right

[17:35] now, just just blank it right now, is this game worth the two year wait or the 18 month

[17:40] wait?

[17:41] Is it worth the hype?

[17:42] I mean, people are spending over $11,000 to get one second hand.

[17:47] Is this game worth the entire hysteria surrounding it?

[17:51] What is Knai to think about Rick and Morty after playing it like 300 games and having

[17:54] it here for a few months and having the latest code and all this stuff?

[17:58] What are my overall feelings on Rick and Morty?

[18:01] I'm going to start with my overall feeling.

[18:03] If it's worth up to all this like this hype and frenzy around the title, the answer is

[18:08] kind of, but not really.

[18:11] And I mean that I mean this game is really fun.

[18:13] This game is different.

[18:15] It's fast.

[18:16] It does a lot of unique things that I find enjoyable, but I just don't when I see people spending

[18:21] above $10,000 on Rick and Morty's when I see people spending, you know, way way more

[18:26] than it's worth.

[18:27] That's where I'm like this game.

[18:29] I'm just going to say I think this is a great $7,000 game.

[18:33] I do.

[18:34] In terms of like what you get for your money, I think it's an amazing $7,000 game.

[18:38] $8,000 maybe.

[18:39] Out the door, I was $9,500 bucks on this game when I stand over Rick and Morty Pimble.

[18:47] I just can't see why this game is $9,500.

[18:51] And I know I have the butter cabinet.

[18:53] I know I have the thout.

[18:54] I can't see $8,500 in the game.

[18:57] And I do this.

[18:58] I will associate what you pay for it and what else you could get for your money for $8,500.

[19:04] Right.

[19:05] And again, like I paid $9,500 bucks.

[19:07] So I could put this game right next to an Avengers Ellie and I could save money if I bought

[19:13] the Avengers Ellie.

[19:15] And I'm just here to say like it is night and day how much more is going into the stern

[19:21] game versus the spooky game.

[19:24] So I'm just a pure like do I feel like I got my money's worth on this game.

[19:29] The answer is like I can't say no because like it's still hold its value.

[19:33] So yeah, because of the rarity, I just think my overall assessment after playing the game

[19:37] is there's just not a ton in it.

[19:39] So let me just go over like the good, the bad and if there's any ugly in the game that

[19:43] I want to talk about.

[19:44] So here are the good parts and it's the stuff you know.

[19:46] I mean the code and the theme integration and the call outs are incredible.

[19:52] This game has one of the best sound systems in Pimble.

[19:56] But here's a caveat with that.

[19:57] When you crank this game up, when you crank the game up and you blast it loud, which is

[20:02] what you want to do with the Scott and E C sound system in game, the game rattles a

[20:06] lot.

[20:07] And I mean, there's like, there's rattling in it.

[20:09] I mean, not just the glass, but there's just that it just rattles.

[20:12] And so I did turn down my base, but I think you know, in the future, spooky's got to

[20:17] know that people are going to crank these things up.

[20:19] And I think they have to go through and see where the rattles coming from that we can

[20:23] maybe tighten up.

[20:24] And I'm not sure like how to exactly do that on my machine.

[20:27] But good news for me is because I live in a New York City apartment, I don't blast this

[20:32] machine.

[20:33] I can't.

[20:34] It'll make too much noise.

[20:35] And even when the game starts to shake, I have to turn my shaker motor off because the

[20:38] woman below me would complain.

[20:39] But the sound system is phenomenal.

[20:41] Okay, now for those of you out there who are getting your machines, the monitor swap that

[20:46] I did, I put a better monitor in or LCD screen in it.

[20:49] It's so much better.

[20:50] It's so much better.

[20:51] I saw the one at Jack Bargan.

[20:52] It mine is so much better.

[20:54] People are still, I still read this.

[20:56] People are still thinking that I'm making this up that when you swap out the LCD for a better

[21:02] one, the image is so much better.

[21:04] The contrast is so much better.

[21:06] I don't know why people are upset with me for saying that.

[21:09] TNA owners did the same thing and had the same improvement.

[21:13] And that's all I did.

[21:14] These are the same parts.

[21:15] It was the same LCD they used in TNA that they used in Rick and Morty.

[21:19] So why would the swap not also improve the Rick and Morty display?

[21:23] And I don't understand.

[21:24] It's like this desire to defend spooky at all costs and every move they make, I don't

[21:30] get it.

[21:31] They know it too.

[21:32] I mean, again, when you pull out that LCD and you put in the new one, you'll see it's

[21:37] twice as thick.

[21:38] The new LCD I put in.

[21:39] And it only costs like 60 bucks.

[21:41] You need a driver board.

[21:42] The whole thing was like a hundred dollars and I think it was totally worth it.

[21:45] The animations are great.

[21:46] Well, I love the most about Rick and Morty is this.

[21:48] What I love about playing this game is that it's simple to understand.

[21:52] It really is a straightforward game.

[21:54] It's the kind of game where you can walk up to it with a friend, a wife, a girlfriend,

[21:58] some buddies.

[21:59] And you can explain to someone immediately, here's what we're doing in the game.

[22:03] You play as Morty, you're going on the adventures.

[22:06] Here's how you start an adventure.

[22:08] And when the adventure starts, it's really easy to just shoot what's blinking.

[22:11] I mean, on a very fundamental level, I love the simpleness and how approachable it is

[22:18] to play Rick and Morty Pimbal.

[22:19] And that is important to me.

[22:21] You know that.

[22:22] It is important to me that you don't walk up to a game and you have to head scratch.

[22:28] And then when they start explaining this and multipliers and all that stuff, like sometimes

[22:32] when I hear rule sets in Pimbal machines, and I just don't even want to listen, right?

[22:38] So the game is very approachable.

[22:39] I love the fact that the game is super fast.

[22:43] I do.

[22:44] It's a game where like you're not going to sit there with half hour games.

[22:48] You can play Rick and Morty for 15 minutes.

[22:50] You can get into it.

[22:51] You can start some adventures.

[22:52] You can have some fun.

[22:54] You can chase your high score.

[22:55] And you're not going to be on the machine all day long.

[22:58] Okay.

[22:59] So it's not the game itself for me has been pretty problem free.

[23:02] Other than the initial things I had to do, which were adjust the scoop, which by the

[23:06] way, I saw that spooky from the factory is now adding washers to the scoop.

[23:11] So let's just do a little bit of like a roll call.

[23:14] It was Kaneda talking to Scott Dinesi that got them to remove the screws from the upper

[23:19] orbit shot.

[23:20] It was Kaneda that got spooky Pimbal to send every owner new decals for the game because

[23:25] we talked about it.

[23:26] It was Kaneda that talked a lot about putting washers underneath the center scoop to improve

[23:32] the scoop not rejecting the ball.

[23:34] So let's just for all those out there who would say like, Kaneda does nothing good for

[23:37] Bimbal.

[23:38] I mean, come on.

[23:39] These are the three things that we harped on.

[23:41] And it's great to know that spooky Pimbal has listened and fixed those three things.

[23:44] So I haven't had really many issues with the game.

[23:47] Some quirky things that you'll notice that I noticed the screw on the left ramp near

[23:53] the entrance sort of sticks up a little bit.

[23:56] And sometimes the ball catches that screw and just like jumps way out of the ramp.

[24:01] Like it'll jump up and hit the glass sometimes.

[24:04] So that is something that you want to look out for.

[24:06] Something else that happens like every once in a while, sometimes like the flippers just

[24:10] have a lifer of their own.

[24:11] Like sometimes the right flipper will just stick up and that can be a little annoying,

[24:15] but it doesn't persist.

[24:16] So you know, it's a look.

[24:17] It's an electronical device.

[24:19] So I it rarely happens.

[24:21] So I don't chalk that up as like a consistent problem with the game.

[24:24] So other than that, I haven't really had any issues.

[24:27] I've had no software issues.

[24:28] The game hasn't crashed.

[24:30] The game's been working perfectly.

[24:32] So I will say that like over 300 games out of box, my spooky Pimbal experience has been

[24:38] a really good one.

[24:40] So I just want to like all of you out there know that that I've had absolutely no headaches

[24:44] owning this game ever.

[24:46] So that has been great.

[24:47] Now, what is it like owning it?

[24:49] Am I going to keep it?

[24:50] Am I enjoying it enough to keep it?

[24:51] Now, I'll say this.

[24:53] I don't know.

[24:54] I don't know.

[24:55] I really find it fun.

[24:56] Here's what the game really needs.

[24:57] And I'm just going to say it.

[24:58] I'm just going to say this game needs a ton more adventures.

[25:01] It needs a ton more.

[25:03] The adventures are where this game shines because there's not a lot of mechanical stuff

[25:08] in the game and the game really comes to life through the code.

[25:12] This game is all about code and adventures and dimensions.

[25:16] And that's when it wakes up and that's when it grabs you.

[25:19] And that's when it makes you laugh and that's when it engages you the most.

[25:23] The game just needs a ton more adventures because after a half hour of playing Rick and

[25:28] Morty, you'll most likely see every single adventure in the game.

[25:33] If the goal's to fill up Morty's adventure card and you've seen every adventure and

[25:38] once you hit nine adventures, you don't get to any wizard mode.

[25:44] You don't get to any new thing that you're chasing.

[25:47] And I think for me, that's kind of a problem in the game.

[25:50] And let me explain why.

[25:51] If everything is randomized and you might randomly see everything, then what am I playing for?

[25:57] Then I'm just playing for score.

[25:59] And I'm not sure it's that kind of game where I want to just play for score being the objective.

[26:05] And I think they need to revisit that strategy.

[26:08] I really do think they need to make it so certain adventures are selectable only after

[26:16] you get to the nine on the adventure card because then otherwise what's the point?

[26:22] What's the point?

[26:23] You're just going to play the same adventure over again.

[26:25] Like this game needs some sort of like there and back again kind of wizard mode.

[26:30] It needs something.

[26:32] It just needs a wizard mode or some wizard modes in which you feel like you're getting to

[26:37] something that's different and new.

[26:40] And right now, I'm not sure that's the direction they're taking with the game.

[26:44] Have I filled out all nine adventures on the card I haven't?

[26:47] Like it's tough.

[26:48] This isn't easy.

[26:49] And of course, of course you can set your game so you can have more adventures completed

[26:54] when you start the game.

[26:55] But the game is really hard.

[26:56] I actually made my game a little bit easier.

[26:58] I'll tell you what I did.

[26:59] When I first got the game, you had to hit both ramps to start an adventure.

[27:04] And I think the first time it was one ramp and the second time you had to hit both ramps

[27:07] every time to light the adventure light.

[27:10] That was too hard because hitting that left ramp is really difficult.

[27:13] So I made it so that you only have to hit a ramp once to light adventure.

[27:19] And I just find that way more enjoyable.

[27:22] I think in the newer code updates, they've actually made it that way where you only have

[27:26] to hit the ramp once.

[27:27] So this game just needs a ton more adventures.

[27:29] And I think for early buyers of this game, you're going to play it a bunch.

[27:33] You're going to enjoy it.

[27:35] But you're going to reach a point in which you're like, this game needs a lot more of this.

[27:38] People are going to be like, I love what you're serving us, but we just need a lot more

[27:41] of it.

[27:42] It's a lot more adventures.

[27:44] And here's the thing, it's coming.

[27:46] Like they're going to keep putting adventures in.

[27:49] I mean, ostensibly, every single Rick and Morty episode that's aired.

[27:54] And there's not a ton of them.

[27:55] I think what if there's like eight or nine a season or ten a season and there's four

[27:59] seasons, let's say there's 40 episodes of Rick and Morty, every single episode is an

[28:05] adventure.

[28:06] So I think for this game to sort of have enough to keep you coming back over and over and

[28:12] over again to own it for a long time, I think this game is going to need at least 20

[28:17] adventures, at least 20, which sounds like a lot of coding, but really they don't have

[28:22] to animate much.

[28:23] I mean, the animation's already done.

[28:25] So then you're really just thinking about sound effects and call outs and lights to go

[28:29] with those adventures.

[28:30] So I really think this game just needs a lot more adventures.

[28:33] The other thing that I wish this game would do because the other thing that makes it really

[28:36] fun is when you combine an adventure with going into a dimension.

[28:41] And to me, that's really where this game shines is when you're in an adventure and then

[28:45] you go into a new dimension and that dimension sort of starts to take over the game.

[28:50] I think that is my favorite part of this game is the creative potential of what can be going

[28:55] on in all these different dimensions.

[28:57] I mean, there's one where it makes a farting noise.

[29:00] There's another one where it's just someone screaming.

[29:02] There's another where it's like weird music.

[29:04] It's super cool that dimensions can sort of make the game do all this weird stuff.

[29:09] But here's my thing.

[29:10] Here's my thing.

[29:11] And I know they listen to this show and I'm talking to the coder and Scott listen.

[29:16] They need to make these dimensions more creatively weird and they're really cool right now.

[29:22] But what I mean is I want to go into dimensions that really do like crazy stuff.

[29:28] And I think they need to sort of push the envelope of how wacky they can make these

[29:34] dimensions.

[29:35] You know what I'm saying?

[29:36] I just feel like they all start to blend together a little bit and I think they can just

[29:40] go crazy.

[29:41] Like in this dimension, like the left flippers broken or this dimension, like just do weird

[29:45] stuff and you can have dimensions in which they time out.

[29:48] It's not like you're going to lose your ball but make the game go crazy.

[29:52] Dimensions in this game are spooky pinball's opportunity to create pinball moments and you

[29:57] know me.

[29:58] I want pinball moments.

[29:59] I want the machine to do stuff that's just crazy.

[30:02] I want it to be like when you destroy the ring and lower the rings, I want this game to

[30:06] go haywire and do wacky stuff.

[30:09] And right now none of the dimensions really feel like they do that.

[30:13] And so they're fun.

[30:14] Don't get me wrong.

[30:15] They really are fun.

[30:16] They make you laugh.

[30:17] But again, after you play them, I want to see the dimensions activate more things physically

[30:22] with what's in the game.

[30:23] Now here's the challenge, right?

[30:25] It is there's not a lot physically happening in this game.

[30:29] You know, if I were to tell you like what's my one big reason why I would sell Rick and

[30:33] Morty is I just like more toys in a game.

[30:36] I like more things that make you go wow.

[30:39] And I talked about it in my last podcast was when you stand over adventures, you're like

[30:43] look at all this stuff.

[30:45] I can't wait to see how that all works.

[30:47] When you stand over Rick and Morty, you don't get that like how does this all work.

[30:52] There's really not much that's working mechanically in the game.

[30:57] You've got the portal in the garage.

[30:59] But here's the thing like you just don't get the sensation of the balls really going through

[31:04] a portal.

[31:05] It always comes out the same place.

[31:07] And in the show what makes the portal so much fun is you never know where they're going

[31:12] to come out next.

[31:13] And so I do think that it would have been so cool.

[31:16] This game's like just dying for a subway system in which you're not quite sure which

[31:20] way it's going to pop out.

[31:22] And the fact that it only pops out the same place every single time sort of removes like

[31:27] the wow factor from that.

[31:29] And so I do wish this game had a little bit a lot of it.

[31:33] I got to be honest, a lot of it more of mechanical wow in the game.

[31:38] I mean, I would say it's a little bit like TNA with ramps.

[31:42] I mean, there's a lot of the parts are the same from TNA.

[31:45] It's very simple with what's going on in the game mechanically.

[31:48] Now of course, if you lift it up, I mean, the lights are amazing.

[31:50] The LEDs are amazing.

[31:53] Like the light show, the sound show, all that's amazing.

[31:56] But if you were to ask me the next thing I think spooky needs to do again to compete

[32:01] again, I paid 9500 bucks for this game.

[32:04] Right.

[32:05] This isn't like a cheap game anymore.

[32:06] These aren't $6,000 spooky machines for spooky pinball to really compete.

[32:10] I think in just in terms of like they're offering with what Scott Denise is putting in

[32:16] his games and what Keith L. when is putting in his games and Eric is putting in his games

[32:20] and what John Borg puts in his games.

[32:21] I think Scott Denise and spooky pinball and Chuck and company, I think they need to put

[32:26] more into these games mechanically.

[32:28] I think they need to figure out a way to engineer more mechanically.

[32:32] I mean, a lot of these parts almost all of the game is off the shelf parts from pinball

[32:37] life.

[32:38] Like not a lot of this game is engineered.

[32:40] Like it's just, all right, we have this thing.

[32:42] We have drop target to does this.

[32:43] We have optos.

[32:44] We'll make it do this.

[32:45] And so I think you get, you know, after a while, I think they have to push

[32:50] the creativity further mechanically with this game and these games and they could have,

[32:55] right?

[32:56] And I always say this to people like in back channels, if Stern Pinball released Rick and

[33:01] Morty with this layout and these mechanics, you guys would have mowned and groaned non-stop

[33:10] if this was Stern Pinball's Rick and Morty offering.

[33:12] And because spooky gave it to us, everyone cheerleaded it.

[33:16] And I know like it's a double standard.

[33:18] It's a double standard.

[33:19] On this show, if I'm going to hold manufacturers accountable, I have to look at them all equally.

[33:25] And I will say that, you know, this is a great $6000 to $7000 machine.

[33:30] It looks like it's got the kind of features a Stern Pro would have.

[33:34] At $9500, it's not worth it for $9500.

[33:40] And for those of you spending $12,000 plus on one, I think you're kind of out of your

[33:44] minds.

[33:45] And again, money might not mean anything to you.

[33:48] But for that kind of money, you should just have a lot more in your game.

[33:52] And I think Robert Mueller is looking at Rick and Morty right now.

[33:55] And I think he's looking at what people are spending on Rick and Morty right now.

[33:58] I think he's looking at what's in Rick and Morty right now.

[34:02] And I think he's going to see that, wait, these guys are spending this much money on Rick

[34:06] and Morty that has hardly anything mechanically in it.

[34:09] And I'm putting all this stuff in Raza.

[34:11] Raza is going to be priced higher than that.

[34:14] The thing is, you know, what's the value of the franchise?

[34:18] And that's worth everything.

[34:19] I mean, everything, if you removed Rick and Morty from this game and just had this game

[34:23] as a white wood and made it like a generic theme, people wouldn't spend $6,000 on it.

[34:30] Like they, you know what I'm saying?

[34:31] Like it's the value of Rick and Morty is obviously in Rick and Morty.

[34:34] It's just a stupid argument to even think about it as not Rick and Morty because it is

[34:38] Rick and Morty, right?

[34:39] And so this game to me, if I were to give it a grade, I think the game is beautiful.

[34:43] I think it sounds amazing.

[34:45] I think the Butter Cabinet is so worth the money.

[34:47] For those of you on the fence about Butter Cabinet, forget it.

[34:50] Like everyone who opens up their Butter Cabinet, it's worth it.

[34:53] It looks so good.

[34:55] I love looking at this game.

[34:57] The sound system's great.

[34:58] The game looks great.

[34:58] The game is fun.

[34:59] The game is fast.

[35:00] I think it's the perfect game for people who have like deep collections because of how fast

[35:05] the gameplay is.

[35:06] I really do.

[35:07] The game shoots not that great.

[35:10] The game is not the best shooter.

[35:12] It is still clunky.

[35:13] It is still hard to hit a lot of the shots.

[35:15] When multi-ball is going, you brick more than you hit.

[35:20] It is not an easy game to find some of these shots.

[35:22] And some of those shots are required to get to the fun stuff.

[35:26] So you are going to be frustrated with Rick and Morty if you're not the best pinball player.

[35:30] There's a lot of apologists in the spooky camp who will just tell you to play better.

[35:35] But it could have been designed smoother.

[35:37] It should have been designed smoother.

[35:39] And I think when Scott does his next game, he's going to realize that.

[35:43] There was no need to design a game that lives for the tears of pinball players.

[35:48] No.

[35:49] There's something to be said about smoothness in pinball.

[35:53] You can still make the game hard, but the shots should be smoother.

[35:56] And there is no enjoyment in hearing rattles and clunks and doinks and not being able

[36:03] to combo a lot because of that.

[36:05] I really do think if this game allowed you to combo more, it would be even more.

[36:09] It's more fun to shoot because it's so fun to hear the stuff.

[36:13] It's so fun to see the stuff.

[36:15] It's just not fun to shoot everything in it because of the things I just mentioned.

[36:20] And so my overall score, it's an A plus theme for pinball.

[36:24] A package in terms of aesthetics.

[36:26] I think the game just looks so good.

[36:27] It just looks so damn nice.

[36:29] It's a clunky shooter.

[36:31] It's a clunky shooter.

[36:32] It's got a great light show this and that.

[36:35] If I were to give Rick and Morty an overall score, I think this game for me is like

[36:39] a B. It's like a B. It's not the greatest game.

[36:43] It's very fun, but it's like a B. It's a really good game.

[36:47] It's not a great game.

[36:49] It's not a bad game.

[36:51] You will enjoy it if you like this theme, but you're going to have to live with some of

[36:55] the quirkiness of the shots and the geometry and the layout and the lack of toys and the

[37:00] lack of wow.

[37:01] And my biggest fear, if I were to say it, my biggest fear is eventually when all these

[37:07] clips get old and all the callouts get old, will the game get old for people?

[37:12] And I think the opportunity here is that these guys can code this game so that it never

[37:17] gets old.

[37:18] If I had one wish, it's that they make these dimensions do wackier things.

[37:22] Make the dimensions really get crazy, guys.

[37:25] I really think you need to push the envelope of the dimensions.

[37:28] I think you need to have a dimension in which the game turns on and off.

[37:31] Like whatever.

[37:32] Maybe that's not the best way.

[37:33] You know what I'm saying?

[37:34] You can make a dimension where the screen goes black.

[37:36] So you have no idea what your score isn't until the demand and you come out of the dimension.

[37:39] Like, and the other thing I wish they did with dimensions, the dimensions should have callouts.

[37:44] If you're working with Justin, you go into this dimension and there's, you have no idea

[37:48] in the show whenever they go into a dimension or whenever Rick travels, he usually explains

[37:53] like where they are and what they're there to do.

[37:55] I think they need Rick to do callouts.

[37:57] It's like, Morty, in this dimension, the ramps aren't worth crap.

[38:00] So don't hit any of these damn ramps Morty.

[38:02] Morty, in this dimension, like, you know, I just ate a bunch of beans.

[38:04] So you might hear me, let one rip and then it's all the farts.

[38:07] You know what I'm saying?

[38:08] There's no callouts.

[38:09] There's nothing audio that makes you feel like part of it.

[38:12] Oh, and one bug thing they need to fix in this game.

[38:15] When you do get swifty, which is one of the greatest adventures, when you complete it,

[38:19] before it allows the guy to say, I like what you got, you know, before if you hit any

[38:26] switch, it cancels that part out.

[38:28] Like you just complete the mode.

[38:30] You need to let us hear the congratulations.

[38:32] Okay.

[38:33] I think it's a solid B game.

[38:35] I think it's a solid B game.

[38:37] It will have the collectability of an A game.

[38:40] It'll have the rarity of an A game.

[38:42] It will continue to hold its price.

[38:44] There's only going to be 750 Rick and Morty's for all time in the pinball world.

[38:50] It's a theme that has millions of fans and it's quirky.

[38:53] It's fun.

[38:54] It's got cursing.

[38:55] It's an R rated pinball machine.

[38:56] For those reasons, this game will hold value.

[39:00] It will be in demand for a very long time.

[39:03] I mean Ninja Turtles looks like it's for kids next to Rick and Morty when you play them.

[39:07] Even if it shoots better, even if it does this better, there's just something about the

[39:11] fact that when you go and you play Rick and Morty and you're used to what most pinball

[39:16] games do, you're going to laugh out loud.

[39:20] You're going to have a unique experience and I think on that level, it really does succeed.

[39:25] But on a pure pinball level, I think it's like a B.

[39:28] Okay.

[39:29] But you can't erase those other elements.

[39:30] So for some people, it's going to be an A. For some people, they might think it's a

[39:34] clunk fest and it's a C. But that's my Canadian rating of Rick and Morty.

[39:38] And I'm in no rush to sell it.

[39:40] It is probably going to not last the onslaught of Guns and Roses that's coming.

[39:46] Because again, I mean, it's just that simple.

[39:49] But I enjoyed this game.

[39:50] I still enjoy playing it every weekend.

[39:53] I pour myself a Japanese beer and I play Rick and Morty and I have a good time.

[39:58] For a lot of you out there, that's all that matters.

[40:00] Are you enjoying the pin?

[40:01] Yes, I'm enjoying the pin.

[40:03] I don't feel anxious about owning it.

[40:05] I don't want to get rid of it right away.

[40:07] I'm not like this game sucks.

[40:08] No, not at all.

[40:09] I really do enjoy it.

[40:11] I just think spooky has some growing up to do in terms of what they mechanically put into

[40:16] the game and they need to make these games faster.

[40:19] You just can't make people wait two years to get this game.

[40:21] All right.

[40:22] Ladies and gentlemen, that's my sort of review of Rick and Morty.

[40:25] I'm trying to think if there's anything else I missed on the game.

[40:28] Right now they're shipping the game with black flipper rubbers, which is weird.

[40:31] I thought they were yellow.

[40:32] I would change all your rubbers out to Galaxi and Purple.

[40:35] I changed mine out to Purple.

[40:37] The game looks phenomenal.

[40:39] One other thing that's a quirk that I didn't mention.

[40:42] Sometimes when you have the ball save countdown clock going and the ball goes down the middle

[40:47] quickly, it actually ricochets.

[40:50] It doesn't go into the center drain.

[40:53] It sort of ricochets and goes up the apron.

[40:56] And sometimes it goes up the apron high enough where it allows the ball save timer to time

[41:02] out and you don't get the save when you should.

[41:04] That always annoys me.

[41:06] Oh, spooky.

[41:07] I don't know how to maybe we need to increase the ball save.

[41:11] But otherwise, look, this is a fun game.

[41:16] I see the hype and I see people spending so much money on getting one and I'm like,

[41:20] I think you guys need to calm down a little bit.

[41:22] All right.

[41:23] I'm expecting to do a podcast the second day that I just think a thousand dollar top

[41:26] or warrants.

[41:27] We have a discussion about it.

[41:28] I wouldn't buy it.

[41:29] I think that Avengers is the new sort of chapter for Stern Pimball.

[41:34] I really hope the quality is there in Avengers and we're going to see a lot more Avengers

[41:38] in the next few weeks.

[41:40] And now it's like really, really, it's like deep root, deep root.

[41:43] Where are you?

[41:44] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[41:45] Where are you?

[41:46] Chicago Gaming Company.

[41:47] Where are you?

[41:48] All right.

[41:49] Everyone.

[41:50] Have a good weekend.

[41:51] Have a good Labor Day weekend.

[41:52] Be safe.

[41:53] Probably going places, doing things.

[41:56] It's still out there.

[41:57] Be safe.

[41:58] Take care of yourselves.

[42:00] Please wear masks.

[42:01] I know this is like, for some reason, like a political issue, but just be safe.

[42:05] Be safe.

[42:06] All right.

[42:07] Love you guys.

[42:08] Thank you for coming back to the show.

[42:09] I really appreciate it.

[42:10] I know that you guys missed the show.

[42:11] I want to thank all of you who donated to my Patreon page while I was gone.

[42:15] You guys are crazy.

[42:16] You're giving me Patreon donations and there wasn't even a show.

[42:19] If you do want to support Canadian Pimball Podcast that way, go to patreon.

[42:23] P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com.

[42:26] Canadian Pimball, you can find it there, would happily accept any donations.

[42:30] I know I'm not holding this show hostage for $500 a month.

[42:35] I don't need the money, but it's just nice to, if you guys want to show your support.

[42:39] How many of you donate to Pinside?

[42:41] Think about that.

[42:42] Think about that.

[42:43] I was giving Ted crap because Ted, my friend Ted, had a bet with someone that I would not

[42:49] be back in August by August.

[42:52] He bet this guy the law, a hundred bucks, a hundred bucks that Canadian would not be back

[42:57] on the airwaves before September.

[43:00] Guess what?

[43:01] Ted wins the bet.

[43:02] I called up Ted.

[43:03] I said, Ted, get that hundred bucks and let's go have some drinks.

[43:06] He said he told the law to donate that money to Pinside.

[43:11] Are you kidding me, Ted?

[43:13] That money was ours.

[43:14] I won you that money and you're going to donate it to the site that's banned me, Ted.

[43:19] No, law, you got to pay up.

[43:20] Pay up.

[43:21] You should pay me directly.

[43:22] CanadianPimballGmail.com.

[43:23] Anyway, guys, glad to be back.

[43:25] Glad to be talking, Pimball.

[43:27] This is just the beginning of a new chapter of Canadian Pimball podcast.

[43:30] I hope you enjoy it.

[43:31] We're going to get some interviews.

[43:32] We're going to get some news.

[43:33] We got some scoops.

[43:34] I got some rumors.

[43:35] I know it's coming.

[43:36] You're going to hear it.

[43:37] And most of it's going to be right until it's wrong later.

[43:39] I know it's not going to go wrong.

[43:46] I know it's not going to go wrong.

[43:49] But I'm in love with this disease.

[43:50] Mom.
