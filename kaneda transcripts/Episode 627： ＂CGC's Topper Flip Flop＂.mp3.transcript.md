[00:00] I saw slides away, but don't look back and I know I heard you say.

[00:11] Oh, welcome to episode 627 of Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:19] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:20] We're going to talk about Cactus Canyon.

[00:23] We're going to talk about the infighting happening over the LE and now the SE Plus and how

[00:30] everybody now can get a topper on their Cactus Canyon machine.

[00:34] We're going to talk about what this means, right?

[00:37] Is collecting pinball going to be a thing of the past?

[00:40] Are all of these companies that create it FOMO and used FOMO to get people to buy games

[00:46] today?

[00:47] Are they starting to screw over the very collectible community that kept these companies

[00:53] going all of these years?

[00:55] Or are all of us starting to come to a very simple conclusion about this hobby that pinball

[01:02] is meant to be played and enjoyed?

[01:05] That we should buy games we love and we should stop focusing so much energy on turning

[01:11] these things into collectibles.

[01:13] Because as we all know, if you collect these pinball machines and all you want to do is

[01:18] buy them and not play them, then what is the point of life?

[01:23] What is the point of living?

[01:25] But there are also different audiences in pinball, right?

[01:29] There are people who play these games to enjoy them, to put 5,000 plays on a year.

[01:34] There are some people that just like the way they look.

[01:36] They consider these things to be pieces of furniture in their home and they walk by it

[01:41] every day, they barely touch the thing, they wax the play field every few months, and

[01:46] as long as those games remain mint, they are happy.

[01:49] And there are some of us out there who buy a new game, we try it out, if we like it, we

[01:53] keep it, if we get bored, we move on.

[01:55] But there are very few unnecessary toys like pinball that don't tank in value, you are

[02:00] not going to lose your shirt on a pinball purchase, and there is no avoiding the fact that

[02:05] these are toys, but that being said, a company should stay true to its word and

[02:11] a company that tells you it's going to do one thing, shouldn't do another, I don't like

[02:15] that behavior, we are going to talk about it.

[02:17] But before we do that, I want to put things in perspective, I want to say that I hope

[02:22] listener of the show Sean Goodwin, he had a stroke this past week and he's a young guy,

[02:27] he was a Corvette driver, he sold his Corvette for great profit, and I'm wishing you the best

[02:32] Sean.

[02:33] And when life hits like this, it gives all of us a different perspective because none of

[02:37] this really matters, flipping pinball for money, driving fast cars, eating out at expensive

[02:44] restaurants, I'm just throwing that one in there, but ultimately the only thing in life

[02:48] that matters is our health and the time we spend with family and loved ones, that's all

[02:53] that matters, nobody ever at the end of their life says I wish I spent more time at the

[02:58] office, I wish I worked more and didn't spend time with my kids, no, and I see it now

[03:03] with Killian, how short life is and how precious every single day is, and I do enjoy getting

[03:10] into pinball and geeking out with you guys because you have added a lot to my life, and I

[03:14] mean that, and for some of you out there, you've added even more than just your presence,

[03:19] you've also contributed to my life a little bit more, and I want to thank my latest Patreon

[03:23] contributors, I want to thank James H, Nicholas P, Shiler L, Kirby's beer store, Dusty

[03:31] F, Mike H, pinball panic, Andrew McBain from pinball adventures is now a Canadian club

[03:36] member, I want to thank each and every one of you for your monthly contributions, and

[03:40] if you are not a Canadian club member, you should join, and here's why you should join

[03:44] because on my new Canadian club that is coming out two day after I record this, I'm going

[03:49] to give you some very juicy news, rumors and speculation, well these are all going to

[03:54] be rumors about spooky pinball, rumors about CGC, rumors about what's next from Stern,

[04:01] rumors about JJP, I'm just going to tell you everything I know up to the point I can,

[04:06] and it's going to be some really good stuff, and if you are a member and you're wondering

[04:11] where are the new Canadian club episodes, you will get an email with all of them, so

[04:16] if you join the Canadian club today at Patreon, you will get every single episode, and at this

[04:21] point now, I think we're at episode 16 or 17, so there's a lot of great content waiting

[04:27] for your ears, okay, so let's talk about CGC, this launch of cactus canyon continues

[04:34] to make people debate whether or not what CGC is doing is the right thing, and I want

[04:40] to tell you I've been looking at this thing from a variety of angles, and I've been trying

[04:43] to study this and say, well what did they say they were going to do, and are they going

[04:48] against what they said they were going to do?

[04:51] Did they ever say that the topper for cactus canyon, one of the most innovative toppers

[04:55] in the history of pimbal, did they ever come out and say we are only going to make these

[05:00] available to the Ellie buyers of the game, and while I think there might have been some

[05:05] written materials, every time CGC talked, they kept saying they were not sure what they

[05:12] were going to do, they weren't positive either way, and so they never had like confirmation

[05:17] we are definitely going to offer it up for more people to buy it, and they never said

[05:21] definitely this is an exclusive only for Ellie buyers, so there was some ambiguity around

[05:26] this all throughout the launch of this game, and clearly we've seen what happened, right,

[05:31] they sold 1,250 Ellie's right away, and then everyone else who wanted one couldn't

[05:37] get one, and so then you had the SE buyers, they were not sure whether or not they could

[05:42] add that feature, and we all know that Lyman Sheets and Josh Sharp are working on a

[05:46] code update for this game that's going to take it to the next level, and you know they're

[05:51] going to work in that topper into the code, so it never really made much sense that they

[05:56] would put a ton of effort into this topper, make it interactive, and then not offer it

[06:02] up to everyone who buys this game, and you know Doug Dubas said something today because

[06:06] he responded to all of this criticism, he said, and I want to paraphrase, he said,

[06:11] look, the only people that are mad about this are the people that are scouting and flipping

[06:16] games for profit right away, we don't make pinball machines for scalpers, we make pinball

[06:23] machines for everybody to enjoy, and we want to put as much as we can into every single

[06:29] game so that everyone who buys a product from us can explore the full potential of the

[06:35] game, and we don't want it to be, so only these people get to experience the full potential

[06:41] of the game, and I've been thinking a lot about this, and I've been thinking about what

[06:46] Doug said, and I've been thinking about what I've said on my show over the last five

[06:50] years, that the people who spend more should get more, and I still believe that, and I

[06:55] do think that some of these limited games should have features that not everybody get because

[07:01] you're spending more money, however I don't think that's what Chicago Gaming Company

[07:05] wants to do, I don't think they want to be a company that only gives a handful of people

[07:11] the best possible game, I think they want everyone to get the best possible game they

[07:16] can get, I also think they're not stupid, and they realize there is a collector market

[07:22] in this hobby, and there are people that will spend more money if you pack more into the

[07:26] game, and that is why they've followed the model of having limited edition games, if they

[07:32] wanted nothing to do with collectors, they wouldn't make an LE, and so part of what Doug

[07:37] is saying there, I kind of halfway agree with him, because if they really wanted to democratize

[07:43] Pimbal, to bring as many people as they can into the Pimbal hobby and get them a game

[07:48] with every single feature the game should have, then they wouldn't have different tiers

[07:53] of the game, you wouldn't have to do an LE, and then an SE plus, you would just make

[07:58] Cactus Canyon, and you would just price Cactus Canyon with everything that should be in

[08:04] it at a certain price, but they didn't do that, they did make a version that they knew

[08:10] would speak to the collectors, now it's also very convenient to sort of lump collectors

[08:15] in with scalpers and flippers, and they're not the same audience, the majority of people

[08:21] that buy games are not scalpers, the majority of people that buy LE's are not flippers,

[08:28] if they were, think about it, there are 1,250 games that were sold of Cactus Canyon,

[08:35] how many of them are being flipped right now, because now is the time to sell it, especially

[08:39] with the SE plus, so at 1,250 Cactus Canyon machines, there are only 4 for sale on the

[08:47] Pinside Marketplace right now, so I don't think that the majority of people buy these

[08:53] games to flip, yes there are always going to be people that speculate in this market,

[08:57] it's a marketplace, this is a product we're allowed to buy something low and sell it

[09:02] high, this is a commodity for a lot of people, and the market is super hot right now, so

[09:08] you can't blame someone who wants to speculate on this game, if CGC really really really

[09:14] wanted to cut down on scalpers or flippers, there's things you could do to do that, there's

[09:19] things you could do to combat it, but they didn't do any of that either, but I also do

[09:23] agree with Doug, I do think that ultimately this hobby needs to get back to a place of

[09:30] playing Pimball and enjoying Pimball, and not chasing after the newest and the rarest

[09:36] and the most expensive every single time there's a new release, it's fatiguing, it's exhausting,

[09:44] it's never what Pimball was supposed to be, it was fun, it was, it's been a lot of fun,

[09:50] the whole like FOMO, but over and over and over again, you reach a point where you're

[09:56] just FOMOED out, you realize that the unnecessary toy you have isn't really worth what you think

[10:03] it is, it's just not sustainable, you just can't keep going down this road over and over

[10:09] again, unfortunately we are going to see over the next year or so, we are going to see inflated

[10:17] Pimball prices like never before, but that doesn't make these games more rare, it doesn't make these

[10:23] games more scarce, 1,250 Cactus Canyon Elise is a ton of Elise, 1000 Godzilla Elise is a ton of

[10:35] Elise, and if you want to enjoy Cactus Canyon or Godzilla or any single Pimball machine on planet

[10:42] earth, you will be able to enjoy that game, and I mean this when I say this, there is not a single

[10:47] Pimball machine where owning the Ellie is actually a better experience than owning the model below it,

[10:54] there is barely any difference in owning a collector's edition of a Jersey Jack game over the Ellie,

[11:00] barely any difference, you will not have more fun on your Guns and Roses collector's edition

[11:06] as you will on your Ellie, and so I applaud Doug and his efforts to sort of democratize the experience

[11:13] of playing Cactus Canyon, I also chuckled a little bit because it's also a $9,200 toy, so when you

[11:22] say you want to make things available to the masses, really, really $9,200, you are not pricing

[11:30] anything for the masses when you are pricing in at $9,250, let's be honest people, and that's

[11:36] part of the problem, right? It's once you realize that the gateway or the entrance fee for Pimball

[11:41] is stupidly high for almost every American, it is, it's so stupidly high that once you start

[11:48] getting anyone through the door at $9,250, the only people that are really walking through the

[11:53] door at that price point are wealthy people, and then from there if you are a company, you want to

[11:59] maximize revenue, you are not here to maximize enjoyment, there a company is not measured on how many

[12:06] smiles it makes, it's measured on how much money it makes, and so then it becomes foolish for

[12:11] these Pimball companies not to try to maximize their revenue, and why am I selling to these guys

[12:17] at $9,250 when all these rich dudes would easily pay $11,000 for Cactus Canyon Ellie, and they would

[12:23] have, so to strange like padding on the back, it's still a toy that's only available to the 1%

[12:29] tile in America, it really is, this is still a toy that's catering to rich people, it really is,

[12:35] to people that have a lot of disposable income, and so I don't want to go down a road where we think

[12:40] we're doing anything good for society by pricing a Pimball machine at $9,250, or giving you the

[12:46] ability to buy a game with a topper for $9,250, it is what it is and you got to kind of own up to it,

[12:52] that none of this is really worth it, like none of these games are worth it, we all know it,

[12:56] it's like deep down inside, we all know that none of these games are really worth it,

[13:01] we also know that we're not going to lose a lot of money if we buy one of these games,

[13:05] you will be able to get out pretty much what you put in, you can't buy a $9,200 TV and get out of it

[13:13] anything in a few years, nobody wants it right, but here's my thing with CGC overall, and I don't

[13:18] think we should just like blanket forgive them for how they handled this launch, my problem with CGC,

[13:24] it's not the game, the game is going to be great, Lyman Sheets is going to make this game even better,

[13:30] they build probably the best quality Pimball machines in the entire industry, and if you like

[13:36] cactus canyon you're going to love this game, am I happy that the SE buyers can get the SE plus

[13:42] and the top are the insurers, yes, I don't want people to miss out on a game being amazing,

[13:48] I don't want there to not be stuff in a game, I don't, I think these companies should be giving you

[13:53] everything and the kitchen sink for $9,200, remember just a few years ago, a Stern Ali was like

[14:00] $6,500, everyone is forgetting that we are living through inflation, so at these prices,

[14:07] these games should be loaded, my issue with CGC is their communication is terrible,

[14:13] it was piss poor throughout the entire launch of this game, the problem with Chicago gaming

[14:19] company is they had everybody guessing, it's like they were even guessing themselves, and I was

[14:25] at Expo, and I saw how ill prepared they were to tell us what was in this game, what would be in

[14:32] this model or that model, and I'm sorry but CGC, the reason why there's so much confusion over

[14:38] what happens around your games is you take forever to launch products, so you've got almost three

[14:45] years between Monster Bash and Cactus Canyon, three years, and in that time you might have changed

[14:52] your policies on topers, but you didn't tell us, you released a Medieval Man is Topper after the

[14:58] fact because you didn't have a Topper with Medieval Man is when you first came out with it,

[15:02] and so was this going to be the way it went moving forward or not, nobody really knew,

[15:06] and I think Chicago gaming company, if you want to make people satisfied, it's more than just

[15:12] making a great Pimball machine, you also need to communicate in the right way, you also need to be

[15:18] more transparent in what you're going to do, because don't lie to us, you figured all of this

[15:25] after you saw the excitement for the Ellie, you did not figure this out before, and the only fair

[15:33] thing to do in all of Pimball is do what Stern does, you need to have a Matrix List that says here

[15:40] is what is in each edition of the game, and that needs to be the Bible of what's going to be in each

[15:46] model, you can't go and change it, and we've seen this a lot recently, we've seen a lot of these

[15:53] companies just changing it after they see the demand, you know, and it's unfortunate because I

[15:58] don't like that either, and the best way to get around it and the best way to avoid all the drama

[16:04] is just communicate at the very beginning what your plans are, and then don't change your plans,

[16:11] don't tell me 300 legends of Ahala, and then bump it up to 500, don't do that, they should just

[16:18] come out and say everyone's going to be able to buy the Lyman sheet code, everyone can buy a mirrored

[16:24] back glass, now do I still think cactus Canyon Ellie has special features that the SE Plus doesn't

[16:30] have, I don't know, it's got an apron, I think it's got some better sculpts in the game, it's got

[16:35] different railroad metal or something like that, it's got a shaker motor, I think it's got in

[16:39] Visi glass, you will get your money's worth with the Ellie, it's funny that the SE Plus is also

[16:46] the same exact price as the Ellie, and I think they did that on purpose because the Ellie comes

[16:51] with more, so if you buy an SE Plus you are spending the amount of money in Ellie would cost without

[16:57] getting in Ellie, and I think that was a pretty smart thing to do to sort of alleviate the anger of

[17:01] the Ellie guys, because now if you bought an Ellie, you are getting the greatest valued machine

[17:06] that they will launch of cactus Canyon, I do mean it when I say it, but chasing after all of

[17:12] these limited versions of Pimball, you will reach a point where you'll just get tired of it all,

[17:17] I'm kind of tired of it all, none of these games are truly special, if they were really special

[17:22] and really rare and these like grail items, you would never see it, you would never see any of them,

[17:29] they would be locked away in the vaults of Pimball collector's basements and you would never see them,

[17:35] they would never come up for sale, but everything in all of these new games, everything comes up for sale,

[17:42] and sure it might pop up for sale for some stupid amount of money, but it still pops up for sale,

[17:47] I'm kind of on this new mission now, just everyone should just buy what they love,

[17:51] and just play Pimball more, and stop chasing after all of these vanity items on these machines,

[17:58] that do nothing to make the machine better, and let's get as many companies as we can to launch

[18:03] games finished, the other part of my last show is like I just want these games to come out complete,

[18:08] so I don't have to wonder whether or not the game's going to be great, so CGC we're going to give you

[18:13] a little bit of a pass, but you've got to get your communications to be better than this,

[18:17] you've got to be much better than this, and for you club members of Canada, you're going to hear

[18:21] what Mark Richie's game is, and you're going to hear some more details about it, and that's what's

[18:25] coming out after Cactus Canyon, so join the Canada Club at Patreon today, I want to say congratulations

[18:33] to the team over at American Pimball, they won the Best Modern Pimball Machine Award at MGC

[18:40] this past weekend, now I don't know how legends of the Hall of Beat Godzilla and Cactus Canyon

[18:45] for that award, but they won it, I wasn't on the jury, I don't know who voted for this, but

[18:49] congratulations to David Fix and the team over there, we will see how this game sells,

[18:54] I am curious to see how the game sells right now, on Pinside, there's only three available to buy,

[19:00] there's three for sale at 8400 bucks, and at a 500 games, that's not a lot, now that also

[19:07] shows that no one's buying Vahala to flip, there is no money to be made on a Pimball Flip of Vahala,

[19:13] so if you're going to buy it, you better know you want to play the game and enjoy the game,

[19:17] because there's not money to be made, and I do think legends of Vahala will lose money,

[19:22] with everything out there, I don't think this one's going to hold its value for very long,

[19:27] but that's okay, if you put a couple thousand plays on it, that would cost you a couple thousand

[19:32] dollars out on location, you know when I talked to my friend Derek about his JJP games,

[19:37] the guy puts like 5,000 plays on a game, and if he were to play Willy Wonka 5,000 times,

[19:45] do the map, right, I think he's played Wonka 10,000 times, the dude's crazy, like it's funny,

[19:51] if you get a collector's edition of JJP and you play it 12,500 times, you've absolutely paid

[19:59] for your game in full and then some, and then you get your money back, that is what we all should do,

[20:04] if I could leave behind one legacy it would be this, and I'm changing my tune a little bit,

[20:09] I think a goal for each and every one of us, that every single game we buy, we should have a goal

[20:16] to play that game, the same amount of times as the price of the game itself, so if you bought

[20:23] Pirates of the Caribbean for $36,000 used, I want you to play that Pirates CE, 36,000 times,

[20:32] and I think that's a really good goal for each and every one of us, to stop walking by these things

[20:38] and thinking you have this rare pinball item that you're going to cash out one day,

[20:43] life is really short, you only have a finite amount of time on planet earth, it's a toy meant

[20:51] to be played, it's a toy that was meant to go into a bar, into an arcade, it was never meant to be

[20:58] in your home, but here's the amazing thing, if you're lucky enough, and I mean this, if you're lucky

[21:04] enough in the world with all the poverty and all the strife and all the hardship in this world,

[21:10] if you're lucky enough to have a pinball machine in your house, you are a modern day Ricky Schroeder

[21:17] from Silver Spoons, remember he had the arcade games in his house, you're a modern day version of

[21:24] a Silver Spoon kid, but you're a grown adult, but guess what, you're only winning in life, if you

[21:30] play them, they're toys, if you're not going to play them, pass them on to someone who will actually

[21:37] play them, I know this might upset some of you that only collect and just cover up your pins,

[21:41] I love the guys who cover up the pin, they put that big floor mat over the glass itself to protect

[21:49] it from what, from dust, what, really play it, and when you cover it up like that, you don't even

[21:56] get to walk by it and see the world under glass, it's so weird to me, you might as well have just

[22:02] left it in a box, alright what else is going on in pinball this week, so Godzilla Elise are shipping

[22:08] like crazy, it was super fun to see all of the unboxings over the last week, it once again

[22:15] shows that Stern Pinball can get games made like nobody else, but here is the big problem with

[22:21] Stern Pinball, I am hearing from people, if you ordered a Godzilla premium two day, guess when

[22:28] you're being told you're going to get your game, you might not get your machine until November

[22:34] of next year, there is a one year backlog on Stern manufacturing, one year and what that's going

[22:42] to mean is that prices are going to go crazy, so if you want a game new in box you're going to have

[22:48] to pay a premium and distributors are going to start to see this and sellers of games are going to

[22:53] start to see this, if you thought 2021 was bad, just wait to 2022 comes around and there's nothing

[23:00] to be had and distributor allotments are all drying up, how you're going to get your game, I mean it

[23:06] is November, if you don't think there's a manufacturing issue, there's a supply chain issue,

[23:11] where's the Mandalorian topper, the Mandalorian topper was supposed to be out in August, where's

[23:17] that, where's that, it's the droid, it's supposed to be their coolest topper ever, where's the

[23:21] Godzilla topper, where's that thing, everything is just somewhat delayed, it is interesting that even

[23:28] though this stuff is delayed and Stern has a backlog, the real question becomes should Stern still be

[23:35] revealing and releasing new games when they have to make so many old games, should they take a break

[23:41] and just get up to speed on their current orders, right, like why don't they do that, it's going

[23:47] to be interesting to see how Stern handles this, right, so you're going to release rush and you

[23:51] still have to make all of these mandos, all of these Godzilla's, all of these Elvira orders and

[23:56] you're going to release a new game, so I think there a real problem now is no one's going to order a

[24:01] Stern premium if they know the weight is forever, sure they'll order the LEs because they make the

[24:06] LEs first, but that seems to be their new business model, let's get all the LEs sold, the big

[24:12] ticket items sold in this hot market, we'll make a few pros and a few premiums and then we're on

[24:17] to the next title and it's the same cycle, but if you don't get in on an early premium order,

[24:22] you're going to be waiting a year for a pinball machine and then will you even still want it

[24:28] because by the time your Godzilla arrives a year from now, we will see and this is crazy,

[24:34] we will see Keith L1's next game before you even get his current game, you're going to see Toy

[24:41] Story, you're going to see James Bond, you're going to see all these new games coming out, nobody

[24:46] wants to wait a year for a pinball machine, we all know that these are impulse purchases,

[24:52] of course they are, if you don't think this is an impulse purchase hobby they sold

[24:57] 1250 cactus canyons in one day, they sold 1750 spooky machines in one day, this is an impulse

[25:05] purchase, we don't even wait for there to be reviews before we buy the games, we don't even wait

[25:11] to see the games before we buy the games, it doesn't get any more impulse than that and you

[25:16] know what helps with FOMO, you know what helps with impulse, you know what helps with buying before

[25:21] you see it, patience and when you have patience and you wait you make smarter decisions and the

[25:28] biggest enemy to a pinball company's marketing department is time, I don't want to give you

[25:33] enough time to think about it because if I do I know you're not going to want it as much anymore,

[25:39] I know you're going to realize that you don't probably need it, I know you're probably just

[25:44] going to enjoy what you have, they don't want you to have too much time to think about it,

[25:50] so it's going to be a brutal 2022, it is and I think if you have a collection, my advice would

[25:56] be to just enjoy the collection, if you have relationships and you can get in on an LE or a C E

[26:03] for sticker price, sure buy it, you're not going to lose any money, flipping will not stop,

[26:08] scalping will not stop, it's going to be even worse next year, if companies really wanted to put

[26:15] more of an end to it, they could, but nobody's doing that, nobody's doing lottery systems,

[26:21] nobody's putting your name on the game, if they really wanted to stop you from selling it on to

[26:26] the next guy, why don't they just put your name on the plaque, why don't they just make every game

[26:31] non transferable, they don't do that, a distributor could have a policy that says none of our sales are

[26:37] transferable, if you buy the game it's getting shipped to you and nobody else, they don't do that,

[26:43] so there are things they could do, but who cares, right, it's like who cares, maybe we should be

[26:50] rooting for more of these SE pluses, maybe we should be telling Stern Pimba why can't all the L

[26:55] virus look that good, maybe I shouldn't have to spend 20 grand to get L virus to look that good,

[27:00] I should be able to spend 10, and if all of us demand it more features in every game, I don't

[27:05] know, it's nice having rare collectibles every once in a while, it's nice seeing what these

[27:10] companies will put in their CEs and LEs to justify the price, but lately with most of these games,

[27:16] you really can't justify what's in them to justify the LEs, the only thing you can justify it

[27:22] with is I can get more for it when I resell the game, and that's not really fun, right, and let's

[27:29] face it, for most of these guys they don't need another $2000 in their checking account, it's nice

[27:34] to get it, but I would like to see, I would like to see the value of the LE, the value of the CE,

[27:42] the value of the rare version actually go into gameplay, actually go into mechs and actually go into

[27:49] real value, I may never see that day, and it's never going to happen because these companies realize

[27:55] they don't have to do it, you just don't have to do it, when you can just make 200 L virus and

[28:01] sell them for 25 grand, simply because you did just a couple things, the market is telling you,

[28:06] you don't need to put more into it, it is, that's what the market is saying, all right, so this

[28:10] has been my little Monday morning episode, the club episode is going to be where all the juiciness

[28:15] lies this week, I will reveal this club info at a later date, but I want to just say thank you

[28:20] for the guys who contribute to Canadian Spinball podcast, and we're almost at 230 supporters, I think

[28:26] we're at 228 right now, so thank you everyone who contributes, the merchandise line is coming,

[28:32] I want you to be able to get some Canadian merchandise for this holiday season, so look for that,

[28:37] everybody have a great week, I'm not sure if there's any new pinball news coming this week,

[28:42] rush is next, just so you know rush is 1000% the next game from Stern, it's from John Borg, it is rush,

[28:49] there is no doubt in my mind that rush is next, so that is coming, and I think we've seen every

[28:55] new release, other than rush, I think we've seen everything we're going to see in the pinball world

[29:01] this year, I don't think there's going to be any more surprises, and this is a good time a year

[29:05] to sort of turn off pin side and spend time with your family, it might even be a good time a year

[29:12] to not listen to pinball podcasts like this one as much as you usually do, the only thing I will ask,

[29:17] and it's that time of year again, is the twippies are coming, Jeff is late this year, like nobody's

[29:23] talking about the twippies, but in December if you vote for your favorite pinball podcaster, I would

[29:29] love a vote, and I would also love to be written in and voted for for favorite pinball streamer,

[29:35] I actually enjoy doing my streams on Facebook live more than the show now, just because it's like

[29:41] no editing, no nothing, it's just live and then we're done, it's so much fun, if you're not hanging

[29:48] out on Canadian's Facebook page and you're not doing the lives with me, you should totally do it,

[29:54] it's every Saturday morning, we do Saturday morning spectacular, it's 10am Eastern Standard Time,

[30:01] come hang out, come hang out, I think you'll have a good time, we got Zach many back in, I expect Greg

[30:06] Bone to be back in, we let everybody back in and everyone's having a good time, and this is the

[30:10] best positive takeaway from Expo is that we all just hung out and talked to pinball, that's the way

[30:17] it should be, and by losing my voice, I gotta go people episode 627, canada out.
