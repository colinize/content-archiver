[00:00] I feel like this is the song Gary Stern played when he priced the Mandalorian topper.

[00:03] Welcome everybody to the only pinball podcast that is banned from Pinball Expo that's happening

[00:31] this weekend.

[00:32] We have a lot to unpack in the pinball world.

[00:34] We've seen gameplay footage of James Bond.

[00:37] We've seen the Mandalorian topper.

[00:39] How is Canada going to respond to that?

[00:41] We're seeing TNAs are shipping in the wild.

[00:44] We are seeing Queen Pinball at Pinball Expo.

[00:47] A working magic girl.

[00:48] There is so much happening in pinball this weekend.

[00:51] But let's talk about it.

[00:53] Let's get right into it because this is the only show that knows how to get to the point.

[00:57] Oh no, he said it.

[00:58] Alright, let's do this.

[00:59] Let's talk about James Bond first.

[01:01] Then I'm going to talk about the Mandalorian topper.

[01:04] Then I'm going to go around the horn and see what else is happening in the pinball world.

[01:07] How does that sound?

[01:08] For the world's number one pinball podcaster who makes the only numbers that matter.

[01:12] The moolah.

[01:13] Everyone.

[01:14] Okay, here's the thing.

[01:15] Here's the thing.

[01:16] We saw Jack Danger.

[01:17] We saw George Gomez.

[01:18] We saw Stern streaming the machine.

[01:19] I think it was like Tuesday night.

[01:21] Was it Tuesday night or Wednesday night?

[01:22] It was Tuesday night.

[01:23] And so here's my take.

[01:24] This was a two and a half hour long stream, everybody.

[01:28] Two and a half hours long.

[01:30] That is stupid.

[01:31] I'm just going to say from a macro level, looking at this thing, when I went on YouTube

[01:34] to catch it because I couldn't watch it live because I was traveling for business, I can't

[01:38] understand why Stern Pinball thinks the best way to show you a pinball machine for the

[01:43] first time being played is a two and a half hour stream.

[01:48] Now it was really nice to see George Gomez and him talk about his passion for this property

[01:53] and him explain the game and everything that went into it.

[01:56] I really like that section of the two and a half hour stream.

[01:59] Now what do I think about the game itself?

[02:01] Well, here's the thing.

[02:02] I think the game shoots great.

[02:03] I think the game looks like a really fun game to shoot.

[02:06] On a code standpoint though, this game is a total mess to watch right now.

[02:11] It is.

[02:12] If you watch this stream, I don't understand how you walk away from this game without feeling

[02:17] like the code is just not there to stream.

[02:19] You barely hear from James Bond in this game.

[02:22] I was watching this stream just to see where are the Sean Connery clips and they're clearly

[02:27] not even dropped in very much right now.

[02:29] I think there's a clip of him on a boat talking about his watch, but there is barely any Sean

[02:35] Connery in this machine right now.

[02:38] Now they definitely have the rights to use Sean Connery's image and sync up his voice

[02:42] with the clips, which is a good thing.

[02:45] Every time we see clips from the movies, we are seeing the voices synced up with the actors

[02:50] and actresses, which is great.

[02:52] But here's my thing.

[02:53] It's like I'm watching this stream and I don't even know how to comprehend what I'm

[02:57] seeing.

[02:58] It just feels like a jumbled mess.

[03:01] I'm not really sure Stern really knows how to deal with a lot of content, a lot of objectives

[03:07] in the game, a lot of things to shoot.

[03:10] It just feels like if you just stare at the LCD screen, which I know you don't when you

[03:14] play pinball, but as a viewer of the stream, as I'm looking at that LCD screen, I have

[03:20] absolutely no idea like what is going on.

[03:22] Like stuff is coming in and out, clips are getting broken up, all this weird stuff is

[03:26] happening and I think Stern pinball needs to figure out a way, even if you're dealing

[03:31] with like six or seven movies, it just needs to feel like there's not so much happening

[03:36] on the LCD screen.

[03:38] I think these pinball companies need a user interface expert to understand how do you

[03:44] utilize an LCD screen.

[03:46] I don't think anyone really knows what they're doing.

[03:49] It's just so convoluted.

[03:51] It's such a mess.

[03:52] Everything's all over the place.

[03:54] I want to feel like, don't you want to feel like I started this movie?

[03:57] I'm now in this James Bond movie.

[04:00] I am now going to go through some of the major modes or moments in this movie and that is

[04:04] what is going to appear on the screen.

[04:07] Instead it goes from like a satellite to a missile to a casino like slot machine to a

[04:12] table of poker to this to that.

[04:14] It's all over the place.

[04:16] Everything is all over the place and I just don't understand.

[04:19] Like I think we need to figure out a way to make it simpler.

[04:22] We don't need to fill that screen with everything and I think that's the thing and I think Batman

[04:27] 66 to this day remains in my mind the only Stern pinball machine that actually uses

[04:34] the assets properly, that actually takes you through the content in the right way.

[04:40] Stern pinball needs to study Batman 66.

[04:43] It is the greatest way to use a screen.

[04:46] It is the greatest way to integrate footage and content into the pinball experience.

[04:52] It is just the right amount of everything and when I'm looking at this game right now

[04:57] it just feels like a little bit of a mess but here's the other part.

[05:00] It's really too premature for me to even judge this game.

[05:04] Watching this stream right now and watching it this week, this game is not even close

[05:08] to being done.

[05:10] So why would I even want to look at it right now?

[05:12] How can I give you my first impressions of James Bond when the game feels like it's only

[05:17] 40% complete?

[05:18] There is barely any James Bond in the game right now.

[05:21] You don't really hear him.

[05:23] This is like watching a Batman stream with no Batman and Robin and I'm like okay so I'm

[05:28] not going to indict this game but I will say this.

[05:31] It's way too early for this game to be up for sale.

[05:35] It's way too early to say this game is going to be great.

[05:38] It's way too early to say this game is a mess.

[05:40] It's just way too early to even look at this game and I think that's my overall takeaway

[05:45] is that Stern has absolutely once again fumbled the launch of a franchise that they tried

[05:50] to connect with the anniversary of that franchise.

[05:54] They fumbled it with the Batman launch and they fumbled it with the James Bond launch

[05:58] and for those of you out there saying this game is going to be amazing when it's done

[06:02] my question for all of you is how do you know that and how do you know when it's going to

[06:07] be done?

[06:08] So I just wouldn't go in on this game right now.

[06:11] I think you're going to want to wait to see if it actually does become the great game

[06:14] everyone thinks it's going to be but I don't think that's going to happen for like a year.

[06:19] Like there's a lot of work that has to go into the code of this game.

[06:23] Like right now it's just a jumbled mess and I really do think Stern will probably figure

[06:28] it out but by the time they do figure it out we're going to see a lot more pinball machines

[06:33] in the marketplace.

[06:34] So that's my takeaway on James Bond.

[06:36] It's like buy or beware like you just don't know what you're going to get.

[06:39] As far as the gameplay, the gameplay looked fine.

[06:42] I think that big silver missile is a total miss.

[06:45] It doesn't look very fun.

[06:46] I don't think any of the toys in James Bond are really wowing me.

[06:50] I don't think any of the light shows are really wowing me.

[06:52] I think it's going to come down to like the integration of the theme and the music and

[06:57] the sounds and all the call outs and right there it's just not there yet.

[07:02] Sometimes I feel like when people look at a stream like this there is no way you can

[07:05] say the game looks great right now.

[07:07] It doesn't.

[07:08] Put this next to a game that actually is more complete.

[07:11] Put this game next to Godzilla.

[07:13] Put it next to Lord of the Rings.

[07:15] Put it next to Tron.

[07:16] Put it next to Metallica.

[07:17] Like this game is a mess right now people and that's the way I feel about it.

[07:22] Alright so let's talk about this Mandalorian topper.

[07:25] The $2,000 the most expensive pinball topper Stern pinball has ever sold us by a hundred

[07:31] percent.

[07:33] The last most expensive topper was $1,000.

[07:36] So what do I think about this primarily plastic using a screen hologram $2,000 Mandalorian

[07:44] topper that requires you to buy it to unlock the full potential of the Mandalorian pinball

[07:49] experience.

[07:50] This is pinball DLC.

[07:53] This is it people.

[07:54] You have to pay more money to get the most out of your game.

[07:56] Here's my feeling on the Mandalorian topper and I'm going to use a metaphor.

[08:00] This is like me walking into a house I don't even want to buy and opening up the back door

[08:08] and seeing that there is a swimming pool attached to the house.

[08:13] That's how I feel about the Mandalorian topper.

[08:15] I don't think this game was ever magical.

[08:17] I think it was a total whiff on a Star Wars franchise theme integration standpoint so

[08:23] I don't care that two years later they're going to put a $2,000 topper on top of the

[08:28] machine.

[08:29] I really don't care.

[08:30] I don't think the topper looks right.

[08:32] I don't think it syncs up with the colors of the game at all and I also just don't think

[08:36] this game is very imaginative.

[08:38] I don't think it's very creative.

[08:40] I don't think it ever was and so I don't really care.

[08:42] I don't really want it.

[08:43] I've never wanted a Mandalorian.

[08:45] I don't want a Mandalorian topper so it's such an easy pass for me.

[08:49] What I think Stern is doing and I think it's unfortunate for you fans of the Mandalorian

[08:54] and for you people who love the game this is the worst news possible because they're

[08:58] giving you something you want to strap on the top of the machine that you actually like

[09:02] and then they're going to charge you $2,000 for this cheap thing.

[09:05] I mean just look at the parts in this thing.

[09:07] This thing is probably costing Stern like just $150 to make and they're going to sell

[09:12] it for $2,000.

[09:14] They already did all the coding on this machine.

[09:16] The code's been done for this topper for a long time so there's not even additional

[09:20] coding costs and people for this much money, so this is the future now, right?

[09:24] They're going to hold back code and they're going to make you buy a topper to unlock some

[09:29] of that code when you should have got that code for the full price of the machine and

[09:33] now that we're spending $13,000, let's do the math.

[09:36] Imagine if they do this with James Bond.

[09:37] If you buy a James Bond's LE for $13,000 and then you were at $1,000 for tax, $14,000,

[09:44] $500 for shipping, $14,000, then a year or two from now they're going to want you to

[09:49] buy the $2,000 James Bond topper so you're at like now $16,500.

[09:56] You also got to spend like shipping for the topper so you're almost at $17,000.

[10:01] Well, more like $16,500.

[10:03] Let's just say that you're at $16,500 for a Stern LE with all of its accessories to

[10:11] unlock the full potential of a game.

[10:14] At what point everybody is this just stupid?

[10:18] At what point is this just a name?

[10:20] See, this is why it's so easy now.

[10:23] When pinball prices get this high, it is getting so easy to say this is stupid, this isn't

[10:29] worth the money to me, and I am simply going to wait until a game comes out that is like

[10:35] the Moby Dick and Unicorn in my world.

[10:38] I need a grail game that I absolutely have to have because this is just getting silly.

[10:44] What if you buy a Mandalorian premium now?

[10:46] You have to buy it new because remember they're going to adjust the price.

[10:49] Now a Mandalorian premium is $9,700 and if you want to put the topper on top of it, now

[10:55] you're at $11,700 for a Stern premium that comes with the topper.

[11:02] See the problem now is if Stern Pinball had this approach like years ago, imagine if they

[11:07] released Batman LE without a topper.

[11:10] So you buy Batman LE for like $12,000, oh you want the topper?

[11:14] It's $4,000 and people would have bought it.

[11:16] People would have bought it.

[11:17] And look, I understand that you guys with money, this doesn't mean anything.

[11:22] Like none of these purchases really matter, but I am on the sidelines on all of this.

[11:27] I don't get excited by this.

[11:28] I think this hobby is being spoiled.

[11:31] I think it's being somewhat ruined by the greediness of Stern Pinball and I also don't

[11:36] think they're going to learn a lesson.

[11:37] I don't because it doesn't matter because to the target audience, you guys have so much

[11:42] money, this does not matter.

[11:45] You have millions of dollars.

[11:48] $20,000 means nothing to you.

[11:51] You could buy $20,000 pinball machines every six months and nobody would care.

[11:56] And Stern Pinball just needs a thousand of those people around the world.

[12:01] Can you imagine if they got wealthy Chinese people or wealthy people in Japan into pinball?

[12:06] They're not into it.

[12:07] The market's not big there, but can you imagine if you started to expand where people want

[12:12] pinball machines into even more lucrative and first world nations?

[12:17] Imagine that and you only had a thousand of them.

[12:19] This is the thing is like the ceiling can keep going up and up and up and it's never

[12:22] going to stop.

[12:23] It's just at the point now for me personally, I just don't see the value in this stuff,

[12:27] but it doesn't really bother me.

[12:29] I don't care about this top.

[12:30] This topper is sitting on top of a game that I will never own.

[12:34] Okay.

[12:35] I will never own.

[12:36] I will own a body who's going to rationalize this thing because he's a Star Wars fanatic.

[12:40] Okay.

[12:41] What else is going on in pinball?

[12:42] We've got total nuclear annihilation.

[12:44] 2.0 is shipping out into the world with its black powder coat armor with its collector's

[12:51] edition plaque.

[12:52] Let's talk about it real quickly.

[12:54] I looked down at the machine, $9,000 that black powder coating just doesn't work for

[13:01] me and I'm not trying to be negative on this show.

[13:03] I'm actually in a really, really good mood.

[13:05] I don't know if you could tell.

[13:06] It just doesn't look good.

[13:07] The black powder coating does not look as good as the chrome.

[13:11] So now you're spending $3,000 more on a version of the game that looks basic, like just pure

[13:17] black.

[13:18] Think about it.

[13:19] What color does Stern usually use for its pros?

[13:22] Just flat black.

[13:23] What color is American pinball using for its standard edition?

[13:26] Black.

[13:27] When you just do black without any color, it's absolutely cheaper looking.

[13:32] This looks more like a basic version of TNA even though it cost $3,000 more than the

[13:38] game was originally.

[13:40] And so look, you're going to see all these owners try to justify it.

[13:43] I think it looks cheap.

[13:44] It doesn't look like a 9K game.

[13:45] My other thing is this spooky and I brought this onto my Facebook page, Spooky Pinball.

[13:50] Stop getting the little details wrong.

[13:53] You need to stop doing design things that Canada in New York who doesn't even have a

[13:57] design degree looks at it right away and says that does not look right.

[14:02] The collector's edition plaques on each of these games, the logo is off-centered with

[14:07] the plaque.

[14:08] Not only that where it says collector's editions, it's also off-centered with the plaque because

[14:13] they need to have the number after the word collector's edition to center everything.

[14:18] But they're putting the number like in the middle of the plaque in this weird spot that's

[14:22] not even centered with anything.

[14:24] So this is my point.

[14:25] Spooky Pinball.

[14:26] $9,000.

[14:28] Stop acting so bush league on all of your stuff.

[14:32] You need to make sure that someone goes through every element of your game and says, is this

[14:37] done right?

[14:38] You've got enough Corvettes.

[14:40] You've made enough money now.

[14:42] You should stop mailing it in on some of these little detailed items.

[14:47] I get they are little things.

[14:49] But the details matter.

[14:50] The most minute details are what matter the most on expensive luxury items.

[14:57] And if you think you're not making an expensive luxury item, Spooky Pinball, just zoom out

[15:02] a little bit.

[15:03] Look at the medium income in the world.

[15:05] You are and you need to get these details better.

[15:07] All right.

[15:08] What else is happening at Pinball Expo this week?

[15:10] So first and foremost, the loser kid pinball and pinball network flipping the script on

[15:15] autism is happening today.

[15:17] People so make sure you pay attention to that.

[15:20] There's a lot of interesting items up for auction.

[15:23] There's also going to be a 10 hour live stream generating money.

[15:26] They're easily going to blow past their goal of $25,000.

[15:30] So make sure you guys check that out.

[15:32] What else is happening at Expo?

[15:33] We're going to see a working magic girl.

[15:35] I could care less about a working magic girl.

[15:38] We're going to see Queen Pinball.

[15:39] I am curious to see what people think of Queen Pinball from the video itself.

[15:44] It looks underwhelming.

[15:45] Now videos can't always can note how much fun a game is to play.

[15:49] But based on the videos, I'm not seeing much in the game.

[15:53] But I think people are going to enjoy Queen simply because the Queen songs are so good.

[15:58] And so when that music is going, I think people are going to have a good time.

[16:02] Does it look like a $10,000 pinball machine?

[16:05] Absolutely not.

[16:06] But as we all know, it's 2022.

[16:08] And now a $10,000 machine is basically the equivalent of a $7,500 machine from just a

[16:13] few years ago.

[16:14] So this is the new pinball reality.

[16:16] What else is happening in pinball?

[16:18] I still have not seen a single Cactus Canyon LE unboxed.

[16:22] And I want to just say, for the record, I think Chicago Gaming Company is by far the

[16:27] worst pinball manufacturer in pinball today.

[16:31] They are the worst.

[16:32] They are the worst at communicating.

[16:34] They are the worst at getting people their product.

[16:36] They are the worst at doing everything from a marketing and sales perspective.

[16:40] They are the worst at transparency.

[16:42] Why is every single person who's in on this game completely in the dark?

[16:46] It was weeks ago where we saw, like, oh, production has begun on the LEs.

[16:50] Okay, where has it?

[16:51] Has anyone unboxed a single game?

[16:53] And why did they even show this game a year ago?

[16:55] It's just so frustrating because it just feels like they don't even care.

[16:59] Do they even care?

[17:00] Do they even have a schedule?

[17:01] Nothing seems like it matters.

[17:03] This company is being so mismanaged.

[17:05] This is worse than Hagus Pinball.

[17:07] They've got their schedule off the worst.

[17:09] I feel like even Hagus was more accurate on when they were going to get people their

[17:13] mermaid editions than these LEs of Cactus Canyon remake.

[17:16] So look, here's the thing.

[17:17] It's a weird, weird time in Pinball.

[17:19] Oh, for you Jersey Jack owners out there, your Guns N' Roses replacement playfields

[17:24] are available.

[17:26] So make sure you reach out to JJP and get your replacement playfield.

[17:30] I still have to order mine.

[17:32] I still feel somewhat annoyed.

[17:34] I have to spend $650 to buy a replacement version of something that was sold to me originally

[17:42] defective by the company, but there's nothing else I can do.

[17:46] I'm absolutely going to grab a backup upper and lower playfield of GNRCE.

[17:51] I was asked by Melissa over at CoinTaker, would I trade my Guns N' Roses number 500

[17:57] for the Big Lebowski number 69?

[18:00] And I told her no.

[18:02] And the reason why is Guns N' Roses number 500 will never leave my family.

[18:07] And I will also be owning a Big Lebowski one day.

[18:10] I don't care if it's number 69.

[18:12] Like I get the joke, but that's just stupid to me.

[18:14] I don't even care about that.

[18:16] What I told Barry is I want the last Big Lebowski he makes, and that is what we're going to

[18:22] do.

[18:23] And I'm super excited because I also need time.

[18:24] Like you know me, I have nowhere to put pinball machines, so I don't want a Big Lebowski right

[18:28] now.

[18:29] Anything else happening at Pinball Expo, I think the main thing I want to see will American

[18:33] Pinball show us something about their new game.

[18:36] I remember Franci saying October was going to be the month in which we saw this big surprise.

[18:41] Where is it?

[18:42] Where is the October Juggernaut announcement that he was talking about?

[18:47] I think it's the Dennis Nordman game, but I think it's now delayed.

[18:51] So I think this is going to be a really, really weird fall into winter because I don't think

[18:56] anyone has anything really that ready.

[18:59] I think James Bond's are going to ship incomplete, and I think that's not going to be that exciting.

[19:04] And I think the stage is set up.

[19:05] This is crazy.

[19:06] The stage is set up once again for Spooky Pinball to roll in with their new game on

[19:13] the line, and it's like shipping next week.

[19:15] They're going to do it again.

[19:17] Spooky Pinball is going to get all of the orders again, and they're absolutely going

[19:21] to hit a window in which nobody else has it figured out.

[19:25] It's just serendipitous for this company.

[19:27] And that's why I keep saying American Pinball never hits at the right time.

[19:31] Spooky Pinball always seems to find that right window to reveal a game and get everyone's

[19:36] money, and I think they're going to do it again.

[19:39] Everybody thank you for tuning in to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[19:41] I will be doing the Saturday morning spectacular this Saturday, not live from Expo.

[19:48] And I just want to say two more things.

[19:49] I think we're going to see the Keith Elwin machine next week, and we will see if this

[19:53] game is worth it.

[19:54] George Gomez says that Keith Elwin took something off of his game.

[19:58] I think it's going to be the odd job hat that spins around.

[20:01] But I don't know, man.

[20:02] The way prices are going, I'm really not excited to see $20,000 Pinball machines.

[20:07] And I want to end this podcast on a more somber note and say, Kerry Hardy, we're super sorry

[20:12] to hear the passing of your brother.

[20:14] He was way too young to leave us.

[20:16] Kerry, you are a huge member of this community, and you're like family to all of us.

[20:20] And I just want to say, brother, our hearts go out to you.

[20:23] And anytime you want to talk, brother, just hit me up.

[20:25] But I just want to say, Kerry, thank you for all you do for this community.

[20:28] Everybody, there's a lot more we should be thankful for in life than Pinball, than these

[20:31] expensive machines, than these expensive toppers.

[20:34] I mean, the most valuable thing is going to happen at Expo, and that's just people just

[20:37] hanging out and bonding and connecting.

[20:39] And so I'm going to be there with all you guys in spirit.

[20:42] Rock your Canadian gear and just have a good time.

[20:45] Enjoy each other's company, because our time on this planet is very short.

[20:49] And for you Canadian haters out there that kept me from this show, it's OK.

[20:52] I'm going to spend time with my family.

[20:54] I'm going to have a great weekend.

[20:55] And I'll be there maybe next year.

[20:57] I'll stop going to shows all together and I'll create Canada's own show.

[21:01] It's going to be great.

[21:02] Canada's huge Pinball Omicossi spectacular.

[21:04] Everybody have a great day.

[21:06] We'll talk to you soon.
