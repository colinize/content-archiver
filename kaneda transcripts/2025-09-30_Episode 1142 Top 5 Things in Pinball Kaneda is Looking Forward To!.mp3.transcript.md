[00:00] Here we go again, crying in bed with a familiar feeling, all my friends in love and I'm the

[00:10] one they call for a third wheelin'.

[01:00] 50 units made, far short of the 500, does that mean people are gonna ask for refunds or will they make

[01:08] all 500 units? We'll talk about that, we'll talk about Melvin's seminar over at Pinball Expo, which by

[01:16] the way, I wanna be on my best behavior over the next two weeks, so I don't do something stupid that

[01:23] makes them not want me at the show again. I have already been asked not to attend a few times, but I'm

[01:31] going, my tickets are booked, if you are going to Pinball Expo, we are absolutely hanging out.

[01:37] Alright, what I wanna do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I wanna give you the five things

[01:42] that Canada is looking forward to in the pinball world. What are the five things, if I think about here

[01:48] until like maybe the end of next year, what are the five things happening in the world of pinball that keeps me

[01:55] up at night? Actually, it probably puts me to sleep at night, because I wanna dream about this stuff because

[02:00] it's not real. So before we get there, I just wanna squash a rumor, there's some dude, I think his name is Enzo,

[02:07] going around saying he's got a reliable source that back to the future is off the table. So I just went and I

[02:17] asked the actual sources of the people working on this game, and it's not off the table, everything's going

[02:25] just fine. See, it's so easy for some keyboard commando guy that's got a friend, that's got a friend, that

[02:33] heard something about a company that he's got a bone to pick with, and then you just say something silly like

[02:39] that, I've got a reliable source people, that Stern Pinball is gonna raise prices. Well, guess what?

[02:46] Canada actually does have a reliable source, that Stern Pinball is going to raise prices, but when it comes to back

[02:54] to the future, a lot of you are excited about this game, a lot of you ask me for more updates, and the truth is,

[03:01] I don't know much. Melvin's not working on Back to the Future. People know that Melvin and I are friends, and I'm

[03:08] friends with Barry, but we know this, if we know one thing about Barry, he bakes a loaf on a really low heat. It takes

[03:18] him a long time to bake his bread. Barry ain't making you pizza in just a few seconds, you know, he's not throwing

[03:26] in that dough into the wood fire. His Back to the Future has been in development now for over two years, and it's still

[03:35] not done. And I don't even know if it's gonna be done by the end of next year. What I can tell you is this, those of you

[03:42] going to Pinball Expo, expecting maybe to hear about Back to the Future, expecting maybe a tease of Back to the Future,

[03:50] expecting anything around Back to the Future, you're not gonna hear anything about Back to the Future. There won't be

[03:56] anything. There won't be teasers, there won't be images, there won't be any discussion about it. They are working on the

[04:02] game, but I know that the seminar title, let's talk about Touch Pinball's future, has people thinking, oh, we're gonna hear

[04:09] about Back to the Future. So you're not, you're not. But I still think you should go hear what my boy Melvin has to say. I think

[04:15] it's gonna be exciting, and I think it's gonna be entertaining. And here's the best part about Melvin's seminar. It's only 30

[04:22] minutes. These hour-long seminars at Pinball Expo are inane. Have you been to them? Like, they sit there, hey guys, is the

[04:30] microphone working? Let's upload this PowerPoint slide that we spent no time on, and let's show you over 87 slides, how we

[04:39] made the Revolving Staircase. Let's show you how we reworked that ramp. A lot of adjustments had to be made to the

[04:46] Vuck. Let's show you right now through 18,000 slides. And the crowd, my gosh, the crowd of these seminars, dead. Dead. They just

[04:53] sit there. You know, I've been to seminars, man, where people should have been standing up and booing people off the

[04:59] stage. Like, Robert Mueller got up with John Papadook, Steve Bowden, John Norris. All these guys got up there and said they

[05:07] were gonna make more games in one year than Stern Pinball has ever made. They said something silly like that. We were gonna make

[05:12] more games in one year than every other manufacturer combined. And you know what people did? You know what people did in the

[05:18] crowd at a Pinball show? They clapped. They clapped. That's what you're dealing with, with pinheads in person. You know, it's funny

[05:27] when you read Pinside and everybody's so tough. Everybody's so stride and everybody's convictions are so loud and proud on

[05:34] Pinside. And you know what? When you see these guys in person, they're in the corner wearing the cargo shorts. You know, they'll

[05:41] walk right by Canada and they'll say nothing. And then on Pinside, if I see Canada at a show, I'm gonna tell them blah, blah, blah.

[05:47] They say nothing. You can't miss me at a show, baby. Gonna wear the Gucci. Gonna be rolling with Kale. Gonna be rolling with Rachel.

[05:55] Gonna be rolling with Retro Ralph. Retro Ralph doesn't know it yet, baby. But when I see that mofo at the show, we're gonna lock eyes, baby,

[06:04] because he needs to stare me in the eye. He needs to look me in the eye to finally forgive me. And the moment he does, I'm gonna be like,

[06:11] brother, welcome to the wolf pack and just put a Gucci trench coat around them. Light a cigar, pour him some 21-year-old Japanese whiskey,

[06:20] put my arm around and be like, you're back, baby. You're back. The only thing that lost Ralph was Ralph takes this thing seriously.

[06:28] He actually wakes up and takes pinball content seriously. Like, how can you do that? In a world in which people are dying left and right,

[06:38] people are starving, the medium income in the world is like $8,000 and the dude's taking pinball content seriously.

[06:47] You know, you gotta remember who your audience is, people who have given up on being serious. That's who buys pinball machines.

[06:55] You can't be serious. I'm a serious man and I'm gonna put, well, maybe you are if you put Star Wars Ellie in front of a window.

[07:03] Have you seen this machine? It's like sitting there in front of this arched window way. This whole wall of windows looks like a mansion, man.

[07:11] Yeah, I wish I had that guy's square footage, but not that man's taste. Do none of these men have access to women who have taste?

[07:20] That's my question. All right, you're like, you're like, what's going on in your closet? I know people. I haven't had much sleep.

[07:26] I've been working all week and I've been working since my birthday last week. It's been crazy.

[07:31] So what are the five things I'm looking forward to in pinball? Because let's face it, there's no other news.

[07:37] There's no other news right now. What's the news right now in pinball? We're all waiting for Beetlejuice.

[07:43] Beetlejuice is gonna raise the bar. It just is. I think when Beetlejuice comes out, it's gonna sell out instantly.

[07:49] It's gonna raise the bar and it's gonna make everything else that people have been throwing money at.

[07:55] It's gonna just sink the prices of all that stuff. You know how I feel? The hobby's in a very volatile place right now.

[08:02] We are oversaturated with mediocrity. There's no other way to talk about the pinball hobby right now.

[08:08] We are oversaturated with mediocrity. I do believe that's gonna change. I do believe the next three years are gonna see some of the best pinball ever.

[08:17] But right now, we are oversaturated with mediocrity and there's a lot of dudes holding on to a lot of pins that are losing so much money every month.

[08:28] And when they want to get the new stuff that's gonna be great, they're gonna have to sell these and that's gonna add more oversaturation to this hobby.

[08:37] I think it's very volatile. I think right now, what I love about pinball right now, collecting is over really.

[08:43] Like, you know, no one really cares anymore if you got a CE or an LE. No one cares. No one cares.

[08:48] We are now at a new stage in pinball. Just buy what makes you happy. Don't care about what other people think about it.

[08:55] The flexing is over. There's no more flexing. Nobody cares. When I watch people unbox all of these machines, nobody cares.

[09:02] Nobody cares about a Big Bang Bar remake. There's a lot of that going back and forth.

[09:06] Melvin made an amazing prototype of the game. He handed it to Padredy Gaming and they're not gonna implement his amazing changes.

[09:15] He would have made the game stunning. They're gonna make it more pedestrian like it was originally. They're not gonna enhance it.

[09:21] The reason why CGC games are so awesome is they made the original games better. Padredy Gaming does not know how to do that.

[09:29] I don't know why Rick is handing to Padredy Gaming. Toden, Theater of Magic, Big Bang Bar, Adams Family, and Circus Voltaire.

[09:38] Nobody really feels like Padredy Gaming is where it's at. The other thing they're gonna do is they're gonna redo the artwork.

[09:45] Brian Allen's gonna do the artwork on games like Toden. If there's one game that doesn't need a new art package, it's Toden.

[09:52] So again, I don't know why they're doing these things. The strategy doesn't make much sense.

[09:57] And I think the consumers are gonna respond to this stuff the same way they responded to Funhaus.

[10:03] And that is nobody's buying this stuff. And Rick, what he should have done is gone to American Pinball and had them be the other company that makes his IPs.

[10:14] Not Padredy Gaming. So I just think this thing is ill-conceived and I think consumers are not gonna show up.

[10:21] Damn, Canada, when you actually just start spitting the truth like this, this is why we subscribe.

[10:26] Alright, what are my top five things that I'm excited about in the world of Pinball?

[10:31] Number five, the big trouble in little China homebrew game. I can't wait to see what this guy is working on.

[10:40] He did the Tony Hawk game. It was amazing. I think he also did Friday the 13th. I don't know if that's right or wrong, but man, I can't wait to see this game.

[10:49] And the reason why, other than the fact that I love the theme and when he does it, he's gonna have all the clips from the movie.

[10:55] He doesn't have to ask permission. He can just let passion guide the project.

[11:00] The other reason I'm so excited is I do think the most creativity happening in the world of Pinball is happening at the homebrew level.

[11:09] And I also think that the only place we're gonna find the next Keith Elwin is in the homebrew aisle at a show.

[11:17] And so these guys are the future. And if you're a pinball manufacturer and you're tired of the same old fan layouts and you want to inject new life into your company,

[11:28] this is who you should be looking at. And these guys, because I do believe that homebrew machines are basically a resume to land a job

[11:38] with a major manufacturer. So I can't wait to see this game. I can't wait to see how he implements Jack Burden and Lopan and all the stuff of that world.

[11:48] It's such a perfect campy theme for Pinball. My dream is, is that he makes this game.

[11:54] And because Spooky Pinball has a relationship with John Carpenter, that they find a way to make it.

[12:01] If Spooky Pinball, through their John Carpenter relationship, can get to Kurt Russell and make this game, I will spend $20,000 on it.

[12:12] Spooky, I will buy all 999 units. By the way, I heard from Luke, we're absolutely cool.

[12:21] He totally appreciated the advice I gave him. And you know, he just had a pin-side moment, but all is going well over there.

[12:29] All these evil deads are not experiencing playfield bulge. So if you have one, you're fine.

[12:35] Number four on the thing that Canada is the most excited about looking forward into pinball is back to the future.

[12:45] There's no way around this. This movie, I've seen it like hundreds of times.

[12:52] And I know this game is based on all three movies, which I'm okay with because it's technically a trilogy.

[13:00] I really think there's going to be an emphasis on one and two. I would rather have all three than having just back to the future one and not back to the future two.

[13:11] So I am so excited for this game because it's just one of those games that just connects with me.

[13:19] I need to own it back to the future. Now, I also have Faith and Barry and team and Joe Kamnikau that they're going to do it right.

[13:28] They're going to have Michael J. Fox in it. These rumors that like Michael J. Fox is not going to be affiliated with the game.

[13:34] He's probably not going to give you custom call-outs for obvious reasons, but they're going to get everything into this game.

[13:41] And I know it's going to be a while until I get it. And that's another reason why it's something I'm looking forward to.

[13:48] Because I know I'm not going to have to buy it anytime soon. It's great, right? It's great.

[13:54] I feel like I'm going to be alive long enough to get my hands on it, but I'm not going to have to write a check anytime soon.

[14:01] And knowing that Dutch can't make many, I do feel like this game could be like $15,000, only one version of it, and they will sell every single one.

[14:09] And then they can make 88 SLEs. Barry, if you're listening, just make 88 SLEs for $20,000 and sell every single one for everybody listening right now.

[14:21] There's only going to be 87 SLEs available for $20,000 because Canada's got game number 88.

[14:28] That's how you do it, Barry. Just unapologetically, do it, brother. Do it. We're going to do it anyway, brother.

[14:35] The number three thing that Canada is looking forward to in the world of pinball is stern increasing prices.

[14:44] I am so excited to see this. You know, as someone who loves to watch companies make bone-headed marketing moves,

[14:53] there will never be in the history of everything I've covered in pinball a greater bone-headed move than stern pinball in 2025.

[15:04] Maybe early 2026, increasing the price of their product as demand for their product continues to decline.

[15:12] They are going to raise prices on a platform that doesn't look much different than the old platform.

[15:19] Spike 3 is not some big leap forward. And yet they are going to increase prices as their consumers are losing thousands now on every single stern they buy.

[15:32] This is going to be fun to watch. I have my popcorn ready. You're like, Canada, wait, one of the things you're looking forward to is a company make...

[15:39] Yeah, yes, I am. Because it is going to have such a high entertainment level.

[15:44] And think about it, the beautiful thing for each and every one of us. When stern does this, it's going to make it so much easier not to spend money.

[15:53] Half of what a financial advisor, and I feel like I'm sort of like your therapist.

[15:57] I'm like quasi your pinball therapist giving you some financial advice on what you should buy.

[16:03] Half of what a financial advisor or therapist, half of our job, if you will, is to give you good advice.

[16:10] And in the world of pinball, good advice is what to get and what to avoid.

[16:16] And I'm just telling you, when stern raises its prices, I would avoid them at all costs.

[16:22] Because if we all stop buying, they're not going to go out of business, they're just going to lower prices.

[16:27] You all know that to be the truth. They don't need to raise their prices to stay in business.

[16:32] For stern to stay in business, they need to lower their prices and pick better themes and make less games a year.

[16:41] When I say less games a year, I don't mean by volume. Stop trying to do three cornerstones a year.

[16:48] Just make two amazing games a year where you focus on those two games and give those games more resources and more bomb.

[16:58] And you will make more money in the long run.

[17:01] And then do one remastered game a year. Make three total games a year and make those games spectacular.

[17:10] And your line will never stop operating.

[17:14] The way they're doing it now isn't working. Games are rushed. IPs are not strong enough.

[17:21] And the remastered strategy is all over the place. Sturn pinball needs a hard reset.

[17:27] So go ahead, George. Go ahead, Seth. Go ahead, Gary. Raise those prices, baby.

[17:34] I got my popcorn ready. I can't wait to see people laugh in your faces.

[17:39] Alright, what's the number two thing that Canada is looking forward to in the pinball world?

[17:45] I hear Cassie and crying, so we're going to wrap this up in just a little bit.

[17:48] The number two thing I'm looking forward to, Steve Richie's Sonic the Hedgehog.

[17:52] I really, really, really have been thinking a lot about, you know, out of all the themes that are in the mix,

[17:58] we've got Sonic, we've got Pokémon, we've got Back to the Future.

[18:02] The reason why I think Sonic to me is going to be the game is really the theme.

[18:09] It's perfect for pinball. Sonic is a pinball basically flying around his world,

[18:15] hitting pop bumpers, doing loop-de-loops, jumping, collecting coins. It's all about speed.

[18:21] And then you've got the designer who's the greatest designer ever, who knows how to work with speed and flow.

[18:27] And you give Steve Richie finally a campy, fun, universal theme like Sonic.

[18:33] You base it on the iconic Sega Genesis version of Sonic, or the old video game classic version of Sonic.

[18:42] And I don't know how to not smile from ear to ear.

[18:45] I grew up with Sonic. I love Sonic. I don't love the new movies. I don't relate to that.

[18:52] So when I heard that this is based on the original version of Sonic and it's Steve Richie's greatest layout,

[19:00] and it's going to be a Jersey Jack game, I mean, when you look at the Jersey Jack game,

[19:07] I mean, come on, Stern, you know you can't raise prices.

[19:10] Stern Pinball, you need to look at a Jersey Jack machine and say,

[19:14] we can't raise prices until our game looks this nice.

[19:19] And so I think Steve Richie is going to have a little bit of a statement game like no other with this.

[19:25] I think it's going to be bonkers. And also because it's not going to be limited,

[19:29] I think they're going to do the same thing as Harry Potter.

[19:32] There's not going to be like some frenzy where I have to get it now.

[19:35] I think it's just going to be a game that we're all going to want.

[19:38] All right, there we go. Sonic the Hedgehog. When do I think it's going to come out?

[19:43] Oh man, that's a good question, Kaneda. Keep asking questions of yourself. That's not weird.

[19:48] I don't think we're going to see it until Expo of next year. I really don't.

[19:51] I really don't. Harry Potter sales are just insane and they're going to keep going

[19:57] and there's going to be enough Potter orders to take them through almost all of next year.

[20:01] So I don't think it's coming out until end of next year.

[20:05] All right, the number one thing I'm looking forward to in Pinball, the number one thing.

[20:10] What is it, Kaneda? It's three words. Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

[20:17] If you don't turn on that game by saying Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,

[20:22] I'm leaving for just a day though. I'm coming back. I'm not leaving for good.

[20:25] I'm leaving for just a day. It kind of would be hard to do that outside of a home location,

[20:30] but it would be super cool if it was an add-on or something like that.

[20:34] I just can't wait for Beetlejuice. I'm so excited to see this game.

[20:37] I think Spooky Pinball is going to drop the mic.

[20:40] I think they're going to have a statement game like we've never seen before.

[20:44] I think it's going to sell out in nine minutes.

[20:47] I think everyone else, Gary, George, David Vaness, Padready, the Pinball brothers who aren't brothers,

[20:55] everybody else who's making Pinball machines, Rick,

[20:58] I think everybody else is going to realize one simple thing.

[21:01] That this hobby and this kind of amusement device, this thing we love called Pinball,

[21:07] the number one thing that will always rise to the top is passion.

[21:11] And I know this all too well. There is no way for passion to win out in a company

[21:16] when you're filled with too many committees.

[21:19] There's no way for passion to survive in a company when there's too much pressure.

[21:24] There's no way for passion to flourish when there's too many legacy people there with opinions.

[21:30] I think Spooky Pinball is a place now where passion isn't just alive and well.

[21:36] Passion is thriving. And I don't feel that over at Stern anymore.

[21:40] I feel like the opposite. I feel when I talk to my Stern friends, they feel anxious.

[21:45] They feel stressed. They feel like they're trying to convince me it's otherwise.

[21:50] And I know it's not. I know stories of very well-known people over there wanting to leave,

[21:56] resigning, doing different things.

[21:58] When I talk to Zambietti, he's mad at me.

[22:01] Franchi's not mad at me. Franchi and I are going to sip champagne at Expo.

[22:05] When I talk to David Van Es, I always feel like he's trying to convince me he made the right moves.

[22:10] He knows he didn't make the right moves.

[22:12] Dune has not even sold close to 800 units. And Spooky's going to sell 1,000 in 9 minutes.

[22:19] And so that's the thing about Spooky. The thing I love about them is they don't have to do all this talk.

[22:25] They're just making what I believe to be the most passionate pinball product in the world right now.

[22:32] And the reason I believe that is they've been through the gutter.

[22:36] They've been through all those years of failing. And they've learned through all those failures.

[22:42] And I've witnessed all those failures. And I've seen them grow not just as a company, but as people.

[22:50] And I've seen what they're capable of. And I think they're the only company right now.

[22:55] And I mean this. They're the only company that is defying the expectations of the organization.

[23:03] And I love that. And I spend every day of my life fighting every single day to let just a little bit of my passion survive during my main job every day.

[23:16] It's so hard. I go up against committees, skepticism, Gen Z kids who have never seen any of the movies I grew up with.

[23:24] I battle this every day. And it's a miracle if I can get a few ideas out the door a year.

[23:31] And that is why as someone who goes through that on a daily basis, I support and can't wait to see this game because I know what it's going to be.

[23:41] I know it's going to be a labor of love. I know it's going to have everything they want in it.

[23:47] And I know they're not going to stop until every ounce of the passion they have and the soul they have makes its way into this game.

[23:56] And I just don't feel that from the other manufacturers. I think second would be Jersey Jack.

[24:02] I think Jersey Jack is a place when I talk to people over there, they're having a good time.

[24:08] And that is why I do believe this. I think there's a short window where some of these stern guys might have a chance to join up with JJP.

[24:16] But when that door closes, I'm telling you, there's not going to be many places you want to be.

[24:22] I know Dutch Pinball is building their games with passion and they take forever.

[24:27] When I talk to the people over there, I don't think that's a toxic environment.

[24:31] Yes, of course, like barrels. I know you guys are putting all of your passion into it.

[24:36] But also for passion to flourish, for passion to be successful and profitable in Pinball, you have to make the right decisions.

[24:44] And I think Beetlejuice is the perfect decision. And I think the fact that Stern Pinball passed on Beetlejuice and this lackluster Star Wars is what they're putting in the world.

[24:57] And Spooky's going to put Beetlejuice in the world for $9,999. I love that. And that is the number one thing I can't wait to see.

[25:08] And we're going to see it soon.

[25:10] Canada out.

[25:40] .
