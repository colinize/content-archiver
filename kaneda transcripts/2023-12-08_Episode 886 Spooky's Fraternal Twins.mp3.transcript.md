[00:00] You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be.

[00:04] I'm all grown up now, baby, can't you see?

[00:08] Stacey's mom has got it going on.

[00:12] She's all I want and I've waited for so long.

[00:20] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] Lots to talk about on this episode.

[00:26] We now see so many more of the features in freaking the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Looney Tunes.

[00:33] Spooky Pinball I think has succeeded this time around on making two games off the same design.

[00:41] Feel like radically different games.

[00:43] And I'm looking down at these two games.

[00:45] Obviously like the subject matter are so radically different.

[00:49] But unlike Ultraman and Halloween where like clearly those playfields were exactly the same.

[00:55] All the way down to the inserts.

[00:58] And so that's why those games felt too similar, right?

[01:01] And then the mechanisms on the left side, you had the weird stuff happening with the in lane ball guides in those two games.

[01:07] Just everything about those games felt like they took a blank piece of wood and they sent it off to like a printer and they just printed two different themes on top of the same exact game.

[01:18] But this game, they went a step further.

[01:21] They changed the inserts.

[01:22] They made these games look so different.

[01:26] And even some of the sculpts are in different parts of the game.

[01:29] When I look at them, of course, the ball pathways are the same.

[01:33] And for the most part, the inserts are in the same locations, but they're different inserts.

[01:37] Like Texas Chainsaw Massacre might have some square inserts over here.

[01:41] And Tasmanian Devil has like lightning bolt inserts that fit the theme much better.

[01:47] So I want to say to Spooky Pimball and the crew over there, we are happy that you went the extra mile to really differentiate these games.

[01:54] And also it's not just going to end there.

[01:56] The real differentiation is going to happen in the storylines and the narrative of these games where I don't think playing both of them is going to feel similar.

[02:06] See, with Ultraman and Halloween, it's like they came up with a code structure and then they had to jam both themes into that code structure exactly the same it felt like.

[02:15] But this feels like two separate games.

[02:19] And the only thing they're really sharing is the shot geometry.

[02:23] But the rest of it feels very unique to each theme itself.

[02:27] And the main thing about these two games, and when they talk about the featurettes and I joined the Q&A and I've heard everything that they've said about these games,

[02:35] the main thing is they got the assets.

[02:37] And that is super important.

[02:38] We haven't seen a ton of assets yet from the Looney Tunes, but we know there's something like 20 episodes of the Looney Tunes will be represented in the game.

[02:48] And it sounds like they have everything they want from Texas Chainsaw Massacre from the movie from 1974.

[02:56] And when I say everything, I mean, you're going to see the iconic scenes you remember and the voices in the video clips will sync up with each other, which is super important.

[03:07] Remember, we didn't get that with Halloween.

[03:09] Halloween felt like it was a little bit of a licensing nightmare and they couldn't put everything they wanted into the game.

[03:15] And I think that really affected Halloween.

[03:18] And for you horror fans out there, I think we're going to see Halloween prices just plummet.

[03:23] I mean, especially when the crew from Spooky is going on and saying, we've learned our lessons, we've made it better.

[03:29] And look, I'm all for people improving in life.

[03:32] You see, you hear the feedback.

[03:34] You hear what the people want.

[03:35] And instead of going in the wrong direction and canceling the content creator categories and saying the ship is sailed, you're supposed to hear the feedback in life and get better and make improvements.

[03:47] And I think that's what Spooky has done here.

[03:49] The other thing too is the other reason why we're looking at these games so radically different.

[03:54] These themes couldn't be so radically different from each other.

[03:58] Even just watching like some of the footage from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is such a creepy movie.

[04:04] The trailer that was put together by Greg and Zach, I mean, it does give me the chills.

[04:09] It's like just even watching three minutes of that movie gives you the chills.

[04:14] There's just something creepy about that film.

[04:16] And so I believe it when they say it, this is going to be the scariest pinball machine of all time.

[04:22] Now, we know more details about the game.

[04:25] You are playing as the family in the film and you are the killer.

[04:30] You are trying to murder these kids and so you're not trying to escape.

[04:33] Now, look, here's why I think that makes sense.

[04:36] So think about it.

[04:36] If you want to translate and theme integrate Texas Chainsaw Massacre into a pinball experience in which you're going through different modes

[04:44] and the modes are synced up with the movie, the reason why it would make no sense to play as the teenagers trying to escape

[04:52] because they do not escape in the movie.

[04:55] So how could you progress through a mode and end up escaping the clutches of all the people in the family?

[05:01] So it makes total sense that you are the family and unbeknownst to these young beautiful children.

[05:07] They don't know what they've stumbled into and they're not going to get out and they're going to get hung on a meat hook

[05:13] and they're going to end up getting kidnapped at a gas station.

[05:15] All the different weird stuff that happens in the movie.

[05:17] I'm not going to lie.

[05:18] I haven't seen this movie in a really long time because I think I saw it once and it freaked me out and it's not something that I love.

[05:24] I'm not one of these people that watches movies like The Hills Have Eyes.

[05:27] I like scary movies.

[05:29] I do not like horror movies.

[05:31] I really do freak me out.

[05:32] And the other thing that we haven't really seen much of that I think is really going to define this Texas Chainsaw game is going to be the music.

[05:40] It's going to be the atmospheric stuff that happens in this game.

[05:44] I think this is going to be the kind of game where in a dark room late at night and you turn it on.

[05:50] It's really going to freak people out and it's really going to be scary.

[05:53] And I think fans of this genre are super happy with what they're seeing.

[05:57] All right.

[05:58] And then we go over to Looney Tunes.

[05:59] It's like the weirdest segue.

[06:00] We're talking about one of the creepiest movies ever.

[06:03] And let me talk to you next about Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the Tasmanian Devil.

[06:07] You know, you couldn't get a radically different theme and Looney Tunes just looks so fun.

[06:13] It looks like the perfect game to follow up Scooby-Doo with.

[06:16] It's bright.

[06:17] It's colorful.

[06:17] It's got acne factory.

[06:19] It's got 20 episodes from the Looney Tunes.

[06:22] It's got all the iconic characters in this game and look, it just looks like a ton of fun.

[06:26] And the storyline in this game is different.

[06:29] The storyline in this game is something happens in the acne factory and you have to go fix

[06:33] everything and then reassemble all those iconic cartoon shows.

[06:37] And if you do it right, you then get to watch some of those iconic Looney Tunes cartoon

[06:42] shows that everybody remembers.

[06:44] And that's what I know about Looney Tunes.

[06:47] I love the way both of these games are theme integrating into the games themselves.

[06:52] And look, I've always been someone who said you should design a game from the ground up

[06:56] to be the theme itself.

[06:58] And clearly, yes, like there's not like a mechanism in either game that screams like

[07:05] you designed this mechanism for Texas Chainsaw, right?

[07:08] There's not a physical chainsaw in the game.

[07:11] The meat hook ball lock area of the game is still kind of flat plastic with the balls

[07:16] just being dropped into a ball lock area.

[07:19] So there's still not their spooky pinball from a mechanical toy standpoint.

[07:24] They're not really making complex mechanical toys that interact with the ball.

[07:29] And so they decided to make a decision to focus not on upper playfields.

[07:34] They wanted to make a game that had a lot of speed, had a lot of flow, had a lot of

[07:38] combos. I think it was a very smart decision because if you go back and look at most of

[07:43] spooky's games, most of the complaints have usually been about like the game being a

[07:48] brick fest, the game not having great flow.

[07:51] Yes, we've always complained about the toys, but I think they finally have a layout

[07:55] that looks really fun to shoot.

[07:57] There's a lot of different things to aim for.

[07:59] There's a lot of ball pass.

[08:00] There's a lot of different wire forms.

[08:01] There's four flippers, I believe.

[08:03] And what I'm curious now is to see someone play this game because still in the videos,

[08:08] it's hard to get a sense of how fast this game is going to play.

[08:11] It doesn't look like it's going to play as fast as a stern machine.

[08:15] So more to come on that.

[08:16] But I think it was a smart decision for this company to say, Hey, our mission with

[08:20] this game is to make the best shooting game we've ever made.

[08:23] We're going to focus on gameplay.

[08:25] Now, look, gameplay is subjective.

[08:26] We don't know yet.

[08:28] We don't know yet.

[08:29] And that begs the question next.

[08:31] Sales are opening up for this game in like an hour.

[08:34] They are making 888 of each game.

[08:37] Are they going to sell out of each game on day one?

[08:40] I don't think so.

[08:41] That's still a lot of game.

[08:43] And these two themes are still not like take my money now for most people out there

[08:48] in the pinball world.

[08:49] Let's face it. If you have young kids, you're not putting Texas Chainsaw

[08:53] Massacre into the house.

[08:55] Now, if you have young kids, you might want to put Looney Tunes into the house,

[08:58] but your kids might not even be into Looney Tunes.

[09:01] It's a very campy theme.

[09:03] So I'm not sure, you know, how many men 40 to 60 wake up and want Looney Tunes?

[09:08] How many men in this demographic want Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

[09:12] Now, look, the horror genre is very popular.

[09:15] People love animated stuff like the Looney Tunes.

[09:18] So yes, absolutely in the world, there are way more than 888 fanatics

[09:23] surrounding both of these IPs.

[09:25] And so the market will ultimately show us how popular of this decision was.

[09:29] Here's my take on all of it.

[09:31] I just think the pinball market has changed a lot.

[09:33] I don't think people want to give a ton of non refundable deposits.

[09:37] The game's not going to be on the line for at least a couple of months.

[09:40] And so are people going to want to lock in their orders now?

[09:44] And if history has proven anything, if you just wait,

[09:48] you'll still be able to cut the line because what we've seen in the past

[09:51] and we've seen it with Scooby-Doo distributors are going to get some of these games.

[09:55] They're going to bring them to shows.

[09:57] They're going to bring them to like T.P.F.

[09:59] and other shows happening in early 2024.

[10:02] You're going to be able to buy some of those games off the show floor for a little

[10:06] bit of a discount, your ability to cut the line and get the game in front of people

[10:11] who lock in their non refundable deposits has proven to be the case time and time again.

[10:17] The other thing that's going to happen is we're going to see jaws.

[10:20] People are going to start paying for their pulp fictions.

[10:23] How long will these spooky games hold their value?

[10:26] And will we start to see some of them trade on the second hand market for less money

[10:30] than MSRP? You know, because if you do option these things out and you get the

[10:34] butter cabinet and you put all the bells and whistles on these collectors additions,

[10:38] they're getting close to $13,000, which is the price of a Stern limited addition.

[10:44] And again, Stern, L.E.s have held their value more than spooky pinball collectors

[10:50] addition games, but again, only 888.

[10:53] So there's always going to be less of these games in the world than a Stern L.E.

[10:58] than a Jersey Jack collectors edition.

[11:01] So I'm excited for these guys.

[11:02] I will say this, I'm excited for the gang over at spooky.

[11:05] I will say this as a marketer, as a communicator, I was there with the Q&A last night.

[11:10] These two, Bugg and Luke, they know how to win over people.

[11:14] They know how to talk to their community.

[11:16] They know how to create goodwill.

[11:18] Now, there's one thing they have to do because I was reading pin side.

[11:21] I'm still hearing stories about people having customer service issues with spooky emails,

[11:28] not getting responded to people waiting months for a phone call back.

[11:33] I know that's not everybody's experience, but Bugg and Luke, you guys are now big enough.

[11:38] You're at the point now where even though you have like around 2000 customers,

[11:43] you need to make sure that nobody, nobody has their inquiry go unanswered for a long period of time.

[11:50] It's really important.

[11:52] You know, customer service at this level now is critical in making sure that you don't have

[11:58] people who have a bad experience with the brand.

[12:01] So I think that's the other thing.

[12:02] Mechanical toys and get the customer service to a point now where we're not hearing people

[12:08] say that anymore.

[12:09] Redirect all requests to Canadian pinball podcast at gmail.com.

[12:13] I'll handle all of your incoming requests and I'll make sure that guy at least gets a response.

[12:18] We got your email.

[12:19] We're going to get back to you this week.

[12:20] And if you tell someone you're going to get back to them that week, get back to them that week.

[12:24] All right.

[12:24] What else is going on in pinball?

[12:26] You know, I forgot to mention that David Fix did an interview and he said that American

[12:31] pinball makes 300 games a year.

[12:34] And then the next thing out of his mouth was that they make 15 games a day.

[12:38] Now, 15 games a day is basically over 5000 games a year.

[12:43] So someone needs to remind David Fix that that math does not add up.

[12:48] Here's what I think is happening over at AP.

[12:50] They've flatlined the sales for galactic tank force are done.

[12:54] They don't have the next game ready to go.

[12:56] And I've been hearing that he has to get these galactic tank forces sold or they will

[13:01] not be moving on to the next title.

[13:02] Now, if that's not accurate, then, you know, release the next title because what are

[13:06] they going to do? Think about it. It is basically it is December.

[13:10] We are going into Jaws, pinball period.

[13:12] We're going into Pulp Fiction Purchasing period.

[13:15] We're going into Freak in Texas, Chainsaw Massacre and Looney Tunes.

[13:19] All of these games are new.

[13:20] All of these games are going to be available.

[13:22] Your game's been out for over 10 months.

[13:25] People don't want it.

[13:26] People are not going to want it now that these new games are out and your game does

[13:30] not execute on pinball as well as what Spooky Pinball just dropped, as well as

[13:35] Jersey Jack just dropped, as well as Stern Pinball just dropped, as well as Chicago

[13:39] Gaming Company and Play Mechanics just dropped.

[13:41] So answer me this, David Fix, where do you think these new customers are going to come from?

[13:47] They're not going to just materialize because you do a couple of podcasts.

[13:51] There's nothing new about this game.

[13:53] You're never going to have a radical code update to a theme like this.

[13:57] You're never going to be able to get people emotionally connected to your product.

[14:01] Your only answer is to make another game.

[14:04] But if your next game is a Barry O Tribute game, why would you even bother?

[14:09] If you have any freaking license theme with some assets you need to make that game next,

[14:15] your company will not survive two more unlicensed themes.

[14:20] And for the love of pinball, stop acting like the past is the future.

[14:26] Nobody cares about Barry O or Dennis Nordman.

[14:30] They care about great games.

[14:32] Nobody cares.

[14:34] You think people are waking up and going to put money aside because they want to give

[14:38] a tribute payment to Barry O?

[14:41] I've been in this hobby for 10 years.

[14:43] How many games has Barry O made even when he was around?

[14:47] And I know he had a tragic ending and had all these medical conditions and I feel bad for the guy.

[14:51] He didn't really end up doing much.

[14:53] He made great games in the 90s, but the 90s are over.

[14:57] Dennis Nordman, he made Elvira for Stern, which was great.

[15:01] But then he went over the deep root.

[15:02] They both were over at deep root for like two to three years and had absolutely nothing to show for it.

[15:07] And I know we're going to get the Whitewood or Sequel that Dennis was working on over at freaking deep root.

[15:13] But this is not the way forward.

[15:15] If you have He-Man, make He-Man.

[15:17] If you have the Princess Bride, make that game.

[15:20] Because if Spooky is firing like this and Barrels of Fun is now going to fire the way they fire, you're done.

[15:27] You are losing the boutique battle with themes nobody wants and executions that are just done poorly.

[15:33] And there's no way out unless they make a great game.

[15:36] All right, let's talk about something else I saw that was funny.

[15:38] So let me ask you a question.

[15:40] Do you think it's cheating or not?

[15:42] If you add a mod to a game that completely changes the gameplay of the game?

[15:47] You know, like that Jerry ramp in Rick and Morty where you can like shortcut to going into the garage?

[15:52] That's kind of cheating, right?

[15:54] I saw a recent one in James Bond.

[15:56] So somebody made a mod in James Bond for the left side of the game.

[16:01] You know where the scuba tank battle is happening?

[16:04] Instead of the ball randomly kicking the ball out onto the play field, someone has made a mod so that every time you go into that area,

[16:12] instead of the ball randomly being kicked out, it is shot upward into a wire form and perfectly fed to the left flipper every single time.

[16:21] They've removed randomness from the game and they've made it much more safe for the player now because every single time the ball goes there,

[16:30] you're going to get a clean shot off the left flipper.

[16:33] The game was not designed like that.

[16:35] George Gomez did not design it like that.

[16:37] He put in some randomness into the game.

[16:40] They've now removed.

[16:41] And look, people are ordering it.

[16:43] They're putting it in their game.

[16:45] But is that not now cheating?

[16:46] Like how can you have Stern Insider connected and leaderboards and all this stuff?

[16:50] Because that's cheating because people who have this mod now have a much easier time hitting shots.

[16:56] They have an easier time not draining and easier time doing this, this and this.

[17:00] You now have an unfair advantage over people who are not using that mod.

[17:05] Now, I know it's your pinball machine.

[17:07] It's in your home.

[17:08] And if you want to make the game more fun, then sure, you could add that mod.

[17:11] And that's the devil's argument.

[17:13] Excuse, I want the game to be more fun.

[17:16] The random kick out is not fun.

[17:18] It creates a lot of cheap drains.

[17:20] So all I did was add something to my game to avoid all of those cheap drains from the game.

[17:25] And I paid all this money and I want to make my game as fun as possible.

[17:29] Sure, I mean, you could do that, right?

[17:31] You could do that.

[17:32] You could add a center post to freaking Ghostbusters.

[17:35] You could close in the out lanes a little bit on every game by drilling a hole.

[17:39] I mean, you might as well just take the glass off and play the game and never let it drain.

[17:43] I mean, isn't that the most fun?

[17:44] It was just funny seeing that mod and seeing, you know, people justify it.

[17:48] And again, like I would just always feel like I was cheating.

[17:51] If I played a game where I added something that really significantly changed the gameplay,

[17:56] I would always feel a little bit like I was riding a bike with training wheels on.

[18:01] All right, what else is going on in Pinball?

[18:03] Happy Friday, everybody.

[18:04] All right, let's end this show by saying I've made a decision.

[18:07] I've made a decision on all this tippy drama.

[18:10] We're going to turn these lemons into lemonade.

[18:13] Here's what we're going to do.

[18:14] I am going to create not a canada's pinball awards show.

[18:17] I am going to set up a system in which everybody the pinball public.

[18:22] We're going to call it the pinballs people choice awards of 2023.

[18:27] What I'm going to do is I'm going to create a way for everybody to vote on what your

[18:33] favorite things were in pinball in 2023.

[18:37] It's going to happen in December.

[18:39] You're going to be able to place your votes for everything.

[18:41] We might adjust a few things here and there.

[18:43] Like I think there should be best pinball news site.

[18:46] I think it should be best pinball, mech or toy, the single mech or toy.

[18:50] That's the most impressive.

[18:52] I think stuff like that.

[18:53] I don't want to remove categories.

[18:55] You know, so when it comes to like best location and stuff like that,

[18:58] we'll just keep everything in after everything that's happened this year.

[19:02] I don't want to be a guy that like starts removing stuff.

[19:05] But the one thing I will remove, I will recuse myself from pinball podcasting and

[19:11] pinball streaming again, because I just want this to be a fun time seeing what

[19:16] everybody loves.

[19:17] It's not about me winning an award.

[19:19] I just want us to sort of at the end of the year celebrate what everybody loves

[19:24] about pinball.

[19:25] And I've never liked the fact that at the end of the year we vote on something

[19:29] and then we have to wait three freaking months to get the results.

[19:32] So look for this coming soon, people.

[19:34] This month you're going to be able to vote.

[19:36] Everyone's going to be able to vote.

[19:37] There's not going to be any paywall required and we're going to have a really

[19:41] fun time.

[19:42] And then what I want to do in December, most likely the week before Christmas

[19:46] and New Year's, we will do the Pinball's people choice awards 2023.

[19:52] It'll be a live stream.

[19:53] This is going to be low lift, not high production quality thing like Greg and

[19:57] Zach would do, but it's just going to be a fun, probably our long show in which

[20:02] we go over what everybody selected and we congratulate each and every winner.

[20:08] And we just have fun at the end of the year and talk about 2023 games and the

[20:14] content creators in the year in which they were relevant and did the stuff we

[20:18] are recognizing them for.

[20:20] And yes, we're going to have like best new pinball content creators and stuff

[20:24] like that.

[20:25] I want to make sure that all these hardworking people in pinball content

[20:29] creation actually have an ability to be recognized and I don't need the award

[20:33] and I wish cooler heads would have prevailed, but that's not the case people.

[20:37] So we're going to do this.
