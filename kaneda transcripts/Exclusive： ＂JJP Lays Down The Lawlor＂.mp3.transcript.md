[00:00] I gotta play a British kid in!

[00:02] Yeah!

[00:03] Chose one!

[00:05] Make a bank!

[00:07] Let's double your money and then make a stake!

[00:10] Oh man, we're on to the next one already.

[00:18] I'm gonna drop a little bit of an exclusive bit of information for you guys just to end

[00:23] all of the speculation.

[00:25] Can we just get to the truth of the matter?

[00:28] I gotta get to work in like five minutes so I'm gonna drop it like it's freaking hot

[00:32] right now.

[00:33] Here's the deal.

[00:35] All of you wondering what's going on with Jersey Jack Pimbal?

[00:38] What are gonna be the next moves at Jersey Jack Pimbal?

[00:40] Well we've been speculating on this show for a long time and I'm just here to clarify

[00:45] what exactly is going to happen and we were right all along but I just want to confirm

[00:50] for all of you out there the way it's gonna go over the next few months at Jersey Jack

[00:54] Pimbal.

[00:55] Let me tell you this before I say it I think this company is team itself up to knock

[01:01] it out of the F in park.

[01:03] All right so here's the deal.

[01:04] The next game coming out from Jersey Jack Pimbal is Wizard of Oz.

[01:09] It's the Yellow brick road edition.

[01:10] We are most likely going to see that at Texas Pimbal Festival.

[01:15] All right and I'm hearing 250 of them will be made and as you heard from Joe Newhart

[01:21] they are not gonna be pro versions where stuff is yanked out.

[01:25] Stuff might be adjusted and improved upon because remember they've been working on the

[01:28] game for years but here we go now it's kind of funny because now this is gonna be the

[01:33] real collector's edition.

[01:35] It sounds like of the Wizard of Oz Pimbal if only a few more are left to run.

[01:40] There might be a run on these things because these are gonna be the ones maybe everybody

[01:43] wants.

[01:44] Will they be?

[01:45] Who knows there's been so many limited edition wases.

[01:47] Now after that we are going to get Willie Wonka but before then I want to say something

[01:54] yes the rumors are true that pirates of the Caribbean will no longer be in production

[02:00] starting in March.

[02:02] Now what does that mean for pirates?

[02:04] Doesn't mean they'll never make it again.

[02:06] It doesn't mean that but it could mean that and we could actually see pirates of the

[02:11] Caribbean.

[02:12] A game that people are now saying is one of the greatest of all time we could see there

[02:16] being very few of them out there and what will that do to the second hand value of pirates

[02:21] of the Caribbean.

[02:23] I can see the owners are like who love the machine they're kind of really excited by

[02:27] this the game might go out of production so quickly but the reason why production will

[02:32] stop on pirates is to make the Wizard of Oz's and then that paves the way for the next

[02:38] game which is Willie Wonka it is definitely going to be Willie Wonka alright and then the

[02:46] game after that is most likely going to be toy story.

[02:52] Now here's the thing here's the thing I want to just like drop on all you mofos just

[02:56] so you kind of stop speculating toy story and Willie Wonka are both being designed by

[03:04] Pat Lawler alright not Eric Pat and Lawler are doing it those two guys they're one guy

[03:14] the Pat Lawler will be doing Willie Wonka and toy story and I hear they're both standard

[03:20] body machines okay so here's here's what happened and we know this because we covered

[03:26] this before this isn't news but I think sometimes you have to go back and remind people

[03:29] what actually occurred so the reality is this toy story was supposed to be in front of

[03:36] Willie Wonka toy story was supposed to come out to a line with the movie coming out this

[03:42] summer but something happened you know what happened the deal they inked for toy story

[03:48] was the same deal they inked for pirates of the Caribbean and that meant there were no

[03:54] assets there were no video clips from the movie in the deal that was inked and let me

[03:59] tell you something the guy who inked the deal with Jersey Jack Pimbal and Disney is no

[04:05] longer with Jersey Jack Pimbal now go connect the dots as to why you think he's no longer

[04:10] there this might also be the same guy who made them show pirates a year ahead of time

[04:15] so look they've course corrected they've gone back they're renegotiating to get all the

[04:21] assets that you want in your toy story pen and that takes time and that's what is happened

[04:26] is so they moved it to make sure they can make the best toy story game possible and I know

[04:31] that's music to all of your ears because you can't make a toy story pen and not have

[04:36] any clips from toy story so prior to the Caribbean sort of fell victim to this lack of assets

[04:42] really bad contract negotiation and look even though people are saying it's a great

[04:46] pin how much better would it be if you actually could see clips from the movie it would be that

[04:51] much more immersive and so they did the best with what they had but we all know also that

[04:57] Willy Wonka they have no issues with the assets they have all of the clips they have everything

[05:04] you want from a Willy Wonka game so that is what is happening and so what does that mean that

[05:10] most likely we're going to see Eric designing guns and roses see if you listen to Jack and how

[05:17] he talks about this stuff it's all very you know we're going to reveal two new games this year

[05:22] and Eric is designing a new game as well well he didn't say Eric's game would be revealed this

[05:27] year so my bet is that we're going to see Wizard of Oz Willy Wonka and toy story sometime later on

[05:35] in the year and that is going to be a one two three punch and and and Jack is teaming this up to be

[05:42] I think they're most successful year ever because we all know that Wizard of Oz is their most

[05:46] successful pen so now he's got sort of like a a final run of that that's going to be a celebration

[05:51] of his most successful pen he's moving on to a pat law or standard body Willy Wonka game with

[05:57] full assets that's going to I mean I know a lot of you are excited about that and then he's going

[06:03] to follow that up with toy story I mean this is going to be the year where I think the orders come

[06:09] flying in the Jersey Jack pinball and they're going to be in a great driver's seat to really I

[06:15] think finally finally break the dam and become the company that I know Jack and team have always

[06:23] wanted this company to be and instead of struggling I think they're going to struggle to keep up with

[06:28] the orders versus struggling to get people interested in the games all right so that is what is going

[06:34] to happen at Jersey Jack pinball and then follow that up with guns and roses it's all the

[06:39] sudden starts to seem like JJP might actually get the train back on the track all right now what do

[06:46] you think of that it's that's what's going to happen now when will we see Willy Wonka is the

[06:50] other thing that people are wondering about and you're not going to see it to like May June so

[06:55] that means you have a you're going to have like six months of like a little bit of a lull I think

[07:01] you're going to you're going to see what happens with Wizard of Oz but then there's going to be a

[07:04] little bit of a waiting period and during that waiting period it's really interesting to see if one

[07:11] company comes out of the shadows because I asked someone who's seen a lot of what's been going on

[07:15] in pinball I asked someone who's who's got some access to behind the scenes of these different

[07:20] companies and even though I was like oh man JJP really feels like this is it this is the year

[07:26] and I'm like you know Stern's going to keep firing what Stern fires out into the world and they

[07:30] just said you know if deeproot can launch what deeproot has deep roots going to crush all of them

[07:36] and I'm like holy shit if that's not a bold statement I don't know what is so man this is going

[07:42] to be the year it's like Avengers endgame pinball manufacturer endgame these three juggernauts

[07:51] two of which I have already made games one of which is completely unproven but is running on

[07:56] 100% hype right now deeproot versus Stern pinball versus Jersey Jack pinball I don't really

[08:03] consider Chicago gaming stuff to be that interesting because it's just remakes so here we have it

[08:08] three companies battling and out for pinball supremacy three companies battling and out to show you

[08:15] what pinball can be in 2019 and it's going to be fucking awesome to witness and this is the other

[08:22] reason why I don't understand why anyone would buy anything right now why wouldn't you wait

[08:28] to see where the dust settles and I know I know I say this on the eve of people about to get their

[08:34] monsters and their beetles and and people still waiting for pirates but my gosh oh golly does in

[08:40] 2019 seem like the year where you just want to watch these tightens go at it and guess who's going

[08:46] to win ultimately the person who's going to win is you the consumer because these companies are

[08:52] going to battle it out they're going to show you how much magic they can throw out into the pinball

[08:56] world and may the best game win I'm super excited I'm super excited and you know as soon as I hear

[09:04] new information you will hear about it here first on canatus pinball podcast we do all of our own

[09:11] research and we begged for every single twippy vote we will hopefully get everyone have a great day

[09:23] that can't be mentioned that this is what's going to happen you know I heard that K man said that
