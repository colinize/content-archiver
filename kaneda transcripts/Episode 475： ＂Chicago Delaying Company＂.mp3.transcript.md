[00:00] You know, I've started and stopped recording this podcast like 10 times already, because

[00:16] I'm trying to find the right way to summarize the introduction to this expose on Chicago

[00:22] gaming company.

[00:24] And the reason why I'm sort of going back and forth and how I want to articulate this

[00:28] is I thought this would be easy on episode 475 of Canadian's pinball podcast.

[00:33] I thought it would be really simple to talk about a company that has only released three

[00:38] games so far.

[00:39] We talked about Jersey Jack already and they've released five games and it was easier

[00:44] to figure out the story of Jersey Jack pinball than it was to figure out the story of Chicago

[00:48] gaming company.

[00:50] We talked about American pinball and there are two titles and it was easy to understand

[00:54] the origins of American pinball and discuss that company.

[00:58] Chicago gaming company a whole nother beast.

[01:01] It's a company in which many of us might be confused about the origins of Chicago gaming

[01:06] company.

[01:07] Many of us might be confused about who had the rights to what?

[01:11] When was which game unveiled?

[01:13] When were games supposed to ship?

[01:15] There's a lot of moving parts and as I started to unravel the puzzle that is the Chicago

[01:20] gaming company.

[01:21] The story got more and more interesting when I looked at it from the very beginning of

[01:27] when they first announced they were going to remake medieval madness and then I went

[01:31] on this journey and I was committed to trying to get to you the listener the key milestones

[01:38] in the accurate order in which things took place and trust me that sounds a lot easier

[01:43] than it actually is because this company has been all over the place in terms of what

[01:50] year they said stuff when they announced things when things were revealed when things were

[01:56] shipped personnel changes manufacturing changes it's been all over the place.

[02:02] And so I really do find this story to be very interesting because for a company that

[02:06] is simply remade three games that were already popular this company has had a lot of twist

[02:13] and turns and a lot of different moments that I think have defined what this company is

[02:19] for a lot of people and the reason why I'm calling this podcast the Chicago delaying

[02:24] company is if you were to zoom out the delays have really been the main thing that people

[02:31] identify with with the Chicago gaming company now that does not mean they don't make phenomenal

[02:36] products I think the other thing is this the weight has been worth it for so many people

[02:40] and when they finally do get the game in the box people are in love with the remakes

[02:47] that came out of Chicago gaming company I mean they didn't just take old games and make

[02:51] them again they enhance them in so many great ways and I have stood over the monster

[02:58] bash remake I've stood over attack from ours and I've stood over medieval madness remakes

[03:02] and they are works of art pictures don't do them justice but if I also were to ask you

[03:08] a question and I'm I'm curious if you know the answer you could just say it out loud do

[03:13] you remember what year Chicago gaming company unveiled to the world that they were going to

[03:18] remake medieval madness I mean when did they first announce it it's 2020 right now what

[03:24] if I told you the year in which they announced they were going to do remakes was all the way

[03:30] back in 2013 seven years ago this company put themselves on the map but that's not exactly

[03:39] accurate so we're going to start this tail on Chicago gaming company by starting off with

[03:45] where did Chicago gaming company come from you might hear people refer to this company as either

[03:51] Chicago gaming or Chicago gaming company it sort of goes by both names they were officially

[03:59] announced in 2001 so that is the origins of Chicago gaming company but this company is not by

[04:08] itself Chicago gaming company is an offshoot of a company named Churchill cabinet company now

[04:15] Churchill cabinet company has been around since 1904 and they are located in Chicago and they are

[04:21] masters of woodwork and they've been making cabinets for decades and working with wood for decades

[04:28] now the year in which I believe they started applying their woodworking skills into the arcade scene

[04:34] was 1977 and they started making pinball cabinets pinball back boxes and pinball play fields and you

[04:42] know them because their products Churchill products have made their way into stern machines in the

[04:47] form of cabinets and play fields they've also made play fields and cabinets for Jersey jack pinball

[04:53] and they've made arcade cabinets for raw thrills so they are the offshoot of Churchill that is

[04:59] Chicago gaming and so they've been making primarily since 2001 what they've been making are more

[05:06] arcade games and redemption games they were not making any pinball machines prior to medieval

[05:12] madness remakes so them jumping into the pinball world was really big news because remember these

[05:18] guys were vendors for some of the biggest pinball company if not the biggest companies stern pinball

[05:24] relied heavily on Churchill cabinets for cabinets and for play fields and back boxes so

[05:30] so the fact that they were going to make their own pinball machines based upon some of the classic

[05:36] titles that everyone loved was a really big disruptive move in the pinball landscape we're going

[05:41] to talk about that okay so where does it all begin where does Chicago gaming first fire a shot

[05:48] that it's going to remake some of the greatest titles of all time well the truth is it doesn't

[05:54] even really begin with Chicago gaming company it begins with another pinball company called planetary

[06:01] pinball supply now planetary pinball supply was created by Matt Christiano and Rick Bartlett now in

[06:09] 2010 these two gentlemen Rick and Matt they acquired the rights to the bali Williams titles that

[06:17] everybody knows from mr pinball australia okay and so now anyone who wants to remake a bali

[06:25] Williams game has to go through planetary pinball supply so these gentlemen were really smart in

[06:30] acquiring that license so when the news came that medieval madness was going to be remade it wasn't

[06:37] actually announced by Chicago gaming company in 2013 it was actually announced by Rick and Matt

[06:45] at planetary pinball and let's now look at how they made that announcement way back in 2013 at

[06:52] pinball expo so at pinball expo in 2013 the seminar was actually called what's happening at planetary

[06:59] pinball now they they went over a bunch of other things happening but the real big news was at the

[07:04] end of their seminar they announced that they were going to remake medieval madness with a

[07:10] partnership with Chicago gaming company 1000 machines were said to be made manufactured by Chicago

[07:17] gaming with the play field produced by Churchill cabinet company Doug Dubah from Chicago gaming

[07:24] came to the stage to talk about his company's history in coin up and then we start to get some

[07:30] of the details of how they were going to do their remake the game was going to cost $7,999

[07:37] with a $1,000 deposit the remaining balance would be due one week before the game ships approval for

[07:45] the remake from Williams should be completed in two weeks they said so they were you know they

[07:50] were doing they're still doing some licensing and getting some agreements together and the existing

[07:55] planetary pinball distributors would handle all the orders around the world for this game so you

[08:00] were still buying this game from planetary pinball not through Chicago gaming company this is how

[08:05] it started they offered a 180 day warranty on electronics and a 90 day warranty on play field

[08:13] parts specific game numbers they said would be available for a fee and a delivery date was anticipated

[08:21] this is again remember this date when they announced this at expo in October the anticipated the

[08:26] games would be delivered by q2 of 2014 to see why I called it Chicago delaying company the only

[08:35] visible difference between these remakes and the original game is the remake will not feature

[08:40] Williams branding so when you bought a remake of this game and still doesn't have it on there you

[08:45] won't see the Williams logo on the back box internally though there are several several differences a

[08:51] new CPU board has been made with the drivers part of a large board set under the play field the

[08:57] game will have LEDs throughout in a shaker motor pre installed the game will have artwork decals on

[09:03] the cabinet all right so and I'm looking at it right now so I'm looking at the the way they were

[09:08] announcing this thing there was actually an order form and I'm staring at the order form right

[09:13] now it's got the medieval madness logo in the upper left is this pinball expo 2013 pre order

[09:19] form 7,999 dollar MSRP and it says right below that that this game is available in q2 2014 and

[09:28] they're asking for your name your address your telephone number and your preferred distributor so

[09:34] they listed out all the distributors of planetary pinball that you could choose to buy the game now there

[09:39] are some terms and conditions I'm trying to zoom in on this sheet there's a $1,000 deposit required

[09:45] distributors were prohibited from taking deposits in excess of $1,000 so they were not allowing people

[09:51] to pay more okay so what's really interesting what's really interesting about how they did this when

[09:57] they said you know you only have to pay you can put a deposit down it's refundable and we're not

[10:02] going to ask for the rest of the money until the game is ready to ship what's I want you to remember

[10:06] that because part of what happens with this game is delays and then distributors started to create

[10:13] an arbitrary date in which you could not get your refund back we're going to talk about that but

[10:18] again I really think these guys like most people figured out that some for some reason manufacturers

[10:26] and pinball startups whenever they start to map out the timeline of when they think games will ship

[10:33] why are they always so far off and they're not just off by weeks or months they're often off by years

[10:43] in which a game will actually make its way into a consumer's household so I'm just going to do a little

[10:49] I'm just going to fast forward for you so you so you can understand what I mean by that so this game

[10:54] was announced at October's expo in 2013 they said the games would be available by Q2 of 2014 any

[11:03] guesses out there on when games actually made their way into people's homes and we're just going

[11:10] to jump forward in history right now the first medieval madness remakes did not start appearing in

[11:16] people's homes until January of 2016 so Q1 of 2016 so almost two years later then they promised

[11:28] as their order form suggests two years delayed to get the game and we're going to talk about what

[11:34] happened in that two year period because it's really interesting so obviously people go bonkers for

[11:39] this game and they sell out immediately remember medieval madness they were selling on the used market

[11:46] good examples of original titles were going anywhere from 12,000 all the way up to even like 15

[11:53] 18,000 dollars for a heprostor medieval madness so to get a brand new game new inbox with all new

[12:01] LEDs and internals was music to every pinball collectors ears and they sold every thousand

[12:08] LEDs that they announced now it was so popular that after they realized wait a minute we sold

[12:14] every single game pretty much immediately what what are we doing like why would we only make 1,000

[12:20] versions of this game so almost like three days later planetary pinball comes back and announces

[12:27] that they're actually going to make more games and so they actually on October 19th they announced

[12:33] due to overwhelming demand for medieval madness limited edition remake and do allow more people

[12:39] who may have missed out on the opportunity to get the game we have decided to announce a standard

[12:45] version of medieval madness remake which can also be pre-reserved with a $1,000 deposit through

[12:53] planetary pinball supply or through your local authorized distributor the medieval madness standard

[12:59] will come with original standard play field clear coat and no shaker motor and so for those of you

[13:05] who remember the history of this game the Ellie also came with I believe you have the option

[13:10] between a black armor and a gold armor on your game and the dots would be colored now this was

[13:16] before they had the wide screen that you see an attack from ours and monster bash remake see it

[13:21] was weird right it was weird that they announced that you were only going to get one layer of clear

[13:27] coat like standard play field clear coat and everyone sort of lost their minds and was like what

[13:33] are you talking about like how are you actually going to make a game with less clear coat or not

[13:40] protect the play field as well as you could and they immediately did me a copa and they announced

[13:45] the following just got off the plane and taking some feedback and we've decided to include the

[13:51] double hard clear coat on all Ellie and standard medieval madness remakes it's like wow thanks so much

[13:59] you're going to give everyone a good clear coat it game and when I hear stories like this and how

[14:05] I don't know how many of you remember these kinds of stories but it once again just highlights

[14:11] when these pinball companies make decisions they don't really have a plan or a strategy

[14:17] it's like all right well let's only make a thousand medieval madness is okay demands way higher

[14:22] okay let's just announce that we're going to make an unlimited amount of standard edition games

[14:27] so immediately this game went from being like a collectible in which they were only going to make

[14:32] a thousand let's lock in those thousand people's deposits and then when they realize there's more

[14:37] demand oh let's just announce we're going to make more games oh but then we got to make the

[14:41] Ellie people feel like their game is more special so what can we do well why don't we only put one

[14:47] layer of clear coat on the standard games and say that the Ellie guys are going to get better clear

[14:52] like what a bonehead stupid decision that was to try and hold hostage a quality playfield for

[15:00] the Ellie people only now again this is not Chicago gaming company making these moves right now

[15:07] these are these are planetary pinball decisions and you might be like canada what are you doing this

[15:12] is about this is a podcast about Chicago gaming company why have you only talked about planetary

[15:18] pinball and and you understand now why this is confusing to me when I was doing my research on

[15:24] Chicago gaming company because there's almost like a point in which at the very beginning Chicago gaming

[15:30] is just the vendor making the game that planetary pinball wants to make and planetary pinball is

[15:36] calling all the shots and at some point that baton is passed to where Chicago gaming company

[15:43] is the externally facing entity that is making these remakes and not planetary pinball but at the

[15:49] beginning it was planetary pinball calling all the shots and having all the seminars and sort of

[15:55] standing in front of the project now the big announcement comes next is who's going to make

[16:01] these games and so you've got a thousand medieval madness orders you've got hundreds more people

[16:07] that want the standard edition game Chicago gaming company has not made pinball machines before

[16:14] remember they they've made cabinets and back boxes they have no idea how to screw together a

[16:21] fully assembled pinball machine so what do they do how does planetary pinball and Chicago gaming

[16:27] company now go build the games that all these people want that they promise would be built in

[16:34] Q2 of 2014 so they turn to the only company on the planet that can actually help them make games

[16:41] and make games quickly they turn to stern pinball to make the games really really interesting dynamic

[16:48] let's read word for word the press release that announces that stern pinball and Chicago gaming

[16:55] company have joined forces to manufacture planetary pinballs medieval madness remake are you confused

[17:02] yet about how many players are on the court thank you now you understand the pain I've been going

[17:07] through putting this podcast together but let's read what they said now I'm going to read this

[17:11] announcement exactly how it's written and I'm going to read it every letter the way it is written

[17:18] in this press release because they start using abbreviations for each company and I swear to you

[17:24] it is the most gobbly goop press release if your head's not spinning after you hear a couple

[17:30] paragraphs from this thing I don't know what will make your head not spin so let's read it

[17:35] word for word here we go May 14th 2014 planetary pinball comma Chicago gaming and stern pinball

[17:44] announce specialty manufacturing arrangement planetary pinball supply pps and Chicago gaming company

[17:53] cgc and stern pinball ink spi today announced a specialty manufacturing arrangement

[18:00] pursuant to which spi will make its manufacturing facility available to pps and cgc to assemble

[18:09] their remake of the medieval madness mmr pinball game cgc which has a long standing business

[18:15] relationship with spi will assemble the game for pps in spi's factory using spi's factory labor

[18:23] and production line assets the game will be assembled with parts supplied by cgc which consist

[18:29] of original wms specification parts combined with the new electronics and lighting systems designed

[18:36] by cgc final packaging and shipment will be from cgc okay wtf people what the f who who the hell who

[18:46] the hell just get using is like three letter abbreviations of every company this is the worst

[18:51] bunch of like gobbly goop communication ever then goes on to say we think this arrangement provides

[18:57] the best solution to ensure the timely delivery of a high quality game for our customers who wish

[19:03] to own this legendary title said Rick Bartlett president of pps we have a long standing relationship

[19:10] with spi and its high capacity manufacturing operation will allow us to complete the mmr games

[19:17] in a timely fashion added dug duba president of cgc we're looking forward to helping pps and cgc

[19:26] exceed the expectations of medieval madness pinball enthusiasts said gary stern president of spi

[19:33] this is the worst press release i've ever had the pleasure of reading in my entire life

[19:39] this this says it all cgc wms spi this is why i think this entire arrangement it didn't work out

[19:50] it's all over the place who's in charge of this game who's in charge of the quality control of

[19:55] this game who's calling the shot is it planetary working with chicago gaming is it chicago gaming's

[20:02] relationship with stern and and how how is it's not a conflict of interest for stern pinball to now be

[20:09] making a game which is taking buyers away from your clientele and your target consumers right it

[20:16] was weird to begin with that stern pinball would contract manufacture a game and build the game

[20:23] for someone else who's actually competing with them it really did make no sense from the very

[20:28] beginning so it shouldn't be of surprise to anyone that this sort of triumvirate these three

[20:36] power players in pinball it doesn't really work out right we know how this story ends now that was

[20:44] May 14th of 2014 now remember what i said games don't get into people's homes until

[20:51] January of 2016 so this partnership was a total total fiasco and when you really think about it

[20:58] too i'm trying to make sense of it even as i think about it right now you've got stern as the

[21:03] manufacturer being supplied with the electronics of the game from chicago gaming company

[21:10] Churchill is supplying the cabinets and the play fields but Churchill is really the owner and the

[21:16] origins of chicago gaming company you've got planetary pinball who's been the most vocal up to

[21:22] this point who's just the license holder unbelievable right what a disaster and so what happens now

[21:29] is this arrangement starts to actually make some games at the very beginning so at 2014-2015

[21:36] that is the period in which stern pinball is tooling up to make medieval madness remake games now nobody

[21:42] gets their game in 2014 nobody gets their game in 2015 but games start to be manufactured now the

[21:50] speculation is this the speculation is that stern pinball is not making this game a priority for

[21:57] obvious reasons and so the stern pinball starts to make some of these games when they have room on

[22:03] the line for it but this this game is not being prioritized stern pinball we know stern pinball can

[22:09] knock out a thousand games like it's nothing but it does not it does not continuously make

[22:15] medieval madness remake games in fact there are periods in which stern pinball starts to manufacture

[22:21] a few of them and then manufacturing pauses and there's delays and delays and delays and delays

[22:28] and so somewhere along the line somewhere along the line between 2014 and 2016 the relationship

[22:39] between Chicago gaming company planetary pinball and stern pinball completely collapses and the

[22:46] decision is made to yank manufacturing of the game from stern pinball and for Chicago gaming

[22:54] to manufacture the entire game in house at Chicago gaming they've already got the wood there

[23:00] there it's church you'll basically they're the ones who are supplying stern with the electronics

[23:05] for the game so basically let's just screw it all together ourselves is the decision that is made

[23:10] the implications of what happens between 2014 and 2016 sets the wheels in motion for what I am

[23:19] considering to be one of the biggest disruptions to ever happen in the history of pinball manufacturing

[23:27] and as consumers we didn't really see this on the surface but you definitely felt it with

[23:33] products that you got around this time period and and I'm talking no other than when Chicago gaming

[23:39] company brought back into their own house the manufacturing of medieval madness that didn't just

[23:47] mean that stern wasn't going to manufacture the game anymore it actually set the wheels in motion

[23:53] and completely destroyed the relationship between Churchill cabinet company and stern pinball

[24:00] because when they made the decision to bring it internally clearly this was not an arrangement

[24:05] that ended well and so Churchill made the decision to no longer supply cabinets and playfields

[24:14] to stern pinball and they would bring that work internal see this was like Churchill had stern

[24:21] by the cajonas here we've been making your cabinets we've been making your playfields if we walk

[24:27] if we walk good luck trying to create the same quality products we've been providing for you for

[24:34] decades and you know which game this happened in the middle of you know which game was the first

[24:40] stern title in which stern had to figure out how to make the playfields and the cabinets in house

[24:45] or find other vendors because Churchill was no longer going to supply them with the game playfields

[24:52] or the cabinets and guess which game it was the game which had the greatest quality control issues

[24:58] in the history of stern release since I've seen stern release games and it happened right when

[25:03] Ghostbusters was announced and shipping so Ghostbusters playfields were originally all supposed to be

[25:11] made by Churchill but because of this medieval madness issue and and Chicago gaming taking the

[25:18] game back in house and Churchill saying f you to stern stern was forced to find a new solution for

[25:25] their playfields and that's why if you're wondering why all those Ghostbusters games had crappy

[25:32] inserts and poor playfields if you're wondering why stern cabinets all of a sudden didn't have the

[25:39] same quality that they had before and we start to see stern cabinets cracking left and right on new

[25:44] games why do you think that is because Churchill their supplier for decades had left and this is to

[25:53] me this is the biggest part of this whole story even more so than these remakes is that Churchill and

[25:59] Chicago gaming company no longer were going to supply stern pinball with the materials that so

[26:05] many consumers were used to getting and stern quality really went downhill once this move happened

[26:12] and speaking of quality when the medieval madness games hit consumers people started to notice

[26:17] inconsistencies in the quality of the game and mainly around the playfield and the playfield artwork

[26:23] the inserts on the game some of the inserts were really transparent and see through is hard to

[26:29] read the black text when the game was lighting up and this started an entire sort of crisis for

[26:36] the medieval madness remake buyers because it people were spending $8,000 on these games and

[26:43] they were highly collectible and people wanted them perfect and this is the first sort of really

[26:48] major issue we've seen with playfield and playfield issues and the quality of the artwork on a

[26:54] playfield and insert issues and so I'm not still to this day I'm not sure why the screen printing

[27:01] process that was used for the medieval madness remake games had such problems when they first made

[27:08] these games and I'm not sure if they're blaming stern if I'm not sure what the issues were but

[27:14] ultimately this was the solve and this is interesting as we're going through the same issues right

[27:19] now with Stern and Jersey Jack Pimball with clear code issues the solution that they offered

[27:23] customers who were having issues back then where you could buy a new unpopulated playfield for

[27:29] $200 and you had a paper shipping didn't really go over very well with the community because

[27:35] this was never like an official Chicago gaming company announcement they never really came fully

[27:40] clean on the issue with the game and people were told that this is what the solution was sort of

[27:46] behind the scene they weren't very transparent about this issue and it just goes to show and we

[27:53] saw this with ghost busters we've seen this with other games we've seen it with Jersey Jack games

[27:59] with you don't get the playfield right on a game it doesn't matter it doesn't matter people

[28:04] are spending a lot of money on these games whether it's a hot title or a mediocre title nobody wants

[28:09] to see these games coming with defective playfields and so this has happened a lot in Pimball it

[28:15] happened with ghost busters it happened with medieval madness remake now I will say that we have

[28:20] not seen similar playfield issues on attack from Mars or monster bash remake so whatever the issue

[28:27] was with the screen printing on medieval madness that issue was fixed I've glossed over a few

[28:33] other moments in the medieval madness sort of storyline as you can see there's a lot of moving

[28:39] parts one of the things that I didn't mention yet was there was a period in which distributors

[28:45] were telling people they had a lock in their deposits for medieval madness or they were going

[28:50] to lose the game or their spot would be non-refundable and that happened in 2014 a lot of

[28:57] distributors were telling customers by July 10th your deposit is non-refundable so you either

[29:04] get your money back or you forfeit your spot and what was really unfair during this period was that

[29:10] they weren't close to getting games out the door and they kind of knew that and yet consumers were

[29:15] being told that they had a lock their money in and if you locked your money in in July of 2014

[29:21] you had another year and a half before you were ever going to get a game they just didn't understand

[29:26] how long it would take to get that first game into boxes and into the homes of consumers all right

[29:32] so like you can see how I'm like I'm like already exhausted we're still on game title we're still

[29:37] on game one I'm exhausted telling this story and games haven't really arrived yet so let's fast

[29:43] forward to March of 2016 through March of 2017 so we finally have medieval madness remakes are

[29:51] shipping people have them then the focus turns on game number two so March 2017 Chicago gaming company

[29:59] is building their medieval manaces and everyone is speculating about what game number two will be

[30:05] and the speculation is that it will be attack from Mars remake they officially announce attack

[30:11] from Mars remake at the amusement expo in Texas right before Texas Pimball festival this is where

[30:17] Chicago gaming company officially unveils attack from Mars remake and this is really where Chicago

[30:22] gaming company is the focus of this initiative we no longer start to hear like planetary Pimball unveiling

[30:29] unlike the medieval madness sort of debacle in terms of how many they're going to make and how

[30:34] many trims they're going to be they really knock this reveal out of the park so attack from Mars

[30:40] remake it's almost as if they learned all the lessons from their medieval madness mistakes they

[30:45] were building the games in house but they actually did another super super smart thing they copied

[30:51] stern Pimball's three tier model for releasing a game and this has been something that every major

[30:58] Pimball company out there has always struggle to find the right way to appeal to collectors appeal

[31:05] to operators and then appeal to people who just want all the gameplay features who might not care

[31:11] about all the fancy trims and armor and all the stuff that the Ellie guys go crazy for and it's

[31:17] it's worked perfectly and so when they announced attack from Mars remake they very much copied

[31:22] stern Pimball's three tiered model now I'm not going to go over each model and how much it cost

[31:28] and everything but you know there the pros around 6,000 and the Ellie was around 7,995 dollars

[31:35] and there was also a thousand units now what really stood out for the attack from Mars launch

[31:40] was the topper they made one of the most amazingly sculpted interactive toppers that people had

[31:47] ever seen in a Pimball game and it came standard included on each game was that topper so was the

[31:55] option of that beautiful green armor full LED lighting the game was gorgeous the game was gorgeous

[32:02] and I think when they showed this game and they showed the big screen with all the nice dots and

[32:08] the reanimation of the graphics people knew from attack from Mars this was the moment in which

[32:15] Chicago gaming company showed the world that not only can they remake these classic games that

[32:22] they can enhance them to the point that actually makes the remix I think much much of a better

[32:29] value proposition for consumers I mean the fact that that topper is included on every Ellie and

[32:34] these Ellie's are eight thousand dollars these games remember there are thousand dollars cheaper

[32:39] than a stern Ellie and a stern Ellie is not built as well doesn't have as much in the game and

[32:45] doesn't even come with accessories like that topper and so it's safe to say that this game again

[32:50] phenomenal phenomenal response to attack from Mars remake and the Ellie's ended up selling very

[32:57] very quickly and they sold all thousand units and so gone are the days of which people have to wait

[33:03] years now to get these remakes as well so when this game was announced attack from Mars in March

[33:09] of 2018 they also let people know that production would happen in the same year that it was announced

[33:16] and so they had a very ambitious timeline for this game it was announced in March and Doug

[33:22] score said that the game would be in production in May of the same year he wrote very pleased to

[33:27] share with the Pimble community that Chicago gaming is on course to start shipping attack from Mars

[33:33] in May as promised a lot of effort money and time has been spent in designing an incredibly

[33:39] efficient and flexible production line with almost six months in the making it was necessary to

[33:46] first move several departments around in our one hundred thousand plus square foot building to

[33:52] clear the space for our Pimble production facility in the various work sales production of AFM

[33:58] sub assemblies as well underway as you can see in the photos first production test playfields are

[34:04] already on the line as well by early June we hope to be providing our dealers with a reliable

[34:11] production schedule so that they can inform their customers with some sense of a delivery window

[34:17] okay so production starting in May does not mean games were shipping in May but I think what was

[34:22] great about this transparency and we all want to see it right is Chicago gaming company realized

[34:27] that there were so many delays with medieval madness remake that they were going to share with

[34:32] us a much more realistic time frame on when these games were going to be available for consumers and

[34:40] so then then something you know happens that is just sort of weird and wonky so here you have a

[34:46] company that is trying really hard to create demand for their existing titles and all of a sudden

[34:54] out of the blue rick from planetary pinball drops a bombshell as this company's just wants people

[35:02] to focus on attack from ours remake rick from planetary post something and says something and

[35:08] basically spoils the titles that Chicago gaming company is planning to remake in the future and

[35:15] you know that this is a huge trade secret for this company they don't want their future titles to

[35:23] be out there before they're ready to be revealed because if people are a big fan of let's say

[35:29] tales of the Arabian nights and they hear you're going to remake it they might pass up on buying

[35:35] attack from Mars because they know that the game they'd rather have is also going to be remade so

[35:41] it's super important to Chicago gaming company to keep all future titles close to the vest and not

[35:48] reveal what they are but rick from planetary in 2018 he writes the following a little clarification

[35:56] we have at least seven medieval madness attack from ours and at least five more remakes coming

[36:03] all our products of Chicago gaming and license through planetary pinball pps is in constant contact

[36:10] with Chicago gaming company on the games in development we provide the approvals as well as the

[36:16] blueprints some parts and review feature sets and pricing but in general the games are Chicago

[36:23] gaming product and of course we spend a lot of time feeding them with input highlighting any

[36:29] issues all to try to make the best game possible pps also happens to be one if not the largest

[36:37] remake game distributor what I can tell you is that in the list of likely remakes are cactus canyon

[36:46] monster bash feeder of magic big bang bar that list made change as other games become more

[36:53] interesting to add in based on desirability we also have the source code for these games so

[37:00] any deficiencies in the original code could be addressed with a couple of different approaches

[37:06] each game is getting new core features like the large color display that will be incorporated into

[37:12] future releases and game number three will have additional features as well okay so right there

[37:20] right there rick spoils spoils Chicago gaming companies ability to have some sort of creative

[37:28] secrecy and he tips the hat to the titles that they're going to make and now if you want a big

[37:33] bang bar or you want a theater of magic or you want a cactus canyon and you don't want to attack

[37:39] this was so idiotic this was so idiotic that he did that and and you could see Chicago gaming

[37:45] companies still to this day they're still backtracking from what Rick said there you can't

[37:51] unsee it and it's part of the reasons why I think people now you lose a little bit of a luster

[37:58] because when you see that Rick said that they're making seven titles they've released three of them

[38:05] over seven years so that means there's four more to go in the remake pool and if it takes seven

[38:12] years to make three titles how long is it going to take them to make those additional four titles

[38:20] and throw into the mix now that we know they're also going to be making original games as well

[38:25] okay but the story is not over we're going to get to what I think the future holds for Chicago

[38:29] gaming company but let's let's finish up on the three titles and put a bow on it and then move on

[38:33] so part of the communication from Doug was that Chicago gaming company this is we're still in the year

[38:39] 2017 so I know we got to go back a little bit but at the end of 2017 Chicago gaming company told

[38:46] the world that they should expect to see game number three at Texas Pimball Festival in March of

[38:52] 2018 and specifically this is the language that Doug said pin number three is scheduled to be

[38:59] released at the Texas Pimball Festival on March 15th 2018 in Dallas we are super excited to see

[39:06] everyone's response to pin number three once again we have raised the bar while putting amazing

[39:12] value in each of the three models if you've never attended tpf it's quite the event book your trip

[39:19] now now as we get closer to tpf now remember now we're into like the first half of 2018 as we get

[39:26] closer to that show reality sets in and we hear that Chicago gaming company will not be showing

[39:34] game number three at tpf due to delays so that's all they say is games delayed Chicago delay in

[39:41] company once again the game was not ready now the speculation is that it was going to be monster

[39:47] bash and the speculation was there was just hold up in terms of getting licensing agreements

[39:53] maybe it's universal that owns the license to all those monsters and monster bash whatever it was

[39:58] they were not able to get the game to tpf and then a huge thing happens to Chicago gaming company

[40:05] the man that had been the face of the company within the community the man that was the transparent

[40:11] communicator the man that was always giving updates on where things were with games he leaves

[40:17] Chicago gaming company Doug score leaves Chicago gaming company and goes to stern pinball

[40:26] and again if this is not a crazy move right because remember stern pinball is the company that

[40:31] Chicago gaming company completely burned when Churchill and CGC decided to no longer supply stern

[40:37] these are enemy companies these companies aren't friendly with each other so why did Doug leave to

[40:42] go to stern pinball i don't know but i want to read stern pinball didn't have a problem with

[40:48] putting out a press release when they stole Doug away from CGC and this happened on May 29th 2018

[40:55] stern pinball a global lifestyle brand based on the iconic and outrageously fun modern game of

[41:01] pinball announced today the appointment of Doug as director of export sales Doug will report to

[41:08] chief revenue officer john buscaglia and work alongside founder and chief executive officer

[41:16] gary stern to service and grow export markets Doug's post positions include serving as vice

[41:21] president of the score family owned commercial distribution company worldwide distributing

[41:27] president of doich worthlitzer USA vice president of edc gaming and vice president of Chicago

[41:34] i have no doubt for decades both through our families friendship and his game business activities

[41:40] he is well known and experienced in the amusement game industry both domestically and abroad

[41:46] said gary stern gary went on i love when i love press releases like gary went on like like it's written

[41:52] like there's like really like like was gary just talking at you just caught him in the middle of

[41:57] these two sentences so gary went on to say i am not retiring with stern's growth i can't be day

[42:04] to day responsive as the export salesman and perform my CEO duties with a successful 35 year

[42:12] history and commercial and consumer distribution manufacturing and operations Doug brings a vast

[42:17] amount of experience to his new position he's basically like this guy's going to be my lapdog

[42:23] when he gets here he's going to do everything that i don't want to do because all i want to do

[42:28] is roll up all the money i'm making off you suckers and smoke cigars and put tons of money in the

[42:33] bank with camcow all right gary goes on to say no Doug says this i'm very excited to be joining stern

[42:39] pinball and using my skills and experience to help our distribution partners expand their markets

[42:45] i have a long history of selling stern pinball products i worked in the industry when gary started

[42:50] the company old buddies helping each other out old buddies who had companies that were at each other's

[42:55] throats are now teamed up again they've joined hands and they're singing pinball kumbaya all right

[43:00] all is well now okay you know see here's the thing is like let me ask you a question so Doug went

[43:05] over to stern pinball in 2018 when's the last time you heard from Doug how much as he talked to

[43:10] the community how much has he been involved in stern pinball and your lives this is what happens

[43:16] it's almost like selling out in a way to go over there and just take the stern paycheck but i don't

[43:22] know i don't know but i'll say this i it's always got to be enticing for people to join stern

[43:27] because there's always sales growth there's always movement there's always stuff happening

[43:32] and chakago gaming company as awesome as the games are seven years and they made three titles

[43:39] in seven years stern makes almost 30 titles so think about that that's always stern's incentive to

[43:47] everyone in the industry if you want to be a part of something where things are happening

[43:52] you join stern pinball if you want to be a part of something where there's always delays where

[43:58] there's always pauses where there's always financial insecurity you join everybody else

[44:04] now i'm not i don't think cgc's in financial trouble but the delays have to just wear you down

[44:09] over time and Doug left right after there was more delays with monster bash remake and maybe he just

[44:17] got sick of waiting around i don't know but what i do know is this shortly after Doug leaves he

[44:23] leaves in may twenty at may 29th of 2018 chicago gaming company absolutely fumbles the reveal of monster

[44:31] and remember up to this point nobody was nobody knew officially what game number three was do you

[44:36] know how everybody found out because of a trademark filing they did on july 21st and that is how the

[44:44] world got confirmation that chicago gaming company was making monster bash remake there was no

[44:51] event there were no photos there was no party there was no unveiling there was nothing special

[44:57] about it it was a legal document and i'll read it right now it was a filing by chicago gaming

[45:04] company and it just says pinball machines and they were filing trademarks from medieval madness

[45:09] attack from ours and monster bash and that is how the world found out that they were making it

[45:15] and you know how they confirmed it they then had to go on facebook and put up a post that said

[45:22] clearly keeping secrets is not our specialty luckily making awesome games is you guys caught us

[45:29] we officially confirm the next game is monster bash thankfully the super cool features are still

[45:35] our little secret stay tuned for the official game announcement we're pretty sure it'll blow you

[45:41] away all right the game is finally shown to the world at pinball expo in twenty eighteen and monster

[45:50] bash again a completely beautiful game and i'm not going to go over all the features it's got

[45:55] another beautiful topper it's got a limited edition plaque that comes on on the apron it's it's

[46:02] just beautiful the the enhancement features with the LEDs and the lights and new sculpts and everything

[46:08] about the game just once again shows people that when chicago gaming company does a game they don't

[46:15] just do the game justice they enhance it to a level that is incredible and i think anyone who ever

[46:21] stands over a chicago gaming company game knows that and realizes that and if you haven't stood over

[46:27] one you will be blown away you will be blown away and so that sort of takes us to today now there is

[46:35] there is one interesting fact about monster bash remake that maybe not all of you realize

[46:42] and that is someone who's actually making a pinball machine with jersey jack pinball right now

[46:48] who's a big pinball fanatic he loves lots of pinball games one of his favorite pinball games

[46:56] is monster bash and chicago gaming company when they were remaking monster bash they made five

[47:04] special versions of the game and these special versions of the game included a new translate that

[47:11] featured instead of Dracula they put this individual's face on the character on the translate

[47:19] and he has one edition of that game and the people who run cgc have the other i think four variations

[47:26] of the game and that individual who has his very own personalized version of monster bash

[47:33] is no other than guns and roses lead guitarist slash if you don't believe me that slash has his

[47:41] very own version of monster bash remake with his image on the translate canadus pinball podcast is

[47:48] going to put up the image on my facebook page i'll also make up the image of this podcast and look

[47:55] closely you'll see slash i'm also going to put canadus face on it so that everyone can't take

[48:00] credit for me once again giving you some news in the pinball hobby in which there is no news

[48:05] so that brings us to today it brings us to today and chicago gaming company has now shipped three

[48:11] games and they're fourth title which once again is delayed their fourth title is supposed to be

[48:19] cactus canyon they're redoing the code on the game they're going to add to the code of the game

[48:25] but it once again it's just like where are these games and there it's going to be amazing it's

[48:32] going to be spectacular but i do think there is a little bit of fatigue setting in where if they've

[48:38] already announced big bang bar and theater of magic and cactus canyon why doesn't chicago gaming

[48:45] company simply ask people what do you want to see next why not let the people vote on the remake

[48:53] they want to see next it's the cats out of the bag wouldn't it be nice for the consumers to say

[48:59] just give us big bang bar just give us theater of magic and to sort of make people wait such a long

[49:07] time knowing that we know what the games are it is a little bit frustrating to follow this company

[49:14] and then to add things into the mix now is the whole notion that it's not just remakes they're

[49:20] doing chicago gaming company is tooling up to make original titles that are based on license themes

[49:27] and we just heard a couple weeks ago that spooky pinball and chicago gaming company have teamed up

[49:34] to make ben hex next game as a cross collaboration between spooky pinball and chicago gaming company

[49:40] so chichago gaming company has big plans the other designer they have on board who's helping them

[49:47] make their original games that are licensed ip's is mark richi so they have steve richi's brother

[49:53] mark richi the guy who made kingpin the guy who made indiana Jones right for bali Williams I mean

[50:00] mark richi is is an incredibly famous pinball designer and so the rumors are that he's working on

[50:06] pulp fiction and he's working on well he's working on it I hear a Tarantino game for Chicago gaming

[50:12] company and he's working on a sci fi title I'm hearing rumors of it's the goonies who knows what

[50:19] it's going to be right and the other thing too is they also have Christopher franchi over there

[50:24] Christopher franchi join them and he's worked on the medieval madness remake topper so they're

[50:29] remaking the remake of medieval madness we got the royal edition that's about to come out and

[50:35] those are also delayed you know it's it's it's so it's always the same story but now you got

[50:41] franchi who is one of the greatest pinball artists ever who hasn't really been utilized since the

[50:46] monsters I mean the man just won best artist in pinball and he's got no game out there but he's

[50:52] going to be working on the future games for cgc but now we resolve this going now there is no way

[50:59] there's no way cgc's plans are not going to be disrupted by this pandemic parts supplies

[51:05] getting consumers to open up their wallets might be harder than ever before but getting their

[51:10] company together might be hard now they're in a stay at home state in Chicago so getting everyone

[51:15] into the factory is going to be problematic I know for a fact that there are medieval manuses

[51:20] just waiting to go out but they've got to wait on parts and a lot of these parts people don't

[51:25] get this they come from China they come from overseas and so people have been really really

[51:30] waiting patiently for all those royal edition medieval madness games remember those games were

[51:36] they were talked about in October that's where at at expo is when they talked about the medieval

[51:41] manus royal editions and still October November December January February March

[51:49] were in April seven months people since medieval manus royal editions were announced seven

[51:56] months ago they announced a remake of a remake and the delays and the delays and the delays so I

[52:02] don't think I've unfairly called in the Chicago delaying company what I'd like to see from cgc

[52:07] moving forward is the same thing I'd like to see from jersey jack pinball they've got a hundred

[52:13] thousand square foot facility they've got more than enough talent that knows how to put together

[52:19] incredible machines they now need efficiencies they need more than one game a year on the line

[52:26] it just doesn't cut it anymore when you've got all these resources and all these talented people

[52:33] people don't want to wait so long to get stuff and that's been the story of cgc for me the most

[52:40] exciting thing is not remakes remake games you see what happens when they come out they're beautiful

[52:45] they're nice but no one really talks about them much because we've been playing these games forever

[52:51] it doesn't mean they're not great games it doesn't mean they're still not classics but they're not

[52:56] new you know they're like digitally remastered movies you can digitally remaster a movie that you've

[53:02] seen your whole life and sure it's fun to see those additions but there's something about going

[53:07] in and experiencing something for the first time and that's why I'm most excited to see what

[53:13] the original games are from cgc now I'm worried that we might never see them I don't know how far

[53:19] into the development they are of those games but I can't imagine there anywhere around the corner

[53:25] she I mean where's cactus canyon it's like it's takes him so long to make games where they're just

[53:32] copying the blueprint for a lot of the game I get they have to redo some of the code and some of the

[53:37] dots and whatnot but for the most part the game is designed so if it takes them this long to remake

[53:44] a game that's already been designed how long is it going to take them to make a game from scratch

[53:50] but I'll end this podcast by saying if they figure it out if they figure it out it's going to be worth

[53:57] it because when you stand over a Chicago gaming company game the quality is far better than stern

[54:03] the stuff that's in these games for the price is far more for your money than stern pinball

[54:08] they're just not new that's the only problem I have with these companies it's like as awesome as

[54:13] it is to stand over a medieval madness and a monster bash and an attack from Mars and yet you

[54:18] you enhance some of the greatest games ever now it's like show me what you got like what can you do

[54:24] can you apply this quality because I'm really curious to see if these guys over at Chicago gaming

[54:31] company if they can engineer new things that are as magical as the things they're recreating that's

[54:36] what I want to see can Chicago gaming company put into a game something as magical as a medieval

[54:42] madness castle can they put tons of features and mechs into the game like monster bash can they

[54:49] create an atmosphere like attack from Mars can they do that do they understand the principles of

[54:55] how to make a game a classic knowing that they've been staring at these classics for so many years

[55:00] so we will see we will see this has been canada's pinball podcast journey through the story of

[55:06] Chicago gaming company as you can tell you're probably fatigued just listening to it all I'm

[55:12] going to say this completely honestly this has been the longest I've ever had a take to do a podcast

[55:19] between the research and just recording it and going back and forth it this this is not fun this

[55:25] was like so much work now you get to enjoy it in in a snackable size portion but I just want to

[55:32] let you know that when we do more companies it's not going to be this difficult to follow because

[55:37] Chicago gaming company and pps and wms and spi all this all this all over the place I'm happy to say

[55:46] that it's finally at a place where I think you can understand who Chicago gaming company is

[55:53] where they come from and what we have to look forward from them everybody stay safe stay inside do

[56:01] your part don't be like those idiots on pin side who told you it would be over in 10 days who still

[56:06] think the stock market and the economy is going to bounce back in a week people are getting fired

[56:11] left and right people are are dying left and right stay safe that's the most important thing we'll

[56:16] talk to you soon later

[56:36] you
