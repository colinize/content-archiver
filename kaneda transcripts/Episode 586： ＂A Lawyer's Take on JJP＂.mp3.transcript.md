[00:00] You know, I want to say thank you to every single man and woman out there who served this

[00:21] great nation on Memorial Day.

[00:24] Without you, we wouldn't be here talking about pinball, talking about collecting these games,

[00:29] talking about the magic, talking about the code.

[00:33] So I mean it when I say from Canadian pinball podcast to all of you out there, the men and

[00:37] women who served this great nation, thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts.

[00:43] So here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:46] We're going to talk to a lawyer about the contract and the warranty between Jersey Jack

[00:51] pinball and its customer base because I think you're really going to find this interesting

[00:56] from a legal standpoint.

[00:57] What it means when all of us buy these games and are these warranties actually giving

[01:03] us anything or are we basically saying take my money and you will not stand behind your

[01:10] product on any level.

[01:12] We're going to talk about that.

[01:13] Now before I air this interview, I want to say something.

[01:16] I saw my Facebook live page.

[01:18] I saw that Robert Mueller responded.

[01:22] He responded to my Facebook post in which I made fun of the Rosaship date.

[01:27] I put up a post that said the Rosaship date see below and then it was a bunch of blank

[01:33] space and then said Rosaship date see above.

[01:37] And if you notice there was no date given on when Rosas would ship and Robert Mueller

[01:43] last night, he chimed in and he said laughing at you laughing at us.

[01:49] And I just want to say something right now directly to all of you over at Deeproot and

[01:54] to you Robert Mueller.

[01:56] How are you laughing at me?

[01:59] You told your customers back in December that anyone who ordered a rasa would have their

[02:06] game in four to six weeks or maybe was six to eight weeks, but that doesn't matter because

[02:12] that was six to eight months ago.

[02:14] And I also want to remind Robert Mueller that you came on Canadian's pinball podcast

[02:19] multiple times and you said that anyone who ordered your games would have their games

[02:26] within two weeks.

[02:28] Do you need me to pull the sound bites for you Robert?

[02:31] So how are you laughing at me laughing at you?

[02:35] Let me just say something right now and I mean this Robert Mueller and Deeproot Pimball

[02:39] and John Papaduke the entire pinball community is laughing at you.

[02:45] It is now June of 2021.

[02:48] You have shipped zero games to customers.

[02:51] You only sold a hundred and thirty roses.

[02:55] You sold less rasa machines than America's most honoured the ugliest pinball machine of

[03:02] all time.

[03:04] America's most honoured sold more games than your John Papaduke pinball.

[03:09] Our pin pod masterpiece so Robert and company nobody is laughing with you.

[03:17] Nobody is laughing at canada.

[03:19] The entire pinball world is laughing at deep root pinball who could only sell a hundred

[03:26] and thirty games after five years of promising all of this pinball innovation.

[03:33] And you know what where the games Robert where are the games are they even certified.

[03:39] Do you even have vendors lined up so how are you laughing at me?

[03:44] I did not promise people games.

[03:46] I did not say we would ship games within two weeks and Robert let me remind you you said

[03:52] multiple times that you would ship more games in one year than every single manufacturer

[03:59] combined not just stern combined.

[04:02] So Robert at what point at what point do we get to hold you accountable for what you said

[04:08] now go call up your law firm and go get them to try to sue everybody who's making

[04:14] funny you right now but ultimately I've grabbed every single sound bite that you said

[04:20] and you went on the record for and we're going to hold you accountable for it.

[04:24] And here's my thing Robert just get people of their games that's all we want to see.

[04:30] You don't have to chime in on canada pinball podcast Facebook page in June you just have

[04:35] to get people the games when you said you would but man 130 sold in total that is a joke

[04:41] that is a joke alright so we're going to air this interview and before I do this I want

[05:39] right now let's talk to a lawyer about Jersey Jack pinball contracts let's air it all right

[05:45] ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canada pinball podcast a very special guest and

[05:50] Dan you haven't been on the show before but you are a lawyer extraordinaire and I want to talk

[05:55] to you about Jersey Jack pinball contracts how does that sound that sounds good and I'm not giving

[06:02] legal advice that any of you should rely on that you can certainly listen to it and understand it

[06:09] as my experience now Dan for listener of the show just real quick your background in law and how

[06:15] you're you're sort of insight into this has some sort of relevance for the last I'm losing track

[06:22] of it 25 28 years my specialty has been product marketing and distribution so a lot of the discussion

[06:31] that's happened over the years and more recently with guns and roses play field I've had some kind

[06:37] of intellectual curiosity both to see how Jersey Jack responds and to see how pinball buyers

[06:43] respond okay now Dan before we jump into the the contract itself do you have a guns and roses

[06:50] machine I do which version do you have I have the CE okay and as of today what condition is your

[06:59] machine is is it perfect do you have any issues no I have had no issues maybe one time I needed to

[07:07] tighten the plastic white desk that's underneath the slash spinner okay that has a tendency sometimes

[07:17] to come loose in these games and I know some people have put lock tight on it I tighten mine once and

[07:24] other than that you know knock on wood it's been a great experience now how many plays do you

[07:30] have on your machine right now I promise you I was going to run the audit and I didn't but I would

[07:35] say about two hundred and thirty two hundred and forty the reason I wanted to ask you is obviously

[07:41] not every single machine is having issues and I know that sometimes because we're staring at

[07:46] pinside photos and we're staring at photos on my Facebook page people think that every single

[07:51] game is impacted but your game is is right now in good condition are you going to apply any

[07:57] additional preventative measures to your machine I don't think so I've never been a big stand of

[08:03] play field protectors and based on my understanding of the problem that wouldn't solve the most

[08:10] common issues with the guns and roses games the people have seen nor am I going to apply washers

[08:17] in advance I guess I'm gonna take my risks and keep playing it and see what happens play it and

[08:24] enjoy it so do you have any other Jersey Jack machines other than guns and roses at one time or

[08:30] another I've had every Jersey Jack machine even if some of them were for a very limited period of

[08:37] time I've had pirates of the Caribbean three or four times I very briefly had a dialed in I've

[08:44] had a hobbit I had a Ruby Red Wizard of Oz one of my forgetting out and I have had two two

[08:51] William Wonka C's which both had a little which both had a little bit of pooling coincidentally

[08:56] okay wait wait a minute why two wonka is why three pirates like what do you sell stuff and regret it

[09:04] and you get it back like talk to me about that first um you know I don't know it's some sort of

[09:09] sickness or foolishness I had Willy Wonka and then wasn't really marketing it very actively and

[09:16] someone offered me a good price for it and then it was gone I was kind of looking at that space

[09:22] sort of like seeing an empty space at the table so then I got it again and sold it again I don't

[09:29] have a good explanation for it as you see these pirates prices go through the roof do you wish

[09:33] you held on to pirates um what I wish I held on to was the new inbox pirates game that I had a

[09:39] year and a half ago that you offered me 17,000 for that set on 10 side for six months at 22,000

[09:46] and some eventually bought that when I wish I had back yeah your new inbox collector's edition

[09:52] nowadays those are 38 plus thousand dollars it's crazy but then the reason I wanted to talk to you

[09:58] is is warranties right and a lot of people now as they're looking at their pinball machines they're

[10:03] wondering when I buy a game from a company what am I entering into from a contractual like warranty

[10:11] standpoint with these companies and so I wanted to talk about Jersey Jack's warranties so I'm looking

[10:17] at it right now the JJP's limited warranty let's go top down on it can we take a step back because

[10:23] you've pointed this out to your listeners from time to time you're not buying a game from the

[10:27] company you're buying a game from the distributor you have no contract with Jersey Jack you have a

[10:32] contract with whatever distributor you purchased it from unless in this case we know that that you

[10:39] can also buy your games directly from Jersey Jack online all of my games I've either bought

[10:47] from a distributor or from other hobbyists most of the time in most instances when someone buys a game

[10:53] your contract isn't with Jersey Jack so with your distributor okay so does that mean that this

[10:59] warranty doesn't apply if I buy from a distributor or that I have to look at a distributor sort of

[11:04] warranty and coverage on on games I'm gonna give you the argument I would make and then I'm

[11:09] gonna give you the argument the distributor would make okay yeah so when I bought my guns and roses

[11:17] I believe that I paypal the deposit to the distributor when the game was being teased when they

[11:23] were running willy-wonka as it said won't you please take me home right because at that point it

[11:28] was clear that that guns and roses was gonna be the next game and then I paypal the rest while

[11:33] my distributor was on the phone on the distributor called the morning of whatever it was October 5

[11:40] I think that was right so I had paid for the game before ever seeing it obviously before taking

[11:47] delivery of it before anything so if I had a game and I was trying to find some relief the first

[11:53] thing that I would do is talk to the distributor and I would say I bought a game from you and it was

[11:59] my expectation that that game would have a certain level of quality with the distributor would say

[12:04] is and he might not use these words but he'd say well this is a pass through warranty the distributor

[12:09] would say I don't make any warranty the only warranty that you get is from Jersey Jack is just like

[12:15] buying a car now there's a big difference here when you buy a car and before you own the car you

[12:21] sign about 40 different pieces of paper at least one of those pieces of paper is information that's

[12:28] being disclosed to you about what the manufacturer's warranty is and you nobody does but you at least

[12:35] theoretically have the opportunity to read it and appreciate it before signing all those papers

[12:41] and taking the car right how many people when they buy a game from a distributor are ever

[12:46] given a distributor's terms and conditions and there may be some yeah some of the bigger

[12:50] distributors may have their standard terms and conditions but my argument would be I bought the

[12:56] game from you the distributor I don't know what Jersey Jack's terms and conditions are I didn't

[13:02] contract with them I contracted with you you didn't tell me about any of your terms and conditions

[13:07] you certainly didn't mention any Jersey Jack's terms and conditions so please take care of me

[13:13] right and legally though are they supposed to legally the distributor just just like Jersey Jack all

[13:21] things that you buy come with implied warranties those are things that that suggest that whatever

[13:27] you're buying should operate as that type of thing is supposed to operate and I would say when

[13:33] I bought a pinball game from you certainly for 12,500 or whatever it is there was a clear understanding

[13:39] between us that I was going to get something that didn't ship particularly since you know at 12,500

[13:46] these are artwork in my view as much as they are anything else and therefore the game that the

[13:52] distributor sold to me comes with what's called an implied warranty of merchant ability and unless

[13:59] the distributor gave me some written document in advance of the sale I would look to the distributor

[14:05] first to get help so let's let's talk about that very specific thing because and you might hear

[14:11] baby killing and crying in the background a little bit he he's looked at the Jersey Jack photos with

[14:16] all the chipping and that's why he's crying right now but let's let's talk about the implied warranty

[14:23] and how you apply that to all the different things that can happen to a pinball machine so you just

[14:28] said it's implied that my play field won't chip how do you prove that that was an implied thing that

[14:36] would be covered that you wouldn't have to put up with that how does that become like a list of

[14:41] here are the things that are implied and here are the things that are unrealistic because I think

[14:46] they would say like a pinball machine is wear and tear like this is natural wear and tear when you

[14:51] play a machine that has steel hitting wood yeah I don't think so I mean it's an argument that could

[14:58] be made if you ever took a distributor or J.J.P. to court maybe they could make that argument an

[15:05] implied warranty of merchant ability means that whatever you buy is good for the ordinary use

[15:11] for which it would be put good for the ordinary use for which a pinball machine would be or

[15:17] reasonably foreseeably right I would say it is not reasonably foreseeable that these brand new

[15:23] games that are $12,500 should be chipping they could disagree they could disagree and you know as

[15:31] you've talked about repeatedly it's not impossible to do you really don't see any spooky play fields

[15:38] that are chipping you don't see any CGC play fields that I'm aware of that are chipping well and if

[15:44] they came out publicly and said we consider this kind of damage to a play field to be normal wear and

[15:50] tear nobody would buy from them if they thought this was normal because it's definitely not normal

[15:56] now Dan I'm looking at the warranty right now and it's it's this one page warranty that was

[16:01] actually revised in March of 2021 and I want to get your thoughts on this thing and I want to get

[16:08] your thoughts on as you look at this and you look at this stuff that they're explicitly calling out

[16:14] as what they will cover and what they won't what are your thoughts on this current warranty as it

[16:20] stands I don't need to read the whole thing but to me it looks like they're only covering the

[16:23] the LCD monitor and the printed circuit boards and everything else that's your on your own

[16:29] well again I mean all I can tell you is what I would do if it were an issue for me and I've never

[16:36] had an issue with any Jersey Jack Penball yet that would take me down this road but the first

[16:42] thing I would do is wonder you know where are these terms and conditions and the only place

[16:47] that I was able to find the terms and conditions on the Jersey Jack website were in the game manuals

[16:53] themselves when you click into the games click into the downloads click into the manuals and

[16:59] there's a terms and conditions so you know I think just to be sporting a lot of companies have

[17:05] a specific link on the homepage along with about us and contact us etc for the terms and conditions

[17:12] so that would probably be a good idea but the bigger problem that I see is again speaking for myself

[17:20] I would want to make an argument that the attempts to disclaim these warranties which you certainly

[17:26] can do need to be made in some conspicuous manner which means they need to be in a larger tight face

[17:33] they need to be bold underlined in italics something like that that would draw the reader's attention

[17:40] to those disclaimers okay now I wonder I want you to really clarify that because what you're saying is

[17:46] if there are things that are not covered in the warranty it really needs to be called out in

[17:52] the warranty that these things are not covered correct yeah if it were me and I was having a

[17:59] discussion with the manufacturer or distributor I would say that the second paragraph from the bottom

[18:05] that says limitations and I know the word limitations is in bold but so is the

[18:12] preface to each of the paragraphs I would say the language that uses the words merchantability

[18:19] and fitness for particular purpose should be perhaps capitalized in bold and maybe underlined

[18:26] for good measure that would do it okay and it says in no event shall JJP be liable for any indirect

[18:34] special incidental consequential or similar damages including but not limited to lost profits or

[18:40] revenue inability to use the product or other associated equipment the cost of substitute

[18:47] equipment and claims by third parties resulting from the use of this product so it's interesting

[18:53] though Dennis I look at this you know and we're not lawyers were pinheads right we just we just

[18:57] assume that we buy something in the companies can stand behind it the way I'm reading this though

[19:02] is that other than the LCD and the circuit boards nothing is really covered under this warranty nothing

[19:09] above the woods so not not the spotlights not the mechanisms right but you would you would feel like

[19:14] that would be implied that if a spotlight broke on my guns arose the machine they would take

[19:19] care of it correct yeah now I mean obviously that's as much smaller and easier fixed then

[19:26] then something that goes on with a play field which would need to be depopulated and then repopulated

[19:32] and you put your finger on something interesting because you what you just read back to me was

[19:38] was the limitation on damages because there are two things that contracts can do from a manufacturer's

[19:44] perspective one is limit the claims that you have that's limit the the kinds of remedies like

[19:50] the implied warranty of merchant ability and the other thing is to limit the kinds of damages you

[19:54] can ask for the point that you have made on your show several times which is even if there was a

[20:02] replacement of a play field if it is a play field that has the same problems as the earlier play field

[20:08] that's really not any solution is it now to get a play field that itself will chip and there's

[20:14] this notion that when a single remedy like that fails if it's essential purpose then you shouldn't

[20:22] be limited by it so that that's the argument I would make if it were me I would say gosh you know

[20:28] I appreciate that you have a repair and replace let's just assume that it applied to the play field

[20:34] and the company says it does not I would make the same argument that you've made on your show many

[20:39] times which is it doesn't do any good for me to get the same play field with the same problems

[20:45] that presumably will suffer the same kinds of defects and sometimes in those kinds of circumstances

[20:51] then you are able to get damages, consequential damages, etc. Okay now I do want to say one thing

[20:59] that there's one thing that you and I disagree on and that's if the company agrees to buy back

[21:05] games to me that makes the buyer whole and I understand your point has been this isn't an

[21:11] official company policy it's not on the internet no one has announced it whether that's true

[21:17] or not if the company will pay you back for the money you paid even if the game has accidentally

[21:23] increased in value I mean to me you can't ask for more than that if they buy back your game

[21:28] for what you paid for it even if it happens to have appreciated between the time you got it and the

[21:34] time you sold it back I think that's a fair solution of course that's the case you know people can't

[21:39] be given back market price on anything like if my Dodge has like a lemon lawn I take it to Dodge

[21:46] they're gonna give me what I paid for my demon they're not gonna give me market value of 130,000 for it

[21:50] I get that part of it but I guess the thing is this people don't want to sell it back they want a

[21:56] solution now Dan are you saying when we talk about you know they shouldn't be limited to a solution

[22:02] that's not a solution so where are we right now because they have the refund offer do you think

[22:07] they're just gonna say well that's it like we'll offer your your money back but we're not gonna

[22:11] give you any other solutions because we don't have any well there's only one solution here for most

[22:17] people I mean I don't have the the time and I certainly don't have the skills to repopulate a

[22:24] new play field so the only obvious solution to me for folks who want to keep their games would be

[22:29] to say we now have new play fields and the new play fields are fixed right but you know whether

[22:35] it's miracles fault or somebody else here's a new play field it's fixed it's fully populated send

[22:41] us back the old play field also fully populated which would still be a pain to box that up and send

[22:48] it back so maybe they would agree to cover the cost of shipping but to me that that's the only

[22:54] clear solution is a fixed play field that is populated that can be swapped in and out and we saw

[23:01] Stern do that with Ghostbusters with the insert issue they were having with the Ghostbusters

[23:06] Elise Dan we know there's probably no way Jersey Jack is gonna do that from a financial standpoint

[23:13] so let's talk about timing because I think that's the other thing that I'm curious about because in

[23:16] in all these warranties there's always like a period of time by which the warranty is applicable so

[23:23] the circuit boards are 60 days the monitors 270 days so how do they navigate play field and how long

[23:32] they would warranty a play field right because some people put 2000 plays on a game and some people

[23:37] put 50 should that be somewhere written that we're gonna cover this for the first 60 days or within

[23:44] 500 plays and then you're on your own or is it purposely not put in there at all that's a good

[23:50] question I mean I think the only the only warranty that would provide some certainty is one that

[23:56] covers the number of plays I mean I've had this discussion with you before I mean the game is

[24:02] the world's most magnificent video jute box it's used more like that than it does as a pinball

[24:09] machine so you know if it only has 100 plays on it after a year I mean at some point I mean I

[24:16] don't think anyone expects a company to say well you know I warrant you last five years 10 years

[24:21] whatever it is but I think it would be fair to say that it should be for so many plays and again

[24:29] you know I mean I realize a lot of people's view is that this should simply never happen right you

[24:35] should never happen after 5,000 plays it should never happen after 10,000 plays but yeah and we're

[24:41] seeing games with 50 plays have have issues so Dan is there a contract between Jersey Jack and

[24:48] Mirko that sort of indemnifies Jersey Jack if Mirko's to blame and or vice versa indemnifies Mirko

[24:57] if Jersey Jack is overtorking post and that's what's creating this issue I have no idea because I

[25:03] don't think any of us have seen whatever are the terms and conditions between JJP and Mirko

[25:10] what one would expect in a thoughtful supplier agreement with Mirko's supplier to JJP that there

[25:17] are those kinds of indemnities or really not necessarily indemnities but more in the nature of Mirko

[25:24] warranting its own work to JJP question you know you've seen this whole situation I've been talking

[25:29] about it for a few weeks what do you think is going to happen this is just your personal opinion

[25:34] what do you think is going to happen next um honestly you know the game is so magnificent

[25:41] I pet a friend tell me looking at it it's like looking at the face of God that it will probably

[25:48] eventually blow over and you know ultimately I think the company may hope that it is a limited

[25:55] problem and they may hope that it's something that they can deal with sort of on a one-off basis

[26:00] with folks should do complain um and refund them their money yeah but but we're all we're all

[26:06] speculating I don't know but here's like this is the third time though right I think for a lot of

[26:09] people out there right they're looking at this saying look this happened on Wonka it happened

[26:14] on pirates now it's happening on guns and roses is there any class action lawsuit that you could

[26:20] see owners getting together and saying this is this is enough like this is BS like there's enough

[26:26] games affected I don't want to refund because I'm losing a ton of money on market value I just

[26:31] want a game that works and they can't give me a game that works without this defect it do you think

[26:35] a class action lawsuit would be effective here um you know there are probably only about a hundred

[26:41] thousand lawyers in your hometown that that could and would bring a class action lawsuit um it's

[26:48] all going to depend on on your individual circumstances there are some some complicated rules

[26:57] that define when a court can recognize a class for a class action so I wouldn't feel comfortable

[27:05] speculating on that and you know all the things that we've talked about today I mean these aren't

[27:11] any secrets I don't know how many lawyers are on Pennside I don't know how many are on your

[27:16] Saturday morning spectacular but probably a few well because you know you see people like

[27:21] threatening that and we've seen some class action lawsuits that there was one against J-pop one

[27:25] against Skit B none of them have really been successful in getting the outcome that people would

[27:31] have liked and I think people always say the lawyers get rich guys like you Dan get very wealthy

[27:35] and then everyone else is left holding the bag yeah but that the problem is is always collectability

[27:41] I mean if you want to bring lawsuits over predator or over alien um yeah you know people tried to

[27:50] bring lawsuits over Dutch pinball but that's a company that is not a domestic corporation

[27:58] there has to be something there to collect and in a lot of instances if you sent in money

[28:05] that money's just gone well when I look at this warranty again I'm just staring at it it's up on my

[28:09] 65 and screen TV as a buyer and just from a macro level would this make you feel good what's

[28:17] in writing or would you like to see more knowing what this product is you know I mean I've only

[28:23] been kind of back in this hobby for a few years and the first problem I had was on a Star Wars

[28:30] premium game and there's a little diverter that is supposed to divert the ball from the left side

[28:38] to the right side I forget if it's the force or whatever it is in that broke and that's when I

[28:43] realized you know basically for all intents and purposes these things I have taken the view that

[28:51] that these games really have no warranty right and if you reach out and you do it politely and

[28:58] respectfully you can get help from the manufacturer most of them are pretty good you know for all

[29:05] the complaining that happens about Pennside there are people on Pennside who probably knows much

[29:11] as the people in the companies so they're always willing to help you can get parts you need to figure

[29:16] out how to fix a few things yourself I have adopted the view that there simply is no warranty now

[29:23] with that said you know I've never bought a game newer used that was dead on arrival that had

[29:31] something that that couldn't be fixed and this is cosmetic right I mean at the end of the day this

[29:37] issue is a fully cosmetic issue it is not stopping people from playing the game but it's such a painful

[29:44] cosmetic issue because you're selling these expensive machines to collectors who want to preserve

[29:49] these games and keep them as mint as possible and play field Dan right it's the hardest thing it is

[29:55] literally the hardest thing to swap out of a game I don't think you could have a worst item that

[30:00] people are knocking on your door saying they want a resolution or solution to a play field issue

[30:05] right this is a nightmare for them do you think what do you think's going on over there Jersey jack

[30:09] you know what kind of discussions are happening internally well I mean as far as swapping out

[30:13] play fields every once in a while I think it would be fun to get a rotisserie and you know to get a

[30:18] really beat up game and try that and then I look at the underside of any game for just a minute or

[30:24] two and realize for me for someone like me it is simply impossible can't be done if I'm going to

[30:31] get a play field swapped out I'm going to have to hire somebody to do it and I'm going to have to pay

[30:37] you know I don't I don't know what it is but I'm going to say probably what can you get a play field

[30:42] swap for less than two thousand dollars I mean it looks like it's a hundred dollars of work

[30:46] yeah and and like and if you don't get the play field for free I know for a fact that the price of

[30:52] the guns or roses play field the collectors edition is around thirteen hundred for the lower

[30:57] play field and maybe two hundred and fifty or three hundred bucks for the upper play field it's

[31:02] expensive I mean if you have to you know if you have to buy a new one and you bought one already

[31:07] and it should have worked in the first place you really don't want to have to show that out again so

[31:10] yeah I think you're looking at two to three thousand dollars easily on this kind of work I mean you

[31:15] ask me what what do I think the company is thinking yeah we think the company the company is probably

[31:20] disappointed by the fact that they are they they're probably are saying to themselves in your words

[31:26] we are the only ones in our view who are going out of our way to create this magical world under glass

[31:33] we are creating these amazing machines with artwork but stunning you know with rad cows that shine

[31:41] like glass and particularly with this guns and roses game that give you the real music

[31:48] synced to the real video they're not having that conversation then you think they're really

[31:53] I don't know I mean you think they're over there saying no good deed goes unpunished like like that's

[31:59] kind of what you're implying I mean they've got to be like why are we still using Mirko like there's

[32:04] gotta be like guys three times in a row we're we're basically torpedoing people's respect and

[32:13] sort of confidence in our company because of play fields that talking about syncing up videos

[32:19] you really think they're thinking about that I think they're disappointed in recognizing that

[32:24] they are making games that are the most amazing games that you can buy and unfortunately rather than

[32:31] the conversation being exclusively on that right absolutely that it's been sidetracked to the talks

[32:39] of pooling and shipping and everything else yeah I think they talk about that in terms of whose fault

[32:46] is it between Jjp and Mirko I don't know you know who has responsibility between those two with

[32:54] indemnities or warranties that Mirko makes I don't know that's a great question do you think they're

[33:00] ever going to officially say something on this matter because they haven't even officially come out

[33:04] and said anything well again you know you're you're both of us are talking about what what are they

[33:11] saying in the boardroom and you know I don't know if there ever was any official statement for any of

[33:17] the earlier games for for Waz or pirates or anything else but if there wasn't then I don't know why

[33:25] there would be a change in practice here yeah I don't think they're gonna say anything I think

[33:30] they're gonna sort of weather this storm I think they're gonna just take in all the complaints and

[33:37] all the tickets that get filed and I think they're gonna try to go customer by customer and they're

[33:42] gonna you know if you got some people that this is the end of the world and they want they want

[33:47] everything new new playfield new populated playfield and you and look down you said it blame these

[33:52] people that is the only fully acceptable solution to someone who loves this game and wants to

[33:59] bolt it to the floor see I think if they just get rid of Mirko and find a new vendor and make

[34:05] replacement playfields even if they sold it to me for half price or at cost right 500 bucks

[34:11] and I could have that replacement that's ready to go I would play the hell out of my game

[34:16] wouldn't care about any playfield issues and then down the road I would pay someone to do a swap

[34:22] for me it's not easy though right this isn't like going to jiffy lube you can't just roll your game

[34:26] into places and have someone swap a playfield I mean there's probably I what would you say but maybe

[34:32] it's like a hundred people in America to do this at most I don't even know I had to speculate on that

[34:38] yeah yeah I mean at the very most because it takes an incredibly high level of skill and detail

[34:45] and a lot of time even for someone who is particularly skilled and if someone offered me a couple

[34:50] thousand bucks to swap out a playfield it'd be like you know you you couldn't pay me enough

[34:54] sometimes wouldn't be able to do something like that I wouldn't even be able to do it you can

[34:58] give me ten grand do it I you're not getting back a swapped playfield that looks right um let me

[35:04] issue a question as a as a fan as a buyer and as someone who currently has a game with no issues I

[35:09] want to I want to do hypothetical let's say your guns and roses a couple hundred plays from now

[35:14] starts to have a little bit of the wear around these posts and okay you're like all right it is

[35:19] what it is and they announce toy story are you going all in again if if you have issues on

[35:25] this game or would you be hesitant to buy a Jersey Jack machine again every last person who win all

[35:31] in on guns and roses is going to go all in on toy story by the time toy story comes out the hype

[35:37] and the FOMO and everything around it will be it's such a feverish pitch that this may not this

[35:43] this may not be forgotten but with with the passage of time you know in assuming they do

[35:49] handle it on a onesy tozy basis really every single pirate the Caribbean CE has potential really bad

[35:56] pooling and play field issues and one just sold for thirty eight thousand dollars knowing that when

[36:01] you open that box up you most likely will have a play field that is not going to be perfect um Dan

[36:08] I really appreciate you taking the time and walking us through this uh interesting time in the

[36:13] pinball hobby we're all sort of playing Russian roulette with every single purchase and would you

[36:18] advise people to buy from distributors because JJP sold directly what what do you think is the

[36:25] best way to go well I think it's with the distributor I mean I've bought games from different

[36:30] distributors and it's always been a pretty good experience for me I have never bought a game

[36:37] directly from the manufacturer but you know I mean most of the distributors also become your friends

[36:45] and and you know you have their cell phones in your phone and if something goes wrong you know in

[36:51] most cases these guys will do everything they can to make you happy so I mean I would prefer to buy

[36:58] from a distributor now I mean if the same thing happens with toy story and some unknown number of

[37:04] games are being held by the company and allocations are are uncertain and are getting moved around

[37:14] if I wanted to absolutely make certain that I got one it well it's going to be a little bit of

[37:20] it's going to be weird next time if they sell direct because I think everybody's going to hedge

[37:24] their bets this time right I mean it's like why not just buy one directly have your wife buy one

[37:29] directly and you buy one from a distributor that way you have two different names with orders and

[37:34] you at least you know make sure you don't get locked out like GnR yeah I mean my guess is that they

[37:40] will have this process better figured out by this time I mean they didn't have kind of a run on

[37:47] the store with any of the games that they have had now before guns and roses and as big as guns

[37:53] and roses as in a global basis I truly don't believe that it's anything near the size that toy

[38:00] story is there generations of kids that grew up on toy story so wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

[38:09] wait hold on killings crying because he knows I got a challenge that toy story came out when

[38:15] in 1990 something right GnR in 1986 there are more you know it's funny they both have like four

[38:24] major installments there's four for toy story movies and really four major guns and roses albums

[38:31] and you usually just one and two appetite and I think you could put like lies in Chinese democracy

[38:37] as the fourth album together it's gonna be interesting it's gonna be interesting but you know the

[38:41] pinball demographic my friend right I mean it's mostly like men 40 to 60 are you going into a bar

[38:47] and talking to your friends about buzz and woody or are you throwing welcome to the jungle on the

[38:52] due box now I mean it's welcome to the jungle but I do think on on a global basis on a global

[38:59] basis recognizing they I mean pinball buyers are probably between 40 and 60 years old I think you

[39:06] may get a whole lot of buyers that you didn't have before I think that's probably gonna turn out

[39:11] to be the case with Mandalorian so I don't know I might be wrong but I would be shocked if it

[39:17] wasn't so Dan you think demand for toy story will exceed GnR oh yeah you don't

[39:24] it's gonna it's gonna be interesting because again I think that while there are not many great

[39:30] games for families they're just they're aren't and I think that level it's gonna hit like I love

[39:34] toy story I mean it's one of my favorite movies I put them kind of equal and like they're they're

[39:40] both like almost buy it now kind of themes for me I don't know I think it's gonna be close I think

[39:45] within the pinball buying demo here's what I think it's not gonna have you're not gonna have slash

[39:51] you're not gonna have the band giving you everything I think when people see toy story they're not

[39:56] gonna get Tom Hanks they're not gonna get Tim Allen they're not gonna get the people that were

[40:01] actually part of the movies I highly doubt they get all those assets and I think we're never gonna

[40:06] see a game that has as much in it the way GnR did and how are you ever gonna do a launch video just

[40:11] think about it how how are you ever gonna create a launch video like that hot woman on their

[40:17] playing guns and roses with all that like tail shaken how are you gonna do that with toy story

[40:23] and get people being like oh yeah I need to have it like it's just not as a marketer I can market

[40:28] rock and roll way better than I can market toy story to to a global audience of 40 to 60 year old

[40:34] mostly men well that was admittedly maybe the greatest promotional video not necessarily for

[40:40] pinball machine but maybe for anything I've ever seen for pinball for sure not not anything ever

[40:46] but it was awesome it was awesome well Dan thank you so much for taking time on your holiday weekend
