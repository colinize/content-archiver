[00:00] 750 Rick and Morty games about to be sold to the world and we have some information

[00:23] on how that sail will take place.

[00:25] Let's start with that right now in Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:28] Here's what I'm being told is how they are going to handle selling Rick and Morty games.

[00:34] I'm just going to read this word for word.

[00:38] This is coming from spooky pinball.

[00:40] Apparently, I don't know.

[00:41] It's kind of paraphrase.

[00:42] They cannot release the game for sale until Cartoon Network approves it but it will most

[00:49] likely be next Monday.

[00:52] Set your calendar, kids.

[00:54] We are selling a blood sucker edition which will all be built first in the run before any

[01:01] standards.

[01:02] They also include custom powder coat and portal side rails.

[01:07] More details and pictures to come right before launch.

[01:12] The blood sucker games will have a deposit required of $1,525.

[01:19] You should tell your customers that they need to be a member of the spooky fan club which

[01:25] they can get on our website.

[01:28] We ask that you only sell these amount at this time and that they will be all blood sucker

[01:35] editions as very few spots for standards are available.

[01:39] Alright, well there you have it, kids.

[01:42] Spooky pinball is going to make the blood sucker edition first requiring a $1,525 which

[01:48] is non-refundable deposit.

[01:51] Get ready to lock in your money.

[01:54] The debate rages on about whether or not this game is going to sell out immediately.

[02:01] Will the Rick and Morty fan base show up?

[02:03] Does it translate over into the pinball buying community?

[02:06] We know that people are suckers for getting new unboxed games and the fear of missing out

[02:12] is very strong in this hobby.

[02:14] What do I think is going to happen?

[02:16] I think these games are going to sell out pretty quickly.

[02:18] I think the answer is yes, I'll tell you why.

[02:21] It's been a while since people have had a game, have had a dream theme.

[02:27] Now look, this is not everyone's dream theme.

[02:30] It's definitely a theme in which some people are ecstatic about it.

[02:35] Some people are not.

[02:36] But I think the real reason.

[02:37] The real reason this game I think is going to sell out immediately is two words.

[02:42] Two words.

[02:43] Ready for them?

[02:44] Scott Dinesy.

[02:45] I think Scott Dinesy's soft morric title was going to be super successful because people

[02:51] love him and they love his games and they love what he did with TNA.

[02:55] I think they're going to expect that this is going to be an evolution.

[02:59] If not a revolution of what Scott can bring to the pinball world, then I think people want

[03:02] to support him.

[03:03] I think for that reason too, he's got a big fan base.

[03:06] You combine the Scott Dinesy fan base with the Rick and Morty fan base and I think you

[03:11] sell 750 of these games.

[03:14] Now, reality will set in for people that there is a long wait for many people who get this

[03:21] game.

[03:22] I think the question does become, at what point does spooky pinball need to hire more

[03:27] people to get more games out the door quickly?

[03:31] Because I kind of feel like 750 is definitely pushing it 18 months to get a game if you're

[03:39] at the back of that list.

[03:41] That's just too long when you think about it.

[03:43] It really is because we all know in that time period, the amount of games that will be revealed

[03:48] are going to be significant.

[03:49] They're going to be other dream themes that are announced and people's money will be

[03:54] locked in.

[03:56] Now, then the question is like, well, you want to be at the front of that line.

[04:00] You're going to want to get a blood sucker's edition.

[04:02] What happens if they get 500 blood sucker orders, which they probably will because those

[04:08] end up becoming sort of like your Ellie versions of the game, if they get 500 blood sucker

[04:13] editions, it's still going to take a year to make all of them.

[04:16] You know, it's at the point where like, I mean, spooky pinball is just like, hey, American

[04:21] Pimbo, how'd you like to build our, you know, our Rick and Morty game for us and help us

[04:25] get them out the door quickly and then move on to the next game.

[04:27] But it's all, it's a good problem for spooky to have.

[04:32] And so it's a very good problem for them to have.

[04:33] And I think they're relishing this moment in which they have such a strong game with

[04:39] so much hype and excitement and I can read in Charlie's post like he loves it.

[04:43] Like he loves that they're going to have a game that a lot of people want that there's

[04:48] going to be more demand and supply.

[04:50] Okay.

[04:51] Now, the other thing is this, it's like, I was reading on Pinside and you get these

[04:54] like weird people and I'll just name names like I saw why snow.

[04:59] He's back at it again complaining about, he says the Knaida types who flip games.

[05:03] For a profit and I just wanted for the record for the record, say that you can do whatever

[05:10] you want with what you buy and and and and why snow.

[05:13] We know him as Hilton.

[05:14] He tells this story of a local liquor store that was tired of people flipping the bourbon

[05:19] for more money and that the liquor store would require a lottery to buy a bottle of bourbon.

[05:25] But here's the kicker before you left the store, they made you open the bottle of bourbon

[05:30] and take a sip so that you wouldn't resell it.

[05:33] And I'm sorry, that's an un-American.

[05:35] That's pathetic.

[05:36] That is so pathetic.

[05:37] You can do what you want with what you buy.

[05:40] That's, it's called freedom.

[05:42] It's your money.

[05:43] It's your game.

[05:45] If someone wants to flip a spot of Rick and Morty, let them do it.

[05:49] Who cares?

[05:50] You know, the only people that complain about those things are the losers on the sidelines

[05:55] because usually the people who buy them don't mind and the people who sell them are happy.

[06:00] So why are you upset witnessing simple capitalism, simple supply and demand economics?

[06:06] Okay?

[06:07] Is it unfair, Hilton, that someone buys a house for $300,000 and a few years later sells

[06:13] it for double?

[06:15] Shouldn't he just let the person have it for what they initially paid for it?

[06:18] I mean, come on.

[06:19] It's just the fundamentals of supply and demand and I just think it's lame when people

[06:25] get all upset.

[06:26] Now, so you can do what you want.

[06:28] And there's no way spooky can stop people from flipping spots.

[06:31] There's no way and they don't even care.

[06:33] If you're a chuck, if you're a chuck, you want to see, you want to see your game.

[06:38] Let's say be offered for $7,500 and if you see people sell spots for $10,000, that's a

[06:44] great thing that shows you that you've got a hot item.

[06:49] You know, it doesn't, you know, look and I'd rather them see that than do what Stern is

[06:54] doing, which is instead of letting people flip games that are in high demand, you know,

[06:58] it's Stern's done.

[07:00] They've increased the price and so Stern is making money on the potential flip and not

[07:05] even giving any room to flip a damn game.

[07:08] Right?

[07:09] There's no room for a $15,000 L.Virid to go up.

[07:12] They baked in what they think is like the ultimate high end price of that game.

[07:18] There's no room for a $10,000 L.Virid to go up in value.

[07:21] It's just never happening.

[07:23] We're paying the flip price from Stern.

[07:26] Right?

[07:27] Those are the real blood sucker additions.

[07:29] Those are the real suckers of the people that are spending a fortune on Stern games that

[07:32] they've overpriced.

[07:33] Right?

[07:34] Now, part of me just wants to flip a game just to piss off Hilton because it's funny

[07:38] watching this guy like get so upset.

[07:40] Oh my God, people should not be allowed to do what they want with something they bought.

[07:45] They should listen to me because I know better, you know.

[07:49] All right.

[07:50] Look, here's what I also think is going to be interesting in December is you're going

[07:54] to get, I think Stern Pimball is waiting to announce stranger things.

[07:58] Part of me feels like they're just going to wait until the day spooky reveals Rick and

[08:02] Morty and then they're just going to drop stranger things on top of that release.

[08:07] I mean, are they doing that?

[08:08] Are they going to be strategic?

[08:11] And does it matter?

[08:12] The stranger things to me is just like a tidal wave theme.

[08:15] It's like Rick and Morty is sort of like an island with fans on it.

[08:19] But stranger things is like a humongous wall tidal wave of water that's just going to

[08:25] like crash over that Rick and Morty fan base.

[08:27] It's 10 times bigger.

[08:30] There's no way around it.

[08:31] 10 times bigger.

[08:32] But they're going to make 10 times more games.

[08:34] See, that's the thing is they're going to make 10 times more stranger things.

[08:37] Stranger things if it comes out is a pin in which you know, Stern's going to make 5,000

[08:42] of them, 6,000 of them.

[08:44] If it's a great Brian Eddie game, you know, it's never going to be rare.

[08:47] It's never going to be hard to get.

[08:49] You know, the Stern will probably make 800 LEs.

[08:51] They'll probably do all this shenanigans, a $10,000 topper that comes out five years from

[08:55] now.

[08:56] It's going to fall into the Stern marketing model.

[08:58] Okay.

[08:59] Now 750 Rick and Morty's, as I said in the last show, I think it's enough.

[09:03] It's still going to be available though.

[09:05] I really do implore people to sort of relax a little bit if you think you're not going

[09:09] to be able to get one.

[09:10] You will be able to get one.

[09:12] I mean, Chuck is doing a great job man fanning the hype of this game.

[09:15] He's like, this thing, he said this thing could sell out in two hours.

[09:18] It could sell out in two minutes.

[09:20] You know, and that's an amazing way to drive fear of missing out.

[09:23] And the distributors are the same way.

[09:25] It's like, oh man, you got to get one.

[09:28] Now 750 trust me, trust me.

[09:30] We live in a pin side and a pin ball bubble.

[09:33] The rest of the world has no idea what's going on.

[09:35] They have no concept of any of these new pin ball machines there.

[09:38] And people are not waiting with their wallets out to get every new pin ball machine.

[09:43] I would say there's about like 300 guys who fan the fuel of like, you got to get

[09:48] it now.

[09:49] It's going to sell out.

[09:50] Nothing really sells out.

[09:51] It doesn't.

[09:52] It distributors always keep a few and wait to see where the market lands.

[09:57] You get your people who buy them, who will flip them.

[10:01] You're going to get people.

[10:02] You're going to get people who go in on Rick and Morty and they have, let's say they

[10:05] have game number 373.

[10:07] Okay.

[10:08] Someone's going to have that game.

[10:10] You're going to get a guy like that who buys the game and then he's going to see Ninja

[10:14] Turtles or he's going to see like stranger things or guns and roses or toy story.

[10:18] And that guy is going to be like, all right, you know what?

[10:20] I'd rather have that game today and I'll let my spot go.

[10:25] It's going to happen.

[10:26] It's inevitable.

[10:27] It's not a bad thing.

[10:28] It's just the nature of it.

[10:29] It's just the way it goes.

[10:30] You know, we saw that with Alice Cooper.

[10:31] A lot of people, not a lot, but people who went in on Alice Cooper, we saw a bunch of them

[10:36] want to get off the line like midway through and people ended up losing about like 500 bucks.

[10:41] I just, most spots people were losing about $500 when they were transferring the spot

[10:46] to someone else.

[10:47] No Rick and Morty see the same thing.

[10:49] I don't think so.

[10:50] I think the Rick and Morty fan base is just a little bit stronger than the Alice Cooper

[10:54] fan base.

[10:55] All of this, all of this on some level is a little bit hysterical and funny, right?

[11:00] Because we haven't seen a game.

[11:02] I love it.

[11:03] I'm waiting for the day when someone actually sells us a pinball machine that doesn't even

[11:07] exist.

[11:08] It's called Raza and that magic girl.

[11:11] No, you know what I'm saying?

[11:12] But I feel like someone, it would be a great social experiment for a company to come out

[11:17] and be like, we're making the matrix pinball pre-order today, $1,000 non-refundable.

[11:22] How many actual deposits they could get without showing you a damn thing?

[11:26] I think they'd probably get a few hundred knowing this community, but it's an exciting

[11:30] time.

[11:31] I mean, I can't wait to see these games.

[11:34] You know, other than that, there's really not too much going on other than the wait

[11:37] for these big titles.

[11:39] Now, I did sell my big Lebowski pinball machine, the auction ended.

[11:44] The game has been sold, the amount of money that will be going to Project Pinball has been

[11:49] determined.

[11:50] I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this, the guy who bought it, awesome dude, awesome dude.

[11:56] And he got it for a good price.

[11:57] I'll say this.

[11:59] For those of you out there who didn't jump into this auction, the game sold for $16,000.

[12:06] Okay?

[12:07] Now, it's new in box, never open.

[12:10] This is the most affordable second hand sale of a big Lebowski ever.

[12:14] I'll say this.

[12:15] I'm a little bit disappointed.

[12:17] It didn't go for more considering the good cause we were doing this for.

[12:20] I mean, people were buying Lebowski's for $18,000, $20,000 earlier on.

[12:25] And now we're doing this for Project Pinball.

[12:27] It kind of sucks that we didn't get this game up on pinside.

[12:31] I still think Robin was lame for not allowing us to sort of get money for the kids, but

[12:37] whatever.

[12:38] It's over.

[12:39] And yet we got this amount.

[12:40] I'm really happy.

[12:41] We are, I'll just say this, we are going to be able to put more than probably one machine

[12:46] with the amount of energy going into this fundraiser with special one lit and Project Pinball.

[12:52] Lots of people are, I think, are going to contribute.

[12:55] And this is half the price of a game pretty much that we're donating.

[12:57] So really, really exciting time to sell that game, get it into the hands of a new owner

[13:03] and to do something good with the money.

[13:05] So for those of you who say, can a, it doesn't have a heart.

[13:07] Come on.

[13:08] I got a huge heart.

[13:10] Now let's go flip some Rick and Morty's and piss off Hilton.

[13:12] Okay, let's go do the American thing.

[13:14] All right.

[13:15] So what else is going on?

[13:16] Now I said I'm not going to reveal not yet the American Pinball new theme that is coming

[13:21] out.

[13:23] People know about it though.

[13:24] I've been talking to some distributors.

[13:25] People know about it.

[13:27] But we'll, we'll let them have their moment in the spotlight or we'll reveal it closer

[13:31] to launch.

[13:32] I've been reading in the deep root thread.

[13:34] I've been reading people being like, oh Robert, like Robert doesn't seem enthusiastic.

[13:38] And Robert seems to have lost his path.

[13:40] It's come up people people.

[13:43] Robert doesn't read pin side.

[13:45] Nobody at deep root is really following that thread.

[13:48] The thread is a dumpster fire.

[13:50] It's amazing how many posts are in the deep root thread and there's been hardly any real

[13:58] significant news other than the rise of prototype.

[14:01] But the question does, the debate rages on and it is hard not to look at the, the

[14:08] excitement around Rick and Morty and the excitement around Raza and how drastically

[14:13] different the responses have been so far.

[14:17] And it's got to be eye opening.

[14:19] I mean, we talk about the power of the theme on the show a lot and I saw someone on

[14:23] pins I put up a thread being like, theme doesn't really matter that much of the game

[14:27] is good.

[14:28] No, you're an idiot.

[14:29] If you think that theme doesn't matter in pinball, you're just an idiot.

[14:32] I mean, I don't mean to be rude or insult your intelligence, but it does matter.

[14:38] To say theme doesn't matter.

[14:39] Theme doesn't matter in movies.

[14:40] I just like movies.

[14:41] Theme doesn't matter in cars.

[14:43] I just like cars.

[14:44] Theme doesn't, theme is everything.

[14:46] Okay.

[14:47] It's everything.

[14:48] I mean, Stern has made an empire on theme and artwork alone alone.

[14:53] Like without those themes, you don't get the sales with theme.

[14:56] Theme pulls you into a game.

[14:58] It does.

[14:59] When you see the theme, it pulls you in.

[15:01] What doesn't pull you in is something like dialed in.

[15:05] I mean, who walked up to dialed in?

[15:06] Like, wow, dialed in.

[15:08] I can't wait to play.

[15:09] No, no.

[15:10] You're going to get pulled in to Ninja Turtles.

[15:12] You're going to get pulled in to Rick and Morty.

[15:14] You're going to get pulled in to stranger things.

[15:15] Okay.

[15:16] Now, here's what I just don't get.

[15:18] And then I got to go to work.

[15:19] I just wanted to bring up this point.

[15:20] And I saw Iceman said this.

[15:23] And I love Iceman.

[15:24] I love that.

[15:25] Like we're friends behind the scenes and on pinside, there's always a little canada

[15:29] jab.

[15:30] It's amazing.

[15:31] But he's a smart man.

[15:31] He likes his alcohol.

[15:32] So do I.

[15:33] I just don't understand.

[15:36] Why is every game the same price?

[15:39] Why?

[15:40] Why is every game the same price?

[15:42] Why can't manufacturers charge us more for better themes, but charges more if they put

[15:49] all the assets we want from that theme into the game?

[15:52] Who out there would not have spent another 500 to a thousand dollars per Willy Wonka

[15:59] if you could get all the assets the way you wanted them?

[16:02] Who wouldn't have spent more?

[16:04] Who wouldn't have spent more to get Jurassic Park with the movie clips from Jurassic Park

[16:09] one?

[16:10] People would.

[16:11] I don't understand it.

[16:14] When I heard Johnny Depp would have been an extra 500 dollars a machine or quarter million

[16:18] dollars per movie.

[16:20] So what?

[16:21] So what?

[16:22] Charge more and put everything in it and you'll sell more.

[16:25] I just think it's so stupid to me that every pin is the same price.

[16:29] Most of assets regardless of theme, they're all the same price.

[16:33] Here's why.

[16:34] To me a pinball machine is more, it's not like a movie or a video game, right?

[16:39] Movie tickets are all the same price, right?

[16:40] Doesn't matter if it's Avengers or if it's like an indie film, all the same price.

[16:45] Same thing with like most video games, but to me that's not like what a pinball machine

[16:48] is.

[16:49] To me, a pinball machine is like a watch.

[16:52] The more you put in it, the more intricate, the more the cost of the materials, the delicate

[16:58] nature of the watch, the different functions in it, the more expensive it becomes.

[17:02] And then obviously the rarer it is, the more expensive it becomes.

[17:05] To me that's a pinball machine.

[17:07] So why would you make Star Wars?

[17:09] Pinball machine.

[17:10] And why would you have cheap stuff in it?

[17:13] You have all the assets in terms of like the movie clips and the actor call outs from

[17:17] the films.

[17:18] You have all that, you have the theme song, and then you put a tie fighter on a spring.

[17:22] And you put crappy mechanisms in the game and you go cheap on the max because you maybe

[17:26] paid more, but why not just charge more?

[17:29] I'd rather have a Star Wars pinball machine that is loaded like a Valley Williams error

[17:35] game from from Stern pinball with modern screen and music and sound and all the next.

[17:40] I'd rather have an epic Star Wars game cost $10,000 versus the one we got.

[17:47] This is like stripped down, right?

[17:49] It doesn't make sense to me.

[17:50] It does not make sense to me.

[17:52] The market's there for it.

[17:54] The market would absorb it.

[17:56] Maybe make the pro all stripped down, but then make the premium or early ones like really

[17:59] load it.

[18:01] So I hope we see that.

[18:02] I mean, I really hope that big Lebowski is not the last game we see that actually does

[18:07] it right.

[18:08] I really, it's crazy to me.

[18:09] They did it.

[18:11] Whenever people tell me like it can't be done, I'm like, but they freaking did it.

[18:15] Why can Dutch pinball do everything that we want in a game, but Stern can't?

[18:20] Jersey Jack hasn't really been able to do it.

[18:23] I mean, why is it so hard?

[18:25] All the assets we want, the mechanical elements of the film on the play field and just that

[18:30] world under glass.

[18:31] Is it that hard to achieve?

[18:34] Okay.

[18:35] Let's get there in 2020.

[18:36] Can we people going to be really interesting?

[18:39] I think that's going to be the last hurdle in this hobby.

[18:42] Well, two things for me.

[18:44] I think everyone's looking to see what kind of assets Stern puts into their games moving

[18:48] forward.

[18:49] I think what kind of mechanical engineering improvements are we going to see?

[18:54] And then of course, of course, the big thing that's going to change everything is going

[18:57] to be the internet with pinball.

[18:58] It's coming.

[18:59] Internet connectivity is going to change this hobby.

[19:01] It's going to change the way the game is played.

[19:04] I think games are still being made as if it's 1996.

[19:07] It's 2020 people.

[19:08] It's 2020 in a few weeks.

[19:11] Let's wake up a little bit.

[19:12] You want to innovate, bring this damn toy into the 21st century a little bit.

[19:17] Modernize it a little bit.

[19:19] All these things are happening are still not present in a pinball machine.

[19:23] All right.

[19:24] What else is going on?

[19:25] Anything else going on in people?

[19:26] No, no, I got to get to work.

[19:27] Everyone, enjoy this episode.

[19:29] I think it's like 427 of Canada's pinball podcast.

[19:34] Twippy voting is not open yet.

[19:35] It always feels like there's such a weight to get to the twippies.

[19:39] But I really hope you guys vote for Canada's pinball podcast this year where it episode 427.

[19:44] I mean, you could be stuck on an island and listen to this show for almost a year

[19:48] and a half now.

[19:49] It's pretty incredible.

[19:50] Everyone, have a great day.

[19:52] We'll talk to you soon.

[20:18] We'll talk to you soon.
