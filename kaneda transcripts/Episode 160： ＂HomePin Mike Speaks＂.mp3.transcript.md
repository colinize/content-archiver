[00:00] You're listening to the head to head people podcast.

[00:21] No you are not listening to the head to head pinball podcast.

[00:24] You're listening to the Canadian pinball podcast and I'm going to do a little hijacking of another

[00:29] pinball podcast and that is head to head pinball who interviewed Mike from Home Pin Pinball.

[00:34] Now I've been trying to get Mike on my show for a really long time.

[00:38] He's constantly been ignoring my emails.

[00:40] He's been ignoring the request to come on.

[00:43] All the meanwhile he's been going on to the forums and the threads, jumping into other people's

[00:47] threads, talking all this smack and look I've been critical of Home Pin.

[00:51] I've been critical of their approach and why they decided to reinvent every single part

[01:00] to make a pinball machine in China but as you'll see in the interview that Orion and Martin

[01:05] did there are some explanations as to the benefits of doing that but there's also some explanations

[01:11] as to doing that being such an arduous and difficult process.

[01:15] Now the whole thing is this.

[01:17] It is 2017.

[01:18] We've been hearing about Home Pin Thunderbirds now for a few years and Mike you'll hear

[01:24] the games aren't even coming out this year.

[01:27] The reason I want to talk about Mike from Home Pin and air some of the clips that Ryan

[01:31] and Martin provided for us on their podcast Monday is how do you summarize it all?

[01:38] I've been talking to Ryan about this because it's hard when you interview someone to really

[01:43] dive deep and be too critical.

[01:45] He's like when you interview George Gomez did you ask him why he lied about code updates

[01:49] on Batman and he's right.

[01:51] When you talk to people you have to give him respect, you have to because they're your

[01:55] guests on your show.

[01:57] But after listening to the entire interview in its totality I came away with a few feelings

[02:04] but overall my ultimate feeling about Home Pin Pinball is still the same.

[02:10] Because I think this company was born without doing any real market research and market

[02:17] research continues to be the thing I harp on because for some reason in this hobby people

[02:22] just think that if you build a pinball machine your company will be successful.

[02:27] If you build a pinball machine there's going to be buyers.

[02:30] If you build a pinball machine it doesn't really matter what's in it in terms of displays,

[02:35] in terms of features, in terms of mechanisms, in terms of layout, in terms of quality.

[02:40] It's as if pinball buyers when we put up the target audience are labeled as complete

[02:47] suckers who will buy anything you produce.

[02:52] And the number one thing that I realized with all these manufacturers is I get pinball's

[02:57] making pinball's hard.

[02:59] But the number one mistake they all make is they make assumptions or they simply have

[03:04] big egos and say this is how we're going to make my product.

[03:08] I don't really care.

[03:09] This is what I want to make and that's the way you have to take it.

[03:13] But a real company, a real company that is making products, they don't operate like that.

[03:19] They make stuff that they know the target wants.

[03:21] They're listening to what the buyers are asking for.

[03:24] So I want to start this podcast where we go into Mike from Home Pin's explanations of

[03:30] this company and Thunderbirds.

[03:32] I want to start with this clip because I think this clip sort of captures the overall

[03:38] feeling I had when I finished listening to the interview.

[03:41] Let's hear from Mike.

[03:42] People that come to me and want a machine build have to accept the fact that it's going

[03:45] to be built the Home Pin way.

[03:47] That's it.

[03:48] We'll build it to your theme and we'll build it to your requirements.

[03:51] But it's built our way with our parts, with our electronics and it's built our way.

[03:55] And currently that means you're going to DMD.

[03:57] So don't come up and say I want to buy pinball machine.

[04:01] I want you to build that pinball machine with an LCD display.

[04:03] Sorry, it can't help you.

[04:04] So currently that's where we're at.

[04:06] That is obviously going to change in the future because that's what people seem to want

[04:11] or like I personally don't understand why.

[04:13] But to me, a dirty big video screen on the back is just that video machine.

[04:18] It's not a video machine.

[04:19] It's a pinball machine.

[04:20] There's something about making pinball machines and the individuals that decide to make

[04:25] pinball machines that makes them think this way, this myopic approach to making a product

[04:33] where looking backwards and being nostalgic about the glory days of pinball is what we

[04:38] need to emulate.

[04:40] But here's the thing.

[04:41] I work for the biggest brands and the smartest individuals who are involved in product development

[04:46] for products that make billions of dollars.

[04:50] There's no difference between that and pinball.

[04:52] At the end of the day, you want to make something that your target consumer wants.

[04:58] And when Mike talks about LCDs like this and how he thinks they're rubbish and how

[05:05] DMD dots is what you're going to get, and I mean, just think about it like this.

[05:10] Do you really think Mike and do you really think listener of the show that the talented creatives

[05:16] at Valley Williams in the mid-90s would not have used LCD technology if they had it at

[05:23] their disposal?

[05:25] They used the best that was available then.

[05:29] For Mike to use it in 2017, 2018 is kind of pathetic.

[05:35] How is that not pathetic?

[05:37] Even Chicago gaming as they're remaking games from that error is incorporating color dots

[05:43] and much better displays.

[05:44] But again, it just goes the show that this hobby really treats a lot of customers as idiots

[05:52] that if you just make a pinball machine, it's going to sell.

[05:54] And that's all you need to do is put a pinball machine in a box and you're going to have

[05:58] buyers.

[05:59] So I really think that market research, again, I harp on it because I work in it, but I

[06:05] also understand the importance of doing your market research and your market research will

[06:10] not just tell you what to incorporate into a machine.

[06:14] It will tell you maybe how popular a theme will sell with your customers.

[06:18] It will tell you where you should sell your machine.

[06:21] It should tell you how much you should price your machine at, all these things.

[06:26] And I don't think Mike really did any market research.

[06:30] I really don't.

[06:31] I think his market research was where he could make cheaper pinball, but the rest of it

[06:37] was kind of just a guessing game.

[06:38] But we're going to go and listen to a lot of what he says on this episode of Canadian

[06:43] Pinball Podcast.

[06:44] This is a highlight from what Mike talked about on Head to Head Pinball.

[06:48] Let's start in the area that I've been the most critical.

[06:52] And that is the theme of Thunderbirds.

[06:54] I do think that the inaugural theme of a company should be something that is universally

[07:00] applauded.

[07:01] And the fact that he picked a theme that is really just of appeal to people in certain

[07:08] markets, but not in the major pinball market is head scratching to me.

[07:12] But let's listen to why Mike picked Thunderbirds and his explanation for that.

[07:17] And we sort of spent quite a few months looking around at what we could potentially do

[07:21] that would maybe make us some money, you know, give us a job by us, a job if you like.

[07:25] We furlishly decided that maybe we could make a pinball machine.

[07:29] And if we did make one, we could do our best to make it better than what was currently

[07:33] on offer.

[07:34] We said about talking about licenses and we really wanted something that was family-friendly

[07:40] for our first title.

[07:43] So after narrowing down the field to two or three, we decided to approach a few different

[07:49] people.

[07:50] And in the end, the most responsive one was ITV in London with Thunderbirds license.

[07:57] We felt that it was a very good license, a family-friendly license.

[08:00] I did not want anything that particularly appealed to the American market.

[08:04] I did not want to go head-to-head with Stern and JJP on my first project.

[08:08] I wanted to target other countries and basically that means every country except the USA effectively

[08:15] because Thunderbirds is exceptionally well known and obviously, obviously, but also in

[08:20] Europe, most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand.

[08:23] And I felt that for our first title, we could spend our time and effort concentrating

[08:26] on those markets, rather than battling it out with Stern and JJP in America.

[08:30] So that was the reason that the first title came about as Thunderbirds.

[08:36] So I'm just going to say that I think companies that are focused on family-friendly themes

[08:41] again are missing the market.

[08:43] They're missing the target of who buys Pimball.

[08:47] If I were to just summarize who I think the key market is, it's white males between the

[08:53] ages of 40 and 60 are probably your core demographic for Pimball machines.

[08:59] What they're in do is not family-friendly themes.

[09:03] Not all of them are unfamily-friendly, but Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy.

[09:08] We keep hearing jaws.

[09:10] We keep hearing big trouble in the little China.

[09:13] We keep hearing iron maid and we keep hearing titles that appeal to that age demographic

[09:20] and not necessarily family-friendly.

[09:23] Also, what is the modern family?

[09:26] The reality is this.

[09:27] In most modern families, if you think about people who have children nowadays, those kids

[09:32] don't care about Pimball and none of the themes that you would make are of any appeal

[09:38] to them.

[09:39] So I just think this whole, I want to make a family-friendly Pimball approach is stupid.

[09:44] I think it's the reason why Jack has struggled with his themes because he's stuck in that

[09:49] space.

[09:50] I think it's also the reason why Mike hasn't really done much market research and he doesn't

[09:56] want to battle it out with Stern and JJP in America.

[10:00] The reality is this.

[10:01] You cannot start a Pimball company and eventually not land on U.S. shores because most of the

[10:08] buyers are there.

[10:10] Why would you make a product and say, you know what?

[10:13] We're going to make a product where most of the buyers are over here and we're going

[10:18] to make a product but not sell it over there.

[10:21] We want to make it to appeal to everyone but the people who are in the number one market

[10:25] to buy the product.

[10:27] Does that make business sense to you?

[10:29] Mike get it.

[10:30] Maybe he's starting off slow and he knows that Australians will gobble up Thunderbirds.

[10:35] But you know what?

[10:36] I'm not necessarily sure that makes sense because then he can't distribute them to the major

[10:42] marketplace in the world which buys the most Pimball machines.

[10:47] Okay.

[10:48] Let's go on to the next topic.

[10:50] So I thought it was interesting when he explains how because he's a new company and he's

[10:54] a startup Pimball maker.

[10:56] He wasn't able to secure like a great A title.

[10:59] The only thing that made me laugh when I heard that, well let me play it first and I'll

[11:04] tell you what it made me think of.

[11:06] Being a new company without a manufacturing facility, I couldn't, I didn't even want

[11:12] to waste my time approaching people like Star Wars.

[11:14] It would have been a waste of time.

[11:16] I had no track record.

[11:18] They wouldn't have been interested.

[11:19] Thunderbirds, difficult enough has it locked to get that license because I had to prove

[11:24] to them that I had the ability to make the machine without any facilities to do so.

[11:29] And in the end they did agree to license me providing up quite a substantial cash

[11:34] surety which was non-refundable.

[11:37] And I did that at the time and took a punt.

[11:40] That's what we did.

[11:41] Oh man, all I kept thinking was how the fuck did Andrew Highway get alien then?

[11:45] I mean it's like the same kind of story.

[11:48] Did full throttle really convince the people at Fox that this was the guy to give alien

[11:52] to?

[11:54] But as we heard from Mike, I mean he's all in on Thunderbirds.

[11:57] It is non-refundable payment.

[12:00] Not sure that was the best licensing deal but hey, you know he secured the license and

[12:04] I'm sure he got a great license right where he gets to use all the sounds from the show

[12:09] that Thunderbird fans have grown up to love right?

[12:12] He probably got that as part of his deal right?

[12:15] Included in the license, I mean do you have access to all the soundbites from Thunderbirds

[12:20] or do they give you a collection of soundbites?

[12:25] No we can't use any of the sounds from Thunderbirds, we have to recreate them.

[12:29] Maybe someone should have called Roger Sharp to ink a better deal but you know you win

[12:33] some, you lose some it seems with these licensing deals.

[12:36] Okay, the next part of the interview that was interesting to me was when Mike was asked

[12:40] how he feels the hobby has changed over the years because here's the other challenge

[12:45] right with these companies that have all these delays is the marketplace does change.

[12:51] You intend to make your game in 2014, 2015 and then years go by and the game is still

[12:57] not out and in that time period the market has shifted.

[13:02] New innovations have been introduced.

[13:04] New themes have come out.

[13:06] More manufacturers have been introduced.

[13:09] So I want to play for you what Mike said when he was asked that question about the

[13:14] market shift.

[13:15] So Mike, so you said that obviously how many years ago it was that you were thinking

[13:20] about that you wanted to start manufacturing a pinball machine and we'll get to that

[13:27] in a second but thinking back now it's obviously been a few years since then what's your view

[13:33] on the overall pinball industry now and how that is different to when it was when you

[13:40] first thought I want to build a pinball?

[13:43] I think with a lot more people interested in pinball a lot more enthusiasts collecting

[13:48] pinball seems to be a lot more activity than there was when I first mooted the idea.

[13:55] Probably not a great difference just a lot more people interested these days.

[13:59] I think it's still on the rise.

[14:00] I think it's popularity is on the rise not just as a hobby but also in the public domain

[14:06] I think we'll see more and more going to pubs and clubs and hotels.

[14:10] We're unlikely to see them going to snack bars and things because they don't really

[14:12] exist anymore.

[14:13] I'm with Arnold's and Hungary Jack's like them all out but I think we will probably see

[14:19] them get back into clubs, hotels and so on because let's face with hotels I stopped

[14:24] going to hotels a long time ago because I can't stand there to have a chat with my mates.

[14:29] I go there to have a quiet drink, have a chat and all I get when I go to any hotel

[14:34] on Australia is a wall full of stupid TV's running God knows what running football,

[14:40] running anything.

[14:41] You tell me I don't know.

[14:42] I don't know.

[14:43] And they blaring it at me and all I do want to do is have a chat with my mates so I just

[14:47] don't go anymore.

[14:48] Forget it.

[14:49] And I think the tide's turning a little bit because there's more people out there like

[14:52] me and we just don't go to these places.

[14:54] Perhaps these publicans need to be chatted and say look make one end of our acquired

[15:00] in.

[15:01] Put a pinball machine there.

[15:02] Let someone let a pack a different type of customer, a different client help.

[15:07] So here's the problem with everyone who loves pinball and I've fall victim to this

[15:12] all the time.

[15:13] Is we start to think that pinball popularity is growing out there in the world.

[15:20] Like that it's significantly growing.

[15:22] Like a lot more people are into it.

[15:24] That a lot more people want to see pinball machines in bars, in hotels, in other public

[15:30] places and we're wrong everyone.

[15:34] We are part of a very small community.

[15:37] It's not that big.

[15:39] So I kind of laugh when Mike says if you listen to what he's saying it's kind of a little

[15:43] bit hypocritical.

[15:45] So you say I want to go into a hotel and talk with my mates and have a beer and not be

[15:51] there where there's TV screens blasting football and other things.

[15:57] It would be nice to go into a hotel and have what a quiet pinball machine experience.

[16:03] Pinball machines are big.

[16:05] They're bulky.

[16:06] They take up room.

[16:08] They're super expensive and they're loud as hell.

[16:12] So imagine if you're a bar owner and I say to you you want to make money in your bar.

[16:19] You want to get people in here.

[16:21] Millions of people want to watch sports.

[16:23] How many people want to play pinball?

[16:25] Start right there.

[16:27] You could put a $500 TV and you buy a bunch of them and you'll get people in on the weekends

[16:33] and during major sporting events to buy your beers.

[16:37] You can make thousands of dollars in liquor sales if you buy a few hundred dollars or thousands

[16:43] of dollars with a TV's or you could do this.

[16:45] You could buy some eight, six to nine thousand dollar pinball machines and try to make a dollar

[16:50] of play on a machine that will have complications that might break down.

[16:54] It's idiotic to think that consumers want there to be more pinball versus going into bars

[17:00] to see their favorite sporting events and whatnot.

[17:03] And that's the thing.

[17:04] You ask crazy levy ask anyone who goes into bars that have a mixture of both right not

[17:10] just a pinball bar but when you go into a place that has pinball machines and other games

[17:16] and sports going on the pinball machines just sit there like hardly anyone uses it.

[17:21] No one's like running to go play dialed in when it went to Jack bar not Jack for sorry.

[17:26] Jack bar is like a pinball bar so people go there for that.

[17:28] But pioneer bar that's where levy goes and they have like six to eight pinball machines.

[17:33] But it's just funny when you go in there when Jack bar is jam packed during a happy hour

[17:38] during a sporting event it's like nobody's on the pinball.

[17:41] So I think there's this false assumption that pinball location is like super growing.

[17:46] And the reason why it's also not going to grow in the future is operators are not going

[17:49] to put these expensive machines out there.

[17:52] It's just not worth it.

[17:53] You'll never make your money back with these games costing so much money now.

[17:58] I mean the games used to be two thousand dollars.

[18:00] So again I think Mike is living in an error or he's approaching this with how he would

[18:07] like to see the world and how he would like to see the machines made and how he thinks

[18:13] games on location would you know are growing.

[18:17] And I just don't buy it.

[18:18] I just don't buy it.

[18:19] I would love to see the actual numbers of games on location versus the 90s.

[18:26] I know it's like significantly less but I'd actually like to see that there's a lot

[18:28] of growth.

[18:30] Like how much is that growth?

[18:32] Is it real growth or just what we would like it to be?

[18:35] All right.

[18:36] So from there this is like again we've all wondered why make your game in China.

[18:43] Okay why make it in China is it better to make it there.

[18:46] If Mike really wanted to make a new pinball machine if he wasn't happy with the way pinball

[18:51] machines were you know is it better to make it in China.

[18:55] And when he tells the story of just trying to make a simple lockdown bar in China like

[19:01] a simple part that you could buy off the shelf from multiple manufacturers in the states.

[19:07] The fact that he went through all of this just to make a lockdown bar just really again

[19:13] just was like had me wondering why bother.

[19:16] Listen to what he had to go through to make a lockdown bar.

[19:19] But I wouldn't talk about the problems associated with it and that's a lockdown bar.

[19:23] I brought a lot of a lot of down bars with me in my suitcase and I showed it to our

[19:29] friends down the road.

[19:30] They do all the same thing and it was too big.

[19:32] They needed a 200 tonne press which they don't have the biggest is 80 tons.

[19:36] So they can only do all the small bits and pieces and the brackets and things.

[19:41] So we shopped around in town who we believed someone we believed could do the job in town

[19:46] and look at it and measure it and took it away and scratch it et cetera while and then

[19:51] came back and said okay, we can do that, we can make a die for that.

[19:55] It will be about $5,000 in Australia and dollars for the die.

[19:58] I thought okay, that's not too bad.

[20:01] I can accept that.

[20:02] This is just for the outside part, not the frame inside the lockdown bar, just the stainless

[20:07] steel top part.

[20:10] So another few months went by and we called him up to the house that going, you know,

[20:13] we need to get a regal on with this.

[20:17] And I won't bore you with all the details but in the end he came up with the die.

[20:21] He didn't do the job, the corners were too wrinkled, it was just basically crap, it

[20:25] just wouldn't do the job.

[20:26] Not to my satisfaction.

[20:27] So I said, look, this isn't any good, it's not working.

[20:30] We can't have this, it can't be like this, it's got to be better.

[20:33] Oh, well, we can't improve that die, we're going to have to make another new one.

[20:36] And he called in another expert from somewhere else and said, yeah, you can fix the problem

[20:39] but we've got to make a new die.

[20:41] I said, well, I'm not paying you another $6,000.

[20:44] And so we haggled back into fours and we came up with a figure of about three or four

[20:47] pounds I think.

[20:48] And I said, okay, well, I've got no choice, you know, I've got to head this car.

[20:51] So I way they went and another few months went by and again, a long story short, I asked

[20:56] it probably nearly 18 months of this since I first organised for the lockdown by having

[21:02] been made and spent $10,000 plus dollars.

[21:06] We ring your mouth and he says, now we can't do it.

[21:08] We just can't make it to your satisfaction, you're too fasty.

[21:13] I said, now I'm not.

[21:14] I said, I gave you two samples that I brought with me from Australia.

[21:18] That's what they have to look like, just like that.

[21:20] Now we can't do it, sorry.

[21:23] And that was the end of the matter.

[21:25] So we were then 18 months down the track and more than 10 grain was off and even worse

[21:32] than all that, back to square one, we still don't have a lockdown back.

[21:36] Yeah, you can extrapolate that across hundreds of parts of the indoor machine with the same

[21:41] issue.

[21:42] So why would you do it?

[21:44] It seems like you'd have to be somewhat crazy to want to make a pinball company in China

[21:51] making every single part over again when there are companies out there that have been making

[21:59] parts for decades that you could use to assemble a pin and get your game to market years

[22:06] in advance.

[22:07] But Mike does go on to explain later on the advantages to China and there are significant

[22:13] advantages.

[22:14] I mean, I'm not trying to say like it's all the dumb idea because it's not if he can

[22:20] really get it together and figure out, I think, a better theme and more advanced technologies

[22:26] in the game.

[22:27] He does have this significant advantage in making a more jam-packed game for a much better

[22:33] price than Stern because of the fact that he's making it in China.

[22:37] And I want to play a clip about that advantage right now.

[22:41] One of the advantages to being in China is that we can get nice little geared motors

[22:45] very cheap.

[22:46] We can get nice little mechanisms cheap.

[22:48] We can get printed circuit boards cheap.

[22:50] We're in a position where all of those things, the development times are the same, the

[22:54] development cost is probably the same pretty well anywhere in the world.

[22:57] But when it comes down to actually making the finished item, it's 10% of the cost of having

[23:04] that same item made elsewhere.

[23:05] And in fact, in Australia, you couldn't even make the thing because nobody makes little

[23:08] motors, they buy them from China like everybody does.

[23:11] So it's a nonsense to think that it could have been made.

[23:13] And so I've had it said to me many times by different people over the years that I'm a

[23:17] bad guy because I should have started building this in Australia.

[23:20] I'm not patriotic.

[23:21] I should have had it factually in Australia.

[23:22] Well, it never would have ever happened.

[23:24] It's just not a chance in hell this project would have happened because I simply couldn't

[23:27] have funded it.

[23:28] I wouldn't have had the money to pay the wages to have two people let alone 15.

[23:33] It's just wouldn't have had, would never have happened.

[23:35] So that is the distinct home pin advantage that by making games in China, Mike can get

[23:42] parts for so much cheaper.

[23:45] And because of that, he can let his creative teams and he can let the imagination of his

[23:49] designers go further because we all know that Stern Pimball is definitely cost cutting.

[23:57] They are cost cutting when it comes to engineering mechanisms.

[24:00] When it comes to putting more in machines, they are looking at machines and saying, well,

[24:05] we have this juggernaut theme.

[24:07] How much do we have to put in to sell it and how much can we take out or what should we

[24:11] not even bother designing because it would be too expensive to manufacture those mechanisms

[24:16] and those toys.

[24:17] We don't know fully yet what is in Thunderbirds, but I've said this before, I fully expect

[24:23] there to be way more underneath the play field of Thunderbirds than will be underneath the

[24:30] play field of Star Wars Ellie.

[24:34] And that is a big deal.

[24:38] I keep reading people, try to explain to me why they like Star Wars and all I'm getting

[24:43] from everyone is it's still pretty empty, it's still pretty bare and it's a drain monster.

[24:48] And it's not fun, it's just frustrating people.

[24:51] So I think this could be the thing that makes home pin competitive.

[24:56] This is a huge advantage for them.

[24:59] And if they can figure it out in a large scale production way, they could become a player

[25:05] within the pinball world.

[25:08] And it's too early to tell.

[25:09] It's too early to tell.

[25:10] They've been delayed and we all know making a few prototypes, it's much different than going

[25:16] into mass production.

[25:17] Okay.

[25:18] But he's building it slowly, which I give him credit because that's what you have to do.

[25:22] He's making a game for a few markets, not the major market, see how it goes and from there

[25:28] because he's got all the part manufacturing in house, it should be more seamless for

[25:33] him to get to games two and three if that happens.

[25:36] Okay.

[25:37] I've been saying I think Thunderbirds might be a little bit of a DOA dead on arrival title.

[25:42] But again, that's my jaded American point of view.

[25:45] I don't care less about this theme.

[25:48] Most people in America could, but he's not targeting us.

[25:51] Okay.

[25:52] So again, as a marketer, if he's targeting Australia, it's probably a great theme.

[25:55] So we do apologize for maybe being a little bit too strident on the theme at times.

[26:02] But okay, theme aside, there are just some real questionable decisions about what he's

[26:07] putting into this game and we're going to go into two of them and that's the display and

[26:11] that's the processor of the game.

[26:15] And I want you to hear what he says about the display.

[26:18] And this is another reason why when you interview someone like Mike and when you do interviews

[26:22] like these, you can't just write your question.

[26:25] It's a question down on a piece of paper, Ryan and Martin and then just follow that pattern.

[26:30] You actually have to, at some point, when someone says something that's really provocative

[26:37] or controversial, you need to follow up on what he's saying.

[26:40] And so I want you to listen to when Mike basically says that anyone who's using a pinball machine

[26:48] that has a PC running it is going to be upshits creeks in 20 years.

[26:53] These games are all going to break and that his model is better than what these new games

[26:57] are doing.

[26:58] I want you to hear what the next question is.

[27:01] They don't even question him on that.

[27:03] Marty just quickly gets back into his comfort zone.

[27:06] Listen to it, it's really funny that that's his follow up question when Mike makes such

[27:09] a bold statement.

[27:10] But let me play the clip for you now.

[27:12] You talked about how there was a color LCD before and that's kind of, that's being shelved

[27:18] and you've moved to a traditional Dame Day.

[27:22] Will the DMD be like the normal red dots?

[27:25] I will have a certain color to match the theme or...

[27:29] It's orange.

[27:30] It's like a traditional orange display LED, of course, we make it in house.

[27:34] And it's...

[27:36] When you see the game and the colors of the game and the DMD working it totally suits it,

[27:41] I've got to say that our dots, we've got two dot guys who are just brilliant.

[27:47] I don't know of a game.

[27:50] I don't know every game and I haven't seen every game.

[27:53] But I don't know of a game that's got better dots than the boots.

[27:56] It's really interesting because I had a conversation with a friend just quickly where we'll

[28:02] discuss LCD screens and to have a good looking LCD Pimble machine, I think it's so much harder

[28:10] and you can be a little bit harder critical because it's high resolution where dots,

[28:17] obviously, as I said, you're trying to emulate one of the best periods in Pimble,

[28:21] which is the Williams 90's era machines.

[28:25] Well, that's what I said I would do right from the start, that we weren't reinventing Pimble,

[28:29] we were going to make a WMS style machine and that's precisely what we've done right

[28:34] down to the display as well.

[28:35] Others have gone to the DMD, others have gone to the color LCDs.

[28:40] There's only one reason that a couple of them have done that and that's because you can

[28:43] just plug it into a PC and the way you go, it's dead easy, any clown can do that, put

[28:47] a bit of software in there and you're suddenly driving your screen, how easy is that?

[28:50] That's the only reason it was started because those people were using PC motherboards which

[28:55] I totally disagree with, it's ridiculous and sadly there's going to be a lot of disappointed

[29:00] people in a few years' time, I believe, again only my opinion.

[29:04] We'll see.

[29:05] The machines that are being built with PC motherboards are not going to survive 20 years

[29:08] like WMS machines have.

[29:09] Well, it's okay, so moving on to then-game play, which is my favourite thing, I'm a toy

[29:15] player, so that's all about the play.

[29:18] Once again, we get fucked by tournament players on pinball podcast, nobody cares about the

[29:24] flow of the game that we haven't even seen yet Martin, come on buddy, he just shit all

[29:29] over PC processors and you want to talk about flow?

[29:32] No, we're not going to talk about flow, but here's the thing, saying that you've got

[29:36] the best dots guy in 2017 would be like, oh man, I just made a new TV company and we're

[29:43] making the best standard definition TVs in 2017, it's idiotic to be bragging about, you've

[29:50] got the best dots in the game, nobody gives a shit about dots anymore and if you're going

[29:56] to go dots they have to be coloured.

[29:58] So look, when I hear stuff like this, it really makes me feel like this game has compromises

[30:05] and decisions have been made that make absolutely no sense.

[30:11] The other decision now, which is when you get this game, it's going to come with a board

[30:18] and it's going to be driven by a board that can't be upgraded, you can't update the code

[30:26] yourself.

[30:28] Mike is going to release this game, I want you to hear what he says, he's going to release

[30:31] this game, which he says is 99.9% done, but if they find any bug or any issue with it,

[30:38] there's nothing you can do, all you can do is send your board back to them for a new

[30:42] board, there's no chip you can pop in and out of, which during the Valley Williams day,

[30:47] you could, which means he's actually gone a step backward in terms of giving you an

[30:55] exact replication of how easy it used to be to upgrade to new code.

[31:00] So let me play that clip for you now.

[31:03] We intend to release it the same as WMS did, so that's ready to put on site, ready to

[31:07] play these machine, play it.

[31:10] So there's, so I mean, there's no USB, USB updating and I'll have to be a chip socket.

[31:17] There's no USB update, no, it requires programming and we deliberately didn't want to do it.

[31:23] I've seen too many people stuff up the upgrades and wind up bricking their board and they've

[31:28] got to send it back and it just goes on and on and on.

[31:30] Yes, there's plenty of that as it managed to do it successfully.

[31:33] There's an equal number that don't manage to do it successfully.

[31:36] There's a whole other bunch of people that don't want to know how to do it.

[31:42] So we made the decision when we had to redo that the USB update was in the original plan

[31:47] and it was on the original software and the original design, but we had to think long and

[31:52] hard about what we were doing and what was possible when we lost all that information.

[31:57] So we had to come back to reality a bit and what we decided was that we have had a

[32:03] lot of money to do.

[32:04] We were all spending a couple of months extra making sure that when we sell them a chain,

[32:07] it's 99% right.

[32:08] Barring any bugs, any software bugs or problems that someone finds that after playing 50 games

[32:14] at the pinball machine, flips over or something, I don't envisage that people will need to

[32:21] update it.

[32:22] I envisage that it will be 99% right when it bleeds here.

[32:26] When I heard this, I was even more worried for the game than I was when I heard it was

[32:32] going to have orange dots because all of us out there, every one of you, you all know

[32:37] one singular truth about pinball and pinball coding and the pinball experience and that

[32:43] is every single game out there, every single game out there could be polished more, could

[32:49] have code improvements, might have bugs that need to be fixed and there's never been

[32:54] a single game ever in the history of pinball probably that has released and been launched

[33:00] without anyone finding something to be improved upon or something wrong or some score that

[33:06] gets exploited.

[33:07] Now I'll say this, Ryan asks a really good follow up question here about how is Mike ensuring

[33:16] that the right type of players have put this game through the paces to ensure that when

[33:21] it's 99.9% complete, that it's good.

[33:25] That is good because remember, these are not like lineman sheets over there who's even

[33:28] playing this thing.

[33:29] So, I really like Ryan's follow up and I want you to hear it right now.

[33:35] Okay.

[33:36] So, two questions regarding that.

[33:39] A lot of pinball machines, people find like really good players find a scoring exploit

[33:45] or something where they just say, hey, if you just do this over and over again, you can

[33:48] get to the wizard mode in two minutes and this and that.

[33:50] So, you said you have your program that's been playing it for the last six months.

[33:57] I mean, is he that type of player that he has, has he looked at that?

[34:02] He's more a casual player, but he's been in a position where obviously he can hit the

[34:08] target with his fingers 20 times in a row to see if it doesn't anything crazy and then

[34:12] hit other targets and he's obviously spent an awful lot of time, more time than he wanted

[34:16] to as I'm reminded very often.

[34:22] He has put in an extraordinary amount of effort and time to polish this as nicely as he

[34:28] could and in fact he sent me a new update today, which I haven't looked at yet, but it's

[34:34] pretty much the final thing.

[34:37] Okay.

[34:38] But I'm not saying we can update Airboards, we can update them.

[34:41] Our agents will be able to update the board for you, that's not an issue.

[34:44] Take the main board in, he'll update it on the spot for you, done or post it to him or

[34:49] send you an exchange board, whatever.

[34:52] There's a programming socket on the board, it's doable, but it's just not doable by the

[34:56] end user.

[34:57] I don't want the end user fiddle software because they're going to step it up.

[35:02] Okay.

[35:03] Fair enough.

[35:04] So it's close to the Williams system, but Williams had that socket where you can remove

[35:09] the software and put it on, but your IC is surface mounted onto the board and there's

[35:16] a programming socket.

[35:18] Sadly, it is because you can't buy those chips in through-hull.

[35:21] Our board is pretty much through-hull, everything's through-hull.

[35:25] So the probably the word you never want to use when you're describing your game and

[35:30] what's in your game is the word sadly.

[35:34] And I think Mike realizes his error later on in the interview and he does explain that

[35:38] if they are to upgrade the game and upgrade the code, you could send your board to them

[35:45] and they will make the upgrade and send it back to you.

[35:48] Now, that seems like a real hassle to have to do that, to take your board out of your

[35:55] game, to send it to China, to have them upgrade it, to send it back to you, your game's

[36:00] out of commission while that's happening.

[36:02] Where every other manufacturer out there, the amount of time it takes to upgrade your game

[36:07] to the newest code is just a matter of maybe a minute or two and you're playing your game.

[36:12] Your game's not out of commission.

[36:14] So again, it really makes me wonder what's going on here.

[36:21] We have this brand new company that has at his doorstep, like Mike has access to so much

[36:29] information about what customers want, about what innovations other companies have made

[36:36] to make the experience of Pimbal and buying Pimbal and collecting Pimbal better and easier

[36:41] and more advanced.

[36:43] He's been able to see what technologies consumers have shown they love.

[36:48] Look how popular color DMDs are.

[36:50] Look how popular the new LCD screens are in Pimbal.

[36:55] When he and staring at all this information, he built a company and he clearly built it

[37:00] in a way that ignored a lot of the free data he had to make home pin even more competitive.

[37:11] I don't know why.

[37:13] I don't know really why.

[37:16] Only Mike can answer some of those questions and the other thing is this, when is home pin

[37:23] going to ship Thunderbirds?

[37:26] Is it even going to come out this year?

[37:28] By six months from now, I'll tell you right now on this podcast, you are going to see

[37:34] Guardians of the Galaxy, you are going to see Houdini, you are going to see Pirates

[37:40] of the Caribbean, you are going to see all these amazing new Pimbal machines roughly around

[37:46] the same price as these games.

[37:49] Now I get it, his market or guys in Australia who don't want to spend the big bucks to import

[37:54] these American games are really expensive there.

[37:58] But he is still not going to ship games as you are.

[38:04] He is definitely not going to ship games as you are.

[38:07] I think the response to the question if we would see games this year.

[38:13] Do people, the initial batch of, I think they are Australians that prior to the Pimbal

[38:18] machine, will they be expecting a shipment possibly this year or they did?

[38:26] No, I don't believe we will ship any this year for a lot of reasons and one of the main

[38:31] reasons is because we just cannot ship out a machine until we have crossed off all the

[38:36] things on our list of approvals as we spoke about earlier.

[38:41] Is that Mike from Home Pin or Andrew Highway talking right there?

[38:44] We have another Pimbal machine that is delayed because of license or approvals.

[38:50] Look, I think you guys should listen to the full interview over head to head Pimbal.

[38:56] There is a lot.

[38:57] It is a lot longer than the highlights I pulled out.

[39:00] He goes on to talk about a lot of other things.

[39:02] Why he didn't patent the lighted decals on a Pimbal machine.

[39:09] How he feels that patterning stuff is a waste of time.

[39:11] You spend too much time in court.

[39:14] He talks about a lot of the different challenges he faced when he was making the machine and

[39:18] the delays in the hurdle.

[39:19] It is a good interview.

[39:20] It is a good interview.

[39:21] Look, Mike is a risk taker.

[39:23] Anyone who goes into making Pimbal machines is taking a huge risk.

[39:29] All I can do for all of these individuals, I applaud them for going out there and making

[39:34] Pimbal machines.

[39:35] Let me tell you something.

[39:36] It is really hard to do it.

[39:37] It is a lot easier to have a Pimbal podcast where you are critiquing other efforts making

[39:41] Pimbal.

[39:43] What I wish everyone would do, because if I was going to go off and spend so much money

[39:48] and spend so much effort to enter into an industry or a category, I would do my homework

[39:55] first.

[39:57] I will always beat this drum because it never ceases to amaze me how ego and how looking

[40:07] at the past and how overconfidence quickly leads to business disasters and business failures.

[40:16] Especially in Pimbal, this is not a difficult industry to study.

[40:22] If I were to pick another industry, let's say the mid-size car segment, how do you figure

[40:29] out a way to break through the clutter when there are 12 different manufacturers offering

[40:34] the same product, the same price?

[40:37] It is not really that difficult to understand how to make a Pimbal machine that will satiate

[40:44] the demand of the people buying Pimbal machines in 2017-2018.

[40:51] Just in foremost, you have to have a great theme.

[40:56] You have to.

[40:57] That is the easiest pathway to sell.

[40:59] The second pathway to sell is you have to make an amazing game.

[41:02] Dialed in is an amazing game.

[41:04] It doesn't have a great theme.

[41:06] It is a new theme.

[41:07] It is not a theme that anyone even knew about or cared about.

[41:11] You have to give great value.

[41:13] You have to.

[41:16] In that aspect, look.

[41:18] I would say Mike's theme is questionable.

[41:20] I think that the value is going to be there.

[41:23] I do.

[41:24] I think the frustrating thing for me is, for the price of all Pimbal machines, whether they're

[41:30] $6,000 or $9,000 or $23,000 or Magic Girls or $50,000 King Pins, for the price you spend

[41:37] on any Pimbal machine, you never want to feel like you have to compromise something major

[41:43] or when you play the machine or you look at the machine, that there's something that you

[41:47] wish you could be changed.

[41:49] They would have done differently at the factory because there's not that many elements where

[41:55] the factory can't get the main things right.

[41:59] The fact that you'll look at this thing with orange dots and when you put it next to new

[42:04] machines and you put a brand new 2018 Thunderbirds next to a machine from a few years ago, it's

[42:13] going to look outdated.

[42:15] It's going to look outdated simply because of the display.

[42:18] I just think it's a shame that that was the decision that was made.

[42:22] I also think it's really strange that you can't update the code because we all know that

[42:27] players are going to find an issue with the game or bug or way to exploit the score immediately.

[42:33] Not like six months down the road immediately, right?

[42:37] There's just that level of like overconfidence that leads these new companies to make mistakes,

[42:47] to make mistakes.

[42:48] I want to leave you with one final thought.

[42:50] What's the biggest issue that's been plaguing most of the major manufacturers recently?

[42:57] And I'm going to end with this quote.

[42:58] We're just going to end with it.

[43:00] The biggest issue, the biggest quality issue that has really hurt the Pimbal hobby over

[43:05] the last couple of years is play field quality.

[43:07] We saw it on Ghostbusters.

[43:09] We saw it on Stern's new machines, ghosted inserts, chip play fields.

[43:13] We see it at Stern.

[43:14] We see it at Jersey Jack.

[43:16] We even saw it, you know, chip play fields with Chicago gaming.

[43:20] Okay, these three companies collectively have over a hundred years experience making Pimbal

[43:26] machines.

[43:27] They are incapable of making modern day machines that don't have these issues.

[43:34] So when asked if home pin Pimbal would have play fields that wouldn't suffer from any

[43:41] of these issues, a company that has never made a Pimbal machine before, a company that

[43:45] doesn't have any of the institutional knowledge of how to make Pimbal play fields made by people

[43:51] in China who have never made Pimbal play fields before ever, this is his response that they're

[43:57] going to, you know, to that question of will you have the same issues that people have

[44:01] been making Pimbal for decades are having?

[44:05] And then you just have to ask yourself, you know, who do I believe?

[44:10] And that's it for this episode of Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[44:13] Now, one last question, Mike, on the kind of the bill process of Thunderbirds.

[44:18] We've been seeing a lot of issues about the reliability of inserts in the clear coat process,

[44:25] namely in Stern Pimbal machines, but also some with, you know, even with Jersey Jack.

[44:31] And shipping, shipping, in certain parts of machines.

[44:34] How are you trying to mitigate making sure that the play field is cut, the insert artwork,

[44:41] and the clear coat process has been through enough reliability testing?

[44:46] Oh, we won't have any problems like that.

[44:48] We've resolved a title.

[44:50] We're doing everything in house.

[44:51] We have our own woodworking room.

[44:52] We cut all our own wood parts.

[44:54] The lot we manufacture the cabinet from the scraps, the play field from scratch.

[44:59] We make everything here ourselves.

[45:00] We don't time any of that out to other people where, you know, like I said, if the stuff we farm out is parts,

[45:06] pieces that then come back and then they subject to us making sure they're going to do our job and we assemble them.

[45:11] And if they don't, they get made again.

[45:12] And we do our own play fields and we resolve that problem totally.

[45:17] All right.

[45:18] They've totally resolved it.

[45:19] So you will see nothing of ghosting inserts, chip play fields, or anything that has plagued the people who have been doing it forever.

[45:27] Have a good day, everybody.
