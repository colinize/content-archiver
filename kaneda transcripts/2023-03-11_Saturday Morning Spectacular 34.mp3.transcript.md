[00:00] Alright, here we are.

[00:04] Saturday morning's the attack, like I can't even, I can't even keep up.

[00:08] I just had to watch a galactic tank force trailer, stuff's happening like as we're starting.

[00:15] There is like too much to talk about.

[00:19] I don't even know where to begin.

[00:22] We'll just let people come through the door first.

[00:25] We're going to start uploading these audios as podcasts for everybody who's out there in the world.

[00:33] Can you guys hear me okay? We got Miles in the house.

[00:37] We've got Kaneda in the house.

[00:39] We've got arcade innovations in the house.

[00:43] Let's get everybody through the door. Let's have a great Saturday morning spectacular. Let's talk about everything.

[00:48] I mean, I've never seen a period like this.

[00:52] Nobody's ever seen a period like this. This is going to be, like, my hat's all dusty.

[00:59] Dan is in the house. Dan is in the house.

[01:03] Marc Nellis is in the house. I'm going to fix this a little bit.

[01:08] Armin is in the house. Mark, Matt is in the house. Dan is in the house.

[01:15] Robert's in the house. Paul, what's up, buddy?

[01:21] What's up from Texas? Miles is in the house. Michael's in the house. Good morning.

[01:27] Diddy's Pimbo mods is in the house. Everyone's coming out of their mouse holes.

[01:33] Joe and Sam are in the house. Adam is in the house.

[01:39] Kimberly, welcome. Matt, what's up, brother? Dave Sanders. We are on Dave.

[01:48] Mr. Michael Huntsman is in the house. Patrick's here. Let's do this. Paul, Yo-Yo, Patrick.

[01:58] You know, once we started, maybe Jack Danger might join us. Mr. Pete Rosen, the stars master.

[02:05] Jack Danger might join us. Jengas is in the house. Will Christopher Franche join us.

[02:10] I had a lot of, I had a conversation with Franche this week. Robert is in the house.

[02:15] Mr. Franche is in the house. Mr. Franche, we're going to talk about Galactic Tank Force.

[02:21] We're going to talk about why Canada did not share any more imagery.

[02:25] We're going to talk about why we want this company to launch the game the right way.

[02:31] Canada has a heart. He doesn't want to hurt people's efforts. It's not why I'm here.

[02:36] I'm here to give you my opinions about their efforts. We just saw a little teaser video from Galactic Tank Force.

[02:42] Jeremy's in the house. Look, it is going to be, it is going to be a battleground for our wallets.

[02:52] Like I've never seen before in the history of Pimbo. I've been covering this hobby for seven years.

[02:57] The fact that everyone is dropping games on top of each other. Do you want me to tell you something right now?

[03:02] Steve is in the house. Charles Thomas in the house. Let me tell you right now.

[03:06] Albert's in the house. Do you guys know that Pulp Fiction is now on the line at CGC as a Raw Thrill's release?

[03:15] Like it's also on the line. Like Michael, what's up? Like we are about to get, I'm just going to say this from a macro marketer.

[03:26] A man who knows a little bit about marketing. Everybody dropping a game at the same time in this hobby is not smart.

[03:41] There's no way around it. It's not smart. It's not smart.

[03:47] And look, this wasn't the timing, but if you're a Pimbo company and you need like month one sales are always the strongest, right?

[03:57] The FOMO period of sales is always your strongest period. You got to avoid a Stern Pimbo launch.

[04:06] To launch right on top of a Stern launch is it makes no sense. And so and Stern telegraphs usually what their plans are and they and all the distros know like Stern will have a game in March and a new game in, I believe it's September, October, right?

[04:28] Because they're moving factories and not only did Stern telegraph what they were doing, they beat everybody to the punch.

[04:38] And so what I'm noticing now in the Pimbo marketplace landscape is an overabundance of new titles coming out all at the same time.

[04:50] All trying to get you excited, all trying to get your money, all trying to find space in your homes, and it's just not going to work for everybody.

[04:59] And nobody saw Foo Fighters coming out this early. Nobody saw Foo Fighters having this kind of approach.

[05:06] And the similarities, the similarities between three titles Galactic Tank Force, Scooby Doo and Foo Fighters is very, very, you know, even more difficult to differentiate your product from each other.

[05:24] You know, we've got these three colorful campy games that are fun for the family. And I think now we have all of them.

[05:33] Of course, it's great for buyers, John. Of course it is. As a buyer, I want to see this. I want to see everybody competing at the same time.

[05:43] I want to see everybody trying to like, you know, show us what they got because now we all have options at the same time.

[05:50] Now for a Pimbo company, really, really difficult to win. Yo, Daniel, welcome brother.

[05:57] So look, I think we're going to see an absolute bloodbath between all of these companies fighting it out because every single one of these companies needs to sell at least a thousand of their games to be somewhat, you know, breaking even on these titles.

[06:18] And, you know, now look, we're going to talk about that. Let's go into order now. We have 75 people. Let's go in order of the major news after, you know, look, I still to this day am annoyed that I got scooped and I knew it was the Godfather and everybody who we, we told you it was the Godfather.

[06:42] We've been saying it's the Godfather now for over a year, a year and a half. Everybody's been saying, you know, Godfather, Godfather, Godfather, then bunch of jackasses started saying Harry Potter, John Wick, like all of these things.

[06:59] It's going to be this. It's going to know it's going to be Godfather. And now that we know it's Godfather confirmed coming out what the seventh was that Tuesday, right?

[07:11] We are going to see the next game from Jersey Jack pinball. And I want to talk about that first. We are going to see Christopher franchise Godfather versus Christopher franchise galactic tank force. Absolutely crazy.

[07:24] Absolutely crazy. And, and franchise seen Godfather.

[07:30] And what did you tell me Christopher? You said you think Eric's game is going to be the sleeper hit of the year.

[07:38] I mean, look, clearly there's a lot in this game. When you look at the game from underneath, it's a spaghetti farm of cables and wires going to something, and which is good. Hopefully it's not just lights.

[07:53] But Mr. Franchi knows exactly what's in that game.

[07:59] I would just ask him he's here right now. Don't tell we know we know what both themes are. Which game is more loaded?

[08:07] Godfather or galactic tank force? Maybe he'll answer. Is that fair? Is that a fair question? We'll see. We'll see if I'll answer us.

[08:16] But let's stay on Godfather for a minute, because I want to talk about Godfather. I want to talk about, you know, all of us and collectively, all of us have been saying, you know, Godfather is a very questionable theme for pinball, maybe even a terrible theme for pinball.

[08:39] Yet Eric Minier is a wild card. People love and hate Eric's games. And I mean it when I say it. They love and hate his games. I'm going to call it like it is. There's love hate for pirates. There's love hate for guns and roses.

[08:56] It's been that way. And when you are an artist or a designer, it is sometimes okay to be polarizing like Canada, because people either dig what you're doing or they don't.

[09:10] Nobody can avoid what Eric's done in pinball. And I think that's a great thing about Eric's designs. I also think this third game by Eric is really going to be a moment in which he can show us and prove to us that he can also make a game that's not multi-ball heavy.

[09:30] If I were to say like what are people wishing from an Eric Minier game, no more multi-ball heaviness. It is inescapable and I've played guns and roses and I love it. It is absolutely like you are flailing at too many multi-balls. It's just too many. And you want to feel like you earn the multi-ball. You want to feel like you achieved it. And it can't come so often.

[09:54] So I think that's one thing. The other thing Eric's been criticized for is his flow. His layouts have not been praised as much as like, you know, I think he's capable of. A lot of it has to do because Eric's two games and there's no way around this. Eric's first two games also suffer from Jersey Jack Pinball's mushy flipper feel.

[10:19] John, we're going to talk about Galactic Tank Force. Just give me a chance to get there. Okay. We're going to talk about it. But Jersey Jack's first two Eric games have real mushy flipper feel. Fixed. It's fixed. It's better with Toy Story. It's still not as good as a stern machine. I mean, it's just not.

[10:40] But here's the thing about Godfather. This slow Italian drama about a mafia family. Look, here's the deal. It's a terrible theme for pinball. It shouldn't work for pinball. There's absolutely no way Godfather can become a good pinball machine, right? That's what we're all thinking.

[11:04] That's what we're all thinking. But I want to play devil's advocate for just a little bit right here. When I read the comments on pin site, when I hear what people say, when I hear what my own voice is saying, there is one thing going for Godfather right now that is actually the most powerful emotion you can do in the world of marketing.

[11:27] And the most powerful emotion you can elicit in the world of marketing is curiosity. Curiosity will drive more engagement than anything else. And I mean it when I say this game has people curious to see how can they, in a million years, make this work.

[11:52] And I think that is going to be the moment of next week is we are going to see Godfather translated into pinball, a game in which everybody is just curious to see what Jersey Jack does. It's not just that. Everybody is curious to see if Jersey Jack is going to load their games up again after Toy Story was a bismu failure.

[12:17] I don't want to go down that road, but Toy Story was one of the biggest jokes ever in the history of pinball launches. Jersey Jack has blocked me and banned me from their Facebook pages.

[12:29] I got in a back and forth with Ken Cromwell because I made fun of Pat Lawler and he told me to grow up, in which I told him the reason why I was so annoyed and perturbed.

[12:41] It was amazing. It was amazing. And I didn't need it in my life. I was going through so much crazy stuff personally and the guy tells me to grow up.

[12:51] I'm allowed to make fun of Pat Lawler. I don't need to show the man some respect. Total joke. You want to charge us 15,000 for that pinball machine. Again, Toy Story is going to be just like James Vaughn.

[13:06] It is totally going to be forgotten now that we have the next Jersey Jack game. We've got the next Jersey Jack game. Toy Story sales are just going to plummet.

[13:17] And for those of you saying guns and roses sales are plummeting, okay? Let me tell you this. Of course guns and roses sales are going south. They made so many.

[13:33] They made so many. There is no way a guns and roses le can hold any value. There's no way. There's so many of them. There's so many with busted play fields. And people just had their fix of GNR.

[13:46] So there's absolutely no way a guns and roses pinball machine is going to hold that much value two and a half years later. Two and a half years later. It's just not going to work.

[14:00] So I think what guns and roses is showing people, you're going to lose money on almost every game you buy now. You're going to lose money. You might lose two to $3,000.

[14:11] And again, that's why when you buy a pinball machine, you should play it two to 3,000 times. Because if you play your pinball machine two to 3,000 times, you haven't lost two to $3,000.

[14:25] That is, it is that simple. But for you collectors out there that put 200 plays on your games and then sell it for $3,000 loss, you absolutely are making no sense to anybody.

[14:39] Like play your freaking games. I don't understand. If you have a brand new pinball machine, I would put 50 plays on it easily in just a few hours on the first weekend I owned it.

[14:53] So how can you own a pinball machine? All right. First of all, just let me put a pin in this. A Batman SLE just sold this past week for $30,000. Okay. $30,000.

[15:07] So like buying Batman SLE for $25,000 was a good buy. So all of you Batman SLE, Canadian or hypocrite, no, you don't get it. I bought, I bought a machine for 25K that will never sell for less than that.

[15:27] It will only sell for more. So just remember that I didn't, I didn't get ripped off. The market has spoken. Stern is never going to make only 80 SLEs of anything ever again. Okay.

[15:40] So Jersey Jack's Tuesday is going to be the thing. Okay. It's going to be the thing. And I'm excited to see it. I'm going into Tuesday skeptical.

[15:52] I'm going into Tuesday curious. I'm going into Tuesday hopeful that Jersey Jack pinball can at least give us a game that looks somewhere close to the price of the machine, because the other big part is this.

[16:08] The other big part is this. If they charge 12 to $15,000 for Godfather, here's the problem with the launch of the game though. Like, I don't know how you go in on a Godfather's CE.

[16:20] You notice we haven't gotten like the Jersey Jack obligatory video. Oh, here's your best chance of securing a CE on Tuesday. We're not hearing any of that this time.

[16:30] And I mean it when I say it. I would not buy whatever they show us next week. And I'll tell you why. I wouldn't buy anything until April.

[16:40] And I've been saying this on my show. I'll say to you guys right now. I don't care if it's Scooby Doo, if it's Foo Fighters, if it's Godfather, Galactic Tank Force, Pulp Fiction, Queen, Scott Denisi's new game.

[16:53] Why would you buy anything right now? You are not going to have a hard time getting anything. And I mean this anything. If you wait to April.

[17:05] And if you run in, because here's what's going to happen. If you go and you buy Godfather Collector's Editions for $15,000, here's what you have to do.

[17:15] You have to put a $2,500 non-refundable deposit down on the game. Why would you do that? Why wouldn't you just wait a couple months and see where the market ends up on the game?

[17:28] There's no way they're going to sell a thousand CEs at $15,000. No way. And then what's going to happen is they're going to start selling for less than $15,000.

[17:38] And you don't have to have a non-refundable deposit. You don't have to lose money if you don't want the game. Let me tell everybody what's going on with Toy Story.

[17:48] If you waited, right? If you waited, if you really wanted a Toy Story, if you waited, you now can buy a new in-box Toy Story Collector's Edition for $11,500.

[18:02] It's almost saving yourself $4,000. You don't even have to pay tax. You just give, you show up to the distributor with $11,500 cash and the things in the back of your freaking truck.

[18:14] If you just waited, there's no FOMO around any of these games. You know, Foo Fighters brought some FOMO back. How long it will last, we will see.

[18:27] I mean, guys, I'm going to tell you, I got invited by Dodge to go to their last kill road, you know, road kill event, last call road kill event in Vegas, March 20th.

[18:40] Dodge invited me as a demon owner. And the rumor is, because I held on to my demon for five years and didn't sell it, that the last car might be a demon red eye with a thousand horsepower, and I might get one of the first chances to buy it directly from Dodge.

[18:59] So I'm flying into Vegas. Event is March 20th. Yours truly will be their front row with his demon owner VIP seat. And I will find out if I get a chance to buy the car. And of course, I'm going to buy it.

[19:18] Is there no sound? All right. So here's the thing. Here's the thing. I would just wait and see. I think if you wait and see, you're going to be in a better position to make a while.

[19:28] Like we have 109 people here. It's great. It's great. We're more people watching this show than we ever have before. Let me talk about, I'm going to jump around a little bit. I'm going to jump around a little bit.

[19:39] Here's the thing. Godfather, boom, hitting us next week. All you Harry Potter people. What the hell were you doing? Christopher Francis artwork is going to crush it.

[19:54] Straight down the middle has already shot their video. So you're going to see Greg and Zach analyze the game probably next week. You're going to get one of those like good 10, usually 20 minute deep dive videos into the game.

[20:07] I've heard Francis artwork is absolutely killer. I heard he might actually just make the game. It might even just be so beautiful that you want to based on the art.

[20:18] But let's see what happens. And I think, you know, let's go on to Galactic Tank Force. Friends, we're going to talk like, look, this isn't good news. This is not good news for American Pimble.

[20:33] They're going to be last out of the gate. They needed to show Galactic Tank Force today, not a teaser of the animations. And I just saw the teaser of the animations. It's like the video spends more time telling a score bit is part of the game.

[20:51] It doesn't show us much. And I'm sorry, American Pimble. You can't do this. You're showing people less than anybody else. You need to show more to get people excited about this original IP game.

[21:06] And now you're going to launch this game after Spoo Fighters. You're going to launch it after Jersey Jack Pimble. You can't be last. You can't be last. You don't have Matrix. You don't have back to the food. You don't have enough to be last.

[21:23] That was actually game animation.

[21:33] So, so now, okay, Frenchy, now that's confusing because people think that's what the game animations are going to look like.

[21:43] And now you're telling me it's not game animations. So are the game animations better than that? Because that looks really cool and people are excited about it. And so now you've got confusion.

[21:57] You know, when we saw Spoo Fighters, what did they show us? They showed us the actual animations of the game.

[22:04] I don't understand. Like, so now you got a teaser out that everyone thinks this is what the animations are going to be very comic book style. And it's not that.

[22:16] I just, you can't do it like this.

[22:20] Like, and David Fix is going to drop off games at Jack Bar. It's happening following Saturday.

[22:31] But not, but it's from the game, but not the LCD screen. Okay, so now that's a piece of artwork that is either on the play field or the cabinet.

[22:41] But you see what I'm saying, man? You see what I'm saying is I'm trying to help. I'm trying to help. And look, I did not release the leaked image I have of Galactic Tank Force.

[22:54] And I told people, I told people if they renew their subscriptions to Canada Spinball Podcast, I would give it like, okay, I get it. I get it.

[23:03] And then I reached out to Mr. Fix and Mr. French and said, look, you know, like the game's coming out in two weeks.

[23:11] I actually think me leaking the image would have been helpful for them because it shows a packed play field. It just does.

[23:20] Like, it's at least something to make you wait on buying, you know, Spoo Fighters or Godfather, if you will.

[23:29] But, you know, I do feel they worked really hard on this game. Norman worked really hard on this game. I think you should get to see it the way they want you to see it.

[23:41] Yeah, no, French, I agree. You know, so like, I just think like they've been holding back too much. And here's what I think. And I'm just going to say this.

[23:57] I think Nordman and David Fix, 150% miscalculated what was going to happen. Okay.

[24:05] I think Fix miscalculated that Foo Fighters would hit when it did. I think, I think Fix completely, completely got blindsided by what's just happened.

[24:19] And now he's got to release a game after the two biggest pinball juggernaut companies in the world. And he, and he thought he was going to release a game.

[24:29] Like, American Pinball should have released Galactic Tank Force when everybody was complaining and moaning about James Bond, about the lack of assets, about the crappy mechs in the game, about the embarrassing 60th anniversary.

[24:44] You had your window, American Pinball. I'm just going to say this. You had your window when everybody was unsatisfied with James Bond, you needed to get your game out.

[24:56] You, you had that window. You had this little window of like three months. You should have dropped the game in December. You would have sold so many of them because nothing else was available that people wanted.

[25:10] James Bond people had empty coded games. James Bond 60th is a joke. You've got, you know, Scooby Doo, but now, and Scooby Doo arguably doesn't have a lot in it from a, from a mech standpoint.

[25:22] You've got this game and you waited too long. And now you got to fight against your own dude. You got to go to war against your own artist because he's going to be on, on freaking Eric Miniers' godfather.

[25:41] And you, you, you can't, you, you, like they just, what the heck were you doing? This is what I don't get. Nobody was buying legends of Vahala. So what were you doing all this time?

[25:55] And you needed to get it out earlier. And I think what's going to happen is I think Galactic Tank Forest is going to run into a Foo Fighters buzzsaw. I just don't, I, I, if there's any game people are going to just wait.

[26:09] And you know what? Also I heard, and again, David Fix call me up, stop, stop ghosting Canada. They're coming out. Are you wait, are you ready for this? They have four versions of the game for how are you going to release four versions of Galactic Tank Force for variations?

[26:34] Like what, what is going on over there? The only time you can release four versions of something is if there's so much demand that you can slice it up like that, like Metallica could do that, Elvira could do that, Batman could do that, Ghostbusters could do, you can't release four variations of a original IP game about tanks fighting in space, saving the ice cream.

[27:01] Yeah, that's part of the theme is save the ice cream. They just need to get it together. But I don't know if they don't hit this one out of the park, because Norman's next game, Norman's next game is his Whitewater sequel from Deeproot.

[27:19] And that's what he's doing next. I mean, all that work you did at Deeproot on his Whitewater sequel, that's what's after Galactic Tank Force. You just heard it here. Is that an exclusive?

[27:32] Well, we didn't talk about slash on Godfather music. People do like ice cream. People do like ice cream. But look, I just think American Pinball made it more difficult on themselves. I think American Pinball completely misread the market.

[27:49] And I think Foo Fighters absolutely got in front of everybody. And I think Foo Fighters looks really cool. It looks like a lot of fun. Let's talk about Foo Fighters a little bit, because I haven't done, you know, Saturday morning, since we saw the streams.

[28:06] I didn't watch the pro stream yet. I don't really care. I saw enough with the LE stream of the game. Happy Stern stream the LE first. That's how you should do it. Somebody needs to tell the rule guys to just stop talking. I don't need two hours of Ray Day just going on and on and on about stuff that nobody, like, it's just, it's not enjoyable.

[28:30] Foo Fighters, here's the thing about Foo Fighters. I want to be completely candid.

[28:35] I'm getting closer to the to the phone. Okay, you ready?

[28:47] Foo Fighters is a better Scooby-Doo. It out Scooby-Doo Scooby-Doo. We're going to talk about that. But what what I like about Foo Fighters is this.

[28:56] They made a decision to make not a music pin, but a pin that's basically like Raza meets Scooby-Doo, you know, meets like campy 80s Saturday morning cartoons. Okay, so I think Scooby-Foo. Thank you, Mr. French. I think Scooby-Doo got out Scooby-Doo.

[29:18] The thing about, here's the thing about Foo Fighters gang. It's the sum of the parts. It's the sum of the parts. You know, people always say, Gunja Roses has no mechs in it. And, and, and I always say it's the sum of the parts.

[29:33] Does the game, does the game accomplish what it's trying to do in its theme integration and delivery? And I think Foo Fighters absolutely does.

[29:46] I think it's one of the most beautiful looking stern machines from the play field itself. I think it's beautiful. I think the scopes are fun. I think the way that I think it's the best animation stern pinball has ever done in the history of stern pinball.

[30:04] I think Foo Fighters is going to win best animations at next year's Twippies. And it's going to be probably one of the first time Jersey Jack pinball does not win best animations.

[30:13] I think the, okay, but let me, let me go over everything. Do I think Foo Fighters for this much money could have had, you know, major mech in it that, yes, like, let me, let me give you an example.

[30:27] You got an alien, you got tractor beams, you got like, you know, getting in. I still think like there could have been like a disappearing magnet, you know, where like the alien spaceship like steals your ball.

[30:43] I don't, there's not like one wow, wow, wow mech in the game, right? There's no Godzilla building, there's no, you know, slimer, there's no, it's, you know, there's no T Rex, right? I think when people look at some of sterns like greatest games, there's no Elvira house.

[31:06] That being said, that being said, the flow looks great. The shots look super fun. There's a lot happening in the game. And like the end, again, it's the sum of the parts. You put together the theme, the animations, the shots, the dead post, what's in it, the layout, and you put it all together.

[31:31] And you package it up and it's a damn, damn impressive offering from Stern and Jack Danger and Zambietti and Tano and Ray Day and all these guys. Now, okay. Okay, okay.

[31:46] Look, look, and I know people are comparing it to Godzilla. This is the problem now in all of Pimble. This is the problem in all of Pimble. Godzilla Ellie was $10,500 right Godzilla Ellie.

[32:11] And it was easy to get. I got one. I got two. It was $10,500. And look at what's in Godzilla Ellie. And this is the problem with Pimble.

[32:23] Foo Fighters is $2,500 more than Godzilla was from an Ellie trim. They don't want us to remember any of that. And, and you know, I look, I love Jack's game, but I'm just seeing these $13,000 now.

[32:46] And I'm like, I just don't see how you can say that Foo Fighters is $2,500 more expensive now than Godzilla.

[32:58] And other shows don't want to talk about it like this. They want to sell you what you're seeing in front of your eyes. They want to blind you with beautiful artwork.

[33:07] They want to blind you with great animations, but $2,500 more. It's just not, it's just not making people feel great. And now this is like everything's just going to keep going up.

[33:24] And I just don't, I don't feel good about any of these prices now. I don't. And I, and I just think like when you see it and people start to sort of, you know, you get, and I mean it when I say again, when you get past the one day, I got to have it now FOMA, right?

[33:49] It's usually 24 hours. You, you can wake up two days later and you're like, I'll just wait. I'll wait. I'll wait. Do I think there's going to be Foo Fighter, Elise available? Yes.

[34:06] Do I think Jersey Jack is going to sell a thousand Godfather CEs at 15K? Absolutely no way.

[34:15] The other thing is this. Do I think there are a lot of people now who pre-ordered Scooby-Doo, who are now absolutely regretting what they did? And I'll tell you why they're regretting it.

[34:31] We're seeing more and more Scooby-Doo gameplay, right? More and more. And we're seeing it by better players. It looks nowhere near as good as like Foo Fighters.

[34:44] It looks a little bit, shall I say, not as exciting. Let me use, let me use the negatives of positive words. It looks like it's not as, there's not as many mechanisms, you know?

[35:00] And I think what's happened is, you know, people are looking at the animations in Spooky's Machine. They're looking at like the total package. And they're realizing that maybe, maybe we're all starting to wake up from the coma that a Scooby-Doo with Butter Cabinet invoiced to your door is $13,000.

[35:27] So we'll see. No, but Michael, here's the thing. Here's the thing. The reason why I just wouldn't have pre-ordered a Scooby-Doo is we're going to start to see more and more availability of the game as they make 30, 40 a week.

[35:44] And then you're going to be able to get it for less than it was new. And you're also, the reason why Scooby-Doo prices are going to go down is because of Foo Fighters.

[35:52] The reason why James Bond prices are going to go down is because of Foo Fighters. Again, all you got to do is wait and see. And I'm saying, gang, I mean it when I say it. Like, do you buy every new car the day it gets launched? Do you buy every new watch when a watch gets released into the world?

[36:12] Here's the best news for everybody. If everybody waits, everybody gets their games for less other than the early adopters. Let the early adopter rich guys buy everything right away.

[36:30] Totally. The early adopter rich men, they can swoop in and buy everything right away. Let them buy it. Let them put these games in their mansions, put less than 200 plays on them, and then you can buy it for like $1,500 less.

[36:48] And then you're not spending $2,000 on a cardboard box. These games are treated, they treat these games better than their wives. We know this. We know this. You guys all know this.

[37:00] You know what I'm saying? They spoil these games more than their children. These are like museum pieces. They never play them, the rich collectors.

[37:11] Trickle down pinball is right. I just think, look, that's just my approach to it. You know? I just think that's where we're at.

[37:27] Look, and also like gang, I've been covering this hobby for seven years. I've never seen it where almost everyone's going to lose thousands of dollars in just one year of ownership.

[37:38] That's going to slow down the FOMO buying too. Because gang, come on. It's not like all of these games coming out are your dream themes bolted to the floor.

[37:49] Like John Erlich's never going to sell Foo Fighters because he loves Foo Fighters. Foo Fighters has a foil decal cabinet. It's the foil, but it's not like the 3D one.

[38:03] I'm buying, but not thinking. Billy, you're not, look, for you guys out there whose checking accounts have eight figures and you know who you are.

[38:20] For you guys out there with your, you know, eight, nine figure and there's some of you eight, eight, nine figures, man. For some of you guys out there, I'm not talking to you.

[38:29] You can do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want. You shouldn't even be here right now. You know what gives me pride?

[38:39] That me and my one bedroom apartment in New York City has people that are worth like tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. They're giving me their time.

[38:51] I get more pride from that than anything that somehow I found a way to, you have deemed me valuable enough to spend 90 minutes of your precious Saturday morning here.

[39:04] That's the greatest achievement of my life.

[39:09] You know, like you guys have so much money, you could be on, you could be business classing into Tokyo right now, you could be doing, you could be eating, you know, fogra and otoro for breakfast.

[39:22] But here you are and your wives and your partners and your kids like, why are you listening to this jackass again?

[39:30] Because you're bored. Because you're bored, because money's boring. Money is only fun when you're spending stuff or getting excited about the next thing.

[39:42] Alright, so look, to summarize, Godfather on Tuesday, let's talk about Slash. Slash is absolutely going to be in this game.

[39:51] Slash does the Godfather solo every time he does his guitar solo at Guns N' Roses concerts. He's a huge fan of the Godfather.

[40:00] I fully expect there to be a Slash Godfather solo integrated into the game somehow.

[40:05] The big questions for Godfather, other than like what the heck's going to be in it, are they going to get clips from the movie?

[40:12] Are they going to have muted clips? Will they have voice, the actors voices? Will they get Al Pacino to do call outs?

[40:18] Because Slash is friendly with Al Pacino. All of this stuff. Is it going to be just Godfather 1? Will it be Godfather 1 and 2?

[40:27] Please don't put Godfather 3 in it. So that's where we're at. That's where we're at, okay?

[40:35] Money does not buy happiness people. The happiest people, well you need a little bit of money though. You can't be happy broke.

[40:43] You can't. You can't be happy broke. You be stressed out every day.

[40:49] Now you don't need a lot. You just need enough or you don't have to think about it every day.

[41:01] It's only Godfather 4. Someone said like the dumbest thing on Pinside. It's an all original Godfather adventure.

[41:12] I'm like are you serious? Are you serious?

[41:16] Now but Albert, you're not broke. You just live within your means. And Albert, that's the difference.

[41:22] You live within your means. You live where you can afford and you get by that way.

[41:29] You're not like Albert. You're much happier than someone who lives in a multi-million dollar house that's over-mortgaged, is underwater financially terribly, is in a huge amount of debt,

[41:40] and who just lost their job because they thought they were going to work until their 70s and they got forced into early retirement.

[41:47] See Albert, it's all about living within your means or below your means. Because when you do that, you don't feel stressed.

[41:58] The biggest trap in all of society is to try to make your perception equal your reality and spend too much, flex too much on the surface, and go into way too much debt.

[42:17] Just to have the perception of how great you are.

[42:27] It's why I'm in this damn one bedroom apartment still. We're going to get out.

[42:31] But I have no debt. I have savings. I have cash flow every month enough to buy Batman SLD stupidly. What am I doing?

[42:50] I'll tell you this, it's stupid. When I bought Batman SLD, I should have just put the 25,000 into Metastock when it was $86 a share. Now it's $186.

[42:59] I would have made, turned 25 into 50, paid some capital gains tax on that in a year, and walked away like a smart grown adult, or just buy a bunch of pinball machines we don't need.

[43:10] What are you doing, Canada? This is your whole topic.

[43:12] Alright, let's do this people. What else are we forgetting? I don't know.

[43:26] The Scooby-Doo Streams, man. Have you guys seen these Scooby-Doo Streams?

[43:33] Let me ask you guys a question, because I just want to make a comment.

[43:39] When Scooby-Doo themselves, when Scooby-Doo, when Spooky themselves, when they streamed their own game at their own factory, the game they made, and it looked slow, and it looked floaty, and it looked easy, they then, days later, said they didn't set their game up at the right pit.

[44:09] Do you believe that, do you actually buy that excuse that the company who made the game, who's streaming it for the entire world for the first time, set it up wrong?

[44:30] They don't know how to set up their own game? Knowing that everyone was going to go off of that?

[44:36] Huh. Huh.

[44:44] They're not the engineers, Craig, they just bug and luke and all of them. Does everyone in design the game? Hey guys, is the pitch right?

[44:53] Maybe we shouldn't, it looks a little, and also, here's what I don't get. If they were playing the game they've been working on for all this time, wouldn't they be the first people to notice? Hey, it's playing a little slow?

[45:10] Hey, it's playing a little floaty. Wouldn't they be the first people to catch that? Like, what's going on here?

[45:18] This is why Canadian Bimbo Podcast is a thing. It's like, no, anyone's like, eh, well, you know, we're here to celebrate everything Bimbo.

[45:30] Let's talk about, let's talk about how irrelevant the topics at the Twippies are going to be this year. Let's talk about that. Are we really going to sit in a room and celebrate Rush Bimbo?

[46:00] I need to get my cargo shorts tournament back up, people. I know I've been so busy this week, so much else has been happening. The cargo shorts, I might have to skip the Elite 8 and get right to the Final Four and just bump the four cargo shorts that got the most votes to the Final Four for you to vote, because I need time to get these cargo shorts.

[46:20] I need to book my flights to Texas. I need to call Perry Steakhouse and secure the happy hour, the Canadian happy hour on Friday. Not going to lie, so much is just happening that, like, I haven't really been focused on TPF yet.

[46:40] But, Clint, why isn't the cargo short joke funny? Does anyone else think my cargo short joke is not funny? I think it's funny. All these grown men just in cargo shorts. Like, why is it, that's like the uniform of the Pimbo guy.

[47:08] Anyone who takes the cargo short joke seriously or is offended by it, and if you wear cargo shorts, I think everybody, the Canada Army, we should wear as many, it should be the cargo shorts happy hour, like, it's not funny. See, everybody says it's not funny. I can tell who wears the cargo shorts. It's fine.

[47:33] You're still here. You know, what's funny is when I said, you know, I would release the Galactic Tank Force photo, then I did the survey, by the way, like 60 something percent of people said, don't release it.

[47:46] I will say this. The thing is this. People have a good heart. You want to see American Pimbo release it the right way. But here's what was funny. Someone was like, because like 36 percent of people said release the photo.

[48:12] Someone wrote, if you don't release the photo, 36 percent of people are going to leave your, your subscription. And I'm like, are they? Like, where are they going to go? Why would they leave because of that? It's not like I've been misleading you guys all these years.

[48:32] You know, it's been funny. Everyone's now asking for Patreon support. Have you noticed that? Like legit, like, I want to congratulate Pimbo Party, Jason on the Patreon train now. Congrats.

[48:52] You know, everyone made fun of me. You know, Jason has seven subscribers, seven. So, you know, I think if Jason did what he said he was going to do at the beginning, which was fill the weekly void with pinball news.

[49:10] Now we have the new guy filling the weekly void for free. Do you know, you guys have heard Don's pinball podcast. I mean, look, I think that's what that's the way to go. That is the way to go. It's like Don is on it. He's always hitting when it's timely.

[49:27] And he knows the sweet spot. Gang, gang, much like pinball prices, the notion of like 90 minutes, two hours shows, two freaking hours. I'm covering off in the most entertaining and energetic way with the best pinball podcasts I've ever done.

[49:48] And they're 25 minutes at most now. 20 minutes, like 20 to 25 minutes at most is all you need. Like, why are we interviewing people? Like it's just so funny to me when it's all turned into like, what do you think about this? What do you think about it? Bob? What do you think about it?

[50:07] What do you think about it? Joe? What do you think about it? Craig? What do you think about? What do you think about? Like what? What about just one person who nails the POV? Just tell us what you think about it. Everyone's still like celebrating. I mean, it's all very positive.

[50:24] Yeah, but Joe Rogan is making $200 million interviewing some of the world's most interesting personalities. He's not interviewing Keith Elwing. Okay. He's not interviewing George Gomez. Are you okay? Let's not let's not let's not pretend here that Joe Rogan and his is just like an and people are just listening to him all throughout the day.

[50:54] And he's like, look, if you want to pay me $200 million or $20 million a year, I'll talk for four hours.

[51:05] No, as when everybody says, I mean, look, the long form stuff, when you guys are commuting when you're mowing the lawns when you're like, I get it, I get it.

[51:15] But you always have to get through so much stuff to get to this stuff. Albert, I love you, brother. I know Albert's around the one hour mark. Like Albert, Albert, you can do an hour with like it with with just like a static image dropped of galactic tank force treads and Albert would be on there for an hour and now

[51:36] I mean, Albert, I get that you like food fighters. I'm not going to listen to an hour of how you like the band. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it, brother. I'll buy your coffee.

[51:48] I'll come on your show after the Twippies, but I can't take an hour of somebody telling me how they like the food fighters.

[51:55] Two times feet.

[52:01] What's up, flip Stevens.

[52:04] You know, it's crazy gang is like, how the heck is Pulp Fiction going to get dropped into the middle of this, this moment?

[52:12] A single level. Pulp Fiction now has a ramp.

[52:17] All right, you know what I want to do right now?

[52:23] I want to have a moment. Can we have a moment of silence? Can we have a moment of silence, everybody?

[52:28] Let's do it. Let's do my Canada, my Canada G Shock. This is a Tetsuo one. No, yes, Tetsuo.

[52:37] Let's do a moment of silence, everybody, 30 seconds.

[52:42] Actually, let's do it for 60 seconds. I know 60 seconds is a long time and I'm going to ask everybody, please don't chat. Please don't type.

[52:53] Please don't do anything when I start the stopwatch. Let me take this off. This is a cool watch.

[53:00] It's got the Neo Tokyo Akira.

[53:09] I'm going to do, let me figure out where is the stopwatch.

[53:14] Where is it? Okay.

[53:18] Okay.

[53:22] Stopwatch. Now, how do I start it?

[53:36] Hold on. There we go. All right.

[53:45] All right. Sorry, game.

[53:47] Okay. We're going to do 60 seconds. I'm going to do it here. I have it at four seconds. So we're going to go to a minute four, five seconds.

[54:03] I want you guys 60 seconds of silence. Please, nobody, please have some respect for these people. Okay. Please have some respect.

[54:12] 60 seconds of silence for all the fools that bought James Bond 60th and nobody cares anymore. And the games are going to be delivered next week and no one cares because everything else coming out makes it look like the biggest joke in cash grab and pinball history.

[54:30] So let's do 60 seconds of silence for these grown men who clearly they needed help. They needed an intervention. Let's do it. The game's a joke for $20,000 is the biggest joke in pinball history. Let's do it. Hold on a second.

[54:49] Ready? No one type 60 seconds.

[55:19] Okay.

[55:49] Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, you buyers out there, I'm sorry what you did. If you had thought about your purchase for just 60 seconds.

[56:10] It's just funny. No one cares. Like, can you can you see the incredible shrinking interest in James Bond now? Like nobody cares. Nobody cares at all. And I'm glad I'm glad people like don't care. I'm glad nobody's going to be envious when you unbox this game and a

[56:32] pro for a third the price is 10 times better. It's it's good. You're all going to own something. No one's going to get no one's going to be envious or want to buy it and and Bill Brand is you don't get it Bill. You don't get Batman SLE Bill. You just don't get it.

[56:49] People want Batman SLE. People will buy it off me for more than 25,000 bill. You're a man that understands Ben Crane. You said the same thing. Hey, Ben, hey, Ben, can I ask you a question because all you do is mope on my page every time you're here.

[57:10] Now I got you here Ben. Ben, can I ask you a serious question? Why are you here? Are you are you having fun? Are you having fun always complaining about everything I say and right? I'm just curious because now that I got you like you can't hide can hide with your snarky posts. Where else would you go Ben? Where else would you go? What are the page would you go to?

[57:34] Oh, it's on the background and you're working hard. You're working hard finding the and you're finding it. What do you do for work brother? Come on.

[57:42] Ben, I know you're not a fan of me. I know you come on and just complain about everything I say every day. Ben Crane again with the the the the the the sassy. You're a surgeon. Wait, you're at work as a surgeon watching Canadian Spinball podcast. Okay, that doesn't seem very responsible.

[58:07] But no Ben, serious, serious question. Do you like my content or are you annoyed by it? Like I'm just curious because I because because like I'm very I'm very lenient on the trolls on my page. But I'm just curious because I'm not sure with you brother. I'm not sure where you're at.

[58:27] Yeah, he's I just I don't get it. I don't get it. This is it. So I entertain you now are you a fan? Are you a fan? Are you not Ben? Let's ask direct questions. Are you a fan of the show or not?

[58:45] You make an ass of yourself sometimes, but it's fun to watch. Okay. Okay. Okay. And he's a fan. All right. All right. Todd Tuck is enough. Well, look, we used to bring Todd Tuck on. Well, Ben, I'm glad I can amuse you and entertain you and and and honestly, bro, I'm not a fan.

[59:15] You're a doctor. Thank you. It's a very admirable profession. And I have a lot of respect for the medical community. It's like, like, should I do my job? Pesci, like what? Like I make you laugh like I'm a clown. Like what white?

[59:29] Oh, gang. I'm excited, though. I don't know about the rest of you, but like, there's, there's so much happening in the next three weeks, that all of us are going to just have our

[59:41] pinball collective minds blown by just the amount of options. The there will be winners and losers. Todd Tuck is in the house. Todd.

[59:51] Gabriel. Fantastic. September. Gabe, I love you, Gabe. I gave just hired a foo fighter band. Gabe, it's hard to talk about September now.

[01:00:00] I'm not going to talk about September now. I'm not going to talk about September. I'm not going to talk about September. I'm not going to talk about September.

[01:00:11] Gabriel. Fantastic. September. Gabe, I love you, Gabe. I gave just hired a foo fighter band. Gabe, it's hard to talk about September now, bro. It's freaking March. Okay. It's too early to hype the September show.

[01:00:27] I think, look, Gabe, Gabe, I think it was a smart move getting a foo fighter's cover band. I think that's going to be a good, a good relevant band to have there.

[01:00:40] Frenchy, man. Let's ask Frenchy. Frenchy, you want to come on? Frenchy, what, which game do you think is going to be more successful? Godfather Galactic Tank Force?

[01:00:59] I mean, Godfather's going to be, I just think I just can't see Godfather being more successful than Toy Story and Toy Story wasn't successful at all. I just have such a hard time with the theme.

[01:01:17] I, you know, makes me curious. It makes me interested to see what they can do. I can, let me just say this though. Let me say this though. Jersey Jacks Marketing Department. All right. I know they hate me. They hate my guts.

[01:01:34] They asked me to grow up. So let me act like a baby for a little bit because I'm not going to grow up. Ken.

[01:01:41] Ken, I don't want to grow up. I want to be a Toys R Us kid. Okay. 46 years old. Not growing up. If I'm this way at 46, Ken, I'm going to be this way probably for the rest of my life. Okay. I'm not going to grow up. Jersey Jack Marketing Department.

[01:01:58] Can you come up with a new idea? Are you able to come up with a new strategy? Like you did the same thing again. You do designer standing next to the game upside down. And then you do a teaser pick. Then you reveal the title and that's all you ever do.

[01:02:20] And then we're going to get that overly polished video from the production company that does all your video. That's it. Like there's never a different approach. I don't like just, they should have done something more with Godfather. I mean it.

[01:02:35] Godfather, it's just not a tape my money now throw money at it theme. And I just, I don't know. I feel like a lot of JJPs mojo and swagger is gone since Toy Story. And there's nothing else.

[01:02:51] I don't, I don't know. I don't know. Like they, but like nobody expected Foo Fighters to come out when it did. It's going to, it's going to, it's going to, it's just like there's only so much money you can, you can, you can take from the market.

[01:03:11] And I did all the people that ordered, all the people that ordered Foo Fighters are they, they're not going to go buy Godfather. They can't go buy all you. I don't know what all of you do for a living, but I guarantee most of you are not going to want to drop 30 grand on two pinball machines in a one month period when taxes are due.

[01:03:34] Does anyone else feel that way? You make that much? Really all of you $30,000 in one month. That's $60,000 before taxes. That's a $1 million salary a year. Maybe, maybe, maybe you guys are that rich. Do you remember the good old days when you could get three stern alleys for 21,000? Three stern alleys you could get for 21,000 that went up in value that had more in them.

[01:04:00] Remember when GodzillaLE was 10,5? Now the premium is that much money. Remember those days? Remember those good old days? So the thing is like, I'm really excited to see Godfather. I'm really excited to play it. But man, I don't know how, how they are going to come out and say a thousand at 10, at 15,000 a pop for.

[01:04:30] And now the problem with Jersey Jack now is the LEs are too much money. Jersey Jack LEs are like, they're like, they're like lead balloons. I mean, if you look at what's happening with Toy Story and Guns N' Roses LE, it's absolutely like how, how, how badly do you want to lose $4,000 is now the LE price.

[01:04:51] You can't sell a mass produced LE that you're going to make $5,000 of for $12,000. Do you need me to say this? Like, is this like, is there any, is there any target audience research that these companies are doing? Like, we can't keep doing this.

[01:05:11] If we continue, if we continue to make our customers lose so much value so quickly, they're going to stop buying.

[01:05:21] I don't know how you like, I mean, you can go get a Guns N' Roses LE now for eight grand, eight grand.

[01:05:41] And that's, and that's not the bottom. A year from now, Guns N' Roses LEs will be in the $7,000 range.

[01:05:53] And the game's never going to change. This is the other thing, gang. It'd be one thing if you had to buy it because there was some exclusive, like here's the other part that is so crazy.

[01:06:10] If you're going to try to charge premiums between LEs and pros and CEs and LEs, right, a large premium, then you need to start putting software specific exclusivity so that people buying the Foo Fighter LE have some sort of like justification for its uniqueness on a code.

[01:06:40] It's like the Area 51 multi-ball should not be available on the pro version of the game. It's like they absolutely won't give you anything experientially different.

[01:06:57] You've got to find a way to make the people who spend the most, when I get on an airplane and I'm first class, which is how I'm flying to Vegas because Canada likes to party, the experience is so different.

[01:07:15] We're all on the same plane. The LE guy and the premium guy are all playing the same exact game, but I get champagne the moment I'm on. I get to board first. I get a delicious meal. I get more legroom. I get this.

[01:07:31] Everything is an experiential difference. And yet if I spend $3,000 more on a pinball machine, I don't get anything of real value. It's a bunch of armor and stickers and plaques. You don't even get a topper usually, that's better.

[01:07:49] The physical ball lock and John, what did they do? The coma, the coma mode, the coma physical ball lock mode should have been a collector's edition only mode.

[01:08:06] Give those 500 people something that's unique.

[01:08:13] That's just how I feel about it. At these prices now, these companies need to start really rethinking what the value proposition is.

[01:08:34] It is tell tale that we are not seeing Jersey Jack pinball tell us our best shot at getting a CE is doing this. Trust me game. Don't lock in your money. I lost $2,000 on a toy story CE.

[01:08:52] $2,000. Let me give you my story. I gave my money to my distributor before seeing the game. I gave a $2,000 deposit. When I saw the game, I wanted my money back, but I was told I already gave the money.

[01:09:11] The funny part is my distributor. I love him. He's like, dude, the deposit was supposed to be 2,500. You need to give another 500. I'm like, I am absolutely not giving you another 500 bucks.

[01:09:22] I am. No, I don't want the game. Once I saw a toy story, I was like, I'm out. I lost $2,000. Okay. So look, I sold the game to someone for 14,000. So I lost $1,000.

[01:09:35] I lost $1,000. I lost $2,000 on Ultraman. I'm never doing this again. Ever day one, unless it's the ultimate dream theme of my life, like Top Gun or big trouble little China or fifth element or Transformers G1 or Akira.

[01:10:01] Why would I gamble my money when history has now shown us that every single person that has waited and saw what would be has saved themselves money? It's just that simple.

[01:10:22] Now the distributors want you to go back and look at Stranger Things, Ellie or God's. Yeah, I get it. But times have changed. Stranger Things, Ellie was $8,000, 8,500. It wasn't 13,000. And they didn't make a thousand of them.

[01:10:37] The fact that they increased the volume with everything is also the biggest joke ever. They took away your rarity. They took away your scarcity. They took away your exclusivity and then they charged you twice as much. Again, let's use the airplane analogy.

[01:10:54] Imagine if they doubled the size of the first class compartment, right? So no longer feels like exclusive because half the plane is first class and then they charged you 40% more money to sit there.

[01:11:11] Imagine if they did that. So there's a reason why, Ben, I'm glad I got you finally, buddy. There's a reason why they kind of took advantage of us.

[01:11:24] Look, guys, 30 seconds where the stars at. We got no stars. I've been spitting truth bombs for over an hour, over an hour, 320 stars.

[01:11:44] All right, I see how it goes. You're saving your money. You got to save your money. See, this is the problem. The high prices are now impacting Canada's pinball podcast. My livelihood is under attack. How dare you pinball companies attack my livelihood by raising the prices of these games so much that my fan base can't even find any money anymore to donate stars to the show?

[01:12:14] My livelihood is under attack. You know, it's not fair. Like what am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to buy Brenda like sushi dinner tonight if I don't get at least 10,000 stars? This is ridiculous. Your companies are attacking my livelihood.

[01:12:33] Everybody.

[01:12:40] All the livelihood babies are the best. Like, come on. People in expensive homes crying about livelihoods.

[01:12:47] Well, thank you for the $5 a month. I actually appreciate everybody's contributions. Look, the Canadian pinball podcast. I think the shows have been better than ever before.

[01:13:07] French, you know better than anybody, man. Ain't no money to be made in merchandise. Ain't no money to be made. Like, there ain't no money to be made in any of that stuff. Like, it's just, it doesn't work. It doesn't work.

[01:13:25] Ah, all right. Now let me ask you guys a question. For those, for those of you who I was thinking about uploading the audio, Bill Branis, you cheap son of a bitch. Did he just give 10 stars?

[01:13:46] Who's Dave? Yeah, French, it was the same way, man. When I did like merchandise, like I thought everybody would want it. They always everyone says they want merchandise and then you then you drop a merch line and you barely sell anything.

[01:14:05] And I was like, I'm not doing all of this work for this. Like, it wasn't worth it. Like the Viva La Raza t-shirts like sold better than anything I've ever done. And they were like the lowest effort shirts.

[01:14:20] Um,

[01:14:26] Paris is Friday night. That's the goal. Like you guys and your 10 stars. Like you've, you mofos.

[01:14:33] You mo- Have you guys been enjoying the podcast? Have you been enjoying hanging out here?

[01:14:39] Um, I have. And I've had a really good time. You know, I don't pay attention to anything else. I enjoy this. We've been getting great, great people following. We get about 1000 and a half people watching every Saturday morning spectacular.

[01:14:55] It's been an exciting time to cover the hobby. We've all got stuff to talk about. Um, you know, I really do appreciate everybody who subscribes to the show. It's, it's absolutely such a pleasure, you know, a couple of times a week. Thank you for the stars, Troy.

[01:15:12] It's a pleasure every, every week doing a few podcasts and hitting right when the news is happening. And I think Michael Huntsman, you,

[01:15:25] Michael Huntsman is like staring down right now at like half a million dollar pinball collection, giving me 10 cents.

[01:15:33] Yeah, I know what you guys do. I know how you roll. Thank you for the four bucks.

[01:15:42] Um, look, my advice to everybody is simply this, enjoy this. Enjoy the, the time we have together. Enjoy the time we have this new golden age of pinball. It's not going to last forever.

[01:16:01] I've been thinking about this a lot, like the, the, how fragile life is, how fragile like this market's going to become because there's too many companies, there's too many companies making games that are not going to be able to find continued buyers.

[01:16:22] Stern's going to clobber almost everybody. Um, but we're also going to reach a point now where people are just going to have to like, like enjoy what they have.

[01:16:34] I think there's going to be a good run over the next few years of pinball. I think we have a lot of themes out there that are still untact.

[01:16:44] Some of them might just be real difficult to get from a licensing standpoint. Um, I think the community, I think pin size become more and more relevant. And I actually like seeing that.

[01:16:54] I think between NAPS arcade, there's a lot of great content being made all across the pinball space. I think there's so many more positive fun and engaging places to go than pin side to just enjoy the hobby.

[01:17:06] And I mean it. And even when I go on pin side now, it's just like, it's every thread turns into a dumpster fire of the same, like 50 people complaining about everything or slapping each other back and forth.

[01:17:18] This is fun. There's a lot of good content happening all over pinball right now. Like Joel's like, he does his like talk show was like flipping out talk show thing. He does a lot of that's fun.

[01:17:32] I love it. The Joel and Travis and those guys are a lot of fun to listen to.

[01:17:37] And Jengas has got his stuff, you know, Arnold giving us reviews from Denmark and, you know, arguably like questionable his understanding of this great hobby. I'm just messing with you.

[01:17:47] But it's fun. Like this stuff is fun. It's a much needed distraction. You know, there's so much other stuff happening.

[01:17:53] And again, I continue to find so much enjoyment in the, the observation of what's happening in pinball enjoyment in playing games out on location.

[01:18:05] And, you know, I just don't think at these prices anymore, most of us are going to find that level of enjoyment if you run after every new thing that comes out.

[01:18:15] And that's good. Like this is actually the best time for a pinball consumer because we have all these options. Nothing's going to sell out at these prices and these volumes.

[01:18:26] And all of these companies are going to have to test to mark that they're going to have to test the market to find the right, you know, equation, if you will, to get sales.

[01:18:37] Like if you're American pinball and you're selling your game at the exact same price as a Foo Fighter Premium, you might not get sales.

[01:18:46] If you're a spooky pinball and your game comes out and, you know, all of a sudden it's like over 10 grand and you're making 1969 Scooby-Doo's, all of a sudden like things might start to slow down a little bit for you.

[01:19:02] And we see this like Scooby-Doo is not sold out. TNA is not sold out.

[01:19:07] I mean, Foo Fighter is sold out, you know? And again, it's like the games are just too expensive. Look at this, man. This is... Thank you, Mr. Franchi.

[01:19:17] Franchi, I'm going to send you... Franchi, PM me your address. I'm going to send you some merch. But look at this. Look at this. Amazing.

[01:19:26] Mr. Franchi, thank you so much. And look, you know, one of the reasons why... I mean, and Chris, Chris and I had a private conversation about Galactic Tank Force

[01:19:37] and I really, you know, I really... I'm glad we had that conversation. And I think, you know, he knows what's going on with me in my personal life and it's shittier than anything you could imagine.

[01:19:51] And even so, like, I wasn't going to use that as an excuse to behave badly because I just don't think, you know...

[01:19:58] I don't think something happening in your personal life gives you immunity to act like a jerk, you know? And some people do that. They're like, oh, this is happening to me, so I don't give an F about anybody else because of what's happening to me.

[01:20:14] That's not how I was raised. It's not my values. I mean, these people worked really hard on the game. You'll see it in a couple weeks.

[01:20:21] I think it looks really interesting and I think you're going to think that too. And I'm not just saying that because he kicked some stars. I think all this stuff is, like, interesting. I think Pimbo in general is just interesting.

[01:20:38] Well, I mean, look, some people's pins might be worth more than their homes. That's cool.

[01:20:42] You know, look, I think Scott Denisey's multi-morphic game. I haven't talked about it much. I don't think multi-morphic...

[01:20:56] What time is it? Let me see. What time is it? Hold on. Okay, we got a few more minutes.

[01:21:02] I don't think Jerry's going to be able to... I don't think he's going to be able to get success in this marketplace. There's too much real pinball happening to pull people over to his platform.

[01:21:16] And if Scott Denisey's game launches at Texas and still the majority of weird owls have not been made, nobody's going to want to wait a year. Okay?

[01:21:27] Tux, that's such a silly decision.

[01:21:37] I don't understand the Batman SLE hatred. I really don't get it. I think it's the nicest looking stern machine they've ever made.

[01:21:49] And they only made 80. I don't get the anger towards it. I really don't. If you've ever stood over one, you know what I'm talking about.

[01:22:02] Hate is going to hate. I don't really don't get it. You could sell the topper off the damn thing for five grand.

[01:22:14] I grew up watching Batman in the 80s. They played Batman on reruns in the 80s.

[01:22:23] Gang, for all of you people who watch Scooby-Doo, you were not watching Scooby-Doo illustrated in the 80s. You were watching Scooby-Doo illustrated in the 60s and 70s.

[01:22:32] Rerun, people. Reruns. So don't pretend like, oh, Scooby-Doo is from my childhood. Yeah, Batman 66 is from my childhood.

[01:22:42] It's also Batman. Batman, the most fun, campy version of Batman ever. And it's never going to go out of style. Never.

[01:22:54] And it was the last project Adam West ever worked on. So don't, don't. Just stick to your last. I get it. I get it.

[01:23:04] It's got one of the best mech stern has ever made.

[01:23:13] Well, the shark repellent is from the movie, but it is in the game. The shark repellent is in the game. It's in one of the illustrations.

[01:23:30] Look, everybody, here's the deal. Here's the deal.

[01:23:35] Yeah, I grew up. I was born in 76. I remember watching. Does nobody else who grew up in the 80s remember watching Batman 66 all the time on TV?

[01:23:52] I watched it all the time on TV.

[01:23:55] I don't understand. Who didn't watch Batman 66 when you were a kid in the 80s? They played it on reruns all the time.

[01:24:13] You know, it would be a great pinball machine from our childhood. They'll never make it because it cancel culture.

[01:24:19] But I was just thinking about this. Dukes of Hazards pinball. How has there not been a Dukes of Hazards pinball machine?

[01:24:28] Like the entire show is about jumping the general Lee. And like Dukes of Hazards would, again, they wouldn't make it. It's so canceled now for obvious reasons.

[01:24:42] But Dukes of Hazards would sell better than most of the themes we've been getting.

[01:24:53] I grew up watching like Dukes of Hazards, Batman 66, Thundercats, He-Man, G.I. Joe, Transformers. I grew up watching Inspector Gadget.

[01:25:07] I feel like Inspector Gadget would be an interesting pinball machine because of all the gadgets. So like lots of stuff not tapped into.

[01:25:18] I grew up watching all the Arnold movies. I grew up watching...

[01:25:25] You know what's interesting is when we were kids, like all the Saturday morning cartoon stuff. A-Team, absolutely.

[01:25:32] I watched the A-Team religiously. Voltron, Thundercats, Airwolf.

[01:25:42] Night Rider. How do we not have a Night Rider pinball machine? I don't understand.

[01:25:49] I don't understand. Like you could have a Night Rider pinball machine and the freaking apron should have the light that goes back and forth.

[01:25:58] And you should have the Night Rider car on the cabinet and LED light strip, the light.

[01:26:05] No, let's not do that. Let's not do that. Let's make Black Knight.

[01:26:12] I think even as we talk right here, we're absolutely coming up with some great, great, great stuff.

[01:26:28] Again, for the target audience that buys pinball, all of this stuff is relevant.

[01:26:33] Everybody look, have a great, great weekend. I will talk to you soon. Lots of content coming this week. Lots of content.

[01:26:46] I can't wait to see that Jersey Jack release on Tuesday. I will most likely do a Facebook Live so we can hang out together when they release it.

[01:26:56] I will also do more podcasts. Everybody, thank you for the stars. We got the 6600. Not too bad. Not the best ever.

[01:27:05] You know, I love that 10,000 mark. Maybe we do another minute. Maybe Pete Rosen swoops in with his 5,000.

[01:27:10] Sometimes I cut the show too early and before Pete can throw it. But no pressure, Pete or Billy.

[01:27:16] You guys are the best. You guys are the best.

[01:27:46] I guarantee you get a decent following. Make more money than the t-shirts.

[01:27:56] Alright everybody, there it is. Did he just do it again? Did he do it again, Pete? I knew it. I knew it. We got it. We got it. Oh, Pete.

[01:28:07] I love you, Pete. He does it. Does it every time. Swoops in. Just owns it. Have a rad weekend everybody. This is a good show.

[01:28:25] I feel like we had a good one here today. Jeng is, I want your review of my show on my desk in the next hour. Okay?

[01:28:30] Killian's got to go do his nap right now. I'm going to go to work this weekend. I got a lot of work. Have a great weekend.

[01:28:41] We'll talk to you soon. Go buy some of Albert's coffee, everybody. Pinball nerd coffee. Google it later.
