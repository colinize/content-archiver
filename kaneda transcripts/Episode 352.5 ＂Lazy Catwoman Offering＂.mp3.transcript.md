[00:00] Well, we finally got a rumor right.

[00:10] Finally, after all these months of rumors that have not panned out, we finally predicted

[00:16] that Stern would reveal, albeit a day earlier than we thought, the Catwoman edition of Batman

[00:23] 66 and a premium color version of the monsters.

[00:28] And I want to do a little mini episode about my thoughts about this because that's what

[00:32] Canadian Ball podcast does.

[00:34] We jump right into it.

[00:36] So here's my take on this whole thing.

[00:37] And I see people either saying they don't care or they're upset about this.

[00:42] I want to give you my opinion about this.

[00:44] I want to tell you why I think Stern does this stuff.

[00:47] I want to tell you what I think this means about who they consider the pinball buyers

[00:51] to be.

[00:52] And I want to talk about who the ultimate loser is in all of this.

[00:57] Okay.

[00:58] So let's start with what I think about these packages.

[01:00] So first and foremost, this was planned for a long time.

[01:04] All right.

[01:05] The rumors of this happening are not brand new.

[01:08] You knew you had to have known that Stern was not going to only reveal or release the

[01:15] monsters in black and white premium.

[01:17] And that was it.

[01:19] So here's why we know this, the original plan of the monsters.

[01:23] And we know this because the original artwork leaks of the monsters had the Ellie version

[01:29] being in black and white.

[01:31] So somewhere along the line, Stern made the decision to put what was the sort of really

[01:38] like out there version of the game, which is a black and white play field version of

[01:42] the monsters and cabinet to put that as the premium, even though it should have been

[01:47] the Ellie and then make the Ellie in color and then and then release it to the world.

[01:53] Okay.

[01:54] Now, I think Stern always from the very beginning, if they really wanted to make the

[01:59] monsters limited edition a very special thing to own, I think they should have made the

[02:05] Ellie the black and white and they should have made only 500 of them.

[02:10] And that would have been awesome, right?

[02:13] The only black and white Ellie version of a Stern pinball machine is the monsters and

[02:18] it makes total sense because the show isn't black and white, but they didn't do that.

[02:22] They didn't do that.

[02:23] They once again started juggling the options list and put what I think was the appropriate

[02:31] Ellie package as a premium, right?

[02:33] We've seen them put even like the nicer art packages on the pros.

[02:36] Okay.

[02:37] We did that and then they went and they put the color on the Ellie only.

[02:44] Now what do you have?

[02:45] Now what do you have?

[02:46] You have the premium can be had in color now, not just the play field, but the entire

[02:52] cabinet is now in color.

[02:55] So now what really separates a Ellie from a premium, right?

[03:00] So if you're an Ellie owner, you lost today.

[03:05] The major thing that was different in your game is you had the full featured game in

[03:09] color and no one else did, but you.

[03:12] Okay.

[03:13] So you no longer have that sort of exclusivity.

[03:16] So the only thing you now have is cabinet that's different and some different armor and

[03:21] a plaque, nothing much more.

[03:23] Okay.

[03:24] Now here's what sucks.

[03:26] Here's what totally sucks because if you're an Ellie buyer, I think it sucks that you

[03:30] just lost that major differentiator and that might have been one of the main reasons why

[03:34] you bought the Ellie.

[03:36] You might have also bought the Ellie because you didn't want the black and white version.

[03:41] You might have liked the color full featured play field more because you can see more of

[03:46] the detail and that might have been more appealing to you.

[03:49] So you might have paid more money to Stern Pimball and gone from spending $7,500 and then

[03:54] paid $9,000 because you bought the full colored version of the game.

[04:01] Okay.

[04:02] So what is that guy feel now that he could have got his full color version, right?

[04:06] He might not care so much about Ellie plaques and different armors.

[04:10] He could have got his full colored version of the game for much cheaper, but he didn't

[04:14] know that because he just took Stern at its word that these were the way this is the way

[04:21] the game would be available to buy.

[04:23] And now they completely like removed those, you know, those standards of the game.

[04:28] Now it's like all bets are off on what versions they'll be in the future, right?

[04:32] And they've done this before.

[04:33] So don't be surprised at Stern doesn't do this before.

[04:36] They've done this before to us, but they're doing it again.

[04:38] Okay.

[04:39] So that Ellie buyer might be pissed off that he could have saved money.

[04:42] So let's think about if you're the black and white premium guy, all right?

[04:46] What about the guy who buys the premium in black and white, but really wanted the color,

[04:52] but didn't want the Ellie didn't want to spend more money.

[04:55] So he bought the only version he could get, which was in black and white.

[05:00] So how does that guy feel now that he can now have it in color?

[05:03] And now he's got a $7,000 toy that there's another version of it that he would rather

[05:10] have.

[05:11] So that's what I'm just saying is it just creates this sort of bad feeling to your customer

[05:18] base.

[05:20] Who feels good right now other than Stern, who is now going to hopefully sell more of

[05:27] the game because they have more options available.

[05:30] Now I'm not sure if you can still get the premium in black and white or in color, which

[05:35] might make the black and white premium of the monsters like its own sort of limited

[05:40] addition game, but the games are not numbered.

[05:42] So we'll never know.

[05:44] You'll never know like how many of them are out there.

[05:46] So do I like this move on Stern's part?

[05:50] No, I don't.

[05:51] I don't really think it's a cool move to do this stuff.

[05:54] It just you know what people have said this not enough time has passed.

[05:57] The game just came out what like four or five months ago.

[06:01] I think it was revealed in what January, January, February, March, April, May, right?

[06:06] So five, six months ago, we saw the game for the first time and we're already getting

[06:11] what feels like a vault edition of the game and a new version of the game.

[06:16] And I just think it's too soon to burn the owners of the monsters.

[06:20] I'll talk a little bit about why I think they're doing it.

[06:22] You know what I'll talk about it right now.

[06:24] I think they're doing this because I don't think game sales are great.

[06:27] I don't think what some people are saying is true that the monsters are selling so well.

[06:32] And this is just a prime example of it's doing so well that they can make even more.

[06:37] It's like no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't fool yourselves.

[06:40] Don't fool yourselves.

[06:42] This is a move to spark more sales.

[06:45] This is not a move because the game is flying off the shelf.

[06:49] All right.

[06:50] I bet a lot of distributors told Stern, hey, people don't want the game because they don't

[06:55] want it in black and white, but they don't want to buy the Ellie and vice versa, right?

[07:00] And I think that the move to add the color play field to the premium was a move to generate

[07:06] more sales.

[07:07] And as cool as the black and white looks, it's not for everybody.

[07:12] It's polarizing.

[07:13] It's way different.

[07:14] It's way out there.

[07:15] And that's why it should have been the Ellie package all along.

[07:18] I think it was a piss poor marketing move by Stern to make the black and white a premium.

[07:23] And that's why we have what we have now, which is now this feeling.

[07:28] And I don't know about how you guys feel.

[07:30] I just feel like now it just feels like nothing's really special.

[07:33] Like this whole Stern, like limited model and this and that.

[07:36] It just feels like, you know, they're kind of treading on Jersey Jack territory where

[07:40] it's like, well, we'll just keep making different variations until something sticks.

[07:45] Well, that sucks for all the buyers out there that are spending a lot of money.

[07:50] And all they want, all they want is this Stern.

[07:53] This is all they ask of you as a company and all pinball companies.

[07:56] I just want to know when a game is revealed, what my options are.

[08:02] And I don't want you to like change the variations on the game within the first six months of

[08:08] the game being available because it sucks because I'm spending a lot of money here.

[08:13] And I want to know exactly what I can get.

[08:16] And I don't want you to like flip the script on me after you've taken my money.

[08:20] And then you no longer care about me because you already have my dollars.

[08:23] Okay, I know it's business.

[08:24] I know they're not like promising.

[08:26] They won't do this stuff.

[08:27] But there is a level of like what people expect when they invest so much in these unnecessary

[08:34] toys.

[08:35] All right.

[08:36] So that's monsters.

[08:37] Now let's go on to Batman Catwoman edition.

[08:40] This feels like the most half baked version of a new variation I've ever seen before.

[08:48] So what happened here?

[08:50] They couldn't commission.

[08:52] If this is the Catwoman signature edition, all right.

[08:57] Where is the Catwoman on the cabinet?

[09:00] It's Batman and Robin.

[09:02] The only Catwoman on the cabinet is on the back box.

[09:06] And then she's poking out a little bit by the front right leg.

[09:10] But this is not what people want it.

[09:11] When you tell someone it's going to be a Catwoman edition, everybody was thinking it would be

[09:18] like the ACDC Lucy version of Batman.

[09:22] How do you not have Catwoman in her sensual Catcraw coming on the side of the back box?

[09:30] I mean, for Freak's sake Lucy, ACDC Lucy, she's in the Catcrawl position on the ACDC cabinet.

[09:40] How did they not get Fransche to draw that version for the game?

[09:44] This doesn't feel like the Catwoman signature edition.

[09:47] It feels really like a half baked version of the game.

[09:53] And I know that the first 100 games that are produced, they come with an autographed

[09:59] card by Julie Neumar.

[10:02] But this just is, I don't know about you.

[10:05] I just felt like this just felt kind of lame.

[10:08] This wasn't what people wanted.

[10:10] It should have been much more than this.

[10:13] And I think the game deserves more than this.

[10:15] I think it's a great game.

[10:16] But this is just a half-assed effort at a new version of the game.

[10:22] But again, who does this appeal to?

[10:25] Because if you just bought a Batman premium a couple weeks ago, you're now pissed off

[10:31] because you might have wanted the Catwoman signature edition.

[10:36] And again, I just think that these moves, they don't really create a lot of good will

[10:42] with the buyer base.

[10:44] And you just kind of want to know how many games they're going to be.

[10:47] And look, but this is Pimball, right?

[10:50] This is all it's been for the last few years.

[10:52] I mean, nobody has introduced more variations of a game than Jersey Jack.

[10:56] I mean, he screwed over more people who thought they were getting like the limited version

[11:00] of the game.

[11:01] Stern has done this before.

[11:02] Remember when they said they weren't going to make any walking dead premiums?

[11:05] And then they did, right?

[11:08] They do this.

[11:10] These decisions are purely financial.

[11:12] But they're again, I think they're done to make more money.

[11:14] I don't think they're doing this because the games are flying off the shelf.

[11:18] All right?

[11:19] All right.

[11:20] It's loser that the loser here, right in Pimball right now.

[11:25] The loser in Pimball right now, it's not Stern.

[11:28] It's not you guys, the customers.

[11:30] The big losers right now are the other manufacturers right now in May of 2019.

[11:37] I would love to have a game on the line that really, really, really was amazing because

[11:43] there is such a low right now happening in Pimball and in sense of like, Stern has kind

[11:48] of had like three to four like mediocre sellers in a row.

[11:53] I mean, think about it.

[11:55] Deadpool, Beatles, Monsters and Black Knight.

[12:00] I mean, those are not like juggernaut hits for the company.

[12:04] No way.

[12:05] I think Stern is in one of its most vulnerable positions right now in the entire industry.

[12:12] And guess what?

[12:13] It doesn't matter because if you look at the competition right now, nobody's got anything.

[12:18] He's got anything to strike while the castle gates are down.

[12:22] Think about it.

[12:23] What?

[12:24] October Fest?

[12:25] It's just barely coming out.

[12:26] October Fest in May.

[12:27] Just say that 10 times.

[12:28] All right.

[12:29] What else is out right now?

[12:30] Yellow brick road.

[12:31] Jack is selling us like a game that's seven years old for $11,500 and it's removing mechanisms.

[12:37] Nobody's running towards that game.

[12:40] You got to be out of your mind to run towards that game right now when you can get a used

[12:44] version of Ruby Red and Emerald City edition for like $7,000 right now.

[12:50] You can spend $4,500 more on a game with less.

[12:53] Come on.

[12:55] What else is out there?

[12:56] Monster Bash.

[12:57] Ellie, they're already kind of sold out.

[12:58] I don't know.

[12:59] They're not even like shipping them.

[13:01] Nobody.

[13:02] Nobody has a new game out right now.

[13:05] This would have been perfect time to have Willy Wonka shipping.

[13:10] Great time to have a better theme than October Fest shipping from American Pimbal.

[13:15] Perfect time for, you know, who else?

[13:20] House Cooper's already all sold.

[13:21] Doesn't matter.

[13:22] But you know what I'm saying?

[13:23] The big loser right now.

[13:25] As Stern can do these silly variations and it doesn't matter because no one else has

[13:30] anything really available.

[13:32] This would have been the ultimate time for Deeproot to have your games on the line.

[13:36] Remember Deeproot?

[13:37] You're going to have your games by June 30th.

[13:39] Man, this would have been perfect window for them to get the games out the door.

[13:44] I don't think I've seen Stern have so many.

[13:48] What I believe to be like B-level titles in a row in terms of sales.

[13:52] I don't think these things are juggernauts.

[13:54] I could be wrong.

[13:55] I don't know, but I think they're vulnerable.

[13:58] But nobody is prepared to take advantage of Stern in this compromised time.

[14:05] That's why I'm here to tell you.

[14:08] Even now, it's still just losing at this game.

[14:11] They're just losing at taking advantage of the opportunity that is there for them this

[14:16] spring summer.

[14:17] Right?

[14:18] Why can't we get just another company or two that can just give you games you want and

[14:27] not make it so difficult?

[14:28] Right?

[14:29] Not make it so hard.

[14:30] Take advantage of this.

[14:32] So then Stern can't pull crap like this.

[14:34] The only reason Stern can pull crap like this is because they have no real competition.

[14:38] They can do this.

[14:41] They can crap on their own customers in these weird ways.

[14:45] Because they know that you'll take it.

[14:47] They know that you'll line up and buy it.

[14:49] They know that they'll be able to do it to you time and time again because nobody else

[14:54] has anything out on the line that you really want.

[14:57] That's why they do it.

[14:59] Oh my God.

[15:00] How is this the Catwoman signature edition?

[15:03] She's not even on the side of the game.

[15:06] Who making the marketing department looks at this and says, why can't we just put her

[15:10] on the side?

[15:11] Well, you know why they didn't do it.

[15:13] You want to know the real answer why?

[15:15] Because they have all these damn premium cabinets and cabinet artwork.

[15:20] They've already probably printed them all.

[15:23] They don't want to do the work.

[15:26] That is a lazy ass catwoman signature edition.

[15:30] This is once again Stern just putting the parts that they have out on the line and

[15:36] just getting it out the door.

[15:38] You know, sales might have dried up and now we're just going to like, well, we've got

[15:41] all these cabinets and these cabinet decals.

[15:44] Let's just throw something on the translate because that's easy to print and it's easy

[15:48] to print just new back box like images of catwoman and that's it.

[15:52] And these autograph cards that everyone keeps thinking are like, oh my God, I got an autograph

[15:57] card from Julie Neumar.

[15:58] Yeah, hey, Boseos, you can go get one for like 20 bucks.

[16:02] And you act like it's so goddamn valuable that you have a $20 autograph card from Julie

[16:07] Neumar.

[16:08] Like, what?

[16:10] The things you think are valuable are not.

[16:13] How about they actually make it look like a catwoman signature series?

[16:16] How about that?

[16:17] How about that?

[16:18] I challenge you Stern to actually give this catwoman on the side of the cabinet.

[16:22] I challenge you to actually like not like give the premium people everything the elite

[16:28] people get and keep flip flopping these things.

[16:30] They don't care.

[16:31] Why would they even listen to me?

[16:34] Because no one else is even in the game.

[16:35] They're not in the game.

[16:37] I want someone to get in the game.

[16:39] All right.

[16:40] Later, can you just pinball podcasts out?

[16:42] Not even outro music.

[16:43] Just, just whatever.

[16:44] Go about your nights.

[16:45] I love you guys.

[16:46] Bye.
