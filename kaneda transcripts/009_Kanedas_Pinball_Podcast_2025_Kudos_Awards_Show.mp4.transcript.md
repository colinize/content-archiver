[00:06] Welcome, welcome, welcome.

[00:07] I'm so excited to do this.

[00:08] Okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.

[00:13] The best of pinball.

[00:15] All right, we got 10 people already.

[00:18] Let's go, hold on, hold on.

[00:20] How's the volume?

[00:21] How's it going?

[00:23] We're gonna get going in about five minutes.

[00:26] So take your time, come in, join the lobby.

[00:31] We're gonna do, I wanna do this all on YouTube.

[00:34] I don't wanna do this.

[00:37] Let's see, I don't wanna do this on a,

[00:43] here we go, we're gonna copy this.

[00:44] Come, how's everybody going?

[00:48] This is like, we're gonna,

[00:52] you wanna give you that?

[01:03] It's all for people.

[01:05] All right.

[01:08] All right, so we're doing this on YouTube.

[01:10] I'm not doing this on Facebook,

[01:12] so I just put a link on Facebook.

[01:14] If you wanna watch, let's do this.

[01:17] How's everybody doing?

[01:18] Hello everybody.

[01:19] I need a drink.

[01:20] So we said we're gonna do this,

[01:22] we're gonna do it right, and it's gonna be awesome.

[01:26] I've worked all day on this show,

[01:28] so it's gonna be a conversation.

[01:33] There's a lot of, I struggled with a lot.

[01:38] I struggled with a lot of these selections

[01:40] because it's not, this was probably the best year

[01:46] in terms of pinball award shows.

[01:48] Guys, on Facebook, join YouTube, let's do this.

[01:52] Okay, I'll be right back, okay, because,

[01:55] Brenna gave me a glass of water, but I'm like,

[01:58] mm, I need something a little stronger.

[02:04] Can you get me, should I do Manhattan or Red Wine

[02:10] to start the show?

[02:11] Start with a wine.

[02:12] Start with a wine?

[02:13] I think you should start with the Manhattan.

[02:17] What are we thinking?

[02:18] What are we thinking?

[02:19] Hello, it's me.

[02:20] The show is gonna be, I would say guys,

[02:23] we're gonna be about a little bit over an hour.

[02:26] Manhattan and is.

[02:28] I'm gonna ask the question for people all day doing it.

[02:30] They're like, that's the best.

[02:31] That's the best.

[02:34] All right, how's everybody doing?

[02:35] Nessie, now I feel I can hear myself now.

[02:38] This is gonna be good.

[02:39] All right, so we're gonna share a screen real quick.

[02:42] Do, do, do.

[02:46] All right, here we go.

[02:47] This is gonna be like, it's gonna be like one of these shows.

[02:53] I'm blocking, hold on a second, real quick.

[02:55] Let's just put it up.

[02:57] Oh, let's just do this.

[02:59] It's like probably the only text that I block.

[03:04] Oh man, come on, let's do this.

[03:06] Here we go.

[03:09] I never, the only thing I didn't test it was with this one.

[03:12] Okay, here we go.

[03:18] All right, but before we get started though, let's.

[03:25] We got them in hand.

[03:27] How's everybody doing?

[03:28] How's everybody doing?

[03:31] Wow, we got, we got, we got a big poor Manhattan right now

[03:33] from Brenda.

[03:34] Thank you Brenda.

[03:35] Yeah, I mean, it's a big poor.

[03:36] I'm not gonna be there.

[03:38] It's a big poor.

[03:39] How are you guys doing?

[03:40] Who we got in the house tonight?

[03:44] Keep all the lights on.

[03:46] Let's do this.

[03:48] We're gonna let people come through the door in a little bit.

[03:50] Let's just connect with the kids for a little bit.

[03:52] We got 61 people here.

[03:54] We'll get some more.

[03:55] We're gonna obviously let the people watch at their convenience.

[04:01] But how's everybody doing, by the way?

[04:05] I'm reading the messages.

[04:07] Guys, light up the chat.

[04:09] Did anyone has anyone chatted after Brandon?

[04:12] Hit me, hit up the chat.

[04:14] Let's make sure we're going good here.

[04:16] Let the show begin.

[04:18] Who's ready for some awards?

[04:19] I'm ready.

[04:20] Who actually voted on these?

[04:22] I voted on these Bill Brandes.

[04:25] As I said, this is one man's opinion.

[04:27] This is one man's opinion who has been surveying, if you will,

[04:32] this entire pinball space for over 13 years.

[04:37] So I think there's like, I think there's something

[04:39] to be said for that.

[04:41] Every week, I studied this hobby.

[04:44] I watch what's going on.

[04:45] I see these releases.

[04:48] I play these games and, you know, no, this is not the Twippies.

[04:52] The Twippies, by the way, I think voting starts on Monday,

[04:56] 8-8, nobody cares.

[04:57] All right, the Twippies are dead.

[04:59] They're dead.

[05:01] They're dead.

[05:02] There's like four categories, by the way.

[05:04] Star Wars is the best game.

[05:07] Yeah, I don't know.

[05:07] I don't think it's gonna win.

[05:08] I don't think it's gonna win.

[05:09] Hey, Brenda.

[05:11] Babe.

[05:13] Yeah, you know what my classes are at?

[05:16] So I can see.

[05:17] All right, guys, I got a Manhattan inside here.

[05:25] We're gonna have some fun tonight.

[05:26] Happy New Year's, I want to say.

[05:28] I hope each and every one of you had a great New Year's

[05:31] with your family.

[05:32] It's been a, I don't know, it's been like a weird year.

[05:36] I don't know how you guys feel, but I feel like the outside world

[05:40] is always negative.

[05:42] I feel like the outside world is always bringing me down.

[05:46] And I love the Pimbal world, because it's a little bit

[05:49] of a quantum of solace in this universe

[05:52] for each and every one of us to sort of find each other

[05:55] in a common space that makes us all just feel good.

[05:59] We get to look at these games, and I will say,

[06:02] we're gonna see it when we see all the games this year.

[06:05] The sheer amount of Pimbal games available in one year

[06:11] is hard to deny that we are not in a new golden era of Pimbal.

[06:17] We are.

[06:18] I mean, the prices are high, but man, there's more companies

[06:22] trying to succeed in this hobby than ever before.

[06:27] So we should all feel really good about that.

[06:29] So we're gonna get going here in just a few seconds.

[06:33] Bren is looking for my eyeglasses.

[06:36] I've spent, you know, this is not just gonna be me talking.

[06:40] I'm gonna have a slideshow, as you can see,

[06:42] how many Merlins this year?

[06:47] What do you mean Merlins?

[06:56] Oh, the man hadn't strong.

[06:59] Should we get going?

[07:00] Let's do this.

[07:01] All right.

[07:02] All right, so I think I have to, you know,

[07:05] as we think about the 2025 year in Pimbal,

[07:11] you know, the years I've been covering this hobby,

[07:16] I've seen award shows where certain games just sweat.

[07:20] Godzilla was one of those years, one everything.

[07:24] I was there, guns and roses, I think one everything.

[07:29] What are the, you know, it's crazy.

[07:30] I think dialed in one game of the year when dialed in came out.

[07:34] And I really do think this hobby is in an interesting crossroads

[07:38] right now where there's a lot of new people coming into the hobby.

[07:41] There's a lot of people who have been in this hobby

[07:44] for a really long time who have seen,

[07:49] we've seen like the prices go from a sternle being 6,500 to 13,000.

[07:58] And, you know, and this is why, like, I think Pimbal now

[08:01] is in a really interesting point.

[08:03] So we're gonna go over the best of Pimbal in 2025.

[08:07] Now, I think this year has a few standout hits,

[08:11] we're gonna see that, but I think where this industry is going

[08:15] is gonna be very exciting.

[08:17] And there's a lot of really amazing excitement happening in Pimbal.

[08:21] I'm not worried about the view count guys.

[08:23] I'll get more people tomorrow.

[08:24] I mean, it's Friday, it's the holidays.

[08:26] Like I let people know today about this show.

[08:28] This show will go up at a later date.

[08:30] People can watch it at their convenience.

[08:32] I'm really not that worried about how many people are watching live right now.

[08:35] They might be in the guest bedroom.

[08:46] My glass is Pimbal.

[08:47] I can't, you know, just trying to read better.

[08:49] Okay.

[08:50] Do you use total number of votes or total number of one votes?

[08:57] All right, let's do this.

[08:58] Are we ready?

[08:59] All right.

[09:00] So let me ask you guys a question.

[09:01] When I go like next, I just like,

[09:05] you know, as I start this show, I just want to give a few thanks because,

[09:09] you know, as I think about this hobby and what makes covering this hobby so

[09:16] interesting, and I've said this for many, many years,

[09:20] foremost, I think we need to thank the manufacturers of Pimbal.

[09:24] We are now in 2025 at a place where there are over,

[09:31] I think there's somewhere between 13 and 15 Pimbal manufacturers making Pimbal

[09:37] games.

[09:38] And we do spend an inordinate amount of time in this hobby,

[09:42] singling out certain individuals like designers and artists seem to get

[09:48] most of the credit, then the coders.

[09:51] But the truth is at each of these companies are so many men and women who get

[09:57] absolutely no credit who walk into a Pimbal company every day and actually

[10:03] put these games together.

[10:05] So I do want to give a shout out to all of the Pimbal companies out there,

[10:10] all the thankless individuals inside those companies who are making these

[10:15] games each and every single day without you, we would not have this hobby where it

[10:21] is today.

[10:22] And I think that is something that we should all, you know,

[10:26] whether we like a company or not, a lot of those individuals deserve all of,

[10:31] you know, all of the applause, if you will, for making these games and putting them in

[10:36] boxes and getting them to each and every one of us.

[10:40] Yeah, the line workers, right?

[10:41] It's like, how many of you know, if I were to ask you guys right now,

[10:45] how many of you guys know a single line worker at a friend of their not in there?

[10:51] Hold on, one second guys, I'm going to, I'm going to go find my glasses real quick.

[10:55] Give me, give me a one second break and

[10:59] friend, like they can't be in that many places.

[11:03] Hold on, I'll be right back.

[11:06] Hold on. Hold on.

[12:25] All right.

[12:40] All right.

[12:40] We're going to do it.

[12:42] Sands my ability to read anything.

[12:46] All right.

[12:46] We're back.

[12:47] I'm going to get in.

[12:49] Find them.

[12:50] We'll see if Brenda finds this.

[12:51] Okay.

[12:51] So definitely want to thank the manufacturer.

[12:55] So second in our list of thank yous are the operators of the Pimbal world.

[13:02] And you know, when you think about bringing Pimbal to the masses and all the,

[13:07] the operators out there, it's a really amazing thing that in 2025,

[13:13] we still have people operating location.

[13:15] These are individuals that are really gaining such valuable information.

[13:22] On, on, on, like issues with the games on what's popular.

[13:26] You know, we hear it all the time, like certain games might just be like great

[13:30] location games and not perfect for home ownership.

[13:34] You know, when we hear Pokemon, everyone's like, it's going to be an operator's dream.

[13:38] And that's great.

[13:39] It brings new people into Pimbal.

[13:41] I love the fact that we can go out there and play Pimbal out on location

[13:45] without having to spend so much money and buying new inbox games.

[13:49] So for all the operators out there, thank you so much for operating Pimbal.

[13:54] It's not the most financially lucrative thing you could operate.

[14:00] You could just have a, you know, some redemption machines, but the fact that

[14:03] there are operators all throughout America and you know who you are.

[14:07] Thank you so much.

[14:08] Thank you.

[14:09] Of course, to our dealers and distro friends out there.

[14:15] You know who they are.

[14:16] There's just for some reason we're still working with dealers and distros and

[14:21] maybe one day, canada will be one.

[14:23] But in the end, we all have a lot of great relationships with dealers and

[14:27] distros who help us not only get the games we're looking for, but also the

[14:32] customer service that a lot of people need when, you know, whenever you have

[14:36] an issue with your games guys, you're the bad.

[14:40] And then all the content creators out there of the world, you know who they are.

[14:43] There's so many to mention.

[14:44] And when I started in this hobby, there were maybe just a handful of content

[14:47] creators.

[14:49] I grew up with Nate shivers.

[14:51] I grew up with spooky had a Pimbal podcast.

[14:56] There was like, there was like barely any.

[14:59] Now there's like 40 Pimbal podcasters.

[15:03] There's so many YouTubers out there.

[15:06] And for those of you who make Pimbal content, you guys know that it is not

[15:11] the easiest to entertain an audience every single week when a new game only

[15:17] comes out every few months.

[15:19] So I just want to thank you guys, unless you actually pick up a mic and

[15:23] try to keep people entertained, it's not as easy as I both think.

[15:28] First, we have to thank the private equity investors without them.

[15:32] There would be no stern Pimbal.

[15:35] And without them, we would have more impressive mechanisms in

[15:40] Pimbal machine.

[15:42] You know, I put Pinside up here and I mean this because even though I'm banned

[15:49] from Pinside, I still do consider Pinside to be the sort of epicenter

[15:57] and the magnetic place where so many people who discover this hobby and

[16:03] want to go a layer deeper and find community, they go to Pinside.

[16:09] And without Pinside, I would not be where I am today.

[16:14] Not not just because they banned me and it made me do a podcast, but without

[16:18] Pinside, you really wouldn't find the community the way you would if Pinside

[16:24] wasn't there.

[16:25] So I want to thank Robin and everybody there.

[16:28] And for all the people there that that hyperpost all the time, thank you because

[16:34] you know, I don't necessarily understand if it's a rich use of time or not,

[16:38] but you are keeping this community alive every single day.

[16:42] And I think that's really important and I think it's easy.

[16:45] I mean, just imagine a Pimbal community without Pinside, it doesn't

[16:50] be exciting.

[16:51] And you know, and also, you know, thank all of you, the community.

[16:55] You guys are the best.

[16:56] You guys absolutely are what is the most valuable part of this hobby.

[17:02] I always say this tonight, we're going to celebrate the games of Pimbal,

[17:06] but you don't need to spend a lot of money on a Pimbal machine to really

[17:11] find what's valuable about Pimbal, what's really valuable about this hobby are

[17:16] the people that you meet, the friends you make and the community that comes

[17:21] together.

[17:21] And that's really what makes this hobby so special for me.

[17:26] I really do feel if, you know, if I were to lose the community I made in this

[17:31] hobby, I would lose half of my, you know, real kind of family through life

[17:36] because this is the family we choose.

[17:38] And I think it's kind of amazing.

[17:41] And selfishly, thank you, the Canadian club members because seriously,

[17:46] it's still amazing that every month we have the most subscribers to

[17:50] Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[17:52] And, you know, for about like five years now, we've had such a loyal following

[17:57] and it's such a great community.

[17:59] And if you are curious and if you're just watching this now,

[18:03] Canadian Pimbal podcast on Patreon, we do about three shows a week.

[18:07] We've got the Facebook live every Saturday morning, but I really do appreciate

[18:11] every single person who views to the show.

[18:14] And then last, and certainly not least is the patient partners and the family

[18:21] members of each and every person here because if you're married to someone who's

[18:27] in the Pimbal, it requires patience.

[18:30] And I will say this, my family, the amount of hours that it takes to create

[18:36] content, to study the hobby, to make shows, it really is a picture of my

[18:43] beautiful family before we get to the actual games tonight.

[18:47] I love this photo.

[18:49] This was Halloween.

[18:50] We were K-pop demon hunters.

[18:52] And, and I love that fact that there is the shade happening over Brenda's shoulder

[19:00] from Brenda, who was the character in K-pop that you are in demon hunter?

[19:06] Does anyone know?

[19:08] What's it?

[19:08] What's the K-pop demon hunter character you are in Halloween?

[19:11] Rui?

[19:13] Runi.

[19:15] Runi.

[19:16] Okay.

[19:17] Runi.

[19:17] All right.

[19:18] Cool.

[19:19] Thank you for the 10 bucks Pimbal vibes.

[19:21] Let's do this.

[19:22] All right.

[19:23] So, spin you a P-ball.

[19:25] All right.

[19:25] So here we go.

[19:26] Are you guys ready?

[19:27] Rumi.

[19:28] Yeah.

[19:28] Thank you, dead flip.

[19:29] Yeah.

[19:29] Jack Danger knows what I'm talking about here.

[19:31] All right.

[19:32] So let's get to it.

[19:34] So those were my thank yous.

[19:36] Now we're going to the nominees of the 2025 Canadian Kudos Pimbal Awards.

[19:43] And as I was saying, there's a lot of nominees.

[19:46] Now, a lot of manufacturers more than we ever would have expected.

[19:51] We've got, like, they're not all going to be like this.

[19:54] But first, we've got home pin making the blues brothers.

[20:00] Okay.

[20:01] Did anyone order this game?

[20:02] I haven't even seen a single unboxing.

[20:05] I can tell you right now, if you're a home pin fan,

[20:10] they're not going to win awards tonight.

[20:13] Unfortunately, the industry is just so far beyond this title.

[20:19] But it's it's out.

[20:22] And then we have from France, I believe, Space Hunt,

[20:26] Hamball.

[20:28] Did anyone order a space one?

[20:30] You know, when it was funny when I was going through this tonight,

[20:33] Killian saw all the games and he goes, I want the pink game.

[20:36] I want space hun.

[20:37] So if only he had the money.

[20:40] So we've got space,

[20:41] some of Merlin's arcade from Turner, pinball.

[20:45] We've got from the pinball brothers, sort of the compliment to alien, if you will,

[20:52] Sands, Arnold Swartz and Ager.

[20:56] We've got portal pinball from multi morphic.

[21:01] Portal is shipping this year.

[21:04] It's definitely one of the most intricate games that multi morphic is brought to the market.

[21:11] Is anyone taking this seriously at all?

[21:12] Wow, Kraken, nurses, okay, cool.

[21:14] Here you go, bro.

[21:16] Should we, I love what people are like, are like trolling, like we're just,

[21:20] we're just, we're just going through the pinball.

[21:22] You know, like some of these games, they, they're new for the year,

[21:26] but they're not brand new games.

[21:27] So we got, um,

[21:30] Minival madness, the Merlin edition from Chicago gaming company, 20, 25 game.

[21:36] You know, Alice is adventures in Wonderland.

[21:39] This game kind of revealed October of 2024.

[21:43] So it's now shipping this year.

[21:47] So it is eligible for all the awards that we're going to go over.

[21:52] But it, you know, it had a little bit of an earlier reveal, if you will.

[21:56] And then we, you know, kind of two titles from barrels of fun.

[22:01] And, you know, look, Winchester is not shipping yet.

[22:04] Neither is Beetlejuice.

[22:06] So we're going to talk about this.

[22:08] Like these games that aren't currently shipping to consumers,

[22:12] they are eligible for stuff like best artwork.

[22:16] They're eligible for stuff like best theme.

[22:20] They're eligible for stuff like best topper.

[22:23] If they've revealed something in this game,

[22:26] that is not going to change, then they're absolutely eligible.

[22:30] What they're not eligible for yet is stuff like gameplay and designer.

[22:37] And this and that, like, because just people haven't played it enough.

[22:41] And I haven't even played these games enough.

[22:42] So that is, you know, how we're going to do this.

[22:46] But Dune is a game that came out, I believe, sometime around March of 2025.

[22:51] And is I think to date they've made around a few hundred of these games.

[22:55] So it's the same thing with spooky, right?

[22:59] We had Evil Dead, which came out at the very end of 2024.

[23:04] It's really been spooky's game throughout 2025.

[23:08] And then we got the reveal of Beetlejuice, which set the pinball world on fire.

[23:15] If you got one, congratulations.

[23:17] If you got a show game, congratulations.

[23:20] But these two games have been, you know, a real turning point for this company.

[23:26] Obviously, we're going to talk about that more throughout the night.

[23:30] But Evil Dead and Beetlejuice have really been, you know, the new cornerstones,

[23:37] if you will, of what spooky pinball is Harry Potter, right?

[23:42] The theme that for a decade was impossible to get.

[23:47] The JK Rowling would not give permission to anyone to make Harry Potter.

[23:52] Pinball, the rumor was that she did not want these games to be in bars.

[23:57] She considered bars to be CD places and miraculously.

[24:02] Jersey Jack Pinball doesn't just get Harry Potter.

[24:05] They get all eight movies.

[24:07] They have all the assets, even if they mute some of the clips.

[24:10] Now they're unmuted.

[24:11] But you know what I'm saying?

[24:12] Like this game really is one of the, one, you know, one of the turning points in pinball

[24:21] in terms of magnanimous theme.

[24:25] And just a theme that we never thought we'd get.

[24:28] And now we have it in Harry Potter pinball.

[24:31] And then the last company, but not the least company when we turn and stern continues.

[24:38] You know, as you see, like every other company in the entire industry is maybe one game.

[24:44] Really one game a year.

[24:46] There really isn't another pinball company that is making more than one game a year.

[24:53] Some companies are still making leftover games that they revealed years prior,

[24:58] but stern pinball continues to be the juggernaut in this industry.

[25:04] And they've released in 2025 Dungeons and Dragons, King Kong,

[25:10] jaws 50th, Star Wars fall of the empire and the walking dead remastered.

[25:17] And so as much as, you know, we sort of compare all pinball companies equally,

[25:24] we have to take our hat off to stern pinball, a company that is capable of making these many games in one year.

[25:33] I mean, you look at this right here.

[25:35] This would be five years of spooky pinball.

[25:38] This would be five years of any other pinball company.

[25:42] This would be 79 years of Dutch pinball to get five games out the door.

[25:48] All right.

[25:48] So, but that being said, I think what we're going to see when we go through the award show is that stern pinball has some work to do.

[25:57] That quantity does not equal quality.

[26:00] And I've witnessed award shows, ladies and gentlemen, where stern pinball has swept,

[26:06] where they won almost every category.

[26:09] And I think what's happening now in pinball is a changing of the guard as I've been saying over the last year.

[26:15] I think the boutique companies have really improved their product.

[26:19] I think Jersey Jack finally has amazing gameplay.

[26:22] And I think it's a whole new, a whole new pinball world.

[26:26] Thank you, dark link.

[26:28] Merry Christmas.

[26:29] Appreciate the donation brother.

[26:31] And for those of you who are enjoying the show,

[26:33] would love any contributions that you see.

[26:37] So let's get to it.

[26:38] We're going to start today's Canada's, Kudos pinball award show with the best theme.

[26:45] Okay.

[26:45] So this is like an interesting category because this does not take into consideration how well you executed that theme.

[26:54] That will be the next award, which is best theme integration.

[26:59] So what is the best theme in all of pinball this past year?

[27:07] And when you think about it, what is that mean?

[27:09] You know, is it relevant to the demographic?

[27:13] Did it create great sales?

[27:16] Was it a theme that is just super popular in the world?

[27:20] Was it impossible to get?

[27:23] And so when we think about, you know, the different themes out there, you know, we have everything from dungeons and dragons.

[27:31] You know, it's funny watching Stranger Things season five right now.

[27:34] I feel like Stern messed up.

[27:36] I really do.

[27:37] I feel like Stern should have released D&D to coincide with the final season of Stranger Things in which dungeons and dragons is like a central part of that show.

[27:49] But I digress pinball companies have the worst marketing.

[27:53] We all know it.

[27:54] So if you look at all these themes and you say like, what's the best again?

[28:00] You know, you probably would land at Star Wars if we didn't have like so many Star Wars games that were underwhelming.

[28:08] So I'm curious like, what do you guys think is the best?

[28:13] I'm going to read some of your responses.

[28:15] Then I'm going to show you who won the Canadian Kudo.

[28:24] Are those my glasses?

[28:25] You found them?

[28:27] I'm going to say the only thing you're selling.

[28:29] All right.

[28:29] So the 2025, this is going to be so exciting that I can now read everything perfectly.

[28:37] Oh, there we go.

[28:38] Perfect.

[28:39] You're welcome.

[28:40] Thank you, Brenda.

[28:40] Brenda, come in and say hi real quick.

[28:42] Just come say hi.

[28:43] Just you look great.

[28:44] You don't you don't never have to check your how you look.

[28:47] Come here.

[28:47] Come in.

[28:49] Come say hi.

[28:51] Look at this.

[28:52] That's going everyone.

[28:53] Look at this beautiful.

[28:54] Yeah, she's in her pajamas and enjoy, I don't know, something on Netflix while you are

[28:59] down.

[28:59] That's because I got a preview of it earlier on.

[29:01] She saw I worked all day on this deck.

[29:03] Okay, hopefully they appreciated.

[29:04] I'm going to be on the couch.

[29:05] All day long.

[29:06] All right.

[29:07] All right.

[29:08] So the the winner for the best theme of 2025 is Harry Potter.

[29:18] And now I realize that my my little image is going to bleed over the winner

[29:23] the title, but but you'll know what the winner is.

[29:26] It doesn't matter.

[29:26] Like this is the okay.

[29:27] So Harry Potter.

[29:29] Look, in the end, in the end, there is no denying the fact that this theme,

[29:36] when you think about it, it's the greatest selling book series of all time.

[29:43] Another interesting fact, when they made Harry Potter the novel,

[29:48] they originally only printed 500 copies in the UK.

[29:54] They also didn't believe that anybody would buy a book about a boy

[30:00] wizard if it was written by a woman.

[30:03] This is this is all true.

[30:06] So that's why they had her abbreviate her name, JK Rowling.

[30:11] She has no K middle name.

[30:13] So it is all made up to have to make her sound more like Tolkien.

[30:20] Oh, man.

[30:21] Thank you so much.

[30:22] Turbo 20 $5.00.

[30:23] I'm a subscriber from day one.

[30:24] I never canceled.

[30:26] Thank you, brother.

[30:28] I appreciate that.

[30:31] Okay.

[30:31] So Harry Potter, best theme of the year.

[30:36] I think a lot of you agree with this.

[30:38] I saw a lot of the comments.

[30:41] Very, very, very amazing that the Abyss family was able to secure this game.

[30:46] Not just secure the theme.

[30:49] Also get the theme song and you know, all eight movies.

[30:55] All right.

[30:55] I know no one ever does give a hundred bucks.

[30:57] So thank you, Turbo, man.

[30:58] I really appreciate it.

[30:59] Wow.

[31:00] I didn't do this for the money.

[31:01] All right.

[31:01] So this is where it gets interesting.

[31:03] This is why I love Pinball because just because you have the best theme.

[31:10] Doesn't always mean you integrate it the theme the best.

[31:15] So as we think about best theme integration,

[31:19] to me, that's something on a whole nother level.

[31:23] That is how well did you take the theme and how well did you create a world under glass?

[31:31] Did you put all the elements from that theme under the glass in a way that's physical?

[31:39] In a way that's relatable to fans of the theme.

[31:44] Did you, you know, did you like create mechanisms and a variety of mechanisms that really just

[31:53] bring the theme to life?

[31:56] You know, and so when I think about theme integration, did you get the assets that people want?

[32:03] Did you put Brenda?

[32:04] It's too loud up there Brenda.

[32:06] Thank you.

[32:08] Well, like I'm not doing a war show down here.

[32:10] You know, and did you get the clips?

[32:12] Did you get the actor to do call outs?

[32:15] Like how, like, how much did you surround the game?

[32:21] With, you know, just bringing the theme to life in the best possible way.

[32:27] And so as we think the knobs, you know,

[32:32] King Kong with no assets from the King Kong movies ain't going to take you.

[32:36] You're not going to get this with no Arnold and Predator, right?

[32:41] Beetlejuice too early to tell.

[32:43] I'll say that right now.

[32:46] You know, Winchester too early to tell.

[32:49] Star Wars got everything in it, but nothing feels special.

[32:54] So the winner for best theme integration in a pinball machine in 2025.

[33:00] And this was tough.

[33:01] And I want to say this came down to two games that I was back and forth.

[33:07] So much so that I even had the other one winning earlier today.

[33:11] And I just, I went around both games for like in like 20 minutes.

[33:17] And you know what it came down to?

[33:20] I split hairs on this.

[33:23] I split hairs because it came down to the amount that's under the glass.

[33:29] That's interactive and really brings the theme to life.

[33:33] And so the winner is

[33:37] evil dead for best theme integration.

[33:42] And the reason evil dead wins best theme integration is surely because of how much of like

[33:51] the evil dead world is in this game.

[33:54] And I go to features of this game.

[34:00] And to take nothing away from the amazing theme integrations in Harry Potter and in June.

[34:06] Because those were the other ones that were really in my strong consideration.

[34:11] I just didn't feel like Potter.

[34:14] A giving example why Potter didn't win best theme integration for me.

[34:19] You don't even have Hogwarts castle under the glass.

[34:23] Right?

[34:24] The main thing is the spinning staircase.

[34:26] That's that's the main mech and like quidditch, right?

[34:30] You play this quidditch game which is flying around Hogwarts castle on broomsticks.

[34:36] This game, this sport.

[34:38] Are you telling me that that upper left play field is like playing quidditch?

[34:42] Come on.

[34:43] That game needed to have the Star Wars hyperdrive in it.

[34:49] You know, all the way around the game should have been the game of quidditch.

[34:52] So I just think evil dead with the shotgun mech, the cabin, the hand, you know,

[34:59] all the stuff in this game that had that pops up from underneath, from the basement.

[35:05] Like, oh, there's so much in this game that interacts and integrates with the theme so perfectly

[35:13] that I just feel like evil dead took the theme and just integrated it so well and with so

[35:22] much stuff. Okay.

[35:23] Now, I do want to say very, very strong honorable mentions to Dune Pimball and to Harry Potter,

[35:33] which would have been, you know, runner-ups in this category.

[35:38] Best Asians.

[35:40] You know, this is one, when I think about animations, this is getting to be a tricky one

[35:47] because so much of Pimball now and so much of the Pimball magic.

[35:53] Is really basically on the screen now.

[35:57] And I do believe that the LCD screen in our hobby has been a blessing and a curse. I do.

[36:05] I think about my first Pimball machine, Lord of the Rings, which I still think has some of the

[36:11] best Pimball moments and magic in any Pimball ever. And it didn't rely on the screen.

[36:20] It was all below the glass. And before they had a screen, a big LCD screen,

[36:25] the designers really had to put more magic below the glass. So I do think that there's a lot

[36:32] happening now on the LCD screen at all times, most of which you will never see. You will never see

[36:41] 80% of what's happening while you're looking down. But that being said, there is an art form

[36:48] to making what is on that screen really look beautiful, cohesive and organized. And, you know,

[36:57] sort of connect it to your gameplay. So, you know, once you learn how everything's going to be

[37:05] in the game and on the screen, there's a beauty to what the animations are. And what I struggle

[37:11] with, and I mean this when I say this, what I really struggle with with this category, and I have

[37:16] to be honest, this is kind of one of my least favorite categories because I really don't

[37:24] feel like it's fair because certain games, Aala, King Kong, if you will, are lying solely on

[37:33] animations. So it feels a little unfair to have a game that's got nothing but animations competing

[37:41] with games that have clips from movies, clips from TV shows. You know, they're not really animating

[37:52] much other than the templates around those clips and the fonts and, you know, segues between things.

[38:01] But it's really, really hard category to land on. So when I looked at everything and I went and I

[38:14] looked at I looked at Dungeons and Dragons, I looked at King Kong, I watched Harry Potter, I watched

[38:18] Predator Evil Dead, Beetlejuice, you know, in the end though, in the end, for me like what

[38:26] put this game over the top was just the overall beauty of the presentation of the game.

[38:37] And that to me, to

[38:44] Jean Paul de Wynn for Harry Potter of Best Animations. And this maybe, I don't think so,

[38:51] maybe the last game he does with JJP for a while, I know he's now moving on to doing

[39:01] back to the future with Dutch Pimball. But when I, again, this one to me, I think he deserves it.

[39:11] I think there's praise to go around for other animations that happen in Pimball. It is a really

[39:19] difficult category because the mediums are so radically different and the way the games are coded.

[39:26] But I will say Harry Potter, when you just look at what's on the screen, it's absolutely gorgeous.

[39:34] Albeit a little bit complex, but it's absolutely gorgeous. All right, let's

[39:40] because I, you know, we get the best coat. How's everybody doing? Let's take a little pause.

[39:47] Have a drink. You guys got a drink in hand? Anyone got a drink?

[39:55] Williams Road Show is the best game ever made. I don't know, Brennan, we're here.

[40:00] This is free of charge. No one had a flight of Texas for this.

[40:05] The crack and dude is cracking me up. Let's see, the hardest part of this is waiting five minutes

[40:09] for your god awful comebacks. Who's, are you guys like, I love what's going on with cracking here?

[40:19] Let's see. Cracking, welcome to the party.

[40:25] No, you know, the chat here is always the best. So thank you guys for hanging out and chatting.

[40:30] Keep it hilarious. Cracking, keep it funny, brother. Oh man, Friday, who's not excited to go

[40:38] back to work next week? I mean, it's just like Monday's coming. It just feels like

[40:43] that big dark blob in fifth element coming towards us. We all got to get back to work. Most of us,

[40:50] but it's, it's not there yet. It's not, it's not there yet. Cos, thank you for the stars, brother.

[40:57] I do think we've had the most amount of money ever donated ever, Brenda, $100. $100.

[41:05] Let's see, from, from Turbo, 20 pounds. He's been a five dollar amongst the scriber from day one.

[41:17] I, I love it. I love it.

[41:23] All right, let's see.

[41:29] Oh my god, cracking. Keep, keep it, keep it professional. Okay, so best code.

[41:35] Best code. This one. This, this is like, this is another hard one.

[41:42] You know, when you think about best code, it's, to me, the best code is simple. And, and I know

[41:52] that is something that is a little hard to explain. But when a pinball code is done well,

[42:04] it does a few things. First and foremost, it connects you to the theme in a, in a very easy way.

[42:14] You, you walk up to the game, you see the theme, you head start, and instantly it communicates

[42:22] what you're doing. You know what you're doing. And, and from there, I think really good code

[42:30] is deep, but easy to understand. Thank you, Dr. Pinball for the five bucks, the five euros or li.

[42:40] It's easy to understand. And I think if I had one indictment of a lot of modern pinball games,

[42:47] they're overly complex. There's way too much going on. And I get that a lot of these coders have

[42:55] a lot that they want to do. But they should leave some of it on the editing room floor.

[43:01] And, you know, I know that Twippy Award is named after Lyman Sheets Jr. And Lyman is still the

[43:07] greatest coder of all time because Lyman knew that you could make a game approachable, understandable,

[43:16] and deep at the same time without being complex. And that is something that not a lot of modern

[43:24] pinball machines understand. And when it comes to best code too, the other thing that's really,

[43:31] and we're going to have another category you're going to see is best launch code is a lot of these

[43:35] games are now coming out with incomplete code from day one. And, you know, when you think about that,

[43:44] it's really a tragedy that a lot of people are buying these games and they're half baked. And

[43:50] but, you know, when a game fully matures and you think about the code on the game,

[43:57] what is the code in these games that really does sort of pull you in to the theme has a lot of

[44:06] really fun moments. The code also like, wakens up all that stuff that's under the glass, all the

[44:13] mechs, and really, you know, creates those pinball moments. If I were to like, in the most simple way

[44:20] articulate what creates the greatest pinball moments, it's the code. Because the coder is the

[44:30] conductor, if you will, of the orchestra that's in front of you. And a coder can make a game do

[44:38] anything. So, okay, so here's the deal. Jaws 50th is not eligible for this category because

[44:47] Jaws 50th came out like over a year ago. Jaws 50th, absolutely, I'm just going to say this right

[44:57] now. If it were amongst this set, it would win. But it's not because Jaws code has already been out for

[45:06] like a year and a half. The 50th was just a trim package. So, like, just keep in mind, that's why

[45:14] Jaws can't win here. Well, Jaws 50th should not be eligible for best code in 2025 if you, in my honest

[45:24] opinion, all right. All right. So, here we go. Crackin. You know what? You just called me, you just

[45:36] said your board. Oh, man, I'm going to let, I'm going to let, I'm going to let, you know what,

[45:44] I'm going to let everyone else aside because I just think, now I just think you're trolling, bro,

[45:48] and I don't, you know what, Crackin? I never see you on here ever. And now, you see, you made the

[45:53] mistake, bro. I'm just going to, I'm going to let you know this before you go. You made the mistake.

[45:59] You just got to know how to troll the right way. Troll in the chats. No, he's been here, but he's

[46:07] not a member of the key. He's, he's never here. He's never here. He's gone. He's gone. It's, it's

[46:14] all right. He's all right. He'll let him sign in with another name. Yeah. Okay. So, let me ask you

[46:26] guys, so I'm going to do this from now. What, what do you guys think out of this list is the greatest

[46:34] code of 2025. And I'm going to do this from now on. I'm going to ask you guys to type what you think

[46:41] should win here. And then I will announce the Canadian Cudo winner. I want to see how close I am

[46:48] to the populist vote. Harry Potter, evil dead, evil dead. DnD, jaws 50th, Harry Potter, Harry Potter.

[47:02] DnD, evil dead. Right. I love that I'm seeing like the same three games over and over.

[47:11] King Kong. Okay. One King Kong vote. Where is Merlin's or. Yeah. Merlin's is not a list.

[47:21] Evil dead. Okay. DnD evil dead. I will say this. I will say this.

[47:30] The three games that everybody's mentioned. If you're even mentioning DnD King,

[47:37] is DnD Harry Potter and evil dead? What were the majority of them?

[47:42] I think if you own one of those three games, you have a very, very amazingly coded game.

[47:50] But there can only be one winner. There can only be one Cudo award winner. And again, when I think

[47:56] about the code and the moments, I just think this game just really comes at you from the very moment

[48:05] you hit start and you get to select which movie you want to be. It is evil dead.

[48:15] So best code. Canada Cudo winner goes to Ben Heck, Ben Heckendorn,

[48:24] over at spooky pinball. And yes, the AI version of Ben Heck is a little weirder to look at.

[48:32] But there's just something beautiful happening over at spooky and in their coding department

[48:39] where they really get it. And they understand the simplicity, but also the magic of what makes great

[48:50] code work. And I think it's a lesson to everybody else out there. Don't over complicate it.

[49:00] You know, I'll never forget the moment when Keith Johnson handed me the Avatar rule set.

[49:08] And I knew the game wasn't going to be good because of that. What is this? Like nobody thinks about

[49:18] Avatar like that. The truth, Carneth, evil dead. Thank you for the $20. But look, I think this game

[49:26] is really amazingly coded. I think people have a lot of high hopes for beetle juice because of

[49:32] what's happening over at spooky. And congratulations to Ben Heck. I think you've done some amazing work.

[49:38] And I'm happy to see you putting your skills on a game that is making its way to market and really just

[49:46] seeing a lot of accolades. So okay. But the reason I this this is a new category. You know, you're not

[49:53] going to see this category at the twippies. And I don't know what Jamie's doing over at the round table

[49:59] with those award shows. I don't know if there's, you know, carries got his vote on the best of.

[50:05] There's a lot of us, you know, and look, I love all of it.

[50:11] 797 y'all, HP of the crazy death killer HP Dodge Charger Redder, the number of things that

[50:17] made no sense. The stranger things finale. All right, you know, maximum prime broke. Thank you for

[50:22] the $10, bro. I don't understand exactly what you're saying. I kind of need a rosetta stone to

[50:27] decipher all of that. But I did think the stranger things finale was total garbage. The whole season

[50:37] was garbage. Like I don't need to see all of them crying every single episode. And then all of a

[50:44] sudden they're they're going up against a Godzilla-like creature with with garbage cans. And like,

[50:51] the whole thing was ridiculous. They lost me. They lost me. Okay, I don't want to talk about it.

[50:59] I'm not going to spoil it for those who haven't watched. Okay. So best launch code. And the reason

[51:06] why I wanted to make this a category is I think this hobby has entered into a space where far too

[51:16] many companies are releasing games well before they should release the games. I see games like

[51:25] Dune Pimbal, a game that is a multi-billion dollar franchise that has really like everything

[51:34] you'd want from the theme released too early because they were anxious about getting crowded

[51:43] out or like you know overshadowed if you will by King Kong and Harry Potter. So they released the

[51:50] game early with the code so incomplete that everyone's first experiences with the game is bad.

[51:59] And when you do that, all you do is hurt the reputation of the game. And I would argue that

[52:06] Dune Pimbal is a game that has never recovered from that terrible launch. And you know, there's just

[52:14] too many games that are coming out these days. Look at the walking dead. Stern Pimbal, the biggest

[52:20] Pimbal company in the world is remastering a game that came out like 13 years ago. And they

[52:28] released the game with everything. The whole code is licensure approval pending. How? How?

[52:35] How did you have so much time to get this game out? And then everything is still pending approval?

[52:41] And again, you see the same response like everyone's is like, ah, like I

[52:47] there's too many games that are doing it right. And so I wanted to recognize a company that

[52:55] on day one gives you the right product on day one. And sorry, but how many of you out there

[53:05] buy anything in your lives? That's incomplete. The date arrives. Do you buy a watch? And there's

[53:13] only 11 hours on it? Do you buy a car and it's missing one wheel?

[53:19] So, so out of all these Pimbal companies, all these games, I just want to say there is one company

[53:26] that consistently on day one of sales, day one of customers unboxing their games, gives you the

[53:37] most. And this has been the way for a while. And I think they deserve the credit for this.

[53:44] I think it takes effort and I think it takes discipline to do this and to do this right.

[53:52] It takes the right staff. And so the winner for the best launch code in 2025

[54:02] goes to Harry Potter and and Mr. Joe Katz. And you know, I play Harry Potter on day one and

[54:16] there's so much in it. There's so much in it. And they've been polishing it. They've been adjusting

[54:22] things here and there. But for the most part, you know, this game on day one absolutely had a ton

[54:31] in it. And I think, you know, Jersey Jack as an organization has consistently put a lot in their

[54:38] games on day one. So, J.J.P. code is always I mean, I, you know, there's going to be

[54:49] troll comments that I'll try not to read, but that I don't agree that, you know, that that J.J.P.

[54:57] has always had pretty much like consistent, you know, code at launch. And I think they deserve

[55:05] the credit for doing that. Ralph did a great job with the launch as well. Well, we're not there yet.

[55:13] We have best pinball launch. How do you guys feel about this? How you guys feeling right now?

[55:27] 144 people. You know, when I love about the comments, I'm reading it. You get a comment like the

[55:35] code on Potter is superb. And then another comment's like, it's a bunch of jumbled mess.

[55:43] It's like, and this is why I love this hobby. Like literally, you guys are both commenting on the same

[55:48] thing and couldn't have different opinions, you know, more different opinions.

[55:53] I am drinking them and having.

[56:01] Are you guys enjoying the show? Are you guys enjoying the show? You join the party? Free of charge?

[56:08] You know, like I enjoyed making this. I'm sorry that my little screen in the bottom right cuts off

[56:14] the winning names, but you know what I'm talking about. I just want to say thank you guys for

[56:19] tuning in on a Friday night. There's a lot of fun. We're going to do tomorrow, the Saturday mornings

[56:25] spectacular. I think we're, I just want to say thank you. I really do. I thank each and every one

[56:32] of you for hanging out for being a part of this hobby. The more I get older and the more I look at

[56:39] the world, the more I realize the most valuable thing is community and relationships.

[56:43] And I mean that. There's a level of community that this hobby delivers that is way more valuable

[56:55] than the games. Awards shows are hard, Jack, Dave, or Jack, remember when you did it?

[57:01] Jack, I still remember when you, um,

[57:05] um, in a moto. I remember getting up there. That was probably my favorite,

[57:12] trippy speech I ever gave where I talked about how I always say the games are,

[57:19] what will I say? Like non-essential, but they are essential because they bring us all together.

[57:24] I love you, Jack Danger. Can we all for a moment just give a virtual round of applause to Mr. Jack

[57:33] Danger who's hanging out here tonight? I really can't,

[57:39] I can't even explain what a beautiful man Jack is and a beautiful human being.

[57:48] And, you know, it's so exciting to see Jack go from being a content creator to a designer.

[57:55] Um, and, and he's still to this day. And I mean this like to this day,

[58:02] there is not another human being on planet earth that can play pinball while streaming,

[58:11] while reading the chat, while engaging everybody and making it work.

[58:19] You know what I'm saying? Pinball streaming is probably the boringest thing you could ever watch

[58:26] on planet earth. And Jack Danger makes it exciting. To me, that's like hard stop genius.

[58:40] Hard stop. We can't wait to see your half a Pokemon.

[58:45] You know what Jack, whatever whatever part of Pokemon sucks, that's George Gomez is part.

[58:52] The parts of Pokemon we like, Jack Danger's. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be good. It's gonna

[58:59] be good. I love you Jack. Always a good friend, you know, had many many many great conversations with

[59:05] Jack. Always off the record. Always off the record. He never gives many leaks by the way. By the way,

[59:10] if you're a stern employee listening to this right now, Jack never discloses anything he should

[59:17] in. He's an adamant professional. Even as much as I try to bribe him to give me like info and

[59:23] details, he never does. So screw you Jack. I know it's Pokemon. And the good part of the game is yours.

[59:34] I feel like Gomez is gonna put the James Bond missile like somewhere in the game. He's like, you

[59:39] know, like they never really appreciated my James Bond missile until jiggly puff was on it.

[59:44] Like I just something like do you guys actually think George Gomez like actually has seen a single

[59:50] Pokemon episode. But here's kicker. Do do we think maybe it's not Pokemon. It has to be though.

[01:00:00] It's so weird to me. I just I have this vision of like George taking over Pokemon and being forced

[01:00:06] to watch Pokemon cartoons and and him being like, what have I done with my life? How did it come to

[01:00:12] this? I'm driving a Porsche and I have to watch Pokemon. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

[01:00:21] Oh man. All right. I feel like we're getting into it. I feel like we're getting it took a while.

[01:00:25] It took a while. You know, it's hard. It's hard to do an award shows. I can feel I can feel the round

[01:00:32] tables and dip in of canada. You know, six. Where would I win? Tripi six times in eligible.

[01:00:42] Oh, the Manhattan's kicking in a little bit. That's what's happening. How you guys doing? We

[01:00:46] having a good time? I feel like it got a lot better when we kicked that that dude out, right?

[01:00:55] It's like it's just like the trolls. Hector, what's up brother? Hector's in the house.

[01:01:00] Franchise in the house. Brett Abis might be joining tonight. Ian's in the house.

[01:01:06] Oh man. I love you guys. By the way, I just want to say I love you guys. I'm not even drunk.

[01:01:11] I should get drunk and just, I don't know. Talk about Star Wars, fall of the Empire being a metal,

[01:01:18] but I won't. Best music. Best music in a pen. Who's got, you know, on the bright side,

[01:01:30] we all die. So I'm going to get effed up tonight. Like, like, if MGK was in a pen, it would win

[01:01:36] this. By the way, if you guys, if you guys haven't listened to MGK's Lost Americana, like, it's the

[01:01:43] best album of like the year, like easily. Okay. Star Wars is really good. I know Star Wars.

[01:01:50] Star Wars has the theme song on repeat every new ball. It's annoying. The space on theme song.

[01:01:58] Okay. So here's the thing about music. And this has always been another difficult category,

[01:02:03] like animations, because the thing about music and best music in a pen is sometimes you get,

[01:02:11] like a music pen, right? You get, you want to see the nominees again? Are you serious? Well,

[01:02:18] here, I mean, here's most, I mean, when you think about music, you know, sometimes like,

[01:02:26] what I love about this year, there's no music pens. There's no music pens. So we don't have to

[01:02:33] give the winner to like guns and roses or ACDC, right? It's like, like, I always felt like that was

[01:02:41] cheating. Like, okay, so like some dude, like Scott the Nese is going to make better songs

[01:02:46] than Axel Rose, you know? So when you think about music and like what makes, well,

[01:02:54] francey Winchester is not eligible for this. I know it's up here, but it's just too new. Like,

[01:03:02] I just put Winchester up here to satiate the 525 guys who have one, but it's too new. I haven't

[01:03:10] heard enough of the music nobody has. So when you think about music, it's interesting because you get,

[01:03:19] you know, D&D's got very like D&D specific, like it fits.

[01:03:28] Beetlejuice has again, ineligible for this because it's too early. Harry Potter's got the

[01:03:34] the John Williams theme song and David Theal on music. But yeah, I will say like with Potter, like,

[01:03:41] I feel like feels feels like feels presence wasn't the same as it was on pirates. And I think

[01:03:50] people would agree with that. Evil Dead's got great music, Portal. I haven't heard the music

[01:03:56] predator. Yeah, it's got the music from the movie. But I'm going to tell you right now,

[01:04:04] the winner in this category, it comes down to one simple thing. This is a game where

[01:04:11] the music, and I've played this game a bunch. And like, the music just drives the experience.

[01:04:22] So if I were to position this as that, like name me a game where the music just is driving

[01:04:31] the pinball experience. It's the momentum in the game. It's pushing you through the game itself.

[01:04:39] And it's just like an epic wave of sounds and orchestra. And it just hits. It just hits.

[01:04:55] And I mean, it was a cinematic masterpiece with this orchestration.

[01:05:03] And it goes to to doon pinball. And I put names up here because I think there's some people in

[01:05:16] this hobby that are not household names that should be. And I'm hoping that this award show

[01:05:23] starts to give some recognition, if you will, to some individuals in this hobby that are absolutely

[01:05:30] phenomenal. And so Jeff Dodson, aka Dirtypool, who did the music for doon alongside the movie score,

[01:05:43] is absolutely phenomenal. And I do believe that this game has one of the greatest audio experiences

[01:05:53] you will ever hear in a pinball machine ever. And it is on a whole different level.

[01:06:01] And again, didn't launch with the greatest code, but I don't think anybody in a dark game room

[01:06:12] who today turns on a doon and cranks the volume. I feel like doon on volume two is like every other game on volume 10.

[01:06:25] And it's an absolute audio masterpiece. So thank you, Jeff. And again, I want each and every one of you here

[01:06:38] to add Jeff Dodson to your name of talented individuals in our hobby. The same way you know

[01:06:48] Scott Denesey, the same way you know David Thiel. I think Jeff Dodson needs to be a household name

[01:06:57] in this hobby. We got Dodson here. Ian, you're a funny man. You're funny. I'm going to keep

[01:07:03] drinking these Manhattan's. Is that okay with you guys? I feel I feel looser. That's what she's

[01:07:09] is that what she said? I think maybe I don't know. Is that appropriate? I don't know.

[01:07:18] Oh, this is good. This is good. Nine, ten on a Friday night. What else are you going to do?

[01:07:24] What else you can do? Yeah, I love it. I love it.

[01:07:26] Yeah, doon sounds. Look, we got bug in the house. We got more categories to go, baby.

[01:07:39] What's up? Scream and scream and scream and scream. It doesn't roll off the tongue. I got to be

[01:07:47] on this bug. I mean, it's there. The words are there. But when I see it, it almost like makes me

[01:07:53] dyslexic seeing bugs scream and stream. I don't know. Maybe now I got it. How you guys doing?

[01:08:02] Are you guys all members of Canada's Bimbal Podcast, by the way? I lost another like 10 or 14

[01:08:07] members at the end of every month. People cancel and they always come back. It's always annoying.

[01:08:13] Like, seriously, it is $5 a month. It's $5 a month. I went to the like local village store to

[01:08:25] get an iced coffee with five bucks for one iced coffee. I give you on average 12 shows,

[01:08:34] lives. We do chats. I'm just saying it's the only good, there's no tariffs on Canada's Bimbal

[01:08:42] Podcast. Feeling saucy now. I'm feeling saucy now. I may actually tell you guys what I saw

[01:08:55] about Sonic the Hedgehog. Is that what I know about back to the future? This is the problem

[01:08:59] when Canada gets saucy. It starts talking like freely like, oh shoot, what's he going to say about

[01:09:04] Sonic? Oh no, what's it back to the future? I know people have seen it. Talk to them.

[01:09:14] No, it's good. It's good. It's good because it's all good vibes now. It's all good vibes.

[01:09:19] Like, nothing happened tonight. It's going to be negative. You know, we're not going to talk

[01:09:23] about Cuphead. We're not going to talk about American Pimbal's 18th logo. Have you seen these guys?

[01:09:27] They just have a new logo now. Again, I know French is here. French, you like, how many logos

[01:09:35] is American Pimbal going to have? They've got more logos than games.

[01:09:43] I'm going to tell you right now, American Pimbal will never, ever make a great game.

[01:09:51] And the reason why is the karma from that company will sink them. Okay. And when you think about

[01:10:02] a brand, what great brand do you know that has had to change the logo five times?

[01:10:10] Name me one. Name me one. It's like, it's like, they just don't get it. They don't get it.

[01:10:18] And if you work at American Pimbal, I feel sorry for you because you guys came after me

[01:10:27] and tried to get me terminated. Yeah. There it is. The truth comes out.

[01:10:35] Not only that, they came after me right when I had a new baby and tried to get me terminated.

[01:10:44] So I just was just like, just like, forget that happened.

[01:10:50] Now, not going to do it. Not going to do it. Not you. All right.

[01:10:54] All right. Best mech in a game.

[01:11:00] Brenda.

[01:11:03] Brenda is hot, by the way. I'm getting kind of saucy. I'm feeling like Jack Danger and I need to get her

[01:11:11] get us, like going to us, like, I don't know, just like, have a phone conversation and

[01:11:17] you know what I hate about Jack Danger is every time I see him, he's like, taller than me,

[01:11:23] more handsome than me. It's just the thing. The thing.

[01:11:29] Cause spa day.

[01:11:31] Dude, you know, Jack, what did like a stern spa day be amazing? Like, who the hell wants to go see

[01:11:37] John Borg star wars? So if Stern invited me to go see John Borg star wars,

[01:11:43] I'd be like, nah, I'm good, but they were like, but we're going to do a spa day with our team

[01:11:50] in a spa in a sauna. I'd be like, I'll be there and I'll be there. Let me know when I'll be there.

[01:11:55] You know what I'm saying? I much rather go in a sauna with the Stern team than a spa.

[01:12:03] Man.

[01:12:05] Uh,

[01:12:07] Pokemon and chill. It's going to be a good, it's going to get good. Man, I may need more of

[01:12:11] them in hadn't sooner. I'm like, I'm now I'm getting saucy and I don't really have much dinner.

[01:12:15] I like, there's something about like that, like buzz you get when you have had no food all day.

[01:12:22] It's how I stay in shape.

[01:12:26] Oh, all right. So best, Matt, I've got, I've got a whole man had him bad. So we're going to do

[01:12:34] this tonight, baby. We're going to do this. We have 179 people now. Like, people just like discovering

[01:12:38] this now. Like, what happened? Is Colin here? Colin here? Twippy's dead. Twippy's dead. Okay.

[01:12:45] To me, this, this category means a lot. And the reason why best mech means a lot is I do think

[01:12:57] that this hobby has been misallocated to digital assets. To me, Pimball will always be

[01:13:14] an analog physical game, analog, physical, a steel ball hitting things, interacting with it.

[01:13:24] And this is like, this is like everything. You know, it's so embarrassing. I'm just going to say

[01:13:31] this. It's embarrassing that our hobby in 2025, if you put the best Pimball mechs of this year

[01:13:41] against the best Pimball mechs of 1995, 1995's mechs are way better.

[01:13:50] 30 years later, we've absolutely abandoned mechanical engineering that's actually impressive.

[01:14:02] And when you think about Pimball and the reason why when people walk up to a game, they get excited,

[01:14:08] they see something mechanical they want to see happen. Nobody walks up to a game and wants to see

[01:14:15] something happening on the screen. Nobody's like disappointed because there wasn't like a digital thing

[01:14:24] that occurred. We're disappointed because the physicality isn't there. And you know, like,

[01:14:31] there's a lot. There's a lot of effort to bring this back. And I will say, like, I think we've

[01:14:44] we've reached a point in Pimball when we look at the games of 2025. I don't know, out of all the

[01:14:51] stuff in Pimball, I pulled up like what I would consider to be the best mechs of this year.

[01:15:00] Right. Am I missing anything? Where the potter stares, we get the worm and doom. We've got

[01:15:09] the the gong, kinkong, the subway. We've got, you know, evil dead with the cabin. We've got D&D's got,

[01:15:16] you know, both the dragon and the cube that uses a magnet in two different ways.

[01:15:28] I'm going to go get another drink. And I want you guys to think about this. I'm going to ask you guys,

[01:15:36] what your pick would be in a second. Don't say it yet. But I'll say this. I just want to say this

[01:15:43] without hesitation. There's work to be done in this hobby. This hobby, there was a comment made

[01:15:55] a few years ago. And it was made by a content creator. I think Zach said this. That shots are the

[01:16:09] new toys in Pimball. Like literally just like like a physical shot is the new toy. And I want to

[01:16:17] I want to say like that is what Stern Pimball wants to hear. That is what a lot of these Pimball

[01:16:26] companies want to hear that we've removed the mechanical magic from these games and we consider

[01:16:32] just flow to be a toy. And flow is not a toy. I'm sorry. A great toy is the disappearing

[01:16:45] magnet genie in toden. It's the theater of magic trunk. It's the Adam's family thing grabbing the ball.

[01:16:57] A great toy. You know, when you think about in the world of Pimball, like a mech that just interacts

[01:17:05] with the ball. Like I consider like ballrog bashing him is amazing the way he swings out. The ring

[01:17:13] that magnetically grabs a ball in mid air. The in erosmith, you know, the toy box that flings the

[01:17:21] ball. The milk can shot in Houdini. You know, there's great toys throughout Pimball Rudy from

[01:17:29] funhouse. Guys, name me in the chat section here. Your favorite mechanisms in Pimball. Look, I love

[01:17:37] the crane and Batman. Even though it doesn't have anything to do with Batman, I love slimer swinging

[01:17:42] down. You know, there's just like, there's just a lot of like nothingness in modern Pimball. The

[01:17:53] you know, the dinosaur and Jurassic Park, the bridge in Godzilla, the building in Godzilla,

[01:18:00] alien eating the ball. But my point is when we say like best mech in Pimball, we should we should

[01:18:06] have a plethora of responses and we don't. And we don't. The laser cannons in Star Trek, the next

[01:18:17] generation. And I really do believe that this hobby in general, this industry in general has

[01:18:27] emphasized digital assets over mechanical assets. And for obvious reasons, they're cheaper.

[01:18:36] They don't break, but they're cheaper and you know, they're cheaper. And yet we're spending the

[01:18:43] most we've ever spent on Pimball. And yet when you look at the games mechanically, they're not as

[01:18:49] impressive as they should be. I mean, the fact that we accepted jaws not eating the ball as a

[01:19:04] thing is embarrassing. Hold on a second. I need to get some more men had him. Let's do this.

[01:19:10] I'll be right back.

[01:19:35] Oh man, I just, I just look like a big poor. This is a big poor.

[01:19:43] This is a big poor, which means it's about to get saucy in here.

[01:19:49] All right, here we go. I mean, Indiana Jones.

[01:19:57] All right, so the best mech in Pimball this year.

[01:19:59] Okay. So the winner of this category and the reason why this is winning is I want to recognize

[01:20:16] a company that is creating a mech that like does like three things,

[01:20:25] like blew up the bomb a little bit, but they put it in anyway. And it just like, it just feels like

[01:20:37] we need more of this. And again, like, the winner of this is Dune. And I also want this man to become

[01:20:47] another household name. How many of you out there know who Travis, I mean, I don't want to butchers

[01:20:55] last name. Most man, most man, most man. So he's the mechanical engineer over at barrels of fun

[01:21:07] that made this mech. And you know, the reason why I want Travis to become a household name as well,

[01:21:18] that doesn't look like Travis. I mean, frankly, I grabbed it off of the LinkedIn.

[01:21:27] This is AI, by the way. So like, imagine,

[01:21:34] well, I mean, I made him look a little, I mean, Jamie, Jamie says it does. This was Travis's LinkedIn

[01:21:42] photos. So I mean, given through my AI filter, Jamie, how you doing brother, by the way, I love you.

[01:21:51] Hold on, I left the refrigerator open. Hold on.

[01:21:53] I

[01:22:07] where can it is leaving the refrigerator door open. All right. So, okay.

[01:22:13] So the worm mech in this game,

[01:22:16] it's absolutely an engineering marvel. I know it slows down gameplay a little bit. You know what,

[01:22:29] I'm so tired. Can I just can I get on a soapbox? I'm so tired of these, you know, tournament players

[01:22:37] who hate mechs. Like you guys, like go player stern pros and behose because I'm just tired of

[01:22:50] of tournament players that don't want to mech to do something wow and slow game play down because

[01:22:56] they're so busy trying to win 40 bucks or translate. Like, sorry, I'm spending 10 to 15,000 dollars

[01:23:05] on a game. Like, I want something wow. I want something when my friends come over. Let me show

[01:23:14] you this game. Do that. Nobody cares about your stupid, like, never ending flow to win a damn

[01:23:23] translate because you're in a tournament. A pinball machine that doesn't have a mechanical moment

[01:23:32] of wow is garbage. Let me repeat that. A pinball machine that doesn't have a mechanical moment of

[01:23:41] wow is garbage. Now, you could you could ask me, so what about guns and roses, Canada?

[01:23:50] Right. What about guns and roses? And I would argue that guns and roses, mechanical wow.

[01:23:58] I know this is weird. It's the lights. It's the lights. It's the damn lights.

[01:24:08] Guns and roses, like, it's such a weird pin to have the only one in my house because like, I really,

[01:24:15] it doesn't do me any favors because it doesn't support anything anymore. You know what I'm saying?

[01:24:27] It's like, it doesn't shoot good. It doesn't have max that are good. It's not even like a relevant

[01:24:34] theme anymore for the most part. Like, it's not even like axles on like, you know, he's not

[01:24:39] no zempick now. He looks better now than he does in the pin. I don't I'm going to get rid of it.

[01:24:46] I promise. But it's still I will say this guns and roses when new people come over my house and

[01:24:54] they are like, wow, you have a pinball machine and you show them like living that die. They're

[01:25:01] blown away, man. And it's like easy to get to it. It's not like, imagine like your friends come

[01:25:07] over and you're like, here's a pirate to the Caribbean. And let's select from one of 22 characters.

[01:25:13] They're like, go screw yourself, bro. Like, and then even when you pick one of 22 characters,

[01:25:19] how long before you can show somebody a, a wow moment in pirates. And yet, so that games 40,

[01:25:27] thousand dollars and guns and roses is tanking in value. Get out of here. Get out of here. A pinball

[01:25:32] machine should be a five to 10 minute experience. I'm not for a galactic tank force.

[01:25:43] I don't even know if they have a lunchboxes. You know, they're selling, they're selling

[01:25:49] um galactic tanks. Um, they're selling the damn uh, like like like old paintings or something.

[01:26:00] Hmm. Okay, how are we doing? Are we doing good? Is everybody doing good? We're losing some people.

[01:26:07] We lose some people. Right. Best topper. Best topper. All right. Okay. So for this category,

[01:26:17] um, the toppers have to be from the manufacturers. Okay. None of this like no third party topper BS.

[01:26:27] Avatar topper was last year. Come on. These are the toppers.

[01:26:31] These are the toppers from 20, 25 that have been revealed. Okay. So the, I looked at all these.

[01:26:45] I looked at all these toppers. And these are all eligible. Jaws, Harry Potter, the Walking Dead,

[01:26:54] um, Kong, Evil Dead, Beetlejuice, Portal, Dune. Did you pre-order your Dune topper coming out August of

[01:27:06] 2026? Um, I just want to say like, okay. So like,

[01:27:23] can we, can we all just like for a minute? Just, can we just huddle here? How do we have like 176 people

[01:27:29] now? Like how do we just get like, can we look in the, in the lower left? Can we look at Star Wars

[01:27:36] topper? Like what a piece of, can I curse for a second? Are you guys okay? If I curse right now?

[01:27:43] Like, just tell me yes or no. Like I, I try to keep this pg if my kids hear this one day and I'm

[01:27:50] wearing a, you know, purple label, purple label Ralph Lauren talks, which I am right now.

[01:27:57] Um, purple label tie, you know, it's, it's just, look at that. Can we just look at that piece of

[01:28:06] shit in the lower left corner? Like who the hell at Stern Pimball? Like approve that? Look at that. Look

[01:28:18] how dumb that looks. See three POs head. Okay, decapitated, flanked by a bunch of what the

[01:28:32] fuck behind them? Like I don't, I'm sorry, like I don't normally curse, but like what is the,

[01:28:38] to me, Stern Pimball has become an organization and like, and then the LED light strip pointing at

[01:28:47] your face. Like in the end, like I mean this is like, this is, I know, spoiler, I just, I think I

[01:28:58] just gave away the winner. Hold on. Um, okay, I'm just gonna, okay. So I'm going back and forth.

[01:29:08] The winner is Beetlejuice.

[01:29:13] Because this topper is amazing, but I want to go back. I want to go back because I don't even know

[01:29:24] if I want to go back. I just feel like, you know this, like let's just, you know what, I want to,

[01:29:33] I do want to like, stand this for a second because I'm going to like really just blow this up.

[01:29:44] Like I just, I just want to look at this. I just want to look, I just want to look at this.

[01:29:49] Now, but like, like, like, like, let's, let's look at this. What, what, what is this?

[01:30:08] Like literally they've got their company logo on the ends of the LED strip.

[01:30:15] I know, like, guys, I'm not even drunk. I, you guys are like, here, here come, there's no drunker.

[01:30:22] But like, look at this. Guys, like, it's sitting on top and like, I don't know why I hold on. Hold on.

[01:30:29] Let me get rid of it.

[01:30:30] No, I mean, I mean this when I say it, like, I'm not trying to be like, I'm just, I'm just,

[01:30:50] how do you have a company? And I mean this, like, this is the, this is like one of the biggest

[01:30:56] IPs in the world. How do you have a company that, like puts this, it's weird that I found this image

[01:31:08] because that's not even the new Star Wars back glass, right? Like, that's the old one. Like, I,

[01:31:14] I guess they, that's not the new one, right? That's the old Star Wars game.

[01:31:18] I, I just, I worry, I worry about Stern because they've got so many people there, like hundreds of people.

[01:31:30] And nobody walked by this topper and was like, like, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

[01:31:38] what is this? Like, what's, I don't understand, like, what's behind them?

[01:31:43] I, it's backwards compatible.

[01:31:53] Okay, I'm just saying, like, Stern, like, you need to get, get it together. Like, okay,

[01:32:00] let's, let's go on because I said, it's going to be a positive show and it'll be a positive show.

[01:32:05] And all right, so, just wins. Okay, best reveal, best reveal.

[01:32:10] This is not going to turn into some drunk and ranch show. Don't worry people. Don't worry.

[01:32:15] Canadian haters, you're not going to, you're not going to be able to like, take this footage and get

[01:32:19] me fired. I, I get it. I get what you guys are trying to do. All right, so best reveal. Okay, so

[01:32:27] this is a, this is like a marketing moment. This is, this takes into consideration.

[01:32:33] How did you reveal your game? Timing, content.

[01:32:45] What did it create at launch? Right. Like, what was the sequence of things?

[01:32:52] As a marketer, this is what I do for a living. I'm very,

[01:32:56] invested, if you will, in this kind of category. This doesn't, this was never a

[01:33:01] twippy category. Marketing doesn't matter to most pinball companies. But this is a thing that I

[01:33:07] think deserves to be recognized. So Winchester, Beetlejuice, people are saying, you know,

[01:33:17] I will say this, the, the, the, a reveal. And it's, it's not, you know, it's not always how much

[01:33:27] money you spend. I mean, it, the best reveal in pinball to me is like, you created a moment.

[01:33:42] You know, you created a moment, you created excitement, you created like,

[01:33:49] it like extreme demand on the day your order banks open. I think that's probably

[01:33:57] the best indication of a great reveal. Like, which one of these games

[01:34:04] created extreme demand through its reveals like strategy that made

[01:34:13] demand just incredible. I want to ask you guys, like, what was your favorite? Who do you think had

[01:34:23] the best pinball reveal in 2025? Let me, let me read what you guys say first. And I was going to

[01:34:31] keep drinking these Manhattan's and then tell you guys what's sorry. The hedgehog looks like

[01:34:37] Winchester. Okay. Beetlejuice Winchester Winchester.

[01:34:44] Any more guesses? Come on, guys.

[01:35:05] Harry Potter. Rob's video. Predator. The guy says predator. Come on, man. Like,

[01:35:14] you know,

[01:35:16] and Merlin's arcade for right or a cause. Cause is like, cause knows how to troll the right way.

[01:35:24] Yeah, like, you guys, okay, so.

[01:35:32] Okay. Yeah, I mean, I think you guys are like, you guys are kind of right where my head was at.

[01:35:40] I think there's two games here that had the best reveal for different reasons.

[01:35:50] But, you know, there can only be one Canadian Kuda winner. And,

[01:35:55] you know, I struggle with this one. And I do. Because, you know, I hear if I'm reading the comments

[01:36:14] right, I see a lot of Beetlejuice and Winchester, right? And I see a lot of the secrecy of Winchester.

[01:36:25] The walking dead wasn't on the list. I see a lot of, you know, the unexpected nature of Winchester

[01:36:33] and how coming out of nowhere, right, led to a two-day sellout.

[01:36:38] I'm amazing. You know, it's absolutely amazing what David Vennes and his team achieved with that

[01:36:48] secrecy. Had I known that it was Winchester? I had club members who knew the theme that didn't tell me.

[01:36:56] You know, Harry Potter, I want to say this, like Harry Potter had great launch, right?

[01:37:04] Like Retro Ralph did great video vignette on the game, you know, what's in it, like all the details,

[01:37:16] only issue was he left the keys. You got to go back and watch the video. He left the keys in the back box.

[01:37:23] Something, something only can be to all, let you know about right now, pretty drunk on Manhattan's.

[01:37:29] He left the keys in the back box. Go look at the video. The keys are in the back box. I love

[01:37:33] Ralph. Ralph does great videos. Think about like Potter is like like Jersey Jack is just,

[01:37:43] you know, they're known for these like a labyrinth launch videos, but like Potter's launch,

[01:37:47] it didn't blow us away. And the thing about Potter launch was this is right after it launched,

[01:37:56] what happened? What happened? The entire conversation was around the AI art debacle.

[01:38:06] So that's why like, that's kind of what killed the Potter launch for me was the AI issue. Like,

[01:38:14] wait, they didn't even realize like their own artist, like turn this game over

[01:38:21] to AI filtering and then they like, seriously, like the first games had the issue like,

[01:38:30] okay, and that became the big issue.

[01:38:38] So the winner for Best Reveal. And I'm going to give it away when I say this.

[01:38:46] But this company has sort of carved out a reveal moment of the year that they own.

[01:39:00] Like, when you think about it, like, there's no other pinball company that is absolutely now owns

[01:39:08] an entire like portion of the year that like everyone's just waiting for their game.

[01:39:19] And then when they do reveal it, they do it in a way that is so personal and so intimate

[01:39:29] that you don't even need the expensive flashy videos.

[01:39:39] And I think that to me is what speaks volumes. And so the winner for Best Reveal

[01:39:48] go to Beto Juice. Okay. And I want to say this like, because Winchester gang, like Winchester,

[01:40:00] in my honest opinion, wasn't even like revealed. It was just dropped.

[01:40:09] It was just dropped. Like, and they had no idea whether or not I was going to be like a success

[01:40:17] or failure. But to me, Buggin Luke's Beto Juice reveal with the Zach video was absolutely,

[01:40:29] they had the whole like teaser Beto Juice, Beto Juice, Beto Juice, they nailed it. And this

[01:40:37] game like sold out before it was even available. So Don had his midnight release party.

[01:40:49] No, that's my thing is like like gang, gang, listen to me. As a marketer, Winchester didn't even have

[01:40:58] like a reveal strategy. They just dropped it out of nowhere. And it worked. Right? It worked. But

[01:41:08] that, but like, that's not a full reveal strategy. Okay. HP one hand down. We have some Harry Potter

[01:41:20] fans in the house. Wait. Okay. So John, you think that Winchester should have won? I want to

[01:41:34] read your guys comments because look, here's the good news. Here's the good news. You want to know

[01:41:39] what the good news is that Harry Potter, well, not Harry, I can't say this about Harry Potter,

[01:41:47] but here's the good news that Beto Juice and Winchester sold out within a day or two.

[01:41:56] And, and I would say this, both of them did it right. You know what I'm saying? As a marketer,

[01:42:04] I would not walk in to barrels of funds office and say, Hey, you should have done this differently.

[01:42:10] Nope. You nailed it. Spooky with Beto Juice. You nailed it. And that is something to be said. Right?

[01:42:20] I mean, Beto Juice was kind of sold out before it was even revealed. Winchester, we didn't know about

[01:42:26] sold out within two days. They're both absolutely crushing it with reveals. And I think if we're all

[01:42:36] honest amongst thieves here right now, all the excitement about new game reveals is happening now

[01:42:44] in unique spaces, right? It's happening with barrels, it's happening with spooky, it's happening,

[01:42:50] you know, with like the boutique companies of the world, like it's like

[01:42:55] and Stern has a new game coming out in just a few weeks and nobody cares.

[01:43:00] Like it's, it's, to me, like that's the big shift happening in pinball is the boutique reveals

[01:43:07] Jjp's sonic baby. Like I wish you could see I'm not going to say anything more, but like sonic is

[01:43:16] going to crush it's a goat. It's a goat kind of game. Okay. Okay. So I want to say this best reveal

[01:43:26] goes to spooky for Beto Juice. Everything they did to launch that game, the personal connection to it

[01:43:33] and a very, very strong second honorable mention. You know, I would say first to retro valves,

[01:43:41] Harry Potter content. And then you know, like barrels got real lucky with the surprise, but that

[01:43:47] was never the strategy. You got it. What's rigged? What is rigged? Gray balls. I want to,

[01:43:58] I want to call you out. What's rigged? Look at this, look at this great AI art I've done here

[01:44:06] with bugging Luke being held up in Gothic frames by an animated Beetle juice. You think this is

[01:44:12] easy? I spent all day making this. Collins not going to do anything. He's just going to have a

[01:44:18] crappy voting system and then do a podcast to announce the winners. All right. Let's go. Let's go.

[01:44:25] Let's go on. All right. So like, all right. So here's the deal. Here's the deal. Here's the deal.

[01:44:32] Here's the, here's the, here's the, here's the lowdown.

[01:44:35] He says the spooky gives for your kids made them win. Oh my God. I mean,

[01:44:47] the, the sparkle smash puzzle. Okay. So most collectible. Here this, this, this is a category that

[01:44:58] should be a category moving forward. What game that was revealed in 2025? Do you think

[01:45:12] will hold the most value in the future? That, that is it. There, there is no other like, like,

[01:45:20] you bought a game for this and it is collectible because more people will want it

[01:45:29] than they will ever be supply. I want to hear your answers. Winchester. What, what, what?

[01:45:39] Winchester. Okay. Evil dead. Okay.

[01:45:50] Winchester. Okay. Winchester all day. Spinal spinal. You know, not a five, not a four pinball

[01:46:00] sign. Like, come on, Zine or whatever. Come on. Tell me. What do you think? What do you,

[01:46:07] a year from now, a year from now, when we're doing this show next year, what do you think, which

[01:46:13] game do you think will have the most value? Just keep, keep, keep, keep it coming people because I'm

[01:46:23] going to keep it drinking them in Addens. Just 50. I'm going to let you guys answer a few more times.

[01:46:53] All right. So, like, this one's tough, right? And of course, I was, Scotty. Let me give you my ration

[01:47:09] out for the winner here. And I was torn here. I was torn like a lot of you guys. Winchester,

[01:47:17] Beetlejuice, right? It's like, what would 999 Beetlejuices 80 show games, which I hate. I hate. Can

[01:47:28] I go on a rant for a little bit? I think, I think Bug and Luke's decision to make 80 show games

[01:47:38] is garbage. And I've said it before. I'll say it again. 80 show games is a cop out greedy move that

[01:47:51] should never happen again. What is that? 80 show games. Like, I don't, you're making what? How many?

[01:48:00] How many of the making? And then you're making show games. So what? Like, you could just like

[01:48:11] arbitrarily determine the amount of show games you make based on the demand to appease your dealers

[01:48:20] who are crying because they have customers who can't get it. It's garbage. And then gang, gang.

[01:48:30] Have you ever, like, have you ever seen another pinball company make show games?

[01:48:40] Like, just, just tell me, tell me, has it ever made a show game of an Ellie?

[01:48:45] It's for people to play them. Who cares? Okay. Well, look, they're never doing it again. Here's a deal.

[01:49:08] Luke has said they're never doing it again. You know why he's never doing it again? Because he knows

[01:49:15] it's BS. Okay. But here's the simple facts about this category. And it's, okay. I don't even

[01:49:28] know it. I don't even need this slide. Like, you know, I, I've, I've been struggling with this one

[01:49:38] for a while. And I'll tell you why. Because there's two things that play here. There's IP popularity

[01:49:48] and then there's units, right? And I'm just going to be honest. This is obviously between Winchester

[01:49:56] and Beetlejuice. Right? So five 25 Winchester's and eight. No, was it nine, nine, nine, nine,

[01:50:07] Beetlejuice? Right? Okay. So in the end, I'm just, it's, this was a hard one for me.

[01:50:23] Because as of today, as of today, neither game is up for sale on the second hand market. Right?

[01:50:34] Neither game. You can't find, you can't find either game. Um, Beetlejuices have been selling a few of

[01:50:43] them second hand for four, five thousand over sticker. But I just want to say this. Like in the end,

[01:50:50] what will ultimately happen is this. The IP will win. The IP will win. And in, in a world where there's

[01:51:00] like millions of fans, the, the ultimate better collectible in the long run. I'm just talking to

[01:51:12] the long run is going to be Beetlejuice. It's just going to be Beetlejuice. Like I, I, I, I, I think

[01:51:21] what's going to happen. And, and this is just Canada is I think when people get Winchester and they

[01:51:31] you know, they're, they're just not gonna like, you know, it's just not going to have that cultural

[01:51:44] like connection and, and, and you know, again, you, people have seen so little on it.

[01:51:52] But Beetlejuices, Beetlejuices and IP that's lasted like 30 years in culture.

[01:52:05] So Cliff, why do you think Beetlejuice is going to be riddled with problems?

[01:52:14] Like, I, I love the comments. I think Beetlejuice is going to be riddled with problems.

[01:52:22] No, in the end, you know, theme is going to win out. There are millions. There are millions of

[01:52:32] Beetlejuice fans. If I told you guys Winchester six months ago, you wouldn't have cared.

[01:52:40] That's all I'm saying. Like, I think Winchester is going to do just fine. I think Winchester is

[01:52:44] going to hold value. But I think in the end, Beetlejuices are going to be unobtainium for, for, for,

[01:52:50] for people. I do. I do. I think if I had to put, and they're, they're around the same price,

[01:52:58] like 11, 12,000 down on Winchester or Beetlejuice, I think the Beetlejuices are going to hold value

[01:53:06] more because I don't think that Beetlejuice people are going to sell their games. I think the

[01:53:09] Winchester people are going to get them, going to get tired of walking through the house,

[01:53:18] and they're going to get rid of them. Retro Ralph, you son of a bitch. It's the real Retro Ralph.

[01:53:25] Happy New Year's. Great show. Oh, man. Ralph, this is for 10 months of my Canadian club membership.

[01:53:33] Ralph, I love you, brother. Ralph, you know, I, I just want to say, like, thank you, man. Like,

[01:53:43] you, you bring a level of energy. Can we, can we all, like, everyone watching right now, can we all

[01:53:49] give a, a hard supper, a clap to Retro Ralph? Because I will say, like, I, I, I need a Retro Ralph

[01:53:57] in my life. Like, we all need Retro Ralph in our life. Like, this guy's positivity is optimism,

[01:54:06] his, like, he's so good for this hobby. He's so good. And like, it was wrong of me to indict him

[01:54:15] for collecting arcade one-opt. So we're all just the same nerds in the same space. Like, Ralph,

[01:54:21] I love you, brother. I'm glad you're here. And, you know, you have done such a good thing for this

[01:54:28] hobby. And you make such good content. And, you know, on a production level, it's better than

[01:54:37] mine, of course. Like, I always say this to Franjo, like, literally making amazing production,

[01:54:44] like, I am the low-fi, like, jerk weed at the end of the park compared to these guys. He,

[01:54:53] he did leave the keys in the back box. It's funny. You know, you can't, Kale was the one who, like,

[01:54:57] told me that I didn't even notice it. Like, but I'll say this, like, all the content creators

[01:55:04] these days, we're at a point now where, like, I think everyone gets along. Like, Ralph,

[01:55:09] Don, me, Jenga's, like, Zach, like, there's no beef anywhere. All right. All right. So we keep going.

[01:55:19] All right. Let's do this. Let's do this. It's like, okay, best value. Okay. Let me ask you guys,

[01:55:25] was the best value in Pimble? We're gonna, we're gonna wrap this up soon because I know we've

[01:55:30] been going from this two hours. I mean, my, my Manhattan's now and like, now I'm getting worried.

[01:55:35] Like, people are going to contact HR. That's value. Kong Pro.

[01:55:42] This is the best value in Pimble. Jaws 50th.

[01:55:56] Hmm. Evil dead.

[01:56:10] Spooky Beetlejuice or evil dead. Okay.

[01:56:13] Okay.

[01:56:20] It's rigged. One man's favorites.

[01:56:26] This dude just like, this dude just realizing that all of this is one man's favorites.

[01:56:33] This whole thing is rigged, bro. It's Canadian's favorite stuff. Where you been?

[01:56:37] Let me, let me raise you my Dodge demon. Bring your Prius to Royden, Connecticut.

[01:56:51] The best value is playing on location. Electric bat arcade. Kale Hernandez.

[01:56:59] Kale Hernandez. Never heard of him. It's not exactly true. We were like brothers.

[01:57:10] Airplane the movie. Anybody get it? Come on. People.

[01:57:13] It's, it's, it's weirdly quiet up to them. I'm surprised. Brenna's not like, what are you doing?

[01:57:19] And you're purple. And you're

[01:59:29] all right. Did that work? Are we back? Are we back? Are we back? Are we back?

[01:59:42] I mean, you know what? There's no cell phones in rehab. Let me, let me tell you guys like, like,

[01:59:52] okay. So I figured out, right? Everyone's still here?

[01:59:58] Like, let me give you the best, the best song ever. Like, like, I don't know, like, maybe there are no, like,

[02:00:09] cell phones or rehabs.

[02:00:28] I want to come to the back.

[02:00:30] Because it's going to last like, like, today, I went online. Apparently, a lot of people don't like me.

[02:00:38] There's no cell phones in rehab. And that's where I'm going. So come find me.

[02:00:43] Okay.

[02:00:43] I'm a disaster created. I'm not. Okay. I'm a cross-step. I'm trying to get. Okay.

[02:00:48] I can help you just say even the out. Okay.

[02:00:51] All right. All right. I'm a back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back. We're back.

[02:00:56] Okay. Okay. Okay. Best value. Best value. Let's just do this.

[02:01:03] All right. So out of all these games, I got to say,

[02:01:17] the best value.

[02:01:19] You know, when I thought about this, I thought about,

[02:01:27] what do you get for the money? You know, what do you get? You get all the assets,

[02:01:32] you get all the max, you get all the, you guys are talking pros, like,

[02:01:39] I'm like, pros are for hose. I'm like, I don't, you know, I,

[02:01:44] I'm just like, you know, the winner here,

[02:01:59] the reason why I picked Harry Potter for 10 grand, you get everything.

[02:02:07] I mean, this is like, this game is the Harry Potter arcade edition.

[02:02:16] You don't even, you don't lose any mechs. You don't lose any code. You don't lose any art. Even like,

[02:02:23] it's kind of incredible. And I know for a fact that when Jersey Jack launched this game,

[02:02:30] there was a emergency meeting at Stern. Like, what are they, what are they doing?

[02:02:45] Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you guys hear me?

[02:02:57] All right. I'm gonna say, I'm gonna plug your mic again.

[02:03:01] All right. You guys are all here. Look, I, I don't think that like,

[02:03:19] I don't, I don't know, man, like, I'll tell you why not, Peter, just like,

[02:03:24] I don't know, maybe it should be Bill, just keep going. All right. This, this is, this is a good one.

[02:03:37] This is the kind of category where like, who, who has these categories?

[02:03:46] Like, who's got bet, most improved Pimbao company? Like, this is what we should celebrate. Like,

[02:03:53] companies that are getting better, that are like doing things differently. So, let me ask you guys.

[02:04:05] Oh, shit. I'm not like, my, my, my, my computers about to die. Hold on. How much?

[02:04:13] I'm like, I got 8% hold on, hold on. I need, I need to charge this. But tell me who you think

[02:04:20] is the most improved company.

[02:04:50] Oh, it's so beautiful. Can I ask back? He's back. We'll go here. Go around the GP.

[02:05:08] All right. What, what we got here?

[02:05:10] Most improved companies.

[02:05:28] Okay. A lot of, a lot of interesting.

[02:05:31] I think most improved.

[02:05:41] You know, when I thought about this one, most improved, it came down to a few factors.

[02:05:52] And it was like a company that, you know, was making decisions and,

[02:06:01] and then all of a sudden they did something that like, like, absolutely in 2025, like,

[02:06:09] like, gave them the juice, like, gave them the mojo and like, like,

[02:06:16] they made a decision that was just like, unexpected and just like worked out. And then,

[02:06:26] I, I think they've, you know, they've, they've got the elements.

[02:06:32] They've got the elements.

[02:06:39] This goes to, now, and I, I think the most improved company to me goes to barrels.

[02:06:50] And, and, and the reason I say this, and, and I mean this is,

[02:06:55] this Winchester launch,

[02:07:06] we have to recognize that this company went from,

[02:07:16] like, unable to sell, uh, thousand dunes to selling 525 games in two days.

[02:07:26] And so they're, they're now in a position of extreme

[02:07:33] opportunity. And now they have to see it through.

[02:07:40] And I do think they're the most like

[02:07:45] improved. I do. I like, in the end, like,

[02:07:49] like, again, I went back and forth between barrels and spooky,

[02:07:54] because spooky, you know, and, you know, with all their improvements from evil dead and

[02:07:59] beetle juice. But in the end, for me, barrels are fun.

[02:08:06] They had the best, like, like, turnaround. They, they just did. Like, evil dead sold out

[02:08:14] kind of quickly. But barrels, like, this game, and if they can execute this properly,

[02:08:23] and the mechs in both dune and the asses in dune, like, to me, dune and Winchester to me are

[02:08:31] indicative of a company that's right on the precipice of, of amazing stuff. I mean this,

[02:08:43] and, and they just need to, like, put it all together now. All right. All right. Keep going.

[02:08:51] This one was hard. This one was hard. So best artwork.

[02:08:57] Best artwork. So I'm going to say this right now. This is,

[02:09:04] this is like, this is the only time I've ever struggled for hours.

[02:09:18] And I'm going to drink more men had in and I'm going to, I'm going to absolutely

[02:09:26] own this one.

[02:09:34] I

[02:09:44] want to know how you guys feel. So like, this is hard, man. Like, it's worth,

[02:09:49] you know, this is the problem now, is we are now in a period where Pimble Art is just insane.

[02:09:56] This is like, this is, you know, this is, this is not your, this is not your CSI dragon drop crap.

[02:10:14] And you know, when I think about this, I, you know, I, so what do you guys think? Like,

[02:10:38] let me ask you guys because I, I literally, you know, it's not going to be Star Wars.

[02:10:44] And, you know, I, I want to say one of my most, um, revealing moments of the year was when

[02:10:54] Zombie Eddie hit me up at like, like, almost one in the morning and said, I was like the reason

[02:11:02] why he hated working in Pimble and I was destroying his family. And I, um, I want to say to Jeremy

[02:11:14] Packer, I still love you. And you shouldn't blame me for your family woes and, um, maybe just don't

[02:11:23] make King Kong look like that. Look at that. Look at, look at King Kong there. What, what is that?

[02:11:32] It's like, it's like, I don't even know like if his head is proportionate to his chest, like,

[02:11:40] it's the whole thing is just looks like a comic book for my kid.

[02:11:45] No, hold the line, stay positive. Okay. Okay. So here's my thing with best artwork. Okay. And, um,

[02:12:01] um, and I, I will say that we are now in a period where this category is as contentious and as,

[02:12:17] you know, competitive as it used to be for like best Pimble podcast. Like this is, this is hard.

[02:12:29] Like this is really hard because there are like, there are so many stunning games that I can't even,

[02:12:43] David Vines is joining now. Two hours and 15 minutes after the show started. David,

[02:12:51] you've already missed many June wins tonight. You have to go back and rewatch.

[02:12:59] But you had a very good showing tonight. Um, here's,

[02:13:06] here's the reality of all these art packages. And, and I, I, I don't like to

[02:13:13] do this. And, you know, the reason why I say there's a tie and I, and I, and I, and I,

[02:13:26] and I, I will hopefully never do this again is I think there is a, there are two art packages

[02:13:38] that just cemented for me a, a new sort of foundation, if you will, for what an artistic

[02:14:00] Pimble machine can look like. And, and I mean this like when you walk into a room and I think

[02:14:09] about art, I think about just walking into a room and seeing in art, t, t, I can even talk in

[02:14:19] artistic representation of a Pimble machine. And the tie here to me is, is, is, is warranted because

[02:14:29] one is more of the expected and one is more of the unexpected. And I think one just slams the theme

[02:14:44] into your face. And one is more like artistic like it's more like metaphorical. It's more,

[02:14:57] like simplistic. Okay, I'm just gonna, no, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna say this and like,

[02:15:11] it's not maybe doing. And like, I struggle with this because I get, I'm gonna be honest,

[02:15:19] I'm gonna be honest. I gave this to one game initially.

[02:15:27] Okay, no, like, no, this one was like really hard for me. And, and, and the reason why is like,

[02:15:43] I gave this to one game. And then I couldn't ignore the genius decision by another game to go in an artistic

[02:16:00] direction that led to 3000 orders. So, and I wanted to discuss the, I wanted to discuss with you guys

[02:16:15] when we get here. So, my, my winner tie for best artwork is,

[02:16:32] Evil Bed, which I think is a, a better game.

[02:16:37] I, I think Evil Bed is a nicer art package than Bill Jews. I just do it like, Bill just great.

[02:16:47] But I also just wanted to acknowledge that like the Nima Lima, like Harry Potter,

[02:16:58] Collector's Edition artwork is insane. Like, it's just like literally like,

[02:17:06] the fact that they went so radically different on the art, on the Harry Potter CE,

[02:17:13] gang, 3000 people ordered it. And, and, and I understand that there, there was the AI gate and

[02:17:22] the play field, but in the end, in the end, these two games to me were the two greatest artistic

[02:17:35] representations of Pimball in 2025. Like, they're both stunning. And like, I, I know,

[02:17:46] Beetlejuice is equally stunning. Like, I love Beetlejuice, but I, I, I, I think Evil Bed is better

[02:17:57] than Beetlejuice. I just do. I think it has more like, more pop. It just does. And I, I just want to

[02:18:05] know what you guys think of this. But, but the thing is this weighted voting, it's just me.

[02:18:15] I just, I couldn't, I couldn't award, Franchie, without awarding J.J. P's,

[02:18:34] Niemelie, why is it lame, Pimball Trey?

[02:18:51] Niemelie, my, my, my rationale for this is like,

[02:18:56] this, this J.J. P art, this J.J. P art sold 3000 units.

[02:19:16] Yeah, I don't like the J.J.P. Topper.

[02:19:19] Okay, let's move on. Let's move on. You guys are getting

[02:19:25] to see, man, damn, like, I, I, I, I, I like, I'm like, I'm nervous now. I think Evil Dead

[02:19:43] Art is better than Beetlejuice. Are you guys like, let's do this. All right.

[02:19:53] Oh, we, we've been going like, all right, we've been going like two and a half hours, all right.

[02:19:58] Okay, here we go. All right, let's go. Best layout designer. I'm sorry. Like, so all the designs

[02:20:07] in Pimball Dungeons and Dragons. We've got Star Wars. We've got wide bodies and Evil Dead

[02:20:16] and Predator. Got Dungeons and Dragons Star Wars. Wait, do we already, I just, wait, hold on.

[02:20:28] Oh, we got Harry Potter, King Kong and Dungeons. I mean, I feel like these are the three.

[02:20:43] All right. What do you think, guys? The best designer of the year.

[02:20:57] Who designed the best Pimball Machine of 2025?

[02:21:08] I keep dropping as Mike.

[02:21:31] Come on. Who's?

[02:21:33] Who's? You know, this was a one where I wasn't, you know, I've played all these games, you know,

[02:21:49] many times. And I know we're, we're getting towards the end. And I know like, thank you guys for

[02:22:04] praying on this lot. I will say this. The biggest threat to Stern Pimball is that the company that

[02:22:17] actually has the nicest platform and beautiful games would make games as fun and make the gameplay

[02:22:27] as enjoyable machine without a doubt the best designer and sorry for his AI image, but the best

[02:22:37] designer and the best game of the year's Harry Potter. And if you haven't played Harry Potter,

[02:22:45] this game is absolutely phenomenal. Like, I think Jag is laughing at the the Eric, but like,

[02:22:57] like, literally, this game is next level fun from a shooter standpoint. And like, Kong is a great

[02:23:09] shooter, but Harry Potter has more than like, when you put a Harry Potter next to a King Kong,

[02:23:17] it makes King Kong look like a tinkertoy. So I think Eric Minier has made his greatest

[02:23:27] shooting game ever on the biggest theme he's ever had. He looks like James Franco. Like, guys,

[02:23:37] this is all AI. Okay, let's keep going. Because like, I know you guys are like, the Pimball company

[02:23:45] in the air. Let's, let's keep going. Who do you think is the Pimball company in the air?

[02:23:54] I mean, I know where we've gone late. I'm a bunch of bad hat and Zinn. Ralph joined. He's

[02:24:01] hanging out. Like, people are going to watch this tomorrow and be like, what happened? I don't

[02:24:07] even know what happened. I don't even know what's up. I don't even care. Stranger things suck. The

[02:24:15] whole world's woke. The whole world's sad kids don't even want to, I don't know. Everyone's got to be.

[02:24:32] The janitors remark at Pimball. Because what the okay, so like, when I think about the Pimball

[02:24:41] company in the air and I mean this when I say this. So, you know, I talk a lot about on my podcast

[02:24:48] for those of you who have not joined. I don't even say now. Now we have like 176, all of a sudden,

[02:24:54] we have like the most viewers now right now that we've ever had.

[02:25:02] To me, the Pimball company in the year is the Pimball company that is in it. Like, they're just

[02:25:09] in it. Like they're building their brand with their people that makes me feel good and the

[02:25:17] community feel good about buying a product from them. And I, and I mean this when I say this,

[02:25:28] when you listen to Stern Pimball lately, which is the biggest Pimball company in the world,

[02:25:36] and they get interviewed, what do you hear? Oh, we couldn't do this because of licensed

[02:25:43] or approval. Oh, you know, all these excuses. Oh, John Borg only had eight months to make Star Wars.

[02:25:50] It's like, shut up, shut up. Like, if John Borg only had eight months to make Star Wars,

[02:25:59] then why are you charging me $13,000 for the game? Have you noticed tonight? Have you noticed

[02:26:09] something? Stern Pimball hasn't won a single award and spoiler alert, they're not going to win

[02:26:19] any award tonight. And I would say that they don't deserve any award in any of the categories tonight.

[02:26:30] And this is the changing of the guard that I've been talking about. The biggest Pimball company in

[02:26:37] the world with the most people, the most resources has failed to make the best product.

[02:26:48] They failed to make the best brands. When I talk about Pimball Company the year,

[02:26:52] I'm talking about a Pimball company that has connected with the community that consistently,

[02:27:02] consistently, like, is a part of the people they're trying to sell to. And they talk to us on a

[02:27:13] daily basis. You know, and here's the best part about a company and its culture and the brand is

[02:27:24] there's no faking it. Like, it's either real or it's fake. And when it's real, it's authentic. And

[02:27:30] I just want to say that this company that is going to win this award has really shown me what

[02:27:45] and I'm sorry that I'm a loss for awards because I'm just thinking about my own experience with them.

[02:27:50] And I used to rail on these guys for a long time. I think this company has shown me what perseverance,

[02:27:58] what discipline, what listening to the community, what

[02:28:07] what passion is. And I think there's no other word than passion. And I think these guys

[02:28:14] have the most passion and the most desire to make the greatest Pimball machines moving forward

[02:28:22] right now. And it's because it's all they have. Like, you know, this is in their blood. Like, okay, so

[02:28:33] no, like, but, you know, my winner for Pimball Company of the Year goes to spooky. And when I think

[02:28:44] about this company, and I think about, you know, who they are and like, the cast they've assembled

[02:28:54] and the, and you know, it's hard for me to even talk about these guys in 2025 without

[02:29:04] remembering what they went through trying to sell America's most haunted because I was there.

[02:29:09] Like, there's a lot of, there's a lot of new Pimball people that don't remember what this

[02:29:15] company went through and the kinds of games they were making and the glue guns and the brick shots

[02:29:21] and to making beetle juice and to making evil dead and to now making games that are

[02:29:32] more in demand than games from Stern Pimball. Again, remember, like, this award show is honoring

[02:29:42] the best of last year and not a single award went to Stern Pimball. I mean, just stop and think

[02:29:52] about that. And I think any award show will have the same results. And I just want to say,

[02:30:01] like, for this company, that's now going to come out with goonies and gremlins.

[02:30:10] I mean, it's just like, for the next two years gang, we're going to have the same shit show to get

[02:30:18] a gremlins and a goonies. So I just want to think this is where Pimball is going. It's like

[02:30:29] this really overly passionate family will beat the big corporation every day of the week.

[02:30:39] And I think this is what makes me so excited about Pimball is seeing folks like this,

[02:30:48] the folks over at barrels of fun, the folks at Dutch Pimball, all the boutique, you know,

[02:30:54] companies, Jersey Jack Pimball, by the way, which I still consider to be boutique.

[02:31:00] I know what Jersey Jack has coming gang. And it's like, it's bonkers, bro.

[02:31:05] The Abbas family is tight. They're bringing it. The spooky family is bringing it.

[02:31:12] Like, barrels family is bringing it. Stern is just like, they're stuck. They're stuck.

[02:31:20] So I just want to say congratulations to all the folks at spooky. I love you guys.

[02:31:26] And we're running late. All right. We're like, we're at the game of the year.

[02:31:34] I mean, I almost got this done in two hours. Look, it costs nobody anything.

[02:31:41] Who's still here? Where's Bar? All right, the game of the year. I mean, look,

[02:31:49] I, this is, this is an important award. Who made the best Pimball game in 2025?

[02:32:01] That's it. Like, like, throughout all the other categories, I want to ask you guys right now.

[02:32:13] In your mind, who made the best Pimball game of 2025?

[02:32:23] And I'm just going to read your answers.

[02:32:35] And he is there.

[02:32:42] Who just said Beetlejuice? Like, honestly, who, who's throwing Beetlejuice at?

[02:33:13] Any more votes?

[02:33:27] You know, I am.

[02:33:28] You know, I had a moment at at at Pimball Expo before, I don't know, Jake Danzig tried to

[02:33:50] get me kicked out like he did. He like brought over the cops and but I had a moment. I got to walk

[02:33:59] across all the machines and you know, Winchester, Evil Dead, Harry Potter, Star Wars, everything.

[02:34:10] I got to see everything.

[02:34:12] And there's a moment where I am, you know, I walked over one of the machines of last year.

[02:34:28] You know, I just, I just had this like feeling like, like, they just like nailed it. They just

[02:34:37] got it. Like they just like, again, you have to put things in perspective. Like, if you were to

[02:34:46] remove yourself from this equation and you were going to tell someone, what was the biggest

[02:34:55] and best Pimball machine they got launched in 2025? Like that to me, that's that's what this is about.

[02:35:04] Like, what was the greatest game of 2025 in the history of Pimball? What would you say?

[02:35:16] Like, you need to see this.

[02:35:18] I sound like an aid after my six beer. Okay, okay. So,

[02:35:36] you know, like, it's, you know, Jaws 50, it doesn't count. I'm sorry for you, Jaws 50, owners.

[02:35:55] And I know we're getting late. I'm going to end this with

[02:35:58] so my game of the year. And it's honestly well deserved. And the team that made the game

[02:36:18] should be very, you know, very excited because I think Jersey Jack Pimball, and it's hard for me

[02:36:24] because I know, I know it's coming. I know it's coming from this company.

[02:36:33] But Harry Potter Pimball is a monumental achievement in both theme, theme integration,

[02:36:45] design. And I think Eric Minier is one of the greats. And I think he knows it.

[02:36:54] And I think this game is going to be a game that just

[02:37:01] solidifies itself in Pimball history. And I keep saying this. Like, there, there's going to be a new

[02:37:10] reckoning where the modern Pimball collector is not going to want like all the garbage of the

[02:37:19] past. And they're going to want like Potter and Beetlejuice and Winchester and Dune. Like,

[02:37:25] they're going to want the new games in their collection. And they're not, they're not going to want

[02:37:29] the old stuff. And you know what was the most telltale sign for me in this whole award show?

[02:37:39] Stern Pimball didn't win a single award. Let me, let me stop and repeat that.

[02:37:46] Stern Pimball did not win a single kudo.

[02:37:54] And you know, I love George and I love Seth and I love my friends at Stern and Jack and

[02:38:00] but Stern Pimball, the biggest Pimball company in the world, did not win a single award.

[02:38:09] So, let me ask you guys right now before I go. Do you think there was any Stern Pimball game

[02:38:18] that should have won in award in any of these stories that we're going to, we're going to sub

[02:38:28] like did I get anything wrong? Should Stern have won anything in any of these categories?

[02:38:39] Because this is, to me, this is the new world order of Pimball.

[02:38:49] You think that Keith L. One should have won for King Kong? I don't know. I just don't think

[02:38:59] Kong is a better lay out than Potter. I think Kong is like, yeah, it's neither here nor there.

[02:39:17] I think Potter layouts way better. Why are people saying rush? I'm not even sure like what,

[02:39:26] what people as a genus are saying rush, but

[02:39:33] did you guys enjoy the Canadian kudos awards? Like I was, I really worked hard on the

[02:39:41] on the whole slide show today. Like I spent the whole day. I know that my videos are not as good

[02:39:50] as Ralph's and all that, but I just want to say I love this hobby. I love you guys.

[02:39:57] I really do feel that this hobby and this industry is at a crossroads. I think the boutique

[02:40:06] companies with the passion are going to crush it. I think the big guys are going to,

[02:40:14] they're going to struggle. And I know, you know, look, I've heard a lot about Pokemon recently.

[02:40:26] And, you know, I'm not hearing good things about Pokemon. I like, I, I,

[02:40:35] I've seen some stuff on Sonic. I'm just going to tell you right now,

[02:40:38] Sonic the Hedgehog is absolutely. It's just like, what do I do? What do I say? Like,

[02:40:46] Brad's going to be mad at me. Like I can't say much. Like J.J.P's momentum moving into 20,

[02:40:54] I have to say this like, get ready for the greatest Steve Richie pin of all time.

[02:41:01] That's all I'm going to say. Like get ready for it.

[02:41:08] I'm.

[02:41:13] All right. I just want, I want to read your questions. Okay. Here we go.

[02:41:25] I mean, like, I, so, so what I hear about Pokemon is bad people like,

[02:41:38] I'll tell you this. Okay. So, I'm not supposed to say this, but

[02:41:48] I've seen, should I say this? I don't know.

[02:42:08] Let me drink. I need some, I need some MGK because I'm like, I'm really struggling here because like,

[02:42:18] three.

[02:42:29] And you heard that?

[02:42:32] new

[02:42:54] Yeah, I must have to do this side that I tell them I can do it.

[02:43:01] All right, two things.

[02:43:09] The sonic cabinet is crazy.

[02:43:13] I've seen it.

[02:43:16] It's crazy.

[02:43:20] It's going to be a cabinet that...

[02:43:27] Even Ralph is like, man, man, canada.

[02:43:32] Canada.

[02:43:39] Here's the thing.

[02:43:49] It's a J.J.P. cabinet.

[02:44:04] Here's what I know about Pokemon.

[02:44:09] Everything I hear about Pokemon is underwhelming.

[02:44:16] I'm going to close this down.

[02:44:20] I mean, honestly, this guy's not...

[02:44:23] I am going to close down.

[02:44:25] So, everybody look.

[02:44:28] I appreciate you guys.

[02:44:30] I hope you guys enjoyed the whole canada kudos.

[02:44:35] Let's hang out tomorrow morning.

[02:44:40] I'm a little buzz.

[02:44:43] I'm going to be an appropriate, which makes me happy.

[02:44:47] I'll tell you this.

[02:44:50] If I were you, if I were you, I would grab...

[02:44:54] Listen to me.

[02:44:57] Grab a Winchester.

[02:45:01] Grab a Jaws 50th.

[02:45:04] Grab it.

[02:45:05] Seriously, don't be stupid.

[02:45:08] You got to think about this fact that...

[02:45:11] This is all they ever make of Jaws.

[02:45:15] It's like the 50th.

[02:45:18] That's it.

[02:45:23] Jaws is going to be popular for like 50 more years.

[02:45:28] So, don't be dumb.

[02:45:30] Just grab a Jaws 50th.

[02:45:32] Grab a Winchester.

[02:45:34] Grab a Beetlejuice if you can.

[02:45:38] All the Stern games are stupid.

[02:45:43] And then I would just like...

[02:45:49] Fly the Dublin, Ireland.

[02:45:56] Yeah.

[02:45:59] Let me end this with one final provocation.

[02:46:06] I would take any Pimbo money you have.

[02:46:12] Fly the Dublin, Ireland.

[02:46:16] March.

[02:46:17] Get there on March 12th.

[02:46:20] You know why?

[02:46:26] And get tickets for the pit for Michigan, Kelly.

[02:46:35] That's it.

[02:46:38] And I promise you your life will be 10 times better.

[02:46:48] I'm just loving the chat.

[02:46:51] I kind of need to get a Jaws 50th for my house.

[02:47:01] I'm just trying to figure it out.

[02:47:04] All right, everybody look.

[02:47:07] Congratulations to all the winners.

[02:47:12] Love you guys.

[02:47:16] If you're not a member of King's Pimbo podcast, like...

[02:47:21] Join.

[02:47:22] Come on.

[02:47:23] I'm just like...

[02:47:25] Just trying to figure it out.

[02:47:28] I'm just like...

[02:47:31] I'm just trying to figure it out.

[02:47:35] I'm just trying to figure it out.

[02:47:38] I want to share the winners again.

[02:47:41] I think this is like important.

[02:47:44] Like these are...

[02:47:47] There's a lot of people here that...

[02:47:51] You guys don't even know about.

[02:47:54] Like there's a lot of individuals...

[02:47:57] This is the future of Pimbo.

[02:48:00] And I mean this when I say this...

[02:48:03] There's not a single award given to Stern Pimbo.

[02:48:10] Like when you think about that,

[02:48:13] the biggest Pimbo company in the world...

[02:48:18] With four or five hundred employees...

[02:48:22] Hasn't done a single thing.

[02:48:30] To me that's everything.

[02:48:34] All right.

[02:48:35] And I know this is just one man's award show.

[02:48:41] All you rush guys.

[02:48:43] I would say what is rush being discussed in the chest?

[02:48:49] Guys, have a good night.

[02:48:52] I'll see you tomorrow on the Saturday morning's spectacular.

[02:48:57] Jack Danger's still the house.

[02:48:59] Later brother.
