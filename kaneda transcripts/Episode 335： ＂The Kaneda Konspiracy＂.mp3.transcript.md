[00:00] I can see clearly noasy rain is gone

[00:04] Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see

[00:06] Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see

[00:07] It's all one big conspiracy. It can't be true, canada.

[00:13] What do you do?

[00:14] And go into Jersey Jack and fallin' in love with a pinball machine?

[00:17] You're not allowed to do that?

[00:19] You have to be the negative Nancy of the pinball industry,

[00:22] And if you ever fallin' in love with a game,

[00:25] something's not right.

[00:26] There must be a conspiracy happening.

[00:29] I can't believe it was so funny. I went out today. It was a beautiful day in New York City. I'm driving the Dodge Demon.

[00:34] I'm just enjoying a wonderful, wonderful Saturday. I had so much fun yesterday at Jersey Jax.

[00:40] And then I open up Pinside and there's an entire thread dedicated to my trip to Jersey Jax Pimball

[00:47] in which people are thinking it's a conspiracy. We're all just colluding together to hype this machine.

[00:54] I'm gonna hype it and then I'm gonna dump it and sell it. Well, let me tell you something right now.

[00:58] And maybe this will finally, finally show you how I really feel about what I saw yesterday.

[01:05] As of five minutes ago, my Batman 66 super limited edition game, it's for sale.

[01:13] I've listed it for sale. Now look, I listed it at a high price and you can check it out.

[01:18] I think I put something like $25,000. Why not?

[01:21] People are paying $25,000 for big Lebowski games that are broken and Batman is 10 times better than that game.

[01:28] So we'll see. But here's the thing. If you are interested in a Batman 66 super limited edition,

[01:35] send me an email and we can talk. I think we can come to a fair price on this game.

[01:40] And the reason why I'm selling it, you know me. I have room for one machine.

[01:45] And I am getting without a doubt. As God is my witness, I will never go hungry again.

[01:52] And I also definitely have a Willy Wonka pinball machine in this bedroom within the next few months.

[01:59] That is happening. There is nothing that will ever not put that game in this apartment.

[02:05] All right. You didn't see the smile on Brenda's face. You didn't see the smile on my face.

[02:10] You didn't understand exactly what it was like to flip the machine because guess what?

[02:15] You haven't flipped it yet. But there was a moment yesterday.

[02:19] It was after I interviewed Jack. So there's going to be a podcast with Jack and Joe that I put up on Friday after the reveal.

[02:25] But there was a moment after that where I just went back into the room and played Wonka by myself for 30 minutes uninterrupted.

[02:33] I turn the lights off and I probably had the coolest and most fun pinball experience I've had.

[02:40] And maybe some of that of course was it was a brand new game. I knew I was one of the first people in the world playing Willy Wonka.

[02:47] But the light show, the animations, the toys, the shots. I love it. I absolutely love the game.

[02:56] And it's kind of strange to me that some people like just don't want me to be enthusiastic about this game.

[03:02] You know, it's the same people who don't want other people to enjoy Canadian pinball podcasts.

[03:07] Right. I mean, you know, that's the real conspiracy.

[03:10] If you want to point your fingers at a conspiracy, I'll tell you where to point it.

[03:14] All right. Did you see the percentages of votes that all the different Twippy winners got right? Go look at that.

[03:21] Why do you think? Okay. Why do you think that that that we were told how much each game won by.

[03:28] But when they got to the categories of the right ends, they didn't tell us the percentage wins for the right end categories.

[03:35] Why do you think that was? I'll tell you why it was because they didn't want people to see that Canadian pinball podcasts probably won by.

[03:44] A landslide that the show you love the show you love they didn't give you the satisfaction of of seeing how much we won.

[03:53] They're probably they were worried that we would discourage other pinball podcasters from quitting, which is stupid, which is stupid.

[04:00] But look at that's a conspiracy. Why can't we see the results of the writing categories on the Twippy?

[04:07] So if you conspiracy theorists want to go on it on a little bit of a battle, go after that.

[04:12] And let's see the actual results. Why can't everyone see how they finished in the test? Right? Come on. Anyway, I don't really care.

[04:18] I don't love the Twippies. I love you, Jeff. It means it doesn't mean much, but I would just like to see the margin of victory. Anyway, here's the deal.

[04:25] I need to do I need to do a little correction first because I was so excited yesterday.

[04:30] I didn't even get the right information. You know, it wouldn't be Canadian pinball podcasts unless we got some information wrong.

[04:36] And so Keith is not coding Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka is being coded by Joe Kats. Okay. So that is who's coding Willy Wonka.

[04:46] All right. Now I know Keith also helps out with these games. I mean Jersey Jack is like a smaller team. Everyone's got their hands in on stuff.

[04:53] Now, how do I feel 24 hours later after playing Willy Wonka? I want to share some of my thoughts. I want to share some of your emails to me.

[05:04] And then I'm going to call it a day, but I just want to say there was no conspiracy. I'll tell you how this really went down and it wasn't some big master plan.

[05:12] After I roasted Jack for the terrible seminar that they did at T. P. F. the Yellowbrook Road reveal the next day I went up to him with Bill Brandis and Bill was talking to him and Bill just said, hey, Jack, like you should listen to this guy.

[05:28] Like he kind of knows a thing or two about marketing and Jack and I were talking and Jack knows me. I'd been over to Jersey Jack pinball once before.

[05:35] And you know, Jack doesn't get lost in the world of pinside. He doesn't get lost in the world of pinball podcast drama. He doesn't care. He's busy.

[05:44] He's busy building pinball machines. And I just said, you know, it would be great to come by, you know, if I could and talk to you and see what you guys are working on and maybe give you some tips.

[05:55] And that was it. That was it. And then a few days later, I got an email from Jersey Jack and he said, hey, Chris, how'd you like to come by and you threw out a date?

[06:03] And like, that sounds great. And then he says, wait a minute. I'm going to be in France. So how about this date? And then we're like, cool, I'll come by. And that was it. It was completely innocuous.

[06:14] There was no plan of like, Jack, let me come over and let me like falsely hype the game. And I think some of you have said this and this and this is the truth.

[06:22] All right. This is the truth. I don't show games. I don't like every pinball machine. If I liked every single pinball machine, my glowing review of Willy Wonka wouldn't really mean much because I'm not giving every single pinball machine a B plus or a.

[06:39] I'm not saying every company is great. I'm not saying and every pinball game is great. In fact, I've said pretty much the opposite.

[06:46] But I'm filled with such joy and elation over the last 48 hours. And I'll tell you why the whole reason that I've always been a little bit of a cranky Chris on this show is I have not been happy with the majority of pinball machines that have come out in the last five years or 10 years.

[07:04] And I don't think you are either. And here's the way I look at it. Are there a lot of fun pinball machines that have come out? Yes. Are you getting your money's worth for those pinball machines? Absolutely not. I think the majority of you out there who have kept buying these premium and Ellie machines from you know who for the most part you're paying way more than is going into these games.

[07:29] And you but you don't really have other options. So I can't really blame you because you love pinball so much but you really haven't had the ability to put your money elsewhere.

[07:40] And I understand why a lot of you have also not bought the offerings from Jersey Jack pinball up to this day because I haven't bought any Jersey Jack games and none of them have spoken to me the way Willy Wonka did.

[07:54] So the years go on and you sort of develop you develop into the kind of pinball creature that Stern wants you to develop into in which you actually stop thinking about how much you're spending every few months on these games 9000 or 7500 bucks.

[08:14] You know you Stern pro guys are a little bit different you sort of you sort of figured it out a while ago that almost every single Stern machine is worth close sort of 5000 and it is to 9000 and you're sort of getting the game at the right price point and Stern Ali's and Stern premiums that's where the gravy train is that's where they're just making you know duck it's and duck it's of money.

[08:39] But the games aren't worth it and you know it you know that to be the case but you want a good pinball experience so you haven't had many options and I think Stern has sort of a condition so many of us and so many of you to not really think about it that you sort of just keep going in on it you know you get really excited about a game then you see the game and it's like there's no real other games available that are new and so you want to buy the game.

[09:08] And you want to unbox the game and you want to play the game and the games are fun I'm not saying the Stern games are not fun but there's a big difference between getting a game for $6000 and then a game that's 9000 dollars because there's a lot of stuff you can put in that game for that additional amount of money that's just not making it into the game and the Stern prices have just kept going up and up and up and yet the innovation and the quality and the material.

[09:38] So the reals keeps going down down and down and and and instead of saying we're not going to take it anymore you really just kept taking it and so that is what I think is is about to happen when you see the game on Friday I think you're going to just see the new bar the new standard for what a premium pinball machine should be and I also think you're going to see some pricing options that are really going to call into question you know whether or not you really should keep going in on.

[10:08] A Stern premium and it's it's going to be very eye opening right and I saw this in the thread and it is funny because you know someone said it's going to be Willy Wonka versus the black night well I'm here to tell you I mean we've seen the black night I've seen Willy Wonka a guy wearing a purple tuxedo with a silly top hat a bow tie on and a walking stick is about to slay the black night and is sort of rage it's going to be kind of funny little dandelion.

[10:38] So the old Willy Wonka is just going to tumble forward come up and just chop the black night and half no look I think some of you out there I saw people posting like I'm not here saying the black night is a bad pinball machine by any means I'm not saying that at all haven't played it I can't give my opinion about the black night machine you saw my black night or you heard my black night podcast it was very positive I think it's a cool mechanism in the middle but I can't I can't look at these games anymore I have to be honest I can't look at the game.

[11:08] I can't look at Stern games anymore and see $9,000 and see $7,500 no more I mean after that mechanism in the middle of the Stern game tell me what else is in that game that shows like a lot of innovation or thought right and I'm glad you guys are finally realizing something when you look around that game black night and you see all of the exposed like nuts and screws look at it it's just plastic it's art on plastic with nuts and screws everywhere we're not going to be able to do it.

[11:38] We're not saying detailed sculpts we're not seeing like the world here's a good example the mission in the game is to attack the black night and destroy his castle on top of the hill all right let me ask you a question for those of you we're looking at that game where's the black night's castle where's the sculpted castle that is up on top of the hill where is it is there any sculpting is there any is there anything that's like 3D anything mold it all right now you're the $9,000 game and you probably know that you're going to get a lot of money.

[12:08] Pretty much as much of a mechanism where one side is spinning and one side is going up and down I mean come on it's cool but not the most innovative and then where else is like the sculpting and where else is the world coming alive in that game you know where where it's it's just now go look at house Cooper's nightmare castle look at the entire castle that Chuck put into the game I mean he's trying he's trying to give you that world under glass I know it sounds cliched and you're going to see a world under glass that is so freaking cool.

[12:38] Come Friday and that's where I think we're at and that's why I'm so excited I mean look you know there are people who haven't heard this podcast very often there are people who haven't heard me talk about what I'm looking for in pinball and I think I could

[12:53] summarize all 335 episodes of Canadian pinball podcasts very simply like this I think most modern pinball games have not been very good I think they have been

[13:04] reliant reliant on LCD technology I think the world under glass has not been there in most of these games I think a lot of it is hiding underneath artwork and plastic but the 3D sculpted world and the mechanical engineered world that we all want to see I think the only game that I've seen that really brought that to life in the best possible way was the big Lebowski it's a reason why so many of you love that game and we all know the disaster that was Dutch pinball so again like ask yourself

[13:34] in the last like 7 years 10 years which game has physically brought the world of that universe to life under the glass in an amazing way in an amazing fashion and again it's like if you stop asking that question and sure you can really start to enjoy the the offerings you've had from these companies but it's been few and far between of great games of great of games that

[14:00] remind us of the games that we love from back in the 90s and that's where we're at and I don't think any game has really achieved what you're about to see Friday and that's why I'm excited and that's why I bought it it's the game that I've been waiting for I don't give a shit if

[14:15] tournament players like this game or not I don't care if they don't like some of the randomness of the toys I don't care I think tournament players are the last people that that really should chime in on a world

[14:27] in their glass they don't care about a world in their glass they don't they're not looking when they're in a tournament the last thing they're trying to do is have fun with the game they all they want to do is score high you could just have one

[14:40] target that's moving back and forth quickly on the game and you just have to hit the target to score some points and they would just do that they would do whatever is

[14:48] competitively in front of them to win the tournament that's what's most important to them and I think too many I'm going to say this too many

[14:56] tournament players of high skill set have been involved in designing the modern pinball machines that all of us have been offered and I'll tell you what that's led to

[15:07] extremely tight and frustrating and clunky shots that don't make shooting the game fun because you have to be so goddamn good at pinball to hit those shots consistently I know I love it's like play better play better the shots are makeable the shots are makeable but look

[15:23] besides the point you know of of of tournament players and collectors

[15:28] can't we just I think this is going to be a game that unites more of us than divides us and I think that's what I'm most excited about is so much of what we talk about on a daily basis on

[15:39] pinside and so much of what the conversation is is what divides us and what we don't like about these games and each other and what not but every once in a while a game is going to come out like this that I think

[15:54] universally people fall in love with and I think what's going to happen is you're going to start to see a lot of people realize you know it's just it's just what

[16:03] pinball should be it's just got the magic of pinball and and people are going to buy it and they're going to enjoy it and they're going to talk about playing it they're going to talk about the fun mods they could put into it they're going to talk about you know what might come later on in the

[16:20] code they're going to talk about all the positives of the game it's not going to be like where are the assets it's not going to be like I wish the art was

[16:29] better it's not going to be like I wish there were more toys it's not going to be like I wish the shots were better it's not going to be any of that you really are

[16:37] going to have a hard time finding something to bitch about in this game and then if you do find something to bitch about in this game I'm telling you you're just going to look like a bitch because it's just that good and we don't want to hear it we don't want

[16:51] to hear it now there are those contrarian personalities on pinside that are probably already to go on what they're going to find a fault in this game but I'm telling you you put this game next to highway pinball's

[17:04] alien it's like give me a break you put it even next to big Lebowski this it's just another level you put it next to any stern it's just another level you know in a way it feels

[17:15] like it feels like the next level of Jersey Jack to me just because it does everything so well and that's awesome that is awesome I saw some people too

[17:25] were like I hope can a to get one broken at a box after all the shit he's given pired to the Caribbean owners I hope his arrives broken well to those

[17:34] individuals you guys are really some dark mother fuckers like what do you like really wishing that I get a broken one my God I would never

[17:44] wish wish any ill will on any of you you know and I think too for you those of you who listen to this show you notice it's like this show

[17:54] I think as I've tried through every episode to be a little bit more human you know to say things that I think are on your mind

[18:01] to call these companies out on how I see it and nobody would listen to this show if it wasn't a little bit how you see it I'm a

[18:09] little honest I'm a little brutal and I'm let me be brutal right now for a minute can I be brutal can I get in my brutal box and I allow

[18:16] to do this like I can love willy-wanker to death but I also can be honest with myself and I can look at the pinball landscape and say

[18:26] if willy-wanker comes out and has the three variations it's going to have at the three variations of prices let me tell you what game is

[18:35] never going to make it off the ground October fest there's just no way these two games are going to have a price point

[18:43] that's somewhat similar at the standard level who it's just it's like game over and maybe that's what happens when you release a game

[18:52] that's called October fest six months after October and and now you've got to compete with willy-wanker you know what other game is going

[19:00] I a lot of sales are going to be yanked away from them the monsters the monsters premium right just about to go out sexy as game this and that

[19:10] if you're in on a monster's premium and you're not calling your distributor and saying wait a minute let me see what willy-wanker is you're going to see it

[19:18] Friday and I'm already saying more and more monsters people more and more my friends who ran after monsters at least you know what they're doing

[19:26] they're selling their games already they're bored of them already three weeks four weeks later now here's the other seismic ship that's about to happen

[19:35] and it's already happening you can no longer going on a monster's early for nine thousand dollars and sell it used for like for like 8500 the next week I'm telling you what's happening

[19:47] now because of all these titles one on top of another and willy-wanker coming out and it's just not not going to stop what's going to happen is people are going to start to lose one thousand or two thousand

[19:59] dollars pretty quickly and so you're are you really want to lose a thousand dollars to buy a game site unseen that you haven't flipped yet I mean a lot of these guys who bought

[20:09] the monsters Ellie they never played the game they never played it once and they're just like addicted to getting machines but I'm telling you I think a lot of you that are just addicted to wanting what's next need to stop

[20:23] hit pause and I'm telling you there's a whole new like level of pinball coming and if you've been reluctant to sort of wait and you've been chasing everything new I mean I feel so

[20:35] bad for guys like frolic right me remember the frolic error the guy bought like everything every new Ellie Stern machine he could like for like a period of time like two years

[20:45] that whole those whole collections all those stern games the DMD error games you know what the value on them is about to plummet you know people

[20:54] thinking like a tron Ellie is going to hold value you guys it's over it's over you know and no one wants to accept it because for the longest time it was an over that these games were allowed to sort of retain a lot of value

[21:09] you are allowed to keep changing hands with them and they would and some of them would like double in value and they would they would remain really strong for a really long time

[21:18] when you look at Willie Wonka next to Tron Ellie it's a joke it's like a total joke everything about it how it shoots what's in it the artwork the sound the display

[21:30] Willie Wonka looks like it's five times the price of Tron Ellie and so then you know only 400 Tron Ellie's well there's only going to be I don't know how many collective additions of Willie Wonka

[21:41] so it's just I just can't wait to see it I mean that's like that's all I'm going to say like you know it's there's a new there's a new period coming in this hobby and it's a great period because I think it's going to make all ships rise with the tide I do I think Stern is going to start to wake the fuck up a little bit

[22:02] because they have the talent don't get me wrong Stern has the talent to do exactly what Jersey Jack is doing they do they have more people they have more manufacturing capabilities they have more engineers they have more software programmers they have more of everything you know

[22:17] what they don't have though is they don't give these guys the freedom to just make the best possible game they can make there these guys are all designing they're all designing to that price point

[22:29] they are not designing to their passion and to their imagination as much as they can and it it just goes to show look at the games look at the games I mean I'm even looking at Batman 66 which I have for sale it's a great game it's an amazing game

[22:44] but come on they've skinned a game they still just reskin the game they didn't make it from the ground up they reskinned it and they charged $15,000 and it's a great game it's an amazing pinball experience

[22:56] but you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying it's like this is not a reskinned anything it's an all new game all right so maybe you can tell my excitement has not waned at all I am still 100% in on the collector's edition and just to clarify something too

[23:14] I don't have a like specific order in all right I'm going to buy my game most likely you know Joe at pinball star is going to order my game for me he's going to order my collector's edition so if you want to collect

[23:26] his edition hit up Joe new heart at pinball star and he will happily do his best to get you one of his allocated games I think they're going to sell out but Joe I'm on Joe's list and so I told Joe what number I would like and he's going to help me get that number so that's where I'm at I didn't cut the line

[23:43] I love it to how people were upset that I might have had the ability to get the game before everybody else and yet year after year don't we watch all these stern people get on their distributors list and then all of a sudden the games are sold out before they're even revealed

[24:00] wouldn't it be nice if Jack got that once like doesn't he deserve that with this game I mean you guys went all in on games like Ghostbusters you never even played it

[24:09] game turned out to be one of the worst shooting games all right all right like okay so let me read some of your emails but I just want to clarify there was no conspiracy I'm in a really happy place and for those of you out there who can't enjoy me being in a happy place here's what I have to say to you I don't

[24:26] really care it's fun being happy it's fun being optimistic it's really awesome seeing the kind of game that I've been dreaming about since I started this podcast and I think you're all going to feel the same way

[24:38] and I've spoken to other people who saw the game as well on Friday other pinball podcast saw it other pinball media saw it and guess what they're all like it's fucking awesome look at everyone who's seen it it's fucking awesome look at everyone who's

[24:54] being cranky they haven't fucking seen shit right all right so let's see I'm going to open up my emails I'm going to read some of my notes now I got a lot of notes from you guys and I got a lot of

[25:04] sort of like Facebook messages from dudes who I'm really good friends with and they're like come on man just like just between us like what's in it like what's the toy like what's that and I haven't said anything to anyone I'm not going to do it I am not going to break the

[25:19] NDA and and and spoil the fun all right so okay so let's see I got an email

[25:26] to to to to to to to from Dave waiting so he said did you buy a new machine today like you I have 12k burning a hole in my pocket for this game hope

[25:38] you're doing well well that's from CEO Dave Dave yes I did put down the order on the collectors edition I got an email from Jack

[25:46] this is from Jersey Jack all right let me read it to you and then you can you hear the conspiracy Chris thanks for spending the day at JJP Brenda is lovely and it's nice to see how she shares your

[25:59] passion I'm so happy you loved and understood the game talk soon thank you Jack I'll talk a little bit more when I upload the podcast what Jack means by me

[26:10] understanding the game because I don't want to spoil some of the details but when I was playing it I was remarking about how

[26:17] pat designed it and something he did in the design and Jack was just like you get it like yes that is exactly what he was going

[26:26] for so he really you know I mean I'm not just some charlatan who wears you know a bunch of clothes with patches on it I actually know

[26:34] it to about pinball all right I got an email from Ryan he says a thought on why on why Stern does what they do all right well Ryan this is a long

[26:44] email so let me paraphrase because I just read it the first part Ryan is like I understand you know why they might not have released a T.P.F.

[26:51] these games because it's loud and it's noisy and it might make sense to have someone like Jack danger stream the game here's a thing though and I think you guys

[27:00] saw it seeing seeing a game for the first time at a show revealing the game at a show is a good thing playing the game in

[27:08] a loud noisy show is so stupid what I would do if I were pinball manufacturers I would not have the game out on a loud

[27:16] show floor for the for the first experience for people to play my machine what I would do is I would have a small

[27:23] room like a sweet and I would dress it up in the theme of the game and I would let people in one at a time to play the game with

[27:32] patlaw learn the room and with the design team and I would give everybody five minutes to experience will he

[27:40] want pinball and then you're out of the room and that is a much better way than just having it out there and on a loud

[27:45] floor and no one can really dive into the game I also my one issue to with like streaming it with like Jack danger

[27:51] sometimes I always hate seeing it when they tell you and reveal all the modes in the secrets of the game I kind of is that's

[27:58] what's fun about pinball is experiencing that for the first time and that's why I love so much playing will they

[28:04] want to for the first time is because I got to discover what was in the game without the internet and all the

[28:10] damn streamers spoiling it for me I mean when I when I met with Jack he said something really interesting he

[28:15] said he said we kind of destroyed our own pirates hype because we just kept streaming the game like every few

[28:22] weeks and people I just felt like they've played it for a year and a half and we probably shouldn't have

[28:28] done that and he's right by the time the game came out everyone was just sick of seeing the game and was

[28:34] fatigued by it I can already hear the pirates fanboys like loading up their weapons to come after me

[28:40] all right let's see another email I got one from Dave Donnell and he said wonka so site unseen purchase

[28:47] Dan Dan you're gonna have to play the game but I would I would buy it after listening to canada hype it

[28:54] all right then I got an email from Jason Zimmerman wonka watch he the first one came in at

[29:00] at 5.51 p.m. and he wrote all right man all they need to know you keeping the CE preorder then he emailed me

[29:07] again at 8.06 p.m. nevermind heard the podcast awesome stuff thanks again well thank you so much Jason for

[29:15] listening to the show can't wait to see if you get a willy wanka got an email from search now

[29:20] surges the guy who took me to sunshine laundromat and showed me how to play the pirate to the Caribbean that was broken terribly right

[29:28] remember surge good guy look you know love of fan who takes me into location to prove me wrong only to find

[29:35] the game is in terrible shape but surges huge fan of pinball huge pirates the Caribbean fan and he wrote

[29:41] okay twist my arm I'll get a wonka maybe I'll send you a dollar referral hidden in a wonka bar surge look I

[29:50] know you love pirates of the Caribbean I know all of you out there who love pirates of the Caribbean are

[29:56] still gonna love pirates of the Caribbean I know there's a lot to love in pirates of the Caribbean and I

[30:02] just think if you love pirates of the Caribbean you are really really gonna love willy wanka all right let's

[30:09] see who else did I get an email from I got an email from bill bill Cohen he said Chris started listening to

[30:16] your podcast and it's the best fucking podcast in the hobby it's so good it ruined all other of the

[30:25] others for me been even going back to listen to the old ones listening to wonka podcast now and you

[30:32] have me super excited for this pin your thoughts about the hobby are spot on keep it up bill Cohen well bill

[30:40] thank you so much it's always it's always an exciting day when I hear that somebody knew has discovered

[30:46] canate his pinball podcast it's like we might lose some people but we might gain some people but I'll

[30:52] say this even without even without the industry leaders joining me for interviews we've still managed to have a

[30:59] really really healthy healthy and and like hearty fan base with around 2000 people tune into every

[31:08] episode and I think I I podcast so much that it makes it hard for even all of you to catch up with my own

[31:15] cadence so when I slow down a little bit we're really hitting around 2200 people that tune into

[31:22] canate his pinball podcast now I'm really proud of that number you know I'm very thankful for all of you

[31:29] who tune in and especially for those who even donate to my patreon page but especially to new guys too

[31:35] because sometimes I just take for granted that just all my listeners have been with me since day one

[31:40] and I can't even imagine what it would be like sort of like an April of 2019 you get bit by the

[31:47] pinball bug you get into pinball and and what do you do right you make you might find out about

[31:52] pinside and then you probably start hearing the name canada every once in a while and then all of a sudden

[31:57] you hear everyone saying he's such a jerk on pinside and then it makes you curious well who is this guy

[32:02] and then you realize it's got a pinball podcast and then you start listening to pinball podcast and you experience

[32:07] that excitement for the first time and then you know maybe it's a little hard to listen to all them once you get a taste of

[32:13] how we do it on this show but I think there's a lot of great pinball podcasts out there you know my favorite right now

[32:19] is special when lit this weekend pinball and yeah those are the two that I check up with most I also check

[32:27] the other ones to see if they you know if they're saying any negative things about canada but no everyone's

[32:32] doing their shit and it's all good and we love everyone who pinball podcasts we think it's a great part of the

[32:38] hobby but you know I can't imagine having to go back and be like well catch up on canada's

[32:44] 332 other episodes like I hope you have a year to catch up with everything bill but thank you for

[32:51] becoming a listener of canada's pinball podcasts all right what else do I got here I got this email from

[32:57] Jay and the headline was I've got a golden ticket he was LOL you bastard I fell for your

[33:04] disappointment act during the first start during the start of your last podcast I nearly had a heart attack

[33:11] I was the one who asked Jack many many years ago to buy the rights to wonka and to do it justice before

[33:17] to turn turn decided to get their hands on it I'm glad you liked it Jack wanted to spill the beans to me a

[33:24] while back but he didn't so now I'm stuck waiting for with the rest of the world I'm in on a

[33:30] CE myself site unseen Jay well Jay man you do have a golden ticket now Jay said something in his

[33:38] email that I did not report on but it is if it is it is the truth it is the truth and for those of you out there

[33:45] who want conspiracy theories listen closely right now I'm going to tell you one now Jersey Jack had the

[33:52] license for Willy Wonka but then he lost it and it was taken away or it was you know someone was trying to

[33:59] out bid him for it or you know I give more money for it but he was told that he had lost the license

[34:06] and so I believe it was to stern pinball and Jack had a really go back to them and say look you know I

[34:13] think I'm the one who's going to be able to do this game justice not them and it was with Warner

[34:19] Brothers and I'm not sure if this was before after he had done wizard of Oz but you know is there anyone

[34:26] out there show of hands for those of you out there who would you rather have made star wars

[34:32] Stern or Jersey Jack who would you rather have had made Guardians of the galaxy who would

[34:40] you rather have had made here's the one Batman 66 right so it's just like it's you it's universal

[34:49] no one no one out there would ever say I would rather have Stern make my dream theme over Jersey Jack

[34:56] pinball now imagine if like Jersey Jack you get like Lyman Sheets on board it would just be over it would

[35:02] just it would just absolutely be over Lyman is the most valuable thing that Stern pinball has I hope

[35:08] Lyman Sheets is the highest paid employee at Stern pinball or near the top he's just that good

[35:16] all right what else did I get an email from let's see real quick as I know thanks are sticking with me on this

[35:22] episode sorry I just had to do another podcast because of all the conspiracies going on we can't have that

[35:27] I got in let's see I think that might be it I got a ton of Facebook messages I got text messages from people

[35:34] universally I think most people are saying I'm happy to hear you happy I got a nice note from

[35:42] Ed Robertson just saying it's it's it's so great to hear you excited about pinball and I it feels great

[35:49] is this what it feels like being happy in life but here's the thing guys I am very happy in my life

[35:55] I am very satisfied in my job I love my job I love my wife I love my life you know I saw people

[36:02] making fun of my photo someone put up my photo with Jack and Joe and everyone's like that guy wears those

[36:08] clothes out in public yeah man I mean sometimes you got to wear some Gucci jeans in New York city but I come on

[36:14] I've got good fashion since you saw me up there at the twippies who who's throwing fashion stones at me right now

[36:21] but anyway here's the deal I really I really love pinball and I know a lot of times people

[36:27] criticize me like he doesn't care about the hobby yet I just do 335 podcasts about pinball because I don't give a shit

[36:33] you know I mean seriously the fact that I have to defend this time and time again it is kind of a name

[36:39] but what I don't like most modern pinball I think there are a lot of games not a lot of good games

[36:46] and I think what you're gonna see Friday is what I've been talking about I it's like I don't even need to talk anymore

[36:52] you're gonna see it and it's gonna speak for itself it doesn't need me to help market it you know that's a thing

[36:58] it's like marketing starts at the very basic level if you pick the right theme you pick the right talent you pick the right

[37:05] passion that's the real marketing the insights what do people want marketing is about giving people what they want

[37:13] it's not about spinning the shit it's not about hoodwinking them with fake Ellie versions it's not about any of that shit

[37:21] marketing what does the pinball collector and pinball enthusiasts want they want a return of the kind of magical games we loved in the 90s

[37:32] but with modern code and with modern features that's what we want and right now right now the lead horse that's about to give us

[37:41] exactly what you want is Jersey Jack pinball right come on and the thing too and you guys have noticed this people are like

[37:48] no one gives Jersey Jack more shit than me I mean I'm still I've still got guys like tuna delight on

[37:55] Pinside who are like yeah man like I'm so happy to hear him excited about wonka but he's still crappin on Pirates of the

[38:02] Caribbean yeah I will never not think that Pirates is a miss boys it's okay I'm glad you like your

[38:10] pirates but when you see Willie Wonka I'm spelling it out for you real slow you're gonna understand how to

[38:17] really make a game great pirates is good wonka is great take that to the bank oh and here is another thing Jack

[38:25] told me straight up there will never be a black pearl edition he's not going like

[38:31] re license the theme when you see wonka too and you know it's coming next from these guys with guns

[38:37] and roses and toy story I'm telling you this is the new Jersey this is the corner they turn they're not

[38:42] gonna go back and make more pirates there's gonna be zero fucking demand to look back at Jersey Jack

[38:48] it's all gonna be about what's forward in this company and and look Eric is great and I can't

[38:55] wait to see what Eric does with the next title but Pat Lawler man he's Pat Lawler Pat Lawler for a fucking

[39:01] reason and you're gonna see it Friday all right I'm gonna go I'm gonna go just take a nap I'm tired I'm

[39:07] super excited I wish I could speed up the time and unbox my Willie Wonka right now everyone have a great

[39:14] day be happy and excited you've got six days to go before you see the greatest fucking pinball

[39:21] machine I've seen in a really long time have a great day everyone
