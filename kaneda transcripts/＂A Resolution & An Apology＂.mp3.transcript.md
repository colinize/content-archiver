[00:00] Well the declaration of my final podcast didn't last very long.

[00:03] I have an update that I want to give everybody.

[00:05] Let's just roll the intro.

[00:06] Let's...

[00:07] Oh!

[00:08] Oh!

[00:09] Oh!

[00:10] Oh!

[00:11] Oh!

[00:12] Oh!

[00:13] Alright, it's Sunday morning and I just got off the phone with Melissa from CoinTaker.

[00:18] We had a really nice talk and and and I've said this before.

[00:22] I've always considered Chris and Melissa to be friends of mine.

[00:26] I really did not want it to come to where it came to with my last podcast with this

[00:32] feeling that I just want to get out of the hobby that I really you know I just can't

[00:36] stand to you know lose money or invest more money in magic girl and I wanted to back

[00:43] out of a deal I made with with Chris and I understand like that I made a mistake and I

[00:50] hope I articulated that on my previous podcast which I have now removed because we have

[00:54] a resolution and I will let you know what that is.

[00:57] We talked about it but at first and foremost I just I would like to apologize because this

[01:04] was 100% on me.

[01:06] This is a mistake I made.

[01:09] I tried to explain that in my last podcast that I had become overly obsessed with magic

[01:17] girl and creating this shrine to the game that led me to want to collect these rare items

[01:23] that even as I look at the game now it just has this ability to capture your imagination

[01:30] and make you do stupid things right.

[01:32] I mean so many people can just glance at this game and think there's actually magic there

[01:38] and when I first got this magic girl I got really excited and then when I saw there was

[01:43] like a prototype I really wanted that because I felt like mine wasn't really that limited

[01:48] and there was a more special version and there is like the magic girl prototype that coin

[01:52] taker has is literally like a limited edition of a limited edition.

[01:58] I stupidly committed to paying $31,000 to get another magic girl and that was all on me.

[02:06] That was the deal I made with Chris from CoinTaker and I gave him $10,000 and he held on to

[02:12] the game for me and he held on to the game for a bunch of months and during that time period

[02:17] there were some magic girls that traded places and sold and because of that because

[02:22] the market on magic girl is not as hot as it was five months ago.

[02:28] The deal we reached and this is the deal I put in front of Chris and I've been trying

[02:33] to get him to agree to it for maybe like a month or two was that I should give them something

[02:40] because even though I didn't take possession of the game even though I just cut the tape

[02:44] I didn't even pull the game out of the box.

[02:47] I mean it's a new inbox game but because I prevented them from selling this machine

[02:53] the game probably lost some value during those months because the market on it is not as

[02:58] hot as it once was so I think it only fair that they are compensated for that.

[03:05] And so Melissa and I had a really good talk.

[03:08] We discussed what that compensation could be.

[03:11] Both parties are happy I'm not going to disclose exactly what the number is but you know

[03:16] I think it's a win-win and look and this is all my fault.

[03:22] I want people not to email coin taker.

[03:26] I don't want you guys to be mad at coin taker.

[03:29] They work really hard for their business.

[03:32] I work really hard for my money and this is just another example of bad communication.

[03:40] It was bad that Chris and I couldn't reach a deal.

[03:43] I probably should have gone to Melissa to begin with.

[03:47] And you know Chris is a man of his word and he wanted me to live up to my end of the deal.

[03:54] I just couldn't go through with the deal after I came through and I came to my senses on

[04:01] this game.

[04:02] I don't know what I was thinking and I made a mistake and it is all on me and I fall

[04:07] on that sword and I do.

[04:10] But I don't want anyone to blame coin taker at all.

[04:13] And I told Chris when him and I were trying to figure this out and we got an in-argument

[04:18] last night because it was basically like there was no compromise.

[04:22] There was no middle ground.

[04:23] It was just the deals a deal.

[04:24] That's it.

[04:26] I've always said that using my podcast to highlight something like this was always my

[04:33] last resort.

[04:34] Like if you're not going to give me anything back, if you're just going to keep my money

[04:37] and I say I don't want a game.

[04:39] I am going to put up a podcast.

[04:41] I'm going to tell people what's happening and I did.

[04:44] I wanted to leave the hobby.

[04:47] This goddamn magic girl.

[04:49] It has this ability to both mesmerize you and frustrate you and make you want to run

[04:55] as far away from pinball as you possibly can.

[04:58] I almost feel like these games are cursed.

[05:00] It's turned me into a complete idiot.

[05:02] It's made me do foolish things.

[05:04] Absolutely foolish things.

[05:06] I'm an idiot.

[05:07] The biggest idiot in the hobby for how I've sort of approached a magic girl.

[05:12] It has been nothing but a bad omen for me.

[05:17] Nothing good has come of it.

[05:19] The game came out.

[05:20] It's not like we're enjoying it.

[05:22] It's actually, it makes you not want to play pinball.

[05:25] It has this weird opposite effect.

[05:28] It's why I've been so cranky at times, stubborn at times.

[05:34] Chris and I at CoinTaker, we just couldn't come to a compromise on our own.

[05:39] I'm sad that it came to what it did last night, but I'm happy to report that we've reached

[05:43] an agreement and things are okay.

[05:46] What does that mean?

[05:47] If you are a fan of the show, don't email CoinTaker.

[05:51] We're all good now.

[05:53] If you didn't hear the previous episode, I pretty much just summarized it.

[05:56] I basically said I wanted to add this hobby.

[05:58] I wasn't going to put up another podcast until I got some sort of refund.

[06:04] That resolution has happened.

[06:07] What does that mean?

[06:08] It means there will be more Canadian pinball podcasts.

[06:10] Sorry, you guys who hate this show and want to see it go away for good.

[06:15] I hesitate to even laugh.

[06:17] It's not funny.

[06:18] I don't feel good.

[06:19] I feel bad.

[06:21] I feel bad about backing out of the deal and I apologize to my listener and Chris.

[06:25] I wish it never came to it.

[06:27] I wish I never agreed to spend so much money on it, but I was 100% wrong and I am willing

[06:32] to admit that.

[06:34] I want to put this behind us and I think it will be quickly put behind us.

[06:38] We're going to see Guardians of the Galaxy on Tuesday.

[06:41] We'll have better stuff to talk about more positive news.

[06:44] For those of you out there, I appreciate you listening to the show.

[06:51] I'm sorry that sometimes the show goes in these weird directions and it takes these dramatic

[06:55] twists and turns.

[06:56] I know that I caused some of that drama sometimes.

[06:59] Sometimes I report on the drama.

[07:00] Sometimes I create it.

[07:01] It's just the nature of who I am.

[07:04] Sometimes my own worst enemy.

[07:06] This may have been one of those times, but I just want to thank Chris and Melissa for

[07:10] understanding where I was coming from for seeing it through my perspective.

[07:15] I hope they understand that.

[07:17] I've also tried to see this from their perspective and I think we have a deal that makes both parties

[07:22] walk away, feeling hopefully somewhat satisfied with it.

[07:27] If you want a magic girl, I would buy the one they have.

[07:29] I would buy the prototype.

[07:31] If I could go back in time, I only would have bought the prototype if I knew it existed.

[07:34] I didn't realize there were going to be different games.

[07:36] I wouldn't have spent $23,000 on my machine only to realize there was a nicer version out

[07:43] there.

[07:44] I wanted just the best of the best and I didn't realize there would be variations.

[07:48] Another idiotic move by John Papaduke.

[07:51] It's not his fault.

[07:52] It's not anyone else's fault.

[07:54] It's my fault for making the deal.

[07:56] It's my fault for backing out.

[07:58] I just couldn't lose $10,000 and not take any merchandise or anything.

[08:06] As I told Chris, I was happy to just keep the money.

[08:08] I'm out of the hobby.

[08:09] I'm done.

[08:11] It didn't have to come to that.

[08:12] Next time, I will do my best to keep this offline, but I thought we hit a wall.

[08:18] It just goes to show you can find resolutions.

[08:21] You don't always have to take it to the most dramatic level.

[08:24] I have a tendency to do that and that is why I am telling everyone.

[08:28] I'm sorry.

[08:30] Enjoy your Sunday.

[08:31] Enjoy your pinball and get ready for Guardian on Tuesday.

[08:34] Have a great day, everyone.
