[00:00] Who was it that you who was breaking the line?

[00:04] The second element

[00:07] And the rain falls in the ice

[00:11] Who was it that you who was standing up by?

[00:16] The second element

[00:19] From the end to the sky

[00:23] Well, I've been saying it for years.

[00:30] There are a lot of wealthy men in the Pimbal hobby.

[00:34] Wellthie enough that they can drop $2100

[00:39] On a 24 karat gold topper for Indiana Jones

[00:42] And it sold out in about a half hour.

[00:45] I was on their website Elite Pimbal toppers

[00:47] You can see it on Canadian Pimbal Podcast Facebook page

[00:51] It's beautiful.

[00:52] Ark of the Covenant topper for Indiana Jones

[00:55] The Bali Williams game

[00:57] It's covered in 24 karat gold

[01:00] It's got LEDs, it's got a smoke machine

[01:02] I heard when you open up the box after spending $2100

[01:06] It melts your face off just like the real Ark of the Covenant

[01:09] No, it doesn't.

[01:10] So they made $25 of the super limited version

[01:13] And it's $2100 and they sold out.

[01:16] They're gonna make $75 of I think the $1300 version

[01:21] And then the basic version is unlimited

[01:23] Now look, I know we're at the point now

[01:26] Where it just seems completely crazy

[01:28] To so many of you out there

[01:30] That people would spend this kind of money on a topper

[01:33] And I don't care how cool toppers are

[01:36] And I love my toppers

[01:38] But you don't play a topper

[01:40] When you're playing Pimbal, you are looking below the glass

[01:44] These are not meant to interact with gameplay

[01:47] Even though they make these things interact with gameplay

[01:50] You just really can't have an amazing topper experience

[01:54] While you're playing a Pimbal machine

[01:56] I know stuff will be going off

[01:58] But only spectators will really be paying attention to that

[02:02] As you're playing the game

[02:03] It's really meant for this

[02:04] A topper like this

[02:06] A beautiful Pimbal topper in general

[02:09] It's simply meant to make the game look better

[02:12] When you walk up to it

[02:13] When the games are off and you walk up to your Pimbal machine

[02:16] And there's the topper

[02:17] That's when you really pay attention to the topper

[02:21] The moment you start playing a Pimbal machine

[02:23] You really don't get anything from the topper

[02:26] I'm sorry, you're not looking up that high

[02:28] You're just not

[02:29] Now, a Lee Pimbal toppers is smart

[02:31] They've been looking at where the market's gone

[02:33] And I've been saying this

[02:35] This is a great example of how nobody out there

[02:39] Truly understands the amount of money that's in this hobby

[02:43] And no one is catering to the rich people of Pimbal

[02:46] I mean that

[02:47] Nobody is really catering to them

[02:49] Nobody is making stuff that is super, super expensive

[02:52] Super, super limited

[02:54] And when you do it

[02:55] We've seen this happen just a few times

[02:57] With this topper

[02:59] El Vira with the piece of couch

[03:01] Batman SLE

[03:02] Whenever anyone has dropped out into the Pimbal world

[03:06] Or put into the Pimbal world

[03:08] Something that has been super expensive

[03:10] Super limited

[03:12] What happens?

[03:13] It sells out

[03:14] Magic girl

[03:15] $16,000 for 16 machines

[03:17] Without even seeing it

[03:18] It sold out

[03:19] These toppers

[03:21] They sold out today

[03:22] Of a $2100 topper

[03:25] Before even showing people pictures of the topper

[03:29] Right?

[03:30] Without even seeing it

[03:31] It sold out

[03:31] Now you can go to Canada's Facebook page

[03:33] I have pictures of the topper up on my Facebook page right now

[03:36] It is beautiful

[03:37] It is stunning

[03:38] Congratulations Bill Brand is forgetting one

[03:41] I mean I was talking to Bill tonight

[03:42] He was all excited

[03:43] Like he's like I got one

[03:44] And I'm like Bill great

[03:46] Great

[03:47] I'm happy you got one Bill

[03:48] It's gonna look beautiful on your Indiana Jones

[03:51] And Elite Pimbal toppers has beat Leora to the punch

[03:55] With the most expensive topper

[03:57] I don't know if the Hobbit topper was more than this

[03:59] But now we're at this point

[04:01] Where we're gonna see $2,000 toppers

[04:04] $2,000 toppers

[04:06] And it got me thinking about where we're headed with Pimbal

[04:09] And it's not where most of us are headed

[04:10] Let's be honest

[04:11] Most of us, the thousands and thousands and thousands of people

[04:15] Who love Pimbal do not value this stuff

[04:20] So let's not take something like this

[04:23] And pull it over the entire Hobbit

[04:25] Because 95 or 98% of Pimbal fans on planet earth

[04:31] Would never drop $2100

[04:36] On a Pimbal topper

[04:37] Okay, so the majority of people are of sane mind

[04:40] And the majority of people are making sound decisions with their money

[04:44] This is a vanity play for very wealthy men

[04:48] Who like to have everything dipped in gold

[04:51] And now their Pimbal topper is dipped in gold literally

[04:55] But it got me thinking about where we're headed with just this desire

[05:01] To spend a lot of money on things that are not below the glass

[05:06] And I started to think about this for a minute

[05:08] I was like, you know, we're really at this point now

[05:11] Where the stuff that's really elevating these machines

[05:14] The stuff that's really amplifying the prices of the Pimbal experience

[05:19] The stuff that's making games valuable

[05:22] Nothing is really affecting what's below the glass with gameplay

[05:29] And that is the biggest crime against Pimbal that's taking place right now

[05:34] If you were to ask me

[05:35] Is that where the money is being invested

[05:38] And I don't just mean by the Pimbal companies

[05:41] I mean where the consumers are putting their money

[05:44] The things they're saying they value

[05:47] Have nothing to do with gameplay

[05:51] They have nothing to do with the magic below the glass

[05:55] The stuff that people are spending more money on

[05:58] It's stuff like artwork

[06:00] It's stuff like armor

[06:02] It's stuff like toppers

[06:04] It's stuff like shaker motors

[06:07] It's stuff like in Visi Glass

[06:09] It has nothing to do with the game itself

[06:13] And that to me is the sad part

[06:16] Is that you would think with all this money in Pimbal

[06:20] With all these Pimbal fanatics who have deep pockets

[06:23] The things they would value

[06:25] Would be the stuff that makes the actual game better

[06:30] But they are not valuing that stuff

[06:32] And I'll tell you what Stern has done so successfully

[06:35] They have got all of you

[06:38] All of you out there who buy all these games

[06:40] Site unseen

[06:41] They have brought you to this place

[06:44] Where the stuff you value

[06:46] The limited edition plaque

[06:49] The best scar armor

[06:51] The different artwork

[06:53] All that stuff cost them nothing

[06:56] And they've been able to charge you thousands of dollars more

[07:00] For stuff that is pure vanity

[07:03] You're not having more fun

[07:05] On your LE

[07:07] Or your collector's edition

[07:09] Or your super rare version of this or that

[07:11] Or that because you have a different armor

[07:14] Or a topper or back glass

[07:16] Or this or that

[07:17] You're not having a different gameplay experience

[07:22] And so because they've been able to do this

[07:24] And they've been able to get people to spend thousands more

[07:28] On stuff that requires zero engineering

[07:31] Stuff that requires zero imagination

[07:34] Stuff that requires zero creativity

[07:37] It's stuff that can never break

[07:39] It's stuff that's not very innovative

[07:41] It's stuff that you don't have to file a patent for

[07:43] They've been very smart in doing this

[07:45] And now we are at the point

[07:47] And I mean this, I found this out today

[07:50] If you want to get a Godzilla Ellie

[07:53] From Stern Pimble

[07:54] Their distributors are already sold out

[07:57] This is stupid

[07:58] I know, I know you're like

[07:59] Canada, you're an idiot

[08:01] It's not sold out

[08:02] It's sold out

[08:03] You cannot get on a distributor list

[08:06] To get Keith L. Wins Godzilla right now

[08:09] Every distributor you call up

[08:11] Will tell you

[08:12] I don't have room on my Ellie list

[08:16] I don't think they're going to make 750 Godzilla's

[08:18] It's not Mandalorian

[08:20] So they make less than that

[08:22] Forget it

[08:23] You're just not going to get it

[08:24] And so that's where we're at now

[08:26] And I've been reflecting a lot on this

[08:27] Because I know that some people say

[08:29] I've driven Pimble to this

[08:31] With all of my suggestions on how they should market

[08:34] And how they should make things more limited

[08:36] And more rare and more special

[08:38] And they have

[08:39] They've done everything I've said

[08:41] They should do except for one thing

[08:43] They didn't make the games more special

[08:45] They just wrapped them with fancy wrapping paper

[08:49] And everybody bought it hook line

[08:51] And sinker to the point now

[08:53] Where Stern can sell out a game

[08:56] Before you ever see it

[08:58] They will sell out every single Ellie now

[09:01] Before anyone even sees it

[09:04] And when you're in a world like that

[09:06] Where stuff sells out before people even see it

[09:09] Or play it

[09:10] You know what that does?

[09:12] It makes them lazier

[09:14] They know they don't have to do much work now to get your money

[09:18] The less work they do

[09:19] The better

[09:20] They'll make more money now by putting less into these games

[09:24] Because there's no pressure

[09:27] To improve what they do

[09:29] Why would they?

[09:30] Why would they invest more in the product?

[09:33] Why would George Gomez raise the bomb?

[09:36] Why would he put more into his games

[09:39] When he's watching this behavior

[09:42] By thousands of people

[09:43] This isn't just like a few hundred people

[09:45] He's watching his games

[09:48] Be gobbled up

[09:49] Faster than they can even make them

[09:51] And he's watching them sell out site unseen

[09:54] They must get into a boardroom

[09:56] And say look these games are already spoken for

[10:00] So we don't need to put any money in the marketing

[10:03] We don't need to put any money into R&D

[10:05] We don't need to do anything other than continue to do what we're doing right now

[10:12] Now ultimately what will happen in this climate

[10:15] Is consumers will be left holding the bag

[10:18] Because this is a great period for Stern

[10:21] It's a great period for the other manufacturers

[10:24] They will sell so much of their inventory

[10:27] Because the economy is hot

[10:30] Because people are spending a lot of money

[10:32] But you know and I know

[10:35] In a few years

[10:36] When this stuff cools down

[10:38] And it's gonna cool down

[10:40] What's gonna happen?

[10:42] What will happen to the people

[10:44] Who have so much money and pinball machines

[10:46] And don't have a lot of cash flow

[10:48] What will happen to the people that have all these games

[10:50] And they need to sell them

[10:52] Are they gonna get back what they put into them

[10:54] Are most people buying these games because they love them

[10:58] And they want to have fun with them

[11:00] Or are so many people just caught up in it

[11:04] See I don't really know

[11:05] I don't really know

[11:06] It's gotta be a mixture of both

[11:08] I think there are obviously people who buy

[11:11] Whatever comes out next

[11:12] There are those rich collectors who just tell their distributor

[11:15] Give me every new alley

[11:17] But I think for a lot of you out there

[11:18] If you're truly soul searching right now

[11:21] You can't tell me

[11:23] That you only buy a game when you know it's good

[11:26] That you only buy a game when it's a dream theme of yours

[11:30] That's not the case

[11:32] There is no way

[11:33] These games are only being absorbed

[11:36] Through those two criteria

[11:38] Of you know the game's awesome

[11:39] Because we know these games like sell out before anyone even plays them

[11:43] And then when it comes to a dream theme

[11:45] We know that most of these are not your dream themes

[11:49] Yet just love pinball

[11:51] And that's okay right? I mean sometimes I think

[11:53] You know it is okay just to love pinball where you want new pinball experiences

[11:58] And that's okay like if you love pinball and you want new pinball experiences

[12:02] And you're not near a location where these new games arrive

[12:05] And you have to put them in your home to experience them

[12:08] That's fine

[12:09] That's fine

[12:09] It's your money spend it as you see fit

[12:13] But I've been a lot more reflective lately

[12:15] It's been an interesting year for Brenda and myself

[12:18] With baby Killian we got them baptized yesterday

[12:21] It was an amazing day

[12:22] And as I think about creating a home for my family

[12:26] And prioritizing what's important to me

[12:29] And to us

[12:30] And to not put myself first in that priority

[12:34] I start to think about well how much of my home that we get one day

[12:39] Am I going to allocate to stuff that I want

[12:42] Versus experiences I want to do with my family

[12:46] And versus what is important to me

[12:48] And my evolution within pinball was I always wanted to have like a rare game

[12:53] That not everybody had

[12:54] That was a unique experience because if I could only have one pinball machine in my home

[12:59] I just wanted to create this machine to be something special

[13:02] That is why I bought Magic Girl and it didn't work

[13:05] And I moved it on because you can't own a broken Magic Girl

[13:08] Now speaking of Magic Girl more information to come on this

[13:12] But there is a group of gentlemen over in the Netherlands

[13:16] That have made a working Magic Girl

[13:18] And I talked to one of them for about a half hour

[13:21] About everything they did that went into this game

[13:24] They spent two and a half years

[13:27] And redid like 50 mistakes that John Papadou put into his Magic Girl

[13:32] And they will tell you that that game was an utter disaster

[13:35] And there was just stuff in it that just didn't work

[13:38] John thought he could have magnets holding the ball over plastic ramps

[13:42] And if he did what he wanted to do it would melt the ramps

[13:45] And so they did 50 different changes to the game to get it more playable

[13:50] It's still not a full game code wise

[13:53] But there is going to be a lot more information coming from me on this show

[13:57] And they're going to share videos of their working Magic Girl to the world

[14:01] And they're also this is good news for those of you out there who have a Magic Girl

[14:06] Whatever they do, they're going to make 20 versions of it

[14:10] So others out there who have a broken Magic Girl

[14:13] Can put the changes that they've done into their games

[14:17] And get them somewhat working

[14:19] It will never be a fully working game

[14:22] It'll never be a fully coded game

[14:25] But there's at least going to be an opportunity to lock the balls

[14:29] Start a multi ball, get jackpots

[14:32] And hear more of the music and some of the other stuff that was in the source code

[14:36] That they never put into the games when they made them with American pinball

[14:40] So that's exciting news somewhat because it's still the most beautiful pin ever

[14:43] But my point being, I always wanted that rare game that unique experience

[14:48] But as time has gone on and I've played more and more pinball machines

[14:52] And I realized like sure you could have a game in which there's only 80 Batman S-S-L-E's

[14:59] And you could spend a lot of money on that

[15:01] Or you could just spend a third of the price

[15:03] And buy a regular Batman premium and just enjoy the game and not worry about it

[15:09] I'm starting to feel like all this desire to have something unique and special just deflects to the community

[15:17] It's really pointless

[15:18] There's no end game to it

[15:20] It doesn't make any of us special

[15:22] It doesn't make you more interesting

[15:25] And maybe this is just a little bit of the residual effect

[15:28] Of feeling like that other game I just bought where there's only 500

[15:33] Now I'm not really excited to open it up because of all the quality issues with it

[15:38] And I just start to feel like the most important thing in this hobby is so simple

[15:43] It's so simple, it's right in front of most of us

[15:45] And most of you, this is how you engage with pinball

[15:48] You just want to play a game that is exciting

[15:51] That is fun, that has moments, that move you, and that excite you

[15:56] And I think when I start to see stuff like 2100 toppers

[15:59] And I see stuff like Mandalorian Ellie selling for 92 in her bucks

[16:04] MSRP and then people are flipping them immediately for $4,000 more

[16:09] And that game is still the same

[16:11] Game's not worth $5,000 more but it is because people just need to have something new

[16:17] It just makes me sad because I think about well

[16:19] Clearly Stern could have made a Mandalorian in which they put a couple thousand dollars more into the game

[16:26] And we still would have bought it

[16:28] Let me repeat that

[16:29] If Stern put $2,000 more into the game

[16:34] And charged us $2,000 more

[16:37] If every Mandalorian was $11,200

[16:41] If it had $2,000 more goodies in it

[16:44] They still would have sold every one

[16:46] And see all this money, it's like floating around the pinball industry

[16:51] It's floating from like rich collectors to rich collectors

[16:56] It's floating from like rich collectors to Stern's like accounting department

[17:00] But the money is not going to the engineering department

[17:04] And none of the money, none of that extra capital is going to making the games better

[17:10] And that I think is the biggest problem in pinball these days

[17:14] Is that we're chasing after stuff that doesn't have any impact on the games themselves

[17:20] It doesn't have any impact on gameplay

[17:23] It's not pushing the envelope at all

[17:26] In terms of what could be under the glass

[17:29] And I'm part of the problem

[17:30] Is I've been one of the podcasters who's always been celebrating

[17:34] How easy it would be

[17:36] For these pinball companies to sell $20,000 versions

[17:40] $15,000 versions of their games

[17:43] Without even having to add much more to the game

[17:47] We're just at the point now where Stern could easily make an SLE of every single game

[17:53] And charge $20,000 for it

[17:56] And make 50 SLEs of every single title

[18:00] And they would sell every single one

[18:02] And there's just that much money in the hobby

[18:05] But it's a shame because the money's not going to making the games any better

[18:09] Now speaking about making the games better

[18:12] One of the two men that I do believe

[18:15] Brought more to pinball and put more of his heart

[18:18] And soul and creativity into a pinball machine

[18:22] Past away over the weekend

[18:24] And that was Yop with Dutch pinball

[18:27] Now say what you will about Yop's business practices

[18:32] But the man is gone

[18:33] And I know he was battling cancer for a while

[18:36] So we would like to offer our condolences

[18:38] To Yop's family and to the Dutch pinball family

[18:41] To Barry

[18:42] And everyone that knew Yop

[18:44] Who is mourning his passing

[18:46] And while I don't agree with the business practices of Yop

[18:50] Barry and Yop were two men

[18:52] Who built one of the coolest pinball machines you and I have ever seen

[18:56] It's still being made

[18:58] His dream lives on today

[19:00] And this is all we really want in pinball

[19:02] We want to see people who take a theme they love

[19:06] And make a world under glass that brings that theme to life

[19:10] In such spectacular fashion

[19:13] And Dutch pinball did it so amazingly well

[19:16] With the big Lebowski

[19:18] We have always said it Barry and Yop and Barry in particular

[19:21] I think is one of the coolest designers we've ever had in pinball

[19:24] And we just don't have any other games from him

[19:27] So I would love to see Dutch pinball make all of the big Lebowski owners whole

[19:32] And move on to game two

[19:34] Speaking of game two

[19:35] Do you think we're going to get a game two from Deeproot?

[19:37] Now I've been talking to some friends who are in on Deeproot

[19:40] And they're just staying in on it

[19:42] I mean no one's bailing

[19:43] I mean most people are just like

[19:45] I've waited this long

[19:46] What's another 10 years

[19:48] You know it's kind of like that with Deeproot and the wait for these games

[19:51] I just still don't know how they move past Raza and get to food truck

[19:55] How do they do it?

[19:56] You know every time I see these images that Iceman post of like 20 cars in the parking lot

[20:02] I don't know why people don't just knock on the door

[20:05] And ask to see what's going on inside

[20:09] Do I think Deeproot will eventually make these Raza's?

[20:12] I do

[20:13] I do think they're eventually going to get these games made

[20:16] I think the cost to make each one

[20:20] Is going to be tens of thousands of dollars

[20:23] And actual cost of all the labor

[20:26] All the hours

[20:27] And all the vendors

[20:29] And all the stuff they have to do to make these games real

[20:32] They'll never see a dime of profit

[20:36] On any of this

[20:37] We all know that

[20:37] That's just no way

[20:38] Like with all the money invested in Raza

[20:40] You can't just make a hundred and twenty two

[20:43] I think Deeproot's new goal is to get people their games by Pimball Expo

[20:49] And I know that sounds like so far away but it's really not

[20:52] So that's my prediction

[20:53] Is that these Raza's will actually make their way into people's homes

[20:59] By Pimball Expo

[21:00] Because I do think they're going to want to go to Expo with food truck

[21:04] They have to

[21:05] Like or it was all for nothing

[21:06] Now if that doesn't happen

[21:08] They're just going to close doors

[21:09] And just the whole thing is just going to be a write-off

[21:11] So it's one of those two things will occur

[21:12] All right so what else is going on in Pimball

[21:14] So Chicago Gaming Company is close

[21:17] Cactus Canyon is right around the corner

[21:19] I predict you will see Cactus Canyon remake

[21:23] If all goes according to plan

[21:26] You will see the new game from CGC by the end of July

[21:30] So from what I'm hearing

[21:32] This game is going to push the envelope

[21:35] Of what they've done before over at CGC

[21:38] We know the play fields are good quality

[21:40] We know this game is packed with toys

[21:42] And I think they're going to do a lot

[21:44] With the code and the LCD

[21:46] And it's going to have a beautiful topper

[21:47] And the topper is not going to cost you 2100 bucks

[21:50] And so I think this is going to be an amazing package from CGC

[21:54] I really do when I talk to people over there

[21:56] They're very excited about it

[21:58] They keep telling me it's going to sell out right away

[22:00] Everything's already sold out

[22:02] You know this is Pimball now

[22:03] Everything's already sold out

[22:04] It's almost like no longer interesting

[22:06] When stuff sells out right away

[22:08] It's actually more interesting when something's a failure

[22:11] And we're like what happened

[22:12] Like how come nobody bought hot wheels

[22:15] How come nobody bought October Fest

[22:17] Then it becomes something worthy of discussion

[22:20] It's not even worth discussing

[22:21] Oh wow, Mandalorian sold out in an hour

[22:24] Wow

[22:25] Cool

[22:25] It was supposed to sell out in an hour

[22:27] There's nothing interesting there

[22:29] So for those of you out there

[22:30] If you really want to dominate the airwaves

[22:32] Just do something that's a failure

[22:34] And we'll talk about it non-stop

[22:36] I think Deeproot has like 350 pages of Deeproot on Pinside

[22:41] Think about this for a minute

[22:42] Look how many pages are in the Deeproot thread

[22:46] And it's a failure

[22:48] Look how many pages are in the P3-multimorphic thread

[22:51] And they've successfully made games over the years

[22:54] I mean that's where we're at

[22:56] That's where we're at

[22:57] Alright, spooky Pimball

[22:58] Where is the next spooky game?

[23:00] Charlie, come on

[23:01] Everyone's tired of guessing

[23:02] I think everyone's just reached the point now

[23:04] Where they're just tired of guessing

[23:06] I'm gonna go back and say it's going to be Halloween

[23:09] Or Nightmare on Elm Street

[23:10] Those are my two guesses

[23:12] Halloween

[23:13] And Nightmare on Elm Street

[23:14] I don't think it's gonna be Army of Darkness

[23:17] Now where is American Pimball's next game?

[23:19] So this is another company

[23:21] Where David Fix has been doing interviews

[23:23] And he's sort of set the agenda for the year

[23:25] So apparently American Pimball is gonna have two new titles

[23:28] From Junior Designers

[23:30] And then we will see a license theme

[23:32] Most likely at T-P-F

[23:34] Which will be Dennis Nordman's game

[23:36] And so what do we think these games are gonna be?

[23:38] Well the two games I think we're gonna see this year

[23:41] I think we're gonna see a Riot Pimball game from them

[23:43] So maybe Legends of Vahala

[23:45] Then I think we're gonna see a Joe Balser game from them

[23:48] I think they're gonna make one of Balsers like Valkyrie

[23:51] Or Poker Run or Sherlock Holmes

[23:53] I think that will be made after

[23:55] Or they rescind it

[23:56] But that'll be a Joe Balser design after it

[23:59] Then we get to Dennis Nordman's game

[24:01] Which will be the license theme

[24:03] Now I still think American Pimball never should have came out in December

[24:06] And said how they were gonna be this brand new company

[24:09] And they are a brand new company

[24:10] But where are the games?

[24:12] We are six months past the date

[24:14] When David Fix came out

[24:15] And made fun of Canada

[24:17] And said how American Pimball was gonna be this, this, and this

[24:19] Six months have passed

[24:21] And they have zero new games out

[24:23] And they've waited such a long time

[24:24] Now they gotta compete with supply chain issues

[24:27] They've gotta compete with Mandalorian

[24:30] The timing is right

[24:31] David, just get the damn game out

[24:34] All right, just get the game out

[24:36] Show us what you got

[24:38] Show us what you got

[24:39] What I don't understand is why does an American Pimball make the King Pim Re-Make

[24:44] If you've been following the King Pim Re-Make

[24:47] It makes no sense

[24:48] Those guys are making that game

[24:50] And it's still not made

[24:52] Years have gone by

[24:53] People would buy King Pim

[24:55] Now there's a little bit of controversy with this King Pim Re-Make

[24:59] Because as you know

[25:01] King Pim was a game made by Capcom

[25:04] Now they are remaking the game

[25:06] Using Bali Williams flippers and parts

[25:09] So Capcom flippers feel different

[25:12] Than Bali Williams flippers

[25:14] But here's the point

[25:16] Only something like

[25:17] Eight Capcom King Pim machines were ever made

[25:22] So not that many people

[25:24] Have ever played an original King Pim Game

[25:28] 99.9% of Pimball people have never played

[25:31] In original King Pim machine

[25:34] So if you make a new King Pim machine

[25:37] Using new flippers or new Bali Williams mechanisms

[25:40] You are not going to get a lot of people complaining

[25:44] That it doesn't feel right

[25:45] And I saw people on Pinside trying to argue like

[25:48] You gotta maintain the integrity of the Capcom feel

[25:52] Ridiculous

[25:53] It's ridiculous people get over yourselves

[25:56] These aren't like numbers matching original Carroll Shell

[26:00] Be cars that were selling at auction

[26:02] And were trying to mislead people

[26:04] It's a Pimball machine in which they only made eight prototypes

[26:08] And they never got fully made

[26:10] And now they're using the most popular flippers ever used in the history of Pimball

[26:15] And so what if they're just changing the flipper mechs in the games

[26:18] They're not changing the geometry

[26:20] And I get that Gene Cunningham

[26:23] I get that he made sure that those Big Bang bars were made with the right parts

[26:28] Okay and guess what Big Bang bar did to Gene Cunningham

[26:33] It sent them to an early grave the machine killed the man basically

[26:37] He basically gave up his life just to get those machines made for people

[26:41] That's the toll it took on him

[26:43] It's not worth it

[26:44] I'd rather Gene Cunningham still be here

[26:47] And not do what he did with Big Bang bar

[26:49] It just wasn't worth it

[26:51] Alright Mandalorian Pimball machines are shipping

[26:53] Stern has done it again

[26:55] They do it so well they do it every time

[26:58] Mandalorian pros are making their way out into the world

[27:02] I think they're gonna go pro

[27:04] Then some premiums

[27:05] Then Ellie this time

[27:07] That's what I heard but I'm not sure

[27:09] But I do know this

[27:10] Stern is severely backlogged

[27:12] So if you ordered a Mandalorian

[27:14] You might be waiting a very long time

[27:16] I've been hearing people who said when they ordered the game on day one

[27:19] They are now being told like their premium and their pro

[27:22] Will be shipping in October

[27:24] October

[27:25] So get ready for a long wait

[27:28] And it's not just Pimball

[27:29] There is a ton of stuff

[27:31] Where the supply chain issue is affecting so many industries

[27:34] And Pimball is one of them

[27:36] I think that covers everybody on this episode of Canadian Pimball podcast

[27:39] It's always a pleasure putting on the headset

[27:42] And doing these shows for you

[27:43] Thank you so much to everyone who contributes to the show

[27:46] You're getting your special episodes of the Canadian Club

[27:48] If you don't know about it

[27:50] Ask somebody

[27:51] Right now there's not a ton of news

[27:53] The damn will break

[27:55] The damn will break

[27:56] When spooky Pimball shows us their game

[27:59] I think it's gonna happen in the next few weeks

[28:01] Until then

[28:03] Until then let's treat each other with respect

[28:06] And let's stay off of Pinside

[28:07] Until there's real news

[28:09] I see the way everybody's talking everybody on that site lately

[28:13] It is just so negative

[28:16] I highly recommend

[28:17] You turn it off

[28:19] You don't go on at that much

[28:21] And you just enjoy your games

[28:23] Listen to the podcast

[28:24] You enjoy

[28:26] If you bought $2,100

[28:27] Toppers that's your prerogative

[28:29] But I do implore all of you out there

[28:32] Think twice before you run in just buy games

[28:35] Really think about it

[28:37] Really think about

[28:38] Do you need more Pimball machines in your life

[28:41] Is that the thing that's gonna make your life better

[28:45] And maybe collectively one day

[28:48] All of us

[28:49] Will try to ensure

[28:50] That if we're gonna spend more money on these Pimball machines

[28:54] That the money is actually going

[28:56] To the designers and the engineers

[28:59] To put more into these games

[29:01] It's going to the accountants

[29:03] It's going to Gary Stern's pocket

[29:06] It's not going to the R&D teams over at these companies

[29:10] And so much of the money that we're spending on Pimball

[29:14] Isn't going towards anything

[29:16] That makes these games better

[29:18] And I know it's easy for me to not buy

[29:20] Because I don't have room

[29:21] But I will say when I get a house

[29:23] The last thing I'm gonna do

[29:25] When I walk into that new home with our family

[29:28] Is say how many Pimball machines can I get into this house

[29:31] It's not gonna be like that

[29:32] I would be happy with just three to four Pimball machines

[29:36] That are based on my dream themes

[29:38] I'll tell you right now

[29:40] As of today

[29:41] There are not even four

[29:44] Dream themes of mine

[29:45] In Pimball form

[29:46] They're just aren't

[29:47] Give me the matrix

[29:49] Give me big trouble in little China

[29:52] Give me Akira

[29:53] Give me Andrew Lloyd Weber's

[29:55] The Phantom of the Opera

[29:56] And it has to be Lloyd Weber

[29:58] I want to hear Michael Crawford

[30:00] And Sarah Brightman

[30:01] In Pimball form

[30:03] Everybody have a great day
