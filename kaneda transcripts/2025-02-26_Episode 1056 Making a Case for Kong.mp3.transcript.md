[00:00] It's a beautiful day.

[00:01] Sky falls and feels like it's a beautiful day.

[00:08] To live again away.

[00:13] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit up.

[00:18] Good morning, everybody.

[00:19] Welcome to the world's most talked about pinball podcast.

[00:23] Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] Happy to be here.

[00:26] It is Killian's fourth birthday today.

[00:30] We've had so much fun.

[00:32] Thank you so much, Hector, for the Paw Patrol,

[00:36] Inflatable Chase.

[00:37] He's been playing with his big pup truck toys.

[00:41] It's amazing for $100.

[00:45] You can blow a kid's mind.

[00:48] And we spend $2,000 on flat toppers that upset us.

[00:54] Think about that for a minute.

[00:57] What's going on in the pinball world, everybody?

[00:59] We're gonna go around the horn.

[01:01] We're gonna talk about these companies.

[01:03] But before I do that, I wanna issue a bet.

[01:07] Because my good friend, Jason Knapp,

[01:09] said he is willing to take bets

[01:12] that the walking dead is coming out this fall.

[01:16] Now look, I said it's confirmed

[01:18] that it's not coming out.

[01:20] You know, Canada.

[01:21] I used the word confirmed very loosely.

[01:24] It may come out.

[01:25] Stern's remake schedule is all over the place.

[01:30] It's anybody's guess.

[01:31] It could be Tron.

[01:32] It could be Walking Dead.

[01:34] It could be Ghostbusters.

[01:35] But Jason Knapp is saying he will accept bets

[01:39] that it's coming out this fall.

[01:41] And so I texted him, Jason, okay, cool.

[01:44] Let's make a friendly bet of $100

[01:47] that the walking dead does not come out this fall.

[01:51] You say it does, I say it doesn't.

[01:53] And he hasn't responded in 24 hours.

[01:57] I can see he read my message.

[01:59] I don't think that's a lot of money to bet.

[02:02] I know Jason's got it.

[02:03] He could cover that bet.

[02:05] So I just wanna do it.

[02:06] Maybe we do something friendly.

[02:07] We wear each other's logos on hats or t-shirts.

[02:11] But I don't think it's coming out.

[02:13] So that's my bet.

[02:14] The good news is we're not gonna find out until the fall.

[02:18] On my last show, I talked about King Kong

[02:21] and how I think King Kong is gonna be harder

[02:24] to turn into a masterpiece like Godzilla.

[02:27] That the theme of King Kong is not as exciting,

[02:31] not as campy, there's not as much content

[02:33] and not as many assets as there are

[02:36] in the world of Godzilla.

[02:37] I got a really nice note from James G.

[02:41] I'm not gonna say the last name.

[02:43] James G, I gotta protect all of you, right?

[02:46] Because you know how the Canadian haters are, man.

[02:48] I mean, first of all, thank you so much, everybody.

[02:51] That's been sharing all of this stuff

[02:54] that's been said about me.

[02:55] I don't watch it or pay attention to it.

[02:58] I think it's awesome.

[02:59] People always fall victim to the greatest

[03:02] Canadian strategy in the history of marketing.

[03:06] Make them talk about you.

[03:09] Make them, you know, make you the enemy.

[03:12] Make them say deplorable things about you.

[03:16] And guess what happens?

[03:18] More people check you out.

[03:20] More people know who you are.

[03:22] And it's just fun to me, man.

[03:24] Everyone can make all these jokes and make fun of me.

[03:26] I make fun of me more than all of that content combined.

[03:29] Whatever those people think of me,

[03:31] I probably think 10 times worse of myself.

[03:35] And I don't really care.

[03:37] All I care about is my family, health, happiness

[03:40] and having a good time in pinball.

[03:41] So keep it coming.

[03:43] It just keeps more people coming through the door.

[03:45] It's awesome.

[03:46] They fall victim to the bait every single time.

[03:49] All right, so James G hits me up

[03:51] and he gave me a few interesting things I wanna talk about

[03:55] in terms of King Kong and Kong's ability to be a great game.

[03:59] Well, first and foremost, we all know

[04:01] that there is a 90% chance King Kong is gonna be amazing.

[04:05] And it's because of two things, Keith Elwyn.

[04:08] And then it's because of his team over at Stern.

[04:10] But James writes,

[04:11] Canada, King Kong is gonna be a major hit

[04:15] for the same reasons that Godzilla was and still is.

[04:19] By the way, you are not paying attention

[04:21] to the emails I'm sending you.

[04:24] Godzilla is undoubtedly the best selling Stern machine

[04:28] and is still selling right now

[04:30] better than any other Stern machine.

[04:33] Well, James, I wish you could prove that.

[04:36] I wish that we got total numbers released

[04:40] at the end of each year

[04:42] for what Stern pinball moved against each SKU.

[04:46] Wouldn't it be great if we just knew

[04:48] they sold this many Metallica's, ACDC's,

[04:52] Star Wars, Godzilla's, nobody knows.

[04:55] We know they sold no John Wick's.

[04:57] They're not selling many Venoms.

[04:59] When it comes to a game like D&D, you know,

[05:01] oh, it's selling really well.

[05:02] It's selling like hotcakes.

[05:04] I don't know.

[05:05] Is it really?

[05:06] I bet the LEDs will probably move

[05:09] but are people really gonna be plopping down

[05:12] 9,700 bucks on a brand new D&D in a box?

[05:17] I think at this price point,

[05:19] Stern has to be selling less games.

[05:21] There's no way they are selling more games now.

[05:24] And remember, Godzilla, Ellie, $10,500.

[05:29] King Kong, Ellie is gonna be $13,600.

[05:33] So just think about that for a minute.

[05:36] King Kong is gonna be $3,000 more

[05:40] than freaking Godzilla was.

[05:42] Do you think it's gonna have 3,000 more in it

[05:45] when it comes to mechs, bomb and toys and everything?

[05:48] I don't know.

[05:50] So he goes on to write,

[05:51] no theme song for King Kong, maybe,

[05:55] but it's well-known famous fact that King Kong

[05:58] is the very first movie in history

[06:01] to have an original soundtrack.

[06:04] Did any of you know that?

[06:06] I don't think anybody knows that.

[06:09] And my second point, James, is nobody cares.

[06:13] Oh man, guys, what was the first movie

[06:16] to have an original soundtrack?

[06:18] Oh, what is it?

[06:19] King Kong, okay.

[06:21] Does anybody remember the music?

[06:23] No.

[06:24] Is the music iconic?

[06:25] No.

[06:26] So yeah, maybe an interesting fact,

[06:28] but it's not gonna sell one more game.

[06:31] Point number two he makes.

[06:32] King Kong doesn't always die.

[06:35] I said that he dies in every movie, right?

[06:37] He goes up the building, he gets shot,

[06:39] he falls and he dies.

[06:41] Now, last time I checked,

[06:42] those were the King Kong movies I grew up with.

[06:45] I know in the newer ones, he doesn't die.

[06:48] James goes on to say he dies in the original

[06:51] and the Peter Jackson remake.

[06:54] He also died in the 1970s one

[06:56] when he climbs the Twin Towers,

[06:58] which was what James said here.

[06:59] He dies in the 70s remake as well,

[07:01] but he comes back to life in the sequel,

[07:05] King Kong Lives.

[07:06] Yeah, I remember that.

[07:07] Remember that they gave him like a heart transplant?

[07:09] That was like the weirdest King Kong movie ever.

[07:11] I hope this stern game is based only on that one.

[07:15] Like you have to give Kong a new mechanical heart

[07:19] and bring him back to life just so he can die

[07:22] all over again.

[07:23] He then writes, other than that,

[07:25] he lives in all other appearances.

[07:28] Well, I'm happy Kong finally survives.

[07:31] The humans that are trying to make a mockery of him.

[07:35] His third point is Godzilla dies

[07:37] in the original Godzilla movie.

[07:39] He also dies in the recent Godzilla minus one.

[07:42] He does, but at the end of the movie,

[07:44] don't they show like the atomic material

[07:48] reforming to create the next Godzilla?

[07:51] Godzilla 1988, Godzilla GMK,

[07:54] Godzilla versus Mega, Goryus,

[07:57] I don't know, the return of Godzilla.

[07:59] There are several others in which Godzilla dies

[08:02] and they bring him back to life.

[08:04] All right, I get it, I get it, I get it.

[08:06] And point number four, Godzilla isn't popular

[08:09] because it's campy.

[08:11] He is popular in spite of Godzilla being campy

[08:14] because the fans, like myself, watched it as kids

[08:18] and didn't see it as campy.

[08:20] Most Godzilla fans like the latter,

[08:23] more serious versions better

[08:25] than the earlier campy, Godzilla.

[08:27] All right, so James,

[08:29] thank you for writing this in.

[08:31] And as I go through all of this,

[08:32] I think the main point you're making

[08:34] is that King Kong can be great as a pin

[08:37] because King Kong doesn't always die

[08:40] and King Kong doesn't need to be campy to be a fun pin.

[08:45] And look, I see it, right?

[08:46] Like Jurassic Park isn't really a campy movie.

[08:49] Like it would scare the bejesus out of little kids

[08:52] if they watched Jurassic Park,

[08:54] but it's got a lot of comic relief.

[08:56] And that's the thing about King Kong,

[08:58] when you think about it, I feel like Godzilla

[09:00] always had some comic relief in how serious

[09:04] the actors in the movies are reacting to Godzilla.

[09:09] When it comes to King Kong movies, though,

[09:11] there's just really not a lot of comedy.

[09:15] There's not a lot of like levity in the movie.

[09:18] But what there is in these new Kong movies,

[09:21] which is what I think they're gonna base it on,

[09:23] there's a lot of action.

[09:24] And I think when we see this Keith Elwin King Kong,

[09:28] it is gonna be just that.

[09:30] It's gonna be very similar to Godzilla.

[09:34] It's gonna be King Kong battling monsters.

[09:37] I think it's gonna be more of that

[09:39] and less of falling in love with a blonde,

[09:42] less of climbing an empire state-building.

[09:45] What I think they're going to do,

[09:47] much like they've done in Jaws.

[09:49] And I think it's gonna be brilliant.

[09:51] And I think it's gonna be well-implemented.

[09:54] And I think it's gonna be executed incredibly well.

[09:57] I think they're gonna have some modes in King Kong

[10:01] where the game becomes a throwback

[10:04] to some of those original King Kong movies.

[10:07] I think the game is gonna have like a black and white

[10:09] throwback mode in which we see the original Kong

[10:13] at the top of the empire state-building,

[10:16] swatting at the airplanes.

[10:18] I think that's gonna be in this game.

[10:20] The Hala, the way you can play Jaws Revenge

[10:24] and it's a whole different game.

[10:25] I think they might do something like that.

[10:28] I think they are very creative this team.

[10:31] When I look at Jaws and everything they've done

[10:34] and I look at what's in Godzilla,

[10:36] it is almost impossible not to get super excited

[10:40] about what's gonna be in King Kong.

[10:42] This game is coming out within four months.

[10:44] That is so exciting.

[10:46] The prices are not gonna be exciting.

[10:48] This is also gonna be the reveal

[10:50] of what Stern Pinball is going to bring out with Spike 3.

[10:54] I've spoken to people at Stern.

[10:56] Spike 3 is gonna be an enhancement

[10:59] more than just computing power.

[11:00] We're gonna see better light shows.

[11:02] We're gonna see some more stuff.

[11:04] And I think if we think about Spike 3 like Intel inside,

[11:07] it's gonna be the best Stern offering and platform to date.

[11:11] Will the game match up to the new platform?

[11:14] We shall see, but it makes total sense.

[11:16] Launch your new expensive platform

[11:19] with your best designer ever with a theme like King Kong.

[11:23] And you know, it's interesting.

[11:24] I think about the pinball market and I don't know, right?

[11:27] I don't know what the response is really gonna be.

[11:30] I just saw a guy selling Metallica Remastered LE.

[11:34] Let's talk about this for a second.

[11:35] When Metallica Remastered LE came out,

[11:37] only 500 units, the LE's sold out instantly at 13,000

[11:43] and people who bought them right away

[11:45] who had FOMO that missed out right away.

[11:47] And this game just came out.

[11:49] They paid 17 to $18,000.

[11:52] Now you can go get a Metallica Remastered LE for 13.4

[11:58] and it's still available.

[11:59] And right next to that 13.4 Metallica, everybody,

[12:03] are like four or five other versions of the game

[12:06] or other people selling the game for like 17, 16, 18,

[12:10] like the delusion, it's over.

[12:13] And now think about it.

[12:15] Imagine if Stern had made 1,000 Metallica Remastered LE,

[12:20] which is what people were crying about.

[12:21] I don't know, right?

[12:23] In just a few months with only 500,

[12:25] a game that's incredible, it's sliding down.

[12:28] And look, you've still made a little bit of money,

[12:31] but it's gonna keep going down.

[12:33] And that's just the state of pinball.

[12:35] Buy what you love, play what you love,

[12:38] don't look at any of these games anymore

[12:41] as collectibles or investments.

[12:43] They're just not gonna hold.

[12:45] Now, I know what you're saying,

[12:46] Gnada, you just said that Harry Potter CE

[12:50] is gonna go from 15 to 20 right away.

[12:54] And I still stand by that.

[12:57] I think it's gonna do that right away.

[12:59] Now, after Harry Potter's been out for a few months,

[13:03] do I think you're gonna get that?

[13:04] No, but for some weird reason,

[13:07] FOMO still survives only in this tiny little window.

[13:11] There's a tiny little window of FOMO left

[13:13] and it happens right away when a game initially is launched,

[13:18] has a lot of excitement and does sell out.

[13:21] Now, you gotta remember, everybody remember this.

[13:23] I don't think people realize.

[13:25] There are so many dealers and distros

[13:27] that will buy these games from the manufacturers.

[13:31] And do you really think they are allocating every single one

[13:36] of those hot titles to customers on day one?

[13:42] Some of them are gonna hold titles back.

[13:44] They're gonna hold units back.

[13:46] And then all of a sudden, voila,

[13:48] they become available again.

[13:50] A thousand at $15,000, not rare, way overpriced.

[13:58] A thousand Stearns with a topper now at $14 to $15,000.

[14:04] A Stearn with a topper that is mass produced.

[14:08] Just wait, everything's becoming so easy to get

[14:12] as I look at these D&D LE owners.

[14:14] I'm like, guys, I get it.

[14:16] But look at the D&D sort of vibe around the game, right?

[14:19] It's already sort of wearing a little thin,

[14:22] even though most of us have never played it.

[14:24] You know what I'm saying?

[14:25] Like the enthusiasm, like I get what you did over there.

[14:29] It's really unique.

[14:30] I think D&D fanatics will like it,

[14:33] but it doesn't feel like the game that's just,

[14:36] ah, yeah, can't wait to get my hands on it.

[14:39] Can't wait to save my progress and see which dungeon I'm in

[14:43] and then wake up next Sunday and have no damn clue

[14:46] which way I'm going.

[14:47] That doesn't sound like pinball to me.

[14:50] I think everybody's waiting for Potter and Kong.

[14:54] And in between, we're gonna get Cuphead.

[14:56] We're gonna get the new game from Barrels of Fun.

[14:59] We're gonna get a new Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[15:02] We're gonna get medieval madness remake.

[15:04] All this just coming out on top of each other

[15:07] over the next six months.

[15:08] We're also gonna get Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[15:11] It's funny to me.

[15:12] You know, everyone's like, oh man,

[15:13] Canade is talking about Raza.

[15:15] He's talking about how many they're gonna maybe make.

[15:18] He's talking about this screen

[15:20] and people are running to Dutch Pinball.

[15:22] Canade is talking.

[15:23] Canade, you guys are out of your minds.

[15:25] Who the heck can't put one and one together to equal two?

[15:28] Melbourne has acquired all of the games.

[15:31] He has all of it.

[15:32] Why do you think it's a surprise

[15:34] that he would bring Raza to market next?

[15:37] If you wanna make a bet, Jason Knapp,

[15:39] here's a bet I wanna make with people.

[15:41] I think Raza might actually be the next game from DPX

[15:45] in front of Back to the Future.

[15:48] I just don't think Back to the Future

[15:49] is gonna be ready until sometime mid to late of 2026.

[15:54] And I think when they realize it's gonna get delayed,

[15:57] they're gonna throw Raza on the line

[16:00] and Melbourne's gonna make Raza work.

[16:02] And they will sell 300 of them right away,

[16:06] the same way they sold all of these Alice's

[16:09] and the same way a lot of people are like,

[16:12] I don't understand, like the code's not that deep.

[16:14] The people who are buying these games

[16:16] don't care about deep code

[16:19] because if you did, you wouldn't buy these games.

[16:23] The only reason people bought these games,

[16:26] they just want something different

[16:29] and they might like women with big tatas.

[16:33] I mean, that's really it.

[16:34] You don't even get like the sexy Alice

[16:37] appearing on the screen throughout the game.

[16:40] Whatever floats your boat.

[16:42] I'm in on an Alice.

[16:43] I tell this to Melbourne all the time.

[16:45] I tell it to Melbourne every time I speak to him.

[16:47] I'm in on Alice.

[16:48] I'm near the end of the line

[16:50] and I like being near the end of the line

[16:52] because I can just wait to pay,

[16:54] see how the market shakes out.

[16:56] If I want it, I can get it.

[16:58] I know my game's not gonna be ready in 2025.

[17:01] I mean, people, let's be honest.

[17:02] There is no way they're making all 500 this year.

[17:05] I think they might make like 400 this year or 450.

[17:09] And by that time, then everybody at the end of the line

[17:13] is gonna be in the driver's seat

[17:15] because you'll be able to get a refund

[17:17] and maybe go buy it for less than it is new

[17:20] or you might just wanna go through with your purchase

[17:22] and that's great.

[17:23] Now, speaking of Dutch Pinball X,

[17:25] what's with this photo from Christopher Franti?

[17:27] Do you see this thing he just put up

[17:28] that he's gonna be at TPF with a surprise

[17:32] and he's got a curtain and you can read

[17:34] on the other side of that curtain is a Big Lebowski

[17:38] with a 25th anniversary title and different cabinet artwork.

[17:44] Now, people are like,

[17:45] oh, Franti's coming out with a Big Lebowski

[17:47] and here's what makes no sense.

[17:49] People just use Google.

[17:51] The 25th anniversary of the Big Lebowski was in 2023.

[17:57] So why would they bring out the 25th anniversary edition

[18:01] in 2025?

[18:03] Also, I don't think there's gonna be another edition

[18:06] of Lebowski ever.

[18:08] If Barry did that, he'd screw over all of his owners

[18:12] because ostensibly right now,

[18:14] anyone who has a Big Lebowski has the same game

[18:18] and they all feel good about having the same game.

[18:21] And there is somewhat limited.

[18:23] I think in total, we're talking about 1500 of these games

[18:27] will be out in the world.

[18:29] The thing is, if he makes another edition that's different

[18:33] then all of a sudden that new version becomes the Ellie

[18:38] and all the older games will lose a lot of value

[18:42] ostensibly screwing over all of those buyers.

[18:44] And I don't think that's what Barry wants to do.

[18:46] I think if you're ever gonna make different model tiers

[18:49] of a game, you gotta let everybody know day one,

[18:53] here's the plan.

[18:54] I don't like what Stern does,

[18:55] making all these new versions of games,

[18:57] making all these remakes of games,

[19:00] making Godzilla this, black and white,

[19:01] making Jaws anniversary, making this, that.

[19:04] You know, it's just annoying.

[19:05] It's annoying because in the end,

[19:07] if you buy something, regardless if you wanna keep it

[19:10] or sell it one day, you just wanna know

[19:12] like what the game is gonna be.

[19:13] You wanna know how many players are gonna be on the court

[19:16] when you start moving the goalposts,

[19:18] when you start doing weighted scoring,

[19:20] that makes no sense.

[19:21] How can you get like the most votes?

[19:23] Oh, I'm not going down that road.

[19:24] How can you get the most number one votes and still lose?

[19:26] It doesn't make any sense.

[19:27] But the world doesn't make much sense anymore.

[19:30] It doesn't make much sense, right?

[19:31] But look, I just want consumers to be as well informed

[19:36] on what the product plans are

[19:38] if they're asked to spend this much money.

[19:40] And so that's where we're at in the world of Pimble, right?

[19:43] Everyone's waiting for Potter and Kong,

[19:45] Avatar owners, you know, you're getting your games,

[19:47] I'm happy you're getting your games,

[19:48] your games are beautiful.

[19:50] I love reading the thread because it's like,

[19:52] they don't have any modes to talk about.

[19:54] They're not talking about magical moments.

[19:57] They're just talking about how the game like shoots kind of

[20:00] well and it's beautiful.

[20:01] And that's kind of it.

[20:02] It's kind of it.

[20:03] Go into the Avatar thread and watch how no one talks

[20:06] about magical moments or modes that are awesome.

[20:11] None of that.

[20:12] You know where I'm seeing all of that?

[20:14] In the evil dead thread.

[20:17] Did you see like Ben Heck and him talk about

[20:20] what's going into this game?

[20:21] What's already in this game?

[20:24] And what I love about evil dead,

[20:25] I again go into the thread, the vibe, the excitement,

[20:30] the discussion around what's actually in the game,

[20:34] the discussion around the modes that are super creative,

[20:38] the discussion around the multi-balls that are awesome

[20:41] and feel rewarding, the discussion around the art,

[20:44] the discussion around what's to come,

[20:47] the discussion around the theme integration.

[20:49] You're just not seeing that in Avatar.

[20:52] And look, I know Jersey Jack is gonna sell more Avatar

[20:54] CEs and LEs, but man, I really feel for you guys

[20:57] because once Potter comes out,

[20:59] you're basically gonna be holding on to the biggest

[21:02] sinking asset in a long time in Pimbo.

[21:05] I mean it.

[21:06] And I look, I'm not telling you,

[21:07] and this is what makes me so, it pains me because I know

[21:11] if you're loving your Avatar game right now,

[21:13] let's just say you bought your CE for 15,000

[21:18] and you're loving it.

[21:19] What if I told you you could love it just as much

[21:23] in six months and get that game for $10,000?

[21:28] Why would you choose Option A?

[21:30] That's just where we're at in Pimbo, everybody.

[21:34] All right, so we've got Avatar CEs.

[21:36] Once they get made, we're gonna get Harry Potter

[21:38] sometime April, May.

[21:40] I know that Jersey Jack wants to get Potter out before Kong.

[21:44] I just don't think they're going to.

[21:46] I feel like they're gonna wait too long

[21:48] and these two games are gonna crash on top of each other.

[21:52] And I think Elwyn is gonna win the battle.

[21:55] I do.

[21:55] I just don't think Jersey Jack is gonna knock it

[21:59] out of the park.

[22:00] I want them to, but their track record isn't great.

[22:04] Gang, it is gonna be one of the most exciting

[22:08] four months in Pimbo when we look at what's about to drop.

[22:12] We've got a few weeks to get there.

[22:14] Canade is gonna keep you entertained.

[22:16] Don't worry.

[22:17] I've got my hernia surgery in two days.

[22:19] That's not gonna stop me.

[22:21] People making fun of me is not gonna stop me.

[22:23] I love it.

[22:24] I actually love it all.

[22:25] And for those of you out there,

[22:27] I really wanna thank a couple of people.

[22:28] I wanna thank Ed Robertson for sending me

[22:31] one of the nicest notes I've received in a long time.

[22:35] Ed, I can't tell you how much talking to you

[22:39] and we don't do it all the time,

[22:41] but I just love how thoughtful Ed is

[22:45] and how caring he is and what a great heart he has.

[22:49] And he also says something really nice about Electric Bat

[22:53] and how Kale's podcast gives a really interesting

[22:57] perspective on Pimbo.

[22:58] And I 100% agree with that.

[23:01] He's talking about this hobby

[23:03] through the lens of an operator.

[23:05] And that's interesting.

[23:07] I talk about this hobby in a different way.

[23:10] To me, it's also very interesting

[23:12] and that's what we need more of.

[23:13] I don't have any ill will towards Kale or Electric Bat.

[23:18] Kale and I are friends.

[23:19] Like we hung out the most

[23:21] when I was at Jersey Jack's Avatar reveal.

[23:23] My issue is just more with like, you know,

[23:25] the weighted stuff and the committee

[23:27] that always was moving to goalposts

[23:29] so that I would one day lose.

[23:30] And they got their way.

[23:31] Congratulations, everybody.

[23:33] Canada lost.

[23:34] Congratulations.

[23:35] The goalposts are now at the 30 yard line.

[23:37] Okay, so I wanna thank you, Ed, for that kind note.

[23:40] I also wanna thank Grant, who works at Jersey Jack

[23:44] and he did the music and the sound for Avatar.

[23:48] And he's like, Chris, you gotta remember, you know,

[23:50] a lot of us put in a lot of hard work.

[23:52] And he's like, I understand exactly how you feel

[23:55] when you feel like you put in so much effort

[23:59] and, you know, it doesn't always get appreciated

[24:01] and recognized.

[24:02] And I'm like, oh man, this is like gutting me

[24:05] because I've been gutting this game

[24:07] and there's been a team of people that worked really hard

[24:09] and care a lot about what they do.

[24:12] Gets put into a game that doesn't get praised.

[24:15] How do you think they feel?

[24:17] And Grant, thank you so much for opening my mind

[24:20] to that reality.

[24:21] It's sometimes really easy to forget

[24:24] about all the hardworking people

[24:26] that put in a lot of work and they never get an award.

[24:29] They never get accolades or appreciation.

[24:32] Now that being said, Grant,

[24:34] yeah, guys gotta put toys in these things.

[24:36] Come on, man, like you guys work over there.

[24:38] I get you're doing the sound

[24:40] and, you know, Keith wants to make this

[24:42] like diner menu rule set.

[24:44] Everyone's gotta get into a room

[24:46] before you put in all that effort

[24:48] and be like, it's really easy, gang,

[24:51] to make a masterpiece pinball machine

[24:54] if we just do the following things.

[24:57] I'm not gonna say what they are right now.

[24:58] Let's not overbake the code.

[25:00] Let's not have like the same sort of

[25:03] sterile multi-balls happening all throughout the game.

[25:06] Let's theme integrate.

[25:08] Let's sync up the voices with the clips.

[25:10] It's all there.

[25:10] It's all there.

[25:11] You just gotta put it together in the right way.

[25:14] Everybody, Brenda is behind me.

[25:16] You know what I loved about everything this week

[25:19] is everyone was saying that Brenda

[25:22] is the real king of the household.

[25:25] Brenda is the smart one.

[25:27] Brenda's got three babies she's gotta deal with.

[25:30] She knows all of this.

[25:32] She's telling me to get up.

[25:33] She's got a call in five minutes

[25:35] and she needs to put her other baby in another room.

[25:39] His name is Kaneda.

[25:40] And everybody, thank you so much.

[25:42] We're gonna keep rocking and rolling.

[25:43] I love it.

[25:44] Have a great day.

[25:45] We'll talk to you soonish.

[25:46] My surgery's Friday.

[25:48] So this might be the last show before that surgery

[25:50] but you'll get something next week.

[25:52] And again, no Saturday show.

[25:53] Keep rocking and rolling

[25:54] and up your subscription amounts everybody.

[25:56] I'm joking but I'm not.

[25:57] Later.

[25:58] Beautiful day.

[26:02] Don't let it get away.

[26:05] It's a beautiful day.

[26:13] Touch me.

[26:16] Take me to that other place.

[26:20] Teach me.

[26:24] I know I'm not an overspaced.
