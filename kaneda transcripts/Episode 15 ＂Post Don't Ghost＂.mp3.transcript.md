[00:00] Come on, come on give me a break. I promise you'll never see me again. I promise.

[00:13] It's the pinball podcast that some people wish would just go away. It's Canadian's pinball podcast.

[00:20] Number 15 coming at you from New York City. We're gonna talk three things tonight.

[00:25] We're gonna talk about Mini-Belmannas remake. I got a little bit of a scoop about what's been going on with one of the issues that's hit that machine.

[00:33] I want to give my just quick opinions about the latest Alien pinball play field reveal.

[00:40] But I want to start off this evening with one topic that's just been sort of spreading through various threads on Pinside.

[00:49] And that's just about people's accounts and sub thread ejections and people deactivating their accounts and all that drama surrounding it.

[00:59] And we're gonna start tonight's podcast without topic.

[01:02] What we've got here is failure to communicate. I don't like it anymore than you may.

[01:13] It's hard to talk about this topic. And I think some of you out there might think I'm the last person who can incredibly give their opinion about this.

[01:23] But if we take a step back and look at what we're all doing, for the most part, we're all grown men.

[01:32] We're all grown men who spend a decent amount of time away from our friends, our family, our co-workers to go on a message board, a forum, and talk about pinball.

[01:46] We talk about pinball, which is a hobby. It's something we do for recreation.

[01:51] And within that hobby and within that forum, Pinside has a lot of different personalities, has a lot of different characters, has a lot of different subjects, has a lot of different people coming from all sorts of socioeconomic backgrounds.

[02:07] So it's this melting pot that is coming together to talk about pinball.

[02:14] And it's a forum, guys. It's an internet forum. If you come onto an internet forum and you think it's gonna be a place where people are not sharing opinions and speculating on things, then ding, ding, ding, guys.

[02:30] Welcome to the internet. Welcome to the inner webs. This is what happens.

[02:37] And look, there are people out there who say, oh, Pinside should be a place where we scrub it clean of people who are creating drama and causing issues.

[02:52] And let's look at how people are empowered to create the Pinside that they want.

[03:02] You can go on the Pinside and you can ignore people. If you don't like me, if you disagree with me, if you disagree with someone else and you disagree with their opinion, you can put that person on ignore.

[03:16] It's plain and simple. Now, personally, I know that a lot of people have me on ignore and that's fine. That's cool.

[03:26] I don't chase down people who have me on ignore and try to get them to lift the ban. I try ignoring some people at one point.

[03:37] And I'll tell you what happened. And I've heard this from a lot of people. When you ignore someone on Pinside, it's more annoying to have them on ignore than it is to just hear what they have to say.

[03:48] Because when you're following the thread, it just keeps coming up, ignored user post. And what good is that? And then people are responding to that person.

[03:56] And then you're just you're catching only a fraction of the conversation. So it doesn't really give the end user the benefit they're looking for

[04:06] because they just get frustrated that the conversation is so broken up. But here's the thing. And in all honesty, guys, if you're on Pinside and you're a grown adult and you're a man, and you you can't stomach with someone is saying about pinball or about you on a pinball form, then then you need to put your big boy pants on and come back to Pinside.

[04:32] I got to be honest here. I mean, what is anybody really said that has been that terrible that it made you be like, I don't ever want to hear another thing you say ever again. And that's that.

[04:44] And there are some people with their with their with you know with their next on the line and you got people like artists like oric or showing their artwork and he might get crapped on.

[04:58] But that's that's the risk you take whenever you put anything you create up for a for analysis by a community like Pinside. But but I'm on a lot of message boards and I know a lot of you guys are.

[05:11] And at the end of the day, a message board is is is much better when you allow opposing opinions to take place.

[05:21] If you ban everyone from Jersey Jack pinball threads whose disagrees with Jersey Jack's business practice is her questions what Jack is doing.

[05:31] What do you have then just a page full of people who all think the same look.

[05:38] I am not defending trollish behavior and I will be the first to admit that there are times when I definitely go overboard and I definitely start trolling a thread and I and I shouldn't.

[05:49] And I maybe derail a topic a little bit but but so white.

[05:55] And if when I do that you know what I get I get people telling me to stop being a troll I get tons of down votes and and I and I'm in the conversation goes back to normal.

[06:07] It goes back to it's originally brought you know scheduled broadcast in a matter of post and and so this whole notion and I got to be honest when I read this this thread today that popped up that's that was all about the moderators ability now to eject.

[06:24] People from subject forms right so I have.

[06:31] Currently been.

[06:34] I get it I don't think what I wrote was that inflammatory about J.J.P. I think I was saying what other people were saying and I was actually kind of saying if you read the thread that got me a Jack did I wasn't really being too harsh and I was actually just saying like maybe we should just all wait to mid march until the hobbit ships and like hold our hold our opinions to then.

[07:02] And if doesn't ship them then I think all hell might break loose but whatever fine I don't have a hobbit pre ordered I can get why people who go into those threads looking for.

[07:12] Updates or information might might be annoyed and fine I'll stop I'll stop going to those threads and and that's fine but here's the thing if you go into the thread that came up today the the subform a Jack poll which if we look at the poll.

[07:27] Yes overwhelmingly 64% said it's about time that there's a subform a Jack's so what does that mean you're you're mean you're going to permanently boot people who are trolling a certain topic and then I'm fine with that you know I really if it's gotten that bad and there's someone needs to go they need to go but there's an underlying agenda that is that you can read in this thread because I was I I was ejected for a day for this thread just by making a joke.

[07:56] I just made a joke and all I said was I basically came on there and saying hey like this is a good thing I was ejected from the J.J.P. you know subject forms and and and and and and rightfully so and then so some guy took my post quoted me.

[08:15] And I made a joke responding to him saying oh you want me to talk about J.J.P. and I was booted for day for that okay see I'm on I'm on guys I'm on thin ice more than anyone else and I and I get it like I'm going to be treated differently than most people but what's happening on this thread if you know what I'm even out of it I can't even post it and it there's been three pages today of a lot of back and forth and it seems that some people on here.

[08:45] They have an agenda and their agenda is crystal clear they are pinpointing all of pin sides problems onto me a lot of people flat out come out and say it was much better around here when can it was not on the inside and look at what he's done look at what he's done to the inside and I just don't buy that I it's

[09:08] can I respond because I never can I can't really respond anymore on the site itself because when I get into these discussions I either immediately get ejected or my my entire existence is in jeopardy because I can't even defend myself anymore but I can let a million people take cheap shots at me and call me all sorts of names now let me let me say something guys I've been called every name in the book people come at me every which way and and what do I come on there and do I personally insult

[09:38] any of you find me a post where I personally insult any of you and and you know I don't think you're going to find it I don't PM people threats I don't make it you know I was I got someone a few weeks ago told me to drink bleach and told me to go F myself on a PM right I mean this is someone telling me that and I have thick enough skin to realize that this is just an internet form and everyone is acting a lot tougher

[10:07] than they would in real life and you know so I'm not going anywhere guys I don't plan to go anywhere and I don't think I should have to go anywhere if you can deal with some of the things I say then just put me on ignore if you don't want to be part of my threads just drain my threads what I what I find so hypocritical is the people who come in a thread I start they come into the threads that I created and they troll it and they derail it guys I have had a

[10:37] put up three or four now different canators pinball podcast threads why because people came into my topic into my discussion trolled it to all hell and and got it locked how far is that to me it wasn't like the moderators came in and moderated people or kick people out of my thread they just locked me down completely but you know it I don't care guys it's just a forum about pinball don't take it so seriously really

[11:07] people need to just relax and and what I find so hysterical is that one of the guys who's the most outspoken and most hyperactive on pin side you know is our very own friend Mr. Rare Hero and did you see what happened today to Mr. Rare Hero the man who who is very strident with his language towards others the man who is always in debates and I

[11:37] love reading his stuff I love watching him go back and forth with people what happened to him today he basically got called out for being what he claims other people are he got called out for being a troll by by trace lifter and and what did he do he immediately deactivated his account why why I mean really I know that rare hero

[12:07] must love coming on pin side because he's on it so much I know he must love posting I know it must be a big part of his life is that community and just because some guy called you a name you're gonna deactivate really and when we say like I hear a lot of people say oh canada you're such a narcissist you're such a baby you're such an attention or are you kidding me like I take so many shots I take so many arrows in the back

[12:37] and you can call me whatever you want guys I don't care I'm not gonna leave I'm not gonna stop being in the pinball I'm not gonna stop having this dialogue you know if people call me a D-bag they call me a troll I am I gonna just deactivate my account you know we all should have thick enough skin to be able to go into a pinball form and not get to the point where you're like pulling a rare hero you know I just think it's really really I gotta say this I think it's lame of him

[13:06] to just pack up and leave because he was called the name especially someone who's who's called many people many things on pin side and I hope he doesn't leave I hope he comes back you know and actually I overheard a conversation

[13:20] of you know low peg gave him a call and and and here's what I overheard him saying to to rare hero are you got a buck up here Todd boat who cares how much more talented he may be than you if he cries you cry harder

[13:36] man that's right rare hero do not quit now it is not the right time to quit and here's another thing that I that I found funny about this whole thing is you know I've been in meetings all day and and and and I'm working on something where we might

[13:52] actually be doing another program with guns and roses I can't say who that's with I don't know if that's going to shake up I'm putting together ideas trying to sell a

[13:59] transformer's idea like I got those cool shit going on and and I get this text about rare hero quitting and I'm just thinking to myself all this drama all this

[14:12] tension all this bickering it's happening during working hours like it's it's Thursday in the middle of the work day and what the hell are all of us doing seriously

[14:26] I assume most of us have like jobs and work to do and more importance to do than all day long being on pinstite but yet we all find the time for it and we all love it but that's the thing it's like these guys are fighting and it's like

[14:42] 2 30 in the afternoon on a Thursday and that's the time rare hero you're gonna you're gonna wave the white flag and call it quits I mean we all we all should practice the art

[14:55] of just chilling the f out and stop going on there so much take it from someone who who who will self I admit it myself you lose control if you're in that site too long and too many hours because you know why there's not enough

[15:14] shit to talk about so we start shit talking let me repeat that there's not enough shit to really talk about so we start shit talking

[15:24] you put a bunch of grown men and someone said it best after enough time everyone to start to act like kids in a kindergarten class and the teacher has to separate us I mean imagine if there were no mods

[15:37] imagine if there were no mods and we were naturally all allowed to talk to each other in an unedited unmoderated unpoliced manner

[15:48] think about that for a second even though it's pinball it would be a complete shit show and I you know I think one of the reasons why

[15:57] pinside gets so dramatic at times and there's so much back and forth besides the fact there's just isn't an

[16:04] not enough news to keep things moving you know besides the fact that people have you know thousands of dollars tied up in these toys

[16:12] and and and people love to dig and rub it in that hey you might not get it and you might not get it on time and it's not going to be as good as you thought it was

[16:20] you know it's so easy to troll that kind of stuff but I think the other thing is is I think that is this notion that when you're on

[16:28] pinside you just love all pinball and you love anything going on in pinball I don't think that's true right I think people have definite

[16:38] companies they like and companies they don't like people have styles of pinball they like they have styles of pinball they don't like there's a you know it's

[16:46] I'm going to use a cargument right here but I'm on the Dodge

[16:51] Charger the and the challenger and Hellcat forums right so I'm on the Hellcat forum when you go to the Hellcat forum

[16:57] it is mostly Hellcat owners who talk about their Hellcats you get the occasional Ford

[17:04] fanboy who comes in and is like the new Shelby is going to beat your Hellcat but for the most part there's not fighting there's not

[17:11] bickering because people are locked in on a singular thing and it's the same thing in his very specific but I'm

[17:19] pinside you know we have people who love Stern people who love JJP people who are in on highway people are in on

[17:27] Dutch and yes some people love them all some people can't wait to see what come you know what comes out of all

[17:34] those companies I you know I think we all can't wait to see what comes out of all those companies but we all have

[17:39] strong opinions on each of those companies and how they're run and that's what creates a lot of the drama a lot of

[17:47] the opinions a lot of the speculation you know it's almost like having a forum where you just we love cars

[17:53] and then there's a thread for Ford there's a thread for Dodge there's a thread for you know Chevy

[18:00] and no wonder there's going to be a lot of cross pollinating and bickering that goes on

[18:05] but it's pinside guys it's the best pinball forum on the planet

[18:10] Robin and team do an amazing job with that site and I don't know what else you could ask for

[18:18] they eject people when they need to be ejected they they close threads when it when it's really got

[18:23] an off topic they've allowed all of us to create 80 plus pages of nonsense on ghost busters

[18:30] you know we all should donate to them and donate today I said it everyone should donate the price

[18:35] of a movie ticket make that an iMacs movie ticket to pinside every month because it gives us more

[18:40] hours of entertainment than anything else probably for for I'm talking to you hyper users I'm

[18:45] talking to all you guys so look I want to close this topic by saying this if you want me to leave

[18:52] pinside it's not going to happen the only thing that the only person that can make canada leave

[18:57] pinside is me I either have to do something completely stupid that that makes me uh bannable

[19:04] by the moderation step and look if you think that the Kylo Ren duplicate account that I made is

[19:10] ban worthy I mean come on guys people create like duplicate accounts for malicious reasons I created

[19:16] that and post it like like a few times that were completely innocuous and I deactivated it and when

[19:21] they asked me I said yeah I was stupid I don't know why I even did it like it's down like okay and

[19:25] that was banned for like three weeks for doing that and then it was like why is he back it should have

[19:29] been a permanent ban relax guys relax if you don't like me you can ignore me if you don't like this

[19:35] podcast you don't have to listen to it um but I think everyone should put their big boy pants on

[19:40] be grown man go on a pinball form and hash it out call each other names talk about pinball it's

[19:47] no big deal guys it's no big deal there's a lot more important stuff in this world we all should

[19:52] be thinking about nothing should be making a grown man like rear hero throw it a temper tantrum

[19:57] in a hissy fit and run away like a little kid like that I mean are you kidding me where it's a pinball

[20:02] form guys are you know our thoughts and prayers should be going out to make bowdak who's struggling

[20:06] every day just to get back all of his his uh you know his motor skills and his memory and there's

[20:12] all these more important things going on the world there's all there's all these more important things

[20:15] going on each of our personal lives we all have families we all have much more pressing and important

[20:20] issues that we're dealing with and do not let pinso I'd be the thing that aggravates you and stresses

[20:26] you out seriously take learn to take it all with a grain of salt you see only way you can deal with

[20:32] like the real hard shit that you're gonna deal with in life all right and that's that and I want

[20:36] I'm gonna move on to to what's going on in the world the medieval madness remakes we have tough men

[20:42] working on it right now who tough men all right medieval madness remake uh it has been

[20:54] experiencing an issue and I want to recap quickly for the listener what has been going on so

[21:02] uh medieval madness uh sold by planetary pinball uh playfield made by Chicago gaming company

[21:12] cgc uh it seems that some of the playfield ink the black ink which appears over the inserts is a

[21:21] little transparent on some of the playfields and and when you shine the light from underneath it

[21:26] you can see through the black text so uh it looks like the area that is most uh adversely affected is

[21:33] the five white inserts where it says king of pain and and the various inserts around that

[21:39] and so what's happened and I was trying to get some people on to talk about this some of the

[21:45] the actual mmr owners who are experiencing the issue to get them to give me their opinion and

[21:52] and universally heard across the board that they want to see where things ended out but I

[21:56] was given some some insight into the situation from some of the owners who wanted to talk to me

[22:03] off the record and I want to just sort of communicate what I've been told so you guys can be

[22:07] better informed about what the situation currently is so it seems that you know people have been

[22:16] sort of derailing the thread the the a lot of the conversations been taking place in the in the

[22:23] mmr unboxing thread because you know now if you're unboxing an mmr you're anxiously waiting to see

[22:30] what your inserts look like and that hasn't been an issue and it wasn't something people really looking

[22:35] for and now it seems to be this this panic that happens when people look at their inserts and they

[22:41] think that there's our below quality and and transparent and it's not the way they want their mmr to be

[22:48] and no one's been given a full refund no one's been giving money back no one's been giving any of

[22:54] that there's been speculation that that has happened and I wanted to say that that hasn't happened

[23:00] and the origins of that speculation seem to have arisen when someone just said to another person

[23:08] who is accepting their game that you should really accept you know accept the game and and play it

[23:14] because it's it's just a great game and and and don't let the insert uh situation make you not

[23:21] want to even receive the game itself and and and and there's been a lot of criticism of of

[23:27] Rick and pps and and I know Rick deactivated his account he's he's on that list of people who

[23:33] just couldn't take it anymore the abuse he was getting and I know that Chicago gaming company is

[23:40] is going to look at each of these on a case by case basis and they're going to make a decision on

[23:46] whether or not the some of the playfields fell below their quality standards and they will figure

[23:52] out a remedy right now they've uh the fix that they've said that they're going to give out is

[23:59] it seems to be an electrical fix where they're going to offer an insert dimming feature on the

[24:06] software then this may or may not work for everyone but they want to see if this helps

[24:12] address the problems on on some of the machines so I think that's that's a fair place to start that

[24:18] you know if we can you know work with the lighting a little bit it might make those inserts look

[24:23] better uh and then you know they also they ask for people to to share with them photos of

[24:34] of their playfields to see if you know how bad each person's inserts were but before I get to

[24:39] that I want to I want to talk about something else someone did someone put up a a playfield from the

[24:48] original medieval man as I that was made by CPR that was printed eight years ago next to the new

[24:54] MMR and the inserts were identical as far as the opaqueness was concerned so so it this this may

[25:02] mean that you know there's not like this there's there's not like all this huge bad batch of them

[25:08] out there um now they did say that there might be a few a few that have fallen below their standards

[25:15] and they will address those on a case by case basis but here's the problem um they have told people

[25:22] to open up a ticket and share a picture of their machine so that they can address the issue right on

[25:31] a case by case basis now here's what's happening here's what's happening some of them yes the some

[25:38] of the few very few that might have an issue have pictures that clearly show that that there is

[25:44] you know a serious uh you know quality problem with the ink and so those people's photos have made

[25:54] it their way on to pin side and what's happened is CG CGC has seen now that as people are opening up

[26:03] tickets they're starting to to see the same pictures used for different tickets okay so people

[26:11] are taking the most extreme pictures where it looks bad and they're saying this is my machine

[26:18] what are you gonna do like everyone's got their hand out now for some sort of return or money or

[26:25] or wants compensation and they're lying about that being their machine

[26:32] what I mean what do you do now if you're if you're if you're you know CGC and now you've just got

[26:41] you don't know whose machine is who and you've you got everyone with their hands out I mean I think

[26:47] this is a big big problem for them and I don't know how they're gonna solve it and I think it's

[26:54] unfortunate that I think the people that are doing that that are using other people's images and

[27:00] opening tickets are it should be ashamed of themselves how can you do that how can you really

[27:07] you know these guys are trying to create a a solve they're trying to fix an issue they're trying

[27:12] to actually help the people who might have a really bad issue with their machine and now you know

[27:19] what's to stop CGC and PPS from just saying you know F it we're gonna we're gonna stop dealing with

[27:26] all this like this is the machine and you know I don't think they're gonna do that I think they're

[27:31] committed to this but they're they're definitely now they're they're now frustrated and that they're

[27:37] now between a rock and a hard place and and and and what to do with the fix here so we're gonna

[27:42] keep covering this topic as an unfolds because I do want to hear what happens to those owners who

[27:50] have legitimate tickets I want to hear what the solve is it's this is this is an interesting one

[27:54] are they gonna are they gonna replace playfields or they're gonna send people populated playfields

[27:59] so let's follow this thread and we'll keep reporting on it and if you want to talk to me about it

[28:05] please hit me up either on Pinside or canada pinball at gmail.com K-a-n-e-d-a pinball at gmail.com

[28:14] and and if you look if you're and and if you're one of the people that are sending false images just stop

[28:20] if you know someone is doing that just stop let these guys provide customer service and be

[28:25] fair to them just be fair to them all right so we're gonna we're gonna have one more topic tonight

[28:31] and this is a topic that I I didn't think I was gonna talk about for a while and then

[28:36] something happened and I think I want to talk about it again and that is aliens playfield has been

[28:44] clear coded I'm gonna do a warning announcement that if you do not want to hear canada say anything

[28:54] negative about alien or highway pinball now is a good time to close out the podcast I will give

[29:03] you two seconds to do so all right for the rest of you let's go so I I I've been critical about

[29:13] aliens playfield before I did a whole thing on Ripley gate and not having the likeness of the

[29:20] characters and how that I feel that hurts the theme and the ability to integrate the theme

[29:25] into the overall package and and look I don't even really want to take another swing at this thing

[29:34] but what I want to do is just once again point out the way these guys deliver updates and and

[29:43] and and and just I wish I could they would just listen to this podcast and and and I wish they

[29:49] would just like just stop and wait and and reveal stuff in a proper manner so for those of you who

[29:56] haven't seen we've already seen what the alien playfield looks like there and we we were teased

[30:04] about a week ago that the test playfield had been clear coded and we were gonna see them the fact

[30:11] that clear coding of playfield has become a super exciting thing to see just shows how little

[30:20] news we've had lately on Pinside I mean everyone's been waiting for Ghostbusters and something

[30:25] real to happen for Spider-Man VE to ship nothing's really happening so you clear coded it you're the

[30:33] king of the world that day so Andrew highway clear codes to playfield any reveals it and you know

[30:40] it's the playfield we saw yeah there was a few changes here and there it looks nice and shiny it's

[30:45] been clear coded I'm still not a fan of the playfield though I it looks like a bunch of clip art is

[30:54] just dropped on to this black canvas I don't I don't know how anyone can get excited by just this

[31:03] clip art drop that is the alien playfield but but again if you're in on it and you're excited and

[31:09] you think that's the best and representation of alien and aliens then I'm happy I'm happy for you

[31:16] I when I look at the little leak image of the zombie Eddie Ghostbusters art there's more detail

[31:24] and drawing in in just a six inch square of Ghostbusters playfield and there is in the entire

[31:32] aliens art package when I I'm talking drawing I'm talking taking a pen to paper and drawing

[31:38] something original so it is what it is but here's here's the part that just it just makes me laugh

[31:44] what I watch these guys I mean Andrew and Orrick are like burdenernie when it comes to marketing

[31:51] and revealing this pinball machine it's like they don't even like talk to each other so why would

[31:55] they do this so he the Andrew shows the clear coded playfield and what happens you have Orrick the

[32:05] artist who and and and this is these are like test runs right you're supposed to print them

[32:10] see what they look like show them to your artist and he's gonna say oh wait that section looks a

[32:15] little too dark that didn't print the way I wanted it to and it looks like there were sections of

[32:20] the playfield that were just that like Orrick was saying oh it printed out too dark oh like the

[32:25] inserts the white didn't come out right so why why is Andrew like revealing these things when

[32:34] they're not even like their test runs there aren't even really approved by the guys doing the art

[32:40] it's like they're like talking to each other it on the forum and and this is again it's not a big deal

[32:48] it's just I just find it so funny it's like these guys don't understand no one cares do people

[32:54] really care about a clear code on an unpopulated playfield that's how you're gonna like build excitement

[33:00] for the game I think I saw like one dingleberry be like oh yeah now I'm gonna go in on the

[33:05] elite what did you think it was not gonna have clear code like nothing really changed but now that

[33:11] you saw the clear on it oh now I'm in I mean come on guys it's getting it's getting pretty ridiculous

[33:16] at this point my advice to all the companies that are new that want to get people excited they

[33:22] need to stop with these like piece by piece reveals it it's just not the way to do it and and we

[33:31] we've seen like the schematic of aliens we know like where the toys are what the shot layout is

[33:36] now we've seen the playfield art screw the toys on populate it and show it but here even one

[33:46] better guys don't even do that just be like we're gonna take the pinball machine the Texas pinball

[33:51] festival we're gonna reveal it there I'd be happy with that instead of all these like little I

[33:57] mean yeah these things they don't hurt there's like no harm no foul stuff but I just constantly

[34:01] finding funny I have a pre-order money down on alien Ellie I really want to see how this pin

[34:09] shapes you know shapes what a shape's up to be I I don't know I'm on the fence I'm not blown away

[34:17] I think that people are nervous to give their opinions about it I think if stern released

[34:24] alien art and released this playfield you guys would be tearing stern apart you're so nice to

[34:31] oric I know he's a nice guy and a buddy to a lot of you guys but come on it's just clip our dropped

[34:38] on this thing but look I hope when it's all populated it all comes together I'll say this after

[34:44] playing so many pinball machines that at sunshine laundromat and brooklyn the other day it's hard

[34:51] enough on pinball machines that have dark playfield to see the ball I don't know that thing is the

[34:58] darkest playfield I've ever seen so we'll see how it all comes together I hope you know the final

[35:03] reveal happens soon that's gonna be it for episode 15 of Candice pinball podcast I want to close

[35:09] on this note I want everyone who's angry and upset and stressed out about pinside to just

[35:18] relax just take a deep breath and realize you know step away from it a little bit we all should

[35:25] zoom out and look at the world it's a pinball forum yes we're gonna get heated yes we're gonna

[35:32] get into baits yes we're gonna call each other names because that's what grown men do who talk

[35:37] about their toys but don't let it get to the point where you have to quit run away or deactivate

[35:44] you know rare hero rob tea I feel bad because those guys are really they're gonna they're gonna

[35:50] like they're gonna miss out on something that also brings them a lot of pleasure and if you are

[35:55] annoyed by me if you are if you can't stand me then just simply ignore me that is the freedom you

[36:01] have you're the freedom to do that you have the freedom to listen to this podcast or not

[36:20] you know someone who's like they can't stand that guy come on let's talk about it let's talk
