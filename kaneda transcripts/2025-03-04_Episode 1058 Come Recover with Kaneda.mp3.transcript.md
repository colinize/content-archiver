[00:00] Take your time to wear a long-dolicky smile when you realize it.

[00:03] Have I said magical words?

[00:04] Just to try to figure out what all this is for.

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:12] Welcome, everybody, to a sort of special edition of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[00:17] because I am in bed right now.

[00:19] It is 3.30 in the morning.

[00:22] And this sort of reminds me of my original Pinball Podcast I did years ago,

[00:28] like 10 years ago.

[00:30] I used to be in bed.

[00:31] I wasn't even dating Brenda at the time.

[00:34] And I would put on a USB headset and talk about Pinball.

[00:38] And Canadian Spinball Podcast would talk about topics that nobody else would address.

[00:43] We would be a little bit too strident.

[00:46] We'd be going after people with personal attacks left and right.

[00:50] We warned everybody to get their money out of highway pinball.

[00:54] It was good times.

[00:55] There was maybe five or six Pinball Podcasts.

[00:58] Now there's like 28 or 40 of them.

[01:01] There's like 95 YouTube content creators.

[01:05] But it's all good.

[01:06] I wake up and I'm just happy I'm not in too much pain.

[01:09] And so just to fill some of you in, I had a hernia surgery on Friday morning.

[01:14] And if you've ever had a hernia surgery, there's two ways they can do it.

[01:17] They can go from the outside in or inside and do the procedure.

[01:22] The inside procedure is less painful.

[01:26] The recovery is not as bad.

[01:28] I thought that's what I was having only to wake up to seeing just one incision in my

[01:35] lower right groin area.

[01:37] And basically what they do people is they cut through your abdomen and they put in mesh

[01:43] and they seal you up so that your like bowels don't push through your abdomen.

[01:49] It feels like getting stabbed with a hot knife when you move around.

[01:54] Now to mitigate the pain, you take something that is strong.

[01:58] So I was on like Percocet.

[02:00] I've got OxyCode in.

[02:01] The only problem is when you take those really strong pain killers and they do the job, but

[02:07] they constipate you and bloat you horrible.

[02:11] Your whole stomach like balloons up.

[02:13] You can't go to the bathroom and you're in like pain from that.

[02:17] So I made the decision yesterday.

[02:19] I'm going to get to pinball.

[02:20] Trust me.

[02:20] I made the decision yesterday to sort of wean off of the pain killers.

[02:26] Get a bow movement, which I was more excited to have a bow movement than I was to see the

[02:30] final wizard mode in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[02:33] And now I felt better because of all of that.

[02:36] But I will say being off of the pain killers for 24 hours now, I'm starting to feel a sort

[02:43] of discomfort all day long, but I'm going to power through it.

[02:46] It's three in the morning and I want to do a pinball podcast because it's March and it's

[02:51] a new month.

[02:52] And you know me, I never want to stop giving you content about pinball.

[02:55] So here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[02:58] We're going to go around the horn, talk about some news items.

[03:01] I've done what?

[03:03] 1050 something pinball podcast.

[03:06] So it's nice to be sort of leaning up against the backboard in bed.

[03:10] I'm not looking at anything really.

[03:12] I'm just thinking about what's been going on.

[03:14] I've been reading pin side.

[03:16] I've been going into some club threads.

[03:18] But before I get started, I do want to give a huge shout out to someone who's a listener

[03:23] of the show, someone who I did not give a shout out to when I gave a shout out to the

[03:29] electric bat podcast for winning favorite pinball podcast.

[03:34] Kale is an amazing dude.

[03:35] I was talking to him yesterday.

[03:36] We've been friends before the Twippies and we will be friends long after the Twippies,

[03:42] but I did not give a shout out to the creator and the better half of Kale's world.

[03:47] And that is Rachel, who actually is his wife, his partner.

[03:51] She runs the arcade with him and she actually created the electric bat podcast.

[03:56] So Rachel, thank you so much.

[03:58] And for those of you out there, give electric battle.

[04:00] Listen, because it is a radically different show than this.

[04:03] They talk about, they talk about pinball through the lens of an operator.

[04:08] And it's really interesting to hear about how games are doing on location because that's

[04:14] an area of like pinball content that is under serviced.

[04:18] I mean, there's enough blowhard loser, egomaniac, narcissistic sociopaths that are running around

[04:24] on Facebook live mailing everybody their crappy t-shirts.

[04:28] There's enough of those dudes out there, but there's not many people out there that are

[04:32] giving you the perspective from an operator.

[04:35] And you know, I love an operator's perspective.

[04:38] Whenever I would go to Jack Barr and talk to John, it was always really interesting

[04:42] to hear the game everybody hates, Toy Story 4, is killing it on location.

[04:48] It also reminds each and every one of us that these games were always meant to do well on

[04:52] location.

[04:53] They weren't meant to do well in your home.

[04:56] If you think about it, like every single pinball machine that ends up in your home is losing

[05:01] money is in a location it was not designed to be.

[05:05] So it's kind of ridiculous, right, that this product that was always designed to bring

[05:09] enjoyment out in the world ended up in a bunch of multi-millionaire, cranky alcoholic homes

[05:15] who have to go on pinside every day and complain about every single element of the game.

[05:19] I'm joking.

[05:20] A lot of you out there are not alcoholics.

[05:22] A lot of you out there are not multi-millionaires.

[05:25] And a lot of you out there just love pinball.

[05:27] And I have to say, after watching everything going on in the world, I'm not going to get

[05:31] political.

[05:32] I'm just going to say this.

[05:33] I'm happy we have pinball.

[05:35] Because the world always feels like lately.

[05:37] Everything is just being lit on fire.

[05:40] And there's so much drama and tension everywhere you look.

[05:44] Every day you wake up, there's new headlines about how the sky is falling.

[05:48] It's nice that we can just land on pinball, which feels like somewhat of a solid foundation

[05:54] for friendship, for community, for getting together to talk about stuff.

[05:58] Alright, so, Kanata, what's going on in the pinball world as you sit in pain with your

[06:03] hernia recovery?

[06:04] Let's talk first and foremost about Pulp Fiction LE.

[06:07] So I'm in the thread and I see people are talking about getting their games.

[06:11] And everyone who's setting this game up, it is a beautiful game.

[06:14] The topper looks fine.

[06:16] But there's one issue that a lot of owners are dealing with.

[06:20] And I think anyone who's about to get their Pulp Fiction, you should check on this when

[06:24] you get your game.

[06:25] Apparently, there's an issue with the lockdown bar.

[06:29] Now, they supposedly are using Bali Williams lockdown bars and mechanisms.

[06:35] And they're also using Bali Williams, I believe.

[06:37] The cabinet proportions are Bali Williams.

[06:39] Now, what seemingly has happened is they drilled the holes for the lockdown bar assembly a

[06:46] little bit off from what they should have drilled them at.

[06:49] That is causing a lot of issues with getting that lockdown bar on and off.

[06:54] I don't know what the solve is.

[06:56] I was on the club thread.

[06:58] I was reading people.

[06:59] The one concerning thing I hope doesn't become an issue is people were emailing Chicago Gaming

[07:04] Company about the issue and they were not hearing back from the company.

[07:09] And I just believe, and you know how I feel about this, if you're a pinball company, you

[07:14] don't have that many customers, right?

[07:16] You're not Verizon.

[07:17] You're not Microsoft.

[07:19] You got like what, a thousand L.D. owners.

[07:21] And how many emails are you getting a day from customers that are having issues?

[07:26] Maybe at most six or more, right?

[07:29] Not that many.

[07:30] So I don't think any customer email should ever go unanswered for a few days.

[07:36] And I'm hearing that in the thread.

[07:38] And obviously this doesn't seem like an easy fix.

[07:42] I don't know if it's going to happen.

[07:43] Hopefully for many of you out there, you get a game with no issues and you won't have to

[07:48] be taking the glass out and using that lockdown bar very often.

[07:52] But I will say there's nothing more annoying than a lockdown bar that won't clasp properly

[07:59] because it's just like that thing where you're like jamming metal against glass and it won't

[08:05] close and it's so like, I don't want to be here.

[08:09] I don't want to be doing this right now.

[08:11] And I don't want to be adding more force or more pressure to this like latch as I can't

[08:16] get the lockdown bar closed.

[08:18] I know this because Guns N' Roses suffers from a really crappy lockdown bar and every

[08:23] time I take it off, I'm like, oh, here we go again.

[08:26] Some days it works.

[08:27] Some days it doesn't.

[08:28] And it's not fun.

[08:29] Now speaking of Guns N' Roses, the art of pinball has finally released.

[08:34] It's been out for like a little over a month or a few months now.

[08:37] The Guns N' Roses topper from Lior.

[08:41] This thing was much rumored years ago.

[08:43] Remember, this thing was supposed to be like the creme de la creme.

[08:46] When Jersey Jack was releasing like the $250 flat plastic topper, Lior was going to save

[08:53] the day with his Guns N' Roses topper and we saw like a prototype of it.

[08:58] It had a big skull like the Axl skull right up front and then it had a guitar behind them.

[09:04] But the guitar proportions were all off.

[09:06] It looked more like a ukulele and something happened with like Lior.

[09:10] Something weird happened.

[09:11] Like he had the exclusive deal with Little Shop of Games and then that has fallen through.

[09:18] There was that period where there was all these rumors of Islior alive or dead and it

[09:23] was scary because the stuff was going on in Israel and the Gaza Strip and nobody really

[09:28] knew and people were getting these cryptic Facebook messages and I would ask Barry because

[09:33] he's working on the sculpts for Alice and he's working on the sculpts for Back to the

[09:37] Future and they were like, no, he's fine.

[09:39] But he never really came out and said much.

[09:42] Like he had so many opportunities to just let everybody know what's happening with him.

[09:47] He never did.

[09:48] Now we finally get this topper after all these years and it's quite clear what's happened

[09:53] with this topper.

[09:54] This guy totally got hit with a season desist letter from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:00] Even look at the way they're marketing this topper.

[10:03] They've had to blur out the Guns N' Roses banner and the Guns N' Roses logo from the

[10:08] Translight by which this topper sits on top of.

[10:13] I will say this topper to me looking at it now after all these years and so many toppers

[10:19] selling for so much money.

[10:21] I don't really think it works or adds much to the game.

[10:24] It is cool.

[10:25] It is unique but it also feels very neutered and let me explain.

[10:30] They clearly are not allowed to use anything that is IP of Guns N' Roses.

[10:36] So the way the topper is now, it's got the Axl Skull in the middle.

[10:41] It's got two guns at the bottom with a bunch of roses.

[10:44] All that's open IP.

[10:45] Just having a skeleton with a bandana and blonde hair doesn't infringe on the IP of

[10:51] GNR.

[10:52] But then you look behind the skeleton and this is where I just feel like it's lame and

[10:57] I wouldn't buy one.

[10:59] You see a skeleton holding up like Slash holds up his Les Paul guitar and it's illustrated

[11:05] the way the skeletons are illustrated on the play field and on the Translight.

[11:10] But what you don't see on that skeleton is the iconic hair and top hat of Slash.

[11:17] So they clearly couldn't make that skeleton look like Slash and in a game that prides

[11:22] itself on having access to all the GNR IP you want.

[11:27] I just would not spend $2,600 on this topper for that reason.

[11:32] I also just think gang, the world of aftermarket super expensive toppers in my honest opinion

[11:39] is dead.

[11:40] The topper craze for those aftermarket ones is dead.

[11:43] It's like kind of a car spoiler.

[11:46] If you're going to put a spoiler, you know like the wing on the back of your car, if

[11:49] you're going to put one on it, you always want to put one on it that was made by the

[11:54] manufacturer.

[11:55] I don't care if the manufacturer topper is good or not.

[11:58] I just don't like seeing these aftermarket toppers on games.

[12:02] I understand getting them if the OEM manufacturer never made a topper, but I would never ever

[12:09] ever invest in super expensive toppers that didn't come from the factory.

[12:15] I don't have a problem with like elite topper making an Indiana Jones topper because they

[12:20] never made a topper for Indiana Jones back in the 90s.

[12:23] But I wouldn't put like something on top of Pirates of the Caribbean or Batman or any

[12:29] of these newer games.

[12:31] I don't like the prices of stern toppers, but if I'm going to own a Jaws or a Foo Fighters

[12:36] or a Deadpool, I of course I'm going to want to put the manufacturer topper on the game

[12:42] and all collectors feel that way.

[12:43] We got that Leor toppers out in the GNR world.

[12:48] Stern D&Ds are arriving to customers right now.

[12:50] It seems like there was a little bit of a pause in D&D being on the line.

[12:55] I think Stern hit pause on the assembly line to put the new motor mech into the dragon,

[13:01] also probably to figure out the solve for it because when you look at the unboxings

[13:06] of this game, it seems like a couple hundred LEs went out and then a lot of people are

[13:12] waiting.

[13:13] Some people are being told this week.

[13:15] I knew Stern can make anywhere from four to eight hundred games a week and they probably

[13:20] could have banged out half of the LEs of D&D in a week, but it didn't feel like that.

[13:26] It didn't feel like we got all of the LEs out the door at once.

[13:31] It definitely felt like there was a pause.

[13:33] Now like no one's going to be unhappy that Stern hit pause on the line to fix an issue.

[13:38] So I'm happy to see those games going out.

[13:40] I continue to hear nothing but good things about D&D.

[13:44] I think it's a really solid game for Stern.

[13:47] I don't think it's going to sell as well as people think simply because of what's coming

[13:52] and people are going to wait.

[13:54] And when you hear what I'm going to say at the end of this show, it's going to make

[13:56] you want to wait even more.

[13:58] And again, I think there was no reason to buy a D&D LE.

[14:02] I think they're going to be $10,000 games in just a few months.

[14:05] Alright let's go over to Barrels of Fun.

[14:07] So this company, you know, their game is probably next.

[14:10] We talk a lot about Kong and Potter, but Barrels of Fun is the company that is going to have

[14:16] the next launch in the pinball world.

[14:19] And they know they need to get out in front of Harry Potter and King Kong.

[14:24] And if they don't do that, they're going to be kind of screwed.

[14:26] I do believe that.

[14:28] So they had a factory tour during the weekend of the Twippies and they had pinball media

[14:33] and other people go through there and sign an NDA.

[14:37] And apparently they did show stuff.

[14:39] They showed some mechanisms for a future title to those individuals.

[14:44] And I heard from people there that the mechanism does give away what the theme is.

[14:50] Only problem is nobody's talking right now.

[14:52] It's going to come out.

[14:53] But right now everyone is holding true to the NDA.

[14:57] And you know, honestly, I don't care to bribe people to try to get this information.

[15:01] It'll leak when it leaks.

[15:02] It'll probably end up on Naps Arcade before you hear it here.

[15:06] So what was funny about the factory tour is Barrels of Fun was putting Goonies keys all

[15:12] over the place.

[15:13] I think there was two Goonies skeleton keys that they just put out in the open.

[15:18] And some people are speculating that means they have the Goonies.

[15:22] I think it's the opposite.

[15:24] I think it is a misdirect that they don't have the Goonies.

[15:28] Here's the funny part.

[15:29] It really could go either way because I think we're so used to now manufacturers doing this

[15:35] where they give away a theme like this in such an apparent way that you come to the

[15:41] conclusion that they're not making it.

[15:43] So maybe the best way to deceive people nowadays is to actually come clean and have the IP

[15:50] all over your factory.

[15:52] And everyone's going to be like, there's no way they're doing it because it's out in

[15:55] the open.

[15:56] It'd be like if people over at Stern Pinball's spoiler alert start wearing Pokemon t-shirts,

[16:02] you're going to be like, they're not making Pokemon.

[16:04] They would never reveal to the world like this.

[16:06] And look, guessing is fun.

[16:08] None of this information is that important.

[16:11] None of it is worth the secrecy that it gets.

[16:14] None of these NDAs could ever hold up anywhere in a court of law.

[16:18] Think about it.

[16:19] Like if you revealed to the world and broke NDA on the next barrels of fun game or game

[16:25] number three, what could they actually sue you for?

[16:29] You'd have to imply some sort of damages were incurred.

[16:33] So what judge would take that lawsuit?

[16:36] So it's like, yo, Joe Bob over in Wisconsin came through my factory and let Kaneda know

[16:42] that it's going to be this title.

[16:44] All right.

[16:45] So what damages to you did that do?

[16:48] We don't know.

[16:49] There'd be absolutely no way to enforce any of those NDAs.

[16:53] And that's me just publicly telling everybody who went there.

[16:56] Come on gang.

[16:57] Like we used to have a community that would like be looking out for the community, not

[17:01] these companies NDAs.

[17:03] Tell me at KanedaPinball at gmail.com or call me up, whatever you want to do.

[17:07] I will keep you a secret and let's just get it out there.

[17:11] You know me.

[17:12] I love to spoil the plans of these big pinball companies.

[17:14] All right.

[17:15] So we got barrels of fun and I'll just say this, their next game is going to be real

[17:19] soon and here's my take.

[17:22] I don't think this is going to be a take my money now game and I'll explain why.

[17:28] In my conversations with my friends over there, I'm getting the sense that this is going to

[17:33] be another divisive title.

[17:37] I'm getting the sense this is going to be like another kind of labyrinth where it's

[17:42] a theme that you're going to have to warm up to that makes me believe it might be Dune.

[17:48] I'm not sure if it is Dune gang.

[17:50] I feel like it has to be the original Dune movie, the David Lynch movie.

[17:55] I mean, I feel like there's no way these guys could afford to get the Timothy Chamolet,

[18:01] like the modern one with the soundtrack and the IMAX 4K.

[18:05] There's no way that this tiny little company inked the deal to make the modern version.

[18:10] Also the modern version doesn't really make much sense in my honest opinion.

[18:14] I think the Dune for 40 to 60 year old men is the original Dune.

[18:19] I just would not have gone there, but we shall see.

[18:23] I think everyone's rooting for G.I. Joe and this creates a quagmire for them because if

[18:28] everyone wants it to be Joe and then it ends up being Dune, I don't think that puts you

[18:34] in the driver's seat.

[18:35] It's like we all know it's Harry Potter.

[18:37] We all know it's King Kong.

[18:39] Nobody who's looking forward to Kong or Potter is going to be surprised in a way that's unfulfilling

[18:45] and that's my worry about this.

[18:48] If it is Dune and everybody's rooting for it to be G.I. Joe, when you drop Dune, people

[18:54] are going to feel unsatisfied and unfulfilled and that's a marketing thing that David Van

[18:59] S needs to take into consideration and I know they like to have all the rumors swirling,

[19:05] but it's not always good for business.

[19:07] Look at what happened to Elton John.

[19:09] It's like when the rumors were it was Elton John, everyone's like it's not going to be

[19:13] Elton John or more importantly, everybody was wishing it was in Elton John.

[19:19] But if Jersey Jack just let everybody know, look, it's going to be Elton John.

[19:22] It's going to be the best shooting game we've ever made.

[19:25] Then all of a sudden you flip the narrative.

[19:27] You get everybody thinking about how awesome it's going to be to have the best shooting

[19:31] game you've ever made and get the attention away from a theme that people might not be

[19:35] hot about.

[19:37] So let's go on to the next thing I noticed.

[19:38] I was in the stern X-Men thread and just real quick.

[19:41] I'm seeing a phrase that you never want to see in your pinball club thread and that phrase

[19:48] is the following.

[19:49] I don't understand all the hate this game gets.

[19:54] Once you hear that phrase in your club thread, you know you've got a game that isn't in a

[20:01] good place.

[20:03] And whenever you hear it, I want to give you an analogy.

[20:06] You guys ever have a friend of yours?

[20:09] Dating a girl and you don't think the girl is good for him.

[20:13] And the girl treats him like crap.

[20:15] But you know what?

[20:16] She's beautiful, right?

[20:17] She's kind of hot.

[20:18] So your friend puts up with all the crap.

[20:20] He gets tired of all the crap he's putting up with and he breaks up with her.

[20:25] And because you're his friend, you're happy to hear about the breakup.

[20:29] You're happy to hear that he's seeing everything that worried you about her.

[20:34] But then here's what happens.

[20:35] Time goes on and he misses her.

[20:38] Nostalgia makes him feel a little bit lonely for that beauty.

[20:42] And he gets back together with her.

[20:44] And when they get back together, things are much better this time.

[20:48] She treats him better.

[20:50] She realizes what life is like without him.

[20:53] And their relationship is repaired.

[20:56] But you still don't like her.

[20:59] And you never will.

[21:00] And it doesn't matter what their relationship turns into because your opinion has been

[21:06] solidified by all the times you witnessed her doing bad things to him and you don't

[21:12] care to change your mind.

[21:14] And that's what happens in pinball with games like this.

[21:18] And if you think about it, the people who are hating on X-Men, the reason they are hating

[21:23] on it is they heard from the owners how bad the game was abusing them.

[21:30] And that abuse came in the form of mechanical issues and code issues.

[21:35] So now these owners who are feeling a little bit better about their beautiful girlfriend,

[21:41] now they want all of us to respect their relationship with the game and they can't understand why

[21:48] so many people are hating on the game.

[21:51] Ladies and gentlemen, it's like a high school relationship.

[21:54] You turn us into the haters of X-Men.

[21:56] You, the owners, the people who are dating this game, they turned us against this game.

[22:02] Now they want us to turn back.

[22:04] I just think it's gone too far and I don't think people are going to change their mind

[22:08] on this game.

[22:09] But speaking about a game that a lot of people have changed their mind on, I'm just happy

[22:13] to report that George Gomez is James Bond.

[22:17] It's snuck up the pinside top 100.

[22:20] I know a lot of you are like that list is stupid.

[22:23] But look, James Bond now sits at number 13 on the top 100 games of all time.

[22:31] It is right below Lord of the Rings and Twilight Zone and just above it are games like Jaws.

[22:37] And so let me tell you people, George Gomez wants to win the marathon.

[22:42] He doesn't care about the sprints.

[22:45] His Batman was terrible right away.

[22:48] His James Bond was terrible right away.

[22:50] But over time, George Gomez, and he's the man, and you know if there's anyone over at

[22:56] Stern Pinball who's not going to leave his creations unfinished, it's the dude at the

[23:02] top, George Gomez.

[23:04] And so I'm happy to see that this game is getting the love.

[23:07] I'm still not the biggest fan of the layout, but here's my thing.

[23:11] I think as pinball fanatics, we should hope that people that love a theme in the end are

[23:19] happy with the pinball version of the IP they love.

[23:23] Like I want James Bond fanatics to love their James Bond pinball machine and it seemingly

[23:29] is the case and that's a good thing.

[23:32] The only suckers are the people that bought the James Bond 60th anniversary edition.

[23:36] I still will think if you bought that game at $20,000, I don't know how you look at yourself

[23:43] in the mirror.

[23:44] I really don't.

[23:45] A couple more things and then I'm going to give you sort of like the big things I've

[23:48] been hearing about what's coming down the line from Stern Pinball.

[23:51] So the first is Avatar.

[23:53] Let's see.

[23:54] CEs are going out the door.

[23:55] I'm curious how many CEs they make a week.

[23:59] Do you think they sold a thousand Avatar CEs?

[24:02] I don't.

[24:03] You think they got orders for a thousand Avatar CEs?

[24:06] I don't.

[24:07] I think they're going to make probably around 500 of these.

[24:09] I think that's the same thing with Elton John.

[24:11] I don't think there's a thousand Elton John CEs out there.

[24:14] I would just be shocked.

[24:16] It's hard to tell what JJP because of how they number their games.

[24:20] The serial numbers on the CEs do not reflect the bill order.

[24:25] So you could have game number 999 out there and that's the second game on the line.

[24:31] I don't like they do it that way, but they do it that way.

[24:35] Avatar has been out now for six months and you can sometimes go buy an owner's club

[24:39] thread to determine how successful a game was at selling because if a game was successful

[24:46] at selling people, guess what happens next?

[24:49] It actually gets unboxed and there's owners.

[24:53] So if Avatar was a good seller, how come the owner's club is so small?

[24:58] The answer is staring us in the face.

[25:01] The game didn't sell that well.

[25:03] All attention is on Harry Potter.

[25:05] I'm now seeing people starting threads supporting Eric and we all support Eric Minier.

[25:10] I want Eric Minier's Harry Potter to be amazing.

[25:12] I don't want people to root against Harry Potter.

[25:16] I don't want people to root against Jersey Jack.

[25:19] As pinball lovers, we should all be rooting against these high prices.

[25:23] Yes, but we shouldn't be rooting against a company's ability to make a magical game

[25:29] and nobody should have a prejudice against Eric Minier, JJP, Stern pinball, spooky pinball.

[25:37] Look, every company is as good as their last game and Eric Minier knows he's got a golden

[25:44] opportunity with this theme to make what could be one of the greatest pinball machines of

[25:51] all time.

[25:53] He knows that.

[25:55] You know that.

[25:56] Our expectations are very high and he knows that.

[26:00] So when Harry Potter drops, we are expecting a lot and we know because the dude made Pire

[26:07] to the Caribbean that Eric Minier can put a lot into a pinball machine.

[26:12] We know because he made Guns N' Roses, he can make a really awesome pinball experience.

[26:18] So let's wait and see, right?

[26:19] There's nothing else to say other than, Avatar's been a sales flop and all eyes are on Potter.

[26:26] Now, let's go over to Dutch pinball before the tariffs hit all these European companies.

[26:31] Look, we've got Dutch pinball's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[26:35] I'm just looking at the date.

[26:37] It's March 4th and this game is supposed to be on the line.

[26:42] Mid-March was the latest I heard.

[26:44] So that's next week.

[26:46] They're waiting on a ball guide.

[26:48] Every week that this game isn't on the line, Dutch pinball is losing money.

[26:54] They've apparently made the last Lebowski.

[26:57] So we know they want to get this game on the line ASAP.

[27:00] It's going to get on the line.

[27:02] The fear for owners right now is not a fear of whether or not you're going to get your

[27:07] game.

[27:08] The real fear is, did I buy my game too early?

[27:12] Every week this game gets delayed, you're going to see more and more spots go up for

[27:17] sale and they're not going for over MSRP.

[27:21] People are selling their spot at cost.

[27:24] Now what that means is the next stop because they're not selling.

[27:28] No one's gobbling these spots up.

[27:29] You see a $1,500 deposit is what Alice was.

[27:33] People selling you a spot for $1,500 and no bites.

[27:37] So what that means is 500 games is more supply than demand.

[27:43] What that means is there's not more people willing to get on the Alice train and that's

[27:49] not good.

[27:50] It's not good for a game whose initial intention was to be a highly sought after collectible

[27:56] work of art in the pinball world.

[27:58] I'm sorry but it's just too many games.

[28:01] No one feels like they missed out on Alice and that is in the phrase, the fear of missing

[28:08] out and there is no fear of missing out.

[28:11] If there was one person on planet earth that feared they missed out on getting an Alice,

[28:17] they would have bought one of those spots at cost and they have not.

[28:21] Again, next stop on this train is the prices are going to probably go down because the

[28:27] games are going to slowly trickle out and people with Alice deposits are going to get

[28:32] impatient as Harry Potter comes out, as King Kong comes out.

[28:36] Dutch had a window.

[28:37] They had a window to get these games out the door when no one else was really shipping

[28:41] anything.

[28:42] You just had Spooky with Evil Dead, Stern had D&D but they told us these games were going

[28:47] to ship in January, nothing.

[28:49] February, nothing.

[28:50] And look, the more you do this to your customers, the more you mislead them on ship dates, the

[28:56] more their enthusiasm to get it is going to dissipate.

[28:59] And also, since Expo, remember Expo was in October, October, November, December, January,

[29:08] February, March, people, we are six months.

[29:11] It's really five months since Expo but in that five month time period, have you been

[29:16] getting consistent updates on the code, what they've been adding to the game?

[29:21] No, you haven't been seeing anything.

[29:23] You haven't seen the game being streamed.

[29:26] Nothing.

[29:27] Nothing.

[29:28] You have no idea if your game got twice as good or if it stayed exactly the same as you

[29:33] saw it at Expo.

[29:34] Alright, so let's go on to a couple things I'm hearing in the room or mail.

[29:39] And I think I might have been wrong.

[29:41] I don't know.

[29:42] I'm curious to see how this whole thing plays out.

[29:44] I will say that I heard back from Jason Knapp and we're going to do a friendly bet of $100.

[29:49] We're going to donate the money to charity.

[29:51] Whoever loses will donate the money to charity.

[29:54] We're going to pick a charity.

[29:55] And the whole rumor was around whether or not the walking dead would be out in the fall.

[30:02] Sometime in October is what I am hearing.

[30:05] There will be a new remastered game by Stern Pinball.

[30:09] I'm getting a little nervous now because October, Halloween, the walking dead, it all makes sense.

[30:17] But there is another theme that also makes a lot of sense for Halloween and that is Ghostbusters.

[30:25] Now I do hear that the license holder for Ghostbusters is a lot more difficult to work

[30:30] with.

[30:31] It's a lot easier for Stern to bring the walking dead back than it would be Ghostbusters.

[30:37] But here's the big but, Ghostbusters would sell 3-4 times more units than the walking

[30:43] dead if they brought back Ghostbusters and fixed some of the issues with the game.

[30:50] But a walking dead with a new art package.

[30:53] What if they did a comic book style?

[30:56] Walking dead remastered with zombie yeti on art.

[31:01] Just thinking about that makes me think about handing money over.

[31:05] I don't know.

[31:06] So that's gonna happen.

[31:08] So I think it's gonna be one of those two.

[31:11] I know a lot of people are wondering is it gonna be Tron.

[31:14] I just think we all need to come to terms with the fact that Stern is gonna remake all of

[31:20] those hit DMD games eventually.

[31:22] I mean it.

[31:23] Eventually they will do it.

[31:25] Whether it's Lord of the Rings, maybe not.

[31:27] Tron, I think so.

[31:29] Kiss is gonna come back.

[31:31] The walking dead.

[31:33] They'll probably even bring back ACDC.

[31:36] I just think it's a matter of when, not if.

[31:39] I think we're gonna see a remastered or two every year moving forward as Seth needs to

[31:44] keep that line going.

[31:46] Alright, so here's what I'm hearing.

[31:48] I'm hearing that John Borg is working on a really big IP.

[31:54] I'm also hearing it's the biggest IP that Stern has had.

[32:01] Now I'm confused because if this is the biggest IP Stern has had, so the biggest Stern IP

[32:08] is Star Wars.

[32:10] I'm also hearing from people that Star Wars is the best selling Stern machine ever.

[32:16] I wouldn't argue that.

[32:17] I really wouldn't.

[32:18] But if you look at the number one properties in the world, Star Wars is number five.

[32:25] Number seven is Super Mario Brothers.

[32:28] So as much as I would love Super Mario Brothers to be a John Borg game, right, and it makes

[32:33] total sense, John Borg is such an 80's nerd.

[32:38] If there's any property I know he would love to make, it's Super Mario Brothers and that

[32:44] would crush.

[32:45] But the other rumored theme is three times bigger as an IP than Super Mario Brothers.

[32:52] This is a $92 billion franchise.

[32:58] $92 billion.

[33:01] And that is Pokemon.

[33:03] And so all the rumors are probably going to be true.

[33:07] That Stern has Pokemon.

[33:10] What's interesting to me is if Pokemon is coming out from Stern, do you think John Borg

[33:17] is the guy?

[33:19] You know it always seemed like Jack Danger was the one who Pokemon would be perfect

[33:23] for, but I'm not sure how it works with who gets what theme over at Stern Pimbo.

[33:28] And I mean that.

[33:29] I feel like Borg has been somewhat screwed.

[33:33] And I think he got screwed over on Indiana Jones.

[33:37] I think they had a new Indiana Jones ready to go and it fell through because of licensing.

[33:43] And also gang, I do think that these designers do get paid per game sold.

[33:50] I do think they get a little bit of a royalty based on how successful their game is.

[33:56] Keith Elwin's doing very well financially because he makes the best damn games.

[34:00] You know so maybe John Borg who was sitting on a great payday with Indiana Jones and it

[34:06] got shelved.

[34:09] Maybe they made it up to him by giving him Pokemon because it almost doesn't even matter

[34:15] what you do with the Pokemon design.

[34:18] It's going to be one of your best selling games ever.

[34:21] And from what I'm hearing this game is close right this huge IP it's like Stern knows they've

[34:26] got something bigger than Harry Potter.

[34:29] And in case you were wondering Harry Potter when it comes to the top IPs is below Super

[34:35] Mario Brothers it's two down from Super Mario and it's the 10th largest IP in the world.

[34:42] You know it's crazy is right after Harry Potter when you look at property values are all the

[34:46] Marvel properties then it makes me really sad because I see Toy Story there.

[34:52] I see Barbie.

[34:53] I see Dragon Ball Z.

[34:55] I see Batman.

[34:57] Transformers is on this list.

[34:59] So that gets very interesting when you think about it.

[35:02] So are we going to go?

[35:04] With Elwynn King Kong in May and then are we going to get a John Borg Pokemon machine

[35:11] sometime this summer followed up by a John Borg remake of The Walking Dead or will it

[35:20] be Ghostbusters or will it be Tron.

[35:22] You know sometimes I think Stern is out of it right like they don't got the titles and

[35:26] they're not going to be able to punch back.

[35:28] But then I'm like I don't know maybe there's a reason why this company was so cavalier

[35:32] about back to the future.

[35:34] It's because they knew they had Pokemon.

[35:36] Don't get me started on back to the future.

[35:37] If Dutch pinball tries to satiate that a man for this game they need to make a move.

[35:41] They need to make a move and no Dutch pinball is not going to partner up with American pinball

[35:47] to make back to the future.

[35:49] That deal has not been signed.

[35:51] It might happen in the future when Barry realizes he can't be making this game for 15 years.

[35:57] All I know is this 2025 is shaping up to be a really

[36:03] interesting year in pinball.

[36:05] The global economic world though I think is going to have an impact on the pinball industry

[36:11] like no other.

[36:13] We've never really seen outside forces impact our ability to buy games.

[36:19] I mean these manufacturers took prices up but people in America have never had to suffer

[36:25] what people in Europe have suffered.

[36:27] People in Australia and I don't know what's happening with the world people.

[36:31] I don't tend to be an expert on economics but I do feel like this administration just

[36:38] wants to light everything on fire and then see what happens.

[36:41] I know pinball is not the focus of any administration's economic policies but we could suffer the

[36:47] fallout.

[36:49] It's a weird time.

[36:50] It's a weird time like crypto goes up it goes down stocks go up they go down.

[36:55] Everything is feeling very volatile.

[36:58] Right now as I sit here in my bed and I can barely move I can't lift 15 pounds for the

[37:05] next six weeks.

[37:07] When you lose your health and you experience pain like I'm experiencing people you have

[37:13] a newfound appreciation for everything that really matters in life.

[37:17] I'm so blessed to have this community and this hobby.

[37:21] I think coming out of the Twippies everyone has said you didn't witness canada behaving

[37:26] like a baby because you've seen me behave like a baby many times.

[37:31] What you witnessed that night was Brenda and how amazing she is and how she is the most

[37:39] valuable thing in my world.

[37:41] The mother of my children and having an amazing partner in life like her makes every day magical.

[37:49] I mean that.

[37:50] You know if these pinball companies make magic or not it doesn't matter because I wake up

[37:55] every day feeling so blessed that I have someone so amazing like her by my side and I have

[38:02] these amazing children to fill this house with the sounds of life.

[38:07] If I could only tell you as I sit here bedridden the smile on my face when I hear my two little

[38:13] boys downstairs with her on just an average day.

[38:18] So everybody take care of yourselves.

[38:20] I hope you enjoyed this little bit longer version of canada spinball podcast.

[38:24] I'm literally moving at the speed at which my body can go.

[38:28] Thank you for your support.

[38:29] I really do appreciate you sticking around.

[38:32] I know at the end of the month you each get that little bill and some people bail will

[38:36] get back over 700 when new games start shipping.

[38:40] But everybody thank you so much.
