[00:00] Music

[00:12] Alright, well it's official, we finally know who is making Rick and Morty Pimbal and it

[00:19] is no other.

[00:20] And I think it's being made by the right people, it's no other than Spooky Pimbal.

[00:26] I mean how exciting is it that Spooky Pimbal is going to make Rick and Morty Pimbal

[00:33] and it's going to be Scott Denise's design and it's a theme.

[00:37] I won't lie to you, even though I don't know much about Rick and Morty.

[00:41] I do know people love love this theme.

[00:45] And I've been inundated with people super excited that Rick and Morty Pimbal is coming.

[00:50] And what do we think?

[00:51] I mean the trailer just won up about 30 seconds before I started recording this podcast.

[00:56] So I think we have to congratulate Spooky Pimbal on landing.

[01:01] What is I keep hearing from people in amazing theme for Pimbal, okay?

[01:07] And so here's why I think it's important for Spooky too.

[01:11] You know, they're going to make 750 Rick and Morty games and that's it.

[01:17] See what I like about this now is Spooky Pimbal continues to grow at a pace in which all

[01:24] of their games, even though they don't have to call these games limited edition games.

[01:29] They don't have to call these games collectors editions.

[01:31] They don't call them anything by nature.

[01:35] Spooky Pimbal games are limited.

[01:37] And if you're a fan of Rick and Morty, which there are millions of fans and they nail this game,

[01:45] this game is going to sell out pretty damn quickly.

[01:48] And that's it.

[01:49] Now we don't know, we don't know if they are going to announce that they are only making

[01:55] 750 or if that's just one year's production of the game.

[02:00] Because you know, Spooky Pimbal can always go back and remake a game or do a vault

[02:04] edition of a game.

[02:04] But for now, I think this company has always done it right and they've grown up the right

[02:09] pace. And so we know nothing other than they're the ones doing it.

[02:14] It's not going to be Stern Pimbal, okay?

[02:16] Which is refreshing, which is refreshing.

[02:18] And I will say this, there are people out there and you know who they are.

[02:24] Maybe you're one of these people who if you have a dream theme, you don't really

[02:29] want Stern to make it.

[02:31] You would rather go somewhere else where it's going to get some different kinds of love

[02:35] and attention.

[02:37] But here's the thing.

[02:39] Here's the thing.

[02:40] Spooky Pimbal games to date, you know,

[02:43] they haven't really sort of been at the same level or caliber in terms of what's in

[02:49] them as some of the other competitors out there.

[02:52] So we know that this will be a Scott game and it will be a multi layered game.

[02:57] It's not going to be single level or multi level game.

[03:00] You know, what will we see mechanically from Spooky Pimbal?

[03:03] We know that the artwork on their games has been phenomenal recently.

[03:08] If I had to guess who is doing the art package on this game,

[03:12] I would probably think Matt Andrews will do it who did the artwork with Scott and

[03:17] you see on TNA.

[03:19] I don't know who's coding the game.

[03:20] I don't know anything.

[03:21] We none of us know anything.

[03:22] We just know that this game is coming out.

[03:25] It's going to be available starting Christmas 2019, which is exciting too,

[03:31] because we knew that they were wrapping up production of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[03:36] this week.

[03:37] And now we're getting a new game from them.

[03:39] So I just want to congratulate Spooky Pimbal on landing this theme.

[03:43] I think it's going to sell like gangbusters, only questions I would have.

[03:47] What's the price going to be knowing that it's a license theme,

[03:51] knowing that it has a voice overwork from one of the voice actors of the show,

[03:56] which is awesome, by the way, when you get someone associated with the theme

[04:02] to do original voice overwork in the Pimbal machine, it changes everything.

[04:08] I mean, Batman 66 having callouts from Adam Weston, Bert Ward,

[04:15] Varukasault doing callouts for Willy Wonka.

[04:18] It just adds so much more of a personal touch to the Pimbal experience when that occurs.

[04:24] So I think that's great news as well.

[04:26] All right.

[04:26] So how much will it be when are they going to start shipping games?

[04:30] It's going to be soon.

[04:31] That's what's great too.

[04:31] Spooky Pimbal is no longer going to reveal a game and make people wait six months.

[04:36] So I fully expect this thing to be on the line in the next few weeks and out the door.

[04:43] And now it sort of makes sense why Chuck had the whole, you know, spooky

[04:48] fan club thing where if you signed up, you get first dibs on their next game.

[04:52] They must know they have a hot title.

[04:54] And I'm happy.

[04:55] I'm happy for them.

[04:56] I want them to have a game that just sells out in one day because there's enough

[05:00] fans and we can't say it enough.

[05:03] Theme is everything.

[05:05] It's everything.

[05:06] It's not just a little bit.

[05:08] It's everything when it comes to Pimbal.

[05:09] Why would you want to own a Pimbal machine that has a theme that doesn't excite you?

[05:14] Why would you want to spend so much money on a toy that is a theme that it does.

[05:19] You don't want to bolt to your floor.

[05:20] It's everything.

[05:22] It's everything.

[05:22] It made me it.

[05:23] We it's I would say like 80% of what would make someone want to play a Pimbal

[05:28] machine and buy a Pimbal machine is theme.

[05:31] Okay.

[05:32] Yes, to own it and want to keep it for years, obviously you need some code and

[05:37] and some longevity in that area.

[05:39] But theme is everything.

[05:41] Now speaking of theme is everything.

[05:45] I heard Stern Pimbal in 2019 had its best year ever.

[05:52] Best year ever.

[05:53] Best sales year in the history of Stern Pimbal 2019.

[06:00] And then you might ask yourself, well, did Stern Pimbal make the best Pimbal

[06:04] machines ever in its company's history in 2019?

[06:09] You know, let's look at the games.

[06:11] You've got monsters.

[06:12] You've got black night.

[06:14] You've got Jurassic Park easily going to be the best game of the year.

[06:19] It's going to win.

[06:20] Keith L. wouldn't did it again.

[06:23] What else?

[06:23] What else did we have in 2019 from Stern?

[06:27] Elvira House of Horrors.

[06:29] Okay.

[06:29] I mean, good games.

[06:31] Star Wars two years ago, Ghostbusters two, three years ago, you know, Batman a year ago,

[06:36] you two years ago.

[06:37] You know, but here's the thing.

[06:39] The reason why Stern had its best year ever because it is not because of the

[06:44] games that came out in 2019 because unlike everybody else,

[06:50] Stern Pimbal doesn't just sell you brand new games from one year production

[06:56] lines.

[06:56] They sell you games from multiple years of production lines.

[07:01] So by that, I mean, if I walk into, let's, let's go down the list.

[07:06] If I walk into American Pimbal two day, I can get a Houdini or I could get in

[07:12] October fest, right?

[07:13] Two games without a lot of demand.

[07:15] If I walk into, let's see, who's next?

[07:18] Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[07:20] Really, the only game you can get that's brand new on the line is Willy

[07:23] Wanka. I think obviously distributors still have dialed in's distributors still

[07:29] have wizard of Oz, you know, yellow brick roads and the remaking Ruby Reds again.

[07:35] But that's a seven year old game.

[07:36] But for the most part, if you go to Jersey Jack Pimbal and you buy directly from

[07:40] Jersey Jack, I pretty much the only game you're going to get is the current

[07:43] game, Willy Wanka on the line.

[07:46] But if you go to Stern Pimbal, I mean, it's just this is when I, when I say

[07:49] theme is everything.

[07:51] Stern Pimbal will sell you these themes, Star Wars.

[07:56] Okay, stop right there.

[07:57] Star Wars, Jurassic Park, the Beatles, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Trek,

[08:06] Batman, Iron Maiden, the monsters, Black Knight, Elvira, House of Horses, right?

[08:16] I mean, just their alone and they're about to add to this list,

[08:20] stranger things people on top of all of that, stranger things and teenage mutant

[08:27] Ninja Turtles into that mix.

[08:30] It's just like a never ending all star lineup of games.

[08:36] And so here's the thing, speaking of stranger things, here's what I'm hearing.

[08:39] Here's the rumor that stranger things will ship to consumers before Christmas.

[08:46] That people will unbox stranger things Pimbal from Brian Eddie this year before the

[08:51] year is up before the Christmas songs are sung under the Yule log.

[08:56] Is it under the Yule log or I don't even know what I'm saying right now.

[08:59] So I'm hearing that they're going to announce this game or reveal it in the next

[09:02] couple weeks.

[09:04] And then on December 23rd, pro versions of the game, a limited run of pro

[09:10] versions of the game will be going out to distributors and customers, which

[09:14] means people will extensively get them before Christmas, because they'll be

[09:18] same day drop offs for people.

[09:20] So that is what I'm hearing.

[09:22] Now, stranger things.

[09:24] How do we feel about this game?

[09:26] I mean, obviously it's a juggernaut theme.

[09:28] Obviously people are hoping that it's a non-traditional Stern,

[09:31] fanboy layout, Brian Eddie.

[09:34] See, that's the most exciting thing to me is Brian Eddie is making this game.

[09:38] And I think the reason why people sort of tend to look at Stern machines and be

[09:41] like, well, they're it's always the cookie cutter layout.

[09:45] Well, Stern really has been using the same designers over and over and over and over

[09:49] and over and over again.

[09:50] So if you want new layouts, you bring new designers on board.

[09:55] Like that's how it works.

[09:57] Everyone has a signature style to them.

[10:00] I mean, Keith L.

[10:00] When he designs differently than John Borg.

[10:04] And there's a reason why you see a lot of similarities in John Borg games.

[10:08] It's just the way he does his pens.

[10:10] It's how he likes to design.

[10:12] And so Brian Eddie, Brian Eddie who has designed some of the greatest pinball

[10:17] machines of all time.

[10:19] I mean, his medieval madness, I think, just got dethroned by Keith L.

[10:22] when his number one.

[10:24] So the real hope is that Brian Eddie will bring the Brian Eddie magic to Stern.

[10:30] And he'll make stranger things unbelievable.

[10:33] And so it's going to be it's going to be interesting because we are just coming

[10:37] off of a machine in which the T-Rex toy was an awesome mechanism.

[10:42] And I've said it, Stern, I believe will continue to advance and put more in the

[10:49] games.

[10:50] They're making so much money without doing it.

[10:52] But I still believe they will do it.

[10:54] I do.

[10:55] I don't think they're going to go in the other direction.

[10:59] And we'll we'll tell right away because Brian Eddie is a guy that loves toys

[11:06] and gimmicks and loves to put mechanisms in his machines that are pretty magical

[11:11] and awesome.

[11:12] So if we don't see that in stranger things, then I think we'll be hugely, hugely

[11:17] disappointed in the offering.

[11:20] And it's a it's a juggernaut theme.

[11:21] I mean, the question still remain what kind of assets are we going to get?

[11:25] Are we going to get clips from the show?

[11:26] Are we going to get the nostalgic 80s music that makes that show so popular?

[11:31] I highly doubt it.

[11:33] I mean, something about licensing music, it's really expensive.

[11:36] See, that's the thing where I think Stern will cut the corner is I don't think

[11:41] they will spend the extra dough to get the stuff in the game to make the game

[11:45] as great as possible.

[11:46] They won't and we know they won't.

[11:47] I mean, we know that we know they will find a way to keep the bomb at whatever

[11:53] price they need it to be at.

[11:55] And if that means we don't have, you know, take on me from aha inside the game.

[12:01] It means we don't have take on me aha inside the game.

[12:04] It's just, you know, aha's take on me, you know, the song, you know, they play

[12:07] that in stranger things.

[12:08] I think it's the prom scene in season two, but never ending story.

[12:11] I mean, how are you going to do season three if you don't have that song?

[12:14] So we'll see.

[12:16] We'll see what they do.

[12:18] But Stern's been able to get license music in other games.

[12:21] So we'll see what happens here.

[12:23] But I'm not surprised.

[12:24] You know, I just saw a pin-side post about how, you know,

[12:29] Stern's layouts lack creativity, yada, yada, yada.

[12:32] And it's like, here we go again, here we go again.

[12:34] Pimball, Pimball hobby is upset with Pimball.

[12:37] And you know, here's the most important thing nobody's making you buy anything.

[12:44] I don't get why people like wake up like that upset.

[12:46] I mean, look, on this podcast, we talk about these things, we debate these things.

[12:50] But I've always said it.

[12:52] It doesn't matter.

[12:53] None of this really matters.

[12:54] Like it's Pimball, like it's sort of stupid.

[12:56] Sometimes, you know, all you gotta do is ask some of your friends who are not into Pimball.

[13:00] Just listen to a Pimball podcast.

[13:02] And within five minutes, though, they'll be like, what is wrong with you?

[13:04] Anyway, so, you know, I think that Stern understands that theme is like really the most important thing.

[13:11] And also, theme is the reason why I think people keep a game.

[13:14] And I think people let a game go.

[13:16] And Batman66, my super limited edition.

[13:19] It is sold to a great guy.

[13:22] I'm just figuring out how to get it to him because of the winter months.

[13:25] Gotta get fast aty over here to pack it up.

[13:28] But here's a thing.

[13:29] And Brenda asked me a question.

[13:30] She's like, are you gonna miss this game?

[13:32] Like, are you going to regret selling Batman?

[13:35] And I said to her, like, I think the game is great.

[13:37] I think the game is a lot of fun.

[13:39] But I said, babe, let me ask you a question.

[13:42] You've known me now for over five years.

[13:45] In that five year period of time, how many times did you ever hear me say,

[13:51] I can't, like, I love the Adam West Batman.

[13:56] How many times have we watched Adam West Batman shows?

[13:59] How many times has this show ever come up in conversation ever, right?

[14:04] And the answer is zero.

[14:05] It's just not a theme that I am like that, that into.

[14:11] I think it's a great theme for Pimball.

[14:14] I think it is the best coded game that maybe Lyman has ever done.

[14:17] I think it's the best use of assets that Stern maybe has ever done in a game for sure.

[14:23] But it's, I've enjoyed it.

[14:25] I've enjoyed it for almost two years, maybe two years now.

[14:28] And I'm ready to move on to something else.

[14:31] And it's not a knock on the game.

[14:33] I think it's a natural cycle of a toy of a game, right?

[14:39] How many of you are playing video games that are five years old still?

[14:42] I mean, I mean, probably all you guys are.

[14:44] You guys are all into like nostalgia.

[14:45] But anyway, you know what I'm saying?

[14:48] And I also feel good about clearing everything out.

[14:51] I'm looking forward to not having any games for a while and to just sit back

[14:59] and say to myself, what do you really want, Chris?

[15:02] Like what do you really want to put in your bedroom?

[15:06] You know, do you want to put any games back in?

[15:08] Do you want to put one game?

[15:09] Do you want to put two?

[15:10] What's the game that's going to make you want to own it?

[15:14] And I've just been doing a lot of soul searching and thinking about this hobby in general.

[15:19] You know, there's so much to look forward to.

[15:23] There's so much expectations about what's to come.

[15:27] But also, I've been in this hobby long enough to know that the majority of games coming out

[15:32] won't live up to our expectations of them.

[15:36] They won't.

[15:37] They just won't do it.

[15:39] And I don't believe the excuses that there's only so much you can do with a pinball machine.

[15:43] I don't believe that.

[15:45] I think creativity in this hobby is sorely lacking.

[15:48] It is.

[15:50] There's just no way that this is all it can be.

[15:54] And because we've seen better, we've seen more creative thinking with games.

[15:58] We've seen lower play fields in which the flippers are upside down and use a mirror to give the illusion

[16:03] and that we've seen amazing stuff in games.

[16:07] And then I just, I look at the majority of these games today.

[16:11] And I do.

[16:11] I think so many of them are good.

[16:15] A little bit uninspired.

[16:17] A little bit cheaper than they should be.

[16:20] A little bit less in there than there should be.

[16:22] They're beautiful and they're reliable for the most part.

[16:28] But there's just something about the price point with where these games are that just keeps

[16:34] eating away a little bit at my enjoyment.

[16:37] But here's the easiest way to still enjoy the hobby without falling into that trap is you just

[16:44] say to yourself, I don't need to buy anything.

[16:47] I don't need to buy what's next.

[16:49] I don't need to buy every new game.

[16:51] I can wait to games come out.

[16:53] I can wait till they're actually finished.

[16:55] Code it.

[16:56] I can buy it second hand and mint condition pretty much and have it at my house in a few days

[17:01] and save myself thousands of dollars.

[17:05] But that's not a message that a lot of people want to tell you and they don't want you to think

[17:10] that.

[17:10] Like Stern doesn't want you to wake up and start to think that way.

[17:13] The distributors don't want you to wake up and start to think that way.

[17:16] They want to get you into that hype cocoon in which you have to have it.

[17:21] And I'm here to tell you that the exit is right there.

[17:26] If you're feeling like too much pressure or you've lost some enjoyment from the hobby,

[17:31] you don't have to go all in on everything.

[17:33] You don't have to go all in on the hobby even.

[17:35] You gotta find the balance.

[17:37] And I know it's hard.

[17:38] I know it's hard.

[17:39] You get bit by the pinball bug.

[17:42] But for me it's really easy because I'm limited by space.

[17:46] And also everything comes to New York City.

[17:48] Every game will come through here in one shape of another.

[17:52] And you can play them for me in a way that's as close to home use only as it gets.

[18:00] These barcades here, Jack Bar and Sunshine and Pioneer Bar.

[18:07] The games are in great condition for the most part.

[18:10] Modern pinball.

[18:12] I can go get my fix and not feel like I can't experience or enjoy these games.

[18:19] I mean I was also just imagining a world in which a world in which home buying and home use

[18:25] pinball didn't even exist.

[18:27] And we went back to just going out to enjoy pinball.

[18:31] The games would be designed differently again.

[18:33] There's something about the way they're designed for the home that has pros and cons to it.

[18:38] I really do believe that.

[18:40] I think they've made the games prettier.

[18:42] But they also want to make them more reliable because they don't have texts working on them.

[18:46] Like our Cades had technicians.

[18:48] So these games have become more simplified from a mechanical standpoint.

[18:54] And that sucks.

[18:56] We want them to be both mechanically complex, easy to understand and play.

[19:03] Look great.

[19:04] Not breakdown.

[19:05] I mean the checklist of what people want in their home is so much longer than the checklist was

[19:11] back in the day when it's just like we need a good theme.

[19:14] It needs to do awesome stuff.

[19:15] And then this game's out of here in a year and we're going to rotate in new games.

[19:18] Like that's not the way it is with the home buyers.

[19:21] Okay.

[19:22] So theme is everything.

[19:23] Theme is everything.

[19:24] So I can't wait to see where my money goes.

[19:27] All right.

[19:27] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[19:30] So the P3 multi-morphic thread has a little bit of life in it.

[19:34] It's I've seen some people posting and the platform as Jerry calls it.

[19:40] People are waiting to see what's the game going to be that finally showcases what the platform is all about.

[19:46] And I saw someone posted something that I was just like this guy gets it.

[19:50] This guy gets it.

[19:52] And he basically to paraphrase he said, look,

[19:55] Jerry needs to stop selling us on the platform.

[19:58] I mean it's always about the platform with the platforms capable of all these variety of

[20:02] games to show you the modular systems and to pop this game in and out.

[20:06] It popped this artwork on and off.

[20:08] And it's just like enough.

[20:10] Just make a great game.

[20:12] You need to wow us with a game.

[20:14] And that's it.

[20:15] And no one gives a crap about platforms.

[20:17] They don't care about all the other stuff.

[20:19] If the game's not great, who cares if you're swapping in and out three to four mediocre games?

[20:24] I'd rather just take one permanent game.

[20:26] That's great.

[20:27] And everyone feels that way.

[20:29] Not everybody tells Jerry that.

[20:30] But everybody feels that way.

[20:32] And this is it.

[20:33] He's got one shot left to show us the game that has all of it.

[20:39] Or else I just wish Jerry would just you just go back and make normal bimba.

[20:42] I just I he's such a smart guy.

[20:45] He's such a smart guy.

[20:46] But eventually you have to like you have to go where the money is and you have to go where the

[20:52] demand is and you got to stop thinking you're the next Steve Jobs trying to make a product.

[20:56] People don't know they want, but they're going to want it.

[20:58] It's been out for seven years.

[20:59] Not selling.

[21:00] Need to game.

[21:01] Need to great game.

[21:03] Speaking of next game.

[21:05] Why is it?

[21:05] Let me ask your question.

[21:07] Do you ever hear stern pinball tell you when they're going to reveal their next title?

[21:12] Never.

[21:13] The stern pinball ever tell you like,

[21:15] you know what event they're going to be at when they pull back the curtain.

[21:17] I don't think so.

[21:18] Do they tell you months and advance four months and advance?

[21:21] Hey, our next game is going to be here.

[21:23] Nope.

[21:24] So why is it that Joe Ballsor has already already told everybody the next American pinball game

[21:31] is going to be at T.P.F.

[21:32] Why would you do that?

[21:34] Joe, why?

[21:35] Why is that a marketing strategy?

[21:37] Hey, it's going to be at T.P.F.

[21:38] I get it again.

[21:39] No one really cares.

[21:40] But I'm just saying no one seems to learn how to launch these games.

[21:46] It's so damn easy.

[21:48] Don't promise a date.

[21:50] Don't tell people when your game's going to be ready until it's actually finished.

[21:55] Don't even reveal it to the world until it's on the line.

[21:58] It's a stern pinball does every time.

[22:01] So now we know T.P.F.

[22:04] the next American pinball game.

[22:05] Now T.P.F is still like December, January, February, March.

[22:09] Four months away.

[22:11] Four months away.

[22:11] I can't imagine much is on the line over at American pinball.

[22:15] Other than the flying Dutchman.

[22:17] Gonna order 15 of those.

[22:19] I can't imagine what's on the line right now.

[22:22] And so now we have to wait four months.

[22:25] And it's going to be at T.P.F.

[22:27] The problem with revealing games at T.P.F.

[22:29] I'm not doing it before the show is very simple.

[22:32] If you don't reveal a game before a show,

[22:36] you then don't have games in boxes for distributors

[22:40] for people to pick up.

[22:42] You also sometimes miss a day or two of having the game on the show floor.

[22:47] Because normally, if you don't get a Friday slot or a Thursday slot to reveal it,

[22:53] you might miss a day or two.

[22:56] But here's, you know how I believe.

[22:58] I don't think you even need shows to reveal games.

[23:00] I mean, stern pinball doesn't do it.

[23:01] You just need to put the title out there.

[23:04] Let the distributors let people know it's available.

[23:07] I just hope that when they reveal this game, it's on the line.

[23:11] Like they can't do another six-month wait to get the game.

[23:14] That those days are just over.

[23:16] Now, unfortunately,

[23:19] here's the risk they take.

[23:20] Here's the big risk.

[23:21] They're going to reveal this game like two or three days after

[23:26] deeproot pinball shows us the final package.

[23:29] And Robert does the entire deeproot auditorium reveal of what

[23:34] the real secret sauce is over at deeproot.

[23:37] Now, here's the problem.

[23:39] If that presentation in March by deeproot really hits.

[23:45] And coming out of it, people are super excited.

[23:48] And the innovations that we've been promised are impressive.

[23:52] I mean, I'd hate to reveal a more traditional approach to pinball right after it.

[23:57] That's all I'm saying.

[23:58] I mean, if they say this and this and this,

[24:01] and then all of a sudden you've got none of that in an American pinball package,

[24:07] it could make it hard to get people in on the game.

[24:10] And we all know that American pinball needs this game to be a hit.

[24:14] And from what they said, they said I would be impressed.

[24:17] And they know I'm a little bit of a cynic when it comes to being impressed in pinball.

[24:20] So I hope it works out for them.

[24:23] But anyway, that's what's happening in March.

[24:25] All right.

[24:26] Now, I heard there's nine big Lebowski's that are about to go to new customers from coin taker.

[24:33] Now, look, if you want a big Lebowski next week,

[24:36] all you got to do the Sunday night, my auction ends.

[24:40] The highest bid right now is 15.5.

[24:42] Now, we can get this bid up more.

[24:44] I know all of you out there listening.

[24:46] If you want a big Lebowski, just email me your price and we'll put it up.

[24:51] Canada pinball at gmail.com.

[24:54] And Sunday night at midnight,

[24:56] whoever has the highest bid in, whether on my Facebook page or my email address,

[25:02] you get the game.

[25:03] And here's what's going to happen.

[25:04] You pay me the money and you get the game's going to go on a truck next week.

[25:08] And you get your big Lebowski from coin taker.

[25:11] From the people that are helping service customers,

[25:15] guarantee delivery from coin taker.

[25:17] All right.

[25:17] And there's a guarantee there's a game inside the box.

[25:20] It's not just very jumping out of the box,

[25:22] being like, believe my lies, believe my lies.

[25:25] I can make 500 on my own.

[25:26] I can do it.

[25:27] I can do it.

[25:28] Why do you want to run the gamble?

[25:30] You're going to get this game.

[25:31] And here's the thing.

[25:32] You can feel good about buying this one,

[25:34] because your money over 12.5 will go to project pinball.

[25:38] All right.

[25:40] All right.

[25:41] Look, I'm not going to...

[25:42] There has been other people talking about how they don't...

[25:45] They're not upset about the Star Wars top.

[25:47] Or I don't really care.

[25:48] Star Wars is the biggest misgame ever.

[25:51] And there's just no way around it.

[25:52] The game's a mess.

[25:53] The game's a mess.

[25:54] The game was poorly designed.

[25:56] Too hard to get into the hyperloop.

[25:58] The code is a mess.

[25:59] It's a layered mess.

[26:00] There's no way that that coding should be like that in that game.

[26:06] No way.

[26:07] They butchered the storyline.

[26:08] All right.

[26:09] Now speaking of the coding,

[26:10] here's what I'm curious.

[26:12] And I don't know what you guys think.

[26:13] So I was listening to the Steve Bowden interview.

[26:16] On I think it was...

[26:19] I want to say special one lit.

[26:21] No, not but...

[26:22] No, no, no, no.

[26:23] Sorry.

[26:23] It was a...

[26:25] Why am I...

[26:26] Slamtail.

[26:26] Sorry.

[26:27] Slamtail podcast.

[26:29] Now, when I listen to Steve talk,

[26:31] and this is I think going to be the challenge for Steve as a coder.

[26:34] And I think every coder is challenged by this.

[26:37] There's two things a coder needs to do.

[26:40] A coder needs to give you a pathway to scoring.

[26:44] Right?

[26:44] You need to know how to score because the objective in Pimball

[26:49] half of it is to get a score.

[26:51] It's how we measure success.

[26:53] Now I would argue that I wish someone would approach coding differently.

[26:57] Like why can't it just be how many dinosaurs did you capture?

[27:01] Why can't that be it?

[27:02] Or how many villains did you jail before the game ended?

[27:06] Right?

[27:07] And then if there's a tie,

[27:09] why not have it like tiebreaker ball that each player gets to do?

[27:12] Like I don't think people have thought about how to code games differently in a way that

[27:20] is could get away from only the scoring approach being the objective in games.

[27:24] I think that is outdated.

[27:27] Okay.

[27:28] So but that is like one goal of a coder is to give you the score pathway.

[27:34] The other is the pathway through the game and the moments of the game and the modes of the game.

[27:40] But the real challenge is this.

[27:43] And this is going to be you know interesting to see if Steve Bowden has this gift.

[27:46] Because I hear people say like oh well he's he knows Pimball is Pimball guy he's going to he's

[27:50] going to nail it.

[27:51] The real gift encoding to me if you were to ask me the gift encoding is about making

[27:59] moments happen in a machine.

[28:01] And you know I'll give you an example of like when I saw this I was like okay.

[28:06] Even though I'm upset about other parts of the assets in the game.

[28:10] Willie Wonka's office that when Joe Katz coded that mode in which half the lights are on and

[28:18] half are off.

[28:19] That's a moment.

[28:20] It's a magical moment in which he made the machine do something really awesome.

[28:27] All right.

[28:27] Get that kind of goose bump feeling when you get into a mode like that.

[28:32] When you when you get to there and back again in Lord of the Rings something about that right.

[28:37] The way the music change or even my favorite ever in Lord of the Rings when you destroy the ring

[28:42] and the whole game goes haywire that's a moment you'll never forget.

[28:46] It's a moment you want to keep getting back to.

[28:49] Okay.

[28:50] When the disappearing magnet happens in todener.

[28:52] I know I know I give examples guys with games that I own I mean sorry.

[28:56] But they're you know that you don't talk like when the ball when sparky when you start that sparky

[29:00] multi ball on Metallica that's a moment with the lights going crazy and it's like you know

[29:05] just the things shaken awesome.

[29:08] Okay.

[29:09] Now that's going to be Boudon's challenge.

[29:11] Can he make a game that gives us moments like that that makes us feel something not just scoring.

[29:19] And sometimes they get a little bit worried when you know these guys are so into tournament play

[29:24] are also behind the coding because I sometimes don't know where what you know what excites them

[29:32] because to them like what might be exciting is play field multipliers and how you get one and

[29:37] like I don't give a crap about play field multipliers never have never will.

[29:42] And I think the majority of you don't give a crap either.

[29:45] All right.

[29:46] So we'll see.

[29:47] All will be revealed to come March.

[29:49] Now look when Razzie gets shown in March.

[29:52] I hope it's done.

[29:54] I mean I really hope it's not some you know 35% coded or 50% coded.

[30:01] All right.

[30:02] All right.

[30:02] So I asked you guys I got some emails.

[30:04] I asked you guys to to email me your top five pinball dream theme.

[30:09] So I'm going to I'm going to read out answers I got from people.

[30:12] Okay.

[30:13] Now before I do that I want to talk about the Twippies real quick.

[30:17] So the Twippies are now officially taking there's like a preliminary voting on the

[30:25] right in categories of the Twippies.

[30:27] Now I'm not worried.

[30:28] I know that we will be included in the drop down category for best pinball podcast.

[30:35] I really hope you vote for a Canadian pinball podcast.

[30:38] You know it means a lot and I appreciate everyone who votes for me.

[30:42] I appreciate every listener I have on this show.

[30:44] I appreciate everyone who gets their family members to vote who've never listened to me.

[30:49] And I hope we win it again this year.

[30:50] So I'm excited about that.

[30:52] But I want you to go and place your votes at the Twippies and show support for the Twippies.

[30:57] Because Jeff and Greg and Zach and the whole committee over there,

[31:02] I think Steve Bowden's on the committee too.

[31:04] They all do a great job with this show.

[31:07] And Ed at a T.P.F. hosting the show.

[31:10] I do think it is one of the most positive and exciting moments of the year in pinball.

[31:17] And I know that manufacturers love it.

[31:19] I know the hardworking people behind the scenes who get recognized.

[31:23] During the Twippies, love it.

[31:25] And it's just a great thing.

[31:27] So I think you guys should go, you know, place your votes.

[31:30] And then, but here's the thing, that's not your vote for Canadian pinball podcast.

[31:34] That's not your final vote.

[31:37] You do have to go back a January 1st through January 30th and vote again.

[31:42] So just don't be confused there that if you vote it now that your votes tallied,

[31:46] it's not.

[31:47] You need to vote again.

[31:48] I think that's right.

[31:49] So Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong.

[31:50] Okay.

[31:51] All right.

[31:53] Let's read some of your emails.

[31:55] All right.

[31:56] Here we go.

[31:56] Here we go.

[31:57] Here we go.

[31:57] Here we go.

[31:59] Top five from Paul Molinari.

[32:02] Hey brother.

[32:03] Hope you had a good Thanksgiving with friends and family.

[32:07] Here are his top five.

[32:09] Top Gun.

[32:11] Big trouble in little China.

[32:13] Beetlejuice.

[32:15] Spaceballs.

[32:16] And goonies.

[32:17] There are so many 80s movies nostalgia titles to choose from,

[32:21] but I have to give it to those ones.

[32:23] Okay.

[32:23] Well Paul, those are all great themes.

[32:25] And you know me, I believe that 80s nostalgia is the sweet spot.

[32:29] If you want to hit a home run with a pinball theme.

[32:32] All right.

[32:32] Thomas Batson said,

[32:36] in reverse order,

[32:39] back to the future number five,

[32:41] strange brew number four,

[32:43] number three gremlins,

[32:45] number two goonies,

[32:46] and number one,

[32:48] beetle juice.

[32:49] Interesting.

[32:49] Two beetle juice votes.

[32:50] And we know that stern pinball passed on making beetle juice.

[32:55] I got an email from,

[32:57] let's see,

[32:58] motivated lawn service.

[32:59] Who's this?

[33:00] I don't know who it is.

[33:01] Number one, rush.

[33:03] From stern,

[33:03] number two,

[33:04] coberkai premium stern,

[33:06] number three,

[33:07] killer clowns from spooky,

[33:10] number four,

[33:11] stranger things from stern.

[33:12] Well, you're going to get your wish there.

[33:14] Number five,

[33:15] Superman 78,

[33:16] Zod premium from stern.

[33:18] I love the very,

[33:19] the very specific

[33:21] version and variation of the game.

[33:23] And he also put number six,

[33:24] transformers g1 vault.

[33:26] All right.

[33:27] I like those.

[33:28] I like those all.

[33:29] Let's see,

[33:30] do do do do.

[33:31] Got an email from,

[33:34] this week in pinball.

[33:36] No, okay.

[33:37] This is, I got this is not a top five,

[33:39] but this the subject was this from James,

[33:42] James G.

[33:43] He says poker run.

[33:44] It's a canada.

[33:46] After all you have said about American pinball

[33:48] and their poor choice of titles,

[33:51] is it possible that American pinball is going to choose poker run

[33:54] as a title?

[33:55] As head to head pinball pointed out,

[33:57] the Valkyries, Sherlock Holmes,

[33:59] and Robin Hood trademarks have been abandoned.

[34:03] A notice of allowance was issued in July for poker run.

[34:07] Remember American posted pictures of keys a few months back

[34:11] as a hint.

[34:12] Apparently a poker run involves driving around

[34:16] to different locations,

[34:18] thus the pictures of car keys.

[34:21] Since you like to speculate,

[34:23] I'd love to hear your opinion on this.

[34:26] Well, my opinion will never change.

[34:30] If you make poker run,

[34:32] you will most likely

[34:35] sell very, very few of them.

[34:37] And I hope it is not poker run.

[34:40] The same way I hoped it was not going to be October.

[34:43] Fest, what is a poker run?

[34:44] I'm just googling it right now.

[34:47] Poker run.

[34:48] A poker run is an organized event

[34:51] in which participants usually using motorcycles,

[34:54] all terrain vehicles, boats,

[34:57] snowmobiles, horses,

[34:59] on foot, or other means of transportation,

[35:02] must visit five to seven checkpoints,

[35:06] drawing a plane card at each one.

[35:08] The object is to have the best poker hand

[35:11] at the end of the run.

[35:13] Okay, well that's probably the most

[35:15] unrelated thing on planet earth.

[35:18] That's an activity that sounds like only

[35:21] .001% of people have ever even done or accomplished.

[35:27] So if you want to make a theme

[35:30] and not sell pinball,

[35:32] then you make poker run.

[35:34] Okay, it's that simple.

[35:36] It's that simple.

[35:37] This is a terrible.

[35:40] This is almost, this is like more obscure

[35:42] than any, any activity I've ever heard.

[35:46] Even cannonball run would be better

[35:48] because at least people have seen the movie.

[35:50] I mean, poker run just has absolutely,

[35:53] I don't know, absolutely no.

[35:54] It's, it's, it's your opinion.

[35:56] Like where is this done?

[35:57] Do you, do you know anyone who's ever done a poker run?

[36:01] I don't.

[36:02] But do you know anyone who likes Batman?

[36:04] Do you know anyone who watches Rick and Morty?

[36:06] Do you know anyone who listens to Alice Cooper?

[36:09] Do you know anyone who's seen Willy Wonka?

[36:10] You see what I'm saying?

[36:12] Don't be stupid.

[36:13] I hope they're not listening to this being like,

[36:15] aw crap, it's too late.

[36:16] We did it.

[36:18] I can't, I can't imagine it's going to be that.

[36:19] All right.

[36:21] All right, let me go some more emails.

[36:23] Then I got to go order dinner.

[36:24] You might, my voice is a little horse night

[36:26] because I had my holiday party last night.

[36:30] Killed me, killed me, absolutely killed me.

[36:31] All right, Steve Peridese is

[36:33] Canadian top themes.

[36:36] Do not want it made by Stern.

[36:38] I love that clarification.

[36:39] If that's not shade, I don't know what it is.

[36:41] Just, he's like, here's what I love.

[36:43] Please, Stern, don't ruin what I love.

[36:45] Okay.

[36:46] Number one, the expanse.

[36:48] And I have seen it.

[36:49] If you have not watched it, you should see season three

[36:52] is the best sci-fi TV ever.

[36:55] Season four starts on the 13th as Amazon original.

[36:58] All right, I need to watch season three.

[37:01] I think I've seen season two halfway

[37:03] through the proto-moral kill.

[37:06] It's a good show.

[37:07] It is a good show.

[37:08] It keeps your attention.

[37:11] Do I think the expanse would sell?

[37:12] But that wasn't the question.

[37:14] It's dream theme.

[37:16] Steve, you're allowed to love it.

[37:17] And then aliens.

[37:18] He said, yes, I know highway pinball.

[37:20] But I've never seen or played this machine.

[37:22] And it was never really available.

[37:24] Can't think of five.

[37:25] I do agree with Matrix and Transformers the movie.

[37:28] I love that movie as a child.

[37:30] Unicron blown away.

[37:32] He said, I need your advice.

[37:34] I have a deposit down for a medieval man as royal.

[37:38] I am not rich.

[37:40] 10K is a lot of money to me.

[37:42] You obviously are really good with making smart pinball purchases.

[37:46] Is it hard to gauge this as there are no numbers released?

[37:50] I have been going back and forth

[37:52] if I'm going through with the purchase.

[37:54] Not asking if I should buy or not.

[37:57] Just if you have any details.

[37:59] Are they actually sold out now?

[38:01] Any idea how many were made?

[38:03] My wife and I do love the game.

[38:05] It's our favorite of all time.

[38:08] All right, Steve.

[38:09] Great question.

[38:10] Great question.

[38:11] And here's the thing.

[38:12] I don't think we're ever going to get a number of royals made.

[38:18] I think that number will remain secret

[38:21] as to, for some reason, as to not upset the Ellie owners.

[38:25] But every Ellie owner knows there's less royals than Ellie.

[38:28] So it's more limited.

[38:30] I think at 10K, a royal edition of medieval madness

[38:36] will be a good buy for you.

[38:37] And here's why.

[38:38] I don't think you're going to lose value on the game.

[38:40] I don't.

[38:41] I think if you love it and you enjoy it, the game is gorgeous.

[38:45] People have sent me photos when they saw it at IAPA.

[38:48] And it's incredible looking.

[38:51] And they went, they went the extra mile and put so much in that game for $10,000.

[38:56] I mean, it's laughable.

[38:57] What's in that game for $10,000 and then what's in a virus signature edition.

[39:02] So I think you're good.

[39:03] I think you're good.

[39:04] I think it's a game that you might be able to play and enjoy.

[39:06] And if you ever sell it,

[39:08] I really think these games are going to hold their value

[39:10] and you're not going to be out much money.

[39:12] So just maintain it, take good care of it,

[39:15] and you'll go in on it.

[39:17] Now, you don't need a royal.

[39:18] You could always get the other editions and save money.

[39:23] But if it is your favorite game like you said,

[39:26] and you want to treat yourself,

[39:28] I wouldn't look at it like we're losing $10,000.

[39:31] You know, you're acquiring a toy that you can play that's holding its value very nicely.

[39:37] So that's what I would do if I were you.

[39:39] All right.

[39:40] Let's see what else we got.

[39:41] Themes, Twippies.

[39:41] I got Kelly Daniels said,

[39:44] I am asking all of our fans to early vote for us for best location.

[39:50] I'm also asking them to write in

[39:52] Canadian Pimball Podcasts for Best Podcasts.

[39:54] Well, thank you so much, Kelly.

[39:56] You should win hands down.

[39:58] You are most deserving.

[39:59] And Kelly's place is the Pimball Palace in Brunswick, Georgia.

[40:05] So Kelly, thank you for emailing me.

[40:07] Now, everyone who listens to this show,

[40:08] if you don't know of a place to write in for a location,

[40:12] how about throwing Kelly a bone and voting for the Pimball Palace in Brunswick,

[40:17] Georgia.

[40:18] Kelly, thank you for the note.

[40:20] All right.

[40:20] And thank you for the votes.

[40:21] And thank you for asking your people there to vote for me as well.

[40:24] I got to get merchandise going.

[40:25] I got to get it going so people can wear it.

[40:28] All right.

[40:28] I got top five from Mark Nellis.

[40:30] He said, you asked everyone to mail in their top five unmade games.

[40:35] Here are his Toho Godzilla.

[40:39] All right.

[40:39] He said, the screen should have clips from the old movies.

[40:41] It should have a mechanical Godzilla similar to the T-Rex and Jurassic Park

[40:45] and Keith L.

[40:46] when as the designer.

[40:48] Well, you know, it's coming.

[40:50] Stern has the license.

[40:51] I don't know if they're going to make it.

[40:52] Number two, Ozzy Osborne, original music pen.

[40:56] Not a re-themed like Beatles.

[40:58] Number three, Dungeons and Dragons TV show,

[41:02] made after the Saturday animated show.

[41:04] The screen would show clips from the show relating to gameplay, etc.

[41:09] All the call outs and music could be pulled from the original show

[41:12] should be cheap to license compared to others.

[41:15] Okay.

[41:16] D&D fan, huh?

[41:17] Journey, original music pen,

[41:21] and Pokemon.

[41:22] You could have pinballs that are powder coated to look like Pokeballs.

[41:25] Like first, you know, look,

[41:27] Pokemon pinball not existing is crazy.

[41:32] If you want to expand pinball, you make a Pokemon.

[41:35] The problem is it's probably super expensive,

[41:37] but I can't imagine why there's not a Pokemon pinball machine.

[41:41] It would be perfect.

[41:43] Top five dream themes from Tony La Machia.

[41:48] He says, Hey, Chris, big fan of the show found you about a year ago

[41:52] right around the time of your second twippy nomination.

[41:55] Really enjoy the honesty and passion in your podcast.

[42:00] You will definitely be getting my vote this year.

[42:02] Sorry, Zach.

[42:04] I was born in 85, so Ghostbusters and TMNT are my true dream themes.

[42:09] But those pins have already been made.

[42:11] Anyways, here are my top five dream themes in no particular order.

[42:15] Number one, Michael Jackson Moonwalker.

[42:18] Trudeau's come back in all man.

[42:20] All man, it's too soon.

[42:21] It's too soon to match up Trudeau and Michael Jackson.

[42:26] I love Moonwalker, by the way.

[42:30] I mean, imagine a Moonwalker pin in which the final wizard mode is just

[42:34] smooth criminal.

[42:35] Oh, so good.

[42:38] National lampoon's ex-miss vacation.

[42:40] Another one.

[42:41] I mean, that movie is iconic and the scenes are great.

[42:45] I mean, I know it would be a little strange to have

[42:49] a Christmas pinball machine, but a movie like that with all the humor,

[42:53] all the lines and all the funny things you could put in it mechanically.

[42:57] You know, light up, you got to light up the house.

[42:58] Imagine a little house toy when all the lights like,

[43:01] you know, you got to figure out how to turn them on.

[43:03] You know, like everything, you have to like cook the turkey,

[43:06] the turkey deflates.

[43:06] You have to, you go shopping.

[43:09] You have to, you find the Griswold Christmas tree.

[43:13] You know, there's, you can almost, you go sledding in it.

[43:16] Imagine you could have like a sledding ramp and you got to get the ball to the top.

[43:20] All the different scenes actually would make the best modes for pinball.

[43:23] So I love that idea.

[43:25] Number four, grateful dead.

[43:28] All right, well, you know, I'm not a deadhead, but I could see why people love the deads.

[43:32] NHL hockey.

[43:34] All right.

[43:34] Well, look, I mean, I think these are all great ones.

[43:37] I think that Michael Jackson has been thrown around a lot.

[43:41] And it's just the most expensive music to license.

[43:44] I doubt we'll ever see it because of that.

[43:47] All right, last one, and he cheated.

[43:49] Kevin Clemens gave me 10.

[43:51] And I'm going to read them quickly because, you know, Kevin,

[43:55] you're like not following the assignment.

[43:57] Number one, inception.

[43:59] That's really weird for a pin man.

[44:00] I got to be honest.

[44:01] Number two, matrix, of course.

[44:03] First movie only.

[44:04] Of course, I agree with that.

[44:07] Three breaking bad.

[44:08] That's, yeah.

[44:10] You know, maybe is it, but is breaking bad like a good pinball like theme?

[44:15] Like I get the show.

[44:17] But, but pinball.

[44:19] I don't know.

[44:19] Kill Bill.

[44:21] Same thing with Kill Bill.

[44:22] I don't know.

[44:22] Something about like movies that are a little bit more serious and violent.

[44:24] I don't know if they make perfect pinball machines.

[44:26] But number five, night member for Christmas.

[44:30] Someone's making that.

[44:30] Number six, the shining.

[44:32] Number seven jaws.

[44:34] We've been hearing jaws forever.

[44:35] Number eight, James Bond.

[44:37] He writes all actors, all films.

[44:39] And then it's like, I just think in like, yeah,

[44:41] that's all impossible because of how much money that would cost.

[44:44] Number nine, jeep off-road adventure.

[44:47] Well, that, okay.

[44:48] You'll sell five of those.

[44:50] Come on.

[44:50] I mean, Kevin, I shouldn't be racking on them.

[44:52] These are your dream themes.

[44:53] I'm sorry.

[44:53] I'm sorry.

[44:54] It's the end of day.

[44:55] And number 10, Motley Crew.

[44:56] Well, we know somebody has the Motley Crew license

[44:58] and so that's going to happen.

[45:00] I think we're going to see the crew game

[45:02] from Stern Pimball next year.

[45:04] All right, everybody.

[45:05] Sorry if I've been like breathing heavy.

[45:07] I'm like hungover.

[45:08] I feel crappy.

[45:09] But I wanted to get you a new episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[45:13] Before we say goodnight,

[45:15] just want to say,

[45:17] you know, our condolences to the passing of Gene Cunningham

[45:20] that happened.

[45:22] For those of you who know, he passed away.

[45:24] I believe it was a week or two ago.

[45:26] And Gene brought Big Bang Bar back into the world.

[45:30] Huge part of the Pimball community.

[45:32] So we just want to, you know,

[45:33] our condolences and our thoughts and prayers with his family.

[45:36] I might have someone come on the show

[45:38] who actually worked with Gene.

[45:40] I think Gene's like financial advisor,

[45:42] banker to tell some stories.

[45:44] So that will be coming from Canadian Spinball Podcast as well.

[45:47] Everyone have a great night.

[45:49] And we will talk to you soon.

[45:50] Rick and Morty theme song to close out.

[45:53] Whatever.

[45:53] I don't even know this song.

[45:55] I just, I'm playing it for you.

[45:56] Bye.
