[00:00] Nothing ever lasts forever, everybody wants to move on.

[00:30] I haven't heard anybody out there in the pinball content space reveal to you who the designer

[00:35] is, the mystery designer of this John Wick pinball machine.

[00:39] I'm going to give it to you here first.

[00:41] In exclusive, Canada loves scooping these pinball companies and I know this is why you love

[00:46] being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:49] I'm also going to upload it to my Patreon page because for some of you out there, you might

[00:54] be sleeping, you might be around the world and once the name gets out there, it's out

[00:59] there but I love breaking these scoops and I love the fact that now everybody out there

[01:04] who doesn't like Canada has to say that Canada is reporting.

[01:09] Okay, so here's the thing.

[01:10] I got a little bit of information on John Wick and before I tell you who the designer

[01:14] is, I want to give you the overall feedback I'm getting on this game and here's the thing.

[01:20] It is a little bit of the hype train is about to leave the station.

[01:25] It is a little bit about the next game from Stern is going to be the best game of all

[01:29] time.

[01:30] We always hear this every single time so before I do this and tell you the hype I've heard,

[01:35] I want to tell you what I want you to do which is just wait and see.

[01:40] I don't think any modern Stern ever is ever going to be worth $13,000 for an LE or $9,500

[01:50] for a premium.

[01:51] I don't care what they put into these games.

[01:54] These games are all so overpriced so keep that in mind.

[01:59] You are not going to have a hard time at all getting a new in box LE of any Stern pinball

[02:06] machine ever so you don't have to run and buy one right away.

[02:11] You're also not going to ever have a hard time getting a premium because they will make

[02:15] them for the next five years and if you just wait they're all going to be selling for much

[02:20] less than $9,500 and pros are for hoes even though pros hold their value the most.

[02:27] They don't have all the features and so look you know how it is in pinball these days people

[02:32] just wait.

[02:33] Okay so here's what I'm hearing and this is not me saying this so take this with a grain

[02:37] of salt.

[02:38] I'm hearing from people that have played this game from people that have flipped this pinball

[02:43] machine from people some of which are distributors some of which are coming third party to me

[02:48] as well.

[02:49] I've been collecting this information over the last day and a half or so I didn't want

[02:54] to spill this on the Saturday morning spectacular because I wanted you guys who are club members

[02:59] to hear it here first.

[03:01] So here's the thing man I've heard from people that have played this game they've played

[03:06] the recent games from Stern pinball and they are saying that John Wick is more fun to play

[03:13] and more unique and more entertaining and gives you that one more ball I got to jump

[03:19] on the game again feel they're saying this game is more fun than Jaws pinball and then

[03:26] Foo Fighters and that's stiff competition you know it's one thing if they said it's more

[03:30] fun to shoot than James Bond but to say this game is more fun than Jaws to flip and more

[03:35] fun than Foo Fighters two games that are really heralded in the pinball community as great

[03:41] shooting games.

[03:42] I'm also hearing a lot of comparisons between this and Jaws and just how when you see this

[03:48] game you're going to see a lot more uniqueness you're going to see a lot more fun stuff to

[03:54] shoot at and I think that kind of holds true with how I felt about Jaws pinball since it's

[03:59] been out I mean it's a tough theme for pinball to begin with it's not high energy like John

[04:04] Wick it's a slow movie about a shark it's also a game when you walk up to it there's

[04:09] nothing really wow in it mechanically and they definitely didn't nail that world under

[04:14] glass with Jaws and that's what I'm hearing about John Wick is you're really going to

[04:19] see a design that doesn't feel like every other stern machine and now that we've had

[04:25] so many Elwyn games they're starting to feel somewhat similar you know Jack Danger's Foo

[04:30] Fighters was original but this John Wick game coming from a brand new designer is going to

[04:36] have a very unique feel now I don't know any of the mechanisms I don't know who's doing

[04:42] the artwork I don't know if they're using movie clips I would be shocked if this game

[04:47] is not going to be asset heavy from the movie it is absolutely going to have movie clips

[04:52] and Keanu Reeves it's not going to be like an animated John Wick adventure people so

[04:57] fully expect to see Keanu Reeves all over this game fully expect to see Keanu do callouts

[05:03] fully expect him to be a part of this game throughout what I can tell you is this is

[05:09] this game is going to have three ramps in it which also leads me to believe that there

[05:15] will be more than two flippers in this game so you heard it here first a three ramp game

[05:21] in John Wick I heard the action is really fast I hear it's really fun I hear it really

[05:27] captures that sort of energy of John Wick the other thing I know about this game is the

[05:32] entire game is being designed by a younger team that is super hungry to make a name for

[05:38] themselves yes Tim Sexton is coding the game I also heard that Tim Sexton is a humongous

[05:45] John Wick fanboy so you know I was saying yesterday on my Saturday show I'm just nervous

[05:50] that Tim Sexton doesn't seem to embody the bravado of John Wick well apparently he's

[05:56] living vicariously through John Wick and him and the young design team working on this

[06:01] game are humongous John Wick fans I'm also here to confirm for you that this game was

[06:08] designed from the ground up to be John Wick this was not a game they were designing to

[06:14] be something else and then they lost the license yes I will confirm for you the theme that

[06:20] they were designing by John Borg where they lost the license was Indiana Jones so if

[06:26] you were waiting for that Indiana Jones game it was made there is an Indiana Jones game designed

[06:32] by John Borg sitting somewhere in a room at Stern pinball that we will never get to play

[06:38] alright what else can I tell you about this game I mean not that much more people the other

[06:43] thing I'm just hearing is that for those of you skeptical about John Wick those of you who

[06:48] think it's gonna be just like a B theme I mean I've been saying that I'm like it's gonna be

[06:52] another venom it's not gonna come out and have any like wow factor to it I'm hearing the complete

[06:57] opposite now I'm hearing that venom was boring that this game is gonna shoot so much better and be

[07:03] so much more interesting to stand over and flip and so yes so the big news left drumroll please is

[07:10] who is designing this game well before I tell you his name I want to tell you that this designer

[07:16] has worked on he's worked on the following games at Stern pinball you might have seen his name but

[07:22] you might not have remembered it it's not a name that gets talked about very often and he's being

[07:28] promoted from within Stern pinball from his current role to role of head designer and he worked on

[07:35] WWE well don't hold him accountable for that because he gets much better after that he worked on

[07:41] Ghostbusters he worked on Star Wars he worked on Monsters he worked on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

[07:48] he worked on Rush and he worked on James Bond and so ladies and gentlemen the designer of John Wick

[07:55] Pinball Stern pinball's mechanical engineer Elliot Eisman now what excites me about Elliot working

[08:02] on this game as lead designer is this guy's an engineer he thinks in mechanisms and toys and if

[08:10] he's a mechanical engineer and he's bringing the world of John Wick to life I'm really excited that

[08:16] Elliot is now graduating into the designer role because you know like sometimes we get designers

[08:22] and they don't have like the mindset for mechanical engineering they might get layout they might

[08:27] play pinball a lot but they don't have a background in engineering and so there it is ladies and

[08:33] gentlemen canadis pinball podcast I'm getting excited about John Wick I'm still not going to order

[08:38] one right away because of the pricing but Elliot Eisman is the designer he's been at Stern Pinball

[08:44] for 10 years he's worked on a lot of games he is your lead John Wick designer take that news with

[08:51] you spread it across the pinball content world and just don't forget the name is Canada and he

[08:58] does it again love you guys thank you for the support we're gonna have a lot to talk about this

[09:03] week and I'm hoping I'm gonna be a father any minute now we're still waiting for this baby and

[09:08] that's why I'm still doing this pinball content I think everyone in the household is very anxious

[09:13] and nervous we're getting ready and a final shout out yesterday we came back to our apartment and

[09:18] there was a box waiting for us it was a beautiful basket a hamper as Brenda would say in Ireland

[09:24] of baby products for the newborn baby thank you Mr. Stephen Jablonsky not only for your $100 a month

[09:32] contribution but also for the Jablonsky family being so amazing we had so much fun opening that

[09:39] up and it just reminds everybody every once in a while that the pinball community is amazing and

[09:45] that is why each and every one of you right now I can feel it in you that five dollars a month you

[09:50] just want to increase it to ten dollars now you're getting what you pay for and then some now that

[09:56] canada's got two kids you know it's gonna get expensive I'm never gonna force you to pay more

[10:01] but it would mean so much if people went from five dollars to ten dollars a month and you guys are

[10:06] definitely gonna get the best pinball content on the planet later everybody happy Sunday fun day later
