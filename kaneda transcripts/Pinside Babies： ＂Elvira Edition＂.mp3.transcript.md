[00:00] One big baby, we'll make our dreams come true.

[00:05] One big baby, we'll do the same for you.

[00:11] Silla, silla, silla, silla, silla.

[00:15] There will be explicit language on this episode of Canadian's Pennside Babies L. Virah Edition.

[00:21] So if you have young kids and you don't want to hear any curse words, you've got three

[00:25] seconds to turn this show off. I swear to God, 1, 2, 3. What the fuck people are you all

[00:34] crying about with Elvira? My God! It's like Stern Pimball gives you new games almost like

[00:40] every other month it feels like and you bitch and moan about fan fucking layouts. Let me

[00:47] tell you something why it's called a fan fucking layout. The keyword being fan, people are

[00:52] fans of this fucking kind of layout. Alright, there are shots that you can hit from both

[00:58] the left and right flipper of the play field and everything's makeable with just two flippers.

[01:05] And if hey, here's the good fucking news people, if you don't want a fan fucking layout,

[01:09] how about you go by Jurassic fucking park? Both of which are made by Stern Pimball because

[01:15] they don't give a flying fuck that you don't like game A because they know you'll buy

[01:21] game B. And hey, if you don't like game B, go buy game fucking C and D. This company gives

[01:28] you 4 to 5 to 6 fucking games a year and you fucking bitch about layouts. My fucking God.

[01:36] Hey, guess what else was a fan fucking layout? You ready for it? The first two fucking Elvira

[01:42] games. So what the fuck were you expecting? And guess what has plastic fucking ramps?

[01:48] The last Elvira fucking game. Some of you live in a fucking bubble in which you look at

[01:54] these games and you don't understand where they're coming from, what they're paying homage

[01:59] to. Alright, yes, there are some things about this game I would bitch about and I will

[02:03] bitch about it and I will become a pin-side baby myself on this podcast. But for fuck's

[02:10] things, let's just look at this game and let's step back and think about it in the context

[02:15] of where we are. It's September, right? Early September 2019 and Stern Pimball has given

[02:22] us another game to get excited about and guess what? We're all crying about it. Oh my

[02:28] God, I can't believe it. What the fuck is this? And hey, hey, let's start with the good.

[02:33] The stuff that you guys should stop fucking morning about. There is a fucking cool fucking

[02:37] house in the back of this game. It's not crappy plastics screwed together. It's actually

[02:42] a nice sculpted mansion. That is going to look super fucking cool. And when I hear people

[02:48] crying, like, oh, just a van vogue and layout. Hey, let me tell you what else is a fan fucking

[02:52] layout. And it's probably one of Stern's best fucking games ever. It's called Batman

[02:56] 66, alright? Now look at, look, I actually think there's more interesting stuff to shoot

[03:02] at in this game than there is in Batman 66. And think about how fucking good Batman 66

[03:09] is right now. It's one of Stern's best games ever. And this game has more exciting shots

[03:15] in it if you ask me. And it doesn't look like a clunk fest like Batman 66 and it's got

[03:21] lime and fucking sheets on it as well. And they have fucking Cassandra who's going to

[03:27] do all sorts of amazing fucking callouts in this game. And we haven't even seen any of

[03:32] that yet. Right? I think what we've seen right now is just a shell of what this game

[03:36] will be. Oh, but how dare Stern make a fan fucking layout and how dare Stern make games

[03:41] that are fun to shoot and how dare Stern make games that people will enjoy playing. How

[03:45] dare they do that? They should mix it up more. Where the fuck are the pop bumpers? I hear

[03:50] people say, where the fuck are the pop? Let me tell you where the pop bumpers are. People

[03:53] are up your butts. Who gives a shit where the pop bumpers are. They're going to be there

[03:57] somewhere as if fucking pop bumpers are the reason why you buy these fucking games. Where

[04:02] to God? If I made a fucking pinball machine with 18 fucking pop bumpers, you guys would be

[04:07] clapping to the high heavens. Hey, they finally did it different. Hey, four pop bumpers.

[04:12] This game's much different. It's not fuck you guys. Let me tell you something. Fan fucking

[04:17] layouts. They work. What the fuck? There's only so much you can fucking do with a piece

[04:22] of wood. Right? And it's not even big. There's not a lot of real estate under there. So

[04:27] let's see what you would do. And hey, you're also acting like there's not other fucking

[04:31] options. Go buy a fucking dialed in if you want a different layout. Go buy a Willy Wonka.

[04:36] Go buy a Jurassic Park. Right? Oh my God. Oh, first they gave us monsters. That was a

[04:41] fan layout. Then they did this. What is Stern thinking? Let me tell you something. Stern

[04:46] has 80 to fucking 90% of the market. You know why? Because they give the fans what they

[04:50] fucking want. All right. What else is going on in this fucking game so far? A game that

[04:54] nobody's flipped a game that's nobody's played a game that no one has experienced has

[04:59] got all these people up in arms. Now let me let me let me play devil's advocate on one

[05:03] part of this because I actually when I saw this game for the first time, I was drawn

[05:09] to that big haunted house. Now I have to say this. And again, the art package on this

[05:14] game, I think sucks. And I'm just going to be honest. It sucks. And I had someone on

[05:20] my Facebook page get all mad at me because at first I said like it's Greg. It's Greg

[05:24] Ferris. Okay. Not not Ferris Ferris. And I said, look, he needs to fucking hang it up.

[05:29] He needs to fucking hang this. This is our package is fucking piss poor. I mean, look, and

[05:34] I'm not being in the reason why I'm saying this is Greg went and got zombie Yeti and Greg

[05:40] when in God fucking Christopher, Franchi. Now you can't tell me after seeing what Christopher

[05:46] Franchi did with the monsters. And then you look at this play field and the lack of detail

[05:52] and the lack of drawing in it and the lack of like attention to things. It's mind boggling

[05:58] that Stern is going backwards with this game. And I know what people are saying like Chris,

[06:03] you don't understand pinball fucking history and and Dennis Norman and Greg did like the

[06:07] other games. And it's just, you know, we're keeping the team together. But I'm here to

[06:11] say that it's such a bullshit like this entire industry needs to get over the fact that

[06:16] I don't give a shit how legacy you are. If you are not as talented as new talent in this

[06:23] hobby, it is time to pass the reins to the new people. Show of hands out there. Who would

[06:30] not rather have had Christopher Franchi do the art package on this game show show. I mean,

[06:35] everybody would. And yet they didn't do that. And what is just some politics is like it's

[06:40] just Greg gets to do it because he did one and two. It's so silly. And you can't make people forget

[06:47] how good it could be because we saw it on monsters. We saw it on Batman 66. We've seen

[06:52] zombie Yeti do amazing work. Who by the way is probably going to be teenage muting into turtles.

[06:57] Is the cornerstone? I think it's probably next on the list. We were talking about that. But anyway,

[07:01] look, I would I would redo the art package on this game. It just looks so barren. And but here's

[07:08] the butt. And this was some of you babies been talking about how many fucking inserts are there

[07:13] on this fucking game? My god, can you even put artwork on a play field that has 18,000 inserts?

[07:20] What the fuck is with all these inserts? I don't I mean, I get it. You look at some of the old

[07:25] games you're a Chris. You don't understand Pimbo history. Why do you have a Pimbo podcast? You don't

[07:29] care. You're not furthering in the hobby. You need to kiss ass on every new thing that comes out.

[07:33] But here's the thing. I know some of the old games like scared stiff has that ladder climbing of

[07:38] inserts, but there are so many freaking inserts in this play field that it makes it impossible

[07:43] to do an art package. And I do agree with some of you babies out there that this these wide open

[07:48] play fields. There's nothing. There is nothing in the middle of that play field at all. The ball

[07:54] is just a just can go anywhere you want. When you want to go left, you want to go right, you want to

[07:57] go straight. You want to go anywhere you can roll around. You can zigzag whatever because there's

[08:00] nothing there. There's no targets in that pop up. There's nothing interesting. It's completely wide

[08:05] open just like Batman 66, right? There's nothing that pops up. All the shots are up the play field.

[08:12] Straight up. All the shots are, you know, typical fan layout. They're, you know, but but but here's

[08:17] the butt people. How can you look at this game and not say to yourself, this thing does look fun

[08:24] to flip? All right. Do you look at this game and it looks boring? I don't know. It looks, see,

[08:29] I think this game and this is what this is why I think the biggest thing missing right now with

[08:34] you fucking babies is what's missing from the game right now that you're not getting in any of

[08:38] these photos is the fucking story of the game is the personality of Elvira. I mean, I don't know

[08:45] exactly what the story will be, but I see all these like cinematic film looks like black and white

[08:50] film reels. Are you making an Elvira movie? Are you making the movie Elvira and the haunted house?

[08:56] It says like director's cut and I don't know. It's I think this game is going to fucking wake up

[09:02] once you see the fucking code and Elvira and her callouts and what Lyman does with it. All of it

[09:09] is going to make total fucking sense. And yes, yes, I think you're right. The art is so bad. It's like

[09:15] because here's the thing that sucks is I think Lyman's going to blow this away, but this game could have

[09:20] been so much sexier. It could have been and it should have been and then you can't go do it over

[09:25] again. And that is my only big gripe is like you get one fucking chance to put the most amazing

[09:30] art package in a game. And if you fuck it up, it's fucked up forever and there's nothing you can do.

[09:34] You can always go back with code and change things. You can always go back and do this and that.

[09:38] But two things will always be fucking constant in a game. The design of the shots and the

[09:44] mechs and the fucking art and you need to fucking nail both of those. And I think Stern, I do, I think

[09:49] they fucked up the art in this game and look at the fucking translate. So there's same on both models

[09:54] of the game. The fucking side art is like the back box is all the same. It's like this is not

[10:00] very creative. It also leads me to believe that this the money for this game went into all the

[10:06] mechanisms and the different scopes and the things they put into the game. And then they went

[10:10] cheap on the art, but I don't fucking know why. I think Stern needs to fucking call Christopher

[10:14] Franci up and say, hey, look bro, we're sorry. We need you. You need him. He sells you more games.

[10:21] He sells you more games and George and Greg. Come on guys. Fucking hey, you get one chance to make

[10:27] Elvira three. Make it as beautiful as you can. You cannot tell me that this is as good as you can

[10:33] do with the R packages. All right. But what else are people crying about? Okay. Well, there's not much

[10:37] else. Right. This is what happens all the time. Day one game gets revealed. Everyone's like, oh my

[10:42] god, what the fuck is this? I can't take it. What the fuck? Another fan layout Stern? How dare you do this?

[10:47] I'm done with Stern. I'm done with them. I'm never buying another one. Then here's what's going to

[10:52] happen this week. They're going to say, hey, we're making this many LEDs. I think it's 400 and this

[10:57] many super LEDs. And here's what's going to happen. They're going to sell the fuck out overnight.

[11:01] They're going to sell out immediately because for most of you guys out there, just because they put

[11:05] a big pair of boobs on the translate, that's all you needed and never wanted in fucking pinball. And

[11:10] be honest. You can't say that on Facebook no more because people will tell you you're not allowed

[11:14] to be attracted to those kinds of things in 2019. You can't do that. I mean, I do give them credit.

[11:20] They they did not shy away from some cleavage. I mean, it is like it is popping out. Now is the

[11:26] artwork to Cartoon who gives it should I do like the translate? I do I do I want to see more

[11:31] Elvira. I want to see more Elvira on the play field where the fuck is Elvira on the play field?

[11:37] It's like fucking what I look. This is a fucking weird pinside baby's episode. I myself am turning

[11:43] into the pinside baby, but here's the thing. Here's the thing. I think everybody needs to just take

[11:49] a big step back and realize one fucking thing. Stern just gave you Jurassic Park. Stern, this is not

[11:57] a cornerstone. You are going to get teenage mutant Ninja Turtles with Zambietti on it. And I think

[12:04] that game is going to look incredible. We know it's going to look incredible. But here's my frustration.

[12:10] Here's my frustration. Why does Lyman Sheets end up on like he's on this game?

[12:19] Would you rather shouldn't he be on the cornerstone game? If the cornerstone game is Ninja Turtles,

[12:26] why isn't that Lyman? They must just let Lyman pick what he wants to do.

[12:33] They must. But I have to say like, you know, I would rather if you're Lyman Sheets and you're the

[12:39] best coder in the history of Pimball. And he is. He's the best coder ever. Put the man on the

[12:45] cornerstone titles. All right. All right. But look, look guys, here's the deal. Here's the deal.

[12:51] Stern Pimball is Stern Pimball. And sometimes I think you guys wake up and you expect Stern to do

[12:57] something like radically different. Stern has so many games for sale right now. And the options they

[13:04] give you to buy. You know, look, let's go on Stern Pimball right now. Are we going to do it right now?

[13:09] Stern Pimball. You have the guys have to listen to me do this. I might have no more listeners after

[13:14] this show. Stern Pimball. All right. SternPimball.com. Now, how many games can you go by from Stern Pimball

[13:21] right now? New and box. Let's see. All games that are for sale. Let's see. They've got Jurassic Park.

[13:27] All right. They've got Black Knight sort of rage. They've got the monsters. They've got Beatles.

[13:33] They've got Deadpool. They've got Iron Maiden. They've got Guardians of the Galaxy. Star Wars,

[13:40] Star Trek, and Batman 66. Right now, these are the games available for sale. Let's count them

[13:46] for you children out there in Pinside. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

[13:53] ten fucking games. Ten fucking games. How many games can you go by new and box from Jersey

[13:59] Jack Pimball right now? How many can you buy from spooky? How many can you buy from Chicago gaming

[14:05] company? How many can you buy from everyone else, American Pimball? It gets one per company,

[14:13] maybe two at most, but it's one per company. Ten fucking titles. And it's not going to stop because

[14:20] you know what's not even up here. Elvira. That's number 11 Ninja Turtles. Number 12. I hear the

[14:25] coming out with Led Zeppelin as well. That's a re-skin of some game. What game is it again? I forget,

[14:31] I like, hold on a second. I should have done my homework here. Here we go. Here we go. Ready for it,

[14:40] ready for it, ready for it, ready for it, ready for it, ready for it. A re-skin of Quicksilver will be

[14:47] Led Zeppelin. Quicksilver is an old stern game. Is that going to happen? I don't know. But my

[14:51] point is this. Day one, everyone bitches. Day two, everyone goes and buys every single one of

[14:56] these games. I think this game is going to sell much better. I even said this. I think it's going

[15:01] to sell much better than fucking Jurassic Park LEDs in terms of selling out just because it's a

[15:07] wire. I think people love this franchise. But look, look, if you're Keith Owen, you probably can't

[15:14] be too excited right, fucking now because you're like, my game just came out. You got to give a game

[15:20] some time to fucking get an audience going and immediately, here we go, something else. And I'll

[15:26] say this, like I think Jurassic Park has a more interesting layout for sure. I think Elvira's got

[15:33] more fun toys in it. Now, I know there's speculation that that vertical upkick on the right is

[15:38] going to fire the fucking ball across the playfield into that trunk. No fucking way. There is no way

[15:45] that does that. And if it does fucking do that, I'd be fucking happy to see that happen. I just

[15:50] don't know how you do that without destroying the trunk on the other side of the playfield. But maybe

[15:56] they figured it out. I would love to see it do it. I think it's going to come out of that vertical

[16:00] upkick and hit the targets in front of the trunk. But even then, I think everyone's like, oh,

[16:05] but the fucking clear code is going to chip off if it's coming out of that vertical upkick. So I

[16:08] hope they figured that fucking problem out. Now, notice we're not seeing any more fucking artwork

[16:13] underneath the post. In the in the in the in the L.E.s of Jurassic Park, there's no longer artwork

[16:18] under the post. And the same is true here. So look, I'm going to end this fucking Pinside Baby's

[16:23] episode. It's just a little bit of a stupid rant. I think that you guys out there are going to see

[16:28] a lot more of Elvira this week. I think there's more to be excited about them. There is to cry about

[16:33] in this hobby. I do think I do think this hobby is heading for oversaturation beyond belief.

[16:40] And I think that every other company out there should be really worried because I think Stern

[16:46] is releasing these games quickly. And I think they're doing it to bury the competition. I really do.

[16:52] I think they're going to they know what they've got. And when I talk to people over at Stern,

[16:56] and when I talk to people who know what's going on over there, they have this like shit eating

[17:01] grin on their face because they know that they have so many epic things coming down the road

[17:08] for people to get excited about. And here's the thing that all you fucking babies need to realize.

[17:12] Not every fucking game is for you. They are going to scratch the itch of different fan bases.

[17:18] Now, if they do, they always get it right. Absolutely fucking not. I'll be the first fucking person

[17:22] to tell you on this podcast like Stern fucking destroyed half my dreams. Like Stern's Star Wars to

[17:29] me is the biggest fucking miss of all time. Stern Ghostbusters is another huge fucking design miss.

[17:34] How the fuck do you let John Trudeau put a flipper gap like that? George Gomez, I'm talking to you,

[17:39] my friend. How do you play that game and see that flipper gap and how do you not turn to John Trudeau

[17:46] and be like, what the fuck did you do, bro? Like move these flippers in. You know, that's a game that

[17:52] would have benefited from more of a fan fucking layout because the flipper gap fucking ruins the whole

[17:57] experience. Right? So there's just games out there that just, you know, they didn't really bring

[18:02] the themes I love to life in the way that I thought they would. Same is true with like Guardians of

[18:06] the Galaxy. Like it's okay. But then when you realize the truth that that game was originally

[18:11] supposed to be Iron fucking made in and they just instead of having Eddie's head there, they just

[18:16] made it grute and then they just re-skinned it and it feels like it and they'll never tell you

[18:21] that. They'll never let you know that. But we know that on Canadian Spinball Podcast. But then

[18:25] we know what I'm saying. Stern's hit her miss. But here's the thing. They keep giving you things to

[18:31] react to. They give you options. And if I'm really honest with all of you, they're just fun fucking

[18:38] games. Like they're just fucking fun. I get it. I get it that they're not always worth what they're

[18:44] asking for them. But I rarely walk up to a stern game in modern times and play the game. And I rarely

[18:52] walk away and say, you know what, that wasn't fun. I never say like that was confusing. I didn't

[18:58] know what to do. They know how to make games that give people enjoyment. And I've said it before,

[19:04] they're going to keep making the games better. And when I look at that mansion that haunted house

[19:10] inside Elvira, come on people, come on, give them some fucking credit. That thing looks spectacular.

[19:17] Yes. You know, I someone emailed me. It was Larry, Dr. Fred and he's like, they should have made

[19:21] each window a little LCD screen and had movie clips, you know, pop up on, you know, the windows.

[19:28] And he's like, Stern won't do that. It's cheap. Well, yeah, that would have been cool. I think they'll

[19:32] have lights back there. But but also like why the fuck would there be movie clips playing through a

[19:39] window or maybe it's like characters like you could like, they're in the room. That would be very

[19:42] fucking cool. That would be very fucking expensive. And that would be very annoying. Because imagine

[19:48] this Larry, one of those screens goes out or something's wrong. And then you have to take that whole

[19:53] fucking mechanism apart. And if you're Stern, you're like, yeah, like we could do that and then create

[19:59] a fucking nightmare for all the people when stuff starts to break or take, you know, impact from

[20:04] pinballs and this and that. Or we could just make it fucking reliable. And I say this and I know

[20:09] people like, you know, listen to the show and they say I'm a hypocrite. Look, I've had a Batman 66

[20:15] for fucking two years, people zero fucking problems besides one node board. I popped in and out.

[20:21] I have not had to lift the glass off that game. I play it every day about 20 times a day. It's

[20:28] fucking bullet proof bullet fucking proof. And that is what I want from a fucking toy. Who the

[20:34] fuck wants to buy a toy that rarely works that has issues all the time. I don't care how fucking

[20:40] complex it is. It were how beautiful it is to look out. If you're going up to the game and it

[20:45] doesn't work, you don't want to fucking own it. Okay. Now look, I think we need to give this game

[20:50] a fucking chance. And I think you will. And I think a lot of you are going to start to like

[20:54] do a 180 when you hear Cassandra's callouts and you see what Lyman has in store for this game.

[20:59] This game looks fucking fun to shoot. It's a fan layout. Guess what else is a fan favorite?

[21:04] Canada's fucking pinball park ass people. We're out of here. Have a great Sunday later.

[21:09] If I want to stand, I'll get another stone.
