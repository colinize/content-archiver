[00:00] Welcome to episode 329 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts coming at you from a humongous suite

[00:25] at the Nobu Hotel in Miami, Florida.

[03:24] This is what pinball is supposed to be about.

[03:35] What storyline you are about to embark upon.

[03:44] So that's the first thing we have to talk about.

[04:40] I just want to talk about the sequence of thoughts that went into my head and then we'll

[04:44] talk about the game a little bit more specifically.

[04:47] First and foremost, I couldn't help but feel, isn't stern pinball just incredible?

[04:52] Isn't it incredible?

[04:53] And I don't mean like they make everything incredible.

[04:55] Their games are incredible.

[04:56] I don't mean it like that.

[04:57] What's incredible about stern pinball is they never stop giving us pinball games.

[05:03] It's just, it is absolutely mind-boggling to me that not a single monster's premium

[05:08] machine has even shipped to consumers yet and we've already seen the next game.

[05:14] I mean the cadence and the volume and the frequency and efficiency of this company puts every

[05:21] other pinball company to shame.

[05:23] It is like, I don't even know how you can be a fan of another company without getting

[05:30] frustrated, without having extreme patience, without even the paint drying on the monster's

[05:37] premium playfields.

[05:39] We see this new black night game and that's incredible.

[05:43] Now I also thought to myself, wow, like why did stern bring this game out so quickly,

[05:49] right?

[05:50] I mean they're just shipping people.

[05:52] They're elies of monsters and the premium orders are just in.

[05:56] Is it too soon?

[05:58] Like how much space between launches of games do you need to do?

[06:02] You know what that tells me?

[06:03] It tells me one thing.

[06:05] It tells me stern has a really big year planned.

[06:08] It tells me stern has a lot of games that they're very excited to put on the line and it tells

[06:14] me that we are going to see a lot of stuff from stern pinball this year and this is just,

[06:21] they're on schedule.

[06:22] Like this is the schedule.

[06:23] I think the monsters might have been a little bit delayed in getting out but black night

[06:29] is on schedule and this game is going to hit us pretty quickly.

[06:33] I would assume this game is going to ship.

[06:35] Let's see, it's going to be what April next week.

[06:37] I would say within April, the pros of this game will be going out to people as well as

[06:43] the elies.

[06:44] We know the way they do it, right?

[06:46] They don't reveal a game until it's even on the line.

[06:50] Parts are ordered.

[06:51] It's going to get to customers.

[06:52] Now, I also thought, this is what popped into my head.

[06:56] We're going to see it a lot and I mean a lot of people trying to sell their game of

[07:01] thrones.

[07:03] It's going to be a fire sale on Game of Thrones owners.

[07:06] All those guys who want a great Steve Richie pin and this and that, I think we're going

[07:10] to see Game of Thrones pins go up for sale.

[07:12] I think we're going to see Star Wars pins go up for sale and I get those are two themes

[07:17] that a lot of people like but man, this to me feels like what Steve Richie always wants

[07:23] to do.

[07:24] It's stuff like this.

[07:25] I felt like when I saw Game of Thrones and Star Wars for the first time, I was not

[07:30] blown away.

[07:31] I was not excited.

[07:32] I didn't even feel like there was a tremendous amount of passion that went into those two titles.

[07:38] But when I see this game, the feeling that comes to mind is that this is the result of

[07:44] what happens when you allow a designer to make something that he's completely passionate

[07:50] about.

[07:51] He doesn't have to ask any permission from a licensed holder if he can do this or if

[07:56] he can do that.

[07:57] And Tim Sexton told the story of the origins of this game and how Steve had this crazy

[08:04] idea for a mechanism of a black knight that would be this imposing figure in the middle

[08:09] of the game and you would be physically battling him.

[08:12] And we're going to talk about that, Mac, and how freaking cool it is.

[08:16] But I think it's really important to stop and appreciate just how much better pinball

[08:22] is when these designers are unshackled from these themes.

[08:27] Now, that doesn't mean you can't take a theme and make an amazing game because the majority

[08:31] of great pinball machines are based on themes.

[08:35] But we know that when Stern goes to grab a theme, the bomb, right, how much money they'll

[08:42] invest in that game, that the license for that theme is incorporated into that.

[08:48] So when I look at this game as an original game where Steve Richie, the king is allowed

[08:52] to do what he wants, I can't help but also think that this is the best.

[08:57] This is the best kind of innovation we're going to get from Stern for a while because

[09:02] they were able to spend the money that they normally would have to spend on the theme

[09:08] and imply that.

[09:09] Apply that to the mechanism that is the black knight and the upper play field and the other

[09:13] stuff like the Magnus save.

[09:15] There's a lot in this game that I don't think we would have had if this was based on a

[09:21] license property.

[09:24] So Kudos to Stern for allowing Steve Richie, the king, to have his original game brought

[09:30] to fruition.

[09:31] Now, does this redeem Star Wars and Game of Thrones?

[09:35] I don't know.

[09:36] It's way too early to tell on that front.

[09:38] But again, looking at both of those games for the first time next to this game, I am

[09:43] much more excited to play Black Knight sort of rage than I was to play Star Wars or Game

[09:50] of Thrones.

[09:51] Here's what I think this game is going to end up being.

[09:54] And I haven't flipped it.

[09:55] I haven't played it.

[09:56] But I can tell by what I've seen and what I'm hearing, I can tell this game is going

[10:01] to do one thing.

[10:03] It is going to bring some really high fucking energy to a pinball experience.

[10:10] You could tell, right?

[10:11] This game's going to be all about the energy, like that music from the anthrax guitarist,

[10:16] the Black Knight taunting you.

[10:19] It's going to be freaking like a heavy metal sort of like energetic joy ride to flip this

[10:25] machine.

[10:26] I'm totally confident in that.

[10:28] And you could tell.

[10:29] You could tell.

[10:30] And what I love is the story.

[10:32] I always harp on this.

[10:33] A pinball machine, like a video game, like a movie.

[10:37] It needs to have a story in which you are excited to embark upon that journey.

[10:44] And this is why I just don't, you know, I can't fall in love with Pirate of the Caribbean

[10:48] because it's like, what's the story of all these five movies?

[10:50] It's the story of that game is like how to get to all the multi balls and stack them.

[10:54] And this, and that.

[10:55] There's no story in it.

[10:56] There's no real narrative in it.

[10:58] But this game, when I was listening to Tim Sexton explain what's in this game and the

[11:04] story of it.

[11:05] The more he talked and the more I heard from Richie and the more I realized what this

[11:09] game is all about, the more I was like, that's fucking awesome.

[11:14] It is awesome.

[11:15] Like, it's very simple.

[11:17] You are trying to defeat the black knight.

[11:21] Like you could just stop there.

[11:22] I mean, like that's the, that's the point of this game.

[11:24] You want to get to the point where you attack the black castle and you kill the black knight.

[11:31] And the black knight is trying to stop you from conquering him, right?

[11:34] He's got his skeleton army.

[11:36] He's got other, you know, mini bosses that are guarding like his kingdom and you have to

[11:40] battle your way through the kingdom to get to the, you know, the black castle or the

[11:44] dark castle and defeat his skeleton army and then battle the black knight.

[11:50] And you could just like, you could just like, that's it.

[11:52] That's it.

[11:53] You don't need a fucking comic book.

[11:54] You don't need a rule set with a million different like arrows going everywhere.

[11:58] I know what I'm trying to do in the game.

[12:01] And it's going to be fun.

[12:02] How could that not be fun?

[12:04] And you stand over the game and it's clearly obvious like what you're trying to do.

[12:07] You're trying to battle this huge mechanism that's in the middle.

[12:11] And let's talk about that mechanism for a minute because I, when I first saw the images,

[12:15] I didn't really know what was going on.

[12:16] I was like, is that like a captive ball or what is that thing in the middle?

[12:20] And it, it's so cool.

[12:22] So I'm, I'm zooming in now this guy, this black knight.

[12:25] He's got a, he's holding a, a flail.

[12:29] Is it, is it a flail?

[12:30] Right?

[12:31] It's instead of a sword.

[12:32] Let me just clarify for a minute.

[12:33] A sword in the game, like sort of rage.

[12:36] Like, I think you have the sword as well.

[12:39] So I think the black knight might have a sword, but I don't care that he's, that he's

[12:42] not holding a sword in his hand.

[12:45] He's holding his flail.

[12:47] That's fine with me.

[12:48] But it's cool.

[12:49] Like in his right hand, he's got this flail and it, it spins, right?

[12:52] It spins like over and over and over.

[12:54] And it either shoots the ball up the ramp or it deflects it back down to the player, which

[13:00] is awesome.

[13:01] Like that's so fucking cool.

[13:02] And then in his left hand is a shield that goes up and down.

[13:06] And I think there's a ball lock behind the shield.

[13:08] And you either like hit the shield and it deflects back at you or you make it through.

[13:13] And I mean, it's just cool.

[13:14] Like it's just cool to see this character have like a different sort of weapon in each

[13:19] hand that, that you're combating against.

[13:23] So it's like almost like a bash toy on two sides.

[13:26] So I really do, I really do love when we see these kinds of toys and gimmicks and games.

[13:32] To me, that's what pinballs all about, right?

[13:35] And so you, I can even just look at this night too and his eyes light up and his eyes and

[13:39] the LED where his mouth is, those are going to like change color and interact with the

[13:45] game when he talks.

[13:47] So it's going to be like he's taunting you.

[13:49] He's challenging you.

[13:50] You know, he's, he's like alive on the play field.

[13:54] And that's, that's fucking awesome, right?

[13:56] That is so awesome.

[13:57] And much rather have that than a guy with two electric bolts that he's holding on to just

[14:02] move back and forth like a target from a carnival game.

[14:05] But anyway, I digress.

[14:07] So I think it's really, really cool.

[14:09] You're also going to have like the upper play field on the early in the premium.

[14:14] That's going to be able to lock balls up there.

[14:16] You're going to be able to get a six ball, multi ball going with the early in the premium

[14:20] games on the right side by the right outling.

[14:24] What is really cool is you got the Magna save, right?

[14:26] What's this Magna save is in the same exact area where John Papadude put it for Magic

[14:32] Girl that didn't really work well.

[14:35] But we know that this was in the Black Knight series before.

[14:39] So it's a return of Magna save.

[14:41] Now it's awesome about this.

[14:43] This is kind of funny.

[14:44] So it is, you use the Magna save by hitting the button on the lock down bar.

[14:49] Now I couldn't help but laugh at this.

[14:51] And we always say this, why can't Stern make it?

[14:54] So the apron of the game is centered with the center of the lock down bar because here's

[15:01] here's so funny.

[15:02] If you look at this of the game, if you look at the sort of like the instructions on the

[15:08] apron that are pointing to the lock down bar button, how funny is it that the arrow in

[15:14] between the Magna save?

[15:15] Like it says use button to activate.

[15:17] The arrow has to be tilted to the right to indicate where the button is.

[15:22] It just looks so silly like the whole game is like off centered, but that's all right.

[15:26] We forgive them for that.

[15:27] But that is a really cool feature.

[15:29] So I'm really excited that's in there.

[15:31] Will it be hard to use that Magna save, taking your hand off the right flipper button and

[15:36] then having to press it?

[15:38] That's a pretty long distance to go.

[15:41] I think some people were saying they would rather see that button as a third button below

[15:46] the right flipper button.

[15:47] But that, you know, whatever.

[15:48] I think it's going to be fine.

[15:51] What else is going on in this game?

[15:52] There's a lot going on.

[15:53] Like you've seen it, you know, the pictures.

[15:56] Let's talk about the artwork because that is another thing we can sort of critique without

[16:01] flipping the game itself.

[16:02] Now I have to say this is done by, is Kevin O'Connor?

[16:06] I'm just pulling up my notes.

[16:07] I want to make sure I get this stuff right because you know this podcast.

[16:09] We get so much stuff wrong.

[16:11] Let's see.

[16:12] Kevin O'Connor is the artist.

[16:13] He also is the artist from Kiss.

[16:15] And I have to say like the cabinet art packages on the pro premium and Ellie, I think they

[16:20] all look phenomenal.

[16:22] I really do.

[16:23] I don't know if I like the premium or the Ellie art more.

[16:26] I can't tell.

[16:27] But I also will say this.

[16:29] I always like it when a game has the title of the machine on the side of the game.

[16:34] I love the way the black knight sort of rage looks on the pro.

[16:40] I wish they would have put that big logo across both the premium and the Ellie.

[16:45] I don't like games that don't have the title on the side of the cabinet.

[16:48] I just don't.

[16:49] I prefer to have that cool title there.

[16:52] Okay.

[16:53] So I'm not going to go over the whole features matrix.

[16:55] I think the Ellie gets a shaker.

[16:57] But we're going to talk about the artwork.

[16:59] Like what do I think of the artwork?

[17:01] We've gotten down by the flippers.

[17:03] This big pile of gold.

[17:04] Now what I think was funny.

[17:06] I was listening to Tim and he was talking about you're trying to steal the gold and the

[17:11] money from the black knight.

[17:12] And that's the money he's accrued.

[17:15] And he stole from all the different kids that played black knight 2000 in the first black

[17:19] knight game.

[17:20] So like all the quarters that people pumped into those pinball machines over the years.

[17:24] This is the money that you're trying to steal from the black knight.

[17:27] I thought that was really a fun and clever way to think about his money and his bounty

[17:32] in the game.

[17:34] And don't forget the first game came out 30 years ago, 1989.

[17:38] Incredible.

[17:40] The artwork I'll say this.

[17:42] We've seen a lot of artwork from zombie Eddie and Christopher Franci.

[17:46] So I think it's refreshing to have new artwork in the game.

[17:49] It's not as detailed as a lot of the other games we've seen recently.

[17:55] It's just not.

[17:56] I mean, you've got the gold and the knight.

[17:58] Then you've got that big sort of like circus wheel that has all these different.

[18:01] I don't know if there are like many modes with these sort of lightning bolt inserts.

[18:05] And you've got, you know, to me like, I don't know.

[18:08] It looks like a big, like I don't know, lightning bolt pizza pie in the middle.

[18:13] I don't know how to describe it.

[18:15] That's such a big piece of real estate.

[18:18] It probably looks really cool because it's, you know, it's got all those like lightning

[18:22] bolt inserts and whatnot.

[18:24] I don't know.

[18:25] I kind of wish there was a little bit more artwork in that area of the game.

[18:29] And then you've got the black knight with holding the sword above that.

[18:33] And there's not much else.

[18:34] I mean, there's a lot of just red in the background.

[18:38] And it looks like there's flames and skulls.

[18:40] But there isn't the level of detail in the background of this game.

[18:44] I know where near as much detail in the artwork as there is in a game like Deadpool, in a game

[18:50] like Iron Maiden, in a game, you know, even like Batman's got a little bit more going

[18:54] on.

[18:55] And I think monsters has so much more going on.

[18:57] I think that the, the, the, the, Franchie and, and Yeti, they like to fill in a lot of

[19:02] that background space with more color.

[19:04] But I think this game is relying a lot more on just, you know, red and yellow and then

[19:10] the inserts.

[19:11] And it's, and the inserts are very, I don't, I don't know.

[19:14] It's not the most creative inserts.

[19:17] You've got the, you know, every shot, it's pretty clear.

[19:20] Has like three inserts attached to it.

[19:23] Maybe four.

[19:24] You know, you've got the green, the yellow and then the blue.

[19:27] You can maybe the yellow and the red and then, you know, and then the lightning bolt at

[19:32] the top.

[19:33] So, you know, pretty basic.

[19:35] I don't, I wouldn't say that this is like this play field artwork is blowing me away.

[19:40] But it's nice.

[19:41] It's nice hand drawn art.

[19:42] I think the action is going to be fast and furious in this game.

[19:46] And now we wait.

[19:48] And now we wait until the game is played.

[19:50] Now there are drop targets in the game as well.

[19:53] So that is good that there is not just like a lazy stand up target.

[19:57] And this is it.

[19:59] This is it.

[20:00] We have a new Stern game out today.

[20:02] And do I think this game will be successful?

[20:04] That's the question I want to ask you guys out there.

[20:07] Oh, it's interesting because I was surprised to see that Stern is releasing six hundred

[20:13] LEDs of this game.

[20:15] I was also hearing a lot of people say that if you're going to make a black night game,

[20:19] there has to be an upper play field.

[20:21] Like that is the original games claim the fame that it had an upper play field.

[20:26] And some people are looking at this as sacrilege that they're that the pro version does not have

[20:31] an upper play field.

[20:32] But as I heard from Tim, the pro play is really fast.

[20:35] And we saw this with Game of Thrones.

[20:37] We know Steve Richie does this.

[20:39] Oftentimes the pro versions of his games are the ones with the most speed and the most

[20:45] flow.

[20:46] So I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of like the tournament players and the pinball players

[20:51] who love speed and flow if they actually determine the pro version of this game to be better.

[20:57] Whereas the upper play field will obviously slow the action down a bit.

[21:02] You're obviously a lot safer from draining when you're up in the upper play field.

[21:06] But there's more multi ball opportunities there.

[21:09] So we'll see.

[21:11] We'll see which one people prefer.

[21:12] But I definitely would lean towards the premium and the Ellie on this game.

[21:17] So how will it sell?

[21:18] Do I think they're going to sell all 600 Ellie's?

[21:21] I don't know.

[21:22] I really don't know.

[21:23] Is it going to be sold out?

[21:24] I don't know.

[21:25] I don't think it's the kind of game that's going to sell out like tomorrow.

[21:29] And it was revealed today.

[21:30] And we've seen Stern sell out a ton of games within a week.

[21:33] Will this sell out in a week?

[21:35] I can't say it will either.

[21:37] And here's why though.

[21:38] I don't think it's only the fact because it's an original game and it's not like a theme

[21:42] that people have to have.

[21:43] Because I think a lot of pinball nerds out there who love the Black Knight series.

[21:48] Those guys are really into this.

[21:50] But this does not have the same kind of following as like a Star Wars or a Game of Thrones or

[21:56] a Guardians or a Monsters.

[21:58] They're just not that same level.

[22:01] So I don't think it's going to sell out because of that.

[22:04] But the main reason I also don't think it's going to sell out so quickly is I think people,

[22:09] just winning on the monsters.

[22:11] And a lot of guys who love Stern games and buy all new inbox games, they just bought one

[22:16] of your games.

[22:17] They're not going to buy two games immediately.

[22:20] So I think there's going to be a little bit of a pause there.

[22:22] I think there's going to be a little bit of a pause because people are waiting to see

[22:26] what Willie Wonka is all about.

[22:28] If you're going to go drop $9,000, you need to do it today.

[22:33] You might as well wait a few weeks and see what Jersey Jack has up his sleeve because

[22:37] we know that's coming.

[22:39] You also might have heard positive reviews about October Fest at T.P.F. and maybe you want

[22:44] to see if that game is where your money should go.

[22:47] I couldn't help but think that this game coming out at this moment, at this time, is nothing

[22:54] but bad news for October Fest.

[22:57] It's bad news.

[23:01] They had a window in which they could bring out their game without as much competition.

[23:07] But this is what Stern does.

[23:08] They just clobber you with consistency.

[23:12] It's not like each game has to be the greatest game ever, but they just clobber the competition

[23:18] by constantly having new games come out every two to three months.

[23:21] There's just no stopping them.

[23:24] We know that a lot of people just want the latest and the greatest.

[23:28] It's going to be hard, I think, for a Joe Ballsor designed October Fest to shoot as well

[23:36] as a Steve Richie designed Black Knight.

[23:41] Two different types of games.

[23:43] What I do like about October Fest, it's a completely original layout.

[23:47] It doesn't feel like a typical Stern layout.

[23:49] It doesn't feel like a fan layout.

[23:53] Here's the thing though.

[23:54] Joe Ballsor is interesting to me because he doesn't have his style.

[23:58] I think Joe's always trying to mix it up and you get a lot of different approaches to

[24:02] Pimball with Joe Ballsor, where Richie's a little bit different.

[24:05] You know you're going to get speed.

[24:06] You know you're going to get flow.

[24:08] You know you're going to get that.

[24:09] You know you're going to have his kind of like the way the insert is darn his game.

[24:13] Look at his games.

[24:14] He's always got a lot of inserts going up the ladder in each and it's very clear where the

[24:18] shots are.

[24:19] It's like this beam of light going up towards each shot with a series of inserts.

[24:24] That's how Steve Richie does it.

[24:26] That's how he likes to make Pimball.

[24:28] They call him the king for a reason I guess.

[24:30] Who might have disagreed with that approach?

[24:34] It's kind of crazy to me.

[24:36] It's like monsters.

[24:37] Now this October Fest and Alice Cooper are shipping now and it's all these games are

[24:42] dropping on top of each other.

[24:44] That's the other thought I had today.

[24:46] It's like, wow.

[24:48] Imagine if all this was happening and then you factor in deep root and maybe you factor

[24:53] in like alien figuring their shit out or big Lebowski figuring their shit out and then

[24:57] you factor in a sun coast Pimball and then you factor in you know C.G.

[25:02] C.C.'s next game and like it's like, what what like how are we going to do all this?

[25:06] Like what happens if cactus Canyon gets revealed in two months?

[25:09] What happens if you know Kingpin gets remade in like three months and all these games

[25:14] are going to keep coming out and the problem is this this this industry it's all going

[25:18] to I think a lot of it's going to collapse under its own weight because how do you

[25:23] have all these companies about to release all these games and most of these other games

[25:27] coming out are going to be between $7,500 and like $12,000 if you're Jersey Jack and

[25:34] I don't know how these companies are going to like I don't know how they're all going

[25:39] to survive.

[25:40] I really don't I don't think there are enough people out there who can absorb all these

[25:45] new inbox games at one time and again but this is where Stern Club is you because they

[25:50] beat everybody to the punch.

[25:53] They just beat them to the punch.

[25:55] I mean there's no way of denying that every single black night they sell and every single

[26:01] monsters they sell that someone who potentially might have bought a willy-wanka or who might

[26:08] have bought a pirate to the Caribbean.

[26:11] But I have to give Stern a ton of credit.

[26:13] I have to give Steve Richie and Tim Credit and you know who I have to give the most credit

[26:19] to is George Gomez for making this company so damn efficient like there's just no way

[26:24] around it.

[26:25] When I was listening to Tim talk to Nate he was explaining how what George does is he

[26:31] gives his team members all the resources they need to get the game to the finish line

[26:38] when it needs to be finished so we can get out into the world and so like he like he

[26:43] boosts up the team.

[26:45] So Tim has a whole like you know more expanded team right now to get the game ready to get

[26:50] into your home and make the game you know far enough along where it will be really enjoyable

[26:56] when you open the box and then from there he moves those extra resources to get the next

[27:01] game to fruition and then Tim is left to focus on polishing and finishing the game and

[27:07] getting it to 1.0 code.

[27:09] See that's how Stern just beat you.

[27:12] They're like an army of people over there and they're allowed to they're capable of

[27:17] applying resources to get shit done and that's where I think the other companies fall down.

[27:22] They don't have expanded resources they don't have expanded teams it's just those people

[27:27] doing it time and time again and they can only make one at a time where Stern is like focused

[27:34] on 3 4 5 at a time and if something slips here or there's a delay here or there's a

[27:40] complication with the license over there they can pivot and they can move their resources

[27:45] around and apply them to the game that you know is next and if that game can't be next

[27:52] they could probably slot something in front of it and then then they could always like

[27:56] vault edition or put another game on the line to buy them a little bit of time but they're

[28:01] always making money and the line is always moving.

[28:05] You know I know that Stern is about to do another run of a game that's been really popular

[28:09] recently I can't tell you what it is but it's going to be really exciting and I think

[28:14] you're going to I think a lot of people who might have been on the fence about jumping

[28:17] in on one they might see this and say yeah like that's really cool that's the one I want

[28:21] and no it's not tron and no it's not Lord of the Rings alright I can say that okay

[28:28] so I think it's it's going to be a really awesome spring summer in pinball there's so

[28:33] much going on now this game to close the loop on it I think this game is going to

[28:39] do I think it's going to be a game where people who love shooting pinball machines are

[28:44] going to love it I think people who love narrative driven pinball machines are going to

[28:48] have a lot of fun with it I think we're going to see rare hero mr. Greg Colton I think

[28:53] he's going to it's going to be the kind of game that he's going to tell us he's going

[28:56] to buy and then he might actually buy it I just I give Greg shit I'm like Greg every time

[29:01] a game like this happens you're like oh I might have to go in this time I'm like eventually

[29:04] you're going to have to go buy the game that you say you're going to go in on but this

[29:08] might be that one I don't know we'll see but I think this game is really amazing from

[29:13] what I've seen so far I have to give Stern credit let's give pinside 24 to 48 hours

[29:19] and watch what's going to happen you know they love a game on day one day two they'll

[29:24] find more stuff the bitch about probably by game four or sorry game four by day four they're

[29:29] going to be ready to say it's the worst game ever no but I that that's how pinside is

[29:33] because they they're so like incapable of just being happy about a new game release I just

[29:39] think you know we don't know a lot about this game we haven't flipped it we haven't seen

[29:42] the code we haven't seen the animations yet we haven't seen so much but I think you go

[29:47] to bed tonight happy with what you've seen so I do think I would be happy if I was the

[29:53] team who had worked on this and this is what they're they're putting out there now look I

[29:58] can already hear people being like it's just another Stern it's just another Stern and yes

[30:01] on many levels it is just another Stern and Stern is Stern is Stern and you're not going

[30:07] to get a game from Stern that looks like a Jersey Jack game and you're not going to get a

[30:10] game from Stern that looks like American Pimball and you're not going to get a game from Stern

[30:13] that looks like Chicago gaming company and while you can criticize Stern for being cheaper

[30:18] on this and that I just don't know how you can really stay mad at Stern for very long

[30:25] because they just keep giving you games I'd rather a company that keeps giving me options

[30:32] versus a company that is recycling old ideas like yellow brick road was like I'm you know

[30:38] I'm saying like Jersey Jack is looking back where Stern is always looking forward and I

[30:43] think that's commendable and I think that's we should appreciate that because isn't it

[30:48] more exciting to always have future titles coming out versus looking back at the old titles

[30:53] and charging $11,500 for a game that's been out for seven years all right all right well

[30:59] that's my little take on this game so far a lot of exciting stuff the music sounds incredible

[31:07] again I think it shows if you unleash these guys and you let them make something they're

[31:11] passionate about you're just going to get more from them and I think this is something

[31:15] that Steve has wanted to make and I think they got more from him and I do think this will

[31:20] redeem what I believe to be like mediocre titles in Star Wars and Game of Thrones all right so

[31:28] what else do I want to do in this episode of Canadian Pimble podcast I got so many so many emails

[31:35] after the Twippy award so I want to say thank you to all the people who emailed me about that I

[31:40] might read us read some of them on the air now because it's always fun to give you guys some

[31:44] air time first I wanted to say thank you to someone's podcast that I listened to who went

[31:50] over the Twippy Awards and they had some nice stuff to say about me and I just want to say

[31:56] Marty thank you on head to head pinball I heard what you said I sent you a note as well I do want

[32:01] to say thank you and I appreciate the kind words you said about what went down at the show I don't

[32:07] think our category should have been dragged down the way it was I think we all will move on from

[32:13] it and I told Marty I would just love to be a guest on his show and I would love to have Marty be a

[32:17] guest on this show and I think we should you know bury whatever hatchets there are and all of us

[32:22] pinball podcasters should get along because what I wanted to say too is like what you guys don't

[32:27] understand is we're all those podcasters we're all we're all struggling through the same sort of

[32:32] journey of how do we find the time how do we find the content it's a lot of work it's a lot more

[32:38] work than you guys realize it's it's a lot more of our mental time than then we should be applying

[32:43] to pinball that we have to apply to pinball to get you guys these weekly shows so on a certain level

[32:49] I sort of connect and bond with every single dude out there and woman out there who's doing a pinball

[32:53] podcast so we're all sort of in the same group and part of the same family so it would be nice for

[32:58] more of us to do each other's shows and that that's me sort of reaching out there to all you out

[33:03] there who do pinball podcasts I would love to have you on the show and I would love to come on your

[33:08] shows as well and and we can cross promote what we're doing on a weekly basis okay I think that

[33:14] would be awesome all right so I got an email from Peter Gertzin he said Chris he said congrats

[33:21] once again on the twippy I love the music samples you use for the shows some some times hitting

[33:27] back to the 80s great stuff can you make a Spotify playlist and share that um Peter here's what I

[33:32] might do there I have a few awesome like playlist that I put together but I also have this awesome

[33:38] mashup that's just incredible that is not on Spotify in fact most of those mashups you've been hearing

[33:43] they're not available on Spotify what I might do is once a month I might just upload onto my sound

[33:50] cloud channel for you guys an entire musical like play just a musical track for you guys to download

[33:57] because these mashups are all together it's like one hour long mashup of amazing music so I

[34:02] might do that for you guys so you can you can enjoy it because I think sharing music is just as

[34:07] much fun as playing pinball all right I got an email let's see dude dude dude dude from Michael

[34:14] shallus Michael says congratulations on twippy too canada before you get slammed with emails about

[34:20] black night congratulations on picking up your second twippy you certainly earned it and it is too

[34:26] bad that you are not given the respect that you deserve to offer your thanks to those who voted for

[34:31] you and those important to your life as a pin cider posted even the people who did not vote for you

[35:15] I really enjoy your podcast been a day one listener congrats on the twippy I've been to mgc seven

[35:22] years in a row and I think you would really enjoy the show mgc has all the great parts of a pinball

[35:29] show stern home show debuts hundreds of games home brew etc but it also has an amazing energy

[35:37] of an nostalgic gaming convention with just as much or more dedicated to that area you should

[35:43] consider going some year I think you'd really dig it all right that is from owg well you know

[35:50] what I really do want to get to Chicago and get to mgc isn't is it in jacago didn't know where it is

[35:55] um but I would love to go to mgc and if the rumors are true because kingpin games keep saying this

[36:01] if the rumors are true there might be a chance that willy wonka will be there uh black night we know

[36:08] will be there for sure now but it would be interesting if willy wonka was there as well but

[36:13] jack is in france so is jack and release willy wonka without him there I can't I can't see that

[36:19] happening unless the france trip isn't for real all right let's see I got an email from let's see

[36:27] pirates the care being comment uh do do do I can't read more pirate stuff I'm still I'm still

[36:33] like trying to get over the fact that pirates won for best theme integration I mean what how is that

[36:38] even possible pirates winning for best theme integration with absolutely no assets it's still

[36:45] to this day uh I don't understand all right they got an email from edc it said twippies

[36:50] fuck yeah congratulations chris I was getting worried when deadpool won best theme but that was a

[36:57] distant memory when your name was announced you deserve it keep up the great work well edc thank

[37:02] you so much I appreciate you listening to the show uh I got an email from west congrats to a wonderful

[37:08] year of podcasting just sharing some thoughts on your grand win of the weekend and the fallout of

[37:20] let me download his auto recording and played for you now and then we'll close out the show and I'll

[37:24] thank more of you guys on the next podcast how does that sound all right hey there canada I wanted

[37:31] to leave you a brief message this is a west west man from pinside left a message for you prior

[37:38] little bit sloppy little bit drunk slightly more sober now wanted to say first thing congratulations

[37:43] for your win last night it'll be last last night by the time you got this message you handled

[37:49] things with a plum in class uh you deserved it you look good you look sharp you came off well

[37:55] congratulations second I want to say I think that people are in an uproar understandably so but

[38:04] for the wrong reason at jersey jack pinball I think jack probably had about a week or so notice

[38:12] probably understood that he couldn't do the reveal he wanted to do so he was left with time on

[38:17] his hands and unfortunately wasn't so transparent as he could have been but it's business and who

[38:23] wants to look bad in business who wants to kind of admit that there are issues and who wants to kind

[38:29] of have that be at the forefront and especially when they're unveiling a product which this product

[38:34] probably would have been about a five minute snippet long cup probably would have been the rest of it

[38:40] I don't think it's on jack's hands I don't think it's on his head I don't think he I don't think

[38:44] he had the ability to kind of control this and he didn't want to express that look weak you got

[38:49] to look at jack as somebody who is in the business firsthand has decades of experience is at the

[38:55] head of the company the head and the spokesman or someone like Gary is a loupe he's removed

[39:00] Charlie has kind of he's a little bit clueless American pinball has not much of an identity right now

[39:08] so jack at least is out there jack is going to take the shots jack is going to be the vocal point

[39:13] and I appreciate and respect him for that he's honest he's he's a tradesman and I don't think

[39:20] anybody else at any of these other companies represents their pinball company in the same way jack

[39:25] does and I'm glad for it more than the misfires like we saw the other night that said hopefully

[39:32] there'll be more for more transparent you spoke with them maybe you'll take some of your considerations

[39:37] into the future but the company is jack and and for me that is better than worse and I'm happy he

[39:44] exists the other guys I like their products but jack to me I like more than anybody else and I

[39:51] forgive him I understand his predicaments and yet we don't understand his predicaments and

[39:57] that's okay it's business we're not in the boardroom we're not in meetings that's fine so jack

[40:03] it's a pass from me understandably we're upset you're upset everybody's upset but you know what

[40:09] who's probably more upset than anybody jack so let's cut him a break congratulations again canada

[40:16] we all love you I think jack still loves you and and most of all you know that one guy who

[40:23] who geared you you know that he loves you you know that he's secretly your biggest fan and

[40:27] patreon fans so don't worry about it man year number three there will be a cacophony of

[40:33] cheers and that will be the only sound congratulations man you deserved it bye bye

[40:39] all right west thank you so much for that note wow a lot in there so just just to sort of

[40:43] address some of that I do think that people like jack I mean jack is a very very likable figure

[40:49] he's a likable man he's very kind he's very nice he's very endearing he's a great salesman

[40:56] and I think jack has hit a lot of hurdles obviously with his company over the years and I think

[41:01] people have always pulled for jack to be successful I I never really see anyone rooting for

[41:07] jersey jack pinball to fail because it's quite evident that they are trying to make the best

[41:15] pinball machines available nobody will ever say that any of jersey jack's efforts have ever been

[41:23] about cost-cutting have ever been about yanking stuff out until the the flying monkey but you know

[41:29] I'm saying he's tried he's tried really hard to bring pinball back to the magic of the bali

[41:35] Williams error now the thing is this jack as a business man is is another picture and I think

[41:42] that's the problem with jack's company is when I when I talk to him and when you when you sort of

[41:48] sort of pick his brain it's it's almost like they need a George Gomez over there they need

[41:55] it more investors over there they need a Gary Stern over there because what they do need is more

[42:00] of a plan and they don't really have much of a plan it's sort of like they're just making each game

[42:07] in a silo and just hoping it works out and and they're not really set up to sort of figure out a

[42:15] way out if something doesn't take off the way they expected to right because that's I mean we're

[42:21] we're living that nightmare for him right now with with pirates of the Caribbean they don't have a

[42:27] plan they did not have a plan it's weird it's like they didn't have a plan uh in case they didn't

[42:34] plan for the scenario in which this game would have a slower appreciation but then pick up momentum

[42:42] and then become successful like this game had to be successful on day one or they were going to

[42:48] pull the plug on it which is what they're doing and now that people are starting to recognize the

[42:53] game and really want it and appreciate it they did not have a plan in place in which they could

[42:59] continue production and it's like I said on my last podcast uh they can't order the parts now

[43:06] and get them in time to keep making the game and they've got to order parts for the next game which

[43:11] is Willy Wonka I don't I also don't think that Jack only had like a week's notice about TPS they

[43:17] had they had to have known that TPS was never going to be the moment in which Willy Wonka was going

[43:22] to be revealed uh you know these games you work back from a release date you know so first so let

[43:29] me let me let me explain that Stern knows like when a game is going to go on the line there's no

[43:33] mystery there's no mystery to them they don't get caught off guard uh they're not surprised by the

[43:40] you know production schedules probably I'm I'm assuming they're they're they're release schedule

[43:45] pretty much goes according to plan if stuff does slip we're talking a month or two we're not

[43:51] talking a year or two which is what we've seen with other companies I mean remember

[43:54] Pirates the Caribbean was almost like a year delayed like Alice Cooper nightmare castle a year

[43:59] delayed um I would not call Charlie Clueless I heard you say that West I don't think Charlie's

[44:05] Clueless I don't think you can call a man who has uh you know made profit and delivered every single

[44:13] Pimbal machine he's promised Clueless I think Charlie has worked to do in certain areas of his

[44:19] development of his games and and making his games better but Charlie has survived and made money

[44:25] and created a company that's been successful on his terms within Pimbal uh Jersey Jeff

[44:31] on the other hand is a company that pretty much went bankrupt three times and needed a significant

[44:37] cash bailout to stay in business so I think Charlie knows what he's doing and he bites off as much as

[44:42] he can chew uh I also would not call like Gary Stern aloof and just off to the side I think there's

[44:48] a misconception that Gary Stern isn't in it right that he is like I think that Stern is successful

[44:56] not because absurd like just serendipity I think Stern is very successful because those guys are

[45:02] in it and they know it like Gary knows this industry like the back of his hand Joe Kamikaw knows

[45:09] it like the back of his hand George Gomez knows it like the back of his hand these people are not um

[45:15] you know that's the thing too is like you don't see them as much you don't hear from them as much

[45:21] and I tend to believe when it's the person you're not hearing from all the time that's because

[45:26] they're they're off doing it they're getting shit done George Gomez Gary Stern Kamikaw they're

[45:34] fucking taking care of business Charlie Emory he's taking care of business it's when you hear

[45:39] from Jack all the time and it's always like you know the salesman's pitch it's because he's deflecting

[45:45] he's buying himself time like yellow brick road edition is nothing more than that company buying

[45:52] itself some time and it's a product that nobody really wants if if he hasn't made all 1,000

[45:59] ruby red editions why didn't he just make more ruby red editions if distributors are getting

[46:06] inquiries about more wise machines it's weird to me it's weird to me and that company somehow sat

[46:13] in a boardroom together and they made the decision that that yellow brick road edition was worth

[46:20] 11,500 and they yanked stuff out of the game and they maybe they thought that a wood apron and a

[46:27] little topper would justify it and they still can't figure out the limited edition approach

[46:33] to their company and look I hope Jack is very successful in 2019 but they're either going to

[46:39] grow up this year or I think they're going to keep stumbling and I don't and I mean that I don't

[46:44] I don't care if it's wonka guns and roses I don't care if jack has hairy potter this company's

[46:49] the stumbles they encounter they go deeper than theme they go deeper than mechanisms and gimmicks

[46:55] and art packages there is something under the surface a jersey jack pinball that just makes it

[47:01] really hard for them to do what Stern does there's just something under the surface that always

[47:08] seems to plague them no matter what game it is they just can't seem to figure it out and I hope

[47:16] to god as god is my witness I hope they figure it out this year and don't fumble the incredible

[47:24] themes they have ready to go and pinball and I'm just gonna end on this note again I just picked up

[47:29] on this vibe from them at tpf I just didn't get the sense that they were they had something up

[47:36] their sleeve you know when you see like from deeproot and robert mule there you know how you get

[47:39] this like sort of confidence from like Steve bowed in and the people over at deeproot I haven't

[47:44] seen what they're working on but you know how you sort of get this air of like wait you see what

[47:49] we got right way do you see like we're about to like drop it like it's hot like it's going to be like

[47:55] a mic drop moment for this company I just didn't get that sense from the jjp crew and everyone over

[48:01] there must have seen what will you want to is man I'm just gonna I don't think this can't be but

[48:09] man do you think will you want to possibly be like a re-skin of dialed in is that why do you think

[48:14] they would do that I don't I don't know I don't think so I can't imagine that being the case

[48:19] Jack has never done that but but yellow brick road addition does sort of hint at it was a little

[48:26] bit of a desperate move and does is this indication that there will be another desperate move

[48:33] and not what we think which is just all original pinball magic coming from them so that's all just

[48:38] speculation I doubt pat lawler would ever have his first two jersey jack games be identical game so

[48:46] I like I think there's like a 99.9% chance that we're not going to see a re-skin of dialed in

[48:51] I would be so shocked I think you guys would burn the company to the ground if that happened

[48:55] all right everyone exciting day I'm on my vacation and Brenda is allowing me to do this podcast

[49:01] I'm gonna stop it now we are gonna go have an incredible omokase dinner at the nobu restaurant here

[49:08] tonight highly recommended by a mr ed robertson who I did not mention is also doing callouts

[49:14] in the black night game sort of rage so cool man Steve Richie's doing callouts

[49:20] ed robertson's doing callouts do you think the lever like call me up and be like hey canada

[49:25] can you do a call out that's like it's a world under glass I would love to do a callout

[49:30] within a stern game I hope in 2019 stern pinball and canada's pinball podcast I hope we can reconcile

[49:38] whatever differences there are and we can get some of their people on the show because I think

[49:42] it would be great I mean I love the Nate interview but I think we do interviews a little bit

[49:46] different and I think people enjoy them and and and and I would love to talk to some of the people

[49:50] over there maybe I'll I'll I'll hit up George Gomez I'll race his Porsche with my demon and be

[49:56] like winner gets interviews how's that George anyway everyone have a great night enjoy the black

[50:03] night enjoy the optimism and positivity around it while at last and pin side don't be your normal

[50:09] selves and start start crapping on the game and that's my final point how nice is it that we got

[50:15] a new game release right we got a new game reveal and hilton is nowhere to be found it is so refreshing

[50:22] that that guy is not in on all these threads with his presence like poo pooing everything robin if

[50:29] you're listening your site has been so much better over the last like 20 days without him I would

[50:35] just make that a permanent thing have a great night everybody
