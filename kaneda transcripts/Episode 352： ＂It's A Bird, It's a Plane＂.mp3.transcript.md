[00:00] Music

[00:15] Well, I guess we all know we're all the Superman 78 rumors originated from, not from the planet

[00:23] Krypton, but from Christopher Franchi.

[00:26] So let's talk a little bit about that and I'll read some of your emails recently and

[00:31] then I have two rumors that I'm hearing are possibly going to happen this week, but let's

[00:36] start with the rumors because you know I love to give you guys what I think is going

[00:41] to happen in the pinball world.

[00:43] So here are the rumors that I'm hearing will be announced this week.

[00:48] In fact, I'm hearing these will be May 15th, which is tomorrow.

[00:52] So if you believe these rumors to be true, we will hear from Stern Pinball tomorrow

[00:58] on two new variations of Stern Pinball games that are going to be available to consumers.

[01:04] Now we've been talking a little bit about this on previous shows.

[01:09] Some of them seem to be like going back and forth on whether or not they're going to

[01:12] happen, but here's what I'm hearing will be the news from Stern Pinball.

[01:17] I'm hearing on May 15th Stern will announce that there will be a cat woman edition of Batman

[01:24] 66 Premium.

[01:26] Now you know we've reported this rumor before, then I was told it was shelved.

[01:30] Now I'm saying, now I'm being told it's back on.

[01:33] I'm pretty confirmed on this one.

[01:36] So as far as rumors go, I would say there's a 90% chance you are going to see a cat woman

[01:43] edition of Batman 66 Premium.

[01:46] This seems to be like their ACDC Lucy version of Batman.

[01:50] It makes sense when you think about it.

[01:53] A lot of guys out there who are on the fence about this game, they might want to get a little

[01:58] sensual cat woman action into their arcade.

[02:02] The game code is now finished.

[02:04] Batman is one of Stern's best games that has come out in the last few years.

[02:10] And they have the, I think they have a license for a very long time.

[02:14] Remember, this is Joe Kamikaw in Kepow.

[02:17] So I think this is a game that you're going to see Stern make for a very long time.

[02:21] And this will breathe new life into it.

[02:24] Because if you think about it, the only thing keeping people from Batman 66 at this point

[02:30] is they might not love the premium package that is out there and they might want something

[02:34] a little bit sexier.

[02:37] So a cat woman edition would be really cool.

[02:39] Okay.

[02:40] So the other rumor I'm hearing, I'm not sure if this is going to happen or not, but it

[02:43] sort of makes sense.

[02:44] If you think about the way Stern does stuff, I think this one also does make sense.

[02:49] But we'll see if this is also the thing they announce.

[02:51] And that is the fact that they are going to make a colored version of the monsters.

[02:58] Okay.

[02:59] So previously all the monsters premiums have been black and white.

[03:02] And I'm hearing that there's going to be a color variation of the fall, you know, lower

[03:06] play field and upper play field.

[03:09] But you're going to get what you see in the Ellie play field of the monsters.

[03:13] How do we feel about that if that happens?

[03:15] Well here's the thing.

[03:16] I think monster's sales have probably started to falter.

[03:22] And if Stern thinks that adding a color version of the play field art is going to spark

[03:28] some sales of the monsters, I don't think it's going to happen because I think the problem

[03:33] with the monsters right now has nothing to do with the art packages because I think the

[03:39] art package is that Franchi did her absolutely stellar.

[03:42] I think the black and white is absolutely a killer art package.

[03:47] The reason why people are not buying the monsters is because of the code in the game.

[03:52] Now they might not want to admit that I know code is subjective.

[03:56] Everything in pinball is subjective when you think about it.

[03:59] But the real problem with the monsters is it's been out for a while.

[04:03] People have it, but it hasn't really caught on.

[04:06] You know, by this point, when a game is near 1.0 code, if people aren't raving about the

[04:13] game, I mean, people are raving about the way the game shoots, but time and time again,

[04:17] what is the one thing we keep hearing being the Achilles heel of the monsters?

[04:22] It's the code.

[04:23] And if Stern really wants to get more people into the monsters, I think they need to address

[04:27] the code, not the color of the art on the game.

[04:33] But that's what I'm hearing on May 15th, which is tomorrow, color, monster's premium,

[04:38] catwoman edition of Batman.

[04:41] All right.

[04:42] Now it's kind of funny that we're talking about two games and two art packages by Christopher

[04:46] Franchi.

[04:47] And we saw last night that the Superman, the movie, Superman 78, the art package from

[04:55] that pinball machine was revealed to the world, was shared with the world.

[04:59] I want to talk a little bit about that and our thoughts on that.

[05:03] Let's first of all, let's just say once and for all that the Superman 78 has been a

[05:09] rumor for a really long time.

[05:12] And now we know why it's been a rumor for a really long time because clearly amongst

[05:18] the pinball community, right, the inner circle of people who talk about and speculate about

[05:23] what titles are coming next from these companies.

[05:26] Why was Superman always in the mix?

[05:29] And the reason why is clearly this artwork had been shared with people out there.

[05:36] Because if it just went to Stern, if this was just designed and went to Stern as a suggestion

[05:42] of a game we might want to pursue, that's one thing.

[05:46] But when you start to share the artwork with people out there, that puts it into the

[05:51] rumor mill because if you saw this and you didn't know any better, you would just think

[05:55] like, yeah, like that's awesome.

[05:57] Because as we know in pinball, usually artwork happens after a deal is done and the license

[06:04] is approved.

[06:05] And now we're starting to work on a game because remember, like if you start putting Stern

[06:10] logos onto art packages and showing people what it looks like on a pinball machine, let

[06:16] me see if the Stern logo is actually on this.

[06:18] I didn't really, let me see.

[06:21] I don't think it is.

[06:22] Okay, so there's no Stern logo, which is good because I think that also would confuse

[06:27] people into thinking that it's a done deal.

[06:29] So it wasn't.

[06:30] This is definitely, and it's even watermarked with Christopher Franchise.

[06:34] So he just did this package.

[06:35] So it wasn't attributed to Stern yet.

[06:39] But the thing is this, people will start to jump to conclusions.

[06:43] And this is the first thing I want to talk about before I talk about the art.

[06:45] Because the art looks phenomenal.

[06:46] Let's just start there.

[06:47] The art looks great.

[06:49] I mean, there is no denying that Christopher Franchise is an incredibly talented artist.

[06:55] And when he applies his art skills to pinball, it looks really good.

[06:59] And I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think his style is perfect for pinball.

[07:04] Because so much of what we want to see on a pinball cabinet and on a play field, and

[07:08] when it comes to stuff like movies and TV shows and our favorite themes, he captures

[07:13] it so nicely because we don't want Photoshop, drag and drop.

[07:18] We want something illustrated.

[07:19] And he kind of blends the best of both worlds where it's exactly what you remember in the

[07:24] property.

[07:25] But it's illustrated in a really nice and colorful way.

[07:28] And that's why I think Franchise's art is stellar.

[07:31] And he's contributed such amazing work to pinball.

[07:34] OK.

[07:35] So but the thing about it is this, when you're an artist in pinball and you want to contribute

[07:42] to pinball and be an artist in the pinball world, the thing you want the most of is work.

[07:48] And we heard it from him recently.

[07:50] It's not really easy to have consistent work lined up in pinball.

[07:56] Because it's simple, there aren't that many pinball games that come out a year.

[08:01] Now you also can't contribute.

[08:04] The same artist can't contribute to competitive companies.

[08:09] It just wouldn't work out.

[08:10] There's just not enough companies out there.

[08:13] And they're each looking to differentiate themselves from the competitive set.

[08:18] And so an artist is stamp on a game is such a big stamp.

[08:23] Right.

[08:24] If David if David tealed that I always say his name wrong, if he does sound for different

[08:27] companies, I don't think it would matter as much.

[08:29] You just want the best sound possible.

[08:31] But it's not a visual thing.

[08:34] Pinball is so visual.

[08:36] You know, it's a work of art.

[08:37] I've always said it.

[08:38] It's a work of art.

[08:39] As Mr. Franchie will tell you himself, people want variety.

[08:42] They want to have work from different artists.

[08:45] They don't want every game they have to look the same or have the same exact style.

[08:50] And because of that, right, most pinball companies have different artists that they have on board.

[08:54] But I would say this, a pinball company's roster of artists.

[08:59] It's sort of like their bench, right.

[09:02] It's their players that they put on the field.

[09:04] It's one of their strengths.

[09:06] One of the reasons why their games will either look better or sell more because they have

[09:12] better artists on board.

[09:14] I mean, look at the difference between Stern's artist and the artist at American pinball.

[09:20] And ask yourself, like, how much better would an American pinball game sell if their art

[09:24] if their art packages were better, right?

[09:26] And I've even said this before, Stern has the best artists in the game.

[09:30] Nobody has better art packages right now than Stern pinball.

[09:33] They're better than Jersey Jack.

[09:34] They're better than American pinball.

[09:36] I think Spooky's Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle is now on the same level.

[09:41] I mean, that game looks great.

[09:43] But before that, no way.

[09:44] I'm trying to think, who am I missing here?

[09:46] The better artist than P3, multi-morphic, better artist, Chicago game is just doing remakes,

[09:53] better artists in home pin.

[09:54] So anyway, so you know what I'm saying?

[09:56] Stern is really acquired some of the greatest pinball artists out there and applied them

[10:03] to their games.

[10:04] Okay, so here's my thing.

[10:07] And I know, and I know, like, Chris is like a really passionate guy.

[10:11] Here's the thing, does this mean, and I'm just going to talk out loud because I haven't

[10:15] asked him any of this stuff, does this mean that he is not going to be working anymore

[10:21] with Stern because he revealed this?

[10:23] And I just want to talk about hypotheticals.

[10:26] Here's the thing, if you're Stern, you can't be happy that this is being shared.

[10:32] And I'll explain why.

[10:34] Because think about it, all this is doing is it is saying, here is a theme that many,

[10:40] many people love.

[10:42] Here is a theme that has been rumored for months to possibly be coming out because these

[10:47] images have been shared by people in the community.

[10:51] Now it makes it look like Stern said no to a theme that you love, right?

[10:57] Now it makes it seem like Stern passed.

[11:00] Like there was a lack of enthusiasm over at Stern to make Superman and to make Beetle

[11:05] Juice.

[11:06] And if you're Stern, how can you be happy that that was revealed to the world?

[11:12] Even if it's true or not true, you still don't want your artist that you're paying money

[11:18] to, that you're contracting to work with you.

[11:21] You've given him how many jobs now, right?

[11:24] Christopher Franchi has had a job with Batman, a job with Gardens of the Galaxy, a job

[11:29] with Monsters, right?

[11:31] Three jobs, maybe possibly more, right?

[11:34] You don't want someone that you are trusting to be a member of your team to share with

[11:41] the outside world concepts that he's pitching you.

[11:45] And here's why, and this is the same thing in my industry.

[11:47] I come up with ideas all the time for major brands.

[11:51] A lot of times they pass on those ideas.

[11:54] If I shared with you what those ideas were after the client passed, they would fire me.

[12:01] And here's why they would fire me because there might be lots of different variables

[12:06] why they passed on those ideas.

[12:08] But those ideas making its way out into the world does nothing but hurt the client because

[12:14] it makes people feel like maybe the client's lame, like why didn't they do that?

[12:19] That was such a good idea.

[12:20] I can't believe they passed on it.

[12:22] So there's that element of it, right?

[12:25] It just makes the client look like they weren't able to make it happen.

[12:29] Right?

[12:30] And I see people saying this now, like Stern is passing on all these great themes, like

[12:33] why are they doing that?

[12:34] And we don't know exactly why, but we shouldn't even know that they even passed on it.

[12:39] Like this is just the normal relationship between a client and a contractor.

[12:46] Like you're just not supposed to do this.

[12:49] And the other thing is this, when you share these ideas and you put these ideas out into

[12:55] the world, and I'm just going to say this, this is what happens.

[12:58] And we know this about Pimball especially.

[13:01] If people hear there's a rumored title and they see a work of art like this just floating

[13:06] around as a concept, what will happen is this.

[13:09] Some people might actually not buy a current game available by Stern because they might

[13:16] be waiting for Superman to come out or might be waiting for Beetlejuice to come out because

[13:22] not only do they have a rumor it might come out, but maybe someone sent them a photo of

[13:27] this cabin and be like, look, they're working on it.

[13:30] Because guess what?

[13:31] Most of the times we've seen cabinet artwork leaked into the world, the games have come

[13:37] out, right?

[13:38] Remember when Ghostbusters artwork was being shared left and right for about eight months

[13:41] before the game was revealed?

[13:43] It was a big reason why that game sold out before it even came out.

[13:47] So that's my only thing is I just think that this relationship between Chris and Stern

[13:53] has to be at some breaking point.

[13:57] And maybe I'm wrong.

[13:58] Maybe I'm completely wrong.

[13:59] But I'm just trying to look at this through the lens of both parties involved.

[14:05] If I'm Stern, I can't be happy about this.

[14:07] There's no way I could be happy about this.

[14:09] You don't want to, you don't want someone sharing what they're pitching to you out into

[14:14] the world.

[14:15] Okay?

[14:16] If I'm Chris, I'm probably a little bit frustrated, right?

[14:18] An entire year.

[14:20] You've done all these great art packages.

[14:22] You're one of the main reasons why people are getting excited about Stern's offerings

[14:27] and you don't have anything on the roster this year.

[14:31] And you're frustrated because you want to keep making pinball artwork.

[14:34] And we know Chris loves the industry.

[14:36] He loves the hobby.

[14:37] He loves being involved.

[14:38] Like he wants to be more than just a pinball artist.

[14:42] He also wants to be a pinball personality, right?

[14:45] A pinball spokesperson.

[14:47] I still think he should do his own show.

[14:49] That's been my advice to Chris and Day 1.

[14:52] You know, literally, I have to be honest.

[14:55] I just fast forward on the slap safe show now to hear what he has to say because his

[15:00] stuff is direct.

[15:02] It's to the point.

[15:03] It's energetic.

[15:04] And he doesn't hold punches.

[15:06] And I've said it.

[15:07] It's a show within a show.

[15:09] I really don't get the way this whole thing is being marketed to us.

[15:13] You have to, it's a show within a show.

[15:16] And it's like the slap safe pinball podcast is proud to bring to you Christopher Franchise

[15:20] artwork.

[15:21] Like what is going on here?

[15:22] It's so weird.

[15:23] It's like this marriage of these two entities because they're not the same.

[15:27] They're two completely different things.

[15:29] Christopher Franchise, if he wants to share with us his Superman art, just share it.

[15:33] Why does it have to be delivered?

[15:35] Like in a segment on another show.

[15:36] And the whole thing is like, it's so clear they're trying to market.

[15:39] Get, go to the slap safe site.

[15:41] Go to this site.

[15:42] Go to this.

[15:43] Listen at this time.

[15:44] I mean, just drop it out in the world.

[15:46] If you want to drop it out in the world, it doesn't have to be this marketing tool.

[15:52] But that's my point is it seems like the relationship is at a little bit of a fractured

[15:56] point.

[15:57] I don't know how you see it any other way.

[16:00] We haven't heard from the other party involved.

[16:02] We've heard Chris' take on everything.

[16:04] But I would love to hear from George Gomez.

[16:06] I would love to hear from Stern.

[16:07] And here's what.

[16:08] Here's what.

[16:09] I don't think you're going to hear anything from them because I think Stern does what Stern

[16:13] does best.

[16:14] And I think Stern acts professionally.

[16:16] And the professional thing to do is not to comment on this.

[16:20] The professional thing to do is keep your IP and keep your company secrets close to the

[16:28] vest.

[16:29] And that is what Stern does.

[16:31] And think about it for a minute.

[16:33] Over the last few years, the only times we've seen stuff earlier or the speculation happens,

[16:40] it never really comes from Stern internal.

[16:42] I mean, Stern is very good at keeping what's next close to the vest and secret.

[16:50] And so I just think that Stern has to be frustrated that this is out there.

[16:55] They can't be happy about it.

[16:57] And I think Chris, if I could give him some advice because I know he listens to every

[17:01] podcast and I know he's always upset at me for something.

[17:05] If I could just give him some advice, it's this.

[17:07] You are super talented.

[17:09] You are one of the most talented pinball artists and people love your work.

[17:14] You're an outspoken personality.

[17:15] You have a great sort of point of view.

[17:18] You have a very energetic and passionate take on the world and on pinball and on life.

[17:24] But I just think that your talent should always do the talking.

[17:29] And when you're working with companies, you have to do it.

[17:31] You have to.

[17:32] You have to.

[17:33] 100%.

[17:35] You have to respect the fact that they're paying you to do a job and the contract between

[17:42] you and them should remain between you and them and nobody else.

[17:46] And nobody else.

[17:47] Never, never put yourself in any positions of being vulnerable where stuff gets out there.

[17:52] And even when you're excited about work, and this is the biggest thing, even when you're

[17:56] so excited about an idea.

[17:58] And even if you own that idea, there just might be times in which it's not appropriate

[18:04] to share it because it could hurt the relationship you might have.

[18:09] And I hate to see Chris no longer get stuff out the door with the world's biggest pinball

[18:15] company because we all know if you're a pinball artist, who has the most opportunity for

[18:20] work for you?

[18:21] Who?

[18:22] It's definitely, it's definitely Stern pinball.

[18:25] Now look, we're allowed to speculate where Chris might start doing stuff next.

[18:30] If you were to ask me, the company that should just knock on his door and say, do stuff for

[18:35] us is American pinball.

[18:36] They are in dire need of some better art talent.

[18:40] Okay.

[18:41] I don't know if going over to J.J.P. makes sense.

[18:44] I'll tell you why because if I'm Jack, I don't want my games to start to look like Stern

[18:49] games from a few years ago.

[18:52] I just wouldn't.

[18:53] I would want my games to look different.

[18:56] There are so many talented artists out there.

[18:58] That's the other thing too.

[18:59] As much as I love these artists and it's true, there are so many talented artists that

[19:04] are equal if not better, if not worse.

[19:07] They run the gamut.

[19:09] Sometimes it's funny to me how pinball, we put people into the ring.

[19:14] We lock ourselves in a little pinball box and we think, this is it.

[19:18] These are the only coders that are out there that can do pinball.

[19:21] These are the only artists.

[19:22] These are the only designers.

[19:24] I'm telling you, you're wrong.

[19:26] It's not true.

[19:27] I mean, the mystery game that I know about, I haven't really talked about recently, the

[19:33] art on it, blow you away.

[19:36] Blow you away good.

[19:37] Not by anyone you know.

[19:38] Not by anyone who's been making pinball, the design on it.

[19:41] Blow you away awesome.

[19:42] Not by any designer you know.

[19:44] It's just like I'm saying, there's always a chance for new blood to come into the hobby

[19:48] and do amazing stuff.

[19:50] All I want to say in this hobby, it was really cool to see it.

[19:53] I hope it doesn't have any long lasting damage between stern and crisp.

[19:58] I want to see Chris do more stuff in pinball.

[20:00] There's no, you know, and that's it.

[20:02] That's it.

[20:03] I do think there just needs to, if we want to start talking about professionalism and ethics

[20:08] and all this stuff.

[20:11] Sometimes you just have to learn that even though you're excited about something, it might

[20:15] not be in your best interest to share it.

[20:18] You got to think long term what this will do to me.

[20:22] And I get, I struggle with this all the time in my career because I come up with all these

[20:25] amazing ideas that brands pass on and I just can't share them with you because it would

[20:29] just hurt me.

[20:30] I be known as someone who reveals what's happening behind the doors and you don't want that

[20:35] to be like, you know, hanging over you.

[20:37] All right.

[20:38] All right.

[20:39] Let us, what else I want to talk about.

[20:40] Let's talk about it.

[20:41] I got a few, I gave, this is short episode.

[20:43] I'm just going to give you a read some comments from people and then I'm going to call it

[20:46] a day.

[20:47] So, let's see.

[20:48] Let's see.

[20:49] From R.D.

[20:50] and he writes, Hey, canada.

[20:52] With the news that Stern passed on Superman 78 on top of Beetlejuice, that news that no

[20:58] one at the company was passionate about making these themes, I have to revisit this email.

[21:04] I sent you a few months ago about Stern's designers are holding the company back in the

[21:09] 1960s.

[21:11] Ben HECK alluded to it during your recent interview that if these pinball dinosaur designers are

[21:16] only going to make themes from when they were kids, this hobby would neither, sorry, will

[21:22] wither and die as these older folks die out.

[21:26] As a collector in my early 30s, I feel left behind by Stern pinball.

[21:32] Forget Toho Godzilla, forget the beetles, forget TV shows from the 60s and make something

[21:37] from the 21st century, please, R.D.

[21:40] All right.

[21:41] So, here's the thing.

[21:43] Does, does that ring true now?

[21:45] Do we feel like Stern is stuck?

[21:47] Right.

[21:48] John Borg's dream theme is the monsters.

[21:50] You released the monsters in 2019 and you expect it to be a sales home run.

[21:57] Right.

[21:58] Doesn't it seem comical?

[21:59] The monsters is a show that isn't even on TV.

[22:03] You never hear people talk about it.

[22:05] I agree.

[22:06] I think monsters is a damn hail Mary pass if you want to sell a lot of that theme.

[22:12] Batman 66 is a little bit different because Batman is iconic.

[22:16] Batman is remained in culture throughout the decades.

[22:20] Monsters has not.

[22:21] So I think monsters are much bigger gambled than Batman.

[22:25] But it does speak some volumes that when you ask these designers what are they passionate

[22:31] about?

[22:32] What is your dream that you want to make?

[22:34] It's not stuff that's recent, right?

[22:37] It's these older properties.

[22:39] But that being said, we did get Guardians of the Galaxy.

[22:44] We did get Star Wars, which they completely fumbled.

[22:48] We've got what Iron Maiden, which is old.

[22:50] We've got what else is coming out?

[22:52] Jurassic World will be new.

[22:54] We're hearing about that.

[22:55] But Elvira, another ancient one.

[22:58] So I do agree that there is a lot.

[23:02] There is a lot of movies.

[23:03] There's a lot of franchises from even like the 80s and 90s that I feel like Stern

[23:09] needs to think about.

[23:11] One of them being the Matrix.

[23:13] Where's the Matrix pinball?

[23:15] Why doesn't Stern read...

[23:16] There's so many good movies from the 80s that would be awesome.

[23:20] What about Top Gun?

[23:21] Top Guns coming out again.

[23:23] What about Karate Kid?

[23:25] Right?

[23:26] There's a lot of stuff.

[23:27] I know some of these things have licensing issues.

[23:30] But the number one selling game of Stern, Ghostbusters.

[23:35] This has to be their best selling game in the last five years.

[23:38] What's going on?

[23:39] Ghostbusters.

[23:40] Why are they not looking at mid 80s to mid 90s?

[23:43] Right?

[23:44] I'm 42.

[23:45] A lot of you out there are also like in your 40s.

[23:48] I think there's the more new people coming into the hobby.

[23:51] They're younger.

[23:52] They're young money.

[23:54] They grew up as children of the 80s and the 90s.

[23:58] And I think we're being underserved themes in those areas.

[24:02] But hey, it's not just Stern's problem.

[24:04] What about where are those kinds of themes from Jersey Jack?

[24:07] Right.

[24:08] Well, look, we're all getting excited about Willy Wonka.

[24:10] Willy Wonka.

[24:11] Guess what year?

[24:13] 1971.

[24:14] 71.

[24:15] Five years before I was born.

[24:17] I did grow up watching it.

[24:19] But still, Willy Wonka.

[24:20] Before that.

[24:21] Wizard of Oz.

[24:23] All right?

[24:25] You know, Stern has made like Game of Thrones.

[24:27] They botched that too.

[24:28] I mean, poor Steve Richie had like the two home run themes that just we're just ended

[24:32] up being like mediocre pins.

[24:34] Game of Thrones, you know.

[24:36] What else?

[24:37] I'm just trying to think like, yeah, I agree.

[24:39] I agree.

[24:40] There's so many.

[24:41] I don't even make a good out of list of like 90s and 80s movies.

[24:42] But it goes on and on and on.

[24:45] How many good themes are out there that have never been put into pinball form?

[24:51] So deep root, are you hearing me?

[24:53] Go get some more of those 80s and 90s themes.

[24:56] Forget about John Papaduke's stuff.

[24:58] Like I really think deep root is silly.

[25:01] If they think anything John Papaduke, any John Papaduke IP will never sell nearly as

[25:08] well.

[25:09] I don't care what it is.

[25:10] Magic Girl, Roz, they put them all together, put them in a blender, Magic Girl, Roz, a

[25:14] Spatemission X.

[25:16] Robert might be misguided thinking John's IPs are where to invest.

[25:19] It is way more beneficial to go get as many of those hot properties from the 80s and 90s

[25:25] and make pinball machines.

[25:26] And you will sell five times as many of those as you will of retro atomic zombie adventure

[25:34] land.

[25:35] There's more things on a theme park on a nuclear power plant.

[25:39] Give me top gun, give me the need for speed.

[25:41] Give me sweep the lake, give me coberkai any day over that crap.

[25:45] Come on.

[25:46] Come on.

[25:47] All right.

[25:48] Let me see.

[25:49] I got another email here.

[25:50] I got an email from do do do do.

[25:52] Welcome to Tuesday morning inside.

[25:54] Canada's head.

[25:55] I got an email from do do walk a mixtape from Jason Zimmerman.

[25:59] He said, thanks for the extended mix.

[26:02] That was our mother's day back patio by the pool jam was a huge hit.

[26:08] Thanks again.

[26:09] Canada, man of the people.

[26:10] So for those of you who saw I put up another music mix.

[26:13] This one starts out the same as the other one, but it's extended by like another hour.

[26:18] I have a lot of music mixes that my brothers made over the years.

[26:21] They're all really cool.

[26:22] Not all like mashups like 80s like that.

[26:24] But what I will do on this podcast is I will put up at least once a month a music mix

[26:31] for you guys just to enjoy.

[26:32] That's it.

[26:33] That's it.

[26:34] See, the thing about life and I'm going to take you down a 30 second journey of life.

[26:40] Pimball is great.

[26:41] Pimball is awesome.

[26:42] Pimball is fun.

[26:44] Pimball pales in comparison to a good song and music to me.

[26:50] Can you have a few friends over with what do you want to do it?

[26:53] You want to just only play Pimball?

[26:54] No.

[26:55] Now, what could be the best of both worlds is you put on one of Canada's mixes that his brother

[27:01] made and you play some Pimball and you drink some whiskey.

[27:06] Then, then you're living the dream.

[27:08] Then you're living life to its fullest people.

[27:10] All right.

[27:11] I got an email from, let's see.

[27:13] Matthew D saying showing unfinished Pimball machines.

[27:18] Hey, Canada.

[27:19] Enjoy the show and think you're dead on about a lot of the issues with current Pimball games

[27:25] and marketing.

[27:26] I just wanted to comment on the discussion in your last podcast about how Pimball companies

[27:32] are the only industry that shows their unfinished products to consumers and reviewers.

[27:38] Video game companies do this all the time with downloadable demos or trade shows like

[27:43] E3.

[27:45] But the difference there, I think, is that while they might change a few things with the

[27:50] final product, they are generally providing the player with a vertical slice of the game

[27:57] that is all the main components.

[27:59] Game mechanics, art, sound music, complete it for that 10 minute or so of the game they're

[28:04] showing.

[28:05] I'm still a Pimball new, working on buying my first pin.

[28:09] I haven't really gotten into the streams yet, but it sounds like they are showing people

[28:14] games without call outs or finish code, which is basically like showing me a video game

[28:20] demo that is missing sound effects or a key mechanic.

[28:24] Not a great marketing strategy.

[28:26] Like I said, enjoy the show.

[28:28] Keep them coming because my commute sucks.

[28:30] Matt, well Matt, first of all, thank you for listening and welcome to the world of Pimball.

[28:36] And we should talk about what your first game should be.

[28:38] I'm always, it's always great to break in a Pimball Virgin into their first game.

[28:44] It didn't come across as sounding as well as I wanted it to.

[28:47] But Matt, here's the thing, you're totally right.

[28:49] You're totally right because I worked in the video game industry and we would always have

[28:53] games at shows and we would have downloadable demos of a game.

[28:56] And you're right, we would work really hard to make sure that that demo displayed the

[29:02] best elements of the game to get people excited.

[29:05] You can't do that with Pimball, right?

[29:08] It'd be like, that'd be like the equivalent of showing up to like a show with just the

[29:14] upper play field of Pirate of the Caribbean and showing people this is going to be in the

[29:17] game and here's how it's going to work.

[29:19] You can't give people just a little slice of the game.

[29:23] And that's why when you show a Pimball machine early and it's missing stuff, like I get

[29:28] why people do it.

[29:30] But I think, again, I think it's just a bad marketing strategy.

[29:33] If you want to really sell your Pimball machines and you want them to fly out of the showroom

[29:39] and you want them to like go and leave the warehouse in droves, put 50 games in a box, make

[29:46] a game great.

[29:47] You know, it's so easy to know what everybody wants in Pimball nowadays.

[29:50] Make it great, put it in a box, show the world, it when it's done and watch people order

[29:55] it.

[29:56] Now, look, the reason why I think people show it early, I'm going to be honest, the reason

[30:00] why my people show it early, I think companies are a little bit insecure and they want to

[30:04] get feedback and their nervous, they didn't do everything right and they want to know what

[30:07] people think because they, if they're nervous, they might have got some stuff wrong.

[30:12] But guess who doesn't show anything early?

[30:15] Guess who doesn't give you any sneak peek?

[30:18] Guess who sells the most Pimball machines every day, every month, every hour, every year.

[30:23] It is so easy to follow Stern's formula.

[30:26] I think Oryx said it best on why Andrew Highway and these other companies show stuff early,

[30:32] they need to remain relevant.

[30:34] No one's talking about them because they have nothing, right?

[30:37] They have nothing.

[30:38] They have, imagine if you're a new Pimball company, you have nothing and you want to get

[30:41] people excited, you want to get people's money to be set aside for your game, you rush

[30:46] to show it.

[30:47] And, you know, but we've seen over time that 90% of the time that move has done nothing

[30:53] but hurt companies, not help them.

[30:56] I mean, you think October Fest is going to be flying off the shelf now after we've seen

[31:00] it for eight months, we didn't see it complete.

[31:02] Now they've got, you know, even if word of mouth is good on the game, it's going to be

[31:06] an extremely, extremely slow burn.

[31:09] And that's on them.

[31:10] There's no reason why they had to show that game in October and now they're suffering

[31:15] for it.

[31:16] And I don't want to see these companies suffer because the way to launch a game is so

[31:19] damn easy.

[31:20] Wake up kids.

[31:21] All you manufacturers out there, wake up, look at what Stern is doing.

[31:25] Stop acting like amateur hour.

[31:28] We all have the playbook now.

[31:30] Stop trying to do it your way.

[31:31] All right.

[31:32] Follow the playbook.

[31:33] I got an email from Scott, a team in, he says, thanks for the great music mix, but enjoying

[31:40] it all morning, a trip back to so many of my childhood favorites.

[31:43] And please tell me you've watched Cobra Kai.

[31:46] It's like the studio had a pipeline into my most secret fantasy idea for a TV show and

[31:51] then made it.

[31:52] I think you'd enjoy it too.

[31:54] Keep doing what you're doing.

[31:55] I really enjoy the show.

[31:57] Scott and oh my god, that chocolate waterfall mod WTF, right?

[32:02] So Scott, first of all, I'm glad you're enjoying the mix.

[32:05] I've seen Cobra Kai, both seasons.

[32:07] I love it.

[32:08] Here's the best part.

[32:09] Brenda loves it.

[32:10] Bubba loves it.

[32:11] Cobra Kai is such an amazing TV show.

[32:13] It's so much better than Game of Thrones.

[32:15] It's not even funny.

[32:16] It's so much more rewarding than Game of Thrones.

[32:18] It's not even funny.

[32:19] Game of Thrones final season is, it's sort of,

[32:22] the Game of Thrones final season is like that Willy Wonka mod in the upper left corner.

[32:28] It's one steaming pile and river of crap.

[32:32] That's what it looks like.

[32:34] I love the mod couple.

[32:36] I love Yellowbird.

[32:38] 99% of what they make is amazing.

[32:40] That chocolate river mod needs to go.

[32:42] They need to flush it down the toilet.

[32:44] If you put that in a toilet, it would look like it's finally where it belongs.

[32:49] All right.

[32:50] What else does it go?

[32:51] I want to charge $38 for that thing.

[32:54] $38 for what looks like diarrhea.

[32:59] Can we, I don't mean to pick on this one mod because they make everything else they make

[33:03] is so good.

[33:04] But there has, I'm sorry.

[33:06] I just can't get over it.

[33:07] I can't get over $38 for that.

[33:09] So Jerry is coming on the show from P3.

[33:13] Jerry Stollenberg.

[33:14] I'm going to interview him tonight.

[33:16] What we're going to do is a little bit different.

[33:18] We agreed to do it the way I suggest it.

[33:20] But Jerry's going to ask me the questions that he wants to know and we're going to do it

[33:24] that way.

[33:25] All right.

[33:26] I got an email from David Sleimaker.

[33:28] Do you get a lot of boomers complaining about the 80s mixes?

[33:32] Seems like boomers are always bitching about something.

[33:35] Well too bad because I love them.

[33:37] Great job Alex.

[33:38] That's my brother.

[33:40] Keep doing things the way you want to do them because it works.

[33:43] Well David, no.

[33:44] I haven't had any issues with boomers.

[33:46] Thank you for letting us know that you can't stand boomers.

[33:50] I am happy to tell you that I think everyone's enjoying that mix.

[33:55] I don't think you could ever do that or listen to that mix and not enjoy it.

[34:00] All right.

[34:01] I think that is it.

[34:03] I got one more from Jay McGuire.

[34:05] He said internet connectivity.

[34:07] He said you cracked me up with your K-A-N-E-D-A high score commentary.

[34:12] Yeah, there's not a lot you can do about cheaters.

[34:15] You run into the same problem with internet connected games with a friend too.

[34:20] Unless you got cameras on both your friend and his play field.

[34:24] Short of live camera feeds, you could add a sensor to make sure the glass is in place,

[34:29] but it could easily be bypassed.

[34:31] Maybe an algorithm for detecting unrealistic scoring patterns.

[34:35] Unfortunately cheaters are going to cheat.

[34:38] I don't understand it myself.

[34:40] I'd compare submitting a fake pinball score to buying someone else's bowling trophy at

[34:46] a garage sale.

[34:47] Congrats, Skippy, you're a loser.

[34:51] Jay, I mean, look, of course you can always cheat if you did pinball internet connected

[34:56] scoring.

[34:58] But we would know because here's the thing.

[35:00] It'd be funny if you had these incredibly high scores on the internet scoreboard and

[35:04] then you went to a show or an event and someone's like, all right, now it's your turn.

[35:09] That's how you got that 18 billion on Batman and you get like 75 million.

[35:14] Whatever.

[35:15] It's coming.

[35:17] The scoreboard is coming.

[35:19] All right.

[35:20] This has been, I think, episode 352 of Canadian Spin Ball podcast.

[35:26] Someone asked me recently, how do you do so many and how do you not burn out?

[35:30] I've been talking to a few of the people behind the scenes who do other podcasts.

[35:34] It's real simple.

[35:35] My advice to everybody out there, I'm not going to give you some long-winded thing.

[35:39] It's real simple.

[35:40] I just podcast when I feel like it and I associate my podcast with the equivalent of singing

[35:46] in the shower.

[35:47] That's what it's like for me.

[35:48] And right now it's 848 in the morning.

[35:51] I'm about to jump into work.

[35:53] I woke up.

[35:54] I grabbed my mic.

[35:55] I'm recording this podcast.

[35:57] Here's what's going to happen.

[35:58] Within three to five minutes, this podcast will be live on air for you to listen to.

[36:02] I do zero editing.

[36:04] I do zero editing.

[36:06] You see me.

[36:07] Sometimes I fumble over words.

[36:08] I don't say stuff.

[36:09] Sometimes I pause.

[36:10] Sometimes I catch myself in a train of thought.

[36:13] Then I don't care.

[36:14] I just uploaded.

[36:15] Why would I waste all this time editing it to sound perfect?

[36:19] I don't make any money doing it.

[36:20] I just put it up for you.

[36:21] Then you get it immediately.

[36:23] The other thing I don't do, I don't do segments.

[36:25] I don't have like, and now around the play field with Chris and Bubba as we go around,

[36:31] because all you're doing when you create segments on a show, you're creating more work

[36:36] for yourself.

[36:38] And then you have to continue to do homework to fill those segments.

[36:42] The other thing I never do, and this is the one piece of advice I never took from Ben

[36:47] Heck.

[36:48] Ben Heck once said to me, you should have your show be every Monday, Friday, and you should

[36:52] schedule it.

[36:53] Your show should be up on those dates.

[36:57] Canate is pinball podcasts.

[36:58] You never know what dates coming out.

[37:00] There's no like Monday.

[37:01] Every Monday it's going to be like our podcast and every Friday or every this.

[37:06] Because when you do that, what you've done to yourself now, again, none of us are making

[37:10] money.

[37:11] What you've done to yourself is you've put pressure on yourself to deliver.

[37:15] And then when you don't deliver on that date, what happens?

[37:18] It's like head to head this week.

[37:19] Well sorry, no show this week.

[37:20] Oh, now you've like failed to meet the expectations of your audience.

[37:24] Because this show doesn't do that, I can never miss a date because there never is a date.

[37:29] And I can never be late for my own show because there's never a time.

[37:34] But what this show does do, right?

[37:35] You know this.

[37:36] I comes out all the time.

[37:38] It's like, that's the thing.

[37:39] There is a constant cadence of Canate's pinball podcast.

[37:41] And I love doing it.

[37:42] They ask me like, why don't you get burnt out?

[37:45] Because I don't get burnt out.

[37:47] I enjoy having a commentary with you guys about pinball.

[37:51] And I do it on my terms.

[37:52] I don't imagine how much more work it would be if I had someone else with me on every

[37:57] show.

[37:58] I have to say something than I have to hear them say something.

[38:00] And then if I interview someone, it's like three people in a room.

[38:03] So much harder.

[38:05] And then you have to edit.

[38:06] And then you have to do stuff.

[38:07] And then you have to like, you know, I don't have to do anything.

[38:10] I just have to give you guys a pinball podcast.

[38:13] I do it.

[38:14] I love it.

[38:15] I enjoy it.

[38:16] I think this is what works for me.

[38:17] Everybody do it works for you.

[38:19] We enjoy this show.

[38:20] And I hope to do this show for a very long time because I know a lot of you really love

[38:23] it.

[38:24] And I will say the final reason why I don't get burnt out.

[38:27] The final reason why I love doing this show is for all of you out there who listen.

[38:32] Every week and Brenda will tell you this.

[38:34] I get really excited when I put up an episode.

[38:36] And within a first few minutes, it's like 50 listens within six hours, 500 listens within

[38:43] it within 12 hours now usually there's a thousand people are listening to the show within

[38:47] 24 hours.

[38:49] It's usually around like 1200 within a few days we get to 2000.

[38:53] We normally sort of peak at around 24 hundred people listened to every episode 24 hundred

[39:01] people around the world tune in and enjoy this show.

[39:05] And that's why I do it because somewhere out there someone actually enjoys canate his

[39:09] pinball podcast.

[39:10] It might not be the popular show to say on Pinside.

[39:14] It might not be, you know, we need to get some merchandise so you guys can promote it.

[39:18] But I hope you guys also feel that this show has become more positive.

[39:22] We still don't hold back punches, but we're trying hard not to fall into the traps that

[39:28] did burn me out.

[39:30] And I'll tell you what does burn you out when you get too dramatic, when you start to

[39:34] attack too stridently, when you get to like, when you start to think that this stuff

[39:40] matters too much and you start to go to war against people or call people out in such

[39:44] negative ways.

[39:45] Yeah, I mean, I can be constructively criticizing someone for something, but I can do it in

[39:49] a way that doesn't make me feel like I spewed a ton of hate out in the world because it's

[39:54] just a pinball podcast.

[39:56] And you don't want pinball to be something that is negative and super depressing.

[40:01] And so that's the key.

[40:03] And we're all, you look, you'll learn.

[40:04] I mean, I think after 352 freaking episodes, we've learned a thing or two.

[40:09] We've gone through evolutions of this show and I'm really happy where we are right now.

[40:12] And I hope you enjoy the show.

[40:13] I hope you're happy with it.

[40:15] And you know, email me at canadapinballadgmail.com if you have any suggestions on how to make

[40:20] the show better.

[40:21] And there's a good chance I will take some of those into consideration, but there's

[40:24] also just a good chance this show will just keep doing what we're doing.

[40:28] All right, everyone, have a great day.

[40:30] Enjoy the Superman artwork.

[40:32] And let's see, we're moving towards deep root on June 1st.

[40:35] And I think you're really going to enjoy the interview with Jerry when he comes on.

[40:38] It's going to be one of the best ones, I think, because we're, I think we're going

[40:40] to have a come to Jesus conversation.

[40:42] I really do.

[40:43] I think neither one of us is going to like hold back.

[40:45] I think we're going to enjoy it.

[40:46] All right, everyone, have an awesome, awesome Tuesday later.
