[00:00] Well, there's still no word from Mr. Zach many on whether or not he can come on and

[01:56] buy your product until it's done. It's just so simple. Would you buy a car with three wheels?

[02:04] Would you buy a video game in which the final level isn't coded yet and yet people through

[02:09] money hand over fist and my final point is just this. And you know Zach has not said anything

[02:15] that he's like you're wrong on 26 different things. I'm like well name one thing I'm wrong on.

[02:19] I don't know. I haven't heard one thing from him. But here's a thing. If you pay this kind

[02:25] of money for these games they're not going to make the games better. They're going to feel like

[02:30] well we just did enough. I mean if all they do to charge $5,000 more it is a few hundred dollars

[02:37] in upgrades. Why would they ever approach the game differently and put more mechanical magic

[02:44] into these games. You're not you're going to keep getting products that have less and less. Now look

[02:48] I hear the stuff coming down the line from Stern is going to wow us. We always hear that. I look

[02:52] forward to it. I mean don't get me wrong. I love what Stern Pimbal does because without them the

[02:57] whole industry would collapse. We all know that Stern is like the Titanic. Everyone else is just a

[03:03] lifeboat on side you know on side inside the Titanic. If that thing goes down everyone's collapsing

[03:09] with it. All right. Let's air this interview. It's a little over an hour. I think you'll enjoy it.

[03:14] I think the black night brings a very interesting perspective to this hobby. So without further

[03:21] ado let's do this thing. It's been way too long. All right. Ladies and gentlemen it's been too

[03:26] long since we've had the black night Christopher Thompson on the show black night. Welcome back.

[03:33] Hey thank you very much. I appreciate the offer. I don't know if this is I can't remember that maybe

[03:40] this is like the six or seventh interview that we've had in there in your podcast lifetime that

[03:46] I'll give crudos to you and respect to you what I call staying the path. I've obviously met a lot

[03:53] of people over the years in the terms of this hobby and it was creative as it is and I have to say I

[04:00] would I'm pleasantly surprised that you are still going because a lot of people they don't you know

[04:06] they don't stick it out right they burn out. Well we're on episode like 400 and four or five right

[04:13] now. I haven't I haven't kept up I'll have to admit it so I've fallen behind with my listing you

[04:20] know with your show unfortunately. You could be stranded at this point on a desert island and

[04:26] listen to this show now for over a year and still not catch up. It's amazing. So you definitely

[04:33] you definitely hammer home quite a few episodes I get you know some of the feedback from some of

[04:39] my other you know pinball buddies per se but like I said kudos to you for staying the path because

[04:44] like I said a lot of people it's not that they just burn out it's just you know it's some people

[04:50] it's kind of a temporary you know hobby so kind of thing and then you seem to be you know around it

[04:56] for the long haul. So I'm gonna I'm gonna take this podcast to infinity and beyond so so Chris let's

[05:03] talk about let's start with a viral because I know that you're excited to see the new

[05:09] viral game and so what are your thoughts what what what if you see him on the game and how do you

[05:13] feel. Well I mean I initially obviously I did a little research before because I I took a

[05:20] little break here from pinball again and I was traveling and living abroad it likes I periodically do

[05:27] and you know I I'm a huge fan of Dennis Norgman and his designs I think he's one of the better

[05:35] designers in pinball history that even you know encapsulates like you know people will say Steve

[05:43] Richie is you know one of the greatest designers I think personally Dennis Norgman has better flow

[05:48] in his designs of his games overall then you know only person that can kind of touch him as Pat

[05:56] but after looking at all that material that I currently see on a viral free I'm kind of

[06:03] disappointed I'm gonna be honest with you I was hoping for more and I can tell you why. Oh yeah

[06:10] well I mean that's the the follow of question is what about it has you disappointed. Well initially

[06:17] some of the design elements looking at comparison to not only his games but of course games of the

[06:24] past is it does have a lot of similarities with scared stiff but but unfortunately it seems a little

[06:30] bit watered down yeah there are a lot of nifty little features and subways and stuff like that that

[06:36] you know Stern has an exclusively used in other games but you know the up the center shot with the

[06:43] house even though it does rotations and you know flip ups with you know figures and so on but a lot

[06:50] of it is still kind of a wash and repeat from some of your other games although I don't see it as

[06:58] being in a unique standout you know in comparison and I know you were kind of a fan for a while I

[07:05] totally enjoyed Willy Wonka I think they did a great job from the standpoint of gameplay flow

[07:13] when Pat lawyer did that game so I can say overall the package itself coupled I mean aren't

[07:20] work aside too which I wasn't particularly impressed overall on I think it did its job but it

[07:25] wasn't a standout it just didn't scream a virus from my perspective it doesn't just it doesn't show

[07:32] off what she's known for and if you if people that are a virus fans you know there's a tone that

[07:40] comes with her games and you they're you know unmistakable so when you play a virus in the party

[07:48] monsters or you play scared stiff it just emanates from the game and I don't get that same feeling

[07:55] right with a virus three so the the way they're doing the game it's sort of more of a journey through

[08:02] the the B movies that she used to host on the show absolutely do you feel there's too much of the

[08:08] movies and not not as much of her that you would like to see correct that that is that that is the

[08:14] that is the catch all and it hasn't to do with the the artwork per se it has to do with the tone

[08:20] it's like the the theme is there but it's not focused on the main character which is why

[08:27] Elvira was so successful in her original game and then they just accentuated that with scared

[08:35] stiff and the other thing is when you look at games like scared stiff and I'm not trying to be a

[08:40] Valley Williams snob from the 90s and try to say that you know new games can't be equal or

[08:47] terms of quality to older games which is clearly untrue because once again I was impressed with

[08:53] Willy Wonka I think he pulled a lot out with that there's too much of more simpler designs of the

[09:02] recent past from Stern and I wouldn't spend money on it I just want to...

[09:08] okay so I definitely want to talk about Willy Wonka in this show but let's stick on to

[09:16] a fire for a minute so when you say the game itself feels like you're seeing recycled stuff in

[09:22] the game like what do you mean by that like recycled stuff by Stern? Well yeah well I it reminds me when

[09:29] I when I see the shots from Stern it's guardians of the galaxy with the group shot up the middle

[09:36] I don't know why it is but you know the easiest design that you can do in pinball is to make some

[09:45] center shot a la medieval madness-esque type thing which focuses all your attention like you have

[09:54] on the house Elvira 3 and then do something with it where it rotates or something flips up or gates

[10:02] move or you know because like you say you know you think about the the flip up ramp design which

[10:09] of course was emanating all the way back from whirlwind I mean so once again when I see repeated

[10:17] features I'm kind of critical when it comes to pinball innovation because I've been

[10:23] it unfortunately extremely disappointed overall with pinball I don't think that it has moved

[10:30] particularly forward in regards I mean it's adopted obviously some new technology like you know

[10:36] modern LCD displays and and also some of the features in terms of coding and development and so on

[10:44] and so on but as far as actual designed features that are included within the game I haven't seen

[10:53] anything that's revolutionary and I was hoping that they might you know pull another rabbit out of

[11:00] their hat I mean I they companies have done a good job but this just doesn't it and I'm not saying

[11:06] it's a flop don't get me wrong I just but but let me ask your question because but Dennis Nordman

[11:12] design is not stern true but that doesn't he wants again I have no I it doesn't seem like based on

[11:19] the design that his hands were tied either so I I don't know why he went in the direction he did

[11:26] with with some of the repetition of features from stern yeah I don't know I like I said I don't know

[11:36] stern management had a part to play and kind of said hey we you know we you can't go completely

[11:42] crazy here this is what we're looking for in regards to use with the IP and adapt it accordingly

[11:49] I can't tell you that I haven't spoken to him personally in a long time right and I'm sure he

[11:55] would give a candidate opinion if he ever ends up getting an interview which would be a phenomenal

[12:00] interview for your show if you can get on me he's a very friendly guy yeah I mean I I asked

[12:05] him I'm sorry you know it's interesting because he's now exclusively with deep route but it was

[12:11] interesting to see him on the stream it's almost like he was on loan from deep route to be

[12:16] had stern for a day did you notice his demeanor I mean Dennis's demeanor is always a little bit

[12:23] sort of I always I this is what I told him on it's like reserve the certain points when it comes to

[12:31] the public I mean he you know he's private he's he's jovial but he's but he's still somewhat

[12:38] private and he doesn't you know he's he's not always basically going to give his you know fair

[12:43] shake pure opinion right for public consumption he's just not going to do that particularly when he's

[12:49] working for other companies because he's not stupid I mean he has whether the storm like many other

[12:56] designers who want work if you want to get paid and you want work that means you can't piss off

[13:04] your employer right so right but what was interesting about the stream was there's Dennis on kind

[13:12] of on loan from deep route to be at stern he's not going to tell us like what changes stern made to

[13:19] his design that he might not have been happy about even though it didn't feel like the same thing

[13:25] but he was usually more vocal in the past he just not so much right but it did feel like Dennis was a

[13:30] little bit disappointing a little bit yes he was in some and he's not that he saw them change exactly

[13:38] which is my once again I can't tell you to what extent stern did but I know that they influence

[13:44] the changes they change the ramps which are yep just these like straight like boring simpler designs

[13:52] that's the key right so let's talk about the price of this game because I I keep getting slammed by

[13:59] people for harping on this but this is also a a a super expensive pin uh you know if you want

[14:06] the le or the signature you're talking about like 9600 all the way up to 15,000 do you feel like

[14:13] when you see this stuff Chris that as long as people keep buying in to this arbitrary rarity game

[14:21] that's hilarious it's yeah like what are your thoughts on it all right well I remember I've watched

[14:27] the ebb and flow of costs you know of pinball for over 30 years now so I mean it it's pretty funny

[14:37] today because of course with the boutique world of the pinball that we are today I think a lot of

[14:42] hardcore collectors I I was telling somebody else today I haven't talked pinball really with anybody

[14:50] else in in significance for well over a year and I had somebody local that was asking me a bunch

[14:58] of questions because I'm actually looking at purchasing another Ted Zell zipper flipper pin that I

[15:03] didn't have somebody offered me a local opportunities which happened fairly frequently but a lot of

[15:10] times I you know pass because I don't need anymore games in my house or in storage and and I said well

[15:18] you know unfortunately I don't know it I don't want to get too deep in the weeds but I think it's

[15:30] it can be disappointing I don't know it maybe you want to rephrase the question well I guess the

[15:35] thing that you know I've been saying is luck it's if you're good if people are going to run in and

[15:41] hand 96 hundred or 15 grand without even seeing the game played it's it's really the root of

[15:50] why these companies won't give us more because they don't need to like while it's turn give you

[15:57] better rams and better mechs when you're gonna buy it anyway that the niche mark the thing is

[16:03] is at the size that we're currently in with pinball I think a lot of hardcore collectors

[16:09] sometimes make the the hobby out to be more than it truly is as it it's it's extremely

[16:16] mean by that the size of the number of collectors overall it's a it remains a very niche hobby

[16:24] and and as a result you know it's not that these companies are always purely catering to

[16:33] the rich you know older collector exactly they're just trying to sell a thousand units of a

[16:40] particular game of whatever price based on the IP licensing costs that came with it and then

[16:47] they move on and honestly I I can't possibly fathom in my opinion why anybody would buy a $15,000

[16:57] old viro 3 based on what I have seen with the design regardless of the art package and what's

[17:03] provided in regardless of how good the code might be in the future because there's just so many

[17:11] better games out there are particularly those that are used right I mean why would you buy a

[17:17] 15,000 of viro 3 when you can get a near perfect scared stiff or you know less well half half the

[17:26] price and it's a better solid game with with in the of viro universe do you think that this third game

[17:34] being made in 2019 right it's it is a little frustrating right you think like 20 just hurting

[17:40] I think it's 20 25 years later there's less in it and that's a common theme though that you look at

[17:48] based on any type of sequels that you see in pinball from stern not necessarily from Jersey jack or

[17:57] planetary pinball or american pinball and they can decide to make a game but I would I would argue

[18:03] there's less than the habit and there was even in lord the rings in terms of like mechanical magic

[18:09] I don't disagree with that but once again I sometimes it depends on how much effort and money

[18:16] they put into a specific area of the game you know and you know our work by nature it is not the

[18:24] most expensive obviously it's purely the ip fall based on the mechanical aspects of any type of

[18:30] design it's interesting the material costs of pinball even though they have gone up by probably

[18:38] about 40% or so in the last 20 years it still does not equate when you look at the pricing of the

[18:47] games it just doesn't I mean we're when you're talking of 15 thousand of dollar of viro it's basically

[18:54] double plus you know two and a half times the cost of its production two and a half times

[19:01] right right and people that can't figure that out or don't care fine but the inflationary

[19:08] factor of pinball is actually destructive at a certain point right because we all know that

[19:17] that 15 thousand dollar example was was never meant to actually reflect the price point

[19:25] they all they need it was 51 rich dudes who want it probably already have that right right I mean

[19:33] it's turned smart they understand that we have 50 of these that don't really have much in it

[19:39] over the li but all we need is like each of our distributors to call up their three riches buyers

[19:46] and be like hey I've got something for you and it works and it works yeah they're survivors

[19:51] Stern is is a survivor we already know that right I don't disagree no one is going to disagree

[19:57] that Stern was a survivor when it came to the pricing game and the belt and then industry now do

[20:02] think if you're Jersey Jack are you looking at this whole thing with being frustrated that you're

[20:07] trying to put much more in and you're watching these guys just like no I if I was if I was Jack I'd

[20:13] be Jack and I'd just be rolling my eyes just you know keep keep the path you know on from his standpoint

[20:20] keep the path of what he caters to within the boutique market and stay where he is in terms of

[20:28] the way he develops this games because that's what makes this game unique right but you have to

[20:34] have that standout we know what are they known for you know what you know what aspects do that

[20:41] wants a buyer to buy their games because once again if if if a company wants to survive they have

[20:48] to sell between well depending on how large they are of course based on their development cost but

[20:53] they have to sell at least 500 to a thousand games just to break even right and if they don't sell

[21:01] that that game is as a failure it's always historically been that way I can give you hundreds of

[21:07] examples right well let's talk about we haven't even talked about Willy Wonka now you brought it up

[21:13] a few times already so look how do you feel about that game I mean that game is well okay the initial

[21:21] coding of it was a week obviously the design aspects of it overall were butter smooth I think the

[21:28] shot flow was extremely good right I think the theme integration was extremely good I think they

[21:35] did a fair job at integrating like scenes from the movie versus the modes so it kind of made logical

[21:43] sense I think as a collectible game and also as a player game on a route I think it hit both markets

[21:53] now the number of games that they physically sell based on their cost is a different matter

[21:59] I can't tell you how successful ultimately it would be I don't think it's gonna unfortunately top

[22:06] wizard of boss at least not in the near future right I think it's because it's the theme abstract

[22:14] that causes a little bit of a distraction on that similar to what happened with the hobbit well I've

[22:22] been outspokenly critical of the assets in the game and I'm curious what your thoughts are because

[22:30] well it's a musical you don't really hear the songs being sung you don't really get the scenes

[22:36] the same way you know that's not the same what's the same right I think I think honestly that they did

[22:45] I can't type I can't put myself in the designer's head right now and say okay this is the

[22:51] direct way they want to go because there's kind of two lines of thought when it comes to the

[22:57] design of pinball machines and you might find this interesting from the store standpoint one is

[23:03] to tell the story method which you've talked about I think in the you know past podcasts of yours

[23:10] so they tell that developing story from part A to port B to Z and a pinball machine and you

[23:16] follow that story as a as the player that is the you know overwatching god figure to you know

[23:23] move forward that's one way to do a design of the game and the other one is the what I call the pure

[23:29] action method action movie method we'll call it the Arnold Swartz and a good method where you

[23:34] basically hit the player really hard with different modes and stuff that will excite somebody based

[23:40] on that pure adrenaline action thing and so it's quick it's fast and then it's over right right

[23:46] okay and the reason you do that is so you can connect with the player so they want to play it again

[23:51] which i.e goes back to the operational route of a game versus the story method which it fits better

[23:58] for the standpoint of the home market do you does that make sense no no it does and it's interesting

[24:04] because who would you say the market was for this game was it the home market or was it absolutely

[24:12] the home market was not the routes not to say that it wouldn't work because new is new and you know

[24:19] for example in Portland which remains the number one pinball capital world regardless of anybody

[24:24] else's opinion sorry it is when you're talking over a thousand games in a 25 square mile area

[24:31] that's a lot of games okay and they're that's all routed that isn't even count private collectors

[24:37] so you know they brought out of course a handful of willy wonkers out here and they did pretty well

[24:43] but in comparison to what they were designed for in jersey jack and hold because remember his

[24:49] complexity of his games causes problems with operators wizard of laws is a great example it was

[24:57] very complex and it caused the game was always down unless it was in a location which it could be

[25:03] monitored it had problems right but but when pat lawler was interviewed about the design of the

[25:12] game he talked specifically about short ball times for operators and how he wanted it to be

[25:18] yeah well that's what he wanted because he wanted to bring he's always been an advocate of

[25:23] bringing pinball to the masses to try to bring it back into its happy mode you know it's it the

[25:29] golden age and that's been his you know theme personally in regards to development for the

[25:36] industry for over 20 years but that doesn't make it reality right so is he but is he missed

[25:41] guided then and who he's no I think his I think his methodology is fine but regardless of whether or

[25:48] not what he wants it doesn't mean that's what the industry and what the development of where it is

[25:52] today because it doesn't work right you want a cater to the home market obviously more than 50%

[25:58] of the time because you don't have a bunch of Portland organs out here with thousands of games

[26:05] that you can pump quarters into right now we yeah no I mean it look it's it makes sense I do think that

[26:15] you know where jack struggles a little bit it is when it comes to the collectibility side right because

[26:21] he says we're gonna make five thousand LEs right right that's not limited on on any level no he's

[26:29] he had just asked once again he asked to sell X number of games he'll do it anyway

[26:33] and cans even if it's artificial right do you think stern does a better job at creating a hype and

[26:39] getting those limited games into homes before people even like see the game well I think in general

[26:45] that that stern does one thing that's the that's the standout what sets the precedence which is

[26:52] rapidity of production okay because when it comes to pinball if you want to if you want to you know

[27:00] you know connect on the hype and and profit from it that means you got to get the games out the door

[27:07] as absolutely fast as possible in order to get those dollars because you I mean they'll I hate

[27:14] to say it but the hype lead time on a pinball machine is usually less than three months after three

[27:19] months of the game being released regardless of what games are behind it in development or from

[27:26] other companies or based on what's available in the surrounding period at the same time that's

[27:32] what you have and once you pass that quarter you know that quarter season within that year your

[27:38] sales will just drop like a rock into a pool right so you have to do it quickly and you have to

[27:45] do it fast which of course leads into some quality control issues at time which I think was another

[27:51] one of your questions so let me ask your question if I gave you a million dollars Chris and I said

[27:57] pick the pinball company you want to invest with for a return who who you investing in I don't know

[28:04] what I would but what I'd be wrong if I said deep root and see what happens I mean well they're

[28:12] spending millions we're going to talk about them in a little bit but if you had a pick between

[28:15] Stern and Jersey Jack is it is it a tough decision oh can I reinvest in highway pinball and bring

[28:21] it back to the dead oh my god get on the hydroxpile right now like well my result just give it to

[28:26] the Dutch pinball right it's actually I wouldn't invest in either one of those you know who I would

[28:31] invest in who Rick Bartlett with planetary pinball oh my god because honestly based on the

[28:41] availability of license and IP so he has he can make as many or as few games as wanting will always

[28:48] make profit so it's planetary pinball but that's not Chicago is that CGC or no is that a separate

[28:54] that is planetary pinball is the licensey IP owner Chicago EGC is the is the production okay but

[29:06] but it's all the same unit no negative okay planetary pinball and CGC are not one and the same

[29:17] they are connected based on general mutual interests everything that planetary pinball does is then

[29:26] basically sent as the production facility of CGC after the design and everything is completed

[29:33] okay basically they send them the order and say this is we want you to build because they're

[29:41] experienced in building more than just pinball machines CGC obviously if you're anybody that's

[29:46] familiar is an operator will know that they sell other types of arcade equipment as well so

[29:52] you know they are not pinball they are arcade coin op okay planetary pinball is pinball only

[30:02] they're the in-house though they they're the ones that figure out how they're gonna which game

[30:06] they're gonna buy or sorry which game they're gonna build how they're gonna design it what they're

[30:11] gonna use right technology industry and so on and then they move forward to CGC how do you feel

[30:18] about the remakes well once again a remake is a remake an original was original I asked the question

[30:28] to somebody else today I said would you rather own an original Ford Mustang or would you want a

[30:34] remake Ford Mustang basically one probably that has fuel injection and the other that has a carburetor

[30:42] okay right answer is if it's just to drive the damn car it doesn't matter right but are you

[30:53] impressed by the the screen and the new dots and all the new lights and everything no no that's

[31:00] not what I'm impressed with what I'm impressed with is their ability to take the IP and create

[31:06] create the game so the gameplay is nearly identical to the original game with new technology which

[31:16] I don't have a problem with as long as people recognize that it isn't an original game back in

[31:23] your early 2000s I'm gonna tell you a little quick story that that your listeners will enjoy okay

[31:28] now you may be aware that over the past history and pinball there have been people that have taken

[31:35] games and built their own pinball machines we're not talking about home bros we're talking about

[31:41] pre-creating a Valley Williams pinball game so you know what I'm talking about right right okay

[31:49] medieval manaces has been built attack from Mars has have been built and monster bashes have

[31:54] actually been built at a time when unavailability was you know unavailable because each one of those

[32:02] games had low production values well back in the early 2000s I had an offer to buy a monster

[32:09] bash and the guy wanted about five thousand dollars this is back in like two thousand and two so

[32:16] that that was pretty high and this thing looked really cherry and I said well where did you get it

[32:21] I just did it come out of a box you know box he says no I got it from another collector that had

[32:26] it you know back in the early Valley Williams days I said sure let me go take a look at it so

[32:32] in order to his house and lo and behold it was a fraud was actually somebody that had built one

[32:38] out of spare parts which was unheard of back then that's a lot of part that's a lot of spare parts

[32:45] though how do you oh my god it was almost impossible back then you couldn't get the spare parts the

[32:50] person it had built it did an amazing job at hoarding parts and it built it out of another cabinet

[32:56] which was unheard of back then people didn't had done that yeah that's like better than new though you

[33:01] had like was better than new unfortunately it was not a Valley Williams game the serial number it

[33:08] serial numbers were bogus it didn't have the licensee on it so I said look no matter what you

[33:14] paid for it no matter how nice it is it's still not an original game so if that's important to you

[33:21] as a collector then you can't buy those kind of things who's Chris do you think your most

[33:28] modern collectors do you think most modern collectors care about that some some do some don't I do

[33:37] right but you're you you come from the old school right you might perfect but I don't have a

[33:42] problem with remix I'll play them all day long I thought about buying them on Star bash I thought

[33:46] about buying an attack from Mars why because all things aside I'm not trying to fake that it's

[33:52] an original game I just enjoyed that it was a new game that's all right yeah well it's again as

[33:58] long as you're buying it for the right reason but never try to I've seen people that have tried to

[34:03] pass off remix as original games which is not true if you're looking for the licensee and the

[34:09] proper thing as a collector it makes a difference that's all all right so since you you you know this

[34:16] hobby for many many years and a topic that we we've been covering recently on the show is

[34:23] the clear coat issues yeah you're talking about the puddling and stuff like that the pooling the

[34:28] puddling the cracking the the you know the post that are sort of sinking into the into the clear

[34:34] coat what what are your thoughts on this whole thing I mean you've seen games for decades now like

[34:39] what what's happening well I watched changes of industry and how they've applied clear coats because

[34:45] we're talking about all the way back starting from around 1989 1990 just around fun house period

[34:52] and here's the here's the bottom line when it comes to clear coats one the clear coating process that

[35:00] is used today and the materials are not the same they the EPA back in the early 2000s went

[35:10] batshit crazy with using people that use the solvent methods that weren't water based okay which is

[35:16] predominantly what they're used today the other factor that is causing problems with modern games is

[35:23] the speed at to which they are being produced once again we talked about how it's important

[35:28] to get the games built and out the door as fast as possible the days of prepping the playfields

[35:35] and having them cure for more than 60 to 90 days is over so what's happening is these water based

[35:43] clear coats which are not as quite as durable coupled with the fact that owners have been

[35:52] were complaining that they wanted shinier clear coats you know that that they can see that are like

[35:58] glass resulted of course in thicker clear coats that were required to be applied so coupled with

[36:06] that along with this fact that the cure times for the clear coats are normally less than 30 days

[36:13] before the installation of the actual playfield into a game has resulted in softer clear coats

[36:22] that are obviously eat more easily dimpled sometimes have imperfections because there's not

[36:30] that they're cutting corners it's the fact that they are being forced to make those choices

[36:38] to move forward to get the game going versus just putting the playfields on a rack to dry for

[36:44] more than two to three months which they sometimes can't afford to do now I think other companies

[36:50] can do that and I think if you will remember many many many many years ago when I did the interview

[36:56] about Big Bang Bar I talked about Jean cutting him and what he did for his Big Bang Bar playfields

[37:03] that got fucked up and he took them back had them resanded and reapplied them again which you

[37:10] would never see today which of course added to the cost and overall loss of what he did anyway

[37:16] but the point I'm making is that these choices that are being made in industry have resulted in

[37:23] the end product being the way it is today so are our current customers buying games with what you

[37:32] believe are playfields that are far less superior than they used to. They're inferior. They're

[37:40] inferior wood because the wood is younger when it is cut and put into blanks.

[37:47] inferior clear coats do the fact that they're water-based versus solvent-based in proper length

[37:54] of curing times if I was a new collector the only solution you can have to improve matters

[38:03] barring the fact that the EPA is not going to live sub of their sanctions based on materials use

[38:08] is to simply not buy the games until they fix the shift right and they have played this game with

[38:15] with Stern and all the companies for years but you know what every company has problems to a certain

[38:21] extent so what's the fix if you're the if you're these guys and you got to get the games out the door

[38:26] and you've got you know you got people throwing $15,000 you wait too long you lose the sale

[38:33] what's what's the solution solution for the who the buyer or the solution for the for the

[38:39] manufacturer so clearly we're seeing on the part of the customer that they don't even they're

[38:47] not even demanding a fix and they they went all in on their accepting that that's that that

[38:53] level of acceptance that was in intolerated in the past operators when the when games were

[39:00] predominantly targeted to operators there was a certain what a certain threshold of what I

[39:06] considered to be acceptability in terms of game design and durability but operators are more

[39:12] concerned about making sure the game continued to work in terms of its durability than its physical

[39:18] cosmetic aspects now the interesting thing is when you look at the home market it's completely opposite

[39:23] right so it my recommendation to private owners is don't don't rush to be buying the next new game let

[39:33] it you have to let things settle a little bit I'm not saying wait until it goes on close out

[39:39] that's the opposite complete opposite but the the the problem that we face right now as I

[39:45] guess said is there's a certain measure of acceptance in regards to manufacturers of cutting

[39:49] corners based on time and the new buyers simply accept it right but I know but but also what

[39:57] do you say to you know Jersey Jack saw this problem happening on pirates the Caribbean and and it

[40:04] wasn't solved by the time will you walk away on the line do you also feel there's some responsibility

[40:09] by these manufacturers absolutely if you have examples that are if if a game is shipped with an

[40:17] inferior play field that has significant flaws the ought to the manufacturer has an obligation to

[40:24] replace it but how do they how do they afford that right if you've a thousand they have to eat the

[40:30] cost just like they did when the manufacturers were servicing for operators if something was

[40:36] dicked up that bad balian Williams ate the cost they didn't like to but they accepted the

[40:43] responsibility now granted the differences as they were selling more or games but you can't

[40:50] abdicate your responsibility because you decide to send a substandard play field with a game that's

[40:57] stupid so do you Chris do you think that sending someone an unpopulated play field oh that's not

[41:04] gonna work you know that but that's what they're doing so yeah well the thing is that's that's

[41:08] like somebody that's trying to you know it's like I'm trying to think it's compared to like the

[41:13] video game technology it's like somebody trying to give them virtual dollars or some stupid shit

[41:18] I mean nobody in their right mind I mean I'm talking about it from a standpoint of a guy that

[41:24] restores games you know the amount of work it takes to read you know to do a play field swap is

[41:32] not something the average homeowner collector today is capable of doing it's not even it's not

[41:40] even what most pinball techs can do yeah that's that one true and the biggest problem today is once

[41:47] again do the short cutting of the way that they do wiring everything it is these modular nature makes

[41:55] it actually harder to do swaps with modern games that I did but the early saw the state or late

[42:01] model cells right so I saw I had been telling people that I wouldn't buy anything until we actually

[42:10] got some official confirmation from manufacturers on what a what the problem was be what the solution

[42:17] would be moving forward we're not going to it sounds like we're not going to get it from anybody

[42:21] I know if I was if I was a person it was a hardcore collector buying new games on a regular basis

[42:28] I sure as shit you better have some operator friends because they can give you the inside poop

[42:34] of what issues are going on they will know and that way you don't have to eat costs when you get

[42:41] a lemon like it like it's like buying a car would you buy a new car without doing any research

[42:50] I guess some people do but I don't do that either does it frustrate you to see

[42:56] what we just saw with Elvira and how fast it sold without

[43:00] well it used to but now it doesn't bother me at all because remember I don't deal with drama so

[43:05] I just stepped out of the pinball which would you say it's it's to your benefit and you're to be

[43:12] happier in the pinball hobby is to sort of remove yourself from the new inbox sort of frenzy

[43:18] absolutely actually the once you get off that that train and stop worrying about trying to hoard

[43:27] those new inbox games in your house in your closet because you want to afford your child's

[43:34] college education with the benefits of the investment or some stupid shit like that which I've

[43:40] heard over various times in the last 30 years you're a much happier person because once again

[43:47] you're doing it for the right reasons you're in it for the enjoyment of the hobby now the you're

[43:53] more worried about things when you run out of space versus running out of money right and and

[43:59] honestly you know it's like where I am today I haven't bought any games in probably about a year or so

[44:06] and and the reason being is I'm absolutely happy at this point in my life I've owned pretty much

[44:12] every game I've ever wanted so why why get in you know yeah no in the last two years though what

[44:19] do you think is the best game in the last two years oh come on that's a I mean what the best

[44:24] selling or the no new game at the last couple of years we've caught me off guard I'm not actually

[44:31] sure all right well give me a bunch of auction all right we got monsters we've got Star Wars

[44:37] we've got Batman 66 hell no we got Guardians of the Galaxy off the plate got Iron Maiden you got

[44:45] dead okay all right now I wouldn't say it would be number one per se but it was definitely up there

[44:52] take care of the game not unfortunately absolutely not Willie Wonka I like I mean personally I mean

[45:01] you know dialed in was kind of a you know in terms of the overall collector

[45:07] opportunities I think as a game it had a lot of potential that was unfortunately kind of hit or

[45:15] miss at certain points even though the technology and the development of the gameplay was solid

[45:20] I think probably the the last the top four probably were Iron Maiden taking an original design from

[45:28] a you know a personal private you know homebrew theme and turning into a real game which which

[45:34] worked and was well integrated artwork package sound theme you know the whole night right and that's

[45:42] one I think Willie Wonka hit the nail ahead with integration the theme overall even though there

[45:47] were some weaknesses in code I think dialed in hit the nail and head with gameplay but unfortunately

[45:53] was abstract in the steam which didn't count and well I mean I'm not going to count any remakes

[46:00] because remakes are remakes right you know you can't remember that that's not an original game so

[46:05] you really can't put it in the same level pool and there was one other game I'm trying to think in the

[46:10] last Iron Maiden dead dead pool no no no no no no team pinball is the mafia or some

[46:21] coast pinballs yeah they would have like seven games or something yeah well Chris let me ask you

[46:28] question so deep route the five days of deep route right been delayed by a year knowing the

[46:37] landscape right now what do you think their opportunity is to come in now have they waited too long

[46:44] no they're they've been biting their time accordingly they'll they'll jump into the market when

[46:49] they feel the time is right they have that flexibility from even though they're they're going to

[46:54] spend continue to spend oodles and oodles of money you know keeping people on and doing a

[47:00] development cycle and so on and so on but they've got the pockets because that's why they're called

[47:05] deep route and they will hit the they will hit the market when they feel the timing is right if

[47:12] if there's kind of a desert and and they need to become the oasis they will do so

[47:19] so wouldn't the right time to hit it be when everyone is kind of anxious about quality control

[47:26] issues with the major manufacturers that is a consideration the other one that they they

[47:32] would do is if there's a law in game development or release cycles but there never is one now it feels

[47:38] doesn't seem like it that's absolutely true because Stern has to keep the engine running

[47:45] I think overall I think that it said they will position themselves based on what they know based

[47:50] on release dates of games and then they will try to capitalize when the opportunity arises but they

[47:58] know that that first title that they develop for release or sorry when they release that say okay

[48:05] it's you know it's it's here it's coming out they got to do well because that will make and

[48:11] define themselves for the future that's the way it works today right and in in in terms of what

[48:17] you're looking for from them are you what what what are the things you hope to see from deeper

[48:22] they're looking I'm looking for them to take a theme we're gonna ever choice I mean I'm not

[48:27] whatever the speculation based things that have changed based on choices or I'm not going to get

[48:32] into I am looking for them to be two things one break them old and have some form of innovation

[48:41] that has not been seen in pinball before that's number one two make sure that the games are

[48:49] remain a more affordable in comparison to where the the industry has gone in the last five years

[48:59] right they should be cheaper somehow but how can you do both how can you innovate and go cheaper

[49:05] oh the innovation and cost from that stand that being innovative and creative doesn't mean excessive

[49:12] cost no no they don't they're not they're not one in the same it's the amount of features may

[49:21] increase a cost of a game but not innovation being creative right absolutely but isn't it isn't

[49:27] but Chris isn't it unfortunate that where the where the price currently is with these games

[49:34] and the lack of features like doesn't that make it hard for a company like deeproot because they're

[49:39] like wait a minute like Stern's bomb is probably around three thousand dollars and there's selling

[49:45] these things from the nine grand once again they they I don't know what their their comparison of

[49:53] their production costs will be in comparison to Stern based on their facilities that they were

[49:59] you developing I don't know but I know if they if they can keep a machine that costs in the same

[50:05] realm as a Stern pro but have more features and make it full featured than they've got a winner

[50:12] but then isn't the challenge this so if you do that like let's say deeproot has like fully featured

[50:17] games for five to six thousand right which is a fair price well I mean that's what the remakes go for

[50:23] but there's no appeal to the collector well why would it not have any appeal to the collector if

[50:29] it was fully featured at a price that was fair because if we look at what collectors want

[50:35] and they want limited edition right one limited like oh shit you know they're so

[50:40] shit there there are plenty of collectors out there did not go for the limited edition

[50:46] tack from Mars remake but I think the limited edition has buyers standard edition I guess I guess

[50:52] it's an interesting debate are those collectors are just buyers of new inbox are you

[50:58] collector if you just buy a new inbox for your home well everybody I that question came up recently

[51:03] by somebody else today what qual quantifies a pinball collector you asked me that question

[51:08] the first interview we had like four years ago the answer is if you own a game you're a collector

[51:15] are you but I feel like a collector a collector wants something I don't know because I like

[51:20] okay so let me not in a pure sense I mean not in the hard courses but there's a reason why Jersey

[51:26] Jack calls his most expensive game the collectors edition well firstly does it's hype

[51:35] you think he's gonna sell do you think he waited too long to sell 500 Willy Wonka

[51:40] collectors editions at 12 five once again the for when it comes to games as long as you're

[51:45] prepared to produce them which is the key word it the first people that should get their games

[51:51] in my opinion for any company even though I know this doesn't apply for stern because they're

[51:56] still trying to provide games for operators is it should go to the collectors they're the ones

[52:02] they should get their games first they're the ones that should get their special if you're going

[52:06] to make a small number run those people get their games first and then the rest that's the priority

[52:12] of you getting to the front of the line right now that's not necessarily what happens because once

[52:16] again stern doesn't do that but they do it for a smart reason they're trying to get the bugs out

[52:22] of their freaking game yeah but the time they get the collectors edition they don't piss off the

[52:27] high-end buyer no but stern does it smart so stern does pro and then Ellie immediately so

[52:33] exact and there's a reason for that because usually the game isn't ready to fucking be built

[52:39] or is completed right right are there okay so right now are you just 100% on the sidelines no new

[52:50] inbox purchases if no there are some exceptions what what what are the exceptions the only there's

[52:58] only two exceptions to the pinball rule which would allow me to get into buying a new inbox game other

[53:03] than what I mentioned with the remakes of either attack from ours or monster bash which by the way

[53:09] I would only be buying the standard edition because I don't feel the other ones are necessary that's

[53:14] not why I'm buying the game I don't need the big screen or the fancy topper and that is if

[53:20] planetary pinball and cgc brought out big bang bar I would buy one it's happening they already

[53:25] announced they're gonna do it well I I haven't seen the game yet so until I see it in a box I'm not

[53:33] saying it's gonna have it what about that so that game out of all the titles they mentioned

[53:38] theater of magic they've mentioned yep oh bunch of them but you all know that's probably going to

[53:44] be cactus canyon that they're gonna produce next so I'm not interested in that why not because I

[53:50] so an overhyped game anybody that's played the original and or the remade code with cactus canyon

[53:57] expanded knows that the game design was weak that the layout was weak or the code it would overall

[54:04] I need the game itself was kind of lackluster didn't hit the nail on head with all the features

[54:09] and not that it was a bad bad game but it reminds me a lot in some ways of what I consider to be

[54:15] a theater of magic oh so you don't have a lot it's got a lot of pizzazz but it doesn't have a lot

[54:20] of good depth in my opinion that's why they had cactus canyon expanded to try to fix not just the

[54:26] bugs but the finish the game because the code was uncomplete but people would argue yeah I mean the

[54:31] code is obviously incomplete because it didn't just stop I mean you literally got to a point you

[54:36] couldn't play anymore right but but imagine lineman sheets are like Keith coding theater of magic like

[54:44] is because that's always what I'm advocating for like lots of mex and toys but with deep code that

[54:50] makes you want to own the game for a long time well that that's the challenge you have to make a

[54:56] game medieval manus is the best example that you have to make a game that is approachable to the

[55:01] easy simple to player that wants to bat the ball around and then you got a tailor fitted to a

[55:06] player that wants to come back and try to beat it that's the challenge when it's it's it's it's a

[55:13] balancing it's tough it's not you need some of it's got out do you get bored once you beat a game

[55:18] nope because that's the reason why I still have pinball machines in my house after 30 years

[55:23] why would I if that was the case and I beat a game like you know somebody that plays a video game

[55:29] today for trophies then I guess I would sell all my games the answer is every game if it's good

[55:36] enough will keep you coming back for just one more game even if it's just periodic right that's

[55:43] that's the hallmark of a good design Chris right how much longer you think this hobby has with

[55:50] all these companies do you think it's going to consolidate next year or do you think no I think

[55:54] it's going to be under on for about the next five to ten years based on the current market because

[56:00] it's still strong and then eventually it will peter out within you know 20 years were still I

[56:06] still believe that the world of pinball will be pretty much dead I think it'll be relegated and

[56:11] most of us along with it well maybe not necessarily but I do I kind of chuckle because like in my

[56:18] area for example there's only about a half a dozen people who like really know how to fix EMS

[56:24] now I'm taught not and I'm talking in the Portland region not Seattle and ever the parts of the

[56:29] United States but you know it in 20 years all of us will be dead so who's going to take care of

[56:34] these games you know in the same thing applies to you know all pinball in general I think any game

[56:40] that's you know more than 20 years old it has definitely started the show it's age right and you

[56:47] know that's only going to get worse with the fact that most of the modern games that are developed and

[56:53] released today are throw away disposable technology right so you know where worse pinball going to be

[57:02] I think it's going to be pretty much relegated to people's basements and it's a nice thought but

[57:09] you know the rest of the world doesn't revolve around areas like Portland right right too many

[57:15] orchids and so on so were you surprised to see Dutch pinball back again yes I was I thought that

[57:22] they had left for good I thought that the whole AMA thing was pretty shocking that they managed to

[57:29] they are well we all know why they did what they did you know they were they had debts to pay

[57:37] and they needed to figure out another scheme but maybe get their ass out of jail per se based

[57:44] on the litigation of their you know criminal proceedings of not paying their bills so I think that

[57:53] it was wrong for them to sell the last what 40 games to people basically that had the money

[58:00] I was one of them yeah well I knew that you were interested but I didn't think you would actually

[58:05] receive had you received the game or you just put your money down no I got I got it I don't know

[58:10] it's at it's at coin taker right now okay do you know what you're going to do like what like the

[58:16] I don't know they're going to hide it in their box for the next 20 years yeah I you know I'm still

[58:21] trying to figure out what to do with it I had a plan that I'm still considering I'll more to

[58:28] come on that more people are thinking here's the thing to think about with that if you fall into

[58:33] the collector trap of saying why I I can't afford to take it out of the box because then it will

[58:39] lose its value then you have you've not got off the hype of the new inbox train

[58:47] yet people people that don't open games and play that's why games were designed to be built and

[58:53] they're they're they're supposed to be played absolutely I dropped a lot I played my games I

[58:58] drive my cars I sleep with my women you know it's like that's how you're supposed to live life so

[59:04] I you know my whole thing is this it's it's just that you know I'm just I only have room for two

[59:10] pinball machines at most absolutely and that that makes it tricky I get it yeah so I mean like and

[59:16] I also said this I'm not flipping this game for a profit I I think that's despicable I think it's

[59:22] wrong it's wrong like this this this game was stolen from somebody there there's no way around that

[59:30] and I also think Barry we're not an early achiever but you became one with money right

[59:38] well when I when I hear Barry's newsletter you get a rug by the way yeah get a rug

[59:42] check Barry do you think they're gonna pull this off though this like Ponzi scheme like economic

[59:48] plan to get the years I don't think it's a what's not a Ponzi scheme it's just an outright

[59:53] what I consider to be a black hand method of making some extra money to try to you know offset

[01:00:01] some of their expenses and where they're standing in their life today I don't think they're making

[01:00:06] anybody whole or right they're not gonna make any more friends based on their choices I mean

[01:00:13] they're clearly not gonna be making any future games if they are people are absolutely

[01:00:19] retarded stupid to get involved with them but yeah you know what but but that's all

[01:00:26] known exactly what he's saying he's he's locked out of swim but he's saying he's gonna try to make

[01:00:33] four to five hundred more at twelve five and then if he can do that he will get how I mean how

[01:00:39] I mean I mean I'm look that is the where's the money LeBaski here we go again but but he can't

[01:00:46] he can't do it with any he does not going to have any measure of profit enough to reinvest to

[01:00:52] make any more new games and any I wouldn't get involved with this guy with a contract with a

[01:00:57] ten foot pole I mean we all know it was people that got involved initially early if you go way back

[01:01:04] to when this whole stupidity started we're talking about when they originally promised

[01:01:09] 2004 right way back I mean we're talking way back you know people sorry 2014 I yeah it was

[01:01:17] it was a different time people were more trustworthy of new opportunities of Boatee companies were

[01:01:24] today they're a little more skittish but if people don't want to learn the lessons of history

[01:01:29] because we know that history doesn't necessarily repeat itself but it rhymes a la Samuel Clements

[01:01:36] Mark Twain fine lose your money a second time right right well look no one's going to pre-order

[01:01:45] or give him money I guess the question is can he line up an investor for the company because he

[01:01:52] can show people there is demand for this game but I mean it's a couple million bucks he's going to

[01:01:58] need I don't know who in Europe that's a pinball fanatic that wants to invest millions of dollars

[01:02:05] to him like equivalency of Jack and Ari but if see find somebody that's foolish enough to be

[01:02:10] willing to throw away their capital based on this development of this or redevelopment of this

[01:02:16] game great but it wouldn't be me right I mean anybody that if you're doing it from pure profit

[01:02:24] standpoint and you're an investor that that would be incredibly stupid because you're looking at it

[01:02:29] from a niche industry anyway and it just doesn't profitable right we all know how hard it is to

[01:02:35] develop and and release games on a regular schedule and make money from it anyway absolutely that's

[01:02:43] why we talk about pinball on your show that's why there's drama okay because it's difficult yeah no

[01:02:51] I you know people always ask me like how do you do 400 episodes I might just follow this hobby

[01:02:56] from up and you understand people develop their own drama they don't they doesn't require any effort

[01:03:02] no no well Chris what what advice would you give people now in 2019 that are into this hobby

[01:03:11] I would look to the past and enjoy pinball for what it is based on where it has come from

[01:03:18] with games that are more reasonable and stop looking at new titles if you want to play new titles

[01:03:25] go to the arcades find some place hopefully contact if you've got a local operators you might be

[01:03:31] surprised you find out that some local operator actually does operate a few pinball machines and you

[01:03:37] can try them out that way or go find other collectors and go to their houses and enjoy their games

[01:03:43] because the amount of money that that people can spend on this hobby is absurd and I'm talking about

[01:03:50] it from a guy that's probably spent over half a million dollars in 30 years on pinball machines

[01:03:56] okay so I'm not a hypocrite I'm trying to give credence and credibility from the standpoint of

[01:04:03] don't make I'm not I didn't make any necessary mistakes because we're talking about you know hundreds

[01:04:09] of games not 30 games right do you think do you think the games today in your honest opinion are as

[01:04:19] good as they were in the bali Williams days no because they're not as durable they're not as

[01:04:26] the one thing is that durability of pinball isn't there I think that the the themes and their

[01:04:33] integration is not as long lasting with a few exceptions I think overall I just as I call it the

[01:04:41] memorable factor games just simply aren't as memorable as they are from the past were because

[01:04:47] anybody that that why do people play pinball nostalgia that's why they do it it's a nostalgic thing

[01:04:55] so when you talk to somebody that has actually played pinball which of course today is becoming more

[01:05:00] and more rare they're going to repeat and say why remember x game when I was a kid well today you

[01:05:08] don't get that same feeling so if that's the case then it's a pretty logical step in terms of

[01:05:16] looking at it that clearly the games aren't as good as they were from the past right it just aren't

[01:05:23] when when you see the trunk in alvira open up the new game that's not how a trunk opens up nope

[01:05:31] what is with that well simply put that was the design limitation based on the way that they

[01:05:38] ended up having the implemented in order for the mechanism to physically work I haven't seen

[01:05:43] anyone talk about that a trunk opens up like the way it does or the way it should have it reminded me

[01:05:49] of pinball magic but pinball magic's trunk didn't actually open it just the ball fell into it you

[01:05:55] know it just you know you went into was have a trail that just kind of fed it into the trunk so the ball

[01:06:00] disappeared but once again it I'm not here to be overly critical I didn't like said you heard my

[01:06:08] pin on alvira I didn't particularly I thought it was disappointing only because of what they could

[01:06:12] have done and what they ended up doing did they show it to early like why they show it no I think

[01:06:18] that they showed it at the right time based on what they had available because they were at that

[01:06:23] threshold where what you talked about earlier they say we've got to we've got it make height we've

[01:06:28] got to get ready to make sales we've got to do this we just came out why did they have to get it

[01:06:34] on the line so quickly with code so incomplete because once again stern realizes that the hype

[01:06:40] train is so damn short right that in fact it's gotten shorter not better over the last five years

[01:06:48] because of the number of games now unfortunately it's some of it of a perpetual cycle that was caused

[01:06:53] by stirring themself the more games that they develop on a short cycle increased or sorry decrease

[01:07:00] the hype train time which then required them to to continue to accelerate to build more games

[01:07:06] even faster it actually hurt them right but they're like I said but but the money is going to them

[01:07:15] right they're cannibalizing the hype of another game but the money still heading into Stern's bank

[01:07:24] was long as they keep a threshold what they call the threshold of minimum production numbers going

[01:07:29] they don't care right just remember the caveat though for all those wonderful new collectors like

[01:07:36] the buy new games is remember Stern's policy when it comes to spare parts five years or less

[01:07:43] do you like Stern Pimball I have nothing I have no problems with Stern I just don't like spike

[01:07:50] and you know because it's because it's disposable technology right that made

[01:07:56] regardless of whatever they want to say regardless of whether or not they've actually started

[01:08:01] to release schematics and stuff even though it took five years okay it's disposable technology

[01:08:07] and many of the node boards and parts are unrepairable I don't care what people say if you have

[01:08:12] a hot air station and the proper experience in order to do the solder work doesn't matter it's still

[01:08:18] throw away technology ask any operator they're not going to sit down on the work bench and fix the

[01:08:24] if you send it back to Stern they don't fix the boards either they just toss them

[01:08:30] because they cost like 20 30 bucks and then they charge you 150 which is five times the amount

[01:08:35] for the same board do you think like for what people pay they just get like a backup set with

[01:08:40] they have to if you want to keep that game for more than 10 years you sure as shit should be

[01:08:46] weren't buying spare parts for that game and most people are not no because they don't play in the

[01:08:52] keep it for they don't think about it from the no like it's goes back to what we said are they

[01:08:57] a collector that's thinking about that they're going to keep this game for 20 20 years later of

[01:09:01] course not because the collectors today that have been involved most of them been in the hobby for

[01:09:06] more than five to 10 years right so why would they worry about that shit they just their

[01:09:11] philosophy is once I get bored of the game I'm just going to freaking sell it right as long as I can

[01:09:17] get rid of it but they're not prepared because they don't know how to repair it even if they could

[01:09:21] repair it based on the technology they wouldn't because they have no experience or intuition or

[01:09:28] drive to do so right so why would they do it Chris again they're catering to Stern is catering

[01:09:37] to the current collector they're not catering to a person like me that says hmm let me think

[01:09:41] about this logically can I fix the game if it goes down while they're very they're very smart

[01:09:48] they understand they have absolutely I'm not going to criticize them because they know their market

[01:09:53] no they know they know how to make games I believe they don't look out of all the companies out

[01:09:59] there though Stern games in the present day are the most reliable the most they are immediately

[01:10:05] fun and by far the best themes in Pimble and they know what they're doing and and I mechanically

[01:10:13] I think the game's leave a lot to be desired which was purposeful remember because they do the design

[01:10:20] of the game their number one philosophy when they started to make pinball in 2001 was make well

[01:10:27] the original philosophy was make a game that was affordable for operators that was easy to maintain

[01:10:32] and was simple to operate right now since that time it hasn't quite you know stayed that path but

[01:10:41] their philosophy of trying to make mechanisms and I mean I can think of some design mechanisms

[01:10:49] in pinball that are incredibly complicated and had to be extremely precise when they were

[01:10:56] machined a good example I'm just to throw it out for the masses for those that may or may not

[01:11:01] have played it that isn't from the necessarily modern solid state era is ballies nip it

[01:11:08] with the balagator the assembly that reads it if the freeway cam that operates on a single coil

[01:11:17] and when it shoots out it shoots up over and then back and the precise engineering required to do

[01:11:23] that was miraculous but that's not just that's just a basic example I can see 2500

[01:11:32] canada pinball podcast listeners googling that right now to see what we're what you're talking about

[01:11:39] well I mean you can look at other things like let's let's look at modern games how about

[01:11:43] circus fall terror with the ring master yeah I think about all the problems that came out with

[01:11:47] that game when it was first released and how to be fixed but the amazing amount of engineering

[01:11:53] required to try to get everything to work right right yeah I mean I was playing a theater of

[01:11:58] magic the other day and I was just blown away by the trunk and all the different things it does

[01:12:03] the engineers are great they have but they remember they only can work within the limits of what

[01:12:09] they have and if they get rushed and say we need this thing to be ready to go in the next three to

[01:12:16] four weeks holy crap talk about talk about a rush job right I mean sometimes they have to you

[01:12:23] know retrofit and thick stuff but it's pretty amazing in some ways to see how far they

[01:12:28] and how much they can do in such a short amount of time right but it's also like I mean we talk

[01:12:34] about it and then I know we're up on the hour right now we talk about but it's like back then

[01:12:39] the games were in arcades and they had to steal people's attention away and they have to be

[01:12:45] reliable though they have to be reliable enough that they have to be absolutely hour but you you know

[01:12:50] when you're going up against donkey Kong and street fighter and all these things you know they

[01:12:55] they made games that the ball did something magical and I keep saying that over and over on the show

[01:13:01] I'm like that's good that's a good description well you look at you you look at all these minor

[01:13:06] games and I think you could go over the last five years down most games and say what is the one

[01:13:14] magical thing the ball does and you would come up short on about 80% of games with anything that's

[01:13:22] actually that special that's why I think it's funny when you think about games that are memorable

[01:13:28] you know you think it games like fun house or road show with the pin motion where you know the

[01:13:34] talking heads and how they did that it's pretty remarkable now it's been it was you know it's been

[01:13:42] copied in various variations as recently as you know games like stern sopranos or the hobbit

[01:13:50] or ever but all those examples after that were inferior yeah now the the sequencing of the jaw

[01:13:58] with the with the motor and the drive years was incredible how well they were able to get everything

[01:14:04] synced out right and and you know there's no escaping the fact that that game was probably 25

[01:14:11] hundred bucks new and box well Chris thank you so much for coming back on we're going to get you

[01:14:17] on more often I sort of have been on like if you feel there is a topic at a hand that people just

[01:14:24] want to know you know they're always will be no it's been great having you back I'm so happy to

[01:14:32] hear your opinions on what's been going on in the hobby it's been way too long so we will definitely

[01:14:36] do this again soon sooner than later we won't let it go yeah hopefully your listeners enjoy a

[01:14:43] perspective what I call the voice of common sense and reason in pinball because I just I just like

[01:14:49] I said I'm not criticizing people for spending money I just I just believe that you should get

[01:14:55] that bang for the buck and and you know and I think a lot of people that they if they took more than

[01:15:01] five seconds or looking at you know jack dangers videos and making a decision on a new game

[01:15:09] I think there's more there's just so much more to pinball right I have it there's a couple I

[01:15:16] literally I'm not going to say who it was but somebody that I talked to today that was like said I

[01:15:20] hadn't talked to pinball about pinball over a year is I learned more in talking to you with 15

[01:15:26] minutes and I've learned in the pinball hobby in five years and I said well thank you I appreciate

[01:15:32] that was kind of a compliment to me and I was like well you know thank you I didn't waste my breath

[01:15:38] which includes this podcast yeah well you need to tell that guy great that guy if that guy would

[01:15:43] just listen to Canadian pinball podcasts he wouldn't be he wouldn't be in that situation but Chris thank

[01:15:48] you so much I appreciate it not in the drama either Chris the drama on this show this is nothing but

[01:15:55] this is nothing but you know it's a casual pinball chat um no but buddy thank you so much for coming

[01:16:00] back on and we'll do it soon I hope it was useful always here guys all right

[01:16:30] morning dear hey man it's what a terrible dream I am parched

[01:16:43] that's better I could use another one of those
