[00:00] It might have taken me 400 and 7 episodes of Canadian Pimball Podcasts to get Mr.

[00:22] Zach many on the show, but we've done it and you're gonna hear, I think the best interview

[00:29] I've ever done on Canadian Pimball Podcasts, but before we air the interview, let's go over what's

[00:35] happening in the Pimball world right away. You know Zach taught me this, you can get a lot of

[00:40] Pimball in in a very little amount of time if you just get right too, so thank you for doing that

[00:45] brother Zach. Alright so first and foremost the talk of the week which I missed it by a few hours,

[00:51] I knew this was going to happen, Star Wars has been Vault Editioned. Now is this or is this

[00:59] not a Vault Edition? They are redoing the artwork on Star Wars Premium and Pro and it's a more

[01:06] of an animated style of Star Wars artwork. Now it makes total sense why Stern Pimball is doing this

[01:11] right now for a few reasons. First they spent a gazillion dollars on the Star Wars property.

[01:17] Alright so obviously they want to keep making Star Wars games as long as they can. Second it's the

[01:23] opening week of Comic Con in New York City. So you are, I'm not sure if they're there, they should

[01:28] be there. There's 200,000 geeks that are going to be inside the Javits Center. So it makes total

[01:33] sense to sort of release this thing. Well when Comic Con is popping up and I think the other thing is

[01:39] it just looks damn good. It looks this art package is how it always should have been. I mean I think

[01:45] it looks much better. I think it looks much more fun. The Boba Fed Edition is also awesome to have

[01:52] because the Mandalorian show is about to come out in November on the Disney Channel and we have

[01:58] a new Star Wars movie coming out in December as well. So when it comes to 2019 Q4 being a Star Wars

[02:06] moment it definitely is going to be a huge huge huge Star Wars moment. And so for Stern Pimball to

[02:12] have I think the sexiest versions of the game put out there for our consumption is a really really

[02:20] cool move and it looks great. I don't I don't think I've I've heard anyone say the original art

[02:25] package looks better. This is how it should have been all along. Okay now where's the topper anyone?

[02:32] Anyone where the hell is the R2D2 topper on this game? How can it take over two years to get approval

[02:39] on a damn topper? Now someone asked me a question they said Chris do you think this is going to lower

[02:45] the value of the Star Wars games that have come out previously and the answer is 100% yes it

[02:52] absolutely will lower the value of those games. This just looks so much better and especially the

[02:56] play field right. The cabinets are really cool don't get me wrong I love the Boba Fed and they

[03:01] look the cabinets on the other ones were okay they just seemed really flat. These have much more

[03:06] color and pop but it's the play field art that looks so much better now. It just looks less

[03:13] pathetic and Photoshopped and looks illustrated which makes it look 10 times better but here's

[03:18] here's the other thing too and I wrote this on my Facebook page as cool as I think this is I still

[03:24] think Star Wars is the biggest missed opportunity for the biggest theme on the planet it doesn't make

[03:31] the game any better right it looks better now it's not going to shoot any better and because of how

[03:36] the game shoots and how the game is coded I still think Star Wars is a total total miss in my book

[03:43] and I don't understand if you were how can you kind of be on the fence and now you're going to go

[03:48] in because of the art I think the art was the last reason why people didn't go on going on

[03:54] Star Wars I think the coding and the multipliers was stupid approach to the game they messed up our

[03:59] entire love of that trilogy they threw it all into a multiplier blender and then the the coolest

[04:06] mech in the game the hyper loop it's so damn hard to see that thing operate it doesn't happen unless

[04:12] you hit this really really tight shot up through the death star horrible design a Star Wars game

[04:19] should be as approachable as an Elvira game right and they made it so damn hard to see the toys

[04:26] happen in that game the way you want them to happen so cool new looking Star Wars it's not

[04:32] anywhere near as cool as what's coming and you know I tease you and the last episode of

[04:36] Canada's pinball podcast because I'm going to have to figure out how to how to dribble out this

[04:40] information I can see the people in the stern marketing office right now me like what is he know

[04:45] what's he going to do how's he going to spoil us what about the exclusive we have set up with like

[04:49] IGN how are we going to do this Chris Zach somebody call them up get Canada on our good side so here's

[04:56] a thing the cornerstone game coming out is not Star Wars with this new our package that is not

[05:01] what's happening the cornerstone game coming out next year I'll give you little bits of information

[05:06] out of time it is going to be from designer Brian Eddie all right we've all been wondering where

[05:13] is Brian Eddie's game well it's next and it is a jug or not and it is a theme that I'm I can't

[05:20] not buy it it's just that simple I will give you more clues maybe I'll just drop what it is on

[05:25] the eve of expo so that when stern is there with Elvira and Star Wars this game will be the one

[05:32] you're all going to keep your money in your pockets for see this is why they don't want you to know

[05:36] because if you know what's next you are not going to run to what's now and they want you to buy

[05:43] buy buy what's now but I'm just telling you right now all right this isn't like a playfield clear

[05:48] code issue like hold on to your money this is just hold on to your money because a theme is coming

[05:53] that you're going to want to see before you buy a game and I saw today there are Elvira

[05:58] Ellie's for sale I love it how these games sell out sell out and they do they sell through to

[06:03] distributors but distributors still have them in boxes and if you want an Elvira Ellie you can

[06:09] find one they're they're they're available they're out there all right so Elvira reviews are coming

[06:15] in the game is at point eight six code much further along than than a Batman was when it came out

[06:21] and you know what I kind of I'm trying to get a sense for what this game is and I guess it's

[06:26] always going to have to be the same thing and for you too we're all going to have to just play

[06:32] this game ourselves and see if we like it and I've said it before like I don't think if you

[06:37] love if you don't love these campy b movie things I don't think you're going to walk away from

[06:41] Elvira with a grin from ear to ear I just don't think that's going to happen now if you do like

[06:46] that stuff I think you're going to love it and if that's the thing even if you love Limon I just

[06:50] think this is one of the most obscure themes ever for a lot of you guys out there who like more

[06:56] mainstream stuff okay all right what else is going on so weird thing in the Jurassic Park world

[07:02] now that game is shaping up very very nicely those Jurassic Park Ellie's that are being unboxed

[07:07] are some sexy damn games I won't lie I won't lie unique layout fun toys cool art not the best

[07:16] art ever but it does the job it's a throwback to the to the you know the daddy East game uh here's

[07:22] a weird thing that's that I saw on some people's games the insert that says rescue it's like a

[07:30] little square diamond insert it's supposed to be red now on some people's games that insert there's

[07:36] like four or five of them they're they're all supposed to be red inserts on some people's games the

[07:42] insert is white and it's the wrong insert color that's a really really weird thing it's almost like

[07:49] like and again I know pinside blows this stuff out of proportion there might be like five guys out

[07:53] of five thousand that have that issue but how do you put the wrong insert color into a play field

[08:01] how does that even happen like isn't there just a box on the table with only red inserts for that

[08:07] area of the game and did they run out of red inserts and just put a white one in like how does

[08:12] a mistake like that occur now if you got a game in which one of your inserts is the wrong color

[08:20] what do you do are you gonna demand a fully populated play field or ironically like in in every

[08:27] other collectible industry I'm in if you get a mistake right they call it like a variant those

[08:33] are always worth more because you have the rare version of Jurassic Park you have the Jurassic Park

[08:39] with the white insert not the red so clearly in a world in which rarity equals value your game

[08:45] should be the most valuable Jurassic Park on the planet will that happen I don't know I think a lot

[08:50] of people out there are OCD anal aren't and are gonna want it to be the right way so we'll see

[08:55] what happens just a little little little weird thing it's like Stern Kitches never there's always

[09:00] a little thing that always disrupts every single launch of a pinball machine all right what else

[09:05] is going on there the Elvira thread if you've been reading it I don't understand what's going on

[09:11] here right guys we're on a pinball forum talking about pinball machines that get us excited and it

[09:18] is spiraled into a debate about sexism versus feminism and and Elvira some people think is a leader

[09:29] in the feminist movement and some people think Elvira is simply a sex symbol and it's sexism

[09:35] that she sells I'm here to tell you on canadus pinball podcasts I think the stupidest thing you can

[09:42] do on planet earth is a bunch of grown mostly white men with beer bellies who love pinball are going

[09:51] to open a debate about women's rights why are you doing it on pin side why does that have a place

[09:58] on that you know on that site and Elvira to me I don't know it's he's the thing like you just

[10:04] can't say how you feel you got it to be like you got it you got to toe the political crackline

[10:07] of the world and you can't she's just like she's just fun campy sexy woman who uses her sex appeal

[10:14] to tell jokes and it never goes past like a PG place like it's just that's all she's ever been

[10:21] I don't know why this I don't I never saw her as a feminist leader I never saw her as like a sex

[10:28] star I just saw her as a campy goth the woman who was like making fun of that whole you know macabre

[10:35] what is it macabre like I don't even know I don't even know I'm gonna move on but I'm just saying

[10:39] guys don't don't air out your political garbage on pin side it's it's it's pretty pretty sad pretty

[10:45] sad I think in macabre macabre I don't know everyone's just gonna correct me anyway so anyway

[10:49] all right what else is going on in pinball all right Dutch pinball they're gonna make 500 a week

[10:53] did you hear now well see what happens in the Dutch pinball world uh let's see Jersey jack pinball

[10:59] like like I said did like a show yesterday right so it's like how much new news can actually occur

[11:05] in 24 hours for a canada to pick up the mic so nothing new over there uh there's all I've got left

[11:12] for you guys now and look we're at 11 minutes is the greatest pinball podcast interview I've ever

[11:18] done and I want to give Zach credit for coming on the show because I think him and I would have a

[11:23] really good debate as much as sometimes he says I I I crap on everything that's not true I do like

[11:30] a lot of pinball machines I do I don't think we've received the the dream themes we really want

[11:35] if we're completely honest with ourselves and he does his show and I think he does a great show

[11:41] albeit you could either listen to one of them or watch an entire Lord of the Rings movie but you

[11:47] know what life is short you gotta spend you know your life spending your hours how you see is the

[11:52] most productive uh it's a rich use of time spending hours after hours listening to pinball podcasts so

[11:59] I'm glad he had he decided to come on I think you're really gonna love it and guys if you want to uh

[12:04] you know give me some show topics not that I ever need them but I'll I will take them into consideration

[12:10] uh just hit me up at canada pinballadgmail.com we'll be back we'll be back with more shows and and

[12:25] six months in pinball if all the stuff that's about to happen is about to happen are you ready guys

[12:29] I'm excited are you excited ladies and gentlemen let's get Zach on the air well we know you've been

[12:34] waiting for this moment and Zach many of flipping out pinball of this week in pinball podcast fame

[12:42] has decided to actually come on the show this week I know I was a little bit worried because I saw

[12:48] he did another podcast that gets about 20% of the listeners we get even after he said he'd come

[12:56] on this show so Zach welcome to the show I hope you're not scared coming on canada pinball podcast

[13:01] a little scared no don't be scared Zach we've been friends for a long time and I've been listening

[13:06] to your shows that go over two hours with Dennis and I have to say I think you're gonna break out of

[13:11] the top three pinball podcasts at the twippy this year's because we all know that it is possible

[13:18] to win a twippy for best pinball podcast if your shows go over two hours don't you agree with that

[13:23] oh come on with that bullshit no Zach I totally mean it I totally mean it okay so before we start

[13:29] talking about what's new in pinball this week is there anything you want to ask me before we get

[13:33] going anything new this week for you bud not really I just spent the week polishing my two best

[13:38] pinball podcast twippy is you heard it here first oh training up this week huh I think so I mean

[13:45] now that I've got you on this show we're definitely gonna trend up this week so do you want to

[13:49] talk about Elvira's act we just saw the stream by Jack danger so what do you think should we talk

[13:54] about what what our thoughts were on Elvira 3 yeah what are your thoughts after watching the stream

[13:59] I think Stern's putting a lot of things we haven't seen them doing a long time Zach into this

[14:04] game like for example there's a subway in this game do you think a subway is a fun element to put

[14:08] into a stern pinball machine right now yes they can be subways can be I agree I agree some

[14:14] subways can be let me ask you about something else in the game Zach do you think the 3d mold it

[14:19] multi change house in the back is one of the most visually stunning things you've seen from

[14:25] Stern pinball in quite some time the 3d molded multi change house in the back is one of the most

[14:33] visually stunning things that I've seen from Stern pinball in quite some time Zach are you a hype man

[14:39] I am a hype man I know I know you know people call you a shill because you're distributor and you're

[14:46] always gonna hype every game because you want people to buy it you know Zach what do you think

[14:51] actually listens to this week in pinball for almost two hours what would you say the you know

[14:56] the trade is of someone who can stand listening to that show for that long some of these people

[15:01] may suffer from depression I'm so yeah no I don't think that's the case hey by the way did you hear

[15:06] that nobody bought October fest that's really sad I know and you love the games so much and

[15:11] Zach you know look I know that we go back and forth at each other are always jabbing but every

[15:17] week you pick up the mic and you keep doing the show now I heard that one of your best buddies Greg

[15:23] bone he told you a little advice that makes you wake up every weekend to do a new episode of

[15:31] this week in pinball podcast can you tell us and tell the listeners of canadus pinball podcast

[15:36] what Greg bone tells you to motivate you to do the show every week because we know we know it must

[15:42] be hard having no podcast twippy's what is what is he tell you there's ice cream when you're when

[15:47] you're awake he's such a good guy Greg he's always looking out for you Zach so Zach let me ask

[15:51] you a question because I know you've been down and out a lot and you keep telling me I'm wrong

[15:55] in all these games but I just want to know really what gets you turned on in pinball like what

[16:01] gives you a many hard on when you look down at a pinball machine when I see diverters up in the back

[16:08] house when I see vux okay well diverters and vux is all it takes apparently so Zach I was bashing

[16:15] a virus three for being 15 thousand dollars and you kept saying I was wrong on that now I want

[16:20] to ask you if you could consolidate and crystallize after watching the a virus three stream why you think

[16:29] a three thousand dollar to make pinball machine is worth fifteen thousand dollars in the signature

[16:35] edition now I'm gonna give you one sentence to explain why you think that game should be valued at

[16:40] that much money the ball stayed on the play field that's that's a fact right I guess so um

[16:47] Zach do you think Dennis Kreisle could join the show for a few seconds and take about maybe five

[16:53] or six seconds and not actually say anything at all Dennis take it away hmm I think what I

[17:03] I all right one final question Zach because I know you're the busiest man in pinball I just want

[17:14] to ask you one question when you were up there on stage and you were watching me accept the

[17:20] Twippy Award for best pinball podcast two years in a row what was going through your head my man

[17:26] that looked like a lot of fun oh so funny

[17:38] welcome to this weekend pinball your source for everything pinball

[17:44] oh no oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
