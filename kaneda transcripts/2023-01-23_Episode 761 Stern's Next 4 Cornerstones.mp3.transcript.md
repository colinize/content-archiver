[00:00] I am a real American, Fight for the rights of every man, I am a real American, Fight for

[00:15] what's right, Fight for your life.

[00:26] Welcome to the world's only pinball podcast that will do this.

[00:32] We are going to tell you Stern's next four cornerstone games.

[00:38] I think I have them in order of release.

[00:41] We shall see how accurate we are.

[00:44] But this is the kind of stuff I know you love.

[00:48] This is the kind of stuff I love to do.

[00:50] I love doing shows like these because I love giving you a peek behind the curtain.

[00:57] This is what these companies don't want.

[00:59] They don't want you to have all of the information you should have so you can make the best purchasing

[01:06] decision in the pinball world.

[01:08] This hobby has been dominated by FOMO for too many years.

[01:13] These companies keep these launches super secret, super private.

[01:18] They only want you to buy the game that's on the line.

[01:21] Stern needs to sell a lot of James Bond machines.

[01:26] And guess what?

[01:27] They're not selling.

[01:28] And guess what?

[01:29] If you hear what the next four themes are going to be and maybe one or two of them appeal

[01:34] to you more than James Bond, guess what you're not going to do?

[01:39] You're not going to buy James Bond.

[01:41] And you might not buy the next machine if it's the third or fourth machine that really

[01:46] excites you.

[01:47] Are you ready for it?

[01:48] I'm excited.

[01:49] We don't have to talk too much.

[01:50] But before I reveal to you what the four cornerstone games are at Stern Pinball, I want to just

[01:56] clarify one error I made on my last show.

[02:00] And this is because of Pinside.

[02:02] On Pinside it says there was 122 Big Bang bars produced by Capcom.

[02:08] There were not.

[02:09] I think it was like 12 or 13.

[02:12] And then Gene Cunningham made the rest, like another 164 or something.

[02:16] So just want to clarify that.

[02:18] We also got some news yesterday.

[02:21] So this is funny.

[02:22] Stern Pinball is asking all of its distributors to pay the invoices on James Bond's 60th anniversary

[02:29] edition.

[02:30] And in that email to their distributors, they announced that Keith Elwyn will be signing

[02:37] personally every one of the 500 toppers going on top of the 60th anniversary games.

[02:47] But in the same email, they also did not say that those toppers would be exclusive.

[02:53] The only thing exclusive about this topper, because they're going to sell it to anyone

[02:58] else who has a James Bond, the only thing exclusive will be the 500 toppers that he

[03:03] signs.

[03:05] What is his sick even worth?

[03:07] I mean, it's already on the apron and he's probably going to sign the back of the topper

[03:11] not to mess up the topper when you're staring at it.

[03:15] This whole thing is a total joke.

[03:18] This game is a total launch failure by Stern Pinball.

[03:22] And this is all they have left.

[03:24] Like they got together in a conference room and they're like, what can we do to try to

[03:30] entice distributors to find new buyers for this game?

[03:34] Because this game is going on the line next week.

[03:38] And Stern is not used to this, ladies and gentlemen, they're not used to having a game

[03:42] go on the line in which the majority, I guarantee you, the majority of these games are not sold.

[03:49] There is no way they sold 250 of these games at $20,000.

[03:55] And now we're seeing distributors do a little bit of a sleazy tactic.

[03:59] You can see it on pin side.

[04:01] They're getting some of their customers to list the game for sale for $17,500.

[04:07] And there's going to be another podcast I do this week in which I read for you the terms

[04:12] and conditions between Stern Pinball and its distributors because Stern has a rule that

[04:19] their distros can't list a game for sale below a certain price.

[04:25] So that's why they're doing this.

[04:26] And you see these guys being like, I just bought James Bond.

[04:29] You can get it new in bucks.

[04:31] And you can have it for $17,500.

[04:32] Sure.

[04:33] So you're telling me that some dude bought this game for $2,500 less than MSRP and he's

[04:40] just willing to pass it on right away.

[04:43] Absolutely a name sleazy sales tactics going on.

[04:47] But Canadian is about to blow all that up because I'm the pinball podcaster that's for the people.

[04:53] I want to give you all the information you need.

[04:56] I know a lot of other media outlets have been saying rumors.

[04:59] Do I need to remind people that I told everybody in April of 2022 that Twilight Zone was being

[05:08] remade?

[05:09] And yes, Twilight Zone is being remade.

[05:12] And I think it's going to be a raw thrills game.

[05:15] And they're going to partner with Chicago Gaming Company.

[05:17] Chicago Gaming Company is going to build it.

[05:20] And Raw Thrills is going to be the company that distributes it.

[05:24] So wait for that to happen.

[05:26] And Canada not get any credit for that rumor.

[05:28] Because only 10% of the pinball media give me credit when I'm right 90% of the time.

[05:35] But one of my good listeners said, hey Chris, you don't even need to talk about anybody

[05:38] else.

[05:39] There's a reason why we subscribe and he's right.

[05:42] So let's get to it.

[05:43] So as we know, Stern Pinball is moving to a new factory.

[05:47] And that move coupled with their backlog means they are only going to come out with two

[05:52] Cornerstone games in 2023.

[05:55] And they may only come out with two Cornerstone games in 2024.

[05:59] But I'm not sure about 2024.

[06:02] Now for Cornerstone games, I have not seen any of these machines.

[06:06] But my source is so good on this that I am willing to put my podcast reputation if there

[06:12] even is a reputation left that you are going to see these four titles from Stern Pinball

[06:19] over the next two years.

[06:21] I think we may also see a vault edition of Tron Pinball mixed in with these titles.

[06:29] And please don't PM me about how well is my Tron Vault Edition news.

[06:35] Because just trust me, wait and see.

[06:39] If you want to buy a Tron, don't go over pay right now.

[06:43] And if you own a Tron, don't sell it based upon what I just said.

[06:49] Wait and see.

[06:51] Those two words, if you embrace them, if you make love to them, you will be so much happier

[06:57] in Pinball and you will have a much better 2023.

[07:02] Are we ready for the countdown of Stern's four next Cornerstone titles?

[07:07] Now not all of these are going to be a surprise.

[07:10] And you know we've been talking about some of these, but we are going to on the record

[07:15] say that these are going to happen.

[07:17] So the first game we're going to see and we're going to see it this March is the following

[07:23] title.

[07:24] Or do you mind if we just call you Peter Parker?

[07:28] What did you say?

[07:29] Oh you're quite the bully one you want to be aren't you Parker?

[07:33] Problem is Eddie Brock isn't the same guy he once was.

[07:38] Why don't we introduce you to our better half.

[07:41] We call ourselves Venom.

[07:44] Ah well you probably knew it was Venom.

[07:50] I've been telling you it's been Venom for over a year.

[07:52] The game is done.

[07:54] It's Brian Eddie with Zombie Eddie on artwork.

[07:58] It is not based on the movie.

[08:00] It is based on the comic book and we're going to get comic book style art and we're going

[08:04] to get comic book style coding on the game.

[08:08] Now the big question with Venom is going to be this.

[08:11] How are they going to sell a thousand of these things at 13,000 a pop for LE's and how are

[08:18] they going to sell premiums at like 9700 bucks.

[08:23] But we are going to see this game and unlike James Bond look for this game to be code complete

[08:29] when it comes out because it's been finished for over a year.

[08:34] Alright number two on games coming out is the following.

[08:42] And I wonder

[08:46] When I sing along with you

[08:51] Everything I've ever felt this way forever

[08:57] Everything I've ever felt this way tonight, yeah

[09:03] Only thing I'll ever ask of you

[09:06] Got a promise not to stop when I say beware

[09:11] She said

[09:14] Yes ladies and gentlemen, Canada's Pinball Podcast is here to tell you that I'm hearing

[09:19] that this is going to be Jack Danger's title over at Stern Pinball.

[09:24] Jack Danger making the Foo Fighters Pinball Machine.

[09:29] I'm hearing that on artwork is also going to be Zombie Eddie.

[09:34] So they're going to load this game up with some beautiful artwork because Zombie Eddie

[09:38] does no wrong.

[09:40] And I can hear what some of you are saying right now.

[09:42] Why the Foo Fighters?

[09:44] And if you think about the Foo Fighters in pinball format, it is a little bit of a really

[09:48] strange selection and I'll tell you why.

[09:51] The Foo Fighters are not that popular and I mean it.

[09:55] Even though they have 10 studio albums and don't shoot the messenger, the Foo Fighters

[10:00] have sold 20 million albums.

[10:02] Now look that's a lot of albums until you look at stuff like Elton John has sold 250

[10:10] million albums.

[10:11] Nirvana with much fewer albums sold 75 million albums and Guns N' Roses sold 120 million

[10:20] albums.

[10:21] So 20 million is not a lot.

[10:24] And so some of you are Foo Fighters fans.

[10:26] I'm not going to argue with you about your love of Foo Fighters.

[10:30] But as a cornerstone theme, I'm not really sure Foo Fighters is the way to go.

[10:37] We shall see.

[10:39] I know a lot of you out there were hoping it was going to be He-Man, Masters of the

[10:43] Universe, but I am hearing from my source that Jack Danger's game is going to be Foo

[10:50] Fighters.

[10:51] And again, it's another one of those themes where if this is true, and again I haven't

[10:56] seen anything, so take some of this with a grain of salt, but if this happens, there

[11:03] is no way you're going to sell a thousand Stern LEs at $13,000.

[11:10] And I just don't know what they do because they can't lower the price because then everyone

[11:13] who bought the James Bond's for like $13,000 is going to be pissed off.

[11:18] I think what Stern's going to end up doing with titles like Venom and titles like Foo

[11:22] Fighters, I think they're going to knock down the number of LEs to 500.

[11:27] They have to.

[11:28] There's no way you can make more Foo Fighter LEs than Stranger Things or Ghostbusters or

[11:35] even Star Wars.

[11:37] Like we got to get back to reality that the LE is for the diehard fans of the franchise.

[11:44] There's just not enough in the pinball buying community to float a thousand Foo Fighter LEs.

[11:50] And look, I know some of you are like, oh my gosh, 2023 is going to be Venom and Foo

[11:55] Fighters.

[11:56] It might as well hold on to my money until 2024.

[12:01] And let me tell you, I think that might be a smart move.

[12:04] What's the two words?

[12:05] Wait and see because wait till you see what the two games are going to be in 2024.

[12:10] Let's get to number three on my list.

[12:13] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,

[12:43] come on.

[12:47] It is happening people.

[12:49] Jaws is a Keith Elwyn machine.

[12:51] That is what I'm hearing.

[12:52] Keith Elwyn and Jaws Pinball.

[12:54] Much like Jurassic Park.

[12:56] It won't have all of the movie assets, but I'm hearing it will be a Jaws adventure.

[13:02] And if you love Jurassic Park and you want to see a big shark and you got to have a shark

[13:07] popping up out of the play field and eating balls and you got to shoot that yellow oxygen

[13:12] tank, I don't know, are they going to have that as the final way to kill the shark?

[13:16] Look, this game, whether you love Jaws or not, right?

[13:20] Because Jaws don't do call outs and if you don't get the actors from the movie, will

[13:24] it still work?

[13:25] I have a lot of faith in Keith Elwyn making an all original Jaws game that like pays

[13:32] homage to the movie scenes we like.

[13:35] Much like Jurassic Park, that is going to work.

[13:38] And look, this game, if they make it.

[13:41] You know, there was a reason why at pinball shows people were loading up on Christopher

[13:45] franchise Jaws translates because I think this rumor that's been swirling through pinball

[13:50] for a while is pretty damn accurate.

[13:54] So look, Keith Elwyn just came out with this James Bond.

[13:57] And I don't think we're going to see another game from him this year, but I do think we're

[14:02] going to see this Jaws machine sometime in 2024.

[14:05] I'm excited.

[14:06] See, this is why.

[14:08] This is why you might not want to buy a game from Stern next year.

[14:12] You might want to wait for something else or explore Scooby Doo or go get Godfather.

[14:17] Oh, how is Godfather?

[14:19] Can you imagine if 2023 is going to be freaking Venom, Godfather and Foo Fighters?

[14:27] I mean, I think during a global recession, our money might be the safest it's ever been

[14:33] in the history of pinball launches.

[14:36] But wait, 2024 things might be turning around.

[14:40] This is the final one.

[14:42] And look, this one kind of gets me excited.

[14:44] All right.

[14:45] Are you ready for it?

[14:47] Drumroll please.

[14:49] The fourth cornerstone I hear that's in the works over at Stern pinball ginormous IP ginormous

[14:57] IP is the following.

[15:02] I miss the desert.

[15:11] I miss the sea.

[15:12] I miss waking up every morning.

[15:19] I'm wondering what wonderful adventure the new day will bring to us.

[15:30] Those days have come and gone.

[15:32] Perhaps, perhaps not.

[15:38] I don't believe in magic, but a few times in my life, I've seen things, things I can't

[15:48] explain.

[15:49] And I've come to believe it's not so much what you believe.

[15:56] It's hard to believe.

[16:51] I'm not sure what I'm saying.

[16:59] Now look, I know a lot of you are saying Stern already did an Indiana Jones game and it wasn't

[17:04] any good.

[17:05] And the Balli Williams game is perfect.

[17:08] Well look, I'm not here to tell you this game is going to be good or bad, but I'm here to

[17:11] tell you this.

[17:13] All I can report to you is that I'm hearing from my source that Stern pinball is going

[17:18] to make a new Indiana Jones game.

[17:21] Now who's designing the game?

[17:23] Who's on artwork?

[17:24] Who's on code?

[17:25] I don't know, but if I were a guessing man and I were a betting man, I think this game

[17:30] is going to be John Borg's next game.

[17:33] Think about it people.

[17:34] Who's due up for another game?

[17:35] If Brian Eddy is doing Venom and we know Keith Elwin is doing freaking Jaws and we know that

[17:42] Jack Danger's doing Foo Fighters, then that means that John Borg might be working on Indiana

[17:49] Jones.

[17:50] So Miz is working on it, but he just did James Bond.

[17:53] So I think John Borg, Indiana Jones, 2024, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[18:01] People I love doing these shows.

[18:03] Thank you so much for the support.

[18:04] We are over 540 club members right now as of today.

[18:10] And I hope if you're listening to this and you're new to the Canada Club, you now know

[18:14] what Canada is all about.

[18:16] This is the most entertaining and the most fun pinball podcast I believe on the planet.

[18:23] I think we have a good time here.

[18:26] We have a great time on Facebook Live during the Saturday morning spectacular.

[18:30] And that's how we're going to do it.

[18:33] We're going to tell you what we know when we know it.

[18:37] Look for that show this week where we go behind the curtain again.

[18:41] And I'll read for you the details from American Pinball to its distributors and Stern Pinball

[18:46] to its distributors.

[18:48] I can see people shaking right now.

[18:50] We don't want consumers to have all the information.

[18:52] We don't want consumers to know how much money people are making per game sold.

[18:56] Why not?

[18:57] Why can't we be more empowered?

[19:00] If we're empowered and informed, it just makes us better consumers.

[19:06] I'm on your side.

[19:07] I'm not trying to sell you anything other than this pinball podcast.

[19:11] And you got to admit for five bucks a month, it's sure worth it.

[19:14] And for those of you who've upped your amount by more than five dollars, I really do thank

[19:20] you.

[19:21] I mean it.

[19:22] I went to buy coffee today.

[19:23] Two coffees were almost eight dollars.

[19:27] And so maybe that's me saying, hey, if you're only given five, you know you can give 10.

[19:31] Everybody have a great day.

[19:32] We'll talk to you soon.

[19:33] I'm on your side.

[19:34] I'm on your side.
