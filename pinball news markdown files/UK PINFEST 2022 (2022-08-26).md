**Date:** 26th-28th August 2022
**Location:** Mercure Daventry Court, Sedgemore Way, Daventry, NN11 0SG, UK.

The end-of-August public holiday can only mean one thing; It’s time for [UK Pinfest](http://www.ukpinfest.com/).

We are back at the [Mercure Daventry Hotel](https://all.accor.com/hotel/A0I0/index.en.shtml) for the fourth UK Pinfest show. All four have been held here, starting in 2018, with a one year hiatus due to Covid in 2020.

The show doesn’t open to the public until 7pm tonight, and that is only for VIP pass holders. For everyone else, doors open at 10:30am tomorrow.

Outside the main hall there were two stands – one for show tickets and another from London Pinball selling assorted pinball parts and paraphernalia.

One-handed pinball on Elvira’s House of Horrors

The first two competitive events were held on Friday evening. Stall Ball was run by Neil McRae of [Domino Arcade](https://www.facebook.com/dominoarcadeuk/) on a *The Shadow* machine with a first prize of a new Nokia Android phone.

[![Neil starts the Stall Ball competition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/038-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x519.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/038-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Neil starts the Stall Ball competition

In Stall Ball, the aim is to put the ball into a saucer, scoop or lock. Do that and you can walk away, let the next player in line take over and join the back of the queue to carry on playing. If you should drain the ball though, you are out.

There was a long line of players but it moved very quickly, so even if you were at the very back you probably only had a five minute wait to play. As players were knocked out, the queue shortened and the time between turns reduced.

[![The queue ran around three sides of the hall, but it moved quickly](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/039-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/039-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

The eventual winner was Glen.

At the back of the hall, the main tournament started with players registering and playing their qualifying games.

Later in the day, as several competitive events were underway and the number of visitors increased, the hall began to get pretty full, especially around the tournaments area.

[![The hall was getting full](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/058-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x537.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/058-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

The hall was getting full

Although all the pinballs in the main hall were physical machines, there continues to be quite some interest in playing virtual pinball.

We ran into a team of organisers from the popular [*Elite Virtual Pinball Weekly Challenge*](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1092032341170362) group on Faceboook who play weekday, weekend and longer virtual pinball competitions where players all play the same pre-announced table and submit their scores online to determine the winner.

An overview of the main hall

If it got too crowded inside the hall, there was always space to relax in the sunshine on the patio just opposite the main hall’s entrance.

[![The patio area outside the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/072-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/072-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Qualifying in the main tournament ran all day, while behind those players the finals of the UK Pinball League were being held to find the regional and national champions.

The machines available to play were *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* (Stern), *Godzilla*, *Batman 66*, *Black Jack*, *Eight Ball*, *Joker Poker*, *Lethal Weapon 3*, *Hot Wheels*, *Jurassic Park* (Stern) and *Fish Tales.*

[![Players in the main tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/063-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/063-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Players in the main tournament

Meanwhile, a row of machines adjacent to the tournament area was being used for the finals of the [UK Pinball League](http://www.pinballleague.uk/index.php), with the A Division playing on Saturday morning and the B Division in the afternoon.

[![Playing in the B Dvision of the UK Pinball League](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/070-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x484.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/070-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Playing in the UK Pinball League finals

The UK Pinball League operates six separate leagues, dividing the country into South-West, Midlands, London & South-East, Northern, Scottish and Irish regions. Each region sends their top-ranked players to this national final which is split into an A Division for the very highest ranked, and the B Division for the second tier. The exact number from each region who qualify for the national finals depends on the number of players taking part.

The machines used were *Genesis*, *Spider-Man*, *Revenge from Mars*, *Paragon*, *High Speed 2: The Getaway* and *Elvira’s House of Horrors*.

[![The A Division final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/079-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x619.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/079-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

The A Division finals

All players in each division play each of the six machines and their scores are ranked with points awarded. The two players with the most points are straight into that division’s final four, with the other two places coming from a play-off between the 3rd to 6th placed players.

In the A Division that left a final four of Nick Marshall, Will Jarvis, Andy Foster and Josh Iles.

Due to time constraints, the final was a single game played on a machine chosen by the highest qualifier, Nick Marshall. Nick chose Spider-Man but it was Will Jarvis with the highest score of 105,229,180, with Nick Marshall second on 57,596,330, Andy Foster third with 6,738,340 and Josh Iles fourth with 6,135,100.

The main hall closed at 6pm for a one hour break, before reopening to VIP ticket-holders at 7pm.

As on Friday night, there was another Stall Ball competition held on *The Shadow* and run by Neil McRae.

[![Time for Stall Ball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/077-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x525.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/077-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Time for Stall Ball

The winner was one of the Pinball Amigos, and he got to choose between a Nokia phone and an Apple watch as his prize, choosing the latter.

[![The winner of Saturday's Stall Ball ](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/078-uk-pinfest-2022-563x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/078-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Speaking of winners, the winner of the Best In Show award was announced on Saturday evening.

The award went to Ant for his stunning *Terminator 2*.

## SUNDAY

The show opened again at 10:30am on Sunday.

[![Sunday's opening](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/080-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/080-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Sunday’s opening

10:30 was also the time for the resumption of three competitive events.

In the main tournament, there was an additional qualifying session until midday which gave those not taking part in the other events a last chance to put in a card of three scores which would rank in the top 24 entries and get them into the play-offs later in the day.

[![Sunday's qualifying session in the main tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/086-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/086-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Sunday’s qualifying session in the main tournament

While that was taking place, the final rounds of the Pinball Classic competition began.

In the qualifying on Saturday there were eight machines – *Flash Gordon*, *Genie*, *Lady Luck*, *Locomotion*, *Sorcerer*, *Star Gazer*, *TX-Sector* and *Xenon*. The top two scorers on each machine progressed to Sunday’s play-offs.

Those sixteen were:

* Alan Jones
* Andy Foster
* Craig Pullen
* David Dutton
* David Fowler UK
* Greg Mott
* Ian Walmsley
* Mark Slade
* Martin Fox
* Matt Vince
* Owen Lloyd
* Peter Blakemore
* Rich Mallett
* Sebastian Eiselin
* Shaun Russell
* William Dutton

They were then divided into four groups of four players and given three machines to play.

[![The play-offs in the Pinball Classic competition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/082-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/082-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

The play-offs in the Pinball Classic competition

Points were awarded for the finishing position in each game using the 4-2-1-0 system. When all three games had been played, the two players with the most points in each group progressed to the final eight, where the same system was employed to reach the final four.

They were Andy Foster, Matt Vince, Craig Pullen and Peter Blakemore, and the games they would play (using the same 4-2-1-0 scoring) would be *Locomotion*, *Sorcerer* and *TX-Sector*.

[![Andrew Foster starts the final of the Pinball Classic on Locomotion](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/087-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x524.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/087-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Andy Foster starts the final of the Pinball Classic on Locomotion

Andy won on *Locomotion* with 776,440. Matt was second on 275,030, Craig third on 207,310 and Peter fourth on 127,380.

On *Sorcerer*, Peter took top spot with his 2,290,200 compared to Andy’s 1,210,510, Matt’s 1,181,410 and Craig’s 1,176,410.

[![Peter won on Sorcerer](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/088-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x556.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/088-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Peter won on Sorcerer

That meant, going into the last game of the final on TX-Sector, Andy had 6 points, Peter had 4 points, Matt had 3 and Craig 1 point. Theoretically, either Andy, Peter or Matt could win.

[![Craig plays on the last game, TX-Sector](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/089-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x580.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/089-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Craig plays on the last game, TX-Sector

As it turned out, Craig won with Matt second, Peter third and Andy fourth. That gave Craig, Matt and Peter 5 points each, while Andy won with his 6 points.

There was a 3-way play-off for the remaining places on Lady Luck which was won by Craig with 688,550 while Peter was second with 515,000 and Matt third on 138,520.

The top prize was £1,000 thanks to sponsorship of the competition by Home Leisure Direct. Trophies and cash prizes were awarded by the competition organiser, Shaun Harvey.

While the Pinball Classic play-offs were taking place, across the corridor was the Under-12 division of the NBA Challenge competition.

[![The NBA Challenge's Under-12 division](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/081-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x563.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/081-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

The NBA Challenge’s Under-12 division

The quarter-finals featured Owen Craven, Effie Lewell, James Aw, Daniel Vince, Michael Aw, Ethan Campbell, Lucy Vince and Callan Kinloch.

Owen, Daniel, Ethan and Lucy made in into the semi-finals, which set up brother vs sister final as Daniel Vince played Lucy Vince.

[![Daniel Vince vs Lucy Vince in the final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/083-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x537.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/083-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Before the next batch of competitive events began, there was a presentation in the main hall to induct the latest members of the UK Pinball Hall of Fame.

The Hall of Fame began in 2008 at the UK Pinball Show and continued through the UK Pinball Party years until 2015, after which there was no national UK show for two years and so new inductions were paused.

Now that [UK Pinfest](http://www.ukpinfest.com/) is firmly established as the main UK show, the induction presentations resumed for the two UK-based inductees of 2022. Pinball News Editor, Martin Ayub, made the announcements.

The first inductee was Paul Brock, who established and runs the highly popular online discussion forum, [Pinball Info](https://www.pinballinfo.com/community/), which has grown to become the central point for pinball activities across the UK.

[![UK Pinball Hall of Fame inductee, Paul Brock](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/100-uk-pinfest-2022-885x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/100-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

The second inductee wasn’t a single person, but was a team instead. The Northern Light Pinball team organise the pinball element of many gaming shows, which both helps support the show and brings pinball to many players who are new to the game. They also run events which have raised huge sums for their chosen charities.

[![The Northern Lights Pinball team](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/101-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x723.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/101-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x723.jpg)

Martin also made two announcements.

The first was the creation of a Nominations and Inductions Committee drawn from across the country and representing many different aspects of the game to consider future nominations for induction into the UK Pinball Hall of Fame. The Committee members were all introduced to the audience.

The second was the [creation of a website](https://ukpinballhalloffame.com/) at ukpinballhalloffame.com to honour all the past inductees and provide a way for suggestions for future inductees to be sent to the Committee for consideration. Details of the Committee’s make up is also included.

* Andy Foster

They were joined in the quarter-finals by:

Each round followed the same best-of-three pairings until the final four were decided. They were Andy Foster, Matt Vince, Brad Atwood and Rich Mallett.

The final four: Andy Foster, Matt Vince, Brad Atwood and Rich Mallett

The three machines drawn for the final were *Black Jack*, *Fish Tales* and *Jurassic Park*, representing one ‘classic’ machine, one DMD and one modern Stern. A single four-player game would be played on each machine, with the 4-2-1-0 points system for first to fourth.

[![Andrew starts the first game on Black Jack](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/105-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/105-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Andy starts the first game on Black Jack

The final, like much of the qualifying and play-offs, was streamed live on the [Pinball Live stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pinball_live), where you can watch each day’s action. There was also large monitor showing the playfield of each game in the final.

[![Watching the gameplay on the playfield camera's monitor](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/106-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x541.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/106-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Watching the gameplay on the playfield camera’s monitor

The first game, played on *Black Jack*, was won by Andy with 637,170, compared to Matt’s 120,050, Brad’s 69,870 and Rich’s 58,120.

The second game on *Fish Tales* again saw Andy and Matt at the top, although the order was reversed this time, as it was for Rich and Brad in third and fourth respectively.

[![Rich starts on Fish Tales](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/107-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x539.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/107-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Rich starts on Fish Tales

So, going into the last game on *Jurassic Park* the scores were:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Andy Foster | 4 + 2 = 6 points |
| Matt Vince | 2 + 4 = 6 points |
| Brad Atwood | 1 + 0 = 1 point |
| Rich Mallett | 0 + 1 = 1 point |

The scores after two games

That meant only Andy or Matt could win overall, with whichever of them scored the most on *Jurassic Park* being crowned the champion.

[![Brad played first on Jurassic Park](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/108-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x508.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/108-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Brad played first on Jurassic Park

Brad took an initial lead after the first ball, but nobody had scored that many points yet.

Andy changed that, putting in a decent second ball of over 200M which gave him a solid lead going into everyone’s third and final ball.

Andy finished his game in the lead on 275M. Matt started his third game on 58M and needed a strong third ball which didn’t come, adding just 4M before the inevitable ball drain. Brad ended the game in second place with 82M for third place overall, with Rich in fourth with his 40M.

[![Matt congratulates Andy on his win](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/109-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x539.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/109-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Matt congratulates Andy on his win

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Andy Foster | 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 points |
| Matt Vince | 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 points |
| Brad Atwood | 1 + 0 + 2 = 3 point |
| Rich Mallett | 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 point |

The final points total

Wayne Johns then presented trophies and cash prizes to the top four players, with the winner, Andy, picking up his second £1,000 cash prize of the day.

The awards presentations ended this year’s UK Pinfest.

With the time now after 6pm and the show officially closing at 4:30pm, many machines had already been broken down in preparation for the journey home.

[![Still plenty of work at the end of the show for the machine donors](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/115-uk-pinfest-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/uk-pinfest-2022/115-uk-pinfest-2022.jpg)

Still plenty of work at the end of the show for the machine donors

For some the journey home would be relatively short, but for others it wouldn’t begin until the following morning after another night spent in the show hotel.

Congratulations to Philip and all those involved in another great UK Pinfest show.

With this being the fourth year, most of those running the show, the tournament and the other events are all familiar with what needs to be done, but it’s still a ton of work and each year throws up new surprises and challenges.

However, it was clearly very successful, with attendance up significantly and the main hall nearing capacity on Saturday.

Despite the great turnout it never became overly crowded though, as you can see for yourself in our exclusive Ten Minute Tour video looking around the machines and tournaments at the show during the busy period on Saturday afternoon.

We’ll be back at Daventry next year for UK Pinfest 2023. Check our [Diary page](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/diary/) for dates and more details just as soon as they are announced.
