Stern Pinball today revealed their second (and probably final) cornerstone title of 2023 – the much anticipated new game from game designer Brian Eddy, *Venom*.

Based on the Marvel comic book character, *[Venom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(character))* is the result of an extra-terrestrial symbiote bonding with a human host to create a symbiotic combo with superhuman powers. *Venom* was created when a symbiote, having initially tried to bond with Spider-Man but being rejected once his evil intentions became clear, bonded with Spider-Man’s enemy Eddie Brock instead.

That bond eventually overwhelmed Brock, so there are other characters created as a result of different bonds with the *Venom* symbiote. In addition, there are offspring from *Venom* who also bonded with various human hosts to create additional symbiotic Marvel Universe characters.

But back to the pinball, as Stern today revealed the three *Venom* variants with the regular Pro, Premium and Limited Edition versions. Artwork for all three is by Zombie Yeti (Jeremy Packer) while music for the game includes a dozen tracks from Creed and Alter Bridge’s Mark Tremonti who had previously performed music for Jersey Jack Pinball titles (including their logo animation).

The Pro model is priced at $6,999, the Premium at $9,699 and the Limited Edition at $12,999.

*Venom* is a two-flippered, six-ball, standard-width game design with a single inlane and outlane on each side. As expected, the playfield is a riot of colour and includes some unique gameplay features.

Here’s the playfield from the Pro model:

As usual, the Premium and Limited Edition playfields are very similar. Here they are:

One of the key playfield features is the Carnage captive ball which pushes the titular character up a ramp and back into the Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane which has played host to many of the more villainous characters in the Marvel Universe.

Each side of the game also features a vertical ball lock which releases onto ramp return wireforms into the left and right inlanes.

Another key playfield feature is the Bell Tower which features a swinging bell at the top, activated by the standup target at the base.

Spider-Man’s alter-ego’s workplace, the Daily Bugle, also features in the game in the form of a scoop which starts multiple modes and then kicks the ball up into a ‘web-slinger’ and onto a wireform leading to the right inlane.

**Premium & Limited Edition Models**

As we’ve come to expect, the Premium and Limited Edition models include some additional playfield features over the base Pro model.

One of the most significant additions is a Spider-Man Doppelganger 3-bank of roll-under targets which swings out from the right side of the playfield. There are corresponding inserts on the playfield which are absent on the Pro model.

The Premium and Limited Edition also include a different centre ramp which can raise or lower to provide three possible shot options, one of which acts as an additional ball lock thanks to a controlled post in front.
