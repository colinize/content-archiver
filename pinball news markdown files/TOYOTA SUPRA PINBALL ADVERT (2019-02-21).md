**Toyota Uses Pinball Themed Advert to Re-Launch Their Supra Model**

After years of rumors, Toyota Motor Company oﬃcially announced in late 2018 that the sporty *Supra* model would be re-introduced into their lineup as a 2-seater 3.0 litre twin-scroll turbocharged inline six cylinder engined rear-wheel-drive upscale coupe. The new *Supra* was ﬁrst shown to the public at the 2019 International Auto Show in Detroit, MI, USA.

The oﬃcial North American reveal for the 2020 *Supra* model (known as *GR Supra* globally) was in the form of a 60-second commercial advertisement shown February 3rd, 2019 during the TV coverage of Super Bowl LIII.

The Toyota Super Bowl ad begins with the driver dropping in a quarter and hitting the ‘launch’ button, then revving the engine of his silver-colored Supra before ‘launching’ down a long, neon-lit roadway.

The background music is *Pinball Wizard* from rock group The Who’s 1969 opus, *Tommy*.

The *Supra* then makes its way onto a life sized single-level playﬁeld loaded with a number of obstacles, including a spinner, bumpers and light-up panels that the driver easily runs over. At one point during the ad the *Supra* driver barely misses being collected by a rotating obstacle with a menacing face and evil-looking ‘teeth’.

Eventually, the *Supra* rolls over diﬀerent letters on the playﬁeld to activate the word ‘Supra’ on the game’s playﬁeld and a DMD-esque backglass display.

The advertisement was directed by Golden Globe nominated director and screenwriter Marc Forster.  Forster is known for directing powerful performances in ﬁlms like *Monster’s Ball* and *The Kite Runner*. The ‘Wizard’ TV commercial was created by Toyota’s North American ad agency, Saatchi & Saatchi.

This is not the ﬁrst time that Toyota has used a pinball theme in its television advertising. In 1985, Toyota introduced its MR-2 mid-engined sports car with a life-sized pinball themed advert. Despite the similarities between the two commercials, a Toyota spokesperson said that any resemblance is coincidental.

The 2020 Toyota *Supra* made its sporting debut February 16, 2019 at The *NASCAR Racing Experience 300*. This event is a supporting race for the 2019 Daytona 500 held annually in Daytona Beach, FL, USA.

The highest finish by a NASCAR XFinity series Toyota *Supra* in the 2019 race was 3rd by Brandon Jones after Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Jeffrey Earnhardt (grandson of NASCAR Hall of Fame NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt), started his number 18 iK9 sponsored Toyota *Supra* on the pole position.

Ironically the two drivers that finished the race ahead of Jones are teammates for JR Motorsports, which is owned by Jeffrey Earnhardt’s uncle, Dale Earnhardt Junior.

In the Toyota product display area at Daytona International Speedway, Toyota had a re-themed Williams *High Speed* pinball game that visitors to the display could play.

The re-theme was professionally done by [Orange County Pinballs](https://www.orangecountypinballs.com/) and the graphics are very similar to the ‘game’ used in the television commercial. It however was set to free play so it wasn’t possible to drop a quarter to mimic the opening of the TV commercial.
