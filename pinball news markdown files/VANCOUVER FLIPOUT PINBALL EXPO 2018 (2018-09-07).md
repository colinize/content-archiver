Hello and welcome to our live coverage from the Roundhouse of the [Vancouver Flipout Pinball Expo 2018](http://www.vancouverflipout.com/).

We’ll be here right across the three days of the show, and even the set up on Thursday, bringing you all the action from this, the largest Canadian pinball event of the calendar.

The venue for this year’s show is the Roundhouse Community & Arts Center in downtown Vancouver.  While previous shows had been held at the Holiday Inn hotel, also in downtown Vancouver, this year the show needed more space and so moved to the main exhibition hall at the Roundhouse.

[![The Roundhouse in Vancouver](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/014-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x648.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/014-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

The new home of the Roundhouse in Vancouver

It’s a ten-minute walk from the previous venue to the new one, but the Roundhouse certainly offers lots more space at the cost of not having your accommodation in the same building as the show.

[![The show was held in the Gerry Thorne Exhibition Hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/093-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x704.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/093-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

The show was held in the Gerry Thorne Exhibition Hall

**Thursday**

The actual show doesn’t open to the public until 10am on Friday but the tournaments can run for somewhat longer, so the qualifying rounds began on Thursday at 4pm, even as the rest of the show was still being set up.

The tournaments are held on the right side of the hall, while the central and left areas are where all the free play machines are located along with the vendor tables.  Most of these machines were set up by the time the tournament qualifying games began, but there were still a few more to be added.

[![A few more machines to be added to these rows of classic machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/005-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/005-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

More newer titles

Among the newest titles at the show are *Thunderbirds* from Homepin, Deadpool Pro from Stern Pinball and *Pirates of the Caribbean* from Jersey Jack Pinball.  Both Mike Kalinowski from Homepin and Jack Guarnieri from Jersey Jack Pinball are appearing at the Vancouver Flipout Pinball Expo.  In fact, Mike had arrived a couple of days earlier and was helping at the show by checking the machines were working and managing all the machine keys.

**Friday**

We returned to the show in plenty of time for Friday’s 10am opening expecting a long queue of visitors eager to get in to play the 130+ machines on the show floor.  Friday, though, is a regular working day and so things got off to a relatively slow start.

The tournament area soon became busy once the doors opened, with players trying to qualify in the Open and Classic divisions.

Outside, three food trucks had arrived and were setting up to serve food at lunchtime and into the evening to show guests.

After a break, we returned to the show in the evening to find the grand prize in the show raffle – a new-in-box Iron Maiden pinball – was on display next to the front desk.  Tickets could be purchased for $20 with the draw taking place at 3pm on Sunday.

We had returned just in time for the start of the VIP party which began at 7pm in an adjacent room.

This was a buffet-style sit-down dinner, with drinks provided by the sponsor Pabst Blue Ribbon and music DJ’d by Pinball Magazine’s Jonathan Joosten.  In addition, a prize raffle was held, with everyone attending given a numbered ticket for the draw.

**Saturday**

Saturday’s action began at 10am. While the hall certainly got busy later in the day, there was only a handful of visitors waiting for the show to open.

Saturday was also ‘Seminars Day’, with three presentations in the afternoon in the adjacent theatre.

The first was scheduled to begin at 12:30pm, but before that free pizza was served, provided by show organiser Tommy Floyd of Nitro Pinball.

Once everyone had enjoyed their food, they took their seats and the first seminar could begin.  This was from the American Pinball team of Joe Balcer and Nirmal Vasani.

[![The first seminar in the theatre](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/065-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/065-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

The first seminar in the theatre

Joe began by describing how he got into the pinball business and the companies he worked for, including Data East/Sega/Stern, Jersey Jack and now American.

[![Joe talked about his career in pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/070-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x665.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/070-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

Joe talked about his career in pinball

The main focus of his talk was the *Houdini* machine from American Pinball, and Joe described how the company first showed their initial design from another game designer in October 2016 at Pinball Expo, but Joe subsequently redesigned it and the team brought the new playable machine to the Texas Pinball Festival in March the following year, a mere four months later.

[![Joe with the Houdini machine](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/051-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x659.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/051-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

Joe and Nirmal had brought with the some special prizes which they took back to the show floor to give to the best players on the *Houdini* machine.

But they didn’t leave without giving a sneak preview on the screen of American Pinball’s second title.

Mike Kalinowski

Mike gave a slideshow documenting his early years working with electronics and the formation of his company, Homepin.  He showed how the factory he created in Shenzhen, China, grew and how they were able to start producing *Thunderbirds* pinballs there.  He described the personal and professional hurdles he had to overcome along the way,  as well as explaining the processes used and the decisions made about various features in the *Thunderbirds* game.

The final seminar was from the Jersey Jack Pinball duo of Jack Guarnieri and Butch Peel.

Butch Peel

While Butch controlled the slideshow, Jack talked about his early years in the business, how he formed Jersey Jack Pinball, the company’s first four titles – *The Wizard of Oz*, *The Hobbit*, *Dialed In!* and *Pirates of the Caribbean*.  He spoke about the visitors he has at the factory and how his choice of licenses is made, with the emphasis on selecting family-friendly themes.

**Sunday**

Maybe it was the wet weather, but whatever the reason Sunday turned out to be the busiest day of all at the show.

There were two main events taking place on Sunday.  First, at 3pm the draw for the grand prize of a new-in-box Iron Maiden pinball took place.

Tickets for this had been sold at the front desk all three days, at a price of $20 each.  Mike Kalinowski of Homepin helped Tommy Floyd with the draw.

[![Mike holds the bag of tickets while Tommy draws a winner](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/087-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018-1024x685.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/vancouver-flipout-expo-2018/087-vancouver-flipout-expo-2018.jpg)

There were multiple tournaments held over the show’s three days and the extended qualifying session on Thursday, but the main one was the Modern Tournament which reached its conclusion on Sunday afternoon.

There were two divisions – Open and Novice, with the Open being exactly that and the Novice for those with IFPA rankings below 2,500.  Both used the Drains Tournament Manager system for qualifying and play-offs, with the full results being available [online here](https://www.neverdrains.com/vfo2018/).

The winner of the Open Division was current World Champion, Raymond Davidson, who was top qualifier and won two of the three games in the final. In second place was Johnny Modica, while third and fourth were decided by a play-off, with Colin Urban winning and Mike Tzanakos ending in fourth.

This was our first tie visiting the Vancouver Flipout Pinball Expo in person, so we couldn’t do a direct comparison between this year’s show at the Roundhouse and the earlier two shows at the Holiday Inn, but it was clear that the move to the new venue was sorely-needed given the number of machines.  Even with 115 pinballs set up, organiser Tommy was turning away around 30 more due to lack of available space for them.  Of course, more machines also means more problems and so more technical help needed, but there was no lack of helpers who could regularly be seen with their heads buried inside a game, bringing it back to life.

Although there were food trucks outside the hall, there were also plenty of local stores providing a wide range of refreshments.  We seemed to spend most of our mealtimes in Urban Craft across the street which served excellent, good value food, had a wide assortment of fruit, vegetables and delicatessen items, and served hot drinks, beer and cider, even having a happy hour from 4pm each day.  Meanwhile, just a couple of minutes away were two streets packed with bars and restaurants.  With such a choice, it was probably only the rain which persuaded show guests to take advantage of the food trucks.

Having the three seminars on Saturday was a useful diversion from the show floor.  The attendance wasn’t the greatest despite Tommy providing free pizza in the theatre, but for the devoted pinball fans there was a lot of useful and interesting information imparted as we hope you can see and hear in our recordings above.

There was also an impressive selection of tournaments run by Dave Stewart, Germain Mariolle, and Rob Moller, which multiple divisions for all skill levels, ages and sexes.  There were too many for us to cover in full, but you can find player rankings, qualifying standings and final results for a number of them on the [VPO2018 page at NeverDrains.com](https://www.neverdrains.com/vfo2018/playerIndex.php).

All of which concludes our coverage of this year’s Vancouver Flipout Pinball Expo.  We hope you enjoyed our four days of reports and we look forward to returning to Vancouver next year for an even bigger show.
