Haggis Pinball today confirmed what had long been suspected – that their second ‘Revisited’ title after *Fathom* would be *Centaur*.

*Centaur Revisited* will be available in two limited-edition versions.

The Beast Edition will have a maximum of 250 units made at a price of AU$15,000 (US$10,024/€9,198/£7,884) plus applicable sales taxes.

The Oblivion Edition is limited to just 50 units at a price of AU$25,000 (US$16,702/€15,341/£13,139) plus the same sales taxes.

Both prices include free shipping within Australia and free shipping of a complete container of 40 games to Planetary Pinball in the US, for onward delivery at cost.

The two versions of Centaur Revisited – Beast Edition and Oblivion Edition

The Beast edition is the lower-end model, but still includes many enhancements over the original Bally game, including two apron LCD screens, a topper, mirrored chrome metalwork, RGB LED lighting and displays and both original and ‘2.0’ game code.

The Beast Edition

One of the unique features of the original Centaur was its largely monochromatic playfield artwork, except for coloured insert and text. The Beast Edition keeps much of this styling, but adds more vivid red accents to the playfield plastics thanks to the pre-installed plastic protectors.

The Beast Edition’s playfield

The Oblivion Edition moves away from the pure black-and-white playfield, offering the option of colourised artwork and plastics.
