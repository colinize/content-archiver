After much trailing over the past few weeks Jersey Jack Pinball revealed their sixth title, *Guns N’ Roses*, based on their *Not In This Lifetime*… world tour which ran from 2016-2019.

The company had avoided revealing the title of their new release although it was widely known to be a music based on the popular band featuring Axl Rose, Slash, Duff McKagan, Dizzy Reed, Richard Fortus, Frank Ferrer and Melissa Reese.

As shown in the tease images, the game is designed by Eric Meunier with assistance from GnR guitarist Slash who is a well-known pinball fan and collaborated on the original Data East *Guns N’ Roses* game.

As with previous JJP titles, there are three models of the new title – Standard, Limited Edition and Collectors Edition. There will be a maximum of 500 Collectors Edition machines produced while the Limited Edition is limited to 5,000 units. There’s no limit on the Standard Edition.

The Standard edition features cartoon-style cabinet artwork, while the Premium shows arrangements of tour posters. The Collectors Edition, meanwhile, returns to a cartoon design. The Limited Edition includes red cabinet trim while the Collectors Edition has a purple finish.

The new *Guns N’ Roses ‘Not In This Lifetime’* pinball game is made for players, collectors, and newcomers to pinball and is available now.  An avid pinball collector and longtime player, SLASH worked hands-on with Jersey Jack Pinball designer Eric Meunier for over two years, to develop the *Guns N’ Roses ‘Not In This Lifetime’* game.  As co-designer, SLASH crafted specific game plays and actions, recorded guitar riffs, music, voice, and video for the new game as well as, four unique guitar features for four playable modesin the game.   Pinball designer Eric Meunier is widely known as the designer of one of the best-selling pinball games of all time, *Pirates of The Caribbean*, which currently sells for $5-7,000.00 over its original asking price.   With the new game offering the greatest rock and roll experience under glass, super-fans will now have a chance to own a piece of highly collectible rock and roll memorabilia.  “*It’s been a very fulfilling experience working with Jersey Jack on the new GNR Not in This Lifetime pinball machine,*” says SLASH. “*Jersey Jack pinball games are some of the most unique and beautiful pins ever made and I am honored to have been able to work with their brilliant team to design one of the most original and exciting rock n roll pins ever produced.*“  “*To have this type of design work and participation from the game’s namesake creating the actual pinball game, has never, ever, been done before in the industry,*” adds Jersey Jack Pinball designer Eric Meunier.  A playable work of art, the Guns N’ Roses pinball game merges the latest in sound, video, and design with groundbreaking new technology, elevating classic American Pinball to an immersive, one-of-a-kind experience. The kinetic game brings together the band’s powerhouse live performance, signature sound and wild stage elements, all from their colossal *Not In This Lifetime* world tour which is now the third highest-grossing concert outing of all time.
