The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland Ohio USA opened its latest special exhibit with a visit on July 11th by shock rocker Alice Cooper (born Vincent Damon Furnier) and drummer Neal Smith who was featured on songs such as Billion Dollar Babies.

The exhibition is titled *Part of the Machine: Rock and Pinball* and explores the link between rock and roll and pinball games.

Cooper is an avid pinball enthusiast and collector; among the games in the Hall of Fame interactive exhibition that are available for visitors to play is *Alice Cooper’s Nightmare Castle* released earlier in 2018 by Spooky Pinball.

“*Rock and pinball have a lot in common,*” said Karen Herman, the Rock Hall’s Vice President of Collections and Curatorial Affairs, “*Both are loud, colorful and rebellious. And both were once* *considered corrupters of youth.*”

Pinball was banned in many US cities until the mid-1970s because it was considered gambling. But once those prohibitions were lifted, the images of scantily clad women, baseball and cars that adorned the earlier machines gave way to licensed images from popular culture — including rock and roll stars.

“*The images on the machines are works of art,*” said Herman. “*They’re like album covers and they tell a story.*”
