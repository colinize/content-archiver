EventCity in Manchester

Although the show didn’t open until the next day, we were here for the set-up so we can get a preview of what’s in store for the thousands of visitors who will line up outside the following morning.

With the public entrance closed, we headed round the back to the loading bays to get in.

The rear of EventCity – our way in

Heading into the main hall we found work well underway on setting up the scores of pinballs expected at the show, as well as the thousands of square metres of games of all kinds.

The pinball zone at Play Expo

The organisers of the pinball zone – Northern Lights Pinball – were expecting more than 100 pinballs, and with many machines already here they were confident of reaching that target.

[![There is a good mix of older and the very newest titles](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2016/24.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2016/24.jpg)

There was a good mix of older and the very newest titles

The newest titles were there courtesy of Pinball Heaven who had the latest offerings from Stern, Jersey Jack and Chicago Gaming, as well as some restored games.

Before it is allowed to be played, each machine has to be tested for electrical safety (PAT tested).

There was also a nice line-up of Gottlieb solid-state machines here, including several lesser-spotted varieties.

The tombola is always a popular part of the show

As important as it is, the Pinball Zone is only a small part of Play Expo, so let’s have a quick look around the rest of the hall.

The Play Expo show opened to the public at 10am on Saturday, and as usual there was a large crowd queueing outside eager to get through the doors.

[![The queue outside just before opening time](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2016/75.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2016/75.jpg)

It didn’t take long before the aisles between the pinball machines became crowded and all the machines were occupied.

There were three competition machines amongst the mix. A Shrek was the junior high score machine, with a No Good Gofers next to it performing the same role for the adult event. A William’s Heat Wave was used for the EM Challenge, where players vied to either achieve the day’s highest score, or raise the temperature high enough to ‘Blow Your Top’ and win a cash prize.

Making a return after its first outing at last year’s show was the Addams Family Challenge shock chair. Players sit in the chair and use the control handles to flip the flippers, but achieving certain objectives produces unexpected results from the chair’s lighting and sound effects, shaker motors and smoke machine.

It’s harder than it looks, but at least one player managed it

A predicted, the tombola stand was especially popular, with any ticket number ending in a 5 winning a prize. Tickets cost £1 for three, £5 for eighteen or £10 for forty.

While it was obviously our favourite bit, the Pinball Zone was a relatively small part of the overall Play Expo show.

So let’s have a quick look at some of the other stands and exhibits.

Right next door to the pinballs in other half of the Arcade Zone were the arcade video games.
