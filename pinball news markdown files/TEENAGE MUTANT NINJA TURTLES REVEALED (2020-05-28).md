Although the theme for Stern Pinball’s next release had been widely reported, the timing of the game’s launch was less certain.

Originally planned to be announced shortly after the Texas Pinball Festival in March and shown at the Midwest Gaming Classic the following weekend, the launch plans were thrown in the air by the impact of the Coronavirus on the pinball industry. The two shows were cancelled for 2020 and pinball manufacturing shut down, denying both a platform for the launch and the ability to actually build the games.

Now, pinball manufacturing has resumed – albeit with reduced capacity – so Stern Pinball have wasted no time in kickstarting their delayed launch of *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* (called *TMNT* from now on).

As usual, this latest release comes in three variants – Pro, Premium and a Limited Edition with a maximum of 500 units. Each has a different cabinet/backbox art package with the LE getting a mirrored backglass rather than the translites found in the Pro and Premium.

Let’s start with the *TMNT* Pro.

The front of the Pro model

The artwork for all three models comes from Jeremy Packer, a.k.a. Zombie Yeti, who previously created art for several games for Stern Pinball, including *Ghostbusters*, *Deadpool*, *Primus* and *Iron Maiden*.

The front of the Limited Edition model

Here are the three models side-by-side. As with all pictures on the website, you can click on this to enlarge it.

The Pro, Premium and LE models

So, that’s the exterior artwork. Now let’s look at the playfields on the three models. As in earlier Stern titles, the playfield gameplay features are the same on the Premium and Limited Edition models, while the Pro has a very similar design with some cost-reduction resulting in missing or simplified mechanisms.

To see the full set of features, we’ll start with the Premium/LE playfield and then see what is missing or different in the Pro.

[![The Premium model's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/058-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-650x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/058-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The Premium model’s playfield

Our first example is the playfield’s bottom arch which is black plastic on the Pro, but black powder-coated steel with illuminated panels on the Premium and LE. The LE also gets game designer John Borg’s signature above the instruction card.

[![The instruction card area on the bottom arch on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/032-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/032-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The instruction card area on the bottom arch on the Premium

[![John Borg's signature on the bottom arch of the LE model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/083-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/083-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

John Borg’s signature on the bottom arch of the LE model

All three versions of *TMNT* are three-flippered games, with the third flipper half-way up on the left side. There is a difference with the number of balls installed in the models, with the Premium and LE using eight balls while the Pro cuts that to six.

[![The two main flippers on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/034-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/034-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The two main flippers on the Premium

[![The upper flipper on the Limited Edition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/079-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/079-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The upper flipper on the Limited Edition

Starting at the bottom of the playfield, there are two inlanes on the left side with the outer lane also being the end of the left and right ramp return.

[![The two left inlanes and the ramp return](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/035-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/035-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The two left inlanes and the ramp return

The left outlane can be lit for Battle Again which launches a new ball into play to replace the drained one.

Above the left outlane is the L-A-I-R target. Rather than have individual targets – either drop targets or standups – for each L-A-I-R letter, this is a long single target with leaf switches at either end which adds a letter when any part of it is hit.

[![The L-A-I-R standup target on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/038-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/038-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The L-A-I-R standup target on the Premium

Behind the L-A-I-R target is a lane accessed by a shot under the raised upper flipper.

[![The training mode start lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/037-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/037-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The training mode start lane

The ball can be held in this lane while a training mode intro is played, before being released to the inlane.

Above the upper flipper is the left entrance to the orbit lane.

[![The left orbit entrance is above the upper flipper](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/085-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/085-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The left orbit entrance is above the upper flipper

Next comes the left ramp entrance, which features small upright standup targets either side.

[![The left ramp on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/046-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/046-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The left ramp on the Premium

On the Pro the ramp sign only indicates when the ramp is lit for training, whereas on the Premium and LE it can build the glider value too.

[![Training and Build Glider can both be lit on the left ramp on the Premium/LE](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/081-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/081-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

Training and Build Glider can both be lit on the left ramp on the Premium/LE

The left ramp disappears behind the back panel, emerging to the right and crossing the ramp entrance to deposit the ball in the left inlane.

Before the ball gets that far though, on the Pro model there is a Stop & Score ball blocker which operates on both the ramp return wireforms.

[![The Stop & Score ramp blocker](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/025-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/025-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro.jpg)

The Stop & Score ramp blocker

The blocker is pulled down by a solenoid to temporarily stop the ball on the ramp. When released it pops back up and the ball continues.

On the Premium and LE playfields though, there is an different Glider device which allows the player to divert the ball from one ramp return to the other, letting them choose at which flipper the ball ends up.

[![The ball diverter on the Premium and LE playfields](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/071-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/071-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The ball diverter on the Premium and LE playfields

When activated by pressing the action button on the lock bar, it turns one way or the other to divert the ball onto the adjacent ramp return.

[![The ball is diverted to the right wireform](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/069-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/069-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The ball is diverted to the right wireform

The Glider actually has five possible positions which also allow it to stop the ball in the same way as the ball stopper on the Pro model.

Directly in front of the left ramp entrance is the spinning pizza disc. This operates like the spinning disc on Twister and the Premium/LE versions of X-Men, having a magnet core in the centre which can grab balls at the start of multiball, spin them around at 400 RPM, and then release them so they fly off in multiple directions.

[![The magnet in the centre of the spinning disc grabs a ball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/063-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/063-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The magnet in the centre of the spinning disc grabs a ball

The disc and magnet can also be used to further randomise the ball’s movement.

There is a subtle difference between the spinning disc on the Pro and the Premium/LE. On the Pro the disc only spins one way, but in the Premium and LE is can spin in either direction. The game flyers for the Premium and LE state that all models have a disc ‘capable’ of spinning in either direction, and the motor used in the disc mechanism is very likely the same, but the flyer for the Pro says it only spins in one direction.

To the right of the left ramp is the Ninja Pizza Parlor. This is a three-ball lock mechanism which ejects balls into the left orbit lane.

[![The Ninja Pizza Parlour is to the right of the left ramp](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/027-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/027-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro.jpg)

The Ninja Pizza Parlor is to the right of the left ramp

There is a trick where the upper flipper is automatically raised to direct the released balls onto the spinning disc which grabs them.

[![Three balls are grabbed before the disc spins and the balls are released](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/062-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/062-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

Three balls are grabbed before the disc spins and the balls are released

Mounted above the Ninja Pizza Parlor lane is the Party Wagon.

[![The Party Wagon on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/016-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/016-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro.jpg)

The Party Wagon on the Pro model

Although it looks the same, this is another device which works differently in the Pro and Premium/LE models.

In the Pro, the wagon is a static device featuring a single-ball lock behind, whereas the Premium/LE wagon incorporates a four-ball lock with the balls being released into the Ninja Pizza Parlor lane by the wagon door opening.

[![The Party Wagon door  opens on the Premium and LE models](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/065-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/065-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The Party Wagon door opens on the Premium and LE models

[![The locked balls are released from the Party Wagon](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/067-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/067-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The locked balls are released from the Party Wagon

To the right of the Party Wagon is the pop bumper area.

There are three pop bumpers, fed by two rollover lanes at the top of the playfield. The ball can get here either from the right orbit lane or from the inner orbit shot which is made by the upper flipper. In both cases, a stop post in the orbit lane blocks the ball, causing it to roll back into the rollover lanes.

[![The pop bumper area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/084-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/084-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The pop bumper area

Above the pop bumpers in the Premium and LE models is an animated Krang toy, but that it missing in the Pro.

[![The Krang toy on the Premium and LE models](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/076-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/076-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The Krang toy on the Premium and LE models

To the bottom-right of the pop bumpers is the inner orbit lane. This feeds the ball into the outer orbit lane at the top of the playfield for a return feed to the upper flipper. It can also, as we just said, feed the top rollover lanes and pop bumpers if the stop post activates.

[![The inner orbit lane on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/007-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/007-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro.jpg)

The inner orbit lane on the Pro model

Below the inner orbit is the side ramp which returns the ball, via a wireform, to the right inlane. As with the left ramp, the ball’s journey can be interrupted by the ball blocker on the Pro or transferred to the left wireform if the Glider is activated by the player using the action button.

[![The ball diverter sends the ball onto the left wireform when activated](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/070-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/070-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The ball diverter sends the ball onto the left wireform when activated

Below the side ramp is a standup target which awards more time much like the one in Tommy. Then we come to the right ramp.

[![The right ramp on the Limited Edition model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/092-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/092-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-le.jpg)

The right ramp on the Limited Edition model

The right ramp normally feeds the ball to the left orbit lane and to the upper flipper, but there appears to be a diverter mechanism behind the back panel which might feed the ball to the Party Wagon instead. We will look for confirmation of this.

The right orbit lane is next, and this includes the game’s only spinner.

[![The right orbit lane on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/050-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/050-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The right orbit lane on the Premium

To the right of the right orbit is a large plastic mounted over the shooter lane. This features the four turtles and allows the player to choose which turtle they wish to be at the start of the game.

[![The turtle selection plastic over the shooter lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/013-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/013-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-pro.jpg)

The turtle selection plastic over the shooter lane

The chosen turtle gives certain ‘power-ups’ to boost scoring and help complete certain features.

Below the right orbit lane entrance is the A-P-R-I-L standup target.

[![The A-P-R-I-L target on the Premium's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/048-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/048-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The A-P-R-I-L target on the Premium’s playfield

Like the L-A-I-R target on the left side, this acts as one single target, despite having leaf switches at either end. Completing A-P-R-I-L lights the ball save in the left outlane as well as other features.

The bottom-right corner has just a single inlane leading to the right flipper.

[![The right inlane on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/036-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/036-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-premium.jpg)

The right inlane on the Premium

Which takes us back to the flippers, above which are a series of unlabelled status inserts to show your progress through the game.

New to *TMNT* is gameplay mode which allows users to choose various ways to play the game before they begin.

Cooperative Mode allows features and progress to carry across from player to player. The multiball locks, modes completed and enemies defeated carry over, making progress through the game easier, while wizard modes are playable by all players.

Team play brings back the combined scores of players 1 & 3 versus players 2 & 4 which was previously only operator-selectable on pre-LCD titles. Variations of team play are also available allowing two or three players to compete against one, something suitable for families or competitive challenges. Competition mode is also available from the gameplay mode menu.

Gary Stern sent a new-style e-mail to promote the game, along with the regular press release and the feature matrix.

| Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  Across the world, pinball customers have stayed at home, I’m sure playing pinball. After weeks and months of our customers staying at home and now some places slowly opening, what could the pinball market need more than a beautiful, light hearted, fun cornerstone pinball?  Stern Pinball brings you that new, fun cornerstone pinball based on a fantasy comic created nearly 4 decades ago, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It is impossible for any of us, or your customers, not to have been bombarded with TMNT. From the original 1984 comic book, Turtles was developed into its first television cartoon series 3 years later. A total of 4 animated and 1 live action television Turtles series have been on network television and syndication, the latest still running. Six TMNT movies have been shown theatrically and digitally throughout the world, with one as recently as 2016. A 7th is in development. There have been too many TMNT video games and other products to count. You can even ride TMNT rollercoasters at Mall of American and American Dream Meadowlands.  Those of you with a long history in the coin op game business remember Konami’s great 1989 and 1991 Turtles video games. If you haven’t been in our business that long, or if your memory is failing, go to a Bar Arcade to see Millennials and Gen Z’s playing those Konami games. You may see them playing our Data East TMNT 1991 pinball too.  My younger daughter Lindsey, now a millennial, grew up with TMNT – Lindsey’s parents bribed her with every TMNT product we could find. I lived with Turtle Power. Lindsey still does.  Because so many people grew up with the Turtles – from the younger of the Baby Boomers and Gen X’s down to Millennials and Gen Z’s – everything TMNT is collectible. Having been loved by people of all ages, TMNT is a great for the family, and it will be great for the out of home players too.  I am so excited about TMNT, I brought a sample game home. As I write this sitting at my home desk, I look at the game in my living room. It is bright and happy, with art and original LCD animation based on the look and feel of the early Turtles series that your older buyers remember best. Look at the attached game pictures. Fantastic. We complemented this look with the original 1987 theme music and 17 characters speaking.  I could write about the features and devices on Turtles – its smooth shooting ramps, 3 flippers, use of RGB LED’s, color changing General Illumination LED’s, spinning target, coil actuated posts, many multiballs (great for me), and much more. I could write about the its depth and breadth for all player levels – its 8 episode modes, 2 multiballs, 2 hurry ups, 1 mini-mode, 3 training modes, and 3 wizard multiball modes. You can read TMNT contents on the attached Feature Matrix. Better, play TMNT.  But I have to ask – what would a TMNT pinball be without a pizza? Our game has a spinning disc pizza with a center magnet, capable of catching 3 balls and slinging them over the playfield for wild pinball action.    At the beginning of the game, the player picks which Turtle he wants to be – Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. Game features and powers differ depending on which Turtle selected. Pick different Turtles to make game play new and different again. I usually pick Donatello. You will have to play TMNT to see why.  New in pinball is Turtle’s training mode. In this feature, the game will highlight game play areas for the player to shoot, teaching the player to achieve greater levels with perks for each level.  I have a TMNT Pro at home. I wish I had an LE/Premium. The LE/Premium starts with a unique steel ramp at the ball shooter, feeding the Turtle Power ramp and loading the Turtles custom molded van. Unlike the Pro that holds one ball behind the van to start 4 ball Turtle Power multiball, the LE/Premium actually locks 4 balls (Turtles) inside. Ninja Pizza Power multiball locks 3 balls in all versions, but the LE/Premium multiball can be up to 8 balls vs max of 6 for the Pro. The LE/Premium has a custom molded Glider atop a player controlled diverter to choose ball path on ramps. A custom molded Krang is coil operated. And the spinning pizza disc on the Le/Premium changes directions, rotating both counter-clockwise and clockwise, adding great ball play.  The 500 LE’s of course have: High gloss Sour Apple Green powder coat armor and legs Mirrored backglass LE only inside art blades Upgraded audio system Shaker motor Non-glare playfield glass Certificate of authenticity signed by me Designer autographed name plate Serialized number plate  Illinois’ Governor said he plans to allow full production to commence May 29th. We are preparing to start TMNT Pro production, with shipping beginning the 2nd week of June. LE production will begin later in June, followed in July by the Premium.  Prices of TMNT models remain unchanged from our last game. As in the past, LE models require a $2,000 deposit and full payment before shipment, with no 2% CIA discount. Fees also are the same to specify an LE number, if available.   Attached is a press release along with the photos and feature matrix I already mentioned.   Jack Danger will stream Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Premium Wednesday night, May 27 at 5pm. Friday night, May 29, also at 5pm, Jack will stream TMNT Pro. View Jack’s stream at [https://www.twitch.tv/deadflip](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001-NMyVC9dy4taN60UHOTkQmtLBKRjVO9HBQVBWBJYjKHVj9bAmgqu9Lr3o5qeSY3jxnY1v1d1wgnx-wgWGFWjbRmFE_aL9hLJV3nyfEAO__qHPp_CUgfChQzmGlQeAvY0wJxWZ47HDQSoctISnDcaNQ==&c=rMwIYbeQUD_jqA3ZnMh87hBvINzO7VOcgJuT3z_nPYgCVbVnULRyxA==&ch=Hg2DGk4Chu81yLSX5ydSCbBFdEGA4qS4JCFevf7KrCfu5ARX5AGAmg==)  I am writing this on Monday, Memorial Day. I have written enough. I have to play the TMNT in my living room. Lindsey came by and is playing; she loves the game. I have to beat her.
