Dennis Nordman’s and Greg Freres’s joint-venture company, WhizBang Pinball, shot to prominence in October 2009 when the first title created by the duo was first announced at Pinball Expo.

*Whoa Nellie! Sweet Juicy Melons* was originally intended to be a short run of hand-built custom conversions of the game *Continental Cafe*, but as ‘*Sweet Juicy Melons*‘ became ‘*Big Juicy Melons*‘, the potential for the game also grew.

In 2015 Stern Pinball began producing the game for the mass market. The now fully electronic game was cosmetically very similar to the original look of the prototype, but was fully lit by LEDs and used Stern’s new SPIKE control system.

Dennis and Greg had recently said they had no plans yet for a follow-up to the game, but Stern Pinball have now announced that the pair is to create a game in conjunction with Stern in 2017.

No details of the theme, whether it will be licensed or not, or the style of game have been announced, but Stern Pinball say it will be designed “in the fun, campy style for which the Whizbang team is known”.

Greg currently heads up the art department at Stern, while Dennis is working on a number of projects at home while also assisting the Silver Castle Pinball team with their Timeshock! game.

Here’s what Stern Pinball had to say when announcing the collaboration:
