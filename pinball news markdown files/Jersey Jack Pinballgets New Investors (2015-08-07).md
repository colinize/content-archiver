The three have been revealed as Leonard Abess, Andrew Paul and Scott Flanders.

Leonard Abess is Chairman and Executive Officer of ThinkLab Ventures based in Miami, Florida and is the former majority owner of City National Bank of Florida, which he sold in 2008 for $927m. He was voted Reader's Digest's America's Top Boss after using $60m of the proceeds to give bonuses to all of the 399 staff at the bank.  His generosity was acclaimed by President Obama in his State of the Nation speech.

Andrew Paul is General Counsel and Managing Director of Tudor Investment Corporation, an asset management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut.  The company manages assets worth in excess of $14bn.

The third member of the group is Scott Flanders, who became CEO of Playboy Enterprises in 2009.  He is a former CEO of Macmillan Publishing and CEO of Columbia House Company, the world's oldest and largest direct seller of music and video products.

The three have teamed up to invest in Jersey Jack Pinball in a deal which should provide a stable financial foundation for the company and is a vote of confidence in President and CEO of JJP Jack Guarnieri. Jack told Pinball News that the three investors are all pinball people and customers of the company.  However he denied that Scott's involvement with Playboy Enterprises meant another Playboy pinball is on the way from JJP.

Here's the company's press release:
