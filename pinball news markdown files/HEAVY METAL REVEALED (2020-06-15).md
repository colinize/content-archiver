Stern Pinball and Incendium’s Heavy Metal pinball

The title has been trailed before and was due to launch just as the Coronavirus lockdown hit and pinball production largely closed down.

So, *Heavy Metal*‘s launch was delayed until today, although the game won’t actually ship until late-November or December, 2020.

A collaboration between *Heavy Metal* magazine’s publisher, Incendium, and Stern Pinball, the game features some attractive and colourful original artwork featuring warrior heroine, Taarna, and the undead tailgunner, Nelson.

The cabinet trim features a colour-changing galaxy black metallic paint, while inside we find artworked ‘blades’ lining the cabinet sides.

The game celebrates the 300th issue of *Heavy Metal* magazine and comes with a unique custom cover version of the magazine.

The playfield design though is not as unique as the rest of the game, featuring a tweaked version of the *Star Wars Pin* home model design.

The Heavy Metal playfield

We can compare this to the playfield for the *Star Wars Pin* home game.

Star Wars Pin’s playfield

Rather than collecting movie characters, *Heavy Metal* requires players to experience the four genres associated with Heavy Metal – Fantasy, Horror, Metal and Sci-Fi. *Heavy Metal* also includes a full coin door, allowing commercial operation.

Obviously, the Death Star and Tie Fighter at the top of the two ramps have been replaced with models of Nelson and Taarna, with the F-O-R-C-E standup targets now spell H-E-A-V-Y.

Pleasingly, *Heavy Metal* includes original music from Sebastian Bach, Brendon Small, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick and others – something seen as essential for a *Heavy Metal*-themed game.

The price of the game is $7,999, but this is a limited-edition built-to-order model which will only be available in 2020 and includes a ‘White Glove’ service with delivery and home set-up by an installer, although that’s only available in mainland USA.

While production will be by Stern Pinball, sales and promotions will be by Incendium, and the game currently needs to be ordered through [their website](https://incendium.online/collections/all/products/pinball).

Here’s how the two companies announced the game:
