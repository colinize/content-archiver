**Date:**
October 2016

**Location:**
Various, Chicago, IL, USA

**There is a large selection of pinball machines on location in the Chicago area thanks to the continued popularity of barcades.**

Here are the ones I have enjoyed visiting so far.

Some of the sites articles are by M.G.Brown.  [Pinballmap.com](http://pinballmap.com) has many more pin locations listed on their website.
