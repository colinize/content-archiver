As usual, it reveals nothing about the game itself other than the title, but all will be revealed very soon with a small number of Limited Edition models being available to purchase through through the Stern Store for paid members of the company’s All-Access programme on 4th January, 2024.

Stern Pinball have announced a schedule for their reveal of the three models. The Limited Edition is the first to be shown on Thursday, followed by the Premium and the Pro.
