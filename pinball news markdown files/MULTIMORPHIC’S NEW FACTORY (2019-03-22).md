**Location:** 6 Indian Meadows Drive, Round Rock, TX 78665, USA

When production of [Multimorphic’s](https://www.multimorphic.com/) P3 pinball platform began, the assembly was undertaken by a contract manufacturer. Now all the pre-orders have been fulfilled, current and future machines will be built in Multimorphic’s new facility in Round Rock, Texas.

The Multimorphic factory in Round Rock, Texas

Inside the 5,000 square feet building nearly all the floor space is used for game manufacturing. Everyone works on the floor, so there are no offices and only a solitary meeting room.

An overview of the Multimorphic factory unit

Game construction uses multiple parts and sub-assemblies built either in-house or coming in from external suppliers. Deliveries have to be inspected, checked and measured before they become stock items.

Some parts are 3D printed in the factory. During our visit, they were making fan housings for the magnets on the Cosmic Cart Racing playfield module.

Playfield modules can be bought separately, so these are assembled in the factory too.

[![Separate upper playfield modules for Cosmic Cart Racing](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/multimorphic-visit-2019/16-multimorphic-visit-2019-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/multimorphic-visit-2019/16-multimorphic-visit-2019.jpg)

Separate upper playfield modules for Cosmic Cart Racing

So far, Multimorphic have three upper playfield modules – Lexy Lightspeed, Cannon Lagoon and Cosmic Cart Racing – along with their associated games, but they are working on a fourth which will only be revealed once it is available to buy

[![The mysterious fourth playfield module](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/multimorphic-visit-2019/15-multimorphic-visit-2019-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/multimorphic-visit-2019/15-multimorphic-visit-2019-1024x683.jpg)

Some of the games available on the P3 platform

When we visited we got to play the new four-player head-to-head Cosmic Cart Racing using the two machines above plus two more elsewhere in the factory.

The head-to-head play will allow machines across the world to play together through an internet connection to the Multimorphic servers. It is this connection which enables owners to download new games and updates

[![Like the monitors and speakers, the packing material is stored overhead](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/multimorphic-visit-2019/19-multimorphic-visit-2019-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/multimorphic-visit-2019/19-multimorphic-visit-2019.jpg)

That concludes our look at the Multimorphic factory, but you can hear company head, Gerry Stellenberg, talk about the new facility, the reasons for the move, how the machines are built and plans for the future in a special bonus edition of our joint podcast with Jonathan Joosten of Pinball Magazine.

The Multimorphic facility

Thanks to Gerry and the Multimorphic team.

As we were visiting, they were loading up their van to take games to the Texas Pinball Festival where they will be demonstrating the linked four-player Cosmic Cart Racing game as well as many of their other titles.

You will be able to see their stand in our extensive TPF 2019 show coverage.
