After several years of development, [Deeproot Pinball](https://deeprootpinball.com/) have started taking orders for their first release game, *Retro Atomic Zombie Adventureland* or *RAZA*.

The RAZA playfield

Although three RAZA models were initially announced – Arcade, X Edition and Xtra Edition, the middle option has been dropped, leaving buyers the choice of the Arcade or Xtra.

The two models available to order

The price of the Arcade model starts at $5,899 while the Xtra comes in at $9,499. Both have a range of optional extras available to purchase when ordering.

The Arcade model of RAZA

The Xtra comes with most of the options pre-installed, while the Arcade can be upgraded with the same metalwork finish, neon rubber rings, shaker motor, playfield toys, lighting package, anti-reflective glass and topper.

The Xtra model of RAZA

Adding all the extras brings the total up to around $7,900, but the Xtra model still includes a number of exclusive features such as the ‘floating’ backbox design, additional front speakers, illuminated cabinet side panels and the moving Ned toy on the playfield. The Xtra is also limited to 300 machines while the Arcade’s numbers aren’t restricted.

Both the Arcade and the Xtra *RAZA* models have the option of a pre-installed protector for the lockbar-mounted Pinbar’s screen ($90) and a collapsible wooden shipping container dubbed the Pinpod ($950/$550 for the Arcade/Xtra). If ordered, the game will be shipped in the Pinpod rather than a cardboard box.

Although Deeproot Pinball initially vowed not to take pre-order payments on their titles, full up-front payment is an option along with the alternative of paying a 10% (Arcade) or 20% (Xtra) non-refundable deposit instead. Paying in full gives priority when the games start shipping, while the top-end Xtra models are given priority over orders for the Arcade models.

Orders through the [Deeproot Pinball website](https://deeprootpinball.com/shop/machines/retro-atomic-zombie-adventureland/editions) are only being taken between 8th December and 30th December, 2020. Although no distributors have been announced, several are understood to have signed agreements and *RAZA* machines are expected to be available for order from them beyond the 30th December deadline.

Along with the on-line shop, [several videos](https://deeprootpinball.com/about/videos) showing *RAZA*‘s gameplay and features are now on the Deeproot Pinball site, along with a demonstration of the Pinpod, some promotional videos and the company’s head, Robert Mueller, giving his reasons for starting Deeproot Pinball.

Soon after the new website and ordering process launched, Robert spoke at length to Pinball News’s Martin Ayub and Pinball Magazine’s Jonathan Joosten to explain why the game is being made available now, when orders are expected to ship, how and where they will be built, and which titles are coming next, along with many other details of both the game and the company.
