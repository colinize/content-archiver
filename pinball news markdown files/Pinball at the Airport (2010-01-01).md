Back in January 2010 Michael Schiess told the story of how the Pacific Pinball Museum worked with San Francisco Airport Museum to create a pinball exhibition within the airport concourse.

Now, pinball has returned to San Francisco Airport, but in a rather less conventional form.

Meet... Lobby Launch pinball.

Lobby Launch pinball

Lobby Launch is a touch-screen video pinball game created to promote the Courtyard by Marriott hotel chain.  Players can check in, explore the hotel's facilities and add days to their stay on the seven foot, nine screen game.

Playing Lobby Launch

Players launch the ball by pressing on the plunger, then press on the two touch pad flipper buttons to flip.  Lose the ball though, and it's check out time.

The playfield

Scores can be linked to the Lobby Launch Facebook page and Twitter feed which gives the opportunity to win up to $500 in Courtyard gift cards for the top players, and the chance to have your picture appear on the high score wall.

This game was spotted in Terminal 3 of San Francisco Airport at gate 85, but it is also installed at Atlanta Hartsfield, Denver, Miami and Seattle-Tacoma airports.  Details of the locations in each airport are also on the Facebook page.
