The show features both video games and pinball machines, an while classic home and arcade video games are a big part of the event, pinball machines seem to be the biggest feature of the show. Almost every new pinball machine title is at the show, plus rows of older pins.

Buying a pre-show ticket for Friday night was very nice because the giant third floor hall – where the pins were – was lightly attended. It was easy to play all the new and older pins. I was told that on Saturday the place gets very crowded with gamers.

There is another hall on the second floor and a vendor hall that is open on Saturday and Sunday.

It was much more crowded than the Friday pre-show, but even with that much larger crowd it was fairly easy to play a desired game.

The second floor of the Wisconsin Center building held 14 smaller rooms of mostly video games. Arcade Legends in DeKalb IL and Galloping Ghost in Brookfield IL each filled a room with games from their arcades.

The quantity, quality and variety of pins at the MGC was incredible. I look forward to going back next year.
