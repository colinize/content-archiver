Tom Kopera, Stern Pinball’s new Director of Mechanical Engineering

Tom is no stranger to coin-op, pinball or indeed Stern, having been brought into Midway Games to help design video games by a certain George Gomez, now Stern Pinball’s EVP and Chief Creative Officer.

When George moved to Williams/Bally to design pinballs, Tom joined him there as a Mechanical Engineer to create mechanisms such as the ball-catching, moving glove on *Johnny Mnemonic* and the [basketball shooter device](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=20&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=%22Kopera+Thomas%22&OS=%22Kopera+Thomas%22&RS=%22Kopera+Thomas%22) in *NBA Fastbreak*. When Williams were looking for a new game designer prior to the launch of their Pinball 2000 platform, Tom teamed up with Matt Coriale to create *Cactus Canyon* which was to be the company’s final traditional-style game before the Pinball 2000 format was adopted.

When Williams closed their pinball division, Tom moved to their gaming division designing top box and [interactive features for their slot machine](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=Kopera+Thomas&FIELD1=&co1=AND&TERM2=&FIELD2=&d=PTXT).

Tom has also worked extensively under contract at Stern Pinball where he designed *The Rolling Stones*, created the metal backbox and display panel designs which are currently used in all Stern’s games, designed all their toppers up to *The Munsters* and project engineered their *The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball* and *Elvira’s House of Horrors* titles.

As Stern Pinball’s Director or Mechanical Engineering Tom will not only head-up the Mechanical Engineering section but also be in charge of the Whitewood Lab, the Model Shop, and the Bill of Materials Group. His new appointment begins with immediate effect.

Here’s Stern Pinball’s announcement of Tom’s appointment:
