Hello and welcome to our extended coverage of this year’s [Texas Pinball Festival](https://texaspinball.com/tpf/), held as usual at the Frisco Convention Center which adjoins the Embassy Suites hotel.

[![The home for the Texas Pinball Festival since 2014](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/028-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x505.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/028-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The home for the Texas Pinball Festival since 2014

The history of the Texas Pinball Festival has seen it held at the Hilton in Grapevine, The Hilton Anatole in downtown Dallas and, since 2014, at the Frisco Convention Center. Although it could be argued that the Convention Center is not large enough for the ambitions of the show, it has proved to be a valuable and co-operative partner, with an outstanding range of accommodation options nearby once the host Embassy Suites sells out (which it regularly does within minutes of the show’s allocation of discounted rooms going on sale).

The Texas Pinball Festival floor plan

This year’s TPF is going to be like no other, so join us for our extensive coverage of the whole show which will be updated throughout the event’s three days of public access.

[![The ticket booth outside the main hall is where on-the-day and pre-purchased ticked can be collected](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/005-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x629.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/005-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

**THURSDAY**

Thursday is set-up day which means that the show hall is not open to the public. Naturally, Pinball News has all-areas access and we can show you the setting up and what is going to be available to play once the doors open at 5pm on Friday.

[![Inside the main show hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/009-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/009-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

One of the companies with a new title to promote is Jersey Jack Pinball who have brought multiple *The Godfather* machines to the show.

[![Some of the machines brought by Jersey Jack Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/003-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x589.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/003-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

You can play a Collector’s Edition model here too

We had a preview of the Collector’s Edition and the playfield artwork sparkle effect around many of the features is quite extraordinary. We’ll have more on that later.

We popped back a little later to see how the JJP stand was progressing and saw some of the many games set-up in preparation for Friday’s opening.

[![The Jersey Jack Pinball stand starts to take shape](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/016-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/016-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Stern Pinball also have a new title to promote. They had many copies of their *Foo Fighters* game on their stand run in association with [Fun! Billiards & Gameroom Superstore](https://pinballandmore.com/) in Mesquite, Texas.

[![Lots of Foo Fighters games from Stern Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/010-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x673.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/010-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Lots of Foo Fighters games from Stern Pinball

Although *Foo Fighters* is their latest, it isn’t the only title from Stern Pinball at the show, as they also have multiple *Dr. No James Bond* games on the floor.

[![Dr. No couldn't say 'No' to the TPF](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/014-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/014-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Another company with a recent announcement was Spooky Pinball who brought six of their new *Scooby-Doo: Where Are You!* machines together with a Mystery Machine and a claw game to dispense prizes to show visitors.

Although it is hard to gauge before the show opens, one of the most eagerly-anticipated new titles on the floor comes from Play Mechanix and Chicago Gaming.

[![Pulp Fiction from Play Mechanix and Chicago Gaming](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/029-texas-pinball-festival-2023-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/029-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Pulp Fiction from Play Mechanix and Chicago Gaming

Four *Pulp Fiction* games have been brought to the show for the public to play.

[![Two of the four Pulp Fiction games at the show](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/030-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/030-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Pinball Brothers have a stand with three of their *Queen* pinballs and two *Aliens*. Two more *Queen* machines are available to play on their distributor Coin Taker’s stand.

[![The Pinball Brothers' stand during set-up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/012-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/012-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

At the time of our visit, neither American Pinball nor Multimorphic had yet arrived with their newest titles, however Haggis Pinball were there with their *Fathom Revisited* game and their first title, *Celts*.

[![Haggis Pinball's stand with Celts and Fathom Revisited](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/013-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x653.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/013-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

In a late update, we popped back into the hall after everyone else had left and confirmed American Pinball’s new *[Galactic Tank Force](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2023/03/22/galactic-tank-force-promo-released/)* game had indeed arrived. On the way back we spotted game designer Dennis Nordman checking into the show hotel ahead of the American Pinball seminar about his game at 5pm on Friday.

While the newest releases grab all the attention, the Texas Pinball Festival is all about the full range of pinballs through the years.

[![It's not all new games though as there are plenty of classics too](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/004-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x689.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/004-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The TPF organisers used their tried-and-tested system for unloading trucks at the back door of the hall in order to get the games out, checked in, and the trucks away as efficiently as possible.

[![Trucks unload at the hall's back doors](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/020-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/020-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

It’s not all games, either. There are plenty of vendor stands selling mods, artworks, spares, and much more. We’ll cover those a little later in this report once the show opens.

[![3D artwork is a definite theme of this year's Texas Pinball Festival](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/022-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/022-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Not all the action takes place in the main hall, as there are multiple tournaments held in some of the adjacent conference rooms.

**FRIDAY**

Setting-up continued on Friday morning, with the show really starting to take shape.

[![Friday morning in the main show hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/101-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x625.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/101-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Friday morning in the main show hall

Jersey Jack Pinball had all their machines out of their boxes and in position, with some minor tweaks to the set-up and additions such as the overhead cameras to get them ready for the long weekend ahead.

[![The Jersey Jack Pinball stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/102-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x650.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/102-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Stern Pinball is represented by Fun! and Marco Specialties. They have around twenty-one *Foo Fighter* games as well as multiple *James Bond 007* Pro and Premium machines and a selection of other titles.

With so many manufacturers of pinballs exhibiting, they are often located next to each other in the hall. Spooky Pinball, American Pinball and Chicago Gaming/Play Mechanix are all close together.

Another new entrant to the pinball marketplace is Turner Pinball headed up by Chris Turner. He had announced his intention to build pinballs, but he wasn’t expected to be in a position to show anything by this Texas Pinball Festival. However, although it is still at the prototype stage, he is here exhibiting what will be his company’s his first title, *Ninja Eclipse*.

[![Turner Pinball, Chris Turner, with his Ninja Eclipse original design](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/110-texas-pinball-festival-2023-732x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/110-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The game is flippable with some basic rules incorporated. It’s a fast flowing, brightly-lit three-flippered design with some unusual playfield features. It is designed by the game’s artist, [Brad Duke](https://www.instagram.com/braddukeart/), in collaboration with Jon Norris. Chris is also looking for feedback on the design and features from visitors to the show.

Not all the games come from commercial companies, however. The homebrew section showcases the talents of those who want to create their own games but are not (yet) employed by any of the major manufacturers.

[![Some of the homebrew titles at TPF](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/114-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/114-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Qualifying for the Wizards and Classics tournaments began at 10am on Friday in the tournaments room on the upper level. The Wizards qualifying continues through until 4pm on Saturday, but the Classics qualifying ends at 1am tomorrow morning. On Sunday, the Texas Takedown women’s tournament is held in the same room with an early 8am start time.

By lunchtime, American Pinball had got their *Galactic Tank Force* games set up. There were no Signature or Limited Editions with the tank-style cabinet just yet, but the Deluxe model was making an appearance.

Meanwhile, Chicago Gaming had reshuffled their stand, putting the four *Pulp Fiction* games out front, with their *Cactus Canyon* remakes behind.

The Chicago Gaming stand

We had the opportunity to play *Scooby-Doo: Where Are You!, The Godfather* and *Pulp Fiction* and thoroughly enjoyed all three. They are obviously very different styles of games, but all hit the mark with what they were trying to achieve. Later today we hope to get some time on *Galactic Tank Force* and *Foo Fighters.*

The TPF show floor on Friday mid-morning

There were two seminars and two screenings scheduled for Friday night.

The first seminar was by American Pinball to launch their *Galactic Tank Force* game. It was introduced by American Pinball’s Executive Vice President, David Fix who presented his panel who all worked on the company’s latest release.

The team talked about the creation of the *Galactic Tank Force* game, how the concept of a tank-like cabinet evolved and the approximately 5,000 media assets included in the game – roughly double any previous American Pinball title.

American Pinball game designer Ryan McQuaid then guided the tank-shaped version of the game as it was self-propelled into the hall.

[![The tank rolls in](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/132-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x693.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/132-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

After the tank had parked, David Fix showed a lenticular 3D version of the backglass artwork. This 3D version will be part of the Signature Edition model’s offer.

The second seminar was by Jersey Jack Pinball to talk about the creation of the *The Godfather* game.

Jack Guarnieri introduced game designer Eric Meunier and coder Bill Grupp.

Eric showed the audience around the playfield, explaining how the shots work and all the possible shot options. He also played the three versions of the theme to *The Godfather* included in the game, from the instrumental by Slash, to the vocal versions sung by Mark Tremonti and another version sung by Eric himself.

[![Eric presents his latest game design, The Godfather](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/139-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x761.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/139-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Following the first two seminars, a special screening of the short film *Skill Shot, Baby! Pinball Epiphany*.

This is a short version of a planned full-length feature which was funded by a $15,000 [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skillshotbaby/skill-shot-baby-pinball-epiphany) last August. The film was introduced by Jeff Teolis and Martin Robbins of the Final Round Pinball Podcast.

The final event in the Seminars Room was a screening of the movie *Pinball: The Man Who Saved The Game* about a period in the life of Roger Sharpe. Roger was due to attend and answer questions, but was unwell and not able to be at the Texas Pinball Festival.

[![Mike Faist plays Roger Sharpe in the movie](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/news/pinball-movie-london/12-pinball-movie-london-1024x540.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/news/pinball-movie-london/12-pinball-movie-london.jpg)

Mike Faist plays Roger Sharpe in the movie

As we had already seen – [and reported on](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/11/06/pinball-movie-international-premiere/) – the movie last November, we didn’t stay for the showing and instead took the opportunity to get some dinner.

The Texas Pinball Festival hall closed at 1am, but it was busy until the very end with visitors hoping to make the very most of the first day of the show.

**SATURDAY**

It’s traditional for Saturday at the TPF to begin with the swap meet held in the car park outside the Conference Center and run by the [DFW Pinball & Arcade Club](http://dfwpinball.com/). It’s been that way right back to the days when the show was held at the Hilton in Grapevine. While the weather can be chilly in March, we can only recall one instance of the swap meet being cancelled due to bad weather.

Today there were no such problems, as it was mild and sunny.

[![Saturday morning means the swap meet at TPF](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/201-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/201-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Saturday morning means the swap meet at TPF

It is also traditional for coffee and Dunkin Donuts to be offered, courtesy of the swap meet’s organisers.

[![Everyone can get a sweet deal at the swap meet](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/204-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x682.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/204-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Everyone can find a sweet deal at the swap meet

The arrangement is simple. Sellers turn up in assorted vehicles ranging from private cars to rental trucks, unload their sale items onto the ground and people make them offers.

[![One half of the swap meet](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/202-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/202-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

One side of the swap meet

There is a palpable buzz of excitement when a new vehicle arrives and begins to unload.

[![The other side](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/203-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/203-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Saturday is always the busiest day of the three, so it was no surprise that there was a long queue of visitors waiting for the doors to open at 10am.

[![The line for show entry just before 10am](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/211-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/211-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The queue snakes around the entrance lobby and down the corridor towards the hotel

The hall doors were indeed opened promptly at 10am, when a rush of pre-paid pass-holders showed their wristbands as they headed inside to find their favourite machines to play.

[![Wristbands please!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/212-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x632.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/212-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Wristbands please!

The queues from outside soon turned to queues inside, as lines formed for the most popular new titles.

There were five seminars taking place on Saturday, followed by the autograph session and the *So You Think You Know Pinball?* prize quiz.

The first of these featured Chris Turner from Turner Pinball along with members of his design team.

They had brought along their *Ninja Eclipse* game shown earlier in this report. Game designer Brad Duke (left, above) talked about the playfield layout and the rules. Chris then explained about how the company was formed and what he wants to achieve with their first title.

[![Ninja Eclipse in the seminar room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/226-texas-pinball-festival-2023-719x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/226-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

He said they plan to have the game released by the end of the year with an initial build of 100 machines. It will be built in small batches in-house in their San Antonio facility. He said if they can sell the first run and make a well-built, reliable and fun game then he will consider that a success.

**1pm: Dino Gaspari – Shipping a pinball machine is easier than you think!**

[![Dino Gaspari](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/228-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x686.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/228-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Dino Gaspari

Dino runs the [ShipMyPinball.com](https://shipmypinball.com/) website which specialises in providing near-instant quotes for shipping pinball machines across North America and beyond.

In his seminar he demonstrated how the process works and invited the audience to visit his website to set up example shipping requests for themselves, explaining the options available for collection, delivery and insurance.

[![Dino demonstrates how the website works](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/227-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x653.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/227-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

**3pm: Multimorphic and the P3 – One Machine, Many Games**

The team from Multimorphic has a new game to show at this Texas Pinball Festival, and so company head Gerry Stellenberg was joined by the designer of *Final Resistance*, Scott Danesi, the rules wizard Bowen Kerins and mechanical engineer TJ Weaver.

TJ Weaver

The group talked about the creation and development of *Final Resistance*, along with the game’s concept, how it is an extension of Scott’s previous *Total Nuclear Annihilation* game crossed with *Attack From Mars*.

They spoke about the ball lock mechanism and how quickly it fires out the three locked balls (0.5 seconds).

**4pm: Hey, Mark Ritchie! What’s Up?**

Without doubt, one of the most anticipated new games premiering at the Texas Pinball Festival was *Pulp Fiction* from Play Mechanix and Chicago Gaming. So, game designer Mark Ritchie from Play Mechanix was joined by Butch Peel from Chicago gaming to talk about how *Pulp Fiction* was created.

[![Mark Ritchie](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/237-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x685.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/237-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Butch Peel

Mark explained how the game was originally built for the director of *Pulp Fiction*, Quentin Tarantino, who wanted a pinball of the movie, but was very specific in the kind of playfield design he wanted and didn’t want.

He wanted something reminiscent of the early ’80s, with a single level playfield, alphanumeric displays, no video monitor and rules typical of the era. After an initial playfield was rejected, a second draft resulted in approval and the green light to produce it commercially.

With all the seminars completed, at 5pm there was the autograph session held outside the seminars room. Many famous faces from the pinball world were seated at a long table, ready to sign pinball flyers, translites, backglasses, playfields or anything the show visitors placed before them.

There were still more events to go on Saturday, with the next one taking place in the hotel’s bar area as Pinball News Editor, Martin Ayub and Pinball Magazine Editor, Jonathan Joosten, ran their popular *So You Think You Know Pinball?* free prize quiz.

[![Jonathan Joosten and Martin Ayub with some of the prizes they gave away](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/224-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x665.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/224-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The duo asked the assembled crow to choose one of two possible answer to a series of questions. Thos who got each question correct continued to the next one until there were only a few players remaining. They all got prizes and a new round began with everyone back in.

[![Some of the prizes at the So You Think You Know Pinball? quiz](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/243-texas-pinball-festival-2023-461x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/243-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Some of the prizes at the So You Think You Know Pinball? quiz

Prizes were donated by (in alphabetical order) American Pinball, Chicago Gaming, ColorDMD, Dutch Pinball, Dutch Pinball Museum, Jersey Jack Pinball, Multimorphic, Pedretti Gaming, Play Mechanix, Pinball Brothers, Pinball Magazine, Pinball News, Spooky Pinball, Stern Pinball, Wormhole Pinball, and many more.

For those looking for dinner without leaving the venue, there were several options. A couple of food vendors were set-up in the lobby outside the show hall selling pizza, hot dogs, nachos and other suitably un-healthy pinball fuel, along with bottled beers, wine and sodas.

Meanwhile, two food trucks were stationed in the parking area outside the Convention Center.

[![One of the two food trucks outside the Convention Center](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/247-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x531.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/247-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The second food truck

If yo didn’t mind a short walk, *Wild Pitch* – a kind of *Hooters* sports bar with scantily-clad waitresses – offered a larger menu and a decent drinks selection. A favourite of ours, although it was a longer walk away, was *Kelly’s* sports bar which served better food and had a wider drinks selection. Most other local eateries were a short drive away.

At 8pm the warm-up for the TWIPY awards ceremony began in the seminars room, ahead of the full ceremony starting at 8:30pm.

[![The TWIPPYs awards](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/244-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/244-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

Not all vendors were in the main hall though. Several took up position in the main corridor from the show hall entrance to the seminars hall.

The show hall closed to the public at midnight on Saturday, but remained open to vendors for another two hours so they had an opportunity to close their stands and play all the games.

**SUNDAY**

We returned on Sunday morning to shoot our exclusive Thirty-Three Minute Tour walkthrough video of the main hall.

Here it is. We hope you enjoy it.

The main hall reopened at 9am on Sunday. It was a a shorter day than Saturday, with the show wrapping up around 2:30pm when the Best-in-Show awards ceremony took place in the seminars room, followed by the draw to win a freshly unboxed *The Simpsons Pinball Party* pinball machine.

[![TPF co-organiser, Ed Vanderveen, presented the closing ceremony](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/303-texas-pinball-festival-2023-664x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/303-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

While the closing ceremony was taking place, vendors and machine owners had begun dismantling their booths and games. By the time the ceremony was over, the show hall looked very different.

…accidents will happen!

One area we haven’t spoken about so far is the four tournaments held in a separate room on the upper floor behind the main show hall.

Starting at 10am on Friday, the qualifying for the Classics, Wizards and Kids tournaments ran throughout the day. The Classics final then began at 9am on Saturday, the Kids at 2:30pm and the Wizards at 5pm.

Sunday was devoted to the Women’s tournament with qualifying from 9am and the finals beginning at midday.

[![The tournament schedule](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/318-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x495.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/318-texas-pinball-festival-2023.jpg)

The tournament schedule

With so much going on in the show hall, in the seminars and elsewhere at the show, as well as keeping this report updated throughout the four days, we weren’t able to spend time following these four competitive events.

Fortunately, though, [Wormhole Pinball](https://www.facebook.com/WormholePinball/) were streaming the Classic,s, Wizards and Women’s tournaments live on their Twitch channel, and have recordings available to watch now.

Congratulations to all the winners (no spoilers), to the organisers and to everyone commentating on the streams. The Texas Pinball Festival tournaments have grown in status over the years and are now attracting the world’s best players to Frisco.

With that we wrap up our coverage of this year’s Texas Pinball Festival.

![A sign for the show outside the Convention Center](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2023/311-texas-pinball-festival-2023-1024x491.jpg)

A sign for the show outside the Convention Center

This was an extraordinary show with an unprecedented number of new games launched in the days before and premiering here.

If you wanted to play *Foo Fighters*, *The Godfather*, *Galactic Tank Force*, *Scooby-Doo*, *Final Resistance* and *Pulp Fiction*, this was the only place in the world you could find them all under one roof. Plus, you could catch up with what Haggis Pinball have been doing with their *Fathom Revisited* and find out about Turner Pinball’s plans for their *Ninja Eclipse* and future games.

That’s not including the hundreds and hundreds of collector games, the History of Pinball exhibition, the dozens of vendor stands, the homebrew games, the amazing restorations, all the seminars, the TWIPY awards and the many pinball stars attending and happy to talk about their latest projects.

It’s no surprise how the show hotel and many of the surrounding hotels sell out very quickly, so make sure you put the dates for the 2024 show in your diary.

Banners promoting the 2024 TPF

The Texas Pinball Festival is staying at the Frisco Convention Center for at least the next two years.

During Covid, the Convention Center cancelled all future bookings, including the TPF’s booking for 2024. When they started taking bookings again, they had already allocated the TPF’s expected dates to another event. As a result, next year the TPF is a week earlier (15th-17th March, 2024) than it would usually be held, but is back on the 21st-23rd March in 2025.

Those are the Friday to Sunday show hall dates, but the TPF party really kicks off on the Thursday, if not on the Wednesday. There are thoughts about setting up the hall even earlier and making Friday a full show day like Saturday, but the organisers will announce any changes on [their website](https://texaspinball.com/tpf/) and social media feeds.

We hope you’ve enjoyed our coverage here on Pinball News with over 240 pictures and more than 30 minutes of video. We’ll be back next year, bringing you the best reporting anywhere.

In the meantime, don’t forget to check out our thoughts on the show and all the new game launches in the March edition of the [Pinball Industry News PINcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/pinball-industry-news) we do with [Pinball Magazine](https://www.pinball-magazine.com/) which will be released in the first few days of April and will include some special interviews conducted during the show.
