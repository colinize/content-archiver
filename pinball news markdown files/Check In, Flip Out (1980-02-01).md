Pinball turns up in a number of unusual locations, but perhaps one of the strangest is under the wings of the iconic Concorde aircraft at Manchester Airport in northwest England.

Concorde is no stranger to pinball of course, having been the theme of several pinball and bingo games from the self-titled Concorde to Supersonic, but this September the Big Bird and the Silver Ball  are reunited in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust charity.

The Northern Lights Pinball team will be supplying two pinballs for the Fly Back to the '80s event being held on 27th September as part of the Runway on the Runway charity fashion show fundraiser.

To continue the '80s theme, the two pinballs chosen feature evergreen themes which were relaunched in the '80s and found a new generation of fans.

The band AC/DC picked themselves up after the death of their lead singer Bon Scott in February 1980, recruited Brian Johnson, and released their seminal best-selling album Back in Black the same year.

After a long-running and highly successful original series, the Star Trek franchise was also relaunched in the '80s as The Next Generation first hit the small screen in September 1987.

Both the AC/DC and Star Trek - The Next Generation pinball machines will be on coin play for the  event, with all proceeds going to the charity. Transport costs for the two machines are being met by Pinball Heaven.

More details of the  Fly Back to the '80s event are available on the website, where tickets can also be booked.
