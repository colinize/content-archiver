**Location:** Suite 2102, 2100 N Hwy 67, Midlothian, TX 76065, USA

Just before this year’s Texas Pinball Festival, we had the opportunity to visit the new Texas Pinball Museum which opened its doors in the city of Midlothian eight weeks earlier.

We were shown around by Kim and Ed Vanderveen who own and run the Muesum.

The Museum is located out-of-town on a light-industrial park in the unit nearest the road.

On entering the Museum, you come to the lobby where there is seating and the entry desk.

Entry to the collection costs $10 for adults or $7 for kids under twelve-years-old. At present the Museum is only open on Saturdays, but Ed and Kim hope to expand that soon to include Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons too.

Once into the Museum there are twenty-six pinball machines and a few other amusement games to play. The pinballs range from the oldest – a 1974 Dolphin by Chicago Coin – to the newest – a 2018 Deadpool from Stern.

The games are arranged along the side and back walls, with a back-to-back row in the centre of the room.

Our visit was right before the Texas Pinball Festival, so a couple of the backglasses (Indiana Jones and The Lord of the Rings) had been removed so they could be signed by the actor John Rhys-Davis who was a guest at the show.

The final pinball cabinet is from Kosmic Khaos which was a concept shown at the Texas Pinball Festival 2017. Only a cabinet and some conceptual artwork exists at this stage. It may be developed further, but probably not for a while.

If refreshment is needed then a vending machine in the lobby serves snacks and soft drinks. If anything more is required then a short trip back into town takes you to numerous eateries.

Ed and Kim plan to increase the amount of pinball-related artwork and memorabilia on the walls, as well as add information about the games in the collection. The TPF show has been their focus recently, and the Museum’s office also acts as an office for the show during the run-up. A few of the Museum’s regular exhibits, such as a *Safecracker*, had been taken out so they could be at the show but would return shortly.

Midlothian is about 30-minutes by car south of central Dallas. If you are visiting the city on a Saturday then it is well worthwhile making the trip to play the machines at the Texas Pinball Museum.
