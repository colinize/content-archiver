Legends of Valhalla is a design by Scott Gullicks which was developed by him and Frank Gigliotti at Riot Pinball. American Pinball worked with Riot Pinball to take what was essentially a homebrew design, convert the mechanic components such that they could be manufactured at scale, further developed the software, sounds and music, and release it as an American Pinball title.

Anyone who has played the game at any pinball shows will immediately recognise the design, but there had been much more development taking place at American Pinball to create the version revealed today.

Legends of Valhalla is themed on the Norse gods and other Viking mythology.

The game features three flippers and three stainless-steel ramps, an illuminated Viking ship ball lock and an under-playfield magnet to disrupt the ball’s movement.
