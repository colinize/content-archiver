Chicago Gaming and Play Mechanix’s announcement

We have talked about the game many times on the [Pinball News and Pinball Magazine PINcast](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/09/05/pincasts-page/), including how the game would be designed by Mark Ritchie and made in collaboration with either Raw Thrills or Play Mechanix. So it has proven.

We also speculated whether it would make an appearance at the upcoming [Texas Pinball Festival](https://texaspinball.com/tpf/), where Mark Ritchie is appearing and where he has previously shown a concept for a new game call *Kosmic Khaos*.

[![Will this concept Kosmic Khaos game ever be made?](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/tpf-2018/031-tpf-2018-615x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/tpf-2018/031-tpf-2018.jpg)

We have also spoken about how either [Raw Thrills](https://rawthrills.com/) or [Play Mechanix](https://rawthrills.com/tag/play-mechanix/) would be getting into the pinball business. Chicago Gaming already makes some cabinets for Raw Thrills, and Play Mechanix is a subsidiary company of Raw Thrills. Raw Thrills was established by Eugene Jarvis and Play Mechanix by George Petro, both with a history in pinball. George did the software for Mark Ritchie’s Road Kings, while Eugene worked with Mark’s brother Steve Ritchie at both Atari and at Williams.

They have collaborated on a pinball project in the past when Stern Pinball made *[Big Buck Hunter Pro](https://www.pinballnews.com/games/bigbuckhunter/index.html)*, but it had been long rumoured Eugene Jarvis wanted to get back into pinball.

*Pulp Fiction* is supposed to be a single-level game in keeping with the era of the movie and according to the wishes of the licensor, Miramax, although that is yet to be confirmed.

The Play Mechanix logo usually features a spanner with empty jaws, but it has acquired a pinball in this promo.
