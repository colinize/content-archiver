Date: 5th December, 2013

After a raft of music- and superhero-based games, Stern Pinball today announced they have teamed up with Ford Motor Company to provide the theme for their next title.

Today is a significant date, because not only has the 2015 model just been revealed, but it also marks the 50th anniversary of the iconic Mustang brand, and the Mustang is the inspiration for the next Stern game to follow Star Trek in early 2014.

It is unusual for Stern Pinball to officially announce their upcoming title without revealing any pictures or indeed anything much about the game's features, but the 50th anniversary of the brand was too good an opportunity to miss.

Mustang - the pinball - is believed to be designed by John Trudeau, and would be his first game for Stern since joining in May 2013.

All that has been revealed about the game so far is that it will feature the voice of Tanner Foust, a professional racing driver and co-host of the American version of the BBC's Top Gear programme.

Accompanying Tanner on the soundtrack will be a number of licensed music tracks from Sony Music covering the five decades of the car.

Artwork for the game will come from artist, fashion designer and designer of the Ford GT,  Camilo Pardo, who parted ways with the motoring giant on less-than-amicable terms in 2009.

Here's how Stern Pinball announced the tie-up with Ford and their joint venture, the Mustang pinball machine.

Stern Pinball Announces Partnership with Ford Motor  Company

World’s Leading Maker of Arcade-Quality Pinball Celebrates 50  Years of Ford Mustang with Newest Machine

MELROSE PARK, IL – Stern Pinball, Inc., the world’s leading  maker of real pinball games, proudly announced today the merging of two American  icons.

Get ready to start your engines and celebrate 50 years of Mustang. The Mustang  pinball machine, exclusive to Ford, drops players into the driver’s seat of one of the  hottest cars on the street.

Narrated by professional racing driver, Tanner Foust, this  machine sets the tone for a fast paced, white-knuckle game. The game comes equipped  with top-of-the-line features including artwork painted by famed Ford GT designer, Camilo Pardo, and the ultimate soundtrack from Sony Music featuring five decades of  hits.

“The Mustang is one of the most iconic, American cars ever made,” said Gary Stern,  Chairman and CEO of Stern Pinball, Inc. “What better way to celebrate 50 years of  Mustang than with the launch of the Ford Mustang pinball game? Everyone at Stern is  buzzing with excitement about this launch. From the artwork and game features to the  stellar soundtrack, we have created a tribute that will make Mustang and pinball fans  worldwide proud.”

Mark Bentley, Ford Global Brand Licensing says, “Ford Motor Company is extremely  excited to partner with Stern Pinball on this state-of-the-art Mustang pinball machine.

Pinball aficionados from around the globe will appreciate the unique blend of Mustang  heritage and Stern craftsmanship in this fantastic machine.”

The Ford Mustang game continues the Stern Pinball tradition of producing quality pinball  machines for young and old. The company traces its lineage to the 1930’s in  Philadelphia when Sam Stern entered the business of operating pinball games. Sam  subsequently became part owner and president of Williams Manufacturing, a pioneer in  the pinball industry, and passed his lifelong enthusiasm for the game and the business  of pinball to his son, Gary, who founded Stern Pinball. Today pinball remains one of the  world’s favorite pastimes.
