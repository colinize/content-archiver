The once dismal pinball on location scene in the Chicago area is a distant memory. There is now an immense variety of quality pins available to play in Chicagoland.

Chicago Street Pinball Arcade in Joilet, IL

Visiting some of the sites I was able to enjoy playing old favorites, such as *Taxi*, *Big Guns* and *Banzai Run*, and the latest pins *Game of Thrones* and *Ghostbusters*. The [Pinball Rebel website](http://www.pinballrebel.com/) and [PinballMap.com](http://pinballmap.com/chicago) both have additional locations with pins in the Chicago area.
