**Date:**
July 2020
**Locations:**114 S.W. Arch Street, Atlanta, IL, USA, 107 S. Hamilton Street, McLean, IL, USA & 260 Center Street, McLean, IL, USA

In this edition of *PinSpotting* we visit three unique gaming destinations in the heartland of America, all founded by a man who, since he was a youth, has been obsessed with coin-op games.

**Route 66 Arcade Museum**
114 S.W. Arch Street, Atlanta, IL 61723, USA
(217) 648-5077

It has been celebrated in song, story, poem, and yes, even a *Route 66* TV show (1960-1964); historic U.S. Route 66 was established in 1926 and ran east-west across the central United States.

According to the popular song *Route 66* by John Mayer “*…it winds from Chicago to LA, more than two thousand miles all the way*”. 2448 miles or 3,940 kilometres to be precise.

Tourist attractions designed to get a motorist to take a break from their journey (and spend some cash) along ‘the mother road’ or the ‘main street of America’ are scattered here and there among the small towns that are found along Route 66.

One of these attractions is the *Route 66 Arcade Museum* located in the prototypical small town of Atlanta, IL.

At the Route 66 Arcade Museum it is possible to misspend your youth all over again; one quarter at a time! The Museum is chock full of vintage pinball and video games from the 1930s to the 1990s.

The Route 66 Arcade Museum building

The *Route 66 Arcade Museum* is only open during the tourist season from April through September. The museum is opened and closed by a third party but is usually open from 9am to 4pm in season. Hours are currently impacted by Illinois state COVID-19 regulations for entertainment businesses so please check before your visit.

Local Atlanta, IL businesses have gotten into the spirit of gaming, and places such as *[The Palms Grill Cafe](http://www.thepalmsgrillcafe.com/menu/)* just down the street from the *Route 66 Arcade Museum* have antique pinball games on hand.

107 S. Hamilton Street, McLean, IL 61754, USA

260 Center Street, McLean, IL

These two arcades are sister locations and are both located on the McLean, Illinois town square.

*Arcadia: America’s Playable Arcade Museum* is John (Vectorman) Yates’ flagship location located near Atlanta in the scenic and bucolic town of McLean, IL. Yates’ home town is Atlanta, IL, but he has since adopted McLean, IL which he calls “*A safe and friendly place much like Andy Griffith’s fictional TV town of Mayberry*”.

We found McLean to be a welcoming town indeed. It’s a nice place to go for a summer evening stroll. Terri and I were doing just that and a resident stopped his truck and rolled down the window. “*Where ya’ll from?*”, he said. We told him and his reply was “*Welcome to McLean – enjoy your stay!*”, and drove off. Something like that certainly wouldn’t happen even in Chicago’s suburbs.

The Town Square bell

*Arcadia* was first opened to the public in the fall of 2009 after nearly half-a-year of redecorating and modernization, including a full update to the climate control that would allow gamers to enjoy the classic video games no matter what the weather might be outside.

[![The weather outside Arcadia was good today](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/pinspotting/july-2020/06-pinspotting-july-2020-1024x663.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/pinspotting/july-2020/06-pinspotting-july-2020.jpg)

This retro arcade was conceived, designed, decorated, and stocked with the goal of being a world-class destination for the pinball and classic video gaming community. Gamers have come to visit *Arcadia* from every state in the USA and many countries of the world.

*Arcadia* has a collection of video game art on the walls including an impressive collection of lighted video game cabinet glasses which gives a distinct retro feel to the interior.

The wall of video game marquees

Yates started collecting coin-op games in 1985, buying his first game console for $99 and now brings titles in regularly from his stock of over 1500 games. Yates says that he has rotated many different games through *Arcadia* since opening in 2009.

There is a new free-to-use party room inside *Arcadia* which is available for up to 28 guests. Contact John at the phone number above for information and booking.

*Arcadia* has a comfortable lounge area for those wishing a break from the gaming action. The lounge is located near the front entrance and has a retro-styled Wurlitzer jukebox with ’60s & ’70s songs.

[![Arcadia's lounge area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/pinspotting/july-2020/09-pinspotting-july-2020-1024x717.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/pinspotting/july-2020/09-pinspotting-july-2020.jpg)

Arcadia’s lounge area

Neither arcade offers food or beverage service at this time but Yates hopes to offer sandwiches and soft drinks for his visitors in the not-too-distant future.

Yates opened a sister arcade, *Pinball Paradise*, in 2016 which is located in the former McLean State Bank building adjacent to *Arcadia*.

*Pinball Paradise* is focused on pinball with a half-dozen or so video and other games on hand.

*Pinball Paradise* also boasts a “*rare Italian-made foosball table*” that should be of interest to table soccer players.

I found that all of *Arcadia’s* and *Pinball Paradise’s* games are in good to excellent condition and both locations have change machines accepting up to $20 bills. At least half of the games are 25 cents per credit with the remainder being 50 cents per credit. Some of the games offer discounts for purchase of 2-3 or more games at a time.

Yates opened a gaming-themed Airbnb immediately next door to *Arcadia* in 2012. The *[Hotel Arcadia](https://www.vintagevideogames.com/hotel-arcadia-suites)* has several full-sized multicades as well as pinball with a certain number of credits free-of-charge for the guests. The apartment can accommodate up to six people with a bed, sleeper sofa and a ‘kids loft’ accessed by a spiral staircase for either the youngsters or the
very young at heart. More details are available in their [Airbnb listing](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5308078).

The traveling gamer is also offered guest accommodations at *[Hotel Arcadia Suites](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/20859348)* (3 bedrooms, 4 beds, 1.5 baths, 2 multicades and a *Whitewater* pinball) and *[Vectorman’s Luxury Arcade Palace](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25865896)* (3 bedrooms, 5 beds, 3.5 baths, with two dozen games including two pinballs). Check their website for more details and booking information.

*Arcadia’s* website shows some of the games in Yates’ collection are available for sale and [there is a list](https://www.vintagevideogames.com/inventory-reduction) that he is taking offers for. Please check with them if you need more information on anything that appears on the ‘For Sale’ or ‘Taking Offers’ lists.

Overall we felt that this is a very fun and unique destination that anyone who plays coin-op games will enjoy. Why not plan to spend a day or two to immerse yourself in this ultimate world of gaming?
