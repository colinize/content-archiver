Stern Pinball today teased their second cornerstone title of 2024 with a trailer for their upcoming *John Wick* game.

Based on the popular quadrilogy of movies starting in 2014 and starring Keanu Reeves, Stern’s *John Wick* will be fully launched tomorrow with images and details of the Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models. This will be followed by more promotional game information, audio and videos over the coming days.

Stern’s John Wick launch schedule

For those not familiar with the John Wick franchise, Wick is a retired assassin who forced out of retirement to seek revenge on those who have wronged him. Each of the four movies sees him reluctantly waging a one-man war on an underworld crime syndicate, each resulting in a reassuringly high body count (77, 128, 94 & 140 deaths per movie). The fourth John Wick movie was released in March 2023, with a fifth currently in development.

The trailer contains clips from several movies, including the most recent *John Wick: Chapter 4*, suggesting Stern Pinball have access to assets to all four films.

In addition, it sounds as though they have custom speech recorded by Ian McShane who plays the role of Winston, manager of the Continental Hotel in all four movies. He has previously recorded custom callouts for the *John Wick Hex* video game.

Here’s the full trailer video.
