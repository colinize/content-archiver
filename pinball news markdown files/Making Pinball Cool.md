The Silver Ball Planet is a new pinball  arcade located in Big Step Mall in Osaka, Japan. Osaka is the second largest  city in Japan and the arcade is located in the part of town known as Amemura  (America Town).

This part of town is the fashion district. It is analogous to  the famous Harajuku in Tokyo and is overrun by hipsters, cosplayers, and the  tourists who come to gawk at them. It is also filled with trendy  clothing stores, record shops, hip restaurants and cafes, and one world-class  pinball arcade.

In their efforts to promote pinball, the  Silver Ball Planet recently commissioned Japanese street/pop artist Buggy to  live paint a piece to hang over the reception desk in their entryway.

They  promoted the event for weeks and on the day they set Buggy up on the landing of  the main staircase along with a DJ booth and a Kiss pinball machine. The stairs  in front of the landing function as bleachers and Big Step often hold special  events here.

On the landing above the bleachers they set  up four additional pinball machines (all on free play) along with some  advertising posters for the arcade and for future events at the arcade (they  have a club night coming up as well as their monthly tournament).

Future pinball events were also promoted

Buggy then painted off and on between 1pm  and 6pm. Hundreds of people sat and watched him paint and hundreds more played  pinball throughout the day.

The four machines above the bleachers (Shrek,  Spider-Man, AC/DC, and Metallica) were in constant demand throughout the day as  all manner of people from young children, to hipsters, the elderly, and  everyone in between gave pinball a go, many playing pinball for the very first  time.

Pinball for all ages

Playing pinball at this event is one of my  greatest pinball memories. To play in a public venue, in the sun with a light  breeze blowing, surrounded by hundreds of Japanese people, while a DJ played  tunes and a renowned artist painted was a surreal experience. This is how cool  pinball should be. This is how public pinball should be. This is how pinball  should be promoted.

Just as many a barcade owner in America is discovering that pinball can be trendy and an activity for hipsters that is akin to collecting vinyl, SBP is clearly trying to tap into this market in achingly hip Amemura.

Hipsters are of course a fickle bunch as this week’s  ironic moustache quickly turns into next week’s ironic Nintendo cartridge  collection, but some of these new converts are bound to remain faithful  regardless of where the herd migrates. This will ultimately be great for our  hobby in the short and long term.
