Pinball fans in London have just a couple more days to be in with a chance of winning a very special prize at a special The Who store and pinball arcade.

London's Foubert's Place

Anyone walking down Foubert's Place in London's West End could be forgiven for overlooking the 'pop-up' store and arcade occupying one of the otherwise-vaccant stores behind Hamleys and just off Carnaby Street.

But inside the brightly lit shop is a selection of new and collectible The Who memorabilia, T-shirts, mugs, coats and other assorted paraphernalia.

Inside the store

The Who branded coasters, key fobs, mugs and albums

Classic The Who shirts

Alternative designs and framed artworks

Many of the artworks are signed and available to buy

But for pinball fans, perhaps the most interesting items are found at the front of the shop.

A Tommy pinball machine

A Creature from the Black Lagoon machine

Both machines are set on free play, but the Tommy machine is especially interesting because a high score competition is being run on it with a very special prize for the highest scorer.

The prize up for grabs is a Fender Stratocaster guitar, signed by Pete Townshend.

The grand prize

The high score competition runs until November 15th, and the pop-up store and arcade is at 19 Foubert's Place, London W1.

Good luck!
