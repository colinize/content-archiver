Story dated 23rd December, 2000

Welcome
to this, the very first Pinball News Review of the Year - a look back
at the events of the last 12 months. At
the end of this page you can share your thoughts about the past year
of pinball
with fellow readers.

2000
has been an exciting year for the world of pinball, following the
depressing news of Williams' withdrawal from pinball manufacturing
which so marred the end of 1999. From the ashes of William's rose
several new companies hoping to rebuild the pinball market, while
diversifying into new areas.

First
up was Pat Lawlor Design. The ubiquitous
game designer was joined by Louis Koziarz and John Krutsch in setting
up the new company, with the aim of designing games for the coin-op
amusement industry.

Secondly,
Illinois Pinball Inc was formed by collector
and enthusiast Gene Cunningham. He announced the company's intention
to produce games using the former Capcom technology he had previously
bought.

Third,
Roger Sharpe the former Licensing and Marketing
Director at William's, created Sharpe Communications. His company
offers licensing, promotion, public relations and advertising skills
to the coin-op industry.

All
three companies are based in, or around, Chicago.

Meanwhile, the one company still manufacturing pinball games showed
what it was made of, when it showed off a couple of new machines of
its own design.

Last
year Stern Pinball had produced first South Park and then Harley Davidson
after the buyout from Sega. South Park in particular was exceptionally
popular, requiring a second production run to satisfy demand.

This
year, though, Stern had to start producing games meeting Gary Stern's
criteria of simpler, more fun mechanical-action pinball. Their first
game - Striker Xtreme - was premiered at
ATEI London in January. Designed to appeal to the European market
in particular, the game was a little clunky in play, though it felt
very solid and was a good start. The second game - Sharkey's
Shootout - was a great improvement, with a much smoother gameplay
and attractive look. Sharkey's clearly benefited from the injection
of some former William's talent.

Sharkey's
should build up interest in Stern's next game. Many pinball enthusiasts
were so shell-shocked by the William's announcement that they've not
yet appreciated the offerings Stern has produced. 2001 should be the
year that gives Stern the attention they deserve starting with High
Roller Casino - their next game - to be unveiled at ATEI in January
2001.

Along with the
new games, Stern has also found time to produce their own web
site. With good content and links, along with an extensive ROM
library, it has to be considered an invaluable resource.

The rumour mill
has been grinding away at top speed this year mainly due to the lack
of hard information. The main target has been Gene Cunningham and
Illinois Pin Ball Inc (note the two worded spelling) and their purchase
of various ex-Williams' assets.

It has been suggested
that IPB had bought the rights to manufacture new William's games,
to use the Bally name, and the two Pinball 2000 uncompleted games
Wizard Blocks & Playboy.

It seems that
none of these were true. So far, IPB appears to have bought the rights
to manufacture parts for spares use only - not for inclusion in new
games. He has also bought the remaining inventory of spares from William's,
and is looking at buying some of the spares left at the manufacturers.

Nothing has been
heard about the manufacture of new games by IPB. Gene was showing
three games called Pool Player at the
AMOA trade show in September, but these were rebadged Breakshot games
and proved not altogether reliable. A flyer for the game was released,
but since then IPB has been tied up with the spares issues.

2000
has also seen the departure of two famous names from the industry.
Following on from the mass layoffs from William's, this year saw Jon
Norris leave Stern after the imposition of a workplace smoking
policy. Jon as an asthma suffer found the situation untenable and
left.

Then
in December, industry patriarch Steve Kordek
retired after 63 years in pinball. He had been working on archiving
the pinball-related material at William's since the closure.

Finally, 2000 saw
the launch of this web site. In April, Pinball News began with the
aim of bring you the latest news in a clear and concise manner.

Since then the
reaction has been overwhelming, and a huge thanks goes out to our
readers and to the many people who have contributed articles, reviews,
pictures and ideas to make this first year of Pinball News such a
great success.
