[Stern Pinball](https://sternpinball.com/) today announced the latest title in their ‘The Pin’ range of home models with their new *[Jurassic Park Pin](https://sternpinball.com/affordable-home-game/jurassic-park-pin/)* game.

Unlike previous ‘The Pin’ models such as *Heavy Metal*, the two *Star Wars* games and *Ultimate Spider-Man* which shared a common playfield design with differing artwork and models, *Jurassic Park Pin* is a new design by Jack Danger who is better known for his [Dead Flip pinball streaming channel](https://www.twitch.tv/deadflip) on Twitch.

Jack has teamed up with software engineer Waison Cheng and mechanical engineer Robert Blakeman to create this new design. Rather unusually, *Jurassic Park Pin* features the same backbox artwork previously only available on the full-size Limited Edition variant of Jurassic Park, although that top-end game had a mirrored backglass whereas the *Jurassic Park Pin*‘s artwork is printed on a translite.

The Pin range is not designed to be operated and thus doesn’t have any coin mechanism on the front door. It also moves the start button onto the lock bar to make it more obvious.

The playfield includes two metal ramps with wireform returns, three drop targets, two spinners, a Raptor pen, a captive ball and a ball-spitting T-Rex model.

The main toy in the game is the T-Rex which has a 3-bank of drop targets in front, a shot beneath and it can hold the ball in its mouth.

Stern have produced a flyer for distributors to use to help promote the game.

The back of the flyer

*Jurassic Park Pin* is priced at $4,599 which is $1,600 less than the equivalent Pro model of the same title (or $1,900 less compared to a Pro with the Insider Connected QR code reader installed). To achieve the lower price there are some alterations to the game’s construction, including making the playfield and bolted-together cabinet out of MDF rather than plywood, having fewer mechanisms and flippers, making the pop bumpers operate as one rather than having individual control, and making the LCD panel in the backbox significantly smaller.

With an MDF playfield, some of the targets have to be mounted from the top-side rather than screwing into the underside.

[![Some playfield targets have their mountings visible on the top side of the playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/026-jurassic-park-pin-1024x701.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/026-jurassic-park-pin.jpg)

As the game is not intended to be operated, there is no space for a pricing card on the bottom apron. Instead, we find the rules for the game. Most ‘Pin’ models have rather simple rules, but it looks like *Jurassic Park Pin* has a rather deeper ruleset.
