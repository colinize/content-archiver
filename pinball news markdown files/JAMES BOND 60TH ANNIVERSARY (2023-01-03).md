Having [previously announced the Pro, Premium and Limited Edition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/09/22/stern-officially-launches-james-bond/) variants of their James Bond 007 cornerstone title, Stern Pinball today revealed the much-anticipated 60th Anniversary limited edition featuring all six actors who played the role of Bond in the MGM/UA movies.

The cabinet artwork is a montage created from posters for the 25 official James Bond films, while the backbox art is another composition using the names of each movie.

The mirrored backglass shows all six Bonds in classic poses, while the game comes with an illuminated static 007 topper and a custom shooter rod, along with 007/Spectre themed side rails.

The 60th Anniversary edition is a completely new design by Keith Elwin, taking a retro approach with mechanical score reels and backlit inserts for scores, ball number and player number in place of an LCD panel.

[![Scores are shown with a combination of four mechanical score reels and illuminated score values](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/james-bond-007-60th-anniversary/22-james-bond-007-60th-anniversary-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/james-bond-007-60th-anniversary/22-james-bond-007-60th-anniversary.jpg)

Scores are shown with a combination of four mechanical score reels and illuminated score values

Score values are especially low, with the score reels and inserts allowing scores up to 49,999 before the ‘Over The Top’ insert lights. The inserts also suggest the game is locked to three-ball play and a maximum of four players.

James Bond 007 60th Anniversary only comes in a single version which is limited to just 500 units, resulting in a suitably exclusive price. It is up to distributors to set their own price level, but Stern made a number of units available for purchase through their own web shop at a price of $19,999, setting the benchmark distributor price at $20,000 plus tax & shipping.

The playfield

Although there is no LCD panel in the backbox, there is one embedded in the playfield. Stern Pinball say it will be used to train players about their assignments, but there in the company’s promo video (shown further below) there are no clips from any of the movies shown just yet, and no audio clips either.

Oddjob’s spinning hat

Spinning playfield objects are something of a theme, with the game featuring four separate spinners in addition to Oddjob’s hat.

There are also plenty of drop targets – 10 in total, both in a row and inline.

There is a shot back into the shooter lane

One of the rules involves collecting all six Bonds. Your progress is shown on the back panel.

[![The Bonds collection](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/james-bond-007-60th-anniversary/17-james-bond-007-60th-anniversary-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/james-bond-007-60th-anniversary/17-james-bond-007-60th-anniversary.jpg)

The Bonds collection

Collecting a Bond is achieved by shooting the kickout saucer at the top left of the playfield. This forms part of a crossover shot which can be shot in both directions.

[![The kickout saucer and crossover loop](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/james-bond-007-60th-anniversary/18-james-bond-007-60th-anniversary-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/james-bond-007-60th-anniversary/18-james-bond-007-60th-anniversary.jpg)

The kickout saucer and crossover loop

At the very top of the playfield are three 007 rollover lanes which feed a pair of Spectre pop bumpers. There is also a captive ball which can be shot directly from the left flipper or from a pop bumper kick.
