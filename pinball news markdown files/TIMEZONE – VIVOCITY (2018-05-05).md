**Date:**
30th November, 2017

**Location:**
#02-43 Vivocity, 1 Harbourfront Walk, Singapore 098585

I visited Singapore in November and December 2017 with my family.   One of my tasks was to locate as many pinballs as possible.

My second location was the Timezone game centre in Vivocity. It is located on the 6th floor of the Vivocity building, near the entrance to the Santosa.

Timezone at Vivocity

It is a flagship store with a number of games for both adults and children.

The only pinball game – a *Ghostbusters* Premium (Stern, 2016) – was locating near the main entrance.  The regular cost per game was S$2.10 ($1.57/€1.31/£1.16).

Surprisingly, the game condition was very good.  Therefore, it was not difficult for me to become the grand champion.  I stayed there for a around an hour until my wife chased me back to the hotel.（＊＿＊）
