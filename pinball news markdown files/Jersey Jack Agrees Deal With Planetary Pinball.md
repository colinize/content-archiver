Another step was taken towards completion of their first release today, when Jersey Jack Pinball (JJP) and Planetary Pinball Supply (PPS) completed an agreement for JJP to utilise  PPS parts and intellectual property in their upcoming games.

This means JJP will be able to use standard Williams/Bally (WMS) parts and assemblies in their Wizard of Oz game, as well as in future models.  It also allows JJP access to approximately 40 WMS patented designs assigned to PPS, side-stepping many of the potential legal challenges over patents held on commonly-used parts.

Rick Bartlett of PPS and Jack Guarnieri shook hands on the agreement at the Texas Pinball Festival today, where both were holding presentations about their plans.

Speaking about the agreement, Jack said, "We are thrilled and elated that this could even be possible. It's an amazing step in building full feature games where the player is connected to the game action for the ultimate fun experience"

In addition to the supply of existing designs and components, PPS will also produce new parts and artwork for JJP for use in their machines, making these available to existing PPS distributors and resellers.

We have much more from both Jack and Rick in our extensive Texas Pinball Festival show report.
