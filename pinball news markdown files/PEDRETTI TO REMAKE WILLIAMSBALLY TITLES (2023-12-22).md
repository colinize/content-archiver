[Pedretti Gaming](http://www.pinballremakes.com) have extended the scope of their agreement with [Planetary Pinball Supply](https://planetarypinball.com/) from making ‘2.0’ upgrade kits for Bally and Williams titles to remaking entire games.

Until now, Planetary Pinball had only licensed [Chicago Gaming](https://www.chicago-gaming.com/) and [Haggis Pinball](https://haggispinball.com/) to remake complete Williams and Bally pinballs. Under those agreements *Medieval Madness*, *Attack From Mars*, *Monster Bash*, *Cactus Canyon*, *Fathom* and *Centaur* have been remade.

Planetary Pinball say those agreements have not been changed by the addition of Pedretti Gaming to the list of remake licensees.

Pedretti Gaming have already produced licensed 2.0 upgrade kits for two Williams titles under their existing agreement with Planetary Pinball Supply.

Whirlwind: Total Chaos by Pedretti Gaming

Pedretti Gaming will use the joint venture manufacturer they established one year ago with Pinball Brothers, Euro Pinball Corp., to manufacturer the new remakes in Italy for worldwide export.

Euro Pinball Corp. are currently making *Alien* and *Queen* games for Pinball Brothers. Their agreement with Pinball Brothers is also not impacted by the new remakes deal with Planetary Pinball.

Pedretti say they have been working on the first remake title throughout 2023 and expect to bring it to market in 2024, with several more in development. As with the agreements to manufacture the 2.0 kits, the full remakes from Pedretti will be required to use the FAST Pinball control system. Haggis adopted the FAST Pinball system for their Fathom and Cantaur remakes, although so far Chicago Gaming have been using their own proprietary system.

It is understood there has been frustration at the time taken by existing Planetary Pinball licensees to manufacture their remake games. Pedretti say they plan to release a new remake title every twelve months under their new multi-year agreement.

Games exported from Italy to the US will be distributed by Planetary Pinball, with the company also becoming a new reseller of Pinball Brothers machines and parts. Meanwhile, Pedretti will greatly extend their range of pinball parts for sale by adding a full range of licensed Williams and Bally remanufactured parts.

Here’s how Pedretti Gaming made the announcement of their new agreement.
