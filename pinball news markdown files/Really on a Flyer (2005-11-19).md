Last week we reported on the new pictures of The Crocodile Hunter - Outback Adventure coming out of The Pinball Factory.

Now we actually have the flyer.

Unusually, one side of the flyer is in a landscape format with the other in portrait.

The landscape side shown above shows off both sides of the cabinet and backbox while the portrait shot is the front view seen previously.

Although the game is not scheduled for release until next year, the flyers should be available from TPF distributors very soon but collectors may have to get new protectors as the flyer is A4-sized and not the more common US Letter format.
