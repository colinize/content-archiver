**Location:**
#B1-03/04/05 Westgate, 3 Gateway Drive, Singapore 608532

I visited Singapore in November and December 2017 with my family.   One of my tasks was to locate as many pinballs as possible.

My fourth and final location was the TimeZone game centre in the Westgate shopping mall.

The only pinball game – an X-Men (Stern, 2012) – was located in a hidden corner of the TimeZone centre.

The Stern X-Men Pro

It was S$1.50 ($1.12/€0.94/£0.83) per game, which is relatively cheap compared to most of the other centres.

This was the final stop of my pinball trip to Singapore.  My overall feeling is that pinballs are not the favorite games for Singaporeans.
