Stern Pinball today re-confirmed that their next title would be another music-themed pinball based on the band *Iron Maiden*.

Continuing their series of rock band games after *AC/DC*, *Metallica* and *Aerosmith*, *Iron Maiden* will be subtitled after the band’s upcoming [*Legacy of the Beast*](https://ironmaiden.com/tours/legacy-of-the-beast-tour-2018) European tour.

Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast will be Stern Pinball next release

We say ‘re-confirmed’ because Stern Pinball’s Chief Creative Officer, George Gomez, had already spilled the beans about the title in his Stern of the Union talk at the Texas Pinball Festival last weekend, as we reported.
