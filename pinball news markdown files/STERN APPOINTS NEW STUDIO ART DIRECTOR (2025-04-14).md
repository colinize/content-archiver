Jeremy Packer, Stern Pinball’s new Studio Art Director

Jeremy, who also goes under the name Zombie Yeti, has worked on Stern Pinball titles since 2016 when he debuted with the art package for Ghostbusters.

Despite creating the artwork for many more Stern titles as a contractor, including *Iron Maiden*, *Deadpool*, *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*, *The Avengers: Infinity Quest* and *Godzilla*, it wasn’t until February 2023 that he became a full-time employee at Stern, [taking on the title of Project Artist](https://sternpinball.com/2023/08/02/stern-pinball-welcomes-jeremy-packer-as-project-artist/).

Many people thought Jeremy would be in the running to take over from Stern’s Art Director, Greg Freres, when Greg [retired from the company in October last year](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/07/11/greg-freres-retires/). However, Stern appointed Sebastian Napoli instead.

Sebastian’s tenure only lasted a few months before he departed to work on alternate projects. He does still work with Stern on a contractual basis, but his departure left the art department without a head.

The announcement of Jeremy’s appointment as Studio Art Director fills that void and comes one day before his latest work for the company is revealed. Stern’s *King Kong: Myth of Terror Island* is due to launch tomorrow, April 15th and it features a complete art package created by Jeremy.

Here’s how Stern Pinball made the announcement of Jeremy’s appointment.

| **Jeremy Packer Appointed Studio Art Director**  **CHICAGO, IL – April 14, 2025** – Stern Pinball, Inc. (SPI) is pleased to announce the appointment of Jeremy Packer (aka Zombie Yeti) as Studio Art Director.   With his impeccable draftsmanship, innate sense of balanced composition and commendable attention to detail, Jeremy has cemented himself as a top-tier talent in the illustration business.   His portfolio features a vast array of iconic Stern Pinball games, including Foo Fighters, Ghostbusters, Deadpool, Avengers: Infinity Quest, Godzilla, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Iron Maiden, Venom and The Uncanny X-Men.  Jeremy is an award winning illustrator who gained recognition in the pinball industry for his dynamic, comic-inspired art style. Early influences such as comic books, gig posters, and street-art culture shaped his bold use of colors, highly detailed character work, and playful visual narratives.   His innovative approach to creating cohesive, story-driven artwork helped modernize pinball’s aesthetics and reintroduce hand-drawn techniques to a market often reliant on photo-based or digital collage.  “*Jeremy continues to provide the best artwork in the industry with his work receiving numerous accolades. We’re excited for him to lead the way with the entire art studio here at Stern Pinball and showcase his incredible art collaboration on the newly announced King Kong: Myth of Terror Island pinball machine,*” said George Gomez, Chief Creative Officer of Stern Pinball, Inc. |
