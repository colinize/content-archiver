The tournament weekend, in short, is comprised of two tournaments, the European Pinball Championship, and running alongside, the ever popular
Danish Pinball Open, back for its 14th iteration.

Furthermore there will also be the traditional National Team Tournament, where each country can enter a selection of their finest players, to compete for national glory and honour.

Finally, as we had at last years DPO, there will be a second chance consolation tournament on Sunday, for everyone that has had the misfortune of being knocked out of both the EPC and DPO.

The price for participation is 55€ + 5€ handling fee, totalling 60€ in all.

The formats:

EPC: Qualification on 10 player selected machines from a large bank, leading into head to head final rounds, ending in a 4 man grand final on
Sunday.

DPO: Qualification on 8 player selected machines from a large bank, leading into 4 man group final rounds, ending in a 4 man grand final on
Sunday.

National championship: Format still not finalized.

Second chance: Format still not finalized.

The schedule:

\* Friday: 5 EPC qualification slots, DPO qualification open through the day, national team tournament.
\* Saturday: 3 EPC qualification slots, DPO qualifications open through the day.
\* Sunday: EPC finals, DPO finals, Second Chance consolation tournament.

Every country is allotted 5 pre-registrations.

The 5 pre-registered players will also represent their respective countries in the national team tournament, so choose your players wisely. (In case of a player not being able to actually come to the EPC, substitutions are of course allowed)

Each player will receive a personal link to sign up and pay the entry fee (pre-registration is not valid without payment), which will be useable until Wednesday the 5th, where the EPC 2019 website will go live and registration will open for all interested players.
