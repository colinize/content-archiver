Having revealed the production version of their *Houdini* game in March 2018, American Pinball wasted little time before unveiling the company’s second title in October of the same year.

Game Designer, Joe Balcer, had announced the title of game two at the Vancouver Flip-Out Pinball Expo earlier in the year during his seminar.

As with *Houdini*, several changes were made to the game between it’s unveiling and the start of production.

The Oktoberfest backglass

For one, the cabinet and backglass artwork was revised, making the game’s name clearer and removing an over-familiar monkey from the backglass. There were changes on the playfield too.

The barrel’s tap on the left was re-designed to make it more aesthetically-pleasing, along with several other playfield tweaks.

Since then the game has been a staple at most major pinball shows, with production machines starting to ship in April 2019 and game manufacturing continuing through the rest of the year.
