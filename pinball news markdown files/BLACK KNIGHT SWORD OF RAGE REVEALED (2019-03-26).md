Following yesterday’s teaser video, Stern Pinball today released pictures and a video of their new Black Knight: Sword of Rage pinball.

The translite for the Pro model

As usual, the game is available in three variants – Pro, Premium and LE – with suggested prices of $5,999 for the Pro, $7,599 for the Premium and $8,999 for the Limited Edition.

Let’s take a look at the cabinet and backbox artwork for the three models.

The front of the Limited Edition

Each model has its own art package, together with individual translite or backglass (on the LE) designs. All the artwork comes from famed pinball artist Kevin O’Connor.

[![The Pro, Premium and LE translite/backglass designs](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/12-black-knight-sword-of-rage-544x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/12-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The Pro, Premium and LE translite/backglass designs

Under the glass, the Premium and LE models share the same playfield features which include an acrylic upper playfield with a full-size flipper and a three-ball lock, a stainless-steel shooter lane with the choice to launch to the upper or lower playfields, a drop target in the left orbit lane, and a powder-coated steel bottom apron.

[![The LE playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/13-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage-549x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/13-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The LE playfield

The Pro model doesn’t have an upper playfield, so it’s only a two-flipper game compared to three on the Premium and LE. It also has a plastic bottom apron, but gains a second spinner in the left orbit in place of the drop target on the Premium/LE.

[![The Pro model's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/14-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-553x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/14-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The Pro model’s playfield

Here are the two designs side-by-side:

[![The LE/Premium on the left, the Pro on the right](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/15-le-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-979x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/15-le-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The LE/Premium on the left, the Pro on the right

Probably the star of the game is The Black Knight himself. He is represented on the playfield for the first time as a model and, apart from being internally lit by RGB LEDs synced to his speech, he has a couple more tricks up his sleeves.

[![The Black Knight on the Pro](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/17-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/17-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The Black Knight on the Pro

The Black Knight isn’t a bash toy exactly, as you shoot the standup target in front of him rather than hit the model directly. However, in his right hand is a a spinning flail which is motorised so it can spin whenever the ramp below is shot.

[![The motorised flail in the Black Knight's right hand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/35-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/35-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The motorised flail in the Black Knight’s right hand

In his left hand is his shield which is hit directly and which raises when struck.

[![The shield in The Black Knight's left hand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/22-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x791.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/22-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The shield in The Black Knight’s left hand

An opto switch in front of the shield senses hits and raises shield to allow access to a U-turn lane and upkicker behind.

[![The shield lowered and raised](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/34-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/34-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The shield lowered and raised

The shield lane upkicker, like another upkicker on the left, uses the ‘web-slinger’ curved ball guide to deliver the ball onto a passing wireform.

[![The right 'web-slinger' and the steel launch lane to either the upper or lower playfields](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/25-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/25-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The ‘web-slinger’ on the left side of the playfield

[![There is a drop target in the left lane on the Premium and LE, but an extra spinner on the Pro](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/26-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/26-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The upper-playfield on the Premium and LE models are made out of Lexan so you can see the pop bumpers and rollover lanes below (as long as it is kept clean).

[![The upper playfield on the Premium and LE](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/41-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/41-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The upper playfield on the Premium and LE

A standup target lights the locks on the metal ball lock mechanism which can hold up to three balls. These are shot into a vertical U-turn and then held in the lock by a retractable post.

[![Three balls are locked, so time for multiball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/42-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/42-le-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

Three balls are locked, so time for multiball

The released balls drop onto the Lexan playfield. Being clear, there are limited opportunities for upper-playfield inserts to point to features, but no doubt the LCD display will direct you to the jackpot shots.

The Pro lacks the upper playfield entirely.

[![The Pro has no upper playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/19-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/19-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The Pro has no upper playfield

[![As well as being a model, The Black Knight rides again at the back of the playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/20-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/20-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

As well as being a model, The Black Knight rides again at the back of the playfield

Two other big features from the earlier *Black Knight* games continue into this third game in the series.

The Lightning Wheel gives out awards whenever it is spun.

[![The Lightning Wheel features RGB LEDs beneath the lightning bolt inserts on all three models](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/16-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/16-pro-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The Lightning Wheel features RGB LEDs beneath the lightning bolt inserts on all three models

The awards range from super pops/orbits/lanes/slings/targets/spins to starting one of the six modes – *Black Castle*, *Mud Bog*, *Molten Fire*, *Burning Sands*, *Wicked Caver*n and *Deep Freeze*

[![The six modes and six 'super' awards](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/28-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/28-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

The six modes and six ‘super’ awards

The second carry-over from earlier games is Magna-Save, the player-operated electromagnet found just about an outlane which allows a ball draining down the outlane to be stopped and dropped into the inlane instead.

The feature is usually earned with playfield shots on a three-bank of drop targets and activated by a second flipper button. The three-bank is still there but on *Black Knight: Sword of Rage* the Magna-Save is activated by the action button on the lock bar.

[![The Manga-Save drop targets](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/33-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/black-knight-sword-of-rage/33-pre-black-knight-sword-of-rage.jpg)

Unlike the original Black Knight but in keeping with the Black Knight 2000, Magna Save is only available on the right outlane. There is a ball save feature available on the left lane to get you back in the game.

Finally, here’s how Stern Pinball announced their latest release:
