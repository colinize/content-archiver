After our first [reveal of their prototype game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2021/09/29/queen-pinball-revealed/) at at pop-up store in London in September 2021, Swedish pinball company, Pinball Brothers, have today officially announced the launch of their *Queen* pinball machine.

The Queen Champions Edition

The title is to be produced in two versions. The standard Champions Edition will cost US$9,295 while the Rhapsody Limited Edition costs an additional US$1,700 for a total of US$10,995. As with Pinball Brother’s current title, *Alien*, *Queen* games will be built by Pedretti Gaming in Milan, Italy.

The Rhapsody Limited Edition is limited to 1,000 units and features illuminated artwork on the cabinet interior and on the back panel, a shaker motor, a special shooter rod (not shown in these pictures), gold-coloured metalwork, a gold-coloured cabinet and backbox art package, a numbered plaque and a certificate.

The Rhapsody Limited Edition

Both models have identical playfield and software features. There are custom voice calls from the surviving band members, while the game includes 14 famous Queen tracks. As we noted previously, the game is themed around the band’s live performances, so it features live versions of the tracks and shows concert footage of the band performing them on the game’s 18.5-inch LCD panel.

The 14 tracks included in the game are:

* A Kind Of Magic
* Another One Bites The Dust
* Bohemian Rhapsody
* Hammer To Fall
* I Want To Break Free
* Killer Queen
* One Vision
* Play The Game
* Radio Ga Ga
* Seven Seas Of Rhye
* Somebody To Love
* We Will Rock You
* We Are The Champions
* Who Wants To Live Forever

In terms of artwork and game design, seemingly little has changed from the version we revealed almost a year ago. Indeed, the copyright notice from the licensor (Bravado International Group) is dated 2020.

The backbox artwork features stylised depictions of the four band members – John Deacon, Roger Taylor, Freddie Mercury and Brian May – while the cabinet sides show a skyline of Wembley Stadium – the setting for some of Queen’s greatest live performances, including their memorable reunion for Live Aid in 1985.

The backbox artwork features the four band members

In our prototype reveal we showed how the backbox lock clashed with the Queen logo. The logo has now been made slightly smaller so it is now clear of the lock. The arrangement of the four band members has also been adjusted a little with Roger’s cymbals made less prominent.

The prototype backglass artwork

The playfield design and artwork, while now feature-complete, is very similar to the prototype.

The Queen playfield

The main playfield feature is the Red Special upper playfield modelled around Brian May’s famous guitar.

The Red Special upper playfield

It includes a single full-size flipper, three illuminated standup targets, a captive ball shot and an exit to a ball lock for Red Special Multiball. The ball enters from an upkicker above the flipper and can also exit at the bottom onto a wireform feeding the right inlane.

The Red Special upper playfield exits onto a wireform

There is an interactive Radio model and a model of Wembley Stadium at the top of the ramp which also acts as a ball lock for a dedicated multiball mode with the use of a grab magnet.

The Wembley and Radio models

It’s worth noting that Wembley Stadium was demolished in 2002 and a new stadium built on the site, so those famous Wembley towers featured in the game no longer exist.

The stainless steel ramp and pop bumpers

If the ball isn’t locked, it continues to the left and onto a wireform where a diverter can send it to either the left or right inlanes.

The Queen playfield with the Wembley Stadium model at the top of the ramp

On the lower-left of the playfield is a 4-bank of drop targets with three standup targets behind, representing a keyboard’s white and black keys.

The reverse view of the playfield from the Red Special upper playfield

On the opposite side is a lane with a standup target at the end to spell out Q-U-E-E-N. This lane, like two others in the game, can be blocked by a pop-up drop target.

The Queen playfield

The game shown here includes the illuminated side art ‘blades’ which are included in the Rhapsody Limited Edition model.
