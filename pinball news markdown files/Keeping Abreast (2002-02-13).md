Story
dated 13th February 2002.

In
the latest press release, Stern Pinball Inc. unveil their latest game
- Playboy.

Not
much of a surprise for Pinball News readers of course, since we brought
you the world's first full review
3 weeks ago. But this is Stern's public admission of their next game.
Playboy in now in production and should last for about 4 months if
things go according to plan. There isn't any information on the Stern
web site yet beyond a simple splash screen with the backglass image
but Stern did send us two images of the game.

Interestingly,
these pictures show the same lockdown bar as we saw at the ATEI show.
This one had a plastic insert part way along it leading us to assume
it was a prototype model using a patched Austin Powers part. These
models also show it, though hopefully it won't be there in the production
version. We shall see.

There
don't appear to be any visible differences between the game shown
in Stern's pictures and the games we reviewed. However, we've shown
them below anyway. If you can see any changes please let
us know.

Award
for the cheesiest quote of the year so far must go to George Gomez
for this classic:"The
game recreates the excitement and glamour of the magazine within the
fiction of the game." Err,
right George.

Here's the press release:

Playboy,
the most popular men's magazine in history, is now the pinball
machine that everyone's talking about. Brought to you by Stern
Pinball, Inc. and Playboy Enterprises International, Inc., the
Playboy pinball machine is the work of George Gomez (designer
of Monster Bash™), Dwight Sullivan (programmer of T2®
and Star Trek: TNG®), and the incredible team of pinball
experts at Stern Pinball. Steeped in Playboy's rich 50-year
tradition, this pinball machine brings you the world's most
beautiful women in a glamorous lifestyle that only can be called
Playboy. This is one pinball machine you have to see to believe,
and play to experience.

The
Playboy pinball machine challenges you to collect Playboy Rabbit
Heads, to complete a calendar year of Playmates, and experience
"Mansion Mania" in a way you never have before. The
Playboy pinball machine also features a mechanical Centerfold
that opens and closes, along with several other unique playfield
mechanisms that reveal the many beautiful women of Playboy.
(Important note: photo inserts for the playfield mechanisms
are interchangeable, allowing for appropriately rated images
to be applied to various environments.)

The
Playboy pinball machine also features an incredible art package
by Kevin O'Connor (artist of Star Wars: Episode One® and
PLAYBOY: 35th Anniversary), great sounds and music, and a sexy
lady's voice talking to you the whole way.

George
Gomez says, "This is the first Playboy pinball that truly
highlights the beautiful women of Playboy. The game recreates
the excitement and glamour of the magazine within the fiction
of the game."

Gary
Stern adds, "Playboy has the deepest rules we have ever
put in a game-but most of us will just shoot the gadgets and
see the pictures. And the ball flow is fantastic-Playboy shoots
beautifully!"
