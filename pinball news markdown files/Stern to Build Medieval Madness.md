When Planetary Pinball confirmed their intention to remake Medieval Madness with Chicago Gaming Company, it was not made clear where the games would be built.

Stern to build Medieval Madness remakes

While Chicago Gaming Company had some game manufacturing experience, it wasn't clear they had the capacity to build the 1000 limited edition and an undisclosed number of regular models.

Now Planetary Pinball Supply (PPS) and Chicago Gaming  have signed an agreement with Stern Pinball which will see the Melrose Park company use their manufacturing facilities and staff build the Medieval Madness remakes.

Chicago Gaming already supply Stern with cabinets and backboxes through their Churchill Cabinets company and they will oversee production at the Stern facility. The games will be built using Chicago Gaming's electronics system and using WMS-specification parts.

The games will then be send to Chicago Gaming in Cicero, Illinois, where they will receive their finishing touches and be packed ready for shipping.

It's not known how far-reaching this agreement is, and whether Stern Pinball will also manufacture future PPS/Chicago Gaming remakes which are expected to continue with Attack from Mars.

Here's what Stern Pinball had to say about the new agreement:
