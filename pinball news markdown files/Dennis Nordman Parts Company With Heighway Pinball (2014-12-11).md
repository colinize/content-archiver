Having been instrumental in the initial design of the company's second title, Alien Pinball 35th Anniversary Edition, game designer Dennis Nordman has split with Heighway Pinball.

Writing on his Facebook page, Nordman says he is not the designer of Alien Pinball, although he did create the initial playfield drawing and designed four of the playfield toys.

Nordman  appeared with the Heighway Pinball team at 2014's Pinball Expo in Chicago, where the Aliens Pinball title was first unveiled and Dennis showed mock-ups of some of those playfield toys.

Dennis was clearly unhappy with the proposed production schedule for Alien Pinball. He wrote, "Andrew announced that the game would be ready in April and I can't possibly agree with this."

Although he disassociated himself from what the game has become, Dennis did say he thought the proposed final version looked impressive.

He said, "The drawing can change drastically as the game develops...   I've seen the video that he [Andrew Heighway] submitted to Fox and if the game turns out anything like this it will be great."

However, it's clear that it won't be Dennis's vision of the game, so the business relationship he had with Heighway Pinball has ended and the game will be developed by the company without his further input.
