**Date:**
August 2018

**Location:**
7th Floor, MBK Center
Phayathai Rd., Pathumwan, Bangkok 10330, Thailand

I visited both Bangkok and Hua Hin in Thailand in August 2018 with my family.

Hero City on the 8th floor of MBK is one of the few pinball locations in Bangkok.

Hero City in MBK, Bangkok

There was only one game – an AC/DC Pro (Stern, 2012) located near the entrance of the amusement centre.

AC/DC Pro

As usual, it cost THB20 ($0.61/€0.53/£0.47) for a 3-ball game.

Unfortunately, it was seriously lacking any regular maintenance.   The playfield was dirty and many components were not working.   I only played two games and then left the centre in a low mood.
