American Pinball have today announced their next new game, Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge.

Named after legendary pinball designer, Barry Oursler, who joined American Pinball shortly before his [untimely death in February 2022](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/02/22/barry-oursler-dies/), it pays homage to Barry’s love of BBQ and outdoor activities, and is based on the playfield design he began developing at American Pinball.

The game’s design was further developed and brought to production by the team at American Pinball, including Steve Bowden, Dennis Nordman and Ryan McQuaid. Steve also headed-up creation of the game’s ruleset, with Joel Schober and Casey Butler coding the game. Veteran composer and sound designer, David Thiel, created the audio package, while Matt Kern managed the voice talent.

You can read more about the team which created the game in the American Pinball press release further down this article.

A selection of detailed playfield shots have now been released yet, in addition to which there is an overhead view in the flyer artwork which shows the game has more of an ’80s design complete with two ramps and a small LCD screen embedded in the playfield to complement the backbox LCD panel.

The game includes two ‘scoring posts’ which are a throwback to the mushroom bumpers found in EM games which act like static posts but also register ball hits.
