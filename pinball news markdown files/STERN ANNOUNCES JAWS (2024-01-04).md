After teasing their latest ‘cornerstone’ title, Stern Pinball today released details of their *Jaws* game.

Several pictures and a trailer video were leaked online earlier this week, but this is our first look at the official announcement and full details of the three models available – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition.

*Jaws* is not only based on the 1975 movie of the same name starring Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss which centres around the fictional seaside town of Amity Island where a number of swimmers are killed by a mysterious force, later discovered to be the titular Great White Shark, followed by a watery (and bloody) showdown between the trio and the shark. In fact, the *Jaws* pinball is based on all four *Jaws* movies – even *Jaws 3D*.

Stern’s top-of-the-range model is the Limited Edition. This is limited to 1,000 units and includes a mirrored backglass depicting the iconic movie poster. The cabinet adds reflective foil artwork by Michael Barnard and ‘Great White’ powder coating to the metalwork. The speaker lighting has also been upgraded from previous titles with more game-related lighting effects.

Probably the most famous aspect of the whole movie is the ominous theme music by John Williams. So naturally, this appears in the game too, alongside custom speech from Richard Dreyfus who plays Matt Hooper in the movie. However, it seems Roy Scheider (Chief Martin Brody) isn’t included beyond the movie clips on the LCD panel and audio clips from the film, with no playfield or cabinet artwork depicting him.

So, let’s begin by comparing the look of the three models before examining their cabinet and playfield differences.

**Pro Model**

The $6,999 pro features the same backglass artwork as the Limited Edition but here it’s a plain translite. The cabinet artwork is also the same as the LE, but again, it is only a standard decal and doesn’t feature the reflective foil. The metalwork is the standard matte black and the backbox trim is black too.

**Premium**

For the $9,699 Premium model the translite is upgraded to a custom design as is the cabinet artwork. The movie poster design moves to the backbox sides while the cabinet gains flipper button area protection on the side rails and the backbox trim is blood red.

**Limited Edition**

The $12,999 Limited Edition returns to the movie poster from the real, mirrored backglass, while the ‘Great White’ metalwork includes shark bite cutouts on the side rails. Meanwhile, the shooter rod features a barrel design.

The Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models

So much for the outside, but what’s on the inside?

For this section we’ll begin with the Limited Edition playfield design. This is essentially the same in the Premium model minus some decorative elements, so we’ll cover both before moving on to the more stripped-down Pro model.

**Limited Edition/Premium**

[![The Limited Edition playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/303-jaws-619x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/303-jaws.jpg)

[![The flipper area on the LE](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/308-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/308-jaws.jpg)

The flipper area on the LE

There are several major mechanisms on the playfield of the Limited Edition (and Premium). Let’s take a look at them, starting with the fin target.

[![The fin target](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/331-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/331-jaws.jpg)

The fin target

We’ve had moving targets before, of course. Games such as *The Rolling Stones*, *Big Buck Hunter Pro* and *Monster Bash*, for instance, all had a groove across the playfield along which a target moved. *Jaws* uses the arc used in *The Rolling Stones* and *Monster Bash*, but rather than have a stand-up target, *Jaws* uses a moving drop target, meaning it doesn’t always block a part of the playfield.

The fin target appears in all three models of the game, unlike our next feature.

Above the fin target we have the boat captive ball.

[![The boat captive ball shot](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/305-jaws-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/305-jaws.jpg)

The boat captive ball shot

The captive ball can be hit and pushed into a target behind to register a hit.

Once it has been hit enough times, you can start a shark encounter. When that happens, the boat is pushed up out of the water as the Great White rises from below.

[![The Great White pushes the boat up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/333-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/333-jaws.jpg)

The Great White pushes the boat up

The Great White then becomes a bash toy as you battle the shark. Although the mouth appears wide open, it actually sits above the playfield level and isn’t designed to swallow the ball.

To the right of the boat and shark is the fishing reel horizontal spinning disc which is one of two such devices in the LE and Premium models.

![The fishing reel spinning disc](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/323-jaws-1024x684.jpg)

The fishing reel spinning disc

The post on the top can’t be hit and appears to simply be a weight to ensure the disc returns to a position where it can be spun again.

The second major mechanism which is unique to the upper models is, appropriately enough, an upper playfield.

![The Orca upper playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/324-jaws-1024x684.jpg)

The Orca upper playfield

The Orca was the iconic boat used in the famous final shark battle. As such, it bears the marks of the battle including blood and a shark bite.

The Orca upper playfield has a single mini-flipper, an inner steering wheel spinning disc loop, a radio standup target, a top exit lane ramp shot and a bottom exit lane.

![The Orca upper playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/319-jaws-1024x684.jpg)

The bottom exit from the Orca upper playfield

Next to the bottom exit is the swinging chum bucket captive ball.

[![The chum bucket target](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/318-jaws-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/318-jaws.jpg)

The chum bucket target

The fixed ball has a movable ball behind. When the front ball is hit, the rear ball cannons into a pivoting arm which holds the chum bucket, causing it to swing.

![The upper playfield, chum bucket and boat](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/320-jaws-1024x684.jpg)

The upper playfield, chum bucket and boat

Further down the playfield, on the left side are three drop targets which light the fish finder feature on the inserts in front.

[![The fish finder drop targets](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/315-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/315-jaws.jpg)

The fish finder drop targets

Above this is the entrance to a lane which flows behind the drop targets down to the left inlane. This lane, like the drop targets and much more can be shot by the game’s fourth flipper, found on the right side of the playfield.

![The right side flipper](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/316-jaws-1024x684.jpg)

The right side flipper

This side flipper has a lane feeding it which passes behind the game’s sole pop bumper. The pop bumper has a sculpted barrel topper on the LE and Premium.

The side flipper is just above the right outlane, and this too has an interesting feature not seen for a while.

[![The right outlane with a save lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/312-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/312-jaws.jpg)

The right outlane with a save lane

If the ball rolling down the right outlane strikes the rubber ringed post just right it can be deflected through a one-way gate into the inlane.

The right inlane, like the left inlane, has an up-post to hold the ball while a mode begins.

[![The up-post in the left inlane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/311-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/311-jaws.jpg)

The up-post in the left inlane

There are inserts indicating your progress across the playfield, but you main progress is shown by the inserts in the central playfield area.

**Pro Model**

The Pro model, as expected, lacks some of the playfield features included in the Premium and Limited Edition models.

[![The Pro's apron stickers](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/108-jaws-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/108-jaws.jpg)

The central bottom apron on the Pro

The upper playfield has gone, as has the animating boat mechanism revealing the shark. Instead, a rather happy-looking shark is permanently mounted above the cage captive ball area.

[![The Pro model's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/103-jaws-596x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/103-jaws.jpg)

The Pro model’s playfield

[![No upper playfield (or anything in its place) on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/115-jaws-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/115-jaws.jpg)

No upper playfield (or anything in its place) on the Pro model

The boathouse model has also gone, replaced with a flat plastic.

[![The boathouse building is now a flat plastic](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/114-jaws-1024x667.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/114-jaws.jpg)

The boathouse building is now a flat plastic

The boat mechanism is greatly simplified in the Pro and converted into a shark cage. The cage doesn’t rise to reveal the shark. The shark is mounted above the cage instead.

![The shark above the captive ball boat mechanism](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jaws/116-jaws-1024x683.jpg)

On the plus side, the moving fin target remains, as does the chum bucket captive ball.

The chum bucket on the Pro

In addition, the drop targets for the fish finder feature have been replaced by standup targets on the Pro model.
