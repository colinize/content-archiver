Editor's note: With the offical Stern launch parties for Avatar coming up, we head over to Belgium to see how they celebrated the game's arrival.

The official Belgian launch party for Avatar, where do I start?

It's the third launch party we organised since we started with Big Buck Hunter Pro but this was the most difficult one so far. The problem was waiting for the game to arrive here in Belgium, I'm not going to bore anyone with all the details but if I tell you we had to pick five dates before the party took place I think you know enough.

So after all those problems - and fixing some transport problems - the game finally arrived at my gameroom.

After the arrival of Avatar we quickly started rearranging our pinball machines and cleaning a piece of the workplace so we could place a large table where everyone could sit around and have a little pinball chat, of course.

With our Iron Man launch party we illuminated the chat place in yellow and red, because I thought it was a perfect fit. Now with Avatar we chose green and blue to lighten up the area.

A dress code was once again asked and of course we saw someone lit up in blue! His wife told me he was busy making his LED lights work all  afternoon on the day of the launch party.

Lots of people really liked Avatar and there were quite a few who liked it a lot more than Iron Man!

The Na'vi arrived! :-)

After updating the game we accompanied it with a large movie poster

and a blue spot light beneath the game

Yes, we  had our good Zonderik beer at this event too. No worries for the people that were  afraid we only had it at the OpenGameRoomWeekend!

He liked Avatar, it's 'lightning' fun!

Even I had to play the game out of the blue! :-)

There's  also a small video which I made of the event.

I also made another one of me  playing Avatar so you can have a look at what the game is all about!
