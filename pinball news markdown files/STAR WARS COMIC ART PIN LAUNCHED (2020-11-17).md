*Star Wars* has been a successful and venerable licence for [Stern Pinball](https://sternpinball.com/). Following the three models of the [cornerstone game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2017/05/31/star-wars-announced-2/) – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition – announced in 2017, the company released a [*Star Wars Pin*](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/07/19/star-wars-pin/) home model two years later, rapidly followed-up by [re-arted comic book versions](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/10/07/stern-show-re-arted-star-wars/) of the Pro and Premium models.

The only combination not hitherto revealed was a comic book version of the *Star Wars Pin*, a situation that has now been resolved with Stern Pinball today announcing exactly that, just in time for the holiday season.

Stern Pinball’s Star Wars Comic Art Pin

The *Star Wars Comic Art Pin* takes the original *Star Wars Pin* and applies a new art package by Randy Martinez who created the comic art for the Pin’s big brother.

The game’s right side

The cabinet and backbox artwork package is a modified combination of the designs found on the cornerstone comic art models. The translite image comes from the Premium comic-art game while the cabinet and backbox sides come from the Pro variant. The Pin model also sports a yellow strip around the cabinet and across the translite.

The Pin range of games isn’t intended for commercial operation and so has no coin mechanism, front door cutout or the associated wiring. That allows for a larger Star Wars logo on the front door.

Naturally, the re-arting goes beyond the external appearance. The playfield and plastics have also received the comic look, although the playfield design is unchanged from the earlier Pin version.

The Comic Art Pin’s playfield

The playfield design and corresponding inserts are somewhat different from the full-size coin-op model, so the playfield artwork is similarly custom-designed for the Pin while borrowing many of the design elements and colour schemes.

The Pin range is priced below the cornerstone title Pro models which have a MRSP of $6,199. The MRSP of the *Star Wars Comic Art Pin* is $4,499 or $1,700 less than the arcade version. That’s the suggested price which can often be discounted by dealers, although it is unlikely to drop below the minimum ticket price of $3,999.

The game will be available through regular Stern Pinball distributors while the company will also be offering the game for sale through their own [web store](https://shop.sternpinball.com/). This will be priced at the MRSP of $4,499 plus applicable taxes and shipping.

The instructions

The shooter lane cover uses the same design as the arcade version but doesn’t feature a cut-out to help gauge your plunger strength.
