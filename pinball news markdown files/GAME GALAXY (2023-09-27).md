Game Galaxy arcade in Smyrna, Tennessee is, in many ways, the polar opposite of the two whiz-bang entertainment centers I reviewed in July 2022.

Look for this sign

On the outside it is, to put it mildly, crude in appearance. The interior reminds me of the ‘old’ Las Vegas Pinball Hall of Fame on Tropicana. I can only guess that the Game Galaxy owners didn’t overspend on the decor. However, Game Galaxy arcade has been in business for 14 years, so they must be doing something right.

Game Galaxy boasts over 450 arcade video games and pinballs. The games on the game floor change frequently, so please see [their website](http://www.gamegalaxyarcade.com/) for the current details.

Stand-up arcade games

There is an area within Game Galaxy where new and used console games and game cartridges are bought and sold. Over 50 console games are available for play, each with a monitor/TV display.

Console games and cartridges for sale

Game Galaxy is an ‘all-you-care-to-play’ arcade. All their games are set on free play and you can purchase an hourly or daily pass. Current rates per person are $10 for an hour or $15 for all day. Group discounts are available for the asking.

Some of Game Galaxy’s pinballs

Before I dive into more details of this review, I wanted to note that Game Galaxy often has the very latest pinball games shortly after they are announced. An example is that *[Toy Story 4](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/06/20/toy-story-4-released/)* was available for free play here not long after Jersey Jack Pinball had revealed the game.

Please note that if a pinball is not turned on, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is unavailable to play. Ask an attendant to help you if there is a ‘dark’ game you wish to play.

Game Galaxy hosts monthly IPFA-sanctioned tournaments. These tournaments are held ‘after hours’ and are BYOB (adult beverages). Typically, there is a $10 cover charge and a $10 entry fee.

Here’s an excerpt from a recent tournament announcement:
“*8 Rounds of Group Matchplay. Top 6 or 8 to finals. The top 2 get a bye in the Top 6. The top 8 will have the top 2 players ‘run the bus’ and choose a game or order throughout the semifinals and finals. ‘8th place spot’ for qualify (or 4th) will play a ladder match on predetermined classics to determine the 8th spot (players 4567) or players 8, 9, 10, 11). Payout is 60/25/15.*”

I am not a tournament player, so I hope all that means something to someone.

Game Galaxy also has tournaments for console games. In most cases, players are welcome to bring their personal controllers, etc.
