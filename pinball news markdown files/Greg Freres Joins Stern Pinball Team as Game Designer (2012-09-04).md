He's well known as a prolific pinball artist and collaborator with Dennis Nordman on games such as the 'Party' series  for Bally, Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons and The Wizard of Oz for Jersey Jack Pinball, but now Greg Freres has joined the Stern Pinball team as artist and game designer.

Greg Freres

Greg began his career in pinball in the late '70s at Bally, where he stayed until the last Bally machine rolled off the production line with Revenge from Mars.

After that he became a freelance artist but didn't work on any more pinball games until the Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons project and then The Wizard of Oz.

Speaking in a Pinball News interview five years ago, Greg hinted he kept up with the developments at Stern and could, just possibly, end up working there. He said, "I   hardly ever get a chance to play pinball but I try to keep up with who’s   designing what game for Stern. I’ve been over there a couple times to   play the first test games. I can’t tell you what game I would want to do   because maybe someday I’ll have that chance."

Stern have hired who?

To announce Greg's new role, Stern Pinball put out a press release. Here's what they had to say:
