**Date:**
11th October - 15th October, 2017

**Location:**
Westin Chicago North Shore, 601 N Milwaukee Ave, Wheeling, IL 60090, USA

**While Pinball Expo doesn’t properly get into full swing until Thursday, Wednesday is the day when the show is set up, the first guests can register, and the Bumper Blast Welcome Party marks the official opening.**

Not unsurprisingly the weather was wet and windy in Chicago as guests began to arrive and check in to the hotel.

The registration desk opened in the late afternoon for both pre-registered guests and those looking to buy their passes in person.

Registering for the full weekend package with the banquet on Saturday evening cost $240 (€202/£182) or $210 without the banquet, with a $10 saving if you pre-registered.  Admission to individual parts of the show were: $30 per day for the show hall, $105 for show-long access to the hall, $90 for the banquet, $50 for the Stern Pinball factory tour and $60 for the seminars.

In the Vendor Hall, preparations were underway to build the stands and install the machines.

There was some concern that the Vendor Hall might be a little light on exhibitors this year, but the floor plan suggests most available spots have been taken.

Outside the Vendor Hall, the tournament machines were starting to arrive.

Around the corner from reception, in its usual place, was the *Hercules* machine.

Further down the same corridor is the Game Hall.  This is where the free play machines are set up and where the Expo Brawl tournament takes place on Friday morning.

Machines were still arriving and being set-up on Wednesday evening.

At 8pm the Bumper Blast Welcome Party began.

This is a free event for all show attendees, providing them with food and drink as well as a chance to mingle with other guests.  Food was served in the corridor outside the dining hall, while inside cold soft drinks and a dessert dish were available.

The food looked rather appetising, although we had eaten earlier in the day so didn’t try it ourselves.

In a change to previous years, several tables were themed, inviting guests to talk about specific topics.

[![Some of the themed tables](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2017/025-pinball-expo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2017/025-pinball-expo-2017.jpg)

That’s all from the first day of Pinball Expo 2017.

Tomorrow’s action begins at 9am as the buses leave for the Stern Pinball factory tour.  We’ll be there and will bring you all the latest news from Elk Grove Village, as well as the start of the seminars back at the hotel in Wheeling.
