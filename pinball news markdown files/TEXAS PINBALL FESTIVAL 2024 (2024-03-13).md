Welcome to our extensive coverage of this 20th Anniversary Texas Pinball Festival held at the Embassy Suites & Frisco Conference Center here in the city of Frisco, around 23 miles due north of Dallas.

[![The Embassy Suites hotel in Frisco](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/007-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/007-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The Embassy Suites hotel in Frisco

**WEDNESDAY**

The show doesn’t open to the public until Friday afternoon, but we’re here from Wednesday to bring you the build-up and show how this 20th anniversary Texas Pinball Festival is coming together.

We’ll update this report from now until the show closes and beyond, to make sure you get all the news and excitement.

First though, a little about the venue.

The show is held in the Frisco Conference Center which is attached to, but separate from, the Embassy Suites hotel. The Embassy Suites is the main show hotel and as such sells out almost immediately rooms for the next show become available, but the area has a plethora of lodging options. Paradoxically, the walk from the Embassy Suites to the Conference Center is sufficiently long, some alternative hotels are actually closer to the Conference Center.

[![Where the Embassy Suites ends and the walk to the Conference Center begins](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/008-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/008-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Where the Embassy Suites ends and the walk to the Conference Center begins

[![The corridor from the hotel to the Conference Center](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/006-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/006-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The corridor from the hotel to the Conference Center

The Embassy Suites and the Conference Center are closely linked in other ways though, and the Texas Pinball Festival effectively takes over both for the duration of the show. Indeed, the Pinball News and Pinball Magazine joint quiz, *So You Think You Know Pinball?* takes place in the bar of the Embassy Suites.

Also, the parking garage for the hotel and the Conference Center has been specially branded for this year’s Texas Pinball Festival.

[![The parking garage](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/009-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/009-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The parking garage

For those not staying at the Embassy Suites, the Conference Center has its own entrance.

The entrance to the Frisco Conference Center

A number of the parking spaces outside the Conference Center have been blocked off, presumably in preparation for Saturday’s swap meet, organised by the [DFW Pinball & Arcade Club](https://dfwpinball.com/).

So, that’s the venue. What about the show?

Well, as of Wednesday lunchtime there isn’t much to show you other than a mostly-empty hall?

[![The Texas Pinball Festival  show hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/001-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/001-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The Texas Pinball Festival show hall

Some setting up is under way. A selection of machines from Stern Pinball provided by [FUN! Billiards and Gameroom Superstore](https://pinballandmore.com/) are already in the hall, while a few others are trickling in.

[![A mixed bunch of machines from Stern Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/003-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x685.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/003-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

[![Perhaps the most important part of the whole show - the power](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/004-texas-pinball-festival-2024-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/004-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Perhaps the most important part of the whole show – the power

By this time tomorrow we expect the hall to be buzzing as companies prepare their stands in preparation for the opening on Friday. The organisers have been preparing for this special 20th anniversary show since the close of last year’s show, and we can expect a few changes. For one thing, if you’ve attended the Texas Pinball Festival in recent years, the floor layout will be a little different this time.

[![The floor plan for the 2024 Texas Pinball Festival](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/002-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x731.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/002-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Material for the on-site registration and pre-registration packs has arrived

The Seminar Room is still in the same place though, and we’ll be reporting on the extensive schedule of presentations taking place there on Friday and Saturday.

**THURSDAY**

Thursday is the main set-up day for the show floor.

[![Thursday morning in the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/012-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/012-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Thursday morning in the main hall

With the booths marked out on the floor yesterday, the dividers are going in as more machines and parts arrive. There are also ceiling-hung banners to mark out many of the stands to help guests locate them.

[![Some of the banners hung over the stands](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/013-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x627.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/013-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Some of the banners hung over the stands

The Stern Pinball machines we showed above are still in their boxes while the joint Marco/FUN! stand is built.

[![The Marco and FUN! stand representing Stern Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/014-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/014-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

At the back of the hall is the loading bay where trucks back-up and disgorge their contents of machines and parts.

[![Trucks unload their machines and parts](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/015-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/015-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Trucks unload their machines and parts

As usual, there are four staging points where unloaded games can be stacked before moving to their final destination in the hall. This speeds up the unloading process and frees up the loading bay for the next truck.

[![The four staging points for unloaded machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/016-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/016-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Mayfair Amusements has a head-start on setting up their stand

By late afternoon things were taking shape, with most exhibitors hoping to set up their stand by the end of the day.

[![Setting up games at the Spooky Pinball stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/022-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x678.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/022-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Another Spooky Pinball game is unboxed

Dave Peck’s Motörhead homebrew game was also on the Spooky Pinball stand. It uses the same control system as Spooky games and includes assistance from some of the Spooky team members. Could this be a future Spooky release?

[![Also on the Spooky stand was this impressive-looking Motörhead hombrew](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/030-texas-pinball-festival-2024-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/030-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The Chicago Gaming stand is directly in front of what had previously been the main hall entrance. This has now been moved along the corridor towards the Seminars Room.

[![The previous main hall entrance](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/036-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/036-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The previous main hall entrance

Not all the action takes place in the main hall though. There are vendor stands outside in the corridor, there’s the Seminars Room and, of course, the many tournaments being held in their own dedicated space.

[![Looking back towards the registration booth](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/037-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x630.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/037-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Looking towards the seminars room

The Seminars Room looks pretty much unchanged from previous shows, with a stage for the speakers and plenty of seating.

[![This way to the seminars](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/039-texas-pinball-festival-2024-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/039-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

This way to the seminars – Ooh, and here are next year’s dates!

[![The Seminars Room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/040-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/040-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The Seminars Room

As in other recent shows, the tournament have their own dedicated space one floor up on the corridor from the hotel to the main hall. The location is not immediately visible unless you know it’s there, but those taking part know where to go.

[![Machines are set up for the tournaments](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/019-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/019-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Machines are set up for the tournaments

There are four tournaments overall – the Texas Wizards Tournament, the Classics Side Tournament, the Women’s Tournament and the Kids’ Tournament.

[![Tournament players line up to register](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/041-texas-pinball-festival-2024-804x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/041-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

There’s plenty of seating for the competitors

Later in the day we returned to the show floor to check on the progress setting everything up.

In the lobby area, those who had pre-registered for the Texas Pinball Festival were able to collect their wristbands, badges and show guides.

[![Pre-registered guests collecting their packs](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/046-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x672.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/046-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Pre-registered guests collecting their packs

Inside the main hall, Nitro Pinball had a Centaur Revisited from Haggis Pinball. It appeared to have early code with some features not working quite right, but the mechanical build quality was outstanding.

[![Centaur Revisited from Haggis Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/045-texas-pinball-festival-2024-513x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/045-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Centaur Revisited from Haggis Pinball

If Centaur Revisited is a title for the future, there is always an educational hand-on display in the hall celebrating pinball’s past.

Setting up the History Of Pinball exhibit

American Pinball had set up their Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge machines. There were three on their own stand and at least one other on a distributor’s stand. Plus, there may well be another one available to play in a room in the Embassy Suites for those in the know.

[![Barry O's Barbecue Challenge on the American Pinball stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/048-texas-pinball-festival-2024-704x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/048-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

A stone’s trow away, Lord of the Gameroom were building their impressive-looking stand.

Over on Brad Albright’s stand, he was exhibiting the playfield and backglass artwork he created for the Motörhead game.

Pinball Brothers team members are not expected to attend the Texas Pinball Festival this year, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be well-represented at the show. Some of their games and equipment had arrived in the hall, including two Alien Ripley Edition machines.

[![Items for the Pinball Brothers' stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/051-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x724.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/051-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Items for the Pinball Brothers’ stand

Although FUN! Billiards & Gameroom Superstore and collaborating with Marco to create the Stern Pinball display, FUN! also have their own stand.

[![The FUN! stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/052-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/052-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Meanwhile, upstairs in the tournament room there was the Scrutinizer Tournament taking place.

[![The Scrutinizer Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/055-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x640.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/055-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The Scrutinizer Tournament

Although not part of the official Texas Pinball Festival schedule of events, this tournament gives the organisers an opportunity to test out all the machines in advance of the main events beginning on Friday morning.

[![Medals for the top players in the Scrutinizer Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/056-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/056-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

That included opening it up and reseating all the connectors, as they can work loose during transport. They recommended installing plastic protectors to protect the unique artworked playfield plastics, and replace any black rubber rings or flipper rubbers with either polyurethane or silicone alternatives to reduce the dirt and dust spread across the playfield.

**SATURDAY**

Despite the threat of rain, Saturday at the Texas Pinball Festival began as usual with the swap meet, organised by the DFW Pinball & Arcade Club, in the parking lot outside the Conference Center. Previously it had officially started at 8am with an unofficial earlier start for keen bargain hunters. This year that early start was made official, beginning in the dark at 6am.

We didn’t quite make it to the swap meet at 6am, preferring to wait until there was just a little bit of natural light by which to check out the items for sale.

Plain and simple

Saturday at the TPF featured a full day of seminars, starting at 9am with the Barrels of Fun team.

**9am – More Than A Barrel Of Fun – Barrels of Fun**

[![The Barrels of Fun team: (Bowen Kerins, Phil Grimaldi, Brian Savage, Jessica DeNardo, David van Es & Trent Armstrong](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/211-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x506.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/211-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Company CEO David van Es introduced the Barrels of Fun team on stage with him and also recognised those members who were in the audience.

[![David van Es](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/201-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x680.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/201-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

David van Es

Trent Armstrong then explained how, when designing their launch title, *Labyrinth*, they wanted the player to become fully immersed in the world of *Labyrinth* rather thank just be presented with a series of clips from the movie.

Phil, who is leading the rules design for the game, told the audience about a new Tea Party multiball mode which they had just added to the code.

David then asked the audience to give the team feedback about the types of themes they would like to see turned into a future Barrels of Fun pinball.

**10am – How To: Create The Most Awesome Manual – Butch Peel**

[![Butch Peel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/202-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x593.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/202-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Butch Peel

Butch was at TPF to talks about the manual – both printed and electronic – he created for the Chicago Gaming/PlayMechanix pinball, *Pulp Fiction*.

He said pinball documentation should always be accurate, comprehensive, consistent, straightforward, and aesthetically pleasing, with a show-and-tell philosophy working best. Having it in full-colour also aids clarity and brings explanations to life.

Butch stressed how important information bears repetition, while having both a printed and an electronic version – complete with hundreds of links throughout – was vital.

**11am – How To: Learn The Essentials Of Pinball Maintenance & Repair – Imoto Harney, Matthew Talley & Eugene Mosh**

[![Imoto Harney, Matthew Talley and Eugene Mosh](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/214-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x655.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/214-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Imoto Harney, Matthew Talley and Eugene Mosh

Eugene first spoke about his long history in coin-op gaming and repairs, and more recently, pinball.

Matthew described the basic pinball repair and maintenance tools everyone should own, such as the different types of screwdrivers, nut drivers, a magnetic pick-up tool, Allen keys. pliers, snips and wire strippers.

He then moved on to talk about rebuilding your flippers – why you should do it, how often, and the different type of flipper mechanisms used by different manufacturers.

**12pm – How To: Homebrew Avoiding Electrical Pitfalls – David Beecher**

[![David Beecher](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/204-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x687.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/204-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

David Beecher

David is one of the founders of FAST Pinball and designer of their pinball control system currently being used in several commercial games as well as many more homebrew designs. He described the differences between their two product ranges – a retro one for replacing existing boards in a game so it can be repaired or rethemed, and a modern one for building new game designs from scratch.

He continued, talking about power supply considerations when building a pinball, looking closely at the specifications to ensure it can handle the large inrush when the machine is first switched on, and provide enough current during play.

**2pm – How To: Homebrew Making Pinball, Making Friends – Panel Discussion**

[![The Homebrew Making Pinball, Making Friends panel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/205-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x470.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/205-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The Homebrew Making Pinball, Making Friends panel

Hosted by FAST Pinball’s Aaron Davis, this discussion panel included makers of five of the homebrew games appearing on the TPF show floor. They were:

* Sean Irby (*Eight Ball Beyond*)
* Eric Klotz (*Saw*)
* Kyle Smet (*Friday the 13th*)
* Angel Montano (Mechwarriors – Mercenary 5 Pinball)
* Anthony Van Winkle (*Swords of Vengence*)

They were joined by Ernie Silverberg of Trident Pinball who makes starter kits for anyone looking to create their own game design.

**3pm – Inconceivable! Multimorphic introduces their latest game, *The Princess Bride* – Multimorphic Team**

[![Gerry Stellenberg](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/206-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x636.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/206-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Head of Multimorphic, Gerry Stellenberg, introduced the team on stage who are part of the team responsible for the latest new game for the P3 pinball platform, *The Princess Bride*.

Stephen Silver is the creative lead for the game, with Josh and Steve writing the code and Colin crafting the ruleset. They talked about the features in the game, all the movie assets they were able to call on, plus the additional pinball-specific music and quotes.

Gerry also spoke about the different versions of the game, the new cabinet front artwork and how the cost of a *The Princess Bride* kit compares to the cost of purchasing a complete new game from other manufacturers.

[![The Multimorphic team with their The Princess Bride pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/217-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x733.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/217-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Each creator talked about their vision for their game, their control system of choice, the motivations they had to complete the project, and the challenges they faced along the way.

**4pm – Behind The Game: Foo Fighters – Tanio Klyce**

[![Tanio Klyce](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/208-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x673.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/208-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Tanio Klyce

Tanio was the lead coder on the recent Stern Pinball title, *Foo Fighters*. He said he doesn’t take the lead on too many games – his last was *Deadpool* – as he usually works on other software including the Insider Connected platform – but was delighted to work with lead designer, Jack Danger, on his first full cornerstone design.

Tanio spoke about the choice of theme, the design process, the way the rules are structured and the overarching storyline wrapping them all together. It was intended Jack Danger would be joining Tanio on-stage at TPF but he had to cancel at the last minute due to a family emergency.

**5pm – So You Think You Know Pinball? – Martin Ayub & Jonathan Joosten**

[![So You Think You Know Pinball? hosts Jonathan Joosten and Martin Ayub](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2023/405-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2023-1024x693.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/dutch-pinball-open-expo-2023/405-dutch-pinball-open-expo-2023-scaled.jpg)

So You Think You Know Pinball? hosts Jonathan Joosten and Martin Ayub

Martin and Jonathan returned for another edition of their free prize quiz, held in the Cypress Lounge in the Embassy Suites.

The format was unchanged from previous years, with a series of pinball-related questions, each with two possible answers. Everyone in the audience stood up and took part initially, splitting into two groups depending on which of the two answers they thought was the correct one. Those in the group which got the answer correct continued to the next question, while those who got it wrong sat down for the remainder of this round.

After a series of questions, the number of remaining contestants was reduced to 4 or 5, at which point everyone got to pick a prize ticket from a bowl. The many prizes available to win all had matching tickets, so everyone still in the quiz got the corresponding prize, no matter how big or small it was.

The next round then started with everyone back in the quiz.

Prizes were generously donated by American Pinball, Barrels of Fun, Multimorphic, Jersey Jack Pinball, Spooky Pinball, Christopher Franchi, Dutch Pinball, PinSound, Back Alley Creations, Nitro Pinball, Pinball Magazine, Pinball News, Turner Pinball and Stern Pinball.

The prizes included playfields from *Labyrinth* and *Galactic Tank Force*, backglasses from *Labyrinth*, *Legends of Valhalla* and *Hot Wheels*, translites from *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* and *Looney Tunes*, banners for *Elton John* and *The Godfather*, plus lots of T-shirts, bottle openers, plastic sets and more.

**6pm – Autograph Session**

At 6pm, show guests could bring pinball items they wanted to be signed to the signing table which was set up in the Conference Center’s lobby.

The autograph session

Show speakers were in attendance, armed with Sharpies and ready to sign guest’s personal items or flyers for the games on which they worked.

The session ran for around an hour.

**7pm – Let’s Get Looney – Cary Hardy & Spooky Pinball**

[![The Spooky Pinball team](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/134-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x438.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/134-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Cary Hardy

Cary Hardy introduced this panel Q&A about Spooky Pinball and their latest two releases, *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* and *Looney Tunes*.

They talked about how, despite the two games sharing a single playfield layout, the rules, artwork and assets are all completely different, before explaining the rules design philosophy for *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* and the process which led to Brad becoming the artist for the *Looney Tune*s game.

**8pm – An Evening With George Gomez**

[![George Gomez](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/210-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x703.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/210-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

George was accompanied by a team from Stern Pinball but began this seminar by talking about the past year at the company before showing some behind-the-scenes pictures of the design team, an early concept for the topper for 007 James Bond and the original arc motion for Bond’s jetpack model.

Several of the panel members then talked about their history in pinball, how they came to be part of the Stern Pinball team, and what they have recently been working on.

The Stern seminar was the final presentation for the 2024 Texas Pinball Festival, but there was still one other event to be hosted in the seminars room.

The band [Go-Go Rillas](https://thegogorillas.com/) (consisting of Bingo, Bango, Bongo and Fred) took to the stage at 11pm and went bananas for around an hour.

[![The Go-Go Rillas on stage](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/233-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/233-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

For those guests who didn’t want to venture too far from the TPF show, there were food trucks set up in the car park just outside the Conference Center’s entrance.

[![One of the food trucks parked just outside the building's entrance](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/404-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/404-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

During a gap in the seminars at 1pm resulting from the non-appearance of a speaker, we took the opportunity to record our UHD 4K Tour video of this year’s Texas Pinball Festival.

Obviously, it was a busy time in the show hall, but we managed to navigate our way through the crowds to cover every machine and vendor stand. Plus we explore the corridors, side rooms, seminar room and the tournaments room. We hope you enjoy it.

In the tournaments room, Saturday was a very busy day with the finals of the Kids Bump and Win, the finals of the Classics, and the finals of all three divisions of the Texas Wizards tournament.

[![Trophies and plaques for the top players in each division](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/601-texas-pinball-festival-2024-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/601-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

**Kids’ Bump ‘N Win**

Qualifying for the Kids’ tournament began at midday on Friday and continued until 2pm on Saturday.

The format was a simple highest score tournament held on Jaws. Players had to be aged 12 or under and they could have up to a maximum of two $5 entries each. Each entry consisted of two games. The highest score they achieved in any game would be their qualifying score.

[![Trophies for the top four in the Kids' tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/020-texas-pinball-festival-2024-827x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/020-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

In that final, it was a triumphant win for Liam Bradley whose 730M score was way out in front. His nearest competitor was second-placed Miles Bradley who achieved 143.3M. In third place on 75.1M was Carter Fell, while fourth went to Orazio Strealy on 41.8M.

Congratulations to all the players and especially to the four finalists.

**Classics**

Entry to the Classics Tournament cost $30 for ten games spread across any of the available machines. The player’s best score on 4 different machines made up their overall ranking. The top score on a machine earned 200 points, second place was 195 points, and third 190 points, with each place beyond that earning 1 point less.

The top 24 players qualified for the finals which would be played as 4-player 3-game groups. The top 8 of those received a bye through the first round.

The final of the Classics tournament

In the three games of the final, Mark won on Ice Fever, Geoff won on Barracora, and Jack won on Harlem Globetrotters. Jack’s second place on Ice Fever and third on Barracora was enough to earn him the win. Mark was second, while Eric and Geoff were tied for third which Eric won on a tie-breaker on Sorcerer.

| Final Position | Player Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Jack Revnew |
| 2 | Mark Meserve |

Classics Tournament top four

The Texas Wizards tournament qualifying, like the Classics, began on Friday morning at 10am. Unlike the Classics though, it continued until 4pm on Saturday, with the play-offs beginning at 5pm.

There were three divisions in the Texas Wizards – A, B and Novice. The top 24 qualifiers made it into the A division, the next 8 who were IFPA-ranked outside the top 500 in the world qualified for the B division, and the next 8 who were IFPA-ranked outside the top 3,000 made it to the Novice division.

The 8 qualifiers in the Texas Wizards Novice division

All play-offs were played as 4-player 3-game matches, usually on one vintage, one classic and one modern machine, with a 4-2-1-0 points award for 1st-4th places.

Starting with the Novice division, the 8 qualifiers were cut to 4 finalists in the semi-finals. The four finalists were Shawn Quinn, Bryce Bush, Sven Johnson and (after a tie-breaker) Kelly Moncla.

In the final played on *Time Machine*, *Avatar* and *Kiss*, it was a win for Bryce Bush who came top in 2 or the 3 games. Kelly Moncla was second, Sven Johnson was third and Shawn Quinn fourth.

Moving to the B division, the two 4-player semi-finals saw Clark McCoy, Michael Hew, Geoff Davis and Jon Stewart progress to the final.

Their final was played on *Viking*, *Terminator 2* and *Jaws*, and in a very close contest saw a win for Jon Stewart who won a tie-breaker for first with Clark McCoy. Geoff Davis was third and Michael Hew fourth, with just 1 point separating each position.

In the A division, the top 8 qualifiers had a bye through to the quarter-finals, so the remaining 16 played the first round to reduce that number to 8. The 8 from the first round joined the 8 with a bye in the quarter-finals which reduce those 16 down to the 8 who competed in the semi-finals.

They were: Bowen Kerins, Derek Thomson, Garrett Shahan, Marc Jackson, Preston Moncla, Sanjay Shah, Wesley Johnson and Eric Stone.

The two semi-final resulted in Bowen Kerins, Sanjay Shah, Marc Jackson and Eric Stone going into the final.

Bowen started strongly with a win on *Super Spin*. Eric was second, Marc third and Sanjay fourth.

Play moved on to *Time Machine* which was a total reversal of positions on *Super Spin*, with Sanjay first, Marc second, Eric third and Bowen fourth.

So, going into the third and final game, *Metallica*, it was 4 points for Bowen and Sanjay, 3 points for Eric and Marc. Whoever won on Metallica would win overall.

[![Metallica is prepared as the last game of the A division final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/604-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x530.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/604-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Bowen led off, putting together a solid performance on his first two balls for a total of 41M.

[![Bowen starts the last game of the final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/605-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x519.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/605-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

Bowen starts the last game of the final

However, Eric did better and had a 71M total after his first two balls. Neither Sanjay nor Marc put in a great ball, languishing around the 1M mark.

Bowen had another solid ball to bring his three ball total up to 97M. Sanjay improved, but could only reach just shy of 29M after his third ball. Marc improved slightly but remained in fourth on a little under 7M.

Eric began on 71M with Bowen 97M as his target.

![Can Eric overtake Bowen's total?](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/606-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x582.jpg)

Can Eric overtake Bowen’s total?

Eric started Crank It Up mode, choosing For Whom The Bell Tolls as his song. He collected a 14M pay-off to end the mode thinking it was enough, but it only gave him 95M, with just a small end-of-ball bonus. Not yet enough.

However, a few Lady Justice shots soon saw him reach the target and take the win.

[![Sanjay congratulates Eric on his win](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/607-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x521.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/607-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

So, Eric was first, Bowen second, Sanjay third and Marc fourth.

**SUNDAY**

Sunday is a much shorter TPF day than Saturday, with the show hall opening at 9am and closing five hours later at 2pm.

We strive to cover all the vendors and machines at the show both in video and in pictures. You can see the video version above shot on Saturday lunchtime, here are the pictures taken the following day. Sadly, although there were still three hours of the show still to go, several vendors had decided to start packing up and heading back home.

Sunday in the tournaments room means the Texas Takedown Women’s Pinball Championship.

Qualifying took place from 9am until noon, with entry costing $20. There were 68 places available, with all being registered before the start. Additional players were put on a waitlist.

Players played in 8 rounds of 4-player groups, with groups and machines played chosen by the Matchplay tournament software. 3-2-1-0 points were awarded for the finishing positions in each match.

[![The commentary team and audience for the Texas Takedown Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/520-texas-pinball-festival-2024-1024x646.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2024/520-texas-pinball-festival-2024.jpg)

The commentary team and audience for the Texas Takedown Tournament

After all 8 rounds had been played, the four players with the most points moved on to the final.

They were:
1. Danielle Peck (24 pts.)
2. Tracy Abrahams (19 pts.)
3. Lexi Whittemore (18 pts.)
4. Louise Wagensonner (17.5 pts.)

The final consisted of three games held on the machines *Spin Out*, *Whirlwind* and *Metallica* using a 4-2-1-0 scoring format.

After the first two games, Lexi Whittemore was leading with 6 points, Danielle Peck was close behind on 5 points, Louise Wagensonner had 3 points and Tracy Abrahams had yet to score.

With only Danielle left to play her final ball, Louise had a strong lead with Lexi in last place. It looked likely there would be a tie for first place on 7 points, but Danielle put in a very strong final ball to overtake Louise’s score and seal the win.

When the main hall closes, a presentation ceremony begins in the seminars room where awards are given for the Best-in-Show machines in 14 categories and the draw for the raffle prize pinball machine takes place.

First though, TPF show organisers Paul McKinney and Robert Harris thanked everyone for coming and thanked all the many vendors, machine owners and show guests who make the Texas Pinball Festival what it is.
