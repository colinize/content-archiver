**Date:**

**Location:**
#04-24/29 City Square Mall, 80 Kitchener Road, Singapore 208539

I visited Singapore in November and December 2017 with my family.   One of my tasks was to locate as many pinballs as possible.

My third location was the Timezone game centre in the City Square mall.

The only game – a Spider-Man (Stern, 2007) – was located in a hidden corner of the Timezone centre.

The Stern Spider-Man

It cost S$1.50 ($1.12/€0.94/£0.83) per game, which is relatively cheap compared to other Timezone centres.

Although its condition was just on an acceptable level, I could still break a number of records.
