American Pinball’s current title, *Legends of Valhalla*, which was designed by Riot Pinball, was launched just under one year ago. At that time there were two editions available – Classic and Deluxe, with the Deluxe the first to be produced with limited run of 500 units.

Now the company has rejigged the line up by adding a new base Classic model and bumping the previous Deluxe (which sold out long ago) up to a Limited Deluxe, while the previous Classic now becomes the Deluxe.

The new Classic edition of Legends of Valhalla

The price of the new Classic model is $7,395 while the Deluxe model is $7,995. By comparison, the original price for the Limited Deluxe when it launched was $8,395.

The new Classic edition

The new Deluxe gains some of the extras from the Limited Deluxe edition such as the anti-reflective ‘Magic Glass’ and a shaker motor. However, the custom sculpted and hand-painted models Odin, the skull pile, the arch and the shields on the ship remain exclusive to the Limited Deluxe and are replaced by flat plastics in both the currently-available variants. All versions get the sculpted and hand-painted Thor’s Hammer model though.

Here’s the original sculpted model of Odin from the Limited Deluxe model.

And here’s the flat plastic in the new Classic and the Deluxe models which is now at the bottom of the centre ramp.

The playfield features and gameplay continue to be consistent across all three models, with differences largely being cosmetic.

Here’s how American Pinball announced their new line-up:

| **Legends of Valhalla Classic**  Hello Pinball Fans.   We are proud to announce the well anticipated release of Legends of Valhalla (LOV) Classic edition.   We’re amazed how fast the year has gone and Pinball Expo upon us again. We will display Legends of Valhalla Classic at Pinball Expo and IAAPA this year.   Our plan is to keep the LOV lines running so when the last Limited Deluxe comes off the line, the Classic version can immediately start, tentatively in the beginning of 2023.   It has been a busy year since the launch of LOV Limited Deluxe in October 2021 which we have continued working hard at producing in spite of challenges.   We would like to thank Scott Gullicks for the Interior Cabinet Art Set that is now available for all editions.   We also thank Frank Gigliotti and Steve Bowden for the continued advancement of rules and code for a tournament worthy game.  Many tournament directors have now been using this game with players very receptive for it.  Of course, we will continue to make small tweaks where needed. |

Finally, here’s the flyer for the new model:
