A
FLOATER IN THE

GENE POOL?

Story
dated 28th November, 2002.

The
repro-wars are well and truly under way. Illinois Pinball has sent
some of its distributors a warning letter threatening loss of dealer
status if they sell non-licensed Williams parts. Meanwhile various
reproduction parts sellers are engaged in furious mudslinging.

There
has always been an unhealthy level of competition amongst some repro
makers and now IPB have stepped into the fight with this letter to
some of its distributors.

Remember, this is a letter
to IPB's trading partners threatening to sue them. Even ignoring the
poor grammar and highly suspect legal standing, this is not the best
way to continue a business relationship.

It broadly mirrors the
message from IPB's President
at Pinball Expo in October, only then it was to parts makers themselves.
Now it's the dealers' turn.

Obviously IPB is entirely
within its rights to choose who to do business with within the terms
of their licence with WMS, and any company selling non-IPB parts as
official Williams parts is in breach of far more than a distribution
agreement. So why the fuss?

It's the "This includes
all unlicensed parts that are manufactured" that could be taken
as a much wider warning to other repro manufacturers.

There's no doubt that IPB
have been slow to get parts made and the promises have been coming
for several years now, so naturally others have filled the void and
made replacement parts for games in their own way. Many of these have
been of excellent quality, but in all cases they risk the attention
of the lawyers if they either use copyrighted artwork, patented ideas
or they pass themselves off as genuine game manufacturer products.

The recent case of a Twilight
Zone clock housing fell foul of the latter charge when it was stamped
with a Williams part number, and there are several people reproducing
slingshots and other playfield plastics using copyrighted art. Hopefully
it is these people who are the subject of the message.

In the case of the TZ part,
Gene Cunningham said it was Williams who took action against the seller
and that they are the ones who would take future action which makes
the above letter all the more confusing.

IPB claim that buyers of
non-IPB parts have been calling them to complain about the poor quality
of these and this has led them to issue the warning. However there
hasn't exactly been a flood of complaints in the public pinball forums.

So what are collectors
to do?

IPB do have far more stock
than most people realise, but they're not good at filling orders or
reproducing much needed parts.

So we have a near free-for-all
and the attendant infighting.Sadly
the net result is mistrust amongst buyers and the dragging through
the mud of the many honest, reliable and quality manufacturers.

The
question above has now become "What are collectors and distributors
supposed to do?"

IPB themselves
are currently the subject of abuse and contempt in the rec.games.pinball
newsgroup with threats of boycott and anti-Gene campaigns amongst
the milder reactions from collectors and resellers alike.

Presumably
IPB felt they had to act, but did they appreciate the backlash?
