Story dated 28th September
2001.

Two
press releases from Stern show how the company has a dilemma. On the
one hand they have a new game just being released - Monopoly - while
they are also promoting the outgoing game - Austin Powers.

The
first press release is Stern's announcement of Monopoly. Yes of course
you've read all about the game here at Pinball News for quite a while
but it's Stern's policy not to formally announce their next game until
it goes into production.

Stern also
include a bunch of images - nothing we haven't shown you before
but there is a nice shot of the bank shown opposite.

It also
reinforces our review's comments about its `minimalist' looks
and the cheap feel of uncovered microswitches and wires.

Like the
prototype - and unlike the sample game - these pictures show
a pink magic-flipper which makes a lot of sense.

By making
it a different colour there's less chance that a novice will
think they have some kind of control of it like a regular flipper.

Apart from
these points the other pictures are unremarkable and we won't
waste your bandwidth reproducing them here.

Instead,
you can read Stern's words below.

September
19, 2001 - MONOPOLY®, the best-selling board game of all-time
is now the hottest pinball machine on the boardwalk. Brought
to you by Stern Pinball, Inc., Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE:HAS) and Pat
Lawlor Design, the MONOPOLY pinball is designed by Pat Lawlor
and his team of mechanical and programming engineers. Pat Lawlor
has designed some of the most famous titles in the history of
pinball, including The Addams Family®, Twilight Zone®,
Funhouse™, Whirlwind®, and Earthshaker™. These
machines, even today, consistently rank among the top earners
on both the RePlay and Play Meter Pinball Polls. This MONOPOLY-themed
game is made in the great tradition of these classic pinball
machines

The
MONOPOLY game has a grand history. In 1934, during the height
of the United States' Great Depression, Charles Darrow sold
his board game to Parker Brothers (now a part of Hasbro), who
in turn brought it to the public. Within a year, MONOPOLY became
the best-selling board game in the country. The MONOPOLY game
has since sold an estimated 200 million copies in 80 countries,
and has been produced in 26 languages. Stern Pinball, Hasbro,
and Pat Lawlor Design are proud that the MONOPOLY game is now
their newest pinball machine title.

Some
of the MONOPOLY pinball machine's classic features include:
an Electric Company billboard, a bi-directional, rotating mini-flipper
in the Water Works, and a Ride on the Railroad ramp. Also, you
can take a lesson from MR. MONOPOLY and break the Bank, start
the cash grab, and shoot the upper ramps for big MONOPOLY points.

The goal of the MONOPOLY pinball machine is to move your piece
around the game board, collect properties, and lock balls. When
you pass GO, multi-ball will start and you can become the millionaire
you've always dreamed of being!

The
MONOPOLY pinball machine also features an outstanding art package
by John Youssi, fantastic sounds and music by Incredible Technologies,
and the voice of MR. MONOPOLY, who makes all sales final.

Pat
Lawlor says, "We have designed an outstanding street piece
with a timeless theme that should be a strong earner for a long
time to come."

"We're
very excited to have Pat Lawlor designing this pinball,"
adds Gary Stern. "We really feel that this will be our
biggest game yet."

So
what of Stern's other press release? That one informs us that there
will be another Austin Powers movie in Summer 2003. The timing of
this information is, perhaps, rather unfortunate since Stern are at
the end of their production run.

Perhaps
they're trying to drum up enough interest for a second run? If not,
it's only purpose seems to be to make the existing owners feel happier
with their purchases. Surely they can't have a large number of unsold
machines? You decide:

September
24, 2001 -Stern Pinball, Inc. has learned that New Line Cinema
is going ahead with "Goldmember", the third and final
installment in the AUSTIN POWERS series. With a scheduled release
date of July 26, 2002, "Goldmember" will bring back
Mike Myers as all of the classic characters, including Austin
Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Myers' newest addition to
the series, the villainous Goldmember. The third AUSTIN POWERS
movie will also bring back Jay Roach, director of the first
two installments, Verne Troyer as Mini-Me, Robert Wagner and
Rob Lowe as both the old and young No. 2, and Heather Graham
giving a cameo appearance before Austin finds his new love interest.

At present,
the AUSTIN POWERS pinball machine is posting Stern Pinball's
strongest earnings since SOUTH PARK. Rated Number One in both
the RePlay and Play Meter poll meter for the month of August,
the release of the new AUSTIN POWERS movie will only strengthen
the pinball machines' earning power in both the short term
and the long run. Stern Pinball is very proud to have such
a strong title in AUSTIN POWERS.

your AUSTIN POWERS pinball machine, contact your nearest Stern
Pinball distributor. You can also contact Jolly Backer at
