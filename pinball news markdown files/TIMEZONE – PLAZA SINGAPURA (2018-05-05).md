**Date:**
29th November, 2017

**Location:**
#07-02/03 Plaza Singapura, 68 Orchard Road, Singapore 238839

I visited Singapore in November and December 2017 with my family.   One of my tasks was to locate as many pinballs as possible.

My first location was the Timezone game centre in Plaza Singapura, which is located on Orchard Road.

Timezone at Plaza Singapura

I arrived at the Plaza Singapura in in late evening. It was not difficult to find either Timezone or the *Transformers* LE (Stern, 2011) game．

Transformers LE

The amazing thing was that it is a Limited Edition model.

The disappointing thing was that the game was obviously lacking any regular maintenance.

Because of this I only spent ten minutes playing the game.
