**Date:**
July 2019

**Location:** 170 Yorktown Shopping Center, Lombard, IL 60148, USA

A new pinball-heavy arcade just opened called *[The Game Show](http://www.GameShowArcade.com/)*. It is located in the [Yorktown Shopping Center](https://yorktowncenter.com/) in Lombard, Illinois, on the East side lower level of the mall, right by JCPenney.

The arcade is located near JCPenney at the mall

The arcade is owned by Mark Czarnowski, who opened the [Chicago Street Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/sites/chicagostreet/index.html) arcade in Joliet five years ago. Unfortunately, downtown Joliet was not a very popular place for people to visit, so Mark decided to move to Lombard where there is more people traffic and, hopefully, customers.

The Yorktown mall looks well maintained and occupied with stores. I enjoyed visiting Mark’s now-closed Joliet arcade, but I think he will do much better in Lombard due to all the mall visitors every day.

The arcade features sixteen pins and lots of video games. Mark said he is adding Skee-Ball, a basketball shooter, and more fighting video games.

The pricing for the arcade is $15 for free play on the video games, or $20 for free play on the video games and the pins, except for the six Stern pins at the front of the arcade.

Those pins are an additional $1 each play ($5 for seven plays). If you purchase the $20 free play admission version, a $5 credit is given on any of the pay-to-play Stern pins.
