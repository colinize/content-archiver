Full Tilt Tavern in Bloomington, Minnesota

**INTRODUCTION**

Full Tilt Tavern – Simply a food and sports bar?

Full Tilt Tavern is an expansion of businesses by restaurateur Mike Tupa. It has been described as, “*A place for people of all ages. There are games for everyone. The monthly specials on drinks is something special. There is a build your own burger with possibly more ingredient options than any other place.*”

Per the concept proposal to the city, “*Full Tilt Tavern is a welcoming and unique retro classic atmosphere with a twist of modern and rustic themes that delivers a full service casual restaurant and bar that’s immersed in sports, games and builds an environment that attracts guests looking for fun, fresh creative food offerings and high quality beverages.*” (More on that later.)

In general, our impression is entertainment-focused dining and drinking. (More on that later.)

Mike Tupa’s Premier Hospitality also owns several sports bars:

* **Babe’s Music Bar** and Grill in Lakeville in Minnesota
* **Smilin’ Moose Lodge Bar & Grill** in Hudson in Wisconsin
* **Wild Bill’s Sports Saloon** with four locations throughout Minnesota and one in North Dakota.

Tupa also previously owned **St. Paul Tap Sports Bar & Gaming Company** (More on that later too.)

Getting back to Full Tilt Tavern (or ‘FTT’ from now on) and according to their website, “At Full Tilt Tavern, we know dining out is so much more than grabbing a burger or a slice of pizza and a beer. It’s about the feeling you leave with. That’s why we provide an immersive experience that will leave guests of all ages saying ‘*every day should feel this good.*‘”

**LOCATION**

FTT is located west-central, just on the south side of the ‘494 loop’, in Bloomington, MN.

[![Putting FTT on the map](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/003-full-tilt-tavern-1024x709.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/003-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

Putting FTT on the map

This building was originally built as a restaurant in 1971. Though it changed menus with each of the dozen or so name/owner changes, it has always remained a restaurant.

**OPENING HOURS**

The opening hours are:

* Monday-Wednesday: 11am to 12am
* Thursday & Friday: 11am to 2am
* Saturday: 10am to 2am
* Sunday: 10am to 12am

[Party bookings](https://www.fulltilttavern.com/bookings) are also available with their own menu.

FTT has several patios – including [the dog patio](https://www.fulltilttavern.com/dog-patio). With, of course, a dedicated ‘Puppy Menu’.

FTT has also filed with the city to install a roof-top patio and… a slide. Both are yet to happen, but are still planned.

**PARKING**

There is a restively small parking strip on the north side of the FTT building, and an even smaller strip on the south side.

[![There is room for about a dozen vehicles on the north side of the building](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/006-full-tilt-tavern-1024x616.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/006-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

A tiny bit of front door parking

Most of the parking is in a spacious lot on the east side of the building.

**VENUE**

Walking into FTT felt more like walking into an entertainment center than a restaurant.

However, being a restaurant, we were cheerfully greeted by hostesses the moment we walked in on a very busy Saturday afternoon.

[![Happy and helpful hostesses](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/009-full-tilt-tavern-1024x773.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/009-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

Happy and helpful hostesses

Even though most of the building was full and bustling, the hostesses easily had everything under control. And in fact, the entire staff performed their jobs cheerfully and exceedingly well.

The inside of the building was painted like the cabinet of an ’80s Williams pinball machine!

**FOOD**

FTT has a [full menu](https://www.fulltilttavern.com/eat-drink), including gluten-free and dog-friendly choices.

[![The menu](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/012-full-tilt-tavern-818x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/012-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

The menu

Our first food order was take-home. The second was enjoyed in the restaurant. Both experiences proved the food far superior to “fast food”.

[![Fried pickles, cheese curds and the Full Tilt burger](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/051-full-tilt-tavern-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/051-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

**MENU**

FTT has possibly the greatest amount of burger ingredients in the entire known universe. We had several things from the menu, including the burger. As someone else put it, the food was “elevated”.

[![Selections from the menu](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/013-full-tilt-tavern-1024x774.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/013-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

Selections from the menu

We think this speaks to two things. First, a chef run kitchen. Second, a commitment to customer service. When other places may have the wait staff performing double duty as customer and kitchen liaisons, FFT had dedicated food runners. That’s not to say the wait staff was lackadaisical in their duties. They, along with every other staff member was constantly keeping the place clean. Allowing the servers to concentrate more on their customers permitted them to do one thing not seen in many other establishments. They stopped and paid attention, answering any questions.

[![Pizzas and 'build-your-own' burgers](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/014-full-tilt-tavern-1024x698.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/014-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

Pizzas and ‘build-your-own’ burgers

The fact that both the staff and fellow patrons always stop to give attention is the one thing most appreciated by the customers I interviewed. And, specifically, by one frequently returning customer.

This friendly and inviting atmosphere helps make the venue indefinable, but ever welcoming.

**DRINKS**

FTT also has a full-service bar. Their bottled beer selection alone was more varied than some total beer offerings from other restaurants.

[![One of the many bottled beers available](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/015-full-tilt-tavern-753x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/015-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

One of the many bottled beers available

Besides having a full-service bar. For alcoholic choices they offer: beer, seltzers, and wine.

Getting back to the bar, it also serves ever-changing monthly specials.

**SEATING**

During our first visit, due to families constantly arriving with their children in tow, we did not take up a table and, consequently therefore, got out first order of food as takeaway.

Seating at FTT is mostly tables and booths. Fun fact, FTT kept the built-in game boards from the previous owner. They also have other (portable) table games, which are free for customers to play.

[![Built-in table game and the shelf of other games which may be brought to your table](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/017-full-tilt-tavern-1024x517.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/017-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

Which, of course, brings us to the actual seating.

There is also seating around the large full-service bar.

**CARD MACHINES**

FTT chose the use of [Amusement Connect’s](https://amusementconnect.com/cashless-payment-card-system-hardware/) individually numbered RF-card system over cash/coins.

[![One of two Amusement Connect card machines spotted](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/020-full-tilt-tavern-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/020-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

One of two Amusement Connect card machines spotted

To see how the Amusement Connect card system operated, we used our credit card to purchase the “fiver” option, and then used those 20 card credits to play two games of pinball. For those of you not wanting to do the math, that’s $2.50 per game.

![$5 buys you 20 card credits](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/021-full-tilt-tavern-1024x641.jpg)

$5 buys you 20 card credits

When we got home, we checked our credit card statement and found no service charges or taxes had been added to our game card purchase.

[![No extra charges](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/052-full-tilt-tavern-1024x115.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/052-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

No extra charges

General game prices varied from free to six credits to play, with all arcade machines having a card readers. (More on current pinball prices later)

Amusement card purchases are like paper towel math. It’s complicated.

[![A placard of the old card purchase rates](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/022-full-tilt-tavern-812x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/022-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

A placard of the old card purchase rates

The actual purchase rates were a lower dollar-to-received-credit ratio. Price of received credits varied based on the package purchased. The larger the package the greater the number of free “bonus credits”.

**PINBALL**

Though it’s unclear which games belong to [Aspen Video and Vending](https://www.aspenvv.fun/) and which are owned by the location, the impressive line-up of newer and/or remade pinball machines included…

[Jurassic Park](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/07/27/jurassic-park-2/) with ‘Insider’ header

Pinball prices varied from 7.50 to 9.50 card credits per player credit. All plays were three ball games.

[![7.50 card credits needed for one gameplay on some, 9.5 card credits on others](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/045-full-tilt-tavern-1024x527.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/045-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

7.50 card credits needed for one gameplay on some, 9.5 card credits on others

From player experience, rather than from game audits, we concluded that the game rules were set on default route play. Novices kept replays at default levels. The first replay awarded a free three ball game, but also immediately increased the points needed for the next replay.

[![Earned credit from reaching the first replay score](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/046-full-tilt-tavern-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/046-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

Earned credit from reaching the first replay score

All pinball machines looked shinny and new. The staff did a great job keeping them clean. In general, the games played well, but not perfect. (More on that later.)

[![When you see it...](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/047-full-tilt-tavern-1024x789.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/047-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

When you see it…

During our first visit, we only played a few of the pinball machines. We thought their flippers played a little loose and weak. Though, this may be intentional to allow novice players to ‘catch’ the ball(s) in play a little more easily, and also to take it easier on the playfield items.

Two of the pinball machines were down during this first visit. (More on that later.)

[![A dead-pin... Deadpool](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/048-full-tilt-tavern-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/full-tilt-tavern/048-full-tilt-tavern.jpg)

All pinball machines were back up by our return two days later.

A line of operating games

Problems with any game, not just pinballs, may be reported to any of the staff. The arcade mechanic from St. PaulL Tap Sports Bar & Gaming Company also fixes the games at FTT.

One of the managers is on our side pinheads! Joey is a self-proclaimed avid pinball player who personally turned off the two previously mention downed games. Not because they were actually broken, but because he believed they did not play well enough. The first game had unsatisfactory responding flippers. The second would not go into one of its multiball modes.

On our purposeful return visit, we played (and judged) a few more and different pinball machines from our first visit. Not including the flipper issues, we previously discovered, we found at least one thing wrong with each of the machines.

First there was [SDTM](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/08/07/pinball-acronyms/?name-directory-search-value=SDTM&dir=2#name_directory_position2) syndrome on one game.

Next was possibly an incorrectly-adjusted kicker/slingshot switch, but more probably a switch matrix issue, causing one kicker to fire.

Lastly, we found either a warped playfield, or more probably an unlevel machine.

Despite the specific problems we just mentioned, we want to be clear that all the pinball machines were much cleaner and in much better condition than the majority of machines ‘in-the-wild’.  And, that most novice players would probably not notice these few little things just mentioned.

**SUMMARY**

On social media, [Full Tilt Tavern touted itself](https://www.fulltilttavern.com/about) as, “THE place to go for a good time in Minnesota. With interactive games, scratch-made food, craft cocktails, and rotating monthly specials, we’ve got everything you need in one place for the best vibes in town!”

Full Tilt Tavern? Simply concluded, a good times bar which also has various games, including pinball machines.
