Hexa Pinball have rebranded their *Space Hunt* title to create a promotional machine for the French car giant, Renault.

Hexa Pinball’s Twingo pinball

The *Twingo* machine was created to help promote the relaunch of Renault’s *Twingo* e-tech car as a low-cost fully electric city vehicle, with a claimed 163 miles range from its 28kWh battery.

Hexa Pinball is also a French company, of course, and the playfield hardware looks to be identical to their *Space Hunt* machine. The cabinet and playfield artwork is pure *Twingo* though, while the display and sound calls will be customised too.
