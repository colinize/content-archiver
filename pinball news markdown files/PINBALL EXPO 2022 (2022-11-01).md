**Date:** 19th-22nd October 2022
**Location:** Schaumburg Convention Center,
1551 Thoreau Dr N, Schaumburg, IL 60173

After two years of forced absence, we are back at [Pinball Expo](https://pinballexpo.com/) at its new home at the [Schaumburg Convention Center](https://www.schaumburgconventioncenter.com/).

[![The Schaumburg Convention Center](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/018-pinball-expo-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/018-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The Schaumburg Convention Center

The Convention Centre is attached to the more prominent [Renaissance hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/chirs-renaissance-schaumburg-convention-center-hotel/overview/), which has a discounted room rate for Expo attendees and is therefore where most guests will be staying.

The Renaissance Schaumburg hotel

This is our first time attending Pinball Expo in Schaumburg. The show moved there in 2021 after the virtual Pinball Expo of 2020, but regrettably many visitors from outside North America weren’t permitted to enter the US in time for the 2021 show.

So, it’s all new to us, and probably to you too.

The Renaissance is a high-grade business hotel, with several small lakes and fountains in the grounds.

[![The grounds of the Renaissance](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/017-pinball-expo-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/017-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The grounds of the Renaissance

There is plenty of free car parking but, unlike the previous home of the [Westin in Wheeling](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/chiow-the-westin-chicago-north-shore/overview/) (another Marriott property), there are no restaurants, bars or shops just a short walk away. In fact the nearest eatery is 0.8 miles from the front of the Renaissance, although they do offer a free shuttle bus to any location within a three-mile radius.

**WEDNESDAY**

Pinball Expo is held in two of the three main Convention Centre halls, with seminars and tournaments located in adjoining rooms. These halls, like all the rooms at the Convention Center, have rather silly names, such as ‘Utopia’, ‘Nirvana’, ‘Prosperity’ and ‘Perfection’.

We arrived at midday on Wednesday to check on progress setting up the show in ‘Adventure’ and ‘Discovery’ ahead of the public opening at midday on Thursday.

[![Some of the pinballs already set up in the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/001-pinball-expo-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/001-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The show’s new home allows vehicles to drive onto the floor of the Convention Center so that they can unload more easily (and load up again after the show closes on Sunday).

[![Some of the vehicles on the show floor](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/002-pinball-expo-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/002-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Stern Pinball had many of their pinballs set up, including multiple examples of the new *007 James Bond* Pro and Premium models.

We had the opportunity to play the Premium model on the floor. Compared to the version of software we experienced in London, so obvious extra graphics, sounds and music had been added, but there didn’t seem to be any new modes or features yet. The display still warns players that these are development machines where some of the assets may be incomplete or unlicensed.

Elsewhere at Pinball Expo, Pinball Brothers were unboxing their new *Queen* pinball, but wanted to set it up in private before showing it to a wider audience. They plan to have two machines when the show opens on Thursday, with another being added soon after.

[![The Pinball Brothers stand where Queen was being set up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/007-pinball-expo-2022-1024x540.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/007-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Jersey Jack Pinball were in the process of building their stand, with the emphasis on their current *Toy Story 4* model.

Rumours suggest Chicago Gaming might be revealing their first non-remake title at Pinball Expo, although they were vehemently denying it during set-up.

In a change from last year, the free play pinballs will sit alongside the vendor stands in the main hall. Around 400 free play games are expected, with some being set up during our visit.

As usual, Pinball Expo Organiser, Rob Berk, brought many of his own games.

As usual, we’ll be bringing you full details of all the vendors and free play machines at this year’s Pinball Expo as we update this report over the course of the weekend and beyond.

Of course, no major pinball show would be complete without a bunch of tournaments.

Trent Augenstein’s Tilt Amusements had supplied a hugely impressive line-up of the newest Stern Pinball titles for the show’s competitive events.

[![Inside the Tournaments Room during set-up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/013-pinball-expo-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/013-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Not all of Pinball Expo takes place at the Schaumburg Convention Center however. In fact, events kick-off on Wednesday night with the familiar Bumper Blast welcome part which is being held at the nearby Enterrium barcade. Several additional pinballs have been brought in to supplement the already-impressive collection.

The Bumper Blast runs from 7pm until 10pm, and Pinball News will be there to bring you all the details.

[![Free shuttle buses take Pinball Expo guests to Enterrium for the Bumper blast party](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/015-pinball-expo-2022-461x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/015-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Thursday’s Pinball Expo action also begins off-site, as the brand-new Jersey Jack Pinball factory tour takes guests on a coach ride to Elk Grove Village to see for themselves how the company builds their popular titles.

[![Flippy helps guide Pinball Expo guests](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/014-pinball-expo-2022-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/014-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

When guests return, the popular seminars schedule begins.

Pinball News plans to record every one of them across Thursday, Friday and Saturday. We hope to bring you videos of them on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw4dCrUlAgVLWIgCCenFjPg), with each day’s seminars published overnight. Summaries of every seminar will also be added to this report, with the corresponding video added as soon as possible. We also plan to bring you audio recordings of the seminars.

Wednesday night’s Bumper Blast event was held at the nearby Enterrium amusements entertainment centre. School buses took Expo guests the two miles to Enterrium’s entrance as part of the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg.

Guests were welcomed by the new Pinball Expo mascot, Flippy.

[![Flippy says, "Welcome"](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/021-pinball-expo-2022-615x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/021-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

On arrival, most guests joined a queue to get some free food from heated trays set up in an adjoining room.

[![The queue for the food](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/020-pinball-expo-2022-1024x537.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/020-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The queue for the food

As they were waiting in line, Expo guests were given special Enterrium play cards which allowed unlimited play for three hours, although there were some limits on how many times you could play the same game to prevent hogging.

The dining room

There were five pinballs set up in a dedicated area next to the dinner line.

[![The five pinballs - four Legends of Valhalla and a 007 James Bond](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/022-pinball-expo-2022-1024x479.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/022-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

There were many more pinballs, but they were reserved for the tournaments being held on the opposite side of the room.

The arcade and redemption machines in Enterrium could be played until the end of the Bumper Blast at 10pm. Enterrium was supposed to close then, but the tournament ran longer and many guests remained behind, with the last ones leaving around 1am.

[![Standings in the tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/025-pinball-expo-2022-1024x581.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/025-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

For those who left on time, the school buses returned and set off for the Expo hotel around 10:10pm.

On arrival, we began setting up our equipment in preparation for the next morning’s seminars which began at 10am.

**THURSDAY**

The first full day of Pinball Expo began on Thursday morning. In past times this would have meant the return of the school buses for a guided tour of the Stern Pinball factory. Thing were changed this year with the first ever Expo tour of the Jersey Jack Pinball factory.

Rather than everyone arriving leaving at once, tours were arranged in time slots throughout the morning, with those who registered in-person for the tour on Thursday morning being allocated the next available slot.

Because we were busy setting up the recording equipment for the seminars we were not able to go on the JJP factory tour. However, Pinball Magazine Editor, Jonathan Joosten, did manage to take the tour and took the pictures you see below.

In addition, Pinball News visited the Jersey Jack Pinball factory two days earlier, and we will be adding pictures from that tour to this report too.

[![The line to register for the Jersey Jack Pinball factory tour](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/401-pinball-expo-2022-1024x671.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/401-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The line to take the next Jersey Jack Pinball factory tour

Along with the change of tour, the transportation had received an upgrade.

[![A luxury coach replaced the previous school buses](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/402-pinball-expo-2022-1024x670.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/402-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Although the destination was also new, some visitors would have found the journey somewhat familiar since the JJP factory is on the next street over from the Stern Pinball factory.

[![The destination: the Jersey Jack Pinball factory in Elk Grove Village](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/403-pinball-expo-2022-1024x735.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/403-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

There was also a competition to guess the number of lines of code in one of the company’s recent titles. Guests could submit their guess on a Post-It note, with the closest to the real number winning a prize.

Although the tours were still taking place, the extensive schedule of seminar talks began at 10am on Thursday.

![The seminars were held upstairs in Nirvana Ballrooms A & B](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/540-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)

Pinball News was frantically working away back at the Convention Center so we could record all 25.7 hours of them for you to enjoy. You can play them all below or visit our YouTube channel for the [Pinball Expo playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsqJ4LfOEWVUaRmrZ0MV5ujCWT2FQMoN2) of 35 videos, including tours of the main show hall and also the autograph session held on Saturday.

Troy Smith

Troy is the Director of Sales and Marketing at Tilt Amusements, one of the most popular distributors for Stern Pinball’s titles. In his seminar he talked about the pros and cons of buying new or used games, as well as comparing the service, backup and prices when you buy a game from a distributor or from a private sale.

Tanner Walters

Tanner has created a number of mods to help owners of electromechanical and early solid-state pinball enjoy their machines. He showed how the add-on board he designed allows games to have attract-mode playfield lighting effects, and another which lets players set and record the current high score on games which don’t support that feature.

Bruce Westfall

Shay runs the Shay Arcade Group which sells reproduction backglasses and plastics, while Bruce is a supplier of reproductions to the company. Shay said the backglass reproduction market is dying as the number of customers for any new glasses is so few it can even be in the single digits.
Bruce described the scanning, re-artworking and screen printing process used to recreate the backglasses, explaining why certain vivid or fluorescent colours can’t be reproduced by digital printing.

Mike Benjamin

Mike is the General Manager of Enterrium, the large family entertainment centre which was the venue for Wednesday’s Bumper Blast party.

Mike said the key to a successful business is the food and beverage sales, as you won’t get rich on coin drop alone. He said his responsibility to players is to make sure he can provide great games which are well maintained, and to partner with local leagues to host regular events which build a community. He continued, you need to invest in a pinball-specific tech, since modern games are too complicated to be serviced and maintained by a general tech.

Wayne Tedder

Wayne described how he came up with the idea of attempting to break the existing Guinness World Record for marathon pinball playing and how he approached his distributor, Player One, to get them involved.

He showed pictures from the event which was live streamed with comments from viewers worldwide, which Wayne said helped keep him alert. Wayne said he’d have been happy to continue for longer than the 48 hours he achieved, but had to stop for a scheduled live interview for Canadian TV.

Jim Schelberg

Jim is Editor of the Pingame Journal and has spent the past eight years recording people saying the word ‘Pinball’ and turning it into a compilation video, which he premiered here. Because it is still a work in progress he requested it is not part of our video recording.

After this showing, he continued with selected clips from his extensive archive of clips of pinball references in popular media. Unfortunately, some of the content he showed is apparently copyrighted so you may not be able to view this part of his seminar either in some regions.

Paulo Studart

Taito Brazil was a major manufacturer of pinball machines, producing over thirty different titles. Paulo has [produced a video](https://youtu.be/o7NBZL84aDg) in Portuguese explaining their history, the different models and which are considered the best.

Most Taito Brazil pinballs are either modified copies or rethemes of existing game designs. Imports of electronic products were banned in Brazil from 1964-1985, forcing companies to make locally-produced versions.

Marcelo Blanco

Marcelo grew up in Argentina in a neighbourhood specialising in antiques, which is where he learned how to restore them. He said the most important thing when restoring antiques is to keep them as original as possible – something equally true when restoring pinball machines.

When he began restoring pinballs in the early ’90, he found most restorers concentrated on the mechanical and electrical aspects, but nobody was offering an artwork restoration service. He showed some of the challenging pinballs sent to him – games which initially appeared to be beyond saving.

Oscar Terol

Oscar is a pinball collector in Barcelona and he began his seminar with a video explaining the history of pinball manufacturing in Spain once the era of General Franco ended. Importing pinballs from the US was very expensive, so machines were built locally using whatever materials were available.

Many companies sprang up in Barcelona and Madrid. This led to a large variety of designs, some of which were copies of successful US machines but others were targeted more at the local market, using themes familiar to Spanish players. Oscar then showed some of the large collections found in the country.

Olaf spoke about the character animations he created for Willy Wonka, including the Oompa Loompas in the factory and in the match animation.

Along with motion design, Mark also created the cabinet artwork for the standard edition of JJP’s Guns ‘N Roses machine and he showed some of the early design ideas, some of which were dropped but others persisted to the final version.

Three of the design team from Stern Pinball’s Rush game talked about the initial ideas and development of the title.

Game Designer, John Borg, showed some of his original sketches for for playfield and the mechanisms going into the game, explaining how they functioned and how their design and placement changed as the overall design evolved.

Tim and Raymond detailed the assets contained in the game, including sixteen full-length Rush songs, and how they were all incorporated into the gameplay.

The team from Stern Pinball talked about the early concept discussions they had when creating the Insider Connected system, which tracks scores, achievements and multiple data points for players when they register for an account and scan their individual QR code on a game’s barcode reader.

They also discussed the leaderboard options for custom events, the multiple achievements they have created for every Spike-2 title and the addition features available to operators which now include diagnostics and fault reporting.

Filip Wolak

Kristopher talked about his introduction to pinball in LA in the mid-2000s and soon became obsessed, an obsession which continued when he moved to New York City and created the Pinball NYC website. The site contained league and location information, listing places to play and rating their machines. He also launched the NYC league and ran several pinball events in the city, while Filip created an app to manage and run the league.

After creating similar websites for other cities, he announced the new Silverball Cities association of connected team-based leagues, sharing resources, technology and marketing knowhow. Other cities are now being invited to become part of Silverball Cities.

Jake Danzig

This seminar heard from a group of homebrew pinball designers who are often considered one of the best sources of talent when pinball companies are looking for new design staff.

Ed Owens created the *Ghost in the Shell* and *Greyhounds: The Race Home*, both of which were on the Pinball Expo show floor. Jake Danzig built the *The Dukes of Hazzard* game which won the prize for best homebrew at Expo. Tanner Petch has created several custom games, while Rolando Martin built a *Black Knight* game from scratch. Ryan McQuaid built the *Sonic The Hedgehog: Spinball* game and was recently hired by American Pinball.

Each panel member talked about their experiences building their games, the skillset needed, the inspiration for their designs, the technology available and how the homebrew community moves ahead from here.

On Saturday, running alongside the seminars – both physically and temporally – two autograph sessions took place in the room next door.

The first was a general one for all pinball personalities, while the second was exclusively for Stern Pinball people.

Show guests brought translites, backglasses, flyers and other pinball memorabilia for those at the tables to sign. Let’s take a look around the room.

**MAIN HALL**

As we saw during set-up, Pinball Expo’s vendors and free play machines, which used to be in separate room when the show was held at the previous venue, have been combined into the one main hall.

[![The entrance to the main Pinball Expo hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/129-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/129-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The entrance to the main Pinball Expo hall

While that makes it easier to experience everything Expo has to offer, it does mean an end to the all-night play which was a feature of the show for many years.

[![The main hall is open for 42 hours over the three days](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/201-pinball-expo-2022-733x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/201-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The flyer table outside the main entrance

Just inside the entrance is the registration desk where pre-registered attendees could collect their show pack with their name badge and wristband(s), as well as any T-shirt, sweatshirt, Flippy toy or tote bag purchases.

[![The show registration desk](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/202-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/202-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The show registration desk

Opposite the registration desk were computers where visitors could make their entry registrations and purchases.

[![Show registration computers](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/203-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/203-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Show registration computers

In contrast to the low-ceiling and plush carpet of the Ravinia Ballroom at the Westin North Shore where Expo was held until 2019, the Discovery Hall and Adventure Hall at the Convention Center have high ceilings and a concrete floor.

The Convention Center hall is much large too, of course. The two halls used for Pinball Expo provide 65,000 sq. ft. of floor space compared to the 15,000 sq. ft. of the Ravinia Ballroom plus the 5,000 sq. ft. of the Lake Michigan Ballroom which was used for the free play area.

[![The show hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/204-pinball-expo-2022-1024x644.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/204-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

The show hall

So, the new accommodation is much roomier with everything together in one hall, but is more wearing on the feet. There is actually the potential for the show to expand further if required into the adjacent Adventure Hall which is another 32,000 sq. ft., although a home & garden show occupied this on Saturday and Sunday this year.

With refreshment options in the surrounding area rather limited, there was a concessions booth at the back of the hall for some rapid refreshment during the set-up of the show without having to leave the building.

[![The concessions stand in the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/271-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/271-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Prices at the concessions stand

Having the larger single room meant the free play machines were mixed in with the many vendor stands. Some of the free play machines were set up in back-to-back rows, while others were arranged in islands of three or four.

The good news was that there were so many machines it was always possible to find plenty to play.

**FREE PLAY GAMES**

Let’s take a look at some of the free play machines available and you can see how available many of them were. These pictures were taken across the weekend.

**VENDOR STANDS**

As we said above, most of the very newest titles were on the stands of the manufacturers or distributors. But there is far more than just machines to buy, with hundreds and hundreds of ways to enhance games and tons of collectables to pick up.

We start with some sad news though, with the death straight after Expo of Chance Tees who ran Pinball Wizard Sales & Board Repair business. He always had an impressive stand packed full of reconditioned boards and all the tools you’d need to perform your own repairs, together with standard game spare parts. This year was no different, and he will be sadly missed.

Although it had been [officially announced](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/07/21/queen-revealed/) some weeks earlier, Pinball Expo was the first public appearance for Pinball Brothers’ new *Queen* game. They had two machines on their stand for visitors to play.

The largest stand belonged to Stern Pinball, who were promoting all their recent titles with an accent of their newest – *007 James Bond*. Although we [had played](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/09/27/james-bond-60th-anniversary-event/) and [reported on *007*](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/10/01/more-james-bond-pictures/) quite a lot in recent weeks, Pinball Expo – starting with Wednesday’s Bumper Blast – was the first time the game had been publicly playable in the US.

The game with the longest line to play it wasn’t a new title, nor was it from a game manufacturer. Instead, it was the *Magic Girl* machine from the Dutch team who completed the hardware and software to make it a playable game.

We [got our hands on it back in May](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/08/25/finishing-magic-girl/) and reported on the history of Magic Girl together with all the work put in by the team turn it into something which could actually be played, but this was the first time it had been at a show.

Although the name of the show is ‘Pinball’, this year there was a push to expand into other areas of gaming, including video games and retro gaming.

[![The Galloping Ghost arcade brought a selection of arcade video games](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/299-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/299-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

You’ve seen the pictures, now here’s our exclusive Twenty-Eight Minute Tour video of the main Pinball Expo show hall.

**SUNDAY**

The show hall opened at 10am on Thursday and closed at 2am on Sunday morning. Although some vendors packed up on Saturday evening, the official load-out day was Sunday. There was no doubt that the ability to drive vehicles into the show hall made clearance of the hall a much faster process.

[![Time to clear out the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/541-pinball-expo-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/541-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

[![That's a serious pin-hauler](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/542-pinball-expo-2022-1024x636.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/542-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

That’s a serious pin-hauler

While we were busy working on the seminars, there were multiple tournaments taking place in the unusually sensibly-named Schaumburg E room.

[![Schaumburg E - home of the Pinball Expo tournaments](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/319-pinball-expo-2022-1024x671.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2022/319-pinball-expo-2022.jpg)

Schaumburg E – home of the Pinball Expo tournaments

This room was dedicated to the tournaments which is a good thing is some ways, as it gives the tournament organisers free-rein to use the space as they wish compared to the corridor they had to use in the Westin hotel.

The flip-side is that unless you are especially interested in the tournaments, you probably wouldn’t even know they are taking place. Hiding them away in a room which usually has the doors closed does little to expose visitors to the main show hall to all the excitement of competitive pinball.

Tilt Amusements provided the new Stern machines used for most of the tournaments, and it made for an impressive line-up.

The main Flip Out tournament used the familiar system of qualified seeding, where everyone who enters starts in the play-offs, but the better you do in the seeding round the more byes you earn through the initial play-off rounds.

All the play-off matches were displayed on a long wall chart.

The Classics Tournament, meanwhile, was a simpler affair with players choosing six of the eight machines on which to put up a qualifying entry. The play-offs were simpler too, with a straight double-elimination chart showing progress.

Play-off matches in the Classics tournament

The Flip Out tournament was live-streamed by Fox Cities Pinball and you can watch the play-off rounds on [their Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/foxcitiespinball). There was also a small audience watching the stream in the tournaments room.

Watching the live stream of the Flip Out tournament

The Flip Out tournament was divided into A and B divisions. The B division wrapped up on Saturday night with a win for Bob Johnson.

The A division’s play-offs continued at 9am on Sunday and came down to a final between 3rd-placed qualifier Zach McCarthy and 13th-placed Jared August.

Zach had remained unbeaten in the winners’ bracket, while Jared had lost to top-qualifier Karl DeAngelo in the quarter-finals but had won through the losers’ bracket to make the final. That meant Jared would need to beat Zach twice in the best-of-three final in order to win, whereas Zach only had to win one best-of-three.

With a plane to catch, the machines for the final were made harder with the disabling of all ball savers and the removal of the outlane post rubbers, plus the match was cut from the best-of-five to the best-of-three.

That lack of an outlane rubber resulted in a quick drain for Jared on his first ball.

A 185M super jackpot wrapped the game up for Zach, to lead 1-0 going into game two on *The Avengers: Infinity Quest*.

A great second ball set Zach up with a 325M vs 3M lead going into ball three. While Jared cashed in some of the features he had set up, he only got to 51M before his ball drained. That gave Zach a 2-0 win in the final.

Zach won a new-in-box Stern machine as his first prize. Jared was second, Karl DeAngelo was third and Dalton Ely was fourth.

The Classics final four with tournament organisers Deborah Tahlman and Jen Ruper

And with the final of the Classics tournament we end our coverage of Pinball Expo 2022.

We weren’t able to attend last year’s show, but from the many conversations we had there was no doubt this years Expo was a marked improvement on the 2021 event.

The merger of the free play and vendor halls was seen as a major success, as was the Jersey Jack Pinball factory tour, although being able to choose your time slot for the tour in advance was widely suggested as a possible improvement to help attendees better plan their day.

The seminar schedule was extensive and covered a wide range of topics, bringing in a small element of video games to match the expansion of the show hall to include video and retro gaming.

Given the resurgence of Covid, there was still an element of reticence on the part of some previous attendees to return to a large-scale public event like Expo. As a result we missed seeing some familiar faces – either because they were absent or because they were hidden behind masks.

Hopefully 2023 will bring a greater degree of confidence and willingness to attend, but in the meantime those who *were* there had no problems finding games to play in the show hall and the aisles were never crowded or obstructed.

The hotel accommodation was of a good standard, as were most of the facilities at the hotel and Convention Center, but there’s no denying everyone missed having food and drink outlets just outside the hotel’s front door as we had in Wheeling. When we packed up our recording equipment from the seminars at the end of each day – having been in the room for sixteen hours – and went to join friends in the bar, it was disappointing to find it had already closed.

Holding the Bumper Blast welcome party at Enterrium was also a success. It’s an attractive venue with plenty of games to enjoy as we found when we visited the previous night, but a few improvements are still possible, of course.

Taking nearly all the pinballs away for use in a tournament in which only a minority participated seemed rather excessive, as was having the return buses sitting there full of people but waiting until everyone was accounted for until any of them departed. Once a bus was full, it should have gone. Many people gave up waiting and called an Uber instead, which further confused matters.

Really, though, those are just minor issues. Pinball Expo hosts a large number of events – too many for us to cover fully – and the organisers are still trying new ideas to improve the experience for show guests.

We very much enjoyed our time in Schaumburg and look forward to returning next October for 2023’s show.

We hope you enjoyed our coverage. If you have any thoughts about the show we’d love to hear them. Please leave your comments below.
