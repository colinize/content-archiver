Stern Pinball has announced that the company will be re-running their Iron Man title from 2010 in what could be the first of a number   of classic title remakes.

The re-run will be called Iron Man Pro Vault Edition, introducing the Pro naming, even though Iron Man was originally produced before the Pro and LE variants were introduced. This also leaves the door open for a possible Limited Edition version in the future.

Stern says the Vault Edition will feature a number of changes, including full LED lighting, the use of Stern's new style of backbox and speaker panel, and one-piece models of the Iron Monger, Whiplash and War Machine characters. The cabinet will also use decals for the side and backbox artwork rather than the original's screen printing.

Remakes of classic titles have become increasingly popular of late, with Planetary Pinball Supply starting the most recent round with their Medieval Madness remakes. That title - to be manufactured by Stern for Chicago Gaming - is expected to be the first of a series of popular titles, while the recent announcement of PPS's Matt Christiano purchasing Illinois Pinball has led to speculation that remakes of Big Bang Bar or Kingpin could follow.

Stern have recently rebooted their second production line at their Melrose Park factory. This has been used in the past to make consumer versions of their full-size titles, as well as redemption and video games, and it is thought it will be used to make the Medieval Madness games. It would also be suitable for making short-run Vault Editions without impacting on production of their latest new title.

Stern's suggested price for Iron Man Pro Vault Edition is $5,495. Here's how they announced the remake.
