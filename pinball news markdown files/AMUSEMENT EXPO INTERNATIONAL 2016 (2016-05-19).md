**We return to the Las Vegas Convention Center for the first time since 2013 to visit the annual spring coin-op trade show now known as Amusement Expo International.**

The Las Vegas Convention Center

The show was held in hall N1, which meant there wasn’t too far to walk from the main entrance.

The entrance to the show

The show opened to registered visitors on Wednesday 16th March and lasted for two days. Inside the hall, the familiar mix of coin-op and amusement trade vendors were exhibiting their latest products.

Looking down the main aisle

Visitor numbers were encouraging, with the aisles busy throughout the first day.

Our main interest lay in seeing what the two pinball manufacturers exhibiting at the show had brought along. Stern Pinball is first, and they had a display of seven machines.

The greatest interest was generated by their latest title, Ghostbusters, of which they had two.

Ghostbusters Pro

To see how the game plays, we shot a video of top player Keith Elwin playing one of his first games on Ghostbusters.

Alongside the bank of four pinballs was another bank containing three more Pro models; The Walking Dead, WWE Wrestlemania and Kiss.

Further back in the hall, Heighway Pinball has two Full Throttle machines, both sporting the 27″ LCD displays in their backboxes.

On the stand was Andrew Heighway and new investors in the company, Cato Paus Skrede and Roger Svanevik from Norway who are both operators and collectors.

These were the only pinball manufacturers represented, but they weren’t the only pinball companies, since Flip N Out Pinball were also there representing Escalera who make the powered stair-climbing lifting machines.

In general, the themes of the show were ‘big screens’ and retro themes.

The success of games such as Fish Bowl Frenzy has led many companies to put huge LCD screens in their games, and for existing games to super-size their displays.

Big Buck Hunter’s latest variant – Big Buck Hunter HD Wild – now has a larger screen and has zombified the targets.

If the graphicised version of killing animals lacks sufficient realism, you can now shoot real arrows into life-like images of the poor critters.

Big screens combine with retro themes as Galaga becomes the latest classic game to be updated.

Golden Tee golf games have been around so long, they could almost be considered retro now. But they were back, and brought the Golden Tee World Championship to the Amusement Expo show.

Although it wasn’t officially derived from the classic game, Grand Piano Keys appeared to have a striking similarity to the game Simon.

Elsewhere, large screens could be found in both vertical and horizontal orientations.

The remainder of the show was the usual mix of pushers, cranes, racers, and all the ancillary equipment for coin-op games such as locks, payment systems and coin-op publications.
