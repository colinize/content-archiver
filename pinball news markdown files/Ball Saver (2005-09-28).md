Nobody could be unaware of the devastation left by hurricane Katrina on
the American states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, but the
relief effort is being helped thanks to the work of some pinball fans.

The Free State Pinball Association (FSPA) and the Volleyball House
held a joint fundraising pinball and volleyball event on Saturday
September 24th in Elkridge, MD - 15 minutes from downtown Baltimore.
Just over $1900 was raised for the Salvation Army Hurricane Relief
fund from the entrance fee, tournament entries, pinball raffle,

auction and coin drop.

Twenty five machines were there, brought both by local operators and
FSPA league members, including: NASCAR, Ripley's Believe it or Not,
Black Knight 2000, Doctor Who,Spectrum, Special Force, Eight Ball
Deluxe, Sopranos, Maverick, Meteor, Simpsons Pinball Party, Road Show,
Monster Bash, Asteroid Annie and the Aliens, Seawitch, High Speed, No
Good Gofers, Baywatch, The Shadow, Demolition Man, World Cup Soccer,
Road Show, Theatre of Magic and Monopoly.

The pinball tournament side of the event featured two divisions, with
four machines reserved for tournament play in each division. The
tournament was run using a modified PAPA format for qualifying, with
four players qualifying for head-to-head elimination play in the
finals. Chris Newsom won the A-division tournament, taking home a
new NASCAR playfield (courtesy of Stern Pinball) for his efforts,
while Rudy Keiser won the B-division.

Besides the tournament and open play, there was also a pinball raffle,
featuring a variety of donated items, including a selection of NOS
Translites from Stern, and a silent auction for the coveted first
player number for next year's PAPA. Scott Sidley won PAPA Player
#101, which was donated by Kevin Martin.

With the great lineup of both rare and recent machines, the pinball
tournament and plenty of volleyball play, a great time was had by all,
while raising money to help out the relief effort for those who truly
need it.
