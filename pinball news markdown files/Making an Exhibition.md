Getting non-pinball people to appreciate the game's unique appeal is often not the easiest of tasks.  But spreading the word about everything pinball has to offer - be it the history, the art, the technology or the pop culture elements - is something close to the hearts of the Pacific Pinball Museum.

Now they're making it easier to educate the populace with an offer to create bespoke exhibitions featuring games from their extensive collection of rare and historic machines.

One such exhibition is Pinball Oddities which is currently appearing at the Rhythmix Cultural Works in nearby Alameda, California.

Pinball Oddities opened on June 8th and features six rare or notable games from pinball's early years, along with four of the Museum's famed backglass murals and other assorted artwork and informational panels.

One of the rarest games is the flipperless Genco Cargo from 1937, which could be the only surviving example in the world.

Next to that is Sky Rocket by Exhibit Supply Co. which celebrated the 1939 World's Fair held in San Francisco, a Paratrooper by Williams which was released during the Korean War, a Chicago Coin Thing with it's unusually narrative cartoon backglass,   a Genco Rip Snorter and a Williams' Teacher's Pet.  These last two are part of a small group of machines which depict children as major backglass elements.

Hanging on the walls around the exhibit are  four painted murals recreating classic backglass artworks.  These come from the Pacific Pinball Museum's collection of murals from artists such as d'Arci Bruno, Ed Cassel, Eric J. Kos and Dan Fontes.

Exhibitions such as this are now being offered by the Pacific Pinball Museums to other museums and institutions interested in hosting them.  While Pinball Oddities is one such theme, several others are available, such as Machines from the 1930s, Art Movements in Pinball, and Science Fiction and Fantasy.

All of these exhibitions can be tailored to fit the required size, and whether or not the machines would be playable by visitors.

Any museums or institutions interested in hosting one of the Pacific Pinball Museum's pinball exhibitions should contact Melissa Harmon at the PPM for more details. Pinball Oddities runs at the Rhythmix Cultural Works until July 20th, 2012.
