Wonderland Amusements today launched [their Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderlandamusements/wonderland-pinball) for their *Alice Goes To Wonderland* pinball machine.

The [Wonderland Amusements team](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wonderlandamusements/wonderland-pinball) is headed up by CEO and Creative Director, Jerry Cummings, who comes to pinball from his ThinkUp company which designed the cabinets for the hugely popular Arcade1Up range of video games.

Other team members have also been involved with Arcade1Up, as well as with New Wave Toys who recently launched their new [*Replicade* range of miniature interactive pinball models](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/01/16/new-miniature-pinballs/) to join their existing range or miniature arcade video games.

As with Arcade1Up, the intention for Wonderland Amusements is to produce a game for home use at a cost far below the current price of arcade-ready models.

The company stated their desire to keep the retail price at $1,000 or below – a level which would certainly involve a number of compromises to gameplay features. To help them achieve this price point, manufacturing of the company’s products is to be done in China while the overall game would be built to be 80% of the scale of a conventional arcade pinball. That scaling down applies to all areas of the game, including the ball which is reduced from 27mm (1 1/16th-inch) diameter to 22mm.

Wonderland Amusements first revealed their intentions at [Pinball Expo 2024](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/10/15/pinball-expo-2024-2/) where they had a stand showing their proposed cabinet design and a hint or two at the theme of their first release.

The company name took a lead from their intended Alice in Wonderland-themed first game. With Dutch Pinball Exclusive already announcing their *[Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/10/07/alices-adventures-in-wonderland-revealed/)* run of 500 full-size, high-end collector games, Wonderland Amusements chose the title *Alice Goes To Wonderland* for theirs.

Over a series of monthly updates on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@WonderlandAmusements), the company revealed the final design for their *Alice Goes To Wonderland* game.

Artwork is by Carlos Mendoza III who has enjoyed a long career in the toy and collectibles industry. Sound for the game comes from Richard Sellers and Wes McCraw from Cleveland, Ohio who have worked as a team on numerous toys and audiobooks, as well as radio and TV productions.

Wonderland Amusement’s Alice Goes To Wonderland game

Today’s launch on Kickstarter helps the company gauge the level of interest and get some pre-production publicity, while also raising funds for their initial production run. They have set the funding goal at $100,000.

To mark the start of the month-long Kickstarter campaign, there are some early-adopter discounts available.

The full MSRP price of *Alice Goes To Wonderland* is $999, but an initial batch of 200 *White Rabbit Early Bird Special* machines has been made available with a $200 (20%) discount at $799.

Once those are gone, an unlimited number of *Mad Hatter’s Choice* games prices at $849 – a 15% saving -will be available only through Kickstarter for the duration of the campaign.

The 20% discount is also available if two *Alice Goes To Wonderland* machines are purchased through Kickstarter at the same time, at a price of $1,598.

In addition, there are a limited number of *Queen of Hearts Collection* machines prices at $1,899 each. These include an illuminated backbox topper, antique bronze metalwork, enhanced 3D sculpts on the playfield, an upgraded shooter knob and housing, a cover, a numbered plaque and signed certificate, as well as all the reward tier bonus items such as playing cards and cushion.

Most of these add-ons, such as the shooter knob, 3D sculpts, topper and cover are also available to purchase separately.

Mass production is slated to start in June 2025 with the machines completed in Q3.

The estimated final shipping date for all these machines to buyers is stated in the campaign as November 2025. Kickstarter-purchased machines also come with a one year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects in the physical game and electronics, with replacement parts planned to be available through the company’s website.

The game is expected to initially only be available to buyers in North America, but overseas orders may be accepted by Wonderland Amusements at a later date either directly or through distributors. Of course, games could be purchased through the US and then exported, although it is possible some voltage modifications might be required in these cases.

As with all Kickstarter campaigns, if the target funding ($100,000 in this instance) is not achieved, no payments are taken, and the project doesn’t proceed.

**UPDATE**

The Kickstarter achieved its funding target almost immediately after launch with only a few Early Bird Special models remaining after just five minutes.

[![The target was reached very soon after the project launched](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/alice-goes-to-wonderland/007-alice-goes-to-wonderland-1024x495.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/alice-goes-to-wonderland/007-alice-goes-to-wonderland.jpg)
