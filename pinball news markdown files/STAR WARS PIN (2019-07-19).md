Stern Pinball have been pretty successful selling to the home collector market, but despite several attempts they haven’t matched that success selling games through regular retail channels to non-collectors.

Previous titles such as Transformers, Batman and Spider-Man
were pitched at family buyers with no experience of purchasing through
distributors who wanted a simple and easy process to get a full-size authentic
pinball in their home.

Now Stern are having another attempt to crack the home market with a Star Wars game which was unveiled on the Star Wars stand at the San Diego Comic-Con exhibition.

Stern Pinball’s new Star Wars Pin home game

Called the *Star Wars Pin*, the game uses a modified playfield layout from Stern’s earlier Spider-Man Pin title, with a new playfield art package and some Star Wars toys added in the form of a Death Star and an animated TIE-Fighter.  The cabinet art package and backbox art uses elements from the Pro and the Premium arcade models.

To reduce cost and make the game more accessible, there have been several changes compared to the arcade versions.

The cabinet is a lighter build, held together with bolts which are visible on the exterior. There is also no coin slot, although there is still a coin door for accessing the game’s interior.

The lock bar is now a plastic affair, with the game’s start button moved up to make it more obvious how to start a game and add players. There is still a shooter rod, but the metal housing has been down-sized.

The backbox display has also been significantly reduced in size, although it is now an LCD which is the first time this type of display has been used in a Stern home game.

Although there are two speaker grilles on the display panel, it looks as though there is only a single speaker fitted which looks a little odd.

Moving on to the playfield, the game features two all-metal ramps, three drop targets, three pop bumpers, and a spinner along with the Death Star and TIE Fighter toys.

Shots to the Death Star are initially blocked by the three-bank of drop targets, but once those are down the left ramp can be made to shoot past the one-way gate to the standup target inside the Death Star and a then back to the flippers on the left wireform.

*Star Wars Pin* utilises the same two-post lock mechanism used in the Spider-Man Home game, allowing multiball to be started at any point in the game.

The game features at least four multiball modes – Death Star, Tie-Fighter and R2-D2 being regular modes, with Jedi Multiball being the wizard mode.

The rules read:

* Spell F-O-R-C-E to light Rebel shots.
* Make Rebel shots when lit to assemble the Rebels.
* Collecting any two Rebels lights Extra Ball.
* Assembling all of the Rebels prior to attacking
  the Death Star increases Death Star score value.
* Right ramp destroys TIE fighters and starts TIE
  Fighter Multiball.
* Complete Rebel Alliance symbols to increase
  bonus multiplier.
* Lite Empire top lanes for time Double Scoring
  mode.
* Pop bumpers build TIE Fighter Multiball jack pot
  values.
* Knock down the TIE Fighter drop targets to start
  Death Star Multiball and attack the Death Star.
* Freeing a captive ball starts R2-D2 Multiball.  Hitting the R2 target adds a ball.
* Complete all features to start Jedi Multiball.

One of the key problems Stern have had so far with the ‘*Pin*’ series is finding the right price point -one which might typically be considered ‘discretionary spending’ for a family’s home game room.  Earlier models have often been thought expensive for a cut-down arcade experience, but that hasn’t deterred Stern from setting a retail price of $4,499 – something not too far, far away from the street price of the Pro arcade model.

Interestingly, although this is marketed as a home game, it is still being sold through Stern’s traditional distributor network. Previous titles had been aimed at big-box stores such as Costco, but there is no mention of any conventional retail outlets stocking the *Star Wars Pin*.

Here’s how Stern announced their new *Pin* title. There’s also a short video of some gameplay here: <https://www.facebook.com/sternpinball/videos/405399176745750/>
