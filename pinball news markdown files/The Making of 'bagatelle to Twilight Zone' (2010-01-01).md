Report by: Michael Schiess, Pacific Pinball   Museum

Date: January 2010

Tim O’ Brien of the San Francisco Airport   Museum contacted me in  2008 about doing a show on Neptune   Beach, the 1920 to '30s “Coney Island of the West” in Alameda. Although we were still officially  the Neptune Beach Amusement   Museum, I told Tim there  wasn’t much to be had about Neptune Beach and that we had reformed into the Pacific Pinball Museum.

When I asked “How about doing a pinball exhibition?” he replied that because of  the height of the exhibit cases it would be hard to display something that far  up on it’s legs. I suggested cutting the legs shorter so you could see  everything and an exhibition was born. He called me after discussing this with  the directors and thus started a year long project to produce the best exhibition  on the historical/artistic evolution of pinball that has ever been done.

After a lot of questions to me and a visit to the PPM and Richard  Conger’s Silver Ball Ranch, Tim caught the bug. Like any good curator, he did  his research and asked a lot of questions. Richard Conger, Larry Zartarian, Dan  Miller, Helmut Jordt, Gordon Hasse myself and others offered answers and  suggestions to narrow down the choice of machines and artifacts. He also came  down to the Ju Ju on a Saturday night and played a mean pinball.

After many  round robin e-mails a list of games was made. This was modified for availability  and after a lengthy process a final list was made.

At this point, the registrar  steps in. They take possession of each object and forms are filled out stating  the condition, pictures are taken and the object is cleaned, tagged and  documented. Papers are signed and this continued until the end of the Pacific  Pinball Exposition, 2009 where the lion's share of pinballs were taken from the  PPE directly to a facility in South    San Francisco for processing.

This is where pinball  show and museum exhibition split away from each other. The pinball show is all  about playing the games to have fun. The San Francisco Airport   Museum is centered on education. Their  process relies on thorough documentation, research, accuracy and engaging  aesthetics for displaying objects. It is professionally presented and logically  arranged and documented so the average person gets a good perspective on the  subject so the end result is that you feel you are getting the straight dope.

A pop bumper exhibit

To  make this all happen takes a team of dedicated museum preparators, curators,  designers, graphic artists, fabricators and installers. The main people  involved from SFAM were Assistant Director Abe Garfield and Curator Kelvin  Godshall who designed the exhibition. Principal Preparator Roman Korloev led  the installation, which included preparators Robert Harris and Jason Rogowski.

When the decision was made to have some backboxes next to complete machines lit  up, they called upon me, Jem Gruber and Helmut Jordt to make it happen. As some  of the objects were pre-war, we made sure all the bulbs were swapped out for  lower wattage and had lights cycled on and off every 2 hours to avoid  overheating. To run the heads by themselves, I made 6 transformer boards to  supply 6 volts AC. We used jumper wires to light an interesting pattern and the  general illumination lamps, and with the complete machines, we wired the hold switches on  permanently.

The SFAM went to a lot of trouble to make special stands for each  object complete with “legs” that actually secure them. The background wall was  done with the spatter pattern found on many older machines, the design based on  the cabinet graphics for “Humpty Dumpty”.

Drop targets and the change to solid-state machines

Every machine and object is labeled  and credit given to the lender. The stands are brought in one at a time, bolted  in place, and then machines are brought in and secured to the base through the  leg holes.

Installing the machines

It took 5 days to install all the objects and wire everything up.  One problem arose when the machines would not light up as they were supposed  to. It turned out; the added angle of the stand was causing the tilt pendulum  to be on so we went into each machine and insulated the ring and bob.

After all  that, the graphics and small object stands were installed. Fortunately I was  not needed for that as I had already spent a few weeks at the airport and there  were machines at our museum needing attention. The amazing thing is we were  able to assist with all of this while at the same time, opening the new wing of  the Pacific Pinball Museum  and running it 6 days a week.

It was a bit of a burn but when I went back  to see the full display, it was so worth it!

Wedgeheads and electro-mechanical machines

The total number of machines displayed is 36, starting with an 1898  Redgrave Bagatelle and ending of course, with the Twilight Zone as expected.

The earliest pinballs...

...and the accompanying historical information...

...through to the most modern in the exhibition

The exhibition is arranged chronologically with an emphasis on demonstrating  the different art styles chosen by the various artists creating the graphics  for the machines.

Information about Art Stenholm

From Roy Parker and George Molentin to Christian Marche and  Dave Christensen, many styles are represented and the eye candy is too much to  resist for the travelers.

Information about Jerry Kelley

I’m sure many people missed their flights when we had  the pins out for play in early January. In fact, as it turns out, there are  people who made the trek either to look specifically at the exhibition or to  play free pinball that we provided from January 4th to the 14th.

Unloading pins at SFO

The free pinball was an excellent opportunity for us to hand out museum information and  get people playing pinball again. We had a nice array of 8 Electro-Mechanical  games: Gottlieb’s 1951 “Flying High”, ’59 “Universe”, ’66 “Hurdy Gurdy”, ’69  “Mini Pool”, and a’73 “High Hand”. Not to be Gottlieb-centric, a 1976 Bally  Capt. Fantastic and Williams ’67 “Apollo” and ’73 “Gulfstream” were present.

Setting up the machines in the airport terminal

All these were set up around the column between the 2 display cases in the  non-secured zone of the International Terminal.

The machines being enjoyed

The response has been  incredible! Many people were drawn by the sound of the bells and chimes, one  that many admittedly had not heard for some time and were “unmistakable”.

Fun for all ages

PPM Board members visit the pinball exhibit at the airport

As I sat there one day watching the throngs  of travelers from all over discover our treasure chest of fun I realized that  this was the last bit of America  that they were leaving with. They got a taste of a real American icon; it was  free, entertaining and cool. I felt like a good will ambassador making sure  everyone left our country with a good memory of what America is and was. They sure  looked happy!

The latest news is - after just getting off the phone with Tim - they will  be discussing a repeat of the pins for free-play at the airport in March. I am  hoping we can do it once more so keep watching Pinball News for an announcement.

If you happen to be traveling to San    Francisco in March, you will be in for a treat!
