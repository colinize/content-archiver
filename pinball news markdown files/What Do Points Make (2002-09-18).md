Story dated 18th September
2002, new pictures 26th September 2002.

As
we reported back in April, Stern Pinball Inc have been working on
a single-site tournament system and now it is about to be rolled out.

Yes,
it's called ToPS (note the capitalisation) and it works as we described
before. It's not a networked system and it works on a single machine.
Prizes and the levels they are awarded are set by the site operator
through new entries in the Portal menu system.

ToPS
can be fitted to Playboy and RollerCoaster Tycoon games (and later)
by the addition of a game-top multicolour LED display, a controller
board and a tournament start button on the lockdown bar (those blanking
plugs on Playboy finally come into their own).

This
isn't Stern's first attempt at a tournament system. The company (or
Sega as it was at the time) tried the idea with Kelly Packard's Golden
Cue but that was using Incredible Technologies' network of interconnected
game and the licensing costs were prohibitive leading to the abandonment
of the idea.

Now
it looks as if the need to have a phone line connection has been done
away with and it's single game tournaments through ToPS.

So
what can we expect to win?

That
depends entirely on the game operator. You could win prizes, tickets
or cash - either fixed value or incremental - but that's all set in
the game menus. What is not yet clear is exactly how the prizes are
awarded. Games don't currently have any way to pay out prizes and
the installation kit doesn't provide one, so is ToPS only suitable
for managed sites?

Whatever,
the deciding factor for the success of tournament play has to be the
cost of the ToPS system. As yet no firm pricing information is available
(reports put it around $500) but the software is already included
in the game, so the major costs are the display and the controller
board. The system has to bring in enough additional earnings to pay
for itself (like all amusement devices in commercial use) . To achieve
that, the operator may have to experiment with different reward systems
and the prizes have to be sufficient to encourage players to opt for
the tournament game rather than regular play.

It's
way to early to know whether ToPS will be a success but credit is
due to Stern and the system's designers (Messrs. Blackwell, Ropp and
Sullivan) for their work and let's hope that the system helps revive
pinball in the eyes of arcade owners and that the extra price doesn't
prove to be prohibitive.

Anyway,
here's Stern's official press release:

Stern
Pinball is excited to announce the release of its Tournament Pinball
System (ToPS™). ToPS™ is a flexible, operator adjustable
tournament system. Running a tournament with ToPS™ is easy;
the pinball machine's computer does all the work and computations
for the operator and location. Tournament pinball games earn more
money.

Stern's
Tournament Pinball System is an in-house tournament system.
ToPS™ uses no phone lines, no servers, and gives full location
privacy. Stern developed the ToPS™ system with these things
in mind after consulting with many operators and location owners
throughout the United States.

During its
development, ToPS™ equipped games significantly increased
in earnings, both from tournament play and practice play. Testing
and development of ToPS™ has been shepherded at Stern over
the last year by Lonnie Ropp, Director of Software, Joe Blackwell,
Tech Service Director, and Dwight Sullivan, game software designer.

Locations
recognized the increased earnings and value to customers of
ToPS™ equipped games. "When we moved an older experimental
tournament model to replace it with a non-tournament Monopoly™,
the bar and its customers insisted on having its tournament
game back," Joe Blackwell explained of the tests. "When
we moved a tournament game from a bowling alley where it tested
great to a nearby bar, some bowling customers started going
to the bar."

There are
three types of tournament modes. The first is Progressive Cash
Prizes, where the payout grows with each play. The second is
Fixed Cash Prizes, where the total payout amount is pre-set
by the game operator. The third is Non-Cash Prizes, where points,
tickets, merchandise, or other items of the game operator's
choosing are awarded.

Tournaments
can be crafted to fit the needs of the operators' business and
the location type. ToPS™ adds numerous operator choices
to Stern's Portals™ software for easy operator tournament
set-up. Besides the type of tournament to run and when it starts
and ends, adjustments include: cost of tournament play, number
of winner places awarded prizes, adjustment of prize incrementing,
and much more. The Portals™ accounting functions are augmented
with many additions to provide complete tournament information
to the operator. Players can also enter a PIN number for security.

The Tournament
Pinball System can be installed in fifteen minutes or less.
The ToPS™ contents include:

" Dot matrix multi-color display to be installed on top
of game backbox

" Remote control, power supply for the display

" Wired 'Tournament Start' button for the game's lock-down
bar

" Connecting cable

" Tournament board that is to be installed inside the backbox

" Detailed manual

" Location promotional material

Playboy and RollerCoaster Tycoon™ are pre-wired for ToPS™
installation, as will be future Stern pinball machines. An operator
need only take out a few plastic plugs, mount the Tournament
Start button in its existing hole, screw on the pcb and display,
and plug in the cables.

The Tournament
Pinball System can be moved from one pinball machine to another
with great ease. Playboy, RollerCoaster Tycoon™, and future
Stern pinball machines are 'tournament ready' and can have ToPS™
affixed to them. The game operator can use his own dollar bill
validator.

ToPS™ has custom text messaging. Using the remote control
that is provided with the tournament display, the game operator
can program food and drink specials, upcoming events, and any
other information they would like to convey.

Courts have
held that pinball is a game of skill. Nonetheless, Stern advises
operators to check local laws, as they should for any tournament
game.

There is
a patent pending covering ToPS™.

Gary Stern
says, "This is a great advance in pinball. Tournament is
foremost in the minds of operators and players. Our experience
and our earnings with tournament pinball showed us why everyone
wants tournaments. ToPS™ earnings plus pinball resale value
make pinball a great investment for operators."
