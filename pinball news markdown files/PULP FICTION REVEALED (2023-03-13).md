Having confirmed the title four days previously, Chicago Gaming and Play Mechanix today launched their first joint collaboration with the reveal of their *Pulp Fiction* game.

The game comes in two versions – the top-end Bad Mother Flipper Limited Edition with a maximum of 1,000 units, and the simpler Special Edition. Both, as we previously reported, have a definite old-school feel to the design both on the outside and on the playfield.

The Bad Mother Flipper Limited Edition of Pulp Fiction

The game uses alpha-numeric LED displays rather than a dot-matrix display or an LCD panel, meaning there will be no clips from the movie displayed. However, the game does feature more than 250 sound samples from 19 different characters. It also includes five music tracks featured in the film – *Comanche*, *Jungle Boogie*, *Misirlou*, *Son of a Preacher Man* and *You Never Can Tell*.

The sounds and music come from speakers below the backbox behind a stainless steel grille.

The speaker panel

The brushed stainless steel coin door is similar to an ’80s Bally design, with two illuminated coin slots, two coin return flaps, a backlit game name panel and a lit start button.

The cabinet artwork is also retro-looking with a three colour design giving a stencilled appearance, although it probably uses cabinet decals like all modern games.

The top of the backbox sees the Limited Edition-exclusive animated topper featuring Mia and Vincent doing their iconic dance at Jack Rabbit Slim’s.

Here’s a video of the topper in action:

The $9,499 Limited Edition comes with a range of extra features over the Special Edition, such as a shaker motor, mirror blades, a numbered sculpted wallet on the bottom arch and a promo banner.

The $7,999 Special Edition comes with the same cabinet and backbox artwork as the Limited Edition, but lacks the topper, the flourishes on the speaker panel.

The Special Edition of Pulp Fiction

For those who wish to operate the game with a bill acceptor or card reader, a version of the Special Edition with a standard coin door is available at the same $7,999 price point.

The Limited Edition and two Special Edition models

The playfields of the Limited and Special Editions appear to be identical.

The Pulp Fiction playfield
(As with all pictures, click to enlarge)

As we said before, it’s a throwback to an age before ramps were mandatory with most of the action taking place at playfield level.

[![Pulp Fiction is a two-flippered game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/pulp-fiction/115-pulp-fiction-1024x602.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/pulp-fiction/115-pulp-fiction.jpg)

Pulp Fiction is a two-flippered game

That doesn’t mean it lacks playfield features though. In fact, the reverse is true.

[![The central playfield area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/pulp-fiction/103-pulp-fiction-1024x608.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/pulp-fiction/103-pulp-fiction.jpg)

The central playfield area

There are three inline drop targets in a lane leading to an upkicker, three more drops in an angled bank in the centre with a subway lock behind, and another drop target down a lane which ends with a saucer. There are spinners in the left and right orbit lanes, and a grab magnet on the right triggered by hitting a standup target.

[![Spelling out P-U-L-P-F-I-C-T-I-O-N is one of the features](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/pulp-fiction/113-pulp-fiction-1024x577.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/pulp-fiction/113-pulp-fiction.jpg)

Spelling out P-U-L-P-F-I-C-T-I-O-N is one of the features

Up at the top, there’s a classic saucer with adjacent lanes as seen on games such as *Mata Hari*. It’s worth noting that while the wallet on the bottom arch uses the phrase “Bad Mother Flipper”, the writing on the plastic next to the ‘2’ lane is less modest.

There are several sculpted models on the playfield.

Chicago Gaming announced their new game with the following message:

| --- |
| Pulp Fiction was developed in a collaboration between Play Mechanix and Chicago Gaming Company, and is being sold exclusively through Chicago Gaming Company’s pinball dealers.   Pulp Fiction is a retro-inspired full-featured modern pinball machine. Developed at the request of Quentin Tarantino who wanted an 1980’s style Pulp Fiction themed pinball machine for his home.   Tarantino’s continued involvement throughout the project shaped the final game. Tarantino rarely licenses his intellectual property, it is a unique privilege to produce a game which pays tribute to this masterpiece.  Pinball designer Mark Ritchie masterfully crafted a playfield which on its surface appears comparable to games from this era but outside of initial perception features more mechanisms and greater depth than most games produced today.   David Thiel forcefully pulls the player into this world utilizing over 250 iconic lines from Pulp Fiction’s legendary cast, five licensed songs from the original movie soundtrack, and a number of original compositions.   Josh Sharpe developed an approachable rule set that is both intuitive and deep enough to engage even the most skilled player.   o    250+ Iconic Lines of Pulp Fiction Dialogue Featuring 19 Movie Characters  o    5 Licensed Songs from the Pulp Fiction Soundtrack – Comanche, Jungle Boogie, Misirlou, Son of a Preacher Man & You Never Can Tell  o    Mirrored Backglass with Custom Hand-Drawn Artwork from Pulp Fiction’s Legendary Jack Rabbit Slim’s Dance Scene  o    RGB LED General Illumination Lighting, 15 RGB LED Featured Inserts, RGB LED Lower Arch Lighting  o    Vintage Stainless Steel Coin Door with LED Pulp Fiction Logo & Start Button on Door ***(Non-Coin Operated Models ONLY)***  o    4 Memory Drop Targets, 3 Drop Targets, Pawn Shop 3-Ball Subway Lock, Briefcase 3-Ball Lock;  Knocker Assembly |
