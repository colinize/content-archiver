Story dated 18th September
2002.

The
Dutch Pinball Association
magazine (Spinner) is to print an interview with Pat Lawlor about
his latest game - Rollercoaster Tycoon - and other pinball issues.

Many
thanks to Jim Jansen for the interview.

Q. When
was the first idea to make a pinball from Rollercoaster Tycoon?

We decided
to do Roller Coaster Tycoon in the September of last year. We contacted
the licensing group for the game and agreed rather quickly on a contract.
I was my idea to do this license based on how well amusement park
games usually do in pinball.

Q. How
long did you work on it?

We worked
on the game for around 10 months.

Q. What's
the goal of the game?

The main
goal of Roller Coaster Tycoon is to "turn on" rides in your
amusement park. That is the same as the PC Game. This is done by changing
the small traffic lights from red to yellow to green on each ride,
by shooting at that ride. This is how you lock balls for multi-ball.

The secondary
goal is to get as many people in your park as possible. All shots
add guests to the park. Your entire bonus is built on guests in the
park. Guests in the park are also one of the ways you can light "extra-ball".

Q. How
is your creative process working now you really have to take care
of the money you spend? Are there any gadgets in the game like the
mini-flipper in Monopoly?

The amount
of money we have to spend on the bill of materials for a game certainly
influences how we think about design. That has never changed in my
years in pinball. There are 3 "gadgets" in the game. The
first is the dummy for the "Dunk The Dummy" sideshow. The
second is the drop down ghost target on the middle roller coaster.
And the third is the spinning wheel target.

Q. What
are your expectations for the game?

Gary Stern
and I both have high expectations for the game.

Q. How
is it to be one of the last active pinball designers in the world?

You ask
about being one of the last active designers of pinball. I view that
2 ways: First, I view it as a challenge to get the game of pinball
back to its larger status of a few years ago. Second, I view it as
a need to teach other people about the craft that I have learned and
must be passed on to others. Pinball will suffer if the really creative
people are all gone and there is no-one to teach what they know.

Q. Are
you (still) going to arcades or pubs to play? Are you checking (or
listening) to people if they play one of your machines?

Yes I still
watch people play the games and still learn a lot from watching what
they do.

Q. Do you
have other pinballs at home besides the ones you've designed? What's
your favourite machine that you didn't design?

I have
one of every game that I designed at home. That takes up a large amount
of space!

My favourite
machine besides my games is High Speed by the great Steve Ritchie.
I also like an old game designed by Steve Kordek about 1970 called
7-Up.

Q. What
else are you doing besides designing pinballs?

Besides
pinball machines Pat Lawlor Design Inc. also designs redemption and
other coin-op equipment.

Q. Your
first machine for Stern was Monopoly. How do you look back on that
game? Do you think the quality of Stern machines will ever match that
of Bally/Williams machines?

Looking
back on Monopoly:

I think Monopoly is proof that Stern Pinball can be as good as Williams
Pinball. Many people in our business have said exactly that. Sometime
people like to live in the past and cannot get past labels. Williams
is gone. It will never be back making pinball. But the talented people
can (and are) back making games for Stern. I am a huge believer that
the people make the fun in a game happen. That the game is made by
Stern or Williams or some company on Mars is irrelevant. Great games
come from great people. Gary Stern very much should be congratulated
for keeping pinball alive. Gary is trying to build quality products
that will sell and make money in today's marketplace. I believe that
without Gary there would be no new pinball machines for people to
play today.

Q. Did
it sell well?

Monopoly
sold very well. (As well as a Williams game of the era).

Q. Is Rollercoaster
tycoon a better game?

Roller
Coaster Tycoon is a somewhat different game. As I said we have high
expectations for RCT.

Right now
the quality of a Stern game is equal to that of any Williams game
I ever worked on. But we cannot stand in place. There are more improvements
coming in the next year or so. I can't be more specific, but stay
tuned!

Q. Do you
know something about pinball in Holland?

I've never
been to Holland. I'm not much of a world traveller. I have only been
to Europe once and I visited Germany for a trade show. My schedule
makes it hard for me to travel much.

Q. How
do you see the future of pinball?

I think
the future of pinball is bright. We are once again starting to sell
more new games. A new generation of players is discovering the game
of pinball. I wouldn't be still doing pinball machines if I thought
they were a dead issue.

Q. What
will your next machine be?

We are
just now talking about our next pinball title so I can't really say
yet.

I wish
you and your readers well and thanks for playing our games.
