Usually at this time of year Pinball News would be reporting live from the Westin hotel in Wheeling, Illinois to bring you all the news and events from the world’s biggest and longest-running pinball show – Pinball Expo.

This year, holding a physical show in the current Coronavirus climate has not been possible. However, the Expo team, headed by founder Rob Berk, have been working hard from home to put together a packed schedule of virtual events which can be enjoyed by everyone for free.

Virtual Pinball Expo 2020

Rather than be restricted by what can be shown within the confines of the hotel’s Seminars Hall, the Virtual Pinball Expo will take viewers on tours of pinball factories, design workshops and game dealers around the world, as well as revealing some inside knowledge and untold stories from game designers and collectors.

Some events will be pre-recorded, but others will be live and interactive, allowing viewers to ask questions and make comments during the presentations.

At the time of writing the exact schedule is still being finalised, just as it always is during the physical Pinball Expo show.

However, we can give you a preview of the planned events over the four days of Virtual Pinball Expo 2020.

It all begins on Wednesday 14th October at 7pm US Eastern Standard Time with an introduction by Brigitt Berk who usually is found at the front desk throughout the show greeting visitors, answering questions and accepting gifts of chocolate.

All timings shown below are US Eastern Standard Time, so adjust for your local time accordingly.

Pre-recorded events will also be made available soon after the live stream through the [Pinball Expo website](http://pinballexpo.com/index.html). Live events will also be made available but will need to be edited and may take longer than the pre-recorded ones.

Thursday’s schedule begins at 5pm and includes a tour of Rob Berk’s home gameroom, a look around the new American Pinball factory where they are building *Hot Wheels*, and the virtual Belles & Chimes tournament.
