Story
dated
18 July, 2003

The UK Government is planning
reforms to the way amusement and gambling machines are taxed and it
is looking for views of interested parties; and that might include
you as machine players.

In its consultation document
entitled "The Modernisation of Gambling Taxes: Consultation on
the Review of Amusement Machine Licence Duty", Her Majesty's
Customs & Excise explain a suggested way to remove the current
Amusement Machine Licence Duty (AMLD) and replace it with a tax based
on machine profits.

Besides operators and manufacturers,
the Government wants to her from us as players and machine owners.
The report says "As part of this consultation, the Government
is particularly keen to hear the views of machine operators, suppliers,
manufacturers and trade representatives. It would also like to receive
comments from other interested parties, including academic researchers,
industry analysts and machine players."

At present, pinball machines
with a price per play exceeding 50p have to be licensed at a flat
rate of £250 per year per machine.

There have been several
effects of this flat-rate system, some beneficial and others damaging.

The price of a game of
pinball has largely been held at 50p, thus keeping the machine out
of the AMLD system. For players this represents good value but for
operators it may make a pinball game uneconomic to operate.

If a game makes little
or no money or only just breaks even at 50p per game, an operator
might wish to raise the price to 60p or even 70p, but by doing so
they would have to pay £250 for a licence making it uneconomic
again.

The two solutions to this
dilemma have been to either raise the price of a game substantially
- usually to £1, or to pull the machine off site completely,
either to storage or to sell.

In either of these cases
the player loses out.

The advantage to the AMLD
for operators is the certainty of knowing what the duty will be in
advance and thus being able to plan ahead.

Pinball, along with video
games are considered in the same broad group of machines as quiz games
and slot machines, although the latter are subdivided into several
categories depending on stake and jackpot size.

However, as we know, pinball
and video games do not give out cash prizes. The only reward of any
kind is the prospect of a free game, which is considered to have a
monetary worth. But does an extra ball have monetary value? What about
if you win 3 extra balls in a game, is that a free game?

Surely it is time to split
off pinball and video games and relax the taxation and licensing requirements
for these games where you win nothing physical except extended playing
time.

Also, the Government should
remove the current requirement to hold an operator licence to buy
and sell pinball games. The law is widely flouted in this regard as
a quick visit to eBay will show and anyone who owns a game and sells
it to a friend has committed a crime unless they hold a licence (which
costs over £6000).

So the UK Government wants
to hear from UK players and find out what they think of the reforms
and what reforms you think should take place.

You can read all about
the reforms at the HM
Customs & Excise website and you can download the consultation
document in Acrobat PDF format.

The closing date for your
comments is 6th October.
