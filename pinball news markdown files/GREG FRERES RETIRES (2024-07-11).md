Greg Freres

After gaining a degree in Fine Art, Greg started work in the advertising industry, creating point-of-purchase product displays. After two years there he jumped at the opportunity to join Bally as part of their in-house design team under Paul Faris, utilising his experience of creating designs which quickly grabbed the attention of passers-by.

While with Bally he created many iconic game artwork packages, starting with *Harlem Globetrotters* and *Rolling Stones*, followed by *Fathom*, *Strange Science* and the first of the three Elvira-themed games created together with game designer, Dennis Nordman.

As Williams effectively took over Bally, Greg stayed with the merged company to produce two more celebrated Dennis collaborations, with *Dr. Dude And His Excellent Ray* and *The Party Zone*. He stayed there until the pinball division closed at the end of 1999, after which he worked in a management role at the company’s video game division, Midway.

At the very end of William’s pinball days, Greg brought over a young artist from the Netherlands to intern at the company and study pinball art. Sadly, the closure meant it was a short-lived trip, but it inspired [the young Jean-Paul de Win](https://www.pinballnews.com/games/wizardofoz/index13.html) who went on the create the art and then art direct for all Jersey Jack Pinball’s titles, as well as work with Dutch Pinball on their *The Big Lebowski*.

Greg’s canon of work was honoured with his induction into the [Pinball Expo Hall of Fame in 2004](https://www.pinballnews.com/shows/expo2004/banquet.html), where he was inducted by game designer, Steve Ritchie, with whom he worked on the games *Star Trek: The Next Generation* and *No Fear: Dangerous Sports*.

Keen to return to the world of pinball design, Greg reunited with Dennis to create their *Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons* retheme of the *Continental Café* game under their WhizBang Pinball brand. Originally just a small run for private buyers, the game was [subsequently manufactured in collaboration with Stern Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/news/nellie.html) where the design went on to form the basis of the *Pabst Can Crusher* and *Primus* games.

Greg also did some freelance work on other titles for Stern Pinball before working on new start-up Jersey Jack Pinball’s first title, *The Wizard of Oz*.

In 2012 Greg was [appointed as a Game Designer at Stern](https://www.pinballnews.com/news/freres.html), but soon became Art Director there, a position he held for nearly twelve years until his recently-announced retirement.
