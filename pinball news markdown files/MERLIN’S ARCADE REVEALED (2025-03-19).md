The theme and layout is one game designer Jon Norris has been promoting for several years, and it was slated to be one of Jon’s games produced during his time at Deeproot Pinball. Turner Pinball acquired the rights to many former Deeproot Pinball assets when the whole Deeproot business collapsed.

Both the Arcade and Legendary Editions come with the removable playfield glass frame with integrated RGB lighting, as seen on *Ninja Eclipse*. They share the same high-quality cabinetry too, which even includes a clearcoated bottom panel.

Besides designing the layout and mechs, Jon also created a comprehensive ruleset for the game. This includes:

* Eight Light Knight Battles
* Eight Dark Knight Battles
* Four Duel Boss Modes
* Special Multiball for Each Knight (Light and Dark)
* Merlin Multiball
* Two Wizard Modes
