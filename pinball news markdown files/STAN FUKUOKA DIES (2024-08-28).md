Alongside careers as a toy designer and animator, Stan came to prominence in the pinball world soon after Capcom’s pinball division was launched in 1995.

He created the artwork for the company’s third release, *Breakshot*, followed by two titles which, although never going into production, soon became highly desirable. Capcom Pinball closed before *Big Bang Bar* and *Kingpin* were scheduled to be manufactured, with only a small number of prototype games built.

*Big Bang Bar* was subsequently manufactured by Pinball Manufacturing Inc./Illinois Pin Ball with a little under 200 units built. Meanwhile, both Illinois Pin Ball and the Circus Maximus team announced their intention to make *Kingpin* games, although nothing came of those plans.

Stan’s individualistic style made his artwork as instantly recognisable as it was highly desirable. You can see many examples of his work on his website [stanfukuoka.com](https://www.stanfukuoka.com/) where you can also purchase the original paintings of his pinball translites.

There is a memorial service planned for Tuesday 4th September. His family request that, in lieu of sending flowers, well-wishers should make a donation to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. at [lls.org](https://www.lls.org/).
