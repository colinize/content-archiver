When Stern Pinball introduced their Spike controller board into their machines earlier this year, one of the key improvements over the previous SAM system was the support for driving LCD screens.

But while others have incorporated LCD panels of various sizes into their game designs, Stern have been
reluctant to make the transition away from dot matrix displays to show scores, gameplay instructions, visual effects and diagnostic menus.

It wasn't until Whoa Nellie - Big Juicy Melons that Stern first added an LCD, and even then it was only a tiny monochrome panel showing basic score and diagnostic displays.

As those who have gone the LCD route have found, producing the high-quality animations expected by gamers these days means expending a significant amount of graphics resources - both in terms of time, personnel and money.

Two new appointments at Stern Pinball demonstrate exactly that increased focus on creating new graphical content for their impending move to using LCDs, and also suggest an increased separation in the company between their game design and game manufacturing operations.

Chuck Ernst and Zac Stark have both joined Stern's Game Design Studio - the part of the business tasked with creating designs for the manufacturing section to then build.

Chuck joins as the new Computer Graphics Art Director.

Before joining Stern, Chuck was working as Technical Character Design Lead on the Mortal Kombat X game, and he has been involved in more than 45 titles for companies such as Atari, Sega and Midway. He also designs and prototypes toys, which must have struck a chord with Stern's Executive Vice President of Game Design, George Gomez who has a similar history in toy design.

Also joining Stern's Game Design Studio is Zac Stark.

Zac had been teaching computer game production and creating online content for online universities before joining Stern. Before that he worked with toy companies Ty and Mattel to create digital animations and web-based games featuring their portfolio of characters.

George Gomez said about the two new appointments, "We are delighted to have these two talented artists join our studio. They will help us continue to advance pinball both technologically and through game play enhancements.”
