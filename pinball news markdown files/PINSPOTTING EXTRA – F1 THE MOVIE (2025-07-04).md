Formula One motor racing (F1) is an international sport that has the largest attendance per event with crowds exceeding an average of 270,000.

Brad Pitt stars as veteran motor racing driver Sonny Hayes in *[F1:](https://filmandfurniture.com/film/f1-the-movie/) [The](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16311594/)[Movie](https://filmandfurniture.com/film/f1-the-movie/)* where, in an early scene, we see him playing a 1970 Williams Electronics Inc. *[Grand Prix](https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=5647)* pinball machine. Surprisingly, there are several closeups of the playfield, and it ‘fits’ into this scene rather than just being a decoration.

A reviewer said of *F1: The Movie*: “*Just the way it was with ‘Top Gun: Maverick’, Joseph Kosinski has once again delivered something that pulls you back to cinemas. This is what I call an experience. This movie is what movies are all about. They made promises with this and fulfilled every single one of them. It’s got that story, a young guy taught by the veteran, but everything is done so spectacularly well that, when you leave the theatre, you feel like jumping into a Formula 1 car yourself. Brad Pitt, it had to be you, I’m convinced that this guy just doesn’t do bad movies. In the movie, it feels like it’s Brad just being Brad. And it’s amazing.*“

*F1: The Movie*, is more Hollywood than documentary, but there were several scenes filmed at genuine F1 races during the 2024 season, and several F1 racers and team members that appear in the movie.

We enjoyed watching the film and would encourage you to attend a screening.

*F1: The Movie* is now showing in theatres and is available in 4DX and IMAX.
