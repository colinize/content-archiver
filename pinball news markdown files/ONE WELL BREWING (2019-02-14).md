When I saw that noted pinball collector Mike Schudel was having a New Year’s Eve party, I made plans to attend and also play the four pins he operates alongside those from the owner at [One Well Brewing](http://onewellbrewing.com/) in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

I went to the brewery the night before Mike’s party. The place was mobbed. Luckily, it was only a short wait for a beer and there was always a pin or two open.

It was nice to see so many people of all ages playing the pinball machines there. The long wall of pins had an excellent variety of titles.

They have eleven pins to play. The line-up of titles seem to change frequently. Three of them have been swapped out already since I was there last month.

All the pins were extremely clean and worked perfectly.

The brewery also serves food, with pizza being their specialty. The beer and food tasted great. I drank their popular Cosmic Rip IPA. The staff was very friendly.

I wish I lived in Kalamazoo – I would be there every weekend.
