We reported in September last year on the opening   of the Pbal Gallery pinball museum in Budapest.  But little did owner   Balázs Pálfi and manager Attila Vigh realise that a state-sponsored   undercover operation had been underway to close   down the museum and confiscate all the machines.

Setting up a public museum is rarely free from red   tape, and so the year before they opened, Balázs and Attila embarked on   the lengthy process of obtaining the necessary permit to operate.    Attila told Pinball News, "It is an authorization   granted by the Ministry of Human Resources which makes it possible for   our pinball gallery to operate officially as a public exhibition. The   people from the government and we both agreed that we didn't need to get   any other permits, because the Gambling Act   does not apply to pinball machines exhibited at museums."  However, that opinion was not shared by another branch of the Hungarian government.

The day after they opened in April 2014, the   division of the National Tax Authority responsible for gaming - the   Hungarian Gambling Supervision Commission - made the first of a series   of undercover visits to the museum.  Their conclusion   was in stark contrast to that of the Ministry of Human Resources.  They   said the pinballs were not eligible for public display, not even at an   official museum with the correct permissions.  They not only wanted the   museum closed down and a hefty fine imposed,   they considered the violation of the Gambling Act was severe enough to   warrant the seizure of all the machines, despite the fact they belonged   to Balázs' private collection.

Balázs and Attila told us, "This was the first   time we realized there might be a problem.  Nobody had contacted us   before; it was a covert operation. Needless to say we were shocked."

At the heart of the problem was the structure of   the museum's entry fee, which contained an element to pay for playing on   the machines (which were all set to free play).  Although this pricing   system is not illegal in Hungary, the Commission   thought it was unusual enough to warrant classification of the museum   as an arcade or bar.  This would mean an annual operational licence   costing tens of millions of Hungarian Forints (HUF 10,000,000 =   $35,000/€32,000/£23,000) which would have undermined the   museum's financial viability.

Over time the commission's attitude softened   somewhat, with the threat to seize the machines and force closure   removed.  But their classification system still didn't accommodate the   museum’s unique hands-on educational nature without considering   it as one big arcade.  So that was their ruling - pay a huge annual   licence fee and a sizeable fine for the previous contravention.

Balázs asked Attila - who is also a lawyer - to   file an appeal against the commission's decision with the court, and the   campaign to save the museum began in earnest.

Balázs explained the steps they took once their appeal had been filed.  He said, "We   spoke with several other lawyers and experts in order to get other   useful opinions.  We also asked for a private meeting with   representatives of the Ministry for National Economy to alter the related law itself. This is in progress and we'll see the outcome.  We consulted with the Tax Authority in person too and our views seemed to be converging; they verbally confirmed to us a way to smooth future operations, envisaging only some small alterations to the structure of the ticket price. But in their written decisions they dealt with the issue in a completely different spirit.  That was our main problem.  Lots of our friends also expressed their great support in various ways."

Attila explained how they put their case against the commission's ruling.

He said, "I wrote and made the appeal along with   many petitions, proposals and remarks during the past year, while my   high-school friend (another lawyer) represented the case verbally this   June at the trial. Very briefly, the application   consisted of three parts:

1. The imposition of a totally impossible   condition demanded by the Tax Authority, plus a proper and thorough   explanation of the Gambling Act and why it does not apply to our   machines.

2. The exact definition of an interactive museum and the educational nature of our institution.

3. Plenty of examples of other legitimate   Hungarian interactive exhibitions and museums. We had a famous   museologist witness too, although in the end  they didn't need to be   heard by the jury."

The court's decision came on July 2nd.

In a resounding victory, the educational nature of   the museum was recognised by the court's ruling, pinball machines were   confirmed as non-gambling devices, the fine imposed by the commission   was overturned, and all legal costs incurred   by the museum will be reimbursed.

Balázs was delighted with the outcome.  "I   consider it to be a great success. It's also emotionally comforting to   be able to continue our work, to focus on the most important things   now.  This hobby is an essential part of my life and   much more than a hobby (as to all of us). The authorities did not   terminate a huge, thriving and enthusiastic pinball community, although   they said it was not their goal."

Most importantly, the museum will re-open on August 5th.

The museum's doors will soon re-open
