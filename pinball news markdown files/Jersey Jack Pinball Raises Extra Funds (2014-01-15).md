Amid rumours of funding difficulties, Jersey Jack Pinball today announced they had sold part of the company to the investment arm of JDA - an equity investment and restructuring firm.

The deal appears to closely match the one undertaken by Stern Pinball at the end of 2009 which brought in Dave Peterson of Hagerty Peterson as an investor.

No further details of the deal with JDA have been released except  that JDA came to Jersey Jack Pinball with an investment proposal and the founders of the equity investment firm are pinball enthusiasts, owning more than 40 machines including The Wizard of Oz from JJP.

The deal will see JDA take a stake in the company, supply additional funding, and provide restructuring and organisational advice to help ensure financial stability in the short to medium term. This should remove any doubt about the completion of The Wizard of Oz's run, and give reassurance to pre-orderers of JJP's second title, The Hobbit.

Undoubtedly this will lead to some changes at Jersey Jack Pinball as efficiency savings are found and workflows streamlined, and we'll be sure to bring them to you as they are announced.

Here's how JJP announced the deal:
