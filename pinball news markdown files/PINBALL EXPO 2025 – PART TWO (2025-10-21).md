**Date:** 15th-18th October 2025

**Location:**
Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel,
1551 N. Thoreau Drive, Schaumburg, IL 60173, USA

Welcome to the continuation of our extensive coverage of this year’s 41st Pinball Expo show. In [Part One](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2025/10/15/pinball-expo-2025/) we covered all the set-up on Tuesday and Wednesday leading up to the opening of the show hall on Thursday, as well as all 18 of Thursday’s seminars.

**FRIDAY**

Friday is the day of the Stern Pinball factory tour. Show attendees purchasing the full $200 three-day package or the advance registration package had the Stern factory tour included. For everyone else it was available as a $35 add-on.

Those taking the tour could choose one of four time slots – 8:45am, 10:15am, 11:45am or 1:15pm – to board their bus for the 15-minute journey from Schaumburg to Stern’s home in Elk Grove Village.

Pinball News remained behind to run and record Friday’s seminars, but Jonathan Joosten, Editor of Pinball Magazine and seminars assistant, took the tour and got us all these pictures. As usual, photography is not permitted on the factory floor, but there’s still plenty of interest to see.

Dave Marston began this segment of the Pinball Expo seminars schedule by talking about the life and work of voice artist Fred Young, including his voice talent on multiple pinball machines. Fred was inducted into the Pinball Expo Hall of Fame last year, but passed away soon afterwards.

[![Pinball Expo Hall of Fame 2024 inductee, Fred Young](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/443-pinball-expo-2024-1024x700.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2024/443-pinball-expo-2024.jpg)

Fred Young’s induction into the Pinball Expo Hall of Fame in 2024

The year since the previous Pinball Expo also saw the passing of the hugely popular pinball repairer, Rob Anthony. Rob and his dog would be regular fixtures at several major US pinball shows, setting up his stand to sell assorted parts, mods, books and novelties, while also performing board repair work.

J.J. Babich from Game Exchange in Colorado has been managing much of Rob’s estate, resolving outstanding orders and repairs. J.J. brought Rob’s ashes which have been housed in a pinball-shaped casket along with vendor badges from many of the shows he attended.

[![J.J. Babich with Rob Anthony's memorial containing his ashes](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/337-pinball-expo-2025-729x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/337-pinball-expo-2025.jpg)

His death came as a shock to the community, not least because he left no family other that his beloved dog, Antar. Fortunately, Antar has found a new home as we saw in one of the two video tributes.

Dwight Sullivan

The traditional closing event of the Pinball Expo seminars schedule is Dwight Sullivan’s Let’s Make a Deal gameshow. Contestants drawn at random compete to be the first to name a pinball title which is gradually revealed, with the winners getting to choose between prize boxes or envelopes, both of which contain either a mystery prize of Stern Pinball swag, a golden ticket to the final round, or a ‘Zonk!’ which is worth nothing.

However, the final homebrew is also the largest. Pinball Expo Chairman, Rob Berk, commissioned this giant game which was shown in an early version at last year’s Expo. This year it is nearer completion but there is more work still to be done.

Finally, we come to the Flip Out pinball tournaments held in Schaumburg E, F, G & H rooms which were combined into one long room, with the entrance through Schaumburg E.

The tournaments desk

There were three Flip Out tournaments – the main, the women’s and the classics. Deborah Tahlman was the main tournament director, aided by a highly dedicated crew of volunteers.

[![Trophies for the top four in each tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/917-pinball-expo-2025-1024x528.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/917-pinball-expo-2025.jpg)

Trophies for the top four in each tournament

The main attracted the largest field and, after an initial qualifying session on Wednesday and Thursday, was split into A and B divisions with the top half of the qualifiers in A and the bottom half in B. It used the multi-bye system where the higher a player qualified, the more byes they received through the earlier play-off rounds which began at 10am on Friday. Entry to the main tournament cost $110 with the top prize of one of the Pro Stern Pinball machines used in the tournaments.

[![Play in the main Flip Out tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/915-pinball-expo-2025-1024x662.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/915-pinball-expo-2025.jpg)

Play in the main Flip Out tournament

The women’s tournament also split the qualifiers in A and B divisions, with the play-offs starting at noon on Saturday. The entry fee was $40.

Play in the women’s tournament

In the classics, qualifying used an unlimited entry system with players’ best scores on each machine counting towards their qualifying position. Entries cost $10 for 3 games.

Play in the classics tournament

Due to our continuing work in the seminars room we weren’t able to be at the finals of the main B division or the women’s tournament, but Jim Schelberg kindly got us some pictures of the winners.

In the main tournament’s B division finals, Matthew Knippen was the winner, Paul Younis was second, James Zwitkowits was third and Brian Collins fourth.

The B division was won by Melissa Provost, with Theresa Martin second, Tiffany Han third, and Eva Ashton fourth.

In the main tournament’s A division, although the play-offs began at 10am on Friday, by late Saturday night it was clear there was still some way to go until a winner could be declared. Having been working in the tournaments room all day and then packing away all the equipment when the final seminar finished at 11pm, we called in around 1am but there were still multiple matches to be played.

Fortunately, Jim Schelberg stayed up until the final was eventually decided at 5:30am. After Logan Henderson won the loser bracket and then beat the winner of the winner’s bracket, Arvid Flygare, the final was decided on a single sudden-death game of *The Mandelorian*. The winner of that game and the A division was Arvid from Sweden. Logan was second, Zach Sharpe third and Raymond Davidson fourth.

You can watch all the play-offs on the Fox Cities Pinball channels on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/foxcitiespinball/videos) right now and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Foxcitiespinball/videos) a little later.

Finally, we come to the classics tournament. The play-offs for these didn’t begin until 9am on Sunday. Although the Pinball Expo officially ended at 1am and the tear down was underway in the main hall, the classics tournament continued, although all the modern machines were taken out of the tournaments area and there was no live streaming.

Just the classics tournament to decide

The classics didn’t conclude until 8:25pm. The two finalists were Dalton Ely and Daniele Celestino Acciari and it all came down to a game on *Harlem Globetrotters*.

[![Dalton plays as Danieli watches](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/908-pinball-expo-2025-1024x647.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/908-pinball-expo-2025.jpg)

On his third ball, Dalton couldn’t catch Daniele’s ball two total, making Daniele the winner of the game and the classics tournament.

The trophy and prize presentation wrapped things up for Pinball Expo 2025.

During Sunday afternoon the main hall had gradually emptied until almost all signs of there having been a pinball show had vanished.

[![Early Sunday, machines were folded up ready to be shipped out](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/904-pinball-expo-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2025/904-pinball-expo-2025.jpg)

By mid-afternoon, this was all that remained of Pinball Expo 2025

And so we bring this Pinball News report from Pinball Expo to a close.

Naturally, there’s so much more taking place both at Expo and in the immediate area than we are able to report in person. The annual Pinball Olympics deserve a special mention for the outlandish challenges players have to endure while playing the games. There are multiple alternative tournaments taking place both in the Expo hall and at nearby locations, while several social get-togethers were held at Enterrium during the show.

While we couldn’t cover them all, we hope you enjoyed our coverage of all the seminars, the show hall and the autograph session. A shout out to Jonathan Joosten for his help with the seminars which allowed us to escape for a few hours to report on the rest of the show.

We’ll be back next year for the 42nd Pinball Expo, October 14th-17th 2026.
