**Location:**
839 W Fulton Market, Chicago, IL 60607, USA

A third Emporium barcade opened in late 2017. The [Emporium Fulton Market](https://emporiumchicago.com/location/fulton-market/) is in Chicago’s Near West Side.

Fulton Market was once an industrial meat-packing area, but it is now being transformed into a night-life entertainment destination. That transformation is still underway.

The barcade is a very short walk from the CTA’s Green and Pink Morgan station.

This Emporium location has ten pinball machines and many classic video games.

It was a nice bright, airy location, though the daylight did not interfere with the game play.

The pins were in decent shape, but a few of them needed some minor mechanical repairs.
