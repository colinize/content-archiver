Dutch Pinball Exclusive – the recently announced joint venture between Dutch Pinball’s Barry Driessen and Melvin Brouwer-Williams – has confirmed that their launch title will be *Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland*, based on the classic 1865 children’s book by Lewis Carrol.

In an announcement made today, Dutch Pinball Exclusive (DPX) revealed the theme of their first release, confirming the speculation recently covered in the joint [Pinball News and Pinball Magazine PINcast](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/04/02/march-2024-pincast/).

DPX was created to design and manufacture small-run boutique titles. Their factory and offices are located in a building [across the street from the Dutch Pinball factory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bbE6trFH9vtFg9jS7) in Herkenbosch in the Netherlands.

The *Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland* design is an evolution of the *Alice in Wonderland* machine conceived by John Popadiuk. This was one of the games in development by John’s Zidware company when it collapsed, although it never went beyond a cardboard mock-up.

The assets relating to *Alice in Wonderland* as well as the other two former Zidware titles, *Magic Girl* and *Retro Atomic Zombie Adventureland*, were acquired by Melvin Brouwer-Williams. Some of these came from the two storage units of artwork, designs and development pieces sold to [settle the case against John brought by a group of pre-order buyers](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/12/01/zidware-case-resolved/).

The Zidware title featured line-art artwork by Jeremy Packer (a.k.a. Zombie Yeti). He is now working for Stern Pinball, so it is no surprise that the teaser poster features artwork from a different artist.

Whether Jeremy’s original art will be coloured and utilised in the new game is yet to be seen, although the picture above of Barry and Melvin has them standing either side of a game, where the backglass appears to feature a coloured version of Jeremy’s drawing.

The change in name is significant too. The *Alice In Wonderland* title is copyrighted by Disney in relation to their 1951 movie of that name and any use of the name or film assets would need to be licensed. *Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland* is the title of the book from 1865 on which the movie was based. That book and its title are now public domain and so can be freely used.

Perhaps not surprisingly, DPX stresses how they are not taking orders or seeking pre-order deposits at this time, but do ask anyone with interest in purchasing the game to contact their DPX distributor so they can be kept updated on pricing and availability, and to help DPX gauge likely interest.

Here’s how DPX made the announcement about *Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland*.
