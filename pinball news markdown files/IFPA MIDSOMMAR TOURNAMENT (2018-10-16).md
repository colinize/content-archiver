**Date:**
5th - 7th October, 2018

**Location:**
Bulls & Balls, In den Straußwiesen 4, 36039 Fulda, Germany

We had heard great things about [Bulls & Balls in Fulda](https://www.facebook.com/pg/BullsandBalls/about/), Germany, but never visited ourselves to see what all the fuss was about.  So, when IFPA Country Director, Tobias Wagemann, invited us to the IFPA Midsommar Tournament weekend he was organising, we jumped at the chance.

Although we had been to Germany many times, we’d never been to Fulda or the Hesse region, so this was a new experience for us and Fulda didn’t disappoint with its Baroque architecture nestled side-by-side with much more recent, but sympathetic, designs in the newer part of the city.

We after checking-in to our hotel, we arrived at Bulls & Balls around 6pm on Friday which was just in time for the start of the first competitive event of the weekend, the Warm-Up Tournament.

Bulls & Balls is jointly-owned by Matthias Klüber and Jürgen Gärtner.  It is located a little way out of Fulda’s central area, but pretty much everything in Fulda is reachable on foot, so even from our hotel (the B&B Hotel which was the opposite side of town and which Matthias very kindly provided for us), it was only around a 20-minute walk to get there.  And, as you can see, the weather was good and the temperatures very pleasant for October.

[![The driveway to Bulls & Balls](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/01-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/01-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The driveway to Bulls & Balls

To get to Bulls & Balls, first you walk up the driveway and past a car garage, then turn left behind the garage.

[![Yes, this is the right way](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/02-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/02-midsommar-2018.jpg)

Yes, this is the right way

Once there, you find a number of outdoor tables and benches, and a limited amount of car parking.

[![The entrance to Bulls & Balls](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/03-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/03-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The entrance to Bulls & Balls

You might notice in the picture above how some of the tables are built from stacked beer crates.  This is a theme you’ll see repeated quite a few times during this report.

So, let’s take a quick tour of Bulls & Balls to show you where everything is.

The entrance you can see in the picture above, but once through the doors you come to the lobby which is where everyone hangs out between rounds when it’s too dark, too cold or too wet to go outside.  This is also where everyone can check the scores and standings.

[![The lobby area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/04-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/04-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The lobby area

[![The main bar](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/81-midsommar-2018-1024x690.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/81-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The main bar

On the far left of the picture above is the main bar (there are two), but there is another room further left which you can’t see here.  This is normally a billiards room, but for this event the tables had been moved out and 14 solid-state pinballs installed on which the Classics Tournament would be played on Saturday.

[![Normally the room for billiards, for this weekend it was for the Classics Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/09-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/09-midsommar-2018.jpg)

To the right of the bar is a corridor which leads to both the toilets and to the function room where players gathered at the start of each day to hear about the tournament formats and also for lunch around 1pm-2pm on Saturday and Sunday.

Well, come back to this a little later but continuing around the lobby, or next area is the main pinball room.

[![The main pinball room is on the right side of the lobby](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/23-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/23-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The competitors are ready for the start of the Warm-Up Tournament

The Warm-Up Tournament was played using the Swiss system of head-to-head pairings formed, initially, randomly, but thereafter with players with the same or similar numbers of wins playing together.  That means players who keep winning move up to the top and play tougher games against others who are also winning, while at the bottom those who lose their matches play easier games with other losing players.

Friday’s Warm-Up Tournament

After all the games in the first round had been played, the players were ranked and new pairings made for the next round.  This continued until midnight when the final results were announced.

When the Warm-Up Tournament had concluded, the player who got his weekend off to a winning start was Ernö Rotter.  Julio Vicario Soriano was second, Flavio Baddaria third and Wolfgang Haid fourth.  They received their trophies at the awards ceremony on Sunday morning.

One the tournament was over, the machines were available for free play up until the venue closed, which was soon after 1am. Players could then get some sleep before the first full day of competition on Saturday.

There were two tournaments held on Saturday.

The first was the PinGolf Tournament which began at 10am by splitting the 82 players into two pools.  Each pool was then further divided into groups of four who played two rounds of nine machines.

As usual in pingolf tournaments, each machine had a target to achieve with the aim of reaching it using the fewest balls possible. The target was always a points score but was generally different for each game and set at a level to make each game equally challenging.

If the target was reached during the game then the ball number was recorded as the score for that game.  If the target was missed after three balls then there was a sliding scale up to a maximum of seven according to the final points total achieved.  In the example below, reaching the target of 30 million points scored the number of balls it took, but if the three-ball game total was only 20 million then a five would be recorded.

Alongside the PinGolf, the Classic Tournament ran in its own dedicated room.

There were fourteen solid-state pinballs set up, although the Haunted House was not included and, being a little fragile after all these years, some games would occasionally go down for a brief period.

There was a long row of seven machines on the right side of the room: *Eight Ball*, *Harlem Globetrotters*, *The Six Million Dollar Man*, *Dolly Parton*, *Nitro Groundshaker*, *Nugent* and *Bobby Orr Power Play*.

[![Seven of the Classic Tournament machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/10-midsommar-2018-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/10-midsommar-2018.jpg)

Facing those seven were two smaller banks of machines.

Haunted House, Charlie’s Angels, Sinbad, Lucky Seven and Mr. & Mrs. Pac-Man

Players could choose any eight of the available machines to play.  They then started a two-player game and played both players.  The two scores were recorded on handheld devices and entered into a database where they were ranked and points awarded.

Qualification

At just after 2pm, all play in both tournaments was halted for an hour while a buffet lunch was served in the function room.  Hot dishes of meatballs in gravy, pork schnitzel, pasta, mushroom sauce and more were available, with a selection of vegetarian alternatives also on offer for those who pre-ordered them.

[![The remains of the lunch buffet](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/28-midsommar-2018-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/28-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The remains of the lunch buffet

This lunch buffet was repeated on Sunday at 1pm, with a different selection of dishes available.

When the Classic Tournament’s qualifying round ended at 8pm, the top sixteen players continued to the play-offs which were head-to-head best-of-three matches initially, until the last four were decided.

Play-offs in the Classic Tournament

The final four then played three four-player games using the 4-2-1-0 scoring system.  The finalists were Erwin Deutschländer, Martin Janczyk, Albert Nomden and Jürgen Urban, and they played on *Flight 2000*, *Bobby Orr Power Play* and *Nugent*.

The final of the Classic Tournament

Jürgen won the first game on *Flight 2000* and came second on *Bobby Orr Power Play* for a total of 6 points going into the last game.  Albert won on *Power Play* but came last on *Flight 2000* for his 4 points total, however he could still catch Jürgen on the final game as could Erwin who had a second and third place for 3 points.  Martin had a third and fourth which gave him just 1 point and put him out of the running.

Martin won the last game on *Nugent* to give him 5 points in total and third place overall.  Albert came second for a total of 6 points – the same as Jürgen had going into the last game, but Jürgen took third place on *Nugent* and got the extra 1 point which gave him the win.  Erwin was fourth in this game and fourth overall.

The PinGolf Tournament’s final sixteen were: Erwin Deutschländer, Jens Flügge, Benjamin Gräbeldinger, Martin Hotze, Mario Kertels, Julian Klotz, Archibald Lefevre, Jim Lindsay, Rich Mallett, Alexander Muer, Albert Nomden, Johannes Ostermeier, Roland Schwarz, Julio Vicario Soriano, Tobias Wagemann and John van der Wulp.  They were made up from the top eight players in each pool.

They played off in four groups of four, continuing the PinGolf scoring but only playing three machines.  The remaining machines were then available for everyone else to play for the rest of the evening.

When the games had been concluded, the top player in each group went into the final.  They were: Jens Flügge, Benjamin Gräbeldinger, Johannes Ostermeier and Julio Vicario Soriano.  The final was also played on three machines, starting with *Iron Maiden* and continuing with *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Terminator 2*. Once again, the player with the lowest number of balls needed to reach the three target scores would win.

Although Saturday’s tournaments didn’t finish until late, there was still more to come, with a Midnight Madness tournament starting at, well, midnight of course.

This was played on the three newest Stern machines and an entry consisted on one game on each.  The initial entry to the tournament cost €5, while extra entries cost €2 each.  All proceeds went to the Medicines Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders) charity.

Needless to say, we didn’t stay up for this one but 21 players did take part, with the winner being Flavio Baddaria.

Sunday morning began with the trophy presentations for Friday and Saturday’s tournaments, before Sunday’s main tournament was introduced. This was the Five Strikes Tournament.  This paired up the 80 players to play head-to-head single games.  Players continued in the tournament until they lost five games at which point they were out.

Eventually we were down to the last six players with any lives remaining.  They were: Johannes Ostermeier (4 strikes left), Julio Vicario Soriano (3 strikes left), Eberhard Hattemer (2 strikes left), Cesare Datri (1 strike left), Albert Nomden (1 strike left) and Jens Flügge (1 strike left).  To make up the eight players for the two semi-finals, they were joined by two players from the four who picked up their fifth strike in the last round.  Four players went out in that round, so they played a play-off game on *Guardians of the Galaxy* to decide which two went into the semi-finals.

[![The play-offs for the seventh & eighth semi-final places](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/63-midsommar-2018-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/midsommar-2018/63-midsommar-2018.jpg)

The play-offs for the seventh & eighth semi-final places

The two winners from that play-off were Roland Schwarz and John van der Wulp.

Those eight were split into two groups of four to play three machines with 4-2-1-0 scoring.  However, the number of strikes remaining (if any) were carried forward giving Johannes 4 points, Julio 3 points, Eberhard 2 points, and 1 point each to Cesare, Albert and Jens.

The first group features Johannes, Julio, Roland and John, and they played on *Guardians of the Galaxy*, *Jackbot* and *The Walking Dead*.

The second group had Eberhard, Jens, Cesare and Albert.  They played on *Deadpool*, *High Speed 2: The Getaway* and *Metallica*.

Johannes and Roland were the winners of their group.  They were joined in the final by Jens and Albert.

We had to leave for the journey to Frankfurt Airport and the flight back to London, but in the final it was a win for Johannes who finished ahead of Roland in second, with Jens third and Albert fourth.

An ad-hoc Women’s Tournament was also held on Sunday, run by Dina Lindsay.  This was run on a selection of machines at the far end of the main games room and consisted of ranked scores on each machine.

Play in the Women’s Tournament

We don’t have the final results of the Women’s Tournament yet but will add them here when we get them.

As you will have seen, this was a pretty full-on weekend of competitive pinball for all the competitors, and Bulls & Balls was an ideal location to host the 80+ competitors.  Being a featured Audition Location for Pinball Universe means Bulls & Balls gets the latest Stern games for potential buyers to try during normal opening, but also for use in the tournaments.  Pinball Universe brought twelve games to Bulls & Balls which allowed competitors to try games such as Deadpool and Iron Maiden which they might not have previously seen.

The facilities both inside the building and in the surrounding area were excellent, with shops, hotels, restaurants, bars and transport all close-by, and a fascinating array of historic buildings and grounds to explore.

The tournaments were all well organised and planned, with published schedules closely followed and everyone in the mood for a fun weekend of competition.

It was purely a tournament weekend though.  Once the first round of the tournaments began there were no free-play machines available and little for non-playing partners, friends or spectators to do at the venue.  Those involved in the tournaments came to compete and thus were occupied nearly the whole time.  We spoke with a number of players who said they had been to Bulls & Balls several times for tournament events such as this and never seen anything of the city itself, which seemed a shame given all there is to enjoy just a short walk away.

So, we thoroughly recommend attending one of these weekends – there is Christmas event coming up a little later in the year – but allow an extra day or two to explore the city and surrounding area.  It’s definitely worth making the effort.
