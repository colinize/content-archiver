New pinball company Barrels of Fun has revealed their launch game, based on the Jim Henson movie, *Labyrinth*.

Barrels of Fun’s new Labyrinth game

Barrels of Fun is based in Houston, Texas, USA and was established by David van Es, who worked for Spooky Pinball for seven years designing games and is the new company’s CEO and game designer, and Brian Savage who was in charge of manufacturing Hasbo action figures *G.I. Joe* and *Transformers*.

Also on the team are Art Director, Johnny Fraser-Allen, Blake Dumesnil who looks after the marketing graphics, Phil Grimaldi who crafts the game rules alongside Bowen Kerins who has designed rulesets for Spooky Pinball and Multimorphic, and motion graphics artist, Trent Armstrong.

They are joined by Engineering Designer, Travis Moseman, Software Engineer, Eric Priepke who wrote the ‘Continued’ code for Cactus Canyon as well as coding Rich and Morty at Spooky, Chief Technology Officer, David Fawcett, and head of manufacturing, Paul Sulisz who was Director of Manufacturing at American Pinball.

Until now they have called themselves ‘Mystery Pinball Company’ and sent out various teasers about their upcoming game with the intention of revealing all at Pinball Expo next week.

Now they have confirmed their real company name, announced *Labyrinth* as their launch title, and given full details of the game along with its price.

Barrels of Fun’s Labyrinth game

*Jim Henson’s Labyrinth* will have a maximum run of 1,100 units, priced at US$10,600. The company is playing hard on the collectability and limited production run of the game – even down to their website URL of [kollectfun.com](https://shop.kollectfun.com/) – although just how popular the 1986 movie remains some 37 years after it was first released remains to be seen.

The company’s website

*Labyrinth* was an attempt by Jim Henson to utilise the popularity of his *Muppets* franchise to create an fantasy movie which would appeal across all ages. It stars the late David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, with Bowie writing five of the movie’s music tracks while performing four of them. Fortunately, all five of these Bowie tracks appear in the *Labyrinth* pinball game.

These days, although *Labyrinth* is fondly remembered by fans, it predated the fully-immersive special effects seen a few years later, never recouped its production costs and long dropped out of popular culture.

However, it does provide plenty of material on which to base a pinball game.

There is only a single model of *Labyrinth* – the version you see above – although there are some mods, such as a shooter rod or topper, which can be purchased to enhance the game’s appearance.

The right side of the Labyrinth game

As a new company, we should take a look at the basics of the platform first.

*Labyrinth* uses a standard regular-width pinball machine design, with a backbox fronted by a mirrored backglass, while below is a 15.6″ LCD panel, flanked by illuminated speakers. The cabinet and backglass artwork is by Nate Hallinan, however there is an alternative ‘Should You Need Us’ backglass from Johnny Bergeron (a.k.a. Johnny Crap) who also created the playfield artwork. Johnny Crap has previously created artwork for Stern Pinball’s title *Jurassic Park*, including their recently announced 30th Anniversary Edition. Johnny also designed the inner cabinet art blades.

Johnny Crap’s alternative backglass for Labyrinth

Behind that backglass is the [FAST Pinball](https://fastpinball.com/) boardset which interfaces with the playfield devices, lights and switches, while driving the two 5¼” Kenwood backbox speakers and the JBL 8″ subwoofer in the cabinet base, the backbox LCD panel and, unusually, a 14.9″ second LCD which forms the playfield’s back panel.

The back panel LCD screen

Also unusual is the choice of polyester for the cabinet armour. This is powder-coated with metallic flakes to give a premium appearance.

The powder-coated lock bar

Taking a look at that playfield, we find a multitude of sculpted models, some animated, which is no great surprise given the history of one of the company’s founding members in the action model business.

The game features three flippers, three ramps – one metal and two plastic, one of which includes a lift mechanism to reveal a hidden scoop, a magnet diverter, an additional magnet, a ball lock, a controllable drop target, a spinner, two more scoops, a ball diverter, and an up-post.

The playfield for Labyrinth

At the back of the playfield are two door sculpts representing the scene in the movie where the main protagonist is forced to choose which door to enter.

Playfield details

There are four more sculpts which pop-up at appropriate points during the gameplay.

The playfield plastics all have a gold mirrored effect while all the playfield and insert lighting uses RGB LEDs.

Earlier we mentioned the add-on options available for *Labyrinth*. Along with the alternative mirrored backglass, there is also a ‘Nipper’ shooter rod and an animated Goblin topper which includes LED lighting and lit eyes.
