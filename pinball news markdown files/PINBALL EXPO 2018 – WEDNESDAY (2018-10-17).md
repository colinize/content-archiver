**Date:**
17th - 20th October, 2018
**Location:** Westin Chicago North Shore, 601 North Milwaukee Avenue, Wheeling, IL 60090, USA

Wednesday is really set-up day for Pinball Expo, but it is also the day for the Bumper Blast welcome party held at 7pm to mark the official start of the show.

We got to the Westin hotel around 4pm, checked-in and checked-out what was happening in the show halls.

In the vendor hall, things were only just starting to get set up.

Across the corridor, Rob Anthony has his usual room with assorted pinball parts, add-ons and other merchandise.

At 7pm, the Bumper Blast welcome party began in the room used for the seminars.  Guests who had registered and had name badges could help themselves to a buffet meal – sponsored by Deeproot Pinball – before entering the room to sit down and eat it.  In addition to the buffet, there were soft drinks and an apple crisp dessert course.

We left soon after to write this report, pausing on the way to check on how the tournament area was shaping up.  The machines were in place, and Tournament Director, Trent Augenstein was looking relaxed.

That concludes our look at Wednesday’s events.  We’ll be back tomorrow with the first full day of Pinball Expo, which includes the Stern Pinball factory tour, the start of the seminars, and the opening of the Game and Vendor halls.
