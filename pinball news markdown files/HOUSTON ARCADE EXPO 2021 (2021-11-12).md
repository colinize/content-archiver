**Date:** 13th-15th November, 2021
**Location:** Houston Marriott Westchase, 2900 Briarpark Dr. Houston, TX 77042, USA

With international visitors now allowed to travel to the US, we wasted no time and got on the next available flight to get to Houston and make our first visit to the Houston Arcade Expo.

The Houston Marriott Westchase hotel

The show is held at the Houston Marriott Westchase, which is a large business-orientated hotel on the west side of the city.

The complex includes several conference rooms, but it is the Grand Pavilion and the Grand Foyer which are hosting the Houston Arcade Expo this year.

[![The Grand Foyer is at the front on the ground floor, while the Grand Pavilion is behind it](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/002-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/002-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

**Thursday**

We got to the show on Thursday afternoon to check out the set-up ahead of the public opening of the show at midday on Friday and will be updating this report across the whole weekend with all the latest news.

The Grand Foyer will host multiple stands from vendors and individuals. Amongst those with tables allocated are Dirty Donny Gillies and Sam J. Jones (a.k.a. Flash Gordon).

[![The Grand Foyer where many vendors and special guests will have their stands](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/017-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/017-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

[The Game Preserve](https://gamepreservehouston.com/) had a large structure to build and put in place.

[![Getting The Game Preserve's stand set up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/005-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x696.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/005-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Getting The Game Preserve’s stand set up

[![It seems to be finished now](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/004-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/004-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

It’s mostly built but still needs more work

The adjacent [Marco Specialties](https://marcospec.com/) stand was suitable impressive with multiple new [Stern Pinball](https://sternpinball.com/) titles, including many new *[Godzilla](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2021/09/14/godzilla-pinball-revealed/)* machines.

[![Plenty of new Godzilla machines to play](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/006-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x694.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/006-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Incidentally, Pinball News Editor, Martin Ayub, will be interviewed for [MarcoTV](https://www.marcospecialties.com/pinball-parts-blog/houston-livestream-2021/) on Saturday afternoon and you should be able to watch it soon afterwards.

There are plenty of other pinballs already set up, with more constantly arriving.

Further into the hall there are lots of customised machines. Here are a few which caught our eye.

It’s the Houston *Arcade* Expo show, so it’s not all about pinball. There are plenty of classic video games too and multiple console and PC/Mac games too.

The [Space City Open](http://www.arcadecenter.com/index.php/pinball-tournament/) pinball tournament is being held at the show. Run by the [Space City Pinball League](http://www.spacecitypinball.com/), it is hosted in the Richmond Room which is just off the main hotel lobby.

[![This way to the Space City Open](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/007-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x672.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/007-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

**Friday**

The Houston Arcade Expo opened to the public at midday on Friday, although there was still some set-up work taking place in both the Grand Foyer and the Grand Pavilion.

[![Some of the first guests at the show's registration desk](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/019-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/019-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Some of the first guests at the show’s registration desk

At the desk, guests could buy single or multi day passes, as well as T-shirts and posters.

[![T-shirts from this and previous shows were available](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/021-houston-arcade-expo-2021-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/021-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

T-shirts from this and previous shows were available

There were also banners detailing the musical and seminar performances across the three days. With a stage and a DJ desk, there would be plenty of music to accompany the games.

[![Music and seminar schedules](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/020-houston-arcade-expo-2021-718x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/020-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Music and seminar schedules

With vendors selling replica weaponry (and this being Texas), there was another banner detailing the rules to keep everyone at the show safe.

[![Rules of engagement](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/033-houston-arcade-expo-2021-667x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/033-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

The registration desk is located at the entrance to the Grand Foyer which is where many of the vendor stands are located, away from the noise of the arcade machines in the Grand Pavilion.

[![One of the two rows of stands in the Grand Foyer](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/022-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/022-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

‘Dirty’ Donny Gillies had set up his stand near to the entrance.

[![Dirty Donny's was selling prints of his art](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/032-houston-arcade-expo-2021-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/032-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Dirty Donny was selling prints of his very colourful and vivid artworks

It’s a diverse selection of vendor stands at the show – especially in the Grand Foyer – and we’ll take a closer look at what they were selling or promoting a bit later, but let’s go into the main show hall – the Grand Pavilion – to see how that looked at midday on Friday.

[![The Game Preserve had almost completed their setting up](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/023-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/023-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

The Game Preserve had almost completed their setting up

Most of the pinballs are located in a block in front of the stage and loading doors, although there are plenty more scattered throughout the hall.

[![The largest block of pinballs at the show](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/048-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x636.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/048-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Texan hardware manufacturer and game developer, Multimorphic, were also here to showcase some of their latest products on two of their P3 pinball platforms.

[![Multimorphic had two of their P3 platforms, this one featuring the Heist! game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/056-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x682.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/056-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

This Stern *Star Trek* also had a load of mods, but in this case each one had a corresponding QR code so you could get more details and potentially buy them yourself.

The live stream commentary team

One aspect which helps make the Houston Arcade Expo stand out is the schedule of live music across the three days. On Saturday evening there were several musical performances, starting at 6pm with [*The Harp Twins*](https://www.harptwins.com/about) who, true to their name, are twins Camille and Kennerly Kitt who play a selection of popular tracks and their own compositions on their electric harps.

[![The Harp Twins](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/067-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x639.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/067-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

The Harp Twins

Their performance took place in The Rose Room, which is where the show’s seminars and movie screenings are held. *The Harp Twins* are appearing each of the three days of the show, and this first appearance drew a large highly-appreciative crowd.

Later on in the evening, the music shifted to the main stage in the Grand Pavilion where we especially enjoyed [Atari Matt’s](https://www.facebook.com/Atarimatt/) crazy 8-bit music and video displays and [8-Bit Zero’s](https://www.facebook.com/8bit0/) jamming to an electronic backbeat.

Pinball game designer, musician and DJ, Scott Danesi, was also performing a set on the main stage and will be holding a seminar about his game designs in The Rose Room on Saturday at 6pm.

Today’s seminars started with a workshop on live streaming games from Fliptronic. This was follwed by Gerry Stellenberg from Multimorphic explaining how their P3 pinball platform works and its advantages over a traditional single game model.

[![Gerry describes the advantages of the P3 platform](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/089-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x653.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/089-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

The seminar schedule ran all afternoon with talks about video game development and the history of games, followed by a gaming trivia quiz and a cosplay contest.

At 6pm Scott Danesi held a talk about creating your own homebrew pinball. With many of the newest industry game designers coming through that route, homebrew game design is now recognised as the best way into the business.

[![Scott Danesi's seminar](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/090-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x700.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/090-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Scott also talked about the different operating systems and their relative advantages/disadvantages when it comes to creating a pinball game, before taking questions from the audience about how they can create their own game.

After three elimination rounds, the final four were Colin MacAlpine, Robert Byers, Lee Moscaritolo and Jim Mueller.

The final was played on three machines – *Stargate*, *Red & Ted’s Roadshow* and *Jurassic Park*.

Colin achieved first place in the first two games, giving him an unassailable lead going into the third, but with everyone else tied for second it was all to play for.

[![Colin starts the last game of the final, having already won the tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/096-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x713.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/096-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Robert had a commanding lead after the first ball, which he held throughout to win the last game and claim second place overall. Colin took second place on the third game, followed by Jim and Lee who ended up third and fourth respectively overall.

Trophies were presented by Tournament Director, Phil Grimaldi.

The Houston Arcade Expo wrapped up around 2pm with a closing ceremony presented by show organiser Keith Christensen.

[![Houston Arcade Expo organiser, Keith Christensen](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/109-houston-arcade-expo-2021-648x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/109-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Houston Arcade Expo organiser, Keith Christensen

A series of best-in-show awards were then presented for the top arcade, pinball, console, overall best in show and a special award honouring Dan Ferguson, the eclectic collector and curator of the [Lone Star Pinball Museum](http://www.lspinball.com/) who [we were fortunate enough to meet in 2016](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2016/01/03/lone-star-pinball-museum/). Sadly Dan passed away in December of 2019 soon after an organised tour from the Houston Arcade Expo, so this award honours his memory by recognising the selfless work in the coin-op scene by someone in the greater-Houston community.

[![The trophies for the best-in-show awards](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/108-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x813.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/108-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

Next came a draw to find the winner of a multicade cocktail video game. The winner wasn’t present at the show but he will be able to collect his prize at his convenience.

Throughout the show, guests could purchase tickets from the front desk to enter the grand prize draw to win a *The Mandalorian* pinball machine. Tickets cot $25 each or 5 tickets for $100, and entries were placed in a metal drum.

[![Tickets for the pinball machine prize draw could be bought at the front desk](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/117-houston-arcade-expo-2021-1024x729.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/houston-arcade-expo-2021/117-houston-arcade-expo-2021.jpg)

The honour of picking the winning ticket went to this reporter who curiously enough had just played the prize game and set a new Grand Champion score, so could verify it’s a great game to win. After rummaging through the entries one ticket was selected and the owner congratulated on his win.

The Houston Arcade Expo has a unique vibe which sets it apart from the myriad of other pinball shows in the US. This is mainly due to the comprehensive schedule of musical performances, but also due to its roots as a more general gaming show and not a pinball-specific one.

Over the years the pinball element has grown, but overall it probably occupies a minority of the space on the show floor. But then pinball doesn’t exist in a vacuum and influences from alternative genres of amusement, be they coin-op or home-based, tend to converge and provide inspiration for new directions. Having a wide spectrum of game platforms not only appeals to more visitors, they are given the opportunity to step outside their own genre and try others. Guests who attend to play home consoles games, for instance, may well try some of the pinballs or arcade videos and get into those scenes too.

So, that brings our coverage of the Houston Arcade Expo 2021 show to a close.

We end this report with our exclusive Pinball News Thirteen Minute Tour video walkthrough of the Grand Foyer and Grand Pavilion rooms with all the special guests, vendors and games.
