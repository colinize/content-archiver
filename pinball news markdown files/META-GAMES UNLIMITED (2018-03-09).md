Approaching from the east (and US-65 exit) it is located close to the highway overpass and can be entered by making a right-hand turn into the parking lot. Approaching from the west, it is best to turn left at the traffic light on Deeswood/Ingraham Mills (Meeks Lumber Co.) and then make a right turn behind the bank into the rear of the parking lot.

As you enter the building you will be in the retail area. A plethora of games and accessories are for sale in this area, such as *Red Planet*, *Legacy* and *Risk* – to name just a few.
