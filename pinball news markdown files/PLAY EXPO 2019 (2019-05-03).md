**Date:**
4th & 5th May, 2019

**Location:** Manchester Central, Windmill St, Manchester M2 3GX, UK

Welcome to our live coverage of this year’s Play Expo gaming and entertainment show, being held this year back in Manchester in the north of England.

Play Expo has moved around a few times during its relatively short life, starting at the Norbreck Castle hotel in Blackpool before moving to Event City in Manchester, only to return to Blackpool last year and then come back to Manchester for 2019.

The home this year is the former railway terminus now called Manchester Central, also known locally by its previous name of the G-Mex.

Manchester Central Convention Centre

Manchester Central is one large hall with red brick walls and an impressive arched roof.

Inside Manchester Central Convention Centre

Although it is a large venue, the floor space doesn’t compare to that available at Event City in Manchester which was breathtakingly-vast. It is, however, a more modern facility in a more attractive location than the Norbreck Castle in Blackpool which, having experienced once, we would be happy never having to return to.

As in previous years, Play Expo is a mix of assorted gaming platforms and cultures, encompassing retro 8-bit consoles and computers, the latest PC gaming, game, sci-fi and fantasy artwork, board games, cosplay, arcade videos and, of course, pinballs.

Tickets for Play Expo could be purchased in advance through the show’s website or on the door. Adult tickets bought at the venue cost £20 per day, with under-16s paying £14. There was also a family ticket (2 adults and 2 kids) for £58, and weekend-long tickets for £34 (adult) and £24 (kids).

We arrived during the set-up on Friday evening to check on the progress ahead of the public opening on Saturday morning.

The pinball element is organised by the Northern Lights Pinball team who, along with several private collectors, have supplied many of the games, and co-opted other pinball groups and clubs to bring additional machines, amongst them Electric Circus in Birmingham and Flip Out London in Croydon.

The result is an eclectic mix of the most recent releases, modern classics, some electromechanical and early solid-state, and a number of themed groupings.

The Northern Lights Pinball team don’t really hold tournaments, but they will be running a number of single-machine high score competitions across the weekend.

[![The competitions available when the show opens on Saturday](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2019/014-play-expo-2019-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2019/014-play-expo-2019.jpg)

In addition, there will be a raffle or tombola to award prizes and help raise money for the Northern Light Pinball’s chosen charity for 2019, Mustard Tree, helping the homeless and those in poverty.

Before the Play Expo show opened at 10am on Saturday, a sizable crowd had gathered in the foyer of the Manchester Central centre.

The pinball zone was at the back of the hall, at the opposite end to the main entrance. Even so, it was only a matter of seconds before all the pinballs were in use.

The tombola also proved to be very popular, with tickets being sold almost continuously. Any ticket number ending in a 5, 7 or 0 won a prize of some kind. Tickets cost £1 ($1.25, €1.15) for three, £5 for 18 or £10 for 40.

Meanwhile, the three high score competitions were running at the other end of the pinball zone.

[![The tree high score competitions were popular too](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2019/029-play-expo-2019-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2019/029-play-expo-2019.jpg)

The tree high score competitions were popular too

There was a junior competition which was free to enter and was played on *Star Wars*, an EM competition held on a Williams *Heat Wave* which gave two entries for £1, and a modern competition on *Creature from the Black Lagoon* which cost £1 per entry.

[![David records another high score on the white board](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2019/030-play-expo-2019-1024x674.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/play-expo-2019/030-play-expo-2019.jpg)

By the close of the show at 6pm, Andrew Foster’s 1.3bn on *Creature* looked like it would be the top score of the day.

Elsewhere in the hall, there were events running throughout the day.

Many companies were at Play Expo to promote their games or retro bundles, along with a number of hopeful individuals looking for their big break in the business.

Even though it was lunchtime, there was no lull back in the pinball zone.

Sunday was certainly a quieter day at Play Expo, but that’s not to say all the pinball machines weren’t busy all day. As with the rest of the games at the show, be they board games, videos, consoles or 8-bits, the games were all free to play once entry had been purchased.

A new day of high score competitions began, with players having a second bite at winning cash prizes.

We took the opportunity of fewer players and buyers to make our Twenty-Three Minute Tour video walk around the show. Here it is…

With the video shot, a few quick games played and lunchtime looming, we headed for Manchester Picadilly train station and the journey back home.

Play Expo will be back…

Using Manchester Central as a venue had both its advantages and disadvantages. The facilities are good, with a single open, high-roofed hall meaning noise and temperatures were kept under control. The proximity to hundreds to shops, restaurants, bars and hotels also made it the ideal location.

The downside was the reduced floor space, which saw the usual 100+ pinballs cut down to 52, while the cost of entry to the show reflected the undoubtedly more expensive venue hire, with the standard adult day entry rising 25% from £16 to £20 and a family ticket going up 38% from £42 to £58.

For pinball fans, Play Expo is a chance to play many of the latest titles which may not be available locally, along with some older classics and a few unusual games. Really though, the pinball element is more about either reminding the general public how much fun pinball can be, or introducing the next generation of players to the physical game.

The way the machines were played almost continuously across the two days showed there is no shortage of enthusiasm for pinball around Manchester.
