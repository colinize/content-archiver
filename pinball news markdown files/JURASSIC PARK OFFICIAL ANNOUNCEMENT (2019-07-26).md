Following [our reveal](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/07/23/jurassic-park/) of Stern Pinball’s latest title, *Jurassic Park*, earlier this week, today the company made their official announcement about the game, giving more details of the features across all the versions and some high-resolution photographs.

The playfield overview pictures aren’t much better than the ones we brought you earlier, but here they are anyway.

The Premium version’s playfield

The Limited Edition version’s playfield

Curiously, there are no cabinet, backbox or backglass images included in the pictures from Stern which is a shame, as the three models all have distinct art packages created by Jonathan Bergeron (also known as “Johnny Crap”, which is how he signs the translite/backglass artwork). You can see those in [our previous article](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/07/23/jurassic-park/) on the game.

This is a Keith Elwin designed game which is based on the *Jurassic Park* storyline without being a direct movie licence. It doesn’t feature most of the actors or even any footage from the movies, instead using in-house animations to recreate key scenes. It does, though, include music from the movies composed by John Williams plus quotes from Wayne Knight who plays computer expert Dennis Nedry in the first movie and who appears on the playfield above the left inlane.

[![Wayne Knight's Dennis Nedry is the only movie character in the game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/25-pro-playfield-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/25-pro-playfield.jpg)

Wayne Knight’s Dennis Nedry is the only movie character in the game

Nedry was supposedly killed by Raptors in the first movie, but in this reimagining of the storyline is very much alive and continuing to reek chaos on Isla Nublar.

Starting with the Pro model, here are some pictures showing features on the playfield.

The inlanes on either side are covered by large T-Rex plastics, which we imagine will make saving the ball from bouncing down the outlane a little harder. However, this does give the slingshots a little extra depth.

There is also an up-post in the left inlane. This lane activates the Smart Missile when lit, so this presumably holds the ball and gives time for the Smart Missile’s effects to be displayed to the player.

The lower left flipper area on the Pro

There’s no up-post on the right side, but the skinnier Raptor plastic over the inlane looks less obtrusive than T-Rex on the left.

The lower right flipper area on the Pro

Above the right inlane is the helicopter which is a flat plastic on the Pro, but an interactive moving feature on the Premium and LE.

[![The helicopter feature on the Pro](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/27-pro-playfield-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/27-pro-playfield.jpg)

The helicopter feature on the Pro

[![The rotating blades of the helicopter on the Premium/LE](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/42-premium-playfield-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/42-premium-playfield.jpg)

The rotating blades of the helicopter on the Premium/LE

The blades of the helicopter look a little ‘industrial’ in their construction with a nut and bolt added to one of the four blades presumably as a weight to ensure they settle in the same orientation each time.

The biggest differences between the models have to be the way the T-Rex model operates and the Raptor Pen feature.

The T-Rex on the Pro is a static model sitting over the left ramp, but on the higher variants the T-Rex moves, can capture and hold the ball, and then eject it either onto the ramp or throw it across the playfield.

[![The static T-Rex model on the Pro](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/30-pro-playfield-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/30-pro-playfield.jpg)

The movable T-Rex on the Premium and LE

The Premium & LE T-Rex can capture the ball

[![The T-Rex can grab the ball off the ramp and either release it onto the wireform or throw it](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/55-premium-playfield-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/55-premium-playfield.jpg)

The Raptor Pen on the Pro is a static device, featuring three standup targets at the entrance and another behind a one-way gate. When the rear target is shot, the ball escapes into the Control Room lane on the left. The Raptor is depicted on a flat plastic on the Pro.

[![The Raptor Pen feature on the Pro](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/26-pro-playfield-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/26-pro-playfield.jpg)

The Raptor Pen feature on the Pro

The Premium and LE turn the Raptor Pen into a more interesting mechanism. A motorised target bank lowers to allow access to the Pen, while the game’s fourth up-post traps a ball shot inside until the target bank can be raised. The ball is then released to sit behind the bank to act like a newton ball. This is like the Dirty Pool feature of *Attack from Mars*, the Orb lock in *Guardians of the Galaxy*, or the multiball feature in *Breakshot*.

[![The target bank at the front of the Raptor Pen is raised until hit](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/56-premium-playfield-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/56-premium-playfield.jpg)

The bank lowers to allow access to the Pen’s standup targets

[![The ball can be trapped behind the bank until it is hit by another ball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/58-premium-playfield-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/58-premium-playfield.jpg)

The ball can be trapped behind the bank until it is hit by another ball

The Raptor toy is articulated, allowing it to ‘attack’ when the ball hits the rear standup target and keep guard over the locked ball.

One of the other key mechanisms of the game is the rather-generic-looking Jungle Explorer vehicle, and this feature is common to the Pro, Premium and the LE.

The game’s rules require you to travel across the island, visiting different areas, rescuing guests and capturing dinosaurs. You control your movement across the map by changing the direction of the Jungle Explorer by hitting the captive ball below it.

[![The moving Jungle Explorer is common to all versions of the game](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/32-pro-playfield-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/jurassic-park/32-pro-playfield.jpg)

Another fairly minor difference between the versions is appearance of the bumper caps. The Pro has a flat printed top to the bumpers, while the Premium and LE have a more realistic insect in amber appearance.

The feature matrix for Jurassic Park

Here’s how Stern Pinball announced their latest release.

**CHICAGO, July 26, 2019**

Stern Pinball, Inc., a global lifestyle brand based on the iconic and outrageously fun modern American game of pinball, announced today the availability of a new line of pinball machines celebrating the iconic film, *Jurassic Park*. *Jurassic Park* pinball machines will be available in Pro, Premium, and Limited Edition models.

Like the blockbuster movie, the *Jurassic Park* pinball experience generates heart pounding excitement as the player progresses through the game. As the game starts, the player is transported to Isla Nublar, an amusement park where escaped dinosaurs are running amok! The player’s mission is to rescue park staff and recapture dinosaurs from the chaotic environment unleashed by Dennis Nedry’s computer virus. All dinosaurs, however, are not created equal as players will battle Raptors and the mighty T. Rex! The game immerses players in the fun world of battling dinosaurs in an action-packed adventure filled with twists and turns.

The Premium and Limited Edition models feature an amazing animatronic
ball-eating, ball-throwing T. Rex that interacts with the ball and the
player. These models also include an interactive Raptor and Raptor Pen featuring a ball-lock mechanism guarded by a motorized gate. The action does not let up with unique mosquito-in-amber pop bumpers and a custom metal horizontal helicopter spinner.

“*Jurassic Park* is a classic film featuring what everyone loves­­­­­ – dinosaurs! The game is designed to be easy to play, but difficult to master,” said Gary Stern, Chairman and CEO of Stern Pinball, Inc.

The Pro, Premium, and Limited Edition models also feature a Jungle Adventure Vehicle target in the middle of the playfield that is a spinning Newton Ball. This kinetic target registers direct hits, determines the direction players navigate on the island during gameplay, and lights T. Rex modes. All models include three full sized flippers, four custom ramps, a spinning “Spitter” target, in-lane up/down lock post that sets up critical playfield shots and distinctive hand-drawn art highlighting iconic dinosaurs from the series.

The Limited Edition model is limited to 500 units globally. The Limited Edition model includes additional unique features such as a sequentially numbered plaque, an exclusive mirrored backglass, exclusive custom themed cabinet artwork, a custom autographed bottom arch, exclusive custom art blades, anti-reflection pinball glass, and a shaker motor.

Complementing the immersive theme and exciting gameplay experience, Stern Pinball’s powerful SPIKE™ electronics hardware system enables high-definition graphics and innovative animations on the video display. SPIKE™ reduces system complexity and energy usage resulting in enhanced reliability and simplified servicing. The state-of-the-art electronic system also powers a high-fidelity 3-channel audio system that is three times more powerful than audio systems of previous generations.
