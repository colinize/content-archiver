Stern Pinball have today released promotional pictures showing their latest title, *Stranger Things*, designed by Brian Eddy and based on the hit Netflix series.

[![Stern's next title is based on the Netflix series, Stranger Things](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/023-stranger-things-1024x514.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/023-stranger-things.jpg)

Stern’s next title is based on the Netflix series, Stranger Things

As usual, the game is available in three variants – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition, with 500 Limited Edition models available.

The cabinet trim on the Pro and Premium is the same, but the Premium features cabinet and backbox artwork based on season two of the show, compared to the first season for the Pro. The LE’s artwork is based on the creature from Upside Down and it includes purple powder-coated cabinet metalwork as well as upgraded speakers, a shaker motor, cabinet interior artwork and anti-reflective glass.

The Limited Edition model

Turning to the playfield, *Stranger Things* is a two-flippered six-ball fan layout featuring eight main shots. There are left and right ramps, with both having returns into their respective inlanes. There is also a kickout saucer on the centre-left.

The Limited Edition playfield

[![The lower-left part of the Premium playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/151-stranger-things-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/151-stranger-things.jpg)

The lower-left part of the Premium playfield

Working around the playfield, either sidde of the sauder are the first two D-E-M-O-D-O-G stangup targets, while above the saucer is the left entrance to the outer orbit lane which feeds to either the right entrance or the pop bumpers at the top right. The left orbit also features a spinner.

[![The kickout saucer on the left side and the left orbit lane entrance](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/110-stranger-things-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/110-stranger-things.jpg)

The kickout saucer on the left side and the left orbit lane entrance

Then comes the left ramp.

[![The left ramp on the Limited Edition](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/103-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/103-stranger-things.jpg)

The left ramp on the Limited Edition

On the Pro this just traps the ball with an up-post before returning it to the left inlane but on the Premium and LE there is a ramp diverter which feeds a magnet behind the back panel to grab the ball and lock it for Telekinetic Multiball.

[![The ramp diverter rises to send the ball to a magnet behind the back panel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/128-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/128-stranger-things.jpg)

Three balls can be locked here before multiball begins

The main playfield feature is the movie screen in the centre towards the back. This illustrates probably the biggest difference between the Pro model’s playfield and the Premium/LE.

On the Pro, the screen is a large decal depicting the Hawkins Laboratory. The screen is split into three sections, with the central section on a pivot which allows it to fold down to reveal a Demogorgon creature behind.

[![The screen on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/137-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/137-stranger-things.jpg)

The screen on the Pro model

[![The central section of the screen folds down to become a ramp](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/115-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/115-stranger-things.jpg)

The central section of the screen folds down to become a ramp

As well as being a reveal device, the central screen section turns into a ramp which sends the ball up and into the Demogorgon’s mouth.

The ramp is considerably wider than the Demogorgon’s mouth, so it also plays the role of a bash toy unless the shot is sufficiently accurate to send the ball down the creature’s throat.

The big feature of the Premium and LE models is a projector mounted under the bottom arch which projects dynamic artwork onto several sections of the playfield, including the screen.

So while the Pro has a decal on its screen, the Premium and LE have a white screen showing animated clips from the projector.

[![The projector screen on the Premium and LE models](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/106-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/106-stranger-things.jpg)

The projector screen on the Premium and LE models

[![The folded-down screen on the Premium/LE](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/111-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/111-stranger-things.jpg)

The folded-down screen on the Premium/LE

You can also see how the ramps on the Premium/LE playfield feature rather plain-looking decals when compared to the colourful artwork on the Pro. That’s because the projector also illuminates the ramps, along with the Arcade sign over the left ramp entrance and the spinner in the left outer orbit lane.

[![The left ramp on the Premium](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/150-stranger-things-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/150-stranger-things.jpg)

The left ramp on the Premium

The vertical standup targets either side of the two ramps are also rather plain, and they too get washed by the projector to show dynamic artwork.

[![The ramps and vertical standup targets are also lit by the projector](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/129-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/129-stranger-things.jpg)

The ramps and vertical standup targets are also lit by the projector

Now, at this point we should probably point out that the images shown here are somewhat at odds with those seen in an earlier leak of a promo video by Stern.

In that video, the projector effects were shown on a game in a near-dark room where they looked pretty impressive if a little washed-out.

[![The projector beams artwork onto the movie screen, drop targets, standup targets, ramps and spinner](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/009-stranger-things-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/009-stranger-things.jpg)

The screen image in a dark environment

That was presumably optimum lighting conditions for the projector. In the rest of the pictures here, however, the playfield is brightly-illuminated, so we wouldn’t expect the projected images to appear anywhere near as bright.

The screen is raised above the playfield level, allowing space for a set of four drop targets below. On the Premium and LE these drop targets have additional animated artwork from the projector, but on the Pro the artwork comes from fixed decals.

[![The screen on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/137-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/137-stranger-things.jpg)

The screen on the Pro model

There is an inner orbit around the drop targets which can be shot in either direction and, when the drop targets are knocked down, two more D-E-M-O-D-O-G standup targets and a shot under the screen to attack the Demogorgon are revealed.

The individually-controlled drop targets can also rise up to trap a ball behind to create another ball lock for multiball play.

Continuing around the playfield, the right ramp always feeds the ball back into the right inlane following a near-180 degree turn and has two more D-E-M-O-D-O-G targets either side of the entrance.

[![The right ramp shot](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/102-stranger-things-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/102-stranger-things.jpg)

The right ramp shot

[![The right ramp returns to the right inlane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/127-stranger-things-684x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/stranger-things/127-stranger-things.jpg)

The right ramp returns to the right inlane

To the right of the right ramp is the final main shot – the right orbit lane entrance which feeds the pop bumpers or the opposite orbit lane.

There are no shots and just the single and final D-E-M-O-D-O-G target below the right orbit lane entrance as that’s the point where the shooter lane ends, sending the ball across the playfield when it is first launched.

Here are some more shots of the playfield layout from both the Pro and the Premium/LE designs.
