Headquarters is one of the new breed of 'barcade' businesses; a bar combined with an arcade, to provide refreshments and amusements under one roof. Located in  Chicago, Headquarters has been highly successful with the format, but they will soon have even more to offer.

With their latest expansion about to open, Dan Marquardt paid them a visit to find out what they have in store.

Besides the great news of Headquarters adding a large building full of pins, they are also all going to be on free play, just like the video games and pins they have now.
