Pinball will be making an appearance on network breakfast television next week when it features in a segment on the Good Morning America programme.

Timed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the invention of the flipper, the 15 minute feature will air on Friday January 18th between 7am and 9am EST.

Josh and Zach Sharpe will appear with a selection of Stern pinball machines for the show's four anchors to play including Spider-Man, Pirates Of The Caribbean and World Poker Tour.

But apart from supplying games for the studio, Stern have also created a custom Good Morning America pinball machine for the show. Based on the Family Guy design, the machine will have a custom  backglass and game artwork featuring the show's logo and the presenters

Sam Champion, Chris Cuomo, Robin Roberts, and Diane Sawyer. The  regular Family Guy characters of Peter, Brian, Chris, Meg and Lois on the playfield will be exchanged for models of the anchors who will  be invited to show their flipper skills to a national audience.

If you miss the segment, it may subsequently be available to view on the show's website at:          abcnews.go.com/GMA
