The Thunderbirds game was getting a lot of attention even before the show opened

We had a sneak-peek inside Thunderbirds to see how it is put together.  It’s worth noting that this is still only a prototype game so various elements may change before production.

Friday also saw the start of the show’s seminar schedule, beginning at 2pm.  All the seminars were streamed live by GeekGamer.tv and can be viewed live by [clicking here](http://www.nwpinballshow.com/live-stream).

The seminars are held in a dedicated area in the lobby, and the first speakers to take to the stage were David Thiel and Butch Peel who were talking about the making of the Jersey Jack Pinball game *Pirates of the Caribbean*.

David Thiel

David is the freelance composer and sound designer for the game, and he began by explaining how he became involved in the *Pirates of the Caribbean* project.  He said he initially turned down the job, having created the music for the Stern *Pirates* game and knowing how restrictive the licence would be in terms of the minimal assets available and the process of getting Disney to approve everything.

He introduced the team working on the main aspects of the game design before explaining the basic rules and how the multiple music tracks he composed fit with them.  David then looked at one of his wizard mode tracks and broke it down instrument by instrument, showing what each added to the overall mix.

Butch Peel then took over to talk about the development of the Pirates game starting with the game designer’s initial layout.

Butch Peel

He showed how the first playfield was drawn and cut, how the prototype ramps and wireforms are created, how the ball guides (or flatrails) help fine-tune the shots, and then showed all the sculptures used in the game.

Butch showed pictures of all the stages of playfield development, as more inserts and playfield mechanisms are added.

At 3:30pm David Shoemaker and Dave Okert held their seminar about using LEDs to replace incandescent lamps in games.

David Shoemaker

To illustrate the differences between LEDs and lamps, the brought along two Williams *Slugfest* games.  The one on the left used lamps and the one on the right LEDs.

The duo explained the benefits of using LEDs, such as longer life, lower power consumption, less heat generated and the more intense colours which can be produced.  They showed examples of LED replacement devices for general illumination, for use in inserts, for use as flashers, and for use in start buttons and on the coin door.

They revealed which companies they prefer and those they dislike, and advised against the purchase of pre-made kits which are often one person’s preference for which colours should go where.  They suggested always making your own kit instead.

At 5pm, Joe Balcer and Jim Thornton of American Pinball gave the audience their update on the magic of *Houdini*.

Jim Thornton and Joe Balcer of American Pinball

Joe did most of the talking in this seminar and he began by talking about the changes and enhancements made to American Pinball’s Houdini game since it was first shown, including the artwork, lighting, sounds and ruleset.

He described how the rules work, how to complete the secret missions, how the movie modes work and the colour-coding used to identify the features available on the corresponding shots.

Joe Balcer

Joe then showed a video featuring pictures from the factory and the development of *Houdini*.  He said they are currently producing 35 games a week but are running out of room at the factory.  To ease that log jam they have secured a new factory which is three times the size of the current one and plan to move into by the end of 2018 of not sooner.  They need the additional capacity, Joe said, so that when they announce their second title – which they hope to reveal at Pinball Expo in Chicago this October – they will be able to start shipping it within a month or so.

The final seminar for Friday featured two World Champion pinball players facing-off against each other in a series of challenges.

[![Raymond Davidson and Robert Gagno](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2018/179-nwpas-2018-1024x694.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2018/179-nwpas-2018.jpg)

Raymond Davidson and Robert Gagno

Raymond Davidson from the US and Robert Gagno from Canada were set a number of tests to see who would prevail and win the grand prize of $1.

Challenges included completing as many ball control manoeuvres within a time limit and scoring as many points as possible while playing one-handed for two minutes, all while answering questions about their strategy and explaining why they were making particular shots.

The session brought the largest audience of the day to see recent IFPA World Championship winner, Raymond, win the overall contest and claim the prize money.
