The latest exhibit from the Pacific Pinball Museum sees them taking pinball to the heart of local governance, as they set up a selection of machines inside City Hall in their home city of Alameda, California.

Starting tomorrow 28th May, 2013, five  machines from pinball's golden age will be made available for free play for ninety minutes each day from midday until 1:30pm.

The machines are; Fireball - Bally 1971, Gulfstream - Williams 1973, Pro Football - Gottlieb 1973, Capt. Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy - Bally 1975, and Surf Champ - Gottlieb 1976.

The latter machine is in the form of the Visible Pinball Machine - a transparent game with the cabinet, backbox and playfield made out of Perspex to show the inner workings.

In addition, to mark the opening of the exhibit the Museum's Lil' Ju Ju - a converted 1947 Spartan Manor Travel Trailer fitted with five pinballs - will be parked in front of City Hall today and open from 11:30am until 1:30pm, doubling the number of machines available to play for free to ten.

The exhibit at City Hall in Alameda runs until 1st July and is open Monday to Thursday inclusive.
