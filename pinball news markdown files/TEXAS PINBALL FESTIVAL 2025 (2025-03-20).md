**Date:** 21st - 23rd March 2025
**Location:** Embassy Suites Hotel & Conference Center, 7600 John Q Hammons Drive, Frisco, TX, USA

Hello and welcome to our coverage of the 2025 Texas Pinball Festival, held once again at the Frisco Convention Center and at the adjacent Embassy Suites hotel.

The main show hotel for the Texas Pinball Festival

We arrived at the show hotel on Wednesday afternoon. The full Texas Pinball Festival (TPF) doesn’t begin until 4pm on Friday, but we’re here early to preview the show and document how it all comes together.

**WEDNESDAY**

The venue is a combination of the Frisco Conference Center and the Embassy Suites hotel. The hotel is the primary accommodation for show attendees, but the block of rooms allocated to the show sells out in a matter of seconds once they become publicly available at the discounted TPF rate.

The boundary between the Embassy Suites and the Conference Center

Although joined, there is a clear line of demarcation between the hotel and the Conference Center. The hotel is run by the Hilton Group, whereas the Conference Center is run by the City of Frisco.

Much of the show effort goes into the planning which stretches back from today for several months. Although the venue only comes together a day or two before the doors open to the public, much of the planning has been taking place ever since the previous year’s show closed.

There were other events in the main hall and the side rooms earlier on Wednesday, meaning the TPF organisers and vendors could only start bringing in their wares later in the day.

[![An early look into the main TPF hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/003-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x607.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/003-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

An early look into the main TPF hall

Some banners and a few pinball machine boxes from American Pinball and Euro Pinball Corp were on the show floor by 5pm, but nothing else.

[![The few pinballs brought into the hall so far](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/004-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x633.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/004-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

The few pinballs brought into the hall so far

The main part of the hall remained largely empty so far.

Looking into the main part of the show hall

Outside the main show doors, the corridors were eerily quiet, while some action took place inside the ticket office.

On the corridor back to the hotel, there is a small staircase leading to an upper level where the tournaments have been held in previous years.

[![This way to the tournaments](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/008-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/008-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

This way to the tournaments

We returned to the show floor around 11pm to check on progress.

Show organiser Paul McKinney was busy measuring and taping the floor to mark out the boundaries of each booth.

[![Taping the floor to show each booth's boundary](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/009-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/009-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Taping the floor to show each booth’s boundary

He was working from the overall floor plan for this year’s show.

The floor plan for the 2025 TPF

Some vendors were setting up their stands already. Marco Specialties has a large area to show ten new Dungeons & Dragons: The Tyrant’s Eye machines along with a bunch of other recent titles.

[![Building the Marco Specialties stand](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/010-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/010-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Nitro Pinball had some machines set up, including *The Blues Brothers* and *Evil Dead*.

[![The Blues Brothers from Homepin and Evil Dead from Spooky](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/011-texas-pinball-festival-2025-601x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/011-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Mayfair Amusements also had some of their spares in the hall, along with wooden batons to build their backglass display racking.

Work carries on into the night to continue preparing the Conference Center’s main hall for this year’s Texas Pinball Festival.

**THURSDAY**

By Thursday morning nothing much in the hall had visibly changed, but that soon began to change as machines and vendor stands started to arrive.

[![Inside the main hall on Thursday](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/100-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/100-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

**FRIDAY**

By Friday morning, the show was really starting to take shape.

[![The show banners hung in the corridors and lobby area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/229-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/229-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

The show floor on Friday morning

The show opens to the general public at 4pm today, but a limited number of special VIP passes were also available which allowed access from midday. So, the pressure was on to get the show floor completed in the remaining few hours.

[![Spooky Pinball had a number of Evil Dead machines along with many of their earlier titles](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/213-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x696.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/213-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

To everyone’s surprise, Jack not only confirmed the rumour that their next title is based on the Harry Potter movies, but said they had access to all seven movies and all the assets were available to use. He said it had taken ten years of negotiation to secure the licence.

Mark then took over.

**SATURDAY**

Saturday traditionally begins with the swap meet, located in the car park right outside the Conference Center and organised by the DFW Pinball & Arcade Club.

[![Saturday's swap meet](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/303-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x582.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/303-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Saturday’s swap meet

After several years with an official 8am start time, last year’s move to a 6am start continued for 2025. Even with that 6am start, several people told us if you wanted the best deals you needed to be there for 5am.

We didn’t make either of those times, but waited until 7am to check out the items still available.

[![An overview of the swap meet](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/300-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/300-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Martin and Jonathan returned for another edition of their popular pinball trivia quiz. They had four tables piled with prizes donated by generous sponsors to give away to those audience members who could string together a few correct answers to their pinball-related questions. By the end, they had given away almost all the prizes, and given consolation prizes to those who hadn’t yet won anything.

**6pm – How To: Run A Pinball Location – Imoto Harney, Matthew Tally, Brian Haskell, Nic Schell & Phil Forrester**

Matthew, Brian, Nic & Phil

In this seminar, the panel explored the potential pitfalls when opening a pinball location and how to avoid them. They also looked at maintenance issues, how to price games to avoid alienating players, rotating games and how much revenue a machine needs to make to earn its keep.

**7pm – Spooky Pinball – Cary Hardy, Hilton Jones, Spooky Luke, Bug Emery, Christopher Franchi, Ben Heck**

[![Hilton, Luke, Bug, Chris, Ben & Cary](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/316-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x508.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/316-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

In this seminar, the Spooky Pinball team talked about the development of their *Evil Dead* pinball, from first getting the licence to securing the voice talent, creating the art package and designing the playfield. They were also able to announce they had fully sold out of all the 888 units they said was the maximum number they would be producing.

**8pm – Stern Pinball: Dungeons & Dragons – Brian Eddy & Dwight Sullivan**

[![Brian and Dwight](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/318-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x660.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/318-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Brian and Dwight

Brian and Dwight spoke about their latest collaboration, Stern Pinball’s current title, *Dungeons & Dragons: They Tyrant’s Eye*. Brian showed the development of the playfield design, from a very basic layout to adding in the dragon, which was initially positioned under a ramp. Dwight then explained his take on the theme, the elements brought in from the board game and the large number of possible paths through the ruleset.

The number of vendors meant there were even more stands in the corridor outside the main hall. So, let’s begin our coverage of the sellers there…

Finally for Saturday, here is our Forty Minute Tour video walk through the entire show area, including the main hall, corridors, seminars and tournaments.

VIDEO

**SUNDAY**

The final day of the Texas Pinball Festival is a shorter one, with the main show hall opening at 9am and closing at 2pm.

The finals of the main tournament also take place on Sunday.

We mentioned the tournaments area a little earlier and showed you around in our video above, but we haven’t included any details yet. There were several tournaments, with the main being the Texas Wizards.

In the Texas Wizards A Division, the final four were Jack Revnew, Nick Mueller, Garrett Shahan and Preston Moncla. They played a three game final on *Flash Gordon*, *F-14 Tomcat* and *Rush* with 4-2-1-0 scoring.

Garrett won on *Flash Gordon* with Preston second. Preston won on *F-14* with Nick second. That meant, going into the last game, Preston led with 6 points, Garrett was on 4 points, with Jack and Nick on 2 points each.

On *Rush*, after disappointing first balls from all four, Jack put together a decent second to lead going into everyone’s final ball. His third ball was even better, giving him the win on Rush and 6 points overall. If Preston ended fourth and Garrett second or lower, there could be a 3-way playoff on 6 points.

It looked possible going into Preston’s third ball, with Jack leading, Garret second and Nick third. However, Preston had a decent third ball, starting multiball and ending in second place on Rush to win overall with 8 points.

In the women’s Texas Takedown tournament, the final four were Ariel Dutton, Dawnda Durbin, Mandy Peel and Kelly Moncla.

Dawnda won on the first game, *Volley*, with Ariel second, Mandy third and Kelly fourth.

Game two, Attila The Hun, suffered a technical issue with the flippers, so standby game, *High Speed 2: The Getaway*, was used instead. This proved to be a welcome substitution for Mandy who won, with Kelly second, Ariel third and Dawnda fourth.

Going into the final game on *The Walking Dead* it was wide open, with Mandy on 5 points, Dawnda on 4 points, Ariel on 3 points and Kelly on 2 points.

Nobody got a good first ball, but Dawnda managed to get a decent second to hold a modest lead going into ball three.

Ariel looked like she might challenge, but Dawnda’s prison multiball and blood bath gave her an unassailable lead. Mandy ended second overall and, after a playoff on Jaws, Ariel was third and Kelly fourth.

With the Best-in-Show awards presented, the only thing remaining was the draw for the raffle prize.

Each year the Texas Pinball Festival raffles a brand new pinball machine with proceeds going to support the [National Videogame Museum](http://nvmusa.org/). This year it was a Stern Pinball *The Uncanny X-Men* Pro, with entry tickets available to purchase at the show registration and merchandise desk. All tickets went into a drum which was brought into the Seminars Room.

The winning ticker holder needed to be present in the room to receive their prize and, fortunately, that winner wasn’t very far away.

With the raffle prize awarded, this year’s Texas Pinball Festival really was over. Out in the main hall, disassembly of machines and stands was already well underway.

[![Time to load up the machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/346-texas-pinball-festival-2025-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2025/346-texas-pinball-festival-2025.jpg)

Those eagle-eyed visitors might have noticed that the reverse of the banners hanging in the corridor displayed the dates for the 2026 show.
