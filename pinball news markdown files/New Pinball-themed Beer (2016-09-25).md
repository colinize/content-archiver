Report by Dan Marquardt

Two Brothers Artisan Brewing in Warrenville, Illinois, just launched their   new pinball-themed craft beer called Pinball Juicy Hop Pale Ale.

Of   course, everyone knows drinking beer goes great with playing pinball, so I   am reporting on what may be the first official pinball machine themed   beer. The graphics on the can feature flippers, pop bumpers and pinballs.

The beer is light-bodied and highly-hopped. It has a tropical and citrus   fruit flavor, hoppy and sweet. The alcohol content is 5.4% by volume.

The Pinball Pale Ale is available at the Two Brothers' three locations in   the Western suburbs of Chicago and at their location in Arizona. The beer   is also sold in cans in stores in about a dozen states. Check their   website at twobrothersbrewing.com to find out where it is available.

Time to get lit

Fans of pinball machines and hoppy, sweet craft beers should give this new beer a taste.
