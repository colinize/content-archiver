After teasing their latest release last week, Jersey Jack Pinball today officially unveiled their new *The Godfather 50th Anniversary* game.

*The Godfather* has two variants; the top-end Collector’s Edition which is limited to 1,000 units and costs $15,000, and the Limited Edition which will have a maximum of 5,000 games produced at a price of $12,000.

Both feature a rich red and gold art package. The Collector’s Edition focuses on Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), while the the Limited Edition is more about Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).

The Collector’s Edition includes an animated topper, laser-cut gold side rails, magnetic lion bust sculptures on the front legs and around the action button, a gold lock bar, burgundy legs and backbox hinges, and a horse’s head shooter rod. The cabinet artwork is printed on JJP’s Rad-Cals, their extra glossy decals.

The topper on the Collector’s Edition features two animated thugs wielding tommy guns behind crates and barrels who rotate and fire, with an extra knocker solenoid in the backbox to synchronise with the gun shots.

The topper on the Collector’s Edition

The car is a hand-painted sculpt with its own headlights illumination, while the whole topper includes more than thirty dedicated RGB LEDs.

As usual, the backbox contains a 27-inch HD monitor, which in the Collector’s Edition is framed in a gold mirror-effect backglass.

The CE also includes exterior cabinet lighting using more than 260 RGB LEDs as well as interior cabinet art blades

The Limited Edition forsakes many of the cosmetic enhancements of the Collector’s Edition such as the topper, mouldings and gold trim, but offers a similar art package and colour scheme.

Like the CE model, the LE’s backglass image is by Christopher Franchi. However, the LE version doesn’t appear to be mirrored in the same way. Curiously, the CE edition has a copyright date of 2022, while the LE is dated 2023.

The backglass from the Limited Edition of The Godfather

Both models include a shaker motor, Invisglass anti-reflective glass and an individually-numbered plaque, as well as standard JJP features such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity as well as Scorbit integration and a player high-score camera built into the backbox.

So, what’s on the playfield? A huge amount.

As you would expect from game designer, Eric Meunier, there are masses of shot options from the three flippers, with some unusual new mechanisms and familiar devices used in unusual ways.

The Collector’s Edition playfield

The game features three ramp entrances with the left-most ramp having a moving entrance to allow shots beneath. The ramps also appear to be shootable in either direction. As with many of the playfield features though, their operation will only become clear once we see some gameplay.

The player-controlled bad guy bash toy at the top of the playfield rotates and has an illuminated gun muzzle.

Beneath him is a spinning disc which cannons the ball into the bad guy’s pivot to score hits on him.

While the bad guy is “Big Mike” on the Collector’s Edition’s playfield, the character changes to “Furious Floyd” on the Limited Edition’s.

The Limited Edition’s playfield

Both editions have similar playfields and include RGB LED HotRails lighting strips down both sides and a Bad Guy ‘Health Meter’ at the bottom left. There are a few more differences though. The CE includes a sculpted model of the Statue of Liberty with an RGB illuminated torch at the top-left of the playfield, whereas the LE has a flat plastic instead.

The back of both models has a laser-cut skyline of New York in front of the back panel.

The Collector’s Edition and Limited Edition playfields

There are several discrete areas of the playfield dedicated to specific rules features.

A key objective of the storyline is to take over each of the boroughs of New York. These are represented by an illuminated map which lights up as you progress.

[![The Ney York map](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/116-godfather-1024x737.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/116-godfather.jpg)

The Ney York map

There are assorted modes and features you can start along your journey, including four multiball modes (5 Families, Compound, Turf War, Sicily). These are shown with red inserts on a ‘rose’ progress window.

[![The rose progress wheel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/111-godfather-1024x705.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/111-godfather.jpg)

The rose progress window

You can also shoot the game’s two optical spinners to build up a playfield multiplier to be deployed with the action button at the appropriate time to maximise scoring. Each level earns a new weapon and advances the multiplier from 1.5x all the way up to a maximum of 10x.

[![The playfield multiplier feature](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/115-godfather-1024x666.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/115-godfather.jpg)

The playfield multiplier feature

There are curious design features all over the playfield. There are multiple skill shot options, for instance. In fact, according to JJP, there are 2 regular (seen below), 10 super, 1 hidden skill shots in the game.

[![The Compound ball lock area with several skill shot options from the shooter lane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/117-godfather-588x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/117-godfather.jpg)

The Compound ball lock area with several skill shot options from the shooter lane

There is only room for one pop bumper, but it is designed like a fountain and positioned on the lower-mid right with a target in front, a lane around it including three 1-2-3 standup targets.

[![The fountain pop bumper](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/309-godfather-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/309-godfather.jpg)

The fountain pop bumper

There is another lane behind which looks as though it can only be made with a kick from the bumper.

[![The game's sole pop bumper and associated shots](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/113-godfather-865x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/113-godfather.jpg)

The game’s sole pop bumper and associated shots

There’s also a drop target guarding an exit back into the shooter lane called L’Hai Scampata (which translates to ‘lucky escape’ or ‘you dodged a bullet’).

Jersey Jack Pinball claim there are twenty-nine individual shots on the game. With so many options and accompany rules available, there are quite a few instructions printed on the playfield or on plastics to help explain how various features work.

It’s pretty packed under the playfield too, with a subway system featuring three entrances. There’s also a grab magnet at the top of the left orbit lane to drop the ball into one of the entrances.

[![The animating, shooting bad guy bash toy](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/118-godfather-1024x587.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/118-godfather.jpg)

A little further down is a feature seen recently in Stern’s *Foo Fighters* game – a standup target in the inlane. This one is a little different though as it is hit by a ball coming down the long left ramp ball return wireform which runs nearly the full length of the playfield.

[![The standup target in the right inlane](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/114-godfather-1024x712.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/godfather/114-godfather.jpg)

The standup target in the right inlane

*The Godfather* is able to draw from assets from all three movies and includes two different versions of the main theme (Speak Softly Love). One is an instrumental performed by Slash while the other is a vocal version sung by Mark Tremonti of *Creed* and *Alter Bridge* fame.

There are flyers for both models of the game plus a joint version which list the many features included. Here they are. As with all the images in this report, click on any of them for a larger version.
