They tried it before with Classic versions of Batman and Iron Man without much success, but now Stern Pinball Inc have brought out a new home version of their Transformers model in time for the holiday season.

The new model is dubbed the Transformers Pin and this time they have gone further in cutting features, taking out the dot matrix display completely and replacing it with two 8-digit LED displays, thus limiting play to just two players at a time.

A single speaker and cut-down backbox complete the upper part of the machine, while at the bottom four height-adjustable legs are bolted into the inside of the cabinet.

The playfield has also redesigned but retains a few features of the commercial models including the same flippers, slingshots, pop bumpers and plunger, plus tempered glass covering the playfield.

The All-Spark Cube has moved to the centre of the playfield and become a spinning toy like the genie lamp on Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Playfield detail

There is a spinner and what appears to be a drop target in front of the entrance to the right ramp. The left ramp entrance is now a vertical 180° curve while the whole playfield is lit with LEDs.

The game weighs in at 120 pounds and is somewhat smaller than one of the commercial models at 21.5" wide (vs 27"), 43" long (vs 55") and 64" high (vs 75.5"). That makes it around 20% smaller in each dimension occupying about half the overall volume of the full-scale machine.

The Transformers Pin's price is not cut by the same amount though. Its list price is $3,999.99, although it is available through Amazon (who have the exclusive rights to sell in the US for the remainder of the year) for a $1,000 discount at $2999.99 including shipping.

In Canada, the Transformers Pin will be available exclusively through Starburst Coin/The Playdium Store, although prices there haven't been announced yet.

Stern put out a press release about the new Transformers Pin model, which they say is part of the Stern Home Arcade brand, suggesting Transformers Pin may be the start of a new series aimed at home game buyers.
