Stern Pinball have revealed their second ‘cornerstone’ game of 2025 with the unveiling of *King Kong: Myth of Terror Island*.

Unlike some of Stern’s earlier titles, this game has been widely rumoured as the next design from Keith Elwin. The ‘*Myth of Terror Island*‘ sub-title appears to be a Stern creation and not based on any previous King Kong licence. The public domain status of the King Kong character gives the Stern team creative freedom to craft their own storyline and assets.

So, game design is by Keith Elwin. Artwork is an unusual collaboration between Stern’s new Studio Art Director, Jeremy Packer (a.k.a. Zombie Yeti), legendary pinball artist Kevin O’Connor and Stern’s previous Art Director, Greg Freres. Music and Sound Design is by Jerry Thompson together with custom speech by Brian ‘Q’ Quinn, while the Software Designer is Rick Naegele, with Mechanical Design by Harrison Drake.

As usual with the ‘cornerstone’ titles from Stern, there are three variants of *King Kong* – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition. They are priced at:

* Pro: $6,999
* Premium: $9,699
* Limited Edition: $12,999

The Limited Edition model has all the bells and whistles, both on the playfield and cosmetically. The Premium usually drops many of the cosmetic additions but keeps the same playfield, while the Pro takes some of the features off the playfield too.

Let’s start with the basic Pro model, before looking at the top-end Limited Edition and finally the in-between Premium.

**PRO**

The Pro model features the familiar black speckled-finish side rails, lock bar and other metalwork. The backbox uses a translite for the model-specific artwork.

Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models

And so to the playfield and this time we’ll start with the Limited Edition model to see all the element intended by the designer before some were cost-reduced for the Pro model.

**LIMITED EDITION**

[![The Limited Edition's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/310-king-kong-596x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/310-king-kong-scaled.jpg)

The Limited Edition’s playfield

This four-flippered game has an unusual left outlane arrangement. A zig-zag ball return leads to an outer lane which curves to feed the inlane ball return through a one-way gate, like many ’80s Bally titles. Like those, the inner lane is actually the drain, however a Log Bridge diverter can be activated to feed that lane back to the flipper too.

[![The left inlane/outlane area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/320-king-kong-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/320-king-kong.jpg)

The left inlane/outlane area

The headline toy in the Limited Edition and Premium model has to be King Kong himself. That means an animatronic toy which turns and raises his fists, smashing them down to derail a train. The train is a ball lock which, when upended, spills the balls onto the playfield to start multiball.

Shoots to the gong mech are used to summon Kong and start island modes.

Bashing the gong, when lit, adds letters to the K-I-N-G-K-O-N-G inserts across the playfield.

Over on the left side is a bank of four drop targets which reveal a standup treasure target behind.

Below and to the left of the target bank is The Pit, and electromagnet with an animated Giant Spider sculpt mounted above.

There are two spinners in the game. One in the left orbit lane and the other in the centre lane.

**PRO**

The Pro model’s playfield

To reduce costs, the Pro model eschews several of the mechanisms and sculpts found in the Premium and Limited Edition models.

The animated King Kong character in the top-right becomes a static model in the Pro.

[![The Kong model in the Pro is static](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/112-king-kong-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/112-king-kong.jpg)

The Kong model in the Pro is static

Without arms to crush the train, it comes pre-crushed as a flat plastic piece of artwork.

[![The pre-crushed train](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/113-king-kong-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/113-king-kong.jpg)

The pre-crushed train

The lack of a train lock makes the ball locks virtual in the Pro model.

[![Virtual ball locks rather than physical ones](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/116-king-kong-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/116-king-kong.jpg)

Virtual ball locks rather than physical ones

The biplane model is substituted for a cheaper version built from flat plastic pieces.

The biplane in the Pro model

Rather then using a cheaper model, the Giant Spider model has been removed completely in the Pro edition. The magnet in The Pit does remain, however.

[![No Giant Spider](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/115-king-kong-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/115-king-kong.jpg)

No Giant Spider

Also removed is the temple sculpt and the swinging gong. These are replaced by more… yes, flat plastics.

![The gong has gone](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/114-king-kong-1024x683.jpg)

The gong has gone

However, the two spinners do remain in the Pro.

[![The Pro playfield still features two spinners](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/118-king-kong-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/king-kong/118-king-kong.jpg)

The Pro and Limited Edition playfields

So, the main changes with the Pro playfield are the removal of the custom sculpted pieces and the animation of the King Kong character.

Here’s the feature matrix comparing what’s in each of the three models.
