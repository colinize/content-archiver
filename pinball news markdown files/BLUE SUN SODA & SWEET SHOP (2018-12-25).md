What does every good little (or big) boy and girl want for Christmas more than a fun afternoon out? Why, all the soda pop and sweets they can eat, of course! How about over one-thousand flavors of soda, along with candy from around the entire world? It’s enough sugary goodness to keep one in the holiday spirit all year long!

[![Can't keep track of over 1,000 flavors? That's OK, BSSSS has you covered](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/01-bssss-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/01-bssss.jpg)

Can’t keep track of over 1,000 flavors? That’s OK, BSSSS has you covered

Blue Sun Soda & Sweet Shop on County Highway 10

OK, maybe we still need to come down from our sugar rush, and get to telling you why [your favorite online news source](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/) is reporting on a sweets shoppe. But, first one more hit of delicious *Whistler* soda. That’s right, we brought some home. And candy too.

We have barely mentioned the candy. From unique to classic, they have it all!

[![This isn't even all the candy](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/05-bssss-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/05-bssss.jpg)

This isn’t even all the candy

They have an entire “Wall of Pez”. Have you ever seen a flippen wall of Pez?

[![All the Pez that is the Pez that's fit to Pez!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/06-bssss-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/06-bssss.jpg)

All the Pez that is the Pez that’s fit to Pez!

Did we write “flippen”? Is that bad? Do we have to put money in the swear jar?

[![Luckily for me, use of the swear jar is not mandatory](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/07-bssss-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/07-bssss.jpg)

Luckily for us, use of the swear jar is not mandatory

Oh yea . . . flippen . . . as in pinball; the reason you are probably reading this article.

But did we tell you about the fireworks?

[![Fireworks and candy and pop, oh my!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/08-bssss-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/08-bssss.jpg)

Fireworks and candy and pop, oh my!

We can’t forget about the duck and snail big enough to ride.

[![Duck and snail, plus there's and elephant around here somewhere](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/10-bssss.png-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/10-bssss.png.jpg)

Duck and snail, plus there’s and elephant around here somewhere

An elephant never forgets. And we won’t forget to tell you about the pinball [tie-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-in).

But look at all . . . that . . . candy.

[![Candy, candy, candy!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/11-bssss.png-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/11-bssss.png.jpg)

Candy, candy, candy!

We swore we weren’t going to forget to tell you something. But what was it? Maybe another soda to refresh our memory.

Speaking of soda. Look at all that pop!

[![Soda, soda, soda! Soo many flavors, so little bladder](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/12-bssss.png-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/12-bssss.png.jpg)

Soda, soda, soda! Soo many flavors, so little bladder

Now, what was it and where was it? Ah yes, the carbonation has invigorated our memory. There is an entire room of…

[![Pinball, pinball, pinball!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/13-bssss.png-1024x768.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/13-bssss.png.jpg)

Pinball, pinball, pinball!

And yet another five more pinball games on the right side

The pinball games proved more popular than the other games.

[![At just a quarter per game, these guys could use their miserly allowance to play many games](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/17-bssss.png-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/17-bssss.png.jpg)

At just a quarter per game, these guys could use their miserly allowance to play many games

In fact, several did play many pinball games. Like a holiday stocking hung on the mantel with care, the change machine even had to be stuffed while we visited.

The purpose of our trip to the [Blue Sun Soda & Sweet Shop](http://bluesunsodashop.com/) was mainly to get a case of soda for this year’s soon-upcoming holiday’s festivities.

But we will be back to [Blue Sun](https://www.facebook.com/bluesunsodashop/) to play their eclectic collection of older and newer pinball machines in the near future. And, of course, to enjoy more of the world’s most flavorful soda – and try other flavors too.

[![The entire store is cleverly decorated with such paraphernalia - maybe next time we can slow down and enjoy all the details rather than gulp it all in?](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/19-bssss.png-943x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/sites/bssss/19-bssss.png.jpg)
