Pedretti Gaming, Team Pinball, FAST Pinball, PinSound and Planetary Pinball Supply have worked together to develop the *Funhouse: Rudy’s Nightmare* kit which comes with a new FAST Pinball WPC-89 replacement CPU board, a new PinSound sound board with all the audio content, a replacement Mystery Mirror which contains an LCD display to show dynamic content, a complete new speaker panel with a full-colour 14-inch LCD display and a new speaker system, a new translite and interior cabinet artwork decals.

The kit adds lots of new content to the game with a whole new ruleset, although the game’s software also let’s you switch back to play the classic *Funhouse* rules and score display if that’s required.

The new Funhouse: Rudy’s Nightmare game kit

Pedretti Gaming were not universally known until recently when they began manufacturing Pinball Brother’s *Alien* pinball games, but they are a partner with Planetary Pinball Supply (PPS) for the production of licensed reproduction Williams pinball parts which they have been manufacturing for several years. Two years ago Pedretti and PPS reached an agreement to produce a series of ‘2.0’ conversion kits for existing Williams/Bally titles, with this Funhouse kit the first to be announced.

The Funhouse: Rudy’s Nightmare kit

Installing the *Rudy’s Nightmare* kit involves no permanent modification to the *Funhouse* game other than unplugging and removing the Mystery Mirror, display panel, CPU board and sound board, replacing them with the new equivalents in the kit along with the translite. All the new software and sounds are included, along with the original versions. All the original parts can always be returned to the game if it is being sold.
