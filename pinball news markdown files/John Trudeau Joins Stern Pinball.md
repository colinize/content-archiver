Following hot on the heels of Greg Freres and Tanio Klyce, Stern Pinball has made yet another addition to their design team with the hiring of  game designer John Trudeau.

John - famed for designing such classic games as Creature from the Black Lagoon, Judge Dredd and The Machine: Bride of Pinbot - has created over 60 pinball games during his career which has spanned more than 30 years. He began with Game Plan in 1981, and was most recently designing an upcoming game for new pinball start-up Heighway Pinball in the UK. He was waiting to complete that project before taking up his new position.

Now John joins George Gomez, John Borg, Steve Ritchie and Greg Freres in the game designers team at Stern Pinball. His first day at the factory was Monday, 6th May and the company posted this picture of him in his somewhat spartan office.
