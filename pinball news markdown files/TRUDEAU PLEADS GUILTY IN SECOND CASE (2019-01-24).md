Last week, former game designer John Trudeau [pleaded guilty](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2019/01/17/john-trudeau-pleads-guilty/) on the stipulation of facts to two charges of possession of child pornography.

He was sentenced to three years imprisonment, with credit for time served of 246 days.

The following day he was back in court for five potentially much more serious charges – Predatory Criminal Sexual Assault, two charges of Criminal Sexual Assault where the victim was aged 13-17, Aggrivated Criminal Sexual Abuse of a victim aged 13-16 and Aggrivated Criminal Sexual Abuse of a family member.

The five charges related to his supervision of a family member back in 1993 and 1995, and spanned a seven-year period. He was first charged on 16th May, 2016 and pleaded not guilty at a hearing on 27th June.

The severity of those charges meant his bail was set at $200,000 and Trudeau was held in jail until the more serious cases could be heard or a plea deal negotiated.

At a court hearing on 18th January, 2019, Trudeau pleaded guilty to the most minor charge of Aggrivated Criminal Sexual Abuse of a family member.

He recieved a sentence of three years imprisonment minus time already served of 248 days. He will also have to pay fines and costs of $3,185, plus $950 for DNA analysis and sex offender registration.

In the remaining four other charges were dropped. No further charges are currently pending.

The results of the five charges

If he earns the full 50% sentence discount while inprisoned, we calculate Trudeau can expect to be released in mid-March 2020, when he will be aged 72.
