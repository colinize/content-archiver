**Date:**
15th-17th September, 2017

**Location:**
Hall of Pinball-Fame, Badendorf 12,
8413 Badendorf, Austria

To find the Hall of Pinball-Fame you drive south from Vienna for about two hours until you reach the city of Graz.  Then go a little further, out into the countryside, to the village of Badendorf.  There, set on the side of a hill is a small industrial park which mainly seems to be concerned with making cement objects, and right at the entrance is an anonymous-looking three-storey building which is secretly the home to an impressive collection of modern pinballs.

The home of the Hall of Pinball-Fame in Badendorf

If you didn’t know that this was the home of the Austrian Pinball Open, there was one small clue to be found.

[![We've found the right place](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/16-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/16-apo-2017.jpg)

We’ve found the right place

We arrived late Friday night with the main and side tournaments starting on Saturday morning.  We wanted to arrive earlier on Friday so that we could play in the warm-up tournament which is held on Friday evening, but a mix of distant airport gates, a small quantity of beer and an unexplained gap of thirty minutes in our lives led to us missing the intended flight and having to catch a later one.

By the time we arrived soon after midnight, the final of the Warm-Up Tournament was about to begin.  It used a three-strikes Matchplay format where players were randomly paired up for head-to-head games on random machines.  Getting a win meant you carried on, but losing the game gave you a strike.  Once you get three strikes you are out of the tournament. The tournament continued until there were just two players remaining.  They then played in the final.

The final stages of the Warm-Up Tournament

The final of the Warm-Up Tournament was held on Twilight Zone between Jasmin Ibric and Johannes Ostermeier.

Playing in the final of the Warm-Up Tournament

The machine was clearly playing tough, and the final game didn’t last too long.  Johannes just set a three-ball score of 122M as player one, and Jasmin went into the very last ball just over 50M behind on 71M.

That last ball couldn’t manage to stay out of the drain for long, giving Jasmin little opportunity to catch Johannes’ score.  So Johannes won and Jasmin was second. Benjamin Gräbeldinger and Sandor Varga tied for third place.

After the presentation of the trophies, it was time to unbox one of the special games at the event – a production Alien machine from *Heighway Pinball*, supplied by Stefan Riedler’s [RS Pinball](http://www.rs-pinball.at/).  It joined a *Star Wars* Limited Edition which had been set up in the hall earlier that evening.

[![The Alien LE machine is unboxed](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/06-apo-2017-648x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/06-apo-2017.jpg)

Under the Alien playfield

Although the tournament was over and the games set up for Saturday the night didn’t end there, with partying, drinks and more pinball playing until the early hours.  We left some time around 3:30am.

Despite forecasts of a hot, sunny weekend, we awoke to rain, low cloud and a chill in the air at our guest house on the other side of Badendorf.  The persistent drizzle mixed with heavy showers meant we wouldn’t be walking to the Hall of Pinball-Fame as we’d hoped.

[![Another wet day in the Austrian hills](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/65-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/65-apo-2017.jpg)

Another wet day in the Austrian hills

Inside the hall players were gathering for the start of the qualifying rounds in the two tournaments.

[![Players assemble for the start of the tournaments](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/10-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/10-apo-2017.jpg)

Players assemble for the start of the tournaments

[![Players' names are checked-off as they register](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/12-apo-2017-1024x695.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/12-apo-2017.jpg)

Players’ names are checked-off as they register

Before we get into the tournaments, let’s have a look around the building.  The main hall was on the ground floor and it contained the majority of the games as well as a seating area and the bar.

[![The bar in the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/13-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/13-apo-2017.jpg)

The bar in the main hall

*Murauer* was the beer of choice for many, but the bar sold two other beers as well as plenty of soft drinks, coffee and snacks.  Prices were quite reasonable.  A 500ml bottle of beer was €2.70 ($3.16/£2.42), coffee was €1.50, while a coke would set you back €1.50.  A small hot dog could be bought for €2.50.

[![The apricot cake looked very appealing](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/11-apo-2017-721x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/11-apo-2017.jpg)

The apricot cake looked very appealing

If you didn’t fancy sitting at the bar, bench seating and tables could be found towards the back of the hall on the left hand side.  On the left were the older ‘classics’ machines which were used in their own tournament two years ago but were included in the general mix of tournament games this time.

[![Tables and bench seats on the left side of the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/17-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/17-apo-2017.jpg)

Tables and bench seats on the left side of the main hall

On the other side of the seating area was another mixed row of electronic pinballs.

The pinballs on the left side of the main hall

On the right side of the hall were two rows of electronic pinballs – mostly Williams/Bally but with some Sega games in the mix.

[![The two rows of pinballs on the right side of the main hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/18-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/18-apo-2017.jpg)

More machines on the right side of the main hall

The walls are covered with camouflage-style netting with decorated branches protruding into the room.

Moving out into the entrance lobby, there was a Williams *Millionaire* machine which was free to use for practice at any time.

[![There was a Millionaire machine in the lobby for practice](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/35-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/35-apo-2017.jpg)

There was a Millionaire machine in the lobby for practice

From the lobby there was a staircase which led up to two more floors.  On the first there was an area which would be used to serve food at lunchtime, while one floor up were three more rooms full of pinballs.

The room on the right used to contain a mix of machines but is now a dedicated Stern room featuring an excellent selection of all the latest titles provided by [Niegelhell](http://www.niegelhell.com/). There’s a Pro and a Premium *Game of Thrones*, and when *Star Wars* is just arriving with operators and home buyers, here they have two Pros in addition to the LE downstairs.

On the right wall we find a *Ghostbusters*, an *AC/DC* Vault Edition, two *Aerosmiths* (Pro and LE), a *Kiss* LE and a *Batman 66*.

More new Stern machines

The other two rooms are linked.  The first has machines which were, in the main, not part of Saturday’s tournaments and could be used for practice.  They included, not one, but two *Whoa Nellie!* games.

[![The practice room across from the Stern room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/40-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/40-apo-2017.jpg)

The practice room across from the Stern room

The second room was mostly Williams/Bally titles, with just a lone *Batman: The Dark Knight* representing Stern.  The numbers on the machines indicate duplicates, so in the picture below you can see the third *Twilight Zone* and the second *Indiana Jones* in the collection.

And so back to the tournaments.  Besides trophies, there were also custom beer glasses for the top players.

Stefan Riedler made the introductions and described how the Main and Side Tournaments would work.

[![Stefan greets visitors and tells them about the tournament formats](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/14-apo-2017-1024x677.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/14-apo-2017.jpg)

Stefan greets visitors and tells them about the tournament formats

The Main Tournament was a Swiss-style one, where everyone took part in 17 rounds of head-to-head games against other players with a similar ranking on pre-defined machines. The number of wins would determine the initial ranking, with the result of who beat who giving a more granular result which could be used in deciding the tied places.

[![The matches in each round were displayed on the projector screen](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/25-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/25-apo-2017.jpg)

The matches in each round were displayed on the projector screen

The side tournament placed players in groups of four and gave them a machine to play.  They then played two four-player games on that machine with points awarded for positions in each game.  When both games were over, the two players with the most points moved on to the next round.

A few rounds of the Main Tournament were played first followed by a round of the Side Tournament, after which it was back to the Main.

[![The main tournament is underway](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/26-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/26-apo-2017.jpg)

[![The tournaments were played on modern and classic machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/27-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/27-apo-2017.jpg)

The tournaments were played on modern and classic machines

[![Mostly though they were modern machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/28-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/28-apo-2017.jpg)

At 1pm everything stopped for lunch which could be purchase with the tournament entry and cost €12 for both days.  This was served on the first floor and included a selection of meat and chicken dishes, vegetable sides and salad items, along with soup and bread, all supplied by an external catering company.

[![Some of the dishes available for Saturday's lunch](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/82-apo-2017jpg-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/82-apo-2017jpg.jpg)

We are happy to report that the quality of the food was high and there was plenty of it.  The buffet-style allowed guests to enjoy different courses if they wished, although there were no desserts.  If anyone wanted one of those, they could try the apricot sponge cake on sale at the bar.

The Main Tournament completed the 19 qualifying rounds on Saturday with the top 48 players out of the original 100 qualifying for Sunday’s play-offs.

[![The current standings were shown on the screen between rounds](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/31-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/31-apo-2017.jpg)

The current standings were shown on the screen between rounds

The Side Tournament was played through all its rounds on Saturday with the exception of the final which would take place on Sunday. Nearly everyone who played in the Main also played in the Side.

Sunday’s play-offs in the Main Tournament put the 48 qualifiers into six groups of eight and allocated them a pool of seven machines to play (plus one spare in case of technical problems).  Most machines were in the main hall but some were upstairs.

Everyone played a single game against every other member of their group on a pre-selected machine from the pool.  When all seven games had been played, the four players with the most wins continued to the next round, while the remaining four dropped out of the tournament.

[![The play-offs began on Sunday morning](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/32-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/32-apo-2017.jpg)

Tournament games in the Stern room

At midday on Sunday a raffle was drawn to win a restored *Firepower II* pinball.  Tickets were available for purchase for €2 each throughout the weekend until the draw took place.

[![This Firepower 2 machine was the prize in the raffle](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/46-apo-2017-1024x696.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/46-apo-2017.jpg)

There were then presentations to the top women players in the Main Tournament.  By this stage there were no more women remaining in the tournament, so the positions were based on their final rankings.

[![Third place in the women's rankings, Simone Götzhaber](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/47-apo-2017-1024x746.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/47-apo-2017.jpg)

Then the last few rounds of the Main Tournament took place.  After the group stage, it was down to head-to-head best-of-three games on randomly-selected machines.

One of the semi-finals of the Main Tournament

There was a ruling needed on the semi-final match on Terminator 2 shown above when the drop target in front of the lock shot became intermittent.

[![The organisers make a ruling](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/53-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/53-apo-2017.jpg)

The organisers make a ruling

The organisers decided it was a minor malfunction which affected both players equally and didn’t render the machine unplayable.  Krisztián Szalai had already won the first game and continued to win second too, booking his place in the final.

Only the two finals remained.

The Side Tournament three-way final played on three pre-chosen machines, starting with *Revenge from Mars*.  The three finalists were Boldizsár Botka, Krisztián Szalai and Cesare Datri, and Cesare began.

The second game was Farfalla.

Boldizsár on the second game – Farfalla

Finally it was time for the *Alien* which was set up at the front of the hall so everyone could see it clearly.  Krisztián had won the first two games and was in an unbeatable position going into the third.  Even so, he wanted to put in a good performance to try to achieve a clean sweep of victories.

Krisztián Szalai plays second

Krisztián had a good first ball which set the pace for the others to try to catch.

[![Cesare Datri is player three](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/56-apo-2017-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/56-apo-2017.jpg)

Cesare Datri is player three

Krisztián cemented the lead further on ball two and effectively wrapped it up on his final ball to end just under the 100M mark.  Boldizsár was second on nearly 17M while Cesare was third after a relatively quick game by his usual standards.

So, Krisztián won overall, Boldizsár was in second place, with Cesare third.

Then it was the turn of the main tournament to reach the final.  This time there was just the one machine used – *Star Wars*.  Two of the three players were the same as the Side Tournament – Cesare Datri and Krisztián Szalai.  They were joined by Zsolt Szabo for the five ball game.

[![The last game of the final was on Star Trek](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/60-apo-2017-1024x699.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/apo-2017/60-apo-2017.jpg)

Krisztián Szalai plays third

Although it was clearly explained before starting that it was a five-ball game, some in the audience forgot and thought it was all over after the third ball.  The players knew well-enough though.

*Star Wars* is a game where the scoring is relatively modest until you string the shots together and build-up the playfield multiplier, at which point your score really starts climbing quickly.  Zsolt got into the flow of the game and his score jumped by 100M in a short space of time, giving him a commanding lead which he kept to the end.  It was very close for second place with Krisztián narrowly pipping Cesare again.

With all the presentations over, we sprinted through the rain to jump in the car and start the two-hour drive back to Vienna airport.

The Hall of Pinball-Fame continues to amaze, with the best selection of games and an impressive main hall packed with machines, but still providing seating, tables and a bar.  Prices were very reasonable for the food, drinks and to enter the tournaments.  Having a Friday night warm-up even is also a fun way to begin a weekend of competitive pinball.  The location in the countryside south of Graz is a little restrictive, with only one guest house within walking distance – and a long, wet walk at that – but it’s easy to imagine how a similar building in a city would be prohibitively expensive.

But if a more remote location means we can enjoy such a great dedicated venue and jaw-dropping selection of machines, it’s a journey we are happy to make every time.
