**Date:** 19th-21st July 2024

**Location:**
The Cobb Galleria Convention Center, Marriott Renaissance Waverly
Atlanta, GA, USA

The 2024 edition of the [Southern Fried Gaming Expo](http://www.gameatl.com/) (known also as SFGE) was the 10th presented by organizers Preston Burt, Patrick Wall, and the many volunteers known as the ‘SFGE Troopers’.

This is where SFGE 2024 is located – easy access from Interstate 285

SFGE has become a multi-gaming show much as many similar shows across the country have adopted this format. In addition to pinball and arcade games of all kinds, SFGE also includes board games, vintage computers, console games, the HOTLanta extreme-eating challenge, eSports open play and tournaments, panel discussions, concerts and cosplay, to name but a few of the attractions available in the three days of SFGE 2024.

Board game swap area

There was also a large area set aside for a full-sized ring where the Southern States Pro Wrestling group presented high-flying live wresting daily.

The largest dedicated space for SFGE was the arcade area with over 400 pinball and arcade games set to free play as well as the display n’ play areas by Marco Specialties, Chicago Gaming, Spooky Pinball, Jersey Jack, and others where you could play the latest games and pick up some swag.

The film *Going Cardboard – A Board Game Documentary* was shown at SFGE 2024. It is a documentary about the American adoption of German-style board games as well as coverage and history of the board game event *Spiel* held annually in Essen, Germany. The film is available on DVD and Lorien Green has a [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3wY2JXCw1GpMlvNo0KzoDjae8diH1LhO) with clips from the film as well as bonus features.

For the first time, SFGE had food trucks on hand in addition to the usual dining and beverage options in the Cobb Galleria and the Marriott hotel. I hope that the food trucks become an SFGE tradition going forward.

Panel Discussions

SFGE Troopers Tyler Campbell and Tommy Vernieri took charge of managing the SFGE pinball tournaments which had the results submitted to the IFPA. The pinball tournaments paid cash prizes and merchandise. Tyler has said that he will publish the tournament results as well as photos on the [www.gameatl.com](http://www.gameatl.com) site within the next few weeks.

Sci-Fi art was on hand in abundance

At the Saturday night Appreciation Dinner, the third annual Marc Mandeltort Distinguished Gamer Award was presented by Patrick Wall. This award was created to recognize an individual with an intense enthusiasm for gaming and who supports others in the gaming community. The winner of this award must have a passion for helping others and sharing their gaming knowledge through words, actions, and social presence.

This year’s award winner was Imoto Harney. I would encourage you to read Patrick’s award induction speech which is located at [gameatl.com/marc-mandeltort-award](https://gameatl.com/marc-mandeltort-award/). Past winners of the Distinguished Gamer Award have been David Kitch and Al Warner.

Imoto Harney – Distinguished Gamer Award Winner 2024

Now with eleven years worth of experience to guide them, SFGE 2024 was a very polished and professionally-orchestrated event that ran very smoothly.

The programs and game play were designed to appeal to many segments of the gaming community. I sat in on sessions about topics I was not familiar with, such as the history of the NABU Network PC circa 1982 and I learned quite a bit from the time that I spent in these sessions.

Most of the 2024 sessions were recorded and, after editing, will be available on the SFGE YouTube channel which is [youtube.com/@Southernfriedgameroomexpo/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Southernfriedgameroomexpo/videos).

A ballroom full of vintage computer equipment was on hand
