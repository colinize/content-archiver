**Date:** 29th April -1st May, 2022
**Location:** A.R.C.A.D.E., Barcelona, Spain

I am pleased to be able to share this summary of the events of the weekend of April 29th to May 1st when the TBAP 2022 event was celebrated.

One of the TBAP’s many trophies – this one is for the Classics champion

As you may know, it was only after the pandemic that we could finally organise and enjoy the Torneig Barceloní de Pinball or TBAP, Barcelona’s pinball tournament. It was held in #LaNau, at the premises of [A.R.C.A.D.E.](https://www.arcade.cat/en/) (Associació per a la Restauració i Conservació d’Arcades i altres Dispositius Electrònics).

**Friday Frenzy**

The #TBAP22 kicked off on Friday April 29th with a Frenzy tournament hosted at the [Stern Army](https://sternpinball.com/stern-army/) site. It was a great way to warm up for the weekend ahead.

Playing in the Frenzy tournament

For players who were already in the area, this tournament gave them an early opportunity to become acquainted with the pinballs in #LaNau.

The Frenzy gathered up to 34 players of a very high level who continuously played random games from 7:30pm until midnight. Hitting the flippers requires energy, so the dinner break from 9pm until 10pm was essential, with a varied selection of pizzas to enjoy.

One of the novelties of #TBAP22 was the fantastic live streaming via the association’s Twitch channel. This was made possible by the voluntary work of a group of members during the previous weeks.

As a sample, you can watch the final of Friday’s Frenzy below or at this link:

**Saturday, First Day of TBAP 2022**

The TBAP 2022 officially began on Saturday April 30th at 9am. A maximum of 56 participants from various corners of Spain and other European countries arrived punctually for the start the event. In addition, and for the third consecutive tournament, the rookie of the house, Eren, the youngest player at just 7 years old, participated.

For weeks the organisers worked against the clock to get #LaNau ready and turn it into the best home for around one hundred pinballs of all ages. The tournament included both modern and classic events.

Flipper fingers did not stop at any time: between the pinballs used in competition, there was a corridor with machines on free play and also a charity pinball – more on that shortly.

**Sunday, Second Day of TBAP 2022**

Sunday was the day for the grand finals of the classic and modern divisions. In addition, three mini-tournaments were organized: Pinball for Couples, Blind Pinball and The Price is Right Pinball.

* The **Pinball For Couples** mini-tournament was played on a Stern *Star Trek* machine.
  Each player was in charge of one of the flippers, which complicates coordination.
  The winning couple was formed by Jose Maria ‘TiltMan’ and César Dubón ‘Pipo’.
* The **Blind Pinball** was played on *The Flintstones* with 80% of the playfield covered.
  The pinball champion was Mario ‘Pinballhero’.
* **The Price is Right Pinball** mini-tournament consisted of approaching, without going over, a score of 300422 points on the pinball *Cherokee*, made by Recreativos Franco.
  The champion was Víctor Cerdanya.

As well as the main finals, the name of the separate TBAP Grand Champion would be announced, along with the winner of the Charity Pinball.

**Charity Pinball**

For the first time, a charity pinball was organized within the framework of TBAP. For this purpose, a Gottlieb *Circus* table was provided by Jaén Arcade Museum. The games were paid for, and the proceeds were donated to the NGO *Associació Aprenem Autisme*, an organization that fights for the rights of children with autism.

The winner, Toni ‘Pinball Project’, was the person who got the highest score during the whole weekend. The prize, in addition to supporting the nominated charity, included a basket of local Catalan products.

At the end of the day, the pinball had raised €195, to which we were able to add €105 from an anonymous donation. That made in total, €300 for [*Associació Aprenem Autisme*](https://www.associacioaprenem.org/es/).

**TBAP Grand Champion**

All games played during the qualifying rounds counted towards the title of TBAP Grand Champion. And every Grand Champion deserves a grand prize.

In this case, Julio Vicario, in addition to winning the Classic Division, was the one who scored the most points overall with 32 wins.

He was awarded with an *NBA MAC* pinball entirely restored by members of the association, a very special gift that summarizes the 8 years of history of the A.R.C.A.D.E. association.

**Acknowledgements**

It has been a very intense pinball weekend. From A.R.C.A.D.E., as organizers of the tournament, we want to thank all the participants for their attendance. Given the good atmosphere of the three days, we think everyone had a very pleasant experience.

We also want to thank our collaborators PinballProject, El Museo del Recreativo, PinballArcade80’s, MundoPinball and Manzoni’s Garage. Without them, all this madness would not have been possible.

And we always say that being part of A.R.C.A.D.E. is more than just joining a game in a local club with colleagues. Without the hard work and countless hours dedicated by the members it would not have been possible to organize such a big event. Thanks to those who organized the entire tournament, to those in charge of streaming, to the people who gave a hand in the bar area and around the venue to assist the players, to those in charge of social networks, to all of you.

**See you at TBAP 2023!**

Over the next few days we will be posting pictures and videos of the best moments on our social networks.
