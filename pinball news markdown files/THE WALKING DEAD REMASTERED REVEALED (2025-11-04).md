Stern Pinball today revealed their latest game, *The Walking Dead Remastered*. This is the second ‘Remastered’ title, coming almost exactly one year after the first, *[Metallica Remastered](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/10/16/metallica-remastered-revealed/)*, and, as with that first game, John Borg heads up the design team.

The ‘Remastered’ series takes a SAM-based dot-matrix game and upgrades many aspects, including the addition of an LCD panel, improved audio quality, RGB LED lighting replacing incandescent lamps, and more robust playfield mechanisms.

The *Walking Dead Remastered* is only available as Premium and Limited Edition models, with the Limited Edition restricted to a maximum of 500 units. Pricing is the same as Stern’s cornerstone titles, meaning the Premium costs $9,699 and the Limited Edition $3,300 more, coming in at $12,999.

Let’s take a look at the exterior of the two models.

**Premium**

The artwork for the Remastered editions comes from fantasy, horror and sci-fi artist, [Robert Laskey](https://www.robertlaskey.com/). As you can see, both models feature vibrant red, orange and blue colours in stark contrast to the much more muted browns and greens of the original *The Walking Dead* game.

Here’s a reminder of how the SAM-based *The Walking Dead* game looked when it was first announced on 9th September, 2014, compared with the equivalent models from today’s reveal:

[![The original Premium and Limited Edition models of The Walking Dead](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/300-walking-dead-remastered-1024x825.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/300-walking-dead-remastered.jpg)

The original Premium and Limited Edition models of The Walking Dead

[![The Premium and Limited Edition models of The Walking Dead Remastered](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/301-walking-dead-remastered-1024x911.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/301-walking-dead-remastered.jpg)

The Premium and Limited Edition models of The Walking Dead Remastered

For those interested in prices, [the original *The Walking Dead* from eleven years ago](https://www.pinballnews.com/games/walkingdead/index3.html) cost $7,595 (vs $9,699 for the Remastered) for the Premium and $8,595 (vs $12,999 for the Remastered) for the Limited Edition. Back in September 2014, only the Pro and Limited Edition models were released at launch. The Premium model came [a full three months later](https://www.pinballnews.com/games/walkingdead/index4.html) following some doubt about whether a mid-tier version would be produced at all.

*The Walking Dead Remastered* runs on the new SPIKE 3 board system, giving full HD graphics, improved sound quality, better Wi-Fi stability and the potential for using wireless Bluetooth headphones. The newer system also adds Insider Connected which wasn’t available for the original release.

Also added to the Remastered are new voice calls from actors Michael Rooker and Danai Gurira who play the characters Merle and Michonne respectively.

The Limited Edition model includes special laser-cut side rails with Expression Lighting on both the inside and outside, as well as the Expression Speaker Lighting system. So far there is no information on any topper.

[![Internal and external Expression Lighting](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/206-walking-dead-remastered-1024x574.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/206-walking-dead-remastered.jpg)

Internal and external Expression Lighting

**Playfield**

So, let’s dive inside to look at the playfield. Both models have the same playfield toys and artwork, with the Expression Lighting being the main differentiator.

The Premium and Limited Edition playfields

By subtracting the Premium model’s playfield from the Limited Edition’s, we are left with just the differences between them which, as you can see below, are really just the cabinet’s Expression Lighting and the bottom apron’s left side artwork.

[![The Limited Edition playfield with the Premium's playfield subtracted](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/002-walking-dead-remastered-513x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/002-walking-dead-remastered.jpg)

The Limited Edition playfield with the Premium’s playfield subtracted

We’ll mostly look at the Limited Edition as that includes the art blades on the interior cabinet sides.

The two slingshots have now gained sculpted heads, although they appear to be static models.

Some of the playfield mechanisms have been redesigned.

The Well Walker is now solenoid controlled rather than relying on the impact of the ball to create movement. The magnet is also more pronounced and robust.

[![The new Well Walker bash toy](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/214-walking-dead-remastered-1024x655.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/214-walking-dead-remastered.jpg)

The crossbow toy, not originally included in the Pro model, is now driven by a stepper motor, so its speed and position are both more controllable.

The original *The Walking Dead* game saw the welcome return of star rollovers in the shot leading to the top lanes. These have been redesigned in the Remastered edition to become button rollovers instead.

[![The star rollovers are now button rollovers](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/220-walking-dead-remastered-1024x652.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/walking-dead-remastered/220-walking-dead-remastered.jpg)

The Cell Block C model looks largely unchanged from the original design.

Also largely unchanged is the Governor’s fish tank, containing the three Walkers’ heads, though the green lighting does appear more intense.

The Bicycle Girl lift ramp on the left looks pretty much as before, though it does appear to have gained a rather unsightly plastic sign mounted above it.

Let’s finish with a few more shots of the Remastered playfield.

The playfield in the Premium edition without the art blades or Expression Lighting

Adding the new 18.5″ LCD panel to *The Walking Dead Remastered* obvious requires a whole new set of display animations to be created along with a new user interface to show scores, credits, ball count and other game information.

Details of these are limited, but some are shown in this promo video created by Stern.

Here’s Stern’s feature matrix comparing the Premium and Limited Edition models, showing what is included in each.
