Pinball: The Man Who Saved The Game

The Bragg brothers said, “*The history of pinball is fascinating and uniquely American. Roger’s impact on the game is well-known to pinball fans but worthy of wider attention. We’re excited to work with Roger to share his remarkable journey.*”

There was a brief teaser of the movie posted on YouTube but it has subsequently been taken down. However, there is now a website about it, including details of the cast and crew.
