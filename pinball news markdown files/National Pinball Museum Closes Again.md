Less than two years after it was forced to relocate from its original home in Georgetown, Washington DC, the National Pinball Museum is having to close its doors once again.

When the Museum's founder, David Silverman, found a new home for the exhibits at the old Chocolate Factory store on Water Street in Baltimore at the end of 2011, it seemed the uncertainty over the Museum's future was behind him.

Now though, David has announced that he has been unable to agree terms with the landlord for a new lease for the premises, and consequently the Museum will close at its current location on the city's 'Restaurant Row' on March 3rd, 2013.

In a letter posted on the NPM's website, David said, "After such a successful year, everyone at the Museum was looking forward to continuing our tournaments, educational programs and interactive exhibits in our current location for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were unable to negotiate favorable terms with our landlord to extend our rental agreement without creating an extreme financial strain on the Museum’s limited resources."

The search now begins again for a new, more permanent home for the NPM. But with that comes the cost of relocation, storage fees and refurbishment of the new premises, all of which will impact on the resources of a nonprofit organisation such as the NPM.

In the meantime, there are just two weeks left to visit the National Pinball Museum and give them your support, while donations to help with the running costs and the relocation expenses can also be made through the Museum's website.
