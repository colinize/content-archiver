The California pinball show had another highly successful three-day event in beautiful Dixon California. The weather was warm and sunny and the attendees were many as it once again filled the two large buildings at the Fair Grounds. As usual people came from all over the west coast and quite a few drove, or flew in, from other states. This author flew back for the show from Tennessee.

This show was the 21st at the Fairgrounds. It has always been surrounded by other events including car shows, a small carnival, and dog shows. You never really know what to expect and the anticipation can really work on you. Sometimes the weather can also surprise you. From hot enough to cook on your car’s hood to pouring rain. Carrying a set of tarps is not uncommon.

The show’s staff do an incredible job. Over many past shows I have witnessed some amazing organizational feats from this group. An awesome bunch of pinball enthusiasts that put in countless hours of their time. The dedication to providing an amazing show is always obvious.

This year’s show was in many ways bittersweet. Many of us are still in shock at the passing of long time pinball icon, and personal friend Steve Charland, (aka Blown Fuse and System 80 Nut). A memorial was in place to honor Steve and his wonderful family. His wife Cathy and their daughters, Aubrey and Amber were in attendance. Make sure to read to the end of the article for more of the memorial.

Wednesday and Thursday before the show, the annual ‘Fix-A-Thon’ at Matt Christiano’s ranch in Paicines was dedicated to the memory of Steve. The focus was all on System 1 and System 80 game repair. Tim Mieghan, Bill Witzel, and Lou Perazzoli made it down from the northwest to join the rest of us. Working on those old games brought back a lot of memories.

The Pin-a-Go-Go show gets plenty of local PR with front man Steve Faith handling the media. Here *Good Day Sacramento* is covering the event.

The Thursday load-in is always interesting to watch take place. Games wander in on all kinds of dollies, lift carts, home-made movers, and by good old two guys carrying them. Some come complete and ready to plug in, and others in pieces. The entire floor looks like a repair shop for hours.

[![The first games arrive](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pin-a-go-go-2017/06-pagg.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pin-a-go-go-2017/06-pagg.jpg)

And it’s not just the main room. The Classic EM Room is always a treat to watch unfold.

Atari legend Dan Kramer was manning the program podium. You don’t get past Dan without a program. You’ve seen a few hints now so can you guess this year’s show theme?

With Friday being the opening day, the real anticipation is always for the weekend. It’s that time of the year to renew friendships, play games, buy parts, get memorabilia, relax and let the rest of the world just be on hold for three days.

The BBQ in the parking lot is always a fan favorite. Ask Jack about it.

Back to the Hall.

Planetary Pinball Supply brought the new *Attack from Mars Remake* for display. This machine had an illuminated backbox side art mod that is not part of the production, so if you liked it you will need to get it elsewhere.

Another PAGG fan favorite was *Houdini*. You got a free T-shirt for playing it Saturday.

This game was really fun. The only real negative comment about it was the long bonus countdown sequence. The ball launching up the left side of the playfield in midair to the trunk was pretty awesome. Never saw it miss. The game was smooth to play.

You don’t have to be a ‘pinball wizard’. The fun thing about the games and the attendees is they find their favorites within a few hours. Obviously, there are lines behind the new games but if you are a fan of games from the past most likely you’ll log plenty of game time on those classics.

Pin-a-Go-Go also has its own flair for those who just like to be themselves.

Family fun for all.

Something many people have now forgotten is how these games are not likely anywhere in the public anymore. The days of 7-11s having games is over., and there are not many arcades outside of amusement parks. A recent visit to the local Walmart revealed a small game room at one of the entrances, but not one pinball.

How often has someone told you pinball was a male dominated hobby? You’d be amazed at the ladies’ love and support for the game.

Throughout the hobby women of all ages are involved in so many ways, from fund-raisers to tournament organization, artwork for shows, raffle table set-up and organization, vendors, wrist band attachment, and so much more.

**Pinball Medics**

You may notice the red shirt gang working the floor.

The Pinball Medics are on the job

The pinball hospital is a vital part of the show. When a game is too ill to fix on the floor it ends up behind this door for emergency attention.

Where sick games are made better

Outside of the Medics we have one of the west coasts best technicians on hand. Chris Kuntz of *T Minus One* has rescued more than a few games at every show.

**The Outdoor Flea Market**

A Saturday tradition started a few years back. This allows for those that may not be there all weekend to bring items to sell. This year there was a lot to choose from.

**The Vendors**

As a former vendor, I can relate to the amount of work involved in having a booth at any pinball and arcade show. Sometimes it’s to reduce excess inventory and sometimes it’s a business. Either way it’s not all roses.

The cost to attend the event in driving and lodging takes a big bite out of any profits or attempts to recover costs for the hobby. For a business, it’s largely PR. Either way the service provided is something you can’t put an actual price on. The hours spent setting up and packing inventory can be excessive. Then you have to put back what you came back with. Hats off to all these folks.

Cliffy has been hammering out these protectors for several years now. His contribution to the hobby has evolved from a few sets a weekend to now a full-time passion. I have shared a booth with him for years at Pin-a-Go-Go. Wouldn’t have it any other way.

I cannot imagine a show without Rob, also known as Boryguard. His “Lock When Lit” service is outstanding. Rob repairs boards on-site and has lots of test tools and parts on hand right at the show. Rob lugs around his WPC test fixture from show to show across the country. On top of that he is one great guy. Always glad to see you.

**The Steve Charland Memorial**

**Authors note:**

For those who knew Steve you were blessed. If you didn’t get to know him then you missed a legend of pinball and one of the best people you could ever meet. He devoted himself to helping others repair a brand of game that most operators had shoved to the back of the warehouse and left for dead. He realized a need and filled it. We spent hours together at the shows going through my many bins of parts. We discussed the technology and I made sure he had all the inside information I had gathered at service schools over the years.

We collaborated on projects he wanted to pursue. Although I was used mostly for information and affirmation he did all the work. At times he amazed me at how deep he was willing to dig to get an answer for a problem. Although you may not know it there are quite a few mods out there that Steve pioneered. After we found a bag of Haunted House illuminated posts in one of my bins we started discussing why more post illumination had not been utilized on games. This grew into a project with several versions and ideas and a ton of phone calls. The final result was a small circuit board with a flat LED that fit under a playfield post and did not affect the height of the plastics mounted on it enough to cause a problem with pinballs getting trapped underneath. Routing the wiring through existing holes was easy. Steve put these on his Alien Star and took it to PAGG to show it off. Well, we all know what happened and someone else with the means to fabricate them jumped on it and took credit. Even though this bothered him he did not let it get the best of him. In the end, it was for the good of pinball.

Steve posted so much free advice and help via RGP and Pinside to so many who may not have gotten those games ever running again. One of the things Steve often joked with me about was that he hoped he would never be forgotten. I think we can say that will never be an issue.

There is so much more that can be said and pictures that could be posted, but everything cannot be described in one article. Also it’s hard to recognize everyone who contributes and for that my sincere apologies, but one thing for sure is the picture below makes it all worthwhile.
