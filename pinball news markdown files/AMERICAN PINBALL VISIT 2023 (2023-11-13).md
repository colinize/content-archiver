**Date:** 17th October 2023
**Location:** 500 S Hicks Rd, Palatine, IL 60067, USA

Shortly before the start of Pinball Expo last month, Pinball News paid a visit to the Palatine home of American Pinball to see what had changed since our [previous visit](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/11/03/american-pinball-visit-2/) twelve months earlier.

The building on South Hicks Road is shared with American Pinball’s parent company, Aimtron, with the right half being home to the pinball business.

Since our visit was taking place the day before Pinball Expo began, there was much work underway to prepare the American Pinball stand and ship numerous pinball machines the four miles to the Schaumburg Convention Center.

With American Pinball’s Executive Vice President, David Fix, also responsible for all the vendor stands at Pinball Expo, a number of machines from other manufacturers were staged at the company’s office so they could more easily be shipped together to the Convention Center.

Also preparing for his appearance at Pinball Expo was *Galactic Tank Force’s* Game Designer, Dennis Nordman, who was also busy in his office working on his upcoming titles.

After spending some time talking, David showed us around the factory to see the company’s current games being built.

Inside the manufacturing area

Last year, while there were plenty of playfields being built for *Oktoberfest* and *Legends of Valhalla*, there was a shortage of the cabinets and backboxes needed to make complete games.

This year there was no such problem, with multiple playfields and cabinets being equipped, and many completed games boxed-up and ready to ship.

When we visited, the company was busy building *Houdini* and *Galactic Tank Force* games on two separate playfield lines – *Galactic Tank Force* on the left, *Houdini* on the right.

This run of Houdini games is the last to include all the original 3D sculpts for the bumper toppers, the milk can, the spirit plaque, the stage spotlights and the wooden trunk. Future runs of the Deluxe model will replace these models with artworked flat plastics, and use decals to simulate the wood effect on the trunk.

Buyers of the upcoming Signature Edition of Galactic Tank Force will receive a retro-style tin lunchbox with their game, while they and Limited Edition buyers get the RGB lit tank tracks for the sides of their machine.

While some parts arrive fully-assembled from contractors, games usually require many sub-assemblies to be built in the factory before they can be installed on the playfield. There is a dedicated area for making these sub-assemblies.

[![The sub-assemblies construction area](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/american-pinball-visit-october-2023/010-american-pinball-visit-october-2023-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/learn/american-pinball-visit-october-2023/010-american-pinball-visit-october-2023.jpg)

The sub-assemblies construction area

Every pinball machine uses hundreds of parts and none of them can be completed until all those parts are in-stock. So, much of the space within the factory is take up with parts storage – from the smallest screws to complete cabinets.

Last year there were piles of cardboard shipping boxes and packing pieces. This year the supplies had reduced as more games have been built and boxed, but there were still plenty ready to go.
