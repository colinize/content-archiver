Stern Pinball today revealed details of their latest release, *Star Wars: The Mandalorian*, based on the popular TV series of the same name.

Stern Pinball’s relationship with Lucasfilm and Disney has resulted in several previous *Star Wars* machines based on both the original movie trilogy and the comic art spin-off. The new release is based on the much more recent *The Mandalorian* series shown on the Disney+ channel.

*The Mandalorian* pinball is designed by Brian Eddy – his second design for Stern Pinball after his 2019 debut with *Stranger Things*. It features custom speech by Carl Weathers who plays Greef Karga in the series and includes the theme music from Ludwig Göransson. Stern Pinball were able to use video material from both of the first two seasons for their LCD panel in addition to their in-house generated display effects.

As usual there are three variants – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition with the LE restricted to 750 units.

We’ll start our look at *The Mandalorian* with the Pro model, and as usual all the images are high-resolution and can be enlarged by clicking on them.

The Pro model’s translite image

The artwork on all three variants is by Randy Martinez who also created the art for Stern’s earlier Star Wars movie and comic pinballs.

The Pro model (MSRP $6,199 + tax/shipping) – which will be the first to be manufactured – features three flippers, two at the bottom in the usual place and a third in the upper-right in a mini-playfield area.

The Pro model’s playfield

There is only one inlane on each side and one outlane. The slingshots are also unadorned with additional lighting effects, while the playfield artwork stops around the slingshot posts to avoid any problems with the ink causing a lack of adhesion between the clearcoat and the playfield wood.

In the upper-right corner is the Encounter mini-playfield area. The Pro model has a single flipper but the Premium and LE models kick it up a few notches by having two flippers, motorising the separate mini-playfield so it can adjust the angle of play during play, and having an up-post at the exit to hold the ball.

The left ramp can either divert the ball to the Encounter mini-playfield, or the ball can continue behind the back panel onto the ramp return at the right inlane.

The Premium model (MSRP $7,799 + tax/shipping) shares the same black wrinkle powder coat finish to the external metalwork as the Pro, but includes the same set of playfield gameplay features as the Limited Edition. It will be the last model to be manufactured, hitting the line in late-June.

The Limited Edition (MSRP $9,199 + tax/shipping) comes with a mirrored backglass as opposed to the translite film on the Pro and Premium. The design particularly lends itself to a liberal use of mirroring on the glass.

Here’s how Stern Pinball announced their latest release:

| --- |
| **CHICAGO, IL – May 11, 2021** –Stern Pinball, Inc., announces a new line of pinball machines inspired by the Emmy award-winning Star WarsTM series, The Mandalorian, streaming only on Disney+. These new pinball machines are available in Pro, Premium, and Limited Edition (LE) models now.  The story of The Mandalorian is set after the fall of the Galactic Empire and before the emergence of the First Order. The series follows the travails of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic.  In this action-packed pinball quest, players are transported to a galaxy far, far away as they play as the Mandalorian, teaming up with key allies and protecting Grogu, while battling dangerous enemies and forces across their journey. “Star Wars is timeless and our players have enjoyed every pinball machine reimagined by the iconic space saga,” said Gary Stern, Chairman and CEO of Stern Pinball, Inc. “Stern’s new pinball machine, inspired by The Mandalorian, continues that tradition with an engaging and exciting story for an entirely new generation of fans around the world. Collaborating with Lucasfilm, we have brought all of the suspense, excitement, and action from the Star Wars galaxy into a one-of-a-kind pinball adventure perfect for any location or home gameroom.”  Prepare for battle on the gravity-changing, rotating Encounter upper mini playfield available on the Premium and Limited Edition models. This innovative, motorized rotating playfield is packed with six stand-up targets, lights, and two full-size flippers for high intensity pinball action.  Watch out for ambushes! Like the Mandalorian seen in the series, players can be ambushed by enemy forces. A dynamic inner loop shot activates an up/down horseshoe scoop ramp for fast, repeatable precision shooting, creating tense experiences on the Premium and Limited Edition models.  Players can navigate their way to multiball mayhem by hitting a unique hanging uplift target attached to a custom molded Razor Crest ship. Success in hitting the target qualifies a center ramp shot on the Pro, Premium, and Limited Edition models.  Features of The Mandalorian­-inspired pinball machines include a large custom sculpture of Grogu, authentic video and audio from seasons one and two, and exclusive custom speech performed by actor Carl Weathers (Greef Karga). The game includes the iconic title theme song by Ludwig Göransson and stunning hand-drawn artwork by Randy Martinez, one of today’s most popular comic artists.  Only 750 limited-edition machines will be available. The limited edition version includes an exclusive full color mirrored backglass inspired by Beskar armor, iconic custom cabinet artwork, custom high gloss powder-coated pinball armor, a custom designer autographed bottom arch, exclusive inside art blades, upgraded audio system, anti-reflection pinball playfield glass, shaker motor, a sequentially numbered plaque, and Certifcate of Authenticity.  **Pricing and Availability:** Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price: MSRP for sales to USA end-users, before any VAT, GST, Sales Tax, Duties, or other taxes. Pro Model: $US 6,199 Premium Model: $US 7,799 Limited Edition Model: $US 9,199  The Mandalorian-inspired pinball machines and accessories are available now through authorized Stern Pinball distributors and dealers around the world.

| --- |
| We love everything Star Wars!!  And so does everyone else.  You know from our May 4th teaser and from today’s webinars, we are starting production of our next cornerstone game, Star Wars The Mandalorian. You all must know the phenomenal success of The Mandalorian, which like all things Star Wars, appeals to all ages, including all my fellow employees and my 4 year old granddaughter. The 2 seasons, 8 weekly episodes each, debuted in November 2019 and October 2020 respectively. The third season is expected in spring of 2022. More important than The Mandalorian’s many Emmy nominations and awards, its global content demand was 31.9 times more than any other current title, according to research firm Parrot Analytics.  The Mandalorian game will have Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models.   We are maintaining our cadence and schedule – new cornerstone titles in beginning of the year, in the spring, and in the fall. We have increased our production 20% and will increase another 25% over the next few months.  Lucas is driving excitement for The Mandalorian pinball. We participated in their “May the 4th Be With You” events. This morning at 8am CDT Lucas introduced their entire fan base to this game with its exclusive announcement on the official Star Wars website, <https://www.starwars.com/news>.  Lucas will continue to actively drive exposure of The Mandalorian pinball machine, including featuring it on their weekly “This Week in Star Wars” news program scheduled for this Thursday (5/13) around 2pm CDT.  In Star Wars lore, The Mandalorian story takes place 5 years after Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. This series tells the story of a lone bounty hunter who goes on the run after being hired to retrieve The Child (who is not Yoda as a baby).  The Mandalorian Pro has a very full playfield with great shots, spell outs and easy to follow rules, which build to increasingly higher levels for better players. In the center of the playfield, between the sling shots, a pattern of 3 easy to understand insert displays count progression through Encounters, Missions, and Razer Crest multiball awards toward 3 different Wizard Modes, culminating in the Final Wizard Mode. Play starts with 5 rollovers at the top, spelling C-H-I-L-D under a custom molded The Child, before the ball enters the pop bumper area. An up-post in the orbits can also redirect balls into C-H-I-L-D rollovers. Shooting multiple times through the sweet spot at playfield center, under the custom molded Razer Crest ship, starts multiball play with 3 or 4 balls, even more balls if players earn add-a-balls. There are 3 smooth plastic ramps, 2 of which direct the ball to the return lanes. The center third ramp has a control gate to stage a ball for Razer Crest multiball. The left ramp has a diverter to transport balls to the Encounter mini-playfield area with 6 targets for a rule completion plus its own flipper; thus The Mandalorian has 3 flippers in total. The game has a spinning target and scoop & vuk on the left and a mini loop on the right.  Shots and rules progressions are indicated with 18 RGB lights. GI lighting is enhanced with color changing LED’s. Custom speech is provided by actor Carl Weathers, who plays Greef Karga. The Ludwig Göransson The Mandalorian theme music envelops game play. Action is augmented with Season 1 and Season 2 videos.  Additions and changes for the Premium/LE are substantial. The diverter on Encounter ramp still feeds the mini-playfield, but the mini-playfield is no longer just an area of the playfield. This mini-playfield is a motorized, separate playfield, moving from a 45 degree angle to parallel and above the playfield. Added is a 2nd flipper on the Encounter mini-playfield, making 4 flippers on Premium/LE games. There is an up-post at mini-playfield exit. Under The Child is a “Force” magnet to catch the ball and create exiting action. All ramps have chrome wire returns. The mini-loop on the right features a rule controlled dynamic up-down scoop loading an added wire ramp feeding the left ramp return.  Based on our dealer and distributor input, we have decided to make 750 Limited Edition The Mandalorian games, each with: – High gloss Beskar inspired armor and legs – Mirrored backglass – the most exciting and stunning I have ever seen – Upgraded audio system – Shaker motor – Non-glare playfield glass – Certificate of authenticity signed by me – Designer autograph – Sequentially numbered (1 to 750) plate  Production of The Mandalorian Pro games will begin next week. In early June, we will begin the LE. The Premium production will start late June. We also will continue manufacturing many other games.  We have all read about and felt cost increases and shortages of many things we buy for home and business. Manufacturing generally has suffered cost increases and shortages for electronic chips, LCD’s, metals, wood, and more. Nonetheless The Mandalorian will be priced the same as our last cornerstone.   Because the LE production starts in a matter of weeks, we ask full payment of LE purchase price be made with order. As usual, for the LE there is no CIA discount. Fees remain unchanged to specify an LE number, if available. UMRP, MAP and MSRP will be the same as our last cornerstone game; confirming lists will be sent separately to U.S. distributors and dealers.  A full line of accessories will be available. Art blades are scheduled for mid-June. Side armor and shooter rods are mid-July. Subject to licensor’s pending approval, topper is planned for August.  Jack Danger will stream The Mandalorian Premium/LE with the game team live on Friday, May 21, at 6pm CST: <https://www.twitch.tv/deadflip>  I have been playing the Pro and the Premium The Mandalorian every afternoon for weeks. As locations open, this game will earn, having a great title, great casual player rules and features, and plenty of shots and rules for the great player. Great game and great title, for home and operation.  This is the Way.  Gary |
