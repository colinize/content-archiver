The city of Tacoma

The venue is the Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center – a glassy construct built on a hill such that the side entrance is on the third floor while the main entrance is on the first.

The Greater Tacoma Conference and Trade Center

The show is held on the top (fifth) floor, and as soon as you arrive at the top of the escalator, you see the first change this year. The seminars have moved from a rather disconnected room on the third floor and been brought into the lobby area.

The seminars area on the top floor

Because of all the glass – and hence all the natural light – the organisers have eschewed the use of a projector for the seminar speakers’ presentations, and have used three large-screen LCD monitors for the speakers and the audience instead.

The seminars area

As usual, all the seminars will be [streamed live](http://www.nwpinballshow.com/live-stream) with the videos then posted on the [show’s YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/balliswild/videos).

THURSDAY

When we arrived around 4pm on the Thursday, preparations were underway in all areas.

With just a couple of hours to go until the official opening at midday, nearly all the machines were in place and vendors were setting up their stands.

The show opened at midday, but before then plenty of visitors were buying tickets to be one of the first through the doors.

[![Queues at the admissions desk](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/38.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/38.jpg)

Queues at the admissions desk

As visitors entered the hall they came to the merchandise desk which is where they could buy their tickets for the prize draws which took place over the three day.

There was a $1-per-entry daily draw for one large and multiple smaller prizes, and a show-long draw for a brand new *Ghostbusters Pro* game.

[![The daily top prizes - an Xbox One for Friday, a Laser Wars for Saturday, and an Astro Blaster for Sunday](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/40.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/40.jpg)

When the doors opened, visitors could sign up for the various [pinball tournaments](http://nwpas.wapinball.net/) being held over the three days. The main match-play event was split into five qualifying rounds on Friday and Saturday. Players could only sign up for one round at a time, but if they didn’t qualify they could then register for another round up to a maximum of three.

There was also a Classics PinGolf tournament played on a bank of classics machine to the left of the desk. This also ran through Friday and Saturday, with players booking their tee-off times at five minute intervals.

Entry for either tournament cost $20. There were also a women’s tournament, two kids tournaments, a Rookie Tournament with a *Galahad* or the winner, and a Rising Star championship with a refurbished *Harlem Globetrotters* as the prize.

Saturday also featured a new batch of seminars. These began at 12:30 with Seattle resident David Thiel.

12:30pm: David Thiel

[![David Thiel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/87.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/87.jpg)

David Thiel

David spoke about his history in game audio development, starting with early video games and continuing with pinball games for Data East. More recently he created the music and effects for games from Stern Pinball, and Jersey Jack Pinball.

2:00pm: Dwight Sullivan

[![Dwight Sullivan](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/88.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/88.jpg)

Dwight Sullivan

Dwight’s seminar took the audience through the creation of the rules for a Ghostbusters pinball’s wizard mode. There are many considerations to be made when designing a mode and Dwight selected members of the audience to come up with ideas about the setting for the mode, what the player is supposed to achieve, how they progress through the mode and the scoring possibilities.

[![Dwight shows some of the possible features in a wizard mode](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/90.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/90.jpg)

Dwight said this was a condensed version of the process he and his team go through when designing a game’s rules, and he rewarded the wizard mode designers in the audience with Stern Pinball T-shirts.

3:30pm: Nolan Bushnell

[![Nolan Bushnell](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/92.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/92.jpg)

Nolan Bushnell

Nolan is a famed entrepreneur who is best known for being the pioneer of coin-op video games, as well as starting the company Atari and the restaurant chain Chuck E. Cheese.

He began by talking about how he got into electronics and computing through ham radio and then at college where the earliest video games were played on mainframe computers. He continued by describing how the game Pong was created and how that title went on to be such a huge global success.

[![Nolan recounts how Pong was created](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/94.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/94.jpg)

Nolan recounts how Pong was created

Nolan described how Pong’s success shaped the video game boom in the years which followed, but also left him with a problem where we wanted to operate games as well as build them, but didn’t want to directly compete with the operators who were buying his games. That led to the creation of the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant and arcade chain.

[![There wasn't even any standing room left at Nolan's seminar](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/93.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/93.jpg)

There wasn’t even any standing room left at Nolan’s seminar

After detailing his lifetime in game and business development, Nolan concluded by describing his vision for the future of the entertainment business and the companies who are currently working on creating it.

5:00pm: Jack Guarnieri, Butch Peel & David Thiel

[![Jack Guarnieri](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/95.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/95.jpg)

Jack Guarnieri

Jack began and ended his seminar in which he updated the audience on the latest happenings at the Lakewood, NJ factory, the production of *The Wizard of Oz* and *The Hobbit*, and development on their upcoming third game designed by Pat Lawlor.

Jack was joined by Butch Peel and David Thiel who both talked about *The Hobbit* and the work they had done on the game.

Butch described the new player and operator features in the game and how it further develops the innovations introduced in *The Wizard of Oz*.

[![Butch Peel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/98.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/98.jpg)

Butch Peel

David played several of the music tracks and effects from *The Hobbit*, and spoke about how he joined the project with certain musical assets already created, as well as the work still remaining to complete it.

Jim Schelberg from the *Pingame Journal* had put together a selection of pinball-related clips from the media, and at 8pm these were played on the large-screen monitors for guests to drop-in and watch.

The Classics PinGolf Tournament concluded on Saturday evening when the top eighteen qualifiers played head-to-head games on randomly-drawn machines in a three-strikes-and-you’re-out format.

The show continued until 11pm at which point the machines were switched off and the hall emptied in preparation for the final, shorter day on Sunday.

SUNDAY

Doors opened at 9am on Sunday with the quarter-final rounds of the main Match-Play Tournament and the first games in the Rookie Knockout Tournament starting soon after.

[![The Match-Play Tournament continued on Sunday morning at 9am](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/102.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/102.jpg)

The Match-Play Tournament continued on Sunday morning at 9am

The top seven players from each of the five qualifying rounds played on Friday and Saturday qualified for Sunday’s rounds, with the winner of each qualifying round going straight into the semi-finals.

[![Match-Play quarter-finals](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/101.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/101.jpg)

Match-Play quarter-finals

The remaining thirty players took part in the quarter-final which continued the match-play format with ten groups of three. Each group played a single three-player game with points awarded for finishing position. The groups were then shuffled and a second game played on different machines. This continued until four games had been played, when the sixteen players with the most points moved on to the semi-finals.

Meanwhile, the Rookie Tournament for players ranked below the top 1,700 began on the Classics machines before moving over to the same machines as the Match-Play Tournament once the initial rounds were over and the number of machines needed had been reduced.

After playing through the quarter- and semi-finals, the final three in the Match-Play Tournament A Division were Dave Stewart, Germain Mariolle and Bob Matthews. They played the final on Spider-Man, The Shadow and Twilight Zone.

[![The A Division final of the Match-Play Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/112.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/nwpas-2016/112.jpg)

The A Division final of the Match-Play Tournament

They played a three-game final in what was called multi-match-play, where all three start together on separate machines and swap to the next machine when it is their turn to play. Points were awarded for position in each game.

This resulted in a much quicker final than if each game had been played sequentially, but also lost some of the climactic feel of a final, since spectators had to keep track of all the points earned by each player.

The B Division final took place alongside the A Division and was played in the same manner.

The A and B Division finals

In the A Division it was Germain who scored the most points in the final to take first place. Bob Matthews was second, with Dave Stewart third. In the B Division Dave Mercier triumphed, ahead of Jeff DeBock and Eric Morales.

This year the recipient was Yarhed Shella, a maths and mechanical engineering student at the University of Washington. Yarhed received a $5,000 scholarship to aid his studies.
