**Date:** 27th-29th August, 2021
**Location:** Mercure Daventry Court Hotel, Sedgemoor Way, Daventry NN11 0SG, UK

After the 2020 show had to be cancelled due to the pandemic, [UKPinfest](http://www.ukpinfest.com/) was back at the [Mercure Daventry Court Hotel](https://all.accor.com/ssr/app/mercure/hotels/daventry-nn11-uk/mer/index.en.shtml) for 2021.

The Mercure Daventry Court Hotel – home of UK Pinfest

Held over the bank (public) holiday weekend at the end of August, UKPinfest is a pure pinball event featuring over 100 pinballs, a few vendor stands and multiple tournaments. It’s as much a social event as a pinball-playing one and, after missing out on so much in 2020, everyone was eager to see all the familiar faces again and catch up on everything that’s happened over the past two years.

To help facilitate that, the hotel has two bars – one in the lobby and another in the main show hall. There is a separate restaurant serving breakfast for hotel guests and a pop-up hot and cold food service in the bar at lunchtime and in the evening. Food could also be ordered at the bar throughout the day.

With reasonable weather over the weekend, the courtyard area was also a popular place to gather and socialise.

Back in the lobby, four of the latest pinball machines were brought in just for the show, provided by [Pinball Heaven](https://www.pinball.co.uk/). We arrived on Friday lunchtime just as they were being set up.

The left two games – *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* and *The Mandalorian* (Premium) were for the youth and adult High Score Tournaments respectively, while the *The Avengers – Infinity Quest* and the second *The Mandalorian* (this time a Pro) were on pay-to-play for charity at a cost of £1 ($1.38/€1.17) per game.

UK Pinfest Battle machines

Along the side wall were three *NBA Fastbreak* machines used for the NBA Challenge which cost £5 to enter. These were provided by [Northern Lights Pinball](http://www.ukpinball.com/) with the tournament run by the [Scottish Pinball Association](http://scottishpinball.org.uk/).

[![The NBA Challenge machines](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/052-ukpinfest-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/052-ukpinfest-2021.jpg)

The NBA Challenge machines

Two of these machines were linked and head-to-head matches were played by the 24 players who were split into six groups of four, with everyone playing a game against the other three people in their group. The top two players in each group then continued to the play-offs on Sunday morning. The remaining *NBA Fastbreak* machine was used as a spare in case of any issues with the other two machines.

Trophies for the top players in the NBA Challenge

There was an additional competitive event held on Friday and Saturday nights. Neil McRae of [Domino Arcade](https://www.facebook.com/dominoarcadeuk/) organised the free Stall Ball competition on a *The Shadow* machine.

[![The Shadow was used for Stallball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/033-ukpinfest-2021-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/033-ukpinfest-2021.jpg)

The Shadow was used for Stall Ball

In Stall Ball, players line up to play the machine. As it becomes their turn to play, they have to lock a ball in either a ball lock or a saucer without draining.

[![Playing Stall Ball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/054-ukpinfest-2021-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/054-ukpinfest-2021.jpg)

Playing Stall Ball

Once they do that, they leave the machine and return to the back of the line to play again. If they drain, they are out of the competition.

[![Part of the line to play Stall Ball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/053-ukpinfest-2021-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/053-ukpinfest-2021.jpg)

Part of the line to play Stall Ball

There was a long line to play each night, but once the competition began the line moved pretty fast, and as more players were eliminated the line became shorter until just two players remained. As soon as one of them drained, the other was the winner. Neil provided a nice selection of prizes, with the winner receiving a new iPhone.

[![We have a winner!](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/055-ukpinfest-2021-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/055-ukpinfest-2021.jpg)

The NBA Challenge was over-subscribed with several youngsters amongst those who missed out. So, an ad-hoc Junior Division was formed and played out on Sunday morning.

The winner of that was Daniel Vince.

That left just the UKPinfest Battle tournament to complete.

Qualifying entries consisted of three games on machines of the player’s choice from the ten available. Scores were ranked on each machine and points awarded. The total of the points from all three machines made up the complete entry. Only the best entry for each player counted, but unlimited entries could be bought during the qualifying hours.

The top 24 players qualified for the play-offs, with the top eight getting a bye through the first round.

The play-offs consisted of head-to-head best-of-three matches on pre-selected machines.

There were some very close scores – especially on High Speed 2 – which meant that the winner would be decided on the final game, Led Zeppelin.

[![Craig Pullen had a narrow victory on High Speed 2 - The Getaway](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/080-ukpinfest-2021-732x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/ukpinfest-2021/080-ukpinfest-2021.jpg)

William Dutton won the third game with 365M which was enough for him to take second place. The winner, though, was Craig Pullen whose second place on Led Zeppelin with 349M earned him enough points to secure first place. Paul Owen was third and Andreas Bernard fourth. Along with a trophy, Craig took home a £610 cash prize for his victory. The second place prize was £335, third place received £250 and fourth place £165. Fifth to eighth places each received £80 cash prizes.

You can watch the qualifying games and the final of the UKPinfest Battle on the [Pinball Live Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/pinball_live).

Although the show officially closed at 4:30pm, the final of the tournament ran until 5:30pm. Show organiser Philip Murphy then thanked everyone who contributed to making the show a success and drew proceedings to a close. The break down and clearance of the machines could then begin.

There was definitely some trepidation from visitors about attending a mass indoor gathering such as UKPinfest while Covid infections are still widespread, and time will tell how safe it ultimately was. However, although guest numbers were markedly down on the previous show in 2019, it was still both a social and financial success. There was clearly a huge appetite for the resumption of pinball gatherings, not only for the social side but also for the opportunity to play some of the more recent titles.

Interestingly, after having played the newest games we heard the same comments over and over; that the rules have become too complicated and unintuitive, that they are written by top players for other top players, and average players are simply giving up on ever hoping to learn them.

Fortunately, a show such as UKPinfest provides a wide range of games from electromechanical to the latest LCD models, so there’s something for everyone to enjoy.

The reduced visitor numbers meant it was easy to find a machine to play and only a short wait if your chosen game was currently occupied. Plus, the hall was never too crowded or hot. In fact, for a visitor, the numbers were just about perfect.

Finally, here’s our exclusive Ten Minute Tour video as we walk around the show floor and the other pinball areas around the hotel.
