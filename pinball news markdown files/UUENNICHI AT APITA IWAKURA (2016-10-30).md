**Date:**
25th June, 2016

**Location:**
2nd Floor, 1-25 asahimachi, Aichi Prefecture, Iwakura-Shi, Japan

**After staying in the Osaka city for three days, I continued my trip to Nagoya city.**

In the morning of my first day, my good friend Mr. Takeda drove me to my first pinball location in the city.

On the road towards Nagoya

It took around half-an-hour to reach this pinball location – Uuennichi @ Apita Iwakura shop, which is one of the new pinball locations near Nagoya city this year.

Uuennichi @ Apita Iwakura

Since the game centre is quite small, it is easy to spot the four pinball games.

* *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (Williams, 1991)
* *Hurricane* (Williams, 1991)
* *Creature from the Black Lagoon* (Bally, 1992)
* *World Cup Soccer* (Bally, 1994)

The four pinballs

It was amazing since this was my first time seeing the *Hurricane* game. Although I could not get the high score on it, I still felt it is a very fun game.
