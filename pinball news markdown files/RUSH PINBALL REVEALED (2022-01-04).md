Stern Pinball today revealed their latest cornerstone title, *Rush*, based on the popular and well-known Canadian rock band.

Stern Pinball’s new Rush pinball

The game is designed by John Borg with programming led by Tim Sexton. It includes sixteen of the band’s tracks as well as custom callouts recorded by band members Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee. Additional callouts come from Barenaked Ladies frontman and fellow Canadian, Ed Robertson, making a total of 600 individual voice calls.

The sixteen tracks included in the game are:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 2112 | Headlong Fight |
| Bastille Day | La Villa Stranglatto |
| Big Money | Fly By Night |
| Cygnus X-1 | One Little Victory |
| Far Cry | Red Barchetta |
| Fly By Night | Subdivisions |
| Free Will | Working Man |
|  |  |

The Rush pinball set list

The game uses concert footage to supplement to music along with multiple custom animations from the graphics team at Stern.

As with most cornerstone titles, *Rush* is available in three variants – Pro, Premium and Limited Edition. Let’s take a look at all three starting with the Pro.

**Pro Model**

The Pro model’s translite artwork

The artwork for all three models comes from Michael Barnard of Sunburn Designs. After trying to contacting Stern several times without success, Michael finally got offered the opportunity to pitch for the Rush project and in August 2020 his concept was the one chosen for the game. He then developed it over the following twelve months to create the cabinet, backbox, translite, playfield, plastics and decal artwork packages for the three models we see here.

**Premium Model**

The Limited Edition model’s backglass artwork

As usual, the Pro is the more basic, operator-friendly model, while the Premium and Limited Edition models add extra playfield mechanisms and features. Usually the Premium and Limited Edition models share the same playfield, but with *Rush*, as with *Led Zeppelin*, the LE gets the additional ‘Expression Light System’ build into the cabinet interior sides.

The Limited Edition model is restricted to 1,000 units which will have the following additional features.

* Expression Light System™included (not as an accessory)
* High gloss guitar shaped side armour, legs, hinges, and front molding
* Mirrored backglass
* Reflective foil cabinet decals
* Upgraded audio system
* Shaker motor
* Non-glare playfield glass
* Certificate of authenticity signed by Gary Stern
* Designer autograph on the bottom apron
* Sequentially numbered (1 to 1,000) plate

[![The Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/002-rush-1024x615.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/002-rush.jpg)

The Pro, Premium and Limited Edition models

All models come equipped with Stern’s Insider Connected QR code reader built into the bottom apron and the associated software to connect the game to Stern’s servers for score and achievement recording, software downloads and in-game analytics.

The MSRPs (suggested prices) for the three models in the US are:

* Pro – $6,899
* Premium – $8,999
* Limited Edition – $11,099

The Pro and Premium prices are the same as *Godzilla*, but the Limited Edition price has increased. Limited Edition versions of almost all recently-released games have rapidly sold out with some buyers offering them for resale at higher prices than originally paid.

Let’s take a look at the playfields, starting with the Pro.

[![The Pro model's playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/104-rush-570x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/104-rush.jpg)

The Pro model’s playfield

*Rush* is a three-flippered, single-level, standard-width game with two inlanes on the bottom-right and one on the bottom-left, moving the centre-line of the game over to the left.

[![The two main flippers on the Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/108-rush.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/108-rush.jpg)

The bottom-right of the playfield

Above the two main flippers are the progress inserts and portraits of the three key band members, Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart and Geddy Lee.

[![The bottom-centre of the playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/109-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/109-rush.jpg)

The bottom-centre of the playfield

Sadly, Neil Peart died on 7th January 2020 at the age of 67 following a lengthy battle with glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer.

[![The progress inserts](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/112-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/112-rush.jpg)

The progress inserts

There are three ‘instrument’ drop targets corresponding to the three key band members – bass guitar, lead guitar and drums.

[![The three instrument drop targets](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/113-rush-1024x659.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/113-rush.jpg)

The three instrument drop targets

Behind the left-most drop target is a stand-up target which starts a multiball mode. On the upper two models this is replaces by a ball lock mechanism to create a captive ball device.

On the right side is a bank of four R-U-S-H standup targets.

[![The R-U-S-H standup targets](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/114-rush-1024x636.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/114-rush.jpg)

The R-U-S-H standup targets

Mid-way up the playfield is a double scoop which can be shot from the front or from the side by the upper-right flipper.

[![The upper-right flipper](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/126-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/126-rush.jpg)

The upper-right flipper

The double scoop

The scoop feeds an underground ball lock which has a small window to show locked balls. Locked balls are ejected out of both scoops once multiball begins.

[![The front shot into the double scoop](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/115-rush-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/115-rush.jpg)

The front shot into the double scoop with the locked balls window on the right

On the left of the scoop are the game’s three pop bumpers, with a shot through them into the outer orbit lane.

[![The pop bumpers and left outer orbit laner](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/125-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/125-rush.jpg)

The pop bumpers and left outer orbit lane

The main ‘toy’ is the Time Machine at the top-centre. This works like the ‘ring’ in *The Lord of the Rings*, in that players can shoot the ball through it, or the ball can be held within it and then thrown out by a circular electromagnetic coil.

[![The top-centre of the playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/124-rush-1024x730.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/124-rush.jpg)

The top-centre of the playfield

There is a fixed ramp leading into the Time Machine. On the upper two models the ramp is motorised with an additional target below which can be accessed when the ramp is lowered.

[![The Time Machine device](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/123-rush-1024x829.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/123-rush.jpg)

The Time Machine device

[![The Time Machine at the top of the playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/119-rush-1024x783.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/119-rush.jpg)

The Time Machine at the top of the playfield

There is a side ramp shot and an inner orbit lane which can also be shot from the upper flipper. In addition, a short upper lane to the left of the Time Machine leads to a standup target on the Pro. On The Premium and Limited Edition there is a saucer with an upkicker feeding another wireform instead.

[![Shots at the top of the playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/121-rush-1024x661.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/121-rush.jpg)

Shots at the top of the playfield

To the right of the Tim Machine is the other inner orbit lane which includes the Spirit of Radio optical spinner, and the right ramp which includes a laser-cut Rush logo.

[![The Spirit of Radio spinner and right ramp](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/122-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/122-rush.jpg)

The Spirit of Radio spinner, right ramp and right orbit

Both the side ramp and the right ramp feed to a common point behind the Time Machine were a diverter can send the ball to either the left or right return ramps and into their respective inlanes.

The Premium and Limited Edition playfield features and designs are the same with the exception of the Expression Light System which is included on the LE.

The Limited Edition model’s playfield

The Limited Edition has some additional ‘bling’, such as the signed bottom apron, numbered plaque and a more integrated Insider Connected scanner.

The Limited Edition playfield

As we said earlier, the Premium and LE have a motorised ramp in front of the Time Machine which rises to allow shots into the ring.

[![The Time Machine from the LE model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/309-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/309-rush.jpg)

The back panel artwork behind the Time Machine

The right ramp is the same on the Premium and LE models as on the Pro, with a plastic return ramp to the right inlane.

[![The right ramp on the LE model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/312-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/312-rush.jpg)

The right ramp disappears behind the back panel

The right bank of standups is also the same as the one found on the Pro.

[![The LE's R-U-S-H target bank](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/314-rush-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/314-rush.jpg)

The LE’s R-U-S-H target bank

Another difference from the Pro we noted earlier is the inner lane next to the Time Machine. Where the Pro has a standup target at the end of the lane, the Premium & LE have a saucer with an upkicker.

[![The upkicker onto the left ramp return wireform](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/327-rush-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/327-rush.jpg)

The upkicker onto the left ramp return wireform

One of the other two remaining major playfield changes compared to the Pro is the Clockwork Angels clock moulded into a bass drum mounted over the pop bumpers.

[![The Clockwork Angels clock](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/324-rush-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/324-rush.jpg)

The Clockwork Angels clock

This advances with pop bumper hits and when the hour hand reaches midnight a multiball mode begins.

[![The Clockwork Angels drum](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/323-rush-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/323-rush.jpg)

The Clockwork Angels clock bass drum

The other Premium/LE feature enhancement is the ball lock behind the instruments drop targets.

[![The ball lock behind the drop targets](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/313-rush-1024x715.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/313-rush.jpg)

The ball lock behind the drop targets

When the targets are down, a ball can be shot behind the left target where two prongs hold it as a captive ball to start multiball.

The Expression Light System first seen on *Led Zeppelin* makes a return on the Limited Edition version of *Rush*. Incorporated into the cabinet sides, it aligns with lights on the game’s side blades. There are no videos of the lights in action yet, so we suspect this feature is still being programmed.

[![The Expression Light System is mounted in the cabinet sides](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/321-rush-683x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/rush/321-rush.jpg)

This game is Rock N’ Roll.  John Borg and Tim Sexton have built *RUSH*pinball around these iconic *RUSH*songs and *RUSH*symbols. A ramp leads to a custom molded *RUSH*electromagnet Time Machine, holding and then expelling balls out forward and back. The 3-bank drop targets are coded to collect guitar, bass, and drums. Rules are visually portrayed with R-U-S-H spell out target, 1-2-3 arrows, 17 RGB lit inserts, and 3 RGB pop bumpers. Its two large metal and plastic ramps include a player and game controlled diverter, redirecting the ball to either return lane. Scoops facing the playfield front and side lead to an under playfield subway; players can view ball flow through an insert before the balls are kicked out the front scoop. Added to this are red and white GI lighting, 3 flippers, 4 main mulitballs, 6 main timed modes, and more. Games are ready to add the accessory Expression Lighting System, a must for a rock game.  The Premium/LE have important changes from the Pro. The Time Machine ramp is motorized, up and down, with custom lighting effects on its side and floor. Neil Peart’s drum is custom molded into a Clockwork Angels Clock, with motorized minute hand to stop at all 12 face numbers. Behind the drop targets is a ball lock post system, using a captured ball as a Newton ball. The under-playfield subway can lock balls and kick out the side scoop in addition to the front scoop, kicking balls out both at once. An added VUK fires the ball up a wire ramp. GI lighting is red and white plus blue.   Stern will make 1,000 Limited Edition games featuring these enhancements and collectibles:   Expression Light System™ – included, not as an accessory High gloss guitar shaped side armor, legs, hinges, and front molding Mirrored backglass Reflective foil cabinet decals Upgraded audio system Shaker motor Non-glare playfield glass Certificate of authenticity signed by me Designer autograph Sequentially numbered (1 to 1,000) plate  *RUSH* will ship equipped for Insider Connected™. Another new title with all games fully equipped for connectivity is essential to achieving the greatest early Insider Connected adoption and fastest success. All Stern commercial LCD games are being manufactured equipped for Insider Connected. We have shipped thousands of kits to upgrade earlier Stern LCD games with Insider Connected. We will ship thousands more starting this month. Near 20,000 players are registered. Thousands of games are connected, half in commercial locations.  On New Years’ Eve Day we stopped production to take year end inventory. We will resume production during the second week of January with *RUSH* Pro. We will follow later in January with *RUSH* LE, then in February *RUSH* Premium. We increased our production rate in December, and we are staffed and have parts to increase it more.  We again ask that our USA customers help us dedicate the first Pro models produced for commercial use. This is a good policy for international customers also. More people can see and play a new game on location than can see it in someone’s home.  The wholesale *RUSH* Pro and Premium prices will be the same as *Godzilla,*in spite of continued supply chain cost increases.As previously announced, all other Pro and Premium models will also be the same prices. Contact your sales rep regarding any order impact. The *RUSH* LE price is increased; your sales rep will contact you with details. As normal, full LE payment is due with order and without cash discounts. Costs for specifying an LE number remain the same.  A new UMRP, MAP and MSRP list will be sent to USA customers shortly. The USA MSRP’s are as follows:       Pro                                  $  6,899 Premium                         $  8,999 Limited Edition                $ 11,099                 A full line of accessories will be available. We will provide you separately with dates for art blades, side armor, shooter rods, toppers, and Expression Lighting Kits for Pro and Premium.  I have a preproduction *RUSH* in my apartment. It plays absolutely great! Watch the *RUSH* game play video over and over, both on our webinar and on Stern sites. Get the game on your showroom floor. You will agree — *RUSH* pinball is Rock N’ Roll*.*                                                                                                                                     Best regards,   Gary |
