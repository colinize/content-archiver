With the coming week seeing at least two new game launches and another poised to launch soon after, Stern Pinball, Jersey Jack Pinball and Barrels of Fun have all started teasing their next releases.

**JERSEY JACK PINBALL**

[Jersey Jack Pinball](https://www.jerseyjackpinball.com/) were first off the blocks with Jack Guarnieri’s confirmation at the [Texas Pinball Festival](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2025/03/20/texas-pinball-festival-2025/) that their upcoming game would be based on the Harry Potter franchise.

Jack then spoke more about the Harry Potter licence, the planned tiers of game available, the assets they had to work with, and much more in the latest edition of the [Pinball News and Pinball Magazine Pinball Industry News PINcast](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2025/04/02/march-2025-pincast/).

That was followed by JJP distributors opening up their pre-order lists and confirmation of the three models along with their pricing.

[Barrels of Fun](https://shop.kollectfun.com/) have scheduled the reveal of their second game – including the title – two days after Stern’s reveal. Game two should be announced on Thursday 17th April, 2025. Pinball News was given a preview of the new game at the Barrels of Fun factory in March, but the the team working it have managed to keep details of the title and playfield features a closely-guarded secret.

However, they have been teasing some aspects of what will come with the game, using the hashtag **#INCLUDED!** to promote the extra value included as standard.

Those extras include a new shaker motor, anti-reflective glass, and the company’s new Horizon Lighting interactive playfield perimeter lighting system.
