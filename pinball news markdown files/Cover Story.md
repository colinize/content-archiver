Pinball has often been used as a theme for both music artists and the advertising industry. The latest appearance brings back the pinball motif to promote a compilation album, with a special version available to Chicagoland residents this weekend.

Chicago radio station WXRT has released a CD of live music from various bands every Christmas season for the past fifteen years to support local charities. Their most recent CD featured original pinball artwork throughout the packaging.

The ONXRT Live From The Archives Volume 15 CD is going to be released this Saturday, 19th April, as a special vinyl edition.

This limited-run double album  is being released  to help support   Record Store Day, and is part of a promotion of special run records to be available purely through record stores. The purpose is to get people out to shop at bricks-and-mortar record stores, rather than simply downloading music at home.

It is a rare event that a new vinyl album is made featuring original pinball artwork. The record can be purchased at the following record stores in the  Chicago area:

Laurie’s Planet of Sound: 4639 N Lincoln Ave, Chicago, IL 60625
Reckless Records Forest Park: 7511 Madison Street Forest Park, IL 60130
