Andrew Heighway of Heighway Pinball today announced a change in both the name and the theme of their first pinball product.

Circe's Animal House had previously been announced as their first release, but while the Greek goddess introduced numerous possibilities, the theme required some explanation to potential buyers and players.

Speaking at Pinball Expo in Chicago, Andrew today revealed that the Circe theme has been pushed back, and the game redesigned with a motorcycle racing theme, called Full Throttle.

Andrew said the whitewood testing of the first game lent itself to a much faster-paced theme. He also said feedback from operators suggested a more recognisable theme would be a better choice.

Andrew distributed a flyer of the new game which has been redesigned from the Circe's Animal House model, with new toys, additional shots and an extra ramp exit.

Meanwhile, Andrew also announced the joining of a new member of the design team - John Trudeau. John will be designing games for the company, marking his return to mainstream pinball manufacturing after several years out of the industry.
