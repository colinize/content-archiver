The press release announcing the purchased of American Pinball

American Pinball was set up at the end of 2015 by the Vassani family who own the electronics design and manufacturing business, Aimtron. It got off to a rocky start when, in an attempt to bring on board a big name designer, it partnered with John Popadiuk to make a *Houdini* design. In exchange, American Pinball provided manufacturing facilities for Popadiuk’s Zidware company to build the *Magic Girl* game.

While they looked beautiful, the *Magic Girl* games produced in the American Pinball factory were mostly unplayable due to basic design and manufacturing shortcomings. Likewise, the *Houdini: Master Mystery* design from John was deemed unplayable and was junked in favour of a new *Houdini* design by Joe Balcer. It was his design that eventually became American Pinball’s first release.

American Pinball has had a turbulent time of late. The company’s President and founder, Dhaval Vasani, left, with oversight of the business transferring to Aimtron head, Mukesh Vasani and his son, Nirmal. The business then moved from Streamwood to new premises in Palatine, co-locating with a new Aimtron manufacturing operation.

As parent company, Aimtron, headed towards floatation on the Indian stock market in June 2024, Mukesh became increasingly preoccupied wooing investors and preparing the business for partial public ownership. Approval for spending and investment decisions became harder to get, and day-to-day operations were divided between management heads with differing ideas about the company’s direction.

American Pinball’s position in the Aimtron family looked even more precarious when the floatation prospectus was published, showing American’s unimpressive recent financial performance. The company’s pinball design and production functions seemed increasingly at odds with the larger group’s operations.

Most American Pinball staff were laid off towards the end of 2024, including the Executive Vice President, David Fix, game designer Ryan McQuaid, mechanical engineer Zofia Ryan and rules designer Steven Bowden. Without anyone to design or build games, a new contract manufacturing business – Funsup Manufacturing – was formed to build arcade machines at the American Pinball facilities. The prototype of a new skeeball-style game, Whirl-O-Ball, was built at the Palatine factory.

Since then, although the company has been rebranded with a new logo and restructured to become a brand under a new Aimtron-owned parent, Orbit Games, no new pinball games have been produced and the next planned release, *Cuphead*, based on the Studio MDHR computer game, was mothballed despite the design being almost complete.

Now the company’s assets have been bought by JB Vincent LP who have pledged to bring new long-term investment to grow the brand and rebuild American Pinball design and manufacturing capabilities.

The company has recently been advertising for staff in a wide range of roles.

American Pinball’s social media post for job applicants

There has been some scepticism about the attractiveness of working for American Pinball, given their uncertain financial position and high staff turnover. This is highlighted as one of the first things new owner, J. Bryan Vincent wants to address.

He says, “*…our top priority is building trust in the company while fostering a positive and engaging culture for employees and customers.*“

Poor financial management and lack of investment in the business have both previously been cited as contributing to American Pinball’s demise. The new owner says he’s ready to fix both these, saying, “*JB Vincent is committed to providing the liquidity and every resource available to make American Pinball a market leader that is passionate about serving the pinball community.*“

While the purchase is of American Pinball’s assets, there is no detail yet on what that includes. However, the company says the positions advertised above are to work at their premises in Palatine, suggesting the design and manufacturing won’t be transferring to Texas or to another JB Vincent-managed facility.

Here’s the full text of the press release:
