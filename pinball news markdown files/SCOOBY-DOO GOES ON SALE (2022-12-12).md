**Date:** 11th December, 2022

Details of Spooky Pinball’s recently-announced new title, *Scooby-Doo Where Are You!* have been announced as the game has gone on sale via Spooky’s website and through their distributors.

There are three variants of the title – Standard, Blood Sucker and Collector’s Editions – with the Standard being the most cut-down and the Collector’s Edition having all the bells and whistles.

The Standard and Blood Sucker Editions feature a fairly basic cabinet art package, while the Collector’s Edition is more detailed. Here’s a look a the three versions.

So, what’s on the playfield?

Unusually, Spooky Pinball have created a wide-body design for *Scooby-Doo Where Are You*! There are several other novel design features too. Here’s the Collector’s Edition’s playfield.

[![The Scooby-Doo Where Are You! playfield](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/scooby-doo/004-scooby-doo-584x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/scooby-doo/004-scooby-doo.jpg)

The Scooby-Doo Where Are You! Collector’s Edition playfield

There are two ball locks as part of the bottom apron – one either side of the main flippers. These are fed by ramps and kick released balls out onto the flippers. There are LED indicators on the apron to show when a ball is locked.

Another unusual feature is the ability to have up to five players per game. Manufacturers are generally wary of increasing the number of players above four – even those it is much easier to do now there are fewer score display restrictions – simply because it means a longer delay between each player having their turn. However, *Scooby-Doo* has five main characters from which players pick when they start their game, so allowing five players seems like a natural fit.

Staying at the bottom of the playfield, there is a controlled drop target between the flippers to help save the ball, while on the right hand side the shooter lane is moved away from the playfield edge to allow for a long plastic with indicators colour-coded to each of the five characters. On the Collector’s Edition, the metal wireforms are also coloured to match the characters.

The top of the game is dominated by an upper playfield which features two full-size flippers, a bash toy and magnetic ball disruption.

The upper playfield

The ball would usually exit the upper playfield immediately, but the left upper flipper also incorporates a diverter which send the ball to the flippers instead.

The Captain Cutler diving helmet is the bash toy with a horseshoe orbit lane around it. There are also two ‘hand’ standup targets which activate an electromagnet to throw the ball around.

The Captain Cutler feature on the upper playfield

Shooting the bash toy sufficient times starts Captain Cutler Multiball mode.

Below the upper playfield is the Mystery Machine which can lock balls for Mystery Machine Multiball.

The differences between the three versions of *Scooby-Doo* are mostly cosmetic, with the playfield shots and features the same across all variants. The sculpted models seen above are only available on the Collector’s Edition which costs $9,769 plus tax and shipping where applicable. The middle Blood Sucker Edition is $1,000 less at $8,769, while the Standard Edition is another $1,000 cheaper at $7,769.

The $69 in the price relates to the year 1969 which was when *Scooby-Doo* was first aired. Also tied in to that year is the total number of *Scooby-Doo Where Are You!* games being made. While the split between Standard, Blood Sucker and Collector’s Editions depends on customers’ preferences, there is a hard overall limit of 1,969 *Scooby-Doo* machines being manufactured.

Here’s how the three versions compare:

Purchasing through the website required paid membership of Spooky’s Fang Club, but [distributors](https://shop.spookypinball.com/distributors-c7.php) also started taking orders at the same time without having to be a Fang Club member.

Each game order required a pre-paid, non-refundable, non-transferable deposit of $2,000 for the Collector’s Edition, $1,500 for the Blood Sucker Edition and $1,000 for the Standard Edition. Collector’s Editions will be built first, Standard Editions last. Buyers were warned that it could take up to eighteen months for Spooky to complete manufacturing of *Scooby-Doo* machines.

Initially there was going to be a live stream, but this was pushed back. Instead, a couple of videos were released with the first showing some of the game features while the second had a short section of gameplay.
