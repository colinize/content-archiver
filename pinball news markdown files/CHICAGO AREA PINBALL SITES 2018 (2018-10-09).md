**Date:**
October 2018

**Location:**
Various, Chicago, IL, USA

**Each year, just prior to Pinball Expo, Dan Marquardt updates his report on the best pinball sites in the Chicagoland area for those visiting the metropolis.  Here is his look at the pinball scene in the Windy City for 2018.**

It only gets better and better to go out and play pinball machines in the Chicago area. Mostly due to the continued popularity of barcades, there are numerous locations all over the Chicago area with fun pinball machines available to play.

Here is a list of the locations I have enjoyed visiting so far.  Some of the sites articles referenced are by M.G. Brown. [Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com/chicago) has many more locations listed on their website. They very kindly gave me permission to use information from their excellent website for some of my updates.
