The Dune backglass

*Dune* is a limited run of 1,000 units. 300 will be for sale directly by Barrels of Fun, with 700 going to distributors worldwide. Although they are ramping up production over the next month, the company plans to have built all 1,000 *Dune* game by the end of 2025.

There will be some extra accessories available to purchase once *Dune* machines begins shipping. These include an alternate backglass (as the company did with *Labyrinth*), a different, animated topper, and a Crysknife replacement shooter rod. A set of moulded slingshot covers is also planned.
