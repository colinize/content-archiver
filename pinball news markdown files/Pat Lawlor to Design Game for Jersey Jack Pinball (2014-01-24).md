It's been the subject of much speculation over the past few days, but today Jersey Jack Pinball officially announced that Pat Lawlor will come out of his pinball retirement to design a game for the company.

In a video message, Pat said Jersey Jack Pinball had "redefined the limits of pinball" and it was going to be "a wonderful experience and challenge" to be building the company's third game.

It will be an original theme - without a licence - something for which many pinball fans have been calling. No details of the game's subject or title were revealed, but Pat did introduce his long-time collaborator at Williams, Ted Estes - who has been working at JJP alongside Keith Johnson to develop the software and rules for The Wizard of Oz - and announced Ted would be working with him on the new game.

Here's the JJP announcement.
