Miniature arcade machine maker, [New Wave Toys](https://newwavetoys.com/), today revealed the first model in their new range of highly-detailed miniature pinballs sold under the *Replicade: Minipins* brand. The game is a special limited edition version of Gottlieb’s *Black Hole*.

Black Hole is the first model in the Minipins range

New Wave Toys already sell a wide range of *Replicade* arcade machines, including 1:6th scale versions of *Q\*Bert*, *Street Fighter II*, *1942* and *Dragon’s Lair*, as well as their *Replitronics* range which includes change machines and an upcoming *Zoltar Speaks* fortune teller. These are usually very popular and regularly sell out very rapidly.

New Wave Toys are renowned for both the detail of their replicas but also for their functionality. The video game cabinets have fully working games and controls built into them, while other models function in similar ways to their full-size counterparts such as drinks can dispenser machines which take miniature coins and dispense mini-cans.

Rather disappointingly, the [*Black Hole* Minipin](https://newwavetoys.com/products/black-hole-x-replicade-minipin) doesn’t have the ability to be played, either as a physical or a digital pinball game. However, it does have a full attract mode complete with speech, infinity backbox lighting, a lower illuminated playfield, a knocker and OLED score displays. The 12-inch high model also has the same fine level of detail throughout as the company’s previous reproductions, with a removeable backglass and a backbox you can open, a diecast metal coin door and even a miniature cash box.

Today’s launch of their *Black Hole* machine is the first of what is expected to be a series of *Minipins*. It is fully licensed from Gottlieb, so expect to see New Wave Toys release more Gottlieb titles reproduced in miniature form.

This first title costs $199 plus shipping, but there is a special promotional 20% discount for the 24-day limited edition pre-order window using the code MINIPIN.

New Wave Toys have released a video showing the game’s attract mode. Here it is:

The *Black Hole* model isn’t expected to ship until Halloween 2024, so you have plenty of time to build the excitement before it eventually arrives at your door.
