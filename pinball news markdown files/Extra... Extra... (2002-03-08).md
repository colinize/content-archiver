Story dated 8th March 2002.

Stern
Pinball Inc has produced its latest newsletter and predictably it
is mostly about their newest pinball game - Playboy.

The
original plan was to send out these newsletters once a month but those
ambitions have been scaled back to just three newsletters a year to
coincide with the production of each new game.

This
edition features a chat with Playboy designer George Gomez.

Hello again and welcome to The Second Stern Pinball
Newsletter

Everyone at Stern Pinball would like to thank
you for the amazing response to our last game, Monopoly™.
The Monopoly™ pinball machine not only reached the top
spot on both the RePlay and Play Meter Polls, it is now one
of Stern's best selling game to date! Thanks again and keep
flipping!

Further, Gary Stern was so excited with the success
of working with Pat Lawlor and his team on the Monopoly™
pinball machine that he invited some more former WMS superstars,
along with Stern's own incredible team of pinball designers,
to create Stern's newest game, Playboy. We hope that you welcome
these pinball greats back, and more so, we hope that you like
the Playboy pinball machine as much as we do.

Playboy

Designed by George Gomez (Monster Bash™), Stern employee
Dwight Sullivan (WhoDunnit™), and artist Kevin O'Connor
(Star Wars: Episode One®, Playboy: 35th Anniversary), the
Playboy pinball machine brings you the world's most beautiful
women in the lifestyle that can only be known as Playboy.

So recently, Stern News sat down with game designer George
Gomez and asked him a few questions about the Playboy pinball
machine, as well as a little of his own pinball history. Now
let's hear what's on George's mind these days.

Stern News: Welcome George, and thank you for taking the time
to talk to us. You just finished designing Stern Pinball's new
Playboy pinball machine. Could you tell us a little about it?

George Gomez: Playboy and pinball have always been a powerful
combination and I think that this game is the most exciting
version to date.

SN: Could you please explain in more detail the 'Interchangeable
Photo Inserts' that go on the playfield.

GG: Each target has the ability to reveal a beautiful girl.
The girls are represented in photo quality removable inserts
that are made from translite material and illuminated. The game
is shipped with several sets of photo inserts. The sets vary
in how much of the girls they reveal. In one set the photos
are very conservative and in the next the girls reveal a bit
more and of course there is a nude set. All of the inserts are
taken from actual Playboy photography so they are very high
quality and consistent with Playboy's high standards. This variety
allows the operator to swap inserts in order to adjust the game
to the location and the customer base.

(Editor's note: photo inserts for the playfield mechanisms
are interchangeable, allowing for appropriately rated images
to be applied to various environments.)

SN: How did you come up with the concept?

GG: I used to play the original Bally game years ago. There
was a bar downtown that had one and I remember thinking that
it would be fun to make the game as close to the actual magazine
as possible. When we were at WMS, my partner in this game, Dwight
Sullivan, wanted to do it on the Pinball 2000™ platform
but it was deemed too difficult at the time.

SN: Could you tell us the names of your favorite pinball machines
and what elements you like in them?

GG: In no particular order.Firepower 2™, Black Knight™,
Terminator 2®, Playboy, Medieval Madness™, Attack From
Mars™, Whirlwind™, Party Zone™, Monster Bash™,
RFM™, and Star Trek®. I love games that build in intensity
and games that make me work at mastering them. I like smooth
shooting, hook a lot of shots together and feel like a hero,
take a breather & bring on the next thing, collect cool
stuff kinds of games. I also love it when a game theme is thoroughly
executed. By that I mean that all of the elements: art, sounds,
choreography, fiction, and play mechanic need to be consistent
and well thought out. I never could get into those old games
where the art was applied as an after thought and the theme
may have been space but the play mechanic was a card game. I
didn't play pinball in that era and that's probably why. When
I was a kid I loved Marvel comics because the stories and the
art and the cover were all tied together, I despised D.C. comics
in the era when the stuff on the book cover had nothing to do
with the story inside.

SN: You're best known in the pinball community for designing
the Williams/Bally hit Monster Bash™. Tell us why you think
that pinball machine was such a monster hit?

GG: I think it represents what I described above. We made
the Monster toys compelling, the ball had fun kinetics in things
like bashing Frank and Drac, it had some smooth ramps like the
Bride ramp. The game had a lot of humor, which was a trademark
of the most successful games of that time. And of course the
pacing did what I referred to previously; it built the game
tension throughout the whole game. Every person on that team
stepped up and gave me their best stuff. It was a complete package.

SN: You are also generally credited with the idea for WMS'
Pinball 2000™. What led you to come up with that concept?

GG: Desperation, in a word. If the player base had disappeared,
it had to do with the fact that we were no longer entertaining
them. When you've designed a thousand ramps and created all
manners of game rules, you have to do something new. It was
simply an attempt to create a compelling new medium that would
include elements that were familiar and yet provide new ways
to play. By the way I always felt that we should retain both
the traditional and the 2000 lines of product. But that proved
economically unfeasible.

SN: Let's go back to the Playboy pinball machine. How would
you characterize this particular Playboy pinball machine with
the first two (Bally's Playboy; Data East's Playboy: 35th Anniversary)?
Is this a much more exciting game for the year 2002?

GG: I think this is the ultimate application of the theme.
The entire Playboy mystique revolves around these incredibly
beautiful and interesting women. We have made this game consistent
with that. We have for the first time focused on portraying
the very essence of Playboy. The previous games hinted at it
but stopped short of delivering on the promise. This game has
all of it.

SN: Last question. What was the first pinball machine you
ever played?

GG: I don't remember what it was called but it would have
been something from the sixties. I think it was a space theme,
and I think once I got beyond the concept that I had to keep
the ball in play, I focused on turning the lights on and trying
to get the ball to make its way everywhere on the playfield.
It was in a rec. room at an Air Force base somewhere out west.
I was on a cross-country trip with the Boy Scouts. I never imagined
then that this game would become such a significant part of
my life.

SN: Well thanks George for all of your insight. And we wish
you continued success, and much success with the new Playboy
pinball machine.

GG: Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to design this
game. It has been a privilege to work with all of the talent
in your company.

E-bay Charity Auction

Stern Pinball, Pat Lawlor Design, and Pinballsales.com would
like to thank Alexander and Lu Lu Woo for their wonderful bid
of $1825 on the November 20, 2001 auction to help all the brave
Americans in N.Y.C. through participating in eBay's Auction
for America. Alex and Lu Lu, and their friends (and runner-ups)
David and Mimi Silverman, enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Capri
Restaurant in Melrose Park, Illinois with Gary Stern, Pat Lawlor,
Steve White (editor of RePlay magazine), and Stern employees
Jolly Backer and Marc Schoenberg. Gary

and Pat filled everyone's ears with stories of the pinball business
and pinball design, as well as taking them on a factory tour
of Stern Pinball's 40,000 sq. ft. factory in Melrose, Illinois.
And to make the experience all the more noteworthy, Alex and
Lu Lu flew in all the way from Hong Kong, while David and Mimi
came from Silver Spring, Maryland for the lunch. The afternoon
became complete when everyone adjourned to the Stern gameroom
for a few hours of playing Playboy and MonopolyT. Again, thank
you to our new friends for their generosity, and thanks to eBay
and Jack Guarnieri of Pinballsales.com for making this all happen.

Tips & Tricks #2

USING YOUR ADJUSTABLE OUTLANE POSTS

Playboy Pinball is equipped with Adjustable Outlane Posts to
help earnings by increasing or decreasing the Average Ball Time.
Periodically check Audit 3, Average Ball Time. Ideally, 50-55
Seconds is suggested for best earnings. Moving the Left &
Right Adjustable Outlane Posts and adding or removing the Rubber
Rings from either or both Outlane & Mini-Posts will affect
this time.

Three Steps to Increase the Average Ball Time:

1. Add a 3/16" I.D. Rubber Ring to both Outlane Posts.

2. Move the Post down one (1) Position, "closing"
up the Outlanes.

3. Add a 3/8" O.D. Rubber Ring to both Mini-Posts.

Three (3) Steps to DECREASE the

Average Ball Time:

1. Remove the 3/8" O.D. Rubber Ring from both Mini-Posts.

2. Move the Post to the Top Position, "opening"
up the Outlanes.

3. Remove the 3/16" I.D. Rubber Ring from both Outlane
Posts.

Monitor your Audits (especially Audit 3) closely. For your
particular location, you will soon be able to determine the
best way to have your Posts positioned and with or without Rubber
Rings on your game. As players become better, more adjustments
may be required.
