Story  dated
July 16, 2004

Today saw the first of two auctions of the pinball games and parts belonging to the late Bob Thomson.  Bob died a couple of months ago after a struggle with cancer and was well known in the amusement industry in the UK.

He owned and ran Paradise Amusements which many readers will know from its former name of Pinball Paradise.  His family decided to sell off his inventory of pinball games, video games and spares, so this auction disposed of around half the games - all pinball machines - along with many of the parts and spare playfields.

The auction was held at Bob's warehouse at Bordon, north Hampshire.  Upon entering it was clear what a daunting number of games were kept in the unit and in another of the same size opposite.

There were over 300 pinball games in this auction and that only took care of the workshop and some of the ground floor of the storage unit.  There is still the rest of the store and the upper floor for the second auction on the 25th July.

The auction was to start at midday, but before that there were two hours for buyers to view the games.

As it turned out, for many people those two hours were used to rummage through all the parts available.

It impossible to describe the number of parts available, or their range, but despite the narrow walkways and high shelves, you could happily spend several days sorting through all this stuff and still  pull out little nuggets of gold.

Finding exactly what you needed wasn't that easy unless you're familiar with parts numbers, but most rack units turned up something of interest and occasionally you'd hit the mother lode - like the boxes of pristine manuals, schematics and operator booklets squirreled away.

The trouble is, after two hours we had boxes of parts; coils, switches, ramps, boards, manuals, semiconductors, springs, you name it - it was there.  But then the auction started and we hadn't even looked at the games.

Thankfully, the auction started late and there was time to do some quick investigative work.

None of the games were set up in any way.  They had no legs, they were all stood-up on their backs and many had their backboxes removed.  Most were also placed back to back and arranged in tight rows making it hard to see what you're bidding for.

So, you can't see the game and you can't see if it powers up.  You're largely bidding blind, so the prices reflected the huge degree of uncertainly involved.

Before the auction began there was one minute's silence in Bob's remembrance which was well respected.  In fact there was a very pleasant and respectful atmosphere with everyone mindful of the fact that the proceeds would go to Bob's wife and young child.

Despite the 400 lots, the whole auction took less than four hours including the time to relocate from the store to the workshop and back again for the different items.

There's no doubt that there were some excellent bargains to be picked up.  Around a dozen sold for the minimum £20 with the prize for highest price going to a Williams Defender at £850.

Along with the 300 games, there were also around 100 playfields auctioned off.  These ranged from near-bare wood to fully populated games.  Obviously the latter were great sources of coils, lamps, plastics and switches even if the actual playfield is of no use.  Once again, research was vital to avoid a surprise when you go to collect your goods.

Here is the full list of games and their selling prices.  Minimum game price was £20 and any games not reaching that level were held over to the next auction and not sold (£n/s).  Playfields were initially set at the same level but very quickly it emerged that a £5 minimum was more realistic so that was used instead.  Even then, many did not sell.

Blank lots were removed from this auction after the list of lots was drawn up. There was a 10% buyers premium but no tax was added.

For approximate conversion to US$, double the £ price.

Overall the auction went very smoothly. The 400 lots were dealt with  quickly and efficiently with the only delays occurring at the payment and collection point in the workshop. The advice to pay for your goods as early as possible was heeded by some but it's not always possible (if you're cataloguing all the prices for instance. :-)

The second auction takes place at the same location on the 25th of July. Full details of the items for sale will appear at the auction organiser's web site which is also the site of Antique Amusement Machines magazine.
