**Date:** 28th February, 2023

Stern Pinball have today formally announced their new *Foo Fighters* cornerstone release.

Designed by Jack Danger with art by Jeremy Packer (a.k.a. Zombie Yeti), there are the familiar Pro, Premium and Limited Edition versions available.

The Pro model was previewed in an e-mail sent out by the band earlier today in which they gave details of their upcoming tour dates.

Another standup in the right inlane

Above the right slingshot are two standup targets mounted at 90-degrees. However, the upper one is actually a kicker target, as seen in many Gottlieb/Premier electronic games.

The ‘Ka-Foom’ kicker target

There are some obvious extras on the playfield for the Limited Edition and the Premium (which shares the same playfield as the LE).

There is an upper mini-playfield with its own flipper and Area 51 building.

The Overlord toy is much enhanced on the Limited Edition

[![It is a molded toy rather than flat plastics](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/foo-fighters/306-foo-fighters-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/foo-fighters/306-foo-fighters.jpg)

It is a moulded toy rather than flat plastics, had a disruptor magnet beneath and shakes when hit

The Foo Fighters’ van is also a moulded toy in the LE and Premium games. It incorporates an up-post to lock the ball under the vehicle.

There is also a unique ‘death save’ post in the left outlane on the Premium and LE models. The ‘Deadpost’ is player-operated and can bounce a fast draining ball back onto the right flipper.

The Limited Edition has the special green metalwork and the Expression Lighting system built into the inner cabinet sides. This lighting system may become available for the Premium as a paid upgrade, although these lights have been on back order for the *Rush* game for quite some time.

Finally, we come to the intermediate Premium model which includes all the playfield features of the Limited Edition but lacks some of the extras such as the Expression Lighting system, the shaker motor, the anti-reflective playfield glass and the enhanced laser-cut metalwork.

After three days of teasing with videos and a playlist of music tracks, the full reveal began today, with a small number of Limited Edition models going on sale at 11am Central Time through the company’s web shop for paying All-Access members of their Insider Connected programme.

* Breakout
* Learn To Fly
* I’ll Stick Around
* This Is A Call
* Walk
* Holding Poison
* All My Life
* The Pretender
* Something From Nothing

* Best Of You

The prices of the three models have been announced as:

* Pro $6,999
* Prem $9,699
