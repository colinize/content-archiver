Best-in-show awards

At 2:30pm all the machines are turned off and prizes are awarded to the owners of the best machines in a number of categories.

First though, all machine donors are entered into a draw for cash prizes and donated goodies such as a translite and a Dead Man’s Hand tabletop game.

Time to start taking machines to the staging area for loading

The TPF show gets bigger every year – not just the numbers of machines and vendors, but also in stature with companies choosing the launch their new games or products there.  It has got to the point where pinball personalities attend the show even if they are not speaking or part of an official event.  It’s just a great place to hang out.

Then there is the number of visitors.  The show hotel now routinely sells out almost immediately the show promo code is announced, with adjacent hotels also getting a good number of bookings.  The hall was very busy on Saturday during the afternoon and evening, while the corridor outside was frequently packed with guests taking a break or getting refreshments.

Despite the packed schedule of events, the whole three days seemed to go without a hitch this year.  With events surrounding Pinball Expo causing uncertainty about that show’s organisation in 2018 and the establishment of Deeproot in San Antonio and Multimorphic being based in Austin, the Texas Pinball Festival is well positioned to take over as *the* number one pinball event.
