**Location:**
Dixon May Fair, 655 S 1st St, Dixon, CA 95620, USA

The Pin-A-Go-Go show is taking place at the May Fair Grounds in Dixon, California this weekend.  In [previous years](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2017/09/13/pin-a-go-go-2017/) PAGG was held in May, but with the group who had been running it setting up [their own show](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2018/05/20/golden-state-pinball-festival-2018/) in Lodi in May, PAGG has moved to this new October time.

The show runs across three days, starting at 2pm on Friday, but before the doors opened to the public Gary Flower was there to take pictures of the set-up for us.
