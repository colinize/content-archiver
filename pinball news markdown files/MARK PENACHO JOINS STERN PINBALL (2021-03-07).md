Mark was part of the *Mortal Kombat* team which went on to form the games development company Studio Gigante which created the titles *Tao Feng: Fist of the Lotus* and *WWE Wrestlemania 21* before closing in 2005.

Since then, Mark has developed software for high speed trading system before his appointment at Stern Pinball. His network and low-latency connectivity skills would appear to be a good fit at Stern as the company looks to launch its internet connectivity offer for features such as online software updates, remote diagnostics and networked gameplay.

Here’s the press release from Stern Pinball announcing Mark’s appointment:
