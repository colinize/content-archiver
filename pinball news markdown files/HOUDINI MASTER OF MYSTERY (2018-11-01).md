The new pinball manufacturing company, American Pinball, previewed their first title in a private room at a trade show in Las Vegas on September 2016, before showing it to a wider audience with a back-stage preview at Pinball Expo 2016.

The original Houdini playfield design

At this stage the game was titled, *Houdini: Master Mystery*, after the movie *The Master Mystery* in which Houdini starred.

This wasn’t to be the final design by any means, as it was based on an initial incomplete design by John Popadiuk who had previously worked with American Pinball to produce a small run of *Magic Girl* games, but it attracted a lot of attention and suggestions from all who saw it.

American Pinball’s in-house Game Designer, Joe Balcer, then took the game forward. Despite undertaking a complete re-design of the playfield, the company said they would have a working prototype available to play just six months later at the Texas Pinball Festival in March 2017.

True to their word, following the reveal of the re-designed, re-engineered and subtly re-titled game at the American Pinball seminar, two *Houdini: Master of Mystery* machines were set up on the show floor in Frisco.

Since that reveal in Texas, there were several modifications to the playfield design and the game’s artwork prior to the start of production, while the software, display animations and rules were all [significantly enhanced](https://www.american-pinball.com/support/updates/) both before and since production began.

The game has been a staple of the US pinball show circuit since Texas, while the company has added many [European distributors](https://www.american-pinball.com/distributors/) to their stable of 30+North American distributors.

*Houdini* runs on the P3ROC hardware platform from Multimorphic, a system American Pinball continued to use for their second title. The six-ball *Houdini* features two monitors, a 20-inch catapult throw into a trunk, three magnets, an animated stage curtain and custom theatre spotlights.
