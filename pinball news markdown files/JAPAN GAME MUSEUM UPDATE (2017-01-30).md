The Japan Game Museum (JGM) was the final destination of my Osaka-Nagoya trip in September 2016.

Major changes had been taking place at JGM. They were:

* JGM had been closed since January 2016.

* The JGM has become a warehouse of video games and pinballs.

The JGM’s new Grand Lizard

The chief of JGM, Mr Tsuji, is now planning a huge project to build a new and bigger JGM.   I hope that his dream can come true in the near future.
