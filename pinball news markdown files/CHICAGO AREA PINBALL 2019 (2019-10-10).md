*Editor’s note:*
*Every year, just before Pinball Expo, our correspondent Dan Marquardt brings us his selection of the best places in the Chicago area to play the silver ball. This year is no different, so anyone visiting the Windy City for the world’s biggest pinball show who finds themselves in need of even more of a pinball fix might like to check out his recommendations below.*
*Dan has made a change this year, ordering them so you can go from one location to the next closest, making it easier to find locations which are close to each other.*

It was twenty years ago Williams stopped making pinball machines. At that time I thought the days of playing pins on location were over for ever. It was bleak for finding a working pin on location for many years but now, due mostly to the popularity of barcades, pinball machines on location are plentiful in the Chicago area.

Thanks to [Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com/map?utf8=%E2%9C%93&address=Chicago) for allowing me to use their awesome website to update some of the locations on my list.
