The prolonged speculation about Steve Ritchie's future plans was resolved today when Stern Pinball announced he had joined the company as a staff game designer.

Steve Ritchie

Steve's company Steve Ritchie Productions was previously contracted to Stern Pinball to create pinball designs for game such as Terminator 3, Elvis and Spider-Man but this time he's joining the company as an employee and moving to live in the Chicago area.

There was  quite some animosity when Steve's previous time designing games for Stern Pinball came to an end, but all that has been put in the past and Steve is looking forward to his future with Stern.  He said,"I am elated to bring my 30  years of design and game experience to Stern Pinball and work as part of the  new Stern team... I am honored to work with  Gary Stern and Dave Peterson, along with the talented Stern staff on an  exciting new chapter in pinball history. Long Live Pinball!"

Gary Stern was equally positive about Steve joining the company.  He said, "We are all very excited  about Steve’s arrival at Stern.  Steve’s expertise in the art of pinball design and imaginative  work will take our machines and game design to a whole new level. Our goal at  Stern is to continually push the envelope of what is possible and has never  been done. Steve’s work is on par with that vision."

Gary comments suggest Stern may be looking to move away from the more simplistic game designs seen of late, possibly in response to the plans for fully-featured games from startup pinball company Jersey Jack Pinball.

Steve's arrival at Stern is certainly a boost for the company and for Steve himself, who has been out of pinball design since his game 24 was released over two years ago.
