Pinball shows are the times for  fans to gather and discuss pinball, play pinball, buy pinballs and compete on pinballs.  But for the non-pinball playing partners, the approach of another pinball show can be something to dread.

Pinball "widows" usually have to either grin and bear it or avoid traveling to the show altogether.

With this year's UK Pinball Show and European Pinball Championship approaching at the end of the month with record numbers of visitors and competitors expected, a group of pinball fans' partners have grouped together to provide some alternative entertainment during the show.

The Pinball WAGs (Wives And Girlfriends) are offering craft days, visits to local museums, art galleries and gardens along with shopping opportunities in nearby Northampton and Milton Keynes.

The idea was formed after the last UK Pinball Show and the organisers hope to put it into action in time for this year's event.

To help co-ordinate events they have launched the Pinball WAGs website with possible ideas and contact details.  The group is open to everyone partnering a pinball fan (male or female) and welcomes ideas about activities in which people might like to participate.

If the WAGs meeting proves to be popular it could be replicated at other pinball meets, helping to make them more family-friendly and reducing  pinball show-induced stress.

If you would like to join the Pinball WAGs or want any information about the activities on offer, either visit the website or e-mail Moira.
