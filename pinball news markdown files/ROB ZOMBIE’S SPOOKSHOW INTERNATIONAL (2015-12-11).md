**Welcome to the start of our coverage of [Spooky Pinball’s](http://www.spookypinball.com/) second game – *Rob Zombie’s Spookshow International*.**

The Standard translite image by Alex Horley

Although the Standard translite was revealed some weeks ago, today we got our first look at the full art package and the playfield shots and features.

In addition to the Standard translite there is also one for a Limited Edition model, which is also from Alex Horley. This will presumably feature the game’s title at the top in due course.

The Limited Edition translite artwork

The cabinet art, unusually, doesn’t include the name of the game. While the cabinet art is the same on both sides, the backbox imagery differs.

The cabinet front

The yellows and oranges on the cabinet seem to fit much better with the warmer tones of the Limited Edition translite rather than the colder-feeling Standard translite.

So what’s under the glass?

The playfield

The playfield is based on Spooky Pinball’s shelved game *Pinball Zombies from Beyond the Grave (PZfBtG)*, but apart from the art differences there have been extra toys added and the operation of some areas has changed.

The upper playfield with a mini-flipper from PZfBtG remains but is now Captain Spauling’s area from *House of 1,000 Corpses*, with new plastics, decorative toys of a skull pile, a gas pump and a bucket of fried chicken, and a rotating model of the Captain.

The upper playfield

There’s another rotating model down on the main playfield, as Murray the Robot from the *Dragula* video and *The Haunted World of El Superbeasto* sits on top of one of the game’s three pop bumpers.

A better look at Murray the Robot

Murray, like all the toys in the game, is modelled by Matt at Back Alley Creations, and another of his designs sits just in front of the lower pop bumper.

The final model is the Living Dead Girl who stands at the very back of the game and is viewed through a clear window.

Instead of a regular single-colour LED dot-matrix display, Rob Zombie’s Spookshow International features a colour LCD display in the usual place between the speakers in the backbox.

The Chroma-Corpse LCD

The software features six song modes, four sub-modes, a Hell Bound wizard mode, ten Rob Zombie songs, custom speech from Rob, Sheri Moon Zombie and Sid Haig, and a video mode from Ben Heck. Here’s a test video of it during development before any sounds were added.

The production run of 300 games fully sold out soon after the theme was announced at the [Rocky Mountain Pinball Showdown.](https://www.pinballnews.com/shows/rmps2015/index.html) However, here’s the game flyer anyway.

Finally, here’s the video from Spooky Pinball which was released a few hours ago, revealing the game’s playfield, art package and gameplay features.
