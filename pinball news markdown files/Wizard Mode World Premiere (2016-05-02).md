It’s not every day a new pinball  related documentary gets a world premiere at a major film festival, but here we  are in Toronto at the premiere of Wizard Mode, featuring 2016 PAPA World Champion Robert  Gagno.

It is a featured movie at HotDocs, North  America’s largest documentary film festival. The 2015 edition had attendance of  over 200,000; the 2016 edition has 232 films playing at 11 participating  theatres over the 11 day run of the festival.

The Toronto skyline

Toronto is Canada’s largest city  with over 2.6 million residents, and 5 million people in the Greater Toronto  area. It is the fourth most populous city in North America, after Mexico City,  New York and Los Angeles.

Toronto was once famously described  as “New York, run by the Swiss”, which is a descriptor most here wouldn’t argue  with. It’s a large city of distinct neighborhoods, with a very diverse immigrant  population and a thriving and vibrant downtown area, as well as being a home to  many cultural attractions and festivals. It regularly places on the top 10  lists of most livable cities in the world.

The Toronto area is also home to  several pinball leagues, in and out of the city.

Robert is Canadian but based in the  other side of Canada, 3,300 kilometers (2,100 miles) away in Vancouver. I was  aware of Robert, seeing the little Canadian flag on his name at the top of the  IFPA rankings, but knew nothing else about him and had never met him at any  pinball tournaments.

The past year or so there was an  awareness of this documentary as they worked on it, bringing to light Robert’s  autism. As a parent of two sons on the spectrum myself, Robert’s story hit us  close to home and some of his challenges were ones that we were already familiar  with from within our own family.

Robert has been a known competitor  within the pinball world for several years, and it seems most treat his autism  with a collective shrug. Competitors treat him just as another player, albeit  an exceptional one.

The timing of his PAPA World Championship  in 2016 couldn’t have been better, with the release of the movie only a month  later.

The movie promises to be more than a  pinball documentary; it’s more a human interest story about the challenges  Robert and his family have faced, while he’s obviously gone on to achieve great  things in his passionate pursuit.

Robert  visits Frolic’s Arcade

The day before the movie premiere,  just after Robert, his dad Maurizio, and the film crew arrived in Toronto, they  made a friendly visit to Frolic’s Arcade to play some pinball and loosen-up a  bit before the heavy week of film promotion and work that lay ahead.

The arcade is also home to the  Toronto Pinball Vixens, a monthly league open to 'non-dudes' (women and people  who don’t identify as men) as a way to promote pinball beyond the usual  demographic.

Frolic’s has a collection of mostly  new-release pinballs, including many of the latest LEs like Game of Thrones and  The Walking Dead, as well as Heighway’s Full Throttle and the Medieval Madness remake.

As the movie premiere approached,  Robert and his father, Maurizio, were invited to visit Frolic’s Arcade during  their visit to Toronto. There’s nothing like a little pinball socializing and  camaraderie when visiting a new city! They were joined on their visit by the  film makers, Jeff Petry and Nathan Drillot, and the editor of Wizard Mode, Greg  Ng.

It was a casual fun visit, joined by  a few local pinball collectors. Also in attendance were Gavin and Connor  Frolic, two young fans of Robert’s, who were thrilled to meet the first famous  person they’d ever met in real life.

Nathan was happy to play on some  mint machines and recounted their difficulty with getting additional footage of  pinball for the movie to match scenes from competition. A Tales from the Crypt was featured in the film, and the only one anywhere near Vancouver they could  find was a sad one on location that seemed to have had zero maintenance during  its entire life. It made recreating shots from the movie difficult when the  flippers didn’t even have enough power to get the ball up a ramp.

The entire crew had just flown in  from Vancouver the previous night  so they were all feeling a little jet-lagged,  as well as knowing a tough week of screenings and media awaited them. In light  of that it was nice that they were able to make time to come visit the arcade  and relax.

During their visit the initial seat  sale information came in regarding the upcoming premiere show; over 200 tickets  had been sold so far. That put their minds at ease, since as new film makers  they’d been worried about a potentially empty theatre and no one caring about  the movie.

Robert was able to demonstrate some  of his top skills to the young players, who were duly impressed. He set five grand  champion scores on the machines, which considering how many good players visit  Frolic’s is no simple achievement.

Maurizio commented that he liked  many of the décor decisions of Frolic’s, including the full wall mirror  creating an illusion of the arcade being double in size. He now hopes to do the  same thing in his home arcade later on.

Maurizio commented that he was  looking forward to the premiere the next day, as both he and Robert had not  seen the film and would be watching it for the first time with the entire  audience.

When asked whether it was nerve-racking to see their personal lives on screen, Maurizio responded that he was  happy to help other families and promote awareness of autism.

Premiere  Night

Wizard Mode was playing at the  ScotiaBank Theatre in downtown Toronto, which is one of the largest theatres in  Toronto.

The movie was playing in a large 350-seat  screen, and happened to be the same screen where I’d recently seen Star Wars. By  a casual head-count, the theatre was approximately 80% full. The filmmakers were  very happy with the turnout, especially since this was their first feature film  at HotDocs and a whole new experience for them.

Many local pinball fans were visible  in the audience, wearing various pinball T-shirts to show their connection.  However, the vast majority in attendance were clearly a general movie audience,  demonstrating the transcendental interest of Robert’s story with a wider  audience, far beyond regular pinball people.

During the the movie, which is 1  hour and 41 minutes long, they visit multiple large competitions, including several  years of PAPA and Pinburgh, as well as California Extreme.

The portrayal of competitive pinball  is very flattering and serious. It shows the competitions as being well  organized and attended, and puts a lot of weight on the story of Robert’s  pursuit to be a champion. Many of the top names and competitors we’re familiar  with in the world of competitive pinball are featured in the movie.

A lot of footage from the PAPA.tv broadcasts is shown, including commentary from people like Bowen Kerins. For  those that are part of competitive pinball and have seen the strides it has  taken in growth as well as execution, the movie is an affirmation of all that  work and effort.

Those of us aware of Robert’s  success in pinball have an outsiders view and knowledge of his performance, but  the movie really lets you in on how much difficulty Robert has had trying to  manage his frustrations when things don’t go the way he wants. It really takes  a toll on him, and is something he continues to try and work through.

As a pinhead watching the movie,  knowing Robert’s eventual success in competitive pinball, it removed a little of  the uneasiness I would have experienced watching Robert try and come short at  multiple events.

The movie was technically very  professionally produced. All aspects such as editing, music, and titles are very  polished, matching any well-made documentary. The film also does a fair bit of  travelling to different cities, and overall has a large feel to it.

There’s a fair bit of levity, mostly  from Robert’s whimsical nature, and sometimes the filmmakers have a little fun  with a title graphic or edit.

As much as we will talk about the  pinball part of the story, that side of it is actually the smaller story  compared to Robert trying to compete and win at life itself. His family is very  brave opening up their story for the world to see. Robert is the narrator of  the movie, featuring his first-person thoughts about how he’s feeling and what  he’s going through.

We’re along on the journey as he  continues to strive for independence, which is something he really wants but it  isn’t coming easy. Things like going on a grocery trip and preparing dinner are  life skills he’s working on.

There is a very cute segment of the  movie where Robert explains his difficulty in managing hugs. He likes them, but  has to learn about when it is appropriate to give and receive hugs, and whom he  should be giving them to or receiving them from. Turns out he has spent months  researching hugs and is now a hug expert.

We watch as Robert looks for and  finds work, experiencing earning his first paycheque and being around an office  and employees.

Maurizio has been Robert’s safety  net for much of his travelling and competitions, but during an interesting  segment of the movie Robert travels to Pittsburgh alone to compete at PAPA and  has to learn to manage to not have that immediate support around him. Sometimes  he turns to players next to him for affirmation or discussion of his game, only  to find out they weren’t paying attention, basically leaving him on his own.

That is not a negative towards any  of those people; it was clear this was a valuable lesson that Robert will have  to continue to learn, about independence and relying on himself.

Robert also discusses other hopes  and aspirations he has, much like any of us, to maybe get married and have a  family of his own, to have a driver’s license, and more than anything to just  be out there in the world to live on his own.

Robert’s PAPA World Championship win  was hastily edited into the final edit of the movie. Apparently some screener  DVDs of the movie were sent out before the PAPA win and are missing that  element of his story, but the final theatrical version includes footage from  PAPA 2016, and it will be on all digital versions of the film.

The filmmakers told me afterward  that it was kind of good that Robert didn’t win any large championships while  they were filming, as that might have steered the movie more into a straightforward  pinball documentary. Because they didn’t have their happy ending at the time,  the movie became more about Robert’s challenges and victories in his personal  life. The PAPA championship in the end almost becomes an addendum to the  personal growth he has worked on over the run of the movie.

When the credits rolled there was a  lengthy audience applause, and a few funny bits were thrown in at the end of  Robert wrestling with an album title’s play on words. You’ll also want to check  your ears to make sure you’re hearing the lyrics of Pinball Wizard properly at  the end as the titles roll.

As the lights came on, Jeff and  Nathan came back on stage and introduced their special guests that were in the  audience, Robert and Maurizio.

They then did a brief Q&A  segment. Funnily enough, someone brought up Mustang pinball while asking Robert  if he liked the game, which led to Maurizio recounting how the day previous  Robert had doubled the grand champion score on the Mustang at “a friend’s  arcade”, and then drained his last two balls so he could go play something else. You  can tell Maurizio will never tire of watching his son’s exceptional pinball  playing.

Maurizio got a little emotional  answering a question about the biggest misconception people have about Robert.

Jeff and Nathan asked the audience  to please vote for Wizard Mode for the HotDocs Audience Award, as it will help  raise awareness for the movie and open up more markets for it. Audience members  voted by tearing their ticket along a 1 to 5 number and deposited it in a box  on the way out.

The Q&A ended as the screen was  booked for another movie, so the audience left the theatre. The film makers,  Robert, and Maurizio hung out in the lobby posing for photos, as well as  signing some posters.

After the crowd dispersed, the film  makers made their way to an after party at a nearby establishment called Handle  Bar. The Google listing describes it as a “Buzzing lounge with a hipster vibe”.

Handle Bar is a small  bar, but in keeping with the theme of the movie, had a couple of pinballs.

Robert and Maurizio decided it was a  long enough day and they were unable to attend, but the film makers were there,  happy to relax now that their movie is out in the world.

Nathan commented to me that it meant  a lot to him to see so many pinball T-shirts in the audience and receive that  support from the local community. Jeff agreed that seeing an open and welcoming  pinball community was a common thread in every city that they visited, and he  was really impressed with the hobby and the people in it.

Wizard Mode will play two more times  as part of HotDocs, including a 'sensory screening' for people that have  difficulty with movie theatres, so the sound will be quieter and the lights left  on. This special screening is being put on with the help of a local autism  group, Autism Ontario.

Maurizio was looking forward to  doing some more tourist things with Robert over the week beyond their movie  obligations. They had already enjoyed some of the restaurants and attractions  like the CN Tower. I’m sure some more pinball will be squeezed in as well.

After HotDocs the crew are headed  back to Vancouver for the west coast premiere of the movie, which is already  sold out.

Besides some additional theatrical  dates in Canada, the movie is available right now as a pay-per-view digital  download through Vimeo, one of the film’s benefactors.

That concludes our coverage of the  Wizard Mode premiere. Congratulations to all those involved, it is a great human  story worthy of attention, and a great pinball story highlighting the growing  competitive pinball scene.
