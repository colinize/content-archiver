The two editions of Funhouse Remake

The Classic Edition uses the original artwork for the cabinet, backbox, translite and playfield, while the Limited Edition has Brian Allen’s reimagined artwork throughout, including on the playfield, the plastics , the speaker panel and the new inner cabinet artwork.

Both models include the mystery mirror 4-inch LCD panel introduced with Pedretti’s *Rudy’s Nightmare* 2.0 kit, while the manual ball plunger on the main shooter lane has been augmented with an autoplunger for use with the enhanced rulesets. Both versions use a 21.5-inch LCD display panel in place of the game’s original 2×16 digit alphanumeric displays.

Let’s look at both editions, starting with the Classic.
