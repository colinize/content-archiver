THE MR. & MRS. GORDON HASSE, Jr./

PACIFIC PINBALL MUSEUM

PINBALL COLLECTION

EAST COAST TO WEST COAST MIGRATION

Date: 9th July 2009

Report by Larry Zartarian

As the Board Chairman of the Pacific  Pinball Museum (PPM), I have been actively involved for the past 7 years or so  with a dozen other passionate and energetic Board members of the non-profit PPM  in Alameda, CA.

Our mission is to establish a permanent home for our 700+ pinball  machine collection somewhere here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Far from being a mere arcade, our goal is to  become “The Smithsonian of Pinball”, as our founder and Executive Director  Michael Schiess so often puts it.  In  other words, our aim is to educate and inform the public about the historical,  artistic, scientific and technological aspects of pinball – and the role it has  played as a truly unique American entertainment and art form.

About a year and a half ago, Mike and I  received a note from a very good friend of ours, noted pinball collector and  historian Gordon Hasse, Jr. (aka “Gordo”), who indicated that he was looking  for a good home for the collection of pinball machines and related coin  operated devices that he had amassed over a 35+ year period of collecting.  What’s more, Gordo had heard of what the PPM  was trying to accomplish and had decided that he wanted to donate his entire  collection of pinball and related coin-operated machines to us.

Although we had communicated briefly over  the years, and I had heard a lot about Gordo’s background as a noted author and  pinball historian, I really was not all that familiar with the extent of his  collection. But after speaking with Gordo at length, and finally meeting him in  person at our 2nd Annual Pacific Pinball Exhibition last October, it  immediately became apparent that we have a lot in common – not just our  admiration and respect for Gottlieb’s “Golden Age” pinballs of the 1940s and  1950s – but also our shared goals, objectives and the passion we have for  preserving pinball’s past and wanting to see it enjoyed by future generations.  Rather than languishing as unassembled hulks in  dark, cold and dusty warehouses, we believe that these gems should be restored  and refurbished to the best of our abilities so that they can be played and  enjoyed the way they were originally meant to be.

Being a very discriminating collector,  Gordo had managed to amass a collection that includes at least one working or  restorable example of every single-player Gottlieb woodrail pinball made from  1946 (Stage Door Canteen) through 1961 (Foto Finish), in addition to Gottlieb’s  first 4-player Super Jumbo and first 2-player Duette (176 titles in all), plus  12 Williams games from 1951-1955 (including Control Tower, Shoot the Moon,  Paratrooper, Twenty Grand, Grand Champion, Army/Navy and Wonderland); 17 other  games from various manufacturers (including Rockola, Genco, Victory Games,  Marvel, United, Exhibit and Chicago Coin); various related coin-operated amusement  machines (including Seeburg’s Shoot the Bear, 2 Scope-A-Tone Video Jukeboxes, a  Pop-Corn-Sez Popcorn Machine, and a 1952 Seeburg Model “G” Jukebox); along with  a 1938 Lusse Brothers Bumper Car and an original “D. Gottlieb & Co.”  Factory Sign.

As a noted pinball historian and author,  Gordo had also managed to accumulate over the years one of the world’s largest  archives of library-quality pinball and other coin-operated amusement machine  literature, photos, ephemera and memorabilia, including 40 bound volumes of The  Billboard magazine from 1948-1963; the complete collection of the late noted  pinball historian Richard Bueschel covering the history of pinball contained in  over 200 three-ring binders, and dozens of books related to pinball and allied  coin-operated amusement devices.  Gordo  has also taken responsibility for completing the unpublished volumes 3 through  6 of the Encyclopedia of Pinball that was entrusted to him by Richard Bueschel  prior to his death.

Once all the items in his collection had  been inventoried, we decided that the best time to accomplish the move would be  during the Spring or Summer months, as Gordo had stored his games’ backglasses  in bubble-wrapped cardboard boxes in Morrisville, PA; and the games’ heads and  bodies were being stored separately in Poughkeepsie, NY – a prime snow belt  location!

Mike and I flew from our homes in Oakland, CA  to Philadelphia, PA to meet Gordo, who had flown there from  his home in Orlando, FL to meet us  upon our arrival.

His brother, Pete, who lives in nearby Abington, PA,  met the three of us at the airport. Pete  had arranged for the rental of a 26-foot Penske truck that we would use for the  next 2 weeks.

From Abington, PA we drove  to Morrisville, PA, where we spent most of the next day loading the neatly  stored and arranged backglasses onto the Penske rental truck, and later that  evening we drove 170 miles to Poughkeepsie, NY where we began 2 days of opening  5 different storage units in LaGrangeville, PA that contained the games’ heads  and bodies.  The storage units were just  minutes from Steve Young’s Pinball Resource in nearby Poughkeepsie.

We were very fortunate to have the help of Mike Weitman and his  father Maurice, who both live approximately 2 hours away in New Jersey for our 2 days of opening and  emptying the contents of the 5 storage units.

Our main task was to move the various heads and bodies from the units  onto 2 separate 53-foot tractor trailers that were going to make the 3,000-mile  trek from Poughkeepsie, NY to Alameda,   CA over the next week.

While loading, we were also able to meet with  Steve Young.  Along the way, we had also  transferred all the backglasses from the Penske truck onto the two 53-foot  United Van Line 16-wheelers.

As we began to paw our way through Gordo’s  vast treasures, it immediately became apparent that this was no ordinary  collection.  Indeed, there was “Ali-Baba”,  peering at us from just inside the first roll-top door of the very first  storage unit, followed closely by “Flying Trapeze” (Gottlieb’s last pre-flipper  game), then “Marjorie” (named for David Gottlieb’s daughter), and eventually  the entire “Fairy Tale” series from 1947 and 1948 (“Humpty Dumpty”, “Lady Robin  Hood”, “Cinderella”, “Jack ‘N Jill”, “Olde King Cole”, “Ali Baba”, “Alice in  Wonderland”), followed by “Harvest Moon”, “Double-Shuffle”, and the almost  never-seen “Mermaid’ – just to name a few.

We were truly reduced to kids in a proverbial candy store, as our jaws  kept dropping as title after rare title was wheeled out of the storage units  and carefully placed onto the awaiting trucks.

After two days of loading, the two 53-foot  trucks were on their way for the cross-country journey from Poughkeepsie, NY  to Alameda, CA.   That night, we were able to visit Steve Young’s Pinball Resource and  were treated to a narrated guided tour of his amazing facility.

The two 53-foot trucks left for Alameda, CA  and arrived 3,000 miles and 5 days later.   In the meantime, I returned to my home in Oakland, CA,  but Mike and Gordo drove two days and 1,200 miles south to Orlando, FL  to pick up about 20 more machines plus backglasses and parts that Gordo had set  up at his home.

Jim Dietrick, PPM board member and owner of  The Pinball Revival Co., had flown to Orlando the previous  night to fill the vacancy that my departure had left.  Mike picked up Jim and began the last leg of  this daunting move.  After taking the  remaining games from Gordo’s Orlando, FL home in 100+ heat and humidity, Mike  and Jim set off for their 5 day, 3,000 mile journey to Alameda, CA, where they  would be met by many members of our PPM crew, including myself, Jem Gruber,  Helmut Jordt, Dan Fontes, Melissa Harmon (Mike’s wife), Tanio Klyce, Rob  Perica, and Gary Pratt and Dean Davidson (the two United Van Lines truck  drivers).  One day earlier, this same  crew of folks had managed to unload, store, map, photograph and catalogue the  entire collection from both of the large trucks.

Now, the task of restoration and  refurbishing many of these games begins!   As a result of the collaboration between Gordo and PPM, we have truly  become a world-class museum and are well on our way to becoming “The Smithsonian  of Pinball”.  The PPM collection now  includes many examples of early bagatelle games from the early 1900’s, many  “pin and ball” games from the late 1920’s and the 1930’s, and a nice sampling  of 1940’s, 1950’s, and 1960’s machines from the “Golden Age of Pinball”.  When you include hundreds of today’s modern  solid state and dot matrix display games, we are now approaching 700 machines.

We are hoping that Gordo’s generous  donation will spur local collectors to consider donating some of their machines  to us as well.  As it now stands, our  current Pacific Pinball Museum  is bursting at the seams and we are actively looking for a much larger  permanent home to house the entire collection.   Part of our fund-raising effort includes producing the annual Pacific  Pinball Exposition (PPE), with  over 400 games on free play.  It’s the  world’s largest pinball machine show, held each year in nearby San Rafael, CA,  and many of Gordo’s games will be on display and playable during this year’s  show.  We hope many Pinball News readers  will be able to attend, and also look forward to seeing you at our Pacific Pinball Museum  soon!
