September 2018

A rare steam train excursion trip passing through Blue Island Illinois in mid-September 2018 was a good excuse to revisit one of my favorite places to play pinball machines.

The Rock Island Public House at 13328 Olde Western Ave. in Blue Island is right next to the Rock Island commuter train line on which the steam excursion was running.

I watched the impressive steam train pass through town and then played some great pinball machines.

Rock Island Public House features seven well-maintained pinball machines.
