Following our earlier article about the Pro Pinball project to create a new game designed by Pat Lawlor with art from John Youssi, the Kickstarter project to provide the funding for this and the re-mastering of the existing Pro Pinball tables has begun today.

The Kickstarter page includes a video shot at the Silverball Studios base in the UK and at Pat Lawlor's home in Illinois, USA.

Introduced by Pro Pinball's co-creator Adrian Barritt, the video explains what they want to achieve and how the funding will be used.

While serious about the funding needed, the video also contains many humorous references, including a drive-by appearance by John Youssi.

The Kickstarter project will last for 30 days and is aiming to raise $400,000 or more in order to succeed.
