**Date:** 18th-21st November, 2021
**Location:** Sturbridge Host Hotel & Conference Center, 366 Main St
Sturbridge, MA 01566, USA

The final leg of our 2021 US tour brings us to the town of Sturbridge, around an hour’s drive west of Boston. The Sturbridge Host Hotel & Conference Center is the venue for the [Pintastic Pinball & Game Room Expo](https://pintasticnewengland.com/), hereafter just called Pintastic.

The entrance to the show

The Sturbridge Host Hotel and Conference Center is a complex of buildings housing the reception, the pavilions, a pool, numerous accommodation blocks, multiple conference rooms and at least two large show halls.

The hotel end of the complex

The complex has seen multiple expansions over the years, so there is a mix of styles across some of the different blocks.

Here’s a look around a few of these areas.

Pintastic has been running since 2015 and has [a large team](https://pintasticnewengland.com/about/) working in the months leading up to the show on its many different aspects, such as the free play machines, the vendors, the seminars, the publicity, the website, the logistics and so on.

For the free play machines they have built a custom game registration, check-in, game information and fault tracking system called MyFlipR which allows game bringers to register their machines, have them tracked as they are brought into the building and have any faults which develop logged against them for the maintenance crew to address.

The first of the show’s seminars began at 7pm when Levi Nayman hosted a talk and demonstration on how to do commentary for live streaming of pinball matches.

Levi Nayman

To illustrate his points, several matches were played on an *Attack from Mars* pinball which were streamed and had live commentary added. The first saw Bowen Kerins play against Mitch Curtis.

The Free Play Room stayed open until 2am and reopens on Friday at 10am, with the Vendor Hall also opening at 10am on Friday.

**Friday**

There were still more games arriving in the Free Play Room and others being worked on as the doors opened to the public at 10am. More are expected until around 1pm according to the organisers.

Meanwhile, the first of the days presentations was starting in the Seminars Room.

Tasker Smith, a Technical Instructor at MIT spoke about the concept of flow states and how they can be channelled to improve your gameplay and get into ‘the zone’.

[![Tasker Smith](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/035-pintastic-2021-1024x698.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/035-pintastic-2021.jpg)

Tasker Smith

He explained how, when a flow state is achieved, a person will experience a narrowing of their focus, how they become immersed in what’s happening now, will have a reduced sense of self-awareness, a distorted sense of time passing and achieve exceptional performance. He went on to describe the conditions and techniques players can use to take advantage of this state.

Tasker’s Flow States seminar

Later in the afternoon the seminars resumed at 2pm when Mike Minchew presented his seminar about pinball flyer collecting.

[![Mike Minchew](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/037-pintastic-2021-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/037-pintastic-2021.jpg)

Mike Minchew

Mike spoke about the way flyers evolved over the years and how the quality of their printing and production can be used to determine the relative financial positions of various companies. He also held regular quiz questions, distributing prize packs of flyers to those with the correct answers.

[![Mike talking about how flyers helped build the pinball industry](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/039-pintastic-2021-1024x685.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/039-pintastic-2021.jpg)

After Mike, Jersey Jack Pinball game designer, Eric Meunier, presented his story of the making of the Guns ‘N Roses pinball.

[![Eric Meunier](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/038-pintastic-2021-707x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/038-pintastic-2021.jpg)

Eric Meunier

Accompanied by a Collectors Edition model, Eric related stories about the creation of assorted elements which go to make up the game, including the collaboration with the band and Slash in particular, the recording of the voice calls, getting approval to use certain music tracks, how the cabinet and display artwork was created, the evolution of the playfield layout and getting sound effects which matched the pitch of the track currently playing.

Jersey Jack Pinball’s latest recruit to the game designer team is Mark Seiden who came from the work of homebrew games. Mark joined the panel for the next seminar which was hosted by Jillian Haffner and was all about the best ways and the pitfalls of creating your own homebrew custom machine.

The homebrew pinball discussion panel

All those on the panel had created their own custom game and shared their tip about the best operating system to use in order to programme it, what type of wood to use for the playfield and the best way to prototype a whitewood playfield before committing to the design.

The final seminar for Friday bean at 7pm when TNT Amusements head, Todd Tuckey brought along for of his crew to provide buying advice when purchasing a game, and how to spot a lemon.

[![Todd Tuckey](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/042-pintastic-2021-1024x684.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/042-pintastic-2021.jpg)

Todd Tuckey

After showing numerous examples of seemingly trashed games which had been brought to him for repair and refurbishment, he said the most import part of any machine when it came to condition is the cabinet, as that reveals how the game had been kept and maintained over the years.

[![The T.N.T. crew](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/043-pintastic-2021-1024x690.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/043-pintastic-2021.jpg)

Severe water damage might make the game beyond economic repair. After that, the condition of the boards and the playfield were both major indicators and give a good idea how much any repair or restoration will cost, assuming the parts are still available.

Todd’s talk, like all those taking place this weekend are planned to be released to watch on YouTube or similar soon after the show.

**Saturday**

There were plenty more seminars on Saturday starting at 9:30am with David Marston hosting a Breaking News section where several speakers were invited to update speakers on their latest news.

David Marston

The topics included a new Delaware Pinball Collective club, the latest from Daniel Spolar on the Project Pinball charity’s work installing pinball machines in children’s hospitals, and a discussion on the latest trends in coin-op seen at the recent IAAPA show in Orlando from a panel including David Fix of American Pinball, Brian McCauley from Pintastic and Martin Ayub of Pinball News.

You can watch a recording of the IAAPA show section here from the Pintastic YouTube Channel.

Also taking place in on Saturday evening was the final of the main tournament at Pintastic, the Silverball Rumble.

The final took place between Mitchell Curtis and Zachary Frey. It was a best-of-five final which came down to the final fifth game on *Total Nuclear Annihilation* after both player had won two game.

Mitch started, completing his three balls for a 1.4M total. However, when Zachary was on his final ball, the lower playfield insert lighting and ball saver timer stopped working. After an initial repair, the last ball restarted only for the fault to recur.

[![Problems with the game on the last ball of the final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/064-pintastic-2021-1024x675.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pintastic-2021/064-pintastic-2021.jpg)

Problems with the game on the last ball of the final

Eventually the game was repaired and the last ball could continue, but Zachary couldn’t catch Mitchell’s total, giving Mitchell the win. Zachary was second, Joe Lemire was third and Anna Wolk fourth. All four won trophies and sizeable cash prizes with over $1,000 going to the winner. The presentations were made by Jim Swain from The Sanctum.
