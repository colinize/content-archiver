American Pinball’s new Galactic Tank Force game

It is now confirmed that there will be four versions of the game available: Classic, Deluxe, Limited and Signature with only the latter two including the tank-like cabinet sides and backbox.

Naturally, the UFOs in the game try to beam up cows, in a subtle nod to Williams’ use of cows in their games.

Details of the pricing of each of the four models is yet to be announced, but we can expect the top-of-the-range Signature Edition to be reassuringly expensive with a maximum of only 200 units built.

Pinball News will, of course, bring you more details of *Galactic Tank Force* right here, and we will be in Frisco to cover the public presentation at the Texas Pinball Festival too.
