Story
dated
26 April, 2003

Chicago's Tribune
newspaper recently ran an interesting article about pinball in the
city, but it is a familiar story echoed the world over.

In the story Jason Compton
interviews many people about the state of the game including Stern's
Gary Stern and Illinois Pinball's Gene Cunningham.

Computers and PlayStations
have finished what Atari started almost 30 years ago--flipping pinball
into obscurity.

The rows of blinking, clanging
and silver-ball-bumping games in arcades and local bars largely have
disappeared. A generation of gamers thinks the Pinball Wizard is a
character from a Harry Potter novel.

Yet in Chicago, once the
capital of a thriving international pinball business, the game is
hanging on.

"I enjoy pinball,
whenever there's one in a bar," said Chicago resident Christina
Mann, after playing at Champs Sports Bar and Grill in Morton Grove.

Finding a machine is the
tricky part.

Two or three new games
a year are produced in the Chicago area, which is a far cry from the
heyday, when two new games a week would hit the streets.

Stern Pinball of Melrose
Park is the lone maker of new pinball machines, producing 8,000 to
10,000 tables per year since President Gary Stern, a second-generation
pinball devotee, bought the company back from Sega in 1999.

Stern runs his business
on modest--and profitable--expectations.

"The pinball business
world-wide is not as large as 10 years ago. It's maybe 10 percent,"
he said. "There's a market for that, enough business for that,
and we have restructured ourselves to operate well and profitably
and at a significantly lower level."

The majority of the games
produced by Stern since its rebirth have been well-known licensed
names, from the Simpsons to Harley-Davidson and even a computer game,
RollerCoaster Tycoon.

Stern's approach is faring
better than the Pinball2000 concept that WMS Industries Inc., the
one-time giant of Chicago pinball when it was known as Williams Electronics
Games Inc., introduced in the late 1990s before getting out of the
business in 1999.

Pinball2000 used a floating-projection
screen to show high-resolution graphics to players without drawing
their eyes from the table. But players weren't excited by this blend
of technology, and Williams exited the market entirely after making
just a few Pinball2000 games.

"Our goal was to breathe
new life into pinball and try to fuse these two elements--video and
pinball--together as one," said Dave Mueller, a Midway Games
employee who worked as a 3-D artist on Pinball2000. He said that the
small market didn't provide many opportunities to make the new concept
succeed.

"I don't think we
were ever given a chance to prove ourselves over the long haul."

Mann said modern pinball
games discourage fans by overemphasising gimmicks at the expense of
gameplay.

"You don't get a lot
of play time," she said.

Another reason why it has
become increasingly difficult to find a place to play is that a growing
number of machines go straight to private residences and basement
playrooms. Pinball has become too expensive for many bars and arcades
to offer.

"A pinball game is
a service-intense piece of equipment," said Steve White, Wilmette-based
editor of RePlay, an amusement industry trade magazine. He said that
rather than send out trained service technicians, it is easier for
the leasing companies that operated most pinball machines to replace
them with lower-maintenance games.

Marco Rossignoli, author
of the book "Pinball Memories--Forty Years of Fun 1958-1998,"
said that poorly maintained pinball machines have done as much damage
to the market as video games.

"Kids or adults who
have an initial interest in pinball, or perhaps are playing a game
for the first time, get ripped off ... with a pinball game that is
not working properly and don't ever play again," Rossignoli said.

One of the biggest problems
for pinball is that it simply cannot find a home.

Its traditional floor space
in taverns is being taken up by smaller, lower-maintenance competitors,
such as the popular video golf game Golden Tee.

Arlington Heights resident
Jen Webber, who spent more than 45 minutes playing Golden Tee at Champs,
with an empty pinball game next to her, credits the golf game with
dousing her fire for pinball.

"I used to love pinball,
but there are no good games anymore. Golf, you need a little more
thought for," she said.

"We really are one
of the reasons for the decline of pinball," said Gary Colabuono,
director of marketing for Arlington Heights-based Incredible Technologies
Inc., makers of Golden Tee. "We took the real estate that was
allocated for the pinball machine."

Although rumours that Incredible
might make pinball games swirled after the company hired acclaimed
pinball designer Mark Ritchie, Colabuono said there is no story there.
"We hired him because he's a great game designer."

What space Golden Tee hasn't
eaten has been widely cut away by touchscreen games, such as trivia
or solitaire, which are small, cheaply made and can sit on the bar
itself. Unlike pinball or even a classic arcade game, touchscreen
machines offer diversionary

entertainment rather than a test of reflex and skill. The other great
haven of pinball, the arcade, has itself become endangered.

"Arcades of the '80s
were so popular with teens because they could get an experience that
they could not get at home. Now, that's entirely opposite," Colabuono
said. "PlayStations and X-boxes, they're powerful, powerful machines,
and they give you more than you can get with a coin-op experience.
If it weren't for the bar market, we'd have no place to put games."

Gene Cunningham, president
of Bloomington-based Illinois Pinball Co. does see some potential
for growth.

The company is a distributor
and manufacturer of pinball parts and has grown rapidly through acquisition,
buying up the parts stocks of three manufacturers that shut down in
the '90s, including Williams. But Cunningham also bought the rights
to build Capcom pinball games and said he is in negotiations to acquire
Williams' mothballed designs as well.

He foresees re-releasing
classic titles, saying that the market has proven it will buy the
best sellers. "Some of the machines built seven or eight years
ago are bringing more now than when they were new."

Meanwhile, pinball fans
are keeping the faith.

In October, Rosemont will
host the 19th annual Pinball Expo, which brings together industry
figures of the past and present with players from around the world.
Expo chairman Robert Berk said that collectors and fans have done
a good job of introducing their children to the game, which keeps
a steady flow of younger attendees coming to the event.

And players like Glen Morhlein
of Skokie, who plays pinball twice a week, are waiting for more.

"Hang in there, because
there are people out there who want to play," he said.
