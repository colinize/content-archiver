[Stern Pinball](https://sternpinball.com/) today revealed their latest title and their first of 2019, the much-anticipated John Borg design, *The Munsters*.

[![The Munsters, from Stern Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/063-munsters-1024x427.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/063-munsters.jpg)

The Munsters, from Stern Pinball

Based on the mid-’60s TV series of the same name, *The Munsters* has been known about for many months, with the only doubt being about the timing of the release – whether it would debut in 2018 before [*The Beatles: Beatlemania Pinball*](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2018/10/26/beatles-pinball/), or after it.  As it transpired, The Beatles was seen as the better prospect for holiday sales and took precedence.

*The Munsters* is being debuted at the [CES 2019](https://www.ces.tech/) consumer electronics show in Las Vegas where Stern Pinball have a large presence and are presenting this latest release alongside their other recent title *The Beatles* on their stand.

As usual, the game arrives in three variants – Pro, Premium and a 500-machine Limited Edition.  However, unlike the last few Stern releases, there are significant playfield differences between the Pro and the upper two models.

Starting with the Pro, the cabinet, backbox and translite all feature very colourful depictions of the Munster family, even though the TV series on which this is based was shot in black-and-white.

[![The Pro model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/001-munsters-619x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/001-munsters.jpg)

The Pro model

That black-and-white nature of the original TV series is mirrored in the Premium model which is largely monochromatic both on the exterior and interior.

[![The Premium model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/002-munsters-616x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/002-munsters.jpg)

The Premium model

It was thought for a while that the Limited Edition model would get the monochrome treatment, but it’s back to full colour for the LE, albeit with a rather more classy coffin-style art package along with gold backbox trim and legs.

The Limited Edition model

Let’s start our look at the playfield with the Pro model before seeing what the upper models add to the mix.

The Pro playfield

So this is a two-flipper, two-ramp, six-ball game, with a central Herman Munster bash toy featuring a magnet in front, all-metal ramps, Grandpa’s Laboratory scoop, two Eddie orbit lanes, a side Dragway kicker lane, two long standup targets on the left and right, two inlanes on the left side, and an illuminated ‘Zap’ button on the lock bar.

The left ramp hides Spot, who pops up to block shots.

There are a couple of not-so-hidden characters in Christopher Franchi’s artwork.

The centre of the playfield

The Pro’s playfield has a rather sparse central area, and that’s because the Premium and Limited Edition models add a lower playfield below a Persepx window which occupies this section.

Let’s look at the LE version first of the game before turning to the Premium.

[![The Limited Edition's numbered plaque](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/055-munsters-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/055-munsters.jpg)

The Limited Edition playfield

The game designer’s signature is on the bottom apron these days, rather than under the playfield’s clearcoat.

[![The signed apron](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/061-munsters-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/061-munsters.jpg)

The signed apron

So, let’s look at that lower playfield.

[![The lower playfield in the LE model](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/062-munsters-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/games/munsters/062-munsters.jpg)

The lower playfield in the LE model

This Grandpa’s Laboratory mini-playfield uses a smaller diameter ball and smaller flippers to match, much like the Stewie Pinball playfield on Family Guy. The flippers have their own dedicated buttons on the cabinet sides, allowing the upper and lower playfields to be flipper independently.

There are five shots – two orbits, a left upkicker which feeds a wireform, a right clear plastic ramp, and a central The Machine target.  There are no slingshots but there is a two-digit LED counter to show the time remaining.  There are two balls installed beneath the Perspex, giving Grandpa’s Laboratory the unusual ability to play multiball modes.

The lower playfield is the main addition to the Limited Edition and Premium models.  The LE also includes inner-cabinet art.

The right-side inner artwork

The LE and Premium also gain illuminated signs on the left and right ramps.

The Limited Edition cabinet art

The Limited Edition model also comes with a shaker motor, anti-reflection glass, a mirrored backglass and laser-cut spider web metal cabinet armour.

The Premium model sports the Centaur-like black-and-white art package with spot colour accents on the cabinet, backbox and playfield.

The monochrome Premium playfield

Although the artwork is black-and-white, all the inserts are the same colour as the Limited Edition model.

The whole Premium playfield

There have been several videos posted showing gameplay at the CES show, but Jack Danger was there for the launch, so it’s probably best to check out his [Dead Flip stream](https://www.twitch.tv/deadflip) to catch up on how the game plays.
