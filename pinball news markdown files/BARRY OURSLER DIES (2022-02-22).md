Barry Oursler

Barry had [recently started working for American Pinball](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2022/02/06/oursler-engler-join-american/) as a game designer, having previously been employed at Deeproot Pinball.

He is understood to have been undergoing treatment for cancer and died yesterday as a result of complications. He was aged 70.

Barry had a long and illustrious career designing pinballs for Williams, starting in 1978 with his first game, *Phoenix* and ending in 1996 with *Junkyard*. In-between he designed many landmark titles including *Gorgar*, the first speaking game, *Space Shuttle* – widely credited with saving the pinball business in the mid-’80s – as well as the *Comet*–*Cyclone*–*Hurricane* trilogy based on rides at the Riverview amusement park in Chicago, and *Pinbot* which also went on to spawn two sequels.

Barry quickly developed a reputation for speed and flexibility in his work. He could rapidly create game designs, always had numerous design ideas in his head, and often collaborated with other designers and artists to help complete their projects, most notably working with Python Anghelo on titles such as *Jokerz!*, *Bad Cats* and *Popeye Saves The Earth*.

After leaving Williams, Barry moved to Betson as a Purchasing Manager before spending time working remotely on game designs at Heighway Pinball. He came to the UK to visit the factory in 2014 and be the special guest at the [UK Pinball Party](https://www.pinballnews.com/shows/ukpinballparty2014/index.html) where he was inducted into the UK Pinball Group Hall of Fame.

It was also in 2014 that Barry made an [appeal to the pinball community](https://www.pinballnews.com/news/oursler.html) for help paying medical bills. He had been diagnosed with bone cancer in February 2013, while his wife, Donna, was suffering from kidney failure. His initial target of $20,000 was quickly achieved, with the total of the donations reaching $33,718 by the end of the fundraiser.

When Deeproot Pinball began their operation in San Antonio, Barry was one of the four game designers at the company alongside John Popadiuk, Dennis Nordman and Jon Norris.

| American Pinball and Aimtron Corporation are saddened to announce the passing of legendary game designer, Barry Oursler at the age of 70.   Barry designed more than 40 pinball games over his long and illustrious 40-plus year pinball career. Among them, his Space Shuttle game released in 1984 is said by many to have saved and revitalized the pinball industry.  “*I was looking forward to designing new games and new mechs with you. I had a wonderful time working on all your games.*” – Zofia Ryan  “*I will always remember Barry’s brilliant, dry sense of humor, and always having me in stitches.*” – Jack Haeger  “*I was looking forward to him coming to American Pinball to work with him and enjoying all of the good cooking that Barry made.*” – Dennis Nordman  “*What can one say about one of the true pinball design masters of the past forty years. Barry established himself as not just a creative talent but a genuinely humble individual who never sought the outside accolades but rather the internal contentment of what he was achieving. From the first time we worked together with Phoenix and Barracora to many subsequent projects, Barry remained a very special coworker and friend. I will miss him dearly but know his legacy will endure forever.*” – Roger Sharpe  Those who have had the honor of working with Barry know of his dedication, his efficiency, his kindness and great enthusiasm for pinball and its players. His games are easy to understand, fun to play, and difficult to master, the perfect combination that earned him admirers from all over the pinball world.  “*Barry’s game, Space Shuttle, was my introduction to the pinball world. It was a privilege and an honor to work with him as a new member of the pinball industry and then again here at American Pinball.*” – Steven Bowden  “*Barry has always come across as a gentle giant. He was a guy I was happy to bring on to American Pinball. I am greatly saddened for his family.*” – David Fix  “*I will always miss Barry for his soft spoken nature and his support of Pinball Expo since day one.*” – Rob Berk, Pinball Expo  “*Barry was a great friend and an early mentor for me in the Pinball biz. We spent 15 years working together at Williams. Barry was always willing to help me out with anything I needed while cutting my teeth in Pinball design. He was also a really fun guy. We made friends almost immediately. He had a sharp mind for humor and would jab me with practical jokery from time to time. I have nothing but fond memories of our time together.*  *Barry had a heart of gold and was a good man. I had the pleasure of working on a game with Barry — that game was Police Force. We would jokingly lament together regarding Python’s crazy ways during development. It was a great experience and I am thankful to have had that opportunity. There were so many good times over the years. Suffice it to say – Great Friend, great person, and I shall miss him a great deal. Rest In Peace, my friend.*” – Mark Ritchie  “*It saddens me that we lost one of the good guys. He was known as a prankster on some occasions and possibly playing with fireworks in the offices. A great designer and a good friend. He will be sadly missed.*” – Ken Fedesna  “*It was a great privilege to host him at the UK Pinball Show and to have him speak at the banquet about his amazing career in gaming.*” – Gary Flower – UK  Our deepest condolences go out to his family, many friends and the pinball community.   He will be truly missed. |
