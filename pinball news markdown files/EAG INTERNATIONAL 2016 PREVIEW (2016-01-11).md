**The annual EAG amusement show opens on Tuesday, but we have an early preview of the pinballs from the show’s set-up on Monday.**

So far only Stern Pinball’s distributor Electrocoin have pinballs on their stand.

The new *Spider-Man Vault Edition* is here, along with a *Star Trek Pro*, *Kiss Pro* and *Game of Thrones Pro*.

The *Spider-Man* will most likely draw the most attention when the show opens.

Heighway Pinball also has a large stand at the show, but they will not be setting up until first thing Tuesday morning. They are expected to have a number of *Full Throttle* machines and some reveals for *Alien*, their second title.

With *The Hobbit* not yet shipping and a long backlog of orders, there is no presence this year by Jersey Jack Pinball or their distributor Pinball Heaven.

Elsewhere on the show floor – and totally unrelated to pinball, of course – another licence is proving to be popular in the amusement world.
