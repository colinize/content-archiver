The latest game from [For Amusement Only Games](https://foramusementonlygames.com/) for the [Multimorphic P3 pinball platform](https://www.multimorphic.com/p3-pinball-platform/) has been announced, although it will be a while before it is available to purchase.

*[Steelbound](https://steelboundpinball.com/)* is Nick Baldridge’s sixth P3 project, following on from *Quest for Glory*, *Ranger in the Ruins*, *Silver Falls*, *Flipper Foxtrot Rhythm Explosion* and *Drained* (incorporating *Drained: Bite Sized*).

*Steelbound* is the work of Nick and his talented team, including [Jon Chad](https://www.jonchad.com/) on artwork, Soliu Jamiu on character and 3D model animations, and [Charles Wolf](https://charleswolfmusic.com/) who composed and performed the soundtrack. You can hear eighty-eight tracks from the game on [Charles’s SoundCloud site](https://soundcloud.com/charles-wolf-composer/sets/steelbound-ost-official).

The game is a novel role-playing adventure where, following graduation from high school, the player must make a number of choices throughout the game to determine their career path, which friends they bond with, as well as expanding their leisure activities, all of which help decide their future. They also get to pilot a giant robot to explore dungeons, collect treasure, and even unearth dangerous truths about the world of pinball.

Controlling a giant robot is only one aspect of the game

*Steelbound* is unique in other ways. Although it can be played and completed with any of the existing P3 playfield modules installed, additional gameplay, characters, locations and music are made available depending on which module is fitted.

Additionally, the dungeons are procedurally-generated, changing each time the game is restarted. However, a player’s progress through the game is automatically saved and can be reloaded at any time.

Although the game isn’t expected to be released for several months, a number of *Steelbound*-branded items are available to purchase right now in the [For Amusement Only Games store](https://for-amusement-only-games-llc.square.site/s/shop).

We’ll keep you updated with *Steelbound*‘s progress right here at Pinball News and, of course, bring you many more details of the game as it moves closer to release.
