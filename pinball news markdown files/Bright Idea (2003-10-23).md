It's
the one big issue if you own an older solid state pinball game. Displays.

Once
manufacturers started using microprocessors to control the games,
they used high voltage gas plasma displays to show scores, ball number
and credits remaining.

These
displays are prone to failure as are the high voltage circuits required
to drive them. But the main problem now - and something that will
only get worse in the future - is availability. These games were not
designed to still be functioning today, and so these problems fall
mainly on the home user, though many games using these displays are
still on routes around the world.

So
what do you do when manufacturers cease production and you need a
new display?

Well,
one German company has come up with a solution - PinLED.
They have produced LED versions of these displays designed specifically
for pinball use.

But
can LEDs ever look like the original displays?

The
answer is "absolutely yes". Possibly even better because
they will keep looking bright and crisp throughout their life.

PinLED
have made nine different models to replace the displays in Williams
system 11, WPC and Data East games, so they come in 7-digit
and 16 digit varieties, with single or dual line versions available
too.

But
the big deal about these displays is because they are surface
mount LEDs they run from a 5V supply and don't need the high
voltages. So even if your high voltage supply has failed you
can still just plug in these LED replacements and you're up
and running as there is a 5V supply in the original cable.

PinLED
suggest you disconnect the high voltage supply to avoid the
possibility of shocks or fire but you can leave it working if
you want. Either way, it is not needed with these displays.

Not only do they look fantastic,
they also support all the scrolling, dimming, flashing and fading
of the originals. The company believes that anyone with modest technical
abilities should be able to fit one in ten minutes.

We mentioned the lifetime
of the displays. PinLED's Jurgen Jakobi says the company offers a
five year warranty but they should last indefinitely.

Most of these displays
are available right now, either direct
from PinLED or in the North America from Marco
Specialities.

That's what's available
now, but in the future they will also be producing LED versions of
the 128x16 dot matrix displays used in some Data East games and no
longer produced.

They have a 128x32 LED
display but it is uneconomic when compared to the currently available
high voltage versions. Also, it shows a noticeable grid pattern which
is being addressed.

But for anyone with a game
using 7 or 16 character displays, you now have any excuse for that
missing digit or a dim display.
