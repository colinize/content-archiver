**Date:** 25th-27th March, 2022
**Location:** Dallsas Frisco Hotel & Convention Center, 7600 John Q Hammons Dr., Frisco, TX 75034, USA.

After the 2020 and 2021 shows were cancelled, we’re back in Frisco for the 2022 edition of the [Texas Pinball Festiva](https://texaspinball.com/tpf/)l. We’re in the familiar surroundings of the [Embassy Suites Hotel and Conference Center](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/dalfses-embassy-suites-dallas-frisco-hotel-and-convention-center/) which has hosted the show since 2014.

The Embassy Suites Hotel & Convention Center in Frisco

As you can see, the weather is excellent and the temperature is good enough not to need a coat when outside in the daytime. The Embassy Suites hotel is the accommodation and dining part of the complex, but the attached Conference Center is where the Texas Pinball Festival is hosted.

The corridor from the hotel to the Conference Center

A separate team run the Conference Center, and there is a dedicated entrance at the end of this corridor for those not staying in the hotel.

The show opens to the public at 5pm on Friday 25th March, but we got to the venue on Wednesday evening. Even then, the organisational team were hard at work preparing the 1,600+ show registration packets for guests who pre-purchased their tickets this year or had tickets rolled-over from 2020 or 2021 when the show had to be cancelled.

On Wednesday evening the main show hall was almost completely empty but it wouldn’t be long before the first stands and machines arrived.

Sure enough, by Thursday morning there were multiple machines on the show floor, although most were still in their boxes.

[CoinTaker](https://cointaker.com/) had a display of four *Alien* pinballs by [Pinball Brothers](https://www.pinballbrothers.com/) – two Standard Version and two Limited Version models.

Under the playfield of the Limited Version model

There is also a *Funhouse* game with the new *[Funhouse: Rudy’s Nightmare](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2021/11/19/funhouse-rudys-nightmare-announced/)* kit from Pedretti installed. This adds new rules, a colour LCD main display, a new speaker panel with upgraded speakers and sound system, and a secondary LCD on the playfield replacing the mystery mirror.

[Marco Specialties](https://www.marcospecialties.com/control/main) are representing [Stern Pinball](https://sternpinball.com/) and are expected to have two dozen of the latest Stern machines on their stand. On Thursday morning the stand was still under construction.

[![The Marco Specialties stand being built](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/019-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/019-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

All machines and vendor items came into the Main Hall through the loading doors at the rear. Games were checked in and recorded before moving to their designated spot in the staging area. This allows machines to be unloaded quickly and the truck in which they came to be moved out of the way to make space for the next delivery.

[![Machines arriving for the show](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/006-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x589.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/006-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

Promotional banners hang from the ceiling throughout the hall and the connecting corridor. With such high ceilings, it’s no small task to attach them.

The Texas Pinball Festival is run by Paul McKinney and husband and wife team Ed and Kim VanderVeen. They operate out of the organisers room which is also the ticket desk where guests can either pick up their pre-purchased ticket packages or buy daily tickets if they didn’t pre-register.

[![The ticket desk is almost ready](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/014-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x680.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/014-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

This year, the tournaments have been given their own, larger space on the mezzanine level.

When we first visited, none of the tournament machines had yet arrived, but it was clear the new space would be a good fit for tournament play.

The Main Hall on Thursday lunchtime

By Friday morning the show hall was taking shape, with just a few hours to go until the guests would be admitted. We took a look around to see the work taking place and what those guests can expect to see.

[![Some of the games near the Main Hall's entrance](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/041-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/041-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

It’s traditional for there to be a Safecracker game near the entrance dispensing custom TPF magic tokens, and this year is no different with a new token design for the 2022 show.

Meanwhile, qualifying for the Wizards and Classics tournaments began at 10am in the new Tournaments Room. It was busy in the room right from the very start with games being played and competitors collecting their registrations.

Outside the Main Hall, a second ticket desk had opened up to cater for those buying on-the-day tickets. Most guests appeared to have pre-registered as the queue for on-the-day tickets was much shorter.

[![The ticket desk for at-show purchases](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/046-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x719.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/046-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

[![Pizza, snacks and drinks were available in the lobby](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/131-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/131-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

The doors to the Main Hall opened on-time at 5pm on Friday and there was an immediate inrush of guests eager to check out all the latest games and snap up the best deals from the many vendors.

Friday also sees the start of the seminars at the Texas Pinball Festival. In fact, they begin even before the Main Hall opens with the first talk taking place at 3:30pm.

Here’s the list of seminars. We’ll add more details to them as they progress.

Mirco was launching the new Tales of the Arabian Nights upgrade kit called The Forgotten Tales.

This is the latest official “2.0” kit following the recent Funhouse: Rudy’s Nightmare, and it comes with a new speaker panel featuring a full colour display, improved 2-way speakers, new artwork and seven RGB inserts. These inserts correspond with the seven new tales incorporated into the new software.

[![The new speaker panel in the kit for The Forgotten Tales](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/056-texas-pinball-festival-2022-1024x677.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/texas-pinball-festival-2022/056-texas-pinball-festival-2022.jpg)

The new speaker panel in the kit for The Forgotten Tales

The new tales are *The Voyage of Sinbad*, *The Treasure of Ali-Baba*, *Flying Horse: The Lost Lands*, *Save Scheherazade*, *The Palace Race*, *Flying Carpet: Escape from the Cave* and *The Cyclops & The Hydra*.

The kit comes with a new FAST Pinball controller, a new larger subwoofer and an autolauncher to replace the manual version in the original game, while the software features new music and new call-outs from the original voice artist, five additional multiball modes and two new video modes.

The kit costs €2677.50 (around $2,950) from [Mirco Playfields](https://mircoplayfields.com/en) and is sold initially in a Beta form before being available as a full production version.

Despite repeated questioning from the audience about production problems with his playfields which are used in Jersey Jack Pinball machines, Mirco said he wasn’t able to talk about that subject.

Players moved to the left side of the play area if they thought the first possible answer was correct, or the right side for the second possible answer. Those who picked the correct answer continued to the next round.

When there were just a few contestants left, they all got to pick a ticket for one of the many prizes which included a *Guns ‘N Roses* playfield, a *Legends of Valhalla* backglass, translites for *The Avengers: Infinity Quest*, *Deadpool* and *Godzilla* as well as multiple hoodies, T-shirts, baseball hats, mugs, and much more generously donated by the quiz’s sponsors Jersey Jack Pinball, American Pinball, Stern Pinball, Spooky Pinball, ColorDMD, Sunshine Laundromat, Pinball Magazine, Pinball News and the Texas Pinball Festival.

It’s the 2021 TWIPY Awards held at the 2022 Texas Pinball Festival

We took the opportunity of the awards ceremony to join a large group heading to the local *Hard 8* BBQ smokehouse for dinner, so only caught the very end of the event. It appeared to be well attended and appreciated by the live audience, although there were obviously technical issues over the sound quality and the order of the award announcements which, we are told, will be addressed for next year’s ceremony.

10pm – **TWIPY After Party – Marco Specialties, Pinball Life & Texas Pinball Festival**

Once the awards were over, attendees could dance to music provided by DJ mTort, Scott Danesi and DQB.

The semi-finals of the Texas Wizards Tournament

160 players were confirmed to compete, with a further 125 on a waiting list in case anyone dropped out.

The final was contested by Steven Bowden, Raymond Davidson, Chris Frame and Preston Moncla and was played over three machines – *Aztec*, *Flash Gordon* and *Dialed In!* – with a 4-2-1-0 scoring system.

Despite coming last on *Aztec*, Raymond Davidson went on to win the second and third games to give him 8 points and first place.

Steven Bowden took third and two seconds to end up second overall with 5 points. Preston Moncla and Chris Frame tied on 4 points each, so played a tie-breaker which Preston won to take third place.

**Sunday**

The Main Hall opened at 10am but it was a truncated day at the TPF as the closing ceremony took place in the Seminars Room at 2:30pm, hosted by show co-organiser, Ed VanderVeen.

To help relax after three days of action stress balls were distributed to the audience, although the method of distribution might have induced even more stress.
