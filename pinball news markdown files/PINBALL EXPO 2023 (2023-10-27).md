Welcome to the start of our coverage of Pinball Expo 2023, held at the Schaumburg Convention Center in the city of Schaumburg near Chicago.

The Schaumburg Convention Center, home of Pinball Expo

The Convention Center is attached to the huge Renaissance hotel – part of the Marriott chain – and it is here where most out-of-town guest stay for Pinball Expo.

[![The Renaissance hotel](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/001-pinball-expo-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/001-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The Renaissance hotel

The show occupies the Discovery and Adventure halls, which are located at ground level, allowing vendors and machine-bringers to drive their stands and games straight into position.

**Wednesday**

We begin our coverage on Wednesday afternoon. At this point, the show hall is still being set up ahead of the public opening on Thursday at noon. So this part of the report looks at the set up and previews what will be available for guests.

[![The main entrance is through the Discovery hall](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/004-pinball-expo-2023-1024x697.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/004-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

As you enter the hall, on the right are several laptops where those looking to buy on-the-day tickets can register and make their purchases.

At 7pm, buses departed from the Convention Center for the short drive to Enterrium in the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg which was hosting the Bumper Blast welcome party.

Enterrium in Schaumburg

As guests entered the building they were told what food and drink was available, as well as how the smart cards they were given worked on the multitude of arcade games available to play.

[![A quick briefing on the goodies awaiting inside](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/032-pinball-expo-2023-1024x525.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/032-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

There was a dedicated dining room where guests could help themselves to the hot food and cold drinks. Additional paid food options as well as a full bar were also available in the main bar area if that was preferable.

[![Some of the free food available](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/034-pinball-expo-2023-1024x461.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/034-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The soft drinks

After dinner, almost the entire array of amusement machines were available to play for free using the provided Enterrium smart card. This card added credit to the games throughout the evening until closing time at 10pm, but didn’t collect any redemption tickets you might be awarded.

The games included pinballs, shooters, driving games, skill games and many more, including Enterrium’s bowling lanes.

The bowling lanes

The venue was also hosting the finals of the Stern Pro Circuit Championship, using two banks of machines set up alongside the bowling lanes. The Championship is a series of twenty tournaments held predominantly in the US but also comprising events in Canada, the UK and Australia.

Last year the finals commandeered nearly all the pinballs in Enterrium, leaving only a select few for Bumper Blast guests to play. Fortunately, this situation was rectified for 2023, with plenty of pinballs available.

The Championship finals came down to a battle between two young players – Jared August and Escher Lefkoff. Escher triumphed, collecting the prize of $5,000 plus a new Stern Pinball Pro machine. Jared, in second place won $2,000, while cash prizes were awarded to all 32 competitors, down to $250 for the eight players knocked out in the first round.

Buses ran between the Convention Center and Enterrium throughout the evening, allowing guests to come and go as they pleased. The final buses departed Enterrium at 10pm, taking guests back to the Convention Center and the hotel, ready for the events on Thursday which began with the Stern Pinball factory tour.

**Thursday**

The buses for the Stern Pinball factory tour arrived on-time at 9am. By then, the queue to board them extended from the doors right down the length of the hallway.

For our coverage of Pinball Expo we have concentrated on bringing you the extensive schedule of forty-five seminar talks and presentations. That meant setting up all the audio, video and computer equipment in the seminar hall on Thursday morning while the Stern Pinball factory tour was taking place.

As a result, we weren’t able to join the tour ourselves. However, we do have pictures courtesy of Jonathan Joosten from [Pinball Magazine](https://pinball-magazine.com/) who was assisting us with the seminar recordings but was able to take time out from the set-up to visit Stern Pinball.

Stern Pinball decided not to let anyone take pictures during the tour – including media representatives. They policed the policy very tightly with staff all along the tour route making sure nobody took out a camera or a phone.

**Tournaments**

The tournaments held at Pinball Expo each year have always been a big reason for many to attend the show. When Expo was held at the Westin, all the tournaments were held in a glass-fronted corridor which caused congestion and suffered from excessive sunlight as the day wore on. However, since Expo moved to the Schaumburg Convention Center, the tournaments have had their own dedicated suite of four rooms (Schaumburg E, F, G & H).

[![The entrance to the tournaments room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/600-pinball-expo-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/600-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The entrance to the tournaments room

There were three banks of machines. The largest was for the main Flip Out tournament which consisted of thirty-two recent Stern Pinball titles provided, like all the Stern machines in the room, by Tilt Amusements.

[![Inside the tournaments room](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/602-pinball-expo-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/602-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

Inside the tournaments room

The machines in the main bank were:

* 4 x 007 James Bond Premium
* 2 x Deadpool
* 4 x Foo Fighters
* 4 x Godzilla
* 4 x Iron Maiden
* 4 x Jurassic Park
* 2 x Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
* 4 x The Avengers: Infinity Quest
* 4 x Venom

They were evenly split between Pro-level machines and Premiums, with the Pros on the right and Premiums on the left.

On the other side of the room were two more banks of machines. One was for the Women’s Tournament and the other for the Classics.

The Women’s Tournament machines

The eight Women’s Tournament machines were:

* 2 x Venom
* 2 x Foo Fighters
* 2 x Iron Maiden
* 2 x Jurassic Park

In the Classics Tournament there were ten machines used.

[![The Classic Tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/607-pinball-expo-2023-1024x683.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/607-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The Classic Tournament

The machines were:

* Trident
* Kick Off!
* King of Diamonds
* Domino
* High Hand
* Drop-A-Card
* Star Pool
* Harlem Globetrotters
* Hot Tip
* Bristol Hills

Throughout the show, tournament action was streamed live on [Twitch by Fox Cities Pinball](https://www.twitch.tv/foxcitiespinball) from northeast Wisconsin. They were joined by an assortment of tournament players who dropped in to assist with the commentary.

[![The Fox Cities Pinball commentary team](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/606-pinball-expo-2023-1024x679.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/606-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The stream was also fed to a monitor in the tournament room where the audience could see the action more easily.

[![The standings and the live stream were available to watch](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/609-pinball-expo-2023-1024x701.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/609-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The standings and the live stream were available to watch

There was, however, a delay of around 10 seconds between what was happening in the tournaments room and what appeared on the screen. That mean whenever there was a cheer or groan by the commentary team, people could turn to the monitor to watch a replay what just happened.

In addition to these tournaments, there were several more held in the main show hall.

On Thursday there was a Virtual Pinball Tournament from noon until 10pm, and the Pinball Expo World Cup Tournament began at 4pm. There was also the Freedom To Play Pinball Tournament using accessible controllers and on Saturday, back in the tournaments room, a Kids Tournament for those aged 14 and under.

Sadly, our duties running and recording all the seminars left us unable to cover all the tournaments except those which wrapped-up on Sunday once all the other events had concluded, namely the main Flip Out and the Classics.

However, we did manage to catch up with the winner of the Women’s Tournament, Elizabeth Gieske, on Saturday evening soon after she triumphed in the final over second-placed Jane Verwys.

The Classics and Flip Out tournament were both concluded on Sunday.

In previous years many of the same players would be competing in the finals of both tournaments, leading to delays in completing the finals. Fortunately there were no such issues this year.

[![The trophies for the main Flip Out tournament](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/622-pinball-expo-2023-1024x694.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/622-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The trophies for the main Flip Out tournament

The Flip Out main tournament final was between Escher Lefkoff and Dalton Ely. Escher had qualified in first place, Dalton in seventh. Both remained undefeated in the double-elimination, best-of-five play-offs until they met in the semi-finals where Escher had won.

Dalton then defeated Zach McCarthy in the best-of-three loser bracket to face Escher again in the main final. Escher had only to win the best-of-five match to win overall. Dalton would have to beat Escher once and then beat him again in the best-of-three loser bracket final.

Dalton did win the best-of-five by 3-0, meaning they had both lost one match and were level. The best-of-three would decide things.

Having just lost to Dalton didn’t appear to faze Escher, as he won the fist game and headed to Jurassic Park for what could be the decider.

[![Escher and Dalton play Jurassic Park in the final](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/620-pinball-expo-2023-1024x669.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/pinball-expo-2023/620-pinball-expo-2023.jpg)

The B-Division of the main tournament concluded while we were in the seminars, but it was won by Miles Bradley, with Anna Neal in second, Frank Marion third and Ryan Dunn fourth.

That only leaves the Classics Tournament to decide.

The Classics play-offs followed the same format as the main, with a double-elimination format where it was best-of-five games in the winners bracket and best-of-three in the loser bracket. Whoever won the loser bracket would need to beat the winner of the winner bracket twice if they are to win overall.

Zach Parks remained undefeated, having also been the top qualifier. He faced Lewis Bevans who he had already beaten in the quarter-finals but had won the loser bracket to play Zach again in the final.

Zach won on *Kick Off!* while Lewis won on *Domino*, making the third game on *Trident* the decider.

Zach Parks in the final on Trident

Zach had a good second ball putting him comfortably in the lead, even though his third ball drained quickly. Could Lewis match and overtake him?

It wasn’t to be. Zach won the final of the Classics tournament, with Lewis second, Nick Weyna was third and Robert Byers (who had to leave early for a flight home) was fourth.

Although it’s the day of the finals for the two major tournament, Sunday is tear-down day in the main hall. No games can be played and the power is switched off to the vendor stands.

And this!

And with the closing of the show, we wrap up our coverage of Pinball Expo 2023.

This 39th year show was undoubtedly a big success with the issue of non-working free play games on the show floor being greatly reduced. In part that’s thanks to show organiser Rob Berk having a large collection of maintained, interesting games already set up at his Past Times arcade in Girard, Ohio. It’s a long drive to bring them to Expo, but it pays dividends.

This year also attracted several new game launches. Biggest of all has to be Jersey Jack Pinball’s *Elton John* game, but new pinball company Barrels of Fun made their debut here with their *Labyrinth*, while Turner Pinball brought a close-to-production-ready *Ninja Eclipse* and Pinball Adventures did likewise with their *Elements*, although both these latter two will probably undergo some changes before we see them next.

With American Pinball bringing their cast of Galactic Tank Force to the show, it was more a matter of who *wasn’t* at Expo, and why? There are now two clear markers in the pinball calendar around which you need to launch your new game – the Texas Pinball Festival and Pinball Expo.

Of course there is far more to Pinball Expo than we have been able to cover in this report – and plenty that happens in the Renaissance hotel’s two bars and around the fire pit that’s best not recounted here – but we hope you get a good flavour of the five days we spent in Schaumburg.

Any negatives to Pinball Expo this year? Well, the show seemed quieter than last year in terms of visitor numbers. There were also a few gaps on the show floor where more games or vendors could go. We know a last-minute rearrangement of the floor plan was required when the Convention Center realised they’d given the wrong dimension to the organisers, so we’re happy to cut them a little slack there.

From a purely selfish point of view, although three days of back-to-back seminars provides plenty of variety for the audience, we’d appreciate an earlier finish so we actually get to see the show, and more set-up time between seminars to give speakers space to get set up and get any unexpected technical requirements sorted out.

Despite that, we hope you enjoyed our extensive coverage of Pinball Expo 2023, containing 300 pictures and over 28 hours of video recordings. We’ll be back next year for the 40th year of Pinball Expo. It’s promising to be even bigger, with talk of starting events a day earlier to pack everything in.
