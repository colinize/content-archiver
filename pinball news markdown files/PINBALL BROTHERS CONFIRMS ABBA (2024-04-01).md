The game will feature twenty ABBA tracks – probably the most tracks by an artist or group incorporated into any single pinball machine – and will include footage from their ABBA Voyage stage show held in London.

This show features holographic performances of the band from their younger days, depicting how they would have appeared in 1979. The concert uses motion capture technology to reproduce the band’s actions and characteristics, and has received highly positive reviews, selling over 1.5 million tickets to date and generating revenue of over $150m. ABBA Voyage opened in May 2022 and is currently extended until November 2024, with the possibility to extend further until April 2026.

Pinball Brothers will be holding a launch event for their *ABBA* game in the Swedish city of Örebro on 6th April, 2024 – exactly 50 years to the day since ABBA launched themselves onto the worldwide musical stage by winning the Eurovision Song Contest, held in the UK city of Brighton, with the song *Waterloo*.
