| **CHICAGO, IL – January 3, 2025** – Today, Stern Pinball, Inc., the largest manufacturer of pinball games in the world, in collaboration with Hasbro and its Wizards of the Coast division, revealed **DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: The Tyrant’s Eye** – a new collection of pinball games featuring the legendary and beloved franchise, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS (D&D).   In celebration of 50 years of the World’s Greatest Roleplaying Game, Stern Pinball players worldwide will be brought on an epic and thrilling journey as they adventure into the Forgotten Realms, featuring iconic enemies, including a red dragon, gelatinous cube, mimic, Sammaster the lich, Xanathar the beholder, an owlbear, and locations including those in Faerûn such as Arabel and Westgate.   **DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: The Tyrant’s Eye** pinball games are available in Pro, Premium, and Limited Edition (LE) models and feature artwork by prolific artist Vincent Proce, music from world-renowned composer Cris Velasco, and voiced by a talented cast including Michael Dorn, Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, Gerard Way, Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray.  In Stern’s D**UNGEONS & DRAGONS: The Tyrant’s Eye** pinball games, players are chosen members of the Dragonshield Guild, trying to defeat the dragon queen Tiamat, who is hatching a plan to rise again, triggering the War of Dragons, with Xanathar, Balinor and Sammaster all fighting for power. Players will experience the game’s fantasy world under the glass, fusing pinball with the iconic franchise like never before.  Battle Rath the Relentless, the red dragon, the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball, intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion and features omnidirectional impact sensing technology.   Voiced by the iconic Michael Dorn, players will attempt to defeat Rath the Relentless with pinballs and by hitting the 3-bank target, steal its treasure. When Rath the Relentless breathes his magnificent fire, multiple pinballs shoot from its mouth but be prepared. Players can activate a metal shield between the flippers to not only defend against attacks but also assist with playfield shots.  Enjoy mysterious and exciting features by navigating through hidden passageways, experience an electromagnet-powered gelatinous cube that freezes the pinball, and explore dynamic dungeon levels that are accessed through a disappearing playfield trap door. Other features include Fizmo’s store that allows players to acquire unique items, a treasure chest that unleashes mimic monsters, and more secrets to uncover.  Roll the dice with randomness as players unlock where shots and choices control the path of the game’s campaign, driving toward different story endings. Each path is different for players, spanning from characters to trinkets to weekly items and more; once the game campaign has concluded, additional characters will be unlocked.  **DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: The Tyrant’s Eye** is in a beautiful package with Stern’s ever-expanding Insider Connected™ platform, which enables players to interact with the game and a global network of players in multiple ways, including ongoing code updates from Stern Pinball to extend and improve the experience over time.
