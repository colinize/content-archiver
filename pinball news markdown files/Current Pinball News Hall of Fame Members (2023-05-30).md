The latest Hall of Fame inductees are traditionally announced at the UK’s national pinball show. In 2008 and 2009 that was the *UK Pinball Show* organised by Nick Bennett. In 2010 Andrew Heighway took the reins with the *UK Pinball Party* which continued until 2015. After a hiatus for two years, Phillip Murphy launched the *UK Pinfest* show in 2018 which continues to this day, with the induction presentations resuming in 2022.

Here are all the inductees to the Pinball News Hall of Fame, also incorporating those inducted under its original name of the UK Pinball Group Hall of Fame:
