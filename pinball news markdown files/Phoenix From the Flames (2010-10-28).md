Pictures and report by Fishboy

Two years ago we reported on a devastating fire which destroyed the Grand Pier in Weston-super-Mare along with decades of history.

Apart from the building itself, the coin-op machines
in the arcade were also destroyed.  These included four new Stern machines - Indiana Jones, Spider-Man, Pirates of the Caribbean and Shrek.

We also reported how the co-owner Kerry Michael vowed to "work tirelessly to restore" the pier.

Well, just two years later, the pier is back and better than ever.

The opening of the new pier this month, which cost a reported £39 million ($62.5 million), has been a huge success with people pouring in to see the new attractions;  two £355,000 Formula 1 simulators, a multi-level go kart track, a 4D cinema and Robocoaster to mention just a few.

Fortunately another four pinball machines have been installed and were being enjoyed alongside the other new arcade machines.  These are a Shrek, a Spider-Man, a Big Buck Hunter Pro and a Batman.

It's always good to play a new machine and these are fresh out the crate.
