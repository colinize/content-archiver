Spooky Pinball’s upcoming Scooby-Doo pinball

The title was announced during a seminar by the Spooky Pinball team at the [Pincinnati 2022](https://pincinnati.com/) show, and also in an e-mail to members of Spooky’s subscription-based [Fang Club](https://shop.spookypinball.com/usa-spooky-pinball-fang-club-membership-p5.php). It was subsequently announced publicly on Spooky’s social media outlets.

The game is based on the original cartoon series rather than any of the spin-offs or re-boots, so it features the original five cast members, Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, Norville “Shaggy” Rogers and, of course, Scooby-Doo.

Voice work for the game comes from Frank Welker who has been the main actor portraying Fred since the series began in 1969. He has also played Scooby-Doo the past. Matthew Lillard voices Shaggy. More than sixteen voice artists have played Shaggy in various productions, but Matthew has portrayed him since 2010. Velma is voiced by Kate Micucci who played her in the spin-off series *Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!*, while Daphne is played by Grey Griffin (a.k.a. Grey DeLisle) who has been the voice of Daphne since 2010.

Artwork for *Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!* comes from Matt Frank and Jeff Zornow. Both Matt and Jeff have worked on earlier Spooky titles – Jeff created the artwork for *Alice Cooper’s Nightmare Castle* while Matt did the same for *Ultraman Kaiju Rumble*.
