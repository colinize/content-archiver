It’s not clear if American Pinball plan to make the *Sonic* game but Ryan brought the game into American Pinball’s offices. They are also currently producing another homebrew title, *Legends of Valhalla* from Riot Pinball and have invited homebrew game creators to bring their work to this year’s Pinball Expo to compete in the American Pinball’s American Dream competition.
