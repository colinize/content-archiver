**Date:** 14th July 2024

A month before the American Pinball party, we got a personal invitation from LTG at [SS Billiards](https://www.ssbilliards.com/).

| Hello Pinball News,  SS Billiards update.  Lots of new pinball machines since the last email. Here is a quick walk through video :  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MvVPHrfzh8>  The full American Pinball line up is here now, all 6 games.   Coming Sunday July 14th will be an American Pinball Party here to celebrate them. Noon to 10pm. Ribs at dinner time. And souvenirs. We’d like to see you there.  After the party we’ll be recovering the pool tables.  Thank you for your continued support.  LTG : ) |

Then on July 6th, Lloyd updated his Facebook page with more details.

On July 14th – the day of the party – as a result of large thunderstorms which had passed through the area sometime around midnight, at 1am the power was out at SS Billiards. After four hours of waiting to see if it returned, Lloyd finally decided to go to bed and see what the morning would bring.

By morning, luckily, power was back on and the party could proceed as planned.

Also on July 14th, but at 11:50am, Pinball News arrived to take pictures.

SS Billiards in Hopkins, the venue for the party

We are sad to say we were not greeted by the famous Prada. Instead, a new little face was happy to welcome us – Snowflake.

[![Welcome, Snowflake](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/17-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024-760x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/17-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024.jpg)

Welcome, Snowflake

However, Prada is forever memorialized in picture form.

It was then that we first got introduced to David Fix, American Pinball’s Executive Vice-President.

American Pinball, David Fix

During our chat, David told us all the secrets about the latest American Pinball game, [*Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge*](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2024/03/08/barry-os-barbecue-challenge/). But you, dear reader, will have to discover them for yourselves.

American Pinball’s Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge

There was a high score competition on *Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge* running throughout the party, with prizes for the top three scorers.

We gave ourselves a quick tour of the games at SS Billiards which now includes all the American Pinball titles as well as all the Chicago Gaming releases.

We asked Lloyd about his role providing customer technical support for American Pinball, starting with how he got the job.

He told us, “*Dave Fix head of American Pinball contacted me back in January and wanted me for tech support. Went smooth, didn’t have to sign anything. Pretty much anything I wanted. It took a little time but he wanted to get one of each American Pinball machine here.*“

We then asked why he took on the role.

He said, “*Since my first post on Rec.Games.Pinball, I’ve strived to help people with their pinball machines so they get the most out of them and make their pinball experience better. Working with American Pinball, is another step in being able to better help people with their games. I’m glad to be at this time and in this place!*“

The first party attendees arrived just after midday.

[![The first guests arrived soon after the doors opened](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/06-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024-1024x605.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/06-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024.jpg)

By 12:30pm the place had really started to fill up with guests keen to enjoy the full range of American Pinball titles.

[![Soon after opening SS Billiards began to get busy](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/14-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024-768x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/14-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024.jpg)

Although he was running the party, Lloyd still had to perform his tech support responsibilities for American Pinball, Chicago Gaming and Planetary Pinball customers.

Before dinner arrived, cookies and snacks were brought in.

Pre-dinner snacks

Just before 6pm, in keeping with the arrival of *Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge*, ribs arrived from [Famous Dave’s Bar-B-Q](https://www.famousdaves.com/menu/) restaurant in neighbouring Minnetonka.

[![The food arrives](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/19-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024-851x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/19-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024.jpg)

After dinner, game play continued strongly for a few more hours.

[![Dinner over, time to play](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/20-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024-830x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/20-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024.jpg)

Dinner over, time to play

By 9pm things had settled down and only the last few attendees remained.

At 10pm the party was officially over. However, a few far-travelling hangers-on were allowed to stay until 11pm. This included John, the big high score winner of the night. His score on Barry O’s Barbecue Challenge was unbeatable, earning him the top prize of a special bottle of Barry O’s sauce and a matching apron.

[![High Score Competition winner, John, receives his prize from David Fix](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/27-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024-706x1024.jpg)](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/wp-content/uploads/shows/american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024/27-american-pinball-ss-billiards-2024.jpg)

And with that presentation made, the American Pinball Party at SS Billiards officially came to an end.
