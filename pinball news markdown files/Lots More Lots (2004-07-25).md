Story  dated
July 25, 2004

Last time we reported on the first auction to sell the Pinball Paradise stock following the sad and untimely death of its proprietor Robert Thomson.

Today saw the second and final auction at the company's premises in Borden, Hampshire, UK.

Last time there were plenty of parts for sale along with 400 lots of pinball games and playfields.  In this auction, all the sales took place in the warehouse opposite the workshop. The workshop was closed to sellers and despite the expectation that the remaining parts would be boxed and sold as unlisted spares, no parts appeared in the auction at all.  There was also no word about where they would end up.

With many of the warehouse games already sold, there was much more room to display the remaining ones.  It wasn't all pinball this time either.  Of more than 400 lots, around 100 were video games, 250 were pinball or pinball related and 50 were slot machines.  They were arranged over two floors, the lower floor having a mix of games with the upper floor split into video games on one side and pinballs on the other.

Meanwhile, two containers of various parts from all types of games had been opened in the car park.  These were for sale and gave those who couldn't stay for the whole auction the chance to snap up a deal or two.

As before, none of the pinball games in the auction were powered, so buyers had to hope the games worked or bid accordingly.  Several video games were set up and ready to play which provided some welcome relaxation and fun.

Again, the auction began with a one minute of silence in Bob's honour and then the sales began.

Immediately it was apparent that prices were going to be higher this time around.  The games were in a better overall condition and news of the bargains at the last sale brought a bigger crowd of sellers hoping to repeat the deals.  There were also video game and slot machine collectors to swell the numbers.

It was good to see the pleasant atmosphere of the first sale continuing.  I didn't see anyone being awkward or unpleasant and there were no disputes about the bidding or the hammer prices.

The video games were sold first, followed by the pinballs with the slot machines bringing up the rear. The prices of all the lots are shown below in UK Pounds.  There was a 10% buyer's premium added on top but no sales tax.  To convert to US$, double the price shown. Blank lots have been removed and the game information comes from the auction catalogue.

From that list you can see that there were some big ticket items - the Dance Stage Twin reached £4,000 and a Joust managed just shy of £1,000 - and plenty of £20 deals too.  On the pinball side, the biggest price of the day was the £1,900 Monster Bash which was not exactly unexpected, but even the Alvin G soccer game sneaked in with a last minute £950, and that was without the metal arch.

The total raised in this auction was £91,415, which when added to the previous auction's £36,640 gives a grand total raised for Bob's family of £128,055.  To that can be added the proceeds from the parts sales.

Although, obviously, nothing can replace him, we hope the money goes some way to providing a safer, more secure future for them.
