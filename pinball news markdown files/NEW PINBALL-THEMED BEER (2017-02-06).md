Two Brothers Artisan Brewing in Warrenville, Illinois, just launched their new pinball-themed craft beer called *Pinball Juicy Hop Pale Ale*.

Of course, everyone knows drinking beer goes great with playing pinball, so I am reporting on what may be the first official pinball machine themed beer. The graphics on the can feature flippers, pop bumpers and pinballs.

The beer is light-bodied and highly-hopped. It has a tropical and citrus fruit flavor, hoppy and sweet. The alcohol content is 5.4% by volume.

Fans of pinball machines and hoppy, sweet craft beers should give this new beer a taste.

UPDATE

Chris Giles wrote to tell us about another pinball beer. This is from [Clifford Brewing](http://www.cliffordbrewing.com/beer/pinball-wizard/) in Hamilton, Ontario in Canada.

Pinball Wizard beer from Clifford Brewing

The 5.7% American Pale Ale is described by the brewers as having, “*dominant aromas of citrus, pine, and tropical fruits, paired with a smooth bitterness, and balanced with a slightly bready malt body*“.

Pinball Wizard doesn’t seem to be generally available outside Ontario, but if you find it in your local craft beer outlet please let us know.
