Following their announcement in October last year that they would be manufacturing the Whizbang Pinball game, Stern Pinball today confirmed that Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons is now available for purchase.

Whoa Nellie!  Big Juicy Melons

The game is the creation of Dennis Nordman and Greg Freres who teamed up to bring modern technology and high quality printing techniques to an old-school electromechanical game design. It is based on the Continental Cafe playfield, but has a new electronics system to control the lamps and solenoids, drive the score reels, generate in-game sounds, and provide playfield lighting.

The recommended retail price of the Stern-made Whoa Nellie! game is $6,499, pitching it around $1,000 above the price of a current Stern Pro model game and crushing any hopes it would be more affordable than a regular Stern game.

The game will be supplied with two mounting options -  the fruit crate base seen here, and a set of four powder-coated pinball legs for a more traditional look.

Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons was first unveiled as 'Project X' back in 2009 when it was still at the prototype stage. Dennis   said he'd always been a fan of fruit crate label designs and Greg   thought if they could combine that look with the Roy Parker/George   Molentin style of pin-up artwork, they could produce something   distinctive and attractive.

The Stern models has a number of differences, including a full-size coin door, the removal of the ball lift mechanism, the addition of backbox side art panels, the Stern logo on the backglass, and a change in the wording at the top left from "Packed & stacked by Whizbang Pinball Co., Chicago, Illinois" to "Packed & stacked somewhere near Chicago, Illinois.
