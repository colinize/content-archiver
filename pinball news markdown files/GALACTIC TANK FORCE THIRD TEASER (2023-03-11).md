The third (and presumably final) teaser video for American Pinball’s new title, *Galactic Tank Force*, has been published and, for the first time, we actually get to see both the game and the title.

As we [previously described](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2023/03/04/galactic-tank-force-second-teaser/), when folded down the game is intended to resemble a tank.

There are several shots of the cabinet in the teaser video, but nothing about what’s on the playfield.

Behind the backbox is an illuminated tank turret which is visible when the backbox is folded down but makes the game deeper when upright.

Finally, we do get the name of the game confirmed, as we have known ever since the [first teaser video](https://www.pinballnews.com/site/2023/02/25/american-pinball-teases-game-5/).
